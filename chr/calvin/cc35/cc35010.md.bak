<span id="xi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 21.

<span id="xi.i"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p1"></span><span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>[John
21:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001.md)<span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p2"></span>**1.** After these things Jesus manifested
himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested
himself thus. **2.** Simon Peter, and Thomas, who is called Didymus,
 <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) and Nathanael, who was of Cana
of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples,
were together. **3.** Simon Peter saith to them, I am going to fish;
they say to him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into
a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. **4.** And when
it was morning, Jesus stood on the shore; and the disciples knew not
that it was Jesus. **5.** Jesus saith to them, Children, have you ally
thing to eat?  <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) They answered
him, No. **6.** But he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of
the ship, and you will find. They cast it, therefore; and now they were
not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. **7.** Therefore the
disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It is the Lord. When,
therefore, Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girded his coat
about him, (for he was naked,) and threw himself into the sea. **8.**
And the other disciples carne in the boat, (for they were not far from
land, but about two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
**9.** As soon, then, as they came to land, they saw a fire burning, and
fish laid on it, and bread. **10.** Jesus saith to them, Bring some of
the fish which you have now caught. **11.** Simon Peter, therefore, went
up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and
fifty-three; and although they were so many, the net was not broken.
**12.** Jesus saith to them, Come and dine. And not one of the disciples
dared to ask him, Who art thou? knowing that he was the Lord. **13.**
Jesus therefore cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth it to them, and
fish likewise. **14.** This is now the third time that Jesus manifested
himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.

<span id="xi.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="xi.i-p6"></span><span id="xi.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p7"></span>**1.** *After these things Jesus manifested
himself again.* The Evangelist still labors to prove the resurrection of
Christ, and relates, that he appeared to seven disciples, among whom he
mentions *Thomas,* not out of respect to him, so much as because his
testimony ought to be the more readily believed in proportion to the
obstinacy of his unbelief. The Evangelist enters sufficiently into
detail; for he carefully collects all the circumstances which contribute
to prove the truth of the history. We have formerly mentioned that *the
Lake of Tiberias,* according to the Hebrew custom, is called *the Sea of
Tiberias.*

<span id="xi.i-p8"></span><span id="xi.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p9"></span>**3.** *I am going to fish.* That Peter gave
his attention to *fishing,* ought not to be regarded as inconsistent
with his office. By *breathing on* him, Jesus had ordained him to be an
Apostle, as we saw a little before; but he abstained from the exercise
of the apostleship for a short time, till he should be clothed with new
power. For he had not yet been enjoined to appear in public for the
discharge of his office of teaching, but had only been reminded of his
future calling, that he and the others might understand that they had
not in vain been chosen from the beginning. Meanwhile, they do what they
were accustomed to do, and what belonged to men in private life. It is
true that Paul, in the midst of his employment as a preacher, gained the
support of his life by his own hands, but it was for a different reason;
for his time was so arranged, that the labors of his hands did not
withdraw him from teaching. Peter and his companions, on the other hand,
give themselves up entirely to *fishing,* because they are not hindered
from doing so by any public employment.

<span id="xi.i-p10"></span>*And that night they caught nothing.* God
permitted them to toil to no purpose during the whole *night,* in order
to prove the truth of the miracle; for if they had *caught any thing*
 <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) what followed immediately
afterwards would not have so clearly manifested the power of Christ, but
when, after having toiled ineffectually during the whole night, they are
suddenly favored with a large take of fishes, they have good reason for
acknowledging the goodness of the Lord. In the same manner, also, God
often tries believers, that he may lead them the more highly to value
his blessing. If we were always prosperous, whenever we put our hand to
labor, scarcely any man would attribute to the blessing of God the
success of his exertions, all would boast of their industry, and would
kiss their hands. But when they sometimes labor and torment themselves
without any advantage, if they happen afterwards to succeed better, they
are constrained to acknowledge something out of the ordinary course; and
the consequence is, that they begin to ascribe to the goodness of God
the praise of their prosperity and success.

<span id="xi.i-p12"></span><span id="xi.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p13"></span>**6.** *Cast the net on the right side of the
ship.* Christ does not command with authority and power as *Master* and
*Lord,* but gives advice like one of the people; and the disciples,
being at a loss what to do, readily obey him, though they did not know
who he was. If, before the first *casting of the net,* any thing of this
sort had been said to them, they would not have so quickly obeyed. I
mention this, that no one may wonder that they were so submissive, for
they had already been worn out by long and useless toil. Yet it was no
small proof of patience and perseverance, that, though they had labored
unsuccessfully during the whole night, they continue their toil after
the return of daylight. And, indeed, if we wish to allow an opportunity
for the blessing of God to descend on us, we ought constantly to expect
it; for nothing can be more unreasonable than to withdraw the hand
immediately from labor, if it do not give promise of success.

<span id="xi.i-p14"></span>That *Simon Peter* Was Naked, is a proof that
the disciples had labored in earnest; and yet they do not hesitate to
*cast the net* again to make another trial, that they may not neglect
any opportunity. Their obedience to the command of Christ cannot be
ascribed to faith; for they hear him speak as a person who was unknown
to them. Now, if we dislike our calling, because the labor which we
undertake appears to be unproductive, yet, when the Lord exhorts us to
steadiness and perseverance, we ought to take courage; in the end we
shall obtain a happy result, but it will be at the proper time.

<span id="xi.i-p15"></span>*And now they were not able to draw it*
 <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) Christ here exhibited two
proofs of his Divine power. The first consisted in their taking so large
a draught of fishes; and the second was, when, by his concealed power,
he preserved the *net* whole, which otherwise must unavoidably have been
broken in pieces. Other circumstances are mentioned, namely, that the
disciples find burning coals on the shore, that fishes are laid on them,
and that bread is also prepared. As to the number of *the fishes,* we
ought not to look for any deep mystery in it. Augustine enters into
ingenious reasonings about the statement of the number, and says that it
denotes the Law and the Gospel; but if we examine the matter carefully,
we shall find that this is childish trifling.

<span id="xi.i-p17"></span><span id="xi.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p18"></span>**7.** *Therefore the disciple whom Jesus
loved saith to Peter.* The Evangelist shows, by his example, that it is
our duty to raise our hearts to God, whenever we succeed in any thing
beyond our expectation; because we ought instantly to remember that this
act of kindness has flowed from the favor of Him who is the Author of
every blessing. That holy recognition of the grace of God, which dwelt
in the heart of John, led him also to the knowledge of Christ; for he
does not perceive Christ with his eyes, but, being convinced that the
great multitude of fishes has been brought to him by the hand of God, he
concludes that it was Christ who had guided his hands. But, as John goes
before Peter in faith, so Peter afterwards excels him in zeal, when,
disregarding personal danger, he throws himself into the lake. The rest
follow in the ship. True, all come to Christ at length, but Peter is
actuated by a peculiar zeal in comparison of the others. Whether he
crossed over to the shore by walking or by swimming, is uncertain; but
let us rest satisfied with knowing that the act of leaving the ship and
going on shore was not the result of folly and rashness, but that he
advanced beyond the others in proportion to his zeal.

<span id="xi.i-p19"></span><span id="xi.i-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p20"></span>**10.** *Bring some of the fishes which you
have now caught.* Though the net was filled in a moment, without any
great labor on their part yet the taking of them is not ascribed by
Christ to the disciples, thus, we call the bread which we daily eat, OUR
*bread,* and yet, by asking that it may be *given* to us, we acknowledge
that it proceeds from the blessing of God, (<span
id="xi.i-p20.1"></span>[Mt 6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#011.md)<span
id="xi.i-p20.1"></span>.)

<span id="xi.i-p21"></span><span id="xi.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p22"></span>**12.** *And not one of his disciples dared
to ask him.* It may be inquired, What hindered them? Was it shame
arising from reverence, or was it any thing else? But if Christ saw that
they were in a state of uncertainty, he ought to remove their doubt, as
he had done on many other occasions. I reply, there was no other reason
for shame, but because they were not sufficiently certain that he was
the Christ; for it is not usual with us to inquire about matters that
are doubtful and obscure. The Evangelist, therefore, means that the
disciples *did not ask* Christ, because they were afraid of doing him
wrong; so plain and manifest were the signs by which he had made himself
known to them.

<span id="xi.i-p23"></span><span id="xi.i-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p24"></span>**14.** *The third time.* The number *three*
refers to the distance of time. Christ had already appeared to his
disciples more than *seven* times, but all that had been transacted in
one day is included in one manifestation. The Evangelist, therefore,
means that Christ had been seen by the disciples at intervals, in order
to confirm their belief of his resurrection.

<span id="xi.ii"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xi.ii-p1.1"></span>[John
21:15-19](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#015.md)<span id="xi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p2"></span>**15.** When, therefore, they had dined,
Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon (son) of John, lovest thou me more
than these? He saith to him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.
He saith to him, Feed my lambs. **16.** He saith to him again the second
time, Simon (son) of John, lovest thou me? He saith to him, Yea, Lord,
thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my sheep. **17.**
He saith to him the third time, Simon (son) of John,  <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) lovest thou me? Peter was grieved
because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to
him, Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus
saith to him, Feed my sheep. **18.** Verily, verily, I tell thee, When
thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou
wouldest; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch out thy hands,
and another will gird thee, and will carry thee whither thou wouldest
not. **19.** And this he said, signifying by what death he should
glorify God; and when he had spoken this, he saith to him, Follow me.

<span id="xi.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.ii-p5"></span><span id="xi.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p6"></span>**15.** *When, therefore, they had dined.*
The Evangelist now relates in what manner Peter was restored to that
rank of honor from which he had fallen. That treacherous denial, which
has been formerly described, had, undoubtedly, rendered him unworthy of
the apostleship; for how could he be capable of instructing others in
the faith, who had basely revolted from it? He had been made an Apostle,
but it was along with Judas, and from the time when he had abandoned his
post,  <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) he had likewise been
deprived of the honor of apostle-ship. Now, therefore, the liberty, as
well as the authority, of teaching is restored to him, both of which he
had lost through his own fault. And that the disgrace of his apostacy
might not stand in his way, Christ blots out and destroys the
remembrance of it. Such a restoration was necessary, both for Peter and
for his hearers; for Peter, that he might the more boldly execute his
office, being assured of the calling with which Christ had again
invested him; for his hearers, that the stain which attached to his
person might not be the occasion of despising the Gospel. To us also, in
the present day, it is of very great importance, that Peter comes forth
to us as a new man, from whom the disgrace that might have lessened his
authority has been removed.

<span id="xi.ii-p8"></span>*Simon* (*son*) *of John*  <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) *lovest thou me?* By these words
Christ means that no man can faithfully serve the Church, and employ
himself *in feeding* the flock, if he do not look higher than to men.
First, the office *of feeding*  <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md)
is in itself laborious and troublesome; since nothing is more difficult
than to keep men under the yoke of God, among whom there are many who
are weak, others who are wanton and unsteady, others who are dull and
sluggish, and others who are slow and unteachable. Satan now brings
forward as many causes of offense as he can, that he may destroy or
weaken the courage of a good pastor.  <span
id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) In addition to this, we must take into
account the ingratitude of many and other causes of disgust. No man,
therefore, will steadily persevere in the discharge of this office,
unless the love of Christ shall reign in his heart, in such a manner
that, forgetful of himself and devoting himself entirely to Christ, he
overcomes every obstacle. Thus Paul declares this to have been the state
of his own feelings, when he says,

<span id="xi.ii-p12"></span>The love of Christ constraineth us, judging
thus, that if one died for all,  
then all must have been dead,  
(<span id="xi.ii-p12.3"></span>[2Co
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#014)<span id="xi.ii-p12.3"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.ii-p13"></span>For, though he means that *love* with which
Christ hath *loved* us, and of which he hath given us a proof by his
death, yet he connects with us that mutual *love* which springs from the
conviction of having received so great a blessing. Ungodly and false
teachers, on the other hand, are pointed out by him in another passage
by this mark, that they *do not love the Lord Jesus,* (<span
id="xi.ii-p13.1"></span>[1Co
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022)<span id="xi.ii-p13.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.ii-p14"></span>Those who are called to govern the Church
ought, therefore, to remember that, if they are desirous to discharge
their office properly and faithfully, they must begin with the love of
Christ. Meanwhile, Christ openly testifies how highly he values our
salvation, when he employs such earnest and striking language in
recommending it to *Pastors,* and when he declares that, if the
salvation of their flock be the object of their earnest solicitude, he
will reckon it a proof of the ardor of their love to himself. And,
indeed, nothing could have been spoken that was better fitted for
encouraging the ministers of the Gospel, than to inform them that no
service can be more agreeable to Christ than that which is bestowed on
*feeding his flock.* All believers ought to draw from it no ordinary
consolation, when they are taught that they are so dear and so precious
in the sight of the Son of God, that he substitutes them, as it were, in
his own room. But the same doctrine ought greatly to alarm false
teachers, who corrupt and overturn the government of the Church; for
Christ, who declares that he is insulted by them, will inflict on them
dreadful punishment.

<span id="xi.ii-p15"></span>*Feed my lambs.* The word *feed* is
metaphorically applied by Scripture to any kind of government; but as
the present subject is the spiritual government of the Church, it is of
importance to observe what are the parts of which the office of *pastor*
or *shepherd* consists. No idle rank is here described to us, nor does
Christ bestow on a mortal man any government to be exercised by him in a
confused manner according to his own pleasure. In expounding the Tenth
Chapter, we have seen that Christ is the only *Pastor* or *Shepherd* of
the Church.  <span id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) We have seen also
why he takes this name to himself. If, is, because he *feeds,* that is,
he *governs* his sheep, because he is the only true food of the soul.
But because he employs the agency of men in preaching doctrine, he
conveys to them also his own name, or, at least, shares it with them.
Those men, therefore, are reckoned to be *Pastors* in the sight of God,
who govern the Church by the ministry of the word under Christ, who is
their Head. Hence we may easily infer what is the burden which Christ
lays on Peter, and on what condition he appoints him to govern his
flock.

<span id="xi.ii-p17"></span>This enables us plainly to refute the wicked
adherents of the Church of Rome, who torture this passage to support the
tyranny of their Popery. “To Peter” they tell us, “in preference to
others, it is said, *Feed my sheep* ” We have already explained the
reason why it was said to him rather than to the others; namely, that
being free from every disgraceful stain, he might boldly preach the
Gospel; and the reason why Christ thrice appoints him to be a pastor is,
that the three denials, by which Peter had brought on himself
everlasting shame, may be set aside, and thus may form no barrier to his
apostleship, as has been judiciously observed by Chrysostom, Augustine,
and Cyril, and most of the other Commentators. Besides, nothing was
given to Peter by these words, that is not also given to all the
ministers of the Gospel.

<span id="xi.ii-p18"></span>In vain, therefore, do the Papists maintain
that he holds the highest rank, because he alone is specially addressed;
and, granting that some special honor was conferred on him, how, I ask,
will they prove from this that he has been elevated to the primacy?
Though he were the chief among the apostles, does it thence follow that
he was the universal bishop of the whole world? To this it must be
added, that all that Peter received does not belong to the Pope any more
than to Mahomet; for on what ground does he claim to be Peter’s heir,
and what man of sound understanding will admit that Christ here bestows
on him any hereditary right? Yet he wishes to be reckoned Peter’s
successor: I wish he were so. None of us hinders him from *loving*
Christ, and from taking care to *feed his flock;* but to take no concern
about *loving* Christ, and to throw aside the office of *feeding,* and
then to boast of being Peter’s successor, is excessively foolish and
absurd. Now, as Christ, in assigning to Peter the duty of teaching, did
not intend to erect a throne for an idol or for a murderer of souls,
that by means of it he might miserably oppress the Church, so he stated
in a few words, what kind of government of the Church he approves. This
removes the mask from all the mitred bishops, who, satisfied with a mere
theatrical display and an empty title, claim for themselves the
authority of bishops.

<span id="xi.ii-p19"></span><span id="xi.ii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p20"></span>**16.** *Feed my sheep.* Christ does not
give to Peter and others the office *of feeding* all sorts of persons,
but only *his sheep* or *his lambs.* He elsewhere describes who they are
whom he reckons to belong to his flock.

<span id="xi.ii-p21"></span>My sheep, says he, hear my voice, and follow
me; they hear not the voice of a stranger,  
(<span id="xi.ii-p21.2"></span>[John
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#005.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#027)<span id="xi.ii-p21.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.ii-p22"></span>True, faithful teachers ought to endeavor to
gather all to Christ; and as they cannot distinguish between *sheep* and
wild beasts, they ought to try by all methods if they can tame those who
resemble wolves rather than *sheep.* But after having put forth their
utmost efforts, their labor will be of no avail to any but the elect
*sheep;* for docility and faith arise from this, that the heavenly
Father delivers to his Son, that they may obey him, those whom he
elected before the creation of the world. Again, we are taught by this
passage, that none can *be fed* to salvation by the doctrine of the
Gospel but those who are mild and teachable; for it is not without
reason that Christ compares his disciples to *lambs* and *sheep;* but it
must also be observed, that the Spirit of God tames those who by nature
were bears or lions.

<span id="xi.ii-p23"></span><span id="xi.ii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p24"></span>**17.** *Peter was grieved.* Peter
undoubtedly did not perceive the object which Christ had in view, in
putting the same question so frequently; and therefore he thinks that he
is-in-directly accused, as if he had not answered with sincerity. But we
have already showed that the repetition was not superfluous. Besides,
Peter was not yet sufficiently aware how deeply the love of Christ must
be engraven on the hearts of those who have to struggle against
innumerable difficulties. He afterwards learned by long experience, that
such a trial had not been made in vain. Those who are to undertake the
charge of governing the Church are also taught, in his person, not to
examine themselves slightly, but to make a thorough scrutiny what zeal
they possess, that they may not shrink or faint in the middle of their
course. We are likewise taught, that we ought patiently and mildly to
submit, if at any time the Lord subject us to a severe trial; because he
has good reasons for doing so, though they are generally unknown to us.

<span id="xi.ii-p25"></span><span id="xi.ii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p26"></span>**18.** *Verily, verily, I tell thee.* After
having exhorted Peter *to feed his sheep,* Christ likewise arms him to
maintain the warfare which was approaching. Thus he demands from him not
only faithfulness and diligence, but invincible courage in the midst of
dangers, and firmness in bearing the cross. In short, he bids him be
prepared for enduring death whenever it shall be necessary. Now, though
the condition of all pastors is not alike, still this admonition applies
to all in some degree. The Lord spares many, and abstains from shedding
their blood, satisfied with this alone, that they devote themselves to
him sincerely and unreservedly as long as they live. But as Satan
continually makes new and various attacks, all who undertake the office
of *feeding* must be prepared for death; as they certainly have to do
not only with *sheep,* but also with wolves. So far as relates to Peter,
Christ intended to forewarn him of his death, that he might at all times
ponder the thought, that the doctrine of which he was a minister must be
at length ratified by his own blood. Yet it appears that in these words
Christ did not speak with a view to Peter alone, but that he adorned him
with the honourable title of Martyr in presence of the others; as if he
had said, that Peter would be a very different kind of champion from
what he had formerly shown himself to be.

<span id="xi.ii-p27"></span>*When thou wast younger.* Old age appears to
be set apart for tranquillity and repose; and, accordingly, old men are
usually discharged from public employments, and soldiers are discharged
from service. Peter might, therefore, have promised to himself at that
age a peaceful life. Christ declares, on the other hand, that the order
of nature will be inverted, so that he who had lived at his ease when he
was young will be governed by the will of another when he is old, and
will even endure violent subjection.

<span id="xi.ii-p28"></span>In Peter we have a striking mirror of our
ordinary condition. Many have an easy and agreeable life before Christ
calls them; but as soon as they have made profession of his name, and
have been received as his disciples, or, at least, some time afterwards,
they are led to distressing struggles, to a troublesome life, to great
dangers, and sometimes to death itself. This condition, though hard,
must be patiently endured. Yet the Lord moderates the cross by which he
is pleased to try his servants, so that he spares them a little while,
until their strength has come to maturity; for he knows well their
weakness, and beyond the measure of it he does not press them. Thus he
forbore with Peter, so long as he saw him to be as yet tender and weak.
Let us therefore learn to devote ourselves to him to the latest breath,
provided that he supply us with strength.

<span id="xi.ii-p29"></span>In this respect, we behold in many persons
base ingratitude; for the more gently the Lord deals with us, the more
thoroughly do we habituate ourselves to softness and effeminacy. Thus we
scarcely find one person in a hundred who does not murmur if, after
having experienced long forbearance, he be treated with some measure of
severity. But we ought rather to consider the goodness of God in sparing
us for a time. Thus Christ says that, so long as he dwelt on earth, he
conversed cheerfully with his disciples, as if he had been present at a
marriage, but that fasting and tears afterwards awaited them,  <span
id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) (<span id="xi.ii-p30.2"></span>[Mt
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#015)<span id="xi.ii-p30.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.ii-p31"></span>*Another will gird thee.* Many think that
this denotes the manner of death which Peter was to die,  <span
id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) meaning that he was hanged, with his
arms stretched out; but I consider the word *gird* as simply denoting
all the outward actions by which a man regulates himself and his whole
life. *Thou girdedst thyself;* that is, “thou wast accustomed to wear
such raiment as thou chosest, but this liberty of choosing thy dress
will be taken from thee.” As to the manner in which Peter was put to
death, it is better to remain ignorant of it than to place confidence in
doubtful fables.

<span id="xi.ii-p33"></span>*And will lead thee whither thou wouldst
not.* The meaning is, that Peter did not die a natural death, but by
violence and by the sword. It may be thought strange that Christ should
say that Peter’s death will not be voluntary; for, when one is hurried
unwillingly to death, there is no firmness and none of the praise of
martyrdom. But this must be understood as referring to the contest
between the flesh and the Spirit, which believers feel within
themselves; for we never obey God in a manner so free and unrestrained
as not to be drawn, as it were, by ropes, in an opposite direction, by
the world and the flesh. Hence that complaint of Paul,

<span id="xi.ii-p34"></span>“The good that I would I do not, but the
evil that I would not, that I do,”  
(<span id="xi.ii-p34.2"></span>[Ro
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#019)<span id="xi.ii-p34.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.ii-p35"></span>Besides, it ought to be observed, that the
dread of death is naturally implanted in us, for to wish to be separated
from the body is revolting to nature. Accordingly, Christ, though he was
prepared to obey God with his whole heart, prays that he may be
delivered from death. Moreover, Peter dreaded the cross on account of
the cruelty of men; and, therefore, we need not wonder if, in some
measure, he recoiled from death. But this showed the more clearly the
obedience which he rendered to God, that he would willingly have avoided
death on its own account, and yet he endured it voluntarily, because he
knew that such was the will of God; for if there had not been a struggle
of the mind, there would have been no need of patience.

<span id="xi.ii-p36"></span>This doctrine is highly useful to be known;
for it urges us to prayer, because we would never be able, without
extraordinary assistance from God, to conquer the fear of death; and,
therefore, nothing remains for us but to present ourselves humbly to
God, and to submit to his government. It serves also to sustain our
minds, that they may not altogether faint, if it happen at any time that
persecutions make us tremble. They who imagine that the martyrs were not
moved by any fear make their own fear to yield them a ground of despair.
But there is no reason why our weakness should deter us from following
their example, since they experienced a fear similar to ours, so that
they could not gain a triumph over the enemies of truth but by
contending with themselves.

<span id="xi.ii-p37"></span><span id="xi.ii-p37.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p38"></span>**19.** *Signifying by what death he should
glorify God.* This circumlocution is highly emphatic; for though the end
held out to all believers ought to be, to glorify God both by their life
and by their death, yet John intended to employ a remarkable
commendation for adorning the death of those who, by their blood, seal
the Gospel of Christ and glorify his name, as Paul teaches us, (<span
id="xi.ii-p38.1"></span>[Php 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#020.md)<span
id="xi.ii-p38.1"></span>.) It is now our duty to reap the fruit which
the death of Peter has yielded; for it ought to be imputed to our
indolence, if our faith be not confirmed by it, and if we do not keep
the same object in view, that the glory of God may be displayed by us.
If the Papists had considered this end in the death of the martyrs, that
sacrilegious and detestable invention would never have entered into
their minds, that their death contributes to appease the wrath of God,
and to pay the ransom for our sins.

<span id="xi.ii-p39"></span>*And when he had said this.* Christ here
explains what was the design of that prediction of a violent death. It
was, that Peter might be prepared to endure it; as if he had said,
“Since you must endure death by my example, follow your leader.” Again,
that Peter may the more willingly obey God who calls him to the cross,
Christ offers himself as a leader; for this is not a general exhortation
by which he invites him to imitate himself, but he speaks only of the
kind of death. Now, this single consideration greatly soothes all the
bitterness that is in death, when the Son of God presents himself before
our eyes with his blessed resurrection, which is our triumph over death.

<span id="xi.iii"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p1"></span><span id="xi.iii-p1.1"></span>[John
21:20-25](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#020.md)<span id="xi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p2"></span>**20.** And Peter, turning about, seeth the
disciple following whom Jesus loved, who had also leaned on his breast
at the supper, and had said, Lord, which is he who betrayeth thee?
**21.** When, therefore, Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, and what
shall he do? **22.** Jesus saith to him, If I will that he remain till I
come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. **23.** Then this saying
went forth among the brethren, that that disciple would not die; yet
Jesus had not said to him that he would not die; but, If I will that he
tarry till I come, what is that to thee? **24.** This is the disciple
who testifieth of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that
his testimony is true. **25.** There are also many other things which
Jesus did, which, if they were written every one, I think that even the
world itself would not contain the books that would be written.

<span id="xi.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xi.iii-p4"></span><span id="xi.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p5"></span>**20.** *And Peter, turning about.* We have
in Peter an instance of our curiosity, which is not only superfluous,
but even hurtful, when we are drawn aside from our duty by looking at
others; for it is almost natural to us to examine the way in which other
people live, instead of examining our own, and to attempt to find in
them idle excuses. We willingly deceive ourselves by this semblance of
apology, that other people are no better than we are, as if their
indolence freed us from blame. Scarce one person in a hundred considers
the import of those words of Paul,

<span id="xi.iii-p6"></span>Every man shall bear his own burden, (<span
id="xi.iii-p6.1"></span>[Ga 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#005.md)<span
id="xi.iii-p6.1"></span>.)

<span id="xi.iii-p7"></span>In the person of one man, therefore, there
is a general reproof of all who look around them in every direction, to
see how other men act, and pay no attention to the duties which God has
enjoined on themselves. Above all, they are grievously mistaken in this
respect, that they neglect and overlook what is demanded by every man’s
special calling.

<span id="xi.iii-p8"></span>Out of ten persons it may happen that God
shall choose one, that he may try him by heavy calamities or by vast
labors, and that he shall permit the other nine to remain at ease, or,
at least, shall try them lightly. Besides, God does not treat all in the
same manner, but makes trial of every one as he thinks fit. As there are
various kinds of Christian warfare, let every man learn to keep his own
station, and let us not make inquiries like busybodies about this or
that person, when the heavenly Captain addresses each of us, to whose
authority we ought to be so submissive as to forget every thing else.

<span id="xi.iii-p9"></span>*Whom Jesus loved.* This circumlocution was
inserted, in order to inform us what was the reason why Peter was
induced to put the question which is here related; for he thought it
strange that he alone should be called, and that John should be
overlooked, whom Christ had always loved so warmly. Peter had,
therefore, some apparently good reason for asking why no mention was
made of John, as if Christ’s disposition towards him had undergone a
change. Yet Christ cuts short his curiosity, by telling him that he
ought to obey the calling of God, and that he has no right to inquire
what other people do.

<span id="xi.iii-p10"></span><span id="xi.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p11"></span>**22.** *If I will that he remain.* It has
been customary to take this sentence as detached, and to read the former
clause affirmatively, *I will that he tarry till I come;* but this has
been done through the ignorance of transcribers, not through the mistake
of the translator; for he could not have been mistaken about the Greek
word, but a single letter might easily creep into the Latin version, so
as to alter the whole meaning.  <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md)
The whole sentence, therefore, is a question, and ought to be read in
immediate connection; for Christ intended to put his hand on his
disciple, in order to keep him within the limits of his calling. “It is
no concern of yours,” says he, “and you have no right to inquire what
becomes of your companion; leave that to my disposal; think only about
yourself, and prepare to follow where you are called.” Not that all
anxiety about brethren is uncalled for but it ought to have some limit,
so that it may be anxiety, and not curiosity, that occupies our
attention. Let every man, therefore, look to his neighbours, if by any
means he may succeed in drawing them along with him to Christ, and let
not the offenses of others retard his own progress.

<span id="xi.iii-p13"></span><span id="xi.iii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p14"></span>**23.** *Then this saying went forth.* The
Evangelist relates that, from misunderstanding Christ’s words, an error
arose among the disciples, that John *would never die.* He means those
who were present at that conversation, that is, the Apostles; not that
the name *brethren* belongs to them alone, but that they were the
first-fruits, as it were, of that holy union. It is also possible, that,
besides the eleven, he refers to others who were at that time in company
with them; and by the expression, *went forth,* he means that this error
was spread in all directions; yet probably it was not of long duration,
but subsisted among them, until, being enlightened by the Holy Spirit,
they formed purer and more correct views of the kingdom of Christ,
having laid aside carnal and foolish imaginations.  <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p17"></span>What John relates about the Apostles
happens every day, and we ought not to wonder at it; for if Christ’s
disciples, who belonged to his family and were intimately acquainted
with him, were so egregiously mistaken, how much more are they liable to
fall into mistakes, who have not been so familiarly instructed in the
school of Christ? But let us also observe whence this fault arises. The
teaching of Christ is useful, and for edification; that is, it is plain;
but we obscure the light by our wicked inventions, which we bring to it
from our own views. Christ had not intended to pronounce any thing
certain or definite about John, but only to affirm that he had full
power to decide about his life and death; so that the doctrine is simple
and useful in itself, but the disciples imagine and contrive more than
had been told them. Accordingly, in order that we may be safe from this
danger, let us learn to be wise and to think soberly. But such is the
wantonness of the human understanding, that it rushes with all its force
into foolishness. The consequence was, that this very error, against
which the Evangelist had expressly warned them to be on their guard,
continued notwithstanding to gain currency in the world; for a fable has
been contrived, that he ordered a ditch to be digged for him, and went
down into it, and that next day it was found empty. We see, therefore,
that we shall never cease to err, unless we unreservedly receive what
the Lord hath taught us, and reject all inventions of men.

<span id="xi.iii-p18"></span><span id="xi.iii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p19"></span>**24.** *This is that disciple.* Having
hitherto mentioned himself in the third person, John now declares that
it is himself; that greater weight may be attached to the statements of
one who was an eye-witness, and who had fully known all that he relates.

<span id="xi.iii-p20"></span><span id="xi.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p21"></span>**25.** *There are also many other things
that Jesus did.* Lest any one should view his narrative with suspicion,
as if it had been written through partiality, because *Jesus loved him,*
he anticipates this objection, by saying, that he has passed over more
than he has written. He does not speak of Christ’s actions of every
kind, but of those which relate to his public office; nor ought we to
think that the hyperbole is absurd, when we bear with many figures of
speech of the same kind in heathen authors. Not only ought we to take
into account the number of Christ’s works, but we ought also to consider
their importance and magnitude. The majesty of Christ, which by its
infinity swallowed up, if I may so speak, not only the senses of men,
but heaven and earth, gave a miraculous display of its own splendor in
those works. If the Evangelist, casting his eyes on that brightness,
exclaims in astonishment, that even the whole world could not contain a
full narrative, ought we to wonder at it? Nor is he at all to be blamed,
if he employ a frequent and ordinary figure of speech for commending the
excellence of the works of Christ. For we know how God accommodates
himself to the ordinary’ way of speaking, on account of our ignorance,
and sometimes even, if I may be allowed the expression, stammers.

<span id="xi.iii-p22"></span>Yet we ought to remember what we formerly
stated, that the summary which the Evangelists have committed to
writing, is sufficient both for regulating faith and for obtaining
salvation. That man who has duly profited under such teachers will be
truly wise. And, indeed, since they were appointed by God to be
witnesses to us, as they have faithfully discharged their duty; so it is
our duty, on the other hand, to depend wholly on their testimony, and to
desire nothing more than what they have handed down to us; and
especially, because their pens were guided by the sure providence of
God, that they might not oppress us by an unlimited mass of narratives,
and yet, in making a selection, might make known to us all that God knew
to be necessary for us, who alone is wise, and the only fountain of
wisdom; to whom be praise and glory for ever. Amen.
