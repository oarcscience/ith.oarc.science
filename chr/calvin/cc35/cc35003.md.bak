<span id="iv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 14

<span id="iv.i"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.i-p1.1"></span>[John
14:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p2"></span>**1**. Let not your heart be troubled — you
believe in God, believe also in me. **2**. In my Father’s house are many
dwellings, and if it were not so, I would have told you: I go to prepare
a place for you. **3**. And if I go away and prepare a place for you,
 <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) I will return again, and receive
you to myself; that where I am, you may be also. **4**. And whither I go
you know, and you know the way. **5**. Thomas saith to him, Lord, we
know not whither thou goest, and how can we know the way? **6**. Jesus
saith to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh
to the Father but by me. **7**. If you had known me, you would have
known my Farther also; and henceforth you know him, and have seen him.

<span id="iv.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.i-p5"></span><span id="iv.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p6"></span>**1.** *Let not your heart be troubled.* Not
without good reason does Christ confirm his disciples by so many words,
since a contest so arduous and so terrible awaited them; for it was no
ordinary temptation, that soon afterwards they would see him hanging on
the cross; a spectacle in which nothing was to be seen but ground for
the lowest despair. The season of so great distress being at hand, he
points out the remedy, that they may not be vanquished and overwhelmed;
for he does not simply exhort and encourage them to be steadfast, but
likewise informs them where they must go to obtain courage; that is, by
faith, when he is acknowledged to be the Son of God, who has in himself
a sufficiency of strength for maintaining the safety of his followers.

<span id="iv.i-p7"></span>We ought always to attend to the time when
these words were spoken, that Christ wished his disciples to remain
brave and courageous, when they might think that every thing was in the
greatest confusion; and therefore we ought to employ the same shield for
warding off such assaults. It is impossible for us, indeed, to avoid
feeling various emotions, but though we are shaken, we must not fall
down. Thus it is said of believers, that they *are not troubled*,
because, relying on the word of God, though very great difficulties
press hard upon them, still they remain steadfast and upright.

<span id="iv.i-p8"></span>*You believe in God.* It might also be read in
the imperative mood, *Believe in God*, *and believe in me*; but the
former reading agrees better, and has been more generally received. Here
he points out the method of remaining steadfast, as I have already said;
that is, if our faith rest on Christ, and view him in no other light
than as being present and stretching out his hand to assist us. But it
is wonderful that faith in the Father is here placed first in order, for
he ought rather to have told his disciples that they ought to *believe
in God*, since they had *believed in Christ*; because, as Christ is the
lively image of the Father, so we ought first to cast our eyes on him;
and for this reason, too, he descends to us, that our faith, beginning
with him, may rise to God. But Christ had a different object in view,
for all acknowledge that we ought to *believe in God*, and this is an
admitted principle to which all assent without contradiction; and yet
there is scarce one in a hundred who actually believes it, not only
because the naked majesty of God is at too great a distance from us, but
also because Satan interposes clouds of every description to hinder us
from contemplating God. The consequence is, that our faith, seeking God
in his heavenly glory and inaccessible light, vanishes away; and even
the flesh, of its own accord, suggests a thousand imaginations, to turn
away our eyes from beholding God in a proper manner.

<span id="iv.i-p9"></span>The Son of God, then, who is Jesus Christ,
 <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) holds out himself as the object to
which our faith ought to be directed, and by means of which it will
easily find that on which it can rest; for he is the true Immanuel, who
answers us within, as soon as we seek him by faith. It is one of the
leading articles of our faith, that our faith ought to be directed to
Christ alone, that it may not wander through long windings; and that it
ought to be fixed on him, that it may not waver in the midst of
temptations. And this is the true proof of faith, when we never suffer
ourselves to be torn away from Christ, and from the promises which have
been made to us in him. When Popish divines dispute, or, I should rather
say, chatter, about the object of faith, they mention God only, and pay
no attention to Christ. They who derive their instruction from the
notions of such men, must be shaken by the slightest gale of wind that
blows. Proud men are ashamed of Christ’s humiliation, and, therefore,
they fly to God’s incomprehensible Divinity. But faith will never reach
heaven unless it submit to Christ, who appears to be a low and
contemptible God, and will never be firm if it do not seek a foundation
in the weakness of Christ.

<span id="iv.i-p11"></span><span id="iv.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p12"></span>**2.** *In my Father’s house are many
dwellings.* As the absence of Christ was a cause of grief, he declares
that he does not, go away in such a. manner as to remain separate from
them, since there is room for them also in the heavenly kingdom. For it
was proper that he should remove the suspicion from their minds, that,
when Christ ascended to the Father, he left his disciples on earth
without taking any farther notice of them. This passage has been
erroneously interpreted in another sense, as if Christ taught that’
there are various degrees of honor in the heavenly kingdom; for he says,
that the *mansions* are *many*, not that they are different or unlike,
but that there are enough of them for a great number of persons; as if
he had said, that there is room not only for himself, but also for all
his disciples.

<span id="iv.i-p13"></span>*And if it were not so, I would have told
you.* Here commentators differ. Some read these words as closely
connected with what goes before: “If the dwellings had not been already
prepared, I would have said that I go before you to prepare them.” But I
rather agree with those who render it thus: “If the heavenly glory had
awaited me only, I would not have deceived you. I would have told you
that there was no room for any one but myself in my Father’s house. But
the case is widely different; for I go before, to prepare a place for
you.” The context, in my opinion, demands that we read it in this
manner; for it follows immediately afterwards, *If I go to prepare a
place for you.* By these words Christ intimates that the design of his
departure is, to prepare a place for his disciples. In a word, Christ
did not ascend to heaven in a private capacity, to dwell there alone,
but rather that it might be the common inheritance of all the godly, and
that in this way the Head might be united to his members.

<span id="iv.i-p14"></span>But a question arises, What was the condition
of the fathers after death, before Christ ascended to heaven? For the
conclusion usually drawn is, that believing souls were shut up in an
intermediate state or prison, because Christ says that, by his ascension
into heaven, *the place will be prepared*. But the answer is easy. This
*place* is said to be *prepared* for the day of the resurrection; for by
nature mankind are banished from the kingdom of God, but the Son, who is
the only heir of heaven, took possession of it in their name, that
through him we may be permitted to enter; for in his person we already
possess heaven by hope, as Paul informs us, (<span
id="iv.i-p14.1"></span>[Eph 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.i-p14.1"></span>.) Still we will not enjoy this great blessing,
until he come from heaven the second time. The condition of the fathers
after death, therefore, is not here distinguished from ours; because
Christ has *prepared* both for them and for us a place, into which he
will receive us all at the last day. Before reconciliation had been
made, believing souls were, as it were, placed on a watch-tower, looking
for the promised redemption, and now they enjoy a blessed rest, until
the redemption be finished.

<span id="iv.i-p15"></span><span id="iv.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p16"></span>**3.** *And if I go away.* The conditional
term, *if*, ought to be interpreted as an adverb of time; as if it had
been said, “After that *I have gone away*, *I will return to you
again*.” This *return* must not be understood as referring to the Holy
Spirit, as if Christ had manifested to the disciples some new presence
of himself by the Spirit. It is unquestionably true, that Christ dwells
with us and in us by his Spirit; but here he speaks of the last day of
judgment, when he will, at length, come to assemble his followers. And,
indeed, if we consider the whole body of the Church, he every day
*prepares a place* for us; whence it follows, that the proper time for
our entrance into heaven is not yet come.

<span id="iv.i-p17"></span><span id="iv.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p18"></span>**4.** *And whither I go you know.* As we
need no ordinary fortitude, that we may patiently endure to be so long
separated from Christ, he adds another confirmation, that the disciples
*know* that his death is not a destruction, but a passage to the Father;
and next, that they *know the way* which they must *follow*, that they
may arrive at the participation of the same glory. Both clauses ought to
be carefully observed. First, we must see Christ, by the eyes of faith,
in the heavenly glory and a blessed immortality; and, secondly, we ought
to know that he is the first-fruits of our life, and that *the way*
which was closed against us has been opened by him.

<span id="iv.i-p19"></span><span id="iv.i-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p20"></span>**5.** *Thomas saith to him*. Though, at
first sight, the reply of *Thomas* appears to contradict what Christ had
said, yet he did not intend to give the lie to his Master. But it may be
asked, In what sense does he deny what Christ asserted? I reply, the
knowledge possessed by the saints is sometimes confused, because they do
not understand the manner or the reason of those things which are
certain, and which have been explained to them. For example, the
Prophets foretold the calling of the Gentiles with a true perception of
faith, and yet Paul declares that it was a *mystery hidden* from them,
(<span id="iv.i-p20.1"></span>[Eph.
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#004)<span id="iv.i-p20.1"></span>..md) In
like manner, when the Apostles believed that Christ was departing to the
Father, and yet *did not know* in what way he would obtain the kingdom,
*Thomas* justly replies, that they do *not know whither he is going*.
Hence he concludes that they *know* still less about the way; for before
we enter into a road, we must know where we intend to go.

<span id="iv.i-p21"></span><span id="iv.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p22"></span>**6.** *I am the way.* Though Christ does not
give a direct reply to the question put to him, yet he passes by nothing
that is useful to be known. It was proper that Thomas’ curiosity should
be checked; and, therefore, Christ does not explain what would be his
condition when he should have departed out of this world to go to the
Father,  <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) but dwells on a subject
far more necessary. Thomas would gladly have heard what Christ intended
to do in heaven, as we never become weary of those intricate
speculations; but it is of greater importance to us to employ our study
and labor in another inquiry, how we may become partakers of the blessed
resurrection. The statement amounts to this, that whoever obtains Christ
is ill want of nothing; and, therefore, that whoever is not satisfied
with Christ alone, strives after something beyond absolute perfection.

<span id="iv.i-p24"></span>*The way, the truth, and the life.* He lays
down three degrees, as if he had said, that he is the beginning, and the
middle, and the end; and hence it follows that we ought to begin with
him, to continue in him, and to end in him. We certainly ought not to
seek for higher wisdom than that which leads us to eternal *life,* and
he testifies that this *life* is to be found in him. Now the method of
obtaining *life* is, to become new creatures. He declares, that we ought
not to seek it anywhere else, and, at the same time, reminds us, that
*he is the way*, by which alone we can arrive at it. That he may not
fail us in any respect, he stretches out the hand to those who are going
astray, and stoops so low as to guide sucking infants. Presenting
himself as a leader, he does not leave his people in the middle of the
course, but makes them partakers of *the truth*. At length he makes them
enjoy the fruit of it, which is the most excellent and delightful thing
that can be imagined.

<span id="iv.i-p25"></span>As Christ is *the way*, the weak and ignorant
have no reason to complain that they are forsaken by him; and as he is
*the truth and the life,* he has in himself also what is fitted to
satisfy the most perfect. In short, Christ now affirms, concerning
happiness, what I have lately said concerning the object of faith. All
believe and acknowledge that the happiness of man lies in God alone: but
they afterwards go wrong in this respect, that, seeking God elsewhere
than in Christ, they tear him — so to speak — from his true and solid
Dignity.

<span id="iv.i-p26"></span>*The truth* is supposed by some to denote
here the saving light of heavenly wisdom, and by others to denote the
substance of *life* and of all spiritual blessings, which is contrasted
with shadows and figures; as it is said, *grace and truth came by Jesus
Christ*, (<span id="iv.i-p26.1"></span>[Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017)<span id="iv.i-p26.1"></span>..md) My
opinion is, that *the truth* means here the perfection of faith as *the
way* means its beginning and first elements. The whole may be summed up
thus: “If any man turn aside from Christ, he will do nothing but go
astray; if any man do not rest on him, he will feed elsewhere on nothing
but wind and vanity; if any man, not satisfied with him alone, wishes to
go farther,  <span id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) he will find death
instead of life.”

<span id="iv.i-p28"></span>*No man cometh to the Father.* This is an
explanation of the former statement’, for he is *the way*, because he
leads us *to the Father*, and he is *the truth* and *the life*, because
in him we perceive *the Father*. As to calling on God, it may indeed be
said, with truth, that no prayers are heard but through the intercession
of Christ; but as Christ does not now speak about prayer, we ought
simply to understand the meaning to be, that men contrive for themselves
true labyrinths, whenever, after having forsaken Christ, they attempt
*to come to God*. For Christ proves that he is *the life*, because God,
*with whom is the fountain of life*, (<span id="iv.i-p28.1"></span>[Ps
36:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#009)<span id="iv.i-p28.1"></span>,.md)
cannot be enjoyed in any other way than in Christ. Wherefore all
theology, when separated from Christ, is not only vain and confused, but
is also mad, deceitful, and spurious; for, though the philosophers
sometimes utter excellent sayings, yet they have nothing but what is
short-lived, and even mixed up with wicked and erroneous sentiments.

<span id="iv.i-p29"></span><span id="iv.i-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p30"></span>**7.** *If you had known me.* He confirms
what we have just now said, that it is a foolish and pernicious
curiosity, when men, not satisfied with him, attempt to go to God by
indirect and crooked paths.  <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) They
admit that there is nothing better than the knowledge of God; but when
he is near them, and speaks to them familiarly, they wander through
their own speculations, and seek above the clouds him whom they do not
deign to acknowledge as present. Christ, therefore, blames the disciples
for not acknowledging that the fullness of the Godhead was manifested in
him. “I see,” (says he,) “that hitherto you have not known me in a right
and proper manner, because you do not yet acknowledge the lively image
of the Father which is exhibited in me.”

<span id="iv.i-p32"></span>*And henceforth you know him, and have seen
him.* He adds this, not only to soften the severity of the reproof, but
likewise to accuse them of ingratitude and slothfulness, if they do not
consider and inquire what has been given to them; for he said this
rather for the purpose of commending his doctrine than of extolling
their faith. The meaning therefore is, that God is now plainly exhibited
to them if they would but open their eyes. The word *see* expresses the
certainty of faith.

<span id="iv.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii-p1.1"></span>[John
14:8-14](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p2"></span>**8.** Philip saith to him, Lord, show us the
Father, and it sufficeth us. **9.** Jesus saith to him, Have I been so
long time with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? He who hath seen
me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou, Show us the Father?
**10.** Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in
me? The words which I speak to you I speak not from myself; but my
Father who dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. **11.** Believe me, that
I am in the Father, and the Father in me; but if not, believe me on
account of the works themselves. **12.** Verily, verily, I tell you, He
who believeth in me shall himself also do the works which I do, and
shall do greater works than these, because I go to my Father. **13.**
And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be,
glorified in the Son. **14.** If you shall ask any thing in my name, I
will do it.

<span id="iv.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="iv.ii-p4"></span><span id="iv.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p5"></span>**8.** *Show us the Father.* It appears to be
very absurd that the Apostles should offer so many objections to the
Lord; for why did he speak but to inform them on that point about which
*Philip* puts the question? Yet there is not one of their faults that is
here described that may not be charged on us as well as on them. We
profess to be earnest in seeking God; and when he presents himself
before our eyes, we are blind.

<span id="iv.ii-p6"></span><span id="iv.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p7"></span>**9.** *Have I been so long time with you?*
Christ justly reproves Philip for not having the eyes of his faith pure.
He had God present in Christ, and yet he did not behold him. What
prevented him but his own ingratitude? Thus, in the present day, they
who, in consequence of not being satisfied with Christ alone, are
hurried into foolish speculations, in order to seek God in them, make
little progress in the Gospel. This foolish desire springs from the
meanness of Christ’s low condition; and this is very unreasonable, for
by that humiliation he exhibits the infinite goodness of God.

<span id="iv.ii-p8"></span><span id="iv.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p9"></span>**10.** *That I am in the Father, and the
Father in me.* I do not consider these words to refer to Christ’s Divine
essence, but to the manner of the revelation; for Christ, so far as
regards his hidden Divinity, is not better known to us than *the
Father*. But he is said to be the lively Image, or Portrait, of God,
 <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) because in him God has fully
revealed himself, so far as God’s infinite goodness, wisdom, and power,
are clearly manifested in him. And yet the ancient writers do not take
an erroneous view of this passage, when they quote it as a proof for
defending Christ’s Divinity; but as Christ does not simply inquire what
he is in himself, but what we ought to acknowledge him to be, this
description applies to his power rather than to his essence. *The
Father*, therefore, is said *to be in Christ*, because full Divinity
dwells in him, and displays its power; and Christ, on the other hand, is
said to be in the Father, because by his Divine power he shows that he
is one with *the Father*

<span id="iv.ii-p11"></span>*The words which I speak to you.* He proves
from the effect that we ought not to seek God anywhere else than in him;
for he maintains that his doctrine, being heavenly and truly Divine, is
a proof and bright mirror of the presence of God. If it be objected,
that all the Prophets ought to be accounted sons of God, because they
speak divinely from the inspiration of the Spirit, and because God was
the Author of their doctrine, the answer is easy. We ought to consider
what their doctrine contains; for the Prophets send their disciples to
another person, but Christ attaches them to himself. Besides, we ought
to remember what the apostle declares, that now *God speaketh from
heaven* (<span id="iv.ii-p11.1"></span>[Heb
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025)<span id="iv.ii-p11.1"></span>.md)
by the mouth of his Son, and that, when he spoke by Moses, he spoke, as
it were, from the earth.

<span id="iv.ii-p12"></span>*I do not speak, from myself*; that is, as a
man only, or after the manner of men; because *the Father*, exhibiting
the power of his Spirit in Christ’s doctrine, wishes his Divinity to be
recognized in him.

<span id="iv.ii-p13"></span>This must not be confined to miracles; for
it is rather a continuation of the former statement, that the majesty of
God is clearly exhibited in Christ’s doctrine; as if he had said, that
his doctrine is truly a work of God, from which it may be known with
certainty that God dwelleth in him. By *the works*, therefore, I
understand a proof of the power of God.

<span id="iv.ii-p14"></span>*Believe me that I am in the Father, and the
Father in me.* He first demands from the disciples to give credit to his
testimony, when he asserts that he is the Son of God; but as they had
hitherto been too lazy, he indirectly reproves their indolence. “If my
assertion,” says he, “does not produce conviction, and if you have so
mean an opinion of me, that you do not think that you ought to believe
my words, consider, at least, that power which is a visible image of the
presence of God.” It is very absurd in them, indeed, not to believe,
entirely, the words which proceed from the mouth of the Lord Jesus,
 <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) since they ought to have embraced,
without any hesitation, every thing that he expressed, even by a single
word. But here Christ reproves his disciples for having made so little
progress, though they had received so many admonitions on the same
subject. He does not explain what is the nature of faith, but declares
that he has what is even sufficient for convicting unbelievers.

<span id="iv.ii-p16"></span>The repetition of the words, *I am in the
Father, and the Father in me,* is not superfluous; for we know too well,
by experience, how our nature prompts us to foolish curiosity. As soon
as we have gone out of Christ, we shall have nothing else than the idols
which we have formed, but *in Christ*, there is nothing but what is
divine, and what keeps us *in God*

<span id="iv.ii-p17"></span><span id="iv.ii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p18"></span>**12.** *Verily, verily, I, tell you.* All
that he had hitherto told his disciples about himself, so far as it
regarded them, was temporal; and, therefore, if he had not added this
clause, the consolation would not have been complete; particularly since
our memory is so short, when we are called to consider the gifts of God.
On this subject it is unnecessary to go to others for examples; for,
when God has loaded us with every kind of blessings, if He pause for
fourteen days, we fancy that he is no longer alive. This is the reason
why Christ not only mentions his present power, which the Apostles, at
that time, beheld with their eyes, but promises an uninterrupted
conviction of it for the future. And, indeed, not only was his Divinity
attested, so long as he dwelt on the earth, but after he had gone to the
Father, striking proofs of it were enjoyed by believers. But either our
stupidity or our malice hinders us from perceiving God in his works, and
Christ in the works of God.

<span id="iv.ii-p19"></span>*And shall do greater works than these.*
Many are perplexed by the statement of Christ, that the Apostles *would
do greater works than he had done* I pass by the other answers which
have been usually given to it, and satisfy myself with this single
answer. First, we must understand what Christ means; namely, that the
power by which he proves himself to be the Son of God, is so far from
being confined to his bodily presence, that it must be clearly
demonstrated by many and striking proofs, when he is absent. Now the
ascension of Christ was soon afterwards followed by a wonderful
conversion of the world, in which the Divinity of Christ was more
powerfully displayed than while he dwelt among men. Thus, we see that
the proof of his Divinity was not confined to the person of Christ, but
was diffused through the whole body of the Church.

<span id="iv.ii-p20"></span>*Because I go to the Father.* This is the
reason why the disciples would do greater things than Christ himself. It
is because, when he has entered into the possession of his kingdom, he
will more fully demonstrate his power from heaven. Hence it is evident
that his glory is in no degree diminished, because, after his departure,
the Apostles, who were only his instruments, performed more excellent
works. What is more, in this manner it became evident that he sitteth at
the right hand of the Father, *that every knee may bow before him*,
(<span id="iv.ii-p20.1"></span>[Php
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010)<span id="iv.ii-p20.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.ii-p21"></span><span id="iv.ii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p22"></span>**13.** *And whatever you ask in my name,
that I will do.* By these words He plainly declares that he will be the
Author of all that shall be done by the hands of the Apostles. But it
may be asked, was he not even then the Mediator in whose name men ought
to pray to the Father? I reply, he plainly discharged the office of
Mediator, ever since he entered into the heavenly sanctuary; as we shall
afterwards repeat at the proper place.

<span id="iv.ii-p23"></span>*That the Father may be glorified in the
Son.* This passage agrees with what Paul says,

<span id="iv.ii-p24"></span>That every tongue may confess that Jesus
Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father, (<span
id="iv.ii-p24.1"></span>[Php 2:11](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.ii-p24.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii-p25"></span>The end of all things is the sanctification
of the name of God; but here the true method of sanctifying it is
declared; that is, *in the Son*, and *by the Son*. For, though the
majesty of God be in itself hidden from us, it shines *in Christ*;
though his hand be concealed, we have it visible *in Christ*.
Consequently, in the benefits which the Father bestows upon us, we have
no right to separate *the Father* from *the Son*, according to that
saying,

<span id="iv.ii-p26"></span>He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not
the Father,  
(<span id="iv.ii-p26.2"></span>[Joh
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#023)<span id="iv.ii-p26.2"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.ii-p27"></span><span id="iv.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p28"></span>**14.** *If you shall ask any thing in my
name, I will do it.* This is not a useless repetition. All see and feel
that they are unworthy to approach God; and yet the greater part of men
burst forward, as if they were out of their senses, and rashly and
haughtily address God; and afterwards, when that unworthiness, of which
I have spoken, comes to their recollection, every man contrives for
himself various expedients. On the other hand, when God invites us to
himself, he holds out to us one Mediator only, by whom he is willing to
be appeased and reconciled. But here again the wickedness of the human
mind breaks out for the greater part do not cease to forsake the road,
and to pass through many windings. The reason why they do so is, that
they have but a poor and slender perception of the power and goodness of
God in Christ. To this is added a second error, that we do not consider
that we are justly excluded from approaching God, until he calls us, and
that we are called only through the Son. And if one passage has not
sufficient weight with us, let us know that, when Christ repeats, a
second time, that we must pray to the Father in his name, he lays his
hand on us, as it were, that we may not lose our pains by fruitlessly
seeking other intercessors.

<span id="iv.iii-p2"></span>**15.** If you love me, keep my
commandments. **16.** And I will pray to the Father, and he will give
you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; **17.** The
Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him

and shall be in you. **18.** I will not leave you orphans; I come to

<span id="iv.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii-p6"></span>**15.** *If you love me.* The *love* with
which the disciples *loved* Christ was true and sincere, and yet there
was some superstition mixed with it, as is frequently the case with
ourselves; for it was very foolish in them to wish to keep him in the
world. To correct this fault, he bids them direct their love to another
end; and that is, to employ themselves in *keeping the commandments*
which he had given them. This is undoubtedly a useful doctrine, for of
those who think that they *love* Christ, there are very few who honor
him as they ought to do; but, on the contrary, after having performed
small and trivial services, they give themselves no farther concern. The
true *love* of Christ, on the other hand, is regulated by the
observation of his doctrine as the only rule. But we are likewise
reminded how sinful our affections are, since even the love which we
bear to Christ is not without fault, if it be not directed to a pure
obedience.

<span id="iv.iii-p7"></span><span id="iv.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii-p8"></span>**16.** *And I will pray to the Father.*
This was given as a remedy for soothing the grief which they might feel
on account of Christ’s absence; but at the same time, Christ promises
that he will give them strength *to keep his commandments*; For
otherwise the exhortation would have had little effect. He therefore
loses no time in informing them that, though he be absent from them in
body, yet he will never allow them to remain destitute of assistance;
for he will be present with them by his Spirit.

<span id="iv.iii-p9"></span>Here he calls the Spirit the gift of *the
Father*, but a gift which he will obtain by his prayers; in another
passage he promises that he will give the Spirit. *If I depart*, says
he, *I will send*, *Him to you*, (<span id="iv.iii-p9.1"></span>[Joh
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007)<span id="iv.iii-p9.1"></span>..md)
Both statements are true and correct; for in so far as Christ is our
Mediator and Intercessor, he obtains from *the Father* the grace of the
Spirit, but in so far as he is God, he bestows that grace from himself.
The meaning of this passage therefore is: “I was given to you by *the
Father* to be *a Comforter*, but only for a time; now, having discharged
my office, I will pray to him to give another *Comforter*, who will not
be for a short time, but will remain always with you.”

<span id="iv.iii-p10"></span>*And he will, give you another Comforter.*
The word *Comforter* is here applied both to Christ and to the Spirit,
and justly; for it is an office which belongs equally to both of them,
to *comfort* and exhort us, and to guard us by their protection. Christ
was the Protector of his disciples, so long as he dwelt in the world:
and afterwards he committed them to the protection and guardianship of
the Spirit. It may be asked, are we not still under the protection of
Christ? The answer is easy. Christ is a continual Protector, but not in
a visible way. So long as he dwelt in the world, he openly manifested
himself as their Protector; but now he guards us by his Spirit.

<span id="iv.iii-p11"></span>He calls the Spirit another *Comforter*, on
account of the difference between the blessings which we obtain from
both. The peculiar office of Christ was, to appease the wrath of God by
atoning for the sins of the world, to redeem men from death, to procure
righteousness and life; and the peculiar office of the Spirit is, to
make us partakers not only of Christ himself, but of all his blessings.
And yet there would be no impropriety in inferring from this passage a
distinction of Persons; for there must be some peculiarity in which the
Spirit differs from the Son so as to be *another* than the Son.

<span id="iv.iii-p12"></span><span id="iv.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii-p13"></span>**17.** *The Spirit of truth.* Christ
bestows on the Spirit another title, namely, that he is the Master or
Teacher of truth.  <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md) Hence it
follows, that until we have been inwardly instructed by him, the
understandings of all of us are seized with vanity and falsehood.

<span id="iv.iii-p15"></span>*Whom the world cannot receive.* This
contrast shows the peculiar excellence of that grace which God bestows
on none but his elect; for he means that it is no ordinary gift of which
the world is deprived. In this sense, too, Isaiah says, “*For*, the
darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the people, but the
Lord shall arise on thee, O Jerusalem!”  <span
id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md) For the mercy of God towards the Church
deserves so much the higher praise, when he exalts the Church, by a
distinguished privilege, above the whole world. And yet Christ exhorts
the disciples, that they must not be puffed up, as the world is wont to
be, by carnal views, and thus drive away from themselves the grace of
the Spirit. All that Scripture tells us about the Holy Spirit is
regarded by earthly men as a dream; because, trusting to their own
reason, they despise heavenly illumination. Now, though this pride
abounds everywhere, which extinguishes, so far as lies in our power, the
light of the Holy Spirit; yet, conscious of our own poverty, we ought to
know, that whatever belongs to sound understanding proceeds from no
other source. Yet Christ’s words show that nothing which relates to the
Holy Spirit can be learned by human reason, but that He is known only by
the experience of faith.

<span id="iv.iii-p17"></span>*The world*, he says, *cannot receive the
Spirit*, *because it knoweth him not*; *but you know him*, *because he
dwelleth with you*. It is the Spirit alone therefore, who, by *dwelling
in us*, makes himself to be known by us, for otherwise, he is unknown
and incomprehensible.

<span id="iv.iii-p18"></span><span id="iv.iii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii-p19"></span>**18.** *I will not have you orphans.* This
passage shows what men are, and what they can do, when they have been
deprived of the protection of the Spirit. They are *orphans*, exposed to
every kind of fraud and injustice, incapable of governing themselves,
and, in short, unable of themselves to do any thing. The only remedy for
so great a defect is, if Christ govern us by his Spirit, which he
promises that he will do. First then, the disciples are reminded of
their weakness, that, distrusting themselves, they may rely on nothing
else than the protection of Christ; and, secondly, having promised a
remedy, he gives them good encouragement; for he declares that he will
*never leave them* When he says, *I* *will* *come to you*, he shows in
what manner he dwells in his people, and in what manner he fills all
things. It is, by the power of his Spirit; and hence it is evident, that
the grace of the Spirit is a striking proof of his Divinity.

<span id="iv.iv"></span>

<span id="iv.iv-p1"></span><span id="iv.iv-p1.1"></span>[John
14:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv-p2"></span>**19.** Yet a little while, and the world
shall see me no more; but you see me: because I live, you also shall
live. **20.** At that day you shall know that I am in the Father, and
you in me, and I in you.

<span id="iv.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="iv.iv-p4"></span><span id="iv.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv-p5"></span>**19.** *Yet a little while.* He continues
the commendation of special grace, which ought to have been sufficient
for alleviating, and even for removing the grief of the disciples. “When
I shall have withdrawn,” says he, “from the view of the world: still I
shall be present with you.” That we may enjoy this secret beholding of
Christ, we must not judge of his presence or his absence according to
carnal perception, but we must earnestly employ the eyes of faith for
contemplating his power. Thus believers always have Christ present by
his Spirit, and behold him, though they be distant from him in body.

<span id="iv.iv-p6"></span>*Because I live.* This statement may be
explained in two ways. Either it may be viewed as a confirmation of the
former clause, *because I live*, *and you shall live*; or, it may be
read separately, *because I live*, *you also shall live*; and then the
meaning will be, that believers *will live*, *because Christ liveth* I
willingly embrace the former opinion, and yet we may draw from it the
other doctrine, that the life of Christ is the cause of our life. He
begins by pointing out the cause of the difference, why he shall be
*seen* by his disciples, and *not by the world* It isn’t because Christ
cannot be *seen* but according to the spiritual life, of which the world
is deprived. *The world seeth not* Christ; this is not wonderful, for
the death of blindness is the cause; but as soon as any man begins to
live by the Spirit, he is immediately endued with eyes to see Christ.
Now, the reason of this is, that our life is closely connected with the
life of Christ, and proceeds from it as from its source; for we are dead
in ourselves, and the life with which we flatter ourselves is a very bad
death. Accordingly, when the question is, how we are to obtain life, our
eyes must be directed to Christ, and his life must be conveyed to us by
faith, that our consciences may be fully convinced, that, so long as
Christ lives, we are free from all danger of destruction; for it is an
undoubted truth, that *his life* would be nothing, when his members were
dead.

<span id="iv.iv-p7"></span><span id="iv.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv-p8"></span>**20.** *At that day* Some refer this to *the
day* of Pentecost; but it rather denotes the uninterrupted course, as it
were, of a single day, from the time when Christ exerted the power of
his Spirit till the last resurrection. From that time they began to
*know*, but it was a sort of feeble beginning, because the Spirit had
not yet wrought so powerfully in them. For the object of these words is,
to show that we cannot, by indolent speculation, *know* what is the
sacred and mystical union between us and him, and again, between him and
*the Father*; but that the only way of knowing it is, when he diffuses
his life in us by the secret efficacy of the Spirit; and this is the
trial of faith, which I lately mentioned.

<span id="iv.iv-p9"></span>As to the manner in which this passage was
formerly abused by the Aryans, to prove that Christ is God only by
participation and by grace, it is easy to refute their sophistry. For
Christ does not speak merely of his eternal essence, but of that Divine
power which was manifested in him. As *the Father* has laid up in the
Son all fullness of blessings, so, on the other hand, the Son has
conveyed himself entirely into us. He is said *to be in us*, because he
plainly shows, by the efficacy of his Spirit, that he is the Author and
the cause of our life.

<span id="iv.v-p5"></span><span id="iv.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v-p6"></span>**21.** *He who hath my commandments. He*
again repeats the former statement, that the undoubted proof of our love
to him lies in our *keeping his commandments*; and the reason why he so
frequently reminds the disciples of this is, that they may not turn
aside from this object; for there is nothing to which we are more prone
than to slide into a carnal affection, so as to love something else than
Christ under the name of Christ. Such is also the import of that saying
of Paul,

<span id="iv.v-p7"></span>Though we have known Christ after the flesh,
yet henceforth we know him no longer in this manner. Let us therefore be
a new creature,  
(<span id="iv.v-p7.2"></span>[2 Cor.
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017)<span id="iv.v-p7.2"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.v-p8"></span>*To have his commandments* means to be
properly instructed in them; and *to* keep *his commandments* is to
conform ourselves and our life to their rule.

<span id="iv.v-p9"></span>*And he that loveth me will be loved by my
Father.* Christ speaks as if men loved God before he loved them; which
is absurd, for,

<span id="iv.v-p10"></span>when we were enemies, he reconciled us to
him,  
(<span id="iv.v-p10.2"></span>[Ro
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010)<span id="iv.v-p10.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="iv.v-p11"></span>and the words of John are well known,

<span id="iv.v-p12"></span>Not that we first loved him, but he first
loved us,  
(<span id="iv.v-p12.2"></span>[1Jo
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010)<span id="iv.v-p12.2"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.v-p13"></span>But there is no debate here about cause or
effect; and therefore there is no ground for the inference, that the
love with which we love Christ comes in order before the love which God
has toward us; for Christ meant only, that all who *love him* will be
happy, because they will also *be loved by him and by the Father*; not
that God then begins to *love* them, but because they have a testimony
of his love to them, as a Father, engraven on their hearts. To the same
purpose is the clause which immediately follows: —

<span id="iv.v-p14"></span>*And I will manifest myself to him.*
Knowledge undoubtedly goes before love; but Christ’s meaning was, I will
grant to those who purely observe my doctrine, that they shall make
progress from day to day in faith; “that is, “I will cause them to
approach more nearly and more familiarly to *me*.” Hence infer, that the
fruit of piety is progress in the knowledge of Christ; for he who
promises that he will give himself to him who has it rejects hypocrites,
and causes all to make progress in faith who, cordially embracing the
doctrine of the Gospel, bring themselves entirely into obedience to it.
And this is the reason why many fall back, and why we scarcely see one
in ten proceed in the right course; for the greater part do not deserve
that he should *manifest himself to them* It ought also to be observed,
that a more abundant knowledge of Christ is here represented as an
extraordinary reward of our love to Christ; and hence it follows that it
is an invaluable treasure.

<span id="iv.v-p15"></span><span id="iv.v-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v-p16"></span>**22.** *Judas* (*not Iscariot*) *saith to
him.* It is not without reason that he asks why Christ does not cause
his light to be imparted  <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) to more
than a few persons; since he is *the Sun of Righteousness*, (<span
id="iv.v-p17.2"></span>[Mal 4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.v-p17.2"></span>) by whom the whole world ought to be
enlightened; and, therefore, it is unreasonable that he should enlighten
but a few, and not shed his light everywhere without distinction.
Christ’s reply does not solve the whole question; for it makes no
mention of the first cause, why Christ ‘*manifested himself to* a few,’
conceals himself from the greater part of men; for certainly he finds
all men at first alike, that is, entirely alienated from him; and,
therefore, he cannot choose any person who loves him, but he chooses
from among his enemies those whose hearts he bends to the love of him.
But he did not intend, at present, to take any notice of that
distinction, which was far from the object he had in view. His design
was, to exhort his disciples to the earnest study of godliness, that
they might make greater progress in faith; and, therefore, he is
satisfied with distinguishing them from the world by this mark, that
they keep the doctrine of the Gospel.

<span id="iv.v-p18"></span>Now, this mark comes after the commencement
of faith, for it is the effect of their calling. In other passages,
Christ had reminded the disciples of their being called by free grace,
and he will afterwards bring it to their recollection. At present, he
only enjoins them to observe his doctrine, and to maintain godliness. By
these words, Christ shows in what manner the Gospel is properly obeyed.
It is, when our services and outward actions proceed from the love of
Christ; for in vain do the arms, and the feet, and the whole body toil,
if the love of God does not reign in the heart, to govern the outward
members. Now, since it is certain that we *keep the commandments* of
Christ only in so far as we *love* him, it follows that a perfect *love*
of him can nowhere be found in the world, because there is no man who
*keeps his commandments* perfectly; yet God is pleased with the
obedience of those who sincerely aim at this end.

<span id="iv.v-p19"></span><span id="iv.v-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v-p20"></span>**23.** *And my Father will love him.* We
have already explained that the love of God to us is not placed in the
second rank, as if it came after our piety as the cause of that love,
but that believers may be fully convinced that the obedience which they
render to the Gospel is pleasing to God, and that they may continually
expect from him fresh additions of gifts.

<span id="iv.v-p21"></span>*And we will come to him who loveth me;* that
is, he will feel that the grace of God dwelleth in him, and will every
day receive additions to the gifts of God. He therefore speaks, not of
that eternal love with which he loved us, before we were born, and even
before the world was created, but since the time when he seals it on our
hearts by making us partakers of his adoption. Nor does he even mean the
first illumination, but those degrees of faith by which believers must
continually advance, according to that saying,

<span id="iv.v-p22"></span>Whosoever hath it shall be given to him,
(<span id="iv.v-p22.1"></span>[Mt
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012)<span id="iv.v-p22.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.v-p23"></span>The Papists; therefore are wrong in inferring
from this passage that there are two kinds of love with which we love
God. They falsely maintain that we naturally love God, before he
regenerates us by his Spirit, and even that by this preparation we merit
the grace of regeneration; as if Scripture did not everywhere teach, and
as if experience also did not loudly proclaim, that we are altogether
alienated from God, and that we are infected and filled with hatred of
him, until he change our hearts. We must therefore keep in view the
design of Christ, that he *and the Father will come*, to confirm
believers, in uninterrupted confidence in his grace.

<span id="iv.v-p24"></span><span id="iv.v-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v-p25"></span>**24.** *He who loveth, me but keepeth not my
words.* As believers are mixed with unbelievers in the world, and as
they must be agitated by various storms, as in a troubled sea, Christ
again confirms them by this admonition, that they may not be drawn away
by bad examples. As if he had said, “Do not look upon the world so as to
depend on it; for there will always be some who despise me and my
doctrine; but as for you, preserve constantly to the end the grace which
you have once received.” Yet he likewise intimates that the world is
justly punished for its ingratitude, when it perishes in its blindness,
since, by despising true righteousness, it manifests a wicked hatred
towards Christ.

<span id="iv.v-p26"></span>*And the word which you hear.* That the
disciples may not be discouraged or waver on account of the obstinacy of
the world, he again procures credit to his doctrine, by testifying that
it is from God, and that it was not contrived by men on the earth. And,
indeed, the strength of our faith consists in our knowing that God is
our leader, and that we are founded on nothing else than his eternal
truth. Whatever then may be the rage and madness of the world, let us
follow the doctrine of Christ, which rises far above heaven and earth.
When he says that *the word is not his*, he accommodates himself to the
disciples; as if he had said that it is not human, because he teaches
faithfully what has been enjoined on him by the Father. Yet we know
that, in so far as he is the eternal Wisdom of God, he is the only
fountain of all doctrine, and that all the prophets who have been from
the beginning spoke by his Spirit.

send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will bring to your
remembrance all things that I have said to you. **27.** Peace I leave
with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world giveth, give I it to
you.  <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) Let not your heart be
troubled, and let it not be afraid. **28.** You heard that I said to
you, I go away, and come to you. If you loved me, you would certainly
rejoice that I said, I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than
I.

<span id="iv.vi-p5"></span> 

<span id="iv.vi-p6"></span><span id="iv.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi-p7"></span>**25.** *These things I have spoken to you.*
He adds this, that they may not despair, though they may have profited
less than they ought to have done; for at that time he scattered a seed
of doctrine, which lay hidden, and, as it were, suffocated in the
disciples. He therefore exhorts them to entertain good hopes, until
fruit be yielded by the doctrine which might now appear to be useless.
In short, he testifies that in the doctrine which they had heard they
have abundant ground of consolation, and that they ought not to seek it
anywhere else. And if they do not immediately see it, he bids them be of
good courage, until the Holy Spirit, who is the inward Teacher, speak
the same thing in their hearts. This admonition is highly useful to all;
for, if we do not immediately understand what Christ teaches, we begin
to grow weary, and grudge to bestow unprofitable labor on what is
obscure. But we must bring an eager desire to receive instruction; we
must lend our ears and give attention, if we desire to make due
proficiency in the school of God; and especially we need patience, until
the Holy Spirit enable us to understand what we thought that we had
often read or heard to no purpose. That the desire of learning may not
be weakened in us, or that we may not fall into despair, when we do not
immediately perceive the meaning of Christ speaking to us, let us know
that this is spoken to us all.

<span id="iv.vi-p8"></span>*The Holy Spirit will bring to your
remembrance all things that I have said to you.* It is indeed a
punishment threatened by Isaiah against unbelievers, that the Word of
God shall be to them *as a book that is sealed*, (<span
id="iv.vi-p8.1"></span>[Isa 29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.vi-p8.1"></span>) but in this manner, also, the Lord frequently
humbles his people. We ought, therefore, to wait patiently and mildly
for the time of revelation, and must not, on that account, reject the
word. When Christ testifies that it is the peculiar office of the Holy
Spirit to teach the apostles what they had already learned from his
mouth, it follows that the outward preaching will be vain and useless,
if it be not accompanied by the teaching of the Spirit. God has
therefore two ways of teaching; for, *first*, he sounds in our ears by
the mouth of men; and, *secondly*, he addresses us inwardly by his
Spirit; and he does this either at the same moment, or at different
times, as he thinks fit.

<span id="iv.vi-p9"></span>But observe what are *all these things* which
he promises that the Spirit will teach. *He will suggest*, he says, *or
bring to your remembrance*, *all that I have said*. Hence it follows,
that he will not be a builder of new revelations. By this single word we
may refute all the inventions which Satan has brought into the Church
from the beginning, under the pretense of the Spirit. Mahomet and the
Pope agree in holding this as a principle of their religion, that
Scripture does not contain a perfection of doctrine, but that something
loftier has been revealed by the Spirit. From the same point the
Anabaptists and Libertines, in our own time, have drawn their absurd
notions. But the spirit that introduces any doctrine or invention apart
from the Gospel is a deceiving spirit, and not the Spirit of Christ.
What is meant by *the Spirit being sent by the Father in the name of
Christ*, I have already explained.

<span id="iv.vi-p10"></span><span id="iv.vi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi-p11"></span>**27.** *Peace I leave with you.* By the
word *peace* he means prosperity, which men are wont to wish for each
other when they meet or part; for such is the import of the word *peace*
in the Hebrew language. He therefore alludes to the ordinary custom of
his nation; as if he had said, *I give you my Farewell* But he
immediately adds, that this *peace* is of far greater value than that
which is usually to be found among men, who generally have the word
*peace* but coldly in their mouth, by way of ceremony, or, if they
sincerely wish *peace* for any one, yet cannot actually bestow it. But
Christ reminds them that *his peace* does not consist in an empty and
unavailing wish, but is accompanied by the effect. In short, he says
that he goes away from them in body, but that *his peace* remains with
the disciples; that is, that they will be always happy through his
blessing.

<span id="iv.vi-p12"></span>*Let not your heart be troubled.* He again
corrects the alarm which the disciples had felt on account of his
departure. It is no ground for alarm, he tells them; for they want only
his bodily presence, but will enjoy his actual presence through the
Spirit. Let us learn to be always satisfied with this kind of presence,
and let us not give a loose reign to the flesh, which always binds God
by its outward inventions.

<span id="iv.vi-p13"></span><span id="iv.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi-p14"></span>**28.** *If you loved me you would rejoice.*
The disciples unquestionably *loved* Christ, but not as they ought to
have done; for some carnal affection was mixed with their *love*, so
that they could not endure to be separated from him; but if they had
*loved* him spiritually, there was nothing which they would have had
more deeply at heart, than his return to the Father.

<span id="iv.vi-p15"></span>*For the Father is greater than I.* This
passage has been tortured in various ways. The Aryans, in order to prove
that Christ is some sort of inferior God, argued that *he is less than
the Father* The orthodox Fathers, to remove all ground for such a
calumny, said that this must have referred to his human nature; but as
the Aryans wickedly abused this testimony, so the reply given by the
Fathers to their objection was neither correct nor appropriate; for
Christ does not now speak either of his human nature, or of his eternal
Divinity, but, accommodating himself to our weakness, places himself
between God and us; and, indeed, as it has not been granted to us to
reach the height of God, Christ descended to us, that he might raise us
to it. *You ought to have rejoiced*, he says, *because I return to the
Father*; for this is the ultimate object at which you ought to aim. By
these words he does not show in what respect he differs in himself from
the Father, but why he descended to us; and that was that he might unite
us to God; for until we have reached that point, we are, as it were, in
the middle of the course. We too imagine to ourselves but a half-Christ,
and a mutilated Christ, if he do not lead us to God.

<span id="iv.vi-p16"></span>There is a similar passage in the writings
of Paul, where he says that Christ

<span id="iv.vi-p17"></span>will deliver up the Kingdom to God his
Father, that God may be all in all,  
(<span id="iv.vi-p17.2"></span>[1Co
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#024)<span id="iv.vi-p17.2"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.vi-p18"></span>Christ certainly reigns, not only in human
nature, but as he is God manifested in the flesh. In what manner,
therefore, will he lay aside the kingdom? It is, because the Divinity
which is now beheld in Christ’s face alone, will then be openly visible
in him. The only point of difference is, that Paul there describes the
highest perfection of the Divine brightness, the rays of which began to
shine from the time when Christ ascended to heaven. To make the matter
more clear, we must use still greater plainness of speech. Christ does
not here make a comparison between the Divinity of the Father and his
own, nor between his own human nature and the Divine essence of the
Father, but rather between his present state and the heavenly glory, to
which he would soon afterwards be received; as if he had said, “You wish
to detain me in the world, but it is better that I should ascend to
heaven.” Let us therefore learn to behold Christ humbled in the flesh,
so that he may conduct us to the fountain of a blessed immortality; for
he was not appointed to be our guide, merely to raise us to the sphere
of the moon or of the sun, but to make us one with God the Father.

<span id="iv.vii"></span>

<span id="iv.vii-p1"></span><span id="iv.vii-p1.1"></span>[John
14:29-31](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#029.md)<span id="iv.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii-p2"></span>**29.** And I have told you now, before it
take place, that, when it shall take place, you may believe. **30.**
Henceforth I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world
cometh, and hath nothing in me. **31.** But that the world may know that
I love the Father, and that I do as the Father hath commanded me. Arise,
let us go hence.

<span id="iv.vii-p3"></span> 

<span id="iv.vii-p4"></span><span id="iv.vii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii-p5"></span>**29.** *And I have told you now.* It was
proper that the disciples should be frequently admonished on this point;
for it was a secret far exceeding all human capacity. He testifies that
he *foretells what shall happen*, *that*, *when it has happened*, *they
may believe*; for it was a useful confirmation of their faith when they
brought to recollection the predictions of Christ, and saw accomplished
before their eyes what they had formerly heard from his mouth. Yet it
appears to be a sort of concession, as if Christ had said, “Because you
are not yet capable of comprehending so deep a mystery, I bear with you
till the event has happened, which will serve as an interpreter to
explain this doctrine.” Although for a time he seemed to speak to the
deaf, yet it afterwards appeared that his words were not scattered in
vain, or, as we may say, in the air, but that it was a seed thrown into
the earth. Now, as Christ speaks here about his word and the
accomplishment of events, so his death, and resurrection, and ascension
to heaven, are combined with doctrine, that they may produce faith in
us.

<span id="iv.vii-p6"></span><span id="iv.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii-p7"></span>**30.** *Henceforth I will not talk much
with you.* By this word he intended to fix the attention of the
disciples on himself, and to impress his doctrine more deeply on their
minds; for abundance generally takes away the appetite, and we desire
more eagerly what we have not in our possession, and delight more in the
enjoyment of that which is speedily to be taken from us. In order,
therefore, to make them more desirous of hearing his doctrines, he
threatens that he will very soon go away. Although Christ does not cease
to teach us during the whole course of our life, yet this statement may
be applied to our use; for, since the course of our life is short, we
ought to embrace the present opportunity.

<span id="iv.vii-p8"></span>*For the prince of this world cometh* He
might have said, in direct language, that he would soon die, and that
the hour of his death was at hand; but he makes use of a circumlocution,
to fortify their minds beforehand, lest, terrified by a kind of death so
hideous and detestable, they should faint; for to believe in him
crucified, what is it but to seek life in hell? First, he says that his
power will be given to Satan; and next he adds, That he will go away,
not because he is compelled to do so, but in order to obey the Father.

<span id="iv.vii-p9"></span>The devil is called *the prince of this
world,* not because he has a kingdom separated from God, (as the
Manicheans imagined,) but because, by God’s permission, he exercises his
tyranny over the world. Whenever, therefore, we hear this designation
applied to the devil, let us be ashamed of our miserable condition; for,
whatever may be the pride of men, they are the slaves of the devil, till
they are regenerated by the Spirit of Christ; for under the term *world*
is here included the whole human race. There is but one Deliverer who
frees and rescues us from this dreadful slavery. Now, since this
punishment was inflicted on account of the sin of the first man, and
since it daily grows worse on account of new sins, let us learn to hate
both ourselves and our sins. While we are held captives under the
dominion of Satan, still this slavery does not free us from blame, for
it is voluntary. It ought also to be observed, that what is done by
wicked men is here ascribed to the devil; for, since they are impelled
by Satan, all that they do is justly reckoned his work.

<span id="iv.vii-p10"></span>*And hath nothing in me.*  <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) It is in consequence of the sin of Adam
that Satan holds the dominion of death, and, therefore, he could not
touch Christ, who is pure from all the pollution of sin, if he had not
voluntarily subjected himself. And yet I think that these words have a
wider meaning than that in which they are usually explained; for the
ordinary interpretation is, “Satan hath found nothing in Christ, for
there is nothing in him that deserves death, because he is pure from
every stain of sin.” But, in my opinion, Christ asserts here not only
his own purity, but likewise his Divine power, which was not subject to
death; for it was proper to assure the disciples that he did not yield
through weakness, lest they should think less highly of his power. But
in this general statement the former is also included, that, in enduring
death, he was not compelled by Satan. Hence we infer, that he was
substituted in our room, when he submitted to death.

<span id="iv.vii-p12"></span><span id="iv.vii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii-p13"></span>**31.** *But that the world may know.* Some
think that these words should be read as closely connected with the
words, *Arise*, *let us go hence*, so as to make the sense complete.
Others read the former part of the verse separately, and suppose that it
breaks off abruptly. As it makes no great difference in regard to the
meaning, I leave it to the reader to give a preference to either of
these views. What chiefly deserves our attention is, that the decree of
God is here placed in the highest rank; that we may not suppose that
Christ was dragged to death by the violence of Satan, in such a manner
that anything happened contrary to the purpose of God. It was God who
appointed his Son to be the Propitiation, and who determined that the
sins of the world should be expiated by his death. In order to
accomplish this, he permitted Satan, for a short time, to treat him with
scorn; as if he had gained a victory over him. Christ, therefore, does
not resist Satan, in order that he may obey the decree of his Father,
and may thus offer his obedience as the ransom of our righteousness.

<span id="iv.vii-p14"></span>*Arise, let us go hence.* Some think that
Christ, after he said these things, changed his place, and that what
follows was spoken by him on the road; but as John afterwards adds, that
Christ went away with his disciples beyond the brook Kedron,  <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) it appears more probable that Christ
intended to exhort the disciples to render the same obedience to God, of
which they beheld in him so illustrious an example, and not that he led
them away at that moment.
