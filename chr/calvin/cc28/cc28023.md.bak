<span id="vi.i"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p1"></span>A Translation of Calvin’s Version of

<span id="vi.i-p2"></span>The Book of Jonah.

<span id="vi.i.i"></span>

<span id="vi.i.i-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.i-p2"></span>Chapter 1

<span id="vi.i.i-p3"></span>**1** And the word of Jehovah came to Jonah
the son of Amittai, saying,

<span id="vi.i.i-p4"></span>**2** “Arise, go to Nineveh, to that great
city, and cry against it; for their wickedness has ascended before my
face.”

<span id="vi.i.i-p5"></span>**3** But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish
from the presence of Jehovah, and went down to Joppa, and found a ship,
which was going to Tarshish; and he paid the fare, and went down into
it,, that he might go with them to Tarshish from the presence of
Jehovah.

<span id="vi.i.i-p6"></span>**4** And Jehovah sent a strong wind on the
sea, and a great tempset arose in the sea, and the ship was thought to
be breaking:

<span id="vi.i.i-p7"></span>**5** And the mariners feared, and cried
every one to his god, and cast out the wares, which were in the ship,
into the sea, that it might be lightened of them; but Jonah had gone
down to the sides of the ship; and he lay down and slept.

<span id="vi.i.i-p8"></span>**6** And the pilot came to him, and he said
to him, — “What meanest thou, O sleeper? Arise, call on thy God, if so
be that God will show himself propitious to us, that we may not perish.”

<span id="vi.i.i-p9"></span>**7** And they said each to his friend, —
“Come and let us cast lots, that we may know for what cause *is* this
evil *come* upon us.” And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

<span id="vi.i.i-p10"></span>**8** And they said to him, — “Tell us now
why has this evil happened to us, what is thy work, and whence comest
thou, what is thy country, and from what people art thou?”

<span id="vi.i.i-p11"></span>**9** And he said to them, — “I am an
Hebrew, and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the
dry *land*.”

<span id="vi.i.i-p12"></span>**10** And the men feared with great fear,
and said to him, — “Why hast thou done this?” (**52**) For the men knew
that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told
them.

<span id="vi.i.i-p13"></span>**11** And they said to him, “What shall we
do to thee, that the sea may be still to us?” for the sea was going and
was tempestuous.

<span id="vi.i.i-p14"></span>**12** And he said to them, — “Take me and
cast me into the sea, and the sea will be still to you; for I know that
on my account is this great tempest come upon you.”

<span id="vi.i.i-p15"></span>**13** But the men toiled to bring back the
ship, (**59**) and they could not; for the sea was going and was
tempestuous against them.

<span id="vi.i.i-p16"></span>**14** And they cried to Jehovah, and said,
— “We beseech, Jehovah, we pray, that we perish not for the life of this
man, and lay not on us innocent blood; for thou, Jehovah, hast done as
it has seemed good to thee.” (**62**)

<span id="vi.i.i-p17"></span>**15** Then they took Jonah, and cast him
into the sea; and the sea stopped from its raging.

<span id="vi.i.i-p18"></span>**16** And with great fear, the men feared
Jehovah, and sacrificed a sacrifice to Jehovah, and vowed vows.

<span id="vi.i.i-p19"></span>**17** And Jehovah provided a great fish to
swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the bowels of the fish three days and
three nights.

<span id="vi.i.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.i.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.ii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="vi.i.ii-p3"></span>**1** And Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God
from the belly of the fish,

<span id="vi.i.ii-p4"></span>**2** And said, — I cried in my distress to
Jehovah, and he heard me; (**75**) From the belly of the grave I cried,
thou didst hear my voice.

<span id="vi.i.ii-p5"></span>**3** But cast me hadst thou into the deep,
Into the midst of the seas, and the flood surrounded me; All thy billows
and waves over me passed:

<span id="vi.i.ii-p6"></span>**4** Then I said, — “I am driven from the
sight of thine eyes; But I would again see the temple of thy holiness.”

<span id="vi.i.ii-p7"></span>**5** Beset me did the waters even to the
soul, The deep on every side surrounded me, The sedge was wrapped around
my head:

<span id="vi.i.ii-p8"></span>**6** To the roots of the mountains I
descended, The earth with its bars was around me forever: But to ascend
hast thou made my life from the grave, O Jehovah my God.

<span id="vi.i.ii-p9"></span>**7** When fail did my soul within me,
Jehovah did I remember, And enter did my prayer into the temple of thy
holiness.

<span id="vi.i.ii-p10"></span>**8** They who observe lying vanities,
Their own mercy forsake: (**87**)

<span id="vi.i.ii-p11"></span>**9** But I, with the voice of praise,
will sacrifice to thee; What I have vowed will I pay: To Jehovah
*belongs* salvation.

<span id="vi.i.ii-p12"></span>**10** And Jehovah commanded the fish, and
it cast forth Jonah on the dry land.

<span id="vi.i.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.i.iii-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.iii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="vi.i.iii-p3"></span>**1** And the word of Jehovah came to
Jonah the second time, saying, —

<span id="vi.i.iii-p4"></span>**2** “Arise, go to Nineveh, to that great
city, and proclaim to it the proclamation which I command thee.”
(**92**)

<span id="vi.i.iii-p5"></span>**3** And Jonah arose, and went to
Nineveh, according to the command of Jehovah.

<span id="vi.i.iii-p6"></span>**4** Now Nineveh was a very great city, a
journey of three days. And Jonah began to enter a journey of one day,
and cried and said, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.”

<span id="vi.i.iii-p7"></span>**5** And the men of Nineveh believed God,
and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them
even to the least of them:

<span id="vi.i.iii-p8"></span>**6** For word had come to the king of
Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and cast aside his splendid robe
from him, and put on sackcloth and sat on ashes;

<span id="vi.i.iii-p9"></span>**7** And it was proclaimed and published
through Nineveh, by the counsel of the king and his nobles, saying, —
“Man and beast! Ox and sheep! Let them taste nothing, let them not be
fed, and let them not drink water;

<span id="vi.i.iii-p10"></span>**8** And let man and beast put on
sackcloth, and cry to God mightily; (**107**) and return let every one
from his evil way, and from the plunder that is in their hands.

<span id="vi.i.iii-p11"></span>**9** Who knows, whether God will change
and repent, and turn away from the fury of his wrath, that we perish
not?”

<span id="vi.i.iii-p12"></span>**10** And God saw their works, that they
turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he had
declared that he would do to them, and did *it* not.

<span id="vi.i.iv"></span>

<span id="vi.i.iv-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.i.iv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="vi.i.iv-p3"></span>**1** And Jonah was grievously displeased,
and he was very angry; (**116**) and he prayed to Jehovah, and said, —

<span id="vi.i.iv-p4"></span>**2** “I pray thee, Jehovah, was not this
my word, when I was yet in my own land? I therefore hastened to flee to
Tarshish; for I knew that thou are a God full of grace, and merciful,
slow to wrath, great in kindness, and who repentest of evil.

<span id="vi.i.iv-p5"></span>**3** And thou, Jehovah, take, I pray, my
life from me; for better it is for me to die than to live.”

<span id="vi.i.iv-p6"></span>**4** And Jehovah said to him, — “Doest
thou well in being angry?” (**129**)

<span id="vi.i.iv-p7"></span>**5** And Jonah went out of the city, and
sat on the east over against the city, and made there for himself a
tent, and sat under it in the shade, until he saw what might be in the
city.

<span id="vi.i.iv-p8"></span>**6** And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and
made it to come up for Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head,
and free him from his distress; and Jonah rejoiced for the gourd with
great joy.

<span id="vi.i.iv-p9"></span>**7** God also prepared a worm, when the
morning rose the next day, which smote the gourd, and it withered:

<span id="vi.i.iv-p10"></span>**8** And it was, when the sun arose, that
God prepared an impetuous wind, and the sun smote the head of Jonah, and
he fainted, and wished for himself that he might die, and said, “Better
is my death than my life.”

<span id="vi.i.iv-p11"></span>**9** And God said to Jonah, — “Doest thou
well in being angry for the gourd?” and he said, — “I do well in being
angry even unto death.”

<span id="vi.i.iv-p12"></span>**10** And Jehovah said, — “Thou wouldest
have spared the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, and which thou
has not raised up; the daughter of a night it was,  <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) and *as* the daughter of a night it
has passed away;

<span id="vi.i.iv-p14"></span>**11** And should I not spare Nineveh,
this great city, in which there are twelve times ten thousand men, every
one of whom knows not his right hand from his left, and also many
animals?”
