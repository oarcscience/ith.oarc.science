<span id="iv.i-p1"></span>Calvin’s Preface to Micah

<span id="iv.i-p2"></span>Among the Minor Prophets, Micah comes next,
who is commonly called Micaiah.  <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56)
But he was the second, as they say, of this name; for the first was the
Micaiah who had a contest with the wicked king Ahab; and he then
exercised his Prophetic office. But the second was in the same age with
Isaiah, perhaps a little later: at least Isaiah had been performing his
office some years before Micah had been called. It appears then that he
was added to Isaiah, that he might confirm his doctrine; for that holy
man had to do with ungodly men, with men of a hardened neck, yea, and so
wicked, that they were wholly irreclaimable. That their doctrine
therefore might be more entitled to credit, it pleased God that Isaiah
and Micah should deliver their message at the same time, as it were,
with one mouth, and avow their consent, that all the disobedient might
be proved guilty.

<span id="iv.i-p4"></span>But I will now come to his words: for the
contents of this Book suggest what is useful for our instruction.  <span

<span id="iv.i-p3"></span> The confusion of the name has been through
the Septuagint, in which *Michaiah,* the son of Imlah, about a hundred
years before, is rendered <span id="iv.i-p3.1"></span>Μιχαιας, as well
as this Prophet. The son of Imlah in Hebrew is <span
id="iv.i-p3.2"></span>מיכיה, while our Prophet is <span
id="iv.i-p3.3"></span>מיכה. — *Ed.*

<span id="iv.i-p5"></span> “This Book,” says *Henderson,* “may be
divided into two parts; the first consisting of chapters 1-5; and the
second, the two remaining chapters, which are more general and didactic
in their character.”
