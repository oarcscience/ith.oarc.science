<span id="iii.i-p1"></span>Preface by the Author

<span id="iii.i-p2"></span>At what time Jonah discharged the office of a
Teacher, we may in some measure learn from <span
id="iii.i-p2.1"></span>[2Ki 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#001)<span
id="iii.i-p2.1"></span> for it is certain that he is the person there
mentioned in Sacred history, as he is expressly called the son of
Amittai  <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7) . It is said there that
Jeroboam, the son of Joash, had enlarged the borders of his kingdom,
from the entrance into Hamath to the sea of the desert, according to the
word of Jonah, the servant of God, the son of Amittai, who came from
Gath. It was then at that time, or shortly before, that Jonah
prophesied. And it is certain that he was not only sent to the
Ninevites, but that he also was counted a Teacher among the people of
Israel. And the beginning also of his Book seems to intimate what I have
said, — that he was an ordinary Prophet among the people of Israel, for
it begins with a copulative, *And the Word of the Lord came to Jonah.*
Though the Holy Spirit does in other places speak sometimes in this
manner, yet I doubt not but that Jonah intimates that he was recalled
from the discharge of his ordinary office, a

<span id="iii.i-p4"></span>nd had a new charge committed to him, — to
denounce, as we shall see, on the Ninevites a near destruction.

<span id="iii.i-p5"></span>We must now then understand, that Jonah
taught among the people of Israel, but that he received a command to go
to the Ninevites. Of this command we shall take notice in its proper
place; but it is right that we should know that he was not then only
made a Prophet, when he was given as a Teacher to the Ninevites, but
that he was sent to the Ninevites after having for some time employed
his labors for God and his Church.

<span id="iii.i-p6"></span>This Book is partly historical and partly
didactic. For Jonah relates what happened to him after he had attempted
to avoid the call of God, and what was the issue of his prophecy: this
is one thing. But at the same time he mentions the kind of doctrine
which he was commanded to proclaim, and he also writes a Song of
Thanksgiving. This last part contains doctrines and is not a mere
narrative.

<span id="iii.i-p7"></span>I come now to the words.
