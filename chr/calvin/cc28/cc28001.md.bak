<span id="ii-p1"></span>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

<span id="ii-p2"></span>Contained in this Volume, as in the last, are
the Writings of *three* Prophets: and they are explained and elucidated
in the Author's peculiar manner; every sentence being dissected and
examined, and the meaning ascertained according to the context, without
the introduction of any extraneous matters. The main object throughout
seems to have been to exhibit the genuine sense and design of the Sacred
Writers.

<span id="ii-p3"></span>The Book of Jonah is a plain narrative, and no
part is supposed to have been written in the style of poetry except the
prayer in the second chapter.

<span id="ii-p4"></span>Some things in this Book have furnished Infidels
with objections, and have induced some learned men, bearing at least the
name of believers, to indulge in inventions. To satisfy Infidels or
themselves, they have endeavored to prove, that this Book is either an
historical allegory, or a parable, or a dream, or a moral fiction, or
something else still more absurd and extravagant. But all these are mere
vagrant conjectures, wholly groundless, rendered plausible only by a
show of learning, and calculated to do tenfold more mischief than all
the sneers and cavils of Infidels. The Bible Is A Book Of Miracles as
well as of Prophecies; and an attempt to divest it of its Miracles is an
attempt to divest it of one of its distinctive properties. Its
Prophecies, which are continued Miracles, capable in many instances of
ocular demonstration, attest those Miracles which were confined to
certain times and occasions, as these were also in some cases performed
for the purpose of gaining credit at the time to what was predicted. But
there are no Miracles recorded in Scripture, which involve as much
exercise of divine power as the fulfillment of Prophecies, though less
visible in its operation.  <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

<span id="ii-p6"></span>The fact that Miracles of some sort form a part
of the records of false religions and of superstitious times, is no
reason for disbelieving the Miracles of Scripture. Almost all errors are
imitations of truth, and superstition is man's substitute for true
Religion. The existence of a false coin is no evidence that there is no
genuine coin, but, on the contrary, proves that it exists. Independently
of the general character of the Miracles recorded in Scripture, what has
been just stated, their *connection* with indubitable Prophecies is an
argument in their favor, which neither heathen nor Christian
superstition is capable of adducing. Both must stand or fall together.
If the truth of Prophecies be allowed, then the reality of Miracles
cannot with any reason be denied. They are so connected together, that
they cannot possibly be separated.

<span id="ii-p7"></span>Learned men, being driven back, as it were, by
manifest and palpable absurdities, have sometimes resiliated beyond the
limits of reason and truth; being disgusted, and justly so, by Heathen
and Popish Miracles, they have often been imperceptibly led to doubt all
Miracles, as when we are frequently deceived, we are tempted to conclude
that there is no such a thing as honesty in the world. And hence has
arisen the attempt to obliterate Miracles from Scripture; and various
hypotheses have been suggested, and supported in some instances by no
small measure of ingenuity and learning: but it is an attempt which
ought in the strongest manner to be deprecated and condemned as being
nothing less than a sacrilege, the robbing of God's Word of one of its
peculiar characteristics, even of that by which God has visibly proved
his supreme power; for by reversing and changing those laws of nature,
which at the creation he had fixed and established, he has given a
manifest demonstration of his Omnipotence and Sovereignty. He has made
it known to the world by Miracles, that He who has constructed the
wonderful mechanism of nature, can alter, change, and reconstruct it
whenever He pleases.

<span id="ii-p8"></span>“The opinion,” says Dr. *Henderson, “which* has
been most generally entertained is that which accords to the Book a
strictly historical character; in other words, which affirms that it is
a relation of facts which actually took place in the life and experience
of the Prophet. Nor can I view it in any other light while I hold fast
an enlightened belief in the divine authority of the Books composing the
Canon of the Old Testament, and place implicit reliance on the authority
of the Son of God. Into the fixed and definite character of the Canon I
need not here enter, having fully discussed the subject elsewhere; but
assuming that all the Books contained in it possess the divine sanction,
the test to which I would bring the question, and by which, in my
opinion, our decision must be mainly formed, is the unqualified manner
in which the personal existence, miraculous fate, and public ministry of
JONAH are spoken of by our Lord. He not only explicitly recognizes the
prophetic office of the son of Amittai, (<span id="ii-p8.1"></span>Ιωνα
του προφητου,) just as he does that of Elisha, Isaiah, and Daniel, but
represents his being in the belly of the fish as a real miracle, (<span
id="ii-p8.2"></span>το σημειον,) grounds upon it, as a fact, the
certainty of the future analogous fact in his own history; *assumes* the
actual execution of the commission of the Prophet at Nineveh; positively
asserts that the inhabitants of that city repented at his preaching; and
concludes by declaring respecting himself, “*Behold*! a greater than
Jonah is here,” (<span id="ii-p8.3"></span>[Matt.
12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039.md), [Matt.
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#004)<span id="ii-p8.3"></span>..md) Now
is it conceivable that all these historical circumstances would have
been placed in this prominent light, if the person of the Prophet, and
the brief details of his narrative, had been purely fictitious? On the
same principle that the historical bearing of the reference in this ease
is rejected, may not that to the Queen of Sheba, which follows in the
connection, be set aside, and the portion in the First Book of Kings, in
which the circumstances of her visit to Solomon are recorded, be
converted into an allegory, a moral fiction, or a popular tradition? The
two eases, as adduced by our Lord, are altogether parallel; and the same
may be affirmed of the allusion to Tyre and Sidon, and that to Sodom in
the preceding chapter.”

<span id="ii-p9"></span>This reasoning is conclusive on the subject, and
cannot be fairly evaded. Our learned author adds another consideration:
—

<span id="ii-p10"></span>“Certainly in no other instance in which our
Savior adduces *passages* out of the Old Testament for the purpose of
illustrating or confirming his doctrines, can it be shown that any point
or circumstance is thus employed which is not historically true. He
uniformly quotes and reasons upon them as containing accounts of
universally admitted facts, stamps them as such with the high sanction
of his own authority, and transmits them for the confident belief of
mankind in all future ages.”

<span id="ii-p11"></span>That the preservation of Jonah in the bowels of
the fish was an impossibility according to the course and nature of
things, as they now exist, is quite evident: but it was no greater
reversion of nature than the parting of the Red Sea, or the dividing of
the streams of Jordan, or the sustentation of life in Moses during his
stay on the Mount for forty days. The laws of nature were equally
suspended in all these instances; and to deny to Him, who made these
laws to be what they are, the power of changing them, is an
inconsistency which no reason can justify.

<span id="ii-p12"></span>The next Prophet is Micah; and his Book is
especially interesting on account of the prediction it contains of the
birth-place of our Savior, and also of the establishment of his Kingdom,
and the spread of his Gospel. The prophecy recorded in the fourth
chapter is one of the most splendid in all the Writings of the Prophets.
We find the same in the second chapter of Isaiah; but it is fuller and
given more at large by Micah. The idea of borrowing seems not compatible
with the fact, that each declares that what they delivered was conveyed
to them by a vision: and there is nothing unreasonable in the thought,
that the Divine Spirit communicated the very same things, to a certain
extent, to two individual Prophets; and the fact that more, on the same
subject, was revealed to one than to the other, seems to favor the
notion, that the whole was communicated to each separately.

<span id="ii-p13"></span>It is a subject worthy of being noticed, — that
it was not the practice of the Prophets to refer to the testimony of one
another, or even expressly to the commandments included in the Law of
Moses. Isaiah indeed once said, “To the Law and to the Testimony.”
Though the sins which generally prevailed were distinctly condemned in
the Law, especially the idolatry which was so common, they yet never
quoted the commandments, and brought them to bear on the reigning
corruptions. This may appear singular: but the way to account for it
seems to be this, — that the Prophets' authority was the same with that
of Moses: Their communications proceeded from the same Author; and there
was no necessity to confirm what they said by referring to what the Law
sanctioned. The same God, who gave the Law by Moses, sent his messages
to the people by his Prophets. And hence arises a strong, though, as it
were, an incidental, proof of the Divine character of what they have
written.

<span id="ii-p14"></span>The style of Micah much resembles, in some
respects, the style of Hosea. His transitions are sometimes abrupt, and
the sudden change of persons is not unfrequent. *Lowth* in his
Prelections describes him as “being brief in words, sententious,
concise, pointed, — sometimes bordering on the obscurity of Hosea, — in
many parts lofty and fervid, and highly poetical.”  <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) *Marckius* says, that, “his diction is
elegant, not very unlike that of Isaiah.”  <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) *Henderson's* account is more extensive, but
on the whole just, as well as discriminating, — “His style is concise,
yet *perspicuous,*  <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) *nervous,*
vehement, and energetic; and, in many instances, equals that of Isaiah
in boldness and sublimity. He is rich and beautiful in the varied use of
tropical language, indulges in paranomasias, preserves a pure and
classical diction, is regular in the formation of parallelisms, and
exhibits a roundness in the construction of his periods, which is not
surpassed by his more celebrated contemporary. Both in administering
threatenings and communicating promises, he evinces great tenderness,
and shows that his mind was deeply affected by the subjects of which he
treats. In his appeals he is lofty and energetic. His description of the
character of Jehovah, <span id="ii-p17.1"></span>[Mic
7:18-20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018.md)<span id="ii-p17.1"></span>, is
unrivalled by any contained elsewhere in Scripture.”

<span id="ii-p18"></span>“Some of his prophecies,” says *Newcome, “*are
distinct and illustrious ones, as <span id="ii-p18.1"></span>[Mic.

<span id="ii-p19"></span>The *three* first chapters are throughout
comminatory, in which judgments are denounced on both nations, the Jews
and the Israelites, and in which are also enumerated the various evils
which prevailed, idolatry as the chief, and its accompanying sins —
injustice, oppression, and cruelty. — The *fourth* and the *fifth*
chapters are of an opposite character, being prophetic of blessings,
appertaining more especially to the Kingdom of Christ, while at the same
time the previous sufferings and trials of the Church are graphically
described. — In the *sixth* chapter the people are summoned to a trial;
the Lord had a controversy with them. Being proved guilty of
ingratitude, ignorance, injustice, and idolatry, they are threatened
with awful judgments. — In the *seventh* and last chapter the Prophet
bewails the paucity of good men, deplores the faithlessness and perfidy
of the people, turns to the Lord, entertains hope, foretells the
restoration of the Church and the fall of its enemies, and ends with a
rapturous exclamation, having been evidently favored with a glimpse of
the rich and abundant mercies which God had in reserve for his people.

<span id="ii-p20"></span>The Prophet Nahum has but one subject — the
Fall Of Nineveh — and he keeps to his subject without diverging to any
other. In mentioning the sins of Nineveh, the first thing he states is a
wicked design against the Lord, referring no doubt to the purpose formed
of entirely destroying the Kingdom of Judah. In describing afterwards
the vices of the people of Nineveh, he especially mentions their
rapaciousness, deceit, injustice, oppression, and barbarous cruelty, and
compares Nineveh to the den of lions.

<span id="ii-p21"></span>The special design of the Prophet in the
description he gives, at the beginning of *the first* chapter, of the
character of the Almighty, was to delineate him as He is to his enemies,
as the God of vengeance, who vindicates his own honor, and defends his
own cause against profane and rebellious opponents. He only makes a
transient allusion to his goodness towards his people. The other subject
was that which was suitable to his purpose. He was going to denounce
irrevocable judgment on God's adversaries; he therefore described Him as
the God of vengeance: and the extremely awful character here presented
to us by one who spoke, as he was inspired from above, ought to be well
weighed and seriously considered, especially by all those who are not
become God's friends, but still continue his enemies.

<span id="ii-p22"></span>The *second* chapter contains a vivid
description of the fierce assailants of Nineveh, of their success, of
the plunder of the city, and of the captivity of its people, with an
exultation over the den of lions. To prevent, as it were, any hope of
escape, the Prophet, in the *third* chapter, gives, according to Calvin
and many other Commentators, a graphic view of the ransack of the city,
as though he were an eye-witness; then he states the reasons for this
dreadful overthrow, reminds the Ninevites of what had happened to
another powerful and well fortified city, shows the uselessness of
resistance, and declares the doom of the city to be irrevocable and
irremediable. How wonderfully exact has been the fulfillment of this
Prophecy!  <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) Who can contemplate it
without acknowledging that He who spoke by the Prophets is the supreme,
who rules and overrules all the events of time?

<span id="ii-p24"></span>The style of Nahum has been admired by all
critics. *Lowth* says, that *“no* one of the minor Prophets seems to
equal the sublimity, the vehemence and the boldness of Nahum: besides,
his Prophecy is a complete and finished poem; his exordium is
magnificent, and indeed majestic; the preparation for the destruction of
Nineveh, and the description of its ruin, and its greatness, are
expressed in most vivid colors, and possess admirable perspicuity and
fulness.”  <span id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md)

<span id="ii-p26"></span>This Volume contains a very interesting portion
of The Minor Prophets. The History of Jonah is in many respects very
instructive.  <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) The Prophecies of Micah
are some of the most remarkable in the Old Testament. Nahum exhibits in
language the most awful the vengeance of the Almighty against the
enemies of his Church. And readers will find that our Commentator
continues to exercise his talents in that capacity with his wonted
vigor, penetration, and judgment. An impartial consideration of his
labors cannot fail to impress our minds with veneration for his
character, and especially with gratitude to the only Giver of all good
for having so richly endued his servant, and for having employed him in
services so conducive to the interest of true religion. Such was the
respect in which he was held by Bishop *Horsley,* whose learning and
acuteness were not of an ordinary kind, that in quoting his comment on a
portion of the eighteenth chapter of Isaiah, he calls him” The Venerable
Calvin.”

<span id="ii-p5"></span> “Prophecy is of a prodigious extent; it
commenced from the fall of man, and reaches to the consummation of all
things. So many illustrious events falling in, one after another, just
as the word of prophecy foretold they should, must afford the most
convincing proof that our Religion is, as it claims to be, of divine
institution, — a *proof* the more convincing, because it is continually
growing upon us; and the farther we are removed from the source of our
religion, the clearer is the evidence of its *truth.”* — *Bishop Hurd.*
