<span id="iv.6.i"></span>

<span id="iv.6.i-p1"></span>Lecture Ninety-third

<span id="iv.6.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.6.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.6.ii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
6:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.6.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.ii-p2"></span>**1.** Hear ye now what the Lord saith;
Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy
voice.

<span id="iv.6.ii-p3"></span>**1.** Audite nunc (vel, quaeso) quod dicit
Jehova, — Surge, litiga coram montibus, et colles audiant vocem tuam:

<span id="iv.6.ii-p4"></span>**2.** Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord’s
controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the Lord hath a
controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.

<span id="iv.6.ii-p5"></span>**2.** Audite montes disceptationem
Jehovae, et fortia undamenta terrae: quia disceptatio Jehovae cum populo
suo, et cum Israele contendet.

<span id="iv.6.ii-p6"></span> 

<span id="iv.6.ii-p7"></span><span id="iv.6.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.ii-p8"></span>Here the Prophet avowedly assumes that the
people were sufficiently proved guilty; and yet they resisted through a
hardiness the most obdurate, and rejected all admonitions without shame,
and without any discretion. He is therefore commanded to direct his
discourse to the mountains and to the hills; for his labor had now for a
long time been useless as to men. The meaning then is that when the
Prophet had spent much labor on the people and derived no fruit, he is
at length bidden to call the mountains and the hills to bear their
testimony to God; and thus before the elements is made known and proved
the ungodliness and the obstinacy of the people. But before he relates
what had been committed to him, he makes a preface, in order to gain
attention.

<span id="iv.6.ii-p9"></span>*Hear ye what Jehovah says.* The Prophets
are wont, on very serious subjects, to make such a preface as is here
made by Micah: and it is indeed sufficiently evident from the passage,
that he has here no ordinary subject for his teaching, but that, on the
contrary, he rebukes their monstrous stupidity; for he had been
addressing the deaf without any advantage. As then the Prophet was about
to declare no common thing, but to be a witness of a new judgment, —
this is the reason why he bids them to be unusually attentive. Hear, he
says, what Jehovah saith. What is it? He might have added, “Jehovah has
very often spoken to you, he has tried all means to bring you to the
right way; but as ye are past recovery, vengeance alone now remains for
you: he will no more spend labor in vain on you; for he finds in you
neither shame, nor meekness, nor docility.” The Prophet might have thus
spoken to them; but he says that another thing was committed to his
charge by the Lord, and that is, to contend or to plead before the
mountains. And this reproach ought to have most acutely touched the
hearts of the people: for there is here an implied comparison between
the mountains and the Jews; as though the Prophet said, — “The mountains
are void of understanding and reason, and yet the Lord prefers to have
them as witness of his cause rather than you, who exceed in stupidity
all the mountains and rocks.” We now then perceive the design of God.

<span id="iv.6.ii-p10"></span>Some take mountains and hills in a
metaphorical sense for the chief men who then ruled: and this manner of
speaking very frequently occurs in Scripture: but as to the present
passage, I have no doubt but that the Prophet mentions mountains and
hills without a figure; for, as I have already said, he sets the
hardness of the people in opposition to rocks, and intimates, that there
would be more attention and docility in the very mountains than what he
had hitherto found in the chosen people. And the particle <span
id="iv.6.ii-p10.2"></span>את, *at,* is often taken in the sense of
*before:* it means also with; but in this place I take it for <span
id="iv.6.ii-p10.3"></span>ל, *lamed,* before or near, as many instances
might be cited. But that this is the meaning of the Prophet it is easy
to gather from the next verse, when he says —

<span id="iv.6.ii-p11"></span><span id="iv.6.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.ii-p12"></span>*Hear, ye mountains, the controversy of
Jehovah,*  <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) how? *and ye strong
foundations of the earth,* he says. He speaks here no more of hills, but
summons the whole world; as though he said, “There is not one of the
elements which is not to bear witness respecting the obstinacy of this
people; for the voice of God will penetrate to the farthest roots of the
earth, it will reach the lowest depths: these men will at the same time
continue deaf.” And he says not, the Lord threatens you, or denounces
judgment on you; but Jehovah has a contention with his people. We now
then see that there is no metaphor in these words; but that the Prophet
merely shows how monstrous was the stupor of the people, who profited
nothing by the celestial doctrine delivered to them, so that the very
mountains and the whole machinery of earth and heaven, though destitute
of reason, had more understanding than these men. And it is not unusual
with the Prophets, we know, to turn their discourse to mute elements,
when there remains no hope of success from men. But our Prophet does not
abruptly address mountains and hills as Isaiah does, (<span
id="iv.6.ii-p13.1"></span>[Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002)<span id="iv.6.ii-p13.1"></span>,.md)
and as also Moses had done,

<span id="iv.6.ii-p14"></span>‘Hear, ye heavens, what I shall say, let
the earth hear the words of my mouth,’ (<span
id="iv.6.ii-p14.1"></span>[De
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001)<span id="iv.6.ii-p14.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="iv.6.ii-p15"></span>but he prefaces his discourse by saying,
that it had been specially commanded to him to summon the mountains and
hills to God’s judgment. By saying then, “Hear ye what Jehovah saith,”
he prepares as I have said, the Jews to hear, that they might know that
something uncommon and altogether unusual was to be announced, — that
the Lord, in order more fully to convict them of extreme impiety,
intended to plead his cause before the mountains.

<span id="iv.6.ii-p16"></span>*Arise, then, and plead before the
mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.* What sort of voice was
this? They who think that the judges are here figuratively pointed out
may be easily refuted; for Micah in the next verse mentions the
substance of this pleading, namely that the Lord expostulated with his
people. We hence see that God had no contention with the mountains, but
that, on the contrary, the mountains were summoned, that they might
understand God’s pleading, not against them, but against the people.
Hear then, ye mountains, Jehovah’s controversy, and ye strong
foundations of the earth, that is, the very rocks. There is nothing so
hard in the world, he says, that shall not be inane to hear; for this
pleading shall reach the lowest depths. *Jehovah then has a controversy
with his people, and he will plead,* or contend, *with Israel* It
follows —

<span id="iv.6.iii"></span>

<span id="iv.6.iii-p1"></span><span id="iv.6.iii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.6.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.iii-p2"></span>**3.** O my people, what have I done unto
thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.

<span id="iv.6.iii-p3"></span>**3.** Popule mi, quid feci tibi? Et in
quo exhibui tibi molestiam? Testificare contra me.

<span id="iv.6.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.6.iii-p5"></span><span id="iv.6.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.iii-p6"></span>Here God, in the first place, offers to
give a reason, if he was accused of any thing. It seems indeed
unbecoming the character of God, that he should be thus ready as one
guilty to clear himself: but this is said by way of concession; for the
Prophet could not otherwise express, that nothing that deserved blame
could be found in God. It is a personification, by which a character;
not his own, is ascribed to God. It ought not therefore to appear
inconsistent, that the Lord stands forth here, and is prepared to hear
any accusation the people might have, that he might give an answer, *My
people! what have I done?* By using this kind expression, my people, he
renders double their wickedness; for God here descends from his own
elevation, and not only addresses his people, in a paternal manner, but
stands as it were on the opposite side, and is prepared, if the people
had anything to say, to give answer to it, so that they might mutually
discuss the question, as it is usually done by friends. Now the more
kindly and indulgently the Lord deals with his people, the more
enhanced, as I have said, is their sin.

<span id="iv.6.iii-p7"></span>He says first, *What have I done to thee?*
that is, what hast thou to accuse me with? He adds *In what have I
caused trouble*  <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) *to thee?* or,
In what have I been troublesome to thee? Testify, he says, against me.
This testifying was to be made to the mountains and hills; as though he
said, “I am ready to plead my cause before heaven and earth; in a word,
before all my creatures.” Some render the passage, “Answer me:” and
<span id="iv.6.iii-p8.5"></span>ענה, *one,* is also to answer; but the
context requires the former meaning; for God conceded so much liberty to
the Jews, that they might bring forward against him any fault they had
to allege. *Testify,* he says, *against me;* that is, there are
witnesses present; make public now thy case by stating particulars, I am
ready for the defense. We hence see the truth of what I have before
stated, — that a character, not his own is ascribed to God: but this is
done by way of concession. He afterwards adds —

<span id="iv.6.iv"></span>

<span id="iv.6.iv-p1"></span><span id="iv.6.iv-p1.1"></span>[Micah
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.6.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.iv-p2"></span>**4.** For I brought thee up out of the
land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I
sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

<span id="iv.6.iv-p3"></span>**4.** Certe (vel, quia, vel, nempe quod
ascendere te feci e terra AEgypti, et ex domo servorum redemi te, et
misi coram te Mosen, Aaron, et Mariam.

<span id="iv.6.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.6.iv-p5"></span><span id="iv.6.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.iv-p6"></span>God, having testified that he had in
nothing been troublesome to the people, now states with how great and
with how many benefits he had bound them to himself. But we may prefer
taking the words as explanatory and somewhat ironical that he records
his benefits in the place of trouble or vexation; though, in my
judgment, it is better to read the two clauses apart. *I have brought
thee,* he says, *from the land of Egypt,* from that miserable bondage;
and then he says, *I have redeemed thee*  <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) By the word, redeem, he expresses more
clearly and more fully illustrates his kindness. Then he adds, *I have
set over thee as leaders Moses,* and Aaron, and Miriam, the sister of
them both. Benefits, we know, are often accompanied with injuries; and
he who obliges another destroys all his favor, when he turns kindness as
it often happens, into reproach. It is hence frequently the case, that
he who has been kind to another brings so serious an injury, that the
memory of his kindness ought not to continue. God mentions here these
two things, — that he had conferred vast benefits on the people, — and
yet that he had in nothing been burdensome to them; as though he said
“Many are those things which I can, if necessary, on my part bring
forward, by which I have more than a hundred times made thee indebted to
me; now thou canst not in thy turn bring anything against me; thou canst
not say that I have accompanied my benefits with wrongs, or that thou
hast been despised, because thou were under obligations to me, as it is
often the case with men who proudly domineer, when they think that they
have made others bound to them. I have not then thought proper to
accompany my great favors with anything troublesome or grievous to
thee.” We now understand why the Prophet expressly mentions these two
things, — that God had in nothing been vexatious to his people, — and
that he had brought them up from the land of Egypt.

<span id="iv.6.iv-p8"></span>That redemption was so great, that the
people ought not to have complained, had it been the will of God to lay
on their shoulders some very heavy burdens: for this answer might have
been ever readily given, — “Ye have been delivered by me; ye owe to me
your life and your safety. There is therefore no reason why any thing
should be now burdensome to you; for the bondage of Egypt must have been
bitterer to you than hundred deaths; and I redeemed you from that
bondage.” But, as the Lord had treated his redeemed people so kindly and
so humanely, yea, with so much indulgence, how great and how intolerable
was their ingratitude in not responding to his great kindness? We now
more fully understand the Prophet’s meaning in these words.

<span id="iv.6.iv-p9"></span>I have made thee to ascend, he says, from
Egypt; and then, I have redeemed thee. He goes on, as we have said, by
degrees. He afterwards adds, I have sent before thy face Moses, Aaron,
and Miriam. God means here that it had not been a momentary kindness;
for he continued his favor towards the Jews when he set over them Moses
and Aaron, and Miriam, which was an evidence of his constant care, until
he had completed his work of delivering them. For Moses was a minister
of their deliverance in upholding civil order, and Aaron as to the
priesthood and spiritual discipline. With regard to Miriam, she also
performed her part towards the women; and as we find in <span
id="iv.6.iv-p9.1"></span>[Exodus
15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.6.iv-p9.1"></span>, she
composed a song of thanksgiving after passing through the Red Sea: and
hence arose her base envy with regard to Moses; for being highly
praised, she thought herself equal to him in dignity. It is at the same
time right to mention, that it was an extraordinary thing, when God gave
authority to a woman, as was the case with Deborah that no one may
consider this singular precedent as a common rule. It now follows —

<span id="iv.6.v"></span>

<span id="iv.6.v-p1"></span><span id="iv.6.v-p1.1"></span>[Micah
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.6.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.v-p2"></span>**5.** O my people, remember now what Balak
king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him
from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the
Lord.

<span id="iv.6.v-p3"></span>**5.** Popule mi, recordare nunc (vel,
quaeso, est eadem particula) quid cogitaverit Balak, rex Moab, et quid
responderit ei Balaam, filius Beor, a Sittim usque ad Gilgal, ut
cognosceres (vel, cognoscas) justitias Jehovae.

<span id="iv.6.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.6.v-p5"></span><span id="iv.6.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.v-p6"></span>God briefly records here what happened in
the desert, — that the people had need of some extraordinary help in
addition to the many benefits which he had conferred on them. For though
the people lived safely in the desert as to the Egyptians, though they
were fed by manna and water from the rock flowed for them, though the
cloud by day protected them from the heat of the sun, and the pillar of
fire shone on them during the night, yet the stream of God’s mercy
seemed to have been stopped when Balaam came forth, who was a Prophet,
and then, as one armed with celestial weapons, fought against the people
and opposed their deliverance. Now, had God permitted Balaam to curse
the people, what could have taken place, but that they must have been
deprived of all their blessings? This is the reason why the Prophet
specifically refers to this history, — that the cursing of Balaam was
miraculously turned into a blessing, even through the secret purpose of
God. Micah might indeed have referred to all those particulars by which
God could have proved the ingratitude of the people; but he deemed it
sufficient to touch on the fact of their redemption, and also to mention
by the way this extraordinary instance of God’s kindness.

<span id="iv.6.v-p7"></span>*Remember,* he says, *what Balak devised,*
that is, how crafty was his counsel: for the verb <span
id="iv.6.v-p7.1"></span>יעף, *iots,* is to be taken here in a bad sense,
and is very emphatical; as though the Prophet had said, that there was
more danger in this fraud than in all the violence of enemies; for Balak
could not have done so much harm, had he prepared a great army against
the Israelites, as by hiring a Prophet to curse the people. For certain
it is, that though Balaam was an impostor and full of deceits, as it is
probable that he was a man given to profane superstitions, he was yet
endued with the gift of prophecy. This was the case no doubt; and we
know that God has often so distributed the gifts of his Spirit, that he
has honored with the prophetic office even the ungodly and unbelieving:
for it was a special gift, distinct from the grace of regeneration.
Balaam then was a Prophet. Now when Balak saw that he was unequal in
power to oppose the people, he thought of this expedient — to get some
Prophet to interpose for the purpose of exciting the wrath of God
against the people. This is the reason why it is here said, Remember
what Balak consulted against thee; that is, “Thou were then in the
greatest danger, when a Prophet came, hired for the purpose, that he
might in God’s name pronounce on thee a curse.”

<span id="iv.6.v-p8"></span>It may be asked, Whether Balaam could really
curse the people of Israel? The answer is easy: the question here is not
what might have been the effect, without God’s permission; but Micah
here regards only the office with which Balaam was honored and endued.
As then he was God’s Prophet, he could have cursed the people, had not
God prevented him. And no doubt Balak was wise enough to know, that the
Israelites could not be resisted by human power, and that, therefore,
nothing remained for him but the interposition of God; and as he could
not bring down God from heaven, he sent for a Prophet. God puts his own
power in his word, — as God’s word resided in Balaam, and as he was, as
it were, its depositary, it was no wonder that Balak thought that he
would become the conqueror of the people of Israel, provided they were
cursed by Balaam’s mouth; for this would have been as it were, the
announcement of God’s wrath.

<span id="iv.6.v-p9"></span>He now subjoins, *And what Balaam, the son
of Beor, answered him.* There is here shown, on the one hand, a danger,
because Balaam was craftier than all the other enemies of the people,
for he could have done more by his artifice than if he had armed against
them the whole world: here then was the danger. But, on the other hand,
we know what he answered; and it is certain that the answer of Balaam
did not proceed from himself, but, on the contrary, from the Spirit of
God. As Balaam spoke by the secret influence of the Spirit, contrary to
the wish of his own heart, God thus proved that he was present at that
very time, when the safety of the people was endangered. Think, then, or
remember, what Balaam answered; as though he said, — “Balaam was very
nigh cursing thee, for his mouth was opened: for he had sold himself to
an ungodly king, and nothing could have pleased him more than to have
poured forth many anathemas and many curses: but he was constrained to
bless your fathers. What did this mean? Did not the wonderful favor of
God shine forth in this instance?” We now perceive the Prophet’s design,
and what a large meaning there is in these words.

<span id="iv.6.v-p10"></span>He afterwards adds generally, *From Shittim
even to Gilgal.* This is not connected with the last clause; for Balaam
did not follow the people from Shittim to Gilgal; but a verb is to be
understood,  <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) as though he said,
— “Thou knowest what things happened to thee from Shittim to Gilgal,
from the beginning to the end; at the time when thou didst enter the
wilderness, thou hadst begun to provoke the wrath of God.” And we know
that even in Shittim the Israelites fell away into idolatry; and that
defection, in a manner, alienated them from God. Hence God shows here
that he, in his goodness and mercy, had contended with the ungodly ways
of the people even to Gilgal; that is, “Thou hast never ceased to
provoke me.” We indeed know that the people continually excited against
themselves the displeasure of God, and that their defections were many
and various. In short, then the Prophet shows that God had so mercifully
dealt with the people, that he had, in a most astonishing manner,
overcome their wickedness by his goodness.

<span id="iv.6.v-p14"></span>He at length subjoins*, That thou mayest
know the righteousnesses of Jehovah.* By righteousnesses he means acts
of kindness, as the sense of the word is in many other passages: for the
righteousness of God is often taken not only for uprightness, but also
for the faithfulness and truth which he manifests towards his people. It
betokens therefore the relation between God and his Church, whenever the
word, righteousness, is to be understood in this sense. *That thou
mayest then know the righteousnesses of Jehovah;* that is, that
experience itself may prove to thee how faithful, how beneficent, how
merciful has God ever been towards your race.  <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) Since then the righteousness of God
was conspicuous, the people must surely have been mute, and had nothing
for which they could justly expostulate with God: what remained, but
that their extreme impiety, fully detected before heaven and earth and
all the elements, exposed them to his judgment? It now follows —

<span id="iv.6.vi"></span>

<span id="iv.6.vi-p1"></span><span id="iv.6.vi-p1.1"></span>[Micah
6:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.6.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.vi-p2"></span>**6.** Wherewith shall I come before the
Lord, *and* bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with
burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?

<span id="iv.6.vi-p3"></span>**6.** In quo occurram Jehovae? Incurvabo
me coram Deo excelso? Occurramne ei in holocaustis? In vitulis
anniculis?

<span id="iv.6.vi-p4"></span>**7.** Will the Lord be pleased with
thousands of rams, *or* with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I
give my firstborn *for* my transgression, the fruit of my body *for* the
sin of my soul?

<span id="iv.6.vi-p5"></span>**7.** An complacitum erit Jehovae in
millibus arietum? In decem millibus vallium olei (vel, pinguedinis?) An
dabo primogenitum peccatum meum (hoc est, piaculum peccati mei? Fructum
ventris mei, piaculum sceleris animae mea?

<span id="iv.6.vi-p6"></span>**8.** He hath shewed thee, O man, what
*is* good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and
to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?

<span id="iv.6.vi-p7"></span>**8.** Indicavit tibi, homo, quid bonum; et
quid Jehova quaerit abs te nisi facere judicium et deligere clementiam
(vel, bonitatem,) et humiliari ut ambules cum Deo tuo.

<span id="iv.6.vi-p8"></span> 

<span id="iv.6.vi-p9"></span><span id="iv.6.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.vi-p10"></span>The Prophet now inquires, as in the name
of the people, what was necessary to be done: and he takes these two
principles as granted, — that the people were without any excuse, and
were forced to confess their sin, — and that God had hitherto contended
with them for no other end and with no other design, but to restore the
people to the right way; for if his purpose had only been to condemn the
people for their wickedness, there would have been no need of these
questions. But the Prophet shows what has been often stated before, —
that whenever God chides his people, he opens to them the door of hope
as to their salvation, provided those who have sinned repent. As this
then must have been well known to all the Jews, the Prophet here asks,
as with their mouth, what was to be done.

<span id="iv.6.vi-p11"></span>He thus introduces them as inquiring,
*With what shall I approach Jehovah, and bow down before the high God?*
 <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md)

<span id="iv.6.vi-p13"></span>*Shall I approach him with
burnt-offerings,*  <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) *with calves
of a year old?* But at the same time there is no doubt, but that he
indirectly refers to that foolish notion, by which men for the most part
deceive themselves; for when they are proved guilty, they indeed know
that there is no remedy for them, except they reconcile themselves to
God: but yet they pretend by circuitous courses to approach God, while
they desire to be ever far away from him. This dissimulation has always
prevailed in the world, and it now prevails: they see that they whom God
convicts and their own conscience condemns, cannot rest in safety. Hence
they wish to discharge their duty towards God as a matter of necessity;
but at the same time they seek some fictitious modes of reconciliation,
as though it were enough to flatter God, as though he could be pacified
like a child with some frivolous trifles. The Prophet therefore detects
this wickedness, which had ever been too prevalent among them; as though
he said, — “I see what ye are about to say; for there is no need of
contending longer; as ye have nothing to object to God, and he has
things innumerable to allege against you: ye are then more than
condemned; but yet ye will perhaps say what has been usually alleged by
you and always by hypocrites, even this, — ‘We wish to be reconciled to
God, and we confess our faults and seek pardon; let God in the meantime
show himself ready to be reconciled to us, while we offer to him
sacrifices.’” There is then no doubt, but that the Prophet derided this
folly, which has ever prevailed in the hearts of men: they ever think
that God can be pacified by outward rites and frivolous performances.

<span id="iv.6.vi-p15"></span>He afterwards adds, *He has proclaimed to
thee what is good.* The Prophet reproves the hypocrisy by which the Jews
willfully deceived themselves, as though he said, — “Ye indeed pretend
some concern for religion when ye approach God in prayer; but this your
religion is nothing; it is nothing else than shamelessly to dissemble;
for ye sin not either through ignorance or misconception, but ye treat
God with mockery.” — How so? “Because the Law teaches you with
sufficient clearness what God requires from you; does it not plainly
enough show you what is true reconciliation? But ye close your eyes to
the teaching of the Law, and in the meantime pretend ignorance. This is
extremely childish. God has already proclaimed what is good, *even to do
judgment, to love kindness and to walk humbly with God.”* We now
perceive the design of the Prophet.

<span id="iv.6.vi-p16"></span>As then he says here, With what shall I
appear before God? we must bear in mind, that as soon as God condescends
to enter into trial with men, the cause is decided; for it is no
doubtful contention. When men litigate one with another, there is no
cause so good but what an opposite party can darken by sophistries. But
the Prophet intimates that men lose all their labor by evasions, when
God summons them to a trial. This is one thing. He also shows what deep
roots hypocrisy has in the hearts of all, for they ever deceive
themselves and try to deceive God. How comes it that men, proved guilty,
do not immediately and in the right way retake themselves to God, but
that they ever seek windings? How is this? It is not because they have
any doubt about what is right except they willfully deceive themselves,
but because they dissemble and willfully seek the subterfuges of error.
It hence appears that men perversely go astray when ever they repent not
as they ought, and bring not to God a real integrity of heart. And hence
it also appears that the whole world which continues in its
superstitions is without excuse. For if we scrutinize the intentions of
men, it will at length come to this, — that men carefully and anxiously
seek various superstitions, because they are unwilling to come before
God and to devote themselves to him, without some dissembling and
hypocrisy. Since it is so, certain it is, that all who desire to pacify
God with their own ceremonies and other trifles cannot by any pretext
escape. What is said here is at the same time strictly addressed to the
Jews, who had been instructed in the teaching of the Law: and such are
the Papists of this day; though they spread forth specious pretenses to
excuse their ignorance, they may yet be refuted by this one fact, — that
God has prescribed clearly and distinctly enough what he requires: but
they wish to be ignorant of this; hence their error is at all times
wilful. We ought especially to notice this in the words of the Prophet;
but I cannot proceed farther now.

<span id="iv.6.vii-p1"></span>Prayer.

<span id="iv.6.vii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast
made known to us thy Law, and hast also added thy Gospel, in which thou
callest us to thy service, and also invites us with all kindness to
partake of thy grace, — O grant, that we may not be deaf, either to thy
command or to the promises of thy mercy, but render ourselves in both
instances submissive to thee and so learn to devote all our faculties to
thee, that we may in truth avow that a rule of a holy and religious life
has been delivered to us in thy law, and that we may also firmly adhere
to thy promises, lest through any of the allurements of the world, or
through the flatteries and crafts of Satan thou shouldest suffer our
minds to be drawn away from that love which thou hast once manifested to
us in thine only-begotten Son and in which thou daily confirmest us by
the teaching of the Gospel, until we at length shall come to the full
enjoyment of this love in that celestial inheritance, which has been
purchased for us by the blood of thy only Son. Amen.

<span id="iv.6.vii-p3"></span><span id="iv.6.vii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.viii"></span>

<span id="iv.6.viii-p1"></span>Lecture Ninety-fourth

<span id="iv.6.viii-p2"></span>We have seen in the last lecture that
hypocrites inquire how God is to be pacified, as though they were very
solicitous about the performance of their duty; and that in the meantime
these are mere disguises; for by circuitous windings they turn here and
there, and never wish to come directly to God. The way might have been
easily known by them; but they closed their eyes, and at the same time
pretended that they had some concern for religion. And this is also very
commonly the case in our day; and common experience, if any one opens
his eyes, clearly proves this, — that the ungodly, who deal not
sincerely with God, profess a very great concern, as though they were
wholly intent on serving God, and yet turn aside here and there, and
seek many bypaths, (*diverticula,*) that they may not be constrained to
present themselves before God. We have already seen, that this false
pretense is fully exposed, inasmuch as God has enough, and more than
enough, demonstrated in his Law, what he approves and what he requires
from men. Why then do hypocrites, as still uncertain, make the inquiry?
It is because they are willfully blind at mid-day; for the doctrine of
the Law ought to have been to them as a lamp to direct their steps; but
they smother this light, yea, they do what they can wholly to extinguish
it: they ask, as though perplexed, how can we pacify God?

<span id="iv.6.viii-p3"></span>But it ought also to be observed, (for
the Prophet says, *Shall I give my first-born, and the fruit of my
loins, as an expiation for my soul?*  <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167) *.md)* that hypocrites will withhold
nothing, provided they are not to devote themselves to God. We see the
same thing under the Papacy at this day; they spare no expense, nor even
the greatest toils: provided the ungodly have always a freedom to live
in sin, they will easily grant to God all other things. For through a
false conceit they make a sort of agreement with God: if they mortify
themselves, and toil in ceremonies, and if they pour forth some portion
of their money, if they sometimes deprive nature of its support, if with
fastings and by other things, they afflict themselves, they think that
by these means they have fully performed their duties. But these are
frivolous trifles; for in the meantime they consider themselves exempt
from the duty of obeying God. Being yet unwilling to be regarded as
alienated from God, they, at the same time, obtrude on him their
meritorious works, to prevent his judgment, and to exempt themselves
from the necessity of doing the principal thing, that which he
especially requires — to bring a sincere heart. Thus then hypocrites
wish to divide things with God, that they may remain within such as they
are; and they spread forth outwardly many frivolous things for the
purpose of pacifying him. And this is the reason why the Prophet says
now, *Shall I give my first-born?* for hypocrites wish to appear as
though they were burning with the greatest zeal, — “Rather than that God
should remain angry with me, I would not spare the life of my
first-born; I would rather be the executioner of my own son: in short,
nothing is so valuable to me, which I would not be really to part with,
that God may be propitious to me.” This indeed is what they boast with
their mouth; but at the same time they will not offer their heart as a
sacrifice to God: and as they deal dishonestly with God, we see that all
is nothing but dissimulation.

<span id="iv.6.viii-p7"></span>If any one objects, and says, — that the
other rites, of which the Prophet speaks here, had been enjoined by
God’s Law, the answer is easy; but I shall not now but briefly touch on
what I have elsewhere more largely handled: The Prophet denies, that
sacrifices avail any thing for the purpose of propitiating God. This may
seem inconsistent with the teaching of the Law, but in fact it
altogether agrees with it. God indeed wished sacrifices to be offered to
him; and then this promise was always added, *Iniquity shall be atoned.*
But the object must be noticed; for God did not command sacrifices, as
though they were of themselves of any worth; but he intended to lead the
ancient people by such exercises to repentance and faith. It was
therefore his design to remind the Jews that they did no good, except
they themselves became sacrifices; and it was also his will that they
should look to the only true sacrifice, by which all sins are expiated.
But hypocrites, like falsifiers of documents, abused the command of God,
and adulterated the sacrifices themselves. It was then a profane
sacrilege for them to think that God would be propitious to them, if
they offered many oxen and calves and lambs. It was the same thing as if
one asked the way, and after having known it, rested quietly and never
moved a foot. God had shown the way, by which the Jews might come to
repentance and faith: and they ought to have walked in it; but they
wickedly trifled with God; for they thought that it would be a
satisfaction to his justice, if they only performed outward rites.
Whenever then the Prophets in God’s name repudiate sacrifices, the
abuse, by which God’s Law was corrupted, is ever to be considered, that
is, when the Jews brought sacrifices, only, and had no respect to the
end in view, and did not exercise themselves in repentance and faith. It
is for this reason that our Prophet declares, that all sacrifices were
of no account before God, but were vain things: they were so, when they
were separated from their right end.

<span id="iv.6.viii-p8"></span><span id="iv.6.viii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.viii-p9"></span>He then says that God had shown by his
Law what is good; and then he adds what it is, *to do justice, to love
mercy,* or kindness, *and to be humbled before God.* It is evident that,
in the two first particulars, he refers to the second table of the Law;
that is *to do justice, and to love mercy*  <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) Nor is it a matter of wonder that the
Prophet begins with the duties of love; for though in order the worship
of God precedes these duties, and ought rightly to be so regarded, yet
justice, which is to be exercised towards men, is the real evidence of
true religion. The Prophet, therefore, mentions justice and mercy, not
that God casts aside that which is principal — the worship of his name;
but he shows, by evidences or effects, what true religion is. Hypocrites
place all holiness in external rites; but God requires what is very
different; for his worship is spiritual. But as hypocrites can make a
show of great zeal and of great solicitude in the outward worship of
God, the Prophets try the conduct of men in another way, by inquiring
whether they act justly and kindly towards one another, whether they are
free from all fraud and violence, whether they observe justice and show
mercy. This is the way our Prophet now follows, when he says, that God’s
Law prescribes *what is good,* and that is, *to do justice* — to observe
what is equitable towards men, and also to perform the duties of mercy.

<span id="iv.6.viii-p11"></span>He afterwards adds what in order is
first, and that is, *to humble thyself to walk with God:*  <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) it is thus literally, “And to be
humble in walking with thy God.” No doubt, as the name of God is more
excellent than any thing in the whole world, so the worship of him ought
to be regarded as of more importance than all those duties by which we
prove our love towards men. But the Prophet, as I have already said, was
not so particular in observing order; his main object was to show how
men were to prove that they seriously feared God and kept his Law: he
afterwards speaks of God’s worship. But his manner of speaking, when he
says, that men ought to be humble, that they may walk with their God, is
worthy of special notice. Condemned, then, is here all pride, and also
all the confidence of the flesh: for whosoever arrogates to himself even
the least thing, does, in a manner, contend with God as with an opposing
party. The true way then of walking with God is, when we thoroughly
humble ourselves, yea, when we bring ourselves down to nothing; for it
is the very beginning of worshipping and glorifying God when men
entertain humble and low opinion of themselves. Let us now proceed —

<span id="iv.6.ix"></span>

<span id="iv.6.ix-p1"></span><span id="iv.6.ix-p1.1"></span>[Micah
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.6.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.ix-p2"></span>**9.** The Lord’s voice crieth unto the
city, and *the man of* wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and
who hath appointed it.

<span id="iv.6.ix-p3"></span>**9.** Vox Jehovae ad civitatem (vel, ad
expergefaciendum) clamat (ad verbum, clamabit;) et vir intelligentiae
videbit nomen tuum: audite virgam, et quis testificetur eam.

<span id="iv.6.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.6.ix-p5"></span><span id="iv.6.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.ix-p6"></span>The Prophet complains here that he and
other teachers did but little, though their cry resounded and was heard
by the whole people. He therefore says, that the *voice* of God *cried;*
as though he had said that there was no excuse for ignorance, for God
had indiscriminately exhorted them all to repentance. Now, since what
was taught was common to them all, the Prophet deplores their
perverseness, for very few were attentive; and the fable was sung,
according to the proverb, to the deaf. We must then notice the word
*cry;* *the voice* of God, he says, *crieth.* God did not whisper in the
ear of one or two, but he designed his voice to be heard by all from the
least to the greatest. The Prophets then did cry loud enough, but there
were no ears to hear them.

<span id="iv.6.ix-p7"></span>We may take the word <span
id="iv.6.ix-p7.1"></span>לעיר, *laoir,* in two ways. <span
id="iv.6.ix-p7.2"></span>עיר, *oir,* means a city. But some derive it
from <span id="iv.6.ix-p7.3"></span>עור, *our,* and render it as if it
were written <span id="iv.6.ix-p7.4"></span>להעיר, *laeoir*. If <span
id="iv.6.ix-p7.5"></span>ה, *he* is put in, it must be rendered, *To
rouse;* and the letter <span id="iv.6.ix-p7.6"></span>ה, *he,* may be
concealed under the point chamets; and this sense would be the most
suitable, *The voice of Jehovah cries to arouse* or awaken; that is
though the people are torpid, and as it were overpowered with sleep, for
they indulged themselves in their sins; yet the voice of God ought to be
sufficient to arouse them all: however sleepy they might have been,
there was yet power enough in the doctrine of the Law, which the Prophet
daily proclaimed. But still this voice, by which the whole people ought
to have been awakened, was not heard!

<span id="iv.6.ix-p8"></span>*The man of understanding,* he says *will
see thy name* The word <span id="iv.6.ix-p8.1"></span>תושיה, *tushie,*
means properly understanding, as it is clear from many other passages;
but the Prophet means that there was a very small number who were
teachable; and he calls them men of understanding. At the same time, he
indirectly reproves the sottishness of the people, though they all
boasted that they were wise, and boasted also that they were the
learners of the Law. The Prophet shows here by implication, that
understanding was a rare thing among that people; for few hearkened to
the voice of God. And thus we see what his object was; for he wished to
touch the Jews to the quick, that they might acknowledge that they were
without mind and understanding, because they had hardened themselves
against God, so that his voice did not reach their hearts. He therefore
shows that they were all besides themselves; for had they any right
understanding, they would have hearkened to God speaking to them, as
they were his disciples. What indeed could have been more strange, nay
more inhuman, than for men to reject the doctrine of their salvation,
and to turn aside from hearing even God himself? Thus the madness of the
people was reproved; for though the voice of God sounded in the ears of
them all, it was not yet listened to.

<span id="iv.6.ix-p9"></span>If one prefers reading, *In the city,* then
no doubt the Prophet means, that the voice of God was proclaimed through
all the cities: for to confine it, as some interpreters do, to
Jerusalem, or to Samaria, appears frigid. We must then understand a
change of number, and take city for any large concourse of people; as
though he had said, that there was no city in which God did not cry and
yet that there were ears no where.

<span id="iv.6.ix-p10"></span>It afterwards follows, *Shall see thy
name*. Some render it, Shall fear,  <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) as though it was from <span
id="iv.6.ix-p13.8"></span>ירא, *ira*; but it comes on the contrary from
<span id="iv.6.ix-p13.9"></span>ראה, *rae*; and rules of grammar will
not allow it to be viewed otherwise. And the Prophet speaks in a
striking manner, when he says, that the *intelligent man seeth the name
of God.* For whence proceeded the contempt of wicked men, so that they
disregarded the voice of God, except from this — that his majesty had no
effect on them; that is, they did not acknowledge that they had to do
with God? For if they really understood what I have said, — that God
spoke to them, his majesty would have immediately come to view, it would
have arrested all their thoughts. God then would have constrained even
the most heedless to fear him, had it not been, that they imagined the
voice which sounded in their ears was that of man. Significantly then
does the Prophet say, that it was the act of singular prudence to see
the name of God, that is to understand from whom the doctrine proceeded.
For as soon as we hearken to God, his majesty, as I have said, must so
penetrate all our thoughts, as to humble us before him, and to constrain
us to do him homage. The contempt then of spiritual doctrine, and also
the perverseness of ungodly men, proceed from this, — that they see not
the name of God, that they understand not that it is his name.

<span id="iv.6.ix-p14"></span>He afterwards adds, *Hear ye the rod, and*
him *who proclaims it to you* By rod he means threatening; as though he
said, — “Your arrogance in mocking God shall not go unpunished, as
though his voice were an empty sound: there is then no reason for you to
deceive yourselves with the hope of impunity; for God will avenge the
contempt of his word.” Now the Prophet’s design was, to denounce an
approaching vengeance on those who came not willingly to God, and
received not his word with genuine docility of mind. Whenever, then, men
despise the voice of God, as though it proceeded only from a mortal
being, on such Micah denounces an impending vengeance; for the contempt
of his word is a thing intolerable to God. This is the reason why he
immediately adds, after having complained of the contempt of his word,
that vengeance was not afar off; *Hear ye* then *the rod, and who
declares or testifies concerning it*

<span id="iv.6.ix-p15"></span>This last clause ought to be especially
noticed; for the ungodly are not terrified when God declares that he
will be an avenger, because they think not that they must give an
account of their life, or they look only on mortal man, “Ah! who speaks?
Is he indeed our God? Is he armed with celestial power? Do we not see a
mortal man and one like ourselves?” We daily see that the ungodly do
thus cast away every fear, and willfully harden themselves against God’s
judgments. It is not then without reason that the Prophet bids the Jews
seriously to consider *who testifies* of the rod; as though he said, —
“I indeed confess that I am a mortal man, but remember who has sent me;
for I go not forth as a private individual, nor have I presumptuously
intruded into this office; but I am armed with God’s command; nay, God
himself speaks through my mouth. If then ye despise me, the Lord is
present, who will vindicate his own commands for he will not suffer
himself to be despised in his servants though they may be contemptible
according to the flesh, he will yet have the reverence which it deserves
to be paid to his word.” We now perceive the real meaning of the
Prophet. It now follows —

<span id="iv.6.x"></span>

<span id="iv.6.x-p1"></span><span id="iv.6.x-p1.1"></span>[Micah
6:10-11](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.6.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.x-p2"></span>**10.** Are there yet the treasures of
wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure *that is*
abominable?

<span id="iv.6.x-p3"></span>**10.** Adhuc an sunt in domo impii thesauri
impietatis? Et modius macilentus deterestabilis (vel, provocans iram?)

<span id="iv.6.x-p4"></span>**11.** Shall I count *them* pure with the
wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?

<span id="iv.6.x-p5"></span>**11.** An justificabo stateras impietatis,
et sacculum ponderum doli?

<span id="iv.6.x-p6"></span> 

<span id="iv.6.x-p7"></span><span id="iv.6.x-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.x-p8"></span>Interpreters differ as to the word <span
id="iv.6.x-p8.1"></span>האש, *eash*: some think that it ought to be read
<span id="iv.6.x-p8.2"></span>האיש, *eaish,* with an addition of two
letters, and render it, “Is it yet man?” But this would render the
passage abrupt. Others translate, “Is there yet fire?” As though it was
<span id="iv.6.x-p8.3"></span>אש, *ash*; and they suppose that wealth,
wickedly and unjustly got, is so called, because it consumes itself. But
as this is against what grammar requires, I am more inclined to take
their view, who think that <span id="iv.6.x-p8.4"></span>האש, *eash,* is
to be taken here for <span id="iv.6.x-p8.5"></span>היש, *eish,*  <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) *, aleph* being put for jod: and they
rightly consider that the sentence is to be read as a question, *Are
there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the ungodly?* If
this view be approved, then we must consider the Prophet as proposing a
question respecting a thing really monstrous, — How can it be that
treasures, gathered by plunder and wickedness, still remain with you,
since ye have been so often warned, and since God daily urges you to
repentance? How great is your hardness, that no fear of God lays hold on
your minds? But the meaning would not be unsuitable were we to regard
God as a Judge examining them concerning a matter unknown, Are there
still the treasures of impiety in the house of the ungodly? that is, “I
will see whether the ungodly and wicked hide their treasures:” for God
often assumes the character of earthly judges; not that any thing
escapes his knowledge, but that we may know that he is not precipitant
in deciding a question. This view, then, is by no means inappropriate,
that is, that God here assumes the character of an earthly judge, and
thus speaks, “I will see whether there are still treasures concealed by
the ungodly; I will search their houses; I will know whether they have
as yet repented of their crimes.” thus, then, may be understood the
words of the Prophet, *Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the
house of the ungodly?* For God, as I have already said, shows that he
would know respecting the plunders and the various kinds of cruelty
which they had exercised.

<span id="iv.6.x-p12"></span>He then adds, Is there *the bare measure,*
that is, a measure less than it ought to be, *which is detestable?*
 <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) Then he says,

<span id="iv.6.x-p14"></span><span id="iv.6.x-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.x-p15"></span>*Shall I justify? etc.*  <span
id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) This verse is connected with the last,
and is added as an explanation. For God having come forth as a Judge,
now shows what sort of Judge he is, even one who is not biased by favor,
who does not change his judgment, who shows no respect of persons. But
men, for the most part, greatly deceive themselves, when they transform
God according to their own will, and promise to themselves that he will
be propitious to them, provided they only make false pretensions to him.
God then here declares, that he differs widely from earthly judges, who
now incline to one side and then to another, who are changeable, and
often deviate from the right course: but, on the contrary, he says
here*, Shall I justify wicked balances? shall I justify weights of
fraud,* or deceitful? that is, “Shake off all those delusions by which
ye are wont to deceive yourselves; for I do not change either my nature
or my purpose; but according to the true teaching of my Law, I will
punish all the wicked without any respect of persons: wherever
wickedness and iniquity are found, there punishment will be inflicted.”

<span id="iv.6.x-p17"></span>We now then understand how these two verses
harmonize together. God shows that he will be a judge, and then, that he
differs from men, who often change, as it has been said, in their
decisions.

<span id="iv.6.x-p18"></span>I will mention another meaning, which will
perhaps be preferred by some. The question, after the manner of the
Hebrews, may be taken as an affirmation, as though he had said, that
within a short time, (for <span id="iv.6.x-p18.1"></span>עוד, *oud,*
means sometimes a short time,) the treasures of iniquity would not be
found, for they would be taken away: then follows a confirmation, for
frauds and robberies by false measures and deceitful weights could not
escape God’s judgment. The meaning then would be, that as God must
necessarily, according to his own office, punish thefts, it cannot be
that he will suffer men, who cheat by false weights to continue always
unpunished. It now follows —

<span id="iv.6.xi"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xi-p1"></span><span id="iv.6.xi-p1.1"></span>[Micah
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.6.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xi-p2"></span>**12.** For the rich men thereof are full
of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their
tongue *is* deceitful in their mouth.

<span id="iv.6.xi-p3"></span>**12.** Quia (sic enim verto; nam qui

accipitur, quia ergo) divites ejus impleverunt (vel seipsos, vel domos
suas, subaudiendum est) <span id="iv.6.xi-p4.4"></span>חמס, rapina (vel,
violentia;) et incolae ejus locuti sunt fallaciam, et lingua eorum
fallax (vel, fraudulenta) in ore ipsorum.

<span id="iv.6.xi-p5"></span> 

<span id="iv.6.xi-p6"></span><span id="iv.6.xi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xi-p7"></span>The Prophet means that the people were so
given to avarice and plunder, that all the riches they had heaped
together had been got by iniquitous robberies or by wicked gain. He now
addresses the citizens of Jerusalem: for though iniquity then prevailed
through the whole of Judea, there was yet a reason why he should
distinctly accuse the inhabitants of Jerusalem; for they must have led
the way by their example, and they were also worse in wickedness than
the rest of the people: they were at least more obstinate, as they daily
heard God’s Prophets.

<span id="iv.6.xi-p8"></span>Hence he says, *her rich men gather not
their wealth* except by violence. It is indeed certain, that the rich
were not then alone guilty before God; but this evil has too much
prevailed, that the more liberty any one possesses, the more he employs
it to do wrong. Those indeed who have not the power refrain, not because
they are not inclined to do harm, but because they are as it were
restrained; for poverty is often a bridle to men. As then the rich could
spread their snares, as they had power to oppress the poor, the Prophet
addresses his words to them, not that the rest were without fault or
guilt, but because iniquity was more conspicuous in the rich, and that,
because their wealthy as I have already said, gave them more power.

<span id="iv.6.xi-p9"></span>He afterwards extends his address to all
the inhabitants, *They all,* he says, *speak falsehood,* that is, they
have no sincerity, no uprightness; they are wholly given to frauds and
deceits. *And their tongue is false in their mouth* This mode of
speaking seems apparently absurd; for where can the tongue be except in
the mouth? It appears then a sort of redundancy, when he says that their
tongue was deceitful in their mouth. But it is an emphatical mode of
speaking, by which the Hebrews mean, that men have falsehoods in
readiness as soon as they open their mouth. It is then the same as
though the Prophet had said, that no pure word and free from guile could
come from them, for as soon as they opened their mouth, falsehoods
instantly came forth; their tongue was fraudulent, so that none could
expect from these men any truth or faithfulness. — How so? Because as
soon as they began to speak, they instantly discovered some guile, there
was ever in readiness some falsehood to circumvent the simple.

<span id="iv.6.xi-p10"></span>We now then see that not a few men were
summoned before God’s tribunal, but that all without exception were
condemned; as though the Prophet had said, that there was no more any
integrity in the city, and that corruptions prevailed everywhere, for
all were intent on deceiving one another. It follows —

<span id="iv.6.xii"></span>

satisfied; and thy casting down *shall be* in the midst of thee; and
thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and *that* which thou
deliverest will I give up to the sword.

<span id="iv.6.xii-p6"></span> 

<span id="iv.6.xii-p7"></span><span id="iv.6.xii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xii-p8"></span>God, after having declared that he would
be the Judge of the people, speaks now more clearly of their punishment.
He says therefore that he was armed with vengeance: for it often
happens, when a judge, even one who hates wickedness, is not able to
punish, for he dreads the fierceness of those whom he thinks himself
unequal to restrain. Hence God intimates here, that there will not be
wanting to him a power to punish the people, *I will afflict thee,* he
says, *by striking* or wounding *thee;* for so some render the words.
 <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) The sum of what is said is, —
that nothing would be an obstacle to prevent God from inflicting
punishment on the people, for there would be no want of power in his
case. There is therefore no reason for men to promise themselves any
escape when God ascends his tribunal; for were they fortified by all
possible means they could not ward off the hand of God.

<span id="iv.6.xii-p14"></span><span id="iv.6.xii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xii-p15"></span>And he points out what sort of punishment
it would be; and he mentions even two kinds in this verse. He says
first, *Thou shalt eat, and shalt not be satisfied.* One of God’s
plagues, we know, is famine: and so the Prophet here declares, that the
people would be famished, but not through the sterility of the fields.
God indeed brings a famine in two ways: now the land yields no fruit;
the corn withers, or, being smitten with hail, gives no fruit; and thus
God by the sterility of the fields often reduces men to want and famine:
then another mode is adopted, by which he can consume men with want,
namely, when he breaks the staff of bread, when he takes away from bread
its nourishing virtues so that it can no more support men, whatever
quantity they may swallow; and this is what experience proves, if only
we have eyes to observe the judgments of God. We now see the meaning of
this clause, when he says, *Thou shalt eat, and shalt not be satisfied;*
as though he said, “I can indeed, whenever it pleases me, deprive you of
all food; the earth itself will become barren at my command: but that ye
may more clearly understand that your life is in my hand, a good supply
of fruit shall be produced, but it shall not satisfy you. Ye shall then
perceive that bread is not sufficient to support you; for by eating ye
shall not be able to derive from bread any nourishment.”

<span id="iv.6.xii-p16"></span>He then adds, *And thy dejection*  <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) *shall be in the midst of thee;* that
is, though no man from without disturb or afflict thee yet thou shalt
pine away with intestine evils. This is the real meaning; and
interpreters have not sufficiently considered what the Prophet means,
through too much negligence. But the passage ought to be noticed: for
the Prophet, after having threatened a famine, not from want, but from
the secret curse of God, now adds, *Thy dejection shall be in the midst
of thee;* that is “Though I should rouse against thee no enemies, though
evidences of my wrath should not appear, so as to be seen at a distance,
yea, though no one should disturb thee, yet thy dejection, thy calamity,
shall be in the midst of thee, as though it were cleaving to thy bowels;
for thou shalt pine away through a hidden malady, when God shall
pronounce his curse on thee.”

<span id="iv.6.xii-p18"></span>He now subjoins another kind of
punishment, *Thou shalt take hold,*  <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) *but shalt not deliver, and what thou
shalt deliver, I will give up to the sword* Some read, “A woman shall
lay hold,” that is, conceive seed, “and shall not preserve it;” and
then, “though she may bring forth in due time, I will yet give up what
may be born to the sword.” But this meaning is too strained. Others
apply the words to fathers, “Thou, father, shalt lay hold;” that is thou
shalt endeavor to preserve thy children, “and thou shalt not preserve
them.” But I wonder that interpreters have thus toiled in vain in a
matter so simple and plain. For he addresses here the land, or he
addresses the city: as though he said, “The city shall take hold,” or
embrace, as every one does who wishes to preserve or keep any thing; for
what we wish to keep safe, we lay hold on it, and keep it as it were in
our arms; “*and what thou shalt preserve, I will give up to the sword:*
thou wilt try all means to preserve thyself and thy people, but thou
shalt not succeed: thou shalt then lose all thy labor, for though thou
shouldest preserve some, yet the preserved shall not escape
destruction.”

<span id="iv.6.xii-p20"></span>If any one prefers to refer what is said
to women, with regard to conception, as the third person of the feminine
gender is used, let him have his own opinion; for this sense may
certainly be admitted, that is, that the Lord would render the women
barren, and that what they might bring forth would be given up to the
slaughter, inasmuch as the Lord would at length destroy with the sword
both the parents and their children.

<span id="iv.6.xiii"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xiii-p1"></span>Prayer.

<span id="iv.6.xiii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou canst
find in us cause enough to execute not only one kind of vengeance, but
innumerable kinds of vengeance, so as to destroy us at length
altogether, — O grant, that we may of our own accord anticipate thy
judgment, and with true humility so abhor ourselves, that there may be
kindled in us a genuine desire to seek what is just and right, and thus
endeavor to devote ourselves wholly to thee, that we may find thee to be
propitious to us: and since we in so many ways offend thee, grant, that
in true and sincere faith we may raise up all our thoughts and
affections to thy only-begotten Son, who is our propitiation, that thou
being appeased, we may lay hold on him, and remain united to him by a
sacred bond, until thou at length gatherest us all into that celestial
kingdom, which he has procured for us by his own blood. Amen.

<span id="iv.6.xv-p2"></span>**15.** Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not

<span id="iv.6.xv-p3"></span>**15.** Tu seres, et non metes; tu calcabis
(*vel*, premes) oleum, et non unges te oleo; et mustum, et non bibes
vinum.

<span id="iv.6.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.6.xv-p5"></span><span id="iv.6.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xv-p6"></span>The Prophet adds another kind of
punishment, which was to follow the calamity threatened in the last
verse. He had said, that those who escaped would at length be destroyed
by the sword; he says now, that the whole land would become a prey to
enemies: and he took his words from Moses; for it was usual with the
prophets, when they wished to secure greater authority to themselves, to
quote literally the curses contained in the Law, as in the present
instance: see <span id="iv.6.xv-p6.1"></span>[Deuteronomy
28](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.6.xv-p6.1"></span> and
<span id="iv.6.xv-p6.2"></span>[Leviticus
26](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.6.xv-p6.2"></span>. Now
it is well known, that God denounced this punishment, with others, on
the people, — that when they sowed their fields, another would reap, —
that when they cultivated with great labor their vineyards, others would
become the vintagers. The meaning is that whatever fruit the land
produced, would come into the hands of enemies, for all things would be
exposed to plunder. Now it is a very grievous thing, when we see not
only our provisions consumed by enemies, but also the fruit of our
labor; which is the same as though they were to drink our blood: for the
labor of man is often compared to blood, for labor occasions
perspiration. It now follows —

<span id="iv.6.xvi"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xvi-p1"></span><span id="iv.6.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Micah
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.6.xvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xvi-p2"></span>**16.** For the statutes of Omri are kept,
and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels;
that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an
hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.

<span id="iv.6.xvi-p3"></span>**16.** Et observata sunt edicta Amri, et
omne opus domus Ahab; et ambulabitis consiliis eorum, ut tradam te in
excidium (vel, vastitatem,) et incolas ejus in sibilum; et opprobrium
populi mei portabitis.

<span id="iv.6.xvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.6.xvi-p5"></span><span id="iv.6.xvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xvi-p6"></span>Some read the words in the future tense,
“And they will observe the statutes of Omri,” etc., and gather this
meaning, — that the Prophet now foresees by the Spirit, that the people
would continue so perverse in their sins, as to exclude every hope that
they could be reformed by any punishments. The meaning then would be,
“The Lord has indeed determined to punish sharply and severely the
wickedness of this people; but they will not repent; they will
nevertheless remain stupid in their obstinacy, and go on in their
superstitions, which they have learned from the kings of Israel.” There
is however another view, and one more generally approved and that is, —
that the Jews, having forsaken God, and despised his Law, had turned
aside to the superstitions of the kingdom of Israel. Hence he says, that
*observed were the decrees of Omri, and every work of the house of Ahab*
Omri was the father of Ahab, who was made king by the election of the
soldiers, when Zimri, who had slain the king, was rejected. When Omri
bought Samaria, he built there a city; and to secure honor to it, he
added a temple; and hence idolatry increased. Afterwards his son Ahab
abandoned himself to every kind of superstition. Thus matters became
continually worse. Hence the Prophet, by mentioning here king Omri and
his posterity, (included in the words, “the house of Ahab”) clearly
means, that the Jews who had purely worshipped God, at length
degenerated, and were now wholly unlike Israelites, as they had embraced
all those abominations which Omri and his son Ahab had devised. True
religion as yet prevailed in the tribe of Judah, though the kingdom of
Israel was become corrupt, and filthy superstitions had gained the
ascendancy: but in course of time the Jews became also implicated in
similar superstitions. Of this sin the Prophet now accuses them; that
is, that they made themselves associates with the Israelites: *Observed*
 <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) *then are the edicts of Omri,
and the whole work of the house of Ahab:* Ye walk, he says, (the future
here means a continued act, as often elsewhere,) *ye walk in their
counsels.*

<span id="iv.6.xvi-p8"></span>It must be observed, that the Prophet here
uses respectable terms, when he says that <span
id="iv.6.xvi-p8.1"></span>הקעת*, chekut,* statutes or decrees, were
observed; and when he adds, “the counsels” of the kings of Israel: but
yet this is in no way stated as an excuse for them; for though men may
not only be pleased with, but also highly commend, their own devices,
yet the Lord abominates them all. The Prophet no doubt designedly
adopted these words, in order to show that those pretenses were
frivolous and of no account, which superstitious men adduce, either to
commend or to excuse their own inventions. They ever refer to public
authority, — “This has been received by the consent of all; that has
been decreed; it is not the mistake of one or two men; but the whole
Church has so determined: and kings also thus command; it would be a
great sin not to show obedience to them.” Hence the Prophet, in order to
show how puerile are such excuses, says, “I indeed allow that your
superstitions are by you honorably distinguished, for they are approved
by the edicts of your kings, and are received by the consent of the
many, and they seem not to have been inconsiderately and unadvisedly,
but prudently contrived, even by great men, who were become skillful
through long experience.” But how much soever they might have boasted of
their statutes and counsels, and however plausibly they might have
referred to prudence and power in order to disguise their idolatries,
yet all those things were of no account before God. By counsels, the
Prophet no doubt meant that false kind of wisdom which always shines
forth in the traditions of men; and by statutes, he meant the kingly
authority.

<span id="iv.6.xvi-p9"></span>We hence see that it is a vain thing to
color over what is idolatrous, by alleging power on the one hand in its
favor, and wisdom on the other. — How so? Because God will not allow
dishonor to be done to him by such absurd things; but he commands us to
worship him according to what is prescribed in his Word.

<span id="iv.6.xvi-p10"></span>And now a denunciation of punishment
follows, *That I should deliver thee to desolation,* and its
inhabitants, etc. There is a change of person; the Prophet continually
addresses the land, and under that name, the people, — that I should
then deliver thee to exile, or desolation, *and thine inhabitants to
hissing* It is a quotation from Moses: and by *hissing* he means the
reproach and mockery to which men in a miserable state are exposed.

<span id="iv.6.xvi-p11"></span>At last he adds, *Ye shall bear the
reproach of my people* Some take the word, people, in a good sense, as
though the Prophet had said here, that God would punish the wrongs which
the rich had done to the distressed common people; but this view, in my
judgment, is too confined. Others understand this by the reproach of
God’s people, — that nothing would be more reproachful to the Jews, than
that they had been the people of God; for it would redound to their
dishonor and disgrace, that they, who had been honored by such an
honorable name, were afterwards given up to so great miseries. But the
passage may be otherwise explained: we may understand by the people of
God the Israelites; as though the Prophet said, “Do ye not perceive how
the Israelites have been treated? Were they not a part of my people?
They were descendants from the race of Abraham as well as you; nor can
you boast of a higher dignity: They were then equal to you in the
opinion of all; and yet this privilege did not hinder my judgment, did
not prevent me from visiting them as they deserved.” Such a view
harmonizes with the passage: but there is, as I think, something
ironical in the expression, “my people;” as though he said, “The
confidence, that ye have been hitherto my people, hardens you: but this
false and wicked boasting shall increase your punishment; for I will not
inflict on you an ordinary punishment, as on heathens and strangers; but
I shall punish your wickedness much more severely; for it is necessary,
that your punishment should bear proportion to my favor, which has been
so shamefully and basely despised by you.” Hence, by the reproach of
God’s people, I understand the heavier judgments, which were justly
prepared for all the ungodly, whom God had favored with such special
honor, as to regard them as his people: for the servant, who knew his
master’s will, and did it not, was on that account more severely
corrected,  <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) <span

<span id="iv.6.iv-p7"></span> The complete sentence is, “from the house
of servants,” or rather, slaves: for they were not properly what we call
servants, but slaves, in Egypt. The Septuagint has <span
id="iv.6.iv-p7.1"></span>εξ οικου δουλειας — from the house of slavery.
“The house of slaves,” is the version both of Newcome and of Henderson.
They are the same words as we find in <span id="iv.6.iv-p7.2"></span>[Ex
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.6.iv-p7.2"></span>,
rendered, “out of the house of bondage;” which ought to be translated
slavery rather than bondage, if we depart from the literal rendering —
the house of slaves. — *Ed.*

id="iv.6.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.v-p11"></span> Various have been the ways to complete
this evidently defective sentence; and there is no assistance from any
MSS., or from the Septuagint. Shittim was in the land of Moab, and
Gilgal was beyond Jordan, in the land of Canaan. *Grotius* and many
others repeat the word “Remember,” and supply, “what I have done,” or,
“what happened.” This is a sort of omission, which we can hardly think a
writer would have made. It is far more probable that a word or words
have been somehow left out: and the *Targum,* though generally no safe
guide, has so given the passage as to countenance this conjecture. “Were
not great things done for you,” is the supplement of the Targum. “And
what I did,” seems to be the most natural addition: such words as <span
id="iv.6.v-p11.1"></span>ומה עשיתי appear to have been left out by
transcribers. I would then render the verse thus: —

<span id="iv.6.v-p12"></span>My people, remember, I pray,  
What did Balak, the king of Moab, consult,  
And what did Balaam, the son of Beor, answer him,  
(And what I did) from Shittim even to Gilgal,  
That ye may know the faithful dealings of Jehovah.

<span id="iv.6.viii-p4"></span> The substance of the two lines is given
here, not in their literal version. He evidently gives somewhat a
different meaning from our translation; and probably the original admits
better of the construction adopted here. If <span
id="iv.6.viii-p4.1"></span>פשע, a transgression or trespass, be taken
for a trespass-offering, and <span id="iv.6.viii-p4.2"></span>חטאה, for
a sin-offering, as it is often, then the rendering would be this, —

<span id="iv.6.viii-p5"></span>Shall I make my first-born my
trespass-offering,  
The fruit of my loins a sin-offering for my soul?

<span id="iv.6.viii-p6"></span>The verb <span
id="iv.6.viii-p6.1"></span>נתן is not only to give, to present, to
offer, but also to make, to constitute, to appoint. But if the first be
rendered transgression, the law of parallelism requires that the second
should be rendered sin. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_168"></span>[169](cc28015.htm#fr_168.md) <span
id="iv.6.viii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.viii-p10"></span> The expression is remarkable — *to love
mercy,* or benevolence, beneficence, or kindness; it is not only to show
mercy or kindness, but to *love* it, so as to take pleasure and delight
in it. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_169"></span>[170](cc28015.htm#fr_169.md) <span
id="iv.6.viii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.viii-p12"></span> The words are, <span
id="iv.6.viii-p12.1"></span>והצנע לכת עם-אלהיך. The verb <span
id="iv.6.viii-p12.2"></span>צנע occurs nowhere else but as a passive
participle in <span id="iv.6.viii-p12.3"></span>[Pr
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.6.viii-p12.3"></span>; but its meaning there is evident, for it
is opposed to pride, <span id="iv.6.viii-p12.4"></span>זדון, which means
a swelling pride, such as fills one with high notions of one’s self.
Then the opposite of this is to be humble from a sense of one’s own
emptiness. As it is here to the infinitive Hiphil, its literal meaning
is what Calvin assigns to it — tohumble one’s self. And the best
rendering of this line would be — “And to humble thyself to walk with
God.” The Septuagint renders it <span
id="iv.6.viii-p12.5"></span>ετοιμον εναι — to be ready; Theodotion,
<span id="iv.6.viii-p12.6"></span>ασφαλιζου; Vulgate, <span
id="iv.6.viii-p12.7"></span>*solicitum* But these seem not to have
understood the word. The *Welsh* version is exactly and literally the
Hebrew — <span id="iv.6.viii-p12.8"></span>*Ac ymostwng I rodio gyda ‘th
Dduw. Gostwng* is to humble, and by adding <span
id="iv.6.viii-p12.9"></span>*ym,* and dropping the *g,* the verb has
exactly the meaning of the Hiphil in Hebrew—to humble one’s self. They
are, indeed, *some* verbs in *Welsh* which admit of all the
modifications of the Hebrew verbs, being active, passive, causative, and
reflective. — *Ed.*

id="iv.6.ix-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.ix-p11"></span> And so *Newcome* renders it, and there
are a few copies in favor of this reading, in which <span
id="iv.6.ix-p11.1"></span>יראי is found: but a fact of this kind is not
sufficient to make a change, except there will be other reasons. And
then in the next line there is a change made, without the authority of
one MS. Indeed these two lines are rendered as though the Archbishop had
another text; and indeed it is another: his version is this, —

<span id="iv.6.ix-p12"></span>*And* there is *a sound wisdom with them
that fear his name:  
Hear, O ye tribes, him that testifieth.*

<span id="iv.6.ix-p13"></span>This version is partly derived from the
Septuagint; which could not have been wholly followed, as it differs so
widely from the Hebrew, and hardly presents any meaning. There is far
more correspondence in the passage, as it is rendered in our version,
and by *Calvin,* and also by *Henderson;* and the Hebrew is closely
followed. *Drusius* and others agree with *Calvin,* that <span
id="iv.6.ix-p13.1"></span>תושיה, which is rendered often “sound wisdom,”
is to be taken here as concrete, signifying a wise man. <span
id="iv.6.ix-p13.2"></span>מטה is evidently the rod of correction, and is
used in this sense in <span id="iv.6.ix-p13.3"></span>[Isa.
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024.md)<span id="iv.6.ix-p13.3"></span>;
and it is more consistent with the whole passage to consider <span
id="iv.6.ix-p13.4"></span>יעדה as a future, construed, as in the present
tense, with an affix, from <span id="iv.6.ix-p13.5"></span>עד, to
testify, than from <span id="iv.6.ix-p13.6"></span>יעד to appoint, —
“Hear ye the rod,” the chastening rod, “and who testifies of it.”
*Newcome* viewed it as being this verb; but he takes no notice of its
affix <span id="iv.6.ix-p13.7"></span>ה, which refers to the rod, by
which chastisement is signified. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_171"></span>[172](cc28015.htm#fr_171.md) <span

<span id="iv.6.x-p9"></span> One MS. Has <span
id="iv.6.x-p9.1"></span>היש, which no doubt is the true reading. The
Septuagint has <span id="iv.6.x-p9.2"></span>μηπυρ, which seems to have
no sense whatever. Many copies have <span id="iv.6.x-p9.3"></span>האיש,
and this is the reading followed by *Junius* and *Tremelius,* and their
version is this, —

<span id="iv.6.x-p10"></span>*Has any one still the house of a
dishonest* man? *  
The treasures of dishonesty?  
And the small detestable ephah?*

<span id="iv.6.x-p11"></span>— *Ed.*

<span id="fn_172"></span>[173](cc28015.htm#fr_172.md) <span
id="iv.6.x-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.x-p13"></span> Literally it is, “And the ephah of
detestable scantiness?” *Marckius* renders the words, “<span
id="iv.6.x-p13.1"></span>Et ephah tenuitatis abominabilis?” *Henderson,*
“And the accursed *scanty ephah?*”

<span id="fn_173"></span>[174](cc28015.htm#fr_173.md) <span
id="iv.6.x-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.x-p16"></span> <span id="iv.6.x-p16.1"></span>האזכה. It
is not true what *Henderson* says, that the verb <span
id="iv.6.x-p16.2"></span>זכה is not used transitively. See <span
id="iv.6.x-p16.3"></span>[Ps
73:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.6.x-p16.3"></span>;
<span id="iv.6.x-p16.4"></span>[Pr
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.6.x-p16.4"></span>
*Jerome* renders the phrase, <span id="iv.6.x-p16.5"></span>*numquid
approbabo?* Our own version is no doubt correct. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_174"></span>[175](cc28015.htm#fr_174.md) <span
id="iv.6.xi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xi-p4"></span> There is nothing in what goes before for
which a reason is given here: hence this <span
id="iv.6.xi-p4.1"></span>אשר cannot be rendered as here proposed. It is
an instance of a peculiarity in Hebrew, when a double pronoun is used.
Literally it is, “Which the rich men of hers;” the reference is to the
city mentioned in verse 9. *Grotius, Newcome,* and *Henderson,* render
the words thus, “Whose rich men,” etc. The *Welsh* is very nearly the
same, which no more than the Hebrew can with propriety be literally
rendered in English or in the learned languages, — <span
id="iv.6.xi-p4.2"></span>*Yr hon y mae ei chyvoethogion yn llawn trais*
— The which her rich men are full of violence. But this mode of speaking
has a more distinct and fuller reference to what is gone before than the
simple relative “whose:” the connection is made more evident. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_175"></span>[176](cc28015.htm#fr_175.md) <span
id="iv.6.xii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xii-p9"></span> *Newcome* renders this line differently,
—

<span id="iv.6.xii-p10"></span>Wherefore I will begin go smite thee.

<span id="iv.6.xii-p11"></span>Following a few MSS. And the Septuagint,
he takes the verb here to be <span id="iv.6.xii-p11.1"></span>החלתי,
which means, to begin; but the rendering seems flat, and suits not the
passage; and it is not true, for the Lord has often smitten them before.
The verb is in the past tense, and this has created a difficulty. The
verbs in the following verse, which is connected with this, are all in
the future tense, referring to a coming judgment. To remove this
difficulty I propose the following version, —

<span id="iv.6.xii-p12"></span>*But even I,* who *have made* thee *to
grieve by striking thee,  
*Will *make* thee *wholly desolate on account of thy sins:*

<span id="iv.6.xii-p13"></span>Then the threatened desolation is
specified. The verb <span id="iv.6.xii-p13.1"></span>השמם, making
desolate, is evidently a participle connected with <span
id="iv.6.xii-p13.2"></span>אני I, at the beginning of the verse, the
rest being an intervening clause: and when a participle follows a
nominative case, which often occurs in Hebrew, the auxiliary verb must
be supplied in a translation, which in its tense must be regulated by
the context, and here by the verse which follows. *Piscator* renders it
<span id="iv.6.xii-p13.3"></span>*Desolabo,* and says, that it is an
infinitive put for the future. Grief or sorrow had already been
produced, but now entire desolation is threatened. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_176"></span>[177](cc28015.htm#fr_176.md) <span
id="iv.6.xii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xii-p17"></span> *Newcome,* without the authority of a
single MS., but following the Septuagint and *Houbigant,* has changed
<span id="iv.6.xii-p17.1"></span>ישחך into <span
id="iv.6.xii-p17.2"></span>יחשך, “it shall be dark.” Though the meaning
of the passage is not thus materially affected, it is an alteration
without sufficient reasons, there being no MS. in its favor, and no
necessity arising from the passage itself: indeed, dejection or
depression, or casting down, is more suitable to the context, and more
emphatical. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_177"></span>[178](cc28015.htm#fr_177.md) <span
id="iv.6.xii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xii-p19"></span> The verb is <span
id="iv.6.xii-p19.1"></span>תסנ, which *Henderson* considers to be in
Hephil, the <span id="iv.6.xii-p19.2"></span>י being left out, which is
sometimes the case: with *Drusius* and others, he renders it, “remove,”
that is not *goods,* as he says, but wives and children; for if any were
for a time removed to a place of safety, they were afterwards to be
given up to the sword. Several copies have <span
id="iv.6.xii-p19.3"></span>ש instead of <span
id="iv.6.xii-p19.4"></span>ס, which makes it to be the verb <span
id="iv.6.xii-p19.5"></span>נשג, and this has the meaning of laying hold
or apprehending. But either meaning will suit the context. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_178"></span>[179](cc28015.htm#fr_178.md) <span
id="iv.6.xvi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xvi-p7"></span> The verb, <span
id="iv.6.xvi-p7.1"></span>ישתמר, is in the singular, and is followed by
its nominative case, which is in the plural number. Grammarians are at a
loss to account for this, and hence propose several modes of
construction. But it is evidently an anomalous idiom, somewhat similar
to that in Greek, when plural neuters take a verb in the singular
number. As it has been already observed, such a construction as we find
here, is very common in the *Welsh* language. The verb is in Hithpael,
the reflective mood, the <span id="iv.6.xvi-p7.2"></span>ת, as often the
case, changing place with the first letter of the verb. It is not always
that this mood is reflective, but is sometimes passive, as we find to be
the case with <span id="iv.6.xvi-p7.3"></span>סתר, in <span
id="iv.6.xvi-p7.4"></span>[Isa
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#014.md)<span id="iv.6.xvi-p7.4"></span>,
and <span id="iv.6.xvi-p7.5"></span>עבר, in <span
id="iv.6.xvi-p7.6"></span>[De
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#026.md)<span id="iv.6.xvi-p7.6"></span>.
And so here it does not retain its reflective meaning. But it may be,
that intensity, diligence, or earnestness, is intended to be conveyed;
that is, that the statutes of Omri were diligently and carefully
observed. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_179"></span>[180](cc28015.htm#fr_179.md) <span
id="iv.6.xvi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.6.xvi-p12"></span> There is another view mentioned by
*Drusius,* — that is, the *reproach* which God had previously denounced
on his people, in case they sinned and continued in their perverseness.
Reproach in this sense would mean punishment. — *Ed.*
