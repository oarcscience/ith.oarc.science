<span id="iv.1.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.1.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.ii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.1.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.ii-p2"></span>**1.** The word of the LORD that came to
Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, *and* Hezekiah, kings
of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

<span id="iv.1.ii-p3"></span>**1.** Sermo Jehovae qui factus est (*vel*,
directus) ad Michah Morasthitem, diebus Jotham, Achaz, Jehizkiae, regum
Judae, quem vidit super Samariam et Jerusalem.

<span id="iv.1.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.ii-p5"></span><span id="iv.1.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.ii-p6"></span>This inscription, in the first place, shows
the time in which Micah lived, and during which God employed his labors.
And this deserves to be noticed: for at this day his sermons would be
useless, or at least frigid, except his time were known to us, and we be
thereby enabled to compare what is alike and what is different in the
men of his age, and in those of our own: for when we understand that
Micah condemned this or that vice, as we may also learn from the other
Prophets and from sacred history, we are able to apply more easily to
ourselves what he then said, inasmuch as we can view our own life as it
were in a mirror. This is the reason why the Prophets are wont to
mention the time in which they executed their office.

<span id="iv.1.ii-p7"></span>But how long Micah followed the course of
his vocation we cannot with certainty determine. It is, however,
probable that he discharged his office as a Prophet for thirty years: it
may be that he exceeded forty years; for he names here three kings, the
first of whom, that is Jotham, reigned sixteen years; and he was
followed by Ahab, who also reigned as many years. If then Micah was
called at the beginning of the first reign, he must have prophesied for
thirty-two years, the time of the two kings. Then the reign of Hezekiah
followed, which continued to the twenty-ninth year: and it may be, that
the Prophet served God to the death, or even beyond the death, of
Hezekiah.  <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) We hence see that the
number of his years cannot with certainty be known; though it be
sufficiently evident that he taught not for a few years, but that he so
discharged his office, that for thirty years he was not wearied, but
constantly persevered in executing the command of God.

<span id="iv.1.ii-p9"></span>I have said that he was contemporary with
Isaiah: but as Isaiah began his office under Uzziah, we conclude that he
was older. Why then was Micah joined to him? That the Lord might thus
break down the stubbornness of the people. It was indeed enough that one
man was sent by God to bear witness to the truth; but it pleased God
that a testimony should be borne by the mouth of two, and that holy
Isaiah should be assisted by this friend and, as it were, his colleague.
And we shall hereafter find that they adopted the very same words; but
there was no emulation between them, so that one accused the other of
theft, when he repeated what had been said. Nothing was more gratifying
to each of them than to receive a testimony from his colleague; and what
was committed to them by God they declared not only in the same sense
and meaning, but also in the same words, and, as it were, with one
mouth.

<span id="iv.1.ii-p10"></span>Of the expression, that the *word was sent
to him,* we have elsewhere reminded you, that it ought not to be
understood of private teaching, as when the word of God is addressed to
individuals; but the word was given to Micah, that he might be God’s
ambassador to us. It means then that he came furnished with commands, as
one sustaining the person of God himself; for he brought nothing of his
own, but what the Lord commanded him to proclaim. But as I have
elsewhere enlarged on this subject, I now only touch on it briefly.

<span id="iv.1.ii-p11"></span>This vision, he says, was given him
against two cities *Samaria* and *Jerusalem*  <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) It is certain that the Prophet was
specifically sent to the Jews; and Maresah, from which he arose, as it
appears from the inscription, was in the tribe of Judah: for Morasthite
was an appellative, derived from the place Maresah.  <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) But it may be asked, why does he say that
visions had been given him against Samaria? We have said elsewhere, that
though Hosea was specifically and in a peculiar manner destined for the
kingdom of Israel, he yet by the way mingled sometimes those things
which referred to the tribe or kingdom of Judah: and such was also the
case with our Prophet; he had a regard chiefly to his own kindred, for
he knew that he was appointed for them; but, at the same time, he
overlooked not wholly the other part of the people; for the kingdom of
Israel was not so divided from the tribe of Judah that no connection
remained: for God was unwilling that his covenant should be abolished by
their defection from the kingdom of David. We hence see, that though
Micah spent chiefly his labors in behalf of the Jews, he yet did not
overlook or entirely neglect the Israelites.

<span id="iv.1.ii-p14"></span>But the title must be restricted to one
part of the book; for threatenings only form the discourse here. But we
shall find that promises, full of joy, are also introduced. The
inscription then does not include all the contents of the book; but as
his purpose was to begin with threatenings, and to terrify the Jews by
setting before them the punishment that was at hand, this inscription
was designedly given. There is, at the same time, no doubt but that the
Prophet was ill received by the Jews on this account; for they deemed it
a great indignity, and by no means to be endured, to be tied up in the
same bundle with the Israelites; for Samaria was an abomination to the
kingdom of Judah; and yet the Prophet here makes no difference between
Samaria and Jerusalem. This was then an exasperating sentence: but we
see how boldly the Prophet performs the office committed to him; for he
regarded not what would be agreeable to men, nor endeavored to draw them
by smooth things: though his message was disliked, he yet proclaimed it,
for he was so commanded, nor could he shake off the yoke of his
vocation. Let us now proceed —

<span id="iv.1.iii"></span>

<span id="iv.1.iii-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.iii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.1.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.iii-p2"></span>**2.** Hear, all ye people; hearken, O
earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against
you, the Lord from his holy temple.

<span id="iv.1.iii-p3"></span>**2.** Audite populi omnes, ausculta terra
et plenitudo ejus, et sit Dominus Jehova vobis (vel, inter vos, vel,
contra vos, potius) in testem, et Dominus e palatio (vel, templo)
sanctitatis suae.

<span id="iv.1.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.iii-p5"></span><span id="iv.1.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.iii-p6"></span>The Prophet here rises into an elevated
style, being not content with a simple and calm manner of speaking. We
hence may learn, that having previously tried the disposition of the
people, he knew the stubbornness of almost all classes: for except he
was persuaded that the people would be rebellious and obstinate, he
would certainly have used some mildness, or have at least endeavored to
lead them of their own accord rather than to drive them thus violently.
There is then no doubt but that the obstinacy of the people and their
wickedness were already fully known to him, even before he began to
address one word to them. But this difficulty did not prevent him from
obeying God’s command. He found it necessary in the meantime to add
vehemence to his teaching; for he saw that he addressed the deaf, yea,
stupid men, who were destitute of every sense of religion, and who had
hardened themselves against God, and had not only fallen away through
want of thought, but had also become immersed in their sins, and were
wickedly and abominably obstinate in them. Since then the Prophet saw
this, he makes here a bold beginning, and addresses not only his own
nation, for whom he was appointed a Teacher; but he speaks to the whole
world.

<span id="iv.1.iii-p7"></span>For what purpose does he say, *Hear, all
ye people?*  <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) It was not certainly
his object to proclaim indiscriminately to all the truth of God for the
same end: but he summons here all nations as witnesses or judges, that
the Jews might understand that their impiety would be made evident to
all, except they repented, and that there was no reason for them to hope
that they could conceal their baseness, for God would expose their
hidden crimes as it were on an open stage. We hence see how emphatical
are the words, when the Prophet calls on all nations and would have them
to be witnesses of the judgment which God had resolved to bring on his
people.

<span id="iv.1.iii-p12"></span>He afterwards adds, *Let also the earth
give ear and its fullness* We may take the earth, by metonymy, for its
inhabitants; but as it is added, *and its fullness,* the Prophet, I
doubt not, meant here to address the very earth itself, though it be
without reason. He means that so dreadful would be the judgment of God,
as to shake created things which are void of sense; and thus he more
severely upbraids the Jews with their stupor, that they heedlessly
neglected the word of God, which yet would shake all the elements by its
power.

<span id="iv.1.iii-p13"></span>He then immediately turns his discourse
to the Jews: after having erected God’s tribunal and summoned all the
nations, that they might form as it were a circle of a solemn company,
he says, *There will be for me the Lord Jehovah against you for a
witness* — *the Lord from the temple of his holiness.* By saying that
God would be as a witness for him, he not only affirms that he was sent
by God, but being as it were inflamed with zeal, he appeals here to God,
and desires him to be present, that the wickedness and obstinacy of the
people might not be unpunished; as though he said, “Let God, whose
minister I am, be with me, and punish your impiety; let him prove that
he is the author of this doctrine, which I declare from his mouth and by
his command; let him not suffer you to escape unpunished, if ye do not
repent.”

<span id="iv.1.iii-p14"></span>We now then perceive the meaning of the
Prophet, when he says that God would be for him a witness; as though he
had said, that there was no room here to trifle; for if the Jews thought
to elude God’s judgment they greatly deceived themselves; inasmuch as
when he has given a command to his servants to treat with his people, he
is at the same time present as a judge, and will not suffer his word to
be rejected without immediately undertaking his own cause.

<span id="iv.1.iii-p15"></span>Nor is this addition superfluous, *The
Lord from the temple of his holiness:* for we know how thoughtlessly the
Jews were wont to boast that God dwelt in the midst of them. And this
presumption so blinded them that they despised all the Prophets; for
they thought it unlawful that any thing should be said to their
disgrace, because they were the holy people of God, his holy heritage
and chosen nation. Inasmuch then as the Lord had adopted them, they
falsely boasted of his favors. Since then the Prophet knew that the
people insolently gloried in those privileges, with which they had been
honored by God, he now declares that God would be the avenger of impiety
from his temple; as though he said, Ye boast that God is bound to you,
and that he has so bound up his faith to you as to render his name to
you a sport: he indeed dwells in his temple; but from thence he will
manifest himself as an avenger, as he sees that you are perverse in your
wickedness. We hence see that the Prophet beats down that foolish
arrogance, by which the Jews were inflated; yea, he turns back on their
own heads what they were wont boastingly to bring forward. After having
made this introduction, to awaken slumbering men with as much vehemence
as he could, he subjoins —

<span id="iv.1.iv"></span>

<span id="iv.1.iv-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.iv-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.1.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.iv-p2"></span>**3.** For, behold, the Lord cometh forth
out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of
the earth.

<span id="iv.1.iv-p3"></span>**3.** Quia ecce Jehova egreditur e loco
suo, et descendet, et calcabit super excelsa terrae:

<span id="iv.1.iv-p4"></span>**4.** And the mountains shall be molten
under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, *and*
as the waters *that are* poured down a steep place.

<span id="iv.1.iv-p5"></span>**4.** Et liquefient montes sub eo, et
solventur (vel, dehiscent) valles; sicut cera a conspectu ignis, sicut
aquae in locum inferiorem actae.

<span id="iv.1.iv-p6"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.iv-p7"></span><span id="iv.1.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.iv-p8"></span>The Prophet pursues the same subject; and
he dwells especially on this — that God would be a witness against his
people from his sanctuary. He therefore confirms this, when he says that
*God would come from his place* Some interpreters do at the same time
take this view — that the temple would hereafter be deprived of God’s
presence, and would hence become profane, according to what Ezekiel
declares. For as the Jews imagined that God was connected with them as
long as the temple stood, and this false imagination proved to them an
allurement, as it were, to sin, as on this account they took to
themselves greater liberty, — this was the reason why the Prophet
Ezekiel declares that God was no longer in the temple; and the Lord had
shown to him by a vision that he had left his temple, so that he would
no longer dwell there. Some, as I have said, give a similar explanation
of this passage; but this sense does not seem to suit the context. I
therefore take another view of this sentence — that God would go forth
from his place. But yet it is doubted what place the Prophet refers to:
for many take it to be heaven, and this seems probable, for immediately
after he adds, *Descend shall God, and he will tread on the high places
of the earth* This descent seems indeed to point out a higher place: but
as the temple, we know, was situated on a high and elevated spot, on
mount Zion, there is nothing inconsistent in saying that God descended
from his temple to chastise the whole of Judea as it deserved. Then the
going forth of God is by no means ambiguous in its meaning, for he means
that God would at length go forth, as it were, in a visible form. With
regard then to the place, I am inclined to refer it to the temple; and
this clause, I have no doubt, has proceeded from the last verse.

<span id="iv.1.iv-p9"></span>But why is going forth here ascribed to
God? Because the Jews had abused the forbearance of God in worshipping
him with vain ceremonies in the temple; and at the same time they
thought that they had escaped from his hand. As long then as God spared
them, they thought that he was, as it were, bound to them, because he
dwelt among them. Besides, as the legal and shadowy worship prevailed
among them, they imagined that God rested in their temple. But now the
Prophet says, “He will go forth: ye have wished hitherto to confine God
to the tabernacle, and ye have attempted to pacify him with your
frivolous puerilities: but ye shall know that his hand and his power
extend much farther: he shall therefore come and show what that majesty
is which has been hitherto a derision to you.” For when hypocrites set
to sale their ceremonies to God, do they not openly trifle with him, as
though he were a child? and do they not thus rob him of his power and
authority? Such was the senselessness of that people. The Prophet
therefore does not say without reason that God would go forth, that he
might prove to the Jews that they were deluded by their own vain
imaginations, when they thus took away from God what necessarily
belonged to him, and confined him to a corner in Judea and fixed him
there, as though he rested and dwelt there like a dead idol.

<span id="iv.1.iv-p10"></span>The particle, *Behold,* is emphatical: for
the Prophet intended here to shake off from the Jews their torpidity,
inasmuch as nothing was more difficult to them than to be persuaded and
to believe that punishment was nigh at hand, when they flattered
themselves that God was propitious to them. Hence that they might no
longer cherish this willfulness, he says, *Behold, come shall the Lord,
forth shall he go from his place* Isaiah has a passage like this in an
address to the people, <span id="iv.1.iv-p10.1"></span>[Isa
26](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.1.iv-p10.1"></span>;
but the object of it is different; for Isaiah intended to threaten the
enemies of the Church and heathen nations: but here Micah denounces war
on the chosen people, and shows that God thus dwelt in his temple, that
the Jews might perceive that his hand was opposed to them, as they had
so shamefully despised him, and, by their false imaginations reduced, as
it were, to nothing his power.

<span id="iv.1.iv-p11"></span>*He shall tread, he says, on the high
places of the earth.* By the high places of the earth I do not
understand superstitious places, but those well fortified. We know that
fortresses were then fixed, for the most part, on elevated situations.
The Prophet then intimates, that there would be no place into which
God’s vengeance would not penetrate, however well fortified it might be:
“No enclosures,” he says, “shall hinder God from penetrating into the
inmost parts of your fortresses; he shall tread on the high places of
the earth.” At the same time, I doubt not but that he alludes, by this
kind of metaphor, to the chief men, who thought themselves exempted from
the common lot of mankind; for they excelled so much in power, riches,
and authority, that they would not be classed with the common people.
The Prophet then intimates, that those, who were become proud through a
notion of their own superiority would not be exempt from punishment.

<span id="iv.1.iv-p12"></span><span id="iv.1.iv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.iv-p13"></span>And he afterwards adds, that this going
forth of God would be terrible, *Melt,* he says, *shall the mountains
under him* It hence appears, that the Prophet did not speak in the last
verse of the departure of God, as though he was going to forsake his own
temple, but that he, on the contrary, described his going forth from the
temple, that he might ascend his tribunal and execute punishment on the
whole people, and thus, in reality, prove that he would be a judge,
because he had been very daringly despised. Hence he says, *Melt shall
the mountains under him, the valleys shall be rent, or cleave, as wax
before the fire, as waters rolling into a lower place*  <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) The Prophets do not often describe God in
a manner so awful; but this representation is to be referred to the
circumstance of this passage, for he sets forth God here as the judge of
the people: it was therefore necessary that he should be exhibited as
furnished and armed with powers that he might stake such vengeance on
the Jews as they deserved. And other similar passages we shall hereafter
meet with, and like to those which we found in Hosea. God then is said
to melt the mountains, and he is said to strike the valleys with such
terror that they cleave under him; in short, he is said so to terrify
all elements, that the very mountains, however stony they may be, melt
like wax or like waters which flow, — because he could not otherwise
produce a real impression on a people so obstinate, and who, as it has
been said, so flattered themselves even in their vices.

<span id="iv.1.iv-p20"></span>We may further easily learn what
application to make of this truth in our day. We find the Papists
boasting of the title Church, and, in a manner, with vain confidence,
binding God to themselves, because they have baptism, though they have
adulterated it with their superstitions; and then, they think that they
have Christ, because they still retain the name of a Church. Had the
Lord promised that his dwelling would be at Rome, we yet see how foolish
and frivolous would be such boasting: for though the temple was at
Jerusalem, yet the Lord went forth thence to punish the sins of the
people, yea, even of the chosen people. We further know, that it is
folly to bind God now to one place, for it is his will that his name
should be celebrated without any difference through the whole world.
Wheresoever, then, the voice of the Gospel sounds, God would have us to
know that he is present there. What the Papists then proudly boast of —
that Christ is joined to them — will turn out to their own condemnation;
— why so? Because the Lord will prove that he is the avenger of so
impious and shameful a profanation, as they not only presumptuously lay
claim to his name, but also tear it in pieces, and contaminate it with
their sacrilegious abominations.

<span id="iv.1.iv-p21"></span>Again, since God is said to melt the
mountains with his presence, let us hence learn to rouse up all our
feelings whenever God comes forth not that we may flee to a distance
from him, but that we may reverently receive his word, so that he may
afterwards appear to us a kind and reconciled Father. For when we become
humble, and the pride and height of our flesh is subdued, he then
immediately receives us, as it were, into his gentle bosom, and gives us
an easy access to him, yea, he invites us to himself with all possible
kindness. That the Lord then may thus kindly receive us, let us learn to
fear as soon as he utters his voice: but let not this fear make us to
flee away but only humble us, so that we may render true obedience to
the word of the Lord. It follows —

<span id="iv.1.v"></span>

<span id="iv.1.v-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.v-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.1.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.v-p2"></span>**5.** For the transgression of Jacob *is*
all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What *is* the
transgression of Jacob? *is it* not Samaria? and what *are* the high
places of Judah? *are they* not Jerusalem?

<span id="iv.1.v-p3"></span>**5.** Propter scelus  <span
id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) Jacob totum hoc, et propter
transgressiones domus Israel: quod scelus Jacob? Annon Samaria? Et quae
excelsa Jehudah? Annon Jerusalem?

<span id="iv.1.v-p11"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.v-p12"></span><span id="iv.1.v-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.v-p13"></span>The Prophet teaches, in this verse, that
God is not angry for nothing; though when he appears rigid, men
expostulate with him, and clamor as though he were cruel. That men may,
therefore, acknowledge that God is a just judge, and that he never
exceeds moderation in punishments, the Prophet here distinctly states
that there was a just cause, why God denounced so dreadful a judgment on
his chosen people, — even because not only a part of the people, but the
whole body had, through their impiety, fallen away; for by the house of
Jacob, and by the house of Israel, he means that impiety had everywhere
prevailed, so that no part was untainted. The meaning then is, — that
the contagion of sin had spread through all Israel, that no portion of
the country was free from iniquity, that no corner of the land could
bring an excuse for its defection; the Lord therefore shows that he
would be the judge of them all, and would spare neither small nor great.

<span id="iv.1.v-p14"></span>We now then understand the Prophet’s object
in this verse: As he had before taught how dreadful would be God’s
vengeance against all the ungodly, so now he mentions their crimes, that
they might not complain that they were unjustly treated, or that God
employed too much severity. The Prophet then testifies that the
punishment, then near at hand, would be just.

<span id="iv.1.v-p15"></span>He now adds, *What is the wickedness of
Jacob?* The Prophet, no doubt, indirectly reproves here the hypocrisy
which ruled dominant among the people. For he asks not for his own
satisfaction or in his own person; but, on the contrary, he relates, by
way of imitation, (<span id="iv.1.v-p15.1"></span>μιμητικῶς, —
*imitatively*) what he knew to be ever on their lips, “Oh! what sort of
thing is this sin? Why! thou assumest here a false principle, — that we
are wicked men, ungodly and perfidious: thou does us a grievous wrong.”
Inasmuch, then, as hypocrites thought themselves pure, having wiped, as
it were, their mouths, whenever they eluded reproofs by their
sophistries, the Prophet borrows a question, as it were, from their own
lips, “Of what kind is this wickedness? Of what sort is that
transgression?” As though he said, “I know what ye are wont to do, when
any one of the Prophets severely reproves you; ye instantly contend with
him, and are ready with your objections: but what do you gain? If you
wish to know what your wickedness is, it is Samaria; and where your high
places are, they are at Jerusalem.” It is the same as if he had said, “I
do not here contend with the common people, but I attack the first men:
my contest then is with the princes themselves, who surpass others in
dignity, and are, therefore, unwilling to be touched.”

<span id="iv.1.v-p16"></span>But it sometimes happens that the common
people become degenerated, while some integrity remains among the higher
orders: but the Prophet shows that the diseases among the people
belonged to the principal men; and hence he names the two chief cities,
Jerusalem and Samaria, as he had said before, in the first verse, that
he proclaimed predictions against these: and yet it is certain, that the
punishment was to be in common to the whole people. But as they thought
that Jerusalem and Samaria would be safe, though the whole country were
destroyed, the Prophet threatens them by name: for, relying first on
their strength, they thought themselves unassailable; and then, the eyes
of nearly all, we know, were dazzled with empty splendor, powers and
dignity: thus the ungodly wholly forget that they are men, and what they
owe to God, when elevated in the world. So great an arrogance could not
be subdued, except by sharp and severe words, such as the Prophet, as we
see, here employs. He then says, that the *wickedness of Israel* was
*Samaria;* the fountain of all iniquities was the royal city, which yet
ought to have ruled the whole land with wisdom and justice: but what any
more remains, when kings and their counselors tread under foot all
regard for what is just and right, and having cast away every shame,
rise up in rebellion against God and men? When therefore kings thus fall
from their dignity, an awful ruin must follow.

<span id="iv.1.v-p17"></span>This is the reason why the Prophet says
that the wickedness of Israel was Samaria, that thence arose all
iniquities. But we must at the same time bear in mind, that the Prophet
speaks not here of gross crimes; but, on the contrary, he directs his
reproof against ungodly and perverted forms of worship; and this appears
more evident from the second clause, in which he mentions transgressions
in connection with the high places. We hence see, that all sins in
general are not here reproved, but their vicious modes of worship, by
which religion had been polluted among the Jews as well as the
Israelites. But it might seem very unjust, that the Prophet should
charge with sin those forms of worship in which the Jews laboriously
exercised themselves with the object of pacifying God. But we see how
God regards as nothing whatever men blend with his worship out of their
own heads. And this is our principal contest at this day with the
Papists; we call their perverted and spurious modes of worship
abominations: they think that what is heavenly is to be blended with
what is earthly. We diligently labor, they say, for this end — that God
may be worshipped. True; but, at the same time, ye profane his worship
by your inventions; and it is therefore an abomination. We now then see
how foolish and frivolous are those delusions, when men follow their own
wisdom in the duty of worshipping God: for the Prophet here, in the name
of God, fulminates, as it were, from heaven against all superstitions,
and shows that no sin is more detestable, than that preposterous caprice
with which idolaters are inflamed, when they observe such forms of
worship as they have themselves invented.

<span id="iv.1.v-p18"></span>Now with regard to the *high places,* we
must notice, that there was a great difference between the Jews and the
Israelites at that time as to idolatry. The Israelites had so fallen,
that they were altogether degenerated; nothing could be seen among them
that had an affinity to the true and legitimate worship of God: but the
Jews had retained some form of religion, they had not thus abandoned
themselves; but yet they had a mixture of superstitions; such as one
would find, were he to compare the gross Popery of this day with that
middle course which those men invent, who seem to themselves to be very
wise, fearing, forsooth, as they do, the offenses of the world; and
hence they form for us a mixture, I know not what, from the
superstitions of the Papacy and from the Reformation, as they call it.
Something like this was the mixture at Jerusalem. We however see, that
the Prophet pronounces the same sentence against the Jews and the
Israelites and that is, that God will allow nothing that proceeds from
the inventions of men to be joined to his word. Since then God allows no
such mixtures, the Prophet here says that there was no less sin on the
high places of Judea, than there was in those filthy abominations which
were then dominant among the people of Israel. But the remainder we must
defer until to-morrow.

<span id="iv.1.vi-p1"></span>Prayer.

<span id="iv.1.vi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that, since to a
perverse, and in every way a rebellious people, thou didst formerly show
so much grace, as to exhort them continually to repentance, and to
stretch forth thy hand to them by thy Prophets, — O grant, that the same
word may sound in our ears; and when we do not immediately profit by thy
teaching, O cast us not away, but, by thy Spirit, so subdue all our
thoughts and affections, that we, being humbled, may give glory to thy
majesty, such as is due to thee, and that, being allured by thy paternal
favor, we may submit ourselves to thee, and, at the same time, embrace
that mercy which thou offerest and presentest to us in Christ, that we
may not doubt but thou wilt be a Father to us, until we shall at length
enjoy that eternal inheritance, which has been obtained for us by the,
blood of thine only-begotten Son. Amen.

<span id="iv.1.viii"></span>

<span id="iv.1.viii-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.viii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.1.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.viii-p2"></span>**6.** Therefore I will make Samaria as
an heap of the field, *and* as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour
down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the
foundations thereof.

<span id="iv.1.viii-p3"></span>**6.** Et ponam Samariam (hoc est, ideo;
enim hic sumitur pro illativa particula; ponam igitur Samariam) in
acervum agri, in plantationes vinae; et devolvam in vallem lapides ejus,
et fundamenta ejus retegam.

<span id="iv.1.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.viii-p5"></span><span id="iv.1.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.viii-p6"></span>Though Micah intended especially to
devote his services to the Jews, as we have said yesterday, he yet, in
the first place, passes judgment on Samaria; for it was his purpose
afterwards to speak more fully against Jerusalem and the whole of Judea.
And this state of the case ought to be borne in mind; for the Prophet
does not begin with the Israelites, because he directs his discourse
peculiarly to them; but his purpose was briefly to reprove them, and
then to address more especially his own people, for it was for this
purpose that he was called. Now, as he threatens destruction to Samaria
and the whole kingdom of Israel on account of their corrupted forms of
worship, we may hence learn how displeasing to God is superstition, and
that he regards nothing so much as the true worship of his name. There
is no reason here for men to advance this position — that they do not
designedly sin; for God shows how he is to be worshipped by us.
Whenever, then, we deviate in any thing from the rule which he has
prescribed, we manifest, in that particular, our rebellion and
obstinacy. Hence the superstitious ever act like fools with regard to
God, for they will not submit to his word, so as to be thereby alone
made wise.

<span id="iv.1.viii-p7"></span>And he says, *I will set Samaria as an
heap of the field,* that is, such shall be the ruins that they shall
differ nothing from the heaps of the fields: for husband men, we know,
when they find stones in their fields, throw them into some corner, that
they may not be in the way of the slough. Like such heaps then, as are
seen in the fields, Samaria would be, according to what God declared. He
then says, that the place would be empty, so that *vines* would be
*planted* there; and, in the third place, that its *stones* would be
*scattered* through the *valley;* as when one casts stones where there
is a wide plain, they run and roll far and wide; so would be the
scattering of Samaria according to what the Prophet says, it was to be
like the rolling of stones in a wide field. He adds, in the fourth
place, *I will uncover her foundations,* that is, I will entirely
demolish it, so that a stone, as Christ says, may not remain on a stone,
(<span id="iv.1.viii-p7.1"></span>[Mt
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.1.viii-p7.1"></span>.) We now perceive the import of the words;
and we also perceive that the reason why the Prophet denounces on
Samaria so severe a judgment was, because it had corrupted the
legitimate worship of God with its own inventions; for it had devised,
as we well know, many idols, so that the whole authority of the law had
been abolished among the Israelites. It now follows —

<span id="iv.1.ix"></span>

<span id="iv.1.ix-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.ix-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.1.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.ix-p2"></span>**7.** And all the graven images thereof
shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned
with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she
gathered *it* of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the
hire of an harlot.

<span id="iv.1.ix-p3"></span>**7.** Et omnia sculptilia  <span
id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) ejus diruentur, et omnes mercedes ejus
exurentur igne (*alii transferunt*, donaria,) et omnia idola ejus ponam
in vastitatem; quia e mercede meretricis congregavit, et ad mercedem
meretricis revertentur.

<span id="iv.1.ix-p6"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.ix-p7"></span><span id="iv.1.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.ix-p8"></span>The Prophet goes on with the same subject,
and says, that the ruin of Samaria was at hand, so that its idols would
be broken, and also, that its wealth would be destroyed which she had
gathered by illegitimate means, and which she thought to be the reward
of her idolatry. But God mentions idols here expressly by his Prophet,
in order to confirm what we noticed yesterday — that the cause of
vengeance was, because Samaria had abandoned itself to ungodly forms of
worship, and had departed from the Law. That the Israelites might then
understand the cause for which God would so severely punish them, the
Prophet here makes express mention of their graven images and idols. God
is not indeed angry with stones and wood; but he observes the abuse and
the perversion of them, when men pollute themselves by wickedly
worshipping such things. This is the reason why God says here that the
graven images of Samaria would be broken in pieces, and that its idols
would be destroyed.

<span id="iv.1.ix-p9"></span>With regard to the *wages,* the Prophet no
doubt designed to stamp with disgrace all the wealth of Samaria. <span
id="iv.1.ix-p9.1"></span>אתנן, *atanen,* is properly a gift or a
present. But as he twice repeats it, and says, that what Samaria
possessed was the *reward of an harlot,* and then, that it would *return
to the reward* *of an harlot,* he, in the first place, I have no doubt,
upbraids the Israelites, because they, after the manner of harlots and
strumpets, had heaped together their great riches: and this was done by
Jeroboam, who constructed a new form of worship, in order to secure his
own kingdom. The Israelites then began to flourish; and we also know how
wealthy that kingdom became, and how proud they were on account of their
riches. As, then, the Israelites despised the kingdom of Judah, and
thought themselves in every way happy, and as they ascribed all this, as
we have seen in Hosea, to their superstitions, Micah speaks here
according to their view of things, when he says, Idolatry has been
gainful to you, this splendor dazzles your eyes; but your rewards I have
already doomed to the burning: they shall then be burnt, and thus
perish. Hosea also, as we have seen, made use of the same comparison, —
that the children of Israel felicitated themselves in their impiety,
like a harlot, who, while she gains many presents from those who admire
her beauty, seems not conscious of her turpitude and baseness: such were
the Israelites. The Prophets therefore does not say, without reason,
*Behold, your rewards, by burning, shall perish,* or, be consumed with
fire. Why so? Because ye have gathered them, he says, from the reward of
an harlot, and all this shall return to the reward of an harlot.

<span id="iv.1.ix-p10"></span>This last clause ought to be restricted to
the gifts or wealth of Samaria; for it cannot properly be applied to
idols or graven images. The import of the whole then is that God would
be the avenger of idolatry with regard to the city of Samaria and the
whole kingdom of Israel. Besides, as the Israelites boasted that their
ungodly forms of worship turned out to their happiness and prosperity,
God declares that the whole of this success would be evanescent, like
that of the harlot, who amasses great wealth, which soon vanishes away:
and we see that thus it commonly happens.

<span id="iv.1.ix-p11"></span>Some explain the passage thus, — that the
gifts, with which the Israelites adorned their temples, would return to
be the reward of an harlot, that is, would he transferred to Chaldea,
and that the Babylonians would, in their turn, adorn with them their
idols. But this view is not suitable to the place; for the Prophet does
not say that what Samaria had gathered would be a prey or a spoil to
enemies but that it would perish by fire.  <span
id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) He speaks therefore, proverbially when he
says that the produce, from the reward of an harlot, would return to be
the reward of an harlot, that is, that it would become nothing; for the
Lord sets a curse on such riches as strumpets gain by their baseness,
while they prostitute themselves. Since, then, the whole of such wealth
is under the curse of God, it must necessarily soon pass away like
smoke: and this, in my view, is the real meaning of the Prophet. It now
follows —

<span id="iv.1.x"></span>

<span id="iv.1.x-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.x-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.1.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.x-p2"></span>**8.** Therefore I will wail and howl, I
will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and
mourning as the owls.

<span id="iv.1.x-p3"></span>**8.** Super hoc plangam et ululabo; incedam
spoliatus et nudus; faciam planctum tanquam draconum, et luctum tanquam
filiarum struthionis:  <span id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md)

<span id="iv.1.x-p8"></span>**9.** For her wound *is* incurable; for it
is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, *even* to
Jerusalem.

<span id="iv.1.x-p9"></span>**9.** Quia acerbae sunt plagae ejus (est
mutatio numeri;) quia venit usque ad Jehudam; accessit ad portam populi
mei, ad Jerusalem.

<span id="iv.1.x-p10"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.x-p11"></span><span id="iv.1.x-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.x-p12"></span>The Prophet here assumes the character of a
mourner, that he might more deeply impress the Israelites; for we have
seen that they were almost insensible in their torpidity. It was
therefore necessary that they should be brought to view the scene
itself, that, seeing their destruction before their eyes they might be
touched both with grief and fear. Lamentations of this kind are
everywhere to be met with in the Prophets, and they ought to be
carefully noticed; for we hence gather how great was the torpor of men,
inasmuch as it was necessary to awaken them, by this form of speech, in
order to convince them that they had to do with God: they would have
otherwise continued to flatter themselves with delusions. Though indeed
the Prophet here addresses the Israelites, we ought yet to apply this to
ourselves; for we are not much unlike the ancient people: for however
God may terrify us with dreadful threatening, we still remain quiet in
our filth. It is therefore needful that we should be severely treated,
for we are almost void of feeling.

<span id="iv.1.x-p13"></span>But the Prophets sometimes assumed
mourning, and sometimes they were touched with real grief: for when they
spoke of aliens and also of the enemies of the Church, they introduce
these lamentations. When a mention is made of Babylon or of Egypt, they
sometimes say, *Behold, I will mourn, and my bowels shall be as a
timbrel*. The Prophets did not then really grieve; but, as I have said,
they transferred to themselves the sorrows of others, and ever with this
object, that they might persuade men that God’s threatenings were not
vain, and that God did not trifle with men when he declared that he was
angry with them. But when the discourse was respecting the Church and
the faithful, then the Prophets did not put on grief. The representation
here is then to be taken in such a way as that we may understand that
the Prophet was in real mourning, when he saw that a dreadful ruin was
impending over the whole kingdom of Israel. For though they had
perfidiously departed from the Law, they were yet a part of the holy
race, they were the children of Abraham, whom God had received into
favor. The Prophet, therefore, could not refrain from mourning
unfeignedly for them. And the Prophet does here these two things, — he
shows the fraternal love which he entertained for the children of
Israel, as they were his kindred, and a part of the chosen people, — and
he also discharges his own duty; for this lamentation was, as it were,
the mirror in which he sets before them the vengeance of God towards men
so extremely torpid. He therefore exhibits to them this representation,
that they might perceive that God was by no means trifling with men,
when he thus denounced punishment on the wicked and such as were
apostates.

<span id="iv.1.x-p14"></span>Moreover, he speaks not of a common
lamentation, but says, *I will wail and howl,* and then, *I will go
spoiled* The word <span id="iv.1.x-p14.1"></span>אנושה, *shulal,* some
take as meaning one out of his mind or insane, as though he said, “I
shall be now as one not possessed of a sound mind.” But as this metaphor
is rather unnatural, I prefer the sense of being spoiled; for it was the
custom with mourners, as it is well known, to tear and to throw away
their garments from them. *I will* then *go spoiled and naked;* and
also, I will make wailing, not like that of men, but like the wailing of
dragons: I will mourn, he says, as the ostriches are wont to do. In
short, the Prophet by these forms of speech intimates, that the coming
evil would by no means be of an ordinary kind: for if he adopted the
usual manner of men, he could not have set forth the dreadfulness of
God’s vengeance that was impending.

<span id="iv.1.x-p15"></span><span id="iv.1.x-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.x-p16"></span>He afterwards subjoins, that the wounds
vault be grievous; but he speaks as of what was present, *Grievous,* he
says, *are the wounds* Grievous means properly full of grief; others
render it desperate or incurable, but it is a meaning which suits not
this place; for <span id="iv.1.x-p16.1"></span>אנושה, *anushe,* means
what we express in French by douloureuse. *The wounds,* then, *are full
of grief: for it came,* (something is understood; it may suitably be
referred to the enemy, or, what is more approved, to the slaughter) — It
came then, that is, the slaughter,  <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md)
*to Judah; it has reached to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem
itself.* He says first, to Judah, speaking of the land; and then he
confines it to the cities; for when the gates are closed up against
enemies, they are forced to stop. But the Prophet says, that the cities
would be no hindrance to the enemies to approach the very gates and even
the chief city of Judah, that is, Jerusalem; and this, we know, was
fulfilled. It is the same then as though he said that the whole kingdom
of Israel would be so laid waste, that their enemies would not he
content with victory, but would proceed farther and besiege the holy
city: and this Sennacherib did. For after having subverted the kingdom
of Israel, as though it was not enough to draw the ten tribes into
exile, he resolved to take possession of the kingdom of Judah; and
Jerusalem, as Isaiah says, was left as a tent. We hence see that the
threatening of the Prophet Micah were not in vain. It now follows —

<span id="iv.1.xi"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xi-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.xi-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.1.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xi-p2"></span>**10.** Declare ye *it* not at Gath, weep
ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.

<span id="iv.1.xi-p3"></span>**10.** In Gath ne annuntietis, flendo ne
fleatis;  <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md) propter domum Aphrah
pulvere te involve (*vel*, voluta te in pulvere.)

<span id="iv.1.xi-p5"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.xi-p6"></span><span id="iv.1.xi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xi-p7"></span>The Prophet seems here to be inconsistent
with himself: for he first describes the calamity that was to be evident
to all; but now he commands silence, lest the report should reach the
enemies. But there is here nothing contradictory; for the evil itself
could not be hid, since the whole kingdom of Israel would be desolated,
the cities demolished or burnt, the whole country spoiled and laid
waste, and then the enemies would enter the borders of Judah: and when
Jerusalem should have been nearly taken how could it have been
concealed? No, this could not have been. There is no wonder then that
the Prophet had referred here to a solemn mourning. But he now speaks of
the feeling of those who were desirous of hiding their own disgrace,
especially from their enemies and aliens: for it is an indignity which
greatly vexes us, when enemies taunt us, and upbraid us in our
misfortunes; when no hope remains, we at least wish to perish in secret,
so that no reproach and disgrace should accompany our death; for
dishonor is often harder to be borne, and wounds us more grievously,
than any other evil. The Prophet then means that the Israelites would
not only be miserable, but would also be subject to the reproaches and
taunts of their enemies. We indeed know that the Philistine were
inveterate in their hatred to the people of God; and we know that they
ever took occasion to upbraid them with their evils and calamities.

<span id="iv.1.xi-p8"></span>This then is the meaning of the Prophet,
when he says, *In Gath declare it not, by weeping weep not;* as though
he said, “Though extreme evils shall come upon you, yet seek to perish
in silence; for you will find that your enemies will gape for the
opportunity to cut you with their taunts, when they shall see you thus
miserable. He then forbids the people’s calamities to be told in Gath;
for the Philistine usually desired nothing more than the opportunity to
torment the people of God with reproaches.

<span id="iv.1.xi-p9"></span>It now follows, *In the house of Aphrah, in
dust roll thyself* There is here an alliteration which cannot be
conveyed in Latin: for <span id="iv.1.xi-p9.1"></span>עפרה, *ophre,*
means dusty, and <span id="iv.1.xi-p9.2"></span>עפר, *opher,* is dust.
That city attained its name from its situation, because the country
where it was, was full of dust; as if a city were called Lutosa, muddy
or full of clay; and indeed many think that Lutetia (Paris) had hence
derived its name. And he says, *Roll thyself in dust, in the house full
of dust;* as though he had said that the name would be now most
suitable, for the ruin of the city would constrain all neighboring
cities to be in mourning to cast themselves in the dust; So great would
be the extremity of their evils.

<span id="iv.1.xi-p10"></span>But we must ever bear in mind the object
of the Prophet: for he here rouses the Israelites as it were with the
sharpest goads, who entertained no just idea of the dreadfulness of
God’s vengeance, but were ever deaf to all threatening. The Prophet then
shows that the execution of this vengeance which he denounced was ready
at hand; and he himself not only mourned, but called others also to
mourning. He speaks of the whole country, as we shall see by what
follows. I shall quickly run over the whole of this chapter; for there
is no need of long explanation, as you will find.

<span id="iv.1.xii"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xii-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.xii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.1.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xii-p2"></span>**11.** Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of
Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth
in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.

<span id="iv.1.xii-p3"></span>**11.** Transi pariter (ad verbum, transi
vobis  <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) habitatrix Saphir, nuda
probrose; non egredietur habitatrix Zaanan in luctu Beth-Aezel, sumet a
vobis stationem suam (alii vertunt, substantiam; sed male, meo judicio.)

<span id="iv.1.xii-p5"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.xii-p6"></span><span id="iv.1.xii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xii-p7"></span>The Prophet here addresses the cities
which were on the borders of the kingdom of Israel, and through which
the enemy would pass in entering the kingdom of Judah. He therefore bids
the inhabitants of the city Saphir to pass over, and says, that the city
would be ashamed or in a shameful manner naked. The word <span
id="iv.1.xii-p7.1"></span>שפיר, *shaphir,* means splendid. He then says,
“Thou art now beautiful, but the Lord will discover thy shame, so that
thy nakedness shall be a shame to all, and the greatest disgrace to
thyself.” There is a correspondence in the words, though not an
alliteration. Hence the Prophet says, that though the city was called
splendid, it would yet be deformed, so that no one would deign to look
on it, at least without feeling shame. There is the same correspondence
in the word Zaanan; for <span id="iv.1.xii-p7.2"></span>צעה, *tsoe,*
means to transfer, as <span id="iv.1.xii-p7.3"></span>צען, *tson,* is to
migrate. Hence the Prophet says, *Go forth shall not the inhabitant of
Zaanan for the mourning of Beth-Aezel;* that is, he will remain quiet at
home: this he will do contrary to what will be natural; for whence is
the name of the city? even from removing, for it was a place of much
traffic. But he will remain, he says, at home: though he may see his
neighbors dragged into exile, he will not dare to move from his place.

<span id="iv.1.xii-p8"></span>He now adds, *Take will the enemy from you
his station.* The verb <span id="iv.1.xii-p8.1"></span>עמד, *omad,*
means to stand; nor is there a doubt but that when the Prophet says, He
will take from you his standing, he speaks of the standing or station of
the enemy: but interpreters however vary here. Some understand, that
when the enemy had continued long in the land, they would not depart
before they possessed the supreme power; as though he said, “Ye will
think that your enemy can be wearied out with delay and tediousness,
when not able soon to conquer your cities: this, he says, will not be
the case; for he will resolutely persevere, and his expectation will not
disappoint him; for he will receive the reward of his station, that is,
of his delay.” But some say, He will receive his station from you. They
explain the verb <span id="iv.1.xii-p8.2"></span>לקח, *lakech,*
metaphorically, as meaning to receive instruction from hand to hand; as
though the Prophet had said, Some, that is, your neighbors, will learn
their own position from you. What does this mean? Zaanan will not go
forth on account of the mourning of its neighboring city Aezel: others
will afterwards follow this example. How so? For Zaanan will be, as it
were, the teacher to other cities; as it will not dare to show any sign
of grief for its neighbors, being not able to succor them; so also, when
it shall be taken in its turn into exile, that is, its citizens and
inhabitants, its neighbors will remain quiet, as though the condition of
the miserable city was no object of their care. They shall then learn
from you their standing; that is, Ye will remain quiet and still, when
your neighbors will be destroyed; the same thing will afterwards happen
to you. But as this bears but little on the main subjects we may take
either of these views.  <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) It
afterwards follows —

<span id="iv.1.xiii"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xiii-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.1.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xiii-p2"></span>**12.** For the inhabitant of Maroth
waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the
gate of Jerusalem.

<span id="iv.1.xiii-p3"></span>**12.** Quia doluit propter bonum
(*alii,* expectavit ad bonum; *alii*, infirmata est) habitatrix Maroth;
quia descendit malum a Jehova ad portam Jerusalem.

<span id="iv.1.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.xiii-p5"></span><span id="iv.1.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xiii-p6"></span>The Prophet joins here another city even
Maroth, and others also in the following verses. But in this verse he
says, that Maroth would be in sorrow for a lost good. The verb <span
id="iv.1.xiii-p6.1"></span>חול, *chul,* means to grieve; and it has this
sense here; for the Marothites, that is, the inhabitants of that city,
would have to grieve for losing their property and their former happy
condition. But as the verb means also to expect, some approve of a
different exposition, that is, — that the inhabitants of the city Maroth
would in vain depend on an empty and fallacious expectation, for they
were doomed to utter destruction. In vain then will the inhabitant of
Maroth expect or entertain hope; for *an evil descends from Jehovah to
the gate of the city.* This view is very suitable, that is, that its
hope will disappoint Maroth, since even the city of Jerusalem shall not
be exempted. For though God had then by a miracle delivered the chief
city, and its siege was raised through the intervention of an angel,
when a dreadful slaughter, as sacred history records, took place; yet
the city Maroth was not then able to escape vengeance. We now see the
reason why this circumstance was added. Some give a harsher explanation,
— that the citizens of Maroth were to be debilitated, or, as it were,
demented. As this metaphor is too strained, I embrace the other, — that
the citizens of Maroth *would grieve for the loss of good,*  <span
id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) or that they would vainly expect or hope,
since they were already doomed to utter ruin, without any hope of
deliverance.

<span id="iv.1.xiii-p8"></span>But we must notice, that *evil was nigh
at hand from Jehovah,* for he reminds them, that though the whole
country would be desolated by the Assyrians, yet God would be the chief
leader, since he would employ the work of all those who would afflict
the people of Israel. That the Jews then, as well as the Israelites
might know, that they had to do, not with men only, but also with God,
the celestial Judge, the Prophet distinctly expresses that all this
would proceed from Jehovah. He afterwards adds —

<span id="iv.1.xiv"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xiv-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.1.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xiv-p2"></span>**13.** O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind
the chariot to the swift beast: she *is* the beginning of the sin to the
daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.

<span id="iv.1.xiv-p3"></span>**13.** Alliga currum ad camelum (vel,
dromedarium; alii vertunt, equos celeres) habitatrix Lachis: principium
sceleris ipsa est filiae Zion; quia in te inventae sunt transgressiones
Israel.

<span id="iv.1.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.xiv-p5"></span><span id="iv.1.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xiv-p6"></span>By bidding the citizens of Lachish to tie
their chariots to dromedaries he intimates that it would not be not safe
for them to remain in their city, and that nothing would be better for
them than to flee elsewhere and to carry away their substance. “Think,”
he says, “of flight, and of the quickest flight.” The word <span
id="iv.1.xiv-p6.1"></span>רכש, *recash*, which I render dromedary or
camel, is of an uncertain meaning among the Hebrews; some render it
swift horses: but we understand the Prophet’s meaning; for he intimates
that there would be no time for flight, except they made great haste,
for the enemies would come upon them quickly.

<span id="iv.1.xiv-p7"></span>And he then subjoins that that city had
been the beginning of sin to the Jews; for though he names here the
daughter of Zion, he still includes, by taking a part for it the whole,
all the Jews. And why he says that Lachish had been the beginning of sin
to the citizens of Jerusalem, we may collect from the next clauses, *In
thee,* he says, *were found the transgressions of Israel.* The citizens
of Lachish were then, no doubt, the first who had embraced the
corruptions of Jeroboam, and had thus departed from the pure worship of
God. When, therefore, contagion had entered that city, it crept, by
degrees, into neighboring places, until at length, as we find, the whole
kingdom of Judah had become corrupt: and this is what the Prophet
repeats more fully in other places. It was not then without reason that
he denounces desolation here on the citizens of Lachish; for they had
been the authors of sin to their own kindred. However alienated the ten
tribes had become from pure faith and pure worship, the kingdom of Judah
remained still upright, until Lachish opened the door to ungodly
superstitions; and then its superstitions spread through the whole of
Judea. She therefore suffered the punishment which she deserved, when
she was drawn away into distant exile, or, at least, when she could not
otherwise escape from danger, than by fleeing into some fear country,
and that very swiftly. *She is the beginning,* he says, *of sin to the
daughter of Zion* How so? For in thee — (it is more emphatical when the
Prophet turns his discourse to Lachish itself) — *in thee,* he says,
were found the transgressions of Israel. It follows —

<span id="iv.1.xv"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xv-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.xv-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#014.md)<span id="iv.1.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xv-p2"></span>**14.** Therefore shalt thou give presents
to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib *shall be* a lie to the kings of
Israel.

<span id="iv.1.xv-p3"></span>**14.** Propterea mittes dona super
Moreseth (*vel*, propter Moreseth-) Gath, filiis Achzib in mendacium
regibus Israel.

<span id="iv.1.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.xv-p5"></span><span id="iv.1.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xv-p6"></span>Here the Prophet alludes to another thing,
— that they would attempt to pacify their enemies with gifts, and would
try to redeem themselves and their neighbors. But the Prophet expressly
mentions this, that the event might teach them that nothing happens
without a design; for it ought to work a greater conviction in blind and
obstinate men, when they see that they really find that to be true which
had been long before predicted. This, then, is the reason why the
Prophet enumerates here various particulars; it was, that the hand of
God might be more evident and conspicuous when he would begin, in an
especial manner, to fulfill all the things which he now in words
foretells, *Thou,* he says, *wilt send a gift for Moreseth-gath;* that
is, for a neighboring city. And he calls it Moreseth-gath, to
distinguish it from another city of the same name. *Thou wilt then send
gifts for Moreseth-gath, to the sons of Achzib for a lie* <span
id="iv.1.xv-p6.1"></span>אכזיב, *aczib,* is a word derived from one
which means a lie. There is, therefore, a striking alliteration, when he
says, Thou wilt send gifts to the sons of <span
id="iv.1.xv-p6.2"></span>אכזיב, *Aczib*, for a lie, <span
id="iv.1.xv-p6.3"></span>לאכזב, *laaczeb*; that is Thou wilt send gifts
to the sons of a lie, for a lie. The city had obtained its name from its
fallacies or guiles. And he says, *for a lie to the kings of Israel;*
because it profited the children of Israel nothing to pacify them with
gifts or to attempt to draw them to their side, as they hired the
services of one another. So then he says, that they would be for a lie
to the kings of Israel, for they would gain nothing by having many
auxiliaries. Some take the words actively, — that the kings of Israel
had first deceived the citizens of Achzib: but this view is less
probable; I am therefore disposed to adopt the other, — that though the
citizens of Lachish tried to conciliate their neighbors with a great sum
of money, especially the people of Achzib, this would be yet to no
purpose; for it would be a lie to the people of Israel: or, it may be,
that the Prophet’s meaning is this, — that the citizens of Achzib had
already wished to bring aid, but in vain to the kings of Israel; for
Lachish was one of the first cities which the Assyrians conquered; but
it was within the kingdom of Judah, or on its borders. It is then
probable that the kings of Israel had recourse to the aid of this
people, and were not assisted. Now, as the citizens of Lachish also
endeavored to extricate themselves from the hand of their enemies by
such aid, the prophet derides such a folly, inasmuch as they did not
become wise by experience, having seen with their own eyes, that such an
help had been useless and deceptive to the kings of Israel: they ought
then to have tried some other means rather than to expose themselves to
the same deceptions.  <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) I cannot
finish the chapter to-day.

<span id="iv.1.xvi"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xvi-p1"></span>Prayer.

<span id="iv.1.xvi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that, being warned by
so many examples, the record of which thou hast designed to continue to
the end of the world, that we may learn how dreadful a judge thou art to
the perverse, — O grant, that we may not, at this day, be deaf to thy
teaching, which is conveyed to us by the mouth of thy Prophet, but that
we may strive to be so reconciled to thee, that, passing by all men, we
may present ourselves unreservedly to thee, so that, relying on thy
mercy alone which thou hast promised to us in Christ, we may not doubt
but thou wilt be propitious to us, and be so touched with the spirit of
true penitence, that, if we have been to others a bad example and an
offense, we may lead others to the right way of salvation, and each of
us may so endeavor to assist our neighbors in a holy life, that we may
together attain that blessed and celestial life, which thine
only-begotten Son has procured for us by his own blood. Amen.

1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.1.xviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xviii-p2"></span>**15.** Yet will I bring an heir unto
thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of
Israel.

<span id="iv.1.xviii-p3"></span>**15.** Adhuc possessorem mittam,  <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) tibi habitatrix Maresah; usque ad Adullam
veniet gloria Israel.

<span id="iv.1.xviii-p5"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.xviii-p6"></span><span id="iv.1.xviii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xviii-p7"></span>The Prophet here threatens his own birth
place, as he had done other cities; for, as we have stated, he sprung
from this city. He does not now spare his own kindred: for as God is no
respecter of persons, so also God’s servants ought, as with closed eyes,
to deal impartially with all, so as not to be turned here and there
either by favor or by hatred, but to follows without any change,
whatever the Lord commands them. We see that Micah was endued with this
spirit, for he reproved his own kindred, as he had hitherto reproved
others.

<span id="iv.1.xviii-p8"></span>There is a peculiar meaning in the word,
Mareshah, for it is derived from <span id="iv.1.xviii-p8.1"></span>ירש,
*iresh*, and it means possession. The Prophet now says, *I will send to
thee* <span id="iv.1.xviii-p8.2"></span>הורש*, euresh,* a possessor; the
word is from the same root.  <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) But he
means that the Morasthites would come into the power of their enemies no
less than their neighbors, of whom he had spoken before. He says, *to
Adullam* This was also a city in the tribe of Judah, as it is well
known. But some would have “enemy” to be here understood and they put
<span id="iv.1.xviii-p9.1"></span>כבוד, *cabud,* in the genitive case:
The enemy of the glory of Israel shall come to Adullam; but this is
strained. Others understand the passage thus that the glory of Israel
would come to disgrace; for Adullam, we know, was a cave. Since then it
an obscure place, the Prophet here, as they think, declares that the
whole glory of Israel would be covered with dishonor, because the
dignity and wealth, in which they gloried would lose their pristine
fixate, so that they would differ nothing from an ignoble cave. If any
approve of this meaning, I will not oppose them. Yet others think that
the Prophet speaks ironically and that the Assyrian is thus called
because the whole glory and dignity of Israel would by him be taken
away. But there is no need of confining this to enemies; we may then
take a simpler view, and yet regard the expression as ironical, — that
the glory, that is, the disgrace or the devastation of Israel, would
come to Adullam. But what if we read it, in apposition, He shall come to
Adullam, the glory of Israel? For Adullam was not obscure, as those
interpreters imagine, whom I have mentioned, but it is named among the
most celebrated cities after the return and restoration of the people.
When, therefore, the whole country was laid waste, this city, with a few
others, remained, as we read in the <span
id="iv.1.xviii-p9.2"></span>[Ne
11](../../../bib/kjv/neh011.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.1.xviii-p9.2"></span>.
It might then be, that the Prophet called Adullam the glory of Israel;
for it was situated in a safe place, and the inhabitants thought that
they were fortified by a strong defense, and thus were not open to the
violence of enemies. This meaning also may be probable; but still, as
the glory of Israel may be taken ironically for calamity or reproach if
any one approves more of this interpretation, it may be followed. I am,
however, inclined to another, — that the Prophet say, that the enemy
would come to Adullam, which was the glory of Israel,  <span
id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) because that city was as it were in the
recesses of Judea, so that an access to it by enemies was difficult. It
may be also that some may think, that the recollection of its ancient
history is here revived; for David concealed himself in its cave, and
had it as his fortress. The place no doubt had, from that time, attained
some fame; then this celebrity, as I have said, may be alluded to, when
Adullam is said to be the glory of Israel. It follows —

<span id="iv.1.xix"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xix-p1"></span><span id="iv.1.xix-p1.1"></span>[Micah
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.1.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xix-p2"></span>**16.** Make thee bald, and poll thee for
thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are
gone into captivity from thee.

<span id="iv.1.xix-p3"></span>**16.** Decalvare et tondeas te super
filiis delitiarum tuarum; dilata calvitium sicut aquila, quoniam
migrarunt abs te.

<span id="iv.1.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.1.xix-p5"></span><span id="iv.1.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xix-p6"></span>The Prophet at length concludes that
nothing remained for the people but lamentation; for the Lord had
resolved to desolate and destroy the whole country. Now they were wont
in mourning, as we have seen in other places, to shave and even tear off
their hair: and some think that the verb <span
id="iv.1.xix-p6.1"></span>קרחי, *korechi,* implies as much as though the
Prophet said “Pluck, tear, pull off your hair.” When afterwards he adds
<span id="iv.1.xix-p6.2"></span>רגזי, *regizi,* they refer it to
shavings which is done by a razor. However this may be, the Prophet here
means that the condition of the people would be so calamitous that
nothing would be seen anywhere but mourning.

<span id="iv.1.xix-p7"></span>*Make bald,* he says, *for the children of
thy delicacies*  <span id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) The Prophet here
indirectly upbraids those perverse men, who after so many warnings had
not repented, with the neglect of God’s forbearance: for whence did
those delicacies proceed, except from the extreme kindness of God in
long sparing the Israelites, notwithstanding their disobedience? The
Prophet then shows here that they had very long abused the patience of
God, while they each immersed themselves in their delicacies. Now, he
says, *Enlarge thy baldness as the eagle* Eagles are wont to cast off
their feathers; and hence he compares here bald men to eagles, as though
he called them, Hairless. As then the eagles are for a certain time
without feathers until they recover them; so also you shall be hairless,
even on account of your mourning. He says, *For they have migrated from
thee* He intimates that the Israelites would become exiles, that the
land might remain desolate. Now follows —

<span id="iv.1.ii-p8"></span> It is probable that the greater part of
his Prophecy was written in the days of this king; for a portion of what
is contained in the *third* chapter is referred to in <span

<span id="iv.1.ii-p12"></span> “He mentions Samaria first,” says
*Marckius,* “not because it was superior to Jerusalem, or more regarded
by the Prophet, but because it would be first in undergoing judgment, as
it had been first in transgression.” The preposition <span
id="iv.1.ii-p12.1"></span>על is rendered by some, “against,” and not
“concerning.” *Calvin* renders it in his version <span

There is another circumstance, besides that of his birth in the land of
Judah, which tends to prove his special mission to the Jews, — he

כלם, “Hear, ye peoples, all of them.” Were it not for a similar anomaly
as to number in the following line, “Give ear, thou earth, and its
fullness,” we might think that <span id="iv.1.iii-p8.2"></span>כלן is
here a mistake for <span id="iv.1.iii-p8.3"></span>כלכם, as it is
evidently the case in <span id="iv.1.iii-p8.4"></span>[1Sa
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.1.iii-p8.4"></span>,
and <span id="iv.1.iii-p8.5"></span>[Job
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.1.iii-p8.5"></span>;
for in these two places there are several MSS. Which have <span
id="iv.1.iii-p8.6"></span>כלכם, though here there is no variety. Some,
to get rid of the difficulty, have suggested that <span
id="iv.1.iii-p8.7"></span>כלם here is to be construed as an adverb,
“universally,” regarding it as assuming the same form with <span
id="iv.1.iii-p8.8"></span>חנם, “gratuitously,” and <span
id="iv.1.iii-p8.9"></span>ריקם, “vainly.” But such irregularity is
common in Hebrew; there is therefore no need of having recourse to such
expedients.

<span id="iv.1.iii-p9"></span>The word <span
id="iv.1.iii-p9.1"></span>עמים, peoples, may be rendered *nations*: for,
notwithstanding the dissent of *Drusius,* what *Horsley* says seems to
be correct, that <span id="iv.1.iii-p9.2"></span>עם in the plural number
designates the heathen nations, as distinguished from the people of
Israel. The verse literally is this, —

<span id="iv.1.iii-p10"></span>*Hear, ye nations,* — *all of them;  
Give ear, thou earth,* — *even its fullness;  
And the Lord Jehovah shall be against you a witness  
The Lord from the temple of his holiness.*

id="iv.1.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.iv-p14"></span> These two similes, as observed by
*Marckius* and others, refer not to the same thing, but to the two
things previously mentioned,—the wax, to the mountains,—and the waters,
to the valleys. This kind of order, in a sentence, is common in Hebrew.
The *Septuagint* presents an instance, not uncommon, of an attempt to
reconcile what, from not apprehending the sense, appeared incongruous;
for *motion* is ascribed to the mountains— <span
id="iv.1.iv-p14.1"></span>σαλευθησεται τα ορη, and *melting* to the
valleys—<span id="iv.1.iv-p14.2"></span>τακησονται, quite contrary to
the meaning of the words in Hebrew. *Newcome* renders the last line
thus, —

<span id="iv.1.iv-p15"></span>“As waters poured down a steep place.”

<span id="iv.1.iv-p16"></span>*Henderson* renders the last word, “a
precipice;” and *Marckius, declive*—”a declivity.” I would give this
version of the whole verse, —

<span id="iv.1.iv-p17"></span>For, behold, Jehovah shall go forth from
his place;  
Yea, he shall descend and tread on the high places of the land;  
And dissolve shall the mountains under him,  
And the valleys shall burst forth;  
Like the wax before the fire,  
Like waters rolling down a declivity.

<span id="iv.1.iv-p18"></span>The verb <span
id="iv.1.iv-p18.1"></span>בקע is applied to express the bursting out of
waters from a fountain, of the young when emerging from the egg, and of
light dispelling darkness. It is here in Hithpael, and only in one other
place, <span id="iv.1.iv-p18.2"></span>[Jos
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos009.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.1.iv-p18.2"></span>;
where it means the bursting of wine bottles, made of leather. The word
<span id="iv.1.iv-p18.3"></span>מורד is going down, descent, declivity,
<span id="iv.1.iv-p18.4"></span>καταβασις, *Sept.* See <span
id="iv.1.iv-p18.5"></span>[Jos
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#011.md)<span id="iv.1.iv-p18.5"></span>;
<span id="iv.1.iv-p18.6"></span>[Jer
48:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.1.iv-p18.6"></span>

<span id="iv.1.iv-p19"></span>“Do men trust to the height and strength
of mountains, as if they were sufficient to bear up their hopes and bear
off their fears? They shall be *molten* under him. — Do they trust to
the fruitfulness of the valleys and their products? They shall be cleft,
or rent, — and be wasted away as the ground is by the waters that are
poured down a steep place.” — *Henry.*

<span id="iv.1.v-p4"></span> <span id="iv.1.v-p4.1"></span>פשע, rendered
<span id="iv.1.v-p4.2"></span>*scelus* wickedness, by *Calvin*, means
evidently <span id="iv.1.v-p4.3"></span>*defectio* — defection —
apostacy, as rendered by *Junius* and *Tremelius.* <span
id="iv.1.v-p4.4"></span>חטאות, <span
id="iv.1.v-p4.5"></span>*transgressiones* — transgressions, rather,
sins. Several MSS. And the Septuagint have <span
id="iv.1.v-p4.6"></span>חטאת, *sin;* but the plural is more suitable to
this place, to correspond with the high places at the end of the verse.
It is evident, from the context that *Jacob* means Samaria or the ten
tribes, and that the *house,* or family of *Israel,* means what is not
usual, the tribe of Judah. (See <span id="iv.1.v-p4.7"></span>[2Ch
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#019)<span id="iv.1.v-p4.7"></span>..md)
Israel seems here to be taken as a special distinction of God’s people.
Judah was still in the name of the true Israel, while the ten tribes
were apostates from the faith.

<span id="iv.1.v-p5"></span>It is better to adopt the future tense in
this verse, that it may correspond with the preceding. When the
auxiliary verb is supplied, it must ever be regulated as to its tense by
the context. Then the first line should be, —

<span id="iv.1.v-p6"></span>*For the defection of Jacob* shall *all
this* be.

<span id="iv.1.v-p7"></span>Or it may be rendered, “*shall* all these
things *be,*” <span id="iv.1.v-p7.1"></span>כל-זאת; for <span
id="iv.1.v-p7.2"></span>זאת is plural as well as singular; and <span
id="iv.1.v-p7.3"></span>παντα ταυτα is the rendering of the Septuagint.

<span id="iv.1.v-p8"></span>*Grotius* and some others give this version
of the four last lines,—

<span id="iv.1.v-p9"></span>*What is* the origin *of the defection of
Jacob?  
Is it not Samaria?  
What is* the origin *of the high places of Judah?  
Is it not Jerusalem?*

<span id="iv.1.v-p10"></span>Who or what is the defection of Jacob? No
doubt means, Who is the author, or what is the cause or origin of his
defection? It is the same form of expression, as when it is said, that
God is our salvation, that is, the author of it. — *Ed.*

They were graven or carved images, made of wood, and overlaid with gold

<span id="iv.1.ix-p5"></span>“The *graven* image,” says *Bishop
Horsley,* “Was not a thing wrought in metal by the tool of the workman
we should now call an engraver; nor was the *molten* image an image made
of metal. In fact, the graven image and the molten image are the same
thing under different names. The images of the ancient idolaters were
first cut out of wood by the carpenter, as is very evident from the
Prophet Isaiah. This figure of wood was overlaid with plates, either of
gold or of silver, or, sometimes perhaps, of an inferior metal. And, in
this finished state, it was called a graven image, *i.e.,* a carved
image, in reference to the inner solid figure of wood, and a molten,
*i.e.,* an overlaid or covered image, in reference to the outward
metalline case or covering: and sometimes both epithets are applied to
it at once, ‘I will cut off the graven and molten image,’ <span

id="iv.1.ix-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.ix-p12"></span> The view given above is the one embraced
by *Henderson;* but the reason given here is improbable. *Newcome*
mentions the above, and also the following, “She imputed her wealth to
her spiritual idolatry, and her conquerors shall distribute it as the
reward of harlots in the literal sense.” But inasmuch as it is said,
that her rewards would be burnt, it is more consistent to take the last
clause as a proverbial expression, signifying the destruction of all the
wealth that was ascribed to idolatry as its source.

<span id="iv.1.ix-p13"></span>“It is common,” says *Henry*, “that what
is squeezed out by one lust, is squandered away by another.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_66"></span>[67](cc28010.htm#fr_66.md) <span
id="iv.1.x-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.x-p4"></span> All the verbs in this verse are in the
Septuagint in the third person, <span
id="iv.1.x-p4.1"></span>κοψεται—”she will mourn,” etc. The whole is
applied to Samaria. The Hebrew will admit of this sense, if the verbs be
considered to be, as they may be, in Hiphil, the omission of the <span
id="iv.1.x-p4.2"></span>ו is not uncommon. Then the rendering of the two
verses will be the following:—

<span id="iv.1.x-p5"></span>8. I will therefore make her to moan and
howl,  
I will cause her to go stripped and naked;  
I will make her to moan like the whales,  
And to wail like the ostriches:

<span id="iv.1.x-p6"></span>*9. For grievous* will be *her stroke;  
Yea it* will *come even to Judah,  
Reaching to the gate of my people*—*to Jerusalem.*

<span id="iv.1.x-p7"></span><span id="iv.1.x-p7.1"></span>תגים, rendered
“dragons” in our common version, and by Calvin, and by many others, is
rendered “foxes” by *Newcome,* “wolves” by *Henderson*, but by
*Bochart,* “whales,” or those species called “dolphins;” and *Professor
Lee,* in his Notes on <span id="iv.1.x-p7.2"></span>[Job
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.1.x-p7.2"></span>,
seems to be of the same opinion. The mournful groans of the dolphins,
when taken, are said to be extremely distressing; their doleful
moanings, too, in the night, when at liberty, have been testified by
historians. — <span id="iv.1.x-p7.3"></span>בכית יענה, “owls” in our
version, is rendered both by *Calvin* and *Newcome,* “daughters of the
ostrich,” and by *Henderson,* “ostriches.” The Septuagint has <span
id="iv.1.x-p7.4"></span>θυγατερων σειρηνων — “the daughters of
sea-monsters:” <span id="iv.1.x-p7.5"></span>στρουθοκαμηλων —
“camel-sparrows — ostriches,” is the rendering of *Aquila* and
*Symmachus.* The literal expression is, “the daughters of the ostrich,”
meaning evidently the females. *Dr. Shaw,* as quoted by *Newcome,* says,
“During the lonesome part of the night, they often make a very doleful
and hideous noise. I have often heard them groan, as if they were in the
greatest of agonies; an action beautifully alluded to by the Prophet
Micah.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_67"></span>[68](cc28010.htm#fr_67.md) <span
id="iv.1.x-p16.2"></span>

<span id="iv.1.x-p17"></span> Or rather the stroke before mentioned; for
the true reading is no doubt <span id="iv.1.x-p17.1"></span>מכתה, her
wound or her stroke, in the singular. Though there are but two MSS.
which have this reading, yet the previous participle noun, <span
id="iv.1.x-p17.2"></span>אנושה, being singular, and the following verbs
or participles being in the same number, favor this supposition. The
corresponding word in the Septuagint is also in the singular number —
<span id="iv.1.x-p17.3"></span>ἡ πληγη ἀυτης, her stroke, stripe or
scourge. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_68"></span>[69](cc28010.htm#fr_68.md) <span
id="iv.1.xi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xi-p4"></span> *Henderson* renders this clause, “weep not
in Acco,” and mentions *Gesenius* and others, who consider that <span
id="iv.1.xi-p4.1"></span>בכי is put here for <span
id="iv.1.xi-p4.2"></span>בעכו, and Ocu or Acco was a town in the tribe
of Asher; see <span id="iv.1.xi-p4.3"></span>[Jud
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg001.htm#031.md)<span id="iv.1.xi-p4.3"></span>.
The Septuagint favors this rendering, at least in one copy, for it has
<span id="iv.1.xi-p4.4"></span>εν ακείμ, though in Judges the name is
<span id="iv.1.xi-p4.5"></span>Ακχω. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_69"></span>[70](cc28010.htm#fr_69.md) <span
id="iv.1.xii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xii-p4"></span> <span id="iv.1.xii-p4.1"></span>עברי לכם,
pass over or migrate, as to you. One MS. Has <span
id="iv.1.xii-p4.2"></span>לך, as to thee; but the anomaly of number is
common through all the Prophets. “The inhabitant” here is a poetical
noun of number, including the whole people. What usage has thus
sanctioned in one language, cannot at all times be retained in another.
We must in the present instance make “Inhabitant” in our language
plural, or <span id="iv.1.xii-p4.3"></span>לכם, “as to you, or yea,
you,” singular. The latter is the best mode. Then as to the peculiar
form of <span id="iv.1.xii-p4.4"></span>לכס or <span
id="iv.1.xii-p4.5"></span>לך after an imperative, we have similar
instances; see <span id="iv.1.xii-p4.6"></span>[Ge
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.1.xii-p4.6"></span>;
<span id="iv.1.xii-p4.7"></span>[Jer
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.1.xii-p4.7"></span>;
<span id="iv.1.xii-p4.8"></span>[Ho
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.1.xii-p4.8"></span>.
It is an emphatic mode of speaking. The sentence here may be thus
expressed, “Pass thou over, yea, thou, O inhabitant of Saphir.” Amaziah
said to Amos, <span id="iv.1.xii-p4.9"></span>ברח לך, “Flee, yea, thou,”
etc. Or to give to <span id="iv.1.xii-p4.10"></span>ל its most usual
meaning, we may suppose “I say” to be understood; then it would be,
“Flee, *I say,* to thee.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_70"></span>[71](cc28010.htm#fr_70.md) <span
id="iv.1.xii-p8.3"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xii-p9"></span> This verse is variously rendered; by
*Newcome* thus,—

<span id="iv.1.xii-p10"></span>*Pass on, thou inhabitress of Saphir,
naked and in confusion.  
The inhabitants of Zanan went not forth to wailing.  
O Beth-Ezel, he shall receive of you* the reward of *his station*
against you.

<span id="iv.1.xii-p11"></span>By *Henderson* thus,—

<span id="iv.1.xii-p12"></span>Pass on, thou inhabitant of Shaphir,
naked and ashamed;  
The inhabitant of Zanan goeth not forth;  
The wailing of Beth-Ezel will take away continuance from you.

<span id="iv.1.xii-p13"></span>It seems more consistent to take all the
verbs in this and the preceding verse as imperatives, though they be not
in the same person. Those in the second are evidently so; and I would
render such as are in the third person as imperatives too. That Saphir,
Zaanan, etc, as well as those which follow, are not appellatives, but
proper names of places within or on the borders of Judah, is what is
allowed by most, though not by all, especially by some of the ancient
commentators, at least with regard to some of the names. I offer the
following version of the tenth and eleventh verses, —

<span id="iv.1.xii-p14"></span>10. In Gath declare ye it not, in Acco
weep not;  
In Beth-Ophrah, roll thyself in dust:

<span id="iv.1.xii-p15"></span>*11. Pass thou over, yea, thou, O
inhabitant of Saphir,  
Naked* and *in shame;  
Let not the inhabitant of Zaanan go forth wailing;  
Let Beth-Azel take from you its position;  
*that is, follow your example.

<span id="iv.1.xii-p16"></span>The last word, <span
id="iv.1.xii-p16.1"></span>עמדתו, presents the greatest difficulty. It
is found here alone in this form. It occurs as <span
id="iv.1.xii-p16.2"></span>עמד, a pillar, a station, <span
id="iv.1.xii-p16.3"></span>עמוד, a stand, stage, and as <span
id="iv.1.xii-p16.4"></span>מעמד, a standing, and also a state, <span
id="iv.1.xii-p16.5"></span>[Isa
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.1.xii-p16.5"></span>
*Buxtorf* gives the same meaning to the last with the one in the text,
<span id="iv.1.xii-p16.6"></span>*constitutio,* constitution, a fixed
order of things. The verb <span id="iv.1.xii-p16.7"></span>עמד signifies
to stand, to stand erect, to remain the same, either in motion or at
rest, to continue. Hence it may rightly signify a position, a standing,
that is taken and maintained.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[72](cc28010.htm#fr_71.md) <span
id="iv.1.xiii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xiii-p7"></span> *Grieving* is the idea commonly given to
the verb here used. “<span id="iv.1.xiii-p7.1"></span>Dolebit, will
grieve,” *Grotius,* — “<span id="iv.1.xiii-p7.2"></span>Parturit,
travails,” *Marckius,*—”Pineth,” *Henderson. Newcome,* following the
mere conjecture of *Houbigant* changes the original, and substitutes
<span id="iv.1.xiii-p7.3"></span>למות for <span
id="iv.1.xiii-p7.4"></span>לטוב, and gives this version, — “is sick unto
death.” Not only is this wholly unwarranted, but it destroys the evident
contrast there is in the verse — the good and the evil. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_72"></span>[73](cc28010.htm#fr_72.md) <span
id="iv.1.xv-p6.4"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xv-p7"></span> The two lines of this verse are improperly
connected, and the word “sons” is substituted for “houses,” <span
id="iv.1.xv-p7.1"></span>בתי, and there are no various readings, and the
Septuagint has “houses.” The literal rendering is this, —

<span id="iv.1.xv-p8"></span>*Therefore thou wilt send presents to
Moresheth-gath:  
The houses of Achzib will be a lie (*i.e., *false) to the kings of
Israel.*

<span id="iv.1.xv-p9"></span>*Henderson,* after Cocceius, gives a
different meaning to “presents,” <span id="iv.1.xv-p9.1"></span>שלוחים;
and he renders it “divorce,” and says that it signifies letters of
repudiation, and that it is to be taken here metaphorically for the
breaking up of connection. The word only occurs in two other places,
that is, in <span id="iv.1.xv-p9.2"></span>[Ex
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.1.xv-p9.2"></span>,
and in <span id="iv.1.xv-p9.3"></span>[1Ki
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.1.xv-p9.3"></span>;
and in neither does it mean what is alleged. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_73"></span>[74](cc28010.htm#fr_73.md) <span
id="iv.1.xviii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xviii-p4"></span> <span id="iv.1.xviii-p4.1"></span>אבי,
there is <span id="iv.1.xviii-p4.2"></span>א left out, which is supplied
in several MSS. It ought to be <span id="iv.1.xviii-p4.3"></span>אביא
which means, I will bring, rather than, I will send.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[75](cc28010.htm#fr_74.md) <span
id="iv.1.xviii-p8.4"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xviii-p9"></span> The instances of paranomasia or
alliteration in this passage, including this line and the five preceding
verses, are unparalleled in any other parts of the Prophets; and when
there is no coincidence of sound in the words, there is sometimes a
direct contrast in the ideas, as good and evil in verse12. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_75"></span>[76](cc28010.htm#fr_75.md) <span
id="iv.1.xviii-p9.3"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xviii-p10"></span> Of all the various renderings of this
clause, this is the most satisfactory, which is that of our own version.
The substitution of “honor” for “glory,” on the mere authority of the
Targum, as is done by *Newcome,* is wholly indefensible.

<span id="iv.1.xviii-p11"></span><span id="iv.1.xviii-p11.1"></span>Εως
Οδαλαμ ἤξει την δοξην Ισραηλ, *Symmachus.* At the same time, the most
obvious and natural construction of the clause is the following, though
its meaning is obscure; To Adullam shall come the glory of Israel. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_76"></span>[77](cc28010.htm#fr_76.md) <span
id="iv.1.xix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.1.xix-p8"></span> Or, “children of thy indulgences or
luxuries,” *i.e.,* luxurious children, rather than “darling children,”
as rendered by *Henderson.* The Septuagint has <span
id="iv.1.xix-p8.1"></span>τα τεκνα τα τρυφερα σου —”thy voluptuous
children.” The version of Newcome is, “thy delicate children.” What
seems to be intended is, their indulgence in pleasures and luxuries. —
*Ed.*
