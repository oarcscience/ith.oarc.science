<span id="iv.7-p1"></span>Chapter 7

<span id="iv.7.i"></span>

<span id="iv.7.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.i-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.7.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.i-p2"></span>**1.** Woe is me! for I am as when they have
gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: *there
is* no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.

<span id="iv.7.i-p3"></span>**1.** Vae mihi (*alii deducunt a* <span
id="iv.7.i-p3.1"></span>ילל*,* ululare meum; *sed est particula dolentis
apud Hebraeos;* Vae mihi *ergo*,) quia fui sicut collectiones aestatis
(*sic est ad verbum*,) et sicuti racemi vindemiae; nullus botrus ad
comedendum; maturos fructus (*vel,* primitias frugum) desideravit anima
mea.

<span id="iv.7.i-p4"></span>**2.** The good *man* is perished out of the
earth: and *there is* none upright among men: they all lie in wait for
blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.

<span id="iv.7.i-p5"></span>**2.** Periit humanus (*vel*, mansuetus) e
terra, et rectus in hominibus nemo est; et omnes sanguinibus
insidiantur, quisque fratrem suum venatur reti (*alii,* ad perniciem;
*et* <span id="iv.7.i-p5.1"></span>הרם*, etiam Hebraeis interdum est
occisio.*)

<span id="iv.7.i-p6"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.i-p7"></span><span id="iv.7.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.i-p8"></span>The meaning of the first verse is somewhat
doubtful: some refer what the Prophet says to punishment; and others to
the wickedness of the people. The first think that the calamity, with
which the Lord had visited the sins of the people, is bewailed; as
though the Prophet looked on the disordered state of the whole land. But
it may be easily gathered from the second verse, that the Prophet speaks
here of the wickedness of the people, rather than of the punishment
already inflicted. I have therefore put the two verses together, that
the full meaning may be more evident to us.

<span id="iv.7.i-p9"></span>*Woe* then *to me!* Why? *I am become as
gatherings* Too free, or rather too licentious is this version, — “I am
become as one who seeks to gather summer-fruits, and finds none;” so
that being disappointed of his hope, he burns with desire. This cannot
possibly be considered as the rendering of the Prophet’s words. There is
indeed some difficulty in the expressions: their import, however, seems
to be this, — that the land, which the Prophet undertakes here to
represent and personify, was like to a field, or a garden, or a
vineyard, that was empty. He therefore says, that the land was stripped
of all its fruit, as it is after harvest and the vintage. So by
*gatherings* we must understand the collected fruit. Some understand the
gleanings which remain, as when one leaves carelessly a few clusters on
the vines: and thus, they say, a few just men remained alive on the
land. But the former comparison harmonizes better with the rest of the
passage, and that is, that the land was now stripped of all its fruit,
as it is after the harvest and the vintage. *I am become* then *as the
gatherings of summer,* that is, as in the summer, when the fruit has
been already gathered; *and as the clusters of the vintage,* that is
when the vintage is over.  <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md)

<span id="iv.7.i-p13"></span>*There is no cluster, he says to eat.* The
Prophet refers here to the scarcity of good men; yea, he says that there
were no longer any righteous men living. For though God had ever
preserved some hidden seed, yet it might have been justly declared with
regard to the whole people, that they were like a field after gathering
the corn, or a vineyard after the vintage. Some residue, indeed, remains
in the field after harvest, but there are no ears of corn; and in the
vineyard some bunches remain, but they are empty; nothing remains but
leaves. Now this personification is very forcible when the Prophet comes
forth as though he represented the land itself; for he speaks in his own
name and person, *Woe is to me,* he says, *for I am like
summer-gatherings!* It was then the same thing, as though he deplored
his own nakedness and want, inasmuch as there were not remaining any
upright and righteous men.

<span id="iv.7.i-p14"></span><span id="iv.7.i-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.i-p15"></span>In the second verse he expresses more
clearly his mind, *Perished,* he says, *has the righteous*  <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) *from the land, and there is none
upright*  <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) *among men.* Here now
he does not personify the land. It was indeed a forcible and an emphatic
language, when he complained at the beginning, that he groaned as though
the land was ashamed of its dearth: but the Prophet now performs the
office of a teacher, *Perished,* he says, *has the righteous from the
land; there is no one upright among men; all lay in wait for blood;
every one hunts his brother as with a net* In this verse the Prophet
briefly shows, that all were full both of cruelty and perfidy, that
there was no care for justice; as though he said, In vain are good men
sought among this people; for they are all bloody, they are all
fraudulent. When he says, that they *all did lay in wait for blood,* he
no doubt intended to set forth their cruelty, as though he had said,
that they were thirsting for blood. But when he adds, that each did lay
in wait for their brethren, he alludes to their frauds or to their
perfidy.

<span id="iv.7.i-p18"></span>We now then perceive the meaning of the
Prophet: and the manner he adopts is more emphatical than if God, in his
own name, had pronounced the words: for, as men were fixed, and as
though drowned, in their own carelessness, the Prophet introduces here
the land as speaking, which accuses its own children, and confesses its
own guilt; yea, it anticipates God’s judgment, and acknowledges itself
to be contaminated by its own inhabitants, so that nothing pure remained
in it. It follows —

<span id="iv.7.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.7.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.ii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.7.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.ii-p2"></span>**3.** That they may do evil with both
hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge *asketh* for a reward;
and the great *man*, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it
up.

<span id="iv.7.ii-p3"></span>**3.** Super malitia manuum suarum ad
beneficiendum; princeps postulat, et judex in mercede (ego transfero ad
verbum,) et magnus loquitur pravitatem animae suae ipse; et complicant
(vel, ut alii vertunt, confirmant; sed proprie est complicari; et
metaphora apte convenit contextui, ut statim videbimus.)

<span id="iv.7.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.ii-p5"></span><span id="iv.7.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.ii-p6"></span>This verse is properly addressed to the
judges and governors of the people, and also to the rich, who oppressed
the miserable common people, because they could not redeem themselves by
rewards. The Prophet therefore complains, that corruptions so much
prevailed in judgments, that the judges readily absolved the most
wicked, provided they brought bribes. The sum of what is said then is,
that any thing might be done with impunity, for the judges were venal.
This is the Prophet’s meaning.

<span id="iv.7.ii-p7"></span>But as interpreters differ, something shall
be said as to the import of the words. <span id="iv.7.ii-p7.1"></span>על
הרע כפים, *ol ero caphim, For the evil of their hands* to do good. Some
give this explanation, “Though they are openly wicked, yet they make
pretenses, by which they cover their wickedness:” and the sense would be
this, — that though they had cast aside every care for what was right,
they yet had become so hardened in iniquity, that they wished to be
deemed good and holy men; for in a disordered state of things the wicked
always show an iron front, and would have silence to be observed
respecting their shameful deeds. Some interpreters therefore think that
the Prophet here complains, that there was now no difference between
what was honorable and base, right and wrong; for wicked men dared so to
disguise their iniquities, that they did not appear, or, that no one
ventured to say any thing against them. Do you, however, examine and
consider, whether what the Prophet says may be more fitly connected
together in this way, *That they may do good for the wickedness of their
hands,* that is, to excuse themselves for the wickedness of their hands,
they agree together; *for the prince asks, the judge is ready to receive
a bribe.* Thus, the rich saw that exemption might have been got by them,
for they had the price of redemption in their hands: they indeed knew
that the judges and princes could be pacified, when they brought the
price of corruption. And this is the meaning which I approve, for it
harmonizes best with the words of the Prophet. At the same time, some
give a different explanation of the verb <span
id="iv.7.ii-p7.2"></span>להיטיב, *laeithib,* that is that they acted
vigorously in their wickedness: but this exposition is frigid. I
therefore embrace the one I have just stated, which is, — that
corruptions so prevailed in the administration of justice, that
coverings were ready for all crimes; for the governors and judges were
lovers of money, and were always ready to absolve the most guilty, but
not without a reward. *For the wickedness then of their works, that they
may do good,* that is, that they may obtain acquittance, *the prince*
only *asks;* he examines not the case, but only regards the hand; *and
the judge,* he says, *judges for reward:* the judges also were
mercenary. They did not sit to determine what was right and just; but as
soon as they were satisfied by bribes, they easily forgave all crimes;
and thus they turned vices into virtues; for they made no difference
between white and black, but according to the bribe received.  <span
id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md)

<span id="iv.7.ii-p21"></span>This view is consistent with what the
Prophet immediately subjoins, *The great,* he says, *speaks of the
wickedness of his soul, even he* By the great, he does not mean the
chief men, as some incorrectly think, but he means the rich, who had
money enough to conciliate the judges. They then who could bring the
price of redemption, dared to boast openly of their wickedness: for so I
render the word <span id="iv.7.ii-p21.1"></span>הות, *eut,* as it cannot
be suitable to translate it here, corruption. *Speak* then *of the
wickedness of his soul does the great;* there was then nothing, neither
fear nor shame, to restrain the rich from doing wrong. — How so? For
they knew that they had to do with mercenary judges and could easily
corrupt them. They hence dared to *speak of the wickedness of their
soul:* they did not cloak their crimes, as it is the case when some fear
of the Law prevails, when justice is exercised: but as no difference was
made between good and evil, the most guilty boasted openly of his
wickedness. And the pronoun <span id="iv.7.ii-p21.2"></span>הוא, *eva*,
he himself, is also emphatical; and this has not been observed by
interpreters. *He* then *himself* speaks of the wickedness of his soul;
he did not wait until others accuse him of doing wrong, but he
shamelessly dared to glory in his crimes; for impunity was certain, as
he could close the mouth of the judges by bringing a bribe. *Speak* then
*of the wickedness of his soul does he himself.*  <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md)

<span id="iv.7.ii-p25"></span>And further, *they fold up* wickedness;
which means, that raging cruelty prevailed, because the governors, and
those who wished to purchase liberty to sin, conspired together; as
though they made ropes, and thus rendered firm their wickedness. For the
great man, that is, the rich and the monied, agreed with the judge, and
the judge with him; and so there was a collusion between them. It hence
happened, that wickedness possessed, as it were, a tyrannical power; for
there was no remedy. We now apprehend the real design of the Prophet, at
least as far as I am able to discover. It now follows —

<span id="iv.7.iii"></span>

<span id="iv.7.iii-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.iii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.7.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.iii-p2"></span>**4.** The best of them *is* as a brier:
the most upright *is sharper* than a thorn hedge: the day of thy
watchmen *and* thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.

<span id="iv.7.iii-p3"></span>**4.** Bonus inter eos quasi paliurus,
rectus prae spineto (aliquid subaudiendum est, asperior est spineto;)
dies speculatorum tuorum, visitatio tua venit; tunc erit confusio
ipsorum (vel, perplexitas, ut alii vertunt.)

<span id="iv.7.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.iii-p5"></span><span id="iv.7.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.iii-p6"></span>The Prophet confirms what he had
previously said, — that the land was so full of every kind of
wickedness, that they who were deemed the best were yet thorns and
briers, full of bitterness, or very sharp to prick; as though he said,
“The best among them is a thief; the most upright among them is a
robber.” We hence see, that in these words he alludes to their
accumulated sins, as though he said, “The condition of the people cannot
be worse; for iniquity has advanced to its extreme point: when any one
seeks for a good or an upright man, he only finds thorns and briers;
that is, he is instantly pricked.” But if the best were then like
thorns, what must have been the remainder? We have already seen that the
judges were so corrupt that they abandoned themselves without feeling
any shame to any thing that was base. What then could have been said of
them, when the Prophet compares here the upright and the just to thorns;
yea, when he says, that they were rougher than briers? Though it is an
improper language to say, that the good and the upright  <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) among them were like briers; for words
are used contrary to their meaning, as it is certain, that those who
inhumanely pricked others were neither good nor just: yet the meaning of
the Prophet is in no way obscure, — that there was then such license
taken in wickedness, that even those who retained in some measure the
credit of being upright were yet nothing better than briers and thorns.
There is then in the words what may be deemed a concession.

<span id="iv.7.iii-p10"></span>He then adds, *The day of thy watchmen,
thy visitation comes* He here denounces the near judgment of God,
generally on the people, and especially on the rulers. But he begins
with the first ranks and says *The day of thy watchmen;* as though he
said, “Ruin now hangs over thy governors, though they by no means expect
it.” *Watchmen* he calls the Prophets, who, by their flatteries,
deceived the people, as well as their rulers: and he sets the Prophets
in the front, because they were the cause of the common ruin. He does
not yet exempt the body of the people from punishment; nay, he joins
together these two things, — the visitation of the whole people, and the
day of the watchmen.

<span id="iv.7.iii-p11"></span>And justly does he direct his discourse
to these watchmen, who, being blind, blinded all the rest; and who,
being perverted, led astray the whole people. This is the reason why the
Prophet now, in an especial manner, threatens them; but, as I have
already said, the people were not on this account to be excused. There
may seem indeed to have been here a fair pretense for extenuating their
guilt: the common people might have said that they had not been warned
as they ought to have been; nay, that they had been destroyed through
delusive falsehoods. And we see at this day that many make such a
pretense as this. But a defense of this kind is of no avail before God;
for though the common people are blinded, yet they go astray off their
own accord, since they lend a willing ear to impostors. And even the
reason why God gave loose reins to Satan as well as to his ministers,
and why he gives, as Paul says, (<span id="iv.7.iii-p11.1"></span>[2Th
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.7.iii-p11.1"></span>,) power to delusion, is this, — because the
greater part of the world ever seeks to be deceived. The denunciation of
the Prophet then is this, — that as the judges and the Prophets had
badly exercised their office, they would be led to the punishment which
they deserved, for they had been, as it has been elsewhere observed, the
cause of ruin to others: in the meantime, the common people were not
excusable. The vengeance of God then would overtake them and from the
least to the greatest, without any exemption. *Thy visitation* then
*comes.*

<span id="iv.7.iii-p12"></span>He afterwards speaks in the third person,
*Then shall be their confusion,* or perplexity, or they shall be
ashamed. The Prophet here alludes indirectly to the hardness of the
people; for though the Prophets daily threatened them, they yet remained
all of them secure; nay, we know that all God’s judgments were held in
derision by them. As then the faithful teachers could not have moved
wicked men either with fear or with shame, the Prophet says, *Then
confusion shall come to them;* as though he said, “Be hardened now as
much as ye wish to be, as I see that you are stupid, yea, senseless, and
attend not to the word of the Lord; but the time of visitation will
come, and then the Lord will constrain you to be ashamed, for he will
really show you to be such as ye are; and he will not then contend with
you in words as he does now; but the announced punishment will divest
you of all your false pretenses; and he will also remove that
waywardness which now hardens you against wholesome doctrine and all
admonitions.”

<span id="iv.7.iv"></span>

<span id="iv.7.iv-p1"></span>Prayer.

<span id="iv.7.iv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that seeing that we
are born in a most corrupt age, in which such a license is taken to
indulge in wickedness, that hardly a spark of virtue appears, — O grant,
that we may yet continue upright in the midst of thorns; and do thou so
constantly keep us under the guidance of thy Word, that we may cultivate
true piety, and also what is just towards our neighbors: and as there is
in us no power to preserve ourselves safe, grant that thy Son may so
protect us by the power of the Holy Spirit, that we may continue to
advance towards the end of our course, until we be at length gathered
into that celestial kingdom, which he has procured for us by his own
blood. Amen.

<span id="iv.7.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.v"></span>

<span id="iv.7.v-p1"></span>Lecture Ninety-sixth

<span id="iv.7.vi"></span>

<span id="iv.7.vi-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.vi-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.7.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.vi-p2"></span>**5.** Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not
confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth
in thy bosom.

<span id="iv.7.vi-p3"></span>**5.** Ne fidatis amico, ne speretis in
consiliario (vel, duce;) ab ea quae dormit in sinu tuo custodi aperturas
oris tui:

<span id="iv.7.vi-p4"></span>**6.** For the son dishonoureth the father,
the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against
her mother in law; a man’s enemies *are* the men of his own house.

<span id="iv.7.vi-p5"></span>**6.** Quia filius contumelia afficit
patrem, filia surgit contra matrem suam, nurus contra socrum suam;
inimici viri domestici ejus (homines domus ejus, ad verbum.)

<span id="iv.7.vi-p6"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.vi-p7"></span><span id="iv.7.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.vi-p8"></span>The Prophet pursues the subject we
discussed yesterday, — that liberty, in iniquity, bad arrived to its
highest point, for no faithfulness remained among men; nay, there was no
more any humanity; for the son performed not his duty towards his
father, nor the daughter-in-law towards her mother-in-law; in short,
there was then no mutual love and concord. He does not here speak of
that false confidence, by which many deceive themselves, who rely on
mortals, and transfer to them the glory which belongs to God. Those
therefore without any reason, philosophize here, who say, that we ought
not to trust in men; for this was not the design of the Prophet. But our
Prophet complains of his times according to the tenor of Ovid’s
description of the iron age, who says -

<span id="iv.7.vi-p9"></span>*“*—*A guest is not safe from his host;  
Nor a brother-in-law from a son-in-law; and brotherly love is rare:  
A husband seeks the death of his wife, and she, of her husband;  
Cruel stepmothers mingle the lurid poison;  
The son, before the day, inquires into the years of his father.”*  <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md)

<span id="iv.7.vi-p11"></span>So also our Prophet says, that there was
no regard to humanity among men; for the wife was ready to betray her
husband, the son treated his father with reproach; in short, they had
all forgotten humanity or natural affection. We now then understand what
the Prophet means by saying, *Trust not a friend;*  <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) that is, if any one hopes for any
thing from a friend, he will be deceived; for nothing can be found among
men but perfidy.

<span id="iv.7.vi-p13"></span>*Put no faith in a counselor* So I render
the word <span id="iv.7.vi-p13.1"></span>אלוף, *aluph*; some translate
it, an elder brother; but there is no necessity to constrain us to
depart from the proper and true meaning of the word. As then the Prophet
had spoken of an associate or a friend, so he now adds a counselor. And
it proves what he had in view, when he says in the next clause, that no
enemies are worse than domestics. We hence see that the Prophet simply
means, that the men of his age were not only avaricious and cruel to one
another, but that without any regard to human feelings the son rebelled
against his father, and thus subverted the whole order of nature; So
that they had none of those affections, which seem at the same time to
be incapable of being extinguished in men. Let us now proceed —

<span id="iv.7.vii"></span>

<span id="iv.7.vii-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.vii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.7.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.vii-p2"></span>**7.** Therefore I will look unto the
Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.

<span id="iv.7.vii-p3"></span>**7.** Ego autem ad Jehovam respiciam,
expectabo ad Deum salutis meae; exaudiet me Deus meus.

<span id="iv.7.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.vii-p5"></span><span id="iv.7.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.vii-p6"></span>The Prophet points out here the only
remedy, to preserve the faithful from being led away by bad examples and
that is, to fix their eyes on God, and to believe that he will be their
deliverer. Nothing is more difficult than to refrain from doing wrong,
when the ungodly provoke us; for they seem to afford us a good reason
for retaliation. And when no one injures us, yet custom is deemed almost
a law: thus it happens that we think that to be lawful which is
sanctioned by the manners and customs of the age; and when success
attends the wicked, this becomes a very strong incentive. Thus it
happens, that the faithful can hardly, and with no small difficulty,
keep themselves within proper bounds: when they see that wickedness
reigns everywhere, and that with impunity; and still more, when they see
the abettors of wickedness increasing in esteem and wealth, immediately
the corrupt lust of emulation creeps in. But when the faithful
themselves are provoked by injuries, there seems then to be a just
reason for doing wrong; for they say that they willfully do harm to no
one, but only resist an injury done to them, or retaliate fraud with
fraud: this they think is lawful. The Prophet, in order to prevent this
temptation, bids the faithful to look to God. The same sentiment we
often meet with in <span id="iv.7.vii-p6.1"></span>[Psalm
119](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.7.vii-p6.1"></span>:
its import is, that the faithful are not to suffer themselves to be led
away by bad examples, but to continue ever obedient to God’s word,
however great and violent the provocations they may receive. Let us now
consider the words of the Prophet.

<span id="iv.7.vii-p7"></span>*To Jehovah,* he says, *will I look* The
verb <span id="iv.7.vii-p7.1"></span>צפה, *tsaphe,* properly means to
look on, to behold; (*speculari;*) it is sometimes taken in the sense of
expecting; but I am inclined to retain its proper meaning, *I will
look,* he says, *on God;* that is, I will do the same as though the only
true God were before my eyes. How indeed does it happen that even the
good indulge themselves while living among the wicked and ungodly,
except that they are too much occupied with things around them? If then
we desire to maintain integrity, while the world presents to us nothing
but examples of sin, let us learn to pass by these temptations as with
closed eyes. This may be done, if we direct our eyes to God alone. *I
will look,* he says, *to Jehovah*

<span id="iv.7.vii-p8"></span>He then adds, *I will wait for the God of
my salvation* The Prophet says nothing new here, but only explains more
clearly the last clause, defining the manner of the looking of which he
had spoken; as though he said, — “Patiently will I bear, while God helps
me:” for when the wicked harass us on every side, we shall no doubt soon
turn away our eyes from Gods except we be armed with patience. And how
comes patience, unless we be fully persuaded that God will be our
deliverer, when the suitable time shall come? We now perceive the
intention of the Prophet. He shows that the godly cannot otherwise
continue constant in their integrity, except they turn their eyes to the
only true God. Then he adds, that they cannot be preserved in this
contemplation, unless they wait patiently for God, that is, for his
help.

<span id="iv.7.vii-p9"></span>And he calls him *the God of his
salvation;* by which he intimates that, relying on his word, he thus
perseveres in enduring injuries: for it cannot be but that every one
will submit himself to God, and surrender himself to be protected by
him, if this truth be first fixed in his mind — that God will never
forsake his own people. This then is the reason why he calls him *the
God of his salvation.* But this title must be referred to his present
circumstances, as though he said, — “Though God’s hand does not now
appear to help or to bring me aid, I yet feel assured of his favor, and
I know that my salvation is secured by it.”

<span id="iv.7.vii-p10"></span>He then adds, *Hear me will my God* He
here confirms what we have already said, — that, being supported by the
promises of God, he thus composes his mind to patience; for patience
would often vanish or would be shaken off by temptations, unless we were
surely persuaded that God provides for our salvation, and that we shall
not hope in him in vain. Nor is it to no purpose that he says, that God
was his God. He was one of his people; and this seems to have been the
common privilege of all the Jews: yet the Prophet no doubt connects God
with himself here in a peculiar manner; for men in general had fallen
away into ungodliness. They all indeed gloried in the name of God, but
absurdly and falsely. Hence the Prophet intimates, that he was under his
protection in a manner different from the rest: for when any one allows
himself the liberty of doing evil, he, at the same time, renounces God
and his protection. Therefore, the Prophet no doubt alludes indirectly
to the irreligion of the people. For though the vain boasting, that they
had been adopted by God, that they were the holy race of Abraham, was
everywhere in the mouth of all, yet hardly one in a hundred had any
regard for God. But it is also of importance to notice, that the
Prophet, by saying, *Hear me will God,* gives a testimony, at the same
time, respecting his own faith, — that he would always apply to God for
help, and exercise himself in prayer whenever necessity urged him; for
God hears not except when he is called upon. The Prophet then recommends
here, by his example, an attention to prayer.

<span id="iv.7.vii-p11"></span>Now this verse shows to us in general
that there is no excuse for us if we suffer ourselves to be led away, as
it is daily the case, by bad examples. And then to look to God is
especially needful, when all excesses of wickedness prevail in the
world: when the lusts of men become the rule and the law, we ought then
to renounce in a manner the society of men, that they may not implicate
us in their wickedness. They, therefore, who allege for themselves the
examples of others, employ a frivolous excuse, as many do in the present
day, who set up the shield of custom: though they are clearly condemned
by the word of God, yet they think it a sufficient defense, that they
follow others. But we see how frivolous is this confidence; for the
Prophet no doubt prescribes here a law for all the children of God as to
what they ought to do, when the devil tempts them to sin by the bad
examples and shameful deeds of the majority. Let us go on —

<span id="iv.7.viii"></span>

<span id="iv.7.viii-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.viii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.7.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.viii-p2"></span>**8.** Rejoice not against me, O mine
enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD
*shall be* a light unto me.

<span id="iv.7.viii-p3"></span>**8.** Ne gaudeas de me, inimica mea;
quia ceciderim, surgam (vel, quamvis ceciderim, surgam;) quum sedebo in
tenebris, Jehova erit lux mihi.

<span id="iv.7.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.viii-p5"></span><span id="iv.7.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.viii-p6"></span>Here the Prophet assumes the character of
the Church and repels a temptation, which proves very severe to us in
adversities; for there is not so much bitterness in the evil itself, as
in the mockery of the wicked, when they petulantly insult us and deride
our faith. And to noble minds reproach is ever sharper than death
itself: and yet the devil almost always employs this artifice; for when
he sees that we stand firm in temptations, he suborns the wicked and
sharpens their tongues to speak evil of use and to wound us with
slanders. This is the reason why the Prophet directs his discourse now
to the enemies of the Church. But as God calls the Church his spouse,
and as she is described to us under the character of a woman, so also he
compares here the enemies of the holy people to a petulant woman. As,
therefore, when there is emulation between two women, she, who sees her
enemy pressed down by evils and adverse events, immediately raises up
herself and triumphs; so also the Prophet says respecting the enemies of
the Church; they sharpened their tongues, and vomited forth their
bitterness, as soon as they saw the children of God in trouble or nearly
overwhelmed with adversities. We now then understand the design of the
Prophet, — that he wished to arm us, as I have said, against the taunts
of the ungodly, lest they should prevail against us when God presses us
down with adversities, but that we may stand courageously, and with
composed and tranquil minds, swallow down the indignity.

<span id="iv.7.viii-p7"></span>*Rejoice not over me,* he says, *O my
enemy* Why not? He adds a consolation; for it would not be enough for
one to repel with disdain the taunts of his enemy; but the Prophet says
here, *Rejoice not, for should I fall, I shall rise;* or though I fall,
I shall rise: and the passage seems to harmonize better when there is a
pause after Rejoice not over me; and then to add, *Though I fall, I
shall rise, though I sit in darkness, Jehovah shall be a light to me*
 <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) The Prophet means, that the
state of the Church was not past hope. There would be ample room for our
enemies to taunt us, were it not that this promise cannot fail us, —
seven times in the day the just falls, and rises again, (<span
id="iv.7.viii-p10.2"></span>[Pr
24:16](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.7.viii-p10.2"></span>.) — How so? For God puts under him his own
hand. We now perceive the meaning of this passage. For if God deprived
us of all hope, enemies might justly deride us, and we must be silent:
but since we are surely persuaded that God is ready at hand to restore
us again, we can boldly answer our enemies when they annoy with their
derisions; though I fall, I shall rise: “There is now no reason for thee
to triumph over me when I fall; for it is God’s will that I should fall,
but it is for this end — that I may soon rise again; and though I now
lie in darkness, yet the Lord will be my light.”

<span id="iv.7.viii-p11"></span>We hence see that our hope triumphs
against all temptations: and this passage shows in a striking manner,
how true is that saying of John, — that our faith gains the victory over
the world, (<span id="iv.7.viii-p11.1"></span>[1Jo
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.7.viii-p11.1"></span>.) For when sorrow and trouble take
possession of our hearts, we shall not fail if this comes to our mind —
that God will be our aid in the time of need. And when men vomit forth
their poison against us, we ought to be furnished with the same weapons:
then our minds shall never succumb, but boldly repel all the taunts of
Satan and of wicked men. This we learn from this passage.

<span id="iv.7.viii-p12"></span>Now, from what the Prophet says, *Though
I fall, I shall rise again,* we see what God would have us to expect,
even a happy and joyful exit at all times from our miseries; but on this
subject I shall have to speak more copiously a little farther on. As to
the latter clause, *When I sit in darkness, God will be my light,* it
seems to be a confirmation of the preceding sentence, where the Prophet
declares, that the fall of the Church would not be fatal. But yet some
think that more is expressed, namely, that in the very darkness some
spark of light would still shine. They then distinguish between this
clause and the former one, which speaks of the fall and the rise of the
faithful, in this manner, — that while they lie, as it were, sunk in
darkness, they shall not even then be without consolation, for God’s
favor would ever shine on them. And this seems to be a correct view: for
it cannot be that any one will expect the deliverance of which the
Prophet speaks, except he sees some light even in the thickest darkness,
and sustains himself by partaking, in some measure, of God’s goodness:
and a taste of God’s favor in distresses is suitably compared to light;
as when one is cast into a deep pit, by raising upward his eyes, he sees
at a distance the light of the sun; so also the obscure and thick
darkness of tribulations may not so far prevail as to shut out from us
every spark of light, and to prevent faith from raising our eyes
upwards, that we may have some taste of God’s goodness. Let us proceed —

<span id="iv.7.ix"></span>

<span id="iv.7.ix-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.ix-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.7.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.ix-p2"></span>**9.** I will bear the indignation of the
LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and
execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, *and* I
shall behold his righteousness.

<span id="iv.7.ix-p3"></span>**9.** Iram Jehovae feram, quia peccavi ei,
donec disceptet causam meam et faciet judicium meum (vel, asserat jus
meum;) educet me in lucem, cernam justitiam ejus.

<span id="iv.7.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.ix-p5"></span><span id="iv.7.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.ix-p6"></span>Here the Church of God animates and
encourages herself to exercise patience, and does so especially by two
arguments. She first sets before herself her sins, and thus humbles
herself before God, whom she acknowledges to be a just Judge; and, in
the second place, she embraces the hope of the forgiveness of her sins,
and from this arises confidence as to her deliverance. By these two
supports the Church sustains herself, that she fails not in her
troubles, and gathers strength, as I have already said, to endure
patiently.

<span id="iv.7.ix-p7"></span>First then he says, *The wrath*  <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) *of Jehovah will I bear, for sinned
have I against him* This passage shows, that when any one is seriously
touched with the conviction of God’s judgment, he is at the same time
prepared to exercise patience; for it cannot be, but that a sinner,
conscious of evil, and knowing that he suffers justly will humbly and
thankfully submit to the will of God. Hence when men perversely glamour
against God, or murmur, it is certain that they have not as yet been
made sensible of their sins. I allow indeed that many feel guilty who
yet struggle against God, and fiercely resist his hand as much as they
can, and also blaspheme his name when he chastises them: but they are
not touched hitherto with the true feeling of penitence, so as to abhor
themselves. Judas owned indeed that he had sinned, and freely made such
confession, (<span id="iv.7.ix-p8.2"></span>[Mt
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#003)<span id="iv.7.ix-p8.2"></span>..md)
Cain tried to cover his sin, but the Lord drew from him an unwilling
confession, (<span id="iv.7.ix-p8.3"></span>[Ge
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#013)<span id="iv.7.ix-p8.3"></span>..md)
They did not yet repent; nay, they ceased not to contend with God; for
Cain complained that his punishment was too heavy to be borne; Judas
despaired. And the same thing happens to all the reprobate. They seemed
then to have been sufficiently convinced to acknowledge their guilt,
and, as it were, to assent to the justice of God’s judgment; but they
did not really know their sins, so as to abhor themselves, as I have
said, on account of their sins. For true penitence is ever connected
with the submission of which the Prophet now speaks. Whosoever then is
really conscious of his sins, renders himself at the same time obedient
to God, and submits himself altogether to his will. Thus repentance does
ever of itself lead to the bearing of the cross; so that he who sets
himself before God’s tribunal allows himself to be at the same time
chastised, and bears punishment with a submissive mind: as the ox, that
is tamed, always takes the yoke without any resistance, so also is he
prepared who is really touched with the sense of his sins, to bear any
punishment which God may be pleased to inflict on him. This then is the
first thing which we ought to learn from these words of the Prophet,
*The wrath of Jehovah will I bear, for sinned have I against him.*

<span id="iv.7.ix-p9"></span>We also learn from this passage, that all
who do not patiently bear his scourges contend with God; for though they
do not openly accuse God, and say that they are just, they do not yet
ascribe to him his legitimate glory, by confessing that he is a
righteous judge. — How so? Because these two things are united together
and joined by an indissoluble knot — to be sensible of sin — and to
submit patiently to the will of the Judge when he inflicts punishment.

<span id="iv.7.ix-p10"></span>Now follows the other argument, *Until he
decides my cause, and vindicates my right; he will bring me forth into
the light, I shall see his righteousness* Here the Church leans on
another support; for though the Lord should most heavily afflict her,
she would not yet cast aside the hope of deliverance; for she knew, as
we have already seen, that she was chastised for her good: and indeed no
one could even for a moment continue patient in a state of misery,
except he entertained the hope of being delivered, and promised to
himself a happy escape. These two things then ought not to be separated,
and cannot be, — the acknowledgment of our sins, which will humble us
before God, — and the knowledge of his goodness, and a firm assurance as
to our salvation; for God has testified that he will be ever propitious
to us, how much soever he may punish us for our sins, and that he will
remember mercy, as Habakkuk says, in the midst of his wrath, (<span
id="iv.7.ix-p10.1"></span>[Hab
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002)<span id="iv.7.ix-p10.1"></span>..md)
It would not then be sufficient for us to feel our evils, except the
consolation, which proceeds from the promises of grace, be added.

<span id="iv.7.ix-p11"></span>The Prophet shows further, that the Church
was innocent, with regard to its enemies, though justly suffering
punishment. And this ought to be carefully observed; for whenever we
have to do with the wicked, we think that there is no blame belonging to
us. But these two things ought to be considered, — that the wicked
trouble us without reason, and thus our cause as to them is just, — and
yet that we are justly afflicted by God; for we shall ever find many
reasons why the Lord should chastise us. These two things, then, ought
to be both considered by us, as the Prophet seems to intimate here: for
at the beginning of the verse he says, The wrath of God will I bear, for
sinned have I against him; and now he adds, The Lord will yet vindicate
my right, literally, “will debate my dispute,” that is, plead my cause.
Since the Church is guilty before God, nay, waits not for the sentence
of the judge, but anticipates it, and freely confesses herself to be
worthy of such punishment, what does this mean, — that the Lord will
decide her quarrel, that he will undertake her cause? These two things
seem to militate the one against the other: but they agree well together
when viewed in their different bearings. The Church had confessed that
she had sinned against God; she now turns her eyes to another quarter;
for she knew that she was unjustly oppressed by enemies; she knew that
they were led to do wrong by cruelty alone. This then is the reason why
the Church entertained hope, and expected that God would become the
defender of her innocence, that is, against the wicked: and yet she
humbly acknowledged that she had sinned against God. Whenever, then, our
enemies do us harm, let us lay hold on this truth, — that God will
become our defender; for he is ever the patron of justice and equity: it
cannot then be, that God will abandon us to the violence of the wicked.
He will then at length *plead our pleading,* or undertake our cause, and
be its advocate. But, in the meantime, let our sins be remembered by us,
that, being truly humbled before God, we may not hope for the salvation
which he promises to us, except through gratuitous pardon. Why then are
the faithful bidden to be of good comfort in their afflictions? Because
God has promised to be their Father; he has received them under his
protection, he has testified that his help shall never be wanting to
them. But whence is this confidence? Is it because they are worthy? Is
it because they have deserved something of this kind? By no means: but
they acknowledge themselves to be guilty, when they humbly prostrate
themselves before God, and when they willingly condemn themselves before
his tribunal, that they may anticipate his judgment. We now see how well
the Prophet connects together these two things, which might otherwise
seem contradictory.

<span id="iv.7.ix-p12"></span>Now follow the words, *He will bring me to
the light, I shall see his righteousness!*  <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) The Church still confirms herself in
the hope of deliverance: art it is hence also manifest how God is light
to the faithful in obscure darkness, because they see that there is
prepared for them an escape from their evils; but they see it at a
distance, for they extend their hope beyond the boundaries of this life.
As then the truth of God diffuses itself through heaven and earth, so
the faithful extend their hope far and wide. Thus it is, that they can
see light afar off, which seems to be very remote from them. And having
this confidence, the Prophet says, The Lord *will bring me into the
light.* They have, in the meantime, as I have already said, some light;
they enjoy a taste of God’s goodness in the midst of their evils: but
the Prophet now refers to that coming forth which we ought to look for
even in the worst circumstances.

<span id="iv.7.ix-p14"></span>He then adds, *I shall see his
righteousness* By God’s righteousness is to be understood, as it has
been elsewhere stated, his favor towards the faithful; not that God
returns for their works the salvation which he bestows, as ungodly men
foolishly imagine; for they lay hold on the word righteousness, and
think that whatever favors God freely grants us are due to our merits. —
How so? For God in this way shows his own righteousness. But far
different is the reason for this mode of speaking. God, in order to show
how dear and precious to him is our salvation, does indeed say, that he
designs to give an evidence of his justice in delivering us: but there
is a reference in this word righteousness to something else; for God has
promised that our salvation shall be the object of his care, hence he
appears just whenever he delivers us from our troubles. Then the
righteousness of God is not to be referred to the merits of works, but,
on the contrary, to the promise by which he has bound himself to us; and
so also in the same dense God is often said to be faithful. In a word,
the righteousness and faithfulness of God mean the same thing. When the
Prophet says now in the person of the Church, *I shall see his
righteousness,* he means, that though God concealed his favor for a
time, and withdrew his hand, so that no hope of aid remained, it could
not yet be, as he is just, but that he would succor us: *I shall see*
then *his righteousness,* that is, God will at length really show that
he is righteous. It now follows —

<span id="iv.7.x"></span>

<span id="iv.7.x-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.x-p1.1"></span>[Micah

<span id="iv.7.x-p5"></span>But I cannot finish the subject now.

<span id="iv.7.xi"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xi-p1"></span>Prayer.

<span id="iv.7.xi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that seeing we are at
this day surrounded by so many miseries, yea, wherever we turn our eyes,
innumerable evils meet us everywhere, which are so many evidences of thy
displeasure, — O grant, that we being truly humbled before thee, may be
enabled at the same time to raise up our eyes to the promises of thy
free goodness and paternal favor, which thou hast made to us in thine
own Son, that we may not doubt, but that thou wilt be propitious to us,
inasmuch as thou hast adopted us as thy people: and while our enemies,
fully armed, rage and ferociously rise even daily against us, may we not
doubt, but that thou wilt be our protection, as thou knowest that we are
unjustly troubled by them; and may we thus go on, trusting in thy
goodness, seeing that we ever groan under the, burden of our sins, and
daily confess that we are worthy of thousand deaths before thee, wert
not thou pleased in thine infinite mercy always to receive and restore
us to favor, through thy Son our Lord. Amen.

<span id="iv.7.xi-p3"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.xii"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xii-p1"></span>Lecture Ninety-seventh

<span id="iv.7.xii-p2"></span><span id="iv.7.xii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xii-p3"></span>In the last lecture I repeated the tenth
verse of the last chapter, in which the prophet adds, as a cause of the
greatest joy, that the enemies of the Church shall see granted, to their
great mortification, the wonderful favor of which the Prophet had been
speaking. But he describes these enemies, under the character of an
envious woman, as the Church of God is also compared to a woman: and
this mode of speaking is common in Scripture. He then calls Jerusalem
his rival, or Babylon, or some city of his enemies.

<span id="iv.7.xii-p4"></span>And he says, *Covered shall she be with
shame* We know that the ungodly grow insolent when fortune smiles on
them: hence in prosperity they keep within no bounds, for they think
that God is under their feet. If prosperity most commonly has the effect
of making the godly to forget God and even themselves, it is no wonder
that the unbelieving become more and more hardened, when God is
indulgent to them. With regard then to such a pride, the Prophet now
says, *When my enemy shall see, shame shall cover her;* that is, she
will not continue in her usual manner, to elate herself with her own
boastings: nay, she will be compelled for shame to hide herself; for she
will see that she had been greatly deceived, in thinking that I should
be wholly ruined.

<span id="iv.7.xii-p5"></span>He afterwards adds, *Who said to me, Where
is Jehovah thy God?* The Church of God in her turn triumphs here over
the unbelieving, having been delivered by divine power; nor does she do
this for her own sake, but because the ungodly expose the holy name of
God to reproach, which is very common: for whenever God afflicts his
people, the unbelieving immediately raise their crests, and pour forth
their blasphemies against God, when yet they ought, on the contrary, to
humble themselves under his hand. But since God executes his judgments
on the faithful, what can be expected by his ungodly despisers? If God’s
vengeance be manifested in a dreadful manner with regard to the green
tree, what will become of the dry wood? And the ungodly are like the dry
wood. But as they are blind as to God’s judgments, they petulantly
deride his name, whenever they see the Church afflicted, as though
adversities were not the evidences of God’s displeasure: for he
chastises his own children, to show that he is the judge of the world.
But, as I have already said, the ungodly so harden themselves in their
stupor, that they are wholly thoughtless. The faithful, therefore, after
having found God to be their deliverer, do here undertake his cause;
they do not regard themselves nor their own character, but defend the
righteousness of God. Such is this triumphant language, *Who said, Where
is now Jehovah thy God?* “I can really show that I worship the true God,
who deserts not his people in extreme necessity: after he has assisted
me, my enemy, who dared to rise up against God, now seeks
hiding-places.”

<span id="iv.7.xii-p6"></span>*She shall now,* he says, *be trodden
under foot as the mire of the streets; and my eyes shall see her.* What
the Prophet declares in the name of the Church, that the unbelieving
shall be like mire, is connected with the promise, which we already
noticed; for God so appears as the deliverer of his Church, as not to
leave its enemies unpunished. God then, while he aids his own people,
leads the ungodly to punishment. Hence the Church, while embracing the
deliverance offered to her, at the same time sees the near ruin, which
impends on all the despisers of God. But what is stated, *See shall my
eyes,* ought not to be so taken, as though the faithful exult with
carnal joy, when they see the ungodly suffering the punishment which
they have deserved; for the word to see is to be taken metaphorically,
as signifying a pleasant and joyful sight, according to what it means in
many other places; and as it is a phrase which often occurs, its meaning
must be well known. *See* then *shall my eyes,* that is, “I shall enjoy
to look on that calamity, which now impends over all the ungodly.” But,
as I have already said, carnal joy is not what is here intended, which
intemperately exults, but that pure joy which the faithful experience on
seeing the grace of God displayed and also his judgment. But this joy
cannot enter into our hearts until they be cleansed from unruly
passions; for we are ever excessive in fear and sorrow, as well as in
hope and joy, except the Lord holds us in, as it were, with a bridle. We
shall therefore be only then capable of this spiritual joy, of which the
Prophet speaks, when we shall put off all disordered feelings, and God
shall subdue us by his Spirit: then only shall we be able to retain
moderation in our joy. The Prophet proceeds —

<span id="iv.7.xiii"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.7.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p2"></span>**11.** *In* the day that thy walls are
to be built, *in* that day shall the decree be far removed.

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p3"></span>**11.** Dies ad aedificandum parietes
tuos; dies iste procul abiget edictum.

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p4"></span>**12.** *In* that day *also* he shall
come even to thee from Assyria, and *from* the fortified cities, and
from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and *from*
mountain to mountain.

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p5"></span>**12.** Die isto etiam ad te veniet ab
Assur, et urbibus munitionis, et a munitione etiam ad fluvium, et ad
mare a mari, et a monte ad montem.

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p6"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p7"></span><span id="iv.7.xiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p8"></span>Micah pursues the subject on which he had
previously spoken, — that though the Church thought itself for a time to
be wholly lost, yet God would become its deliverer. He says first, *that
the day was near, in which they were to build the wall.* The word <span
id="iv.7.xiii-p8.1"></span>גדר, *gidar,* means either a mound or a wall;
so it ought to be distinguished from a wall, that is, a strong fortress.
He then intimates that the time would come, when God would gather his
Church, and preserve it, as though it were defended on every side by
walls. For we know that the scattering of the Church is compared to the
pulling down of walls or fences: as when a person pulls down the fence
of a field or a vineyard, or breaks down all enclosures; so when the
Church is exposed as a prey to all, she is said to be like an open field
or a vineyard, which is without any fence. Now, on the other hand, the
Prophet says here, that the time would come, when the faithful shall
again build walls, by which they may be protected from the assaults and
plunder of enemies, *A day* then *to build thy walls*

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p9"></span>Then he adds, *This day shall drive afar
off the edict;* some render it tribute; but the word properly means an
edict, and this best suits the passage; for the Prophet’s meaning is,
that the people would not, as before, be subject to the tyranny of
Babylon. For after the subversion of Jerusalem, the Babylonians, no
doubt, triumphed very unfeelingly over the miserable people, and uttered
dreadful threatening. The Prophet, therefore, under the name of edict,
includes that cruel and tyrannical dominion which the Babylonians for a
time exercised. We know what God denounces on the Jews by Ezekiel,

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p10"></span>‘Ye would not keep my good laws;  
I will therefore give you laws which are not good,  
which ye shall be constrained to keep;  
and yet ye shall not live in them,’  
(<span id="iv.7.xiii-p10.5"></span>[Eze
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.7.xiii-p10.5"></span>.)

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p11"></span>Those laws which were not good were the
edicts of which the Prophet now speaks. *That day* then *shall drive far
away the edict,* that the Jews might not dread the laws of their
enemies. For the Babylonians no doubt forbade, under the severest
punishment, any one from building even a single house in the place where
Jerusalem formerly was; for they wished that place to remain desolate,
that the people might know that they had no hope of restoration. *That
day* then *shall put afar off;* or drive to a distance, *the edict;* for
liberty shall be given to the Jews to build their city; and then they
shall not tremblingly expect every hour, until new edicts come forth,
denouncing grievous punishments on whomsoever that would dare to
encourage his brethren to build the temple of God.

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p12"></span>Some draw the Prophet’s words to another
meaning: they first think that he speaks only of the spiritual kingdom
of Christ, and then they take <span id="iv.7.xiii-p12.1"></span>רחק,
*rechek,* in the sense of extending or propagating, and consider this to
be the Gospel which Christ, by the command of the Father, promulgated
through the whole world. It is indeed true that David uses the word
decree in <span id="iv.7.xiii-p12.2"></span>[Psalm
2](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.7.xiii-p12.2"></span>,
while speaking of the preaching of the Gospel; and it is also true, that
the promulgation of that decree is promised in <span
id="iv.7.xiii-p12.3"></span>[Psalm
110](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.7.xiii-p12.3"></span>,
‘The rod of his power will Jehovah send forth from Zion.’ But this
passage ought not to be thus violently perverted; for the Prophet no
doubt means, that the Jews would be freed from all dread of tyranny when
God restored them to liberty; and <span id="iv.7.xiii-p12.4"></span>רחק,
*rechek,* does not mean to extend or propagate, but to drive far away.
*That day* then *shall drive away the decree,* so that the faithful
shall be no more subject to tyrannical commands. We now perceive the
true meaning of the Prophet.

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p13"></span>The faithful doubtless prayed in their
adversities, and depended on such prophecies as we find in <span
id="iv.7.xiii-p13.1"></span>[Ps
102](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.7.xiii-p13.1"></span>,

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p14"></span>‘The day is now come to show mercy to
Zion, and to build its walls; for thy servants pity her stones.’

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p15"></span>Nor did the faithful pray thus
presumptuously, but taking confidence, as though God had dictated a form
of prayer by his own mouth, they dealt with God according to his
promise, “O Lord, thou hast promised the rebuilding of the city, and the
time has been prefixed by Jeremiah and by other Prophets: since then the
time is now completed, grant that the temple and the holy city may again
be built.”

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p16"></span>Some render the words, “In the day in
which thou shalt build (or God shall build) thy walls — in that day
shall be removed afar off the decree.” But I doubt not but that the
Prophet promises here distinctly to the faithful both the restoration of
the city and a civil freedom; for the sentence is in two parts: the
Prophet intimates first, that the time was now near when the faithful
would build their own walls, that they might not be exposed to the will
of their enemies, — and then he adds, that they would be freed from the
dread of tyranny; for God, as it is said by Isaiah, would break the yoke
of the burden, and the scepter of the oppressor, (<span
id="iv.7.xiii-p16.1"></span>[Isa
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.7.xiii-p16.1"></span>;) and it is altogether the same kind of
sentence.

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p17"></span><span id="iv.7.xiii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p18"></span>He afterwards adds, *In that day also to
thee shall they come from Asshur.* There is some obscurity in the words;
hence interpreters have regarded different words as being understood:
but to me the meaning of the Prophet appears not doubtful. *In that
day,* he says, *to thee shall they come from Asshur, and cities of the
fortress and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea,
and from mountain to mountain;* but some think <span
id="iv.7.xiii-p18.1"></span>הר, *er,* to be a proper name, and render
the last clause, “And from mount Hor:” and we know that Aaron was buried
on this mount. But the Prophet, no doubt, alludes here to some other
place; and to render it mount Hor is a strained version. I doubt not,
therefore, but that the Prophet repeats a common name, as though he
said, “From mountains to mountains.”

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p19"></span>Let us now see what the Prophet means.
With regard to the passage, as I have said, there is no ambiguity,
provided we bear in mind the main subject. Now the Prophet had this in
view, — That Jerusalem, when restored by God, would be in such honor
along all nations that there would be flowing to her from all parts. He
then says, that the state of the city would be very splendid, so that
people from all quarters would come to it: and therefore the copulative
vau is to be taken twice for *even* for the sake of emphasis, *In that
day, even to thee,* and then, *even to the river;* for it was not
believed that Jerusalem would have any dignity, after it had been
entirely destroyed, together with the temple. It is no wonder then that
the Prophet so distinctly confirms here what was by no means probable,
at least according to the common sentiments of men, — that Jerusalem
would attract to itself all nations, even those far away. *Come,* then,
*shall they,* (for the verb <span id="iv.7.xiii-p19.1"></span>יבוא,
*ibua,* in the singular number must be taken indefinitely as having a
plural meaning,) *Come,* then, *shall they from Asshur even to thee.*
But the Assyrians had previously destroyed every land, overturned the
kingdom of Israel, and almost blotted out its name; and they had also
laid waste the kingdom of Judah; a small portion only remained. They
came afterwards, we know, with the Chaldeans, after the seat of empire
was translated to Babylon, and destroyed Nineveh. Therefore, by naming
the Assyrians, he no doubt, taking a part for the whole, included the
Babylonians. *Come,* then, *shall they from Asshur,* and then, from the
cities of the fortress, that is, from every fortress. For they who take
<span id="iv.7.xiii-p19.2"></span>צור, *tsur,* for Tyre are mistaken;
for <span id="iv.7.xiii-p19.3"></span>מצור, *metsur*  <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) is mentioned twice, and it means
citadels and strongholds. And then, *even to the river,* that is, to
utmost borders of Euphrates; for many take Euphrates, by way of
excellence, to be meant by the word river; as it is often the case in
Scripture; though it might be not less fitly interpreted of any or every
river, as though the Prophet had said, that there would be no obstacle
to stop their course who would hasten to Jerusalem. *Even to the river*
then, and *from sea to sea,* that is, they shall come in troops from
remote countries, being led by the celebrity of the holy city; for when
it shall be rebuilt by God’s command, it shall acquire new and unusual
honor, so that all people from every part shall assemble there. And
then*, from mountain to mountain,* that is, from regions far asunder.
This is the sum of the whole.

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p24"></span>The Prophet then promises what all men
deemed as fabulous, — that the dignity of the city Jerusalem should be
so great after the return of the Jews from exile, that it would become,
as it were, the metropolis of the world. One thing must be added: They
who confine this passage to Christ seem not indeed to be without a
plausible reason; for there follows immediately a threatening as to the
desolation of the land; and there seems to be some inconsistency, except
we consider the Prophet here as comparing the Church collected from all
nations with the ancient people. But these things will harmonize well
together if we consider, that the Prophet denounces vengeance on the
unbelieving who then lived, and that he yet declares that God will be
merciful to his chosen people. But the restriction which they maintain
is too rigid; for we know that it was usual with the Prophets to extend
the favor of God from the return of the ancient people to the coming of
Christ. Whenever, then, the Prophets make known God’s favor in the
deliverance of his people, they make a transition to Christ, but
included also the whole intermediate time. And this mode the Prophet now
pursues, and it ought to be borne in mind by us. Let us go on —

<span id="iv.7.xiv"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xiv-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.7.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xiv-p2"></span>**13.** Notwithstanding the land shall be
desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their
doings.

<span id="iv.7.xiv-p3"></span>**13.** Et erit terra in desolationem
propter incolas suos, a fructu operorum ipsorum.

<span id="iv.7.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.xiv-p5"></span><span id="iv.7.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xiv-p6"></span>The Prophet, as I have already said, seems
to be inconsistent with himself: for after having spoken of the
restoration of the land, he now abruptly says, that it would be
deserted, because God had been extremely provoked by the wickedness of
the people. But, as I have stated before, it was almost an ordinary
practice with the Prophets, to denounce at one time God’s vengeance on
all the Jews, and then immediately to turn to the faithful, who were
small in number, and to raise up their minds with the hope of
deliverance. We indeed know that the Prophets had to do with the profane
despisers of God; it was therefore necessary for them to fulminate, when
they addressed the whole body of the people: the contagion had pervaded
all orders, so that they were all become apostates, from the highest to
the lowest, with very few exceptions, and those hidden amidst the great
mass, like a few grains in a vast heap of chaff. Then the Prophets did
not without reason mingle consolations with threatening; and their
threatening they addressed to the whole body of the people; and then
they whispered, as it were, in the ear, some consolation to the elect of
God, the few remnants, — “Yet the Lord will show mercy to you; though he
has resolved to destroy his people, ye shall yet remain safe, but this
will be through some hidden means.” Our Prophet then does, on the one
hand, as here, denounce God’s vengeance on a people past remedy; and, on
the others he speaks of the redemption of the Church, that by this
support the faithful might be sustained in their adversities.

<span id="iv.7.xiv-p7"></span>He now says, *The land shall be for
desolation*  <span id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) But why does he
speak in so abrupt a manner? That he might drive hypocrites from that
false confidence, with which they were swollen though God addressed not
a word to them: but when God pronounced any thing, as they covered
themselves with the name of Church, they then especially laid hold of
any thing that was said to the faithful, as though it belonged to them:
“Has not God promised that he will be the deliverer of his people?” as
though indeed he was to be their deliverer, who had alienated themselves
by their perfidy from him; and yet this was a very common thing among
them. Hence the Prophet, seeing that hypocrites would greedily lay hold
on what he had said, and by taking this handle would become more
audacious, says now, *The land shall be for desolation,* that is, “Be ye
gone; for when God testifies that he will be the deliverer of his
Church, he does not address you; for ye are the rotten members; and the
land shall be reduced to a waste before God’s favor, of which I now
speak, shall appear.” We now then perceive the reason for this passage,
why the Prophet so suddenly joined threatenings to promises: it was, to
terrify hypocrites.

<span id="iv.7.xiv-p9"></span>He says, *On account of its inhabitants,
from the fruit,* or, on account of the fruit *of their works* Here the
Prophet closes the door against the despisers of God, lest they should
break forth, according to their custom, and maintain that God was, as it
were, bound to them: “See,” he says, “what ye are; for ye have polluted
the land with your vices; it must therefore be reduced to desolation.”
And when the land, which is in itself innocent, is visited with
judgment, what will become of those despisers whose wickedness it
sustains? We hence see how emphatical was this mode of speaking. For the
Prophet summons here all the unbelieving to examine their life, and then
he sets before them the land, which was to suffer punishment, though it
had committed no sin; and why was it to suffer? because it was polluted
as I have said by their wickedness. Since this was the case, we see,
that hypocrites were very justly driven away from the false confidence
with which they were inflated, while they yet proudly despised God and
his Word. It now follows —

<span id="iv.7.xv"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xv-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.xv-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#014.md)<span id="iv.7.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xv-p2"></span>**14.** Feed thy people with thy rod, the
flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily *in* the wood, in the
midst of Carmel: let them feed *in* Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of
old.

<span id="iv.7.xv-p3"></span>**14.** Pasce populum tuum in virga tua
(vel, paedo tuo) gregem haereditatis tuae, habitantes in solitudine
(vel, seorsum) in sylva, in medio Carmeli; pascentur in Basan et Gilead,
secundum dies antiquos.

<span id="iv.7.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.xv-p5"></span><span id="iv.7.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xv-p6"></span>Here the Prophet turns to supplications and
prayers; by which he manifests more vehemence, than if he had repeated
again what he had previously said of the restoration of the Church; for
he shows how dreadful that judgment would be, when God would reduce the
land into solitude. This prayer no doubt contains what was at the same
time prophetic. The Prophet does not indeed simply promise deliverance
to the faithful, but at the same time he doubly increases that terror;
by which he designed to frighten hypocrites; as though he said, “Most
surely except God will miraculously preserve his own people, it is all
over with the Church: there is then no remedy, except through the
ineffable power of God.” In short, the Prophet shows, that he trembled
at that vengeance, which he had previously foretold, and which he did
foretell, lest hypocrites, in their usual manner, should deride him. We
now see why the Prophet had recourse to this kind of comfort, why he so
regulates his discourse as not to afford immediate hope to the faithful,
but addresses God himself. *Feed* then *thy people;* as though he said,
— “Surely that calamity will be fatal, except thou, Lord, wilt be
mindful of thy covenant, and gather again some remnant from the people
whom thou hast been pleased to choose: Feed thy people.”

<span id="iv.7.xv-p7"></span>The reason why he called them the people of
God was, because they must all have perished, unless it had been that it
was necessary that what God promised to Abraham should be fulfilled, —

<span id="iv.7.xv-p8"></span>‘In thy seed shall all nations be blessed,’
(<span id="iv.7.xv-p8.1"></span>[Ge
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003)<span id="iv.7.xv-p8.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.7.xv-p9"></span>It was then the adoption of God alone which
prevented the total destruction of the Jews. Hence he says emphatically,
— O Lord, these are yet thy people; as though he said, — “By whom wilt
thou now form a Church for thyself?” God might indeed have collected it
from the Gentiles, and have made aliens his family; but it was necessary
that the root of adoption should remain in the race of Abraham, until
Christ came forth. Nor was there then any dispute about God’s power, as
there is now among fanatics, who ask, Can God do this? But there was
reliance on the promise, and from this they learnt with certainty what
God had once decreed, and what he would do. Since then this promise, ‘By
thy seed shall all nations be blessed,’ was sacred and inviolable, the
grace of God must have ever continued in the remnant. It is indeed
certain, that hypocrites, as it has been already stated, without any
discrimination, abused the promises of God; but this truth must be ever
borne in mind, that God punished the ungodly, though relying on their
great number, they thought that they would be always preserved. God then
destroyed *them,* as they deserved; and yet it was his purpose, that
some remnant should be among that people. But it must be observed, that
this distinction ought not to be extended to all the children of
Abraham, who derived their origin from him according to the flesh, but
to be applied to the faithful, that is, to the remnant, who were
preserved according to the gratuitous adoption of God.

<span id="iv.7.xv-p10"></span>Feed then thy people *by thy crook*  <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) He compares God to a shepherd, and
this metaphor often occurs. Though <span id="iv.7.xv-p11.1"></span>שבט,
*shebeth,* indeed signifies a scepter when kings are mentioned, it is
yet taken also for a pastoral staff, as in <span
id="iv.7.xv-p11.2"></span>[Psalm
23](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.7.xv-p11.2"></span> and
in many other places. As then he represents God here as a Shepherd, so
he assigns a crook to him; as though he said, O Lord, thou performest
the office of a Shepherd in ruling this people. How so? He immediately
confirms what I have lately said, that there was no hope of a remedy
except through the mercy of God, by adding*, the flock*  <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) *of thine heritage;* for by calling
them the flock of his heritage, he does not consider what the people
deserved, but fixes his eyes on their gratuitous adoption. Since, then,
it had pleased God to choose that people, the Prophet on this account
dares to go forth to God’s presence, and to plead their gratuitous
election, — “O Lord, I will not bring before thee the nobility of our
race, or any sort of dignity, or our piety, or any merits.” What then?
“We are thy people, for thou best declared that we are a royal
priesthood. We are then thine heritage.” How so? “Because it has been
thy pleasure to have one peculiar people sacred to thee.” We now more
clearly see that the Prophet relied on God’s favor alone, and opposed
the recollection of the covenant to the trials which might have
otherwise made every hope to fail.

<span id="iv.7.xv-p13"></span>He afterwards adds, *Who dwell apart,* or
alone. He no doubt refers here to the dispersion of the people, when he
says, that they dwelt alone. For though the Jews had been scattered in
countries delightful, fertile and populous, yet they were everywhere as
in a desert and in solitude, for they were a mutilated body. The whole
of Chaldea and of Assyria was then really a desert to the faithful; for
there they dwelt not as one people, but as members torn asunder. This is
the dispersion intended by the words of the Prophet. He also adds, that
dwell *in the forest* For they had no secure habitation except in their
own country; for they lived there under the protection of God; and all
other countries, as I have already said, were to them like the desert.

<span id="iv.7.xv-p14"></span>He adds, *In the midst of Carmel* The
preposition <span id="iv.7.xv-p14.1"></span>כ, *caph,* is to be
understood here, *As in the midst of Carmel, they shall be fed in Bashan
and Gilead, as in ancient days;*  <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) that is, though they are now thy
solitary sheep, yet thou wilt gather them again that they may feed as on
Carmel, (which we know was very fruitful,) and then, *as in Bashan and
Gilead.* We know that there are in those places the richest pastures.
Since then the Prophet compares the faithful to sheep, he mentions
Bashan, he mentions Carmel and Gilead; as though he said, “Restore, O
Lord, thy people, that they may dwell in the heritage once granted them
by thee.” Why he says that they were solitary, I have already explained;
and there is a similar passage in <span id="iv.7.xv-p17.2"></span>[Ps
102:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.7.xv-p17.2"></span>; though there is there a different word,
<span id="iv.7.xv-p17.3"></span>ערער, *oror*; but the meaning is the
same. The faithful are there said to be solitary, because they were not
collected into one body; for this was the true happiness of the people,
— that they worshipped God together, that they were under one head, and
also that they had one altar as a sacred bond to cherish unity of faith.
When therefore the faithful were scattered here and there they were
justly said to be solitary, wherever they were.

<span id="iv.7.xv-p18"></span>He afterwards adds, *according to ancient
days* Here he places before God the favors which he formerly showed to
his people, and prays that he would, like himself, go on to the end,
that is that he would continue to the end his favors to his chosen
people. And it availed not a little to confirm their faith, when the
faithful called to mind how liberally had God dealt from the beginning
with the posterity of Abraham: they were thus made to feel assured, that
God would be no less kind to his elect, though there might be, so to
speak, a sad separation: for when God had banished the Jews into exile,
it was a kind of divorce, as though they were given to utter
destruction. Yet now when they recollect that they had descended from
the holy fathers, and that a Redeemer had been promised them, they
justly entertain a hope of favor in future from the past benefits of
God, because he had formerly kindly treated his people.

<span id="iv.7.xvi"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xvi-p1"></span>Prayer.

<span id="iv.7.xvi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since we have so
provoked thy displeasure by our sins, that a dreadful waste and solitude
appear everywhere — O grant, that a proof of that favor, which thou hast
so remarkably exhibited towards thy ancient people, may shine upon us,
so that thy Church may be raised up in which true religion may flourish,
and thy name be glorified: and may we daily solicit thee in our prayers
and never doubt, but that under the government of thy Christ, thou canst
again gather together the whole world, though it be miserably dispersed,
so that we may persevere in this warfare to the end, until we shall at
length know that we have not in vain hoped in thee, and that our prayers
have not been in vain, when Christ shall exercise the power given to him
for our salvation and for that of the whole world. Amen.

<span id="iv.7.xvi-p3"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.xvii"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xviii"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xviii-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.xviii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.7.xviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xviii-p2"></span>**15.** According to the days of thy
coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous *things*

<span id="iv.7.xviii-p3"></span>**15.** Secundum dies egressus tui e
terra AEgypti, ostendam ei mirabilia.

<span id="iv.7.xviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.xviii-p5"></span><span id="iv.7.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xviii-p6"></span>The Prophet here introduces God as the
speaker; and he so speaks as to give an answer to his prayer. God then
promises that he will be wonderful in his works, and give such evidences
of his power, as he exhibited when he brought up his people from the
land of Egypt. We now see that there is more force in this passage, than
if the Prophet had at first said, that God would become the deliverer of
his people: for he interposed entreaty and prayer and God now shows that
he will be merciful to his people; and at the same time the faithful are
reminded, that they must be instant in prayer, if they desire to be
preserved by God.

<span id="iv.7.xviii-p7"></span>Now God says that *he will show
wonderful things,* as when the people formerly came out of Egypt.  <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) That redemption, we know, was a
perpetual monument of God’s power in the preservation of his Church; so
that whenever he designs to give some hope of deliverances he reminds
the faithful of those miracles that they may feel assured that there
will be no obstacles to prevent them from continuing in a state of
safety, provided God will be pleased to help them, for his power is not
diminished.

<span id="iv.7.xviii-p9"></span>And this deserves to be noticed; for
though we all allow the omnipotence of God, yet when we struggle with
trials, we tremble, as though all the avenues to our preservation had
been closed up against God. As soon then as any impediment is thrown in
our way, we think that there is no hope. Whence is this? It is because
we make no account of God’s power, which yet we confess to be greater
than that of the whole world.

<span id="iv.7.xviii-p10"></span>This is the reason why God now refers
to the miracles which he wrought at the coming forth of the people. They
ought to have known, that God ever continues like himself, and that his
power remains as perfect as it was formerly; and there is in him
sufficient support to encourage the hope of assistance. We now perceive
the object of the Prophet. He indeed changes the persons; for in the
beginning he addresses the people, according to the days of thy going
forth, and then he adds, <span id="iv.7.xviii-p10.1"></span>אראני,
*aranu*, ‘I will make him to see;’ but this change does not obscure the
meaning, for God only means, that his power was sufficiently known
formerly to his people, and that there was a memorable proof of it in
their redemption, so that the people could not have doubted respecting
their safety, without being ungrateful to God, and without burying in
oblivion that so memorable a benefit, which God once conferred on their
fathers. It follows —

<span id="iv.7.xix"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xix-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.xix-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.7.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xix-p2"></span>**16.** The nations shall see and be
confounded at all their might: they shall lay *their* hand upon *their*
mouth, their ears shall be deaf.

<span id="iv.7.xix-p3"></span>**16.** Videbunt gentes et pudefient ab
omni fortitudine sua; ponent manum super os, aures eorum surdescent:

<span id="iv.7.xix-p4"></span>**17.** They shall lick the dust like a
serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth:
they shall be afraid of the Lord our God, and shall fear because of
thee.

<span id="iv.7.xix-p5"></span>**17.** Lingent pulverem quasi serpens,
quasi reptilia terrae frement (vel, movebunt) a latibulis suis; ad
Jehovam Deum nostrum pavebunt, et metuent sibi abs te.

<span id="iv.7.xix-p6"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.xix-p7"></span><span id="iv.7.xix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xix-p8"></span>Here again the Prophet shows, that though
the Church should be assailed on every side and surrounded by
innumerable enemies, no doubt ought yet to be entertained respecting the
promised aid of God; for it is in his power to make all nations ashamed,
that is, to cast down all the pride of the world, so as to make the
unbelieving to acknowledge at length that they were elated by an empty
confidence. Hence he says, that the *nations shall see;* as though he
said, “I know what makes you anxious, for many enemies are intent on
your ruin; and when any help appears, they are immediately prepared
fiercely to resist; but their attempts and efforts will not prevent God
from delivering you.”

<span id="iv.7.xix-p9"></span>*They shall* then *see and be ashamed of
all their strength*  <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) By these
words the Prophet means, that however strongly armed the unbelieving may
think themselves to be to destroy the Church, and that how many
obstacles soever they may have in their power to restrain the power of
God in its behalf, yet the whole will be in vain, for God will, in fact,
prove that the strength of men is mere nothing.

<span id="iv.7.xix-p11"></span>He adds, *They shall lay their hand on
their mouth;* that is, they shall not dare to boast hereafter, as they
have hitherto done; for this phrase in Hebrew means to be silent. Since
then the enemies of the Church made great boastings and exulted with
open mouth, as though the people of God were destroyed, the Prophet
says, that when God would appear as the Redeemer of his people, they
should become, as it were, mute. He subjoins, *their ears shall become
deaf;*  <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) that is, they shall
stand astounded; nay, they shall hardly dare to open their ears, lest
the rumor, brought to them, should occasion to them new trembling. Proud
men, we know, when matters succeed according to their wishes, not only
boast of their good fortune with open mouths, but also greedily catch at
all rumors; for as they think they are all so many messages of
victories, — “What is from this place? or what is from that place?” They
even expect that the whole world will come under their power. The
Prophet, on the other hand, says, “They shall lay the hand on the mouth,
and their ears shall become deaf; that is they shall tremblingly shun
all rumors, for they shall continually dread new calamities, when they
shall see that the God of Israel, against who they have hitherto fought,
is armed with so much power.

<span id="iv.7.xix-p13"></span>Some apply this to the preaching of the
Gospel; which I readily allow, provided the deliverance be made always
to begin with the ancient people: for if any one would have this to be
understood exclusively of Christ, such a strained and remote exposition
would not be suitable. But if any one will consider the favor of God, as
continued from the return of the people to the restoration effected by
Christ, he will rightly comprehend the real design of the Prophet.
Really fulfilled, then, is what the Prophet says here, when God spreads
the doctrine of his Gospel through the whole world: for those who before
boasted of their own inventions, begin then to close their mouth, that,
being thus silent, they may become his disciples; and they also close
their ears, for now they give not up themselves, as before, to foolish
and puerile fables, but consecrate their whole hearing to the only true
God, that they may attend only to his truth, and no more vacillate
between contrary opinions. All this, I allow, is fulfilled under the
preaching of the Gospel; but the Prophet, no doubt, connected together
the whole time, from the return of the people from the Babylonian exile,
to the manifestation of Christ.

<span id="iv.7.xix-p14"></span><span id="iv.7.xix-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xix-p15"></span>He afterwards adds, *They shall lick the
dust as a serpent* He intimates, that however the enemies of the Church
may have proudly exalted themselves before, they shall then be cast
down, and lie, as it were, on the ground; for to lick the dust is
nothing else but to lie prostrate on the earth. They shall then be low
and creeping like serpents; and then, *They shall move themselves as
worms and reptiles of the ground* The verb <span
id="iv.7.xix-p15.1"></span>רגז, *regez,* as it has been stated
elsewhere, means to raise an uproar, to tumultuate, and it means also to
move one’s self; and this latter meaning is the most suitable here,
namely, that they shall go forth or move themselves from their
enclosures; for the word <span id="iv.7.xix-p15.2"></span>סגר, *sager,*
signifies to close up: and by enclosures he means hiding-places, though
in the song of David, in <span id="iv.7.xix-p15.3"></span>[Psalm
18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.7.xix-p15.3"></span>:,
the word is applied to citadels and other fortified places, —

<span id="iv.7.xix-p16"></span>‘Men,’ he says, ‘trembled from their
fortresses;’

<span id="iv.7.xix-p17"></span>though they occupied well-fortified
citadels, they yet were afraid, because the very fame of David had
broken down their boldness. But as the Prophet speaks here of worms, I
prefer this rendering, — ‘from their lurkingplaces;’ as though he said,
“Though they have hitherto thought themselves safe in their enclosures,
they shall yet move and flee away like worms and reptiles; for when the
ground is dug, the worms immediately leap out, for they think that they
are going to be taken; so also, when any one moves the ground, the
reptiles come forth, and tremblingly run away in all directions.” And
the Prophet says that, in like manner, the enemies of the Church, when
the Lord shall arise for its help, shall be smitten with so much fear,
that they shall in every direction run away. And this comparison ought
to be carefully noticed, that is, when the Prophet compares powerful
nations well exercised in wars, who before were audaciously raging, and
were swollen with great pride — when he compares them to worms and
reptiles of the ground, and also to serpents: he did this to show, that
there will be nothing to hinder God from laying prostrate every exalted
thing in the world, as soon as it shall please him to aid his Church.

<span id="iv.7.xix-p18"></span>And hence the Prophet adds, *On account
of Jehovah our God they shall treed, and they shall fear because of
thee* Here the Prophet shows, that the faithful ought not to distrust on
account of their own weakness, but, on the contrary, to remember the
infinite power of God. It is indeed right that the children of God
should begin with diffidence, — sensible that they are nothing, and that
all their strength is nothing; but they ought not to stop at their own
weakness, but, on the contrary, to rise up to the contemplation of God’s
power, that they may not doubt but that, when his power shall appear,
their enemies shall be soon scattered. This is the reason why the
Prophet here mentions the name of God, and then turns to address God
himself. *Tremble* then *shall they at Jehovah our God,* that is, on
account of Jehovah our God; and then *Fear shall they because of thee.*
 <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) It now follows —

<span id="iv.7.xx"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xx-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.xx-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#018.md)<span id="iv.7.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xx-p2"></span>**18.** Who *is* a God like unto thee, that
pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of
his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth
*in* mercy.

<span id="iv.7.xx-p3"></span>**18.** Quis Deus sicut tu, tollens
iniquitatem, et transiens super scelus, erga reliquias haereditatis
suae? Non retinebit in perpetuum iram suam (alii vertunt, non roboravit;
nam <span id="iv.7.xx-p3.1"></span>חזק hoc interdum significat; sed
potius hic vertendum est, non retinebit;) quia placet ei clementia (vel,
diligit misericordiam.)  <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md)

<span id="iv.7.xx-p7"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.xx-p8"></span><span id="iv.7.xx-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xx-p9"></span>The Prophet here exclaims that God ought to
be glorified especially for this — that he is merciful to his people.
When he says, *Who is God as thou art?* he does not mean that there are
other gods; for this, strictly speaking, is an improper comparison. But
he shows that the true and only God may be distinguished from all idols
by this circumstance — that he graciously forgives the sins of his
people and bears with their infirmities. It is indeed certain, that all
nations entertained the opinion, that their gods were ready to pardon;
hence their sacrifices and hence also their various kinds of expiations.
Nor has there been any nation so barbarous as not to own themselves
guilty in some measure before God; hence all the Gentiles were wont to
apply to the mercy of their gods; while yet they had no firm conviction:
for though they laid hold on this first principle, — that the gods would
be propitious to sinners, if they humbly sought pardon; yet they prayed,
we know, with no sure confidence, for they had no certain promise. We
hence see that what the Prophet means is this, — that the God of Israel
could be proved to be the true God from this circumstance — that having
once received into favor the children of Abraham, he continued to show
the same favor, and kept his covenant inviolably, though their sins had
been a thousand times a hindrance in the way. That God then in his
goodness surmounted all the wickedness of the people, and stood firm in
his covenant, which had been so often violated by vices of the people —
this fact may be brought as an evidence, that he is the true God: for
what can be found of this kind among idols? Let us suppose that there is
in them something divine, that they were gods, and endued with some
power; yet with regard to the gods of the Gentiles, it could not be
known that any one of them was propitious to his own people. Since then
this can apply only to the God of Israel, it follows that in this
instance his divinity shines conspicuously, and that his sovereignty is
hence sufficiently proved. We also learn, that all the gods of heathens
are vain; yea, that in the religion of heathens there is nothing but
delusions: for no nation can with confidence flee to its god to obtain
pardon, when it has sinned. This is the sum of the whole. I shall now
come to the words of the Prophet.

<span id="iv.7.xx-p10"></span>*Who is a God like thee, taking away
iniquity, and passing by wickedness?* By these two forms of expression,
he sets forth the singular favor of God in freely reconciling himself to
sinners. To take away sins is to blot them out; though the verb <span
id="iv.7.xx-p10.1"></span>נשא, *nusha,*often means to raise on high; yet
it means also to take, or, to take away. To pass by wickedness, is to
connive at it, as though he said, “God overlooks the wickedness of his
people, as if it escaped his view:” for when God requires an account of
our life, our sins immediately appear, and appear before his eyes; but
when God does not call our sins before his judgment, but overlooks them,
he is then said to pass by them.

<span id="iv.7.xx-p11"></span>This passage teaches us, as I have already
reminded you, that the glory of God principally shines in this, — that
he is reconcilable, and that he forgives our sins. God indeed manifests
his glory both by his power and his wisdom, and by all the judgments
which he daily executes; his glory, at the same time, shines forth
chiefly in this, — that he is propitious to sinners, and suffers himself
to be pacified; yea, that he not only allows miserable sinners to be
reconciled to him, but that he also of his own will invites and
anticipates them. Hence then it is evident, that he is the true God.
That religion then may have firm roots in our hearts, this must be the
first thing in our faith, — that God will ever be reconciled to us; for
except we be fully persuaded as to his mercy, no true religion will ever
flourish in us, whatever pretensions we may make; for what is said in
<span id="iv.7.xx-p11.1"></span>[Psalm
130](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.7.xx-p11.1"></span> is
ever true, ‘With thee is propitiation, that thou mayest be feared.’
Hence the fear of God, and the true worship of him, depend on a
perception of his goodness and favor; for we cannot from the heart
worship God, and there will be, as I have already said, no genuine
religion in us, except this persuasion be really and deeply seated in
our hearts, — that he is ever ready to forgive, whenever we flee to him.

<span id="iv.7.xx-p12"></span>It hence also appears what sort of
religion is that of the Papacy: for under the Papacy, being perplexed
and doubtful, they ever hesitate, and never dare to believe that God
will be propitious to them. Though they have some ideas, I know not
what, of his grace; yet it is a vain presumption and rashness, as they
think, when any one is fully persuaded of God’s mercy. They therefore
keep consciences in suspense; nay, they leave them doubtful and
trembling, when there is no certainty respecting God’s favor. It hence
follows, that their whole worship is fictitious; in a word, the whole of
religion is entirely subverted, when a firm and unhesitating confidence,
as to his goodness, is taken away, yea, that confidence by which men are
enabled to come to him without doubting, and to receive, whenever they
sin and confess their guilt and transgressions, the mercy that is
offered to them.

<span id="iv.7.xx-p13"></span>But this confidence is not what rises
spontaneously in us; nay, even when we entertain a notion that God is
merciful, it is only a mere delusion: for we cannot be fully convinced
respecting God’s favor, except he anticipates us by his word, and
testifies that he will be propitious to us whenever we flee to him.
Hence I said at the beginning, that the Prophet here exhibits the
difference between the God of Israel and all the idols of the Gentiles,
and that is, because he had promised to be propitious to his people. It
was not in vain that sacrifices were offered by the chosen people, for
there was a promise added, which could not disappoint them: but the
Gentiles ever remained doubtful with regard to their sacrifices; though
they performed all their expiations, there was yet no certainty; but the
case was different with the chosen people. What then the Prophet says
here respecting the remission of sins, depends on the testimony which
God himself has given.

<span id="iv.7.xx-p14"></span>We must now notice the clause which
immediately follows, *as to the remnant of his heritage* Here again he
drives away the hypocrites from their vain confidence: for he says that
God will be merciful only to a remnant of his people; and, at the same
time, he takes away an offense, which might have grievously disquieted
the weak, on seeing the wrath of God raging among the whole people, —
that God would spare neither the common nor the chief men. When
therefore the fire of God’s vengeance flamed terribly, above and below,
this objection might have greatly disturbed weak minds, — “How is this?
God does indeed declare that he is propitious to sinners, and yet his
severity prevails among us. — How can this be?” The Prophet meets this
objection and says, God is propitious to the remnant of his heritage;
which means, that though God would execute terrible vengeance on the
greater part, there would yet ever remain some seed, on whom his mercy
would shine; and he calls them the remnant of his heritage, because
there was no reason, as it was stated yesterday, why God forgave the
few, except that he had chosen the posterity of Abraham.

<span id="iv.7.xx-p15"></span>He also adds, *He will not retain his
wrath perpetually*. By this second consolation he wished to relieve the
faithful: for though God chastises them for a time, he yet forgets not
his mercy. We may say, that the Prophet mentions here two exceptions. He
had spoken of God’s mercy; but as this mercy is not indiscriminate or
common to all, he restricts what he teaches to the remnant. Now follows
another exception, — that how much soever apparently the wrath of God
would rage against his elect people themselves, there would yet be some
moderation, so that they would remain safe, and that their calamities
would not be to them fatal. Hence he says, God retains not wrath; for
though, for a moment, he may be angry with his people, he will yet soon,
as it were, repent, and show himself gracious to them, and testify that
he is already reconciled to them; — not that God changes, but that the
faithful are made for a short time to feel his wrath; afterwards a taste
of his mercy exhilarates them, and thus they feel in their souls that
God has in a manner changed. For when dread possesses their minds, they
imagine God to be terrible, but when they embrace the promises of his
grace, they call on him, and begin to entertain hope of pardon; then God
appears to them kind, gentle, and reconcilable; yea, and altogether
ready to show mercy. This is the reason why the Prophet says, that *God
retains not his wrath*

<span id="iv.7.xx-p16"></span>Then follows the cause, *for he loveth
mercy* Here the Prophet more clearly shows, that the remission of sins
is gratuitous, and that it has no foundation but in the nature of God
himself. There is then no reason, since Scripture declares God to be
reconcilable, why any one should seek the cause in himself, or even the
means by which God reconciles himself to us: for He himself is the
cause. As God then by nature loves mercy, hence it is, that he is so
ready to forgive sinners. Whosoever then imagines that God is to be
propitiated by expiations or any satisfactions, subverts the doctrine of
the Prophet; and it is the same thing as to build without a foundation:
for the only prop or support that can raise us up to God, when we desire
to be reconciled to him, is this, — that he loves mercy. And this is the
reason why God so much commends his mercy, why he says that he is
merciful to thousand generations, slow to wrath, and ready to pardon.
For though the unbelieving harden themselves against God, yet when they
feel his wrath, there is nothing so difficult for them as to believe
that God can be pacified. Hence this reason, which is not in vain added
by the Prophet, ought to be especially noticed.

<span id="iv.7.xx-p17"></span>Let us now see to whom God is merciful.
For as Satan could not have obliterated from the hearts of men a
conviction of God’s mercy, he has yet confined mercy to the unbelieving,
as though God should forgive sinners only once, when they are admitted
into the Church. Thus the Pelagians formerly thought, that God grants
reconciliation to none but to aliens; for whosoever has been once
received into the Church cannot, as they imagined, stand otherwise
before God than by being perfect. And this figment led Novatus and his
disciples to create disturbances in the Church. And there are at this
day not only deluded men, but devils, who, by the same figment, or
rather delirious notions, fascinate themselves and others, and hold,
that the highest perfection ought to exist in the faithful; and they
also slander our doctrine, as though we were still continuing in the
Alphabet or in the first rudiments, because we daily preach free
remission of sins. But the Prophet declares expressly that God not only
forgives the unbelieving when they sin, but also his heritage and his
elect. Let us then know, that as long as we are in the world, pardon is
prepared for us, as we could not otherwise but fall every moment from
the hope of salvation, were not this remedy provided for us: for those
men must be more than mad who arrogate to themselves perfection, or who
think that they have arrived at that high degree of attainment, that
they can satisfy God by their works. It now follows —

<span id="iv.7.xxi"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.xxi-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#019.md)<span id="iv.7.xxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p2"></span>**19.** He will turn again, he will have
compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast
all their sins into the depths of the sea.

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p3"></span>**19.** Reveretur, miserebitur nostri;
calcabit iniquitates nostras, et projiciet in profunditates maris cuncta
scelera eorum.

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p5"></span><span id="iv.7.xxi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p6"></span>The Prophet now prescribes to the faithful
a form of glorying, that they may boldly declare that God will be
pacified towards them. Since then God loves mercy, *he will return, he
will have mercy on us* The context here ought to be observed by us; for
it would avail us but little to understand, I know not what, concerning
God’s mercy, and to preach in general the free remission of sins, except
we come to the application, that is, except each of the faithful
believed that God, for his own sake, is merciful, as soon as he is
called upon. This conclusion, then, is to be borne in mind, — “God
forgives the remnant of his heritage, because he is by nature inclined
to show mercy: he will *therefore* be merciful to us, for we are of the
number of his people.” Except we lay hold on this conclusion, “He will
therefore show mercy to us,” whatever we have heard or said respecting
God’s goodness will vanish away.

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p7"></span>This then is the true logic of religion,
that is, when we are persuaded that God is reconcilable and easily
pacified, because he is by nature inclined to mercy, and also, when we
thus apply this doctrine to ourselves, or to our own peculiar benefit, —
As God is by nature merciful, I shall therefore know and find him to be
so. Until then we be thus persuaded, let us know that we have made but
little progress in the school of God. And hence it appears very clear
from this passage, that the Papacy is a horrible abyss; for no one under
that system can have a firm footing, so as to be fully persuaded that
God will be merciful to him; for all that they have are mere
conjectures. But we see that the Prophet reasons very differently, God
loves mercy; he will therefore have mercy on us: and then he adds, *He
will return;*  <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) and this is said
lest the temporary wrath or severity of God should disquiet us. Though
God then may not immediately shine on us with his favor, but, on the
contrary, treat us sharply and roughly, yet the Prophet teaches us that
we are to entertain good hope. — How so? *He will return,* or, as he
said shortly before, He will not retain perpetually his wrath: for it is
for a moment that he is angry with his Church; and he soon remembers
mercy.

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p9"></span>The Prophet now specifies what sort of
mercy God shows to the faithful, *For he will tread down our
iniquities;* he had said before that he passes by the wickedness of his
elect people. *He will then tread down our iniquities; and he will cast*
 <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) *into the depth of the sea all
their sins;* that is our sins shall not come in remembrance before him.
We hence learn what I have said before — that God cannot be worshipped
sincerely and from the heart until this conviction be fixed and deeply
rooted in our hearts, that God is merciful, not in general, but toward
us, because we have been once adopted by him and are his heritage. And
then were the greater part to fall away, we should not fail in our
faith; for God preserves the remnant in a wonderful manner. And lastly,
let us know, that whenever we flee to God for mercy, pardon is ever
ready for us, not that we may indulge in sin, or take liberty to commit
it, but that we may confess our faults and that our guilt may appear
before our eyes: let us know, that the door is open to us; for God of
his own good will presents himself to us as one ready to be reconciled.

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p14"></span>It is also said, *He will cast our sins
into the depth of the sea.* We hence learn that there is a full
remission of sins, not half as the Papists imagine, for God, they say,
remits the sin, but retains the punishment. How frivolous this is, the
thing itself clearly proves. The language of the Prophet does however
import this, that our sins are then remitted when the records of them
are blotted out before God. It follows — for I will run over this verse,
that I may today finish this Prophet —

<span id="iv.7.xxii"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xxii-p1"></span><span id="iv.7.xxii-p1.1"></span>[Micah
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#020.md)<span id="iv.7.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xxii-p2"></span>**20.** Thou wilt perform the truth to
Jacob, *and* the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our
fathers from the days of old.

<span id="iv.7.xxii-p3"></span>**20.** Dabis veritatem Jacob,
misericordiam Abrahae, quas jurasti patribus nostris a diebus antiquis.

<span id="iv.7.xxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.7.xxii-p5"></span><span id="iv.7.xxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xxii-p6"></span>The faithful confirm here the former
truth, that God had deposited his covenant with them, which could not be
made void: and hence also shines forth more clearly what I have said
before, that the faithful do not learn by their own understanding what
sort of Being God is, but embrace the mercy which he offers in his own
word. Except God then speaks, we cannot form in our own minds any idea
of his grace but what is uncertain and vanishing; but when he declares
that he will be merciful to us, then every doubt is removed. This is now
the course which the Prophet pursues.

<span id="iv.7.xxii-p7"></span>He says, *Thou wilt give truth to Jacob,
mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn to our fathers;* as though he
said, “We do not presumptuously invent any thing out of our own minds,
but receive what thou hast once testified to us; for thy will has been
made known to us in thy word: relying then on thy favor, we are
persuaded as to thy gratuitous pardon, though we are in many respects
guilty before thee.” We now then understand the design of the Prophet.

<span id="iv.7.xxii-p8"></span>As to the words, it is not necessary to
dwell on them, for we have elsewhere explained this form of speaking.
There are here two expressions by which the Prophet characterizes the
covenant of God. Truth is mentioned, and mercy is mentioned. With
respect to order, the mercy of God precedes; for he is not induced
otherwise to adopt us than through his goodness alone: but as God of his
own will has with so great kindness received us, so he is true and
faithful in his covenant. If then we desire to know the character of
God’s covenant, by which he formerly chose the Jews, and at this day
adopts us as his people, these two things must be understood, that God
freely offers himself to us, and that he is constant and true, he
repents not, as Paul says, as to his covenant: The gifts and calling of
God, he says, are without repentance, (<span
id="iv.7.xxii-p8.2"></span>[Ro
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.7.xxii-p8.2"></span>;) and he refers to the covenant, by which
God adopted the children of Abraham.

<span id="iv.7.xxii-p9"></span>He says now, *Thou wilt give,* that is,
show in reality; for this, to give, is, as it were, to exhibit in effect
or really. *Thou will* then *give,* that is, openly show, that thou hast
not been in vain so kind to us and ours, in receiving them into favor.
How so? Because the effect of thy goodness and truth appears to us.

<span id="iv.7.xxii-p10"></span>*Thou hast* then *sworn to our fathers
from the days of old.* The faithful take for granted that God had
promised to the fathers that his covenant would be perpetual; for he did
not only say to Abraham, I will be thy God, but he also added, and of
thy seed for ever. Since, then, the faithful knew that the covenant of
God was to be perpetual and inviolable, and also knew that it was to be
continued from the fathers to their children, and that it was once
promulgated for this end, that the fathers might deliver it as by the
hand to their children; they therefore doubted not but that it would be
perpetual. How so? *for thou hast sworn to our fathers;* that is, they
knew that God not only promised, but that having interposed an oath, by
which God designed to confirm that covenant, he greatly honored it, that
it might be unhesitatingly received by the chosen people. As then the
faithful knew that God in a manner bound himself to them, they
confidently solicited him, really to show himself to be such as he had
declared he would be to his own elect.

<span id="iv.7.xxiii"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xxiii-p1"></span>Prayer.

<span id="iv.7.xxiii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we abound
in so many vices, by which we daily provoke thy wrath, and as by the
testimony of our consciences, we are justly exposed to everlasting
death, yea, and deserve a hundred and even a thousand deaths, — O grant,
that we may strive against the unbelief of our flesh, and so embrace
thine infinite mercy, that we may not doubt but that thee wilt be
propitious to us, and yet not abuse this privilege by taking liberty to
sin, but with fear, and true humility, and care, so walk according to
thy word, that we may not hesitate daily to flee to thy mercy, that we
may thereby be sustained and kept in safety, until having at length put
off all vices, and being freed from all sin, we come to thy celestial
kingdom, to enjoy the fruit of our faith, even that eternal inheritance
which has been obtained for us by the blood of thy only-begotten Son.
Amen.

<span id="iv.7.i-p12"></span>Substantially the same is the version of
*Dathius* and of *Henderson.* “Late figs” is not strictly the meaning of
<span id="iv.7.i-p12.1"></span>קיף, which is properly summer or
summer-fruit; yet, as the early or first ripe fig is mentioned in the
last line, which forms a contrast with this, what is meant, no doubt, is
the late figs. Then the word for “gleaners,” <span
id="iv.7.i-p12.2"></span>עללת, is properly, gleanings; but here it is
evidently to be taken as a concrete, gleaners, to correspond with
gatherers, though *Newcome* considers the women-gleaners to be intended.
The four last lines form a parallelism, in which the first and the early
fig, — the vintage and the cluster. — *Ed.*

<span id="iv.7.i-p16"></span> *Justus,* rendered in the text <span
id="iv.7.i-p16.1"></span>*humanus,* vel, *mansuetus* The Hebrew is <span
id="iv.7.i-p16.2"></span>חסיר, rendered by the Septuagint “<span
id="iv.7.i-p16.3"></span>ευσβης—godly, pious,”—by *Marckius,* “<span
id="iv.7.i-p16.4"></span>benignus — kind, benignant,” — by *Newcome,*
“the good man,” — and by *Henderson,* “the pious.” It is sometimes
rendered holy; but its meaning is, kind, benevolent, merciful, actively
good, beneficent. In <span id="iv.7.i-p16.5"></span>[Ps
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.7.i-p16.5"></span>,
it is rendered “godly,” and in <span id="iv.7.i-p16.6"></span>[Isa
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.7.i-p16.6"></span>,

<span id="iv.7.i-p17"></span> <span id="iv.7.i-p17.1"></span>*Rectus,*
<span id="iv.7.i-p17.2"></span>ישר, rendered by the Septuagint, “<span
id="iv.7.i-p17.3"></span>κατορθων—one going straight to an object,”—by
*Newcome* and *Henderson,* “upright.” It is one who proceeds in a
straight course according to the rule of the law, without making any
windings or turning aside into any devious path. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_183"></span>[184](cc28016.htm#fr_183.md) <span
id="iv.7.ii-p7.3"></span>

<span id="iv.7.ii-p8"></span> This clause, though the general sense is
allowed by most to be the same, is yet variously rendered. *Drusius*
says, “<span id="iv.7.ii-p8.1"></span>Locus hic diu me multumque
torsit.” The original is, —

<span id="iv.7.ii-p9"></span><span id="iv.7.ii-p9.1"></span>el hre kpyM
lhyjyb

<span id="iv.7.ii-p10"></span> The most satisfactory rendering is that
which is offered by *Marckius,* which is this, —

<span id="iv.7.ii-p11"></span><span id="iv.7.ii-p11.1"></span>*Propter
malefaciendum volae pro benefaciendum,* —*  
For doing evil \[*are *their\] hands instead of doing good.*

<span id="iv.7.ii-p12"></span>Rabbi *Jonathan,* as quoted by *Marckius,*
gives substantially the same rendering, though not literally, —

<span id="iv.7.ii-p13"></span><span id="iv.7.ii-p13.1"></span>*Malum
faciunt manibus suis, et non bonum faciunt,* —*  
Evil they do with their hands, and they do no good.*

<span id="iv.7.ii-p14"></span>Our version is that of *Junius* and
*Tremelius*, and is substantially followed by *Newcome;* and
*Henderson’s* version is, —

<span id="iv.7.ii-p15"></span>For evil their hands are well prepared;

<span id="iv.7.ii-p16"></span>which is nearly that of the Septuagint,—

<span id="iv.7.ii-p17"></span><span id="iv.7.ii-p17.1"></span>Epi to
kakon tav ceirav autwn etoimazousi

<span id="iv.7.ii-p18"></span> But the following would be as literal a
translation as that of *Marckius,* —

<span id="iv.7.ii-p19"></span>*For doing evil* are *their hands, to do*
it *thoroughly.*

<span id="iv.7.ii-p20"></span>The last verb means not only to do good,
but also to make a thing good or complete, fully to execute it. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_184"></span>[185](cc28016.htm#fr_184.md) <span
id="iv.7.ii-p21.3"></span>

<span id="iv.7.ii-p22"></span> The whole verse may be rendered thus,—

<span id="iv.7.ii-p23"></span>*For doing evil* are *their hands, to
execute it fully:  
The prince asks, and the judge* also, *for reward;  
When the great man speaks of oppression,  
*That *it* is *his desire, then they contrive it together,  
*or, literally, *entwine it.*

<span id="iv.7.ii-p24"></span>To render <span
id="iv.7.ii-p24.1"></span>הות נפשו הוא, “the wickedness of the soul,” as
*Newcome* does, is to leave out wholly the last word; and *Henderson*
does the same. *Piscator* gives the form of the words, “<span
id="iv.7.ii-p24.2"></span>aerumnam, quam expetit — the mischief, which
he desires.” The two last words literally are, “his desire it *is.*” —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_185"></span>[186](cc28016.htm#fr_185.md) <span
id="iv.7.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.iii-p7"></span> It is better, as it is done here, to take
the words simply as they are, and not to make superlatives of them: nor
is there any change necessary in the second line as proposed by
*Dathius, Newcome,* and others, by taking the <span
id="iv.7.iii-p7.1"></span>מ from one word and attaching it to another.
There is no MS. In its favor, and it is done only on the authority of
the Targum. The two lines are these, —

<span id="iv.7.iii-p8"></span>*Their good* man *is like a brier,  
The upright worse than a thorny hedge.*

<span id="iv.7.iii-p9"></span>The preposition <span
id="iv.7.iii-p9.1"></span>מ is often rendered “rather than;” but it may,
in many places, be rendered “better than,” or “worse than,” according to
the import of the passage. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_186"></span>[187](cc28016.htm#fr_186.md) <span
id="iv.7.vi-p9.5"></span>

<span id="iv.7.vi-p10"></span> See *Ov. Met.* Lib. I. 144-148.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[188](cc28016.htm#fr_187.md) <span
id="iv.7.vi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.vi-p12"></span> <span id="iv.7.vi-p12.1"></span>*Ne
fidatis amico:* it is rather, Believe not in a friend, that is, in what
he says, <span id="iv.7.vi-p12.2"></span>אל-תאמינו ברע. The next
expression is that which signifies reliance, trust or confidence. <span
id="iv.7.vi-p12.3"></span>אלוף, is a leader; <span
id="iv.7.vi-p12.4"></span>ηγουμενος in Sept., one who leads the way.
*Diodati* gives its true meaning, — “A conductor, the most trusty
friend, who is one’s usual counselor in every difficulty and
perplexity.” *Jerome* refers to scriptural instances as to the persons
here mentioned: the *friend,* Ahitophel and Judas, — the *counselor,*
Abimelek, who was made king by the men of Sichem, and oppressed them, —
*domestics,* Absalom and the wives of Esau. The word used for
“dishonoring” is very strong; <span id="iv.7.vi-p12.5"></span>מנבל, one
who counts a thing worthless or abominable; it means not only to
dishonor, but to regard with disdain and contempt. “The contempt and
violation of the laws of domestic duties,” *Henry* justly observes, “are
a sad symptom of an universal corruption of manners. Those are never
likely to come to good who are undutiful to their parents, and study to
be provoking to them and cross them.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_188"></span>[189](cc28016.htm#fr_188.md) <span
id="iv.7.viii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.viii-p8"></span> This is not exactly the Hebrew. The verb
for rising, as well as that for falling, is in the past tense. The
verse, literally rendered, is the following: —

<span id="iv.7.viii-p9"></span>*Rejoice not, my enemy, on my account;  
Though I have fallen, I have risen;  
Though I shall sit in darkness,  
Jehovah* will be *a light to me.*

<span id="iv.7.viii-p10"></span>There are no copies which give a
different reading as to the verb “I have risen.” *Newcome* follows the
Septuagint, and thinks that a conversive <span
id="iv.7.viii-p10.1"></span>ו is left out. It ought rather perhaps to be
considered as the language of faith, realizing the event before it
arrived. The fall and “the darkness” refer no doubt to the outward
calamities of the Church, its troubles and afflictions. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_189"></span>[190](cc28016.htm#fr_189.md) <span
id="iv.7.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.ix-p8"></span> *Iram,* <span
id="iv.7.ix-p8.1"></span>זעף, which means a stormy anger or displeasure,
which agitates and raises tempests, and such were the calamities which
came on the Jewish nation.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[191](cc28016.htm#fr_190.md) <span
id="iv.7.ix-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.ix-p13"></span> “I shall see the equity of his
proceedings concerning me, and the performance of his promises to me.” —
*Henry.*

<span id="fn_191"></span>[192](cc28016.htm#fr_191.md) <span
id="iv.7.xiii-p19.4"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p20"></span> It is somewhat singular that *Newcome*
renders the first “fenced” and the second “Egypt:” but Henderson renders
both “Egypt.” It is not the common name for Egypt, which is <span
id="iv.7.xiii-p20.1"></span>מצרים; the places referred to, <span
id="iv.7.xiii-p20.2"></span>[2Ki
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#024.md)<span

19:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.7.xiii-p20.3"></span>, do not justify this application. The word
“day” in three instances is here without a preposition: it may therefore
be regarded as the nominative absolute, or the verb, is nigh, or
approaches, as Jerome proposes, is understood. I would give this version
of the two verses, —

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p21"></span>11. The day for building thy walls!  
That day! Removed far shall be the decree:

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p22"></span>*12. That day! Even to thee shall they
come,  
From Assyria and cities of fortress,  
And from the fortress even to the river,  
And* from *sea to sea, and* from *mountain to mountain,  
*or, word for word,  
*And from the fortress even to the river and the sea,  
From the sea and the mountain of the mountain.*

<span id="iv.7.xiii-p23"></span>The last expression seems to mean,
“every mountain.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_192"></span>[193](cc28016.htm#fr_192.md) <span

<span id="iv.7.xiv-p8"></span> The copulative <span
id="iv.7.xiv-p8.1"></span>ו, rendered <span
id="iv.7.xiv-p8.2"></span>*et, and,* in the text, is not noticed here.
*Newcome* renders it *For,* connecting this with the former verse, and
applying it to heathen lands. But *Dathius* and *Henderson* render it,
as an adversative, *But, Nevertheless,* and consider, with Calvin, that
the land of Israel is here meant. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_193"></span>[194](cc28016.htm#fr_193.md) <span
id="iv.7.xv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xv-p11"></span> “The crook signifies God’s peculiar care

<span id="fn_194"></span>[195](cc28016.htm#fr_194.md) <span

<span id="iv.7.xv-p12"></span> “He compares the elect people,” says
*Marckius,* “to a flock of sheep, because they resemble them in
weakness, in innocency, in meekness, in usefulness, in fruitfulness, and
in close union. See <span id="iv.7.xv-p12.1"></span>[Ps

etc.” “They are thy sheep, thy peculiar property, who hear thee, who
need thy guidance and feeding, for they are weak and helpless, and
liable to go astray without the preserving care of their Shepherd.” —
*Cocceius.*

<span id="fn_195"></span>[196](cc28016.htm#fr_195.md) <span
id="iv.7.xv-p14.2"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xv-p15"></span> These two lines are better arranged by
*Newcome,* and the necessity of a preposition understood is obviated,
while the original is more strictly rendered, —

<span id="iv.7.xv-p16"></span>In the midst of Carmel let them feed,  
In Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

<span id="iv.7.xv-p17"></span>It is also better to render “feed” as a
prayer than in the future tense, to correspond in tenor with the
beginning of the verse. *Henderson* connects “Carmel” with the former
line, and thinks that “dwelling alone in the wood” refers to the
condition of the Jews when restored, and quotes the prophecy of Balaam
in <span id="iv.7.xv-p17.1"></span>[Nu
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.7.xv-p17.1"></span>.
But this seems to be a far-fetched exposition; and the word “wood,”
which means generally a dreary place, renders it wholly inadmissible. A
state of destitution and misery is evidently intended. “They were now,”
says *Henry,* “a desolate people; they were in the land of their
captivity as sheep in a forest, in danger of being lost and made a prey
to the beasts of the forest.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_196"></span>[197](cc28016.htm#fr_196.md) <span

<span id="iv.7.xviii-p8"></span> “The Prophet prayed that God would feed
them, and do kind things for them; but God answers, that he will show
them marvelous things, will outdo their hopes and expectations. — Their
deliverance from Babylon shall be a work of wonder and grace, not
inferior to their deliverance out of Egypt, nay, it shall eclipse the
luster of that, <span id="iv.7.xviii-p8.1"></span>[Jer.
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.7.xviii-p8.1"></span>.
— God’s former favors to his Church are patterns of future favors, and
shall again be copied out as there is occasion.” — *Henry.*

<span id="fn_197"></span>[198](cc28016.htm#fr_197.md) <span
id="iv.7.xix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xix-p10"></span> “They shall be ashamed of the strength
in which they trusted,” — *Drusius;* or as *Grotius* says, “of all their
strength which had been so suddenly destroyed;” or, as another author
says, “of all their strength when found ineffectual for the purpose of
destroying the people of God.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_198"></span>[199](cc28016.htm#fr_198.md) <span
id="iv.7.xix-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xix-p12"></span> “Malice,” says *Jerome,* “not only
blinds the eyes, but also deafens the ears.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_199"></span>[200](cc28016.htm#fr_199.md) <span
id="iv.7.xix-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xix-p19"></span> *Dathius* renders these two lines
differently, “<span id="iv.7.xix-p19.1"></span>Jovam Deum nostrum
timebunt eumque reverebuntur — Jehovah our God they shall fear, and him
will they reverence.” But this is neither consistent with the passage,
nor with the form in which the words appear. <span
id="iv.7.xix-p19.2"></span>פחד is not commonly, if ever, a transitive
verb, and to dread, or to be afraid, and not to fear, is its usual
meaning: and <span id="iv.7.xix-p19.3"></span>ירא, when it means the
fear of reverence, is generally construed without a preposition, and
with <span id="iv.7.xix-p19.4"></span>את before Jehovah. The literal
rendering is no doubt that which is given by Calvin. The distich is
capable of being rendered in *Welsh* exactly as in Hebrew, in the same
form and with the same prepositions; and, when thus rendered, the
meaning is what is give here, —

<span id="iv.7.xix-p20"></span><span
id="iv.7.xix-p20.1"></span>*Oherwydd Jehova ein Duw ur arswydant,* —*  
Ac ovnant rhagddot*

<span id="iv.7.xix-p21"></span>To fear because of thee, and to fear
thee, are two distinct things. You will have the first form in <span
id="iv.7.xix-p21.1"></span>[Josh.
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#008.md), [Josh.
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.7.xix-p21.1"></span>;
and the second in <span id="iv.7.xix-p21.2"></span>[De
31:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.7.xix-p21.2"></span>. The first refers to the fear of the
Canaanites, the dread of their power; the second, to the fear of
Jehovah. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_200"></span>[201](cc28016.htm#fr_200.md) <span
id="iv.7.xx-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xx-p4"></span> *Cocceius* calls this verse the *doxology*
of the Church. *Jerome* renders the first words, — <span
id="iv.7.xx-p4.1"></span>*Quis Deus similis tui?* Which is literally the
original, <span id="iv.7.xx-p4.2"></span> כמוך מי-אל— What God like
thee? That is, Jehovah, mentioned in the preceding verse. <span
id="iv.7.xx-p4.3"></span>Τις Θεος ωσπερ συ; *Sept.* Thinking that the
verse will admit of somewhat different arrangement, and of a more
literal rendering, I give the following, —

<span id="iv.7.xx-p5"></span>*What God* is *like thee?  
Taking away iniquity, and passing over transgression!* —*  
Against the remnant of his heritage,  
He retaineth not for ever his anger,  
For a lover of mercy* is *He.*

<span id="iv.7.xx-p6"></span>There is a transition after the second line
from the second to the third person; hence I make here the division.
Besides, the construction of the third with the second has ever been
found awkward by all the critics; but its construction with the fourth
verse is perfectly natural. <span id="iv.7.xx-p6.1"></span>נשא “taking
away,” or removing, conveys the idea of a burden being lifted up and
removed. “Passing over” seems to allude to the angel passing over the
houses of the Israelites in Egypt. “Iniquity,” <span
id="iv.7.xx-p6.2"></span>עון, is guilt and inward depravity; and
“Transgression,” <span id="iv.7.xx-p6.3"></span>פשע, is an overt act of
sin, an outward violation of the law. “A lover,” <span
id="iv.7.xx-p6.4"></span>חפף; the Septuagint renders it, <span
id="iv.7.xx-p6.5"></span>θελητης ελεους — the wisher of mercy; which is
too weak, for the word means delight. It may be rendered, “For one who
delights in mercy *is* He.” The *Targum* reads, <span
id="iv.7.xx-p6.6"></span>*Amat enim benefacere* — for he loves to do
good. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_201"></span>[202](cc28016.htm#fr_201.md) <span
id="iv.7.xxi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p8"></span> *Grotius, Dathius,* and *Henderson,*
consider that this verb, placed before another, without a conjunction,
expresses only a reiteration; and they render it adverbially, “again.”
But, in this place, it would be better to give it its proper meaning;
for as God is said to depart from his people, <span
id="iv.7.xxi-p8.1"></span>[Ho
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.7.xxi-p8.1"></span>,
so he may be said also to return. The Septuagint renders it <span
id="iv.7.xxi-p8.2"></span>επιστρεψει—He will return. *Drusius* reads,
<span id="iv.7.xxi-p8.3"></span>*convertetur,* scil. Ab ira sua — *He
will turn,* that is, from his anger. *Newcome’s* version is, “He will
turn again.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_202"></span>[203](cc28016.htm#fr_202.md) <span
id="iv.7.xxi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p10"></span> There is a mistake as to this verb; it
is the *second* person, as are all the verbs which follow. The Prophet
resumes here his address to God, which he commenced in the two first
lines of the last verse. To show the difference between what he speaks
*to* and what he speaks *of* God, the whole passage shall be here given,
—

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p11"></span>*18. What God* is *like thee!  
Taking away iniquity, and passing over transgression!  
Against the remnant of his heritage  
He retains not forever his anger;  
For a lover of mercy* is *He;*

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p12"></span>*19. He will return, he will pity us,  
He will subdue our iniquities:* —*  
Yea, thou wilt cast into the depths of the sea all their sins;  
Thou wilt show faithfulness to Jacob, mercy to Abraham,  
Which thou swarest to our fathers in the days of old.*

<span id="iv.7.xxi-p13"></span>“Pity,” <span
id="iv.7.xxi-p13.1"></span>רטחם, is tender compassion; the noun in the
plural number is used to designate the bowels. “Subdue,” or trample
under foot, is rendered “cover” by *Newcome,* on the ground of this
being the meaning of <span id="iv.7.xxi-p13.2"></span>כבש in Chaldee.
This wholly destroys the striking character of the passage. Our sins are
here represented as our enemies; God subdues them; and then in the next
line the simile is continued, they are to be drowned like Pharaoh and
his hosts in the depths of the sea. *Henderson’s* remarks on this point
are very excellent. “There is no ground,” he says, “for rejecting the
radical idea of *trampling under foot as enemies.* Sin must ever be
regarded as hostile to man. It is not only contrary to his interests,
but it powerfully opposes and combats the moral principles of his
nature, and the higher principles implanted by grace; and but for the
counteracting energy of divine influence, must prove victorious. Without
the subjugation of evil propensities, pardon would not be a blessing.” —
*Ed.*
