<span id="vi.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.iii-p1"></span>a translation of

<span id="vi.iii-p2"></span>Calvin’s Version of

<span id="vi.iii-p3"></span>The Prophecies of Nahum.

<span id="vi.iii.i"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.i-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="vi.iii.i-p3"></span>**1** The burden of Nineveh, — the book of
the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:

<span id="vi.iii.i-p4"></span>**2** A God jealous, and an avenger is
Jehovah; Avenger is Jehovah, and a retainer of wrath; Take vengeance
does Jehovah on his enemies, And keep *it* for his adversaries:
(**421**)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p5"></span>**3** Jehovah is slow to wrath, and great
in power, And by clearing he will not clear: Jehovah! In the whirlwind
and tempest is his way, And the cloud is the dust of his feet: (**424**)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p6"></span>**4** He chides the sea, and it becomes
dry; And all the rivers he dried up; Languish do Bashan and Carmel, And
the flower of Lebanon languishes:

<span id="vi.iii.i-p7"></span>**5** Mountains tremble at him, and hills
melt; And burn does the earth before his face, Yea, the world, and all
who dwell in it. (**427**)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p8"></span>**6** Before his indignation who can
stand? And who can bear the fierceness of his wrath? (**429**) His fury
is poured out like fire, And rocks dissolve before him.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p9"></span>**7** Good is Jehovah for strength in the
day of distress; And he knoweth them who hope in him.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p10"></span>**8** But with an inundation, he, passing
through, Will make a consummation in her place; (**433**) And pursue
shall darkness his enemies.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p11"></span>**9** What do ye imagine against Jehovah?
A consummation he makes! Not rise again shall affliction.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p12"></span>**10** They who are like entangled
thorns, And drunken as with their own drinking — Devoured shall they be
as stubble fully dry. (**437**)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p13"></span>**11** From thee has gone forth a
contriver of evil Against Jehovah, a wicked counselor.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p14"></span>**12** Thus saith Jehovah, — Though they
are secure, and though they are many, They shall *yet* be cut off, and
he shall pass through: (**443**) And through I have afflicted thee, I
will afflict thee no more;

<span id="vi.iii.i-p15"></span>**13** For now will I break off from thee
his yoke, And his bonds will I burst asunder.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p16"></span>**14** And a command respecting thee hath
Jehovah given, — “Let none be sown hereafter of thy name;” From the
house of thy gods will I cut off The graven and the molten image; I will
make thy grave, for thou art execrable.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p17"></span>**15** Behold on the mountains the feet
of him Who announceth, who publisheth peace! Celebrate thou, Judah, thy
solemnities, Perform thy vows; for pass through thee Shall the wicked
one no more, — he is wholly cut off.

<span id="vi.iii.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p3"></span>**1** Come up is the destroyer before thy
face; Watch the fortress, guard the way, (**455**) Make strong the
loins, fortify mightily thy strength:

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p4"></span>**2** (For taken away hath Jehovah the
pride of Jacob, As he had done as to the pride of Israel; As he had done
as to the pride of Israel; For emptied them the emptiers, And their
branches have they cut down:)

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p5"></span>**3** The shield of his mighty ones are
made red, The men of his strength are clad in scarlet; With the fire of
torches is the chariot, In the day of his expedition; And the fir-trees
tremulously shake:

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p6"></span>**4** In the wide places they madden with
their chariots, The hurry away through the streets, The appearance of
them is that of lamps, As lightnings they run here and there.

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p7"></span>**5** He will remember his valiant men,
They shall stumble in their march, They shall hasten to her wall, And
prepared will be the defense.

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p8"></span>**6** The gates of the rivers are opened,
And the palace is dissolved;

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p9"></span>**7** And she which stood firm is cast
into exile, And her maids lead her as with the voice of doves, Beating
on their breasts. (**463**)

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p10"></span>**8** And yet Nineveh had been As a pool
of waters from *ancient* days; But now they flee — “Stand ye, stand;”
And no one regards.

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p11"></span>**9** Take ye away the silver, take away
the gold; For there is no end of her preparations; *Her* glory is from
every desirable vessel. (**468**)

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p12"></span>**10** Emptied and emptied is she, and
denuded; And the heart is melted; And there is a knocking of the knees,
And trembling in all loins, And the faces of all withdraw their
brightness. (**472**)

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p13"></span>**11** Where is the abode of lions?
Where came the lion, the lioness, the cub of the lion; And none
terrified them. (**474**)

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p14"></span>**12** The lion tare what sufficed his
whelps, And strangled for his lionesses, And filled with raving his
caves, And his dens with prey.

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p15"></span>**13** Behold, I am against thee, saith
Jehovah of hosts, And I will burn with smoke her chariot, And thy young
lions shall the sword devour, And I will cut off from the land thy prey,
And the sound of thy teeth shall no more be heard.

<span id="vi.iii.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p3"></span>**1** Oh blood city! The whole is full
of deceit, *and* of ravin; *From it* the prey departs not.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p4"></span>**2** The sound of the whip! The sound
of the rattling of the wheel! And the horse prancing, and the chariot
bounding!

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p5"></span>**3** The horseman urging onward! And
the flame of the sword, and the lightning of the spear! And the number
of the slain, and the mass of carcasses! And there is no end to her dead
bodies, They stumble on their carcasses!

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p6"></span>**4** *This is* for the multitude of the
fornications Of the harlot who excels in beauty, The mistress of
sorceries, Who sells nations by her fornications, And tribes by her
sorceries. (**481**)

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p7"></span>**5** Behold, I am against thee, saith
Jehovah of hosts: And I will throw thy skirts over thy face, And show to
the nations thy nakedness, And to kingdoms thy filthiness;

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p8"></span>**6** And I will cast on thee filth, and
disgrace thee, And I will make thee an example:

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p9"></span>**7** And it shall be, that whosoever
seeth thee Shall flee away from thee, and say, — “Wasted is Nineveh! Who
will condole with her? Whence shall I seek comforters for thee?

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p10"></span>**8** Are thou better than populous No,
Which dwelt among the rivers? The sea was around her; Whose mound was
the sea, and the sea was her wall;

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p11"></span>**9** From Ethiopia was her strength,
and from Egypt, And there was no end *to it;* Africa and Lybia were her
auxiliaries:

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p12"></span>**10** Even she migrated, she went into
captivity; And her infants were bound in chains.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p13"></span>**11** Thou also shalt be inebriated,
thou shalt be hid; And thou shat seek strength from the enemy.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p14"></span>**12** All thy fortresses shall be like
fig-trees with ripe fruit; If they be shaken, they fall into the mouth
of the eater.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p15"></span>**13** Behold, thy people shall be
women in the midst of thee; To thine enemies shall be opened in the
gates of thy land, Devour shall the fire thy bars.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p16"></span>**14** Waters for the siege draw for
thyself, Strengthen thy fortresses, Enter into the clay, tread the
mortar, Make strong the brick-kiln:

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p17"></span>**15** There shall the fire devour you,
Exterminate thee shall the sword, It shall devour thee as the chafer.
Increase as the chafer, increase as the locust;

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p18"></span>**16** Thou hast multiplied thy
merchants More than the stars of heaven; — The chafer has spoiled, and
flies away.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p19"></span>**17** Thy princes are as locusts, And
thy captains are as the largest locusts; Which encamp in the fences in
the cold day; The sun rises, and they fly away, And not known is the
place where they are. (**502**)

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p20"></span>**18** Slept have thy shepherds, king
of Assyria; Lie down did thy mighty men: Dispersed is thy people on the
mountains, And no one gathers them.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p21"></span>**19** There is no binding for thy
fracture, Altogether grievous is thy wound; All who shall hear a report
of thee, Shall, on thy account, strike the hand; For upon whom hath not
passed Thy wickedness continually?
