<span id="v.1.ii"></span>

<span id="v.1.ii-p1"></span><span id="v.1.ii-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#001.md)<span id="v.1.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.ii-p2"></span>**1.**. The burden of Nineveh. The book of
the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.

<span id="v.1.ii-p3"></span>**1.** Onus Nineveh: Liber visionis Nahum
Helkosi:

<span id="v.1.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.ii-p5"></span><span id="v.1.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.ii-p6"></span>Though a part of what is here delivered
belongs to the Israelites and to the Jews, he yet calls his Book by what
it principally contains; he calls its *the burden of Nineveh* Of this
word <span id="v.1.ii-p6.1"></span>משא, *mesha,* we have spoken
elsewhere. Thus the Prophets call their prediction, whenever they
denounce any grievous and dreadful vengeance of God: and as they often
threatened the Jews, it hence happened, that they called, by way of
ridicule, all prophecies by this name <span id="v.1.ii-p6.2"></span>משא,
*mesha,* a burden.  <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) But yet the
import of the word is suitable. It is the same thing as though Nahum had
said that he was sent by God as a herald, to proclaim war on the
Ninevites for the sake of the chosen people. The Israelites may have
hence learnt how true and unchangeable God was in his covenant; for he
still manifested his care for them, though they had by their vices
alienated themselves from him.

<span id="v.1.ii-p8"></span>He afterwards adds, <span
id="v.1.ii-p8.1"></span>ספר חזון, *sapher chezun,* *the book of the
vision* This clause signifies, that he did not in vain denounce
destruction on the Ninevites, because he faithfully delivered what he
had received from God. For if he had simply prefaced, that he threatened
ruin to the Assyrian,, some doubt might have been entertained as to the
event. But here he seeks to gain to himself authority by referring to
God’s name; for he openly affirms that he brought nothing of his own,
but that this burden had been made known to him by a celestial oracle:
for <span id="v.1.ii-p8.2"></span>חזה, *cheze,* means properly to see,
and hence in Hebrew a vision is called <span
id="v.1.ii-p8.3"></span>חזון, *chezun,*. But the Prophets, when they
speak of a vision, do not mean any fantasy or imagination, but that kind
of revelation which is mentioned in <span id="v.1.ii-p8.4"></span>[Nu
14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#000.md)<span id="v.1.ii-p8.4"></span>,
where God says, that he speaks to his Prophets either by vision or by
dream. We hence see why this was added — that the burden of Nineveh was
a vision; it was, that the Israelites might know that this testimony
respecting God’s vengeance on their enemies was not brought by a mortal
man, and that there might be no doubt but that God was the author of
this prophecy.

<span id="v.1.ii-p9"></span>Nahum calls himself an Elkoshite. Some think
that it was the name of his family. The Jews, after their manner, say,
that it was the name of his father; and then they add this their common
gloss, that Elkos himself was a Prophet: for when the name of a
Prophet’s father is mentioned, they hold that he whose name is given was
also a Prophet. But these are mere trifles: and we have often seen how
great is their readiness to invent fables. Then the termination of the
word leads us to think that it was, on the contrary, the proper name of
a place; and Jerome tells us that there was in his time a small village
of this name in the tribe of Simon. We must therefore understand, that
Nahum arose from that town, and was therefore called “the Elkoshite.”
 <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) Let us now proceed —

<span id="v.1.iii"></span>

<span id="v.1.iii-p1"></span><span id="v.1.iii-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#002.md)<span id="v.1.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.iii-p2"></span>**2.** God *is* jealous, and the Lord
revengeth; the Lord revengeth, and *is* furious; the Lord will take
vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth *wrath* for his enemies.

<span id="v.1.iii-p3"></span>**2.** Deus aemulator (sic vertunt,) et
ulciscens Jehova; ulciscens Jehova, et Dominus irae (vel, possidens
iram;) ulciscens Jehova hostes suos, et servans (vel, responens) idem
(vel, ipse) inimicis suis.

<span id="v.1.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.iii-p5"></span><span id="v.1.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.iii-p6"></span>Nahum begins with the nature of God, that
what he afterwards subjoins respecting the destruction of Nineveh might
be more weighty, and produce a greater impression on the hearers. The
preface is general, but the Prophet afterwards applies it to a special
purpose. If he had only spoken of what God is, it would have been frigid
at least it would have been less efficacious; but when he connects both
together, then his doctrine carries its own force and power. We now
apprehend the design of the Prophet. He might indeed have spoken of the
fall of the city Nineveh: but if he had referred to this abruptly,
profane men might have regarded him with disdain; and even the
Israelites would have been perhaps less affected. This is the reason why
he shows, in a general way, what sort of Being God is. And he takes his
words from Moses; and the Prophets are wont to borrow from him their
doctrine:  <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) and it is from that
most memorable vision, when God appeared to Moses after the breaking of
the tables. I have therefore no doubt but that Nahum had taken from
<span id="v.1.iii-p7.1"></span>[Ex
34](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#000.md)<span id="v.1.iii-p7.1"></span> what
we read here: he does not, indeed, give literally what is found there;
but it is sufficiently evident that he paints, as it were, to the life,
the image of God, by which his nature may be seen.

<span id="v.1.iii-p8"></span>He says first, that *God is jealous;*
(*amulus* — emulous); for the verb <span id="v.1.iii-p8.1"></span>קנא,
*kona,* means to irritate, and also to emulate, and to envy. When God is
said to be <span id="v.1.iii-p8.2"></span>קנוא, *konua,* the Greeks
render it jealous, <span id="v.1.iii-p8.3"></span>ζηλωτην, and the
Latins, emulous, (*amulatorem*) But it properly signifies, that God
cannot bear injuries or wrongs. Though God then for a time connives at
the wickedness of men? he will yet be the defender of his own glory. He
calls him afterwards the avenger, and he repeats this three times,
*Jehovah avengeth, Jehovah avengeth and possesseth wrath, he will
avenge.* When he says that God *keeps for his enemies,* he means that
vengeance is reserved for the unbelieving and the despisers of God.
There is the same mode of speaking in use among us, *Je lui garde, et il
la garde a ses ennemis.* This phrase, in our language, shows what the
Prophet means here by saying, that God keeps for his enemies. And this
awful description of God is to be applied to the present case, for he
says that he proclaims war against the Ninevites, because they had
unjustly distressed the Church of God: it is for this reason that he
says, that God is jealous, that God is an avenger; and he confirms this
three times, that the Israelites might feel assured that this calamity
was seriously announced; for had not this representation been set before
them, they might have thus reasoned with themselves, — “We are indeed
cruelly harassed by our enemies; but who can think that God cares any
thing for our miseries, since he allows them so long to be unavenged?”
It was therefore necessary that the Prophet should obviate such
thoughts, as he does here. We now more fully understand why he begins in
a language so vehement, and calls God a jealous God, and an avenger.

<span id="v.1.iii-p9"></span>He afterwards adds, that *God possesses
wrath* I do not take <span id="v.1.iii-p9.1"></span>חמה, *cheme,* simply
for wrath, but the passion or he it of wrath. We ought not indeed to
suppose, as it has been often observed, that our passions belong to God;
for he remains ever like himself. But yet God is said to be for a time
angry, and for ever towards the reprobate, for he is our and their
Judge. Here, then, when the Prophet says, that *God is the Lord of
wrath,* or that he possesses wrath, he means that he is armed with
vengeance and that, though he connives at the sins of men, he is not yet
indifferent, nor even delays because he is without power, or because he
is idle and careless, but that he retains wraths as he afterwards
repeats the same thing, *He keeps for his enemies*  <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) In short, by these forms of speaking
the Prophet intimates that God is not to be rashly judged of on account
of his delay, when he does not immediately execute His judgments; for he
waits for the seasonable opportunity. But, in the meantime there is no
reason for us to think that he forgets his office when he suspends
punishment, or for a season spares the ungodly. When, therefore, God
does not hasten so very quickly, there is no ground for us to think that
he is indifferent, because he delays his wrath, or retains it, as we
have already said; for it is the same thing to retain wrath, as to be
the Lord of wrath, and to possess it. It follows —

<span id="v.1.iv"></span>

<span id="v.1.iv-p1"></span><span id="v.1.iv-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003.md)<span id="v.1.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.iv-p2"></span>**3.** The Lord *is* slow to anger, and
great in power, and will not at all acquit *the wicked*: the Lord hath
his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds *are* the dust
of his feet.

<span id="v.1.iv-p3"></span>**3.** Jehova tardus iris (*ad verbum, sed,*
tardus ad iram) et magnus robore; et purgando non purgabit; Jehova in
turbine et tempestate via ejus, et nubes pulvis pedum ejus.

<span id="v.1.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.iv-p5"></span><span id="v.1.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.iv-p6"></span>The Prophet goes on with the same subject;
and still longer is the preface respecting the nature of God, which
however is to be applied, as I have said, to the special objects which
hereafter he will state. He says here that God is *slow to wrath* Though
this saying is taken also from Moses yet the Prophet speaks here for the
purpose of anticipating an objection; for he obviates the audacity of
the ungodly who daringly derided God, when any evil was denounced on
them, — Where is the mercy of God? Can God divest himself of his
kindness? He cannot deny himself. Thus profane men, under the pretense
of honoring God, cast on him the most atrocious slander, for they
deprive him of his own power and office: and there is no doubt but that
this was commonly done by many of the ungodly in the age of our Prophet.
Hence he anticipates this objection, and concedes that God is slow to
wrath. There is then a concession here; but at the same time he says
that God is great in strength, and this he says, that the ungodly may
not flatter and deceive themselves, when they hear these high attributes
given to God, that he is patient, slow to wrath, merciful, full of
kindness. “Let them,” he says, “at the same time remember the greatness
of God’s power, that they may not think that they have to do with a
child.”

<span id="v.1.iv-p7"></span>We now then see the design of the Prophet:
for this declaration — that God hastens not suddenly to wrath, but
patiently defers and suspends the punishment which the ungodly deserve.
This declaration would not have harmonized with the present argument,
had not the Prophet introduced it by way of concession; as though he
said, — “I see that the world everywhere trifle with God, and that the
ungodly delude themselves with such Sophistries, that they reject all
threatening. I indeed allow that God is ready to pardon, and that he
descends not to wrath, except when he is constrained by extreme
necessity: all this is indeed true; but yet know, that God is armed with
his own power: escape then shall none of those who allow themselves the
liberty of abusing his patience, notwithstanding the insolence they
manifest towards him.”

<span id="v.1.iv-p8"></span>He now adds, *By clearing he will not
clear.* Some translate, “The innocent, he will not render innocent.” But
the real meaning of this sentence is the same with that in <span
id="v.1.iv-p8.1"></span>[Ex 34](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#000.md)<span
id="v.1.iv-p8.1"></span>; and what Moses meant was, that God is
irreconcilable to the impenitent. It has another meaning at the end of
<span id="v.1.iv-p8.2"></span>[Joe
3](../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#000.md)<span id="v.1.iv-p8.2"></span>, where
it is said, ‘I will cleanse the blood which I have not cleansed.’ On
that text interpreters differ; because they regard not the change in the
tense of the verb; for God means, that he would cleanse the filth and
defilements of his Church, which he had not previously cleansed. But
Moses means, that God deals strictly with sinners, so as to remit no
punishment. By clearing then I will not clear; that is, God will rigidly
demand an account of all the actions of men; and as there is nothing hid
from him, so everything done wickedly by men must come forth, when God
ascends his tribunal; he will not clear by clearing, but will rigidly
execute his judgment.

<span id="v.1.iv-p9"></span>There seems to be some inconsistency in
saying, — that God is reconcilable and ready to pardon, — and yet that
by clearing he will not clear. But the aspect of things is different. We
have already stated what the Prophet had in view: for inasmuch as the
ungodly ever promise impunity to themselves, and in this confidence
petulantly deride God himself, the Prophet answers them, and declares,
that there was no reason why they thus abused God’s forbearance, for he
says, By clearing he will not clear, that is, the reprobate: for our
salvation consists in a free remission of sins; and whence comes our
righteousness, but from the imputation of God, and from this — that our
sins are buried in oblivion? yea, our whole clearing depends on the
mercy of God. But God then exercises also his judgment, and by clearing
he clears, when he remits to the faithful their sins; for the faithful
by repentance anticipate his judgment; and he searches their hearts,
that he may clear them. For what is repentance but condemnation, which
yet turns out to be the means of salvation? As then God absolves none
except the condemned, our Prophet here rightly declares, *that by
clearing he will not clears* that is, he will not remit their sins,
except he tries them and discharges the office of a judge; in short,
that no sin is remitted by God which he does not first condemn. But with
regard to the reprobate, who are wholly obstinate in their wickedness,
the Prophet justly declares this to them, — that they have no hope of
pardon, as they perversely adhere to their own devices, and think that
they can escape the hand of God: the Prophet tells them that they are
deceived, for God passes by nothing, and will not blot out one sin,
until all be brought to mind.

<span id="v.1.iv-p10"></span>He afterwards says, that *the way of God is
in the whirlwind and the tempest;* that is, that God, as soon as he
shows himself, disturbs the whole atmosphere, and excites storms and
tempests: and this must be applied to the subject in hand; for the
appearance of God is in other places described as lovely and gracious:
nay, what else but the sight of God exhilarated the faithful? As soon as
God turns away his face, they must necessarily be immersed in dreadful
darkness, and be surrounded with horrible terrors. Why then does the
Prophet say here, that the *way of God is in the whirlwind and storms?*
Even because his discourse is addressed to the ungodly, or to the
despisers of God himself, as in <span id="v.1.iv-p10.1"></span>[Ps
18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#000.md)<span id="v.1.iv-p10.1"></span>;
where we see him described as being very terrible, — that clouds and
darkness are around him, that he moves the whole earth, that he thunders
on every side, that he emits smoke frown his nostrils, and that he fills
the whole world with fire and burning. For what purpose was this done?
Because David’s object was to set forth the judgments of God, which he
had executed on the ungodly. So it is in this place; for Nahum speaks of
the future vengeance, which was then nigh the Assyrians; hence he says,
*The way of God is in the whirlwind and tempest;* that is, when God goes
forth, whirlwinds and tempests are excited by his presence, and the
whole world is put in confusion.

<span id="v.1.iv-p11"></span>He adds, *that the clouds are the dust of
his feet* When any one with his feet only moves the dust within a small
space, some dread is produced: but God moves the dust, not only in one
place, — what then? he obscures, and thus covers the whole heaven, *The
clouds then are the dust of his feet*  <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) We now apprehend the whole meaning of
the Prophet, and the purpose for which this description is given. Of the
same import is what follows —

<span id="v.1.v"></span>

<span id="v.1.v-p1"></span><span id="v.1.v-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#004.md)<span id="v.1.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.v-p2"></span>**4.** He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it
dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and
the flower of Lebanon languisheth.

<span id="v.1.v-p3"></span>**4.** Increpat mare et arefaciet illud (hoc
est, simulac mare increpuerit, arefaciet;) et omnia flumina exiccat,
infirmatur (vel aboletur) Basan et Carmelus, et germen Libani aboletur
(vel, infirmatur, est idem verbum.)

<span id="v.1.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.v-p5"></span><span id="v.1.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.v-p6"></span>Nahum continues his discourse, — that God, in
giving proof of his displeasure, would disturb the sea or make it dry.
There may be here an allusion to the history, described by Moses; for
the Prophets, in promising God’s assistance to his people, often remind
them how God in a miraculous manner brought up their fathers from Egypt.
As then the passage through the Red Sea was in high repute among the
Jews, it may be that the Prophet alluded to that event, (<span
id="v.1.v-p6.1"></span>[Ex 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.1.v-p6.1"></span>.) But another view seems to me more probable. We
indeed know how impetuous an element is that of the sea; and hence in
<span id="v.1.v-p6.2"></span>[Jer
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022.md)<span id="v.1.v-p6.2"></span>,
God, intending to set forth his own power, says, that it is in his power
to calm the raging of the sea, than which nothing is more impetuous or
more violent. In the same manner also is the majesty of God described in
<span id="v.1.v-p6.3"></span>[Job
28](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#000.md)<span id="v.1.v-p6.3"></span>. The
meaning of this place, I think, is the same, — that *God by his chiding
makes the sea dry,*  <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) and that he
can *dry up the rivers* That the prophet connects rivers with the sea,
confirms what I have just said, — that the passage through the Red Sea
is not here referred to; but that the object is to show in general how
great is God’s power in governing the whole world.

<span id="v.1.v-p10"></span>To the same purpose is what he adds, *Bashan
shall be weakened, and Carmel, and the branch of Lebanon shall be
weakened,* or destroyed. By these words he intimates, that there is
nothing so magnificent in the world, which God changes not, when he
gives proofs of his displeasure; as it is said in <span
id="v.1.v-p10.1"></span>[Psalm
104](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#000.md)<span id="v.1.v-p10.1"></span>,

<span id="v.1.v-p11"></span>‘Send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be
renewed;’

<span id="v.1.v-p12"></span>and again, ‘Take away thy Spirit,’ or remove
it, ‘and all things will return to the dust;’ yea, into nothing. So also
Nahum says in this place, “As soon as God shows his wrath, the rivers
will dry up, the sea itself will become dry, and then the flowers will
fade and the grass will wither;” that is, though the earth be
wonderfully ornamented and replenished, yet all things will be reduced
to solitude and desolation whenever God is angry. And he afterwards adds
—

<span id="v.1.vi"></span>

<span id="v.1.vi-p1"></span><span id="v.1.vi-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#005.md)<span id="v.1.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.vi-p2"></span>**5.** The mountains quake at him, and the
hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and
all that dwell therein.

<span id="v.1.vi-p3"></span>**5.** Montes concutientur ab eo (vel,
contremiscent, quanquam notat continuum actum; sensus est igitur, montes
contremiscere ad nutum ejus,) et colles dissolvent se (hoc est,
solvuntur, vel, liquefiunt,) et ardet terra a facie ejus, et orbis et
omnes qui habitant in eo.

<span id="v.1.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.vi-p5"></span><span id="v.1.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.vi-p6"></span>Nahum continues still on the same subject, —
that when God ascended his tribunal and appeared as the Judge of the
world, he would not only shake all the elements, but would also
constrain them to change their nature. For what can be less consonant to
nature than for mountains to tremble, and for hills to be dissolved or
to melt? This is more strange than what we can comprehend. But the
Prophet intimates that the mountains cannot continue in their own
strength, but as far as they are sustained by the favor of God. As soon,
then, as God is angry, the mountains melt like snow, and flow away like
water. And all these things are to be applied to this purpose, and are
designed for this end, — that the wicked might not daringly despise the
threatening of God, nor think that they could, through his forbearance,
escape the punishment which they deserved: for he will be their Judge,
however he may spare them; and though God is ready to pardon, whenever
men hate themselves on account of their sins, and seriously repent; he
will be yet irreconcilable to all the reprobate and the perverse. *The
mountains,* then, *before him tremble, and the hills dissolve* or melt.

<span id="v.1.vi-p7"></span>This useful instruction may be gathered from
these words, that the world cannot for a moment stand, except as it is
sustained by the favor and goodness of God; for we see what would
immediately be, as soon as God manifests the signals of his judgment.
Since the very solidity of mountains would be as snow or wax, what would
become of miserable men, who are like a shadow or an apparition? They
would then vanish away as soon as God manifested his wrath against them,
as it is so in <span id="v.1.vi-p7.1"></span>[Ps
39](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#000.md)<span id="v.1.vi-p7.1"></span>, that
men pass away like a shadow. This comparison ought ever to be remembered
by us whenever a forgetfulness of God begins to creep over us, that we
may not excite his wrath by self-complacencies, than which there is
nothing more pernicious. *Burned,*  <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) *then shall be the earth, and the
world, and all who dwell on it*

<span id="v.1.vii"></span>

<span id="v.1.vii-p1"></span>Prayer.

<span id="v.1.vii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou settest
before us here as in a mirror how dreadful thy wrath is, we may be
humbled before thee, and of our ownselves cast ourselves down, that we
may not be laid prostrate by thy awful power, — O grant, that we may by
this instruction be really prepared for repentance, and so suppliantly
deprecate that punishment which we daily deserve through our
transgressions, that in the meantime we may be also transformed into the
image of thy Son, and put off all our depraved lusts, and be cleansed
from our vices, until we shall at length appear in confidence before
thee, and be gathered among thy children, that we may enjoy the eternal
inheritance of thy heavenly kingdom, which has been obtained for us by
the blood of thy Son. Amen.

<span id="v.1.viii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundredth

<span id="v.1.ix"></span>

<span id="v.1.ix-p1"></span><span id="v.1.ix-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#006.md)<span id="v.1.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.ix-p2"></span>**6.** Who can stand before his indignation?
and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out
like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.

<span id="v.1.ix-p3"></span>**6.** Coram indignatione ejus quis stabit?
Et quis consistet in furore irae ejus? Furor ejus effunditur tanquam
ignis, et rupes solvuntur ab eo.

<span id="v.1.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.ix-p5"></span><span id="v.1.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.ix-p6"></span>The Prophet shows here why he gave in the
part noticed in the last lecture, such an awful description of God; it
was that men might know, that when they shall come before his tribunal,
no one will be able to stand unless supported by his favor. Of the
Prophet’s main object we have sufficiently spoken, nor is it necessary
to repeat here what has been stated. It is enough to bear this in mind,
— that as the enemies of the Church relied on their power; and daringly
and immoderately raged against it, the judgment of God is here set
before them, that they might understand that an account was to be
rendered to him whose presence they were not able to bear. But the
question has more force than if the Prophet had simply said, that the
whole world could not stand before God: for he assumes the character of
one adjuring. After having shown how terrible God is, he exclaims, *Who
shall stand before his indignation? and who shall be able to bear his
wrath?*  <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) for his indignation, he
says, is poured forth as fire. The Hebrew interpreters have here toiled
in vain: as the verb <span id="v.1.ix-p13.1"></span>נתך, *nutae,* means
to pour forth it seems to them an inconsistent expression, that the
wrath of God should be poured forth as fire; for this would be more
suitably said of some metal than of fire. But to be poured forth here is
nothing else than to be scattered far and wide. *Poured forth* then *is
thy wrath as fire;* that is, it advances every moment, as when a fire
seizes a whole forest; and when it grows strong, we know how great is
its violence, and how suddenly it spreads here and there. But if a
different meaning be preferred, I do not much object to it, “His wrath,
which is like fire, is poured out.”

<span id="v.1.ix-p14"></span>Some think that the Prophet alludes to
lightnings, which, as it were, melt through the air, at least as they
appear to us. But as the meaning of the Prophet is sufficiently evident,
there is no need of anxiously inquiring how fire is poured out: for I
have already mentioned, that the Prophet means no other thing than the
wrath of God spreads itself, so that it immediately takes hold, not only
of one city but also of the widest regions and of the whole world, and
is therefore like fire, for it passes through here and there, and that
suddenly.

<span id="v.1.ix-p15"></span>He then says, that *rocks are* also
*broken* or dissolved *before him* We must be aware how great our
brittleness is. Since there is no hardness which melts not before God,
how can men, who flow away of themselves like water, be so daring as to
set themselves up against him? We hence see that the madness of men is
here rebuked, who, trusting in their own strength, dare to contend even
with God, because they forget their own frailty. This is the import of
the whole. It now follows —

<span id="v.1.x"></span>

<span id="v.1.x-p1"></span><span id="v.1.x-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#007.md)<span id="v.1.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.x-p2"></span>**7.** The Lord *is* good, a strong hold in
the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.

<span id="v.1.x-p3"></span>**7.** Bonus Jehova ad fortitudinem in die
angustiae, et cognoscens sperantes in se.

<span id="v.1.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.x-p5"></span><span id="v.1.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.x-p6"></span>The Prophet expresses more clearly here what
we referred to in our last lecture, — that God is hard and severe toward
refractory men, and that he is merciful and kind to the teachable and
the obedient, — not that God changes his nature, or that like Proteus he
puts on various forms; but because he treats men according to their
disposition.  <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) As then the
Prophet has hitherto taught us, that God’s wrath cannot be sustained by
mortals; so now, that no one might complain of extreme rigor, he, on the
other hand, shows that God favors what is right and just, that he is
gentle and mild to the meek, and therefore ready to bring help to the
faithful, and that he leaves none of those who trust in him destitute of
his aid.

<span id="v.1.x-p8"></span>First, by saying that *God is good,* he turns
aside whatever might be objected on the ground of extreme severity.
There is indeed nothing more peculiar to God than goodness. Now when he
is so severe, that the very mention of his name terrifies the whole
world, he seems to be in a manner different from himself. Hence the
Prophet now shows that whatever he had hitherto said of the dreadful
judgment of God, is not inconsistent with his goodness. Though God then
is armed with vengeance against his enemies he yet ceases not to be like
himself, nor does he forget his goodness. But the Prophet does here also
more fully confirm the Israelites and the Jews in the belief, that God
is not only terrible to the ungodly, but that, as he has promised to be
the guardian of his Church, he would also succor the faithful, and in
time alleviate their miseries. *Good* then *is Jehovah;* and it is added
*for help* The intention of the Prophet may be hence more clearly
understood, when he says that he is for strength in the day of distress;
as though he said, — “God is ever ready to bring help to his people:”
 <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) And he adds, *in the day of
distress,* that the faithful may not think that they are rejected, when
God tries their patience by adversities. How much soever then God may
subject his people to the cross and to troubles, he still succors them
in their distress.

<span id="v.1.x-p12"></span>He lastly adds, *He knows them who hope in
him.* This to know, is no other thing than not to neglect them. Hence
God is said to know them who hope in him, because he always watches over
them, and takes care of their safety: in short, this knowledge is
nothing else but the care of God, or his providence in preserving the
faithful. The Prophet, at the same time, distinguishes the godly and
sincere worshipers of God from hypocrites: when God leaves many
destitute who profess to believe in him, he justly withholds from them
his favor, for they do not from the heart call on him or seek him.

<span id="v.1.x-p13"></span>We now then understand the Prophet’s
meaning. He shows, on the one hand, that God is armed with power to
avenge his enemies; And, on the other, he shows that God, as he has
promised, is a faithful guardian of his Church. How is this proved? He
sets before us what God is, that he is good; and then adds, that he is
prepared to bring help. But he does not in vain mention this particular,
— that he takes care of the faithful, who truly, and from the heart,
hope in him; it is done, that they may understand that they are not
neglected by God, and also that hypocrites may know that they are not
assisted, because their profession is nothing else but dissimulation,
for they hope not sincerely in God, however they may falsely boast of
his name. It now follows —

<span id="v.1.xi"></span>

<span id="v.1.xi-p1"></span><span id="v.1.xi-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#008.md)<span id="v.1.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xi-p2"></span>**8.** But with an overrunning flood he will
make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his
enemies.

<span id="v.1.xi-p3"></span>**8.** Et cum inundatione (vel, per
inundationem) transiens consumptionem faciet locoejus; et inimicos ejus
persequentur tenebrae (vel, persequi faciet inimicos suos a tenebris.)

<span id="v.1.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.xi-p5"></span><span id="v.1.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xi-p6"></span>The Prophet goes on with the same subject, —
that God can easily preserve his people, for he is armed with power
sufficient to overcome the whole world. But the Prophet now includes the
two things which have been mentioned: Having spoken in general of God’s
wrath, and of his goodness towards the faithful, he now applies his
doctrine to the consolation of his chosen people. It is then a special
application of his doctrine, when he says, *By inundation, he, passing
through, will make a consummation in her place* There is a twofold
interpretation of this verse.

<span id="v.1.xi-p7"></span>Some make this distinction, — that God, as
it were, in passing through, would consume the land of Israel and Judah,
but that perpetual darkness would rest on his enemies. Hence they think,
that the distress of the chosen people is distinguished from the
overthrow of the kingdom of Asshur, for God would only for a time punish
his own people, while he would give up profane and reprobate men to
endless destruction. Then, by *passing through,* must be understood,
according to these interpreters, a temporary distress or punishment; and
by *darkness,* eternal ruin, or, so to speak, irreparable calamities.
But the Prophet, I doubt not, in one connected sentence, denounces
ultimate ruin on the Assyrians. *By inundation, then, he, in passing,
will make a consummation in her place;* that is, God will suddenly
overwhelm the Assyrian, as though a deluge should rise to cover the
whole earth. He intimates, that God would not punish the Assyrians by
degrees, as men sometimes do, who proceed step by step to avenge
themselves, but suddenly. God, he says, will of a sudden thunder against
the Assyrians, as when a deluge comes over a land. Hence this passing of
God is opposed to long or slow progress; as though he said — “As soon as
God’s wrath shall break forth or come upon the Assyrians, it will be all
over, for a consummation will immediately follow: by inundation, he,
passing through, will make a consummation in her place.”  <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) By place he means the ground; as
though he had said that God would not only destroy the face of the land,
but would also destroy the very grounds and utterly demolish it. A
feminine pronoun is here added, because he speaks of the kingdom or
nation, as it is usual in Hebrew. But it ought especially to be noticed
that the Prophet threatens the Assyrians, that God would entirely
subvert them, that he would not only demolish the surface, as, when fire
or waters destroy houses, but that the Lord would reduce to nothing the
land itself, even the very ground.

<span id="v.1.xi-p11"></span>He adds, *And pursue his enemies shall
darkness* He has designated the Assyrians only by a pronoun, as the
Hebrews are wont to do; for they set down a pronoun relative or
demonstrative, and it is uncertain of whom they speak; but they
afterwards explain themselves. So does the Prophet in this place; for he
directs his discourse to the Israelites and the Jews, and he begins by
announcing God’s vengeance on Nineveh and its monarchy; but now he
speaks as of a thing sufficiently known and adds, *Pursue shall darkness
the enemies of God* By this second clause he intimates that the ruin of
that kingdom would be perpetual. As then he had said that its
destruction would be sudden, as God would, as it were, in a moment
destroy the whole land; so now he cuts off from them every hope, that
they might not think that they could within a while gather strength and
rise again as it is the case with the wicked, who ever contend against
God. The Prophet then shows that evil which God would bring on them
would be without remedy. Some render the verb <span
id="v.1.xi-p11.1"></span>יררף, *iredaph,* transitively in this form, “He
will pursue his enemies by darkness:” but as to the meaning of the
Prophet there is but little or no difference; I therefore leave the
point undecided. On the subject itself there is nothing ambiguous; the
import of what is said is, — that God would, by a sudden inundation,
destroy his enemies, — and that he would destroy them without affording
any hope of restoration, for perpetual darkness would follow that sudden
deluge. He afterwards adds —

<span id="v.1.xii"></span>

<span id="v.1.xii-p1"></span><span id="v.1.xii-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009.md)<span id="v.1.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xii-p2"></span>**9.** What do ye imagine against the Lord?
he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.

<span id="v.1.xii-p3"></span>**9.** Quid cogitatis contra Jehovam?
Consumptionem ipse facit; non consurget iterum afflictio.

<span id="v.1.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.xii-p5"></span><span id="v.1.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xii-p6"></span>Some interpreters so consider this verse
also, as though the Prophet had said, that the calamity of the chosen
people would not be a destruction, as God would observe some moderation
and keep within certain limits. The unbelieving, we know, immediately
exult, whenever the children of God are oppressed by adverse things, as
though it were all over with the Church. Hence the Prophet here,
according to these interpreters, meets and checks this sort of
petulance, What imagine ye against God? He will indeed afflict his
Church, but he will not repeat her troubles, for he will be satisfied
with one affliction. They also think that the kingdom of Judah is here
compared with the kingdom of Israel: for the kingdom of Israel had been
twice afflicted: for, first, four tribes had been led away, and then the
whole kingdom had been overturned. As then one calamity had been
inflicted by Shalmanezar, and another by Tiglathpilezar, they suppose
that there is here an implied comparison, as though the Prophet said,
“God will spare the kingdom of Judah, and will not repeat his vengeance,
as it happened to the kingdom of Israel.” But this meaning is forced and
too far-fetched. The Prophet then, I doubt not, continues here his
discourse, and denounces perpetual ruin on the enemies of the Church. He
says first, *What imagine ye against Jehovah?* He exults over the
Assyrians, because they thought that they had to do only with mortals,
and also with a mean people, and now worn out by many misfortunes. For
we know that the kingdom of Judah had been weakened by many wars before
the Assyrians made an irruption into the land: they had suffered two
severe and grievous attacks from their neighbors, the king of Israel and
the king of Syria; for then it was that they made the Assyrians their
confederates. When therefore the Assyrians came against Judea, they
thought that they would have no trouble in obtaining victory, as they
engaged in war with an insignificant people, and as we have said, worn
out by evils. But the Prophet shows here that the war was with the
living God, and not with men, as they falsely thought. *What* then
*imagine ye against Jehovah?* as though he said, “Know ye not that this
people are under the care and protection of God? Ye cannot then attack
the kingdom of Judah without having God as your opponent. As it is
certain that this people are defended by a divine power, there is no
reason for you to think that you will be victorious.” At the same time,
I know not why the Prophet’s words should be confined to the tribe of
Judah, since the purpose was to comfort the Israelites as well as the
Jews.

<span id="v.1.xii-p7"></span>Now this is a very useful doctrine; for the
Prophet teaches us in general, that the ungodly, whenever they harass
the Church, not only do wrong to men, but also fight with God himself;
for he so connects us with himself, that all who hurt us touch the apple
of his eye, as he declares in another place, (<span
id="v.1.xii-p7.1"></span>[Zec 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.1.xii-p7.1"></span>.) We may then gather invaluable comfort from
these words; for we can fully and boldly set up this shield against our
enemies, — that they devise their counsels, and make efforts against
God, and assail him; for he takes us under his protection for this end,
that whenever we are injured, he may stand in the middle as our
defender. This is one thing.

<span id="v.1.xii-p8"></span>Now in the second clause he adds, that he
will make a complete end, *Rise up again shall not distress;* that is,
God is able to reduce you to nothing, so that there will be no need to
assail you the second time. This passage, we know, has been turned to
this meaning, — that God does not punish men twice nor exceed moderation
in his wrath: but this is wholly foreign to the mind of the Prophet. I
have also said already that I do not approve of what others have said,
who apply this passage to the Church and especially to the kingdom of
Judah. For I thus simply interpret the words of the Prophet, — that God
can with one onset, when it seems good to him, so destroy his enemies,
that there will be no need of striving with them the second time: *Il
n’y faudra plus retourner,* as we say in our language. God then will
make a full end; that is, he will be able in one moment to demolish his
enemies and the ruin will be complete, that is, the wasting will be
entire. There will be no *distress again* or the second time; for it
will be all over with the enemies of God; not that God observes always
the same rule when he punishes his enemies, nor does Nahum here
prescribe any general rule; but he simply means, that God, whenever it
pleases him, instantly destroys his enemies. He afterwards adds —

<span id="v.1.xiii"></span>

<span id="v.1.xiii-p1"></span><span id="v.1.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#010.md)<span id="v.1.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xiii-p2"></span>**10.** For while *they be* folden
together *as* thorns, and while they are drunken *as* drunkards, they
shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.

<span id="v.1.xiii-p3"></span>**10.** Qui ad spinas perplexas et tanquam
potatione sua ebrios (vel, et ebrios ubi inebriati fuerint; potest enim
duplex sensus; postea) devorabuntur tanquam stipulae ariditatis planae
(vel, quasi stipula ariditatis in plenitudine, vel, arida in
plenitudine.)

<span id="v.1.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.xiii-p5"></span><span id="v.1.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xiii-p6"></span>He goes on with this same subject, — that
Gods when he pleases to exercise his power, can, with no difficulty,
consume his enemies: for the similitude, which is here added, means
this, — that nothing is safe from God’s vengeance; for by perplexed
thorns he understands things difficult to be handled. When thorns are
entangled, we dare not, with the ends of our fingers, to touch their
extreme parts; for wherever we put our hands, thorns meet and prick us.
As then pricking from entangled thorns make us afraid, so none of us
dare to come nigh them. Hence the Prophet says, they who are as
*entangled thorns;* that is “However thorny ye may be, however full of
poison, full of fury, full of wickedness, full of frauds, full of
cruelty, ye may be, still the Lord can with one fire consume you, and
consume you without any difficulty.” They were then as entangled thorns.

<span id="v.1.xiii-p7"></span>And then, *as drunken by their own
drinking*. If we read so, the meaning is, — God or God’s wrath will come
upon you as on drunker men; who, though they exult in their own
intemperance, are yet enervated, and are not fit for fighting, for they
have weakened their strength by extreme drinking. There seems indeed to
be much vigor in a drunken man, for he swaggers immoderately and foams
out much rage; but yet he may be cast down by a finger; and even a child
can easily overcome a drunken person. It is therefore an apt similitude,
— that God would manage the Assyrians as the drunken are wont to be
managed; for the more audacity there is in drunken men, the easier they
are brought under; for as they perceive no danger, and are, as it were,
stupefied, so they run headlong with greater impetuosity. “In like
manners” he says, “extreme satiety will be the cause of your ruin, when
I shall attack you. Ye are indeed very violent; but all this your fury
is altogether drunkenness: *Come,* he says, *to you shall the vengeance
of God as to those drunken with their own drinking*  <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md)

<span id="v.1.xiii-p11"></span>Some render the last words, “To the
drunken according to their drinking;” and this sense also is admissible;
but as the Prophet’s meaning is still the same, I do not contend about
words. Others indeed give to the Prophet’s words a different sense: but
I doubt not but that he derides here that haughtiness by which the
Assyrians were swollen, and compares it to drunkenness; as though he
said, “Ye are indeed more than enough inflated and hence all tremble at
your strength; but this your excess rather debilitates and weakens your
powers. When God then shall undertake to destroy you as drunken men,
your insolence will avail you nothing; but, on the contrary, it will be
the cause of your ruin as ye offer yourselves of your own accord; and
the Lord will easily cast you down, as when one, by pushing a drunken
man, immediately throws him on the ground.”

<span id="v.1.xiii-p12"></span>And these comparisons ought to be
carefully observed by us: for when there seems to be no probability of
our enemies being destroyed, God can with one spark easily consume them.
How so? for as fire consumes thorns entangled together, which no man
dares to touch, so God can with one spark destroy all the wicked,
however united together they may be. And the other comparison affords us
also no small consolation; for when our enemies are insolent, and throw
out high swelling words, and seem to frighten and to shake the whole
world with their threatening, their excess is like drunkenness; there is
no strength within; they are frantic but not strong, as is the case with
all drunken men.

<span id="v.1.xiii-p13"></span>And he says, *They shall be devoured as
stubble of full dryness* <span id="v.1.xiii-p13.1"></span>מלא, *mela,*
means not only to be full, but also to be perfect or complete. Others
render the words, “As stubble full of dryness,” but the sense is the
same. He therefore intimates, that there would be nothing to prevent God
from consuming the enemies of his Church; for he would make dry their
whole vigor, so that they would differ nothing from stubble, and that
very dry, which is in such a state, that it will easily take fire. It
follows —

<span id="v.1.xiv"></span>

<span id="v.1.xiv-p1"></span><span id="v.1.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Nahum

<span id="v.1.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.xiv-p5"></span><span id="v.1.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xiv-p6"></span>The Prophet now shows why God was so
exceedingly displeased with the Assyrians, and that was, because he
would, as a protector of his Church, defend the distressed against those
who unjustly oppressed them. The Prophet then designed here to give the
Jews a firm hope, so that they might know that God had a care for their
safety; for if he had only threatened the Assyrians without expressing
the reason, of what avail could this have been to the Jews? It is indeed
gratifying and pleasing when we see our enemies destroyed; but this
would be a cold and barren comfort, except we were persuaded that it is
done by God’s judgment, because he loves us, because he would defend us,
having embraced us with paternal love; but when we know this, we then
triumph even when in extreme evils. We are indeed certain of our
salvation, when God testifies, and really proves also, that he is not
only propitious to us, but that our salvation is an object of his care.
This is the Prophet’s design when he thus addresses Nineveh.

<span id="v.1.xiv-p7"></span>*From thee has gone forth a devisor of evil
against Jehovah, an impious adviser* The manner of speaking is much more
emphatical, when he says, that the Assyrians consulted against God, than
if he had said, that they had consulted against the Jews, or consulted
against the chosen people of God.

<span id="v.1.xiv-p8"></span>But though this was said of the Jews, let
us yet remember that it belongs also to us. The Prophet confirms the
doctrine which I lately alluded to, that whenever the ungodly cause
trouble to us, they carry on war with God himself, that whenever they
devise any evil against us, they run headlong against him. For God sets
up himself as a shield, and declares, that he will protect under the
shadow of his wings all those who commit themselves to his protection.
If we then lie hid under the guardianship of God, and flee to him in all
our adversities, and while patiently enduring all wrongs, implore his
protection and help, whosoever then will rise up against us will have
God as his enemy. Why so? because he consults against him. And this
reason shows, that whatever the Prophet has hitherto said against the
Assyrians ought to be extended indiscriminately to all the enemies of
the Church. For why did God threaten the Assyrians with a sudden
inundation and with perpetual darkness? The reason is here subjoined, —
because they consulted against him and his Church. The same thing then
will also happen to our enemies, provided we remain quiet, as it has
been said, under the protection of God.

<span id="v.1.xiv-p9"></span>But when he says that he *had gone forth
from that city who contrived evil against Jehovah,* — this ought not to
be confined to Sennacherib, but must rather be viewed as common to all
the Assyrians; as though he said, “Thou produces the fruit which thou
shalt eat; for from thee will arise the cause of thy ruin. There is no
reason for thee to expostulate with God, as though he cruelly raged
against thee; for from thee has gone forth he who devised evil against
Jehovah: thou reapest now the reward worthy of thy bringing forth; for
where have originated counsels against the Church of God, except in
thine own bosom, and in thine own bowels? The evil then which has
proceeded from thee shall return on thine own head.”

<span id="v.1.xiv-p10"></span>He then adds, *An impious consulter,* or
counselor, <span id="v.1.xiv-p10.1"></span>בליעל יועף, *ivots beliol*.
Respecting the word <span id="v.1.xiv-p10.2"></span>בליעל, *beliol,* the
Hebrews themselves are not agreed. There are those who suppose it to be
a compound word, <span id="v.1.xiv-p10.3"></span>בל יעל, It profits not;
and they think that it is applied to designate things of nought as well
as men of nought.  <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) There are
others who, like *Jerome,* render it, Without a yoke, but without
reason. Then *Beliol,* is properly a vain thing, which is wholly
unsubstantial; and so it designates a man in whom there is no integrity.
It is also applied to all the wicked, and to their crimes: hence a thing
or work of Belial is said to be any heinous sin or a detestable crime;
and the man who acts perversely and wickedly is called Belial. And Paul
takes Belial simply for the very gravity of Satan, and of all the
wicked; for he opposes Belial to Christ, (<span
id="v.1.xiv-p11.6"></span>[2Co
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#015)<span id="v.1.xiv-p11.6"></span>..md)
We now then understand the meaning of the Prophet to be this, — that God
denounces war on the Assyrians, because they made war unjustly on his
people, and consulted not only against the Jews, but also against God,
who had taken them, as it has been stated, under his own keeping and
protection. It follows —

<span id="v.1.xv"></span>

<span id="v.1.xv-p1"></span><span id="v.1.xv-p1.1"></span>[Nahum

be* quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he

more.

<span id="v.1.xv-p5"></span><span id="v.1.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xv-p6"></span>The Prophet pursues here the same subject;
but expresses more clearly what might have been doubtful, — that
whatever strength there might be in the Assyrians, it could not resist
the coming of God’s vengeance. For *thus saith Jehovah, Though they be
quiet and also strong,* etc. I cannot now finish this subject, but will
only say this, — The Prophet intimates that though Nineveh promised to
itself a tranquil state, because it was well fortified, and had a wide
and large extent of empire, yet this thy peace, he says, or this thy
confidence and security, shall not be an impediment, that the hand of
God should not be extended to thee. *Though,* then, they be many or
strong etc.; for we can render <span id="v.1.xv-p6.1"></span>רבים,
*rebim,* strong as well as many; but either would suit this place; for
we understand the Prophet’s meaning to be, that all God’s enemies would
be cut off, however secure they might be, while depending on their own
strength and fortresses. The rest to-morrow.

<span id="v.1.xvi"></span>

<span id="v.1.xvi-p1"></span>Prayer.

<span id="v.1.xvi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as thou
sees thy enemies at this day raging with cruel, yea, with diabolic fury
against thy Church, we may find thee to be the same as the faithful in
all former ages had found thee, even a defender of the safety of those
who truly, and with a sincere heart, called on thee, and sought thee in
extreme necessity; and do thou, at this day, stretch forth thine hand,
and so restrain the fury which thou sees is against all thy servants and
thy children, that the wicked may at length really find, even to their
ruin, that they fight not with miserable mortals, disheartened and
without defense, but with thine ineffable power, that they may be
confounded, though not ashamed, and that, however they may glamour
against thee and thine invincible hand, they may yet become an example
and a manifest evidence, that thou art not only faithful in thy
promises, but also armed with power, by which thou canst execute
whatsoever thou hast promised respecting the preservation of thy Church,
until thou at length gatherest us into that blessed rest, which has been
provided for us by the blood of thy Son. Amen.

<span id="v.1.xvii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and First

<span id="v.1.xvii-p2"></span>We stated yesterday what the Prophet meant
by these words, that *though* the Assyrians *were quiet and many,* they
would yet be suddenly *cut off* by the Lord. He clearly intimates, that
the wicked are never so fortified by their own forces or by the help of
others, but that the Lord can, without any difficulty, destroy them.

<span id="v.1.xvii-p3"></span>As to the words, some connect the particle
<span id="v.1.xvii-p3.1"></span>כן, *can* with what he had said, “Though
they be quiet,” and give this version, “Though they be quiet and in like
manner many, that is, though they be secure, thinking themselves safe
from all danger, and so also trust in their own number, yet they shall
be removed.” But the repetition of <span id="v.1.xvii-p3.2"></span>כן in
Hebrew is common; and the sentence may be thus explained, Though they be
quiet, and how many soever they may be, yet thus shall they be removed.
<span id="v.1.xvii-p3.3"></span>וכן וכן, *ucan ucan*, that is, “As they
are many, so also the many shall be destroyed.” With regard to the verb
<span id="v.1.xvii-p3.4"></span> גוזguz, (but some, though not
correctly, derive it from <span id="v.1.xvii-p3.5"></span>גזז, *gezaz*,)
I take it in the sense of removing from the middle, of destroying: it
properly means in Hebrew to remove to a distance, though almost all
interpreters render it, “They are shorn,” which ought rather to be,
“They shall be shorn:” and both the verbs, <span
id="v.1.xvii-p3.6"></span>גוז, *guz* as well as <span
id="v.1.xvii-p3.7"></span>גזז, *gizaz,* mean to clip or shear: but as
the other sense suits the form of the Prophet’s discourse better, I
hesitate not thus to render it, “They shall be taken away,” or
destroyed. What the Prophet next adds, <span
id="v.1.xvii-p3.8"></span>ועבר, *uober*, and he shall pass, is applied
by some to the angel, by whom the army of Sennacherib was destroyed.
Others think that a temporary pestilence is meant; as though he had
said, that it would only pass through. But the Prophet seems to refer to
a former clause, where he said, that God would suddenly destroy the
Assyrians as it were with a sudden and unexpected deluge. This, then, is
the most suitable meaning, that however much the Assyrians excelled in
number of men and in strength, they would yet be suddenly destroyed; for
the Lord would pass through, that is, the Lord would by one onset reduce
them to nothing.  <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md)

<span id="v.1.xvii-p9"></span>Then it follows, *Though* (*and,*
literally) *I have afflicted thee, yet afflict thee will I no more.* But
this sentence must be thus rendered, ‘Though thee have I afflicted, I
will not afflict thee any more.’ The Prophet meets a doubt, which might
have laid hold on the perplexed minds of the faithful; for they saw that
God had been hitherto angry with them. They might then have succumbed
under their griefs had it not been added, that they had indeed been
afflicted for a time, but that God would now put an end to his severity,
for he would no longer afflict them. It is indeed certain, that they
were often afflicted afterwards; but this ought to be confined to what
the Assyrians had done; for we know that our Prophet directed his
predictions chiefly against that monarchy: and then the monarchy of
Babylon succeeded; but it was necessary that Nineveh should be first
subverted, and that the government should be transferred to the
Chaldeans, that the Israelites as well as the Jews might know, that that
monarchy had been overthrown, because it rebelled against God himself by
distressing his own people.

<span id="v.1.xvii-p10"></span>We now then perceive the intention of the
Prophet: after having threatened the Assyrians, he now turns his
discourse to the Israelites, *Though I have afflicted thee, I will no
more afflict thee;* that is, There is no reason for the faithful to
despond, because they have been hitherto severely treated by God; let
them on the contrary remembers that these scourges are temporary, and
that God’s displeasure with his elect people and his Church is such that
he observes moderation; for this must ever be fulfilled, —

<span id="v.1.xvii-p11"></span>‘In the moment of mine indignation I
smote thee;  
but I will show thee perpetual mercies,’ (<span
id="v.1.xvii-p11.2"></span>[Isa
54:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.1.xvii-p11.2"></span>.)

<span id="v.1.xvii-p12"></span>This promise has been once given to the
Church; and it is now in force, and will be in force to the end of the
world. Thus we see that the Prophet obviated a doubt, lest the faithful
should think that there was no hope for them, because they had found God
so severe towards them; for he says that God was satisfied with the
punishment which he had inflicted and that he would no longer afflict
his people. It follows —

<span id="v.1.xviii"></span>

<span id="v.1.xviii-p1"></span><span id="v.1.xviii-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#013.md)<span id="v.1.xviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xviii-p2"></span>**13.** For now will I break his yoke
from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.

<span id="v.1.xviii-p3"></span>**13.** Et nunc conteram (*vel*,
confringam) jugum ejus ab te, et vincula tua disrumpam.

<span id="v.1.xviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.xviii-p5"></span><span id="v.1.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xviii-p6"></span>He confirms what the former verse
contains, — that God would now cease from his rigor; for he says, that
the deliverance of this chosen people was nigh, when God would break
down and reduce to nothing the tyranny of that empire. This verse
clearly shows, that a clause in the preceding verse ought not to be so
restricted as it is by some interpreters, who regard it as having been
said of the slaughter of the army of Sennacherib. But the Prophet
addresses here in common both the Israelites and the Jews, as it is
evident from the context; and this verse also sufficiently proves, the
Prophet does not speak of the Jews only; for they had not been so
subdued by the Assyrians as the Israelites had been. I indeed allow that
they became tributaries; for when they had broken their covenant, the
Assyrian, after having conquered the kingdom of Israel and the kingdom
of Syria, extended his arms at length to Judea. It is then certain, that
they had been in some measure under the yoke; but it was not so hard a
servitude that the words of the Prophet could be applied to it. I
therefore take the expression generally, that God would free from the
tyranny of Nineveh his own people, both the Israelites and the Jews. If
any one objects and says, that the Israelites were never delivered. This
indeed is true; but as to Nineveh, they were delivered when the empire
was transferred to the Chaldeans, and Babylon became the seat of the
empire.

<span id="v.1.xviii-p7"></span>We now then see, that the meaning of our
Prophet is simply this, — that though God by the Assyrians chastised his
people, he yet did not forget his covenant, for the Assyrians were
punished. It was then sufficient for his purpose to say that the Jews as
well as the Israelites were no longer under the yoke of Nineveh, how
much soever they might have afterwards suffered under other tyrants. And
what is said about the yoke being broken, belongs also in some measure
to the Jews; for when we extend this to both, the Israelites and also
the Jews, it would not be unsuitable to say, that they were both under
the yoke and bound with chains. For though the servitude of Israel was
hard, yet the Jews had also been deprived of their liberty. It is then
right that this which is said should be taken generally, *I will now
break his yoke from thee, and thy bonds will I burst*

<span id="v.1.xviii-p8"></span>Now this verse teaches us, that the
people were not so subdued by the tyranny of their enemies, but that
their deliverance was always in the hand and power of God. For how came
it, that the Assyrians prevailed against the Israelites, and then
subjugated the Jews, except that they were as a rod in the hand of God?
So Isaiah teaches us in the tenth chapter. Though they armed themselves,
they were yet but as the weapons and arms of God, for they could not
have made any movement, except the Lord had turned their course,
wherever he pleased, as when one throws a javelin or a dart with his
hand. It follows —

<span id="v.1.xix"></span>

<span id="v.1.xix-p1"></span><span id="v.1.xix-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#014.md)<span id="v.1.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xix-p2"></span>**14.** And the LORD hath given a
commandment concerning thee, *that* no more of thy name be sown: out of
the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten
image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.

<span id="v.1.xix-p3"></span>**14.** Et mandavit super te Jehova, Ne
seminetur ex nomine tuo posthac; e domo (vel, e templo) deorum tuorum
excidam sculptile et conflatile; ponam sepulchrum tuum, quia execrabilis
es (aut, vilis factus es.)

<span id="v.1.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.1.xix-p5"></span><span id="v.1.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xix-p6"></span>Nahum explains more clearly, and without a
figure, what he had previously said of darkness, — that the kingdom of
Nineveh would be so overturned, that it could never recruit its strength
and return again to its pristine state. He indeed addresses the king
himself, but under his person he includes no doubt the whole kingdom.

<span id="v.1.xix-p7"></span>*Commanded* then *has Jehovah,* he says,
*respecting thee, let there not be sown of thy name;* that is, God has
so decreed, that the memory of thy name shall not survive: for to sow
from the name of one, is to extend his fame. When, therefore, God
entirely exterminates a race from the world, or when he obliterates a
nation, he is said to command that there should not be sown of such a
name; that is, that there should be no propagation of that name. In
short, our Prophet denounces on the Assyrians a ruin, from which they
were never to rise again. And when such a command is ascribed to God, it
means, that by the sole bidding of God both nations and kingdoms are
propagated, and are also abolished and destroyed: for what is said of
individuals ought to be extended to all nations, ‘Seed, or the fruit of
the womb,’ as it is said in the Psalms, ‘is the peculiar gift of God,’
(<span id="v.1.xix-p7.1"></span>[Ps
127](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#000)<span id="v.1.xix-p7.1"></span>..md)
For how comes it, that many are without children, while others have a
large and a numerous family, except that God blesses some, and makes
others barren? The same is to be thought of nations; the Lord propagates
them and preserves their memory; but when it seems good to him, he
reduces them to nothing, so that no seed remains. And when the Prophet
testifies, that this is the command of Jehovah, he confirms the faith of
the Israelites and of the Jews, that they might not doubt, but that the
Assyrians would perish without any hope of restoration; for it was so
decreed by Heaven.

<span id="v.1.xix-p8"></span>He afterwards adds, *From the house,* or
from the temple, *of thy gods will I cut off graven images.* It is
probable, and it is the commonly received opinion, that the Prophet
alludes here to Sennacherib, who was slain in the temple of his idol by
his own sons, shortly after his return from Judea, when the siege of the
holy city was miraculously raised through the instrumentality of an
angel. As then he was slain in the temple, and it was by his murder
profaned, I am inclined to receive what almost all others maintain, that
there is here a reference to his person: but, at the same time, the
Prophet no doubt describes, under the person of one king, the
destruction and ruin of the whole kingdom. Gods indeed, did at that time
make known what he had determined respecting the empire of Nineveh and
all the Assyrians; for from this event followed also the change, that
Nebuchodonosor transferred the empire to Babylon, and that the whole
race, and every one who assumed power, became detestable. When,
therefore, the Assyrians were torn by intestine discords, it was an easy
matter for the Chaldeans to conquer them. Hence the Prophet does not
here predict respecting one king only; but as his murder was, as it
were, a prelude of the common ruin, the Prophet relates this history as
being worthy of being remembered, — that the temple would be profaned by
the murder of Sennacherib, and that then the monarchy would be soon
transferred to the Chaldeans.

<span id="v.1.xix-p9"></span>When he says*, I will appoint thy
sepulcher,* he connects this clause with the former; for how was it that
idols were cut off from that temple, except that that tragic deed
rendered the place detestable? For there is no one who feels not a
horror at such a base crime as that of children killing their father
with their own hands. We know when a proud woman at Rome ordered her
chariot to be drawn over the dead body of her father, the road was
counted polluted. So also the temple was no doubt viewed as polluted by
the murder of the king. Then these two clauses ought to be read
together, that God would cut off idols and graven images from the
temple, — and then, that the sepulcher of Sennacherib would be there.

<span id="v.1.xix-p10"></span>He adds, *For thou art execrable*  <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) I have rendered <span
id="v.1.xix-p13.1"></span>קלות, *kolut,* a thing to be abominated. It
may indeed be referred to that history; but I take it by itself as
meaning, that Sennacherib was to be abominable, and not he alone, but
also the whole royal family, and the monarchy of Nineveh. For it is not
consistent, as we have said already, to say, that all these things refer
to the person of Sennacherib; for the Prophet speaks of the destruction
of the city and nation, and that generally; at the same time, this does
not prevent him from referring, as it were, in passing, to the person of
Sennacherib.

<span id="v.1.xix-p14"></span>It must, at the same time, be noticed,
that the vain confidence, which the Assyrian kings placed in their idols
and graven images, is here indirectly reproved; for we know that
idolaters not only confide in their own strength, but that a part of
their hope is also founded on their superstitions. Hence the Prophet
says, that their temple was to be profaned by God, so that no aid would
remain to the Assyrians, to the kings themselves any more than to the
whole people. Let us proceed —

<span id="v.1.xx"></span>

<span id="v.1.xx-p1"></span><span id="v.1.xx-p1.1"></span>[Nahum
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#015.md)<span id="v.1.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xx-p2"></span>**15.**  <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) Behold upon the mountains the feet of
him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy
solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass
through thee; he is utterly cut off.

<span id="v.1.xx-p4"></span>**15.** Ecce super montes pedes
annunciantis, promulgantis pacem: celebra Jehudah solennitates tuas,
redde vota tua; quia non adjiciet posthac ad transeundum in te, impius
(Beliiaal) in totum excisus est.

<span id="v.1.xx-p5"></span> 

<span id="v.1.xx-p6"></span><span id="v.1.xx-p6.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xx-p7"></span>The Prophet again teaches us, that whatever
he prophesied respecting the destruction of the city Nineveh, was for
this end, — that God, by this remarkable evidence, might show that he
had a care for his people, and that he was not unmindful of the covenant
he had made with the children of Abraham. This prophecy would have
otherwise produced no salutary effect on the Israelites; they might have
thought that it was by chance, or by some fatal revolution, or through
some other cause, that Nineveh had been overthrown. Hence the Prophet
shows, that the ruin of the city, and of the monarchy of Nineveh, would
be a proof of the paternal love of God towards his chosen people, and
that such a change was to be made for the sake of one people, because
God, though he had for a time punished the Israelites, yet purposed that
some seed should remain, for it would have been inconsistent, that the
covenant, which was to be inviolate, should be entirely abolished. We
now then understand the Prophet’s object, and how this verse is to be
connected with the rest of the context.

<span id="v.1.xx-p8"></span>*Behold,* he says, *on the mountains the
feet of him who announces peace*  <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) Some think that the Prophet alludes to
the situation of Jerusalem. We indeed know that mountains were around
it: but the Prophet speaks more generally, — that heralds of peace shall
ascend to the tops of mountains, that their voice might be more
extensively heard: *Behold,* he says*, on the mountains the feet of him
who announces peace;* for all the roads had been before closed up, and
hardly any one dared to whisper. If any one inquired either respecting
peace or war, there was immediate danger lest he should fall under
suspicion. As then the Assyrians, by their tyrannical rule, had deprived
the Israelites of the freedom of speech, the Prophet says now, that the
feet of those who should announce peace would be on the mountains; that
is, that there would be now free liberty to proclaim peace on the
highest places. By *feet,* he means, as we have explained, coming; and
Isaiah speaks a similar language,

<span id="v.1.xx-p12"></span>‘How beautiful are the feet of those who
announce peace,  
who announce good things!’ (<span id="v.1.xx-p12.2"></span>[Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007)<span id="v.1.xx-p12.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.1.xx-p13"></span>Arise, then, he says, shall heralds of
peace everywhere: and the repetition in other words seems to express
this still more clearly; for he says, *of him who announces and causes
to hear* He might have simply said <span id="v.1.xx-p13.1"></span>מבשר,
*mebesher*, but he adds <span id="v.1.xx-p13.2"></span>משמיע,
*meshemio*; not only, he says, he will announce peace, but also with a
clear and loud voice, so that his preaching may be heard from the
remotest places. We now perceive what the Prophet had in view, and what
his words import.

<span id="v.1.xx-p14"></span>Now he adds, *Celebrate, Judah, thy festal
days*. It is indeed a repetition of the same word, as if we were to say
in Latin*, Festiva festivitates,* feast festivities; but this has
nothing to do with the meaning of the passage. I am disposed to
subscribe to the opinion of those who think, that there is here an
intimation of the interruption of festal days; for so disordered were
all things at Jerusalem and in the country around, that sacrifices had
ceased, and festal days were also intermitted; for sacred history tells
us, that the Passover was celebrated anew under Hezekiah, and also under
Josiah. This omission no doubt happened, owing to the wars by which the
country had been laid waste. Hence the Prophet now intimates, that there
would be quietness and peace for the chosen people, so that they might
all without any fear ascend to Jerusalem, and celebrate their festal
days, and give thanks to the Lord, and rejoice before him, according to
the language often used by Moses. At the same time, the Prophet no doubt
reminds the Jews for what end the Lord would break off the enemy’s yoke,
and exempt them from servile fear, and that was, that they might
sacrifice to God and worship him, while enjoying their quiet condition.
And that he addresses Judah is not done without reason; for though the
kingdom of Israel was not as yet so rejected, that God did not regard
them as his people, yet there were no legitimate sacrifices among them,
and no festal days which God approved: we indeed know that the worship
which prevailed there was corrupt and degenerated. Inasmuch then as God
repudiated the sacrifices which were offered in Israel, Nahum addresses
here his discourse to Judah only; but yet he intimates, that God had
been thus bountiful to the Israelites, that they, remembering their
deliverance, might give him thanks.

<span id="v.1.xx-p15"></span>Let us then know, that when the Lord grants
us tranquillity and preserves us in a quiet state, this end ought ever
to be kept in view, — that it is his will, that we should truly serve
him. But if we abuse the public peace given us, and if pleasures
occasion a forgetfulness of God, this ingratitude will by no means be
endured. We ought, indeed, in extreme necessities to sacrifice to God,
as we have need then especially of fleeing to his mercy; but as we
cannot so composedly worship him in a disturbed state of mind, he is
pleased to allow us peaceable times. Now, if we misapply this leisure,
and indulge in sloth, yea, if we become so heedless as to neglect God,
this as I have said will be an intolerable evil. Let us then take notice
of the Prophet’s words in setting forth the design of God, — that he
would free his people from the power of the Assyrians, that they might
celebrate their festal days.

<span id="v.1.xx-p16"></span>He adds, *Pay thy vows* He not only speaks
here of the ordinary sacrifices and of the worship which had been
prescribed; but he also requires a special proof of gratitude for having
been then delivered by the hand of God; for we know what paying of vows
meant among the Hebrews: they were wont to offer peace-offerings, when
they returned victorious from war, or when they were delivered from any
danger, or when they were relieved from some calamity. The Prophet
therefore now shows, that it was right to pay vows to God, inasmuch as
he had dealt so bountifully with his people; as it is said in <span
id="v.1.xx-p16.1"></span>[Psalm
116](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#000.md)<span id="v.1.xx-p16.1"></span>,
‘What shall I return to the Lord for all his benefits which he has
bestowed on me? The cup of salvation will I take, and on the name of the
Lord will I call.’ We also find it thus written in Hosea,

<span id="v.1.xx-p17"></span>‘The calves of thy lips to me shalt thou
render,’  
(<span id="v.1.xx-p17.2"></span>[Ho
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002)<span id="v.1.xx-p17.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.1.xx-p18"></span>We now perceive what Nahum substantially
meant, — that when peace was restored, the people were not to bury so
great and so remarkable a kindness of God, but to pay their vows; that
is, that the people were to testify that God was the author of their
deliverance, and that the redemption which they had obtained was the
peculiar work of God.

<span id="v.1.xx-p19"></span>It follows, “Add no more to pass through
thee shall Belial, for utterly is he cut off.” This passage must not be
explained in a general sense; for we know that the Chaldeans became more
grievous to the Jews than the Assyrians had been; but the Prophet here
refers especially to the Ninevites, that is, to the Assyrians, whose
metropolis, as it has been said, was Nineveh. *That wicked one then
shall not add any more to pass through thee.* — *Why? for he is entirely
cut off.* This reason given by the Prophet clearly proves, that he
speaks not of the wicked generally, but that he especially points out
the Assyrians. Now follows —

id="v.1.ii-p6.3"></span>

<span id="v.1.ii-p7"></span> The word comes from <span
id="v.1.ii-p7.1"></span>נשא, to bear, to carry. Some regard it as the
message *carried* or *borne* by the Prophets from God to the people, and
hence the same as Prophecy. Others consider it to be the judgment to be
*borne* by the people respecting whom it was announced. The latter seems
to be its meaning here, where it is said, “the burden of Nineveh.” It
was the judgment laid on them, and which that city was to bear, endure,
and undergo. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_206"></span>[207](cc28019.htm#fr_206.md) <span
id="v.1.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.ii-p10"></span> “It has been thought, and not without
reason, by some, that Capernaum, Heb. <span id="v.1.ii-p10.1"></span>כפד
נחום, most properly rendered, *the village of Nahum,* derived its name
from our Prophet having resided in it.” — *Henderson.*

<span id="fn_207"></span>[208](cc28019.htm#fr_207.md) <span
id="v.1.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.iii-p7"></span> How far this language is right, may be
questioned. The Prophets, under the immediate direction of the Divine
Spirit, can hardly be said to *borrow* from a previous writer. They have
no doubt announced the same sentiments, and in some instances, used the
same words, as those found in the writings of Moses; but they derived
them not from those writings, but from Divine inspiration: and, as
*Calvin* has often observed, they adduced nothing but what they received
from God. But this language is not peculiar to *Calvin:* he adopted it
from the fathers. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_208"></span>[209](cc28019.htm#fr_208.md) <span
id="v.1.iii-p9.2"></span>

<span id="v.1.iii-p10"></span> The following may be proposed as the
literal rendering of this verse, —

<span id="v.1.iii-p11"></span>*A God jealous and an avenger* is
*Jehovah;  
Avenger* is *Jehovah, and one who has indignation:  
Avenger* is *Jehovah on his adversaries,  
And watch does he for his enemies.*

<span id="v.1.iii-p12"></span>God is said to be *jealous* in the second
commandment, being one who will not allow his own honor to be given to
another. *Avenger,* <span id="v.1.iii-p12.1"></span>נקם, is a vindicator
of his own rights; and he is said to have indignation, or hot wrath, or
great displeasure; <span id="v.1.iii-p12.2"></span>בעל חמה, possessor,
holder, or keeper of indignation. *His adversaries,* <span
id="v.1.iii-p12.3"></span>צריו, rather, his oppressors; the oppressors
of his people were his own oppressors. <span
id="v.1.iii-p12.4"></span>נוטר means to watch, rather than to keep. Its
meaning here is to watch the opportunity to take than to keep. Its
meaning here is to watch the opportunity to take vengeance on his
enemies. The description here is remarkable, and exactly adapted to the
oppressive state of the Jews. The dishonor done to God’s people was done
to him. He is jealous, a defender of his own rights, full of
indignation, and watches and waits for a suitable time to execute
vengeance, to vindicate his own honor. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_209"></span>[210](cc28019.htm#fr_209.md) <span
id="v.1.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.iv-p12"></span> I offer the following translation of this
verse, —

<span id="v.1.iv-p13"></span>*Jehovah is slow to wrath, though great in
power;  
Absolving, Jehovah will not absolve:  
In the whirlwind and in the storm* is *his way;  
And the cloud is the dust of his feet.*

<span id="v.1.iv-p14"></span>The second line presents some difficulty.
It is evidently an imperfect sentence; most supply the word, *guilty;*
but rather the “enemies” mentioned before are to be understood. The
meaning appears to be this, — Jehovah is slow to wrath, that is, to
execute his vengeance, though he is great in power, capable of doing so;
but though he delays, he will not eventually clear or absolve his
enemies. With the Septuagint I connect “Jehovah” with the second and not
with the third line, and agreeably with the idiom of the Hebrew; the
verb generally precedes its nominative. The order of the words in Welsh
would be exactly the same, —

<span id="v.1.iv-p15"></span><span id="v.1.iv-p15.1"></span>Gan ddieuogi
ni ddiuoga Jehova.

<span id="v.1.iv-p16"></span>— *Ed.*

<span id="fn_210"></span>[211](cc28019.htm#fr_210.md) <span
id="v.1.v-p6.4"></span>

<span id="v.1.v-p7"></span> Literally, “chiding the sea, he even made it
dry.” The <span id="v.1.v-p7.1"></span>ו here, though conversive, must
be rendered, “even,” for the first verb is a participle. By taking the
words in their poetical order, the whole verse may be thus rendered, —

<span id="v.1.v-p8"></span>Chiding the sea, he even made it dry;  
And all the rivers he dried up:  
Wither did Bashan and Carmel,  
And the bud of Lebanon withered.

<span id="v.1.v-p9"></span>The verbs in this, and in the following
verse, are in the past tense; reference is made to the past works of
God, and in some instances to those performed in the wilderness. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_211"></span>[212](cc28019.htm#fr_211.md) <span
id="v.1.vi-p7.2"></span>

<span id="v.1.vi-p8"></span> This sense has been given to the verb by
the Rabbins, which is inconsistent with it as found here without any
variations, and with the Greek versions. <span
id="v.1.vi-p8.1"></span>תשא is either from <span
id="v.1.vi-p8.2"></span>נשא, to lift up, or from <span
id="v.1.vi-p8.3"></span>שאה, to be laid waste, or to be confounded, the
final <span id="v.1.vi-p8.4"></span>ה being dropped; and this is what
*Newcome* adopts. *Marckius* and *Henderson* take the former meaning in
the sense of being raised up or heaving. “<span
id="v.1.vi-p8.5"></span>Ανεσταλη, was removed,” *Sept.;* “<span
id="v.1.vi-p8.6"></span>Εκινηθη, was moved,” *Symmachus;* “<span
id="v.1.vi-p8.7"></span>Εφριξεν, trembled,” *Aquila.* The idea of being
confounded or laid waste harmonizes best with all parts of the sentence;
for the idea of having does not apply well to the inhabitants. We see
here that all the Greek versions have the verb in the past tense; and so
are the previous verbs in the verse as given in the Septuagint, and
agreeably with the Hebrew.

<span id="v.1.vi-p9"></span>Mountains have shaken through him,  
And hills have melted away;  
And confounded has been the earth at his presence,  
Yea, the world and all its inhabitants.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[213](cc28019.htm#fr_212.md) <span
id="v.1.ix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.ix-p7"></span> 

<span id="v.1.ix-p8"></span>*And who shall rise up against his hot
anger?* — Newcome.  
*And who can subsist in the heat of his anger?* — Henderson.

<span id="v.1.ix-p9"></span>Neither of these versions convey the
meaning. The verb <span id="v.1.ix-p9.1"></span>קום, with a <span
id="v.1.ix-p9.2"></span>ב after it, signifies to rise up against or
resist. <span id="v.1.ix-p9.3"></span>Τις αντιστησεται — Who shall
resist? — *Sept.* So the line should be thus rendered, —

<span id="v.1.ix-p10"></span>And who can resist the burning of his
wrath?

<span id="v.1.ix-p11"></span>This line conveys the same idea as the
former, only in stronger terms. For displeasure or anger we have here
the burning of his wrath, and for standing we have resisting. *Can* is
better than *will;* the Hebrew future ought often to be thus rendered.
With the view of giving the words here used their distinctive character,
I offer the following version of the whole verse, —

<span id="v.1.ix-p12"></span>Before his anger who can stand?  
And who can resist the burning of his wrath?  
His indignation has been poured forth like fire;  
And rocks have been broken in pieces by him.

<span id="v.1.ix-p13"></span>The two last verbs are in the past tense,
and are more expressive when so rendered. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_213"></span>[214](cc28019.htm#fr_213.md) <span
id="v.1.x-p6.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.x-p7"></span> “This glorious description of the Sovereign
of the world, like the pillar of cloud and fire, has a bright side
towards Israel, and a dark side towards the Egyptians.” — *Henry.*

<span id="fn_214"></span>[215](cc28019.htm#fr_214.md) <span
id="v.1.x-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.x-p9"></span> This is no doubt the right view. The object
here is not to assert generally that God is good, but that he is good
for aid and help in the day of distress. The versions then both of
*Newcome* and *Henderson* are faulty; for they divide into two clauses
what is one in the original, —

<span id="v.1.x-p10"></span>*Good* is *Jehovah for protection in the day
of distress;  
And he knoweth them who trust in him.*

<span id="v.1.x-p11"></span>The word <span id="v.1.x-p11.1"></span>מעיז
is from <span id="v.1.x-p11.2"></span>עז, strength, and having the
formative <span id="v.1.x-p11.3"></span>מ, it attains a causative sense,
and means that which affords or gives strength, — a fortress, a
stronghold, or protection. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_215"></span>[216](cc28019.htm#fr_215.md) <span
id="v.1.xi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xi-p8"></span> The first words in this line are better
rendered in our version, “With an overrunning flood,” or, as by
*Newcome,* “With an overflowing torrent,” or as by *Henderson*, “With an
overflowing inundation.” The remaining part has occasioned a variety.
The text as it is, and there are no different readings, is this, “A full
end he will make of her place;” or, as Henderson renders it, “He will
effect a consummation of her place.” The only difficulty is, that “her”
has no near antecedent; but it is not unusual with the Prophets to allow
the general context to supply this. As the vision is the “burden of
Nineveh,” that city is no doubt referred to. *Newcome,* following the
Greek versions, excepting that of Symmachus, translates thus, — “He will
make a full end of those who rise up against him.” But it is better to
follow the Hebrew text; for the many *evident* instances of mistake
which are to be found in those versions forbid us to put any great
confidence in them. The following may be viewed as a literal version: —

<span id="v.1.xi-p9"></span>And with inundation overflowing  
A full end he will make her place;  
And darkness shall his enemies pursue.

<span id="v.1.xi-p10"></span>How completely has this prophecy been
fulfilled! *Lucian,* a Greek heathen author of the second century, has
these remarkable words, — <span id="v.1.xi-p10.1"></span>Νινος μεν
απολωλεν ηδη, και ουδεν ιχνος ετι λοιπον αυτης, ουδ αν ειπης οπου ποτ ην
— “Nineveh has already been destroyed, and there is no vestige of it
remaining, nor can you say where formerly it was.” *Bochart* enumerates
different conjectures which various authors have made as to its
situation, most of them differing from one another. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_216"></span>[217](cc28019.htm#fr_216.md) <span
id="v.1.xiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xiii-p8"></span> *Newcome,* on the sole authority of the
Syriac and the Targum, changes “thorns” into “princes,” and thus wholly
destroys the propriety of the simile of dry stubble at the end of the
verse. *Henderson* says justly, that this change is on no account to be
adopted.

<span id="v.1.xiii-p9"></span>Though like thorns, entwined,  
And as with their drinking drunken,  
They shall be consumed as stubble fully dry.

<span id="v.1.xiii-p10"></span>The particle <span
id="v.1.xiii-p10.1"></span>עד, before “thorns,” is to be here taken as
in <span id="v.1.xiii-p10.2"></span>[1Ch
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch1004.htm#027.md)<span id="v.1.xiii-p10.2"></span>,
as designating likeness. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_217"></span>[218](cc28019.htm#fr_217.md) <span
id="v.1.xiv-p10.4"></span>

<span id="v.1.xiv-p11"></span> “From <span id="v.1.xiv-p11.1"></span>בל,
*not,* and <span id="v.1.xiv-p11.2"></span>יעל, *profit:* — As an
abstract noun, *unprofitableness, worthlessness, wickedness:* — As an
adjective, *worthless, wicked, good for nothing.*” — *Parkhurst.* “It
alludes to *Baal,* the common idol of the natives bordering upon the
Jews, whom the penmen of Scripture changing some letters by way of scorn
called *Belial:* to express a further hatred to this idol, they applied
this name to the devil, <span id="v.1.xiv-p11.3"></span>[2Co
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#015.md)<span id="v.1.xiv-p11.3"></span>;
which word is derived either from a root that signifieth *not to
profit*, or *not to mount upward,* because he seeks the fall of mankind,
and to keep those that are fallen into his snares, <span
id="v.1.xiv-p11.4"></span>[2Ti
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#026.md)<span id="v.1.xiv-p11.4"></span>
*Jerome* fetcheth it from a root, which, with another word, signifieth
*without a yoke,* or, *lawless;* therefore the Septuagint commonly
translate it, <span id="v.1.xiv-p11.5"></span>παρανομος.” — *Leigh.*

<span id="fn_218"></span>[219](cc28019.htm#fr_218.md) <span
id="v.1.xvii-p3.9"></span>

<span id="v.1.xvii-p4"></span> The best and the most literal version of
these two lines, with the exception of the last word, is that of *Dr.
Wheeler,* as given by *Newcome,* —

<span id="v.1.xvii-p5"></span>Though they are at peace, and also
mighty,  
Still shall they be cut off and pass away.

<span id="v.1.xvii-p6"></span>The last verb is in the singular number,
<span id="v.1.xvii-p6.1"></span>ועבד, “and he shall pass through” or
away, that is, the wicked counselor mentioned in the preceding verse.
*Newcome’s* own version is that of new text, which he has himself
formed, from a mere hint derived from the Septuagint. *Henderson’s*
version is the following, —

<span id="v.1.xvii-p7"></span>Though they are complete and so very
numerous,  
Yet in this state they shall be cut off,  
And he shall pass away.

<span id="v.1.xvii-p8"></span>The word <span
id="v.1.xvii-p8.1"></span>שלמים means, no doubt, entire, complete,
perfect, as well as to be at peace, secure, quiet; and may be referred,
as the author says, to the complete condition of the Assyrian army: but
what seems to be intended is the character of the nation. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_219"></span>[220](cc28019.htm#fr_219.md) <span
id="v.1.xix-p10.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xix-p11"></span> 

<span id="v.1.xix-p12"></span>*For thou art become vile.* — Newcome. *  
Because thou art worthless.* — Henderson.

<span id="v.1.xix-p13"></span>Execrable, or accursed, which the word
sometimes means, seems more suitable to the context. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_220"></span>[221](cc28019.htm#fr_220.md) <span
id="v.1.xx-p2.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xx-p3"></span> This forms the first verse of the second
chapter in Hebrew. Most versions have followed the division of the
Septuagint. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_221"></span>[222](cc28019.htm#fr_221.md) <span
id="v.1.xx-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.1.xx-p9"></span> *Calvin* gives to <span
id="v.1.xx-p9.1"></span>מבשר only the sense of announcing or declaring.
To spread or to bring news or tidings is its meaning; for it is used to
designate bad as well as good tidings. See <span
id="v.1.xx-p9.2"></span>[1Sa 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#017.md)<span
id="v.1.xx-p9.2"></span>; <span id="v.1.xx-p9.3"></span>[2Sa
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/sa2001.htm#020.md)<span id="v.1.xx-p9.3"></span>;
and <span id="v.1.xx-p9.4"></span>[2Sa
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2004.htm#010.md)<span id="v.1.xx-p9.4"></span>;
<span id="v.1.xx-p9.5"></span>[Isa
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#007.md)<span id="v.1.xx-p9.5"></span>. It
is commonly rendered <span id="v.1.xx-p9.6"></span>ευαγγελιζεσθαι by the
Septuagint. It may be regarded here as a participle in the same
predicament with the participle which follows. The same mode of
construction we find in <span id="v.1.xx-p9.7"></span>[Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007.md)<span id="v.1.xx-p9.7"></span>;
where it evidently appears that the word means strictly to bring or to
declare tidings, for *good* is added to it. That passage is as follows:
—

<span id="v.1.xx-p10"></span><span id="v.1.xx-p10.1"></span>How
beautiful on the mountains  
Are the feet of him who announceth,  
Who proclaimeth peace, —  
Of him who announceth good, (בוט רשבמ<span id="v.1.xx-p10.5"></span>)  
Who proclaimeth salvation!  
Saying to Zion, Reign doth thy God.

<span id="v.1.xx-p11"></span> — *Ed.*
