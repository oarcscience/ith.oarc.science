<span id="xi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="xi.i"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p1"></span><span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#001.md)<span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p2"></span>**1**. The words of Jeremiah the son of
Hilkiah, of the priests that *were* in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:

<span id="xi.i-p3"></span>**1**. Verba Jeremiae filii Helkiae, ex
sacerdotibus qui erant in Anathoth, in terra Benjamin,

<span id="xi.i-p4"></span>**2**. To whom the word of the LORD came in
the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year
of his reign.

<span id="xi.i-p5"></span>**2**. Nempe (<span id="xi.i-p5.1"></span>אשר
*explicative* hic ponitur) fecit sermo Jehovae ad ipsum, in diebus
Josiea, filii Amon, regis Jehudah, decimo tertio anno regm ejus;

<span id="xi.i-p6"></span>**3**. It came also in the days of Jehoiakim
the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of
Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of
Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.

<span id="xi.i-p7"></span>**3**. Et fuit (*hoc est, perrexit in, cursum
vocationis suae*) diebus Joakim, filii Josiae, regis Jehudah, usque ad
complementum undecimi anni Zedechiae, filii Josiae, regis Jehudah, ad
transmigrationem Jerusalem, mense quinto.

<span id="xi.i-p8"></span> 

<span id="xi.i-p9"></span><span id="xi.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p10"></span>I Have said that the time, when Jeremiah
began to discharge his office of a Prophet in God’s Church, is not
stated here without reason, and that it was when the state of the people
was extremely corrupt, the whole of Religion having become vitiated,
because the Book of the Law was lost: for nowhere else can be found the
rule according to which God is to be worshipped; nor can right knowledge
be obtained from any other source. It was then, at the time when impiety
had by a long custom prevailed among the Jews, that Jeremiah suddenly
came forth. There was then laid on his shoulders the heaviest burden;
for many enemies must have risen to oppose him, when he attempted to
bring back the people to the pure doctrine of the law, which the greater
part were then treading under their feet.

<span id="xi.i-p11"></span>He calls himself the *son of Hilkiah* The
Rabbins think that this Hilkiah was the priest by whom the Book of Moses
was found five years after: but this seems not to me probable. The
conjecture also of *Jerome* is very frivolous, who concludes that the
Prophet was a boy when he began to prophesy, because he calls himself
<span id="xi.i-p11.1"></span>נער (*nor*,) a child, a little farther on,
as though he did not use the word metaphorically.  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) At what age he was called to the prophetic
office, we do not know; it is, however, probable that he was of mature
age, for it was a work of high authority; and further, had he been a
youth, doubtless such a miracle would not have been passed over in
silence, that is, that he was made a prophet before the age of maturity.

<span id="xi.i-p14"></span>With regard to his father, it is nothing
strange that the Rabbins have regarded him as the high priest; for we
know that they are always prone to vain boastings. Ambition possessed
them, and hence they have said that Jeremiah was the son of the high
priest, in order to add to the splendor of his character. But what does
the Prophet himself say? He declares indeed that he was the son of
Hilkiah, but does not say that this was the high priest; on the contrary
he adds, that he was *from the priests who were in Anathoth in the land
of Benjamin* Now we know that this was a mean village, not far from
Jerusalem; and Jeremiah says, that it was in the tribe of Benjamin. Its
nearness to Jerusalem may be gathered from the words of Isaiah, who says
that small Anathoth was terrified. (<span id="xi.i-p14.1"></span>[Isa
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#030)<span id="xi.i-p14.1"></span>.md) He
threatened Jerusalem by saying that the enemy was near.

<span id="xi.i-p15"></span>“What,” he says, “is your security? Ye can
hear the noise of your enemies and the groans of your brethren from your
very gates; for Anathoth is not far from you, being only three miles
distant.”

<span id="xi.i-p16"></span>Since then Jeremiah only says, that he came
from Anathoth, why should we suppose him to be the sort of the high
priest? And frivolous is what the Chaldee paraphraser adds here, that
Hilkiah had possessions in the town of Anathoth, as though it was
allowed the priests to possess land: God allowed them only what was
necessary to feed their flocks. We may then take it as certain, and what
the Prophet indeed expressly declares, that he came from the village of
Anathoth.  <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md)

<span id="xi.i-p18"></span>He further says, that he was of the
*priestly* order. Hence the prophetic office was more suitable to him
than to many of the other prophets, such as Amos and Isaiah. God took
Isaiah from the court, as he was of the royal family, and made him a
prophet. Amos was in a different situation: he was taken from the
shepherds, for he was a shepherd. Since God appointed such prophets over
his Church, he no doubt thus intended to cast a reflection on the
idleness and sloth of the priests. For, though all the priests were not
prophets, yet they ought to have been taken from that order; for the
priestly order was as it were the nursery of the prophets. But when
gross want of knowledge and ignorance prevailed among them, God chose
his prophets from the other tribes, and thus exposed and condemned the
priests. They ought, indeed, to have been the messengers of the God of
hosts, so as to keep the law in their lips, that the people might seek
it from their mouth, according to what is said by Malachi. (<span
id="xi.i-p18.1"></span>[Mal 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md)<span
id="xi.i-p18.1"></span>) But as they were dumb dogs, God transferred the
honor of the prophetic office to others; but Jeremiah, as I have already
stated, was a prophet as well as a priest.

<span id="xi.i-p19"></span><span id="xi.i-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p20"></span>He begins in the second verse to speak of his
calling.  <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) It would have, indeed, been
to little purpose, had he said that he came forth and brought a message;
but he explains, in the second verse, that he brought nothing but what
had been delivered to him by God, as though he had said, that he
faithfully declared what God had commanded him. For we know that the
whole authority belongs entirely to God, with regard to the doctrine of
religion, and that it is not in the power of men to blend this or that,
and to make the faithful subject to themselves. As God, then, is the
only true teacher of the Church, whosoever demands to be heard, must
prove that he is God’s minister. This is, then, what Jeremiah is now
carefully doing, for he says that the *word of Jehovah* was given to
him.

<span id="xi.i-p24"></span>He had before said, *the words of Jeremiah,
the son of Hilkiah;* but any one of the people might have objected and
said, “Why dost thou intrude thyself, as though any one is to be heard?
for God claims this right to himself alone.” Hence Jeremiah, by way of
correction, subjoins, that the words were his, but that he was not the
author of them, but the minister only. He says, then, that he only
executed what God had commanded, for he had been the disciple of God
himself, before he undertook the office of a teacher.

<span id="xi.i-p25"></span><span id="xi.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p26"></span>As to the beginning of his time and its
termination, it has been briefly shewn, why he says that he had been
chosen a prophet *in the thirteenth year of Josiah,* and that he
discharged his office till *the eleventh year of Zedekiah.*

<span id="xi.i-p27"></span>Now that *Josiah is called the son of Amon,*
it is doubtful whether Josiah was properly his son. Amon began to reign
in his twenty-second year, and reigned only two years. Josiah succeeded
him in the eighth year of his age. If we number the years precisely,
Josiah must have been born when Amon was in his sixteenth year; but it
does not appear likely, that Amon was a father when he was sixteen years
of age, for in this case he must have begotten a son in his fifteenth
year; as the birth must have taken place nine months after. Then Josiah
must have been begotten in the fifteenth year of Amon’s age. It is hence
a probable conclusion, that he was a son by law and not by nature,
according to what is afterwards said of Zedekiah, that he was Josiah’s
son, because he was his successor, while he was, as many think, his
nephew, a brother’s son. But it was a common thing to call the
successors of kings their sons, who were their sons by law, and not, as
I have said, by nature. It now follows-

<span id="xi.ii"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
1:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#004.md)<span id="xi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p2"></span>**4**. Then the word of the LORD came unto
me, saying,

<span id="xi.ii-p3"></span>**4**. Et fuit sermo Jehova ad me dicendo,

<span id="xi.ii-p4"></span>**5**. Before I formed thee in the belly I
knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified
thee, *and* I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.

<span id="xi.ii-p5"></span>**5**. Antequam formarem to in utero novi to,
et antequam egressus esses e vulva sanetificavi to, Prophetam in
gentibus constituite.

<span id="xi.ii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xi.ii-p7"></span><span id="xi.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p8"></span>Here Jeremiah explains more fully what he had
already mentioned that he had been called from above, for otherwise he
would have presumptuously obtruded himself: for no one, as the Apostle
says, takes this honor to himself; but the call of God alone raises up
prophets and teachers to their dignity (see <span
id="xi.ii-p8.1"></span>[Heb 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#004.md)<span
id="xi.ii-p8.1"></span>). Hence, that Jeremiah might secure attention,
he declares that he had been called to the prophetic office, and that by
the clear voice of God. For this purpose, he says, that this *word* was
given him, *Before I formed thee in the womb*  <span
id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) *I knew thee* He introduces God as the
speaker, that what he declares might be more emphatical, that it might
be of more weight and more forcible: for, if he had said simply in his
own person, that he had been made a prophet by God’s voice, it would not
have so much moved the hearers; but when he brings forward God as the
speaker, there is necessarily more weight and force in what is said.

<span id="xi.ii-p10"></span>I pass by here what might be more largely
said on what is necessary in one’s call, so that he may be attended to
by God’s people; for no one, by his own and private right, can claim
this privilege of speaking, as I have already said, inasmuch as this is
what belongs to God alone. But I have elsewhere spoken at large on the
prophetic call; it is therefore enough now to point at such things as
these as it were by the finger: and particular discussions must be
sought elsewhere; for were I to dwell at large on every subject, my work
would be endless. I will, therefore, according to my usual practice,
give a brief exposition of this Prophet.

<span id="xi.ii-p11"></span>Jeremiah then says, that he had been *called
by God,* for this end, that he might on this account gain a hearing from
the people. God declares that he *knew* Jeremiah before he *formed* him
*in the womb.* This is not said specially of the Prophet, as though
other men are unknown to God, but it is to be understood of the
prophetic office, as though he had said, “Before I formed thee in the
womb, I destined thee for this work, even that thou mayest undertake the
burden of a teacher among the people.” And the second part is a
repetition, when he says, *Before thou camest forth from the womb I
sanctified thee* Sanctification is the same as the knowledge of God: and
thus we perceive that knowledge is not mere prescience, but that
predestination, by which God chooses every single individual according
to his own will, and at the same time appoints and also sanctifies him;
for no one, as Paul declares, (<span id="xi.ii-p11.1"></span>[2Co
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016)<span id="xi.ii-p11.1"></span>,.md)
is according to his own nature fitted for the work. Since then this
fitness is the gratuitous gift of God, it is nothing strange that God
declares that he had *sanctified* Jeremiah, as though he had said, “I
formed thee man in the womb, and at the same time appointed thee for
this particular work; and as it was not in thy power to bring with thee
a qualification for the prophetic office, I formed thee not only a man,
but a prophet.” This is the import of the passage.

<span id="xi.ii-p12"></span>But they refine too much, who think that the
Prophet was sanctified from the womb as John the Baptist was, for the
words mean no such thing; but only that is testified of Jeremiah, which
Paul also affirms respecting himself in the first chapter of the Epistle
to the Galatians, that he was known by God before he was born. Jeremiah
then was not actually sanctified in the womb, but set apart according to
God’s predestination and hidden purpose; that is, God chose him then to
be a Prophet. It may be asked, whether he was not chosen before the
creation of the world? To this it may be readily answered, that he was
indeed foreknown by God before the world was made; but Scripture
accommodates itself to the measure of our capacities, when it speaks of
the generation of any one: it is then the same as though God had said of
Jeremiah, that he was formed man for this end that in due time he might
come forth a Prophet.

<span id="xi.ii-p13"></span>And no doubt the following clause is added
exegetically, *A prophet for the nations I made thee* His
sanctification, then, as I have said, was not real, but intimated that
he was appointed a Prophet before he was born.

<span id="xi.ii-p14"></span>It however seems strange that he was given a
Prophet *to the nations* God designed him to be the minister of his
Church; for he neither went to the Ninevites, as Jonah did, (<span
id="xi.ii-p14.1"></span>[Jon 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#003.md)<span
id="xi.ii-p14.1"></span>,) nor traveled into other countries, but spent
his labors only among the tribe of Judah; why then is it said that he
was given as a Prophet *to the nations*? To this I answer, that though
God appointed him especially for his Church, yet his teaching belonged
to other nations, as we shall presently see, and very evidently, as we
proceed; for he prophesied concerning the Babylonians, the Egyptians,
and the Moabites; in short, he included all the nations who were nigh
and known to the Jews. This was indeed as it were accidental: but though
he was given as a Prophet especially to his own people, yet his
authority extended to heathen nations. No doubt *nations* are mentioned,
including many, in order that the power and dignity of his teaching
might appear more evident. It follows-

<span id="xi.iii"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p1"></span><span id="xi.iii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
1:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#006.md)<span id="xi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p2"></span>**6**. Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I
cannot speak: for I *am* a child.

<span id="xi.iii-p3"></span>**6**. Et dixi, Ahah, Domine Jehova, ecce
non novi loqui, quia puer ego.

<span id="xi.iii-p4"></span>**7**. But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I
*am* a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and
whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.

<span id="xi.iii-p5"></span>**7**. Et dixit Jehova ad me, Ne dicas, Puer
ego (*id est,* sum puer,) quia ad quaecunque to misero, ibis, et
quaeunque tibi praecepero, loqueris.

<span id="xi.iii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xi.iii-p7"></span><span id="xi.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p8"></span>After having spoken of his call, the Prophet
adds, that he at first refused his office, and he states this for two
reasons; first, that he might clear himself from every suspicion of
rashness, for we know how much ambition prevails among men, according to
what James intimates, that many wish to be teachers, (<span
id="xi.iii-p8.1"></span>[Jas 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001.md)<span
id="xi.iii-p8.1"></span>) and there is hardly one who is not anxious to
be listened to. Since, then, most men too readily assume the office of
teaching, and many boldly intrude into it, Jeremiah, in order to avoid
the very suspicion of rashness, informs us that he was constrained to
take the office. Secondly, he says that he refused the office, that he
might gain more esteem, and render his disciples more attentive. But why
did he refuse to obey God, when called to the prophetic function?
Because its difficulty frightened him: and yet this very reason ought to
rouse readers to a greater attention, as it no doubt awakened hearers
when Jeremiah spoke to them.

<span id="xi.iii-p9"></span>If any one asks, whether Jeremiah acted
rightly in refusing what God enjoined? the answer is, that God pardoned
his servant, for it was not his design to reject his call, or to exempt
himself from obedience, or to shake off the yoke, because he regarded
his own leisure, or his own fame, or any similar considerations:
Jeremiah looked on nothing of this kind; but when he thought of himself,
he felt, that he was wholly unequal to undertake an office so arduous.
Hence the excuse that is added is that of modesty. We then see that God
forgave his timidity, for it proceeded, as we have just said, from a
right feeling; and we know that from good principles vices often arise.
But it was yet a laudable thing in Jeremiah, that he thought himself not
sufficiently qualified to undertake the prophetic office, and that he
wished to be excused, and that another should be chosen endued with more
courage and with better qualifications. I shall proceed with what
remains tomorrow.

<span id="xi.iv"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="xi.iv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast not
only provided for thine ancient Church, by choosing Jeremiah as thy
servant, but hast also designed that the fruit of his labors should
contilme to our age, O grant that we may not be unthankful to thee, but
that we may so avail ourselves of so great a benefit, that the fruit of
it may appear in us to the glory of thy name; may we learn so entirely
to devote ourselves to thy service, and each of us be so attentive to
the work of his calling, that we may strive with united hearts to
promote the honor of thy name, and also the kingdom of thine only —
begotten Son, until we finish our warfare, and come at length into that
celestial rest, which has been obtained for us by the blood of thine
only Son. Amen.

<span id="xi.v"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p1"></span>Lecture Second

<span id="xi.v-p2"></span>We mentioned yesterday the reason why Jeremiah
refused the office of teaching, even because he thought himself unequal
to the work; and for this reason he called himself a child, not in age,
but in knowledge. Hence the word “child” is to be taken metaphorically;
for thereby the Prophet confessed that he was not sufficiently qualified
as to knowledge and practice. Some, as I have said, have unwisely
applied this to his age. Though then he was of a mature age, yet he
called himself a child, because of his unskillfulness, and because he
possessed not the gifts necessary for an office so important.  <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md)

<span id="xi.v-p5"></span><span id="xi.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p6"></span>Now follows the answer given to him, *Say not,
I am a child; for thou shalt go, etc*. God not only predicts here what
the Prophet was to do, but declares also what he designed him to do, and
what he required from him, as though he had said, “It is thy duty to
obey, because I have the right to command: thou must, therefore, go
wheresoever I shall send thee, and thou must also proclaim whatsoever I
shall command thee.” By these words God reminds him that he was his
servant, and that there was no reason why a sense of his own weakness
should make him afraid; for it ought to have been enough for him simply
to obey his command.

<span id="xi.v-p7"></span>And it is especially necessary to know this
doctrine: for as we ought to undertake nothing without considering what
our strength is, so when God enjoins anything, we ought, immediately to
obey his word as it were with closed eyes. Prudence is justly praised by
writers; and it is what ought to be attended to by all generally; they
ought to consider what the shoulders can bear, and cannot bear. For
whence is it that many have so much audacity and boldness, except that
they hurry on through extreme self — confidence? Hence, in all
undertakings, this should be the first thing, that every one should
weigh well his own strength, and take in hand what comports with the
measure of his capacity. Then no one would foolishly obtrude himself,
and arrogate to himself more than what is right. But when God calls us,
we ought to obey, however deficient we may in all things be: and this is
what we learn from what God says here, *Say not, I am a child;* that is,
“though thou, indeed, thinkest thyself destitute of every qualification,
though thou art conscious of thine own weakness, yet thou *shalt go,*
thou must go wheresoever I shall send thee.” God, then, requires this
honor to be simply conceded to him, that men should obey his commands,
though the qualification necessary to execute them be wanting. It
afterwards follows —

<span id="xi.vi"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p1"></span><span id="xi.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#008.md)<span id="xi.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p2"></span>**8**. Be not afraid of their faces: for I
*am* with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.

<span id="xi.vi-p3"></span>**8**. Ne timeas a facie ipsorum, quia tecum
ego (*id est,* ego sum tecum) ad eripiendum to, dicit Jehova.

<span id="xi.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.vi-p5"></span><span id="xi.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p6"></span>We may learn from this verse that Jeremiah,
when he observed the heavy and hard conflicts he had to undertake, was
greatly disturbed; for he had not courage enough firmly and boldly to
assail enemies so many and so violent. He indeed saw, that he had to do
with a degenerated people, who had almost all departed from the law of
God: and since they had for many years shaken off the yoke, and were
petulantly exulting in their freedom, it was difficult to bring them
back to obedience, and to a right course of life. It hence appears that
the Prophet was restrained by this difficulty, so as not to venture to
undertake the prophetic office. But God applied a suitable remedy to his
fear; for what does he say? *Fear not their face* It appears, then, that
when Jeremiah said that he was a child, he had in view, as I have
already hinted, the difficulty of the undertaking; he could hardly bear
to carry on contests so severe with that rebellious people, who had now
become hardened in their wickedness. We hence see how he refused, in an
indirect manner, the burden laid on him, for he ventured, not openly and
ingenuously, and in plain words, to confess how the matter was; but God,
who penetrates into the hearts of men, and knows all their hidden
feelings and motives, heals his timidity by saying, *Fear not their
face.*  <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md)

<span id="xi.vi-p8"></span>Now this passage shews that corruptions had
so prevailed among the chosen people, that no servant of God could
peaceably perform his office. When prophets and teachers have to do with
a teachable people, they have no need to fight: but when there is no
fear of God, and no regard for him, yea, when men are led away by the
violence of their lusts, no godly teacher can exercise his duty without
being prepared for war. This, then, is what God intimates, when he bids
his Prophet to be courageous; for he saw that there would be as many
enemies as professed themselves to be the children of Abraham.

<span id="xi.vi-p9"></span>The reason, also, for boldness and
confidence, that is added, ought to be noticed, *For I am with thee to
deliver thee* By these words God reminds the Prophet, that there would
be sufficient protection in his power, so that he had no need to dread
the fury of his own nation. It was, indeed, at first, a formidable
undertaking, when Jeremiah saw that he had to carry on war, not with a
few men, but with the whole people; but God sets himself in opposition
to all men, and says, *I am with thee*,  <span
id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) fear not. We hence see that due honor is
then conceded to God, when being content with his defense we disregard
the fury of men, and hesitate not to contend with all the ungodly, yea,
though they may rise up in a mass against us: and were their forces and
power the strongest, we ought yet to feel assured that the defense of
God alone is sufficient to protect us. This is the full meaning of the
passage. It now follows-

<span id="xi.vii"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p1"></span><span id="xi.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
1:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#009.md)<span id="xi.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p2"></span>**9**. Then the LORD put forth his hand, and
touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words
in thy mouth.

<span id="xi.vii-p3"></span>**9**. Et extendit Jehova manum suam, et
tetigit os meum; et dixit Jehova ad me, Ecce posui verba mea in ore tuo:

<span id="xi.vii-p4"></span>**10**. See, I have this day set thee over
the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to
destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.

<span id="xi.vii-p5"></span>**10**. Vide, constitui to (*vel,* praefeci)
hodie super gentes et super regna, ad evellendum et ad destruendum et ad
eruendum et ad perdendum, ad aedificandum et ad plantandum.

<span id="xi.vii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xi.vii-p7"></span><span id="xi.vii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p8"></span>Here Jeremiah speaks again of his calling,
that his doctrine might not be despised, as though it proceeded from a
private individual. He, therefore, testifies again, that he came not of
himself, but was sent from above, and was invested with the authority of
a prophet. For this purpose he says, that God’s words were put in his
mouth.

<span id="xi.vii-p9"></span>This passage ought to be carefully observed;
for Jeremiah briefly describes how a true call may be ascertained, when
any one undertakes the office of a teacher in the Church: it is
ascertained even by this when he brings nothing of his own, according to
what Peter says in his first canonical epistle,

<span id="xi.vii-p10"></span>“Let him who speaks, speak as the oracles
of God,”

<span id="xi.vii-p11"></span>that is, let him not speak doubtingly, as
though he introduced his own glosses; but let him boldly, and without
hesitation, speak in the name of God. So also Jeremiah in this place, in
order that he might demand to be heard, plainly declares that the words
of God were put in his mouth. Let us, then, know, that whatever proceeds
from the wit of man, ought to be disregarded; for God wills this honor
to be conceded to him alone, as it was stated yesterday, to be heard in
his own Church. It hence follows, that none ought to be acknowledged as
God’s servants, that no prophets or teachers ought to be counted true
and faithful, except those through whom God speaks, who invent nothing
themselves, who teach not according to their own fancies, but faithfully
deliver what God has committed to them.

<span id="xi.vii-p12"></span>A visible symbol was added, that there
might be a stronger confirmation: but there is no reason to make this a
general rule, as though it were necessary that the tongues of all
teachers should be touched by the hand of God. There are here two things
— the thing itself, and the external sign. As to the thing itself, a
rule is prescribed to all God’s servants, that they bring not their own
inventions, but simply deliver, as from hand to hand, what they have
received from God. But it was a special thing as to Jeremiah, that God,
by stretching out his hand, *touched his mouth;* it was, that he might
openly shew that his mouth was consecrated to himself. It is therefore
sufficient as to the ministers of the word, that their tongues be
consecrated to God, so that they may not mix any of their own fictions
with his pure doctrine. But it was God’s will, as to Jeremiah, to add
also the visible signs of the thing itself, by extending his hand and
touching his mouth.

<span id="xi.vii-p13"></span><span id="xi.vii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p14"></span>God having now shewn that Jeremiah’s mouth
was consecrated to himself, and separated from common and profane use,
proceeds to invest him with power: *See*, he says, *I have set thee this
day over nations and over kingdoms* By these words God shews how
reverently he would have his word received, even when conveyed by frail
mortals. There is no one who pretends not, that he desires to obey God,
but yet hardly one in a hundred really receives his word. For as soon as
he speaks, almost all raise a clamor; or if they dare not furiously, and
in a hostile manner, oppose it, we yet see how some evade it, and others
secretly oppose it. The authority, then, which God ascribes to his own
word, ought to be noticed by us: *Behold, I have set thee over nations
and kingdoms*

<span id="xi.vii-p15"></span>Farther, by saying, *See, I have set thee,*
he encourages the Prophet to be magnanimous in spirit. He was to
remember his calling, and not timidly or servilely to flatter men, or to
shew indulgence to their lusts and passions: *See,* he says. We may
hence perceive, that teachers cannot firmly execute their office except
they have the majesty of God before their eyes, so that in comparison
with him they may disregard whatever splendor, pomp, or power there may
be in men. Experience indeed teaches us, that the sight of men, whatever
dignity they may possess, be it the least, brings fear with it. Why are
prophets and teachers sent? That they may reduce the world to order:
they are not to spare their hearers, but freely reprove them whenever
there may be need; they are also to use threatenings when they find men
perverse. But when there is any dignity connected with men, the teacher
dares not to offend; he is afraid of those who are invested with power,
or who possess wealth, or a high character for prudence, or who are
endued with great honors. In such cases there is no remedy, except
teachers set God before their eyes, and regard him to be himself the
speaker. They may thus with courageous and elevated minds look down on
whatever height and pre — eminence there may be among mortals. This,
then, is the object of what God says here, *See, I have set thee over
nations and kingdoms;* for he shews that there is so much authority in
his word, that whatever is high and exalted on earth is made subject to
it; even kings are not excepted.

<span id="xi.vii-p16"></span>But what God has joined together let no man
separate. (<span id="xi.vii-p16.1"></span>[Mt
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006.md)<span id="xi.vii-p16.1"></span>;
<span id="xi.vii-p16.2"></span>[Mr
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#009)<span id="xi.vii-p16.2"></span>.md)
God indeed extols here his Prophets above the whole world, and even
above kings; but he has previously said, *Behold, I have put my words,
in thy mouth;* so that whosoever claims such a power, must necessarily
bring forth the word of God, and really prove that he is a prophet, and
that he introduces no fictions of his own. And hence we see how
fatuitous is the boasting of the Pope, and of his filthy clergy, when
they wickedly dare to appropriate to themselves what is here said. “We
*are, “*they say, “above both kings and nations.” By what right? “God
hath thus spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah.” But these two things are to
be joined together — *I have put my words in thy mouth,* and, *I have
set thee over nations and kingdoms* Now let the Pope shew that he is
furnished with the word of God, that he claims for himself nothing that
is his own, of apart from God; in a word, that he introduces nothing of
his own devices, and we shall willingly allow that he is pre — eminent
above the whole world. For God is not to be separated from his word: as
his majesty shines eminently above the whole world, yea, and above all
the angels of heaven; so there is the same dignity belonging to his
word. But as these swine and dogs are empty of all true doctrine and
piety, what effrontery it is, yea, what stupidity, to boast that they
have authority over kings and nations! We, in short, see from the
context, that men are not here so much extolled, though they be true
ministers of celestial truth, as the truth itself; for God ascribes here
the highest authority to his own word, though its ministers were men of
no repute, poor and despised, and having nothing splendid connected with
them. The purpose for which this was said I have already explained; it
was, that true prophets and teachers may take courage, and thus boldly
set themselves against kings and nations, when armed with the power of
celestial truth.

<span id="xi.vii-p17"></span>He then adds, *To root up, to destroy, to
pull down, to lay waste* God seems here to have designedly rendered
odious his own word and the ministry of the Prophet; for the word of God
in the mouth of Jeremiah could not have been acceptable to the Jews,
except they perceived that it was for their safety and welfare: but God
speaks here of ruin and destruction, of cutting down and desolation. But
he subjoins, *to build and to plant* God then ascribes two effects to
his word, that on the one hand it *destroys, pulls down, lays waste,
cuts off;* and that on the other it *plants and builds*

<span id="xi.vii-p18"></span>But it may, however, be rightly asked, why
does God at first speak of ruin and extermination? The order would have
seemed better had he said first, I set thee to *build* and to *plant,*
according to what is said by Paul, who declares that vengeance was
prepared by him and the other teachers against all despisers, and
against all the height of the world, when your obedience, he says, shall
be completed. (<span id="xi.vii-p18.1"></span>[2 Cor.
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#006)<span id="xi.vii-p18.1"></span>..md)
Paul then intimates that the doctrine of the gospel is properly, and in
the first place, designed for this end — to call men to the service of
God. But Jeremiah here puts rhin and destruction before building and
planting. It then seems, as I have said, that he acts inconsistently.
But we must ever bear in mind what the state of the people was: for
impiety, perverseness, and hardened iniquity had for so long a time
prevailed, that it was necessary to begin with ruin and eradication; for
Jeremiah could not have planted or have built the temple of God, except
he had first destroyed, pulled down, laid waste, and cut off. How so?
Because the Devil had erected there his palace; for as true religion had
been for many years despised, the Devil was there placed, as it were, on
his high throne, and reigned uncontrolled at Jerusalem, and through the
whole land of Judea. How, then, could he have built there a temple for
God, in which he might be purely worshipped, except ruin and destruction
had preceded? for the Devil had corrupted the whole land. We indeed know
that all kinds of wickedness then prevailed everywhere, as though the
land had been filled with thorns and briers. Jeremiah then could not
have planted or sown his heavenly doctrine until the land had been
cleansed from so many vices and pollutions. This is no doubt the reason
why in the first place he speaks of cutting off and ruin, of
exterminating and eradicating, and afterwards adds planting and
building.

<span id="xi.vii-p19"></span>The heap of words employed shews how deep
impiety and the contempt of God had fixed their roots. God might have
said only, I have set thee to pull down and to destroy; he might have
been content with two words, as in the latter instance — to plant and to
build. But as the Jews had been obstinate in their wickedness, as their
insolence had been so great, they could not be corrected immediately,
nor in one day, nor by a slight effort. Hence God accumulated words, and
thus encouraged his Prophet to proceed with unwearied zeal in the work
of clearing away the filth which had polluted the whole land. We now
then understand what is here said, and the purpose of using so many
words.  <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md)

}

<span id="xi.vii-p23"></span>But he speaks again of kingdoms and
nations; for though Jeremiah was given as a Prophet especially to his
own nation, yet he was also a Prophet to heathen nations, as they say,
by accident, according to what we shall hereafter see: and it seems
that, God designedly mentioned nations and kingdoms, in order to humble
the pride of that people who thought themselves exempt from all reproof.
Hence he says, that he gave authority to his servant, not only over
Judea, but also over the whole world; as though he had said, “Ye are but
a small portion of mankind; raise not then your horns against my
servant, as ye shall do this without effect; for he shall exercise power
not only over Judea, but also over all nations, and even over kings, as
the doctrine which I have deposited with him is of such force and power
that it will stand eminent above all mortals, much more above one single
nation.”

<span id="xi.vii-p24"></span>We at the same time see that though the
treachery of men constrains God to use severity, yet he never forgets
his own nature, and kindly invites to repentance those who are not
wholly past remedy, and offers to them the hope of pardon and of
salvation; and this is what celestial truth ever includes. For though it
be the odour of death unto death to those who perish, it is yet the odor
of life unto life to the elect of God. It indeed often happens that the
greater part turn the doctrine of salvation to their ruin; yet God never
suffers all to perish. He therefore makes the truth the incorruptible
seed of life to his elect, and builds them up as his temples. This is
what we must bear in mind. And so there is no reason why the truth of
God should be disliked by us, though it be the occasion of perdition to
many; for it always brings salvation to the elect: it so plants them,
that they strike roots into the hope of a blessed immortality, and then
it builds them for holy temples unto God. It now follows —

<span id="xi.viii"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p1"></span><span id="xi.viii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
1:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#011.md)<span id="xi.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p2"></span>**11**. Moreover, the word of the LORD came
unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of
an almond tree.

<span id="xi.viii-p3"></span>**11**. Et (*hoc est,* postea) factus est
sermo Jehovae ad me (*datus est mihi,* fuit, *ad verbum*,) dicendo, Quid
tu vides, Jeremia? Et dixi, Baculum vigilis (*aut,* amigdali) ego video.

<span id="xi.viii-p4"></span>**12**. Then said the LORD unto me, Thou
hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.

<span id="xi.viii-p5"></span>**12**. Et dixit Jehova ad me, Bene fecisti
ad videndam (*hoc est,* recte vidisti,) quia vigilo (*aut,* festino,
vigilans ego, *ad verbum*) super sermonem meum ut ipsum faciam (*hoc
est,* ut compleam.)

<span id="xi.viii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xi.viii-p7"></span><span id="xi.viii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p8"></span>God confirms in this passage what he had
previously said of the power of his word. These two verses, then, are to
be taken as explanatory, for no new subject is introduced; but the
former part is confirmed — that the Prophets spoke not in vain, or to no
purpose, because they were invested with celestial power to plant and to
build, and, on the other hand, to pull down and to root up, according to
what we have quoted from Paul, who says that true teachers are armed
with such power. (<span id="xi.viii-p8.1"></span>[2 Cor.
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#006)<span id="xi.viii-p8.1"></span>.md) We
have in readiness, he says, vengeance against all the unbelieving,
however proud they may be: and though their height may terrify the whole
world, yet we have a sword in our hands which will stay them; for God’s
word has sufficient power to destroy the rebellious.

<span id="xi.viii-p9"></span>God then proceeds with the same subject
when he says, *What seest thou, Jeremiah?* He had set before him a staff
or a rod of almond, as some render the word: and <span
id="xi.viii-p9.1"></span>שקר, *shaked,* means an almond; but as it comes
from a verb which means to watch or to hasten, we cannot fitly render it
here, almond. I do not, however, deny that the Hebrew word has this
meaning. But it is written here with *Kamets;* the participle which
afterwards follows has *Holem:* we hence see what affinity there is
between the two words. The word <span id="xi.viii-p9.2"></span>שקר*,
shaked,* an almond, is derived from the verb, <span
id="xi.viii-p9.3"></span>שקר, *shakad,* to watch; and it has been
thought that this tree is so called, because it brings forth fruit
earlier than other trees; for almonds, as it is well known, flower even
in winter, and in the coldest seasons. Now, were we to say in Latin, I
see a rod or a staff of almond; and were the answer given, Thou hast
rightly seen, for I watch, the allusion in the words would not appear,
the sentence would lose its beauty, and there would indeed be no
meaning. It is hence necessary to give another version, except we wish
to pervert the passage, and to involve the Prophet’s meaning in
darkness. It should be, “I see the rod, “or the staff, “of a watcher.”
Let us grant that the almond is intended; yet the tree may be called
watchful, according to what etymology requires, and also the sense of
the passage, as all must see.  <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md)

<span id="xi.viii-p14"></span><span id="xi.viii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p15"></span>God then caused his servant to see the
staff of a watcher. For what purpose? The answer is given: *Thou hast
rightly seen the staff of a watcher, because I watch over my word to
execute* (or, fulfill) *it* Interpreters seem to have unwisely confined
this to the punishments afterwards mentioned: they think that what is
intimated is, that the threatenings which the Prophet announced would
not be without effect, because God was prepared to inflict whatever he
would denounce. But this, as I think, is too restricted a view; for God,
I have no doubt, extols here his own word, and speaks of its
accomplishment; as though he had said, that he spoke not by his
servants, that what they said might vanish into air, or fall to the
ground, but that power would accompany it, according to what is said in
Isaiah,

<span id="xi.viii-p16"></span>“Not return shall my word to me empty, but
shall prosper in all things,” (<span id="xi.viii-p16.1"></span>[Isa
55:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#011)<span id="xi.viii-p16.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xi.viii-p17"></span>that is, “I will cause the prophetic
doctrine to take effect, that the whole world may know that I have not
spoken in vain, and that my word is not an empty sound, but that it has
real power, which in due time will appear.”

<span id="xi.viii-p18"></span>Hence I have said that these verses ought
to be connected with the last, in which God said, that he sent his
Prophet to root up and to plant, to demolish and to build. He then gives
a proof of this in other words, and says that he would *watch over his
word,* that he might execute whatever he had announced by his servants;
as though he had said, “I indeed allot their parts (so to speak) to the
prophets; but as they speak from my mouth, I am present with them to
fulfill whatever I command them.” In short, God intimates that the might
and the power of his hand would be connected with the word, of which the
prophets were ministers among men. Thus it is a general declaration
which refers not only to punishments, but also to promises. *Rightly,*
then, *hast thou seen,* he says; *for I am watching.*

<span id="xi.viii-p19"></span>God does not here resign his own office to
Jeremiah, though he employs him as his teacher; for he shews that the
power to accomplish what the Prophet would declare remained with him.
God indeed does not here ascribe to Jeremiah anything as his own, or
apart from himself, but sets forth only the power of his word; as though
he had said, “Provided thou be my faithful minister, I will not
frustrate thy hope, nor the hope of those who shall obey thee; for I
will fulfill whatever thou and they may justly hope for: nor shall they
escape unpunished who shall resist thee; for I will in due time bring on
them the punishment they deserve.”

<span id="xi.viii-p20"></span>He therefore uses the word to *watch,* or
to hasten, in order to shew that he stood ready to give effect to his
word at the appointed time. The effect does not indeed always appear to
us: it is on this account said by Habakkuk, that if prophecy delays, we
are to wait;

<span id="xi.viii-p21"></span>“for it will not be,” he says,  
“beyond its time; but coming it will come.” (<span
id="xi.viii-p21.2"></span>[Habakkuk.
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003)<span id="xi.viii-p21.2"></span>.md)

<span id="xi.viii-p22"></span>God then bids us with quiet minds to wait
for the accomplishment of his word; but he afterwards adds, in order to
modify what he had said, “coming it will come;” that is, “I will
accomplish and really perform whatever my prophets have spoken by my
command.” So there shall be no delay, for the suitable time depends on
God’s will, and not on the judgment of men. It then follows, — but as
the clock strikes, I cannot proceed farther today.

<span id="xi.ix"></span>

<span id="xi.ix-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xi.ix-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou art
pleased kindly to invite us to thyself, and hast consecrated thy word
for our salvation, — O grant that we may willingly, and from the heart,
obey thee, and become so teachable, that what thou hast designed for our
salvation may not turn to our perdition; but may that incorruptible seed
by which thou dost regenerate us into a hope of the celestial life so
drive its roots into our hearts, and bring forth fruit, that thy name
may be glorified; and may we be so planted in the courts of thine house,
that we may grow and flourish, and that fruit may appear through the
whole course of our life, until we shall at length enjoy that blessed
life which is laid up for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xi.ix-p3"></span> 

<span id="xi.x"></span>

<span id="xi.x-p1"></span>Lecture Third

<span id="xi.xi"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p1"></span><span id="xi.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
1:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#013.md)<span id="xi.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p2"></span>**13**. And the word of the LORD came unto me
the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething
pot; and the face thereof *is* toward the north.

<span id="xi.xi-p3"></span>**13**. Et fuit sermo Jehovae ad me secundo,
dicendo, Quid tu rides? Et dixi, Ollam ferventem ego video, facies ejus

<span id="xi.xi-p4"></span>**14**. Then the LORD said unto me, Out of
the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the
land.

<span id="xi.xi-p5"></span>**14**. Et dixit Jehova ad me, Ab Aquilone
aperietur (*alii vertunt,* pendetur; *alii,* solvetur; erumpet,
*proprie*) malum super cunctos habitatores terrae.

<span id="xi.xi-p6"></span> 

<span id="xi.xi-p7"></span><span id="xi.xi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p8"></span>Jeremiah begins now to address the people to
whom he was sent as a Prophet. He has hitherto spoken of his calling,
that the authority of his doctrine might be evident: and he spoke
generally; but now he accommodates his teaching specially to the people.
Hence he says, that he had a vision, and saw a *boiling-pot,* whose face
*was towards the north.* By God asking, and the Prophet answering, the
design was to confirm the prediction; for if it had been only said that
he saw a boiling-pot, and if an explanation of the metaphor had been
given, there would not have been so much force and weight in the
narrative. But when God is set forth as being present, and explaining
what the boiling-pot signified, the prediction becomes more certain: and
the Prophet no doubt gave this narrative, in order to shew that God,
being as it were present, thereby proved himself to he the Author of
this prophecy.

<span id="xi.xi-p9"></span>Now the import of the whole is, that the
Chaldeans would come to overthrow the city Jerusalem, to take away and
abolish all the honor and dignity both of the kingdom and of the
priesthood.

<span id="xi.xi-p10"></span>This indeed had been previously announced by
Isaiah as well as by other prophets; but all their threatenings had been
despised. While indeed Isaiah was living, the king of Babylon had
secured the friendship of Hezekiah; and the Jews thought that his
protection had been opportunely obtained against the Assyrians. But they
did not consider that the hearts of men are ruled by the hand of God,
and are turned as he pleases: nor did they consider that they had for
many years provoked God, and that he was become their enemy. Since,
then, all threatening had been despised and regarded with derision,
Jeremiah came forth and declared, that the northern nations would come,
the Assyrians as well as the Chaldeans. For we know that the one
monarchy had been swallowed up by the other; and the Chaldeans ruled
over the Assyrians; and thus it happened that the whole eastern empire,
with the exception of the Medes and Persians, had passed over to them;
and with respect to Judea, they were northward. Hence the Prophet says,
that he saw a *boiling-pot,* having its face towards the north.

<span id="xi.xi-p11"></span>By *the pot* many understand the king of
Babylon; but they seem not rightly to understand what the Prophet says:
and I could easily disprove their interpretation, but I shall be
satisfied with a simple statement of what is true; and the meaning will
become evident as we proceed. The pot, then, as it will be presently
seen more clearly, is the nation of the Jews: I say this now, as I do
not wish to heap together too many things. They are said to be like a
boiling-pot, because the Lord, as it were, boiled them, until they were
reduced almost to nothing. It is said also, that the face of the pot was
towards the north; because there, as Jeremiah immediately explains, was
the fire kindled. And the comparison is very apposite; for when a pot is
set on the fire, it boils on that side nearest the fire, and all the
scum passes over to the other side. Hence he says that it boiled, but so
that its mouth was on the north side; for there was the fire, and there
was the blowing. In short, God intended to shew to his Prophet, that the
people were like flesh which is cast into the pot, boiled, and
afterwards burnt, or reduced after a long time almost to nothing. The
Prophet saw the mouth or the face of the boiling-pot, and on the side on
which it boiled it looked towards the north; hence God, the interpreter
of the vision which he presented to his servant, answers and says, *From
the north shall break forth evil on all the inhabitants of the land,*
that is, of Judea. In these words God declares, that the fire was
already kindled by the Chaldeans and the Assyrians, by which he would
boil, as it were, his people like flesh, and at length wholly consume
them, as it is commonly the case, when the flesh remains in the pot, and
the fire is continually burning, and blowing is also added; the flesh
must necessarily be reduced to nothing when thus boiled or seethed.
 <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md)

<span id="xi.xi-p15"></span><span id="xi.xi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p16"></span>And thus God testifies that the fire was
already kindled in Chaldea and Assyria, which was not only to boil the
Jews, but also reduce them to nothing. And then he expresses the same in
other words — that *evil would come from the north* upon all the Jews.
We shall hereafter see that there is presented here a brief summary of
the truth which was committed to Jeremiah; at least it is a summary of
one half of it; for God designed also to provide for his own elect; and
he thus terrified them, that they might be subdued, and submit to him,
and not that they might abandon themselves to despair. At the same time,
this half of the prediction was — that there was no hope of pardon,
because the Jews had with extreme obstinacy provoked God’s wrath, and
had so abused his patience, that their impiety could no longer be
tolerated. Hence, what other prophets had denounced Jeremiah now
confirms more strongly, and points it out, as it were, by the finger. It
afterwards follows —

<span id="xi.xii"></span>

<span id="xi.xii-p1"></span><span id="xi.xii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#015.md)<span id="xi.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xii-p2"></span>**15**. For, lo, I will call all the
families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall
come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the
gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and
against all the cities of Judah.

<span id="xi.xii-p3"></span>**15**. Quoniam ecce ego voco omnes familias
regnorum Aquilonis, dicit Jehova, et venient; ponent quisque solium suum
in ostio postarum Jerosolymae, et super omnes muros ejus in circuitu, et
super omnes urbes Jehudah.

<span id="xi.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.xii-p5"></span><span id="xi.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xii-p6"></span>This verse contains an explanation of the
last; for God more dearly and more specifically expresses what he had
before referred to — that the evil would come from the north. He says
that he would be the sender of this evil, and speaks thus of it:
*Behold, I call all the families of the kingdoms of the north* The
prediction would not have been so effectual had not this declaration
been expressly added — that the Chaldeans would come by the authority of
God; for men are ever wont to ascribe to fortune whatever takes place:
and we shall hereafter see in the Book of Lamentations (<span
id="xi.xii-p6.1"></span>[Lam. 3:37](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#037.md),
[38](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#038)<span id="xi.xii-p6.1"></span>.md)
that the Jews were so besotted, that in their calamities they attributed
to the events of fortune the destruction of the temple and city, and the
ruin of the kingdom. Hence God sharply expostulated with them, because
they were so blind in a matter so clear, and did not acknowledge his
judgments. The Prophet, then, after having testified that the evil would
come from the north, now adds, that this evil would by no means be by
chance, but through that war which the Chaldeans would bring on them;
that God would be the chief commander, who would gather soldiers from
all parts, and prepare an army to destroy the Jews.

<span id="xi.xii-p7"></span>The Prophet uses the word, to cry: *Behold,*
he says, *I will cry* to all the kindreds, or families, etc.  <span
id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md) God employs various modes of speaking,
when he intends to teach us that all nations are in his hand, and
subject to his will, so that he can excite wars whenever it pleases him.
He says, “Behold, I will hiss (or whistle) for the Egyptians;” and he
compares them sometimes to bees. (<span id="xi.xii-p8.4"></span>[Isa
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#026.md)<span id="xi.xii-p8.4"></span>;
<span id="xi.xii-p8.5"></span>[Isa
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#018)<span id="xi.xii-p8.5"></span>..md)
Again, in another place he says, “Behold, I will blow with the trumpet,
and assemble shall the Assyrians.” All these modes of speaking are
intended to shew, that though men make a great stir, and disturb the
whole world, yet God directs all things by his sovereign power, and that
nothing takes place except under his guidance and authority. We then see
that the Prophet does not speak as an historian; nor does he simply
predict what was to be, but also adds a doctrine or a great truth. It
would have been a naked prediction only, had he said, “An evil shall
break forth from the north: “but he now, as I have already said,
performs the office of a teacher, that his prediction might be useful,
and says that God would be the chief commander in that war: *Behold,*
then, *I will cry to all the families*  <span
id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) *of the kingdoms of the north.*

<span id="xi.xii-p10"></span>There was then indeed but one monarchy; but
as the self — confidence of the Jews was so great, and hence their
sottishness, so that they dreaded no evil, God, in order to arouse them,
says that he would assemble all the families of the kingdoms: and
doubtless those belonged to many kingdoms whom God brought together
against the Jews. A regard also was had to that vain confidence which
the Jews entertained, in thinking that the Egyptians would be ever ready
to supply them with help. As, then, they were wont to set up the
Egyptians as their shield, or even as a mountain, God here exposes their
folly, — that trusting in the Egyptians, they thought themselves
sufficiently fortified against the power and arms of the whole Chaldean
monarchy. For these reasons, then, he mentions the *families,* and then
the *kingdoms,* of the north.

<span id="xi.xii-p11"></span>It follows, *And they shall come,* and *set
each* (man, literally) *his throne*  <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) *at the entrance of the gates* The
Prophet here means that the power of the Chaldeans would be such, that
they would boldly pitch their tents before the gates, and not only so,
but would also close up the smaller gates, for he mentions *the doors*
(*ostia*) *of the gates*  <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) And by
speaking of each of them, he meant the more sharply to touch the Jews:
for they, relying on the help of Egypt, thought themselves capable of
resisting, while yet the Chaldeans, who had conquered the Assyrians,
would be irresistible. Hence he says, that not only the army itself
would encamp before the gates, but that each individual would fix
himself there, and set up his tent as in a place of safety. In short,
God intimates that the Chaldeans and Assyrians would be victorious, that
they would entirely rule and rest themselves as at their own homes, in
the fields and before the gates of the city Jerusalem. These things are
afterwards more distinctly expressed, and many circumstances are added:
but God intended at first to announce this declaration, that the Jews
might know that it would be all over with them.

<span id="xi.xii-p16"></span>He then says, *On its walls around, and on
all the cities of Judah* The Prophet here declares, that the whole
country would be laid waste, as though he had said, “The Jews in vain
trust to their own resources, and help from others, for God will fight
against them; and as the Chaldeans and the Assyrians shall be armed by
him, they shall be victorious, whatever force the Jews may oppose to
them.” It follows —

<span id="xi.xiii"></span>

<span id="xi.xiii-p1"></span><span id="xi.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016.md)<span id="xi.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xiii-p2"></span>**16**. And I will utter my judgments
against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and
have burnt incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their
own hands.

<span id="xi.xiii-p3"></span>**16**. Et loquar (*vel,* proferam) judicia
mea cum ipsis super omni malitia eorum; quia (*nam* <span
id="xi.xiii-p3.1"></span>אשר h*ic ponitur vice* <span
id="xi.xiii-p3.2"></span>כי *valet causalem particulam,* quia)
dereliquerunt me, et suffitum fecerunt diis alienis et prostrati fuerunt
(*vel,* se prostraverunt) coram operibus manuum suarum.

<span id="xi.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.xiii-p5"></span><span id="xi.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xiii-p6"></span>God now assigns the reason why he had
resolved to deal so severely with the Jews. It was necessary to teach
them two things, — first, that the Chaldeans would not of themselves
come upon them, but through God, who would gather and arm them; and
secondly, that God Would not act in a cruel manner, nor forget his
covenant, in becoming a rigid avenger, but that he would thus be angry,
because there was extreme iniquity in the Jews, so that it was needful
to distress and wholly to break them down, as moderate corrections had
availed nothing. God, then, after having testified that he would be the
leader in that war, now explains the reasons why he would chastise the
Jews, and shews that his conduct towards them could not be ascribed to
cruelty, inasmuch as that they had provoked him by their impious
superstitions.

<span id="xi.xiii-p7"></span>Hence he says, *I will speak my judgments
with them* This is referred by many interpreters to the Chaldeans and
Assyrians, as though God would prescribe to them what was to be decreed,
as chief judges are wont to do to those who are under them: but this
exposition is strained, and confuted by what follows, *on account of
their wickedness* What, then, is to speak judgments? It is done, when
God summons the wicked before his tribunal, and executes the office of a
judge. And this mode of speaking is common in Scripture, according to
what we read at the end of this book, — The king of Babylon *spoke
judgments with* the King Zedekiah, (<span id="xi.xiii-p7.1"></span>[Jer
52:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#009)<span id="xi.xiii-p7.1"></span>.md)
that is, he dealt judicially with him, as we commonly say.  <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) So now God declares that he would be the
judge of the people, as though he had said, that hitherto he had been
silent, not that the sins of the people were not known, but because he
had borne with them, in order to try whether there was any hope of
repentance. But he says now that he would become their judge, as he had
found by long experience that they were past remedy.

<span id="xi.xiii-p12"></span>There is, then, to be understood a
contrast between the forbearance of God, which he had long exercised
while he dealt with the people, not as he might have justly done, but
deferred his vengeance, and the time of vengeance which was now at hand;
*I will* then *speak my judgments* with the Jews; that is, “I will now
ascend my tribunal: I have hitherto abstained from exercising my right,
and waited for them to return to me; but as there is no return, and I
see that they are men wholly irreclaimable, and their disposition is so
depraved that they continually add evils to evils, I will now begin to
undertake mine office, the office of a judge.” But we must bear in mind,
as I have already said, the design of God in this declaration; for it
was his object to clear himself from every charge, and from all
calumnies, inasmuch as even the worst of men usually clamor against his
judgments when he chastises them. Hence he presented before them his own
judgments, as though he had said, “They shall not be able to blame me
for dealing with them in a severe and cruel manner; for however severe I
may be, I shall yet be an equitable judge.” Hence he adds, *on account
of all their wickedness*

<span id="xi.xiii-p13"></span>He afterwards shews what kind of
wickedness it was, *They have forsaken me*, and *burnt incense to
strange gods* The Jews had, indeed, in various ways, provoked his
vengeance; but he mentions here one kind of wickedness, because it was
the very fountain of evils, — they had departed from the law and the
pure worship of God; and yet he mentions generally *all wickedness* The
word *all* is not here without meaning, “on *account* of *all* their
wickedness:” for he intimates that they were not only in one way wicked,
but that they had heaped together various sins. And then he adds, for
*they have forsaken me* Here God introduces their defection; for it may
be, as we daily see, that one offends in this thing, and another in
that, and each one for different causes may expose himself to God’s
judgment; but God shews here that the Jews were become so depraved, that
there was nothing sound or pure in them: hence he charges them with *all
wickedness;* and then he mentions their defection, *they have forsaken
me;* as though he had said, “They have wholly denied me; I say not that
one is a thief, another an adulterer, and another a drunkard; but they
are all become apostates, they are all perjurers and violators of the
covenant: thus I am wholly forsaken by them, and they are in every
respect alienated from me.” We hence see how greatly the Prophet
enhances the guilt of his own nation.

<span id="xi.xiii-p14"></span>It is afterwards added, for the sake of
illustration, that they *burnt incense to strange gods* They had fallen
away from God, and joined themselves to idolatry. He also adds this, —
that they *bowed down before the works of their own hands* The Prophet
divests the Jews of every excuse, and more fully discovers their shame
and baseness, — “they prostrated themselves before the works of their
own hands.” Whenever Scripture uses these expressions, it intimates that
there is extreme madness in those men, who worship in the place of God
not only the sun and moon, and other created things, but also the idols
which they form for themselves. For how is it that they worship their
own idols, except that they have formed for them a nose, and hands, and
ears? A log of wood no one worships; a piece of brass or of silver all
disregard; no one thinks a stone to be God: but when a thing is
sculptured and artificially formed by the hand of man, miserable and
blind idolaters immediately prostrate themselves; — how is this? Because
they have formed for their statues and pictures noses, eyes, and ears!
hence they themselves have made gods. We now see the meaning of the
Prophet, when he says, that the Jews *bowed down before the works of
their own hands* But I pass over such things as these lightly, as ye
must be well informed on the subject generally. It now follows —

<span id="xi.xiv"></span>

<span id="xi.xiv-p1"></span><span id="xi.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#017.md)<span id="xi.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xiv-p2"></span>**17**. Thou therefore gird up thy loins,
and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed
at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.

<span id="xi.xiv-p3"></span>**17**. Et tu accinge lumbos tuos et surge,
et loquere ad ipsos quaecunque (*vel,* omnia quae) ego mandavero tibi;
ne timeas a facie ipsorum, ne to conteram (*vel,* timere faciam) a facie
ipsorum (*est enim verbum sumptum ex eadem radice*.)

<span id="xi.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.xiv-p5"></span><span id="xi.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xiv-p6"></span>God first bids his Prophet to be the herald
of the dreadful judgment, which we have already noticed: for it was not
his purpose to speak only as it were in a corner, or secretly, to
Jeremiah, but he committed to him what he intended should be proclaimed
audibly to the whole people. It hence follows, *And thou,* etc. We
therefore see that the Prophet had been taught by the Lord, that he
might confidently and boldly declare what we shall hereafter see. These
things should then be connected, — that God would ascend his tribunal to
execute the vengeance he had deferred, — and also that Jeremiah would be
the herald of that vengeance he was prepared to inflict. *Thou then,* —
an illative is to be added here, for the copulative is to be thus taken
in this place, — *Thou then;* that is, as thou hast heard that I shall
be now the avenger of the people’s sins, and that the time of vengeance
is at hand; and also as thou knowest that this has been told thee, that
thou mightest warn them to render them more inexcusable, — *Thou* then,
 <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) *gird thy loins* We see why God
addressed his servant Jeremiah privately; it was, that he might publicly
exercise his office as a teacher.

<span id="xi.xiv-p10"></span>And hence we learn, that all who are called
to rule the Church of God cannot be exempt from blame, unless they
honestly and boldly proclaim what has been committed to them. Hence Paul
says that he was free from the blood of all men, because he had from
house to house and publicly declared whatever he had received from the
Lord, (<span id="xi.xiv-p10.1"></span>[Acts
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#026.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#027)<span id="xi.xiv-p10.1"></span>;.md)
and he says in another place,

<span id="xi.xiv-p11"></span>“Woe is to me if I preach not the Gospel,  
for it has been committed to me.” (<span id="xi.xiv-p11.2"></span>[1Co
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016)<span id="xi.xiv-p11.2"></span>.md)

<span id="xi.xiv-p12"></span>God bids the Prophet to *gird his loins*
This is to be understood of the kind of dress which the Orientals used
and continue to use, for they wear long garments; and when they
undertake any work, or when they proceed on a journey, they gird
themselves. Hence he says, *gird thy loins,* that is, undertake this
expetition which I devolve on thee. At the same time he requires
activity, so that the work might be expeditiously undertaken. *Arise,*
he says, *and speak to them whatsoever I shall command thee* In short,
God intimates in these words, that he was unwilling to proceed to
extremes, until he had still tried whether there was any hope of
repentance as to the people. He indeed knew that they were wholly
irreclaimable; but he intended to discover more fully their perverseness
in bidding Jeremiah, in the last place, to pronounce the extreme
sentence of condemnation.

<span id="xi.xiv-p13"></span>He now again repeats what he had before
said, *Fear not their face* And this exhortation was very needful, as
Jeremiah undertook an office in no small degree disliked; for it was the
same as though he was an herald, to proclaim war in the name of God. As,
then, Jeremiah had distinctly to declare that it was all over with the
people, because their perverseness had been so great that God would no
longer be entreated, it was a very hard message, not likely to be
attended to, especially when we consider what great pride the Jews had.
They gloried in their holy descent, and also thought, as we shall
hereafter see, that the Temple was an impregnable fortress even against
God himself. Since, then, their temper was so refractory, it was needful
that the Prophet should be more than once confirmed by God, so that he
might boldly undertake his office. The exhortation is, therefore,
repeated, *Fear not before them.*

<span id="xi.xiv-p14"></span>He afterwards adds, *lest I make thee to
fear* But the word <span id="xi.xiv-p14.1"></span>חת, *chet,* means
sometimes to fear, and sometimes to break in pieces. Jerome perverts the
meaning of the Prophet, by rendering the phrase, “I shall never make
thee to fear.” It is indeed a godly truth, that God would give courage
to his Prophet so as to render him invincible against his enemies; and
doubtless he would exhort us in vain, were he not to supply us with
fortitude by his Spirit. This is, indeed, true; but the word <span
id="xi.xiv-p14.2"></span>פן, *p*e*n*, will not allow us thus to explain
the passage. What then does God mean? We must either render the verb to
break or to fear. The verb <span id="xi.xiv-p14.3"></span>אחתך
*ach*e*t*a*k,* is transitive; and either meaning would be suitable. For
God, after having bidden the Prophet to be of a courageous and
invincible mind, now adds,

<span id="xi.xiv-p15"></span>“Take heed to thyself; for if thou be
timid, I will cause thee really to fear, or, I will break thee down
before them.”

<span id="xi.xiv-p16"></span>He then intimates, in these words, that the
Prophet ought to be sufficiently fortified, as he knew that he was sent
by God, and thus acted as it were under the authority of the highest
power, and that he should not fear any mortal man.  <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) There is also to be understood here a
threatening, “See, if thou conductest thyself courageously I shall be
present with thee, and however formidable at the first view thy
opponents may be, they shall not yet prevail; but if thou be timid and
faint — hearted,  <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) I will render
thee an object of contempt: thou shalt not only be timid in heart; but I
will make thee to be despised by all, so that thou shalt be
contemptuously treated; for in that case thou wilt not be worthy that I
should fight for thee and supply thee with any courage and power to put
thine enemies to flight.”

<span id="xi.xiv-p24"></span>We hence see what this means, *Fear not,
lest I should make thee to fear;* that is, “Be of a good courage and of
a ready mind, lest thou be justly exposed to shame; and fear them not,
lest thou shouldest really fear them, and lest they should even tear
thee to pieces and tread thee under their feet: for in case thou fearest
them, thou wilt be unworthy of being supported by the strength of my
Spirit.”

<span id="xi.xiv-p25"></span>This passage contains a useful doctrine,
from which we learn that strength shall never be wanting to God’s
servants, while they derive courage from the conviction that God himself
is the author of their calling and become thus magnanimous; for God will
then supply them with strength and courage invincible, so as to render
them formidable to the whole world: but if they be unhinged and timid,
and turn here and there, and be influenced by the fear of men, God will
render them base and contemptible, and make them to tremble at the least
breath of air, and they shall be wholly broken down; — and why? because
they are unworthy that God should help them, that he should stretch
forth his hand and fortify them by his power, and supply them, as it has
been already said, with that fortitude, by which they might terrify both
the Devil and the whole world.

<span id="xi.xv"></span>

<span id="xi.xv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xi.xv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast been
once pleased to fortify thy servant Jeremiah with the invincible power
of thy Spirit, — O grant that his doctrine may at this day make us
humble, and that we may learn willingly to submit to thee, and so to
receive and even cordially to accept what thou offerest to us by thy
servant — to sustain us by thine hand, and that we, relying on thy power
and protection, may fight against the world and against Satan, while
each of us, in his vocation, so recumbs on thy power, as not to
hesitate, whenever necessary, to expose our very life to dangers: and
may we manfully fight and persevere in our warfare to the end, until
having finished our course we shall at length come to that blessed rest
which is reserved for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xi.xv-p3"></span> 

<span id="xi.xvi"></span>

<span id="xi.xvi-p1"></span>Lecture Fourth

<span id="xi.xvii"></span>

<span id="xi.xvii-p1"></span><span id="xi.xvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018.md)<span id="xi.xvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xvii-p2"></span>**18**. For, behold, I have made thee this
day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the
whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof,
against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.

<span id="xi.xvii-p3"></span>**18**. Et ego,  <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) ecce posui to hodie in urbem munitionis
(*vel,* munitam) in columnam (*vel,* fulturam) ferream, et in murum
aeneum, super totam terram, contra Reges Jehudah, contra principes ejus,
contra sacerdotes ejus, contra populum terrae ipsius.

<span id="xi.xvii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xi.xvii-p6"></span><span id="xi.xvii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xvii-p7"></span>God supplies here his servant with
confidence; for courage was necessary in that state of trembling which
we have observed. Jeremiah thought himself unfit to undertake a work so
onerous; he had also to do and to contend with refractory men, and not a
few in number; for the whole people had already, through their ungodly
and wicked obstinacy, hardened themselves in the contempt of God. As,
then, there was no more any care for religion, and no regard manifested
by the people for heavenly truth, Jeremiah could not, diffident as he
was, undertake so heavy a burden, without being supported by the hand of
God. For this reason, then, God now declares that he would make him like
*a fortified city and an iron pillar*  <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) Indeed, the word prop would be more
proper; for <span id="xi.xvii-p10.1"></span>עמור *omud,* comes from the
root <span id="xi.xvii-p10.2"></span>עמד, *om*e*d;* and the Prophet
understands by it, not a pillar that is raised and stands by itself, but
that which sustains a building or a wall. There is no ambiguity in the
meaning; for God means that his servant would be invincible, and that
whatever his enemies might devise against him, they would not yet
prevail, as we find it said in the next verse.

<span id="xi.xvii-p11"></span>Now, though this was said formerly to
Jeremiah, yet godly teachers may justly apply it to themselves, who are
honestly conscious of their Divine call, and are fully persuaded that
they do nothing presumptuously, but obey the bidding of God. All, then,
who are thus confirmed in their legitimate call from God, can apply to
themselves this promise — that they shall be made invincible against all
the ungodly.

<span id="xi.xvii-p12"></span>But the particulars of this passage
deserve to be noticed. It might have seemed enough that God called his
servant a *fortified city;* but he compares him also to an *iron pillar*
or column, and to a *brazen wall* This repetition only confirms what we
have explained, — that Jeremiah would be victorious, and that though
Satan might rouse many to assail him, yet the issue would be prosperous
and joyful, as he would fight under the protection of God.

<span id="xi.xvii-p13"></span>It is at the same time added, *Over the
whole land* God doubtless speaks not of the whole world, but of the land
of Judah; for Jeremiah was chosen for this purpose, — that he might
bestow his labor on the chosen people. It is then said that he would be
a conqueror of the whole of Judea. It then follows, *against the kings
of Judah* We know, indeed, that there was only one king in Judea; but
God encourages his Prophet to be firm and persevering, as though he had
said, that the course of his warfare would be long; and he said this,
that he might not faint through weariness. The meaning then is, that the
Prophet would not have to contend with one king only, but that as soon
as one died, another would rise and oppose him; so that he was to know
that there would be no hope of rest until that time had passed which God
himself had appointed. We indeed know that those who are sincerely
disposed to obey, do yet look for some definite period, when, like
soldiers who have served their time, they may obtain a discharge; but
God declares here to his Prophet, that when he had strenuously contended
to the death of one king, his condition would be nothing better; for
others would succeed, with whom he would have to fight, as the same
wickedness and obstinacy would be still continued. To kings, he adds
*princes* and *priests;* and, lastly, the *whole people*

<span id="xi.xvii-p14"></span>When a king forgets his office and rules
tyrannically, it often happens that there are moderators who check his
passions, when they cannot wholly restrain them: we indeed see, that the
most cruel tyrants are sometimes softened by good counselors. But God
here reminds his Prophet that the state of things in Judea would be so
desperate, that ungodly and wicked kings would have counselors endued
with the same disposition. When *priests* are added, it might seem still
more monstrous; but the Scripture everywhere testifies, that the
Levitical priests had almost all degenerated and become apostates, so
that hardly one in a hundred shewed the least sign of religion. Since,
then, that order had become thus corrupt, it is no wonder that Jeremiah
had to declare war against the priests; and we shall hereafter see that
this was done. Now the common people might have seemed to be excusable,
as there was greater simplicity among them than among the higher orders;
(for they who are elevated above others transgress through pride or
cruelty, and often allow themselves too much liberty, relying on their
own eminence; but the common people, as I have said, seemed apparently
to have more modesty;) but God here declares that impiety had so greatly
prevailed in Judea, that all, from the least to the greatest, were
become perversely wicked. It was, therefore, necessary, as I have before
stated, that the Prophet should be fully armed; for what could he have
thought, had he not in time been warned, on finding afterwards such
insolence, yea, such fury in high and low, as to constrain him to
contend with God’s chosen people no otherwise than with devils? It
afterwards follows —

<span id="xi.xviii"></span>

<span id="xi.xviii-p1"></span><span id="xi.xviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#019.md)<span id="xi.xviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xviii-p2"></span>**19**. And they shall fight against thee;
but they shall not prevail against thee; for I *am* with thee, saith the
LORD, to deliver thee.

<span id="xi.xviii-p3"></span>**19**. Pugnabunt autem tecum (*vel,*
praeliabuntur contra to,) sed non praevalebunt tibi, quia tecum ego
(quia sum tecum,) dicit Jehova, ad to liberandum.

<span id="xi.xviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.xviii-p5"></span><span id="xi.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xviii-p6"></span>God in this verse briefly reminds his
servant, that though he would be supplied with invincible power, yet he
would have great trials, so that his office would not be, according to a
common saying, a mere play. He then shews for what purpose he would be
made like a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a brazen wall, even that
he might manfully fight, and not for the purpose of keeping away all
dangers, and all fightings, and everything hard and grievous to the
flesh. We, in short, see that the promise was given for this end, — that
Jeremiah, relying on God’s aid, might not hesitate to set himself
against all the Jews, and that whatever might be their fury, he might
still be courageous.

<span id="xi.xviii-p7"></span>Now a profitable doctrine may be hence
gathered, even this — that whenever God promises his servants victory
over their enemies, they ought not to make this the occasion of
fostering their torpidity or idleness, but, on the contrary, of
gathering courage, so that they may proceed boldly and unweariedly in
the course of their vocation. In short, God promises to be their
deliverer, but at the same time exhorts them to resist all the assaults
of their enemies.

<span id="xi.xviii-p8"></span>Hence he says, *They shall fight with
thee, but they shall not prevail, for I am with thee to deliver thee*
 <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) From these words we see that
Jeremiah was fully armed, that he might not fear on seeing dangers
surrounding him; for God does not here declare that he would be like a
wall to him to prevent him from being assaulted, but he says that he
would deliver him; as though he had said, “Prepare thyself to suffer;
for except I were thy deliverer, it would be all over with thee, and
thou mightest perish a hundred times; but there is no reason for thee to
fear any dangers amidst thousand deaths, since I am present with thee as
thy deliverer.” Now follows —

<span id="fn_5"></span>[6](cc17010.htm#fr_5.md) <span
id="xi.i-p11.2"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p12"></span> The word does not properly mean a “child,“
as in our version*, or* “<span id="xi.i-p12.1"></span>*puer,*“ *as
re*ndered by *Calvin*, but a youth, or rather a young man. Abraham’s
trained servants were thus called, <span id="xi.i-p12.2"></span>[Ge
14:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#024.md)<span id="xi.i-p12.2"></span>,
and his servant who dressed the calf for the angels, <span
id="xi.i-p12.3"></span>[Ge 18:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#007.md)<span
id="xi.i-p12.3"></span>, and his “young men” who accompanied him to
Mount Moriah, <span id="xi.i-p12.4"></span>[Ge
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#005.md)<span id="xi.i-p12.4"></span>.
Joshua had this name given him, when he was attending Moses at the
tabernacle, <span id="xi.i-p12.5"></span>[Ex
33:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#011.md)<span id="xi.i-p12.5"></span>. It
is rendered “(<span id="xi.i-p12.6"></span>νεωτερος)-a youth or a young
man,“ by the *Septuagint* The most probable thing is, that he was, not
as *Adam Clarke* supposes, about 14, but a young man verging on
maturity. The length of time during which he prophesied, would lead us
to conclude that he was young when he was appointed to his office.

<span id="xi.i-p13"></span>There are two remarkable resemblances between
Jeremiah and Moses. They both made an excuse for declining the office to
which God called them, and made a similar excuse. The other resemblance
is what *Lightfoot* has noticed, that Moses was a teacher of the people
for *forty years* before they entered the land of Canaan, and that
Jeremiah was their teacher for *forty years* before they were banished
from it and driven into exile. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[7](cc17010.htm#fr_6.md) <span
id="xi.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p17"></span> The reasons alleged against Jeremiah being
the son of the high priest are by no means conclusive: indeed, all the
circumstances being considered, the probability is in favor of that
supposition. The family of the high priest resided no doubt at Anathoth;
what is said in <span id="xi.i-p17.1"></span>[1Ki
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026.md)<span id="xi.i-p17.1"></span>,
respecting Abiathar, is a proof of this. That the high priest resided at
Jerusalem during the term of his office forms no objection; nor is the
genealogy of the high priests as given in <span
id="xi.i-p17.2"></span>[1Ch
6:1-17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#001.md)<span id="xi.i-p17.2"></span>,
any objection; for though in verse 13, Azariah is said to be the son of
Hilkiah, yet Jeremiah might have been one of his younger sons. Most
commentators agree indeed with *Calvin,* -*Gataker, Henry, Scott,
Blayney,* etc.; but they adduce no satisfactory reasons, sufficient to
invalidate the opinion of the Rabbins and the intimation contained in
the *Targum:* and this opinion is what the translators of the Geneva
Bible have adopted. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[8](cc17010.htm#fr_7.md) <span
id="xi.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p21"></span> The second verse begins with <span
id="xi.i-p21.1"></span>אשר which *Calvin* renders “<span
id="xi.i-p21.2"></span>nempeeven,“ and takes it in an exegetic sense:
but this is not its meaning. Our version is no doubt correct, “to whom;”
though there is no preposition before it, it is yet found before the
personal pronoun “to him,“ that comes afterwards. It is an idiom of the
language, and the very same exists in *Welsh,* in which the version is
literally the same with the Hebrew a relative pronoun without a
preposition followed by a personal pronoun with a preposition profixed
to it. It would be literally in English, “whom the word of Jehovah came
to him.” The Welsh also retains the peculiarity of the Hebrew, in having
prepositions prefixed to pronouns and attached to them, though this is
not the case generally with nouns,

<span id="xi.i-p22"></span><span id="xi.i-p22.1"></span>Yr hwn y daeth
gair Jehova atto.

<span id="xi.i-p23"></span>The verb too, as in the Hebrew, precedes its
nominative; “came” is before “the word of Jehovah.” It is rather
singular that the *Septuagint* have rendered this relative by “<span
id="xi.i-p23.1"></span>ὡσ — as,” which shews that the Hebrew idiom was
not understood by them. — Ed.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[9](cc17010.htm#fr_8.md) <span
id="xi.ii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p9"></span> More strictly, “in the inside,” or belly,
<span id="xi.ii-p9.1"></span>בטן. The specific term for womb is in the
next sentence, <span id="xi.ii-p9.2"></span>רחם. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_9"></span>[10](cc17010.htm#fr_9.md) <span
id="xi.v-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p3"></span> The words admit of two meanings. <span
id="xi.v-p3.1"></span>לא-ידעתי דבר-I have not known word, or, I know not
word. The phrase may signify, I have no word to say, or, I know not how
to say a word. The first meaning is what the context seems to
countenance. The answer given to him refers to his two objections — that
he had no word to say, and that he was a young man. The last is first
answered, according to the usual mode of writing adopted by the
prophets, “To every one whom I shall send thee to, thou shalt go;” and
then the first objection is removed, “and everything that I shall
command thee, thou shalt speak.” The answer goes on, and refers to the
points in the same order, “Fear not;” and then to remedy the want
complained of; Jehovah is represented as putting his words in his mouth,
so that he might have what was necessary for him to say. God promised
courage though he was young, and gave him a message to deliver: thus his
two objections were removed.

<span id="xi.v-p4"></span>We meet with a similar phrase in <span
id="xi.v-p4.1"></span>[Jer 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#015.md)<span
id="xi.v-p4.1"></span>; <span id="xi.v-p4.2"></span>[Jer
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#012.md)<span id="xi.v-p4.2"></span>,
which is, literally, “and shame they know not.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[11](cc17010.htm#fr_10.md) <span
id="xi.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p7"></span> The proper rendering is, “Fear not before
them,” or, on their account: <span id="xi.vi-p7.2"></span>סמני is
invariably a preposition, before, from before, because of, on account
of, for, by, through; <span id="xi.vi-p7.3"></span>[De
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#021.md)<span id="xi.vi-p7.3"></span>;
<span id="xi.vi-p7.4"></span>[Ex
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#019.md)<span id="xi.vi-p7.4"></span>;
<span id="xi.vi-p7.5"></span>[De
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#019.md)<span id="xi.vi-p7.5"></span>;
<span id="xi.vi-p7.6"></span>[Jer
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013.md)<span id="xi.vi-p7.6"></span>; and
it is often, though not always, so rendered in our version. The very
same phrase is found in <span id="xi.vi-p7.7"></span>[Jos
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#006.md)<span id="xi.vi-p7.7"></span>, and
rendered, “Be not afraid, because of them;” and also in this book, <span
id="xi.vi-p7.8"></span>[Jer 41:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer041.htm#018.md)<span
id="xi.vi-p7.8"></span>, “They were afraid of them.” It may, indeed, be
rendered, “Fear them not,” or, “Be not afraid of them.” To introduce
“face” or “faces” is by no means right. *Gataker’s* rendering is, “Fear
not before them;” and *Blayney’s*, “Be not thou afraid because of them.”
— *Ed*

<span id="fn_11"></span>[12](cc17010.htm#fr_11.md) <span
id="xi.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p10"></span> “Earthly kings and sovereigns,” observes
*Gataker* on this verse, “are not wont to go with those whom they send
on embassage; God goeth along with those whom he sends, and is by his
powerful protection, at all times and in all places, present with them.”
— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[13](cc17010.htm#fr_12.md) <span
id="xi.vii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p20"></span> The whole of this verse is arranged
according to the usual manner of the Prophets. The word “nations” comes
first, and then “kingdoms.” Three lines follow; the first word in each
line refers to “kingdoms,” and the last to “nations.” The <span
id="xi.vii-p20.1"></span>ו, *vau,* in the second line is omitted in many
copies, and there seems to be no need of it; and it is not true what
*Blayney* says, that there are MSS. which supply the <span
id="xi.vii-p20.2"></span>ו before the last line, though it be supplied
by the *Septuagint* To preserve the distinct meaning of each verb, I
offer the following rendering: —

<span id="xi.vii-p21"></span>See, I have set thee this day  
Over nations and over kingdoms,  
To root up, and to break down,  
To destroy, and to erase,  
To build up, and to plant.

<span id="xi.vii-p22"></span>He was to root up kingdoms, and to break
down nations; then he adds stronger words, for he was to destroy, or
wholly to destroy kingdoms, and to erase or to obliterate nations. The
reason for the repetition is well stated by *Calvin*. As to his other
work, two words only are used: he was to build up kingdoms, and to plant
nations. A nation, of course, exists before a kingdom, and this order is
observed in the second line; but the order, as it is usual with the
sacred writers, not only of the Old, but also of the New Testament, is
then reversed. See an instance in <span id="xi.vii-p22.1"></span>[Rom.
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010.md)<span id="xi.vii-p22.1"></span>,
where indeed the true order is given last, the ostensible act being in
the first instance stated, and then the principle from which it
proceeds. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[14](cc17010.htm#fr_13.md) <span
id="xi.viii-p9.4"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p10"></span> The word is rendered “a rod of almond” by
the *Septuagint,* the *Arabic* version, and *Theodotion;* and also by
*Piscator, Drusius, Grotius,* and *Blayney;* and “the rod of the
watcher” by *Sym*., *Aq*., and the *Vulgate* The latter is no doubt more
suitable in a translation. Some conclude, from what is related in <span
id="xi.viii-p10.1"></span>[Nu 17](../../../bib/kjv/num017.htm#000.md)<span
id="xi.viii-p10.1"></span>, that the head of each tribe carried a wand
or a staff made of the almond tree as a token of watchfulness: if so,
the probability is, that this wand was presented to the view of the
Prophet. It being a well-known emblem of watchfulness, and called
perhaps the watchful rod or staff, it was most suitable to the purposes
here designed. The verb <span id="xi.viii-p10.2"></span>שקד does not
mean to hasten, but to watch, or to be awake. Then the version of the
passage would be the following: -

<span id="xi.viii-p11"></span>**11**. And the word of Jehovah came to
me, saying, “What seest thou, Jeremiah?” and I said, “The rod of a
watcher is what I see.”

<span id="xi.viii-p12"></span>**12**. Then Jehovah said to me, “Thou
seest rightly, for I am watching over my word to do it.”

<span id="xi.viii-p13"></span>— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[15](cc17010.htm#fr_14.md) <span
id="xi.xi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p12"></span> Most agree with *Calvin,* that the pot
means the Jewish nation; so the learned *Gataker* in the Ass. Ann.,
*Grotius, Henry,* and *Scott*. There is some difference as to “its
face.” The first of these authors, followed by the two last, thinks that
the face means the front of the fire or the hearth, and therefore the
front of the pot. This face or front was towards the north, signifying
that the fuel and the blowing would be from that quarter, as it is
afterwards stated. As to the metaphor, the pot, or cauldron, see <span
id="xi.xi-p12.1"></span>[Ezek. 11:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#003.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#007.md), [Ezek.
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#005.md)<span id="xi.xi-p12.1"></span>.

<span id="xi.xi-p13"></span>The version of the Geneva Bible is, “I see a
seething-pot looking out of the north;” and the Chaldean army is
regarded as the pot: and *Blayn*ey, following the marginal reading of
our version, has given a similar rendering, “and the face thereof is
turned from the north.” But <span id="xi.xi-p13.1"></span>מפני is a
preposition, and rendered often, “from before,” and, “before,” (see note
on verse 8;) and to say that its face was before the north means the
same as towards the north: and this is the rendering of *Jun*. and
*Trem* *,* and *Piscator,* “versus *Aquilonem*.”

<span id="xi.xi-p14"></span>“The boiling-pot” is a pot “kindled
under-<span id="xi.xi-p14.1"></span>ὑποκαιόμενον,” by the *Sept* The
literal rendering of <span id="xi.xi-p14.2"></span>סיר נפוח is, “a pot
blown,“ meaning the fire under it. It was a pot set on a fire that was
blown, and the front of it was toward the north, from whence the blowing
came. The same word as a noun is used by Jeremiah in <span
id="xi.xi-p14.3"></span>[Jer 6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029.md)<span
id="xi.xi-p14.3"></span>, and signifies an instrument for blowing, and
is rendered “bellows” in our version. It was then a pot set on a fire
that was blown, which intimated the severe calamities which the Jews
were soon to endure, as *Grotius* observes. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_15"></span>[16](cc17010.htm#fr_15.md) <span
id="xi.xii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xii-p8"></span> Perhaps the more literal rendering would
be, “I will call to,” or for. The version of *Septuagint* is, “<span
id="xi.xii-p8.1"></span>συγκάλω-I will summon;” of *Vatablus,* “<span
id="xi.xii-p8.2"></span>invitabo — I will invite;” of *Piscator,* “<span
id="xi.xii-p8.3"></span>vocabo — I will call;” and of *Blayney,* “I will
call for.” — *Ed*

<span id="fn_16"></span>[17](cc17010.htm#fr_16.md) <span
id="xi.xii-p8.6"></span>

<span id="xi.xii-p9"></span> They are called “families,“ say some,
because kings are called fathers; but probable it is a mode of speaking
retained from primitive times, as we find that those called “families”
in <span id="xi.xii-p9.1"></span>[Ge
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md)<span id="xi.xii-p9.1"></span>,
are called “nations” in <span id="xi.xii-p9.2"></span>[Ge
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018.md)<span id="xi.xii-p9.2"></span>. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[18](cc17010.htm#fr_17.md) <span
id="xi.xii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xii-p12"></span> The original word, <span
id="xi.xii-p12.1"></span>כסא, not only means a throne, but a seat; see
<span id="xi.xii-p12.2"></span>[1Sa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#009.md)<span id="xi.xii-p12.2"></span>;
<span id="xi.xii-p12.3"></span>[1Sa
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#018.md)<span id="xi.xii-p12.3"></span>;
and <span id="xi.xii-p12.4"></span>[2Ki
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#010.md)<span id="xi.xii-p12.4"></span>,
where it is rendered in our version “a stool.” *Grotius* renders it here
“<span id="xi.xii-p12.5"></span>praetorium castrense — a camp’s tent.”
The “throne” is derived from the *Septuagint*. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_18"></span>[19](cc17010.htm#fr_18.md) <span
id="xi.xii-p12.6"></span>

<span id="xi.xii-p13"></span> Literally it is “The opening of the
gates.” The preposition *at* is not in the original; and the word in
some other places is found without it. See <span
id="xi.xii-p13.1"></span>[Ge
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#011.md)<span id="xi.xii-p13.1"></span>;
<span id="xi.xii-p13.2"></span>[Ge
43:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#017.md)<span id="xi.xii-p13.2"></span>.
The preposition <span id="xi.xii-p13.3"></span>ἐπὶ is given by the
*Septuagint,* “<span id="xi.xii-p13.4"></span>ἐπὶ τὰ πρόθυρα-at or in
the vestibules,“ etc. We have the fulfillment of this expressly recorded
in <span id="xi.xii-p13.5"></span>[Jer
39:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md)<span id="xi.xii-p13.5"></span>.
The idea suggested by *Adam Clarke,* that they would sit as judges in
the gates, as these were the courts of justice, is evidently not
intended here; for they would also fix their tents or their seats by or
on the walls, and in all the cities of Judah. The latter portion of the
verse may be thus rendered, —

<span id="xi.xii-p14"></span>And they shall come, and set, each his
seat,  
At the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem,  
And on all its walls around,  
And on all the cities of Judah.

<span id="xi.xii-p15"></span>The description betokens an entire
possession of the whole land. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[20](cc17010.htm#fr_19.md) <span
id="xi.xiii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="xi.xiii-p8"></span> The idea conveyed by the *Septuagint* is
somewhat different, and I believe that it is what the original words
mean, “<span id="xi.xiii-p8.1"></span>λαλήσω πρὸς αὐτοὺς μετὰ κρίσεως —
I will speak to them with judgment.” The original literally is, “and I
will speak my judgments to them;” that is, I will not speak words but
judgments: or, I will not address them with words, but with actual
judgments. Then in the following words the reason is assigned. The verse
may be thus rendered, —

<span id="xi.xiii-p9"></span>**16.** And I will speak *by* my judgments
to them, On account of all their wickedness, Because they have forsaken
me, And have burnt incense to strange gods, And have bowed down to the
work of their own hands.

<span id="xi.xiii-p10"></span>It is better to retain the outward act as
expressed by the last verb, “bowed down.” or, more literally, “bowed
down themselves,“ as the verb is in the reflective mood, than to adopt
the abstract term “worshipped.” So the verb is rendered in the second
commandment, <span id="xi.xiii-p10.1"></span>[Ex
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md)<span id="xi.xiii-p10.1"></span>;
<span id="xi.xiii-p10.2"></span>[De
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#009.md)<span id="xi.xiii-p10.2"></span>.

<span id="xi.xiii-p11"></span>The first, line is rendered by *Grotius,*
“<span id="xi.xiii-p11.1"></span>*Proedicam illis decreta mea* — I will
declare to them my decrees, “that is, by Jeremiah and others, — by
*Jun*. and *Trem*., “I will speak my judgments against them,” that is,
by the prophets, — by *Henry*. “I will pass sentence upon them,” — by
*Blayney,* “I will pronounce my judgments against them;” and *Scott*
gives the same view. But *Gataker* says, “It seems rather to import an
efficacious and actual decree that God would, in his own appointed time,
pass upon them, and put in execution by the Chaldeans.” Hence he renders
the phrase like *Henry,* “I will pass sentence,“ or, “give judgment,
upon them.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[21](cc17010.htm#fr_20.md) <span
id="xi.xiv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xiv-p7"></span> This is correctly given, only the <span
id="xi.xiv-p7.1"></span>ו need not be rendered “then” or “therefore.” It
is an instance of the nominative absolute, or of the anticipative case,
-

<span id="xi.xiv-p8"></span>And thou, gird thy loins,  
And arise, and speak to them  
All that I shall command thee.

<span id="xi.xiv-p9"></span>“And as for thee,” by *Blayney,* is very
tame and prosaic. The version of the *Geneva Bible* is, “Thou,
therefore, trusse up thy loyns.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[22](cc17010.htm#fr_21.md) <span
id="xi.xiv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xiv-p17"></span> It is true that the primary meaning of the
verb here used is, to be broken, or to be broken down, to be broken in
pieces. It is applied to the breaking of a bow, and to the breaking down
of images, <span id="xi.xiv-p17.1"></span>[1Sa
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#004.md)<span id="xi.xiv-p17.1"></span>;
<span id="xi.xiv-p17.2"></span>[Jer
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002.md)<span id="xi.xiv-p17.2"></span>;
and to the breaking down of nations, (<span
id="xi.xiv-p17.3"></span>[Isa 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003.md)<span
id="xi.xiv-p17.3"></span>; <span id="xi.xiv-p17.4"></span>[Isa
30:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#031)<span id="xi.xiv-p17.4"></span>..md)
Such is its meaning when applied to what is material and visible; but
when applied to the mind or spirit, it means to be dispirited, daunted,
terrified, or dismayed, <span id="xi.xiv-p17.5"></span>[2Ki
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#026.md)<span id="xi.xiv-p17.5"></span>;
<span id="xi.xiv-p17.6"></span>[Jer
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#009.md)<span id="xi.xiv-p17.6"></span>. It
is here first in a passive sense, and then in *Hiphil,* as in <span
id="xi.xiv-p17.7"></span>[Job
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#034.md)<span id="xi.xiv-p17.7"></span>;
and in <span id="xi.xiv-p17.8"></span>[Jer
49:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#037.md)<span id="xi.xiv-p17.8"></span>,
—

<span id="xi.xiv-p18"></span>Be not dismayed at them,  
Lest I cause thee to be dismayed before them.

<span id="xi.xiv-p19"></span>or,

<span id="xi.xiv-p20"></span>Be not terrified by them,  
Lest I terrify thee before them.

<span id="xi.xiv-p21"></span>*Blayney* gives to the verb first its
secondary meaning, and then its primary, “Be not thou afraid of them,
lest I should suffer thee to be crushed before them.” How crushed before
them? By whom? And to say that there is no threat included in the last
line is singular, as words could hardly be framed to express it more
distinctly.

<span id="xi.xiv-p22"></span>The *Targum* expresses the meaning of the
first line, “Restrain not thyself from rebuking them.” *Grotius* renders
the last line, “<span id="xi.xiv-p22.1"></span>Ne ego to perterrefaciam
coram illis — lest I terrify thee before them;” which seems to be its
best rendering. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[23](cc17010.htm#fr_22.md) <span
id="xi.xiv-p22.2"></span>

<span id="xi.xiv-p23"></span> *Cotton,* the old translator, has rendered
it very strikingly, “If thou quailest,” expressing the two words in one.

<span id="xi.xvii-p4"></span> We find here nearly the same form or mode
of speech as at the beginning of the previous verse, “And I, behold I
have made thee,” etc.: and *Blayney* renders it so here, though not in
the preceding instance. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[25](cc17010.htm#fr_24.md) <span
id="xi.xvii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xvii-p8"></span> There is the preposition <span
id="xi.xvii-p8.1"></span>ל before “city,” “pillar,” and “wall.” It is an
idiom. The full meaning is, “I have made thee *to be* for a fortified
city.” The same idiom exists in *Welsh,* the preposition <span
id="xi.xvii-p8.2"></span>*yn* is used, which implies that the verb *to
be* is understood. But it is not necessary to retain the preposition in
a language in which a similar idiom does not exist. The *Septuagint*
render the preposition by “<span id="xi.xvii-p8.3"></span>ὡς — as,” and
*Jun* and *Trem* *,* by “<span id="xi.xvii-p8.4"></span>velut — as,” or
like. And such a word would be suitable in our language, —

<span id="xi.xvii-p9"></span>And I, behold I have made thee this day  
Like a city that is fortified,  
And like a pillar of iron,  
And like a wall of brass,  
With regard to the whole land,  
To the kings of Judah, to its princes,  
To its priests, and to the people of the land.

<span id="xi.xvii-p10"></span>“To” here means in opposition to-he was to
stand opposed to the kings, etc., as a fortified city, etc. “Wall” is
plural in the received text; but many MSS., the *Septuagint,* the
*Syriac,* the *Targum,* and the *Vulgate,* have it in the singular
number, which seems most suitable. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[26](cc17010.htm#fr_25.md) <span
id="xi.xviii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xviii-p9"></span> It ought to be, “For with thee will I be,
to deliver thee;” for the verb *to be,* being understood, it must be put
in the same tense with the other verbs in the passage: and such is the
rendering of *Blayney*. — *Ed*.
