<span id="xvi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md)<span id="xvi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p2"></span>**1**. O ye children of Benjamin, gather
yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet
in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth
out of the north, and great destruction.

<span id="xvi.ii-p3"></span>**1**. Congregamini filii Benjamin e medio
Jerusalem, et in Thekua clangite tuba, et Bethhacherem tollite signum;
quia malum visum est ab Aquilone et afflictio magna.

<span id="xvi.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.ii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p6"></span>WE have already seen that oftentimes
punishment is not only mentioned by this Prophet as being nigh at hand,
but is also set as it were before our eyes; and we have shewn the reason
for this, — because men are not only deaf, but wholly thoughtless,
whenever God threatens them. As reproofs make no impressions, and even
threatenings are not sufficient to arouse and awake them, it is
necessary to set before them vivid descriptions, and to represent the
event as present. Jeremiah continues this mode of teaching; he addresses
the tribe of Benjamin; for one half of Jerusalem was in the territory of
that tribe; And as he was from Anathoth, he addresses his own people and
kindred rather than others, as he could use greater freedom. Had he
directly reproved the Jews, they might not have so well borne with him;
but as he begins with his neighbors, the tribe of Benjamin, it became
more easy to bear his reproofs.

<span id="xvi.ii-p7"></span>Some understand the words, “Be ye assembled,
and flee;” others read, “Go ye in haste, “but for what reason I know
not. I do not think that flight is meant here; but I rather regard the
Prophet as ironically encouraging the citizens of Jerusalem and their
neighbors to go forth, as it is usual, to meet their enemies; and this
we may easily learn from the context: *Be ye* *assembled*, he says,
*from the midst of Jerusalem*; that is, Be aroused and go forth. And he
indirectly condemns their indulgences, for they had been lying as it
were in the bosom of their mother. Like infants in the womb, the Jews
were not apprehensive of any danger; they indulged themselves, and were
wholly secure and thoughtless. Hence he says, “From the midst of
Jerusalem be ye assembled.”  <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md)

<span id="xvi.ii-p11"></span>Then he says, *Blow ye the trumpet in
Tekoa*. They were wont, no doubt, when any danger was at hand, to blow
the trumpet in that town; and then the citizens of Jerusalem went forth
in large bodies to resist their enemies: for the Prophet follows the
usual custom, and speaks as of things well known. *And set up a sign* on
the house of Haccerem, <span id="xvi.ii-p11.1"></span>הכרם. No doubt
this place was so called, because many forces were planted there. It
means literally the house of the vineyard. It is, indeed, a proper name;
but its etymology ought to be borne in mind; for as vines were usually
planted on hills, it is probable that this place stood high; and a sign
might have been thence given to many around. He therefore says, “Set up
a sign, <span id="xvi.ii-p11.2"></span>משאת, *meshat*, a word derived
from <span id="xvi.ii-p11.3"></span>נשא, *nesha*, which is also found
here: but some interpreters render it “fire” or bonfire; others
“banner;” and others “tower.” They who render it tower or citadel have
no reason in their favor; for towers could not have been suddenly raised
up. But it is probable, as I have already said, that thence a sign was
given to those around, as from a watch — tower, whenever there was any
cause of fear. I am therefore inclined to take the word as meaning a
sign; for the word “banner” would have been too restricted. Literally it
is, “Elevate an elevation.” The word “sign, “then, is the most suitable.
 <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md)

<span id="xvi.ii-p13"></span>*For an evil*, he says, *from the north has
appeared*  <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) The Prophet points
out whence ruin would soon come, even from the Chaldeans, for God had
appointed them as the ministers and the executioners of his vengeance in
destroying Jerusalem and the whole tribe of Judah. We hence see what the
Prophet means: he ridicules the Jews, who were asleep in their vices,
promising to themselves impunity, and despising all the judgments of
God: “Be now assembled, “he says, “from the midst of Jerusalem;” as
though he said, that they could not be safe in the city, without going
forth to meet their enemies: “Blow ye the trumpet in Tekoa;” and then he
adds, “Let the inhabitants of Bethhaccerem, “that is, of the house of
the vineyard, “set up signals; for an evil is nigh at hand, and a great
distress;” from whom? from the Chaldeans. The prediction was more likely
to be believed, when he thus pointed out their enemies, as it were, by
his finger. It afterwards follows —

<span id="xvi.iii"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#002.md)<span id="xvi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p2"></span>**2**. I have likened the daughter of Zion
to a comely and delicate *woman*

<span id="xvi.iii-p3"></span>**2**. Quietae (*alii vertunt*, speciosam;
*sed alter sensus melius quadrat*, quietae *igitur*) et delicatae
similem feci filiam Sion.

<span id="xvi.iii-p4"></span>**3**. The shepherds with their flocks
shall come unto her; they shall pitch *their* tents against her round
about; they shall feed every one in his place.

<span id="xvi.iii-p5"></span>**3**. Super eam venient pastores et greges
eorum, figent adversus eam tabernecula sua in circuitu; pascent vir ad
manum suam (*hoc est*, quisque ad locum suum).

<span id="xvi.iii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xvi.iii-p7"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p8"></span>As the place, where the Prophet was born,
was pastoral, he retained many expressions derived from his education;
for God did not divest his servants of every natural endowment when he
appointed them to teach his people. Hence the Prophet here speaks
according to notions imbibed in his early age and childhood. The
daughter of Sion, he says, is like a quiet maid, that is, one dwelling
at leisure and enjoying herself; and yet she would be exposed to many
indignities, for come shall shepherds, and around fix their tents; and
the whole country would be subjected to plunder. But it is doubtful
whether the Prophet says, that the daughter of Sion might be compared to
a maid, tender and delicate, dwelling at ease and cheerful, or whether
he means, that rest had been for a time granted to the people. There
seems, indeed, to be no great difference, though there is some, between
the two explanations.

<span id="xvi.iii-p9"></span>If we take the verb, <span
id="xvi.iii-p9.1"></span>דמיתי, *damiti*, in the sense of comparing, as
interpreters do, then it is the same as though the Prophet had said, “I
seem to see in the state of Jerusalem the image of a tender and delicate
maid.” Thus Jeremiah speaks in his own name. But the sentence may be
more fitly applied to God, — that he had made the daughter of Sion quiet
for a time, and had given her peace with her enemies, so that she lived
at ease and cheerfully.

<span id="xvi.iii-p10"></span>Though these two views differ, yet the
subject itself is nearly the same. The Prophet, no doubt, condemns here
the Jews for their extreme torpidity, inasmuch as they had wholly
misapplied the quietness granted them by God. He then proves that they
were very thoughtless and stupid in thinking that their tranquillity
would be perpetual, for it was God’s favor, and only for a time. Hence
he says, that the Jews were until that very day like a tender maid. For
though the country of the ten tribes had been laid waste, and all had
been driven away into exile, yet the kingdom of Judah continued safe.
They had, indeed, been plundered by enemies, but in comparison with
their brethren they had been very kindly treated. This, then, is the
reason, why he says that they were like a maid delicate and tender.
 <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md)

<span id="xvi.iii-p16"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p17"></span>But he afterwards adds, *Come shall
shepherds*, *etc*.; that is, there is no ground for the Jews to deceive
themselves, because God has hitherto spared them, and restrained the
assaults of enemies; for now shall *come shepherds*. He keeps to the
same metaphor; “come, “he says, “shall shepherds, “together with their
flocks; that is, come shall leaders of armies with their forces. But I
have already reminded you, that the Prophet here has a regard to the
city where he had been born, and adopts a pastoral language. *Come* then
*shall shepherds with their flocks; fix shall they their tents, and feed
shall each in his place*, he means that the whole of Jerusalem would be
so much in the power of enemies, that each one would freely choose his
own part or his own portion; for when there is any fear, then the
shepherds gather their flocks, that they may assist one another; but
when everything is in their own power, they move here and there as they
please. This free acting then intimates, that the Jews would have no
strength, and would be helped by no aid; but that the shepherds would
surround the whole city and besiege it: every one, he says, would be in
his own place.  <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) It follows —

<span id="xvi.iv"></span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p1"></span><span id="xvi.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#004.md)<span id="xvi.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p2"></span>**4**. Prepare ye war against her; arise,
and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the
shadows of the evening are stretched out.

<span id="xvi.iv-p3"></span>**4**. Sanctificate super eam proelium;
surgite et ascendamus meridie: vae nobis, quia inclinavit dies, quia
extensae sunt umbrae vespertinae.

<span id="xvi.iv-p4"></span>**5**. Arise, and let us go by night, and
let us destroy her palaces.

<span id="xvi.iv-p5"></span>**5**. Surgite et ascendamus noctu, et
demoliamur palatia ejus.

<span id="xvi.iv-p6"></span> 

<span id="xvi.iv-p7"></span><span id="xvi.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p8"></span>The Prophet leaves here the similitude he
had adopted; for he does not now speak of shepherds, but expressly
describes the enemies, as coming with great force, and furiously
attacking and laying waste both the city and the whole of Judea. He was
before like God’s herald, proclaiming war; but he now, by a sort of
personification, introduces the Chaldeans encouraging one another to
fight. *Sanctify*, he says, *war against her*. So the Hebrews speak; for
in all ages wars, we know, were proclaimed by a solemn rite. God, no
doubt, has implanted this feeling in all nations, that no wars should be
suddenly undertaken, and that no arms should be taken up except for a
lawful reason: for the proclamation of war was a testimony, that they
did not contend with one another but for causes just and necessary. It
is indeed true, that wars have been often undertaken rashly, and for no
just causes; but yet it was God’s will that this custom should remain
and continue in use, in order to take away excuse from men given to
cruelty, or led by ambition to disturb the world and harass others. This
then is the reason for this manner of speaking, *Sanctify war*; it is
the same as though they declared and proclaimed a just war by a solemn
ceremony. It was according to the common practice that the Prophet spoke
when he said, *Sanctify war against her*, as we say in our language,
*Sommez* — *la*

<span id="xvi.iv-p9"></span>Then follows the readiness of the enemies,
yea, their incredible quickness, for he shews that they were extremely
swift, *Arise ye, and let us ascend at mid-day*. But they who come to
assail a city do so usually in the morning. When the heat prevails, it
is not a suitable time, for the heat of the sun debilitates the body.
Then enemies rest when night comes, except an unexpected advantage
should offer itself: but having been refreshed, they rise early with
recruited strength for fighting; they scale the walls or assail the city
by other means, or beat down the walls by warlike instruments: but to
begin the work at mid-day, when a city is to be attacked, is by no means
usual. Hence the Prophet intimates, that so ripened was God’s judgment,
that the Chaldeans, after having come to the walls of the city, would
not wait, no, not even a few hours. *Arise ye, and let us ascend at
mid-day*

<span id="xvi.iv-p10"></span>He then subjoins, *Alas for us, for
declined has the day, and the evening shadows are extended*. He employs
a military language; for soldiers, we know, are for the most part fierce
and barbarous, and never speak in moderate terms. They have ever in
their mouths, “Alas for us!” or they use some other words, reproachful
either to God or to men. The Prophet then expresses the words of the
soldiers; for he describes the Chaldeans, and represents, as I have
said, to the Jews the scene as present, that he might dissipate their
delusions, in which they were wholly asleep. *Alas*, then, *for us*!
*for declined has* already *the day*, already *have the evening shadows
extended*: they who have added, “Too far,” because they had declined
more than usual, have mistaken the meaning of the Prophet. It is the
same as though he had said, “Already the night is nigh, and why should
we give over? and why do we not make such an impetuous assault as to
take the city in a moment?” This is the real meaning of the words.

<span id="xvi.iv-p11"></span><span id="xvi.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p12"></span>He afterwards adds, *Arise ye, and let us
ascend in the night*; that is, “As we cannot take the city in six hours,
(from mid-day to night were six hours, for they divided the day into
twelve hours, and the first hour began at the rising of the sun, and the
twelfth hour closed the day,) as then we cannot take the city in six
hours, let us attack it in the night.” We see here how graphically is
described the extreme ardor of their enemies; for they were urged on by
the hidden power of God; and this is what Jeremiah intended to express.
 <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) He afterwards adds —

<span id="xvi.v"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p1"></span><span id="xvi.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#006.md)<span id="xvi.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p2"></span>**6**. For thus hath the Lord of hosts said,
Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this *is* the
city to be visited; she *is* wholly oppression in the midst of her.

<span id="xvi.v-p3"></span>**6**. Quia sic dicit Jehova exercituum,
Excidite ligna et fundite super Jerusalem aggerem (*alii vertunt*,
balistam; *sed nomen aggeris hic melius convenit*;) ipsa est urbs
visitationis (*hic variant interpretes*, *et quidem exercitati in lingua
Hebraea sic depravant sensum ut piqeat referre quid ipsi ausi sunt
scribere*,) tota oppressio (*vel*, rapina; *nam* <span
id="xvi.v-p3.1"></span> עשק*significat rapere*, rapina *ergo*) in medio
ejus.

<span id="xvi.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.v-p5"></span><span id="xvi.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p6"></span>The Prophet now points out the cause why a
near calamity awaited both the city and the whole of Judea. Two things
were necessary to be done: as the Jews had hardened themselves in their
thoughtlessness, so that they disregarded all the threatenings of the
prophets, it was necessary to expose and reprove this stupidity. This is
what the Prophet has hitherto done. But the other thing needful to be
done was, to make the Jews to know that they had not to do with the
Chaldeans or other nations, but with God himself, with whom they had for
a long time carried on war. The Prophet then, after having set before
the eyes of his own kindred the calamity which was then nigh at hand,
shews now that God was its author.

<span id="xvi.v-p7"></span>*Thus saith Jehovah of hosts*. He reminds
them here of the judgment of God, lest they thought that they could
overcome their enemies, even if they fought with the greatest ardor and
the greatest courage, for they could not overcome God. *Thus* then
*saith* the God *of hosts*; as though he had said, “The Chaldeans will
indeed bring their forces, which shall be great and strong; but the
contest will be now with God, whom ye have so often and for a long time
and so pertinaciously provoked.” *Thus* then *saith* now the God *of
hosts*, —

<span id="xvi.v-p8"></span>*Cut ye down wood*; that is, “The Chaldeans
will not of themselves attack you, but they will fight for God, and
serve him as hired soldiers.” As we have seen elsewhere that God blows
the trumpet, and sends by a hiss for whomsoever he pleases; so also he
says now that the Chaldeans would carry on war under the authority and
banner of God. Command them then did God to cut down wood and to *cast
up a mound*. We indeed know that warlike engines were made of timber,
but the most suitable word here, as it is evident, is mound.

<span id="xvi.v-p9"></span>It follows, *She is the city of visitation*.
Jeremiah shews here that God would justly act towards the Jews, though
with much severity, because they had nearly become putrid in their
vices; for this reason he calls it the *city of visitation*. They
therefore who render the words, “that it may be laid waste, “or, “it is
laid waste, “misconceive the meaning; and indeed they touch neither
heaven nor earth, for they consider not the Prophet’s design, but only
dwell on the words. But it is certain, that Jerusalem is called the city
of visitation, because God had exercised long patience and suspended
punishment, until the ripened time of vengeance came, so that it could
no longer be endured, inasmuch as it had become more and more corrupt
through the forbearance of God. It is, he says, the *city of
visitation*; that is, “The time of extreme vengeance is now come; for I
have tried all means to see whether there was any hope of repentance;
but I now find that she is wholly irreclaimable. She is then the city of
visitation; its ruin cannot be suspended any longer.”

<span id="xvi.v-p10"></span>The Prophet obviates here, as I have already
said, all those complaints which the Jews were ever ready to make; for
they were wont to murmur when any severity appeared, and say, “God deals
cruelly with us; where is his covenant? where is that paternal kindness
which he has promised to us?” As then the Jews were wont thus to
expostulate with God, the Prophet says that it was the *city of
visitation*, and the whole of it, and not a part only. As then there was
nothing pure in it, he says that it could no longer be spared: and he
adds one kind of evil; but stating a part for the whole, he means (as it
is said elsewhere, <span id="xvi.v-p10.1"></span>[Jer
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#011)<span id="xvi.v-p10.1"></span>.md)
that Jerusalem was a den of thieves: he therefore says that it was full
of *rapines*, and that *oppression* was in its very bowels.  <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) It follows —

<span id="xvi.vi"></span>

<span id="xvi.vi-p1"></span><span id="xvi.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#007.md)<span id="xvi.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vi-p2"></span>**7**. As a fountain casteth out her waters,
so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her;
before me continually *is* grief and wounds.

<span id="xvi.vi-p3"></span>**7**. Sicuti scaturire facit puteus aquas
suas (*hoc est*, sicuti scaturiunt aquae ex fonte, *vel*, puteo,) sic
scaturire fecit malitiam suam; violentia et deceptio (*aut*, vastatio)
audita fuit in ea coram facie mea assidue, dolor et percussio (*alii
vertunt*, plagam; *sed nomen percussionis melius convenit*.)

<span id="xvi.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.vi-p5"></span><span id="xvi.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vi-p6"></span>The Prophet enlarges on what he had said in
the last verse; for he had shewn, by mentioning one kind of evil, that
Jerusalem was a den of thieves, as oppression dwelt in the midst of it.
But he now, by a comparison, amplifies his former statement, and says,
that violence, oppression, devastation, grief, and smiting, streamed
forth like waters from a fountain. It is possible for many vices to
break out from a place, but repentance afterwards follows; but when men
cease not, and heap vices on vices, it then appears that they swell with
wickedness, and even burst with it, as they cannot repress it: they are
like a fountain, which ever bubbles up, and cannot contain its own
waters. We hence see the object of the Prophet.

<span id="xvi.vi-p7"></span>The word <span id="xvi.vi-p7.1"></span>בור,
*bur*, means a fountain, and <span id="xvi.vi-p7.2"></span>באר, *bar*,
means also a fountain, or a well, and they are no doubt synonymous: and
hence appears the mistake of a very learned man among the Hebrews, who
makes a difference between the two, and says that the first is a
cistern, which receives waters, but has no streaming. That this is false
appears from the words of the Prophet; for a cistern does not cast forth
water.

<span id="xvi.vi-p8"></span>But with regard to what is taught, we
sufficiently understand that what the Prophet means is, — that the Jews
had so given up themselves to their vices, that they were ever
contriving some new way of doing evil, as waters never cease to stream
forth from the fountain; and it is a proof, as I have said, that a
nation is wholly irreclaimable, when there is no cessation from evil
deeds, when there is no intermission of injuries, when men ever indulge
in their vices; and as the Jews could not deny that such was the
atrocity of their wickedness, the Prophet again assumes the name of God,
and says, *Heard have been oppressions*, and *smitings are before me*;
as though he had said, “They will gain nothing by evasions, for if they
make a hundred excuses before men, it will be wholly useless to them
when they shall come before God’s tribunal.” And he again adds the
adverb *dymt*, *tamid*, continually, which answers to the perpetual
streaming of waters.  <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) It follows
—

<span id="xvi.vii"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#008.md)<span id="xvi.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p2"></span>**8**. Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem,
lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not
inhabited.

<span id="xvi.vii-p3"></span>**8**. Erudire Jerusalem, ne discedat
(*vel*, avellatur) anima mea abs to; ne ponam to desertum (*vel*,
solitudinem) et terram inhabitabilem (*hoc est*, quae non habitatur.)

<span id="xvi.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.vii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p6"></span>Though the Prophet had spoken as though
there was no remedy for the evils of Jerusalem, he yet exhorts it to
seek peace with God, and addresses men past remedy in his name. It is
then the same as though God was stopping in the middle course of his
wrath, and saying, “What is to be done? Shall I destroy the city which I
have chosen?” He then attributes here to God a paternal feeling, as we
also find in several other places: God appeared as unwilling to proceed
to extreme rigor in punishing his people.

<span id="xvi.vii-p7"></span>“Alas! I will now take vengeance on mine
enemies,”  
he says by Isaiah. (<span id="xvi.vii-p7.2"></span>[Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024)<span id="xvi.vii-p7.2"></span>.md)

<span id="xvi.vii-p8"></span>He called them enemies, and justly too; for
as it was said before, they ceased not to carry on war against him; but
he spoke with grief: “Alas! must I take vengeance on mine enemies; I
would, however, willingly spare them, were it possible.” God is not
indeed subject to grief or to repentance; but his ineffable goodness
cannot be otherwise expressed to us but by such mode of speaking. So
also, in this place, we see that God as it were restrains himself; for
he had previously commanded the enemies to ascend quickly the walls, to
overturn the towers, and to destroy the whole city; but now, as though
he had repented, he says, *Be instructed*,  <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) *Jerusalem*; that is, “Can we not yet
be reconciled?” It is like the conduct of an offended father, who
intends to punish his son, and yet desires to moderate his displeasure,
and to blend some indulgence with rigor. *Be* then *instructed*; that
is, “There is yet room for reconciliation, if thou wishest; provided
thou shewest thyself willing to relinquish that perverseness by which
thou hast hitherto provoked me, I will in return prove myself to be a
father.”

<span id="xvi.vii-p10"></span>There is no doubt but the object of the
threatenings of the prophets was to lead the people to know their sins,
and suppliantly to seek pardon; for why were the unbelieving threatened,
except that God thereby proved whether they were healable? It is indeed
true that the reprobate are known by God, and that God does not try or
seek to find what is in their hearts, as though he did not know their
obstinacy; but as I have already said, God speaks here after the manner
of men: and he also shews what is the end of teaching, which is to lead
men to repentance; and this cannot be done without giving them the hope
of pardon and reconciliation. The Prophet thus briefly shews here for
what purpose he had hitherto so dreadfully threatened the Jews, even to
lead them at length to repentance.

<span id="xvi.vii-p11"></span>*Lest torn shall be my soul from thee*
 <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) Here God more clearly shews
that he was as yet restrained by love. He alludes no doubt to a
similitude which we have observed in another place; for God sustains the
character of a spouse to his Church; and hence he shews, that he had not
yet divested himself of that love which a husband has towards his wife.
For a husband, when grievously offended at his wife, cannot immediately
throw aside his conjugal affection; some feeling of this kind will ever
remain. And we have seen in the fourth chapter, that God surpasses all
husbands in kindness; for he says there, “When a repudiated wife has
found another husband, will the former receive her again? Return to me,
thou harlot, return to me, thou strumpet and adulteress, and I am ready
to pardon thee.” It is the same course that God pursues here, “Be
instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul wholly depart from thee;” as though
he had said, “Even though I am now angry, and have resolved severely to
punish thy perfidy and rebellion, I shall yet be reconciled to thee,
provided thou returnest.” And it is added, *Lest I make thee a desolate
land, a land uninhabited*

<span id="xvi.vii-p13"></span>The Prophet in short shews in this verse,
that however grievously offended God was with his people, there was yet
a hope of pardon; for he would be propitious to the people, if they
turned and humbly confessed their sins, and sought to return into favor
with him. It follows —

<span id="xvi.viii"></span>

<span id="xvi.viii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.viii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#009.md)<span id="xvi.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.viii-p2"></span>**9**. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They
shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine
hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.

<span id="xvi.viii-p3"></span>**9**. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum,
Racemando racemabunt quasi vitem reliquias Israel; reduc (*vel*, redire
fac) manum tuam quasi vindemiator ad canistra (*alii vertunt*, ad
ramos.)

<span id="xvi.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.viii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.viii-p6"></span>God here confirms the former statement, as
though he had said, that he dreaded a sight so sad and mournful, which
yet the Jews disregarded. He then shews, that he did not in vain exhort
the Jews, even though late, to repent, for he foresaw how dreadful would
be their calamities. Hence he says, *Thus saith Jehovah of hosts,
Gleaning they shall glean*; for the word here does not mean to gather
the vintage, but to glean, *grapiller*, after the vintage. As after the
harvest the poor follow and gather ears of corn here and there, until
nothing remains in the field; so also in vintages when there is a
gleaning, nothing remains. Hence God in the law forbade the vineyards to
be gleaned, that there might be something left for the poor. (<span
id="xvi.viii-p6.1"></span>[Le
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#010.md)<span id="xvi.viii-p6.1"></span>;
<span id="xvi.viii-p6.2"></span>[De
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#021.md)<span
id="xvi.viii-p6.2"></span>.) But he says here, “Gleaning they shall
glean as a vine;” he speaks not of the people but of the remnant.

<span id="xvi.viii-p7"></span>The ten tribes had been plundered, and at
length their whole country had been laid waste, most of them had been
led into exile, but a few had sought hiding — places for a time: and he
says that they were like gleanings: “though, “he says, “there be a few
grapes, yet these shall follow.” In short, the Prophet sets before the
Jews that vengeance of God, which was known already to them as much as
to the Israelites, the ten tribes: and yet he shews that God’s vengeance
was not completed, for there were still a few remaining, a gleaning:
“What then shall come of you? What indeed! ye have seen that your
brethren have been plundered, ye have seen that they and their children
have been slain; ye have seen that all kinds of cruelty have been
exercised towards them; and yet after the name of Israel has been
obliterated, and their country now deserted, has become a waste, God
will still punish the remnant, and ye shall see that his judgment will
shortly overtake them; and what do ye, wretched beings, yet look for?
and how great is your torpidity, which never comes to an end? why do you
not seek to be reconciled to God, when such an opportunity is offered to
you?”

<span id="xvi.viii-p8"></span>We now then apprehend the Prophet’s
object. And then he says, *Return thy hand as a vintager to the
baskets*; that is, “Behold the vintagers, they stimulate one another; so
that there is no end of gleaning, as they ever return to their baskets,
until they gather everything, until there remains not a grape on the
vine.”  <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md)

<span id="xvi.ix"></span>

<span id="xvi.ix-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xvi.ix-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou kindly
invitest us to repentance, and urgest us also by setting before us
examples of thy wrath, — O grant, that we may not continue perversely
disobedient, but render ourselves tractable and submissive to thee, so
that we may not meet with that dreadful severity which thou didst
threaten to thine ancient people, but anticipate the wrath which thou
didst formerly denounce on them; and may we thus with a pious heart
return to thee, that we may find by experience that thou art ever a
propitious Father to sinners, whenever with a sincere heart and without
dissimulation they return to thee, through Christ Jesus our Lord. —
Amen.

<span id="xvi.x-p1"></span>LECTURE TWENTY-FOURTH

<span id="xvi.xi"></span>

<span id="xvi.xi-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#010.md)<span id="xvi.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xi-p2"></span>**10**. To whom shall I speak, and give
warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear *is* uncircumcised, and
they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the Lord is unto them a
reproach; they have no delight in it.

<span id="xvi.xi-p3"></span>**10**. Ad quem loquar? et quem contestabor

ecce verbum Jehovae fuit illis opprobrio? non acquieverunt in eo (*hoc

ont prins nul plaisir.)

<span id="xvi.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xi-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xi-p6"></span>The Prophet here shews there was no reason
for him to labor any longer in trying to reform the people, for he spoke
to the deaf. He had said before, according to our lecture yesterday,
that God was still ready to be reconciled to the Jews, if they repented;
but now, referring to himself, he says that his words were wholly lost.
Hence he asks a question as respecting a thing strange or unexpected.
*To whom,* he says, *shall I speak? and to whom shall I protest?* He had
indeed, as we found yesterday, exhorted the people to repent: but there
is nothing inconsistent in all this; for he wished, as far as he could,
to secure, the safety of the people. Even God had commanded this; and it
was his will, as it was yesterday stated, that a testimony should be
borne, that it was not his fault, according to what had been taught,
that he was not reconciled to the people.

<span id="xvi.xi-p7"></span>We now then see that the whole passage
harmonizes; for Jeremiah performed his office in trying to find out
whether the people were healable; but when he saw that such were their
obstinacy that it allowed of no remedy, he exclaims as one astonished,
*To whom shall I speak? and to whom shall I protest?* The meaning is,
that the people were so given up to impiety, that the prophets spent
their labor in vain while endeavoring to reform them. And the first
clause he confirms by another, *To whom shall I protest?* He intimates
that they had despised not only what had been plainly taught them, but
also protestations, which possess much greater power. He means that
their wickedness could be cured by no remedies, that they had not only
rejected plain truth and serious warnings, but had also perversely
resisted solemn protestations.

<span id="xvi.xi-p8"></span>*That they may hear,* he says. He intimates,
that though he had faithfully performed his office, yet his labor was
without any fruit, for all the Jews were deaf. Hence he adds, *Behold,
uncircumcised is their ear* This metaphor is common in the prophets. The
uncircumcised ear is that which rejects all true doctrine. An
uncircumcised heart is that which is perverse and rebellious. But we
ought to understand the reason of this: as circumcision was an evidence
of obedience, so the Scripture calls those uncircumcised who are
unteachable, who cast away every fear of God and all sense of religion,
and follow their own lusts and desires. But to be thus called was
greatly disliked by the Jews; for circumcision gave them no common
ground of confidence, since it was the symbol and pledge of adoption,
and since they knew that they were thereby separated from other nations
so as to be called God’s holy people. But the Prophet divested them of
this vain conceit by calling them uncircumcised in heart and ears, for
they had dealt perfidiously with God when they promised to be obedient
to his will.

<span id="xvi.xi-p9"></span>The external sign was of itself nothing,
when the end was disregarded. It was God’s will to consecrate his
ancient people to himself by circumcision: but when they became
satisfied with the visible sign only, there was no longer the reality,
and God’s covenant was profaned. It is the same at this day with respect
to baptism; they who wish to be deemed Christians, boast of it, while at
the same time they shew no fear of God, and while their whole life
obliterates the true character of baptism. It is hence evident, that
they are sacrilegious, for they pollute what is holy. And for this
reason Paul calls the letter \[the outward rite\] of circumcision, a
sign without the reality. (<span id="xvi.xi-p9.1"></span>[Ro
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027)<span id="xvi.xi-p9.1"></span>..md)
So at this day baptism may be called the letter in all the profane, who
have no regard to its design: for God receives us into his Church on the
condition that we are the members of Christ, and that being ruled by his
Spirit we renounce the lusts of our flesh. But when we seek under the
cloak of baptism to associate God with the Devil, it is a most
detestable sacrilege. Such was the stupid presumption of the Jews. This
was the reason why the prophets so often charged them with being
uncircumcised in hearts and ears: “Ye are God’s holy people; give a
proof of this: ye indeed boast that you have been circumcised; surely,
the cutting off of a small pellicle does not satisfy God; shew that your
hearts and ears have been circumcised: but uncircumcision remains in
your hearts, and it remains in your ears; ye are then heathens.”

<span id="xvi.xi-p10"></span>We now then see the meaning of the Prophet,
and also the reason why Scripture speaks so much of the uncircumcision
of the hearts and ears, and it was this, — to prove the Jews guilty of
profaning that sign, which ought to have been a pledge of their
adoption, and to have served as a profession of a new life.

<span id="xvi.xi-p11"></span>It was not to lessen their guilt that
Jeremiah said, *They could not attend* or give ear. If any one objects
and asks, “Ought it to be deemed a crime that they could not attend?”
The Prophet, as I have said, did not extenuate their guilt, but on the
contrary shewed that they were so sunk in their vices, that they were
not masters of themselves; as the case is with a drunkard, who is not in
his right mind; but as he has contracted this vice of intemperance, his
going astray or his ignorance is in no way excusable. So also the
Prophet says, that the Jews could not attend to the word of the Lord,
because they had surrendered themselves up to the Devil, so that they
were become his slaves; as Paul says of those who were without the grace
of God, that they were sold under sin, (<span
id="xvi.xi-p11.1"></span>[Ro 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014.md)<span
id="xvi.xi-p11.1"></span>;) and the Scripture says elsewhere the same.

<span id="xvi.xi-p12"></span>In short, Jeremiah here teaches us, that
such was the habit of sinning contracted by the Jews, that they were no
longer free to do what was right; for the Devil led them here and there
at his pleasure, as though they were bound in his chains. And thus he
sets forth their depravity as hopeless. Even Aristotle, though he is of
no authority as to the power of the will, for he holds free-will, (he
knew nothing of original sin and of the corruption of nature,) yet
allows that those who are otherwise wholly free cannot do what is right,
when they become so hardened in their vices, that intemperance, <span
id="xvi.xi-p12.1"></span>ἀκράτεια, rules in them: for intemperance is a
tyrant, which so subdues all the feelings and senses of men, that all
liberty is destroyed. We now then see what the Prophet had in view: he
meant not that the Jews sinned, because they had not the power to
resist; but because they had so plunged themselves into the abyss of
wickedness, that they had sold themselves as it were to the Devil, who
held them fast bound, and furiously drove them along as he pleased.

<span id="xvi.xi-p13"></span>And this we learn more fully from what
follows; for he says, *Behold, the word of Jehovah has been to them a
reproach; and it has not pleased them,* or they have not delighted in
it; for <span id="xvi.xi-p13.1"></span> חפףmeans to take delight in a
thing. The Prophet now more clearly shews, that the fault was in the
Jews themselves, because they had despised God. Whence then was the
impotence of which he had spoken? Even from their licentiousness,
because they deemed God and his prophets as nothing. Since, then, their
minds were thus hardened so as impiously to despise the truth, it
followed that they could not hear and attend, inasmuch as they were
deprived of all right knowledge. Whence was this? Even because they had
closed their eyes and deafened their ears, and given themselves up
altogether to the Devil, so that he led them into every kind of madness.
In short, he shews at the end of the verse what was the beginning of all
their evils, even because the *word* of God did not please them, that
is, because they had cast aside every care for true religion, because
they were not pleased when the prophets came and offered to them the
favor of God. As then the truth had become unsavory to them, so that
they rejected it, when it ought to have been especially delightful to
them, so it happened that they became wholly stupid and void of all
judgment and reason; and hence also came the uncircumcision of the ears
of which mention has been made.  <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md)
It follows —

<span id="xvi.xii"></span>

<span id="xvi.xii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#011.md)<span id="xvi.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xii-p2"></span>**11**. Therefore I am full of the fury of
the Lord; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the
children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even
the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with *him that is*
full of days.

<span id="xvi.xii-p3"></span>**11**. Ergo indignatione (*vel,* ira)
Jehovae repletus sum (*copula hic ponitur vice illativae particulae,
nisi adversative resolvere libeat,* atqui, *vel,* ego autem) et laboravi

publico, foris,) et super consilium juvenum (<span

id="xvi.xii-p3.2"></span>בחר *est eligere; sed ita vocantur juvenes, qui
sunt in flore aetatis*) similiter: quoniam etiam vir cum uxore
capientur, senex cum pleno dierum.

<span id="xvi.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xii-p6"></span>The prophet here rises higher; for it was
not enough simply to set forth the truth to refractory men, but it was
necessary to stimulate them even sharply, and sometimes to wound them,
for they could not otherwise be roused, so great was their hardness.
Hence the Prophet proceeds in the same strain with what we observed
yesterday; and he declares that he was *full of the indignation* of God.
This may be taken passively and actively, — that the Prophet was
indignant with holy zeal, because he undertook the cause of God, — or,
that he dreaded the judgment, which the Jews nevertheless in no way
heeded. But he speaks here no doubt according to the inspiration of the
Holy Spirit, as though he said, that he did not announce what his own
mind suggested, but what was dictated by the Spirit of God. This
indignation is, in short, to be applied to what was taught, as though he
had said, “If I address you with great vehemence, think not that as a
man I forget moderation, being influenced by wrath; but the Spirit of
God leads and impels me. Whatever indignation then is found in my
language, whatever vehemence and sharpness and menacing, all this is
from God’s Spirit, and not from my own feelings as a man.” It was on
this account that he says, that he was filled with the indignation of
God.

<span id="xvi.xii-p7"></span>What follows confirms this statement; for
he says, that he was *wearied with restraint;* as though he said, that
so great was the impulse of God’s wrath, that it could not be withheld
from breaking out into vehemence. And hence we learn, as I have said,
that the Prophet declares no other thing than that he was not moved by
his own indignation, or by any feeling of his own nature, but that he of
necessity followed where he was led by the hidden influence of God’s
Spirit, lest what he taught might be despised; for the Jews had long
accustomed themselves to use their taunts and to say, that they were not
to be frightened like children. That the Jews then might not thus
trifle, Jeremiah declares, that he was so *filled* with the *indignation
of* God, that he could contain himself no longer, but must denounce on
his own kindred what God had committed to his charge. As we shall
elsewhere see the same mode of speaking, and in more express terms, I
shall proceed without making any farther remarks.

<span id="xvi.xii-p8"></span>He afterwards says, *I shall pour it out,*
etc. He no doubt continues the same subject. He then says, that since he
could no longer suppress the vengeance of God, whose herald he was, he
would now *pour it out,* and that upon *the children,* he says, *in the
streets* He doubtless means by these words that there was nothing pure
among the people, for the very children were involved in the same guilt.
Since, then, impiety so prevailed that even children in their tender age
were not exempt from it, it was an evidence of a hopeless condition.
This is what the Prophet means by saying, that he would pour wrath upon
children. Then he adds, *upon the assembly,* etc. The word <span
id="xvi.xii-p8.1"></span>סוד*, sud,* means a congregation, or an
assembly; and it means also counsel. But as the Prophet speaks of
streets, there seems to be a contrast between streets and counsels, as
though he said, that children playing in the streets were without any
counsel or understanding: but still I include with them the old and the
grown up men, for they are all exposed to God’s judgment. He then adds,
*the counsel of young men;* for there is more discretion and prudence in
young men grown up to maturity. The Hebrews do not call youths of
fifteen <span id="xvi.xii-p8.2"></span>בחורים*, bachurim,* but men of
full and mature age; and the word is derived from a verb which means to
choose. They then who are in the flower of their age are called <span
id="xvi.xii-p8.3"></span>בחורים, *bachurim,* because they are endued
with discretion, and do not play in the streets like children. The
Prophet then says, that God’s wrath would now be poured forth on
children, and also on men grown up to the age of twenty or thirty.

<span id="xvi.xii-p9"></span>*For the husband,* he says, *with his wife
shall be taken, the aged with the full of days* Some think that the
*full of days* was the decrepit: but by <span
id="xvi.xii-p9.1"></span>זקן, *zaken,* I understand the aged, and by the
full of days, all those already grown into maturity, as those from fifty
to eighty may be so called. He means, in short, that no one would be
exempt from suffering God’s vengeance, as impiety had pervaded all
stations, ranks, and ages.  <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) It
follows —

<span id="xvi.xiii"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#012.md)<span id="xvi.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiii-p2"></span>**12**. And their houses shall be turned
unto others, *with their* fields and wives together: for I will stretch
out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord

<span id="xvi.xiii-p3"></span>**12**. Et volventur (*quasi per
circuitum, haec est propria significatio,* vertentur) domus eorum ad
alienos, agri et uxores similiter; quia extendam manum meam super

<span id="xvi.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xiii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiii-p6"></span>One kind of vengeance only he mentions, —
that the Jews would be deprived of their land, which they thought would
ever remain in peace to them. Inasmuch as it had been said,

<span id="xvi.xiii-p7"></span>“This is my rest for ever, here will I
dwell,” (<span id="xvi.xiii-p7.1"></span>[Ps
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md)<span
id="xvi.xiii-p7.1"></span>)

<span id="xvi.xiii-p8"></span>they imagined that they could not be
driven out of it: and they entertained the thought, that their dwelling
in the land of Canaan was as certain as that of the sun and moon in the
heavens. As then they deceived themselves by this foolish confidence,
the Prophet says, that there would be a change, that God would transfer
their houses to foreign nations.

<span id="xvi.xiii-p9"></span>He then mentions their *fields* and their
*wives* All this seemed incredible to the Jews: but it was necessary to
denounce on them so dreadful a vengeance, that they might at length be
awaked. And then he subjoins the reason why: *For* God will extend his
hand. The Prophet here reprobates their obstinacy, because it made God
their enemy; as though he had said, that there was no cause for them to
think that the possession of the land would be undisturbed, for God was
offended with them. Whence, indeed, did the possession of the land come
to them, except from God’s gratuitous favor? Now, if God was adverse to
them, what hope remained for them? We now, then, see that the Prophet at
the end of the verse mentions the cause, that the Jews might know that
what he said of the transfer of their houses, lands, and wives to others
was not incredible. It follows —

<span id="xvi.xiv"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiv-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#013.md)<span id="xvi.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiv-p2"></span>**13**. For from the least of them even
unto the greatest of them every one *is* given to covetousness; and from
the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.

<span id="xvi.xiv-p3"></span>**13**. Quia a parvo eorum usque ad magnum
eorum omnis (*vel,* quilibet) con cupiscit cupiditatem (*hoc est,*
cupidus est lucri, *vel,* addictus avaritiae;) et a propheta usque ad
sacerdotem quilibet operatur mendacium (*hoc est,* fraudulenter agit.)

<span id="xvi.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xiv-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiv-p6"></span>The Prophet now again declares, that it was
nothing strange that God resolved to deal with so much severity with
that people, and to execute on them extreme vengeance; for no part was
whole and sound, but impiety had pervaded all ranks. It might, indeed,
be ascribed to the young, as well as to the old, for he says, *From the
small to the great;* but I prefer to understand the first clause of the
poor and the lower orders, and the second of the higher ranks, who
excelled in power and wealth among the people. He says, then, that
contempt of God and every kind of wickedness prevailed, not only in one
part but in the whole community, so that there was no soundness from the
head to the soles of the feet. We now, then, perceive what the Prophet
means by saying, *From the small to the great*  <span
id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md)

<span id="xvi.xiv-p8"></span>And this appears still clearer from the end
of the verse, where he says, *From the prophet to the priest* He
amplifies here what he had said of the small and the great. Hence we
see, that by the great he understands not those of mature or advanced
age, but such as were in dignity and honor, who were in esteem on
account of their wealth or of other endowments. So also, on the other
hand, he does not call those *small* who were young, but such as were
despised, who were of the lowest order, and formed as it were the dregs
of society: for as I have said, he amplifies what he had said, by
adducing the prophets and the priests. Even though the king and his
court were extremely wicked, yet some care for religion ought to have
prevailed among the prophets and the priests; there ought at least to
have been among them some decency; for they were appointed for the
purpose of carrying light for others. As, then, even these were
apostates, and had degenerated from the true worship of God, what could
have been found among the rest of the people?

<span id="xvi.xiv-p9"></span>We now, then, see that the mouth of the
ungodly was here closed, so that they could not expostulate with God or
blame his severity, for they had all arrived at the highest pitch of
impiety, inasmuch as the prophets and the priests were no less corrupt
than the common people.

<span id="xvi.xiv-p10"></span>By saying that all *coveted covetousness,*
he refers to frauds and base gain; in that he includes every kind of
avariciousness.  <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) By saying that
the *priests and the prophets wrought falsehood,* or acted fraudulently,
he means the same thing, but in other words, even that there was no
integrity in those teachers who ought to have been leaders to the blind:
for God had ordained them that they might, as I have said, carry light
to all others and shew them the way of salvation. It follows —

<span id="xvi.xv"></span>

<span id="xvi.xv-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#014.md)<span id="xvi.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xv-p2"></span>**14**. They have healed also the hurt *of
the daughter* of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when *there
is* no peace.

<span id="xvi.xv-p3"></span>**14**. Et sanarunt plagam filiae populi mei
super levitate (*hoe est,* super nihilo, de nihilo,) dicendo, Pax, pax,
et non pax.

<span id="xvi.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xv-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xv-p6"></span>This is to be applied to the prophets and
priests alone; they not only corrupted the people by their bad example,
but also shook off every fear of God, and by their impostures and false
boasting took away every regard and respect for the teaching of the true
prophets. He then says, that they *healed to no purpose,* or with levity
or slightness,  <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) *the wound of
the people* He says, by way of concession, that they had healed the
wounds of the people: but it was no cure, when the evil was increasing.
They were like the unskillful, who by rashly applying false remedies,
cause inflammation, even when the disease is not serious; or like those
who are only bent on easing pain, and cause the increase of the disease
within, which is the more dangerous as it is more hidden. This is not to
heal, but to kill. But the Prophet, as I have said, concedes to them the
work of healing, and then states the issue, — that they were
executioners and not physicians. *They have healed,* he says, *the wound
of my people:* He takes the words, as it were, from their mouth, “Ye are
verily good physicians! for by your flatteries ye have soothed my
people: there was need not only of sharp medicine to stimulate and to
cause pain, but also of caustics and of amputations; but ye have only
applied lenients. This is your way of healing! ye have thus healed the
wound of my people, even by plasters and ointments to drive inward the
disease; but what has been the effect?”

<span id="xvi.xv-p11"></span>He then immediately shews what sort of
healing it was: It was saying, *Peace, peace* The evil we know is an old
one, common almost to all ages; and no wonder, for no one wishes
otherwise than to please himself; and what we observe daily as to the
ailments of the body, is the same as to the diseases of the soul. No
sick person willingly submits to the advice of his physician, if he
prohibits the use of those things which he desires: “What am I then to
do? it were better to die than to follow this advice.” And then, if the
physician bids him to take a bitter dose, he will say, “I would rather a
hundred times endure any pain than to drink that draught.” And when it
comes to bleeding and other more painful operations, as caustics and
things of this kind, O the sick man can stand it no longer, and wishes
almost any evil to his physicians. What then experience proves to be
true as to bodily diseases, is also true, as I have said, as to the
vices of the mind. All wish to deceive themselves; and thus it happens
that they wish for such prophets as promise them large vintages and an
abundant harvest, according to what is said by the Prophet Micah:

<span id="xvi.xv-p12"></span>“Behold,” says God, “ye wish to have
prophets who will speak to you of rich provisions and of every kind of
affluence; and ye do not wish them to prophesy evil; ye would not have
them to denounce on you the punishment which you fully deserve.” (<span
id="xvi.xv-p12.1"></span>[Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011)<span id="xvi.xv-p12.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xvi.xv-p13"></span>As, then, the despisers of God wished to be
soothed by flatteries, and reject the best and the most salutary
remedies, hence God has from the beginning given loose reins to Satan,
and hence impostors have gone forth, whose preaching has been, *Peace,
peace;* but to no purpose; for there is nothing real in such healing,
for the Lord says, *there is no peace*

<span id="xvi.xv-p14"></span>The bolder any one is who professes to
heal, if he be unskillful, the more disastrous will be the issue. Hence
the Prophet shews that the cause of the extreme calamity of the Jews
was, because they were deceived by their own priests and teachers. He
does not at the same time, as it has been elsewhere observed, excuse
them, as though the whole blame belonged to their false teachers. For
how was it that the false prophets thus fascinated them? Even because
they knowingly and willfully destroyed themselves; for they would not
receive honest and skillful physicians: it was therefore necessary to
give them up to such as killed them. It follows —

<span id="xvi.xvi"></span>

<span id="xvi.xvi-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#015.md)<span id="xvi.xvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xvi-p2"></span>**15**. Were they ashamed when they had
committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could
they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time
*that* I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the Lord

<span id="xvi.xvi-p3"></span>**15**. An confusi sunt (*vel,* an puduit
eos,) quia abominationem patrarunt? etiam non puduit eos (*hoc est,*
nihil prorsus in ipsis fuit pudoris) etiam erubescere nescierunt:
propterea cadent inter cadentes, in tempore visitationis eorum ruent,
inquit Jehova.

<span id="xvi.xvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xvi-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xvi-p6"></span>Jeremiah turns now his discourse to the
whole people. In the last verse he reproved only the priests and the
prophets; he now speaks more generally, and says, that they had put off
all shame. “Behold,” he says, “they are sufficiently proved guilty,
their wickedness is manifest, and yet there is no shame. Their disgrace
is visible to heaven and earth; angels and all mortals are witnesses of
their corruption; but they have such a meretricious front that they are
touched by no sense of shame.” He means, in these words, that the
wickedness of the people was past all remedy; for they had arrived to
that degree of stupor, of which Paul speaks, when he calls those <span
id="xvi.xvi-p6.1"></span>ἀπηλγηκότας, who were obstinate in their vices,
who saw no difference between right and wrong, between white and black.
(<span id="xvi.xvi-p6.2"></span>[Eph
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#019)<span id="xvi.xvi-p6.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xvi.xvi-p7"></span>This, then, is what the Prophet means when
he says, *Have they been ashamed?* But a question is much more
emphatical, than if it was a simple reprobation or affirmation. They
have not been even ashamed, he says. In their very shame, they knew not
what it was to be touched by any shamefacedness. This may be classed
with those reproofs, by which they had not been subdued; as though he
had said, “Efforts having been made to expose their effrontery, in not
humbling themselves under the hand of God; they *shall therefore fall
among the fallen;”* that is, “I will dispute no longer with them, nor
contend in words, but will execute on them my judgment.” *Fall,* then,
*shall they among the fallen;* as though he had said, “I have more than
sufficiently denounced war on them: had they been healable it would have
availed to their conversion, that they had been so often warned; and
still more, that I have so sharply stimulated them to come to me: but I
will now no more employ words, on the contrary, I will execute my
vengeance, so that the calamity which they have derived may devour
them.”  <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md)

<span id="xvi.xvi-p11"></span>*They shall wholly fall,* he says, *in the
day of their visitation* From this second clause we understand more
clearly what it is or what he means when he speaks of falling among the
fallen, which is, that they should wholly fall, when God would come as
it were with a drawn sword to destroy them, having been wearied with
giving them so many warnings.

<span id="xvi.xvii"></span>

<span id="xvi.xvii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xvi.xvii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as thou
seekest daily to restore us to thyself, and so arrangest thy word, as
now kindly to allure us, and then to reprove us severely, and even to
drive us by threatenings, — O grant, that we may not be altogether
unteachable; but so rule us by the spirit of meekness, that we may
submit ourselves to thee and to thy holy word, and be so terrified by
the fear of thy judgment as yet ever to taste of the sweetness of thy
mercy, so that we may cleave to thee in Christ thy Son, until we shall
at length fully know that thou art our Father, and enjoy the fruit of
our adoption in the same Christ Jesus our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xvi.xviii-p1"></span>Lecture Twenty-Fifth

<span id="xvi.xix"></span>

<span id="xvi.xix-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#016.md)<span id="xvi.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xix-p2"></span>**16**. Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in
the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where *is* the good way,
and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said,
We will not walk *therein*

<span id="xvi.xix-p3"></span>**16**. Sic dicit Jehova, State super vias,
et videte, et inquirite de semitis seculi (*hoc est,* antiquis) quaenam
via sit recta; et ambulate in ea, ut inveniatis requiem animae vestrae:
et dixerunt, Non ibimus (*vel,* non ambulabimus.)

<span id="xvi.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xix-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xix-p6"></span>The Prophet teaches us here that the fault
of the people could not be extenuated as though they had sinned through
ignorance; for they had been warned more than necessary by God. The same
sentiment is found in Isaiah,

<span id="xvi.xix-p7"></span>“This is your rest; but they would not
hear.” (<span id="xvi.xix-p7.1"></span>[Isa
28:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012)<span id="xvi.xix-p7.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xvi.xix-p8"></span>But our Prophet more at large condemns the
Jews; for God had commanded them to *stand in the ways,* to *look* and
to *inquire respecting all the old paths. He* uses a similitude: and we
ought not to doubt respecting the *way,* since it has been shewn to us
by the mouth of God. But the impiety of the people is exposed and
reproved, because they did not so much as open their eyes, when God
shewed them the way and allowed them a free choice: for he introduces
God here, not strictly as one who commands, but as one who shews so much
indulgence, that the people were free to choose the way they approved
and thought best. When God deals so kindly with men, and so
condescendingly sets before them what is useful and expedient, it is the
basest ingratitude to reject such kindness on God’s part.

<span id="xvi.xix-p9"></span>We now then understand the Prophet’s design
in saying, that God had commanded them to stand in the ways and to
consider what was best to be done. Consider, he says, and *ye shall find
rest,* that is, that ye may find rest (for the copulative here denotes
the end) *to your souls*  <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) Here
the Prophet means, that it remained only with the Jews to secure
prosperity and a quiet state; for if they had obeyed the counsel of God,
rest would have been provided for them: in short, he means, that they
were miserable through their own willfulness; for God had set before
them the prospect of a happy condition, but this favor had been despised
by them, and wantonly despised, as these words intimate, *And they said,
We will not walk in it*

<span id="xvi.xix-p14"></span>We see that the people’s perverseness is
here discovered; because they might have otherwise objected and said,
that they had been deceived, and that if they had been in time warned,
they would have obeyed good and wise counsels. In order to cut off this
handle, Jeremiah says, that they from deliberate wickedness had rejected
the rest offered them by God: *they have said, We will not walk* in it.
This resolution deafly shews that they obstinately remained in their
sins; so that the rest, which was within their reach, was not chosen by
them.

<span id="xvi.xix-p15"></span>This passage contains a valuable truth, —
that faith ever brings us peace with God, and that not only because it
leads us to acquiesce in God’s mercy, and thus, as Paul teaches us,
(<span id="xvi.xix-p15.1"></span>[Ro
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001)<span id="xvi.xix-p15.1"></span>,.md)
produces this as its perpetual fruit; but because the will of God alone
is sufficient to appease our minds. Whosoever then embraces from the
heart the truth as coming from God, is at peace; for God never suffers
his own people to fluctuate while they recumb on him, but shews to them
how great stability belongs to his truth. If it was so under the Law and
the Prophets, as we have seen from Isaiah, how much more shall we obtain
rest under Christ, provided we submit, to his word; for he has himself
promised it, “Come unto me all ye who labor and are heavy laden, and I
will refresh you.” And ye shall find rest, he says here, to your souls.
This passage then serves to commend this celestial truth, that it avails
to pacify consciences, so that there is no perplexity nor doubt. It
follows —

<span id="xvi.xx"></span>

<span id="xvi.xx-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#017.md)<span id="xvi.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xx-p2"></span>**17**. Also I set watchmen over you,
*saying*, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will
not hearken.

<span id="xvi.xx-p3"></span>**17**. Et constitui super eos speculatores,
ut attenderent  <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) ad vocem (*hoc
est,* clangorem) tubae: et dixerunt, Non attendemus.

<span id="xvi.xx-p5"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xx-p6"></span><span id="xvi.xx-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xx-p7"></span>This is an explanation of the last verse,
yet not simply so; for the Prophet by a similitude aggravates the
obstinacy of the people, who were not only deaf to the Prophet’s
admonitions, but would not be roused by the sound of the trumpet, nor
even attend to it. The sound of the trumpet ought to have penetrated
into their minds more than anything else for two reasons, — because it
was louder than any voice of man, — and also, because we do not usually
hear the trumpet sounding, except when war is at hand, or when there is
the fear of war.

<span id="xvi.xx-p8"></span>We hence see why the Prophet, after having
announced his message, mentions the sound of the trumpet; as though he
had said, that not only the prophets were despised, while teaching the
people, but that the sound of the trumpet, announcing the approach of
war, was not attended to by them. The stupidity of the people, and not
only their stupidity, but as I have said, their perverseness also, was
more fully proved, than if the Prophet had simply said, that they had
resolved not to hear. It now follows —

<span id="xvi.xxi"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxi-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xxi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#018.md)<span id="xvi.xxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxi-p2"></span>**18**. Therefore hear, ye nations, and
know, O congregation, what *is* among them.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p3"></span>**18**. Propterea audite gentes, et
cognosce coetus quid in ipsis futurum sit.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p4"></span>**19**. Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring
evil upon this people, *even* the fruit of their thoughts, because they
have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p5"></span>**19**. Audi, terra, Ecce ego adduco malum
(*hoc est,* cladem) super populum hunc, fructum cogitationum ipsorum,
qui ad verba mea non fuerunt attenti, et legem meam spreverunt (*ad
verbum,* et legem meam spreverunt in ipsa; *sed non est ambiguus sensus,
quod scilicet vel abjecerint vel spreverint, vel pro nihilo duxerint;
verbum hoc significat rejicere et spernere, significat etiam reprobare;
jam semel hoc usus est Propheta et saepius utetur.*)

<span id="xvi.xxi-p6"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xxi-p7"></span><span id="xvi.xxi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxi-p8"></span>He turns now to address the nations, which
had never heard anything of true religion. But the design of the
apostrophe was, to make the Jews ashamed of their insensibility and
deafness, for more attention and understanding were found among heathen
nations. This was surely very great shame: the Jews had been plainly
taught by the Law and by the Prophets, God had continued morning and
evening to repeat the same things to them, that the nations, who had
never heard the prophets and to whom the Law had not been given, should
still be endued with more understanding and judgment than the Jews —
this was very shameful and really monstrous. Thus the Prophet’s design
was to expose their disgraceful conduct by addressing the nations, and
saying, *Hear, ye nations*

<span id="xvi.xxi-p9"></span>Then he says, *Know, thou assembly* The
words used are <span id="xvi.xxi-p9.1"></span>דעי*, doi,* and <span
id="xvi.xxi-p9.2"></span>עדה, *ode;* and though the letters are
inverted, there is yet an alliteration by no means ungraceful. With
regard to the meaning, the Prophet shews that he found no disciples
among the elect people, for they were like brute beasts or stones or
trunks; he therefore turned to address the nations, as he despaired of
any fruit to his labors among the Jews: ye *nations,* then, *hear, and
know, thou assembly,* (the reference is to any people,) *what shall be
to them* Some interpreters apply this to their vices, and give this
version, “What their state *is, “*or, “What atrocious vices prevail and
reign among them.” But I prefer to apply it to their punishment, though
I do not contend for this view, as there is a probability in favor of
the other. But the Prophet seems here to send for the nations, that they
might be witnesses of the just vengeance of God, because the people’s
impiety had become irreclaimable. “Hear then what shall be done to
them.” He had threatened the Jews as he had done before, and as he will
often do hereafter; but his design in this place was to reproach them
for being so intractable; for he expected that his labors would produce
more fruit among the nations than among them.  <span
id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md)

<span id="xvi.xxi-p14"></span><span id="xvi.xxi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxi-p15"></span>He then adds, *Hear, thou earth* This is
general, as though he said, “Hear ye, all the inhabitants of the earth:
“*Behold, I am bringing an evil on this people* He would have directly
addressed the Jews, had they ears to hear; but as their vices and
contempt of God had made them deaf, it was necessary for him to address
the earth. Now, God testifies here that he should not act cruelly in
visiting with severity this people, as he would only reward them as they
deserved. The sum of what is said then is, that however grievous might
be the punishment he would inflict, yet the people could not complain of
immoderate rigor, for they should only receive what their works justly
deserved. But Jeremiah not only speaks of their works, but he mentions
*the fruit of their thoughts;* for they concocted their wickedness
within, so that they did not offend God through levity or ignorance. By
*thoughts,* then, he means that daily meditation on evil, to which the
Jews had habituated themselves. So then their interior wickedness and
obstinacy are here set forth.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p16"></span>He afterwards adds, *Because they have not
to my words attended, and for nothing have they esteemed my law*. We
ever see that the guilt of the Jews was increased by the circumstance,
that God had exhorted them by his servants, and that they had rejected
all instruction. That they then would not hearken, and that they counted
the law and instruction as nothing, made it evident that their sin could
not by any pretense be excused; for they knowingly and openly carried on
war with God himself, according to what is said of the giants.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p17"></span>We may learn from this passage, that
nothing is more abominable in the sight of God than the contempt of
divine truth; for his majesty, which shines forth in his word, is
thereby trampled under foot; and further, it is art extreme ingratitude
in men, when God himself invites them to salvation, willfully to seek
their own ruin and to reject his favor. It is no wonder then that God
cannot endure the contempt of his word; by which his majesty, as I have
said, is dishonored, and his goodness, by which he would secure the
salvation of men, is treated with the basest ingratitude. He afterwards
adds —

<span id="xvi.xxii"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xxii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#020.md)<span id="xvi.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxii-p2"></span>**20**. To what purpose cometh there to me
incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt
offerings *are* not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.

<span id="xvi.xxii-p3"></span>**20**. Ad quid hoc mihi thus e Sabeis
venit, et calamus bonus e terra longinqua? holocausta vestra non sunt ad
beneplacitum (*hoc est,* non placent, neqne grata sunt,) et sacrificia
vestra non sunt suavia (*aut,* jucunda) mihi.

<span id="xvi.xxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xxii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxii-p6"></span>The Prophet here replies to those
hypocrites, who thought that they made an expiation when they had
offered incense and sacrifices, as though that was all that was
necessary in serving God: and hence we shall hereafter see, that the
Temple had become the den of thieves; for when they sedulously offered
incense every day and performed other ceremonies, they thought that God
was pacified. Thus hypocrites ever mock God with their fopperies and
regard God as extremely cruel, when not satisfied with external display.
This was a perpetual evil, with which the prophets had to contend: and
hence the notion is often found referred to by our Prophet,

<span id="xvi.xxii-p7"></span>“I desired not sacrifices; I commanded not
your fathers, when I stretched forth my hand to bring them out of Egypt,
to offer burnt — offerings to me, but only to obey my voice,”  
(<span id="xvi.xxii-p7.2"></span>[Jer.
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022)<span id="xvi.xxii-p7.2"></span>.md)

<span id="xvi.xxii-p8"></span>So we find in other prophets: the Psalmist
says,

<span id="xvi.xxii-p9"></span>“If I hunger, I will not tell thee,”
(<span id="xvi.xxii-p9.1"></span>[Ps
50:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#012)<span id="xvi.xxii-p9.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xvi.xxii-p10"></span>It is said also by Micah,

<span id="xvi.xxii-p11"></span>“What does God require of thee, but to
humble thyself before him? He seeks not thousands of rams nor thousands
of oxen from thy herds,” (<span id="xvi.xxii-p11.1"></span>[Mic
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007)<span id="xvi.xxii-p11.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xvi.xxii-p12"></span>And we see at this day, that men cannot
be rightly taught, except we carry on war against that external splendor
with which they will have God to be satisfied. As then men deceive
themselves with such trifles, it is necessary to shew that all those
things which hypocrites obtrude on God, without sincerity of heart, are
frivolous trumperies. This is the import of what is here taught.

<span id="xvi.xxii-p13"></span>There is, then, no doubt but that the
Jews punctually offered their sacrifices, and observed the legal rites.
All this might have appeared very commendable; but God gives this
answer, *To what purpose does frankincense come to me from the Sabeans,
and a sweet cane*  <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) (that is,
odoriferous) *from a far country?* Thus the Prophet here anticipates
hypocrites, that he might not leave them — what they might have
objected: for while they spent a large sum of money on their forms of
worship, they thought that God was as it were bound to them: and where
they also bestowed much labor, they supposed that their’ toil could not
be superfluous or useless. And under the Papacy we observe the same
thing: when any one builds a splendid church, and adorns it with gold
and silver and supplies it with rich furniture, and then provides a
revenue for saying masses, he thinks that lie holds in his hands all the
keys of the kingdom of heaven, so that he can push in even against the
will of God. Similar is the madness of the Papists, when they undertake
pilgrimages: when they labor and toil, they think that every step they
take must be numbered before God, and that God would be unjust, were he
not to approve of what is offered to him with so much trouble. Such was
also the conceit of the Jews. As their incense, brought from the
Sa-beans, that is, from the east, even from Persia, was precious, and
cost a considerable sum of money, they wished that this should be deemed
a satisfaction for all their sins; and they looked for the same benefit
from the cane: as the most odoriferous cane was bought at, a high price,
they *expected* that it would be of account before God, and that it
would avail to compensate for their punishment. This is the folly which
God here treats with contempt. “What are they to me, “he says, “your
expenses? I indeed count as nothing all that ye spend in buying incense
and sweet cane.” And then he speaks of the Sabeans and of a far country.

<span id="xvi.xxii-p17"></span>He afterwards adds, *Please me do not
your burnt* — *offerings, and your sacrifices are not acceptable* Under
one kind Jeremiah includes the whole worship according to the law; and
yet it had been divinely appointed: this is indeed true, but for another
purpose. Fasting does not of itself displease God; but it becomes an
abomination to him, when it is thought to be a meritorious work, or when
some holiness is connected with it. The same is true as to sacrifices;
for they who sought to pacify God by victims robbed Christ of his honor:
it was to transfer the favor, which comes from Christ, to a calf or to a
goat: and what a sacrilege was this, and how abominable? When,
therefore, the Jews set such a high value on their sacrifices, they
sought first childishly to trifle with God, as though these were
expiations to pacify him; and then to offer burnt — offerings, to slay
an animal, for pacifying God, was to change his nature; and lastly, it
was, as I have said, to rob Christ of his honor: for expiation is to be
sought by no other means than through his blood, by which we are
cleansed from every stain through the Holy Spirit, who sprinkles it on
our hearts. But when this was attributed to sacrifices, they substituted
the victim, or the ram, for Christ, according to what has been stated.

<span id="xvi.xxii-p18"></span>Now there ought to have been in
sacrifices the exercise of the duty of repentance: but when they became
more and more hardened, and thought that by their ceremonies they
obtained a greater license to sin, and that God required no more from
them, as though they had settled matters with him, they completely
neutralized the design of God: for sacrifices, as it has been already
said, had been enjoined for this end, — that they might exercise
penitence.

<span id="xvi.xxii-p19"></span>We now then see that this answer given by
Jeremiah was not in vain, — that their sacrifices did not please God.
There is a severer language used elsewhere, — that God nauseated them,
that he was wearied in bearing them, that he was constrained to be
troubled with them, while they thus profaned his name. (<span
id="xvi.xxii-p19.1"></span>[Isa
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014.md)<span
id="xvi.xxii-p19.1"></span>.) The meaning here is the same, — that God
never required sacrifices for their own sake, but for another end; and
also, that all external rites are of themselves mere trumperies and
mockeries, nay, a profanation of God’s name; so that they could not
pacify him, but, on the contrary, provoke his wrath. It follows —

<span id="xvi.xxiii"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="xvi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#021.md)<span id="xvi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxiii-p2"></span>**21**. Therefore thus saith the Lord,
Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers
and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend
shall perish.

<span id="xvi.xxiii-p3"></span>**21**. Propterea sic dicit Jehova, Ecce
pono huic populo offendicula, et offendent (*nam sunt ab eadem radice et
nomen et verbum*) patres et filii similiter; vicinus et socius ejus
peribunt.

<span id="xvi.xxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xxiii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxiii-p6"></span>Here God, in plain words, declares what
vengeance he would execute on the people. He says first, that he would
*lay for them stumbling blocks* He no doubt compares the judgments which
were nigh to nets or traps; for the Jews hoped to escape. He therefore
says, that they would be ensnared: “Wherever ye go, “he says, “ye shall
meet with those nets by which God will catch you: *Fall,* therefore,
shall *both fathers and sons, the neighbor and his friend* ”

<span id="xvi.xxiii-p7"></span>He means by these words, that however
they might conspire together, they would yet be exposed to the same
punishment. For when sons follow the examples of their fathers, they
think themselves innocent; and also when any one has many associates, he
thinks himself safe in his licentiousness. As, then, consent or society
hardens the ungodly, so that they fear not the wrath of God, the Prophet
on this account includes sons with their fathers, and a neighbor with
his friend, as those who were to perish together, and without any
difference. The word “stumbling blocks” is indeed metaphorical; but in
the next verse the Prophet speaks without a figure, and says —

<span id="xvi.xxiv"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#022.md)<span
id="xvi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p2"></span>**22**. Thus saith the Lord, Behold, a
people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised
from the sides of the earth.

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p3"></span>**22**. Sic dicit Jehovah, Ecce populus
veniet e terra Aquilonis, et gens magna excitabitur e lateribus terrae:

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p4"></span>**23**. They shall lay hold on bow and
spear; they *are* cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the
sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against
thee, O daughter of Zion.

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p5"></span>**23**. Arcum et hastam (*alii vertunt,*
clypeum) apprehendent; crudeles erunt et non parcent; vox eorum quasi
mare tumultuabitur, et super equos ascendent; erunt dispositi sicuti vir
ad proelium, super to, filia Sion.

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p6"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p7"></span><span id="xvi.xxiv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p8"></span>It was no useless repetition when the
Prophet said so often that *God said.* He might have said only, “Behold,
a nation shall come from the north;” but he premises by saying that he
derived this message from God, and not only so, but he introduces God as
the speaker, that his message might be more impressive. In the former
verse he had also said, *Thus saith Jehovah,* and elsewhere: but he now
repeats the same words, that the holy name of God might more powerfully
rouse their minds.

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p9"></span>*Behold,* he says, *a people shall come
from the land of the north* For forty years Jeremiah ceased not to
proclaim war against the Jews, and also openly to name their enemies: we
yet see that so much preaching was without fruit. This was dreadful
indeed: but we may thus see, as it were in a mirror, how great is our
hardness and stupor, and how great is our fury and madness against God.
He then designates here the Chaldeans as a *northern nation,* and says
that it was a *great nation:* and yet he shews, that the Chaldeans would
not of themselves come; it *shall be roused,* he says. This act is to be
applied to God; for though ambition and avarice impelled the Chaldeans
to lay waste nations and lands far and wide, yet that war was carried on
under the guidance of God himself: he armed and impelled the Chaldeans,
and used them as the scourges of his wrath. We may learn this from the
verb <span id="xvi.xxiv-p9.1"></span>יעור, *iour, “*shall be roused;”
and he says, from *the sides of the earth,*  <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) for they came from a distant country.
But the Prophet means, that there would be nothing to hinder the
Chaldeans from entering Judea, and from destroying and putting to flight
the people, and from demolishing the city and the temple.

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p11"></span><span id="xvi.xxiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p12"></span>He adds other particulars, in order more
fully to render the Chaldeans objects of dread: *They shall lay hold,*
he says, *on the bow and the lance* They who render the last word
shield, do not sufficiently attend to the design of the Prophet. For
there is no mention here made of defense; but it is the same as though
the Prophet had said, that they would come furnished with bows and
spears, that they might shoot at a distance. The word <span
id="xvi.xxiv-p12.1"></span>כידון, *kidun,* means a spear and a lance;
 <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) and it means also a shield: but
in this place the Prophet, I doubt not, means a spear; as though he had
said, “They will strike at a distance, or near at hand.”

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p14"></span>He afterwards adds, that they would be
*cruel,* according to what Isaiah says, when he speaks of the Persians
and Medes,

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p15"></span>“They will covet neither gold nor
silver,” (<span id="xvi.xxiv-p15.1"></span>[Isa
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017.md)<span
id="xvi.xxiv-p15.1"></span>)

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p16"></span>and yet they were a rapacious people.
This is indeed true; but the Prophet meant both these things, that as
the Persians and Medes were to be the executioners of divine vengeance,
they would come with a new disposition and character, despising gold and
silver, and other kinds of spoil, and seeking only blood. *And they will
shew,* he says, *no mercy;* and then he adds*, their voice shall make an
uproar,* or sound, *like the sea* He touches, I have no doubt, on the
stupor of the people in not attending to the voice of God; for the
teaching of Jeremiah had for many years sounded in their ears: Isaiah
and others had preceded him; but the people had continued deaf. He says
now, “Ye shall hereafter hear other teachers; they will not warn you,
nor give you counsel, nor be satisfied with reproofs and threatenings,
but they will come like a tempest on the sea; *their voice shall make an
uproar* ”

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p17"></span>He adds, *Ascend shall they on horses,*
 <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) *and be set in order as a man
for war;* that is, “Thou, Jerusalem, shalt find that thou wilt have to
do with military men.” The Prophet means, in short, that the Jews most
foolishly trusted in their own strength, and thus heedlessly despised
the threatenings of the prophets. But as their security was of this
kind, he says that they would at length really find out how stupid they
had been, for the Chaldeans would come with dreadful violence, prepared
for war — against whom? *Against thee,* he says, *O daughter of Sion* I
cannot proceed further, on account of some other business.

<span id="xvi.xxv"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xvi.xxv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we cease not
daily to give thee occasion of offense, and as thou ceasest not, in
order to promote our salvation, to call us to the right way, — O grant,
that we may be attentive to thy voice, and suffer ourselves to be
reproved by it, and so submit ourselves to thee, that we may continually
go on towards the mark to which thou invitest us, and that having at
length finished our course in this life, we may enjoy the fruit of our
obedience and faith, and possess that eternal inheritance which has been
obtained for us by Jesus Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xvi.xxvii"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxvii-p1"></span><span
id="xvi.xxvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#024.md)<span id="xvi.xxvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxvii-p2"></span>**24**. We have heard the fame thereof:
our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, *and* pain, as of a
woman in travail.

<span id="xvi.xxvii-p3"></span>**24**. Audivimus famam ejus, dissolutae
sunt manus nostrae, angustia apprehendit nos, dolor tanquam
parturientis.

<span id="xvi.xxvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xxvii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xxvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxvii-p6"></span>Jeremiah proceeds in the same strain; for
he sets before the eyes of the Jews the judgment of God, and draws them,
as it were against their will, into the middle of the scene. And this
was done by the prophets, as it has been already said, because by plain
words they could not move the hearts of the people on account of their
contempt of God, and of the long obduracy in which they had settled.
Hence he says, that *heard* had been the *report* of the enemy, and that
immediately *dissolved* had their *hands* When the Prophet spoke, the
Jews did not think that their enemies were so near. But the phrase is to
be thus explained: “As soon as ye shall hear the report, your hands
shall be relaxed, and lay hold on you shall distress.”

<span id="xvi.xxvii-p7"></span>The similitude of a woman in travail is
often found in Scripture; and what is to be understood in most places is
sudden and unexpected pain: but in this place the Prophet refers rather
to the violence of pain; though the other meaning, which I have just
stated, is not to be excluded; for it is probable, that when he saw that
the hardness and obstinacy of the people were so great, he adopted this
similitude, in order to shew, that however heedlessly they despised the
punishment due to them, it could not yet be avoided, as it would seize
them suddenly like that of a woman in childbearing. He afterwards adds —

<span id="xvi.xxviii"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxviii-p1"></span><span
id="xvi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#025.md)<span id="xvi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxviii-p2"></span>**25**. Go not forth into the field, nor
walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy *and* fear *is* on every
side.

<span id="xvi.xxviii-p3"></span>**25.** Ne exieritis in agrum, et per
iter ne ingrediamini; quia gladius hostis, terror undique (*vel*, in
circuitu, <span id="xvi.xxviii-p3.1"></span>מסביב.)

<span id="xvi.xxviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xxviii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xxviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxviii-p6"></span>He confirms the previous verse. For the
Jews, as it has been said, regarded all threatenings as nothing: it was
hence necessary that they should be taught, not by words only, but be
constrained to fear, by having the scene set before their eyes, that
being thus constrained they might at least entertain some fear on
account of the nearness of God’s vengeance. The Prophet then denounces
war, and speaks as though they were already besieged, *Go ye not forth*,
he says, *into the field*, etc., *for the terror of the enemy* and *fear
is on every side;*  <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) not that the
Chaldeans were already laying waste Judea, or that they had even
departed from their own country. But we have briefly explained the
design of the Prophet: he intended thus vehemently to deal with a
hardened and obstinate people, that they might know that he spoke
seriously to them, and that his threatenings would not be evanescent. It
follows —

<span id="xvi.xxix"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxix-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xxix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026.md)<span id="xvi.xxix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxix-p2"></span>**26**. O daughter of my people, gird
*thee* with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning,
*as for* an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall
suddenly come upon us.

<span id="xvi.xxix-p3"></span>**26**. Filia populi mei, accingere sacco,
voluta to in pulvere, luctum unigeniti fac tibi, planctum amaritudinum;
quia repente veniet vastator super nos.

<span id="xvi.xxix-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xxix-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xxix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxix-p6"></span>The Prophet seems to use more words than
necessary; for in a clear matter he appears to extend his discourse too
far: but we must consider the design which has been mentioned; for he
could not rouse the Jews without urging the matter on them with great
vehemence. Known and sufficiently common is the term, “daughter of my
people, “as applied to the whole community. *Daughter of my people*, he
says, *be thou girded with sackcloth, and roll thyself in the dust* It
is doubtful whether the Prophet exhorts them to repent, or whether he
denounces mourning on the irreclaimable and the hopeless; for ashes and
sackcloth are often mentioned, when there is no hope of conversion or of
repentance. However, if this view be approved, I will not object, that
is, that the Prophet still makes the trial, whether the Jews would
return to a sane mind.

<span id="xvi.xxix-p7"></span>*Make thee a mourning*, he says, as for
*an only-begotten* Thus the Hebrews speak of the greatest and bitterest
mourning: for when any one loses an only son, he grieves far more for
his death than if he had many children; for when some remain, some
comfort still remains; but when one is wholly bereaved, a greater grief,
as I have said, is felt by parents. For this reason the Hebrews call it
a *mourning for an only son*, when things are in a hopeless state. He
afterwards adds, *the mourning of bitternesses*, signifying the same
thing; *because suddenly shall come upon us the waster*

<span id="xvi.xxix-p8"></span>If repentance be thought to be intended
here, we know that sackcloth and ashes are, of themselves, of no account
before God, but that they were formerly evidences of repentance when
God’s wrath was humbly deprecated; and hence the prophets often
designated the thing signified by the sign. We must yet remember what
Joel says, that hearts, and not garments, are to be rent. (<span
id="xvi.xxix-p8.1"></span>[Joe
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013)<span id="xvi.xxix-p8.1"></span>..md)
But the prophets assume this principle as granted, that we are not to
deal falsely with God, but with sincerity. Then by sackcloth and ashes
they did not understand false protestations, as it is said, but real
manifestations of what they felt, when really and from the heart they
sought God’s mercy. But as the Prophet seems here to assume the
character of a herald, denouncing war, I know not whether repentance is
what is here meant. So then I rather understand him as saying, that
nothing but extreme mourning remained for the Jews: and hence he says,
that destroyers would *suddenly come* upon them; for they had for many
years so misused the forbearance of God, that they thought that they
could sin with impunity. As, then, they had long indulged this false
confidence, the Prophet made use of this word, “suddenly,” <span
id="xvi.xxix-p8.2"></span>פתאם, *petam* He adds —

<span id="xvi.xxx"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxx-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xxx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#027.md)<span id="xvi.xxx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxx-p2"></span>**27**. I have set thee *for* a tower *and*
a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.

<span id="xvi.xxx-p3"></span>**27**. Arcem posui to in populo meo,
munitionem (*vel*, propagnaculum) ut cognoscas et probes vias ipsorum
(viam ipsorum.)

<span id="xvi.xxx-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xxx-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xxx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxx-p6"></span>The Prophet says, that he was *set* by God
as a *watchtower*, which was also fortified, that he might observe the
wickedness of the people. In order to gain more authority for his
prophecy, he introduces God as the speaker. He had spoken hitherto in
his own person; but now God himself comes forth, and says, *I have made
thee a citadel. Jerome* renders the last word “probation.” The verb
<span id="xvi.xxx-p6.1"></span>בחן, *becken*, means to prove; and
Jeremiah uses the verb in this verse, “that thou mayest prove their
way.” But as the word <span id="xvi.xxx-p6.2"></span>מבצר, *mebezar*,
“fortress, “follows, we cannot take the word here otherwise than as
meaning a citadel or rampart. I therefore have no doubt but that a
citadel for watching is what is meant; as though God had said, that his
Prophet was like a watchtower, from which might be seen at one glance
whatever was done far and wide: for we cannot see far from a plain, but
they who are located high can see to a great distance.

<span id="xvi.xxx-p7"></span>But the word *fortress* is also added: for
it behooved Jeremiah to watch without fear, and not to be exposed to the
threats, calumnies, or clamors of the people. Jeremiah intimates that
two things are required in God’s servants, even knowledge and undaunted
courage; for it was not enough for the prophets to see clearly what was
needful, except they were firmly prepared to discharge their office.
Both these things seem to be included, when he says, that he was *set as
a watchtower*, and also as a *fortress*

<span id="xvi.xxx-p8"></span>Why was he thus set? *That thou mayest
know*, he says, *and prove their way* Let us now see what was the
intention of this. The Prophet no doubt here claims power and credit to
himself, that he might not only freely but authoritatively reprove the
people: for objections, we know, were ever in their mouths, that they
might be at liberty to despise the Prophet’s teaching, as though it did
not proceed from God. This then was the reason why God here declares
that Jeremiah was like a citadel, and that a fortified one; he was made
so, that he might observe and know the way of the people. Hence it
followed, that however obstinately they might defend themselves, it
availed them nothing; for Jeremiah was endued with the highest
authority, even that which was divine, in order to perform his office of
a judge in condemning them: for it immediately follows —

<span id="xvi.xxxi"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xxxi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#028.md)<span id="xvi.xxxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p2"></span>**28**. They *are* all grievous revolters,
walking with slanders: *they are* brass and iron; they *are* all
corrupters.

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p3"></span>**28**. Omnes perversi perversorum
ambulantes in obtrectatione (*dicemus postea de hac voce;*) aes (*aut*,
chalybs, ut *alii vertunt*,) vel ferrum; omnes perditores (*vel*,
corruptores) sunt.

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xxxi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p6"></span>The Prophet now shews what he found the
Jews to be, whose manners and proceedings he had been commanded to
observe. Had he said this at first, either the fury of the people would
have been kindled, or his judgment would have been treated with
contempt: but when God shewed what he had known through his servant, it
had more weight, and then the fury of the people was also repressed,
when they understood that it would avail them nothing to fight against
God.

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p7"></span>He says, that they were *all the apostates
of apostates*, or the transgressors of transgressors. Some read <span
id="xvi.xxxi-p7.1"></span>סרי, *sari*, with a <span
id="xvi.xxxi-p7.2"></span>ש, *shin*, and render the words, “the princes
of transgressors.” But I adopt the first as the more approved reading.
They who read “princes, “elicit a meaning from the words which appears
strange, but not the true one: they say that they were the princes of
transgressors, because the people were no better than their rulers, and
because servants imitated their masters in all kinds of wickedness. But
this, as all must see, is a strained meaning. Why then should anything
be changed, since the sentence, as it is, has a most suitable meaning?
They are then called the apostates of apostates, or the transgressors of
transgressors, <span id="xvi.xxxi-p7.3"></span>סרי סררים, *sari sarerim*
The Hebrews, we know, express the superlative degree by doubling the
word, as, the heaven of heavens, the holy of holies, the God of gods. He
then says, that they were not only wicked, but most wicked, who had
reached the extreme point of depravity. For when impiety reaches its
summit, then justly may men be called the apostates of apostates. This,
I have no doubt, is what the Prophet means.

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p8"></span>He afterwards adds, that they *walked in
slander* The same mode of speaking, if I mistake not, is found in <span
id="xvi.xxxi-p8.1"></span>[Le
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#016.md)<span id="xvi.xxxi-p8.1"></span>,

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p9"></span>“Go not,” or walk not, “among thy people
with slander.”

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p10"></span>Yet this phrase may be otherwise
explained, that is, that they walked in calumnies, or that they
perverted everything. But in this place, the word slander, seems too
feeble, as the Prophet, in my judgment, means more, even the audacity of
the people, so that they allowed themselves every liberty in sinning,
and thus walked in their own wickedness.

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p11"></span>He adds, *Brass and iron*  <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) Many render the words, “Brass mixed
with iron;” that is, that the noble and the vulgar were mingled
together, so that there was a common consent among them. Of this meaning
I do not wholly disapprove: but as it is rather refined, I know not
whether it be well — founded. I therefore prefer to regard this as
designating their hardness: They were like brass and iron, for they were
inflexible. The Prophet then after having called them transgressors who
had alienated themselves from God, and after having said, that they
walked in their own depravity, now adds, that they were untamable, not
capable of any improvements; and hence he compares them to brass and
iron.

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p13"></span>He at last adds, that they were *all
corrupters* This, as I think, is to be referred to their habits: for
thus are enemies called, who plunder everything, and commit all
excesses. But they are corrupters here, who not only like thieves
plunder the goods of all, but who are leaders to others in wickedness:
so that all things were in confusion, as it is wont to be said, from the
head to the feet.  <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) He afterwards
adds —

<span id="xvi.xxxii"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p1"></span><span
id="xvi.xxxii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029.md)<span id="xvi.xxxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p2"></span>**29**. The bellows are burned, the lead
is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are
not plucked away.

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p3"></span>**29**. Exaruit (consumptum est)

*tamen adversative*, non sunt consumpti; *uterque sensus non male
quadrabit*.)

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xxxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p6"></span>He says, that the *bellows* was consumed
by *the fire* and without any advantage. The whole sentence is
metaphorical. Interpreters refer it simply to what was taught; and hence
they consider the mouth of the Prophet to be the bellows, by which the
fire was kindled. So the meaning would be, — that the Prophet was as it
were burnt, through his incessant crying, like the bellows, which by
being continually used is at length consumed, especially when the fire
burns fiercely. They then suppose that the Prophet complains that his
throat had dried up, like the bellows, which being burnt by the fire can
no longer do its work. But what if we refer this to the punishments and
judgments by which God had chastised his people, and yet without
benefit? For so he complains in the first chapter of Isaiah, and in
other places.

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p7"></span>“In vain, “he says, “have I chastised
thee:”

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p8"></span>and Jeremiah has before said,

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p9"></span>“In vain have I chastised my children;
they have not received correction.” (<span
id="xvi.xxxii-p9.1"></span>[Jer
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#030)<span id="xvi.xxxii-p9.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p10"></span>So also it is said by Isaiah,

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p11"></span>“Alas! vengeance must I take on my
enemies,” (<span id="xvi.xxxii-p11.1"></span>[Isa
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#024.md)<span
id="xvi.xxxii-p11.1"></span>)

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p12"></span>but to what purpose? He afterwards adds,
that it was without any benefit, because their wickedness was incurable.

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p13"></span>The first meaning, however, is not to be
rejected, for it was not unsuitable to say, that the tongue of the
Prophet was worn out with constant crying, that his throat was nearly
dried up. But I approve more of what I have just stated. Let each make
his own choice. If we consider prophetic teaching to be here intended,
we may also draw another meaning, — that the Prophet’s mouth was
consumed by God’s terrors; for it was like burning, whenever God
threatened the people with final destruction. The Prophet then does not
without reason say, that his throat was burnt by fire, even the
threatenings of God.

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p14"></span>He afterwards adds, that *the lead was
entire* This sentence rather favors the view, that Jeremiah is speaking
of the judgments by which God sought to humble the people and to lead
them to repentance; for it cannot be suitably applied to doctrine or
teaching, that the lead was unmixt. By lead I understand dross. Some
consider it to be silver, and say that lead was mixed with silver, in
order that the silver might more easily be melted. As I am not skillful
in that art, I cannot say whether this is done or not. But the Prophet
says that the lead was unmixt; that is, that nothing was found but dross
and filth.

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p15"></span>He then adds, *In vain has the melter
melted, for evils have not been purged away;* that is, the dross had not
been removed so as to leave behind the pure metal. He means, in short,
that there was nothing but dross and filth in the people, and not a
particle of pure silver. It hence followed, that they had been as it
were in vain melted. Now, this applies more fitly to punishment than to
teaching, as all must see. I hence do not doubt but that the Prophet
shews here, that the Jews were not only wicked and apostates and
despisers of God, but were also so obstinate that God had often tried in
vain to purify them. And it is a kind of speaking, we know, which occurs
often in the prophets and throughout Scripture, that God is said to
melt, to purge, to refine men, when he chastises them. But the Prophet
says that there was only filth in that people, that lead was found, and
that they were not melted. And hence we learn how great was their
hardness: though they were tried by fire, they yet melted not, but
continued in their perverseness.  <span

<span id="xvi.xxxiii-p2"></span>**30**. Reprobate silver shall *men*
call them, because the LORD hath rejected them.

<span id="xvi.xxxiii-p3"></span>**30**. Argentum reprobatum
(contemptibile) vocarunt  <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) ipsos

<span id="xvi.xxxiii-p7"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xxxiii-p8"></span><span id="xvi.xxxiii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxxiii-p9"></span>Jeremiah concludes his subject by
saying, — that if the Jews had been cast a hundred times into the
furnace, they would not be improved, as they would never become softened
on account of their hopeless obstinacy. He uses the word silver, by way
of concession; for they were not worthy of that name, and we have
already seen that there was nothing soft or tender in them.

<span id="xvi.xxxiii-p10"></span>But the prophets often conceded some
things to hypocrites; yet not without some appearance of a taunt, as the
case seems to be here. The Jews wished to be regarded as silver, and to
appear as such: “Let them then be silver, “that is, “Let them claim the
name, by boasting themselves as the holy seed of Abraham; but they are a
reprobate silver;” according to what we say, *Faux or faux argent;*
which yet is neither silver nor gold; but the words are used not in
their strict meaning, and we afterwards shew that what we have so called
is not silver. Even so does the Prophet say, “They are silver in their
own esteem, and take pride in the title: but they are a *reprobate
silver*.” How so? *For Jehovah has rejected them* He shews that it
belongs to God to pronounce sentence on men, and that they gain nothing
by their vain flatteries, and by securing some esteem in the world: for
God alone is the true judge. The Prophet then shews that the Jews were a
reprobate silver, in order that they might know that they in vain
gloried, while they boasted themselves to be God’s people and heritage.

id="xvi.ii-p8.1"></span>[Jer 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md)<span
id="xvi.ii-p8.1"></span>. The meaning of the verb is, no doubt, to
haste, or to hasten. It is singular that the *Septuagint* render it in
<span id="xvi.ii-p8.2"></span>[Jer
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#006.md)<span id="xvi.ii-p8.2"></span>,
“Haste ye,” and here, “Be ye strong.” The *Targum* renders it “migrate,”
or, remove ye. The idea of assembling it never has. The line rightly
rendered is, —

<span id="xvi.ii-p9"></span>Hasten, ye sons of Benjamin, from the midst
of Jerusalem.

<span id="xvi.ii-p10"></span>Where *Blayney* got the phrase, “Retire in

<span id="xvi.ii-p12"></span> “Raise ye a sign (<span
id="xvi.ii-p12.1"></span>σήμειον)” is the *Septuagint* and the *Targum*;
“Raise ye a banner (<span id="xvi.ii-p12.2"></span>vexillum)” is the
*Vulgate* and the *Syriac*. The word has no connection with “fire,“ as
mentioned in our version, which has been derived from the Rabbins.
*Blayney’s* rendering is, “light up a fire-beacon;” but the words admit
of no such meaning. It is a general expression, and may be rendered,
“Raise ye a signal;” there is no definition as to what the signal was to
be. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_161"></span>[162](cc17015.htm#fr_161.md) <span

<span id="xvi.ii-p14"></span> Literally, “For evil is seen from the
north.” So the *Vulgate* and the *Targum*. The verb in Kal, Niphal, and
Hiphil, is rendered “look” in our version. See <span
id="xvi.ii-p14.1"></span>[Ge

26:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#015.md)<span id="xvi.ii-p14.3"></span>.
But in Niphal, as it is found here, it may be rendered passively, “is
seen;” and also in <span id="xvi.ii-p14.4"></span>[Ps
85:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#012.md)<span id="xvi.ii-p14.4"></span>;
and in <span id="xvi.ii-p14.5"></span>[So
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/sol006.htm#010.md)<span id="xvi.ii-p14.5"></span>,
and in most other places. *Blayney* renders it, “is seen coming
onwards,“ which is a paraphrase. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[163](cc17015.htm#fr_162.md) <span
id="xvi.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p11"></span> *Calvin*, with our version, has followed
the *Vulgate* and the *Syriac* in this verse. Both the *Septuagint* and
the *Targum* are widely different. The former have, “And taken away
shall be thy height, daughter of Sion;” the latter, “Fair and delicate,
how hast thou corrupted thy ways? Therefore confounded is the assembly
of Sion.” The *Arabic* is the same with the *Septuagint*, only it has
“pride” instead of “height” (<span id="xvi.iii-p11.1"></span>τοὕψος)
Some have viewed the two first words as substantives, and have rendered
the verse thus, —

<span id="xvi.iii-p12"></span>To a pasture and a delightful habitation
Have I likened the daughter of Sion.

<span id="xvi.iii-p13"></span>Disposed to this view were *Gataker* and
*Lowth*. But what *Blayney* has said is true, that whenever the verb
here used has the sense of likeness, it is followed by a preposition.
Besides, the two first words are not substantives but adjectives, as the
form, especially of the last, clearly shews. The verb <span
id="xvi.iii-p13.1"></span> דמיתיhas in various passages the sense of
thinking, counting, esteeming, regarding; as the result of comparing
things together. See <span id="xvi.iii-p13.2"></span>[Jud
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#005.md)<span id="xvi.iii-p13.2"></span>;

<span id="xvi.iii-p13.4"></span>[Ps
48:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#009.md)<span id="xvi.iii-p13.4"></span>.
There is a passage in <span id="xvi.iii-p13.5"></span>[Eze
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md)<span id="xvi.iii-p13.5"></span>,
which is like the present, only the verb there is in Niphal; its literal
rendering I consider to be the following: “The young lion of the nations
art thou deemed,“ or, thought to be. The literal rendering of this verse
is as follows, —

<span id="xvi.iii-p14"></span>Home-resident and delicate,  
Have I deemed the daughter of Sion.

<span id="xvi.iii-p15"></span>She was so regarded by God. Not like other
nations, migratory, she had a home allotted to her by God himself; and
she was nursed and sustained with all tenderness, like a delicate
person. But owing to her sins, foreigners, as stated in the next verse,
would come and take possession of her house, and deprive her of her
enjoyments. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[164](cc17015.htm#fr_163.md) <span
id="xvi.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p18"></span> There is evidently a <span
id="xvi.iii-p18.1"></span> וor a <span id="xvi.iii-p18.2"></span>י
wanted before the second verb in this verse. The *Septuagint* and the
*Syriac* read with <span id="xvi.iii-p18.3"></span>ו, and the *Targum*
with <span id="xvi.iii-p18.4"></span>י. The same is the case with the
third verb, <span id="xvi.iii-p18.5"></span>רעו; but there are two MSS.
which have the <span id="xvi.iii-p18.6"></span> וhere, with which the
*Septuagint*, the *Syriac*, and the *Targum* agree. Then the version
would be, —

<span id="xvi.iii-p19"></span>To her shall come shepherds and their
flocks, And pitch by her their tents around, And they shall feed, every
one in his border.

<span id="xvi.iii-p20"></span>“To pitch against her” seems improper: the
proposition <span id="xvi.iii-p20.1"></span> עלmeans *by* or *near*, as
well as *against*. And <span id="xvi.iii-p20.2"></span> ידdoes not mean
properly *place*, but *side* or *border*. It is indeed rendered *place*
often in our version. See <span id="xvi.iii-p20.3"></span>[Nu
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/num002.htm#017.md)<span id="xvi.iii-p20.3"></span>;

and in <span id="xvi.iii-p20.6"></span>[Isa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#008.md)<span id="xvi.iii-p20.6"></span>,
“quarter.” The ancient versions differ; the word seems not to have been
understood. It is rendered by the *Septuagint*, “by his hand;” by the
*Vulgate*, “those under his hand;” and by the *Targum*, “his neighbor.”
— *Ed*

<span id="fn_164"></span>[165](cc17015.htm#fr_164.md) <span
id="xvi.iv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p13"></span> These two verses seem to have been the
language of the enemies on their march towards Jerusalem. When men go to
a chief city from any quarter, it is always ascending. When on their
march, they encouraged one another to ascend by mid-day, as <span
id="xvi.iv-p13.1"></span>ב may be rendered, but the day declined before
they reached the city; then they encouraged each other to continue their
march in the night, —

<span id="xvi.iv-p14"></span>Proclaim ye against her war: Rise, and let
us ascend by mid-day. — Alas for us! for declined has the day, For
extended have become the shadows of the evening: Arise, and let us
ascend by night, And destroy her palaces.

<span id="xvi.iv-p15"></span>The last word is rendered “foundations” by
the *Septuagint*, — “houses” by the *Vulgate*, — and “palaces” by the
*Targum*. This is an instance of the loose way in which the versions
were often made.

<span id="xvi.iv-p16"></span>To “sanctify war,“ is not to prepare it,
but to proclaim it, as *Calvin* says, by a solemn ceremony. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[166](cc17015.htm#fr_165.md) <span
id="xvi.v-p10.2"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p11"></span> The two last lines may be thus rendered, —

<span id="xvi.v-p12"></span>She, the city, to be visited *is* the whole
of it:  
Oppression is in the midst of it.

<span id="xvi.v-p13"></span>The verb <span id="xvi.v-p13.1"></span>
הפקדis an infinite Niphal. Some, not perhaps without reason, have
rendered the first line,

<span id="xvi.v-p14"></span>“For thus has Jehovah of hosts said.”

<span id="xvi.v-p15"></span> — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[167](cc17015.htm#fr_166.md) <span
id="xvi.vi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vi-p9"></span> The verse, literally rendered, is as
follows: —

<span id="xvi.vi-p10"></span>**7.** As cast forth does a spring its
waters, So cast forth is her wickedness: Violence and plunder are heard
of in her; Before me continually *are* wounding and smiting.

<span id="xvi.vi-p11"></span>The first verb is in Hiphil, the second is
in Huphal. “Violence” was the visible act; “plunder” or spoiling was the
object or the motive; “wounding” was the effect; “smiting” was the
cause. Such is often found to be the way of stating things observed by
the Prophets.

<span id="xvi.vi-p12"></span>*Blayney* renders the two last words
“sickness and smiting,“ and adds, that the two words are a Hendiadis,
and signify “sickness occasioned by blows.” The true reason for the
order is what has been stated: it is according to what is commonly done
in Scripture; what is found often is not the progressive, but the
retrogressive order.

<span id="xvi.vi-p13"></span>The *Septuagint* and the *Targum* have
strangely rendered this verse in a manner wholly inconsistent with the
context; nor are the other versions much better. The Hebrew is plain
enough. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[168](cc17015.htm#fr_167.md) <span
id="xvi.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p9"></span> Or, “Be warned,“ or, “Be reformed.” The
verb in Niphal is found in four other places, <span
id="xvi.vii-p9.1"></span>[Le
26:23](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#023.md)<span id="xvi.vii-p9.1"></span>;
<span id="xvi.vii-p9.2"></span>[Ps
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#010.md)<span id="xvi.vii-p9.2"></span>;
<span id="xvi.vii-p9.3"></span>[Pr
29:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#019.md)<span id="xvi.vii-p9.3"></span>;
<span id="xvi.vii-p9.4"></span>[Jer
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018.md)<span id="xvi.vii-p9.4"></span>,
and rendered reformed, instructed, corrected, and chastised. It is the
same as to receive correction and to become reformed. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[169](cc17015.htm#fr_168.md) <span
id="xvi.vii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p12"></span> Or, “Lest forced shall be my soul from
thee.” The verb means to drive, to thrust, to force. To “depart,“ as
rendered by the ancient versions, and by our version, is too weak, and
is not the idea; and still worse is “alienated,“ as rendered by
*Blayney*. It intimates God’s unwillingness, as it were, to give up his
chosen people, according to what *Calvin* observes. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[170](cc17015.htm#fr_169.md) <span
id="xvi.viii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.viii-p9"></span> *Blayney’s* version is, —

<span id="xvi.viii-p10"></span>Turn again thine hand, like a
grape-gatherer, unto the baskets.

<span id="xvi.viii-p11"></span>“That is, Take thou again into thine
hand, and begin the work of gathering or gleaning anew.” He takes it as
God’s address to the Chaldeans, in which they are exhorted repeatedly to
return and to carry away captives the remaining inhabitants. But this
does not comport with the simile of the vintager returning the hand to
the baskets. It seems to be a command to put in safe custody those whom
they took or gleaned, as a vintager, who, when he plucks a grape or a
cluster, puts it safely in a basket to be carried away. The “hand” is
put here for what the hand holds-the grapes or clusters. It is then the
same as though he had said, “Lay up, as a vintager, what you glean, in
baskets.” The Jews were gathered, not to be destroyed, but to be carried
away into captivity. This seems to have been the intimation here, —

<span id="xvi.viii-p12"></span>Return thine hand, like a vintager, unto
the baskets.

<span id="xvi.viii-p13"></span>That is, Throw not away what you gather,
but let the hand, that is stretched forth to reach the grapes, bring
back what it gleans into the baskets. The *Vulgate* is, “Turn (<span
id="xvi.viii-p13.1"></span>converte) thine hand as a vintager to his
basket.” The *Septuagint*. “Turn ye (<span
id="xvi.viii-p13.2"></span>ἐπιστρέψατε) as a vintager to his basket.”
The *Syriac* is the same with the *Vulgate*, except that it has
“gleaning” instead of “basket.” The *Arabic* corresponds with the
*Septuagint*. The *Targum* has an unintelligible paraphrase. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_170"></span>[171](cc17015.htm#fr_170.md) <span
id="xvi.xi-p13.2"></span>

<span id="xvi.xi-p14"></span> This is a remarkable verse, and shews, as
*Calvin* explains, the degraded and corrupt state of the nation in a
very striking manner, —

<span id="xvi.xi-p15"></span>To whom shall I speak, And protest, so that
they will hear? Behold, uncircumcised is their ear, So that they cannot
hearken; Behold, the word of Jehovah Has become to them a reproach, They
delight not in it.

<span id="xvi.xi-p16"></span>“A reproach” is to be the subject of
reproach: the word of God by his prophets was despised and treated with
contempt. This was the visible and palpable effect, but the cause was,
that they had no delight in it or love for it.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[172](cc17015.htm#fr_171.md) <span
id="xvi.xii-p9.2"></span>

<span id="xvi.xii-p10"></span> There are two or three points in this
verse differently explained. The fury or indignation of Jehovah has been
viewed as the message which the Prophet had to deliver, which strongly
expressed God’s displeasure. See <span id="xvi.xii-p10.1"></span>[Jer
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#009.md)<span id="xvi.xii-p10.1"></span>,
and <span id="xvi.xii-p10.2"></span>[Jer
20:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#009.md)<span id="xvi.xii-p10.2"></span>.
The verb for pouring forth is either in the imperative or in the
infinitive mood. The *Vulgate* and the *Syriac* render it as an
imperative; but the *Septuagint,* the *Targum,* and the *Arabic* give
it, as in our version, in the future indicative, the first person.
*Venema* follows the *Vulgate*: but *Blayney* takes it to be in the
imperative mood; which seems most consistent with the whole of the
passage. The view of most as to “the old” and “the full of years” is,
that the first is mature old age, and that the second is the last stage
of life, the age of decrepitude. The full of days is “one” as *Blayney*
says, “who has arrived at the full period of human life;” and hence
“Abraham, Isaac, David, and Job are said to have died *full of years,*
or of days.” See <span id="xvi.xii-p10.3"></span>[Isa
65:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#020.md)<span id="xvi.xii-p10.3"></span>.
Though the general meaning is given in our version, yet the more literal
I conceive to be the following, —

<span id="xvi.xii-p11"></span>But with the wrath of Jehovah have I been
filled; I am weary of restraining to pour *it* forth On the child in the
street, And on the assembly of young men also; Yea, both man and woman
shall be taken, The aged and the full of days.

<span id="xvi.xii-p12"></span>It is unusual to have two infinitives
following one another: but the *Welsh* is capable of expressing the
Hebrew literally, —

<span id="xvi.xii-p13"></span><span id="xvi.xii-p13.1"></span>Blinais
ymattal dywallt.

<span id="xvi.xii-p14"></span>Nothing can express the original more
exactly. It is better to say “man and woman, “as *Gataker* proposes,
than “husband and wife;” for the object is to shew, that all, including
every age and both sexes, were to be visited with judgment. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_172"></span>[173](cc17015.htm#fr_172.md) <span
id="xvi.xiv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiv-p7"></span> “From the small of them even to the
great,“ *Septuagint; “*From the less to the greater,“ *Vulgate; “*From
the least of them even to the greatest of them,“ *Targum, Syriac,* and
*Arabic.* The last is the best. The positive degree is often put in
Hebrew for the superlative. See <span id="xvi.xiv-p7.1"></span>[Jon
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#005.md)<span id="xvi.xiv-p7.1"></span>. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[174](cc17015.htm#fr_173.md) <span
id="xvi.xiv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiv-p11"></span> The words literally are “gaining gain,“
rendered in <span id="xvi.xiv-p11.1"></span>[Pr
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#019.md)<span id="xvi.xiv-p11.1"></span>,
and <span id="xvi.xiv-p11.2"></span>[Pr
15:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#027.md)<span id="xvi.xiv-p11.2"></span>,
“greedy of gain.” The *Septuagint* give only a general idea, “performed
unlawful things;” the *Vulgate* has, “given to avarice;” the *Targum*,
“gape after riches.” The prevailing sin of all ranks was covetousness;
and the special sin of the priests and prophets was falsehood: they
taught falsely. The verse may be thus rendered, —

<span id="xvi.xiv-p12"></span>For from the least of them to the greatest
of them, His all *is* to gain;  
And from the prophet to the priest, His all *is* to act falsely.

<span id="xvi.xiv-p13"></span>“His all” means all his object, or all
that he did. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[175](cc17015.htm#fr_174.md) <span
id="xvi.xv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xv-p7"></span> The words <span id="xvi.xv-p7.2"></span>על
נקלה — “with what is worthless,“ or base, or contemptible, are rendered,
“<span id="xvi.xv-p7.3"></span>ἐξουθενοῦντες — regarding as nothing,” or
despising, by the *Septuagint; “*<span id="xvi.xv-p7.4"></span>cum
ignominia — with reproach” or contempt, by the *Vulgate* and *Arabic;
“*<span id="xvi.xv-p7.5"></span>illusione — by illusion,” by the
*Syriac;* and “with false words,“ by the *Targum.* The same phrase
occurs in <span id="xvi.xv-p7.6"></span>[Jer
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#011.md)<span id="xvi.xv-p7.6"></span>.
The whole verse is there omitted by the *Septuagint;* the *Vulgate* has
“<span id="xvi.xv-p7.7"></span>ad ignominiam — to reproach;” the
*Arabic, “*<span id="xvi.xv-p7.8"></span>in jocos — for sport; the
*Syriac, “*<span id="xvi.xv-p7.9"></span>nugis — with trifles;” but the
*Targum* is the same as here. None give the same version but the last.
In the Complutensian Edition, which has this verse in <span
id="xvi.xv-p7.10"></span>[Jer
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#011.md)<span id="xvi.xv-p7.10"></span>,
the Greek version is evidently a version of the *Vulgate.*

<span id="xvi.xv-p8"></span>The idea of “slightly,“ or “superficially,“
as rendered by *Blayney,* is not countenanced by any of the foregoing
versions, nor can the original words bear this meaning. The word <span
id="xvi.xv-p8.1"></span>נקלה, is found as a Niphal participle, and
applied to man, as a despised, contemptible, or worthless being, — <span
id="xvi.xv-p8.2"></span>[1Sa
18:23](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#023.md)<span id="xvi.xv-p8.2"></span>;

<span id="xvi.xv-p8.5"></span>[Isa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md)<span id="xvi.xv-p8.5"></span>.
But here it refers to the means used for healing, which, according to
all the versions, was something contemptible, worthless, useless, and
which is afterwards named, being no more than saying, Peace, peace, when
in fact there was no peace.

<span id="xvi.xv-p9"></span>And healed have they the bruise Of the
daughter of my people with what is worthless, Saying, “Peace, peace;”
and there was no peace.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[176](cc17015.htm#fr_175.md) <span
id="xvi.xvi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xvi-p8"></span> The *Syriac* is the only version that puts
the first verb in an interrogatory form. “They have been confounded,“ is
the *Septuagint* and *Vulgate;* and similar is the rendering of the
*Arabic* and the *Targum*. The verb, taken literally, it being in
Huphal, may be rendered, “They have been put to shame,“ or have been
made to be ashamed; that is, they had been exposed to shame; but this
shame they felt not, according to what follows. Their previous evils
were enough to make them feel ashamed; but they had not that effect:
hence entire ruin is denounced on them at the end of the verse. The
rendering of the whole is as follows, —

<span id="xvi.xvi-p9"></span>**15.** Exposed to shame have they been,
Because abomination have they wrought: Neither with shame are they
ashamed, Nor how to be abashed do they know; Therefore fall shall they
with the fallen; At the time when I shall visit them, They shall perish,
saith Jehovah.

<span id="xvi.xvi-p10"></span>There is no necessity to make this verse
and the 12th of chap. 8 (<span id="xvi.xvi-p10.1"></span>[Jer
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#012)<span id="xvi.xvi-p10.1"></span>.md)
the same in every particular, as *Blayney* attempts to do. Both passages
are the same in meaning, with a little variety in some of the words. The
particle <span id="xvi.xvi-p10.2"></span>גם, repeated, may be rendered
by*, either* and *nor.* See <span id="xvi.xvi-p10.3"></span>[Nu
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#005.md)<span id="xvi.xvi-p10.3"></span>.
The verb <span id="xvi.xvi-p10.4"></span> הכליםis an infinitive Huphal.
It is rendered as an infinitive by the *Vulgate. “*They shall perish,“
which is according to the *Septuagint,* the *Syriac,* and the *Arabic,*
is literally, “They shall be made to stumble.” — *Ed*

<span id="fn_176"></span>[177](cc17015.htm#fr_176.md) <span
id="xvi.xix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xix-p10"></span> *Blayney* renders the word for “rest,”
<span id="xvi.xix-p10.1"></span>מרגוע, “restoration;” but his long note
is not satisfactory. It is rendered, strangely enough, by the
*Septuagint, “*purification — <span id="xvi.xix-p10.2"></span>ἁγνισμὸν;”
but by the *Vulgate, “*refreshment — <span
id="xvi.xix-p10.3"></span>refrigerium;” and by the *Syriac* and *Targum,
“*rest — <span id="xvi.xix-p10.4"></span>requiem;” which seems to be its
meaning, especially here, as it stands in contrast with the false peace
promised by the false prophets.

<span id="xvi.xix-p11"></span>The representation is that of travelers,
who, when doubtful as to the right road, are to *stand,* that is, to
stop, to *look,* and also to *inquire.* There were several old paths
before them, but they were to inquire which was the *good way,* and to
walk in it. This was what Jehovah by his prophets had exhorted the
people to do, who had false prophets among them; but they refused to do
so. It is a relation of what God *had* done, —

<span id="xvi.xix-p12"></span>Thus has Jehovah said, — “Stand ye by the
ways and look, And ask, as to the paths of old, Where that *is,* the
good way; And walk ye in it, And ye shall find rest to your souls:” But
they said, “We will not walk *in it.”*

<span id="xvi.xix-p13"></span>There were many paths of old, or of
antiquity, as there are still; but there was one good way, the way of
God’s word. That the way is old is no proof that it is good. Error’s
ways are as old as the way of truth. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[178](cc17015.htm#fr_177.md) <span
id="xvi.xx-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xx-p4"></span> There are several MSS. which have <span
id="xvi.xx-p4.1"></span>ו before this verb, and such no doubt was the
copy of *Calvin.* But all the versions render the verb as an imperative,
as no doubt it is — *Ed*

<span id="fn_178"></span>[179](cc17015.htm#fr_178.md) <span
id="xvi.xxi-p9.3"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxi-p10"></span> The version of the *Septuagint* is wholly
inconsistent with the drift of the passage. The other ancient versions
are materially according to our version. Several MSS. read <span
id="xvi.xxi-p10.1"></span> ודעוfor <span id="xvi.xxi-p10.2"></span>ודעי;
and this renders the meaning much better. Then <span
id="xvi.xxi-p10.3"></span> עדהis “testimony” as well as “assembly,“
which appears here very much without meaning. The two verses would then
be as follows, —

<span id="xvi.xxi-p11"></span>**18.** Therefore hear, ye nations, And
know the testimony which is against them;

<span id="xvi.xxi-p12"></span>**19.** *Yea,* hear thou earth, — Behold,
I am bringing an evil on this people, The fruit of their own devices,
Because to my words they have not hearkened; And my law, they have ever
rejected it.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p13"></span>The preposition <span
id="xvi.xxi-p13.1"></span>ב is found after the verb, to testify, and is
even rendered *to* or *against;* and coming after the substantive,
testimony, it ought to be rendered the same. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_179"></span>[180](cc17015.htm#fr_179.md) <span
id="xvi.xxii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxii-p14"></span> It is rendered “cinnamon” by the
*Septuagint* and *Arabic*, “a sweet smelling reed” by the *Vulgate,* and
“an aromatic reed” or cane by the *Syriac* and *Targum*. The literal
rendering of the verse is as follows, —

<span id="xvi.xxii-p15"></span>**20.** For what purpose is this *done*
to me? Incense, from Sheba it comes, And the precious reed, from a
distant land: Your burnt-offerings, *they are* not acceptable, And your
sacrifices, they are not pleasing to me.

<span id="xvi.xxii-p16"></span>The reed or cane was dried and powdered,
and formed a part of the incense. The latter is mentioned first, and
then one of its ingredients. Sheba and the distant land are the same.
The same order is to be observed in the burnt-offerings and sacrifices;
the finished act first, and then the previous act of presenting a
sacrifice. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[181](cc17015.htm#fr_180.md) <span
id="xvi.xxiv-p9.2"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p10"></span> The ancient versions render it, “from
the end, or ends, or extremities, of the earth.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[182](cc17015.htm#fr_181.md) <span
id="xvi.xxiv-p12.2"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p13"></span> It is rendered “a spear,“ or a lance, by
the *Septuagint,* the *Syriac,* and the *Arabic;* but improperly “a
shield” by the *Vulgate* and the *Targum.* It is not true that it ever
means a shield. It was a short spear or javelin. “It is evident,“ says
*Parkhurst, “*that this word signifies neither the larger spear nor the
shield, because it is distinguished from both. See <span
id="xvi.xxiv-p13.1"></span>[1Sa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1017.htm#006.md)<span id="xvi.xxiv-p13.1"></span>;
41:45 \[*sic*\]; <span id="xvi.xxiv-p13.2"></span>[Job
39:23](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#023.md)<span
id="xvi.xxiv-p13.2"></span>.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[183](cc17015.htm#fr_182.md) <span
id="xvi.xxiv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p18"></span> Literally it is, “And on horses shall
they ride.” Then the following line is, referring to the nation in verse
21, —

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p19"></span>Set in order *it shall be,* like a man
for war, Against thee, daughter of Sion.

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p20"></span>Then the next verse refers to the same,
the nation, —

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p21"></span>Heard have we the report of it; Relaxed
have become our hands,  
Distress has laid hold on us, The pain like that of one in travail.

<span id="xvi.xxiv-p22"></span>The effect is first stated, the
relaxation of the hands; then the cause, the distress and anguish they
felt. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[184](cc17015.htm#fr_183.md) <span
id="xvi.xxviii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxviii-p7"></span> This is addressed to the daughter of
Sion: hence the verbs are in the singular number. There is no need for
the change which *Calvin*, and also *Blayney*, adopt, though
countenanced by the *Keri*, and some MSS., for the same is addressed in
the next verse, —

<span id="xvi.xxviii-p8"></span>Go thou not forth to the field, And in
the way walk not;  
For the enemy has a sword, Terror *is* on every side.

<span id="xvi.xxviii-p9"></span>“For the enemy,“ etc., literally, “For
sword *is* to the enemy.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[185](cc17015.htm#fr_184.md) <span
id="xvi.xxxi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p12"></span> “Their impudence resembles brass, and
their obstinacy may be compared to iron.” — *Lowth*.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[186](cc17015.htm#fr_185.md) <span
id="xvi.xxxi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p14"></span> This verse and the preceding have been
amended, and for the most part conjecturally, by *Blayney*, and though
with the approbation of *Horsley*, yet with no satisfactory reasons.
That the Prophet was made as it were a fortress, appears from <span
id="xvi.xxxi-p14.1"></span>[Jer
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018.md)<span id="xvi.xxxi-p14.1"></span>:
and there is here an evident allusion to that, though his being made a
watchtower, or a watchman occupying such a place, was for a different
purpose. The two verses I thus render, —

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p15"></span>**27.** A watchtower have I given thee
among my people, A fortress, that thou mightest know and try their way;
Then we are told what he had found them to be, — All of them *are* the
apostates of apostates, Companions of the slanderer; Brass and iron
*are* all of them, Corrupted *are* they.

<span id="xvi.xxxi-p16"></span>“The apostates of apostates,” mean
thorough, confirmed apostates, as “servant of servants” means the
basest: “companions,” etc., is literally, “Walkers with,“ etc. “All of
them,“ clearly belong to “Brass and iron,“ as “they” follows
“corrupted.” The ancient versions are not satisfactory, and the *Targum*
is paraphrastic; but they give the general meaning. “Prover” or
“examiner” is what the versions give for “watchtower.” “Fortress” is
omitted in the *Septuagint*, the *Arabic*, and the *Targum*, and is
rendered “strong” by the *Vulgate* *“*The apostates” is left out by the
*Septuagint* and the *Arabic*, and is rendered “princes” by the
*Vulgate*, *Syriac*, and the *Targum* For “companions of the slanderer,“
the *Septuagint* and *Arabic* have “walking perversely — <span
id="xvi.xxxi-p16.1"></span>σκολιῶς;” the *Syriac* and *Targum*, “walking
with guile — <span id="xvi.xxxi-p16.2"></span>cum dolo;” and the
*Vulgate*, “walking fraudulently — <span
id="xvi.xxxi-p16.3"></span>fraudulenter.” The word <span
id="xvi.xxxi-p16.4"></span>רכיל, “slanderer” is found in five other
places, <span id="xvi.xxxi-p16.5"></span>[Le
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#016.md)<span
id="xvi.xxxi-p16.5"></span>; <span id="xvi.xxxi-p16.6"></span>[Prov.
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/pro011.htm#013.md), [Prov.
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#019.md)<span
id="xvi.xxxi-p16.6"></span>; <span id="xvi.xxxi-p16.7"></span>[Jer
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#004.md)<span id="xvi.xxxi-p16.7"></span>;
<span id="xvi.xxxi-p16.8"></span>[Eze
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009.md)<span id="xvi.xxxi-p16.8"></span>.
In the first three passages it is rendered in our version “a
talebearer,“ but more correctly, a slanderbearer, or, as *Parkhurst*
renders it, “a trader in slander.” It does not mean “a sharper,“ as
*Blayney* thinks. The passages in Proverbs are inconsistent with such an
idea. There is no passage where it may not be rendered “a slanderer,“
except <span id="xvi.xxxi-p16.9"></span>[Eze
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009.md)<span id="xvi.xxxi-p16.9"></span>;
where it evidently means “slander.” — *Ed*

<span id="fn_186"></span>[187](cc17015.htm#fr_186.md) <span
id="xvi.xxxii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p16"></span> The true reading of the third word in
this verse is <span id="xvi.xxxii-p16.1"></span>מאש תם, according to the
*Keri*, many MSS., the *Septuagint* and the *Vulgate;* and <span
id="xvi.xxxii-p16.2"></span> תםsometimes means “consumed.” *Pliny* says
that they formerly used lead to separate the dross from the silver, as
they use quicksilver now. Then the verse is to be thus rendered, —

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p17"></span>Burnt has been the bellows by the fire,
Consumed has been the lead;  
In vain *has been* the melting of the melted, For their evils have not
been separated.

<span id="xvi.xxxii-p18"></span>They had been in the furnace, but the
lead intended to separate the dross from the silver, was consumed, and
the melting did not succeed, for their evils, or their vices, were not
separated from them. Hence in the next verse they are called reprobate
silver. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_187"></span>[188](cc17015.htm#fr_187.md) <span
id="xvi.xxxiii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxxiii-p4"></span> The ancient versions, except the
*Syriac*, render this in the imperative mood, “<span
id="xvi.xxxiii-p4.1"></span>vocate — call ye them.” So also the
*Targum*, and *Blayney* has adopted the same, —

<span id="xvi.xxxiii-p5"></span>Reprobate silver call ye them, For
reprobated (or, rejected) them has Jehovah.

<span id="xvi.xxxiii-p6"></span> — *Ed*.
