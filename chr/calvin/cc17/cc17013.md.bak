<span id="xiv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="xiv.i"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p1"></span>Lecture Fourteenth

<span id="xiv.ii"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p1"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#001.md)<span id="xiv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p2"></span>**1**. If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith
the Lord, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations
out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.

<span id="xiv.ii-p3"></span>**1**. Si reverteris Israel, dicit Jehova,
ad me revertere (*vel,* apud me quiesce;) et si abstuleris abominationes
tuas a facie mea, et non fueris vagus (*alii,* et non migrabis.)

<span id="xiv.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.ii-p5"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p6"></span>The Prophet no doubt requires here from the
people a sincere return to God, inasmuch as they had often pretended to
confess their sins, and had given many signs of repentance, while they
were acting deceitfully with him. As then they had often dealt falsely
with God and with his prophets, Jeremiah bids them to return to God
without any disguise and in good faith. With regard to what is here
substantially taught, this is the Prophet’s meaning; but there is some
ambiguity in the words.

<span id="xiv.ii-p7"></span>Some read thus, “If thou returnest, Israel,
to me, saith Jehovah, “connecting “to me, <span
id="xiv.ii-p7.1"></span>אלי, “with the first clause, then they read
separately “<span id="xiv.ii-p7.2"></span>תשוב, *teshub,* thou shalt
rest;” and so they think that what follows is the repetition of the same
thing, “If thou wilt take away thine abominations from before me, thou
shalt not migrate;” that is, I will not cast thee out as I have
threatened. Others take the verb <span id="xiv.ii-p7.3"></span>תשוב,
*teshub,* in the same sense, (for it is the same verb repeated,) “If
thou wilt return, Israel, return to me.” The Prophet doubtless bids the
Israelites to return to God in sincerity, and without any disguise, and
not to act falsely with him, as they had often done.

<span id="xiv.ii-p8"></span>I have as yet mentioned only what others
have thought; but, in my judgment, the most suitable rendering is, “If
thou wilt return, Israel, rest in me, “*arrete toi,* as we say in
French. *Rest* then *in me;* and then a definition is given, *If thou
wilt take away thine abominations* (for the copulative is to be taken as
expletive or explanatory) *from my sight, and wilt not wander* What some
of those I have referred to have given as their rendering, “If thou wilt
return to me, Israel, thou shalt rest,” I wholly reject, as it seems
forced: but I allow this reading, “If thou wilt return, Israel, thou
shalt rest in me;” or this, “If thou wilt return, Israel, return to me;”
for the difference is not great. The Prophet here evidently condemns the
hypocrisy which the Israelites had practiced; for they had often
professed themselves as ready to render obedience to God, and afterwards
proved that they had made a false profession. Since then deceit and
emptiness had been so often found in them, the Prophet demands here, in
the name and by the command of God, that they should in truth and
sincerity return to him.

<span id="xiv.ii-p9"></span>If this reading be approved, “Israel, return
to me,” the intimation is, that they ever took circuitous courses, that
they might not return directly to God: for it is usual with hypocrites
to make a great show of repentance and at the same time to shun God. If
then we follow this reading, the Prophet means this, “Israel, there is
no reason for thee hereafter to think that thou gainest anything by
boasting with thy mouth of thy repentance; *return to me;* know that
thou hast to do with God, who is not deceived, as he never deceives any:
return then faithfully to me, and let thy conversion be sincere and in
no way deceptive.”

<span id="xiv.ii-p10"></span>But if the verb, <span
id="xiv.ii-p10.1"></span>תשוב, *teshub,* be taken in the other sense,
there would be no great difference in the meaning; “If thou wilt return,
Israel, thou shalt rest in me;” that is, thou shalt hereafter have
nothing to do with idols and with thy perverted ways. Thus the Prophet
briefly shews that the return of Israel would be nothing, except they
acquiesced in God alone, and wandered not after vain objects, as they
had often done. And with this view corresponds what follows, “Even if
thou takest away (for the copulative, as I have said, is to be taken as
explanatory) thine abominations from my sight, and wilt wander no more,
<span id="xiv.ii-p10.2"></span>ולא תנוד, *vela tanud.*” For the vice
which Jeremiah meant especially to condemn was this, — that Israel,
while pretending a great show of religion, yet vacillated and did not
devote themselves with all their heart to God, but were changeable in
their purpose. This vice then is what Jeremiah justly condemns; and
hence I am disposed to embrace this view “Israel, if thou wilt return,
rest in me;” that is, continue constantly faithful to me: but how can
this be done? “Even if thou wilt take away thy abominations, and if thou
wilt not wander;” for thy levity and inconstancy hitherto has been well
known.  <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md)

<span id="xiv.ii-p14"></span>Whatever view we may take, this passage
deserves to be noticed as being against hypocrites, who dare not openly
to reject prophetic warnings; but while they shew some tokens of
repentance, they still by windings shun the presence of God. They indeed
testify by their mouth that they seek God, but yet have recourse to
subterfuges: and hence I have said that this passage is remarkably
useful, so that we may know that God cannot be pacified by those
fallacious trifles which hypocrites bring forward, but that he requires
a sincere heart, and that he abominates all dissimulation. It is
therefore expressly said, *If thou wilt take away thy abominations from
my sight* For hypocrites ever regard display and seek to be approved by
men, and are satisfied with their approbation; but God calls their
attention to himself. It must at the same time be observed, that he
cannot be deceived; for he is the searcher of hearts. It follows —

<span id="xiv.iii"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p1"></span><span id="xiv.iii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#002.md)<span id="xiv.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p2"></span>**2** And thou shalt swear, The Lord
liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations
shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.

<span id="xiv.iii-p3"></span>**2**. Et jurabis, vivit Jehova, in
veritate, in judicio et in justitia; et benedicent se in eo gentes et in
eo gloriabuntur.

<span id="xiv.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.iii-p5"></span><span id="xiv.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p6"></span>Here the Prophet goes on with the same
subject; for he denudes these flatteries, by which they thought that God
could be pacified: for when they had his name in their mouth, they
thought it sufficient for their defense, — “What! do we not call upon
God? do we not ascribe to him his due honor, when we swear by his name?”
There is in the Prophet’s words a part given for the whole; for swearing
is to be taken for the whole of God’s worship. When therefore the
Israelites made a profession of God’s name, they thought themselves
absolved from all guilt.

<span id="xiv.iii-p7"></span>Hence the Prophet says, *Thou shalt swear
truly* in the name of God; that is, “Ye are indeed self — confident,
because an external profession of religion seems to you to be a sort of
expiation, whenever ye seek to contend with God: ye boast that you are
Abraham’s seed, and swear by the name of God; but ye are sacrilegious,
when ye thus falsely profess God’s name.” *Swear* then, he says, *in
truth*

<span id="xiv.iii-p8"></span>We hence see how the words of the Prophet
harmonize together: he had said, that Israel had hitherto dealt falsely
with God, because they had not performed what in words they had
promised, for they went astray; and now he adds, that it availed the
Israelites nothing, that they openly called on God and shewed themselves
to be his people by an external worship: this, he says, is nothing,
except ye worship God *in truth and in judgment and in righteousness*

<span id="xiv.iii-p9"></span>*Truth* is no doubt to be taken here for
integrity, as we shall see in the fifth chapter: it is the same as
though he had said, that God is not rightly worshipped, except when the
heart is free from all guile and deceit; in short, he means that there
is no worship of God without sincerity of heart. But the truth, of which
the Prophet speaks, is especially known by *judgment and righteousness;*
that is, when men deal faithfully with one another, and render to all
their right, and seek not their own gain at the expense of others. When
therefore equity and uprightness are thus observed by men, then is
fulfilled what is required here by the Prophet: for then they worship
not God fallaciously, nor with vain words, but really shew that they do,
without disguise, fear and reverence God.

<span id="xiv.iii-p10"></span>What follows is variously explained by
interpreters; but the Prophet, I have no doubt, does here indirectly
reprove the Israelites, because God’s name had been exposed to many
reproaches and mockeries, when the heathens said, that there was no
power in God to help the Israelites, and when the people themselves
expostulated with God, as though they had a just cause for contending
with him, — “What! God has promised that we should be models of his
blessing; but we are exposed to the reproaches of the heathens: how can
this be?” Since then the Israelites thus deplored their lot, and cast
the blame on God, the Prophet gives this answer, *Bless themselves shall
the nations and glory in him* Some refer this to the Israelites, but not
correctly. It had indeed been said to Abraham, “In thy seed shall all
nations be blessed,” or, shall bless themselves. But this blessing had
its beginning, as it is here noticed by the Prophet. For we must look
for the cause or the fountain of this blessing: how could the nations
bless themselves through the seed or the children of Abraham, except
God, the author of the blessing, manifested his favor towards the
children of Abraham? Very aptly then does the Prophet say here, *Then
bless themselves in God shall all the nations, and in him shall they
glory;* that is, “Ye are to be blamed, that God’s curse is upon you and
renders you objects of reproach to all people, and also, that heathens
disdain and despise the name of God: for your impiety has constrained
God to deal more severely with you than he wished; for he is ever ready
to shew his paternal clemency. What then is the hindrance, that the
nations bless not themselves in God and glory in him? that is, that pure
religion does not flourish through the whole world, and that all nations
do not come to you and unite in the worship of the only true God? The
hindrance is your impiety and wickedness; this is the reason why God is
not glorified, and why your felicity is not everywhere celebrated among
the nations.” We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet, — that the
Jews groundlessly imputed blame to God, because they were oppressed by
so many evils; for they had procured for themselves all their
calamities, and at the same time gave occasion to heathens to profane
God’s name by their reproaches.  <span id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) It
follows —

<span id="xiv.iv"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p1"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#003.md)<span id="xiv.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p2"></span>**3**. For thus saith the LORD to the men of
Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among
thorns.

<span id="xiv.iv-p3"></span>**3**. Quoniam sic dicit Jehova viro Jehudah
(*hoc est,* Judaeis) et Jerosolymae, Novate vobis novale, et ne
seminetis super spinas.

<span id="xiv.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.iv-p5"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p6"></span>The Prophet still pursues the same subject;
for he reproves the hypocrisy of the Israelites, because they sought to
discharge their duty towards God only by external ceremonies, while
their hearts were full of deceits and of every kind of impiety and
wickedness. Hence he says, that God required this from the Jews, — to
*plough again the fallow, and not to sow among thorns.*

<span id="xiv.iv-p7"></span>It is a most suitable comparison; for
Scripture often compares us to a field, when it represents us as God’s
heritage; and we have been chosen by God as a peculiar people for this
end — that he may gather fruit from us, as a husbandman gathers produce
from his fields. We can indeed add nothing to what God is; but there is
a fruit which he demands; so that our whole life is to be devoted to his
glory. God then would not have us to be idle and fruitless, but to bring
forth some fruit. But what is done by hypocrites? They sow; that is,
they shew some concern, yea, they pretend great ardor, when God exhorts
them to repent, or when he invites them. They then make a great bustle;
yet they mar everything by their own mixtures, the same as though one
scattered his seed among thorns: but it will be of no avail thus to cast
seed among thorns; for the ground ought to be well cleared and prepared.
Hence God laughs to scorn this preposterous care and diligence, in which
hypocrites pride themselves, and says, that they busy themselves without
any advantage; for it is the same, as though an husbandman had wholly
lost his seed; for when the ground is full of briers and thorns, the
seed, though it may grow for a time, cannot yet bring forth fruit. For
this reason God bids the Israelites to *plough the fallows;*  <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) as though he had said, that they were
like a rough ground, which is full of thorns, and that therefore there
was need of unusual and by no means a common cultivation; for when
thorns and briers grow in a field, of what benefit will it be to cast
seed there? Nay, a field cannot be well prepared by the plough alone, so
that it may produce fruit; but much labor is also necessary, as is the
case with fallow ground, which is called *essarter* in our language.

<span id="xiv.iv-p9"></span>The Prophet then intimates that the people
had become hardened in their vices, and that they were not only full of
vices, like a field left uncultivated for two years; but that their
vices were so deep, that they could not be well cleared away by
ploughing alone, except they were drawn up by the roots, as they were
like thorns and brambles, which have been growing in a field for many
years. We hence see, that not only impiety and contempt of God, and
other sins of the people of Israel, are referred to by the Prophet, but
also their perverseness; for they had so hardened themselves for many
years in their vices, that there was need not only of the plough, but
also of other instruments to tear up the thorns, to eradicate those
vices which had formed deep roots. As then, he had before warned them,
that they would labor in vain except they returned to God with sincerity
of heart and acquiesced in him; so here he bids them to examine their
life, that they might not cast away their seed, like hypocrites, who
formally acknowledge their sins. Hence he bids them wholly to shake off
their vices, which were hid within, according to what they do, who tear
up thorns and briers in a field, which has been long neglected, and left
without being cultivated. It now follows —

<span id="xiv.v"></span>

<span id="xiv.v-p1"></span><span id="xiv.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#004.md)<span id="xiv.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.v-p2"></span>**4** Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and
take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants
of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can
quench *it*, because of the evil of your doings.

<span id="xiv.v-p3"></span>**4**. Circumcidimini Jehovae, et auferte
praeputia cordis vestri, viri Jehudah et incolae Jerusalem; ne
egrediatur tanquam ignis furor meus, et accendatur, et nemo extinguat,
propter (a facie, ad verbum) malitiam actionum vestrarum.

<span id="xiv.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.v-p5"></span><span id="xiv.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.v-p6"></span>The Prophet expresses here more clearly what
he had before said metaphorically or by a figure; for he had bidden them
to eradicate their vices, according to what is usually done by breaking
up the fallow ground; but now dropping that figure, he clearly shews
what was to be done, and yet the clause contains what is figurative. He
calls their attention to circumcision, which was a symbol of renovation,
as though he had said, — That they sufficiently understood what they
were to do, except they were wholly unteachable; “For why, “he says,
“has circumcision been enjoined? Does not God by this symbol shew, that
if a man rightly aspires after true religion, he ought to begin by
putting off all the evil propensities of his flesh? Is he not to deny
himself, and to die as it were both to himself and to the world? for
circumcision includes all this.” Then the Prophet shews that the
Israelites had no excuse, that they went not astray through mistake or
through ignorance; but they were acting perversely and deceitfully with
God; for circumcision, by which they had been initiated into God’s
service, sufficiently taught them, that God is not rightly nor
faithfully served, except when men deny themselves.

<span id="xiv.v-p7"></span>We now then see what the Prophet meant by
these words, when he bids them to be circumcised to God, and to take
away the foreskin of their heart: *Be ye circumcised,* he says*, to
Jehovah* Circumcision was their great boast; but only before men; for
nothing but ambition and vanity ruled in them, while they openly exulted
and boasted that they were God’s holy and peculiar people. Hence the
Prophet bids them not to value what was of no importance, but to become
circumcised to Jehovah; that is, he bids them not to seek applause
before the world, but seriously to consider that they had to do with
God. And hence he adds, *Take away the foreskin of your heart,* as
though he had said, “When God commanded the seed of Abraham to be
circumcised, (<span id="xiv.v-p7.1"></span>[Ge
17:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#010.md)<span
id="xiv.v-p7.1"></span>,) it was not his object to have a small portion
of skin cut off, but he had regard to something higher, even that ye
should be circumcised in heart.”

<span id="xiv.v-p8"></span>The Prophet, in short, teaches us here what
Paul has more clearly explained, (<span id="xiv.v-p8.1"></span>[Ro
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029)<span id="xiv.v-p8.1"></span>,.md)
even this, — that the letter is of no value before God, but that the
spirit is what he requires: for Paul in these words means, that the
external sign is worthless, except accompanied by the reality within;
for the literal circumcision mentioned by Paul is merely the external
rite; in the same manner baptism with us may be called the letter, when
there is no repentance and faith. But the spirit, or spiritual
circumcision, is the denial of self; it is renovation, and in a word,
that true conversion to God, of which the Prophet speaks here. Nor has
Moses been silent on this point; for in the tenth chapter of Deuteronomy
he shews that the Jews greatly deceived themselves, if they thought that
they did all that God required, when they were circumcised in the flesh;
“Circumcise, “he says, “your hearts to the Lord.” He indeed reminds us
in another place, that this is altogether the work of God; but though
God circumcises the heart, yet this exhortation, that men are to
circumcise themselves, is not superfluous: and the same is the case with
baptism; for when Paul exhorts the faithful to fear God and to lead a
holy life, he refers to baptism. It is yet certain that men do not
bestow on themselves what God signifies by the sign of baptism; but he
counsels them to seek from God the grace of his Spirit, that they might
not in vain be sealed by the external rite of baptism, while destitute
of its reality. When therefore the Prophet bids the Israelites to *take
away the foreskin of their heart,* it is the same as though he had said,
that they were indeed liberal enough with regard to ceremonies and
outward worship, but that these were empty masks unless preceded by a
right disposition within.

<span id="xiv.v-p9"></span>And he addresses the Jews, and also the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, for they thought that they far excelled the
Israelites, on whom God had inflicted so grievous a punishment. He then
shews that the tribe of Judah, nay, that the very inhabitants and
citizens of Jerusalem were not better than others, and that they could
not be exempted, as it were, by privilege, except they returned to a
right mind, except they seasonably and from the heart repented.

<span id="xiv.v-p10"></span>He then adds, *Lest my fury go forth like
fire* The Prophet here expressly declares, that the Jews were not to
wait until God came forth as an avenger; for then, he says, if, would be
too late to repent: in short, he bids them to anticipate in due time the
judgment of God; for if once his fury went forth, it would burn like
fire so as to consume them, and there would be no extinguishing of it.
But if they repented, he holds forth to them the hope of pardon; for the
fury of God had not yet gone forth.

<span id="xiv.v-p11"></span>He afterwards subjoins, *On account of the
wickedness of your deeds*  <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) By
these words the Prophet again reproves them sharply, and shews that they
gained nothing by their evasions; for when God ascends his tribunal and
begins to execute his vengeance, then all vain excuses will come to an
end, such as, that they deserved no such thing, or, that the atrocity of
their sins was not great: “God, “he says, “will, with his own hand,
teach you how grievous has been the atrocity of your vices; he will not,
then, deal with you in words.” It then follows —

<span id="xiv.vi"></span>

<span id="xiv.vi-p1"></span><span id="xiv.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#005.md)<span id="xiv.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.vi-p2"></span>**5**. Declare ye in Judah, and publish in
Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather
together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced
cities.

<span id="xiv.vi-p3"></span>**5**. Nuntiate (*vel,* promulgate) in
Jehudah, et Jerusalem facite audire, (*hoc est,* publicate,) et dicite

<span id="xiv.vi-p4"></span>**6**. Set up the standard toward Zion:
retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great
destruction.

<span id="xiv.vi-p5"></span>**6**. Tollite signum (*vel,* vexilium) in

non stabitis,) quoniam malum ego accerso (venire facio) ab aquilone, et
contritionem magnam.

<span id="xiv.vi-p6"></span> 

<span id="xiv.vi-p7"></span><span id="xiv.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.vi-p8"></span>Jeremiah treats his own people here with
more severity, for he saw that they were refractory, and so obstinate in
their vices, that they could not by wise counsels be restored to the way
of safety. Hence he addresses them here as men wholly irreclaimable, and
to whom instruction proved useless. But though according to the manner
of the prophets, he sounds a trumpet for the sake of filling them with
terror, he seems yet to speak tauntingly, when he bids them to *proclaim
in Judah,* and *to publish in Jerusalem;* as though he had said, When
distress shall seize you, you will then by experience perceive that God
is angry with you: though to — day ye believe not my warnings; yet that
God may not, indeed, by a violent hand, bring you back to himself, and
as ye seek evasions for yourselves, ye shall sound the trumpet, and
proclaim, “The enemies are coming, and are nigh at hand; let, therefore,
every one flee to Jerusalem, and enter into the city, and resort unto
Zion: “that is, “If we cannot secure our safety in the city, we shall at
least be safe in the fortress of Sion.” But God, he says, *brings an
evil on you from the north;* and whatever ye may think will be for your
safety will be wholly useless. It is, however, proper, especially to
regard the Prophet as God’s herald proclaiming war; and that though he
exults over their perverseness, he yet declares that such would be
everywhere the terror, that they would seek safety by flight.

<span id="xiv.vi-p9"></span>*Sound,* he says, *in Judah, and publish,*
or *proclaim*, *in Jerusalem,* (<span id="xiv.vi-p9.1"></span>הגידו,
*egidu,* announce, literally.) He speaks not here for the same purpose
as Joel did, (<span id="xiv.vi-p9.2"></span>[Joel
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#001.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#015)<span id="xiv.vi-p9.2"></span>,.md)
when he bade them to sound the trumpet; for the latter exhorted the
people to repent; but Jeremiah, as I have already said, tauntingly
reproves here the people for their obstinacy and perverseness; as though
he had said, “I see what ye will do, when God’s vengeance shall come
upon you, that ye may not even then repent; for ye will sound the
trumpet through the whole land, ‘Let all resort to Sion;’ as though ye
could resist there your enemies, and preserve your lives.” He does not,
then, bid them to sound the trumpet, but, on the contrary, shews what
they would do.

<span id="xiv.vi-p10"></span>Some improperly give this rendering,
“Fulfill ye, “but the common version is, “Assemble yourselves.” But
interpreters seem not to me to have regarded the etymology of the word;
for it is of the same meaning in Hebrew as when we say, *Amassez-vous,*
Gather yourselves. *And say, Be ye assembled, and let us go into
fortified cities* It will, indeed, be announced to you to seek hiding —
places to protect you from the assaults of your enemies; if so, *Raise a
banner in Sion, and flee;* but God will at the same time *bring evil* on
you *from the north*

<span id="xiv.vi-p11"></span><span id="xiv.vi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.vi-p12"></span>The words <span
id="xiv.vi-p12.1"></span>אל-תעמדו, *al-tomedu,* may be explained in two
ways, — “Stand not,” that is, “Hasten quickly,” as it is the case with
those in extreme fear; or, “Ye shall not stand,” that is, “Though ye may
seek a firm position on Mount Sion, ye shall not yet be able to continue
there.” The first exposition appears to me the best, as it is more
suitable to the context.  <span id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md)

<span id="xiv.vii"></span>

<span id="xiv.vii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xiv.vii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we cease not
daily to alienate ourselves from thee by our sins, and as thou yet
kindly exhortest us to repent, and promisest to be appeasable and
propitious to us, — O grant, that we may not perversely go on in our
sins, and be ungrateful to thee for thy great kindness; but that we may
so return to thee, that our whole life may testify that our repentance
has been unfeigned, and that we may so acquiesce in thee alone, that the
depraved lusts of our flesh may not draw us here and there, but that we
may continue fixed and immovable in our purpose, and so labor to obey
thee through the whole course of our life, that we may at length partake
of the fruit of our obedience in thy celestial kingdom, through Jesus
Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xiv.viii-p1"></span>Lecture Fifteenth

<span id="xiv.ix"></span>

<span id="xiv.ix-p1"></span><span id="xiv.ix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#007.md)<span id="xiv.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ix-p2"></span>**7.** The lion is come up from his thicket,
and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from
his place to make thy land desolate; *and* thy cities shall be laid
waste, without an inhabitant.

<span id="xiv.ix-p3"></span>**7**. Ascendit leo ex densitate sua (*hoc
est,* ex oculto loco,) et vastator gentium profectus est; egressus est e
loco sue ad ponendum (ut ponat) terram tuam in vastitatem, urbes tuae
perdentur, ut non sit habitator.

<span id="xiv.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.ix-p5"></span><span id="xiv.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ix-p6"></span>The Prophet more fully declares the import
of the threatening which we briefly considered yesterday; for God said
in the former verse, that he would *bring an evil from the north;* and
the kind of evil it was to be he now describes, and compares the king of
Babylon to a lion; and afterwards, without a figure, he calls him the
*destroyer of nations*

<span id="xiv.ix-p7"></span>By the similitude of lion he means that the
Israelites would not be able to resist; and when he adds that he would
be the desolator of nations, he intimates that they would perish with
the rest: for if Nebuchadnezzar was sufficiently able to destroy many
nations, how could the Jews escape a similar calamity? *He shall come,*
he says, *the desolator of nations* But he uses the past tense
throughout, in order to shew the certainty of the prediction, and thus
to shake secure men with fear, who had become torpid in their hypocrisy;
for they would have otherwise deemed all threatenings as nothing: for as
long as God spared them, they despised his judgment, and promised
themselves impunity in their sins. Hence the Prophet, in order to awake
them, set the matter before them, as though Nebuchadnezzar had already
come with a strong and powerful army to lay waste Judea; for he says,
that a lion had *ascended from his hiding* — *places:* but the term for
the last word means an entangled density, as when trees are entwined
together, or when a place is filled with thorns.  <span
id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md)

<span id="xiv.ix-p9"></span>But the similitude is most suitable, because
the Jews never thought that the king of Babylon would come forth from
places so remote; for the passing through was difficult, and the
expedition attended with great toil: yet the Prophet says, that the lion
would come from his recesses, and that nothing would hinder him from
breaking forth and coming to the open country. He at last concludes by
saying, that the *cities would be laid waste,*  <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) *so as to be without an inhabitant* It
now follows —

<span id="xiv.x"></span>

<span id="xiv.x-p1"></span><span id="xiv.x-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#008.md)<span id="xiv.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.x-p2"></span>**8**. For this gird you with sackcloth,
lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned back
from us.

<span id="xiv.x-p3"></span>**8**. Super hoc accingite vos saccis,
plangite et ululate; quia non aversus est furor irae Jehovae a nobis.

<span id="xiv.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.x-p5"></span><span id="xiv.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.x-p6"></span>The Prophet seems not yet to exhort his own
nation to repent: a more gracious doctrine will presently follow; but
here he only reminds them that a most grievous mourning was nigh at
hand; for he saw that they were hypocrites, immersed in their own
delusions, and could not be assailed by any fear. Hence he says, that
they were greatly mistaken, if they thought themselves safe while God
was angry with them.

<span id="xiv.x-p7"></span>*Gird yourselves in sackcloth,* he says,
*lament and howl;* and then follows the reason, *because the fury of
God’s wrath was not turned away* from them. We indeed know, that the
ungodly are wont to make God subservient to themselves, as though they
could by their perverseness turn aside or drive afar off his judgment,
and restrain, as it were, his hand from acting. As, then, hypocrites are
insolent towards God, the Prophet says expressly that the fury of his
wrath was not turned away: and thus he warns them, that they would be in
every way miserable until they were reconciled to God.

<span id="xiv.x-p8"></span>We now understand the design of the Prophet;
for he confirms what the last verse contains, when he said that a lion
had come forth, and that a desolator was already nigh; yea, he confirms
what he had said, for there was no hope to them without having God
propitious, and he declares that God was angry. Hence it follows, that
all things would prove infelicitous to them.

<span id="xiv.xi"></span>

<span id="xiv.xi-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#009.md)<span id="xiv.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xi-p2"></span>**9**. And it shall come to pass at that
day, saith the LORD, *that* the heart of the king shall perish, and the
heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the
prophets shall wonder.

<span id="xiv.xi-p3"></span>**9**. Et erit die illo, dicit Jehova,
peribit cor Regis et cor procerum, et obstupescent sacerdotes, et
prophetae mirabuntur (vel, attoniti erunt).

<span id="xiv.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xi-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xi-p6"></span>As the royal dignity still continued with
the Jews, though their power was greatly diminished, they, relying on
that distinction, hoped that they had a sufficient protection: hence it
was, that they were not moved by any denunciation; for the royal power,
which remained not altogether secure, and yet so in some degree, was to
them like a shield. We also know what pride filled the courtiers; for
they extolled their kings, and thus made a show of their prudence and
magnanimity. Since, then, this foolish notion of the chief men
respecting their king, and their delusive boasting, deceived the Jews,
the Prophet says, *In that day perish shall the heart of the king, and
the heart of the princes*

<span id="xiv.xi-p7"></span>By *heart* he no doubt means the
understanding or the mind, as the word is to be taken in many other
places. Moses says,

<span id="xiv.xi-p8"></span>“God has not yet given you a heart to
understand.”  
(<span id="xiv.xi-p8.2"></span>[De
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004)<span id="xiv.xi-p8.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xiv.xi-p9"></span>The Latins also call men “hearted”
(*cordatos*) who excel in intelligence and wisdom.  <span
id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) So, then, the Prophet shews, that it
was a vain and deceptive fancy for the people to expect that the king
would be an invincible defense to them; for “the king, “he says, “shall
then be deprived of understanding and reason; and the counselors, who
lay claim to understanding, shall be found then to be wholly foolish:
there is, then, no ground for that vain confidence which deceives you.”
The Prophet briefly intended to shake off that false confidence, by
which the Jews were inebriated, when they thought that there was a sure
safety in the intelligence of the king and princes.

<span id="xiv.xi-p11"></span>He says the same thing respecting the
priests as well as the prophets, as much glory belonged to the priestly
order; for the tribe of Levi had not taken that honor to itself, but God
himself had set priests over the people. Hence an opinion prevailed,
that the priests could not be without understanding and wisdom. With
regard to the prophets, Jeremiah no doubt conceded the name to
impostors, who falsely professed the name of God; and this way of
speaking is common in the writings of the prophets. He does not, then,
mean those true and faithful ministers of God, who duly executed their
office, but those who boasted of the name and title: and he says of
these, that they would *be astonished*  <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md)

<span id="xiv.xi-p15"></span>He, in short, deprives the people of that
false confidence, through which they hardened themselves, so as not to
fear God’s judgment.

<span id="xiv.xi-p16"></span>But this passage is entitled to special
notice, because it shews that God’s grace is not to be tied either to
ranks of men or to titles. The prophetic office had always been in high
repute; nor was the priestly without honor, for it was founded on God’s
command; but Jeremiah nevertheless declares, that there would be no
understanding in the priests and in the prophets, because they would
become stupefied and astonished. And with regard to the king, we know
that he was the representative of Christ; and yet he pronounces the same
thing of the king, and also of his counselors, — that they would be made
blind by the just vengeance of God, so as not to see anything. he
afterwards adds —

<span id="xiv.xii"></span>

<span id="xiv.xii-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#010.md)<span id="xiv.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xii-p2"></span>**10**. Then said I, Ah, Lord God! surely
thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall
have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.

<span id="xiv.xii-p3"></span>**10**. Et dixi, Ha, ha, Domine Jehova,
certe decipiendo decepisti populum hunc et Jerosolymam, dicendo, Pax
erit vobis; et pertigit gladius usque ad animam (tamen pertigit, *nam
hic copula vice adversativae ponitur*)

<span id="xiv.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xii-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xii-p6"></span>Some so understand this passage as though
the Prophet brought forward what was said by the people; for all the
most wicked, when oppressed by God’s hand, usually cast the blame on
him, and in their complaints contend and dispute with him. Hence they
think that the Prophet here, not in his own person, but in that of the
whole people, speaks thus: “O Lord, what can this be? thou surely hast
deceived us.” Others give somewhat a looser explanation, that the
Prophet here indirectly expostulates with God, because he had suffered
the false prophets to flatter the people so as to stupefy the minds of
all. But a different meaning is what I approve of: the Prophet, I think,
tauntingly exposes those false adulations, by which the prophets had
caused the ruin of the miserable Jews, by promising them God’s
forgiveness, and by ever announcing favorable predictions.

<span id="xiv.xii-p7"></span>God no doubt rendered the Jews their just
reward, when he suffered them to be deceived by impostors: we, indeed,
know that the world is ever afflicted with this disease, — that they
seek flatteries, as God upbraids them by Micah:

<span id="xiv.xii-p8"></span>“Ye seek prophets who promise to you an
abundant harvest, an abundant vintage.”  
(<span id="xiv.xii-p8.2"></span>[Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011)<span id="xiv.xii-p8.2"></span>.md)

<span id="xiv.xii-p9"></span>Since, then, the Jews wished their vices to
be spared, and not only disliked their faithful and severe reprovers,
but also hated them, they had deserved to be thus dealt with: it was
God’s will that many impostors should assume the prophetic name. Thus it
happened, that the Jews thought that their peaceable condition would be
perpetual; and this, as I have said, is usual with hypocrites. Now the
Prophet, in a biting strain, exposes here these deceptions, and says,
*Ah, ah, Jehovah! surely thou hast deceived this people:* for the
Prophet does not speak in the person of the people, nor does he
complain, that God permitted so much liberty to false prophets; but he
derides these impostors as well as the people. And further, as they were
all deaf, he turns to God, as though he had said, “Behold, Lord, worthy
of this reward are they, who have sought flatteries, and have not
attended to the holy warnings of thy servants: as, then, no kind of
correction was what they could endure, let them now begin to learn that
they have been deceived by others rather than by thee.”  <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md)

<span id="xiv.xii-p15"></span>We then see that the Prophet ridicules
that stupidity in which the Jews had been so long asleep; and the simple
meaning is, that he turned to God: *I have said, O Lord Jehovah, surely
thou hast deceived this people. “*Surely” is to be taken in an ironical
sense; that is, “It now really appears that they have been deceived; but
by whom? They wish, indeed, to throw the blame on thee; but they are
justly chargeable with foolish credulity, so that they, whom the false
prophets have deceived, have been rightly dealt with.” What they said
was, *Peace shall be to you*

<span id="xiv.xii-p16"></span>This never came from the mouth of God; for
Jeremiah daily thundered and threatened approaching ruin; for he was
like a celestial herald, who filled every place with terror; but he was
not heard: and at the same time the Jews praised the false prophets, who
soothed them with various promises. We hence perceive, that God had not
spoken peace to them; but that the Jews, not only willingly, but with
avidity, laid hold on those things by which the false prophets sought to
gratify them.

<span id="xiv.xii-p17"></span>He afterwards adds, *And reached has the
sword unto the soul;* that is, “Yet we are now destroyed by fatal
evils.” The Prophet here indirectly sets before them those delusive
flatteries with which the Jews pleased themselves, and shews that they
would at length really find how falsely they pretended the name of God.
It follows —

<span id="xiv.xiii"></span>

<span id="xiv.xiii-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011.md)<span
id="xiv.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xiii-p2"></span>**11**. At that time shall it be said to
this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the
wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,

<span id="xiv.xiii-p3"></span>**11**. In tempore illo dicetur populo
huic (*hoc est,* de populo hoc; ל *enim hic accipitur pro* ב,) et de
Jerusalem, ventus siccus (*alii transferunt,* vehementem) in excelsis
deserti (in deserto, *ad verbum,)* versus viam filiae populi mei, non ad
spargendum, neque ad purgandum;

<span id="xiv.xiii-p4"></span>**12.** *Even* a full wind from those
*places* shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p5"></span>**12**. Ventus plenior illis veniet mihi:
nunc etiam ego loquar judicia cum illis (*hoc* *est,* proferam judicia
cum illis.)

<span id="xiv.xiii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xiii-p7"></span><span id="xiv.xiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xiii-p8"></span>Jeremiah proceeds with the same
prediction: he says, that a terrible *wind* was coming, which would not
only *disperse* or *clear away,* but dissipate and overthrow all things.
He then expresses how great and how grievous would be the calamity which
he had before mentioned. He compares it to dry or and wind; for <span
id="xiv.xiii-p8.1"></span>צח, *tsach,* sometimes means “clear,” and
sometimes “arid,” as the greatest dryness is found on high places. He
means, no doubt, here the wind, which is violent, and disturbs the whole
atmosphere, when there are no clouds, and where no trees impede its
course. Hence, he speaks of high and desert places. It is the same as
though he had said, that so great would be the violence of God’s
vengeance, and so irresistible would be the eruption, that it would be
like a violent wind when it passes through high regions and through dry
land or desert places. He says, *Towards the way of the daughter of my
people;* as though he had said, — that the course of the wind would be
such as to bear directly on Judea. The mode of speaking here used is
well known to all who are in any degree acquainted with the writings of
the prophets. “The daughter of my people, “means the people themselves.
*Come,* then, *shall wind* towards Judea.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p9"></span>He then adds, *Not to scatter nor to
cleanse* Husbandmen are wont to winnow the corn when taken from the
thrashing — floor, that the chaff may be carried away by the wind: but
the Prophet says, that this wind would not be to clear away or scatter
the chaff; for it will be, he says, a very *vehement wind* He means, in
short, that God would shew so much displeasure towards the Jews, that he
would no longer chastise them in a moderate degree, or use any
moderation, as he had done previously; for God had already often
punished the Jews, but had hitherto acted the part of a physician,
having endeavored to heal the vices of the people. As, then, these
corrections had been without fruit, the Prophet now says, that God’s
wrath would now come, not to cleanse as before, nor to scatter the
chaff, but to consume everything among the people. Hence he adds (for
the two verses are connected together) *a fuller wind,* or one more
complete, *shall come* to them. Some read, “from these places, “so they
render <span id="xiv.xiii-p9.1"></span>מ; but it is rather to be taken
as noting the comparative degree, — that this wind would be much rougher
and more violent than other winds which usually clear the land or
scatter away the chaff, and separate it from the corn: *come,* then,
*shall a much more violent wind*

<span id="xiv.xiii-p10"></span><span id="xiv.xiii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xiii-p11"></span>*And come,* he says, *unto me* God, I
doubt not, speaks here. Some think that the Prophet here represents the
whole body of the people; and they consider them as saying, that there
would come a wind which would rush on themselves. But this is too
strained; and further, this explanation is disproved by the context: nor
can what follows be applied to the Prophet, *I will now pronounce
judgments against them* Here then God, in his office as a judge,
declares that a wind was nigh, by which he would dissipate and overthrow
the whole of Judea, and would no more cleanse it. And thus he shews,
that the Chaldeans would not of themselves come, but would be sent to
execute his orders; as though he had said, — that he would be the author
of those calamities which were impending over the Jews: *come,* then,
*shall wind unto me;* that is, it will be ready to obey my orders.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p12"></span>And he adds at last, by way of an
exposition, *I will then speak judgments with them* To speak judgments
is to execute the office of a judge, or to call to judgment, or to
summon men to declare their cause, as kings are said to speak judgments
when they constrain the guilty to render an account, of themselves. God
briefly intimates, that he had hitherto exercised great forbearance
towards the Jews; but that as he found that his indulgence availed
nothing, except that they became more and more ferocious, he declares,
that he would now become their judge to punish their wickedness.  <span
id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) He afterwards adds —

<span id="xiv.xiv"></span>

<span id="xiv.xiv-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#013.md)<span id="xiv.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xiv-p2"></span>**13**. Behold, he shall come up as clouds,
and his chariots *shall be* as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than
eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.

<span id="xiv.xiv-p3"></span>**13**. Ecce tanquam nubes ascendet, et
tanquam turbo currus ejus; celeriores aquilis equi ejus: vae nobis, quia
perditi sumus.

<span id="xiv.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xiv-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xiv-p6"></span>The Prophet here concludes the prediction
which referred to the dreadful vengeance that was coming; and he
mentions here several similitudes, such as might rouse the Jews and
constrain them to fear. He says, that the *chariots* of God would *come
as clouds and as a whirlwind;* and then that his *horses* would be
*swifter than eagles*

<span id="xiv.xiv-p7"></span>As to the clouds, the whirlwind, and the
eagles, (for the import of the three similitudes is the same,) the
Prophet no doubt intended thus to set forth the quickness of God’s
vengeance; but yet there is some difference. We see how *clouds*
suddenly arise and spread over the whole heaven; and thus it happens
when a *whirlwind* is in the air. Hence when he compares God’s chariots
to clouds and the whirlwind, it is the same as if he had said, that the
beginning of the calamity would be sudden, because God would
unexpectedly arise, after having been apparently asleep for a long time.
But when he says, that *God’s horses* would be *swifter than eagles,* he
means, that it would be easy for God, when once he had begun, to destroy
the whole of Judea, as it were in a moment, or at least in a very short
time; for we know how swift is the flying of the eagle; but he says,
that the *horses* of God would be *swifter than the eagles.*

<span id="xiv.xiv-p8"></span>We now understand the Prophet’s meaning:
for when the Jews derided the threatenings of the Prophets, they
tauntingly used such a language as this, — “O! we shall, at least in the
meantime, feast cheerfully and joyfully; these Prophets will not allow
us a truce for one hour; but yet many years will pass away before the
evil overtakes us.” We find profane men in our day, who in like manner
trifle with God: and when they cannot wholly despise what God threatens,
they yet delay the time, and think that they gain something by putting
off the day of vengeance. This, then, was the reason why the Prophet
said, that God’s chariots would ascend, as clouds arise suddenly, and
then as a whirlwind in clear sky, and lastly, in a manner swifter than
the eagles, even in their swiftest course.

<span id="xiv.xiv-p9"></span>The Prophet, in the last place, exclaims,
in the name of the whole people, *Woe to us! for we are lost*  <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) He speaks here concisely, that he
might shew that the false prophets, as well as the people, were going
astray to their own ruin, while they were asleep in their vices, and
thought their insensibility would escape punishment. He hence exclaims,
that though all were then seized with stupor, the people themselves were
yet lost. It at length follows —

<span id="xiv.xv"></span>

<span id="xiv.xv-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#014.md)<span id="xiv.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xv-p2"></span>**14**. O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from
wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts
lodge within thee?

<span id="xiv.xv-p3"></span>**14**. Munda a malitia cor tuum, Jerusalem,
ut salva sis: quousque manebunt in medio tui cogitationes vanitatis
tuae? (*alii vertunt,* doloris tui; *alii,* concupiscentiae tuae;
*alii,* iniquitatis, *ac si esset* <span id="xiv.xv-p3.1"></span>עונך.)

<span id="xiv.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xv-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xv-p6"></span>Here now the Prophet expressly and avowedly
exhorts the people to repent. By bidding Jerusalem to *wash from
wickedness her heart,* that she might be *saved,* he shews that there
was no remedy, except the Jews were reconciled to God; and that this
could not be, except they repented of their sins. He had said before,
that while God was angry they could not but perish; he now confirms the
same thing, — *that thou mayest be saved, wash thine heart from
wickedness;* as though he had said, that there was war between the Jews
and God, and that salvation could by no means be hoped for, since God
was armed for their destruction, and shewed himself a judge to punish
their vices: he at the same time reminds them of the true way of
repentance; it was by washing their heart from wickedness. For
hypocrites ever seek to appease God by external rites and observances;
but the Prophet shows that God cannot be pacified, except they from the
heart return to him. He then means that the beginning of true repentance
is an inward feeling. We now perceive what the Prophet means.

<span id="xiv.xv-p7"></span>But they reason foolishly who maintain that
repentance is the cause of salvation, because it is said, “That thou
mayest be saved, wash thy heart from wickedness:” and the Papists lay
hold on such passages to set up free — will; and they hold that sins are
abolished and punishment remitted through satisfactions made by us. But
this is extremely absurd and frivolous. For the Prophet is not speaking
of the cause of salvation; but, as I have said, he simply shows that men
are extremely thoughtless when they expect a peaceable condition, while
they carry on war with God, and when he is armed to execute vengeance on
them. We are not then to inquire here, whether a sinner delivers himself
from God’s hand by his repentance: but the Prophet had only this one
thing in view — that we cannot be safe and secure, except God be
reconciled to us. He further shews, that God will not be propitious to
us, except we repent, and that from the heart or from a genuine feeling
within.

<span id="xiv.xv-p8"></span>He then adds, *How long shall remain within
thee the thoughts of thy vanity?* He here touches on the hypocrisy of
his own nation; and he in effect says, that whatever excuses they might
make, they were yet proved guilty before God, and that their evasions
were frivolous, because God penetrated into the inmost recesses of their
hearts. He indeed speaks most suitably, for he had to do with hypocrites
who thought that their outward performances pacified God; and they also
thought that when they alleged their evasions they ought to be forgiven,
as they could not be condemned by earthly judges. The Prophet derides
these delusive thoughts, *How long shall thoughts of vanity remain
within thee?* that is, “Though the whole world were to absolve thee,
what yet would it avail thee? For vain thoughts remain in the midst of
thee, that is, in the recesses of thy heart; and God knows them, for
nothing is hid from him. There is then no reason for you to think that
ye will gain anything by your outward display or your excuses; for God
is the searcher of hearts. Let not these thoughts continue within thee.”

<span id="xiv.xv-p9"></span>He calls them the thoughts of *vanity* The
word, <span id="xiv.xv-p9.1"></span>און, *aun,* means sometimes
substance, but, it also means power, and sometimes grief, and sometimes
vanity or trouble. The Prophet means here, I have no doubt, trouble or
vanity. But some expound it as signifying lust; but I know not whether
it can be so taken. Either of the two foregoing meanings may suit the
passage, though *vanity* seems the best, *How long,* then, *shall
thoughts of vanity remain within thee?* that is, by which thou deceivest
thyself: for when God suspended his vengeance, the Jews thought that
they had escaped from his hand.  <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)
They might, at the same time, have been called the thoughts of trouble
or sorrow from the effect; for how could it have been otherwise, but
they must have found that they had procured a heavier judgment for
themselves, by trifling with the indulgence and forbearance of God? Too
strained is the explanation given by some, who render the words,
“thoughts of grief, “because the Jews had done many wrongs to their
neighbors, and caused them unjust vexations. I therefore doubt not but
that the Prophet refers to those deceptive hopes, by which the Jews grew
more perverse against God, so as not to fear any punishment.

<span id="xiv.xvi"></span>

<span id="xiv.xvi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xiv.xvi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou art
pleased daily to invite us to repentance, and since our own conscience
is a witness, how we have in various ways provoked thy vengeance, — O
grant, that we may not remain obstinate in our sins, nor harden our
minds by perverse delusions, but suffer ourselves to be subdued by thy
word, and so offer ourselves to thee with a pure and sincere heart, that
our whole life may be nothing else but a striving for that newness which
thou requirest; so that, being consecrated to thee in mind and body, we
may ever labor to glorify thy name, until we be made partakers of that
glory, which has been obtained for us by the blood of thy only —
begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="xiv.xviii-p1"></span><span
id="xiv.xviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#015.md)<span id="xiv.xviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xviii-p2"></span>**15**. For a voice declareth from Dan,
and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.

<span id="xiv.xviii-p3"></span>**15**. Quia vox annuntians e Dan, et
promulgans cladem (*vel*, poenam) e monte Ephraim (*alii* *vertunt*,
iniquitatem <span id="xiv.xviii-p3.1"></span>און).

<span id="xiv.xviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xviii-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xviii-p6"></span>The Prophet again repeats what he had
said, — that the Jews were given up, on account of their perverseness,
to final ruin; for they had so often and for so long a time provoked
God, and had not attended to pious admonitions, when God by his servants
the prophets offered pardon to them on their repentance. But the whole
passage, which I shall now explain, gives a lively representation of the
ruin that was at hand; for we see that in this verse there is a scene
presented to us, as the Prophet sets before our eyes what could not be
fully expressed in words.

<span id="xiv.xviii-p7"></span>*A voice*, he says, *declares from
Daniel* This was the extreme border on the north He had before said,
that an evil was coming from that quarter, that is, from the north; for
God had chosen the Chaldeans as the executors of his vengeance: hence he
says, “a voice is heard from Dan;” not that there was an army already
prepared to attack the Jews, but Jeremiah speaks here by the prophetic
spirit; and he sets the event as present before the Jews, who thought
not that so grievous an evil was nigh. For we said yesterday, that when
God for a time spares hypocrites, they become more hardened, and with
haughty contempt deride his prophets. When, therefore, Jeremiah saw that
he had to do with blocks, he deemed it necessary to use figurative
language, which exhibited to them more clearly that the judgment, which
the Jews imagined they had no reason to fear, was near at hand: hence he
says, *a voice is heard from Dan*

<span id="xiv.xviii-p8"></span>*And proclaims* <span
id="xiv.xviii-p8.1"></span>און, *aun*, that is, trouble, or punishment,
or ruin. The other rendering, to which I have referred, is not suitable.
The word <span id="xiv.xviii-p8.2"></span>און, *aun*, does indeed
properly signify iniquity; but it is to be taken here for punishment.
 <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) But whenever the Prophets use
this term, they intimate that evil is not inflicted by God except for
just causes; and they remind us that its source or fountain is to be
found in the wickedness of men. *Ruin* then was coming from *Mount
Ephraim* which was near the tribe of Judah and also Jerusalem. But it
was the same as though Jeremiah had said, that God was now thundering
from heaven, and that it would be of no avail to the Jews to close their
ears: for though they were even deaf, yet God’s vengeance would soon
come to light, accompanied with dreadful noise. It follows —

<span id="xiv.xix"></span>

<span id="xiv.xix-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#016.md)<span id="xiv.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xix-p2"></span>**16**. Make ye mention to the nations;
behold, publish against Jerusalem, *that* watchers come from a far
country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.

<span id="xiv.xix-p3"></span>**16**. Memorate in gentibus (*vel*, ad
gentes,) ecce promulgate super Jerusalem, obsessores veniunt e terra
longinqua, et mittunt super urbes Jehudah vocem suam.

<span id="xiv.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xix-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xix-p6"></span>The beginning of this verse is variously
explained. Some read, “Remember ye the nations, “and think that the
Prophet says this, because many of the nations were heralds of that
vengeance of God, which the Jews despised, as they thought that what the
true heralds of God declared were mere fables. They therefore take the
meaning of this passage, as though Jeremiah sent the Jews to the
nations, intimating that they were unworthy that God should send them
his usual teachers. But as the verb is in Hiphil, we ought rather to
read, *Rehearse* it: and some give this explanation, “Rehearse, “or
tell, “of the nations;” that is, “Announce that the Chaldeans are
hastening to lay waste the land, to pull down the cities of Judah and to
destroy the people.” But there is a third meaning which, in my judgment,
comports better with the passage. He literally says, *Rehearse it to the
nations; behold, proclaim against Jerusalem*: for as the Prophet saw
that he spent his labor in vain on that stupid people, who had become so
hardened in their perverseness, that they were wholly inattentive and
unteachable, he turned his address to the nations, and said, “Rehearse
it to the Gentiles;” as though he had said, “I have long ago reminded
this people, that God had other teachers; but what have we gained by our
labor, except that the people become continually worse: since then it is
so, now he says, ‘Declare it to the nations concerning Jerusalem;’ let
the Jews hear nothing more of their ruin, but let God’s vengeance on
them be made known to the heathens.” There is nothing strained or
obscure in this explanation; and it is wholly consonant with the
prophetic style.  <span id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md)

<span id="xiv.xix-p8"></span>He then deigned no longer to favor his own
nation with heavenly truth; because this would have cast what was holy
to the dogs; but he directs his discourse to the heathens, as though he
had said, “There is more knowledge in the blind and unbelieving than in
the chosen people of God.” This does not shew but that he afterwards
continued a long time in the discharge of his office; for the prophets,
inflamed with zeal for God, often threatened the people with utter ruin,
and afterwards performed their charge and tried whether they, of whom
they seemed to despair, were healable.

<span id="xiv.xix-p9"></span>He says that *besiegers would come from a
far country*. Some render <span id="xiv.xix-p9.1"></span>נצרים,
*netserim*, keepers; and they think that Jeremiah alludes to
Nebuchadnezzar, because his captains would come to destroy Jerusalem and
to demolish the cities of Judah. But I prefer to render the word
“besiegers.” Though some think that <span id="xiv.xix-p9.2"></span>נצר,
*netser*, sometimes means to destroy or lay waste; yet the other meaning
seems more suitable, as it appears evident from the next verse. To
render it keepers, seems to be frigid; though this is what is done
almost by all. I render it “besiegers,” — *Come* then *shall besiegers*;
for <span id="xiv.xix-p9.3"></span>נצר, *netser*, means not only to
keep, but also to shut up in a strait place. *Come*, he says, *shall
besiegers from a far country*. He used these expressions, that the
people might not promise themselves impunity, as it has been before
stated, through the forbearance of God: for when God deferred his
vengeance, they thought themselves relieved from all fear. Hence he
says, that though the enemy was not as yet present, though they did not
as yet hear the sound of the coming enemy, God at the same time did not
threaten them in vain; for he would in an instant send for those from a
distant land, who would execute his vengeance.

<span id="xiv.xix-p10"></span>What follows, *they shall send forth their
voice against the cities of Judah*, is added, in order that the Jews
might know that they could by no hindrances prevent God from bringing
quickly the Chaldeans to terrify their cities by their sound. What he
indeed means is the shout by which soldiers rouse one another to fight:
but as this is commonly done as a sign of victory, he intimates that it
was all over with the Jews; for the soldiers had as it were already
uttered their triumphant shoutings.  <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) It follows —

<span id="xiv.xx"></span>

<span id="xiv.xx-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#017.md)<span id="xiv.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xx-p2"></span>**17**. As keepers of a field, are they
against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me,
saith the Lord.

<span id="xiv.xx-p3"></span>**17**. Sicuti custodes (*est aliud nomen
quam prius* <span id="xiv.xx-p3.1"></span>שמרים,) agri erunt super eam
in circuitu; quia me exacerbarit, dicit Jehova.

<span id="xiv.xx-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xx-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xx-p6"></span>He intimates here that there would be no
escape to the Jews when God brought the Chaldeans, for every egress, all
the ways, would be closed up, so that they could not migrate to another
land. It is the same as though he had said, that such a calamity was
nigh them that they could not escape it by exile, it is indeed a sad
thing when men flee away naked as from the fire, and seek a place among
strangers, and live there in misery and want; but the Prophet declares
here, that so grievous was the punishment prepared for the Jews, that it
would not indeed be possible for them to save themselves by expatriation
and flight, for God would close up every avenue, and would as it were
set guards to prevent any to depart.

<span id="xiv.xx-p7"></span>He afterwards assigns a reason for this,
*Because they have made me angry*  <span
id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) The Prophet again shews that God dealt
not cruelly with the Jews, nor that they were visited by chance with so
many and so grievous calamities, but that they suffered justly, for they
had provoked the wrath of God. It would indeed have availed the Jews but
little that they dreaded an approaching evil, except they acknowledged
that God was punishing them for their perverseness. Hence the reason is
stated: it was mentioned, that the Jews might know that these calamities
were brought on them by God’s hand. And for the same purpose is what
follows —

<span id="xiv.xxi"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxi-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xxi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#018.md)<span id="xiv.xxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxi-p2"></span>**18**. Thy way and thy doings have
procured these *things* unto thee; this *is* thy wickedness, because it
is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart.

<span id="xiv.xxi-p3"></span>**18**. Via tua et actiones tuae fecerunt
hoc tibi; haec malitia tua, quoniam amarum, quoniam pertigit ad cor tuum
(*vel*, quamvis amarum sit, et quamvis pertigerit ad cor tuum.)

<span id="xiv.xxi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xxi-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xxi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxi-p6"></span>As I have just said, the Prophet confirms
what he had declared, — that the Jews would not have to suffer,
according to what is commonly said, an adverse fortune, but would be
summoned by God to judgment, in order that being touched with the fear
of God, they might repent, or at least, though destroyed as to the
flesh, they might yet, being humbled, obtain pardon and be saved as to
the Spirit.

<span id="xiv.xxi-p7"></span>He therefore says, that their *deeds had
done this* for them; as though he had said, “There is no reason for you
to blame God, or your adverse fortune, as ye are wont to do, and as all
the heathens also do; for your own deeds have procured for you these
calamities. Thus God will perform his office of a judge; and whatever
may happen to you is to be ascribed to your own wickedness.” And to the
same purpose is what he adds, *This is thy wickedness*. In short, the
Prophet shews, that the Jews in vain transferred their calamities to
this or that cause, for the whole blame was in themselves; they procured
for themselves their own ruin by their impiety and evil deeds.

<span id="xiv.xxi-p8"></span>In the second clause of the verse, <span
id="xiv.xxi-p8.1"></span>כי מר כי נגע, *ki mer, ki nego*, etc., the
Prophet intimates, that however bitter might be to them what they were
to endure, and however it might penetrate into the inmost heart, it was
yet to be ascribed to themselves. For hypocrites are wont in their
lamentations to cast the blame on God, or at least to complain of
fortune. The Prophet anticipates these evasions, by shewing that however
bitter might be what the Jews had to endure, and that though God should
pierce them through and penetrate to their very bowels and hearts, yet
they themselves were the authors of all their calamities.  <span
id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) He then adds —

<span id="xiv.xxii"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxii-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xxii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#019.md)<span id="xiv.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxii-p2"></span>**19**. My bowels, my bowels! I am pained
at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace,
because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm
of war.

<span id="xiv.xxii-p3"></span>**19**. Viscera mea, viscera mea doleo,
parietes cordis mei (*ad* *verbum*, hoc est, praecordia mea,) cor meum
tumultuatur mihi (*hoc est*, intra me;) non tacebo, quoniam vocem tubae
(*vel*, clangorem tubae) audivit (*vel* audivisti) anima mea; et clamor
belli auditus est (*vel*, clamourem belli audivit anima mea.)

<span id="xiv.xxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xxii-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxii-p6"></span>Some interpreters think that the Prophet
is here affected with grief, because he saw that his own nation would
soon perish; but I know not whether this is a right view. It is indeed
true, that the prophets, though severe when denouncing God’s vengeance,
did not yet put off the feelings of humanity. Hence they often bewailed
the evils which they predicted; and this we shall see more clearly in
its proper place. The prophets then had two feelings: when they were the
heralds of God’s vengeance, they necessarily forgot their own
sensibilities; but this courage did not prevent them from feeling sorrow
for others; for they could not but sympathize with their brethren, when
they saw them, even their own flesh, doomed to ruin. But in this place
the Prophet seems not so much to mourn the calamities of the people, but
employs figurative terms in order to awaken their stupor, for he saw
that they were torpid, and that they neither feared God nor were touched
with any shame. Since then there was so much insensibility in the
people, it was necessary for Jeremiah and other servants of God to
embellish their discourses, so as not simply to teach, but also forcibly
and strongly to rouse their dormant minds.

<span id="xiv.xxii-p7"></span>He therefore says, *My bowels, my bowels!*
We shall see that the Prophet in other places thus laments, when he
speaks of Babylon, of Edom, and of other enemies of his people, and why?
The Prophet was not indeed affected with grief when he heard that the
Chaldeans would perish, and when God declared to him the same thing
respecting other heathen nations, who had cruelly persecuted the holy
people; but since thoughtless men, as I have said, take no notice of
what God from heaven threatens them with, it is necessary to use such
expressions as may rouse them from their torpor. So I interpret this
place: the Prophet does not express his own grief for the calamities of
his people, but by the prophetic spirit enlarges on what he had
previously said; for he saw that what he had stated had no effect, or
was not sufficient to rouse their minds. *My bowels!* he says. He had
indeed grief in his bowels, for he was a member of the community; but we
now speak of his object or the purpose he had in view in speaking thus.
It is not then the expression of his own grief, but an affecting
description, in order that what he had said might thoroughly rouse the
minds of those who heedlessly laughed at the judgment of God.

<span id="xiv.xxii-p8"></span>He then adds, *My heart tumultuates*, or
makes a noise: the verb means to resound, and hence it is metaphorically
taken for tumultuating. He speaks of the palpitation of the heart, which
takes place when there is great fear. But he calls it noise or tumult,
as though he had said, that he was not now master of himself, so as to
retain a calm and tranquil mind, for God smote his heart with horrible
dread. He afterwards adds, *I will not be silent, for the sound of the
trumpet has my soul heard*, or thou, my soul, hast heard, *and the
clamor of battle*; for the word <span
id="xiv.xxii-p8.1"></span>מלחמה*chme*, is to be thus taken here. He says
that he would not be silent because this clamor made a noise in his
heart. We hence conclude that he grieved not from a feeling of human
sorrow, but he did that which he had been bidden to do by God; for he
had been chosen to be the herald of God’s vengeance, which was nigh,
though not dreaded by the Jews.  <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md)

<span id="xiv.xxii-p12"></span>Some think that soul is here to be taken
for the prophetic spirit, for trumpets had not yet sounded, nor was yet
heard the clamor of battle. They therefore suppose that there is to be
understood here a contrast, that Jeremiah did not perceive the noise by
his ears, but in his heart. But I know not whether this refinement may
be fitly applied to the Prophet’s words. I therefore think that Jeremiah
means, that he spoke in earnest, because he saw God’s vengeance as
though it were already made evident. And this availed not a little to
gain credit to what he had stated, so that the Jews might know that he
did not speak of himself, nor act a part as players do on the stage.
They were then to know that he did not relate what God had pronounced,
but that he was God’s herald in such a way, that he heard in his soul or
heart, to his great terror, the tumult of war and the sound of the
trumpet. It follows —

<span id="xiv.xxiii"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="xiv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md)<span id="xiv.xxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxiii-p2"></span>**20**. Destruction upon destruction is
cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled,
*and* my curtains in a moment.

<span id="xiv.xxiii-p3"></span>**20**. Afflictio super afflictionem
vocata est; quoniam perdita est omnis terra subito; perdita (*vel*,
destructa, *est idem verbum*) sunt tabernacula mea, repente cortinae
meae.

<span id="xiv.xxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xxiii-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxiii-p6"></span>He pursues the same subject, but
amplifies the dread by a new circumstance, — that God would heap evils
on evils, so that the Jews would in vain hope for an immediate relief.
By saying, *A calamity upon a calamity*, he means that the end of one
evil would be the beginning of another. For it is what especially
distresses miserable men, when they think that their evils will continue
long. They indeed imagined that God would be satisfied with an evil that
would be soon over, like a storm or a tempest: and when an alleviation
appeared, they would have thought that they had suffered enough and
would have returned again to their old ways and derided God as though
they had escaped from his hands. For this reason the Prophet declares,
that their calamities would for a long time continue, so that no end to
them could be hoped for, until the Jews were wholly destroyed. By saying
that calamities were *called*, or summoned, he briefly reminds them,
that God would sit on his tribunal, and that after inflicting light
punishment on men for their sins, he would add heavier punishment, and
that when he found their wickedness incurable, he would proceed to
extremities, so as wholly to destroy those who could not be reclaimed.
*Called* then *has been distress upon distress*: and how was this?
*Perished has the whole land*; and then, *my tabernacles have been
suddenly destroyed, in an instant destroyed has been my curtains.*
 <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md)

<span id="xiv.xxiii-p10"></span>It is thought that the Prophet here
compares strongly fortified cities to tents and curtains, in order to
expose the foolish confidence with which the Jews were proudly filled,
thinking that their cities were a sufficient protection from enemies. It
is then supposed that the Prophet here deprives them of their vain
confidence by calling these cities tents. There are also those who think
that he alludes to his own city Anathoth, or to his own manner of life.
It is indeed true that Jeremiah speaks often in other places as a
shepherd; that is, he uses common and free modes of speaking. It would
not then be unnatural to suppose, that he put on the character of a
shepherd when he spoke of tents. Both these views may however be
combined, — that he used a language common among shepherds, — and that
he shews that it was a mere mockery for the Jews to think that they
could easily escape, as they had on their borders many fortified cities
capable of resisting the attacks of their enemies. But no less suitable
view would be this, — That no corner would be safe; for their enemies
would penetrate into the most retired places and destroy the smallest
cottages, which might be resorted to as hiding — places.

<span id="xiv.xxiii-p11"></span>He says *suddenly*, and *in an instant*,
in order that the Jews might not promise themselves any time for
negotiating, and thus procrastinate, and think that they would have time
enough to make their peace with God. It follows —

<span id="xiv.xxiv"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxiv-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#021.md)<span id="xiv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxiv-p2"></span>**21**. How long shall I see the standard,
*and* hear the sound of the trumpet?

<span id="xiv.xxiv-p3"></span>**21.** Usquequo videbo vexillum? audiam
vocem (*vel*, clangorem) tubae?

<span id="xiv.xxiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xxiv-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xxiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxiv-p6"></span>He concludes that part of his discourse,
which, as we have said, he embellished with figurative terms, in order
more fully to rouse slow and torpid minds: but he confirms what he said
at the beginning of the last verse

<span id="xiv.xxiv-p7"></span>(<span id="xiv.xxiv-p7.1"></span>[Jer
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#020.md)<span
id="xiv.xxiv-p7.1"></span>)  
“Distress has been summoned upon distress.”

<span id="xiv.xxiv-p8"></span>He indeed repeats in other words the same
thing, *How long shall I see the standard*, he says, *and hear the sound
of the trumpet?* that is, “You are greatly deceived, if ye think that
your enemies, after having for a short time marched through the land,
will return home: for the evil of war will for a long time afflict you,
and God will protract your calamities, so that the sound of trumpets
will continue, and the standard will often, and even every day, be
exhibited.”

<span id="xiv.xxiv-p9"></span>We now then perceive the Prophet’s
meaning: He first shews, that though their enemies were afar off, they
would yet come suddenly, and that the horses of God would be, according
to what he said yesterday, swifter than eagles. He afterwards refers to
the continued progress of the war; for it was necessary to shew to the
Jews, that as they had long heedlessly despised God, so his vengeance
would not be momentary, but would lie on them, so as to be without end.

<span id="xiv.xxiv-p10"></span>Now we ought to know that at this day
there is no less dullness than among the Jews. It is therefore not
enough to summon the ungodly and the wicked before God’s tribunal, but
such metaphorical language ought to be employed as may strike terror,
and constrain them to fear, though they may endeavor in every way to
harden their own consciences and stupefy themselves, so as to be capable
of easily despising God. It is then necessary, that at the present day
the servants of God should also speak more strongly and vehemently, that
they may rouse hypocrites and the obstinate from their torpor. It then
follows —

<span id="xiv.xxv"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxv-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xxv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#022.md)<span id="xiv.xxv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxv-p2"></span>**22**. For my people *is* foolish, they
have not known me; they *are* sottish children, and they have none
understanding: they *are* wise to do evil, but to do good they have no
knowledge.

<span id="xiv.xxv-p3"></span>**22**. Quoniam stultus populus meus, me
non cognovit; filii insipientes ipsi, et non intelligentes ipsi (sunt;
<span id="xiv.xxv-p3.1"></span>חמה demonstrativum pronomen ponitur vice
verbi:) astuti ipsi (vel, sapientes) ad malum; sed ad benefaciendum non
intelligunt.

<span id="xiv.xxv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xxv-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xxv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxv-p6"></span>The Prophet again teaches us, that the
cause of these evils arose from the people themselves, and was to be
found in them, so that they could not transfer it to anybody else. Hence
he says, *My people are foolish*. He speaks here in the person of God;
for it immediately follows, *Me have they not known*: this could not
have been said by Jeremiah. God then complains here of the folly of his
people; whom he so calls, not by way of honor, but that he might double
their reproach; for nothing could have been more disgraceful than that
the people, whom God had chosen as his peculiar inheritance, should be
thus demented: for why had God chosen the seed of Abraham as his adopted
children, but that they might be as lamps, carrying through the world
the light of salvation?

<span id="xiv.xxv-p7"></span>“What people in the world, “says Moses,
“are so noble, who have gods so near them?” He says also, “This is thy
knowledge and wisdom.” (<span id="xiv.xxv-p7.1"></span>[Deut.
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007)<span id="xiv.xxv-p7.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xiv.xxv-p8"></span>God then shews here that it was a monstrous
thing, which all should regard with abhorrence, that his people should
be foolish; as though he had said, “Can it be that a people whom I have
chosen for myself, and with whom I have deposited the covenant of
eternal salvation, whom I have instructed by my word — that this people
should so madly ruin themselves?”

<span id="xiv.xxv-p9"></span>The *people*, then, are *foolish*, because
*they have not known me*. He here expresses what was the cause of the
foolishness or blindness of the people, even because they did not know
God; for the knowledge of him is true wisdom. Now God thus shews that
the madness of the people was inexcusable. How so? because he had made
himself so familiarly known to them, that the Israelites had no occasion
to ask, as Moses says, Who shall ascend into heaven, or who shall
descend into the deep? for the word was set before them. (<span
id="xiv.xxv-p9.1"></span>[De
30:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#012.md)<span
id="xiv.xxv-p9.1"></span>.) As, then, God had so kindly manifested
himself to the Jews, he justly complains that he was not known by them.

<span id="xiv.xxv-p10"></span>There are then here two things to be
noticed; first, the kind of madness that is here mentioned, — the people
did not know God. And we hence learn that then only are we wise when we
fear God, and that we are always mad and senseless when we regard him
not. This is one thing. Secondly, we must know that no excuse of
ignorance or mistake was allowed to that people, for God had made
himself known to them. And this may be applied to us: God will justly
upbraid us at the last day, that we have been foolish and mad, if we are
without the knowledge of him; for we have the means, as I have said, of
knowing him; and there is no excuse that we can plead for our ignorance,
since God has not spoken to us in an obscure manner. God in these words
accused the Jews of ingratitude, and of deliberate wickedness, because
they *knew* him not. But since God has at this day made himself more
fully known to us, it is, as I have said, a heavier condemnation to us,
and our punishment will thus be doubled, if we know not God, who is so
kind to us, and deals with us so graciously.

<span id="xiv.xxv-p11"></span>Then he adds, that they were *foolish
children*, and *not intelligent*. The antithesis in Hebrew is more
emphatical than in Greek and Latin; for to say, “He is foolish, and not
wise, “would be in Greek and Latin frigid, as the last clause would be
weaker than the former. But in Hebrew it is different; for in this way
is conveyed the idea, that they were so foolish that not even the least
portion of a sound mind remained in them. Even those who are foolish and
senseless do yet retain some knowledge, however small it may be: hence
they say, that the foolish often speak what is suitable. But the Prophet
means another thing, — that the Jews were not only senseless and stupid,
but that they were so destitute of all knowledge, that they were like
stones or brute animals, and that they had not a particle of sound mind
or of rational knowledge remaining in them.  <span

<span id="xiv.xxvi"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxvi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xiv.xxvi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast
not only once kindled among us the light of celestial truth, but also
invitest us daily to partake of the salvation which has been set before
us, — O grant, that we may not close our eyes, nor render deaf our ears,
nor harden ourselves in our sins, but that as thou ceasest not
continually to call us to thyself, so we may earnestly strive to hasten
to thee, and to persevere in the course of our holy calling, so that we
may draw nearer daily to its end, until thou receivest us at length into
that celestial kingdom, which has been obtained for us by the blood of
thine only-begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="xiv.xxviii"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p1"></span><span
id="xiv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:23-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#023.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p2"></span>**23**. I beheld the earth, and, lo, *it
was* without form, and void; and the heavens, and they *had* no light.

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p3"></span>**23**. Vidi terram, et ecce vasta et

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p4"></span>**24.** I beheld the mountains, and, lo,
they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p5"></span>**24**. Vidi montes, et ecce
contremiscentes (contremiscebant), et omnes colles movebantur:

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p6"></span>**25**. I beheld, and, lo, *there was*
no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p7"></span>**25**. Vidi, et ecce nullus homo, et
omnes aves coelorum evolaverant:

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p8"></span>**26**. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful
place *was* a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at
the presence of the Lord, *and* by his fierce anger.

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p9"></span>**26**. Vidi, et ecce regio foecunda
(*vel*, carmelus) desertum, et omnes urbes ejus destructae a facie
Jehovae, et a facie excandescentiae irae ejus.

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p10"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p11"></span><span id="xiv.xxviii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p12"></span>The Prophet in this passage enlarges in
a language highly metaphorical on the terror of God’s vengeance, that he
might rouse the Jews, who were stupid and careless: nor is the
repetition in vain, when he says four times, that he *looked*. He might
have spoken of the earth, heaven, men, and fertile places in one
sentence: but it is the same as though he had turned his eyes to four
different quarters, and said, that wherever he looked, there appeared to
him dreadful tokens of God’s wrath, and which threatened the Jews with
utter ruin. Nor is it a wonder that the Prophet is so vehement; for we
know that men would have heedlessly received all threatenings, except
they were violently roused. And this mode of teaching ought to be well
known to us; for all in any degree acquainted with the writings of the
prophets, must know that they especially pursued this course, in order
to rouse hypocrites, and the despisers of God, who, with a stiff neck
and a hardened heart, were not moved by any apprehension of punishment.
But this passage is remarkable above most others: we ought therefore to
consider the import of the Prophet’s words.

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p13"></span>He says first, that he looked on the
earth, and that it was <span id="xiv.xxviii-p13.1"></span>תהו, *teu*,
and <span id="xiv.xxviii-p13.2"></span>בהו, *beu*. He employs the very
words which Moses adopted in his history of the creation; for before any
order was introduced, he says that the earth was <span
id="xiv.xxviii-p13.3"></span>תהו, *teu*, and <span
id="xiv.xxviii-p13.4"></span>בהו, *beu*, that is, waste and unformed
chaos; and it had no beauty pleasing to the eye.  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) It is the same as though He had said,
that the order, which had been so beautifully arranged, had now
disappeared through God’s wrath, and that there was nothing but
confusion everywhere. Thus he amplifies the atrocity of their sins; as
though he had said, that men had become so fallen, that they had changed
the whole form of the world, and blended heaven and earth together, so
that now there was no distinction between things. As to the heavens, he
says, that there was *no light* in them: he intimates that the light of
the sun, moon, and stars, was in a manner extinguished, because men were
unworthy to enjoy such a kindness from God; and as though the sun and
moon were ashamed to be witnesses of so many sins and vices.

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p21"></span>We now then apprehend what Jeremiah
chiefly means in the first verse: He says, that he *looked on the
earth*, and that nothing appeared in it but dreadful chaos and waste,
there being no form nor beauty; for the Jews had by their sins subverted
the order of nature and the creation of God. And he says, that he
*looked on the heavens*, and that they had *no light*; for the Jews had
deserved to be deprived of that benefit which God had designed the sun
and the moon to convey: and it is indeed a singular instance of God’s
kindness, that he has made such noble objects to be of such service to
us. The Prophet, in short, means that such awful tokens of God’s wrath
appeared in heaven and on earth, as though the whole world had been
thrown into confusion. This mode of speaking often occurs in the other
prophets, especially in <span id="xiv.xxviii-p21.1"></span>[Joe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#002.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p21.1"></span>. Though the words are hyperbolical, yet
they do not exceed what is suitable, if we take to the account the
extreme insensibility of men: for except God arms heaven and earth, and
shews himself ready to take away all the blessings with which he favors
mankind, they will, as we have lately said, laugh to scorn all his
threatenings.

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p22"></span><span id="xiv.xxviii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p23"></span>Jeremiah descends afterwards from
heaven to mountains, and says that they *trembled*, and that *all the
hills* moved or shook; some say, destroyed, but I know not for what
reason, for the Prophet no doubt confirms the same thing by another
phrase: and as he had said, that mountains trembled, so he also adds,
that hills shook; and this is the proper meaning of the verb. Now the
reason why he speaks of mountains and hills is evident; for a greater
stability seems to belong to them than to level grounds, inasmuch as
mountains are for the most part stony, and have their roots most firmly
fixed in rocks. Were indeed the whole world to be thrown into confusion,
the mountains seem to be so firmly based that no commotion could affect
them: but the Prophet says, that they *trembled*, and that the hills
*shook*

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p24"></span><span id="xiv.xxviii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p25"></span>What he saw the third time was
solitude; for he says that there were *no men*, and that all *birds* had
fled away. The principal ornament of the world, we know, consists of men
and of living creatures. For why was the earth made so productive, that
it brings forth fruits, so many and so various, except for the sake of
men and of animals? Though, then, the earth appears very beautiful on
account of its trees, herbs, and every kind of fruit, yet its principal
ornaments are men and animals. By stating a part for the whole, the
Prophet, by mentioning birds, includes all earthly animals: he says
then, that the earth was emptied of its inhabitants.

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p26"></span><span id="xiv.xxviii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p27"></span>What he saw the fourth time was this —
that the *fertile land* was turned into a *desert*. I indeed think that
Carmel is to be taken here as meaning the place. That part of the holy
land, we know, received its name from its fertility: Carmel means any
rich and fruitful spot of ground. But, as I have just said, the mount
was so called because it abounded in all kinds of produce; for there
were on it fruitful pastures and fertile fields, and every part of it
was remarkably pleasant and delightful. I am therefore inclined to
consider Carmel itself to be meant here; and my reason is, because he
immediately adds, that its *cities* were *destroyed*; and this can be
more fitly applied to Carmel than generally to all fruitful regions. As
to myself, I think that the Prophet speaks of Carmel; and yet he alludes
to what the word means.  <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) Even in
this verse he mentions a part for the whole, as though he had said, that
Carmel, which excelled in fertility, had become like a desert. When
Isaiah speaks of the renovation of the Church, he says,

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p29"></span>“The desert shall be as Carmel,“ (<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p29.1"></span>[Isa
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p29.1"></span>)

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p30"></span>as though he had said, that the
blessing of God would be so abundant through the whole world, that
deserts would bear fruit like Carmel, or those regions which are
remarkable for their fertility. But Jeremiah, speaking here of a curse,
says, that *Carmel* would be like the *desert*; and that all its
*cities* would be demolished, even *at the presence of Jehovah, and by
the great heat of his wrath*

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p31"></span>Some render <span
id="xiv.xxviii-p31.1"></span>חרון, *charun*, fury: and this kind of
language is not without its use; for men, as we have said, except God
terrifies them as it were by thunders, will sleep and will not perceive
his judgment, so that all threatenings become useless to them. This is
the reason why Scripture speaks so often of the fury or of the great
heat of God’s wrath. Either of the two words might indeed be sufficient;
either <span id="xiv.xxviii-p31.2"></span>חרון, *charun*, which means
fury or great heat; or <span id="xiv.xxviii-p31.3"></span>אף aph, which
signifies anger or wrath. Why then are both mentioned? because it is
necessary, as I have said, to tear in pieces our hardness as with
hammers; for otherwise God could never turn us to fear him. This
repetition then ought to avail for the purpose of subduing the
perverseness of our nature; not that these turbulent feelings belong to
God, as it is well known; but as we cannot otherwise conceive how
dreadful his vengeance is, it is necessary that he should be set before
us as one who is angry and burning with wrath: in a like manner, eternal
death is described to us under the metaphor of fire.

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p32"></span>Now, as to the sum of what is here
said, the Jews at that time no doubt enjoyed great abundance and
indulged their pleasures; in short, they were fully pleased with their
condition. But the Prophet here declares that he saw at a distance what
these blind Jews did not see, even God’s vengeance approaching, which
would deprive them of that abundance, on account of which they were so
swollen with pride, and which would reduce them all into such a state of
desolation that nothing would remain above or below, but a disordered
confusion, such as existed before nature was brought to order, when the
earth was not separated from the heavens, and there was only a confused
mass, including all the elements, and without any light. He afterwards
adds —

<span id="xiv.xxix"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxix-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xxix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#027.md)<span id="xiv.xxix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxix-p2"></span>**27**. For thus hath the Lord said, The
whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.

<span id="xiv.xxix-p3"></span>**27**. Quia sic dicit Jehova, Desolata
erit (vasta, perdita erit) tota terra; et finem (*vel*, consumptionem)
non faciam (*atque tunc copula resolvetur in adversativam*, non tamen
consumptionem faciam.)

<span id="xiv.xxix-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xxix-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xxix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxix-p6"></span>The Prophet briefly explains here what he
understood by the four things which he had seen and of which he had
spoken. He then declares, as it were in the person of God, that there
would be a dreadful desolation throughout Judea; Wasted, he says, shall
be the whole land, or, in the whole land there shall be desolation. Some
explain what afterwards follows, as though he mitigated the severity of
his language. Hence, as they think, a mitigation is added, which was to
relieve the faithful with some hope of mercy, lest they should wholly
despond. And indeed were he to threaten only he might fill a hundred
worlds with terror. Lest then despair should so overwhelm the faithful
as to restrain them from fleeing to God for mercy, it is often added by
way of mitigation, that God would not consume the whole land.

<span id="xiv.xxix-p7"></span>The word <span
id="xiv.xxix-p7.1"></span>כלה, *cale*, sometimes means perfection, but
in most places, consummation; for the verb signifies to perfect and to
consume, and for the same reason. Though these two things seem
inconsistent, yet what is consumed is said to be perfected, for it comes
to an end. If this explanation is approved, we now see the reason why he
declares that he would not make a consummation, with whatever severity
he might punish the sins of his people; it was, that some hope might
remain for the faithful, so that they might not be wholly discouraged;
which would have been the case had not God promised to be propitious and
mindful of his covenant.

<span id="xiv.xxix-p8"></span>Some perhaps may approve of reading the
sentence as a question, and think that the object is to beat down the
pride of the ungodly, and to dissipate the boasting of those who relied
on the hope of impunity; as though he had said, “Do ye still deny that I
shall make a consummation?”

<span id="xiv.xxix-p9"></span>Now, though the former exposition contains
a richer truth, yet I prefer to take <span
id="xiv.xxix-p9.1"></span>כלה, *cale*, as signifying an end, as though
he had declared that he would observe no moderation in executing his
vengeance:  <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) and a similar
language occurs in the next chapter. The real meaning then is, — that
God would to the end carry on his work of desolation. The prophets
indeed do not always speak alike when they announce God’s judgments.
Sometimes they denounce ruin where none seems to be safe; yet God ever
preserves some hidden seed, as it is said in <span
id="xiv.xxix-p10.9"></span>[Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md)<span id="xiv.xxix-p10.9"></span>;
where also it appears evident what the prophets understood by making a
consummation. For God there threatens and says,

<span id="xiv.xxix-p11"></span>“Behold I will make a consummation;” yet
he afterwards adds, “The consummation shall bring forth fruit,”

<span id="xiv.xxix-p12"></span>that is, what remained of the
consummation. The prophets elsewhere compare the Church of God to olive
— trees when shaken, or to vines after vintage, (<span
id="xiv.xxix-p12.1"></span>[Isa
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006.md)<span id="xiv.xxix-p12.1"></span>;
<span id="xiv.xxix-p12.2"></span>[Isa
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#013.md)<span
id="xiv.xxix-p12.2"></span>;) for some grapes ever remain which escape
the eyes of the gatherers; so also, when the olive — trees are shaken,
some fruit remain on the highest branches. Thus God says, that the
consummation he makes in his Church is like the vintage or the shaking
of olive — trees, when some fruit remain and escape the eyes of the
gatherers. We now perceive what the Prophet means, — that there would be
the ruin of the whole people, so that they would have neither a name nor
existence as a body; which thing also happened, when they were driven as
exiles into Babylon; for the people, as a civil community, then ceased
to exist, so that there was an end made of them.

<span id="xiv.xxix-p13"></span>I indeed allow that God’s threatenings
cannot avail for our salvation, unless connected with the promise of
pardon, so that being raised up by the hope of salvation we may flee to
him: for as long as we deem God inexorable, we shun every access to him;
and thus despair drives us into a rage like that of fiends. Hence it is
that the reprobate rage so much against God, and make a great clamor:
and they would willingly thrust him from his throne. It is therefore
necessary that a hope of salvation should be set before us, so that we
may be touched with repentance: and as this promise is perpetual,
whatever may happen, even if earth and heaven were mixed together, and
ruin on every side were filling us with dread, we must still remember
that there will be ever some remnant according to the passages we have
referred to in the first and tenth chapters of Isaiah. But as the people
were not prepared to receive consolation, the design of the Prophet here
is different, for he only mentions punishment. He afterwards adds —

<span id="xiv.xxx"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxx-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xxx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#028.md)<span id="xiv.xxx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxx-p2"></span>**28**. For this shall the earth mourn, and
the heavens above be black: because I have spoken *it*, I have purposed
*it*, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.

<span id="xiv.xxx-p3"></span>**28**. Super hoc lugebit terra, et
nigrescent (*vel*, caligine *aut* nigredine obducti erunt) coeli
desursum (*nescio tamen an posset verti*, a transgressione; nam <span
id="xiv.xxx-p3.1"></span>מעל *significat etiam* transgredi et
inquietare;) quia 1oquutus sum; cogitavi et non poenituit, et non
convertar ab hoc.

<span id="xiv.xxx-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xxx-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xxx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxx-p6"></span>Jeremiah proceeds here with the same
subject, and still introduces God as the speaker, that what is said
might produce a greater effect. *For this*, he says, *the land shall
mourn*. The mourning of the land is to be taken for its desolation; but
he refers to what he had said before. He does not speak of the
inhabitants of the land; for they who thus explain the passage, diminish
much the force of the expression; for the Prophet here ascribes terror
and sorrow to the very elements, which is much more striking than if he
said, that all men would be in sorrow and grief. The same also must be
thought of the heavens. Indeed, the latter clause proves that he does
not speak of the inhabitants, but of the land itself, which, though
without reason, seems yet to dread God’s vengeance. And thus the Prophet
upbraids men with their insensibility; for when God appeared as judge
from heaven, they were not touched with any fear. *Mourn* then *shall
the land, and covered shall be the heaven with darkness*; that is,
though men remain stupid, yet both heaven and earth shall feel how
dreadful God’s judgment will be.

<span id="xiv.xxx-p7"></span>He afterwards adds, *Because I have
spoken*. Some consider <span id="xiv.xxx-p7.1"></span>אשר, *asher*,
what, to be understood between this sentence and the following verb:
“Because I have spoken what I have purposed, and I have not repented.”
But the concise phrase is not unsuitable: God first intimates, that he
had pronounced the sentence, which would remain firm and unchangeable;
as though he had said, “I have once for all declared by my servants what
I will do.” For the prophets, we know, were the heralds of God’s
vengeance: and as their doctrine was often despised, so at this day also
the world obstinately rejects it; and as it often now derides all
threatenings, so it happened then. But Jeremiah introduces here God as
the speaker, as though he had said, “My servants have been despised by
you; but they have said nothing but what I have commanded them: I am
therefore the author of that sentence by which you ought to have been
moved and roused.” In this sense it is that God testifies that he had
spoken; for he transfers to himself what the Jews thought proceeded from
the prophets, and hence supposed that they were at liberty to regard as
nothing what the prophets pronounced against them: “I myself am He,”
says God, “who has spoken.” So that we must understand a contrast here
between God and the prophets; as though he had said, that the Jews in
vain slumbered in their sins, because they thought they had to do only
with mortals, since God himself had commanded his servants to denounce
the ruin that was despised.

<span id="xiv.xxx-p8"></span>But that they might not think that God had
thus spoken to cause a false alarm, (for hypocrites flatter themselves
with this pretense, that God does not speak seriously, but that he
frightens them with bugbears, as children are wont to be,) he says, that
he had *purposed*. He had said before that he had spoken, that is, by
his prophets; but what he means now by this word is, that the
predictions which he had made known as to their destruction proceeded
from his own secret counsel: “This,” he says, “has been decreed by me.”

<span id="xiv.xxx-p9"></span>He then adds, *It has not repented me, and
I will not turn from it*. He briefly shews, that the Jews were now given
up to death, that they might not think that God could be pacified as
long as they followed their vices; for God had decreed to destroy them;
and he had not only declared this by his prophets, but had also resolved
within himself to do so. By the term repent, is to be understood a
change; for God cannot, strictly speaking, repent, as nothing is hid
from him; but he speaks, as I have lately stated, after a human manner:
and every ambiguity is removed by the next phrase, when he says, *I will
not turn from it*, that is, “I will not retract my sentence.”  <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) It follows —

<span id="xiv.xxxi"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxi-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#029.md)<span id="xiv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxi-p2"></span>**29**. The whole city shall flee for the
noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb
up upon the rocks: every city *shall be* forsaken, and not a man dwell
therein.

<span id="xiv.xxxi-p3"></span>**29**. A voce equitis et jaculantis arcu
fugiet omnis civitas; penetrabunt (*vel*, ingredientur) in densitates
(*alii*, in nubes; םיבע *significat densitates*, *ut sunt loca arboribus
perplexa*, *significat etiam nubes*; *potius hic existimo accipi pro
nubibus, quia sequitur*,) ascendent in rupes (*postea*:) omnis civitas
relicta erit, et nullus vir habitabit in illis.

<span id="xiv.xxxi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xxxi-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xxxi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxi-p6"></span>By saying, that at the *voice* or sound of
*horsemen and bowmen*, there would be an universal flight, he means,
that the enemies would come with such impetuosity, that the Jews would
not dare to wait for their presence, but would flee here and there
before they were attacked: for the word *voice* or sound, no doubt, is
set here in opposition to wounds. They did swell, we know, with amazing
pride; hence the Prophet ridicules that false confidence by which they
were so inebriated as not to dread God’s judgment: “The sound alone of
enemies,” he says, “will frighten you; so that all the cities, being
left by their inhabitants, will easily fall into their hands, for walls
will not defend themselves; nay, the gates will be open.” *Flee then
will every city*; that is, all the cities will have recourse to flight.
Then it follows, *Ascend will they into the clouds*, or into
thicknesses: this may be applied to the enemies, to shew that they would
be so nimble and active as to fly, as it were, to the clouds, and climb
the highest rocks. But I prefer to connect this sentence with the
former, as intimating, that to ascend the clouds would not be too
arduous for the Jews in their anxious flight. Inasmuch as the tops of
mountains were often covered with thick trees, in order to form a dark
shade, this passage may mean, that they fled to such places. However
this may have been, the Prophet here, no doubt, refers to such high
situations. Hence, the meaning would be more evident if we retain the
word, clouds. As to what is intended, we see that that is clear; which
is, that the enemies of the Jews would in swiftness be equal to the
eagles while pursuing them; or, what is more commonly thought, that the
terror felt by the Jews would be so great, that in their flight they
would not seek recesses nigh at hand, but would flee to the highest tops
of mountains, and hide themselves there among the trees, as though they
had climbed into the clouds. They would *ascend into craggy rocks*, as
they could not think themselves otherwise safe from the attacks of their
enemies.  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md)

<span id="xiv.xxxi-p10"></span>He then adds, that *every city* would be
*forsaken*, so that *no one* would *dwell in them*. We see that the
Prophet had ever this in view — to rouse the Jews, who had deaf ears and
stony hearts, so that they felt no concern for their own calamities, and
even boldly despised God, as though they had made a covenant with death,

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p1"></span><span

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p2"></span>**30**. And *when* thou *art* spoiled,
what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though
thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face
with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; *thy* lovers will
despise thee, they will seek thy life.

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p3"></span>**30**. Et tu perdita (*aut*, vastata)

(*aut*, stybio, *ut alii vertunt*,) oculos tuos, frustra to decorabis
(*ad verbum*, pulchrificabis;) abominabuntur to amatores tui, animam
tuam quaerent.

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xxxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p6"></span>The Prophet boldly ridicules the Jews, in
order to cast down their pride and haughtiness. It was indeed his object
to check that pride with which they were elated against God. The Prophet
could not have done this without assuming a higher strain than usual,
and by rendering his discourse more striking by using metaphorical
words. It is indeed the language of derision; he exclaims, *What wilt
thou do, thou wretched one?* The Jews had hitherto been inflated with
contempt towards God, and their high spirits had not been subdued.
Since, then, their haughtiness continued untamed, the Prophet cries out
and says, “Thou wretched, what wilt thou do?” as though he had said, “In
vain do they flatter themselves and promise themselves aid from this and
from that quarter, for their condition is past any remedy.”  <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md)

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p12"></span>He afterwards adds, *Though*, etc.; for
so I consider the connection of the verse; and they seem right to me who
do not separate the words of the Prophet. But the view which others take
appears frigid, “Who now adornest thyself, who now clothest thyself in
scarlet, who adornest thyself with ornaments of gold, who paintest thy
eyes black.” To no purpose do they introduce the relative, for it
renders the meaning of the Prophet different from what it really is.

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p13"></span>These parts follow one another, and the
principal verb is found in these words, *In vain dost thou adorn
thyself;* and the particle <span id="xiv.xxxii-p13.1"></span> כיis to be
rendered “though.”

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p14"></span>There are those who consider ceremonies
to be intended, as hypocrites think that they are by these protected
against God’s judgment: but this view is unsuitable and wholly alien to
what is here set forth. It is indeed true, that ceremonies are to
hypocrites dens of thieves, as we shall hereafter see, (<span
id="xiv.xxxii-p14.1"></span>[Jer
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#011.md)<span
id="xiv.xxxii-p14.1"></span>;) but the Prophet in this place refers to
meretricious ornaments; for the people, as it had before appeared, were
become like an adulterous woman. God had formed with them as it were a
marriage — contract; they had violated it; and this perfidy was like the
defection of an adulteress, who leaves her husband and wanders here and
there, and lives as a prostitute. As then harlots, for the purpose of
enticement, are wont to dress themselves elegantly, to paint their
faces, and to use other allurements, the Prophet says, “In vain wilt
thou adorn thyself; though thou puttest on scarlet, though thou shinest
with gold even from the head to the feet, yet all this will be
superfluous and useless; and though, in addition to all this, thou
paintest thy face,  <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) it will yet
avail thee nothing.”

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p20"></span>Now, we know whom he understands by
lovers, even the Egyptians and the Assyrians. For the Jews, when
oppressed by the Egyptians, were wont to seek help from the Assyrians;
and again, when attacked by the Assyrians, they became suppliants to the
Egyptians. The prophets compared this sort of conduct to that of
strumpets; for whenever they courted the aid of either of these parties,
they broke the bond of marriage, by which they were connected with God,
and perfidiously violated their pledged faith. Hence, the Prophet says,
“Even if the Egyptians promise wonderful things to thee, as a lover
allured by thy beauty and by thy meretricious ornaments, yet they will
deceive thee; and if the Assyrians shew themselves ready to bring aid,
they also will disappoint thy hope: so that thou shalt be like a
destitute strumpet, reduced to extreme want.” I cannot finish today: I
must therefore defer the rest until to-morrow.

<span id="xiv.xxxiii"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxiii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xiv.xxxiii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that though we are
torpid in our vices, we may yet be attentive to these examples of thy
wrath, by which thou designest to warn us, so that we may learn by the
misery of others to fear thee: and may we be also attentive to those
threatenings, by which thou drawest us to thee, as thou failest to
allure us by thy kindness: and may we, in the meantime, feel assured
that thou wilt ever be propitious and merciful to all miserable sinners,
who will from the heart seek thee and sincerely and unfeignedly repent;
so that we may contend with our vices, and with real effort strive to
deliver ourselves from those snares of Satan which he ever spreads for
us, in order that we may more freely devote ourselves altogether to
thee, and take such delight in thy righteousness, that our object and
aim through the whole course of our life may be to please thee, and to
render our services approved in Christ Jesus our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xiv.xxxiv"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxiv-p1"></span>Lecture Eighteenth

<span id="xiv.xxxiv-p2"></span>WE stated, yesterday, what the Prophet
meant by the *scarlet* clothing, by the *golden* ornaments, and by the
*painting*, which he mentions, even those delusive crafts, which the
princes and the people employed in forming confederacies; for they ever
acted perfidiously. But it was also said, that the Prophet refers to the
spiritual marriage which God had formed with the people of Israel; for a
kind of adultery was committed, when they sought foreign alliances; as
they thus denied God, being not satisfied with his protection. As a wife
considers herself sufficiently protected by her husband, so the
Israelites ought to have depended on God only: but inasmuch as they ran
here and there, following their own vagrant desires, the Prophet justly
compares them to adulterous women.

<span id="xiv.xxxiv-p3"></span>But he says, that they would be an
abomination to their *lovers;* and not only so, but that both the
Egyptians and the Assyrians, in whom they foolishly trusted, would be
their worst enemies: *Hate thee,* he says, *shall thy lovers;*  <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) *yea, they will seek thy life;* that
is, those aids, by which thou thinkest to become safe and secure, will
be for thy destruction. It then follows —

<span id="xiv.xxxv"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxv-p1"></span><span id="xiv.xxxv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
4:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#031.md)<span id="xiv.xxxv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxv-p2"></span>**31**. For I have heard a voice as of a
woman in travail, *and* the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her
first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, *that* bewaileth
herself, *that* spreadeth her hands, *saying*, Woe *is* me now! for my
soul is wearied because of murderers.

<span id="xiv.xxxv-p3"></span>**31**. Certa vocem parturientis audivi,
afflictionem (*vel,* anxietatem) quasi puerperae (*vel,* parientis
primogenitum; *nam proprie hoc significat nomen*) vocem filiae Sion;
lugebit (*vel,* conqueretur, *vel,* ingemiscet,) scindet (*vel,*
extender, *ut* *alii vertunt, vel,* confliget) manus suas: Vae nunc
mihi, quia defecit anima mea propter interfectos (*alii active,* propter
interfectores.)

<span id="xiv.xxxv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.xxxv-p5"></span><span id="xiv.xxxv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxv-p6"></span>By these words Jeremiah confirms what the
latter part of the preceding verse contains: nor was it for the sake of
elucidating his subject that he enlarged on it; but when he saw his own
nation so hard and almost like stones, he employed many words and set
forth in various ways what he might have expressed in one sentence: and
what he taught would have been often coldly received, had he not added
exhortations and threatenings. It was on this account that he now
expresses in other words what he had previously said, *I have heard,* he
says, *the voice as of one in labor* This hearing, no doubt, is to be
taken consistently with the representation which had been made to him;
for Jeremiah could not hear in a way different from others; but he
speaks according to the discovery made to him of the approaching
judgment of God, which was then unheeded by the people; and he had this
discovery, that he might by such a representation as this make it known
to them. He then says, that he had *heard,* as though he had witnessed
already all that was to come. He then exaggerates the evil; for he puts
*distress,* <span id="xiv.xxxv-p6.1"></span>צרה*, tsere,* instead of
“voice,” <span id="xiv.xxxv-p6.2"></span>קול, *kul;* and then he
mentions, as an instance of greater pain, a woman bringing forth her
first — born, instead of a woman in labor. Then Jeremiah means, that
final ruin was nigh that people who could not then be restored from
their sinful courses; but he intimates, as also the Spirit speaks in
other places, that their destruction would be sudden; while they would
be saying, Peace and security, sudden destruction would come upon them.
(<span id="xiv.xxxv-p6.3"></span>[1Th
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003)<span id="xiv.xxxv-p6.3"></span>..md)
And so the Prophet now declares, that the Jews in vain hardened
themselves against God, as though their ruin was not approaching, for
their sorrow would come suddenly. As a woman may be cheerful at meat or
at her leisure, and may be suddenly seized with the pain of labor, so
also the Prophet shews, that the Jews had no reason to think that they
could escape God’s vengeance by a false confidence, for their
destruction would come upon them unexpectedly.

<span id="xiv.xxxv-p7"></span>He sets forth at the same time, as already
said, the greatness or the extremity of their grief by this similitude,
*The voice of the daughter of Sion, who complains,* etc.; for the
relative may be here added. Some take the verb to be in the second
person, “Thou wilt lament and extend, “or rend, “thy hands;” but this is
not suitable, because the third person is immediately used, “thy hands.”
Then what he says is, that the *voice of the daughter of Sion* would be
an evidence of her extreme grief, for she would lament; and he adds, at
the same time, the smiting of the hands. This verb is variously
rendered; but as <span id="xiv.xxxv-p7.1"></span>פרש, *peresh,* means
properly to rend or to divide, I think the Prophet expresses the posture
of a woman in grief; for she usually smites her hands together and as it
were divides them by putting the fingers between one another. Some
render the word “expand, “for the hands are divided when raised up. As
to what is meant, there is nothing ambiguous in the Prophet’s words; for
his object is to shew, that God’s vengeance would be so dreadful, that
the Jews would lament, not in an ordinary measure, but like women, when
in the extreme pain of labor.

<span id="xiv.xxxv-p8"></span>He then concludes by saying, *Woe to me,
for failed has my soul on account of murderers* Here the Prophet
intimates, that all the rest were blind in the midst of light, yet God’s
judgment, which the ungodly and wicked laughed at, or at least
disregarded, was seen clearly by him. *His soul,* he says, *fainted for
the slain;* and yet no one had hitherto been slain: but by this mode of
speaking, he shews, that he had as it were before his eyes what was hid
from others, and hence their hearts were not affected.  <span

<span id="fn_97"></span>[98](cc17013.htm#fr_97.md) <span
id="xiv.ii-p10.3"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p11"></span> The best rendering is that which connects
“to me” with the former clause: the end of the verse, as *Grotius*
observes, proves this. If they returned to God, they were to return from
captivity; and if they cast away their abominations, they were not to be
vagabonds or to wander any more. This seems to be the meaning. The <span
id="xiv.ii-p11.1"></span>ו before <span id="xiv.ii-p11.2"></span>לא in
the last clause is left out in ten MSS., and in the *Vulgate, Targum,*
and *Syriac.* The verse then would be as follows, —

<span id="xiv.ii-p12"></span>**1.** If thou wilt return, Israel, saith
Jehovah, to me, Thou shalt be restored, (that is, from captivity:) If
thou wilt remove thy abominations from my sight, Thou shalt not be a
wanderer.

<span id="xiv.ii-p13"></span>— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[99](cc17013.htm#fr_98.md) <span
id="xiv.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p11"></span> This is a very lucid and satisfactory
exposition. The import of the passage is very clearly given. A simpler
version may be made, and such as will exhibit the meaning more plainly.
When two *vaus* occur, they may often be rendered, *when* and *then*: so
*here,* —

<span id="xiv.iii-p12"></span>**2.** When thou shalt swear, “Live does
Jehovah,” In truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; Then call him
blessed shall nations, And in him shall they glory.

<span id="xiv.iii-p13"></span>To swear is to avow Jehovah as our God.
The verbs “bless” and “glory” are both in Hithpael, which has commonly a
reciprocal sense, but not always. See <span
id="xiv.iii-p13.1"></span>[Ps
72:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017.md)<span id="xiv.iii-p13.1"></span>;
<span id="xiv.iii-p13.2"></span>[Ps
105:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#003.md)<span id="xiv.iii-p13.2"></span>.
This and the preceding verse belong to the last chapter. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[100](cc17013.htm#fr_99.md) <span
id="xiv.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p8"></span> Literally, “Plough for yourselves the
ploughing,“ or, the plough-land; or, “Fallow for yourselves the fallow.”
They were not to sow a land once ploughed; but they were to plough
again. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[101](cc17013.htm#fr_100.md) <span
id="xiv.v-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.v-p12"></span> Rather, “On account of the evil of your
doings.” Their doings were evil or wrong, both as to God and man.
Impiety seems to be the special evil intended, as their defection from
God had been more particularly referred to. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[102](cc17013.htm#fr_101.md) <span
id="xiv.vi-p12.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.vi-p13"></span> These two verses contain a very spirited
address, in a style truly poetical, —

<span id="xiv.vi-p14"></span>**5.** Announce ye in Judah, And in
Jerusalem publish, and say, — Yea, sound the trumpet in the land,
Proclaim, do it fully, and say, — “Be assembled, and let us enter into
fortified cities;

<span id="xiv.vi-p15"></span>**6.** Raise a banner towards Sion; Hasten
ye, stay not:“ For an evil am I bringing from the north, And a great
destruction.

<span id="xiv.vi-p16"></span>The people of Judah were summoned to enter
into fortified cities, and Mount Sion was to be the resort of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem: “Hasten ye,“ <span
id="xiv.vi-p16.1"></span>σπεύσατε — hasten, *Septuagint.* This is the
meaning of <span id="xiv.vi-p16.2"></span>עז in Hiphil. See <span
id="xiv.vi-p16.3"></span>[Ex 9:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#019.md)<span
id="xiv.vi-p16.3"></span>; <span id="xiv.vi-p16.4"></span>[Isa
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#031.md)<span id="xiv.vi-p16.4"></span>.
In <span id="xiv.vi-p16.5"></span>[Jer
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#001.md)<span id="xiv.vi-p16.5"></span>, it
is translated “Gather yourselves to flee;” but “hasten,” or remove
vigorously or quickly, would be the best rendering. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_102"></span>[103](cc17013.htm#fr_102.md) <span
id="xiv.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ix-p8"></span> The word “thicket, “in our version,
correctly expresses it; a tangled wood, where trees cross and entwine
with each other. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[104](cc17013.htm#fr_103.md) <span
id="xiv.ix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ix-p10"></span> “Laid waste” is the Chaldee sense; but the
verb means in Hebrew to germinate, to produce grass, to grow over with
grass as ruined cities do. The words which follow, “without an
inhabitant,“ shew that this meaning suits here, —

<span id="xiv.ix-p11"></span>Thy cities shall grow over with grass,
without an inhabitant.

<span id="xiv.ix-p12"></span>The *Targum* is,

<span id="xiv.ix-p13"></span>Thy cities shall be desolate without an
inhabitant.

<span id="xiv.ix-p14"></span>— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[105](cc17013.htm#fr_104.md) <span
id="xiv.xi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xi-p10"></span> Though the most common meaning of <span
id="xiv.xi-p10.1"></span>לב, heart, is what is here stated, yet it means
also strength, firmness, courage. See <span
id="xiv.xi-p10.2"></span>[Deut. 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/deu020.htm#003.md)<span id="xiv.xi-p10.2"></span>;
<span id="xiv.xi-p10.3"></span>[2Sa
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#010.md)<span id="xiv.xi-p10.3"></span>;
<span id="xiv.xi-p10.4"></span>[Ps
22:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#014.md)<span id="xiv.xi-p10.4"></span>;
<span id="xiv.xi-p10.5"></span>[Ps
73:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#026.md)<span id="xiv.xi-p10.5"></span>.
And this meaning is most suitable to this passage. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_105"></span>[106](cc17013.htm#fr_105.md) <span
id="xiv.xi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xi-p12"></span> The verse is as follows, —

<span id="xiv.xi-p13"></span>And it shall be in that day, saith Jehovah,
That perish shall the heart of the king And the heart of the princes,
And confounded shall be the priests, And the prophets shall be
astonished.

<span id="xiv.xi-p14"></span>“Confounded,” that is, like persons at
their wit’s end, not knowing what to do, or what course to take.
“Astonished,” or amazed, that is, at witnessing the reverse of what they
had prophesied; being filled with stunning and stupefying amazement. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[107](cc17013.htm#fr_106.md) <span
id="xiv.xii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xii-p10"></span> There are various expositions of this
verse: but the simpler and the plainer mode would be to take <span
id="xiv.xii-p10.1"></span>אמר as a noun, word, speech, saying, with an
auxiliary verb, which is commonly omitted in Hebrew. The connection with
the foregoing would be obvious and natural, —

<span id="xiv.xii-p11"></span>And the saying will be, “Alas! Lord
Jehovah, Surely, deceiving thou hast deceived This people and Jerusalem,
By saying, ‘Peace shall be to you;’ And reach does the sword even to the
soul.”

<span id="xiv.xii-p12"></span>This would be the language of such as
believed the false prophets, and considered them as sent by God.

<span id="xiv.xii-p13"></span>But *Lowth, Henry, Venema, Scott,* and
others, take this view, — that God had permitted or suffered the people
to be deceived by the false prophets. It is said that this verb in
Hiphil, as the case is here, has sometimes this meaning, and *Lowth*
refers, as instances, to <span id="xiv.xii-p13.1"></span>[Isa
63:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#017.md)<span id="xiv.xii-p13.1"></span>,
and also to <span id="xiv.xii-p13.2"></span>[Ps
119:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#010.md)<span
id="xiv.xii-p13.2"></span>; <span id="xiv.xii-p13.3"></span>[Pr
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#003.md)<span id="xiv.xii-p13.3"></span>.
But the *sentiment* of the passage in this case would not be very
suitable: for, according to this view, the cause of the Prophet’s grief
is, that God had suffered the people to be deceived.

<span id="xiv.xii-p14"></span>“It shall be said,” in the next verse,
seems to be put in contrast with this “saying.” Instead of what would be
commonly said of the people, God reminds them of what he would cause to
be said and effected. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[108](cc17013.htm#fr_107.md) <span
id="xiv.xiii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xiii-p13"></span> The *Septuagint* version of these two
verses is as foreign to the original as it can well be; and the *Syriac*
and *Arabic* are nearly the same. The *Vulgate* gives a fair version;
and the meaning, as given by the *Targum,* is nearly the same. The
latter part of the 11th and 12th are thus rendered by *Blayney,* —

<span id="xiv.xiii-p14"></span>A wind that scorcheth the plains in the
wilderness, \[Shall come\] toward the daughter of my people, Not to
winnow, nor to cleanse;

<span id="xiv.xiii-p15"></span>**12.** A full wind for a curse shall
come at my bidding; Now even I will proceed judicially with them.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p16"></span>*Horsley* differs as to the 11th verse,
and renders it thus, —

<span id="xiv.xiii-p17"></span>The wind that scorcheth the craggy rocks
of the wilderness Taketh its course against the daughter of my people,
Not for winnowing or cleansing.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p18"></span>The reason assigned for rendering <span
id="xiv.xiii-p18.1"></span>מאלה for “a curse,” and not “from those
*places*,“ as in our version, is, because the enemy did not come from
that quarter. But this may be avoided, if we consider “as” or “like” to
be understood before wind, which is no uncommon thing in Hebrew. To
refer “those” or these to the winds implied in winnowing and cleansing,
as *Calvin* does, and also *Gataker* and others, is not satisfactory, I
would propose the following version, —

<span id="xiv.xiii-p19"></span>The dry wind of the cliffs in the
wilderness Is advancing against the daughter of my people, Not to
winnow, nor to cleanse;

<span id="xiv.xiii-p20"></span>**12.** *As* a full wind from these, it
shall come for me: Then will I myself pronounce judgments on them.

<span id="xiv.xiii-p21"></span>The word <span
id="xiv.xiii-p21.1"></span>דרך, as *Horsley* takes it, is a verb, or
rather a participle; and it is usual in Hebrew to put a participle in
the first clause, and in the second a verb, as here, in the future
tense. The verb means to come upon, so as to tread down or subdue, <span
id="xiv.xiii-p21.2"></span>[Jud
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#021.md)<span id="xiv.xiii-p21.2"></span>;
<span id="xiv.xiii-p21.3"></span>[Jud
20:43](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#043.md)<span

91:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#013.md)<span
id="xiv.xiii-p21.4"></span>. “The effect of this wind is not only to
render the air extremely hot and scorching, but to fill it with
poisonous and suffocating vapors.” — *Blayney.* — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_108"></span>[109](cc17013.htm#fr_108.md) <span
id="xiv.xiv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xiv-p10"></span> Rather, “We have been wholly wasted,“ or
desolated. The verb is in a reduplicate form, and signifies an entire
waste or desolation, —

<span id="xiv.xiv-p11"></span>**13.** Behold, like clouds will he
ascend, And like a whirlwind will be his chariots, Swifter than eagles
his horses: “Woe to us! for we have been wholly wasted.”

<span id="xiv.xiv-p12"></span>The mixture of the tenses is intended to
shew the certainty of the event. Or we may consider the last line as
containing what would be said after the coming of the enemy. What they
would have to say was to acknowledge their entire desolation. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[110](cc17013.htm#fr_109.md) <span
id="xiv.xv-p9.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.xv-p10"></span> The word means also iniquity, wickedness:
and this is the sense in which the *Vulgate* and the *Targum* have taken
it, and also *Blayney, “*the devices of thine iniquity:“ and this
corresponds more with the former part of the verse. The whole is as
follows, —

<span id="xiv.xv-p11"></span>**14.** Wash from evil thine heart, O
Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved: How long shall lodge within thee
The thoughts of thy wickedness,

<span id="xiv.xv-p12"></span>Or,

<span id="xiv.xv-p13"></span>Thy wicked thoughts.

<span id="xiv.xv-p14"></span>The word for “wash” here, according to
*Parkhurst,* is ever applied to express a thorough washing, the washing
away of what is inherent, such as the dirt of linen and of clothes: and
he says, that there is another word, <span id="xiv.xv-p14.1"></span>רחף,
which is used when the washing of the surface of anything is intended,
such as the washing of hands. “Shall lodge,” — it is no objection that
this is singular, and the “thoughts” plural. It is an idiom: the same
exists in *Welsh:* and in no other form would this sentence be rendered
in that language. The present translation is incorrect, as the verb is
taken to be in the second person, and applied to Jerusalem; which cannot
be, as in that case it must have been in the feminine gender. The
correct rendering would be, —

<span id="xiv.xv-p15"></span><span id="xiv.xv-p15.1"></span>Pa hyd y
hetya o’th fewn Dy feddyliau drygionus!

<span id="xiv.xv-p16"></span>If the verb had *followed* its nominative
case, it would have been in the same number; but as it precedes it, it
is singular while the noun is plural. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[111](cc17013.htm#fr_110.md) <span
id="xiv.xviii-p8.3"></span>

<span id="xiv.xviii-p9"></span> The first meaning of the word is
iniquity, wickedness; and as the fruit or the effect of wickedness is
affliction, distress, misery, it is sometimes taken to express the
latter idea. It may be rendered here, distress. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[112](cc17013.htm#fr_111.md) <span
id="xiv.xix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xix-p7"></span> The verb in the first sentence followed by
<span id="xiv.xix-p7.1"></span>ל is found in <span
id="xiv.xix-p7.2"></span>[Am 6:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#010.md)<span
id="xiv.xix-p7.2"></span>; where it clearly means “to make mention of,“
or simply, to mention. So it may be rendered here, “Make ye mention of
the nations,“ or, Mention the nations, that is, for the sake of
frightening the Jews. He had before referred to the voice from Dan,
etc.; he now commands the invading nations to be proclaimed as
approaching. The meaning is not, as *Blayney*, as well as *Calvin*,
renders the phrase, “Proclaim ye unto the nations,“ but, “Proclaim the
nations,“ as approaching, according to what is afterwards stated. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_112"></span>[113](cc17013.htm#fr_112.md) <span
id="xiv.xix-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xix-p11"></span> To make this verse consistent with the
context, I render it as follows, —

<span id="xiv.xix-p12"></span>Mention ye the nations, (and say,) “Behold
*them*!” Repeat at Jerusalem, “The watchers are coming from a distant
land, And shall raise against the cities of Judah their voice.”

<span id="xiv.xix-p13"></span>It is not improbable that <span
id="xiv.xix-p13.1"></span>על here means “over,” and that the “voice”
means a triumphant shout, as *Calvin* seems to have thought. Then we may
give this rendering, —

<span id="xiv.xix-p14"></span>And shall raise over the cities of Judah
their shout.

<span id="xiv.xix-p15"></span>— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[114](cc17013.htm#fr_113.md) <span
id="xiv.xx-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xx-p8"></span> Calvin has followed the *Vulgate* and the
*Syriac*. The *Septuagint* and *Arabic* have, “thou hast neglected me,“
which is very wide from the original. “Rebel” is the rendering of the
*Targum*, which is the Hebrew, and there is no other reading. Literally
it is,

<span id="xiv.xx-p9"></span>For against me hath she rebelled, saith
Jehovah.

<span id="xiv.xx-p10"></span>And this is the rendering of *Blayney*. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[115](cc17013.htm#fr_114.md) <span
id="xiv.xxi-p8.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxi-p9"></span> *Blayney*, contrary to all the early
versions, renders <span id="xiv.xxi-p9.1"></span>אלה, “a curse,“ instead
of “these,“ but there is no sufficient reason for the change. It is
difficult to see what is the precise idea intended in our version as to
the latter part of the verse. The meaning given by Calvin seems to be
this, — that though the visitation was bitter and reached to the heart,
it was yet to be ascribed to their wickedness. *Blayney’s* version is
this, —

<span id="xiv.xxi-p10"></span>Such is thy calamity; for it is
bitterness;  
for it is a plague even unto thy heart.

<span id="xiv.xxi-p11"></span>The latter words are taken as explanatory
of the calamity. The word <span id="xiv.xxi-p11.1"></span>רעה does
indeed mean sometimes a calamity; but all the early versions, as well as
the Targum, render it here “wickedness.” Hence the most suitable
rendering would be, —

<span id="xiv.xxi-p12"></span>Such is thy wickedness!  
Though bitter, though reaching to thy heart.

<span id="xiv.xxi-p13"></span>That <span id="xiv.xxi-p13.1"></span>כי
may be rendered “though” is evident from <span
id="xiv.xxi-p13.2"></span>[Jos
17:18](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#018.md)<span id="xiv.xxi-p13.2"></span>;
and it ought to be so rendered in <span id="xiv.xxi-p13.3"></span>[Ex
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#009.md)<span id="xiv.xxi-p13.3"></span>;
and in other places. But we may take the first <span
id="xiv.xxi-p13.4"></span> כיin its primary sense, surely, certainly,
truly, and the second as a causative, for, because; an instance of a
similar kind we meet in <span id="xiv.xxi-p13.5"></span>[Ex
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#017.md)<span id="xiv.xxi-p13.5"></span>:
the first <span id="xiv.xxi-p13.6"></span> כיprecedes an adjective, and
is rendered “Although;” and the second <span
id="xiv.xxi-p13.7"></span>כי, a verb, and is rendered “for.” Then our
version would be, —

<span id="xiv.xxi-p14"></span>Such is thy wickedness (that is, its
effect)!  
Surely, bitter; for it reaches to thy heart.

<span id="xiv.xxi-p15"></span>— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[116](cc17013.htm#fr_115.md) <span
id="xiv.xxii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxii-p9"></span> Remarkably concise and striking are the
words of this verse, —

<span id="xiv.xxii-p10"></span>My bowels! my bowels! I am in pain! O the
enclosures of my heart! Turbulent is my heart within me; I will not be
silent; for the sound of the trumpet Have I heard; my soul, the shout of
battle.

<span id="xiv.xxii-p11"></span>To change the person of the verb, “I am
in pain,” or in labor, as it literally means, as *Blayney* does,
destroys the force and the vehemence of the passage; and all the early
versions retain the first person. “The enclosures,” literally “the
walls,” that is, what encloses or surrounds the heart, he mentions first
the bowels, then what surrounds the heart, and afterwards the heart
itself: and his pain was like that of a woman in travail. Being in this
state, he resolved not to be silent but to declare their danger to the
people. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[117](cc17013.htm#fr_116.md) <span
id="xiv.xxiii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxiii-p7"></span> The literal reading may be thus, —

<span id="xiv.xxiii-p8"></span>Breach upon breach has happened; For laid
waste has been the whole land; Suddenly laid waste have been my tents,
In a moment my curtains.

<span id="xiv.xxiii-p9"></span>He relates what he had seen in a vision,
and therefore represents the whole as past. The verb <span
id="xiv.xxiii-p9.1"></span>קרא in Niphal as here, as well as in Kal,
means sometimes to happen, to befall, to take place. The *Syriac* and
the *Targum* give it here this meaning; and *Blayney* has adopted the
same. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_117"></span>[118](cc17013.htm#fr_117.md) <span
id="xiv.xxv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxv-p12"></span> The *specific* meaning of the terms used
in this verse is not given in our version, nor by *Calvin*, nor by
*Blayney*. The following, as I apprehend, is a literal version, —

<span id="xiv.xxv-p13"></span>For stupid *are* my people, Me they do not
know; Foolish children *are* they, And undiscerning *are* they; Wise
*are* they to do evil, But how to do good they know not.

<span id="xiv.xxv-p14"></span>“Stupid,” <span
id="xiv.xxv-p14.1"></span>אויל, is one grossly ignorant, so as to be
without knowledge, and not capable of knowing how to do good, or what is
the good to be done. The last line explains the two first. Then
“foolish,” <span id="xiv.xxv-p14.2"></span>סכלים, are the perverse, or
the perverted, who are foolish through a perverted mind, who are said in
the next line to be undiscerning, and who, as in the line which follows,
had wisdom enough to do evil. They were stupidly ignorant, and
perversely foolish. They were ignorant as to good, and wise as to evil;
but this their wisdom was folly. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_118"></span>[119](cc17013.htm#fr_118.md) <span
id="xiv.xxviii-p13.5"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p14"></span> These two words are viewed as
synonymous by some, and the versions render them often by the same
terms. As to the first, <span id="xiv.xxviii-p14.1"></span>תהו, there
can be no doubt as to its meaning, for it occurs about twenty times, and
in all these places the idea of emptiness is chiefly conveyed: hence it
is most commonly rendered in our version, vain, vanity, in vain, nought,
etc., <span id="xiv.xxviii-p14.2"></span>[1Sa
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1012.htm#021.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.2"></span>; <span id="xiv.xxviii-p14.3"></span>[Isa
40:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#017.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.3"></span>; <span id="xiv.xxviii-p14.4"></span>[Isa
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.4"></span>; <span id="xiv.xxviii-p14.5"></span>[Isa
49:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#004.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.5"></span>. It is improperly rendered “without form,“
in <span id="xiv.xxviii-p14.6"></span>[Ge
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.6"></span>, and “confusion” in <span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.7"></span>[Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.7"></span>. When applied to the earth, as in <span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.8"></span>[Ge
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.8"></span>, it imports emptiness, as it was then
unfurnished either with productions or with any inhabitants. This
appears evident from <span id="xiv.xxviii-p14.9"></span>[Isa
45:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#018.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.9"></span>, “He created it not in vain,“ rather, “not
empty did he create it — <span id="xiv.xxviii-p14.10"></span>לא-תהו
בראה;” “he formed it to be inhabited,“ or more literally, “for a
habitation he formed it.” As to the other word, <span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.11"></span>בוו, it only occurs three times, <span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.12"></span>[Ge
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.12"></span>; <span id="xiv.xxviii-p14.13"></span>[Isa
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#011.md)<span
id="xiv.xxviii-p14.13"></span>; and here. As the former evidently means
emptiness, this may be taken to mean confusion or chaos, according to
*Symmachus*, “<span id="xiv.xxviii-p14.14"></span>συγκεχυμένη, —
confused.” Then the right rendering here would be, —

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p15"></span>**23.** I looked on the land, And
behold emptiness and confusion; And towards the heavens, And *they were*
without their light.

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p16"></span>It is not the earth, but the land of
Judea is what is meant. The whole passage being so striking, shall be
here given, —

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p17"></span>**24.** I looked at the mountains, And,
behold, they were shaking, And all the hills made quick motions:

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p18"></span>**25.** I looked, and, behold, there
was no man; And every bird of heaven had fled away:

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p19"></span>**26.** I looked, and, behold, Carmel a
desert; And all its cities had been demolished By the presence of
Jehovah, By the indignation of his wrath.

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p20"></span>The whole is represented as already
done. The Prophet speaks of what he had seen in the vision. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[120](cc17013.htm#fr_119.md) <span
id="xiv.xxviii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxviii-p28"></span> All the early versions, as well as the
*Targum*, retain the word “Carmel.” *Blayney* renders it “the fruitful
field.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[121](cc17013.htm#fr_120.md) <span
id="xiv.xxix-p9.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxix-p10"></span> All the early versions and the *Targum*
favor the former view, as they all render the sentence, “Yet a
consummation I will not make.” *Gataker* mentions another explanation,
“I will not yet make a full end” with you; that is, I will punish you
yet farther: and reference is made to <span
id="xiv.xxix-p10.2"></span>[Jer
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#018.md)<span id="xiv.xxix-p10.2"></span>.
This view is adopted by *Blayney* and *Scott*. But the former view is no
doubt the right one; for this is the meaning of the phrase as found in
other places; see <span id="xiv.xxix-p10.3"></span>[Jer
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011.md)<span
id="xiv.xxix-p10.3"></span>; where it is clear that <span
id="xiv.xxix-p10.4"></span>כלה עשה is wholly to destroy. See also <span
id="xiv.xxix-p10.5"></span>[Ne
9:31](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#031.md)<span id="xiv.xxix-p10.5"></span>;
<span id="xiv.xxix-p10.6"></span>[Eze
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#013.md)<span
id="xiv.xxix-p10.6"></span>; <span id="xiv.xxix-p10.7"></span>[Eze
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#017.md)<span
id="xiv.xxix-p10.7"></span>; <span id="xiv.xxix-p10.8"></span>[Na
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#009.md)<span id="xiv.xxix-p10.8"></span>.
The meaning then is, “Yet I will not make an entire destruction.”
*Henry* takes this view, and *Lowth* seems to prefer it. Indeed the
phrase has no other meaning wherever it is used. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_121"></span>[122](cc17013.htm#fr_121.md) <span
id="xiv.xxx-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxx-p10"></span> The latter part is very concise, —

<span id="xiv.xxx-p11"></span>Because I have said, I have purposed, And
have not repented, And I will not turn from it.

<span id="xiv.xxx-p12"></span>The turning refers to what he had said,
and repentance to the purpose. *Blayney* followed the *Septuagint*, and
changed the order of the words, and thus destroyed the right connection
of the passage, and the common parallelism of the language. We may also
notice this passage as an instance of what is often found both in the
Old Testament, and also in the New, — that when two or more things are
consecutively stated, the most obvious, the most apparent, is mentioned
first, and then the most hidden, or what is in order previous. Purpose
is first in order, but speaking is first mentioned. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[123](cc17013.htm#fr_122.md) <span
id="xiv.xxxi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxi-p7"></span> The verbs in this are all in the past
tense, as in some former instances. The Prophet had already seen in a
vision what he here states, —

<span id="xiv.xxxi-p8"></span>At the voice (or sound) of the rider and
of the handler of the bow, Flee did every city; They went into thickets,
and into cliffs they climbed; Every city was forsaken, And dwell in them
did no man.

<span id="xiv.xxxi-p9"></span>The word for “thickets” means sometimes
“clouds.” The verb signifies to be dense, thick, gross, bulky: but the
plural noun means a thick wood, as well as a thick or dense mass of
vapors, which form clouds. It is rendered “<span
id="xiv.xxxi-p9.1"></span>ἄλση, — forests,“ by the *Septuagint* and
*Syriac*; and “<span id="xiv.xxxi-p9.2"></span>sylvas — woods,” by the
*Targum*. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_123"></span>[124](cc17013.htm#fr_123.md) <span
id="xiv.xxxii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p7"></span> The words “thou wretched,“ or, more
commonly, “thou spoiled,“ are left out in the *Septuagint* and *Arabic*,
and are retained in this sense by the *Vulgate*, *Syriac*, and the
*Targum*. But, as *Blayney* justly says, it is a rendering that is not
correct. “Thou,“ as in the received text, is feminine, and “spoiled” is
masculine. The *Keri* and many MSS. have <span
id="xiv.xxxii-p7.1"></span>את instead of <span
id="xiv.xxxii-p7.2"></span>אתי; and <span
id="xiv.xxxii-p7.3"></span>שדוד, as *Blayney* supposes, is not a passive
participle, but a verb in the infinitive mood, used as a noun. So he
gives this version, —

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p8"></span>And against spoiling what wilt thou do?

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p9"></span>The word “spoiled,” or wasted, may indeed
refer to “every city,” mentioned in the former verse, and the word for
city is masculine. We may then render thus, —

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p10"></span>And the city being wasted, what wilt
thou do?

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p11"></span>“The *city*” may be deemed as the
poetical singular for the plural. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[125](cc17013.htm#fr_124.md) <span
id="xiv.xxxii-p14.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p15"></span> The *Septuagint*, the *Vulgate*, and
the *Targum* give this rendering, —

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p16"></span>“Though thou paintest with stibium thine
eyes.”

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p17"></span>The Hebrew literally is, as it is
rendered by *Blayney*, —

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p18"></span>Though thou distendest with paint thy
eyes.

<span id="xiv.xxxii-p19"></span>The verb <span
id="xiv.xxxii-p19.1"></span>קרע, means first to rend, to divide, and
then to divide in the sense of distending or enlarging. Large eyes were
considered a beauty, and women used a sort of paint, or rather powder,
for the purpose of enlarging them. See *Lowth’s* note on <span
id="xiv.xxxii-p19.2"></span>[Isa
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md)<span
id="xiv.xxxii-p19.2"></span>, and *Parkhurst* under the word <span
id="xiv.xxxii-p19.3"></span>פך. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_125"></span>[126](cc17013.htm#fr_125.md) <span
id="xiv.xxxiv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxiv-p4"></span> Rather, —

<span id="xiv.xxxiv-p5"></span>Rejected thee have paramours.

<span id="xiv.xxxiv-p6"></span>This is the meaning of the verb when
followed as here by <span id="xiv.xxxiv-p6.1"></span>ב. See note on
<span id="xiv.xxxiv-p6.2"></span>[Jer
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#037.md)<span id="xiv.xxxiv-p6.2"></span>.
The word for paramours means not lovers, but lewd or mad lovers. The
verb is rendered “to dote upon,” <span id="xiv.xxxiv-p6.3"></span>[Eze
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#012.md)<span
id="xiv.xxxiv-p6.3"></span>. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_126"></span>[127](cc17013.htm#fr_126.md) <span
id="xiv.xxxv-p8.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.xxxv-p9"></span> This latter part is differently taken by
most. It is considered to be the confession of the daughter of Sion. The
whole verse is remarkably striking, —

<span id="xiv.xxxv-p10"></span>For the voice as of one in travail have I
heard, The distress as of one giving birth to a first-born, The voice of
the daughter of Sion; *Who* pants for breath, *who* spreads her hands, —
“Wo now to me, For melted has my soul because of murderers.”

<span id="xiv.xxxv-p11"></span>It is a common thing in Hebrew to omit
the relative “*who,“* before a verb in a future tense, especially when
it means the present time. The scene is described as present. The
passage might be expressed in *Welsh* without the relative. “*Who* pants
for breath,” is rendered by *Horsley, “*that draweth her breath short;”
and he adds, “The passage is a most affecting picture of the last
struggles of a woman expiring in labor.” — *Ed*.
