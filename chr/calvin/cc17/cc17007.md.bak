*Calvin's Commentaries, Vol. 17: Jeremiah and Lamentations, Part I*, tr.
by John King, \[1847-50\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

<span id="viii-p1"></span>THE PRINTER TO THE CHRISTIAN READER,

<span id="viii-p2"></span>HEALTH.

<span id="viii-p3"></span>Though Readers were sufficiently reminded,
when the Lectures of the beloved and learned John Calvin, on The Minor
Prophets and on Daniel, were published, by what means and by whom they
had been attained, so that it is to no purpose to sing the same song,
for so would I seem to do, were I again to explain at large what has
been before set forth; it is yet necessary, if I am not mistaken, to add
now, that these Lectures On Jeremiah and the Lamentations were taken
down by our two brethren, *John Budeus* and *Charles Jonville,* with the
same care, fidelity, and diligence as the former Lectures, which cannot
but appear to every one who will attentively read them.

<span id="viii-p4"></span>The Hebrew Text has not been inserted; and
among other things, for this reason, because it is already possessed by
those who understand the language, and to others it would be of no
advantage. We were also afraid, that by increasing the Volume and the
expense, we should unnecessarily charge the buyer.

<span id="viii-p5"></span>But that I may not be prolix and tedious, I
pass by the great and manifold benefit that may be derived from this
Volume, which will appear to each one better when it is read: for it is
so replete with the precious wealth of heavenly Truth, that from it, as
from a storehouse, may be drawn the sum and substance of Religion; and
so it will no doubt be of great service to the whole Church of God.

<span id="viii-p6"></span>It remains for you, Christian Reader, to
ascribe to God alone whatever benefit you may derive from these
Commentaries; and to pray for Calvin, who well deserves this from all
the godly, until he shall at length enjoy his eternal inheritance. Make
use also thankfully of this so valuable a treasure, and judge kindly and
impartially of what is cordially presented to you.

<span id="viii-p7"></span>GENEVA, *July* 23, 1576.
