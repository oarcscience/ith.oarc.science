<span id="vi-p1"></span>TO THE NOBLE

<span id="vi-p2"></span>AND VERTVOVS LADY,

<span id="vi-p3"></span>THE LADY LVCIE, COVNTESSE

<span id="vi-p4"></span>of Bedford: And to the Right Honorable and
highly honored Lady, the Lady *Anne Harrington,* Barrones: mercy  
*and peace be multiplied*

<span id="vi-p5"></span>*Right Honorable:* The holy Prophet *Jeremiah*
(according to the diuers subjects he had to work upon in his ministerial
function) is forced sometimes, with *Isaiah* his forerunner, to lift up
his voice like unto a *Sonne of Thunder;* (<span
id="vi-p5.1"></span>[Isa 58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi-p5.1"></span>) and eftsoones, with the same Prophet againe, to
altar and change the same into the still and soft voice of a *Sonne of
Consolation:* (<span id="vi-p5.2"></span>[1Ki
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#020)<span id="vi-p5.2"></span>.md)
wherein, as God’s faithful messenger, hee carries himself faithfully:
For as a *Sonne of Thunder,* he sharply inueyes against the sinnes and
sinners of his time, boldly denouncing God’s judgements against them;
and as *a Sonne of Consolation,* (for their sakes whom the Lord had
appointed to bee heires of sahation,) hee sweetly preacheth Christ,
mixing often with the terrible threats of the Law the sauing promises of
the Gospel; that if any came, by the ministry of the one, to be pricked
in conscience and humbled, (<span id="vi-p5.3"></span>[Ac
2:37](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037)<span id="vi-p5.3"></span>.md) he
readily, like the good Samaritan, powreth in the mollifying and healing
oyle of the other to cure and reuiue them. And thus, as a wise disposer
and dispenser of the manifold secrets of God, (<span
id="vi-p5.4"></span>[Ps 101:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa101.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi-p5.4"></span>) his song (in a manner) throughout his Prophesy
(like *Aaron’s* Bels — <span id="vi-p5.5"></span>[Ex
28:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#033)<span id="vi-p5.5"></span>.md)
soundeth forth judgement and mercy; preaching judgement to such as were
and would be sinners in Sion, (<span id="vi-p5.6"></span>[Isa
33:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#014)<span id="vi-p5.6"></span>.md) and
mercy to such as he saw to be mourners in Sion. (<span
id="vi-p5.7"></span>[Isa 61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi-p5.7"></span>). In which respects he may serue as a liuely
patterne for all Preachers to follow in their ordinary course of
preaching. These Sermons of his (many of them) doe notably sute to our
times; and therefore ought to be read, and read againe, of all estates
high and low.

<span id="vi-p6"></span>But for as much as in reading the Prophets
sundry difficulties are met withall, which euery one hath not the skill
of himself to dissolue, it would (as I think) be very beneficial for
such if they had an holy helper, such an one as this, ready at hand: *An
interpreter; One* (indeed) *of a thousand*, (<span
id="vi-p6.1"></span>[Job 33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi-p6.1"></span>) that might help to dissolve their doubts, and
unloose their hard knots for them; that so understanding what they read,
they might (by the blessing of God) with the more ease come to profit by
their reading. This hath our *Philip* (<span id="vi-p6.2"></span>[Ac
8:34-35](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#034)<span id="vi-p6.2"></span>.md)
faithfully performed (according to that light of understanding wherewith
the Lord had extraordinarily endowed him) throughout the Prophets; and
pity it is that so great light should after a sort he buried in darkness
from many well minded Christians, onely because they are not (as they
might be) turned into our owne natiue language.

<span id="vi-p7"></span>Not many yeeres since, a Lampe (if I may so
speake) began to be kindled, for giuing them some insight into the
harder passages of the Prophets, by translating this Author’s
Commentaries vpon the Prophecie of *Isaiah* into English; but much more
cleere would the light haue now shined if thereunto had been added the
translation of all his Lectures vpon the Prophesie of *Ieremiah* also.
For mine owne part, seeing sufficiency of oyle hath failed me to furnish
out this second Lampe vnto the end, I haue for the present proceeded
onely through the flue first Chapters.

<span id="vi-p8"></span>The which (Right Honorable) as a testimony of
that seruice and duty I owe your Honors, I have presumed (as one
ouertaken with *Ahimaaz* his hast, sorewhat abruptly, I confesse) to
dedicate vnto you: And if in token of your favorable acceptance thereof
you shall be pleased to suffer the same to passe vnder your Honorable
names and patronage, many may be occasioned thereby to blesse God for
you, and my selfe still to pray, that the blessing of him who was ready
to perish may come vpon you.

<span id="vi-p9"></span>Your Honor’s humbly  
at commandment,

<span id="vi-p10"></span>CLEMENT COTTON.
