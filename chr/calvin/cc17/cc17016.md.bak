<span id="xvii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 7

<span id="xvii.i"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p1"></span><span id="xvii.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#001.md)<span id="xvii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p2"></span>**1**. The word that came to Jeremiah from
the Lord, saying,

<span id="xvii.i-p3"></span>**1**. Sermo qui datus fuit Jeremiae (qui
factus fuit ad Jeremiam, qui datus fuit, *ad verbum*) a Jehova, dicendo,

<span id="xvii.i-p4"></span>**2**. Stand in the gate of the Lord’s
house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the Lord,
all *ye of* Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the Lord

<span id="xvii.i-p5"></span>**2**. Sta in porta domus Jehovae (*hoc
est*, Templum,) et clama illic hunc sermonem (*hoc est*, vociferare hunc
sermonem, *vel*, cum clamore prefer,) et dicas, Audite sermonem Jehovae
cunctus Jehudah, qui ingredimini per has portas, ut adoretis Jehovam:

<span id="xvii.i-p6"></span>**3**. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God
of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to
dwell in this place.

<span id="xvii.i-p7"></span>**3**. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus
Israel, Bonas facite vias vestras et studia vestra, et habitabo vobiscum
in hoc loco;

<span id="xvii.i-p8"></span>**4**. Trust ye not in lying words, saying,
The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord,
*are* these.

<span id="xvii.i-p9"></span>**4**. Ne confidatis vobis (*hoc est*, ne
vobis fiduciam ponatis, *vel*, adjiciatis vobis fiduciam) ad verba
mendacii, dicendo, Templum Jehovae, Templum Jehovae, Templum Jehovae
sunt.

<span id="xvii.i-p10"></span> 

<span id="xvii.i-p11"></span><span id="xvii.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p12"></span>Here the Prophet gives a short account of
the sermon, in which he severely reproved the people, because his labor
had been useless, though he had sharply and severely reproved them. He
says then, that he had a command from above to *stand at the gate* of
the Temple. This was indeed usually done by the prophets: but God seems
to have intended that this reproof should be heard by all. He says
further, that he was commanded to address the *whole* tribe of *Judah*

<span id="xvii.i-p13"></span>It is hence probable, and what may be
easily concluded, that this discourse was delivered on a feast — day,
when there was the usual assembly of the people. He could not indeed
have made this address on other days; for then the inhabitants of the
city only frequented the Temple. But on the feast — days they usually
came from the neighboring towns and from the whole country to celebrate
God’s rightful worship, which had been prescribed in the law. Since then
Jeremiah addressed the whole tribe of Judah, we hence conclude, that he
spoke not only to the inhabitants of the city, but also to the whole
tribe, which came together to keep the feast — day.

<span id="xvii.i-p14"></span>Now the object of his sermon was, to exhort
them seriously to repent, if they wished God to be reconciled to them.
So the Prophet shews, that God did not regard their sacrifices and
external rites, and that this was not the way, as they thought, of
appeasing him. For after they had celebrated the feast, every one
returned home, as though they all, after having made an expiation, had
God propitious to them. The Prophet shews here, that the way of
worshipping God was very different, which was to reform their lives.

<span id="xvii.i-p15"></span><span id="xvii.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p16"></span>*Make good*, he says, *your ways and your
doings, then will I dwell in this place*  <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) This promise contains an implied
contrast; for the Prophet intimates, that the people would not long
survive, unless they sought in another way to pacify God. “I will dwell,
“he seems to say, — in this place, when your life is changed.” It then
follows on the other hand, “God will drive you into exile, except you
change your life: in vain then do you seek a quiet and happy state
through offering your sacrifices. God indeed esteems as nothing this
external worship, except it be preceded by inward sincerity, unless
integrity of life accompanies your profession.” This is one thing.

<span id="xvii.i-p18"></span><span id="xvii.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p19"></span>Then the Prophet comes closer to them when
he says, *Trust ye not in words of falsehood.* For had not this been
expressly said, the Jews might, according to their usual way, have found
out some evasion: “Have we then lost all our labor in celebrating our
festivals with so much diligence, in leaving our homes and families to
present ourselves before God? We have spared no expense, we have brought
sacrifices and spent our money; and is all this of no value before God?”
For hypocrites always magnify their trumperies, as we find in the
fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah, where they expostulated with God, as
though he were unkind to them, “We have from day to day sought the
Lord.” To this the Lord answered, “In vain ye seek me from day to day
and search for my ways.” Hence the Lord disregarded that diligence with
which hypocrites sought to render him propitious without real sincerity
of heart. It is for the same purpose that the Prophet now adds, *Trust
ye not*, *etc*. It is an anticipation in order to prevent them from
making their usual objection, “What then? Has the Temple been built in
vain?” But he says, “Is not God worshipped here in vain? They are *words
of falsehood*, when religious sincerity is absent.”

<span id="xvii.i-p20"></span>We hence see that external rites are here
repudiated, when men seek in a false way to gain favor before God, and
seek to redeem their sins by false compensations, while yet their hearts
continue perverse. This truth might be enlarged upon, but as it often
occurs in the prophets, I only notice it shortly. It is enough to regard
the main point, — that while the Jews were satisfied with the Temple,
the ceremonies and the sacrifices, they were self — deceivers, for their
boasting was fallacious: “the words of falsehood” are to be taken as
meaning that false and vain glorying in which the Jews indulged, while
they sought to ward off God’s vengeance by external rites, and at the
same time made no effort to return into favor by ameliorating their
life.

<span id="xvii.i-p21"></span>With regard to the expressions *The
Temple*, *etc*., some explain them thus, — they were “words of
falsehood, “when they said that they came to the Temple; and so the
supplement is, “when they said that they came, “for the pronoun
demonstrative is plural.  <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) Hence
they understand this of the people; not that the Jews called themselves
the Temple of God, but that they boasted that they came to the Temple
and there worshipped God. But I rather agree with others, who explain
this of the three parts of the Temple. There was, we know, the court,
then the Temple, and, lastly, the interior part, the Holy of holies,
where was the Ark of the Covenant. The prophets often speak of the
Temple only; but when they spoke distinctly of the form of the Temple,
they mentioned the court, as I have said, where the people usually
offered their sacrifices, and then the holy place, into which the
priests entered alone; and, lastly, the secret place, which was more
hidden, and was called the Holy of holies. It seems then that this
passage of the Prophet is to be understood as meaning that the people
said that the court, the Temple, and the interior part, were the Temples
of God, as though they had a triple Temple.

<span id="xvii.i-p26"></span>But we must observe the design of the
Prophet, which interpreters have omitted. The Prophet then made this
repetition especially, because the Temple was as it were a triple
defense to hypocrites, like a city, which, when surrounded, not by one,
but by three walls, is deemed impregnable. Since, then, the Jews exalted
their Temple, consisting of three parts, it was the same as they set up
a triple wall or a triple rampart against God’s judgments! “We are
invincible; how can enemies come to us? how can any calamity reach us?
God dwells in the midst of us, and here he has his habitation, and not
one and single fort, but a triple fort; he has his court, his Temple,
and his Holy of holies.” We now then understand why the Prophet made
this repetition, and used also the plural number.

<span id="xvii.ii"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xvii.ii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we so abuse
thy forbearance, that thou art constrained by our depravity to deal
sharply with us, — O grant, that we may not be also hardened against thy
chastisements, but may we with a submissive and tractable neck learn to
take thy yoke, and be so obedient to thy government, that we may testify
our repentance, not for one day only, and give no fallacious evidence,
but that we may really prove through the whole course of our life the
sincerity of our conversion to thee, by regarding this as our main
object, even to glorify thee in Christ Jesus our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xvii.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xvii.iii"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p1"></span>Lecture Twenty-Seventh

<span id="xvii.iv"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p1"></span><span id="xvii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#005.md)<span id="xvii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p2"></span>**5**. For if ye throughly amend your ways
and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his
neighbour;

<span id="xvii.iv-p3"></span>**5**. Certe si bonas faciendo bonas
feceritis vias vestras (bonificando bonificaveritis, *ad verbum, si ita
vertere liceret*) et studia vestra; si faciendo feceritis judicium inter
virum et inter proximum ejus;

<span id="xvii.iv-p4"></span>**6** *If* ye oppress not the stranger, the
fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place,
neither walk after other gods to your hurt:

<span id="xvii.iv-p5"></span>**6**. Peregrinum, pupillum et viduam non
oppresseritis; et sanguinem innoxium non effuderitis in hoc loco; et
post deos alienos non ambulaveritis in malum vobis (in malum vestrum;)

<span id="xvii.iv-p6"></span>**7**. Then will I cause you to dwell in
this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.

<span id="xvii.iv-p7"></span>**7**. Tunc habitare faciam vos in hoc
loco, in terra quam dedi patribus vestris, a seculo usque in seculum.

<span id="xvii.iv-p8"></span> 

<span id="xvii.iv-p9"></span><span id="xvii.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p10"></span>Interpreters do not agree as to the
meaning of this passage. Some render <span id="xvii.iv-p10.1"></span>כי
אם, *ki am*, “But rather, “or, “But.” I indeed allow that it is so taken
in many places; but they are mistaken who read <span
id="xvii.iv-p10.2"></span>כי אם, *ki am*, as one word; for the Prophet,
on the contrary, repeats what he had said, and that is, that God would
not be propitious to the Jews except their life proved that they had
really repented. The words are sometimes taken as one in Hebrew, and
mean “but;” yet in other places they are often taken as separate words,
as we found in the second chapter, “Though thou washest thyself with
nitre;” and for the sake of emphasis the particle “surely, “is put
before “though.” But in this place the Prophet simply means, that the
Jews were deceived in seeking to prescribe a law for God according to
their own will, as it belongs only to him either to approve or to reject
their works. And this meaning is confirmed by the latter part of the
verse, for we read not there <span id="xvii.iv-p10.3"></span>כי אם, *ki
am,* but <span id="xvii.iv-p10.4"></span>אם, *am; “*If by doing ye shall
do judgment;” and then in the same form he adds, “If ye will not oppress
the stranger, the orphan, and the widow;” and at last he adds, “Then (a
copulative I allow is here, but it is to be taken as an adverb) I will
make you to dwell in this place.”

<span id="xvii.iv-p11"></span>The purport of the whole is, — that
sacrifices are of no importance or value before God, unless those who
offer them wholly devote themselves to God with a sincere heart. The
Jews sought to bind God as it were by their own laws: he shews that he
was thus impiously put under restraint. He therefore lays down a
condition, as though he had said, “it belongs to me to prescribe to you
what is right. Away, then, with your ceremonies, by which ye think to
expiate your sins; for I regard them not, and esteem them as nothing.”
What then is to be done? He now shews then, “If you will rightly order
your life, ye shall dwell in this place.”

<span id="xvii.iv-p12"></span>For yesterday the Prophet exhorted the
people to repent; and he employed the sentiment which he now repeats. He
commanded the people to come to God with an upright and pure mind; he
afterwards added another sentence, “Trust not in words of falsehood,
saying, The Temple of the Lord, “etc. He now again repeats what he had
said, “If ye will make your ways good.” He shews now more clearly that
no wrong was done to the people when God repudiated their ceremonies;
for he required a pure heart, and external rites without repentance are
vain and useless. This then is what the Prophet had in view: “Though God
seems to treat you with great severity, he yet promises to be kind to
you, if you order your lives according to his law: is this unjust? Can
the condition which is proposed to you by God be liable to any
calumnies, as though God treated you cruelly!” This then is the meaning
of the Prophet.

<span id="xvii.iv-p13"></span>*If ye will make good your ways,* that is,
if your life be amended; *and if ye will do judgment, etc*. He now comes
to particulars; and first he addresses the judges, whose duty it was to
render to every one his right, to redress injuries, to pronounce what
was just and right when any contention arose. *If* then, he says, *ye
will do justice between a man and his neighbor,* that is, if your
judgments be right, without favor or hatred, and if no bribes lead you
from what is right and just, while pronouncing judgment on a case
between a man and his brother.

<span id="xvii.iv-p14"></span><span id="xvii.iv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p15"></span>Then he adds, *if ye will not oppress the
stranger and the orphan and the widow* This also belonged to the judges:
but God no doubt shews here generally, that injustice greatly prevailed
among the people, as he condemns the cruelty and perfidy of the judges
themselves.

<span id="xvii.iv-p16"></span>As to strangers and orphans and widows,
they are often mentioned; for strangers as well as orphans and widows
were almost destitute of protection, and were subject to many wrongs, as
though they were exposed as a prey. Hence, whenever a right government
is referred to, God mentions strangers and orphans and widows; for it
might hence be easily understood of what kind was the public
administration of justice; for when others obtain their right, it is no
matter of wonder, since they have advocates to defend their cause, and
they have also the aid of friends. Thus every one who defends his own
cause, obtains at least some portion of his right. But when strangers
and orphans and widows are not unjustly dealt with, it is an evidence of
real integrity; for we may hence conclude, that there is no respect of
persons among the judges. But as this subject has been handled
elsewhere, I only touch on it lightly here.

<span id="xvii.iv-p17"></span>*And if ye will not shed,* he says,
*innocent blood in this place* Here the Prophet accuses the judges of a
more heinous crime, and calls them murderers. They had, however, no
doubt some plausible pretences for shedding the blood of the innocent.
But the Prophet, speaking here in the name of God and by the dictates of
his Spirit, overlooks all these as altogether vain, though the judges
might have thought them sufficient excuses. By saying, *in this place,*
he shews how foolish was their confidence in boasting of God’s worship,
sacrifices, and Temple, while yet they had polluted the Temple with
their cruel murders.  <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md)

<span id="xvii.iv-p19"></span>He then passes to the first table of the
law, *If ye will not walk after foreign gods to your evil* By stating a
part for the whole, he condemns every kind of impiety: for what is it to
walk after alien gods but to depart from the pure and legitimate worship
of the true God and to corrupt it with superstitions? We see then what
the Prophet means: he recalls the Jews to the duty of observing the law,
that they might thereby give a veritable evidence of their repentance:
“Prove, “he says, “that you have repented from the heart.” He shews how
they were to prove this, even by observing the law of God. And, as I
have said, he refers to the first Table by stating a part for the whole.
As to the second Table, he mentions some particulars which were intended
to shew that they violated justice and equity, and also that cruelty and
perfidiousness, frauds and rapines, prevailed greatly among them.

<span id="xvii.iv-p20"></span><span id="xvii.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p21"></span>Then follows the latter part, *Then I will
make you to dwell*,  <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) etc. God
sets this clause in opposition to the false confidence of the people, as
though he had said, “Ye wish me to be propitious to you; but mock me not
by offering sacrifices without sincerity of heart, without a devout
feeling; be consistent; and think not that I am pacified by you, when ye
come to the Temple with empty display, and pollute your sacrifices with
impure hands. I therefore do not allow this state of things; but if ye
come on the condition of returning into favor with me, then I will make
you to dwell in this place and *in the* land which I gave to your
fathers.” The last part of the verse, *from age to age,* ought to be
connected with the verb, “I will make you to dwell, “<span
id="xvii.iv-p22.1"></span>שכנתי, *shekanti*, “I will make you to dwell
from age to age, “that is, As your fathers dwelt formerly in this land,
so shall you remain quiet in the same, and there shall be to you a
peaceable possession; but not in any other place. We must bear in mind
the contrast which I noticed yesterday; for he indirectly denounces
exile on the Jews, because they had contaminated the land by their
vices, and gloried only in their sacrifices. It now follows —

<span id="xvii.v"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p1"></span><span id="xvii.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#008.md)<span id="xvii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p2"></span>**8**. Behold, ye trust in lying words, that
cannot profit.

<span id="xvii.v-p3"></span>**8**. Ecce, vos fiduciam adjicitis ad verba
mendacii (*vel,* fiduciam vobis ponitis super verbis mendacii,) quae
profectu carent.

<span id="xvii.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.v-p5"></span><span id="xvii.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p6"></span>He again teaches what we observed yesterday,
— that the glorying of the Jews was foolish, while they boasted of the
Temple and of their sacrifices to God. He calls their boastings the
words of falsehood, as we have explained, because they wholly turned to
a contrary end what God had instituted. It was his will that sacrifices
should be offered to him in the Temple — to what purpose? To preserve
unity of faith among the whole people. And sacrifices, what was their
design? To shew the people that they deserved eternal death, and also
that they were to flee to God for mercy, there being no other expiation
but the blood of Christ. But there was no repentance, they were not
sorry for their sins; nay, as we shall presently see, they took liberty
to indulge more in them on account of their ceremonies, which yet ought
to have been the means of leading them to repentance. They were then the
words of falsehood when they separated the signs from their ends. The
reality and the sign ought indeed to be distinguished the one from the
other; but it is an intolerable divorce, when men lay hold on naked
signs and overlook the reality. There was in the sacrifices the reality
which I have now mentioned: they were reminded by the spectacle that
they were worthy of eternal death; and then, they were to exercise
penitence, and thus to flee to God’s mercy. As there was no account made
of Christ, no care for repentance, no sorrow for sins, no fear of God,
no humility, it was an impious separation of what ought to have been
united.

<span id="xvii.v-p7"></span>We now then more clearly see why the Prophet
designates as words of falsehood, that false glorying in which
hypocrites indulge, in opposition to God, when they would have him
satisfied with naked ceremonies. Hence he adds, that they were words
that *could not profit,* as though he had said, “As ye seek to trifle
with God, so he will also frustrate your design.” It is indeed certain
that they dealt dishonestly with God, when they attempted to satisfy his
judgment by frigid ceremonies. He therefore shews that a reward was
prepared for them; for they would at length find, that no fruit would
come from their false dealings. It follows —

<span id="xvii.vi"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p1"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#009.md)<span id="xvii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p2"></span>**9**. Will ye steal, murder, and commit
adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after
other gods whom ye know not;

<span id="xvii.vi-p3"></span>**9**. An furari, occidere, adulterium
committere, jurare falso (*hoc est,* pejerare) suffitum offerre Baal,
ambulare post deos alienos, quos non cognoscitis?

<span id="xvii.vi-p4"></span>**10**. And come and stand before me in
this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do
all these abominations?

<span id="xvii.vi-p5"></span>**10**. Et venientes et stantes coram facie
mea in domo hac (*hoc est,* in hoc templo,) super quam (*vel,* super
quod) invocatum est nomen meum, dicetis, Liberati sumus ad faciendum (ut
faciamus) omnes abominationes istas.

<span id="xvii.vi-p6"></span>**11**. Is this house, which is called by
my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen
*it*, saith the LORD.

<span id="xvii.vi-p7"></span>**11**. An spelunca latronum facta est
domus haec (*vel,* templum hoc,) super quam invocatum est nomen meum, in
oculis vestris? Etiam ego ecce video, dicit Jehova.

<span id="xvii.vi-p8"></span> 

<span id="xvii.vi-p9"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p10"></span>The meaning seems to be suspended in the
first verse, when he says, *Whether to steal, to kill, and to commit
adultery,* etc.; but there is nothing ambiguous in the passage. For
though there is something abrupt in the words, we yet infer this to be
the meaning, “Will you steal, “etc.? Verbs in the infinitive mood, we
know, are often to be considered as verbs in the future tense: “Will you
steal, murder, commit adultery, burn incense to Baal, “etc.? The Prophet
shews how foolishly the Jews sought to make an agreement with God, so
that they might with impunity provoke him by their many vices. When they
entered the Temple, they thought him to be under a necessity to receive
them, as though that was a proper reconciliation. But the Prophet
exposes this folly. For what can be more absurd than that God should
allow men to commit murders, thefts, and adulteries, with impunity?
Hypocrites do not in words express this; but when they make external
ceremonies a sort of expiation, and seek by such means to bury their
sins, do they not make God their associate? Do they not make him a
partaker, as it were, with them, when they would have him to cover their
adulteries? When they take sacrifices from their plunders, to expiate
their crimes, do they not make him a participator in their robberies?
The Prophet, therefore, plainly condemns hypocrites in this place,
because they acted most contumeliously towards God, in implicating him
in their own vices, as though he was the associate of thieves,
murderers, and adulterers.

<span id="xvii.vi-p11"></span>*Will you steal,* he says, and then, *will
you kill, commit adultery, and swear falsely?* These four sins are
against the Second Table, in which God forbids us to steal, to kill, to
commit adultery, and to deceive our neighbors by false swearing. These
four vices are mentioned, in order that the Prophet might shew that all
the duties of love were wholly disregarded by the Jews. He then adds
things which belong to the First Table, even the *offering of incense to
Baal,* and the *walking after alien gods,* which yet were unknown to
them. By these two clauses he proves their impiety. He mentions one kind
of idolatry, — that they offered incense to Baal. The Prophets often
refer in the plural number to Baalim, regarded by the Jews as advocates,
by whose intercession, as they thought, they gained favor with God; as
the case is at this day under the Papacy, whose Baalim are angels and
dead men: for they regard them not as gods, but think that by employing
these as advocates they conciliate God, and obtain his favor. Such was
the superstition which prevailed among the Jews. But the Prophet here
includes all idols under the word Baal. There is afterwards a general
complaint, — that God was neglected, and that they had perfidiously
departed from him, for they *walked after alien gods;* and he
exaggerates the crime by saying that they were *unknown*

<span id="xvii.vi-p12"></span>The Prophet, no doubt, intimates here a
contrast with the sure knowledge, which is the basis of true religion:
for God had given evident proofs of his glorious power by many miracles,
when the Israelites were redeemed; and he had afterwards confirmed the
same by many blessings; and the law had been proclaimed, accompanied
with many signs and wonders. (<span id="xvii.vi-p12.1"></span>[Ex
20:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018.md)<span id="xvii.vi-p12.1"></span>;
<span id="xvii.vi-p12.2"></span>[Deut.
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#023)<span id="xvii.vi-p12.2"></span>..md)
Hence the Jews could not have pleaded involuntary error, for after so
many proofs there could have been no excuse on the ground of ignorance.
Now, as to alien gods, how came they to know that they were gods? There
was no proof, they had no reason to believe them to be so. We hence see
how grievously wicked were the Jews; for they had departed from the
worship of the true God, who had made himself known to them by many
miracles, and who had confirmed the authority of his law, so that it
could not be questioned, and they had gone after unknown gods!

<span id="xvii.vi-p13"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p14"></span>The Prophet now adds, *Ye come,* that is,
after ye have allowed yourselves to steal, and to murder, and to commit
adultery, and to corrupt the whole worship of God, — at last, *Ye come
and stand before me in this temple.* God proceeds with the same subject;
for it was not only his purpose in this place to condemn the Jews as
murderers, and thieves, and adulterers, but he proceeds farther, even to
shew their shameless effrontery in coming with an unblushing front and
entering the Temple, as though they were the true worshippers of God.
“What do you mean, “he says, “by this? Ye bring with you murders, and
thefts, and adulteries, and abominable filth; ye are contaminated with
the most disgraceful things: by and bye ye enter the Temple, and think
that you are at liberty to do anything.” Similar is the language we find
in the first chapter of Isaiah, verses 12 and 15 (<span
id="xvii.vi-p14.1"></span>[Isa. 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#012.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015)<span id="xvii.vi-p14.1"></span>.md):
God complains there that they trod the pavement of his Temple, and
brought hands polluted with blood. So also in this place, *Ye come,* he
says, intimating his detestation, *and ye stand before me in this
Temple* Though God was not inclosed in that Temple, yet we know that the
Ark of the Covenant was the symbol of his presence. Hence, we often meet
in the law with this expression, “Ye shall stand before me.” Here then,
God shews that it was a detestable and monstrous thing, that the Jews
dared to rush into his presence, when polluted and contaminated with so
many vices.

<span id="xvii.vi-p15"></span>And he adds, *In this house, on which is
called my name,* that is, which has been dedicated to me; for to call
God’s name on the Temple, means nothing else, but that the Temple was
consecrated to him, so that he was there worshipped. When God is truly
worshipped, they who seek him find that he himself is present by his
grace and power. As then God had commanded the Temple to be built for
him, that he might there be worshipped, he says his name was there
called, that is, according to its first and sacred appointment. Absurdly
indeed did the Jews call on his name, for there was in them no religion,
no piety: but according to God’s institution, his name was called upon
in the Temple, as he had consecrated it to himself. Hence God reminds
them of the first institution, which was holy and ought to have
continued inviolable: “Know ye not, that this place has been chosen by
me, that my name might be there invoked? Ye stand before me in the holy
place, and ye stand polluted; and though polluted, not with one kind of
vices, but my whole law has been violated by you, and my Tables
despised, ye yet stand!” We hence see the design of the Prophet: for he
condemns the effrontery and frowardness of the Jews, because they thus
dared to rush into God’s presence in all their pollutions.

<span id="xvii.vi-p16"></span>*And ye say,* he adds, that is, while
standing in the Temple; *ye say, O, we are freed to do all these
abominations;* that is, “Ye think that the Temple is a covert for you to
hide all your vices; and so ye think, that you have escaped from my
hand, as though no account is any more to be made of your sins, my
Temple being regarded by you as an asylum, under whose shade ye take
shelter.” It is indeed certain, that the Jews did not thus speak; for
had they been asked whether their life was abominable, they would have
denied it to be so. He speaks of the fact itself, and he speaks in the
person of God, and according to his command. He therefore condemns
hypocrites for thinking themselves freed, because they came to the
Temple, and for thinking that all those abominations which he had
mentioned, their impiety towards God and their injustice towards their
neighbors, would be unpunished.  <span id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md)

<span id="xvii.vi-p26"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p27"></span>He afterwards adds, *Is this house, which
is called by my name, a den of robbers?* This is the conclusion of the
passage, which contains an amplification of their vices. For the Prophet
had allowed the Jews to form a judgment, as though he had been
discussing an obscure or doubtful subject, “Behold, be ye yourselves
judges in your own case; is it right for you to steal, to murder, and to
commit adultery? and then to come into this Temple, and to boast that
impunity is granted to you as to all your evils?” This indeed ought to
have been enough; but as the obstinacy and stupor of the Jews were so
great, that they would not have given way without being most fully and
in various ways proved guilty, the Prophet adds this sentence, *Is this
house, which is called by my name, a den of robbers?* that is, “Have I
chosen this place for myself, that ye might worship me, in order that ye
might be more licentious than if there was no religion? For what purpose
is religion? Is it not that men may by this bridle restrain themselves,
that they may not be libertines? For surely the worship and fear of God
are the directors of equity and justice. Now, would it not be better to
have no Temple and no sacrifices, than that men should take more liberty
to sin by making their ceremonies as an excuse? Away then with your
ceremonies: conscience shews that it is a wretched thing to oppress or
injure a neighbor; all are constrained by common sense to own that
adultery is a filthy and a detestable thing; and men think the same of
rapines and murders. As to superstitions, when they are seen as such,
all are constrained to allow the worship of God ought to be preserved in
its purity. Well then, had there been no Temple among you, this truth
must have been impressed on your minds, — that God ought to be
worshipped in purity. Now, because the Temple has been built at
Jerusalem, because ye offer sacrifices there, ye are thieves, ye are
adulterers, ye are murderers; and ye think that I am in some sort blind,
that I am no longer the avenger of so many and of such atrocious evils.
A den of robbers then is my house become to you.” But this sentence is
to be read interrogatively, “Can it be, that this Temple, this
sanctuary, is become a den of robbers?”  <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md)

<span id="xvii.vi-p32"></span>But we must consider the import of the
comparison: Robbers, though they are most audacious and wholly savage,
do not yet dare openly to use their sword; they dare not kill helpless
men. Why? they fear the punishment allotted to them by the laws; they
are cautious. But when they seize on men in some hidden place, then they
take more liberty in their robberies; they kill men, and then take their
property. We hence see that dens and hidden places have in them more
safety for robbers. The comparison then is most suitable, when the
Prophet says that the Jews made the Temple of God the den of robbers:
for had there been no Temple, some integrity might have remained,
secured by the common feeling of men. But when they covered their
baseness with sacrifices, they thought that they thus escaped all
judgment.

<span id="xvii.vi-p33"></span>And hence, Christ applied this prophecy to
his time; for the Jews had even then profaned the Temple. Though they
presumptuously and falsely called on God’s name, they yet sought the
Temple as an asylum for impurity. This folly Christ exposed, as the
Prophet had done.

<span id="xvii.vi-p34"></span>He afterwards adds, *Even I, behold I see,
saith Jehovah* Jeremiah here no doubt touches ironically on the false
confidence with which the Jews deceived themselves: for hypocrites seem
to themselves to know whatever is necessary. And hence also it is, that
as they think themselves to be acute, they are bolder and more
presumptuous in contriving deceitful schemes, by which they seek to
delude God and men. And hence the Prophet here tauntingly touches them
to the quick, by intimating that they wished to make God as it were
blind, *Even I, behold I see,* he says. It would not yet be sufficiently
evident how emphatical the phrase is, were it not for a similar passage
in <span id="xvii.vi-p34.1"></span>[Isa
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#015.md)<span id="xvii.vi-p34.1"></span>,

<span id="xvii.vi-p35"></span>“I also am wise.” The Prophet had said,
“Woe to the crafty and the wise, who have dug pits for themselves.”

<span id="xvii.vi-p36"></span>He there condemns ungodly men, who thought
that they could somehow by their falsehoods deceive God; which seems to
be and is monstrous: and yet it is an evil which commonly prevails among
men. For hardly a man in a hundred can be found who does not seek
coverings to hide himself from the eyes of God. This is the case
especially with courtiers and clever men, who assume to themselves so
much clear-sightedness, that God sees nothing in comparison with them.
The Lord therefore, by Isaiah, gives this answer, “I also am wise: if ye
are wise, allow me at least some portion of wisdom, and think not that I
am altogether foolish.” So also in this place, “Before my eyes, this
house is made a den of robbers;” that is, “If there be any sense in you,
does it not appear evident that you have made a den of robbers of my
Temple? and can I be yet blind? If you think that you are very
clear-sighted, I also do see, saith the Lord.”

<span id="xvii.vi-p37"></span>We hence see what force there is in the
particle <span id="xvii.vi-p37.1"></span>גם, *gam,* also, and in the
pronoun <span id="xvii.vi-p37.2"></span>אנכי, *anoki,* I, and in <span
id="xvii.vi-p37.3"></span>הנה*, ene,* behold; for these three words are
heaped together, that God might shew that he was not unobservant, when
the people so audaciously ran headlong into all kinds of vices, and
sought by their falsehoods to cover his eyes, that he might not see
anything.  <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md)

<span id="xvii.vii"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xvii.vii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou buildest
not at this day a temple among us of wood and stones, and as the
fullness of thy Godhead dwells in thine only — begotten Son, and as he
by his power fills the whole world, and dwells in the midst of us, and
even in us, — O grant, that we may not profane his sanctuary by our
vices and sins, but so strive to consecrate ourselves to thy service,
that thy name through his name may be continually glorified, until we
shall at length be received into that eternal inheritance, where will
appear to us openly, and face to face, that glory which we now see in
the truth contained in thy gospel. — Amen.

<span id="xvii.ix-p2"></span>**12**. But go ye now unto my place which
*was* in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to
it for the wickedness of my people Israel.

<span id="xvii.ix-p3"></span>**12**. Nempe ite nunc (*vel,* agedum) in

videte quid fecerim illic propter malitiam populi mei Israel.

<span id="xvii.ix-p4"></span>**13**. And now, because ye have done all
these works, saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and
speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;

<span id="xvii.ix-p5"></span>**13**. Et nunc quia fecistis omnia opera
haee (*id est,* quia imitati estis Israelitas) dicit Jehovah, et
loquutus sum ad vos mane surgens, et quum loquerer, non audistis, et

<span id="xvii.ix-p6"></span>**14**. Therefore will I do unto *this*
house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place
which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.

(super quam) invocatum est nomen meum, de qua vos fiditis (in qua vos
confiditis, *sequitur postea relativum*) et loco, quem dedi vobis et
patribus vestris, sicuti feci Silo.

<span id="xvii.ix-p8"></span> 

<span id="xvii.ix-p9"></span><span id="xvii.ix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ix-p10"></span>The Prophet confirms by an example what he
said yesterday, — that the Jews deceived themselves in thinking that
they were covered by the shadow of the Temple, while yet they disclosed
themselves, and when the whole world were witness of their impious
rebellion. He therefore mentions what had before happened. The Ark of
the Covenant, as it is well known, had long rested in Shiloh. Now the
Temple did not excel in dignity on its own account, but on account of
the Ark of the Covenant and the altar. It was indeed splendidly adorned;
but the holiness of the Temple was derived from the Ark of the Covenant,
the altar, and the sacrifices. This Ark had been in Shiloh.  <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) Hence Jeremiah shews how foolish were
the Jews in being proud, because they had among them the Ark of the
Covenant and the altar, for the first place, where sacrifices had been
offered to God, was not preserved in safety. This is the import of the
whole.

<span id="xvii.ix-p12"></span>But he did not in vain say, *Even go to
Shiloh* The <span id="xvii.ix-p12.1"></span>כי, *ki,* here, though
commonly a causal particle, seems to be taken as explanatory. If yet it
be viewed only as an affirmative, I do not object, “Well, go to Shiloh.”
But the language in this case is ironical, “Ye glory in the Temple;
forsooth! go to Shiloh.” And God calls it his place — *my place,* in
order that the Jews might understand that it had nothing superior in
itself. The Ark of the Covenant had indeed been removed into Mount Sion,
and there God had chosen a perpetual habitation for himself; but the
other place was superior as to antiquity. This is the reason why he
calls it “my place, “and adds, *Where I made my name to dwell,* that is,
where I designed the Ark to be: for the Ark of the Covenant and the
altar, with all their furniture, were properly the name of God; nor was
it by chance that all the tribes had placed the Ark in Shiloh; but it
was God’s will to be there worshipped for a time. Hence he says, that
the place was sacred before Jerusalem; and therefore he says *at the
first,* <span id="xvii.ix-p12.2"></span>בראשונה, *berashune;* that is,
the Shilomites are not only equal with you, but antiquity brings them a
greater honor: if then a comparison is made, they excel you as to what
is ancient.

<span id="xvii.ix-p13"></span>*See,* he says, *what I did to that place
for the iniquity of my people Israel*. He calls here Israel his people,
not for honor’s sake, but that he might again remind the Jews that they
were only equal to the Israelites; and yet that it profited all the
tribes nothing, that they were wont to assemble there to worship God.
 <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) For when we reason from
example, we must always see that there be no material difference.
Jeremiah then shews that the Israelites were equal to the Jews, and that
if the Jews claimed a superiority, the claim was neither just nor right,
for Israel were also the people of God, inasmuch as it was God’s will to
fix there the Ark of the Covenant, that sacrifices might be there
offered to him; and then antiquity was in its favor, for it was a holy
place before it was known that God had chosen Mount Sion as a situation
for his Temple.

<span id="xvii.ix-p15"></span>Hence he draws this conclusion, *Now,
then, as ye have done all these works,* that is, as ye have become like
the Israelites, *therefore,* etc. But he first amplifies their crime, —
that they had not only imitated the wickedness of the twelve tribes, but
had also perversely despised all warnings, *I spake to you,* he says,
*and rose up early* By this metaphor he intimates, that he was as
solicitous for preserving the kingdom of Judah, as parents are wont to
be for the safety of their children: for as a father rises early to see
what is necessary for his family, so also God says, that he rose early,
inasmuch as he had been assiduous in exhorting them. He appropriates to
his own person what properly belonged to his prophets: but as he had
roused them by his Spirit and employed them in their work, he justly
claims to himself whatever he had done by them as his instruments: and
it was an exaggeration of their guilt, that they were slothful, nay,
stupid, when God sedulously labored for their safety.

<span id="xvii.ix-p16"></span>He adds, *I spoke, and ye heard not;* I
cried *to you, and ye did not answer,* he inveighs more at large against
their hardness; for had he only once warned them, some pretense might
have been made; but as God, by rising early every day, labored to
restore them to himself, and as he had not only employed instruction,
but also crying, (for by crying he doubtless means exhortations and
threatenings, which ought to have produced greater effect upon them,)
there appeared in this contumacy the highest degree of mad audacity. The
meaning is, — that God had tried all means to restore the Jews to a
sound mind, but that they were wholly irreclaimable; for he had called
them not only once, but often; and he had also endued his prophets with
power to labor strenuously in the discharge of their office: he had not
only shewed by them what was useful and necessary, but he had *cried,*
that is, had employed greater vehemence, in order to correct their
tardiness. Since then God, in using all these means, could effect
nothing, what remained for them was miserably to perish, as they
willfully sought their own destruction.

<span id="xvii.ix-p17"></span><span id="xvii.ix-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ix-p18"></span>*Therefore,* he says, *I will do to this
house, which is called by my name, etc*. He anticipates, no doubt, all
objections, as though he had said, “I know what you will say, — that
this place is sacred to God, that his name is invoked here, and that
sacrifices are here offered: all these things, he says, are alleged to
no purpose, for in Shiloh also was his name invoked, and he dwelt there.
Though then ye foolishly trust in this place, it shall not yet escape
that judgment which happened to the former place.” He adds, *which I
gave to you and to your fathers* Be it so; for this is to be considered
as a concession; and at the same time objections are anticipated, in
order that the Jews might understand that it availed them nothing, that
God had chosen to build his sanctuary on Mount Sion; for the object was
to promote religion. But as the place was converted to a wholly
different purpose, and as God’s name was there shamefully profaned, he
says, “Though I gave this place to you and your fathers, yet nothing
better shall be its fate than the fate of Shiloh.”  <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) It follows —

<span id="xvii.x"></span>

<span id="xvii.x-p1"></span><span id="xvii.x-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#015.md)<span id="xvii.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.x-p2"></span>**15**. And I will cast you out of my sight,
as I have cast out all your brethren, *even* the whole seed of Ephraim.

<span id="xvii.x-p3"></span>**15**. Et projiciam vos a facie mea, sicuti
projeci omnes fratres vestros, totum semen Ephraim.

<span id="xvii.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.x-p5"></span><span id="xvii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.x-p6"></span>He concludes the former verse. The Prophet
had indeed sufficiently explained himself; but this confirmation was
necessary for a people so refractory. He then alleges nothing new, but
only shews that there would be no defense to his own people against
God’s vengeance any more than to the Israelites: and hence he now calls
them their *brethren,* as he had previously said that they were his
people; for the state of the ten tribes was the same, until it had
pleased God to remove the Ark of the Covenant to Mount Sion, that he
might have his throne in the tribe of Judah. All the children of Abraham
were indeed equal; but the Israelites were superior in number and in
power. And he says, *the whole seed.* This is significantly added; for
the Jews had with them only the half of the tribe of Manasse. The ten
tribes had perished; in nothing could they exalt themselves; and they
were in this respect inferior, because they were only one tribe and
half, and the ten tribes were larger in number.  <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md)

<span id="xvii.x-p8"></span>He calls them the *seed of Ephraim,* because
of their first king, and also because that tribe was more illustrious
than the other nine tribes. And in the Prophets Ephraim is in many
places named for Israel, that is, for that second kingdom, which yet
flourished more in wealth and power. We now perceive the meaning of the
Prophet.

<span id="xvii.x-p9"></span>But we may hence learn this important truth,
— that God had never so bound himself to any people or place, that he
was not at liberty to inflict punishment on the impiety of those who had
despised his favors, or profaned them by their ingratitude and their
sins. And this ought to be carefully noticed; for we see that it is an
evil as it were innate in us, that we become elated and proud whenever
God deals bountifully with us; for we so abuse his favors as to think
that more liberty is given us, because God has bestowed on us more than
on others. But there is nothing more groundless than this presumption;
and yet we become thus insolent whenever God honors us with peculiar
favors. Let us therefore bear in mind what is taught here by the
Prophet, — that God is ever at liberty to take vengeance on the ungodly
and the ungrateful.

<span id="xvii.x-p10"></span>Hence also it appears how foolish is the
boasting of the Papists; for whenever they bring against us the name of
the apostolic throne, they think that God’s mouth is closed; they think
that all authority is to be taken away from his word. In short, they
harden themselves against God, as though they had a legitimate
possession, because the gospel had been once preached at Rome, and
because that place was the first seat of the Church in Italy as well as
in Europe. But God never favored Rome with such a privilege, nor has he
said that his habitation was to be there. If the Pope and his adherents
had what the Jews then possessed, (which really belonged to Mount Sion,)
who could bear their fury, I say not, their pride? But we see what
Jeremiah says of Mount Sion, of which yet it had been said,

<span id="xvii.x-p11"></span>“This is my rest for ever; here will I
dwell,  
because I have chosen it.” (<span id="xvii.x-p11.2"></span>[Ps
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014)<span id="xvii.x-p11.2"></span>.md)

<span id="xvii.x-p12"></span>*Go now,* he says, *to Shiloh* Now, since
Shiloh and Jerusalem, and so many celebrated cities, where the gospel
formerly flourished, have been taken away from us, it is not to be
doubted, but that a dreadful vengeance and destruction await all those
who reject the doctrine of salvation, and despise the treasure of the
gospel. Since then God has shewn by so many proofs and examples that he
is not bound to any places, how stupid is their madness who seek,
through the mere name of an apostolic seat, to subvert all truth and all
fear of God, and whatever belongs to true religion. Let us now proceed —

<span id="xvii.xi"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p1"></span><span id="xvii.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#016.md)<span id="xvii.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p2"></span>**16**. Therefore pray not thou for this
people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make
intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.

<span id="xvii.xi-p3"></span>**16**. Et tu ne ores pro populo hoc, et ne
eleves pro ipsis clamorem et precationem, et ne occurras (intercedas;
*est enim translativum verbum, nam* <span id="xvii.xi-p3.1"></span>פנע
*significat obviam ire, sed accipitur pro intercedere,* ne *ergo*
intercedas) apud me, quia non exaudiam to.

<span id="xvii.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xi-p5"></span><span id="xvii.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p6"></span>God, in order to exonerate his servant from
every ill-will, forbids him to pray for the people. This might have been
done for the sake of the Prophet, as well as of the whole people; for no
doubt Jeremiah regarded the ruin of his own nation with great grief and
sorrow: as we shall see elsewhere, he had not divested himself of all
human feelings. He was doubtless anxious for the safety of his brethren,
and he condoled with the miserable, when he saw that they were already
given up to destruction. But God strengthens him, that he might
courageously discharge his office; for pity has often melted the hearts
of men so as not to be able, as they ought, to perform their office.
Jeremiah might have been more tardy or more temperate in denouncing
God’s vengeance, had not all impediments, which checked his alacrity,
been removed. Hence then he is bidden to divest himself of sympathy, so
that he might rise above all human feelings, and remember that he was
set a judge over the people, or a herald to denounce their final doom.
There is yet no doubt but that God had respect to the people also, — to
make it known to them that Jeremiah was constrained to perform his part,
however unpleasant it might be to him. Hence, as I have said, he was
thus relieved from the charge of ill-will, lest he should exasperate his
own nation while treating them with so much severity.

<span id="xvii.xi-p7"></span>*Pray not,* he says, *for this people;* and
then, *Raise not up a prayer* Some read, “Take not up a prayer.” The
verb <span id="xvii.xi-p7.1"></span>נשא, *nesha,* properly means to
raise up. We have spoken of this phrase elsewhere; for there are two
different ways of speaking when prayer is the subject. The Scripture
sometimes says of the faithful, that they cast a prayer before God; and
thus is set forth their humility, when they come as suppliants, and dare
not lift upwards their eyes, like the publican, of whom Christ speaks.
(<span id="xvii.xi-p7.2"></span>[Lu
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#013)<span id="xvii.xi-p7.2"></span>..md)
We are then said to cast a prayer before God, when we humbly seek
pardon, and stand before him with shame and self — reproach. We are also
said, for another reason, to raise up a prayer; for when our hearts sink
and ascend not to God in faith, it is certain that our prayers are not
real: hence the faithful, on account of the fervor of their desire, are
said to raise up their prayers. Even so the meaning is here, *Raise not
up for them a cry and a prayer*

<span id="xvii.xi-p8"></span>Then he says, *Intercede not, for I will
not hear thee*  <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) There is yet no
doubt but that the Prophet, as we shall see, continued in his prayers;
but still as one knowing that the safety of the city and kingdom would
no longer be granted by God: for he might have prayed for two things, —
that God would reverse his decree; and this he was forbidden to do; —
and, that God would be mindful of his covenant in preserving a remnant;
and this was done; for the name of the people, though the city and the
Temple were destroyed, has never been obliterated. Some people then
survived, though without any distinction or renown. And hence at the
restoration of the Church God calls its subjects a new people, as in
<span id="xvii.xi-p11.1"></span>[Ps
102:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019.md)<span
id="xvii.xi-p11.1"></span>,

<span id="xvii.xi-p12"></span>“A people who shall be created,” that is,
a new people,  
“shall praise the Lord,”

<span id="xvii.xi-p13"></span>as though he intimated that the Babylonian
exile would be the ruin of his ancient people. God has, however,
preserved a remnant, as Paul says in <span
id="xvii.xi-p13.1"></span>[Romans
10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#000.md)<span id="xvii.xi-p13.1"></span> and
<span id="xvii.xi-p13.2"></span>[Romans
11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#000.md)<span id="xvii.xi-p13.2"></span>. So
for the whole body of the people, and for the kingdom, the Prophet was
not to pray, because he knew that it was all over with the people. But
on this subject we shall speak more at large in another place. It
follows —

<span id="xvii.xii"></span>

<span id="xvii.xii-p8"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xii-p9"></span><span id="xvii.xii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xii-p10"></span>Here God shews first why he ought to be
implacable towards the people: for the command to the Prophet not to
pray for them seems at the first hearing to be very severe; and it might
have been objected and said, “What if they repent? Is there no hope of
pardon?” God shews that they were past remedy — How so? He says, *Dost
thou not see?* Here he refers the examination of the cause to his
servant Jeremiah; as though he had said, “There is no reason for thee to
contend with me; open thine own eyes, and consider how they have fallen;
for *children gather wood, and fathers kindle the fire,* and *women
knead dough.”* Some render the last words, “Women are busy with the
paste;” but literally, “they set the dough, “*la paste* God intimates
here shortly, that the whole people were become corrupt, as though they
had wickedly conspired together, so that men, women, and children, were
all led away into idolatry as by a mad impulse; for he speaks here only
of their superstitions. He had before charged them with adulteries,
murders, and plunders; but he now condemns them for having wholly
profaned God’s worship, and at the same time shews the fruit of their
impiety — that they all strove to outdo one another by an insane
rivalship.

<span id="xvii.xii-p11"></span><span id="xvii.xii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xii-p12"></span>*The children,* he says, *gather wood* He
ascribes the collecting of wood to the young; for it was a more
laborious work. As then that age excels in strength, they collected
wood; and *the fathers kindled the fire:* the women, what did they do?
They were busy with the meal. Thus no part was neglected. “What then is
to be done? and what else can I do, but wholly to cut off a people so
wicked?” Then he says, *that they may make* <span
id="xvii.xii-p12.1"></span>כונים, *cunim,* which is translated “cakes,
“and this is the most common rendering. Some think that kindling is
meant, deriving the word from <span id="xvii.xii-p12.2"></span>כוה,
*cue,* which means to kindle. But I prefer the opinion of those who
derive the word from <span id="xvii.xii-p12.3"></span>כון, *cun*, which
is to prepare, as cakes are things prepared. I do not then doubt, but
that cakes are meant here, as it appears also from other places. The
second interpretation I regard as too refined.  <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md)

<span id="xvii.xii-p14"></span>With regard to the word <span
id="xvii.xii-p14.1"></span>למלכת, *lamelcath,* many consider the letter
<span id="xvii.xii-p14.2"></span>א left out, and think that “works” are
intended. In this case <span id="xvii.xii-p14.3"></span>מ would be a
servile: but others consider it a radical, and render the word, “Queen;”
which appears to me probable; though I do not wholly reject what some
hold that the workmanship of the heavens is here meant. Some understand
the stars, others the sun, and others the moon: let every one enjoy his
own opinion. However, I think, that if the workmanship of the heavens be
meant, the whole celestial host is to be included, as the Scripture thus
calls all the stars. But if “the Queen of the heavens” be adopted, then
I am inclined to think that the moon is intended: and we know how much
superstition has ever prevailed among most people as to the worship of
the moon. Hence I approve of this meaning. Yet I readily admit that all
the stars, not one only, may be here designated, and called the work or
the workmanship of the heavens. And the Jews, we know, were very much
given to this madness: for as the sun was considered by the Orientals as
the supreme God, when the Jews became enamoured with this error, they
also thought that some high and adorable divinity belonged to the sun:
they turned also afterwards to the stars; and this absurdity is often
referred to in the Law and also in the Prophets.  <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md)

<span id="xvii.xii-p17"></span>It is then added, *That they may pour
forth libations to foreign gods, to provoke me to wrath* When God
complains of being provoked, it is the same as though he had said, that
the Jews now openly carried on war with him, — “They sin not through
ignorance, nor is it unknown to them how much they offend me by these
profanations; but it is as it were their object and design to provoke me
and to carry on war with me by these acts of impiety.”

<span id="xvii.xii-p18"></span><span id="xvii.xii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xii-p19"></span>He then subjoins, *Do they provoke me,
and not rather to the shame of their own faces?* God here intimates,
that however reproachfully the Jews acted towards him, they yet brought
no loss to him, for he stood in no need of their worship. Why then does
he so severely threaten them? Because he had their sins in view: but yet
he shews that he cared not for them nor their sacrifices, for he could
without any loss be without them. Hence he says, that they sought their
own ruin, and whatever they devised would fall on their own heads. They
seek to provoke me; they shall know with whom they have to do.” It is
like what is said by the Prophet Zechariah, “They shall know whom they
have pierced: I indeed continue uninjured; and though they provoke me as
much as they can, I yet despise all their wickedness, for they cannot
reach me; they can neither hurt me nor take anything from me.” But he
says, *they provoke themselves,* that is, their fury shall return on
their own heads; and hence it shall be, that *their faces* shall be
ashamed.  <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md)

<span id="xvii.xiii"></span>

<span id="xvii.xiii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xvii.xiii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we are
inclined not only to superstitions, but also to many vices, we may be
restrained by thy word, and as thou art pleased daily to remind us of
thy benefits, that thou mayest keep us in the practice of true religion,
— O grant, that we may not be led astray by the delusions of Satan and
by our own vanity, but continue firm and steady in our obedience to
thee, and constantly proceed in the course of true piety, so that we may
at length partake of its fruit in thy celestial kingdom, which has been
obtained for us by the blood of thine only — begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="xvii.xv"></span>

<span id="xvii.xv-p1"></span><span id="xvii.xv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#020.md)<span id="xvii.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xv-p2"></span>**20**. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD;
Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon
man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit
of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.

<span id="xvii.xv-p3"></span>**20**. Propterea sic dicit Dominus Jehova,
Ecce ira mea et furor meus (*vel,* excandescentia, *nam verbum hoc
significat*) conflata est super locum hunc, super hominem et super
animal (brutum; *alii vertunt,* jumentum, bestiam,) super arborem agri,
et super fructum terrae; et ardebit, et nullus extinguet.

<span id="xvii.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xv-p5"></span><span id="xvii.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xv-p6"></span>Jeremiah proceeds still with the same
subject, and explains more at large what we have noticed in the
preceding lecture, that the ruin of Mount Sion and of the Temple was
nigh at hand, according to what God had before done to Shiloh, where the
Ark had long been kept. But that his threatening might have more weight,
he introduced God as the speaker, —

<span id="xvii.xv-p7"></span>*Behold,* he says, *my wrath, even mine
indignation, has been poured down on this place* He refers to the
metaphor he had before used; and hence is confirmed what I then said, —
that God spoke not of prophetic teaching, but of the punishments which
he had already inflicted and was prepared to inflict. On this account he
says, that *his wrath,* or vengeance (the cause is put for the effect)
had been *poured down* on the city Jerusalem, so as to bring destruction
on the cattle as well as men, and also on the fruit of the land. It is
indeed certain that brute animals, as well as trees and the productions
of the earth, were innocent; but as the whole world was created for man
and for his benefit, it is nothing strange that God’s vengeance should
extend to innocent animals and to things not endued with reason: for God
does not inflict punishment on brute animals and on the fruits of the
earth, except for the purpose of shewing, by extending the symptoms of
his wrath to all the elements, how much displeased he is with men. The
whole world, we know, bears at this day in some measure the punishment
which Adam deserved: and hence Paul says, that all the elements labor in
pain, aspiring after a deliverance; and he says also, that all creatures
have been subjected to corruption, though not willingly, that is, not
through their own fault, but through the sin and transgression of man.
(<span id="xvii.xv-p7.1"></span>[Ro
8:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020.md)<span
id="xvii.xv-p7.1"></span>.) It is no wonder, then, that God, wishing to
terrify men, should daily set before their eyes the various forms of his
vengeance as manifested towards animals, as well as trees and the fruits
of the earth.

<span id="xvii.xv-p8"></span>The meaning then is, — that God was so
angry, that he purposed to destroy, not only the Jews, but the land
itself, in order that posterity might know how grievously they had
sinned, against whom God’s just vengeance had thus kindled. There is
therefore no need for us curiously to inquire why God shewed his
displeasure towards trees and brute animals: for it is enough for us to
know that God does not in a strict sense punish brute animals and trees,
but that this is done on account of man, that such a sad spectacle may
fill them with fear. He afterwards adds —

<span id="xvii.xvi"></span>

<span id="xvii.xvi-p1"></span><span id="xvii.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#021.md)<span
id="xvii.xvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xvi-p2"></span>**21**. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the
God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat
flesh.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p3"></span>**21**. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus
Israel, Holocausta vestra addite super victimas vestras et comedite
carnem.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p4"></span>**22**. For I spake not unto your fathers,
nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of
Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:

<span id="xvii.xvi-p5"></span>**22**. Quia non loquutus sum cum patribus
vestris, et non praecepi illis quo die eduxi eos e terra Egypti super
verbis (hoc est, rationibus, nam רבד proprie significat rationem Latine;
Hebraei enim ita passim usurpant hanc vocem, sicuti Latini rationem,
super rationibus ergo) holocaustorum et victimae:

<span id="xvii.xvi-p6"></span>**23**. But this thing commanded I them,
saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my
people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it
may be well unto you.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p7"></span>**23**. Quin potius (sed <span
id="xvii.xvi-p7.1"></span>כי אם est adversativa particula, hoc est, hae
duae voces ponuntur loco adversativae, sed) verbum hoc praecepi illis,
dicendo, Audite vocem meam, et ero vobis in Deum, et vos eritis mihi in
populum, et ambulabitis in omni via (hoc est, in tota via) quam
mandavero vobis, ut bene sit vobis.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p8"></span>**24**. But they hearkened not, nor
inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels *and* in the imagination
of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p9"></span>**24**. Et non audierunt, et non
inclinarunt aurem suam, et ambulaverunt in perplexis consiliis (*proprie
accipitur in malam partem*) et in pravitate (*vel,* duritia) cordis sui
mali, et fuerunt retro, et non ad faciem.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p10"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xvi-p11"></span><span id="xvii.xvi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xvi-p12"></span>The Prophet here taunts the Jews for
being so sedulous in their attention to sacrifices, while they had no
care for piety. Hence he says by way of ridicule, “Offer your
sacrifices, and accumulate burnt-offerings and victims, and eat flesh.”
The last clause proves that God regarded as nothing their sacrifices,
and that nothing was acceptable to him, though the Jews spent much money
and spared no labors. God then shews that all these things were nothing
to him; *eat flesh,* he says, which means, “Ye sacrifice to yourselves,
not to me.” There is here a contrast implied; for when they did eat
flesh, there was the legitimate service of God, provided sacrifices were
duly offered; but God here excludes himself, as though he had said,
“These things belong not at all to me; for when ye bring sacrifices,
your object is to feast: eat, then, and stuff your stomachs; nothing of
this belongs to me.”  <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md)

<span id="xvii.xvi-p16"></span>The import of the whole is, — that the
feasts which the Jews celebrated were profane, though they pretended the
name of God, and wished them to be deemed sacred. *Eat* then *flesh;*
that is, “I repudiate your sacrifices; it is to no purpose that ye cover
your iniquities by the shadow of the Temple; for your pollutions
restrain me from accepting what ye pretend to offer to me.” By saying,
*Add sacrifices to victims,* he means, that though they sacrificed every
animal in the land, it would be all to no purpose; for, as I have said,
in offering sacrifices to God their object was to get a feast, inasmuch
as they did not regard the right end.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p17"></span><span id="xvii.xvi-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xvi-p18"></span>The Prophet therefore adds, *I spoke not
to your fathers, nor commanded them, in the day I brought them forth
from the land of Egypt, concerning sacrifices or burnt* — *offerings:
but this only I commanded them, to hear my voice, and to walk in all the
way which I commanded them.* Jeremiah seems to have condemned sacrifices
too much; for we know they were designed for certain purposes: they were
intended to promote penitence; for when an animal was killed at the
altar, all were reminded that they were guilty of death, which the
animals underwent instead of men. Hence God did thereby represent to the
Jews, as in a mirror, the dreadful judgment they deserved; and the
sacrifices were also living images of Christ; they were sure pledges of
that expiation through which men are reconciled to God. Jeremiah then
seems here to speak too contemptibly of sacrifices; for they were seals
of God’s grace, and had been instituted to lead men to repentance. But
he speaks according to the ideas of those who had strangely vitiated the
worship of God; for the Jews were sedulously attentive to sacrifices,
and yet neglected the main things — faith and repentance. Hence the
Prophet here repudiates sacrifices, because these false worshippers of
God had adulterated them; for they were only intent on external rites,
and overlooked their design, and even despised it.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p19"></span>We know that it was God’s will from the
beginning to be worshipped in a spiritual manner; and he has not changed
his nature in our day. As then at this day he approves of no other than
a spiritual worship, as He is a Spirit, (<span
id="xvii.xvi-p19.1"></span>[Joh
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024)<span id="xvii.xvi-p19.1"></span>.md)
so also under the Law he was to be worshipped with a sincere heart.
Absurdly then did the Jews offer their sacrifices, as though they could
thereby appease God: and this is the reason why the prophets inveighed
so pointedly against sacrifices. God says that he nauseated them, that
he was wearied with them, that his name was thereby polluted, (<span
id="xvii.xvi-p19.2"></span>[Isa
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#014)<span id="xvii.xvi-p19.2"></span>.md)
he says also, that to sacrifice was the same as though one killed a dog,
an unclean animal, and as though one killed a man. (<span
id="xvii.xvi-p19.3"></span>[Isa
66:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#003.md)<span
id="xvii.xvi-p19.3"></span>.)

<span id="xvii.xvi-p20"></span>“What are your offerings and sacrifices
to me.”

<span id="xvii.xvi-p21"></span>he says by Amos. Such declarations occur
everywhere in the Prophets; we are told that sacrifices were not only of
no account before God, but that they were filthy things which he
abominated; that is, when the things signified were separated from the
signs. This then is the reason why Jeremiah here wholly rejects
sacrifices: he complains that God’s worship was violated and profaned;
and it was so, because the Jews presented to God mere shadows instead of
realities.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p22"></span>But still he seems to have exceeded due
limits; as he says of God, that he gave no command respecting
sacrifices: for before the law was published, God had ordered sacrifices
to be offered to him; as, for instance, the passover; for the pascal
lamb, as it is well known, was a sacrifice; and he had also spoken of
sacrifices before the people were liberated. Moreover, after the law was
given, a priesthood was established among the people, as Moses clearly
shews. Further still, we see with what care regulations have been given
as to sacrifices. Why then is it here said, that he spoke nothing
respecting sacrifices? Even because God regards not sacrifices in
themselves. He therefore makes a distinction between external signs and
spiritual worship; for the Jews, as it has been already said, had by
their corruptions so subverted what God had instituted, that he would
not acknowledge what they did as having been commanded by him. And if we
take the words as they are, they are wholly true, — that God had
commanded nothing respecting mere sacrifices, or sacrifices for their
own sake. This distinction solves every difficulty; that is, that God
never delighted in sacrifices themselves, that it was never his will to
be served with mere external rites, that burnt — offerings, victims,
incense, and things of this kind, were of themselves regarded by him of
no value. Since, then, sacrifices did not please God, except on account
of the end designed, it remains a clear truth, that God commanded
nothing respecting sacrifices: for his design only was to remind the
Jews of their sin, and also to shew to them the way of reconciliation.
We hence see that God had not from the beginning required mere
sacrifices, for he required them for a certain end. It is the same as
though we should say at this day, that God regards not fasting. We yet
know that fasting is commended to us, but not on account of itself. We
now understand the meaning of the Prophet.  <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md)

<span id="xvii.xvi-p27"></span>Now, this passage contains a very useful
doctrine, and which ought the more to be observed by us, as the neglect
of it introduces dreadful darkness. They under the Papacy think that God
is duly and in the best manner worshipped, when they accumulate many
pompous exhibitions of ceremonies; nor can they be persuaded that all
this is altogether frivolous. How so? Because they think of God
according to their own fancies and disposition. And yet all the Papal
ceremonies are the inventions of men: for they derive no authority
either from the Law or from the Gospel. And since God has so severely
reprobated ceremonies, which yet he had appointed for a purpose which
was overlooked, what can be thought at this day of the foolish
inventions of men, when there is the some impiety in the people as was
formerly in the Jews? For when the Papists perform their trumperies,
when the monks and the sacrificing priests fill the churches with their
noises, when they practice their childish mummeries, and when they
delight themselves with music and incense, they think that God is
satisfied, however full of obscenities and filthiness their whole life
may be: they are hardened in that false confidence, by which the Jews
were inebriated. We ought, therefore, with special care, to notice this
doctrine, — that God so approves of spiritual worship, that he esteems
all other things as nothing; that is, when unconnected with sincerity of
heart.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p28"></span><span id="xvii.xvi-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xvi-p29"></span>*I spoke not* then to *your fathers, nor
commanded them in the day I brought them forth from the land of Egypt,
etc.* The Prophet calls the attention of the Jews to the first condition
of the Church; for though God had made his covenant with Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, yet he then only formed or framed for himself a Church when
the Law was promulgated. Hence God at that time showed what pleased him,
and prescribed certain things, which were in future to be inviolably
observed: and as the Jews violated the rule given them, the Prophet
concludes that God was corruptly and absurdly worshipped by them. This
is the reason why he expressly speaks here of the deliverance granted to
the fathers. There follows afterwards a clearer explanation, which
removes all ambiguity: for God subordinates sacrifices to obedience. Yet
sacrifices are a part of obedience: very true; but as the people were to
be subject to the whole law, it hence follows, that the worship of God
was mutilated by them, when there was no care for true piety. We now
then, no doubt, understand the meaning of the Prophet, and see at the
same time the reason why God so expressly rejected sacrifices: for what
God has connected, it is not in the power of man to separate. (<span
id="xvii.xvi-p29.1"></span>[Mt
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006.md)<span id="xvii.xvi-p29.1"></span>;
<span id="xvii.xvi-p29.2"></span>[Mr
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#009.md)<span
id="xvii.xvi-p29.2"></span>.) This rending of things is impious. As the
Jews had separated sacrifices from their right and legitimate end,
whatever they did was a sacrilege and a profanation.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p30"></span>That we may now more fully comprehend
this doctrine, we must remember this principle — that the basis of true
religion is obedience. For unless God shines on us with his word, there
is no religion, but only hypocrisy and superstition; as the case is with
heathens, who, though they busy themselves much and with great
diligence, yet loose all their labor, and uselessly weary themselves,
for God has not shewn to them the right way. In short, true religion may
always be distinguished from superstition by this mark — If the truth of
God guides us, then our religion is true; but if any one follows his own
reason, or is led by the opinion and consent of men, he forms for
himself superstition; and nothing that he does will please God. This is
one thing.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p31"></span>Now, in the second place, let us see what
God chiefly requires from those who are his servants. Being fully
convinced of this truth — that God cannot be truly served, except we
obey his voice, we must consider, as I have said, what God commands us
to do. Now, as he is a Spirit, so he demands sincerity of heart. (<span
id="xvii.xvi-p31.1"></span>[Joh
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024.md)<span
id="xvii.xvi-p31.1"></span>.) We also know that God so comes to us, that
he would have us to trust wholly in his gratuitous goodness, that he
would have us to depend altogether on his paternal kindness, that he
would have us to call on him, and to offer him the sacrifice of praise.
Since, then, God has expressly required these things in his word, it is
certain, that all other modes of worship are rejected by him as vitious;
that is, when there is no faith, when there is no prayer and praise: for
these hold the first place in true and legitimate worship.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p32"></span>This one passage is sufficient to put an
end to all the contentions which are now in the world. For if the
Papists admitted that obedience is of more account with God than all
sacrifices, (<span id="xvii.xvi-p32.1"></span>[1Sa
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md)<span
id="xvii.xvi-p32.1"></span>,) we might easily agree. They might
afterwards debate every article of faith; but there would be in the main
an agreement between us, were they to submit simply and unreservedly to
the word of God. But we see how pertinaciously they insist on this point
— that we are not to stand on God’s word, nor acquiesce in it, because
there is in it nothing certain. Hence they regard the doctrine of the
Fathers, and what they call the perpetual consent of the Catholic
Church, as of more value than the Law and the Prophets and the Gospel.
They dare not indeed to contend on this ground; and so far they act
wisely: for if the disputes between us are capable of being removed, as
I have said, by God’s word, we could easily overcome them. But while
they, fostering their own blindness, strive to extinguish the light, and
willfully envelop themselves in darkness, let us follow what God’s
Spirit shews to us here, — that the main part of true and right worship
and service is to hear God speaking, and to regard obedience of more
account than all offerings and sacrifices, according to the passage we
have quoted from <span id="xvii.xvi-p32.2"></span>[1Sa
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md)<span
id="xvii.xvi-p32.2"></span>.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p33"></span>He afterwards adds, *I will be to you a
God, and ye shall be to me a people; and ye shall walk in all the way
which I shall shew to you, that it may be well with you.* The Prophet
confirms what I have already said, that if we would obey God, we must
consider what he commands. Now God omits no part of true worship: we
shall then never go astray from true religion, if only we render
ourselves teachable. Whence then is it, that men diligently labor and
profit nothing, except that they are deaf to God’s voice? for as it has
been already often said, God has not only spoken generally, and in
various ways, of obedience, but has clearly and distinctly taught what
he approves. Our obedience then will please him, if only we learn what
he would have us to do.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p34"></span>And at the same time he adds, that this
condition was mentioned to the Jews, that it *would be well with them,*
if they only obeyed God. Hence their perverseness is more fully
detected; for they willfully sought to be miserable, and procured for
themselves their own destruction: for a happy life was offered to them,
provided only they submitted to God. Since they refused this, who does
not see that they willfully gave themselves up to misery, as though they
wished to provoke God’s anger, and did so designedly? for it immediately
follows —

<span id="xvii.xvi-p35"></span><span id="xvii.xvi-p35.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xvi-p36"></span>*They hearkened not nor inclined their
ear* Here the Prophet shews, that the Jews did not then begin to be
rebellious against God and his word; for they imitated the impious
contumacy of their fathers: and he dwells on this more at large. He now
says, “I gave no command about sacrifices, but only this one thing I
required of your fathers, to obey me.” *They hearkened not,* he says.
What could have been a juster demand than that they should obey God? How
great, then, and how base an indignity it was, to reject his authority?
Nay, still more, they *inclined not the ear:* for by this phrase the
Prophet means not only a contempt of his word and indifference, but
their obstinacy and willfulness, inasmuch as they had hardened
themselves against God. Hypocrites do, indeed, sometimes incline the
ear, and wish to know what is said, and in some measure consider it: but
the Prophet here sets forth as it were the insane contumacy of the Jews,
for they *inclined not,* no, not even *the ear* to God speaking to them.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p37"></span>He afterwards adds, that they *walked in
their tortuous counsels,* and also, *in the wickedness of their evil
heart*  <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) This comparison
aggravates their sin, — the Jews preferred to follow their own humor
rather than to obey God and his commands. Had anything been set before
them, which might have deceived them and obscured the authority of the
law, there would have been some excuse: but when there was nothing to
prevent them from obeying the command of God, except that they followed
their own foolish imaginations, they were wholly inexcusable. For what
excuse could they have made? That they wished to be wiser than God! How
great a madness was this, and how diabolical? But the Prophet leaves
them nothing but this vain excuse, which doubled their guilt. They
thought, no doubt, that their heart was well fitted for the purpose: but
he does not here allow them to judge, but distinctly condemns them as
they deserved.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p41"></span>We ought to take particular notice of
this passage; for the majority of men at this day set up their own
fictions against God’s word. The Papists indeed pretend antiquity; they
say that they have been taught by their ancestors; and at the same time
they plead councils and the ordinances of the fathers: but yet there is
not one of them, who is not addicted to his own figments, and who does
not take the liberty, nay, an unbridled license, to reject whatever he
pleases. Moreover, if the origin of the whole Papal worship be
considered, it will appear, that those who first devised so many strange
superstitions, were only impelled by audacity and presumption, in order
that they might trample under foot the word of God. Hence it is, that
all things are become corrupt; for they brought in all the strange
figments of their own brains. And we see that the Papists at this day
are so perversely fixed in their own errors, that they prefer themselves
and their own trumperies to God. And the same is the case also with all
heretics. What then is to be done? Obedience, as I have said, is to be
held as the basis of all true religion. If, then, on the other hand, we
wish to render our worship approved by God, let us learn to cast aside
whatever is our own, so that his authority may prevail over all our
reasons.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p42"></span>Let us further notice how detestable a
sacrilege it is, to follow the wickedness of our heart rather than to
obey God, when he shews to us, as by the finger, the way of salvation.
Let us also observe, that nothing will then do us good, though we may
seem to ourselves to be very wise, and praise ourselves in our folly;
for God declares here that our *heart is evil* whenever we turn aside
from his pure word.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p43"></span>He says, that they *were behind and not
before* By this phrase he intimates that the Jews turned the back, that
they might not look at him or go forward. For when one promises to be
our leader to conduct us in the way, we immediately turn our eyes to
him; but when we turn our back, it is a proof of our contempt. And thus
God complains of his people, that he was despised by them; for they had
not only been deaf to the prophetic teaching and admonitions, but had
also turned their faces another way, as a proof of a contumacy still
worse, so that they forsook him, and as it were bade him to be gone.
 <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) This is the import of the last
sentence. We shall proceed to-morrow.

<span id="xvii.xvii"></span>

<span id="xvii.xvii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xvii.xvii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast at
this day so clearly revealed to us thy will that there can remain no
pretense of ignorance, we may on that account submit to thee with a
freer and more ready mind, and that we may not only incline our ears to
thee, but also so attend to thee with all our hearts, that we may desire
no other thing than to make our whole life approved by thee: and as we
cannot but turn aside, through our obstinacy and wickedness, from the
right way, do thou so enlighten us by the Spirit of wisdom and
knowledge, that we may strive to embrace whatever thou hast been pleased
to prescribe to us in thy word, so that when the course of this life
shall be finished, we may at length reach the goal, and partake of the
fruit of our obedience, and enjoy that eternal inheritance, which thine
only — begotten Son has procured for us by his own blood. — Amen.

<span id="xvii.xix"></span>

<span id="xvii.xix-p1"></span><span id="xvii.xix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#025.md)<span
id="xvii.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xix-p2"></span>**25**. Since the day that your fathers
came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto
you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending
*them*:

<span id="xvii.xix-p3"></span>**25**. Ab eo die quo egressi sunt patres
vestri e terra Egypti usque ad diem hunc misi ad vos omnes servos meos
prophetas, quotidie mane surgendo et mittendo:

<span id="xvii.xix-p4"></span>**26**. Yet they hearkened not unto me,
nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than
their fathers.

<span id="xvii.xix-p5"></span>**26**. Et non audierunt me, et non
inclinaverunt aurem suam; et (*pro* sed) obdurarunt cervicem suam,
perverse egerunt prae patribus suis.

<span id="xvii.xix-p6"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xix-p7"></span><span id="xvii.xix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xix-p8"></span>God complains of the perverse wickedness
of the people, — that he had lost all his labor in endeavoring to lead
them to repentance, not only in one age, but that the children succeeded
their fathers in their corruptions, and that thus the imitation had
become perpetual. This might indeed appear as an extenuation of their
fault; they might have pleaded as the Papists at this day do; who have
no pretext more specious, than when they bring against us the Fathers
and antiquity. But God shews in this place and elsewhere that the
children are not excused by the examples of their fathers; but on the
contrary, that it is an aggravation of the crime, when men thus harden
themselves, and think that a continued indulgence in vices avails them
for a precedent; for God does not thus permit himself to be deprived of
his own right. This passage then deserves particular notice; for God not
only condemned those who were then living and whom Jeremiah addressed,
but also connected with them the dead, in order to prove their greater
obstinacy, as impiety had been as it were handed down from one age to
another.

<span id="xvii.xix-p9"></span>*From the day,* he says, *in which your
fathers came forth from the land of Egypt unto this day, have I sent to
you,* etc. We know how intractable the people had been from the
beginning; for they did all they could to reject Moses, the minister of
a favor so remarkable and invaluable. And after their deliverance, they
were continually either clamoring against God, or openly contending with
Moses and Aaron, or running into gross idolatry, or giving loose reins
to their lusts; in short, there was no end to their course of sinning:
and yet Moses daily endeavored to restore them to obedience. It was this
great contumacy that God now refers to; and he says, that the Israelites
did not then begin to be disobedient, but that they had ever been of
such a disposition as not to bear to be corrected, as he will tell us
hereafter. It was not necessary here to adduce examples to shew that the
people had been indomitable; for this was evident from sacred history.
It was enough to remind them, that the hardness and obstinacy of the
fathers had descended to their children, so that they might know that
they were twofold and treblefold guilty before God, for they had
imitated the perverseness which God had before severely punished; nor
was it unknown to them how God had brought judgments on their fathers.
It was therefore to provoke God most wantonly, when they overlooked and
disregarded such dreadful vengeances as he had executed on their
progenitors. We shall hereafter see similar declarations; nay, this way
of speaking occurs everywhere in the prophets, that is, that their race
had been from the beginning perverse and rebellious, and that they had
also in all ages despised the favor of God and obstinately resisted the
prophets.

<span id="xvii.xix-p10"></span>But God reminds them here, that from the
day they came forth from the land of Egypt he had never ceased to speak
to them even to *the time* of Jeremiah: this his perseverance greatly
aggravated the sin of the people. Had God spoken only once, it would
have been sufficient for their condemnation: but inasmuch as he had
borne with their perverse conduct, and never ceased from day to day
kindly to call them to himself and to promise them pardon and to offer
salvation to them — inasmuch then as God had thus persevered, the more
fully discovered was the irreclaimable impiety of the people. We indeed
know how dreadful a punishment must await those who dare thus to abuse
the forbearance of God and openly to scorn his word, when he invites
them a hundred or a thousand times to repentance.

<span id="xvii.xix-p11"></span>He afterwards adds, that he had *sent all
his servants*,  <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) etc In the same
sense is to be taken the universal particle, <span
id="xvii.xix-p16.1"></span>כל, *cal, “*all.” Had God sent only one
prophet, there would have remained no excuse for the Israelites; but as
he had continually sent one after another, to train them up like an
army, how great was their madness to despise so large a number? We
indeed know that there were never wanting prophets among the people, as
Moses had promised in the eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy. As then God
had dealt bountifully with the people, so that prophets had never ceased
but continually succeeded one another, hence surely the baseness of
their impious obstinacy became more evident; for they had not despised
God only for one day, nor disregarded one prophet, or two or three, but
resisted all the prophets, though they had been sent in great number. *I
sent,* he says, *all my servants*

<span id="xvii.xix-p17"></span>Then he adds, *daily* This is mentioned
for the same purpose, even to shew that God had never been wearied, and
that they had resisted as it were designedly his goodness, while he was
incessant in kindly exhorting them to repentance. He says, *by rising
early and sending* As we have said elsewhere, the verb <span
id="xvii.xix-p17.1"></span>שכם, *shecam,* properly means to rise early.
God here commends the authority of prophetic instruction by ascribing to
himself what is done by men. With him, indeed, as we all know, there is
no change; hence the expression, *to rise up,* as applied to him, is not
strictly true; but what he commanded his servants to do, he transfers,
as we have said, to himself, in order that he might more sharply reprove
the ingratitude of the people; as though he had said, that he had been
most carefully attentive to secure their salvation, but that they had
been torpid and wholly indifferent.

<span id="xvii.xix-p18"></span>We may hence learn a useful doctrine, —
that God rises to invite us, and also to receive us, whenever his word
is proclaimed among us, by which he testifies to us his paternal love.
God then not only employs men to lead us to himself, but comes forth in
a manner himself to meet us, and rises early as one solicitous for our
salvation. This commendation of divine truth may be of great benefit to
the faithful, and induce them to recumb confidently and with tranquil
minds on God’s promises; for they are the same as though God himself had
spoken them to us. But here is also reproved the impiety of those who
slumber and sleep, while God thus watches in order to promote their
salvation, and who lend not an ear, when he rises early to come to them
in order to draw them to himself.

<span id="xvii.xix-p19"></span><span id="xvii.xix-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xix-p20"></span>He afterwards subjoins, *And they
hearkened not* There is here a change of person; for he said in the last
verse, “*your* fathers,” “I sent to *you*;” but now he says, *They
hearkened not, nor inclined their ear* It is indeed true, that the
reference is to the fathers; but in the next verse God includes the
people who were then living. There is then no doubt but that it was an
evidence of indignation, that he changed the person, and that he was
wearied in addressing them, for he saw that he spoke in vain to a stupid
people: and this will appear evident from the next verse. *They
hearkened not,* he says, *nor inclined their ear* The words we have
already explained: the Jews are here precluded from having any excuse on
the ground of error or ignorance; for they had refused to be taught,
they would not attend, but on the contrary made deaf their cars. And he
says also, that they *hardened their neck*; by which their perverseness
is still more fully expressed: they designedly as it were despised God,
and carried on war even with his favor and kindness. And he concludes by
saying, that they had *done worse than their fathers* He had said, “your
fathers;” but now, “their fathers.” We hence see that the sentence is
changed, for God knew that he could produce no effect on them, as we
find by what follows —

<span id="xvii.xx"></span>

<span id="xvii.xx-p1"></span><span id="xvii.xx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#027.md)<span id="xvii.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xx-p2"></span>**27**. Therefore thou shalt speak all
these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt
also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.

<span id="xvii.xx-p3"></span>**27**. Et dices illis omnia verba haec, et
non audient to (*vel*, non auscultabunt tibi,) et clamabis ad eos, et
non respondebunt tibi.

<span id="xvii.xx-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xx-p5"></span><span id="xvii.xx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xx-p6"></span>Here is seen more clearly what I have
stated, — that the Jews were not addressed, because they had no ears.
Here then God addresses his Prophet and says, “The children will be like
their parents: for thou shalt indeed bear the commands which I give
thee, but it will be without any advantage; for they *will not hear,*
and when thou *callest to them,* they *will not answer* ” It was a most
grievous trial to the Prophet to know that his words would pass away
with the air and produce no good. What was to be expected but that God’s
wrath would thus be still more kindled against the people? The Prophet
then must have had his mind greatly depressed; for he doubtless labored
for the good of his own nation; and we shall hereafter see how sad he
was when he understood that their final ruin was at hand. But, as we
have said elsewhere, the prophets were influenced by two feelings: for
they did not divest themselves of all human affections, inasmuch as they
loved their own nation and felt great sorrow, when God declared that he
was coming to execute judgment: but this sympathy and sorrow did not
prevent them from executing, in a bold manner, and with unshaken zeal,
what God had committed to them. Thus then the prophets had feelings to
condole with their own kindred, and at the same time were enabled to
surmount whatever might check or hinder them from performing their
office. Jeremiah did thus condole with his own nation, when he knew that
shortly ruin would overtake them; but yet he felt bound to execute what
God had bidden him to do, and to obey his call.

<span id="xvii.xx-p7"></span>However bitter therefore was the
declaration, *Thou shalt speak to them, but they will not hear,* yet
Jeremiah went forth; for he knew that he must obey God’s command,
whatever might be the issue. The same resolution ought to be formed at
this day by all the faithful ministers of God. They ought to strive as
far as they can to promote the salvation of the people; but still when
they see that their doctrine succeeds not as they wish, and that it is
the savor of death to the whole world, they ought nevertheless to follow
their course: why? because they are always a sweet and good savor to
God, whatever may be the event. God then declares to his servant what
would be the issue, in order that he might not cease to execute his
office with invincible courage, even if no fruit appeared. It was also
his purpose to shew before the time to the people their perverseness, if
there was possibly any hope, or at least, that he might doubly prove
them to be unhealable. It was further his design to consult the good of
those few who cherished true religion in their hearts, though the
multitude were running headlong to their own ruin.

<span id="xvii.xx-p8"></span>In like manner at this day it is necessary
thus to sustain the souls of the faithful; for while the ungodly rave
against God, and while almost the whole world is seized with this
madness, what would become of the godly, had they not this fact to think
of, — that it is nothing new for hypocrites, who boast that they are
God’s people and his Church, to reject his grace and to regard as
nothing his servants. This truth then is serviceable to us at this day,
and may be applied in the same way, so that our minds may not despond
nor vacillate, when we see the majority of those, whom God addresses by
his servants, heedless and deaf. *Thou shalt speak to them,* he says,
*all these words*

<span id="xvii.xx-p9"></span>He says not without a reason, *All these
words;* for if the Prophet had only briefly declared to them what he had
heard from God’s mouth, he might have discharged his office with less
weariness; but when he had often repeated what had been committed to
him, it was not done without great trouble and sorrow; for as we have
said at the beginning, he spent his labor on the people, not for one
year or for ten years; for he preached to them for twenty, thirty, forty
years, and pursued his course even beyond that time. When he saw the
truth of God thus rejected by the people, how could he otherwise than
feel weariness at times? It is therefore not in vain intimated, as I
have said, that he was chosen, that he might try, not only for one day,
or for a few months or years, whether he could recover the people to the
way of salvation, but that he was to go on through all obstacles, so as
not to faint, whatever might take place. *They will not hear thee,* he
says: and further, —

<span id="xvii.xx-p10"></span>*Thou shalt call to them, and they will
not answer thee* This also, which God foretells him, is emphatical, —
that if the Prophet called most loudly, (as Isaiah is bidden to do,
(<span id="xvii.xx-p10.1"></span>[Isa
58:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001)<span id="xvii.xx-p10.1"></span>,.md)
and in his person all teachers,) and called even to hoarseness, yet he
is told they would not answer. This shews still more fully their
perverseness; for they were not only deaf to God’s voice and neglected
plain teaching, but also disregarded the most vehement exhortations, he
then adds —

<span id="xvii.xxi"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p1"></span><span id="xvii.xxi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#028.md)<span id="xvii.xxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p2"></span>**28**. But thou shalt say unto them, This
*is* a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor
receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their
mouth.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p3"></span>**28**. Et dices ad eos, Haec gens, quae
non audierunt vocem Jehovae Dei sui, et non receperunt disciplinam;
periit veritas et excisa est ab ore eorum.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xxi-p5"></span><span id="xvii.xxi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p6"></span>God shews now that he must act in a new
way. The first duty of teachers is to set forth the will of God, to shew
what is right, and then to exhort, if plain teaching proves not
sufficient. But God intimates here that he was under the necessity to
change his manner, because they were wholly irreclaimable. *Thou shalt*
then *say* this as the last thing; as though he had said, “I indeed
wished to try, whether they were capable of being improved, and have
employed thee for this purpose: after having long borne with them,
knowing by a long trial that thy labor is useless, thou shalt say to
them, “I bid you adieu at last.” For what is the meaning of these words,
*This is a nation which heard not the voice of its God,* except that the
Prophet, after long trials, knew that he was neither to teach nor exhort
them? It is not to be doubted but that God referred to the Jews
themselves; for it was his object to expose their impious perverseness.
He yet comforted his servant; for he hence knew, that though he could do
no good to his hearers, yet his labor was acceptable to God and not
without its fruit: for the truth of God is not only fruitful in the
salvation of men, but also in their perdition. (<span
id="xvii.xxi-p6.1"></span>[2 Cor.
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016)<span id="xvii.xxi-p6.1"></span>..md)
God then shews, that there would be no loss to his servant, even though
the Jews repented not; for he would be their judge, and denounce by the
highest authority their destruction.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p7"></span>We now perceive the design of the Holy
Spirit, in saying, *Thou shalt* at length *say, This is a nation which
has not hearkened to the voice of its God:* for the Prophet is not
bidden here to address the Jews, but to pronounce on them a sentence,
that the whole world might know how base and detestable had been their
contumacy, and how abominable their impiety; for the whole nation had
refused to hear The word *nation* seems here to be taken in a bad sense:
it is indeed in many places to be taken for “people;” but in other
places Scripture sets <span id="xvii.xxi-p7.1"></span>גוים, *guim,* in
opposition to God’s chosen people. And perhaps this word has been used,
that the Jews might know that they in vain gloried in their own dignity.
He shews that they did not excel other nations, for they were themselves
of the same class, a nation. *This is a nation,* he says, *which has not
hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God*  <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) In saying this he doubtless amplified
their crime; for as God had made himself plainly known to the Jews, they
could not pretend ignorance nor plead any doubt respecting what the
prophets taught. As then they had designedly rejected their own God,
they hence became more obviously guilty and abominable.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p9"></span>He afterwards adds, *They have not
received correction,* he points out the very source of rebellion, — they
were unwilling to undertake the yoke. Here then he excludes all those
plausible pretences by which the Jews might cloak their impiety, as
hypocrites are ever wont to do. Hence he declares that they had been
unteachable, for they had refused correction. The word <span
id="xvii.xxi-p9.1"></span>מוסר, *musar*, often means chastisement; but
generally signifies every kind of training. As the subject here is
teaching, the Prophet means that they were willfully blind, for they
would not be taught; Now this is the extremity of wicked perverseness,
that is, when men become so degenerated, that they willfully assimilate
themselves to brute beasts by rejecting the yoke of God.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p10"></span>He then subjoins, that *truth,* or faith,
had *perished* The word <span id="xvii.xxi-p10.1"></span>אמונה, *amune,*
may be taken in two senses. Some refer it to what belongs to God, as
meaning religion, or faith: or piety. But the Prophet seems to take it
in a larger sense, as signifying what is sincere; for they acted
perfidiously towards men as well as towards God. The word then is to be
taken simply as meaning integrity, as though he had said, that nothing
true or sincere remained in them, but that they were so corrupt that
they mocked God and deceived men, and that nothing but dissimulation
prevailed among them. This meaning is confirmed by what follows, that it
is *cut off from their mouth*  <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md)
We hence learn that their perfidy is condemned because they acted
falsely; and as their heart was full of duplicity, so also was their
tongue. He intimates, in short, that there was no hope as to their
repentance; for had they promised a hundred times to God to be teachable
and obedient, and shewed before the world any appearance of integrity,
their promises would have passed off into mere fallacies and deceptions.
He then adds —

<span id="xvii.xxii"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxii-p1"></span><span
id="xvii.xxii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#029.md)<span id="xvii.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxii-p2"></span>**29**. Cut off thine hair, *O
Jerusalem*, and cast *it* away, and take up a lamentation on high
places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his
wrath.

<span id="xvii.xxii-p3"></span>**29**. Tonde comam tuam et projice et
attolle super excelsa lamentationem; quid reprobavit (*vel,* vilipendit;
*sed verbum reprobandi magis placet hoc loco*) Jehova, et reliquit
aetatem indignationis suae.

<span id="xvii.xxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xxii-p5"></span><span id="xvii.xxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxii-p6"></span>Here again Jeremiah exhorts his own
people to lament; and he uses the feminine gender, as though he called
the people, the daughter of Sion, or the daughter of Jerusalem. He then,
according to a common mode of speaking, calls the whole people a woman.
 <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md)

<span id="xvii.xxii-p8"></span>He first bids her to *shave off the hair*
The word <span id="xvii.xxii-p8.1"></span>נזר, *nesar,* means the hair,
derived from the Nazarites, who allowed their hair to grow: and there
may be here a striking allusion to the Nazarites who were sacred to God;
as though he had said, “This people are profane, and therefore ought to
have nothing in common with the Nazarites.” Hence also is derived <span
id="xvii.xxii-p8.2"></span>נזר, *nesar*, a crown. Though then the word
means the hair, yet the allusion is not to be overlooked, — that this
people, rejected by God, are bidden to cut off and to throw away the
hair. After the throwing away of the hair there was to be great
lamentation; *Raise,* he says, *on high places a lamentation* This may
seem to be an exhortation to repentance: but as we have seen elsewhere,
though the prophets often gave the people the hope of pardon and
reconciliation, yet in this place the Prophet no doubt denounces a final
judgment, and is a herald of lamentation, because the prevailing impiety
was irreclaimable. He does not then perform here the duty of a teacher,
but in a hostile manner denounces ruin: for it immediately follows —

<span id="xvii.xxii-p9"></span>*For rejected hath Jehovah and forsaken
the generation of his wrath* The word <span
id="xvii.xxii-p9.1"></span>דור, *dur,* means an age, not time, but men
of the same age: as we call that our generation which now lives in the
world, and that which is dead the generation of our fathers, and what
succeeds us the next generation. It is indeed true, that the Israelites
in every age were worthy of a similar vengeance; but God no doubt shews
here, that his vengeance was at hand, for he had long borne with the
perverse conduct of the people, and suspended his judgment. As then
vengeance was now to be executed, the Prophet calls that age the age of
God’s wrath; for we know that the genitive case in Hebrew has often such
a meaning as this. Then the age of his wrath means the age or generation
devoted to extreme vengeance; for their wickedness against God was
extreme, as long as he treated them with forbearance. The longer then he
had deferred his judgment, the heavier punishment was at hand. It
afterwards follows —

<span id="xvii.xxiii-p6"></span>Lest the Jews should murmur and complain
that God was too rigorous, the Prophet adds, that they were not given up
to destruction without the justest reasons. How so? They had *done evil*
To do evil here means, that they had not offended in one thing, but had
given themselves up to wickedness and evil doings. It is the same as
though he had said, that they were so corrupt that they were wholly
inured to the doing of evil, and had by long use contracted evil habits;
for they continually provoked God. But as they flattered themselves, the
Prophet reminds them here of God’s judgment: “It is enough, “he says,
“that the Judge condemns you; for if ye see not your wickedness nor
acknowledge your sin, yet this will not avail you; for God declares that
you are guilty in his sight.”

<span id="xvii.xxiii-p7"></span>We see that there is an implied contrast
between the sight of God and the delusions by which hypocrites soothed
themselves, while they made evasions or perversely excused their sins,
or sought to escape by circuitous windings. God then shews that his own
sight, or knowledge, is sufficient, how blind soever man may be, and
however the whole world may connive at their sins.

<span id="xvii.xxiii-p8"></span>He adds one kind of sin, that they had
*set up their abominations*  <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) in
the Temple. This refers to superstitions. But as we have seen elsewhere,
and shall often have to observe, the Prophets frequently reproved sins
by mentioning only one sin for the whole. Then what was especially
wicked in the people he states, and that was, that the Temple was
*polluted* with superstitions. We have already said, that it was an
intolerable sacrilege to pollute the Temple with abominations, which was
then the only true Temple in the world: for it was God’s will that
sacrifices should be offered to him in that one place; and he had
carefully described everything necessary for a right worship. When,
therefore, the Jews polluted that very Temple, how abominable was such a
profanation? It was not then without reason that the Prophet brings
forward what was especially wicked in the people, — that God’s house was
polluted with superstitious and many spurious ceremonies, and that there
his whole worship was vitiated. The rest to-morrow.

<span id="xvii.xxiv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xvii.xxiv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou so
constantly invitest us, daily and even hourly, to thyself, we may not
give thee occasion to complain, as of thy people of old, that we are
deaf and thus neglect thy holy admonitions, but that we may be teachable
and submissive to thee, and that, as thou risest early, we may also be
ready to meet thee, and be obedient to thee, not only for one day, but
persevere through life in the same course, until at length we shall
reach that blessed rest, prepared for us in heaven by Jesus Christ our
Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xvii.xxv-p1"></span>Lecture Thirty-First

<span id="xvii.xxvi"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p1"></span><span
id="xvii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md)<span id="xvii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p2"></span>**31**. And they have built the high
places of Tophet, which *is* in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn
their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded *them*
not, neither came it into my heart.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p3"></span>**31**. Et aedificavit excelsa Topheth,
quae in valle filii Hinnom, ut comburerent filios suos et filias suas
igni; quod non mandavi, et non ascendit super cor meum.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p5"></span><span id="xvii.xxvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p6"></span>Jeremiah in this verse also inveighs
against those superstitions by which the Jews had corrupted the true and
pure worship of God. He says, that they had *builded high places,* which
was prohibited in the law. (<span id="xvii.xxvi-p6.1"></span>[Le
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#030.md)<span
id="xvii.xxvi-p6.1"></span>.) Now God, as it has been before said,
prefers obedience to all sacrifices, (<span
id="xvii.xxvi-p6.2"></span>[1Sa
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md)<span
id="xvii.xxvi-p6.2"></span>:) hence the Prophet justly condemned them,
that they forsook the Temple and built for themselves high places or
groves, and also altars.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p7"></span>He then mentions one particular place,
even *Tophet in the valley of Hinnom* The prophets, in order to render
the place detestable, no doubt designated the infernal regions by <span
id="xvii.xxvi-p7.1"></span>תפת*, Tophet,* and <span
id="xvii.xxvi-p7.2"></span>גיא הנם, *gia enom.* For when Isaiah speaks,
in the thirtieth chapter, of the eternal punishment of the wicked, he
mentions Tophet, which is the same word as we find here. As to the
*valley of Hinnom,* it is called in Greek Gehenna, and is taken to
designate eternal death, or the torments which await all the wicked. In
a similar manner the word Paradise is metaphorically taken for the
blessed state and for the eternal inheritance; for God so placed man at
first in that eastern garden, that he might in a manner protect him
under his own wings. As then the blessing and favor of God shone on that
place where Adam first dwelt, that it might be a certain image of
celestial life and of true happiness, so they called the glory, prepared
for all God’s children in heaven, Paradise. So also on the other hand
the prophets called hell <span id="xvii.xxvi-p7.3"></span>גיא הנם, *gia
enom,* in order that the Jews might detest those impious and
sacrilegious modes of worship by which their fathers had polluted
themselves. And for the same reason they call hell, Tophet. The ancients
also say, that it was a place in the suburbs of the city. They were not
wont then to assemble afar off for the sake of these abominations, since
the place was within sight of the Temple, and they knew that there was
the only true altar approved by God, and that it was not lawful to offer
sacrifices anywhere else. Since they knew this, and God had set such a
place before their eyes, the greater was their madness, when they
preferred a filthy spot in which to worship God according to their own
will, or rather according to their own wantonness.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p8"></span>Of this so great an audacity Jeremiah now
complains: They *builded for themselves high places, in Tophet,* even
*in the valley* He introduces the word *son;* but it is called <span
id="xvii.xxvi-p8.1"></span>הנם גיא, *gia enom,* the valley of Hinnom;
whence comes the word Gehenna, as we have already said.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p9"></span>He adds, *that they might burn their sons
and their daughters* It was a horrible and prodigious madness for
parents not to spare their own children, but to cast them into the fire;
for they must have been so seized with a diabolic fury as to divest
themselves of all human feelings: and yet they had a plausible reason,
as they supposed; for it was a zeal worthy of all praise to prefer God
to their own children. When therefore they cast their children into the
fire, this kind of zeal might have deceived the simple; and to this was
added a pretext derived from example, for Abraham was prepared to
sacrifice his own son. But it hence appears what men will do when they
are led away by an inconsiderate zeal; for from the beginning of the
world the source of all superstitions has been this, — that men have
devised for themselves various modes of worship, and have given
themselves the liberty to seek a way of their own to pacify God.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p10"></span>As to the pretended example, they were
so blind as not to distinguish between themselves and Abraham; for he
was commanded to offer his son, (<span id="xvii.xxvi-p10.1"></span>[Ge
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002.md)<span
id="xvii.xxvi-p10.1"></span>;) but they, without any command, attempted
to do the same thing; this was extreme presumption. As to Abraham, he
obeyed God; and he could not have been led astray, when he knew that
such a sacrifice was approved by God. But when the Jews emulated his
zeal, it was an extreme folly; and they were especially culpable,
because they neglected God’s command and wholly disregarded it. They
were, however, so far carried away by their own wantonness as to cast
their own children into the fire, and under the pretense of piety: so
great and so savage a cruelty prevailed among them. We hence perceive
that there is no end of sinning, when men give themselves up to their
own inventions; for God surrenders those to Satan, that they may be led
by the spirit of giddiness and of madness and of stupidity. Let us
therefore learn ever to regard what God approves: and let this be the
very beginning of our inquiry, whenever we undertake anything, whether
God commands it; and this course ought especially to be observed with
regard to his worship; for, as it has been already stated, religion is
especially founded on faith, and faith is based on the word of God: and
hence it is here added —

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p11"></span>*Which I commanded them not, and which
never came to my mind* This reason ought to be carefully noticed, for
God here cuts off from men every occasion for making evasions, since he
condemns by this one phrase, “I have not commanded them,” whatever the
Jews devised. There is then no other argument needed to condemn
superstitions, than that they are not commanded by God: for when men
allow themselves to worship God according to their own fancies, and
attend not to his commands, they pervert true religion. And if this
principle was adopted by the Papists, all those fictitious modes of
worship, in which they absurdly exercise themselves, would fall to the
ground. It is indeed a horrible thing for the Papists to seek to
discharge their duties towards God by performing their own
superstitions. There is an immense number of them, as it is well known,
and as it manifestly appears. Were they to admit this principle, that we
cannot rightly worship God except by obeying his word, they would be
delivered from their deep abyss of error. The Prophet’s words then are
very important, when he says, that God had *commanded* no such thing,
and that it never came to his mind; as though he had said, that men
assume too much wisdom, when they devise what he never required, nay,
what he never knew. It is indeed certain, that there was nothing hid
from God, even before it was done: but God here assumes the character of
man, as though he had said, that what the Jews devised was unknown to
him, as his own law was sufficient.

<span id="xvii.xxvi-p12"></span>Now, as the words Tophet and Gehenna
were so stigmatized by the prophets, we may hence learn how displeasing
to God is every idolatry and profanation of his true and pure worship:
for he compares these notorious places in which the Jews performed so
sedulously their devotions, to the infernal regions. And hence at this
day, when the Papists boast of what they call their devotions, we may
justly say, that there are as many gates, through which they throw
themselves headlong into hell, as there are modes of worship devised by
them for the purpose of conciliating God. It follows —

<span id="xvii.xxvii"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxvii-p1"></span><span
id="xvii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#032.md)<span id="xvii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxvii-p2"></span>**32**. Therefore, behold, the days
come, saith the Lord, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the
valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall
bury in Tophet, till there be no place.

<span id="xvii.xxvii-p3"></span>**32**. Propterea, Ecce dies veniunt,
dicit Jehova, et non dicetur (*hoc est,* quibus non dicetur) Topheth et
vallis filii Hinnom, sed vallis occisionis; et sepelient Topheth, quia
non erit locus.

<span id="xvii.xxvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xxvii-p5"></span><span id="xvii.xxvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxvii-p6"></span>The Prophet denounces a punishment,
though the Jews thought that they deserved a reward. The case is the
same with the Papists at this day, who thoughtlessly boast, when they
heap together many abominations; for they think that God is bound as it
were by a law, not to overlook so much diligence. But the Prophet shews
how grossly deceived they are who worship God superstitiously, without
the authority of his word; for he threatens them here with the heaviest
judgment, — *Called no more,* he says, *shall it be Tophet, nor The
valley of the son of Hinnom; but The valley of slaughter shall it be
called;* for the whole land was to be filled with slaughters.

<span id="xvii.xxvii-p7"></span>He adds, *Bury shall they* there, for
elsewhere *there will be no place*  <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) He intimates that so great would be
the slaughters, that Jerusalem would not contain the dead: hence, he
says, graves will be made in Tophet; and many also will be slain there.
A dead body, we know, was unclean by the Law; and it was not lawful to
offer sacrifices to God near graves. (<span
id="xvii.xxvii-p8.3"></span>[Num.
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#011.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#016.md)<span
id="xvii.xxvii-p8.3"></span>.) The Prophet then shows, that when the
Jews foolishly consecrated that place to God, they committed a dreadful
profanation, for that place was to be wholly filled with dead bodies,
and polluted also by the slaughter of men. We hence see what the
superstitious do when they follow their own devices — that they provoke
God’s wrath; for by the grievousness of the punishment we may form a
judgment as to the degree in which God abominates all false modes of
worship, which men devise without the warrant of his law; for we must
ever remember this principle, *I commanded it not, nor hath it ever come
to my mind* It follows —

<span id="xvii.xxviii"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p1"></span><span
id="xvii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#033.md)<span
id="xvii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p2"></span>**33**. And the carcases of this people
shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the
earth; and none shall fray *them* away.

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p3"></span>**33**. Et erit cadaver populi hujus in
cibum avi coelorum (avibus) et bestiae terrae (*hoc est,* bestiis) nec
erit qui absterreat (*hoc est,* qui terrore abigat.)

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p5"></span><span id="xvii.xxviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p6"></span>Jeremiah threatens them with something
more grievous than death itself, — that God would impress the marks of
his wrath even on their dead bodies. It is indeed true what a heathen
poet says,

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p7"></span>*“That the loss of a grave is not
great,” (*Virgil, *aeneid;)*

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p8"></span>but we must on the other hand remember
that burying has been held as a sacred custom in all ages; for it was a
symbol of the last resurrection. Barbarous then were the words, “Give me
a stick, if you fear that birds will eat my dead body;” as the cynic,
who had ordered his body to be cast into the field, derided what was
said in answer to him, “The wild beasts and birds will devour thee:”
“Oh,” said he, “let me have a stick, and I will drive them away;”
intimating by such a saying, that he would then be without any feeling;
but he shewed that he entertained no hope of immortality. But it was
God’s will that the custom of burying should prevail among all nations,
that in death itself there might be some evidence or intimation of the
last resurrection. When therefore the Prophet declares here and in other
places that the Jews would be without a burial, he doubtless enhances
the vengeance of God.

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p9"></span>We indeed know that some of the most
holy men had not been buried; for the prophets were sometimes exposed to
wild beasts and birds: and the whole Church complains in <span
id="xvii.xxviii-p9.1"></span>[Ps
79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002.md)<span
id="xvii.xxviii-p9.1"></span>, that the dead bodies of the saints were
exposed and became food for birds and wild beasts. This has sometimes
happened; for God often mixes the good with the evil in temporal
punishments, as he makes his sun to rise on the good and the evil: but
yet of itself and for the most part, it is an evidence of a curse, when
a man’s body is cast away without any burial.

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p10"></span>It is this then that the Prophet means
when he says, *The carcase of this people shall be meat for the birds of
the air and for the beasts of the earth, and there will be none to
terrify* them;  <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) that is, there
will be no one to perform the humane office of driving the beasts away,
the very thing which nature itself would lead one to do. If any one now
objects and says, that in this case the faithful could not be
distinguished from the reprobate, the answer is plainly this, — that
when the honor of a burial is denied to the faithful, God will become
the avenger. But this does not prove that God does not in this way
inflict a visible punishment on the reprobate, and thus expose them to
reproach by whom he has been despised. He afterwards adds —

<span id="xvii.xxix"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxix-p1"></span><span
id="xvii.xxix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#034.md)<span id="xvii.xxix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxix-p2"></span>**34**. Then will I cause to cease from
the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of
mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the
voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.

<span id="xvii.xxix-p3"></span>**34**. Et cessare faciam ex urbibus
Jehudah et ex compitis Jerusalem vocem gaudii et vocem laetitiae, vocem
sponsi et vocem sponsae; quia in vastitatem erit (*hoc est,* redigetur)
terra.

<span id="xvii.xxix-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xxix-p5"></span><span id="xvii.xxix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxix-p6"></span>He still continues the same subject; for
he denounces on the Jews the punishment which they had deserved. He more
fully expresses what he mentioned in the last verse respecting the
shameful and dreadful barbarity that would follow the slaughter; for the
whole country would not only be harassed by the enemy, but wholly laid
waste: for when sounds of joy and gladness cease, all places are filled
with lamentations; and when no marriages are celebrated, it is a sign of
devastation.

<span id="xvii.xxix-p7"></span>But by marriage, the Prophet, stating a
part for the whole, understands whatever was necessary for the
preservation of society; it is the same as though he had said, “There
shall be now no marrying:” for without marriages the human race cannot
continue. Hence this cessation would be the same, as though he had said,
that they would be wholly regardless of all those things necessary to
perpetuate mankind. He thus adds nothing new, but expands what we have
before observed, — that the whole land would be filled with dead bodies,
and that there would be such lamentation as to deter men from all their
usual and ordinary habits: he afterwards shews more fully the same
thing.

<span id="xvii.i-p17"></span> Though the ancient versions, except the
*Vulgate*, render the verb to dwell, as an Hiphil, “cause to dwell,“ as
in our version, yet *Blayney*, as well as *Calvin*, follows the
*Vulgate*, “And I will dwell with you in this place:“ which seems more
accordant with the context. Their boast was that God was dwelling with
them, as the temple was his temple. Then when Shiloh, in <span
id="xvii.i-p17.1"></span>[Jer
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012.md)<span id="xvii.i-p17.1"></span>,
is referred to, God says that he set his name there: and no doubt the
same thing is meant here. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_189"></span>[190](cc17016.htm#fr_189.md) <span
id="xvii.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p22"></span> The difficulty in the construction is
removed by *Blayney*, who renders <span id="xvii.i-p22.1"></span>דברי as
a participle, as it is in some other places, <span
id="xvii.i-p22.2"></span>[Ps 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006.md)<span
id="xvii.i-p22.2"></span>: <span id="xvii.i-p22.3"></span>[Ps

<span id="xvii.i-p22.4"></span>[Ps
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#011.md)<span id="xvii.i-p22.4"></span>.
His version is, —

<span id="xvii.i-p23"></span>Trust ye not in those who speak falsehood,
saying, —  
The Temple of Jehovah, the Temple of Jehovah, The Temple of Jehovah, are
these.

<span id="xvii.i-p24"></span>The *Septuagint*, the *Syriac*, and the
*Arabic*, have “the Temple of the Lord” only twice, and the verb is in
the singular number, “The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord it
is.” The verb is the same in the *Vulgate*, only the words, as in
Hebrew, and also in the *Targum*, are repeated thrice. The paraphrase of
the latter is rather singular, — “Trust not in the words of the prophets
of falsehood, who say, Before the Temple of the Lord ye worship, before
the Temple of the Lord ye sacrifice, before the Temple of the Lord ye
offer praise; three times a year ye appear before him.”

<span id="xvii.i-p25"></span>“These” mean, as *Gataker* thinks, these
places or buildings; and *Lowth* and *Blayney* think the same. The
repetition seems to denote the frequency with which the Jews used the
words: they continually boasted of having God’s Temple among them. “The
Prophet,“ says *Henry*, “repeats it, because they repeated it upon all
occasions. It was the cant of the times. If they heard an awakening
sermon, they lulled themselves asleep again with this, ‘We cannot but do
well, for we have the Temple of the Lord among us.’ It is common for
those that are farthest from God to boast themselves most of their being
near to the Church.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[191](cc17016.htm#fr_190.md) <span
id="xvii.iv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p18"></span> What is to be understood by innocent
blood in not only murder, nor principally; but the offering of innocent
infants to Moloch, referred to in the 31st verse of this chapter. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[192](cc17016.htm#fr_191.md) <span
id="xvii.iv-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p22"></span> *Calvin* departs here from his former
rendering in verse 3d. The words mean the same, “Then will I dwell with
you.” So the *Vulgate.* — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_192"></span>[193](cc17016.htm#fr_192.md) <span
id="xvii.vi-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p17"></span> The three foregoing verses admit of a
different construction, though the general meaning continues the same.
It is usual to consider the words in the ninth verse as verbs in the
infinitive mood; but they are participles, and stand connected with the
previous verse. The *Targum* render them as personal nouns, “thieves,
murderers,“ etc.: but they are in Hebrew in the singular number, the
collective singular being often employed in that language. The passage
may be thus rendered, —

<span id="xvii.vi-p18"></span>**8.** Behold, ye trust in words of
falsehood to no profit, —

<span id="xvii.vi-p19"></span>**9.** The thief, murderer, and adulterer,
And the false swearer and incense-burner to Baal, And the walker after
foreign gods, Whom ye have not known;

<span id="xvii.vi-p20"></span>**10.** And ye come and stand before me In
this house, on which is called my name, And ye say, “We are freed To do
all these abominations,”

<span id="xvii.vi-p21"></span>Or,

<span id="xvii.vi-p22"></span>And ye say, “He has made us free To do all
these abominations.”

<span id="xvii.vi-p23"></span>*Blayney,* following the *Syriac,* has
rendered the words, —

<span id="xvii.vi-p24"></span> And say, Deliver us, that we may practice
all these abominations.

<span id="xvii.vi-p25"></span>But what is most consistent with the
passage is to consider the sentence as declarative, and not as a prayer.
They considered themselves freed from guilt when they had offered their
sacrifices. They thought themselves then at liberty to be immoral and
also to be idolatrous. We might think such a state of blindness and
infatuation impossible; but it has existed among those calling
themselves Christians, and it exists now. *Gataker* mentions a common
saying among ignorant Papists of the same import with what is said here,
“We must sin to be shriven, and shriven to sin.” The turning of the
grace of God into lasciviousness is the same thing. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[194](cc17016.htm#fr_193.md) <span
id="xvii.vi-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p28"></span> It is to be observed that one only of the
vices mentioned in verse 9 is here referred to, the first in the
catalogue. But as the Temple was the den of thieves, so it was also made
the asylum of murderers, adulterers, and of idolaters. It seems then,
that the Jews thought that by sacrifices they purchased immunity not
only for theft, murder, adultery, false swearing, but also for idolatry,
and that having sacrificed they were free to commit all these evils. How
unaccountably strange is the conduct of deluded man!

<span id="xvii.vi-p29"></span>The words “Which is called by my name,“
are literally, “Which called is my name upon it,“ an idiomatic mode of
speaking, with which the *Welsh* exactly corresponds, —

<span id="xvii.vi-p30"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p30.1"></span>Yr hwn y
gelwir fy enw arno.

<span id="xvii.vi-p31"></span>The pronoun relative without a preposition
is afterwards followed by a pronoun substantive with a preposition
prefixed. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[195](cc17016.htm#fr_194.md) <span
id="xvii.vi-p37.4"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p38"></span> The verb is in the past tense,-

<span id="xvii.vi-p39"></span>I also, behold, seen have I, saith
Jehovah.

<span id="xvii.vi-p40"></span>That is, He had seen all they did. If
anything be put after “seen,“ it should be “these things,“ and not “it;”
for the reference is to the particulars before mentioned. See <span

<span id="xvii.ix-p11"></span> This was in the tribe of Ephraim, between
Bethel and Shechem, <span id="xvii.ix-p11.1"></span>[Jud
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#019.md)<span id="xvii.ix-p11.1"></span>,
about twenty-five miles north of Jerusalem. The Ark had been there more
than 300 years. It did not return there after it was brought forth in
the war against the Philistines. The place afterwards declined, and its
ruinous state became a proverb. See <span id="xvii.ix-p11.2"></span>[Jos

<span id="fn_196"></span>[197](cc17016.htm#fr_196.md) <span
id="xvii.ix-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ix-p14"></span> *Blayney* thinks that the reference is
not to the ruinous condition of Shiloh, immediately subsequent to the
time when the Ark was removed thence, but to the devastation occasioned
by the captivity of the ten tribes, which was a recent occurrence, this
reason is, because they were then directed to go and see the place. But
if the place had ever continued in a ruinous state, and was so at that
time, there was every propriety in saying, “Go now and see it.” Besides,
the argument is not so complete, as when its dilapidated state,
occasioned by the sins of the people, when the Ark was thence removed,
is referred to. “It is probable,“ says *Henry*, “that the ruins of that
once flourishing city were yet remaining: however, they might read the
history of it, which ought to affect them as if they saw the place.” —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[198](cc17016.htm#fr_197.md) <span
id="xvii.ix-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ix-p19"></span> The literal rendering of the two verses
is as follows:-

<span id="xvii.ix-p20"></span>**13.** And now, as ye have done all these
doings, saith Jehovah, And *as* I have spoken to you, rising early and
speaking, And ye have not hearkened, And I have called you, and ye have
not answered;

<span id="xvii.ix-p21"></span>**14.** I will also do to the house, On
which my name is called, In which ye trust, and to the place, Which I
gave to you and to your fathers, According to what I did to Shiloh:

<span id="xvii.ix-p22"></span>“The house” was the Temple, “the place”
was the city: both are threatened with destruction. Then he says in the
next verse, “And I will cast you from my presence.” The Temple and the
city were to be destroyed like Shiloh; and *they* (“you”) were to be
dealt with as their brethren, the ten tribes, who had been driven into
exile. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[199](cc17016.htm#fr_198.md) <span
id="xvii.x-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.x-p7"></span> This is hardly correct. The reference is to
the state of the Jews at that time. The Jews were formed of two tribes,
Judah and Benjamin. They were joined, after the captivity of Israel, by
several of the remnants both of Ephraim and Manasseh, and of the other
tribes. (<span id="xvii.x-p7.1"></span>[2Ch
34:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2034.htm#009)<span id="xvii.x-p7.1"></span>..md)
There is indeed mention made of some from the tribes of Ephraim,
Manasseh, and Simeon, coming to worship at Jerusalem in the reign of
Asa; but we do not read that they settled there. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[200](cc17016.htm#fr_199.md) <span
id="xvii.xi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p9"></span> There are here *three* things forbidden;
their distinctive character is not correctly given in our version nor by
*Calvin.* I render the verse thus, —

<span id="xvii.xi-p10"></span>And thou, be not an intercessor for this
people, Nor raise for them a cry and a supplication, Nor make an
entreaty to me, For I will not hear thee.

<span id="xvii.xi-p11"></span>That is, “Undertake not their cause as one
who intercedes or mediates between a judge and a criminal, nor cry
suppliantly for mercy, nor entreat me to be favorable to them.” He was
not to be for them an intercessor, nor a deprecator of evils, nor a
solicitor of favors. All the versions render the passage loosely. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[201](cc17016.htm#fr_200.md) <span
id="xvii.xii-p12.4"></span>

<span id="xvii.xii-p13"></span> The ancient versions (the *Arabic*
excepted) and the *Targum* render the word, cakes — <span
id="xvii.xii-p13.1"></span>*placentas* It is only found elsewhere in
<span id="xvii.xii-p13.2"></span>[Jer
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#019.md)<span
id="xvii.xii-p13.2"></span>. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[202](cc17016.htm#fr_201.md) <span
id="xvii.xii-p14.4"></span>

<span id="xvii.xii-p15"></span> The *Septuagint* render the words here,
“the host of heaven,“ and in <span id="xvii.xii-p15.1"></span>[Jer
44:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#017.md)<span id="xvii.xii-p15.1"></span>
and 19, “the queen of heaven.” The *Vulgate* in the three places,
renders them “the queen of heaven,“— the *Targum, “*the star of heaven,“
— and the *Syriac*, “the army of heaven,“ in the two first places, but
in the last, “the queen of heaven.” There are several MSS., in the three
places, which insert the <span id="xvii.xii-p15.2"></span>א, so as to
make the word “work,“ or workmanship: but this change has evidently
arisen from the *Septuagint.* But this word is never used to designate
the work of the visible heavens: the word used in that case is <span
id="xvii.xii-p15.3"></span>מעשה. See <span
id="xvii.xii-p15.4"></span>[Ps. 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003.md),
[Ps. 19:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#001.md), [Ps.
102:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#025.md), [Ps.
143:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#005.md)<span
id="xvii.xii-p15.4"></span>. Our version and the *Vulgate* are no doubt
right. But what is intended by the queen of heaven is not the moon; for
the word commonly used for the moon is always masculine, and the word
generally used for the sun is commonly feminine. This may appear
strange; but so it is. In South Wales the word for sun is always
feminine, but in North Wales, masculine.

<span id="xvii.xii-p16"></span>In <span id="xvii.xii-p16.1"></span>[De
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#019.md)<span id="xvii.xii-p16.1"></span>,
the sun, the moon, and the stars, as constituting the host of heaven,
are mentioned together: these the first, as including all the rest,
seems to be intended. Instead of “queen,“ we should say in our language,
“the king of the heavens.” We do not read that the Jews worshipped the
moon; but the worship of the sun among them is specifically referred to
and mentioned. See <span id="xvii.xii-p16.2"></span>[2Ki
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#011.md)<span
id="xvii.xii-p16.2"></span>; <span id="xvii.xii-p16.3"></span>[Eze
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016.md)<span id="xvii.xii-p16.3"></span>.
The Israelites adored the sun under the name of Baal, which was the
Chemosh of the Moabites, and the Moloch of the Ammonites. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[203](cc17016.htm#fr_202.md) <span
id="xvii.xii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xii-p20"></span> The verb rendered “provoke,“ means to
disturb, to disquiet, to cause an annoyance, to irritate, —

<span id="xvii.xii-p21"></span>Is it I they are annoying, saith Jehovah?
Is it not themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?

<span id="xvii.xii-p22"></span>They were not disturbing, as it were, the
repose of God, but their own. They could do no hurt or annoyance to God,
but they were annoying and injuring themselves; and this would turn out
to their own shame and confusion. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[204](cc17016.htm#fr_203.md) <span
id="xvii.xvi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xvi-p13"></span> The meaning is not so plain as it might
have been made: the burnt-offerings were all consumed by fire; but a
part of the peace-offerings and of other offerings was eaten. See <span
id="xvii.xvi-p13.1"></span>[Le
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#009.md)<span id="xvii.xvi-p13.1"></span>;
and <span id="xvii.xvi-p13.2"></span>[Le
7:11-16](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#011.md)<span
id="xvii.xvi-p13.2"></span>. Then God says, by way of contempt, “Add
your burnt-offerings to your other offerings, and thus you will have
your appetites gratified.” Some derive the verb rendered “Add,“ from
<span id="xvii.xvi-p13.3"></span>ספה, which means to sweep together; and
“collect together — <span id="xvii.xvi-p13.4"></span>συναγάγετε,” is the
*Septuagint; “*heap together” is the *Syriac.* This comports better with
the contemptuous strain of the passage, —

<span id="xvii.xvi-p14"></span>Your burnt-offerings sweep together To
your sacrifices, and eat flesh.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p15"></span>— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[205](cc17016.htm#fr_204.md) <span
id="xvii.xvi-p22.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.xvi-p23"></span> This exposition is ingenious and
plausible, and all that is said is perfectly true: but it may be doubted
whether it be the way to account for the mode of speaking here adopted.
It is usual in Scripture, when two things are mentioned, and the one is
of little or no importance in comparison with the other, to state the
first negatively.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p24"></span>“Labor *not*, “says our Savior, “for the
meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting
life.” <span id="xvii.xvi-p24.1"></span>[Joh
6:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027.md)<span id="xvii.xvi-p24.1"></span>.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p25"></span>But it may be, that the reference here is
specifically to the *day* in which the Israelites were delivered; for on
that day, or at that particular time, (for the word *day* is not to be
taken in its strict meaning,) obedience to his voice was the only thing
which God required. See <span id="xvii.xvi-p25.1"></span>[Ex
15:26](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#026.md)<span
id="xvii.xvi-p25.1"></span>.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p26"></span>*Venema* thinks that reference is here
made, not to the institution of sacrifices, but to the ground of the
covenant. Sacrifices were not the condition of the covenant, but
obedience. God did not say, “If you sacrifice to me, I will be your
God;” but, “If you obey my voice, I will be your God, and you shall be
my people.” When the law was delivered on Mount Sinai, there was no
mention of sacrifices. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[206](cc17016.htm#fr_205.md) <span
id="xvii.xvi-p37.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xvi-p38"></span> The words are literally, —

<span id="xvii.xvi-p39"></span>And they walked in the counsels, —  
In the resolutions of their evil heart.

<span id="xvii.xvi-p40"></span>They not only *devised* their own ways,
but *resolved* to walk in them. They formed their own counsels, and made
resolutions to follow them, and they were the counsels and resolutions
of a disordered and perverted heart. In rendering the last word
“wickedness,“ *Calvin* has followed the *Vulgate;* and our version,
“imagination,“ is the *Targum.* It is omitted in the *Septuagint,* and
“desires” in *Syriac.* See note on <span
id="xvii.xvi-p40.2"></span>[Jeremiah
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#017.md)<span id="xvii.xvi-p40.2"></span>.
— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[207](cc17016.htm#fr_206.md) <span
id="xvii.xvi-p43.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xvi-p44"></span> The words are, —

<span id="xvii.xvi-p45"></span>And they were for behind, and not for
before them;

<span id="xvii.xvi-p46"></span>which seem to mean, that they were bent
on turning back to their own ways rather than to go on in the ways of
God. The version of the *Septuagint* is, “They were for things behind,
and not for things before;” the *Syriac* and *Arabic, “*They retrograded
and did not advance, “or go forward. The allusion seems not to be, as
*Blayney* thinks, to refractory oxen under the yoke; but to those
travelers who, when shewn the right way, go back instead of going
forward. And this was especially true of the Israelites, who, after
having left Egypt, wished often to return, instead of going forward to
Canaan. Hence it is said, that they were going back to their old ways,
and not going forward in the way which God bad pointed out to them. The
phrase in <span id="xvii.xvi-p46.1"></span>[Jer
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#027.md)<span id="xvii.xvi-p46.1"></span>,
is of another kind, and ought not to be confounded with this. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[208](cc17016.htm#fr_207.md) <span
id="xvii.xix-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xix-p12"></span> The former part of this verse would
better connect with the former verse, than with this sentence. There is
the copulative <span id="xvii.xix-p12.1"></span>ו, “and,” before the
verb “sent.” The sending of the prophets is mentioned in addition to the
first command given to them. The passage may be thus rendered, —

<span id="xvii.xix-p13"></span>And they went backward and not forward,

<span id="xvii.xix-p14"></span>**25.** From the day in which your
fathers came forth From the land of Egypt, to this day: And I sent to
you all my servants the prophets, Every day rising early and sending;

<span id="xvii.xix-p15"></span>**26.** Yet they hearkened not to me, Nor
inclined their ear, But hardened their neck; They have been more wicked
than their fathers.

<span id="xvii.xix-p16"></span>Such is the connection in all the ancient
versions and in the *Targum.* The verb, rendered “they have been more
wicked,“ or “done worse,“ is omitted by the *Septuagint* and the
*Syriac;* but retained by the *Vulgate* and the *Targum,* and is found
wanting in no MS. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[209](cc17016.htm#fr_208.md) <span
id="xvii.xxi-p7.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p8"></span> Our version is wrong, “obeyeth not;” for
the charge against them is, that they did not *attend* or give ear to
God’s voice: they would not hear it any more than the Papists at this
day. This is evident from the previous verse. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[210](cc17016.htm#fr_209.md) <span
id="xvii.xxi-p10.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxi-p11"></span> All the ancient versions and the
*Targum* render <span id="xvii.xxi-p11.1"></span> אמוגהby <span
id="xvii.xxi-p11.2"></span>πίστις, <span
id="xvii.xxi-p11.3"></span>fides — faith, fidelity or faithfulness. The
first verb, “perished” or lost, is omitted by the *Septuagint* and
*Arabic,* but is retained by the *Vulgate, Syriac,* and the *Targum.*
The second verb is stronger than the first; faithfulness was lost from
the mouth, yea, it was completely separated from it.

<span id="xvii.xxi-p12"></span>Lost is faithfulness, yea, wholly
separated from the mouth.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[211](cc17016.htm#fr_210.md) <span
id="xvii.xxii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxii-p7"></span> The emendations of *Houbigant,* adopted
by *Blayney,* are by no means to be approved; for without the authority
of any MSS. or versions, he changes the gender of these verbs in
succession. It is a common thing in the prophets to call the people the
daughter of Sion: and probably they are here so addressed, because the
hair is an ornament to a female, and to cut it off is a token of deep
distress. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[212](cc17016.htm#fr_211.md) <span
id="xvii.xxiii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxiii-p9"></span> The word means what is unclean and
filthy, “their filthy things.” They were the idols which were introduced
into the Temple. They did this evil “before his eyes,“ or in his
presence, as the Temple was his habitation. They brought idols as it
were into his very presence, and thereby literally violated the first
commandment, which expressly forbad them to have other gods before him
or in his presence. By what means did they evade this explicit command?
In the same way as the Church of Rome justifies idolatry, — that idols
are helps to devotion: but God regards them as abominations. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[213](cc17016.htm#fr_212.md) <span
id="xvii.xxvii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxvii-p8"></span> This is the meaning according to all
the ancient versions and the *Targum*. The *Syriac* is, “for want of
place.” *Gataker* gives the same meaning. Our version follows
*Pagninus,* and is substantially adopted by *Blayney* both here and in
<span id="xvii.xxvii-p8.2"></span>[Jer
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011.md)<span
id="xvii.xxvii-p8.2"></span>. Literally it is, “From no place,“ that is,
“From there being no place,“ as *Calvin* says elsewhere. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[214](cc17016.htm#fr_213.md) <span
id="xvii.xxviii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p11"></span> The poetical singular is used
throughout the verse, —

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p12"></span>And the carcase of this people shall
be for meat  
To the bird of heaven and to the beast of the earth,  
And there will be no terrifier.

<span id="xvii.xxviii-p13"></span> — *Ed*.
