<span id="v.v-p2"></span>CHAPTER 5

<span id="v.v-p3"></span>**1** Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty
with which Christ hath made us free; and be not again entangled by the
yoke of bondage.

<span id="v.v-p4"></span>**2** Behold, I Paul protest to you, that, if
ye be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.

<span id="v.v-p5"></span>**3** For I testify again to every man who is
circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law.

<span id="v.v-p6"></span>**4** Whosoever of you are justified by the
law, ye have separated yourselves from Christ; ye are fallen from grace.

<span id="v.v-p7"></span>**5** For we, through the Spirit, by faith,
wait for the hope of righteousness.

<span id="v.v-p8"></span>**6** For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith working by love.

<span id="v.v-p9"></span>**7** Ye were running well. Who hindered you,
that ye should not obey the truth?

<span id="v.v-p10"></span>**8** This persuasion is not from him who
called you.

<span id="v.v-p11"></span>**9** A little leaven leaveneth the whole
lump.

<span id="v.v-p12"></span>**10** I am persuaded concerning you in the
Lord, that ye will think nothing else;  <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193) but he that troubleth you shall bear
the condemnation, whoever he be.

<span id="v.v-p14"></span>**11** And I,  <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194) brethren, if I still preach
circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? The offense of the
cross is abolished.

<span id="v.v-p16"></span>**12** Would that they were even cut off who
trouble you!

<span id="v.v-p17"></span>**13** For ye, brethren, have been called to
liberty; only make not the liberty an occasion to the flesh,  <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195) but by love serve one another.

<span id="v.v-p19"></span>**14** For the whole law is fulfilled in one
word, namely, this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

<span id="v.v-p20"></span>**15** But if ye bite and devour one another,
see that ye be not consumed by one another.

<span id="v.v-p21"></span>**16** Now I say: Walk in the Spirit, and ye
shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

<span id="v.v-p22"></span>**17** For the flesh lusteth against the
Spirit; and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one
another, so that ye cannot do those things which ye would wish.

<span id="v.v-p23"></span>**18** But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are
not under the law.

<span id="v.v-p24"></span>**19** Now the works of the flesh are
manifest, which are adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,

<span id="v.v-p25"></span>**20** Idolatry, witchcraft, enmities, strife,
emulations, wrath, quarrellings, seditions, heresies,

<span id="v.v-p26"></span>**21** Envyings, murders, drunkenness,
revellings, and such like; of which I foretell to you, as I also have
foretold, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of
God.

<span id="v.v-p27"></span>**22** But the fruit of the Spirit is love,
joy, peace, long-suffering,  <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196)
gentleness, kindness, fidelity,

<span id="v.v-p29"></span>**23** Meekness, temperance; against such
there is no law.

<span id="v.v-p30"></span>**24** And they who are Christ’s have
crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.

<span id="v.v-p31"></span>**25** If we live by the Spirit, let us also
walk by the Spirit.

<span id="v.v-p32"></span>**26** Let us not be desirous of vain-glory,
provoking one another, envying one another.
