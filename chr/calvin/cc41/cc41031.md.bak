<span id="vi.v-p2"></span>CHAPTER 5

<span id="vi.v-p3"></span>**1** Be ye therefore imitators of God, as
beloved children;

<span id="vi.v-p4"></span>**2** And walk in love, as Christ also hath
loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and sacrifice to
God, for a smell of delightful fragrance.

<span id="vi.v-p5"></span>**3** But fornication, and all uncleanness, or
covetousness, let them not even be named among you, as becometh saints.

<span id="vi.v-p6"></span>**4** Or filthiness, foolish talking, jesting;
which are not convenient; but rather grace.  <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md)

<span id="vi.v-p8"></span>**5** For this ye know, that no fornicator, or
unclean person, or covetous man, who is an idolater, shall obtain
inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

<span id="vi.v-p9"></span>**6** Let no man deceive you by vain words;
for on account of these things cometh the wrath of God on disobedient
*(or, unbelieving)* children,  <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md)

<span id="vi.v-p11"></span>**7** Be not ye therefore their companions.

<span id="vi.v-p12"></span>**8** Ye were once darkness; but now ye are
light in the Lord; walk as children of light;

<span id="vi.v-p13"></span>**9** (For the fruit of the light is in all
goodness, and righteousness, and truth;)

<span id="vi.v-p14"></span>**10** Proving what is acceptable to God.
 <span id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md)

<span id="vi.v-p16"></span>**11** And have no fellowship with the
unfruitful works of darkness; but rather reprove them.

<span id="vi.v-p17"></span>**12** For it is a shame even to speak of
those things which are done by them in secret.

<span id="vi.v-p18"></span>**13** But all things, when they are brought
forward, are made manifest by the light; for every thing that maketh
manifest is light.

<span id="vi.v-p19"></span>**14** Wherefore he saith: Awake, thou that
sleepest, and arise from the dead; and Christ shall give thee light.

<span id="vi.v-p20"></span>**15** See then how you walk carefully, not
as fools, but as wise;

<span id="vi.v-p21"></span>**16** Redeeming the time, because the days
are evil.

<span id="vi.v-p22"></span>**17** Wherefore be ye not imprudent, but
understanding what is the will of the Lord.

<span id="vi.v-p23"></span>**18** And be not drunk with wine, in which
is lasciviousness;

<span id="vi.v-p24"></span>**19** But be filled with the Spirit;
speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs,
singing and making melody in your heart, to the Lord;

<span id="vi.v-p25"></span>**20** Giving thanks always for all things,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father.

<span id="vi.v-p26"></span>**21** Submit yourselves to one another in
the fear of Christ *(or, of God).*

<span id="vi.v-p27"></span>**22** Let wives be subject to their own
husbands as to the Lord;

<span id="vi.v-p28"></span>**23** For the husband is the head of the
wife, as Christ also is the savior of the church; and he is the savior
of the body.

<span id="vi.v-p29"></span>**24** But, as the church is subject to
Christ, in like manner (let) wives (be subject) to their own husbands in
all things.

<span id="vi.v-p30"></span>**25** Husbands, love your wives; as Christ
also loved the church, and gave himself for it,

<span id="vi.v-p31"></span>**26** That he might sanctify it, cleansing
it with the washing of water by the word;

<span id="vi.v-p32"></span>**27** That he might present it to himself a
glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but
that it might be holy and unblamable.

<span id="vi.v-p33"></span>**28** So ought husbands to love their wives,
as their own bodies. He who loveth his wife loveth himself.

<span id="vi.v-p34"></span>**29** For no man ever hated his own flesh,
but nourisheth and cherisheth it; as also Christ  <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) the church;

<span id="vi.v-p36"></span>**30** For we are members of his body, of his
flesh, and of his bones.

<span id="vi.v-p37"></span>**31** For this reason shall a man leave his
father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall be
one flesh.

<span id="vi.v-p38"></span>**32** This is a great secret; but I speak
concerning Christ and the church.

<span id="vi.v-p39"></span>**33** Yet let every one of you love his
wife; and let the woman reverence her husband.
