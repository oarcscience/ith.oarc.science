<span id="iv.i-p1"></span>THE ARGUMENT

<span id="iv.i-p2"></span>Ephesus, which is familiarly known in history
under a great variety of names,  <span id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md)
was a very celebrated city of Lesser Asia. The remarkable events
connected with the work of God in “forming there a people for himself,”
(<span id="iv.i-p3.1"></span>[Isa
43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021)<span id="iv.i-p3.1"></span>,.md)
through the labors of Paul, together with the commencement and progress
of that church, are related by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles. At
present, I shall do nothing more than glance at what bears directly on
the argument of the Epistle. The Ephesians had been instructed by Paul
in the pure doctrine of the gospel. At a later period, while he was a
prisoner at Rome, and perceiving that they needed confirmation, he wrote
to them, on that account, the present Epistle.

<span id="iv.i-p4"></span>The first three chapters are chiefly occupied
with commending the grace of God. Immediately after the salutation in
the commencement of the first chapter, he treats of God’s free election.
This affords him an opportunity of stating that they were now called
into the kingdom of God, because they had been appointed to life before
they were born. And here occurs a striking display of God’s wonderful
mercy, when the salvation of men is traced to its true and native
source, the free act of adoption. But as the minds of men are ill fitted
to receive so sublime a mystery, he betakes himself to prayer, that God
would enlighten the Ephesians in the full knowledge of Christ.

<span id="iv.i-p5"></span>In the second chapter, by drawing two
comparisons, he places in a strong light the riches of divine grace.
**1.** He reminds them how wretched they were before they were called to
Christ. We never become duly sensible of our obligations to Christ, nor
estimate aright his kindness towards us, till we have been led to view,
on the other side, the unhappy condition in which we formerly were
“without Christ.” (<span id="iv.i-p5.1"></span>[Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012)<span id="iv.i-p5.1"></span>..md)
**2.** The Gentiles were “aliens” from the promises of eternal life,
which God had been pleased to bestow on the Jews alone.

<span id="iv.i-p6"></span>In the third chapter, he declares that he had
been appointed to be, in a peculiar manner, the Apostle of the Gentiles,
because, for a long period, they were “strangers and foreigners,” (<span
id="iv.i-p6.1"></span>[Eph 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.i-p6.1"></span>,) but are now included among the people of God.
As this was an unusual event, and as its very novelty produced
uneasiness in many minds, he calls it a

<span id="iv.i-p7"></span>“mystery which in other ages was not made
known  
to the sons of men,” (<span id="iv.i-p7.2"></span>[Eph.
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#005)<span id="iv.i-p7.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="iv.i-p8"></span>but “the dispensation” (<span
id="iv.i-p8.1"></span>[Eph 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.i-p8.1"></span>) of which had been intrusted to himself.

<span id="iv.i-p9"></span>Towards the close of the chapter, he again
prays that God would grant to the Ephesians such an intimate knowledge
of Christ, that they would have no desire to know anything else. His
object in doing so is not merely to lead them to gratitude to God for so
many favors, and to the expression of that gratitude by entire devotion
to his service, but still more to remove all doubt about his own
calling. Paul was probably afraid that the false apostles would shake
their faith by insinuating that they had been only half-instructed. They
had been Gentiles, and, when they embraced pure Christianity, had been
told nothing about ceremonies or circumcision. But all who enjoined on
Christians the observance of the law were loud in the avowal, that those
who have not been introduced into the church of God by circumcision must
be held as profane persons. This was their ordinary song, that no man
who is not circumcised is entitled to be reckoned among the people of
God, and that all the rites prescribed by Moses ought to be observed.
Accordingly, they brought it as a charge against Paul, that he exhibited
Christ as equally the Savior of Gentiles and of Jews. They asserted that
his apostleship was a profanation of the heavenly doctrine, because it
threw open to wicked men, without discrimination, a share in the
covenant of grace.

<span id="iv.i-p10"></span>That the Ephesians, when assailed by these
calumnies, might not give way, he resolved to meet them. While he argues
so earnestly that they were called to the gospel because they had been
chosen before the creation of the world, he charges them, on the other
hand, not to imagine that the gospel had been accidentally brought to
them by the will of men, or that it flew to them by chance;  <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) for the preaching of Christ among them
was nothing else than the announcement of that eternal decree. While he
lays before them the unhappy condition of their former life, he at the
same time reminds them that the singular and astonishing mercy of God
appeared in rescuing them from so deep a gulf. While he sets before
their eyes his own commission as the apostle of the Gentiles, he
confirms them in the faith which they had once received, because they
had been divinely admitted into the communion of the church. And yet
each of the sentences to which we have now referred must be viewed as an
exhortation fitted to excite the Ephesians to gratitude.

<span id="iv.i-p12"></span>In the fourth chapter, he describes the
manner in which the Lord governs and protects his church, which is, by
the gospel preached by men. Hence it follows, that in no other way can
its integrity be preserved, and that the object at which it aims is true
perfection. The apostle’s design is, to commend to the Ephesians the
ministry by which God reigns amongst us. He afterwards details the
fruits of this preaching, — a holy life and all the duties of piety. Nor
does he satisfy himself with describing in general terms how Christians
ought to live, but lays down particular exhortations adapted to the
various relations of society.
