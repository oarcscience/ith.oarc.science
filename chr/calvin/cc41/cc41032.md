<span id="vi.vi-p2"></span>CHAPTER 6

<span id="vi.vi-p3"></span>**1** Children, obey your parents in the
Lord; for this is right.

<span id="vi.vi-p4"></span>**2** Honour thy father and mother; (which is
the first commandment with promise;)

<span id="vi.vi-p5"></span>**3** That it may be well with thee, and that
thou mayest be long-lived on the earth.

<span id="vi.vi-p6"></span>**4** Ye fathers also, provoke not your
children to wrath; but bring them up in the instruction and reproof of
the Lord.

<span id="vi.vi-p7"></span>**5** Servants, obey your masters  <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) according to the flesh, with fear and
trembling, in the simplicity of your hearts, as to Christ;

<span id="vi.vi-p9"></span>**6** Not with eye-service, as endeavoring to
please men, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from
the heart:  <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md)

<span id="vi.vi-p11"></span>**7** With good-will, serving the Lord, and
not men;

<span id="vi.vi-p12"></span>**8** Knowing that everyone, whether he be
bond or free, shall receive from the Lord whatever good he shall have
done.

<span id="vi.vi-p13"></span>**9** And ye, masters, perform your mutual
duty toward them, forbearing threatenings; knowing that their Master and
yours is in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with him.

<span id="vi.vi-p14"></span>**10** Finally, my brethren, be strong in
the Lord, and in the power of his might.

<span id="vi.vi-p15"></span>**11** Put on the whole armor of God, that
ye may be able to stand against the crafty devices of the devil.

<span id="vi.vi-p16"></span>**12** For we wrestle not against flesh and
blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the princes
of the world, of the darkness of this age, against spiritual
wickednesses in heavenly places.

<span id="vi.vi-p17"></span>**13** Wherefore take to you the whole armor
of God, that ye may be able to resist in the evil day, and, having
accomplished everything: to stand.

<span id="vi.vi-p18"></span>**14** Stand therefore, having your loins
girt with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,

<span id="vi.vi-p19"></span>**15** And having your feet shod with the
preparation of the gospel of peace;

<span id="vi.vi-p20"></span>**16** Above all, taking the shield of
faith, by which ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the
wicked one.

<span id="vi.vi-p21"></span>**17** And take the helmet of salvation, and
the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;

<span id="vi.vi-p22"></span>**18** Praying at all times in the Spirit,
with all prayer and supplication, and watching for this very purpose,
with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;

<span id="vi.vi-p23"></span>**19** And for me, that speech may be given
to me, in the opening of my mouth with boldness, that I may make known
the mystery of the gospel;  <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md)

<span id="vi.vi-p26"></span>**20** For which I discharge the office of
ambassador, in the chain; that I may conduct myself in it courageously,
as I ought to speak.

<span id="vi.vi-p27"></span>**21** But that ye also may know my affairs,
what I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the
Lord, will make known to you all things;

<span id="vi.vi-p28"></span>**22** Whom I have sent to you for that
purpose, that ye might know my affairs, and might comfort your hearts.

<span id="vi.vi-p29"></span>**23** Peace (be) to the brethren, and love,
with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="vi.vi-p30"></span>**24** Grace (be) with all who love our Lord
Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
