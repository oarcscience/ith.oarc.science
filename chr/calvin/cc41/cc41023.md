<span id="v.iv-p1"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="v.iv-p3"></span>**1** Now I say: As long as the heir is a
child, he differeth nothing from a slave,  <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) though he is lord of all;

<span id="v.iv-p5"></span>**2** But is under tutors and guardians, till
the time appointed by the father.

<span id="v.iv-p6"></span>**3** So also we, when we were children, were
in bondage under the elements of the world.

<span id="v.iv-p7"></span>**4** But when the fullness of the time was
come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, subjected under the law;

<span id="v.iv-p8"></span>**5** That he might redeem those who were
under the law, that we might receive adoption.  <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md)

<span id="v.iv-p10"></span>**6** And because ye are sons, God hath sent
forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

<span id="v.iv-p11"></span>**7** Wherefore thou art no longer a slave
 <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) but a son; and if a son,
likewise an heir of God by Christ.

<span id="v.iv-p13"></span>**8** But at the time when ye knew not God,
ye served those who by nature are not gods.

<span id="v.iv-p14"></span>**9** But now, after that ye have known God,
or rather have been known by God, why do ye turn again to the weak and
beggarly elements, which you again desire to serve, anew?  <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md)

<span id="v.iv-p16"></span>**10** Ye observe days, and months, and
times, and years.

<span id="v.iv-p17"></span>**11** I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I
have labored among you in vain.

<span id="v.iv-p18"></span>**12** Be ye as I; for I also am as you.
Brethren, I beseech you; ye have done me no injury.

<span id="v.iv-p19"></span>**13** Now ye knew that, through infirmity of
the flesh, I formerly preached the gospel to you;

<span id="v.iv-p20"></span>**14** And the trial of me, which was in my
flesh, ye despised not, nor rejected;  <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) but ye received me as an angel of God,
as Christ Jesus.

<span id="v.iv-p22"></span>**15** Where is then your blessedness? for I
bear you witness, that, if it had been possible, ye would even have
plucked out your own eyes, and would have given them to me.

<span id="v.iv-p23"></span>**16** Am I therefore become your enemy by
speaking the truth?

<span id="v.iv-p24"></span>**17** They are jealous of you, not well;
 <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) yea, they wish to exclude you,
that ye may be jealous of them.

<span id="v.iv-p26"></span>**18** But it is good to be the object of
jealousy always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with
you.

<span id="v.iv-p27"></span>**19** My little children, for whom I again
travail in birth; till Christ be formed in you,

<span id="v.iv-p28"></span>**20** I would wish now to be present with
you, and to change my voice; for I am distressed about you.

<span id="v.iv-p29"></span>**21** Tell me, ye who wish to be under the
law, do ye not hear the law?

<span id="v.iv-p30"></span>**22** For it is written, that Abraham had
two sons; one by the bond-maid, the other by the free-woman.

<span id="v.iv-p31"></span>**23** But he who (was) of the bond-maid was
born according to the flesh; but he who, (was) of the free-woman, by
promise.

<span id="v.iv-p32"></span>**24** Which things are allegorical  <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) for there are two covenants; one
indeed from mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, that is Agar.

<span id="v.iv-p34"></span>**25** For Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia,
and, on the other hand, corresponds to that which is now Jerusalem; for
she is in bondage with her children.

<span id="v.iv-p35"></span>**26** But Jerusalem, which is above, is
free, which is the mother of us all.

<span id="v.iv-p36"></span>**27** For it is written: Rejoice, O barren,
who bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for more
are the children of the forsaken than of her who hath a husband. (<span
id="v.iv-p36.1"></span>[Isa 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.iv-p36.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.iv-p37"></span>**28** Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are
children of the promise. (<span id="v.iv-p37.1"></span>[Ro
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007)<span id="v.iv-p37.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iv-p38"></span>**29** But as, at that time, he who was born
according to the flesh, persecuted him who was born according to the
Spirit; so also is it now.

<span id="v.iv-p39"></span>**30** But what saith the scripture? Cast out
the bond-maid, and her son; for the son of the bond-maid shall not
obtain the inheritance with the so, of the free-woman.

<span id="v.iv-p40"></span>**31** Wherefore, brethren, we are not
children of the bond-woman, but of the free.
