<span id="vi.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="vi.ii-p3"></span>**1** And when ye were dead in your
trespasses and sins;

<span id="vi.ii-p4"></span>**2** In which for some time ye walked,
according to the course  <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) of this
world, according to the prince of the power of air, that is, of the
spirit that now worketh  <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) in the
children of disobedience;

<span id="vi.ii-p7"></span>**3** Among whom we all also, for some time,
had our conversation in the lusts of our flesh, executing what was
agreeable to the flesh and to the mind;  <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) and were by nature children of wrath,
even as others.

<span id="vi.ii-p9"></span>**4** But God, who is rich in mercy, on
account of his great love, with which he loved us,

<span id="vi.ii-p10"></span>**5** Even when we were dead in sins,
quickened (us) together with Christ; (by grace ye are saved;)

<span id="vi.ii-p11"></span>**6** And hath raised us up together, and
hath made us sit together in heavenly (places) in Christ Jesus;

<span id="vi.ii-p12"></span>**7** That he might shew, in the ages to
come, the surpassing riches of his grace, in (his) kindness  <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) toward us in Christ Jesus.

<span id="vi.ii-p14"></span>**8** For by grace are ye saved through
faith; and that not of yourselves; (it is) the gift of God.

<span id="vi.ii-p15"></span>**9** Not of works, that no one may boast.

<span id="vi.ii-p16"></span>**10** For we are his workmanship, having
been created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God hath prepared,
that we may walk in them.

<span id="vi.ii-p17"></span>**11** Wherefore remember that you, at one
time Gentiles in the flesh, who were called Uncircumcision by that which
is called Circumcision, made by the hand in the flesh,

<span id="vi.ii-p18"></span>**12** At that time were without Christ,
having been alienated from the commonwealth of Israel  <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) strangers from the tables of promise,
 <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) not having hope,  <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) and without God in the world;

<span id="vi.ii-p22"></span>**13** But now in Christ Jesus  <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) you, who formerly were far off, have
been made nigh through the blood of Christ.

<span id="vi.ii-p24"></span>**14** For he is our peace, who hath made
both one,  <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) and breaking down the
middle wall of partition, the enmities in our flesh;

<span id="vi.ii-p26"></span>**15** Abolishing in his flesh the law of
commandments (which is) contained in ordinances, that he might unite in
himself the two into one new man, making peace;

<span id="vi.ii-p27"></span>**16** That he might reconcile both to God
in one body through the cross, slaying  <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) the enmities by it;

<span id="vi.ii-p29"></span>**17** And coming, preached peace to you who
were far off, and peace to those who were nigh;

<span id="vi.ii-p30"></span>**18** For through him we both have access
in one Spirit to the Father.

<span id="vi.ii-p31"></span>**19** Therefore ye are no longer strangers
and foreigners, but fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household
of God,

<span id="vi.ii-p32"></span>**20** Having been built on the foundation
of the apostles and prophets, of which Jesus Christ himself is the chief
corner-stone;

<span id="vi.ii-p33"></span>**21** In whom the whole building joined
together groweth into a holy temple in the Lord;

<span id="vi.ii-p34"></span>**22** In whom ye also are built together
 <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) for a habitation of God in the
Spirit.
