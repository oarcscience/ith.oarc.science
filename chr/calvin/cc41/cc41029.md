<span id="vi.iii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="vi.iii-p3"></span>**1** For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of
Jesus Christ, discharge the office of ambassador for you Gentiles;

<span id="vi.iii-p4"></span>**2** If ye have heard of dispensation of
the grace of God, (which was) given me towards you;

<span id="vi.iii-p5"></span>**3** That through revelation he made known
to me the secret, as I wrote a little before;

<span id="vi.iii-p6"></span>**4** By attending to which ye may
understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,

<span id="vi.iii-p7"></span>**5** Which in other ages was not made known
to the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed to his holy apostles
and prophets through the Spirit,

<span id="vi.iii-p8"></span>**6** That the Gentiles are fellow-heirs,
and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ through the
gospel.

<span id="vi.iii-p9"></span>**7** Of which I was made a minister,
according to the gift of the grace of God, which was given to me
according to the efficacy of his power.

<span id="vi.iii-p10"></span>**8** To me, the least of all saints, was
this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the
unsearchable riches of Christ;

<span id="vi.iii-p11"></span>**9** And that I should make manifest to
all, what is the fellowship of the mystery, which hath been hid from
ages in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ;

<span id="vi.iii-p12"></span>**10** That the manifold wisdom of God
might now be manifested to principalities and powers in heavenly places
through the church,

<span id="vi.iii-p13"></span>**11** According to the eternal purpose
which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord,

<span id="vi.iii-p14"></span>**12** Through whom we have boldness, and
access with confidence, through the faith of him.

<span id="vi.iii-p15"></span>**13** Wherefore I desire that ye faint not
at my afflictions for you, which is your glory.

<span id="vi.iii-p16"></span>**14** For this cause I bend my knees to
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

<span id="vi.iii-p17"></span>**15** Of whom the whole family in heaven
and on earth is named,

<span id="vi.iii-p18"></span>**16** That he would give to you, according
to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might through his
Spirit in the inner man,

<span id="vi.iii-p19"></span>**17** That Christ may dwell in your hearts
through faith, that ye may be rooted and grounded in love,  <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217)

<span id="vi.iii-p21"></span>**18** That ye may be able to comprehend
with all saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;

<span id="vi.iii-p22"></span>**19** To know, I say, the love of Christ,
which surpasseth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fullness
of God.

<span id="vi.iii-p23"></span>**20** Now to him who is able to do
abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power
working in you,

<span id="vi.iii-p24"></span>**21** Be glory in the church through Jesus
Christ, in all ages, for ever and ever. Amen.
