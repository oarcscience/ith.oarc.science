<span id="vi.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="vi.i-p3"></span>**1** Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
will of God, to all the saints who are at Ephesus, and to the believers
in Christ Jesus;

<span id="vi.i-p4"></span>**2** Grace (be) to you, and peace, from God
our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="vi.i-p5"></span>**3** Blessed  <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201) (be.md) the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in
heavenly  <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202) (places.md) in Christ;

<span id="vi.i-p8"></span>**4** As he hath chosen us in him before the
creation of the world, that we might be holy and blameless in his sight
through love:

<span id="vi.i-p9"></span>**5** Who hath predestinated us in adoption in
himself through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his
will,

<span id="vi.i-p10"></span>**6** To the praise of the glory of his
grace, by which he hath made us accepted in the Beloved.

<span id="vi.i-p11"></span>**7** In whom we have redemption through his
blood, the forgiveness of sins,

<span id="vi.i-p12"></span>**8** According to the riches of his grace;
in which he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;

<span id="vi.i-p13"></span>**9** Having made known to us the secret of
his will, according to his good pleasure, which he had purposed in
himself;

<span id="vi.i-p14"></span>**10** In order to the dispensation of the
fullness of the times;  <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) that he
might gather together all things in Christ, both those things which are
in heaven, and those things which are on the earth, in him;

<span id="vi.i-p16"></span>**11** Through whom also we have obtained an
inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who
worketh all things according to the purpose of his will;

<span id="vi.i-p17"></span>**12** That we, who first hoped in Christ,
might be to the praise of his glory.

<span id="vi.i-p18"></span>**13** In whom ye also (trusted,) having
heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also,
after having believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,

<span id="vi.i-p19"></span>**14** Who is the earnest of our inheritance,
till the redemption of the possession obtained, to the praise of his
glory.

<span id="vi.i-p20"></span>**15** Wherefore I also, having heard of the
faith which ye have in the Lord Jesus, and of the love (which ye have)
toward all the saints,

<span id="vi.i-p21"></span>**16** Cease not to give thanks for you,
making mention of you in my prayers;

<span id="vi.i-p22"></span>**17** That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and
revelation, by the knowledge of him,  <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md)

<span id="vi.i-p24"></span>**18** The eyes of your mind enlightened,
that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the
riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,

<span id="vi.i-p25"></span>**19** And what is the surpassing greatness
of his power toward us who believe, according to the efficacy of the
power of his strength;

<span id="vi.i-p26"></span>**20** Which he wrought in Christ, when he
raised him from the dead, and caused him to sit at his own right hand in
the heavenly (places);

<span id="vi.i-p27"></span>**21** Above all principality, and power, and
might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age,
but also in (the age) which is to come;

<span id="vi.i-p28"></span>**22** And hath put all things under his
feet, and hath appointed him head over all things to the church  <span
id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md)

<span id="vi.i-p30"></span>**23** Which is his body, and the fulness of
him that filleth all in all.
