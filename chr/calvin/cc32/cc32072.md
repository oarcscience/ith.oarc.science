<span id="ii.lxxi-p5"></span> **23**. And Jesus said to his disciples,
Verily I say to you, A rich man will with difficulty enter into the
kingdom of heaven. **24**. Again I say to you, It is easier for a camel
 <span id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629) to pass through the eye of a
needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
**25**. And his disciples, when they had heard these things, were
greatly amazed,  <span id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630) saying, Who
then can be saved? **26**. And Jesus, beholding them, said to them, With
men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.

<span id="ii.lxxi-p8"></span> 

<span id="ii.lxxi-p9"></span> **23**. And when Jesus had looked around,
he said to his disciples, With what difficulty shall they who have
riches enter into the kingdom of God! **24**. And the disciples were
astonished at his words. But Jesus again replying, said to them,
Children, how difficult is it for those who have confidence in riches to
enter into the kingdom of God! **25**. It is easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of God. **26**. And they wondered beyond measure, saying within
themselves, And who can be saved? **27**. And Jesus beholding them
saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are
possible with God.

<span id="ii.lxxi-p10"></span> **24**. And Jesus, perceiving that he was
sorrowful, said, With what difficulty shall they who have riches enter
into the kingdom of God! **25**. For it is easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the
kingdom of God. **26**. And they that heard it said, And who can be
saved?  <span id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631) **27**. But he said, The
things which are impossible with men are possible with God.

<span id="ii.lxxi-p15"></span>**<span id="ii.lxxi-p15.2"></span>[Matthew
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#023)<span
id="ii.lxxi-p15.2"></span>.** *A rich man will with difficulty enter.*
Christ warns them, not only how dangerous and how deadly a plague
avarice is, but also how great an obstacle is presented by riches. In
Mark, indeed, he mitigates the harshness of his expression, by
restricting it to those only *who place confidence in riches* But these
words are, I think, intended to confirm, rather than correct, the former
statement, as if he had affirmed that they ought not to think it
strange, that he made the *entrance into the kingdom of heaven so
difficult for the rich,* because it is an evil almost common to all to
*trust in their riches* Yet this doctrine is highly useful to all; to
*the rich*, that, being warned of their danger, they may be on their
guard; to the poor, that, satisfied with their lot, they may not so
eagerly desire what would bring more damage than gain. It is true
indeed, that *riches* do not, in their own nature, hinder us from
following God; but, in consequence of the depravity of the human mind,
it is scarcely possible for those who have a great abundance to avoid
being intoxicated by them. So they who are exceedingly *rich* are held
by Satan bound, as it were, in chains, that they may not raise their
thoughts to heaven; nay more, they bury and entangle themselves, and
became utter slaves to the earth. The comparison of the *camel*., which
is soon after added, is intended to amplify the *difficulty;* for it
means that *the rich* are so swelled with pride and presumption, that
they cannot endure to be reduced to the straits through which God makes
his people to pass. The word *camel* denotes, I think, a rope used by
sailors, rather than the animal so named.  <span
id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632)

<span id="ii.lxxi-p17"></span><span id="ii.lxxi-p17.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxxi-p18"></span>**25.** *And his disciples, when they
heard these things, were greatly amazed. The disciples are astonished,*
because it ought to awaken in us no little anxiety, that *riches*
obstruct the *entrance into the kingdom of God;* for, wherever we turn
our eyes, a thousand obstacles will present themselves. But let us
observe that, while they were struck with astonishment, they did not
shrink from the doctrines of Christ. The case was different with him who
was lately mentioned; for he was so much alarmed by the severity of the
commandment, that he separated from Christ; while they, though
trembling, and inquiring*, who can be saved?* do not break off in an
opposite direction, but are desirous to conquer despair. Thus it will be
of service to us to tremble at the threatenings of God: whenever he
denounces any thing that is gloomy or dreadful, provided that our minds
are not discouraged, but rather aroused.

<span id="ii.lxxi-p19"></span><span id="ii.lxxi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxxi-p20"></span>**26.** *With men this is impossible.*
Christ does not entirely free the minds of his disciples from all
anxiety; for it is proper that they should perceive how difficult it is
to ascend to heaven; first, that they may direct all their efforts to
this object; and next, that, distrusting themselves, they may implore
strength from heaven. We see how great is our indolence and
carelessness; and what the consequence would be if believers thought
that they had to walk at ease, for pastime, along a smooth and cheerful
plain. Such is the reason why Christ does not extenuate the danger —
though he perceives the terror which it excited in his disciples — but
rather increases it; for though formerly he said only that it was
*difficult*, he now affirms it to be *impossible* Hence it is evident,
that those teachers are guilty of gross impropriety, who are so much
afraid to speak harshly, that they give indulgence to the slothfulness
of the flesh. They ought to follow, on the contrary, the rule of Christ,
who so regulates his style that, after men have been bowed down within
themselves, he teaches them to rely on the grace of God alone, and, at
the same time, excites them to prayer. In this manner, the weakness of
men is seasonably relieved, not by ascribing anything to them, but by
arousing their minds to expect the grace of God. By this reply of Christ
is also refuted that widely embraced principle — which the Papists have
borrowed from Jerome — “Whoever shall say that it is impossible to keep
the law, let him be accursed. “For Christ plainly declares, that it is
not possible for men to keep the way of salvation, except so far as the
grace of God assists them.

id="ii.lxxi-p16.2"></span><span id="ii.lxxi-p16.3"></span>Vray est que
le mot CAMELUS, dont a use l’Evangeliste, significant un chameau qu’un
chable: mats i’aime mieux le prendre en la derniere signification pour
une grosse carde de nayire<span id="ii.lxxi-p16.4"></span>.” — “It is
true that the word <span id="ii.lxxi-p16.5"></span>κάμηλος<span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.6"></span> which the Evangelist has employed, means both
a *camel* <span id="ii.lxxi-p16.7"></span>and a *cable;* <span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.8"></span>but I prefer taking it in the latter
signification for *a large rope used by sailors*<span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.9"></span>.” <span id="ii.lxxi-p16.10"></span>The two
English words *camel* <span id="ii.lxxi-p16.11"></span>and *cable* <span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.12"></span>closely resemble each other, and the
corresponding Greek words differ only by a single vowel; <span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.13"></span>κάμηλος<span id="ii.lxxi-p16.14"></span>,
denoting a *camel*<span id="ii.lxxi-p16.15"></span>, <span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.16"></span>and <span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.17"></span>κάμιλος<span id="ii.lxxi-p16.18"></span> a
*cable* <span id="ii.lxxi-p16.19"></span>or *rope* <span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.20"></span>It does not appear that <span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.21"></span>Calvin<span id="ii.lxxi-p16.22"></span>;
relied on certain Manuscripts of no good authority, which substitute
<span id="ii.lxxi-p16.23"></span>καμίλον<span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.24"></span>, for <span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.25"></span>καμήλον<span id="ii.lxxi-p16.26"></span>. But
he adopted the notion equally unfounded, that Greek writers sometimes
used <span id="ii.lxxi-p16.27"></span>κάμηλος<span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.28"></span>, in the sense of <span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.29"></span>κάμιλος<span id="ii.lxxi-p16.30"></span>. Had
due allowance been made for the boldness of Eastern imagery, the
supposed difficulty would have disappeared, and the most refined taste
would have been fully gratified. The poet Southey has seized the true
spirit of the passage: — “S. The *camel* <span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.31"></span>and the *needle*<span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.32"></span>, <span id="ii.lxxi-p16.33"></span>Is that
then in your mind? “T. Even so. The text Is gospel wisdom. I would ride
the *camel*<span id="ii.lxxi-p16.34"></span>, — Yea leap him flying,
through the *needle’s eye*<span id="ii.lxxi-p16.35"></span>, <span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.36"></span>As easily as such a pampered soul Could pass
the narrow gate.” At one period, critics showed a strong leaning to the
idea of *cable*<span id="ii.lxxi-p16.37"></span>, <span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.38"></span>which our Author favors, but have now very
generally abandoned it, and returned to the true *reading*<span
id="ii.lxxi-p16.39"></span>. — *Ed*
