*And they departed, and preached.* Matthew silently passes over what the
Apostles did. Mark and Luke relate that they proceeded to execute the
commission which they had received; and from their statements it appears
more clearly, that the office which Christ at that time bestowed upon
them, as I have formerly mentioned, was temporary, and indeed lasted but
a few days. They tell us that the Apostles went through the cities and
villages: and they unquestionably returned in a short time to their
Master, as we shall find to be stated in another passage.

<span id="ii.i-p11"></span>The only matter that requires exposition here
is the fact related by Mark, that they *anointed with oil many diseased
persons* Christ having conferred on them the power of healing, it is
asked, why did they apply *oil?* Some learned persons suppose that it
was a sort of medicine; and I acknowledge that in these countries the
use of *oil* was very common. But nothing is more unreasonable than to
imagine, that the Apostles employed ordinary and natural remedies, which
would have the effect of obscuring the miracles of Christ. They were not
instructed by our Lord in the art and science of healing, but, on the
contrary, were enjoined to perform miracles which would arouse all
Judea. I think, therefore, that this *anointing* was a visible token of
spiritual grace, by which the healing that was administered by them was
declared to proceed from the secret power of God; for under the Law
*oil* was employed to represent the grace of the Spirit. The absurdity
of an attempt to imitate the Apostles, by making the *anointing* of the
sick a perpetual ordinance of the Church, appears from the fact, that
Christ bestowed on the Apostles the gift of healing, not as an
inheritance which they should hand down to posterity, but as a temporary
seal of the doctrine of the Gospel. In our own day, the ignorance of the
Papists is exceedingly ridiculous in maintaining that their nasty
*unction*,  <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) by which they hurry to the
grave persons who are fast dying, is a Sacrament.

*last anointing*,) which is one of the Seven Sacraments recognized by
the Church of Rome. — *Ed.*
