<span id="ii.xx-p3"></span> **24**. He put forth to them another
parable, saying, The kingdom of heaven is compared to a man sowing good
seed in his field. **25**. But while men were asleep, his enemy came,
and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away. **26**. And when the
blade sprang up, and yielded fruit, then appeared also the tares.
**27**. And the servants of the household approaching, said to him,
Lord, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? Whence then hath it
tares?  <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) **28**. And he said to
them, An enemy  <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) hath done this.
And his servants said to him, Is it thy will then that we go away and
gather them? **29**. But he said, No; lest, while you are gathering the
tares, you root out along with them the wheat also. **30**. Allow both
to grow together till the harvest; and at the time of harvest I will say
to the reapers, Gather first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn
them; but collect the wheat into my barn. — (A little after.)
**36**. Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and came into the house, and
his disciples approached him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the
tares of the field. **37**. But he answering, said to them, He that
soweth the good seed is the Son of man. **38**. And the field is the
world. The good seed is the children of the kingdom; but the tares are
the children of that wicked one. **39**. And the enemy that soweth them
is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are
the angels. **40**. So then as the tares are gathered, and are burned in
the fire, so shall it be at the end of this world. **41**. The Son of
man will send his angels, and will gather out of his kingdom all
stumbling-blocks, and those who commit iniquity. **42**. And they will
east them into a furnace of fire: there shall be lamentation and
gnashing of teeth. **43**. Then the righteous will shine as the sun in
the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

<span id="ii.xx-p6"></span> 

<span id="ii.xx-p7"></span><span id="ii.xx-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p8"></span>In order to reap the advantage of this
parable, it is necessary to ascertain the object which Christ had in
view. Some think that, to guard a mixed multitude against satisfying
themselves with an outward profession of the Gospel,  <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) he told them, that in his own field
bad seed is often mixed with the good, but that a day is coming, when
the tares shall be separated from the wheat.  <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) They accordingly connect this parable
with the one immediately preceding, as if the design of both had been
the same. For my own part, I take a different view. He speaks of a
separation, in order to prevent the minds of the godly from giving way
to uneasiness or despondency, when they perceive a confused mixture of
the good along with the bad. Although Christ has cleansed the Church
with his own blood, that it may be without spot or blemish, yet hitherto
he suffers it to be polluted by many stains. I speak not of the
remaining infirmities of the flesh, to which every believer is liable,
even after that he has been renewed by the Holy Spirit. But as soon as
Christ has gathered a small flock for himself, many hypocrites mingle
with it, persons of immoral lives creep in, nay, many wicked men
insinuate themselves; in consequence of which, numerous stains pollute
that holy assembly, which Christ has separated for himself. Many
persons, too, look upon it as exceedingly absurd, that ungodly, or
profane or unprincipled men should be cherished within the bosom of the
Church. Add to this, that very many, under the pretense of zeal, are
excessively displeased, when every thing is not conducted to their wish,
and, because absolute purity is nowhere to be found, withdraw from the
Church in a disorderly manner, or subvert and destroy it by unreasonable
severity.

<span id="ii.xx-p11"></span>In my opinion, the design of the parable is
simply this: So long as the pilgrimage of the Church in this world
continues, bad men and hypocrites will mingle in it with those who are
good and upright, that the children of God may be armed with patience
and, in the midst of offenses which are fitted to disturb them, may
preserve unbroken stedfastness of faith. It is an appropriate
comparison, when the Lord calls the Church *his field,* for believers
are the seed of it; and though Christ afterwards adds that *the field is
the world,* yet he undoubtedly intended to apply this designation, in a
peculiar manner, to the Church, about which he had commenced the
discourse. But as he was about to drive his plough through every country
of the world, so as to cultivate fields, and scatter the seed of life,
throughout the whole world, he has employed a *synecdoche, to* make *the
world* denote what more strictly belonged only to a part of it.

<span id="ii.xx-p12"></span>We must now inquire what he means by *the
wheat,* and what by *the tares* These terms cannot be explained as
referring to doctrine, as if the meaning had been that, when the Gospel
*is sown,* it is immediately corrupted and adulterated by wicked
inventions; for Christ would never have forbidden them to labor
strenuously to purge out that kind of corruption. With respect to
morals, those faults of men which cannot be corrected must be endured;
but we are not at liberty to extend such a toleration to wicked errors,
which corrupt the purity of faith.  <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) Besides, Christ removes all doubt, by
saying expressly, that *the tares are the children of the wicked one*
And yet it must also be remarked, that this cannot be understood simply
of the persons of men, as if by creation God sowed good men and the
devil sowed bad men. I advert to this, because the present passage has
been abused by the Manicheans, for the purpose of lending support to
their notion of two principles. But we know that whatever sin exists,
either in the devil or in men, is nothing else than the corruption of
the whole nature. As it is not by creation that God makes his elect, who
have been tainted with original sin, to become a good seed, but by
regenerating them through the grace of his Spirit; so wicked men are not
created by the devil, but, having been created by God, are corrupted by
the devil, and thrown into the Lord’s field, in order to corrupt the
pure seed.

<span id="ii.xx-p14"></span><span id="ii.xx-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p15"></span>**37.** *He that soweth the good seed* He
had formerly said that *the kingdom of heaven resembles a man sowing.*
The mode of expression is unusual, but plainly means, that the same
thing happens with the preaching of the Gospel as usually takes place in
the sowing of fields; *the tares grow, up along with the wheat* One
peculiarity, however, is pointed out by him, when he says that the
sowing of tares in the field was effected by the trick of *an enemy.*
This is intended to inform us that, when many wicked men are mingled
with believers, this is no accidental or natural occurrence, as if they
were the same seed, but that we must learn to charge the blame of this
evil on the devil. Not that, by condemning him, men are acquitted of
guilt; but, in the first place, that no blame whatever may be laid on
God on account of this fault which arose from the agency of another;
and, secondly, that we may not be surprised to find *tares* frequently
growing in the Lord’s field, since Satan is always on the watch to do
mischief. Again, when Christ says, not that the ministers of the word
sow, but that he alone sows, this is not without meaning; for though
this cannot be supposed to be restricted to his person, yet as he makes
use of our exertions, and employs us as his instruments, for cultivating
his field, so that He alone acts by us and in us, he justly claims for
himself what is, in some respects, common to his ministers. Let us,
therefore, remember, that the Gospel is preached, not only by Christ’s
command, but by his authority. and direction; in short, that we are only
his hand, and that He alone is the Author of the work.

<span id="ii.xx-p16"></span><span id="ii.xx-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p17"></span>**39.** *The harvest is the end of the
world.* This is, no doubt, a very distressing consideration, that the
Church is burdened with the reprobate to the very *end of the world;*
but Christ enjoins on us to exercise patience till that time, that we
may not deceive ourselves with a vain hope. Pastors ought to labor
strenuously to purify the Church; and all the godly, so far as their
respective callings enable them, ought to lend assistance in this
matter; but when all shall have devoted their united exertions to the
general advantage, they will not succeed in such a manner as to purify
the Church entirely from every defilement. Let us therefore hold, that
nothing was farther from the design of Christ than to encourage
pollution by lending countenance to it. All that he intended was, to
exhort those who believed in him not to lose courage, because they are
under the necessity of retaining wicked men among them; and, next, to
restrain and moderate the zeal of those who fancy that they are not at
liberty to join in a society with any but pure angels.  <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md)

<span id="ii.xx-p19"></span>This passage has been most improperly abused
by the Anabaptists, and by others like them,  <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) to take from the Church the power of
the sword. But it is easy to refute them; for since they approve of
excommunication, which cuts off, at least for a time, the bad and
reprobate, why may not godly magistrates, when necessity calls for it,
use the sword against wicked men? They reply that, when the punishment
is not capital,  <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) there is room
allowed for repentance; as if the thief on the cross (<span
id="ii.xx-p21.2"></span>[Lu 23:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#042.md)<span
id="ii.xx-p21.2"></span>) did not find the means of salvation. I shall
satisfy myself with replying, that Christ does not now speak of the
office of pastors or of magistrates, but removes the offense which is
apt to disturb weak minds, when they perceive that the Church is
composed not only of the elect, but of the polluted dregs of society.

<span id="ii.xx-p22"></span>*The reapers are the angels.* This term must
be viewed in reference to the present subject. In another passage, the
Apostles are called *reapers,* as compared with the Prophets, because
they have *entered into their labors,* (<span
id="ii.xx-p22.1"></span>[Joh 4:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#038.md)<span
id="ii.xx-p22.1"></span>,) and it is enjoined on all the ministers of
the word,

<span id="ii.xx-p23"></span>that they should bring forth fruit, and that
their fruit should remain,  
(<span id="ii.xx-p23.2"></span>[Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016)<span id="ii.xx-p23.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xx-p24"></span>Such also is the import of that statement,
that *the fields are white,* and are in want of reapers, (<span
id="ii.xx-p24.1"></span>[Joh 4:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#035.md)<span
id="ii.xx-p24.1"></span>;) and again, that

<span id="ii.xx-p25"></span>the harvest is abundant, but the laborers
are few,  
(<span id="ii.xx-p25.2"></span>[Mt
9:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#037)<span id="ii.xx-p25.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xx-p26"></span>But here the comparison is applied in a
different manner; for those who occupy a place in the Church are said to
be planted in the Lord’s field. Nor is this inconsistent with what is
said elsewhere, that Christ, as soon as he comes forth with his Gospel,

<span id="ii.xx-p27"></span>hath a winnowing-fan in his hand, and will
thoroughly  
cleanse his thrashing-floor, (<span id="ii.xx-p27.2"></span>[Mt
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012)<span id="ii.xx-p27.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xx-p28"></span>These words describe the commencement of
that cleansing, which, this passage declares, will not take place before
the last day, because not till then will it be fully completed. Christ
will put the last hand to the cleansing of the Church by means of
*angels,* but he now begins to do the work by means of pious teachers.
He assigns this office to *angels,* because they will not remain idle
spectators before his tribunal,  <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md)
but will hold themselves in readiness to execute his commands. It
follows, that those who proceed, with undue haste, to root out whatever
displeases them, prevent, as far as lies in their power, the sentence of
Christ, deprive *angels* of their office, and rashly take that office on
themselves.

<span id="ii.xx-p30"></span><span id="ii.xx-p30.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p31"></span>**41.** *They shall gather out of his
kingdom all stumbling-blocks* The words that follow, *and those who
commit iniquity,* are added for the sake of exposition; for it is not
intended to point out two different things, but to state, that then will
be the full and seasonable time, when all things shall be restored to
regular order, and when the *wicked* shall be removed, who are now
*stumbling-blocks.* They are so called, because not only are their own
lives wicked, but they undermine the faith of many, retard others in the
right course, draw some entirely aside, and drive others headlong. We
ought to draw from this a useful admonition, not to become indolent and
careless on account of our being surrounded by so many
*stumbling-blocks,* but to be zealous and active in guarding against
them. It reproves also the effeminacy of those who are so delicate, that
the smallest possible *stumbling-blocks* make them turn back.  <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) It is difficult, I admit, not to
stumble frequently, and even sometimes to fall, when *stumbling-blocks*
without number lie across our path. But our minds ought to be fortified
with confidence; for the Son of God, who commands his followers to walk
in the midst of *stumbling-blocks,* will unquestionably give us strength
to overcome them all. He pronounces likewise an awful punishment against
any hypocrites and reprobate persons, who now appear to be the most
distinguished citizens of the Church.

<span id="ii.xx-p33"></span><span id="ii.xx-p33.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p34"></span>**42.** *And shall cast them into a furnace
of fire.* This is a metaphorical expression; for, as the infinite glory
which is laid up for the sons of God so far exceeds all our senses, that
we cannot find words to express it, so the punishment which awaits the
reprobate is incomprehensible, and is therefore shadowed out according
to the measure of our capacity. From ignorance of this, the Sophists
have tortured themselves, to no purpose, by fruitless disputes, as we
have already hinted on a former occasion.  <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) Some commentators, I am aware, carry
their ingenious inquiries into every minute phrase; but as there is
reason to fear that subtleties, which rest on no solid grounds, may lead
us into idle fooleries, I choose to philosophize more sparingly, and to
rest satisfied with the plain and natural meaning. If we put a question
to those who are so delighted with matters of curiosity, how it comes
about that, while Christ is *asleep,* and unacquainted with the affair,
the devil sows tares among the good seed, they will have nothing to
reply; but while I desire to exercise caution, I have endeavored to
leave out nothing that is useful and necessary to be known.

<span id="ii.xx-p36"></span><span id="ii.xx-p36.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p37"></span>**43.** *Then will the righteous shine.*
<span id="ii.xx-p37.1"></span>What a remarkable consolation! The sons of
God, who now lie covered with dust, or are held in no estimation, or
even are loaded with reproaches, *will then shine* <span
id="ii.xx-p37.2"></span>in full brightness, as when the sky is serene,
and every cloud has been dispelled. The adverb *then* <span
id="ii.xx-p37.3"></span>(<span id="ii.xx-p37.4"></span>τότε<span
id="ii.xx-p37.5"></span>) is emphatic; for it contains an implied
contrast between their present state and the ultimate restoration, by
the expectation of which Christ animates those who believe in him. The
meaning therefore is, Though many wicked men now hold a high rank in the
Church, yet that blessed day is assuredly to be expected, when the Son
of God shall raise his followers on high, and remove every thing that
now tends to dim or conceal their brightness. It is no doubt true, that
the future glory is promised to none but those in whom the image of God
already shines, and who are transformed into it by continued advances of
glory. But as the life of the godly is now hidden, and as their
salvation is invisible, because it consists in hope, Christ properly
directs the attention of believers to heaven, where they will find the
glory that is promised to them.

<span id="ii.xx-p38"></span>In order to make a deeper impression on his
hearers, our Lord unquestionably refers here to a passage in Daniel,
(<span id="ii.xx-p38.1"></span>[Da
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003)<span id="ii.xx-p38.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="ii.xx-p39"></span>And they that are wise shall shine as the
brightness of the firmament.

<span id="ii.xx-p40"></span>“The Prophet,” he seems to say, *“when* he
predicts a future brightness, intimates also that there is a temporary
obscurity: and so, if we admit the prediction, we ought to endure
patiently that mixture which, for a time, classes the elect of God with
the reprobate.” By comparing this glory to *the sun,* he does not
determine that it will be alike in all. As Christ now distributes his
gifts variously  <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) among
believers, in like manner will he crown these gifts at the last day. But
we must recollect what I have said, that the restoration, which is
delayed till the last coming of Christ, is compared with the cloudy
state of the world.  <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md)

<span id="ii.xx-p43"></span>*The kingdom of the Father,* as the
inheritance of the godly, is contrasted with the earth, to remind them
that here they are pilgrims, and therefore ought to look upwards towards
heaven. In another passage, *the kingdom of God* is said to be *within
us,* (<span id="ii.xx-p43.1"></span>[Lu
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.xx-p43.1"></span>*,)* but we shall not obtain the full enjoyment
of it till *God be all in all,* (<span id="ii.xx-p43.2"></span>[1Co
15:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028)<span id="ii.xx-p43.2"></span>..md)
