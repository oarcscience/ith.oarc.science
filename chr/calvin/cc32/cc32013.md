<span id="ii.xii-p5"></span> **22**. Then was brought to him one who was
tormented by a devil, blind and dumb; and he cured him, so that the
blind and dumb person both spoke and saw. **23**. And all the multitudes
were astonished, and said, Is not this the son of David? **24**. But
when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out
devils but by Beelzebub prince of the devils.

<span id="ii.xii-p6"></span> 

<span id="ii.xii-p7"></span> **20**. And they come into the house, and
immediately a multitude assembled, so that they could not even eat
bread.  <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97) **21**. And when those who
were related to him heard it, they went out to lay hands on him;  <span
id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98) for they said, He is gone mad.  <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99) **22**. And the Scribes, who had come
down from Jerusalem, said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the
devils he casteth out devils.

<span id="ii.xii-p11"></span> **14**. And he was casting out a devil,
and it was dumb.  <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100) And when he
had cast out the devil, the dumb person spoke, and the multitudes
wondered.  <span id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101) **15**. And some of
them said, By Beelzebub, the prince of the devils, he casteth out
devils.  <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102)

<span id="ii.xii-p15"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p18"></span>**<span id="ii.xii-p18.1"></span>[Mark
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#020)<span id="ii.xii-p18.1"></span>.**
*And they come into the house. Mark* undoubtedly takes in a somewhat
extended period of time, when he passes from the miracles to that wicked
conspiracy which the relatives of Christ formed with each other, to bind
him as if he had been a *madman. Matthew* and *Luke* mention not more
than a single miracle, as having given to the Pharisees an opportunity
of slander; but as all the three agree in this last clause which is
contained in Mark’s narrative, I have thought it proper to insert it
here.

<span id="ii.xii-p19"></span>It is wonderful that such wickedness should
have been found among the relatives of Christ, who ought to have been
the first to aid him in advancing the kingdom of God. When they see that
he has already obtained some reputation, their ambition leads them to
desire that he should be admired in Jerusalem; for they exhort him to go
up to that city,

<span id="ii.xii-p20"></span>that he may show himself more openly,
(<span id="ii.xii-p20.1"></span>[John
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#003),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#004)<span id="ii.xii-p20.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xii-p21"></span>But now that they perceive him to be hated
on one side by the rulers, exposed on another to numerous slanders, and
even despised by the great body of the people--to prevent any injury, or
envy, or dishonor, from arising to the whole family, they form the
design of *laying hands on him,* and binding him at home, as if he had
been a person who labored under mental derangement; and, as appears from
the words of the Evangelist, such was their actual belief.

<span id="ii.xii-p22"></span>Hence we learn, first, how great is the
blindness of the human mind, in forming such perverse judgments about
the glory of God when openly displayed. Certainly, in all that Christ
said and did, the power of the Holy Spirit shone magnificently; and if
others had not clearly perceived it, how could it be unknown to his
relatives, who were intimately acquainted with him? But because Christ’s
manner of acting does not please the world, and is so far from gaining
its good graces that it exposes him to the resentments of many, they
give out that he is deranged. Let us learn, in the second place, that
the light of faith does not proceed from flesh and blood, but from
heavenly grace, that no man may glory in any thing else than in the
regeneration of the Spirit; as Paul tells us,

<span id="ii.xii-p23"></span>If any man wishes to be considered to be in
Christ,  
let him be a new creature, (<span id="ii.xii-p23.2"></span>[2Co
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017)<span id="ii.xii-p23.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xii-p24"></span><span id="ii.xii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p25"></span>**<span id="ii.xii-p25.2"></span>[Matthew
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#022)<span
id="ii.xii-p25.2"></span>.** *Then was brought to him.* Luke explains
from the effect, that the devil by which the man was possessed was
*dumb;* but Matthew says, that a twofold plague had been inflicted on
the man. Many persons, no doubt, are blind and deaf on account of
natural defects; but it is evident, that this man had become blind, and
had been deprived of the use of speech, though there was no defect in
his optical nerves,  <span id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103) or in the
proportion of his tongue. We need not wonder that so much liberty should
be allowed to Satan in injuring the bodily senses, when God justly
permits him to corrupt or pervert all the faculties of the soul.

<span id="ii.xii-p27"></span><span id="ii.xii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p28"></span>**23.** *And all the people were
astonished.* Hence we infer, that there was a visible display of the
power of God, which drew upon him the admiration of the great body of
the people, who were not at all actuated by any wicked disposition. For
how came it that all admired, but because the fact compelled them to do
so? And certainly there is not one of us, who does not see in this
narrative, as in a mirror, an unwonted power of God: and hence it
follows, that a diabolical venom must have seized the minds of the
scribes, who were not ashamed to slander so remarkable a work of God.
But we must attend to the result of the miracle. Moved with admiration,
those who saw it ask each other, *Is not Jesus the Christ?*
Acknowledging the power of God, they are led, as it were by the hand, to
faith. Not that they suddenly profited as much as they ought to have
done, (for they speak doubtfully;) but yet it is no small proficiency to
be aroused to consider more attentively the glory of Christ. Some look
upon this as a full affirmation, but the words convey no such meaning;
and the fact itself shows, that an unexpected occurrence had struck them
forcibly, and that they did not form a decided opinion, but only that it
occurred to them that he might be the Christ.

<span id="ii.xii-p29"></span><span id="ii.xii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p30"></span>**24.** *But when the Pharisees heard it.*
The scribes cannot withhold the acknowledgment of a fact so open and
manifest, and yet they maliciously carp  <span
id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104) at what Christ did by Divine power.
Not only do they obscure the praise of the miracle, but endeavor to turn
it into a reproach, as if it were performed by magical enchantment; and
that work, which could not be ascribed to a man, is alleged by them to
have the devil for its author. Of the word *Beelzebub* I have spoken
under the Tenth Chapter,  <span id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105) and of
*the prince of the devils* I have said a little under the Ninth Chapter.
 <span id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106) The opinion expressed by the
scribes, that there is a *prince* among wicked spirits, did not arise
from a mistake of the common people, or from supposition, but from a
conviction entertained among the godly, that the reprobate have a head,
in the same manner as Christ is the Head of the Church.

<span id="ii.xii-p33"></span> Harmony, volume 1: p. 419. The reader must
have observed that, when our Author has explained a phrase or
illustrated a fact, he seldom repeats what he had said, but refers to
the earlier portions of his work, in which the information may be found.
It is not improbable that this may have been his leading motive for
adopting the plan of a *Harmony,* instead of writing a separate
Commentary on each Gospel. He had made some observations on <span
id="ii.xii-p33.2"></span>[Mt 9:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#034)<span
id="ii.xii-p33.2"></span>, *But the Pharisees said, He casteth out
devils by the prince of the devils;* and takes for granted, that the
terms which occur in that passage require no farther elucidation. But it
would appear to have escaped his recollection that, on the occasion
alluded to, he satisfied himself with general remarks on the “wicked
slander” of the Pharisees, and took no notice of the phrase, *prince of
the devils.* The deficiency is partly supplied by an explanation which
he now makes. -- *Ed.*
