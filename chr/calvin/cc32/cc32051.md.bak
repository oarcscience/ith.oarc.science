and had not more than one loaf with them in the ship. **15**. And he
charged them saying, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the

themselves, saying, We have not bread.  <span

said to them, Why do you reason that you have no bread? Do you not yet

remember? **19**. When I broke the five thousand men, how many baskets

**20**. And when \[I broke\] the seven among four thousand, how many
baskets of the remains of the fragments did you carry away? And they
said, Seven. **21**. And he said to them, How is it that you do not

which is hypocrisy

*And when his disciples came.* Here Christ takes occasion from the
circumstance that had just occurred  <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) to exhort his disciples to beware of
every abuse that makes an inroad on sincere piety. The Pharisees had
come a little before; the Sadducees joined them; and apart from them
stood Herod, a very wicked man, and an opponent and corrupter of sound
doctrine. In the midst of these dangers it was very necessary to warn
his disciples to be on their guard; for, since the human mind has a
natural inclination towards vanity and errors, when we are surrounded by
wicked inventions, spurious doctrines, and other plagues of the same
sort, nothing is more easy than to depart from the true and simple
purity of the word of God; and if we once become entangled in these
things, it will never be possible for the true religion to hold an
entire sway over us. But to make the matter more clear, let us examine
closely the words of Christ.

<span id="ii.l-p18"></span>*Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees.*
Along with *the Pharisees* Matthew mentions *the Sadducees* Instead of
the latter, Mark speaks of *Herod* Luke takes no notice of any but *the
Pharisees*, (though it is not absolutely certain that it is the same
discourse of Christ which Luke relates,) and explains *the leaven* to be
*hypocrisy* In short, he glances briefly at this sentence, as if there
were no ambiguity in the words. Now the metaphor of *leaven*, which is
here applied to false doctrine, might have been employed, at another
time, to denote the hypocrisy of life and conduct, or the same words
might even have been repeated a second time. But there is no absurdity
in saying, that those circumstances which are more copiously detailed by
the other two Evangelists, in the order in which they took place, are
slightly noticed by Luke in a manner somewhat different, and out of
their proper place or order, but without any real contradiction. If we
choose to adopt this conjecture, *hypocrisy* will denote here something
different from a pretended and false appearance of wisdom. It will
denote the very source and occasion of empty display, which, though it
holds out an imposing aspect to the eyes of men, is of no estimation in
the sight of God. For, as Jeremiah (<span id="ii.l-p18.1"></span>[Jer
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#003)<span id="ii.l-p18.1"></span>.md)
tells us that *the eyes of the Lord behold the truth*, so they that
believe in his word are instructed to maintain true godliness in such a
manner as to cleave to righteousness with an honest and perfect heart;
as in these words,

<span id="ii.l-p19"></span>An now, O Israel, what doth the Lord require
from thee, but that thou shouldst cleave to him with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul? (<span id="ii.l-p19.1"></span>[De
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012)<span id="ii.l-p19.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.l-p20"></span>On the other hand, the traditions of men,
while they set aside spiritual worship, wear a temporary disguise, as if
God could be imposed upon by such deceptions; for to whatever extent
outward ceremonies may be carried, they are, in the sight of God,
nothing more than childish trifles, unless so far as they assist us in
the exercise of true piety.

<span id="ii.l-p21"></span>We now perceive the reason why *hypocrisy*
was viewed by Luke as equivalent to doctrines invented by men, and why
he included under this name the *leavens* of men, which only puff up,
and in the sight of God contain nothing solid, and which even draw aside
the minds of men from the right study of piety to empty and
insignificant ceremonies. But it will be better to abide by the
narrative of Matthew, which is more copious. The disciples, after having
been reproved by our Lord, came at length to understand that he had
charged them to be on their guard against certain doctrine. It was
plainly, therefore, the intention of Christ to fortify them against
prevailing abuses, by which they were attacked on all sides. The
*Pharisees* and *Sadducees* were expressly named, because those two
sects maintained at that time a tyrannical sway in the Church, and held
opinions so utterly subversive of the doctrine of the Law and the
Prophets, that almost nothing remained pure and entire.

<span id="ii.l-p22"></span>But *Herod* did not in any way profess to
teach; and a question arises, why does Mark class him with false
teachers? *Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and Of The Leaven Of
Herod*. I reply: he was half a Jew, was mean and treacherous, and
availed himself of every contrivance that was within his reach to draw
the people to his side; for it is customary with all apostates to
contrive some mixture, for the purpose of establishing a new religion by
which the former may be abolished. It was because he was laboring
craftily to subvert the principles of true and ancient piety, and thus
to give currency to a religion that would be exceedingly adapted to his
tyranny, or rather because he was endeavoring to introduce some new form
of Judaism, that our Lord most properly charged them to *beware of his
leaven.* From the temple of God the scribes disseminated their errors,
and the court of *Herod* was another workshop of Satan, in which errors
of a different kind were manufactured.

<span id="ii.l-p23"></span>Thus in our own day we find that not only
from Popish temples, and from the dens of sophists and monks, does
Antichrist vomit out her impostures, but that there is a Theology of the
Court, which lends its aid to prop up the throne of Antichrist, so that
no stratagem is left untried. But as Christ opposed the evils which then
prevailed, and as he aroused the minds of his followers to guard against
those which were the most dangerous, let us learn from his example to
make a prudent inquiry what are the abuses that may now do us injury.
Sooner shall water mix with fire than any man shall succeed in
reconciling the inventions of the Pope with the Gospel. Whoever desires
to become honestly a disciple of Christ, must be careful to keep his
mind pure from those *leavens;* and if he has already imbibed them, he
must labor to purify himself till none of their polluting effects
remain. There are restless men, on the other hand, who have endeavored
in various ways to corrupt sound doctrine, and, in guarding also against
such impostures, believers must maintain a strict watch, that they may
keep a perpetual Passover

<span id="ii.l-p24"></span>with the unleavened bread of sincerity and
truth,  
(<span id="ii.l-p24.2"></span>[1Co
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008)<span id="ii.l-p24.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.l-p25"></span>And as on every hand there now rages an
impiety like that of Lucian,  <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) a
most pernicious leaven, or rather a worse than deadly poison, let them
exercise this very needful caution, and apply to it all their senses.

<span id="ii.l-p27"></span><span id="ii.l-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ii.l-p28"></span>**8.** *Why do you think within yourselves,
etc.?* The disciples again show how little they had profited by the
instructions of their Master, and by his wonderful works. What he had
said about being on their guard against *the leaven* is rashly
interpreted by them as if Christ intended only to withdraw them from
outward intercourse. As it was customary among the Jews not to take food
in company with irreligious men, the disciples imagine that the
Pharisees were classed with such persons. This ignorance might perhaps
have been endured; but they are forgetful of a favor which they lately
received, and do not consider that Christ has the remedy his power to
hinder them from being compelled to pollute themselves by meat and
drink, and therefore he reproves them sharply, as they deserved. And
certainly it was shameful ingratitude that, after having seen bread
created out of nothing, and in such abundance as to satisfy many
thousands of men, and after having seen this done twice, they are now
anxious about bread, as if their Master did not always possess the same
power. From these words we infer that all who have once or twice
experienced the power of God, and distrust it for the future are
convicted of unbelief; for it is faith that cherishes in our hearts the
remembrance of the gifts of God, and faith must have been laid asleep,
if we allow them to be forgotten.

<span id="ii.l-p29"></span><span id="ii.l-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ii.l-p30"></span>**12.** *Then they understood.* The word
*leaven* is very evidently used by Christ as contrasted with the pure
and uncorrupted word of God. In a former passage, (<span
id="ii.l-p30.2"></span>[Mt 13:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#033.md)<span
id="ii.l-p30.2"></span>,) Christ had used the word in a good sense, when
he said that the Gospel resembled *leaven;*  <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) but for the most part this word is
employed in Scripture to denote some foreign substance, by which the
native purity of any thing is impaired. In this passage, the naked truth
of God, and the inventions which men contrive out of their own brain,
are unquestionably the two things that are contrasted. The sophist must
not hope to escape by saying that this ought not to be understood as
applicable to every kind of doctrine; for it will be impossible to find
any doctrine but what has come from God that deserves the name of pure
and *unleavened* Hence it follows that *leaven* is the name given to
every foreign admixture; as Paul also tells us that faith is rendered
spurious, as soon as we are

<span id="ii.l-p32"></span>drawn aside from the simplicity of Christ,  
(<span id="ii.l-p32.2"></span>[2Co
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003)<span id="ii.l-p32.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.l-p33"></span>It must now be apparent who are the persons
of whose doctrine our Lord charges us to beware. The ordinary government
of the Church was at that time in the hands of the scribes and priests,
among whom the Pharisees held the highest rank. As Christ expressly
charges his followers to beware of *their* doctrine, it follows that all
who mingle their own inventions with the word of God, or who advance any
thing that does not belong to it, must be rejected, how honorable soever
may be their rank, or whatever proud titles they may wear. Accursed and
rebellious, therefore, is the obedience of those who voluntarily submit
to the inventions and laws of the Pope.

the Christian era, author of *Dialogues of the Dead*, is here alluded to
as the type of scoffers and *Atheists*. His subject naturally led him to
treat with sportive humor the solenmities of death and the future
judgment; and the wit and elegance of his pen, had it been guided by
ordinary caution, would have been readily — far too readily — sustained
as an apology for the tone of his work. But in defiance of the ordinary
feelings of mankind, he attacked so fearlessly the most sacred truths,
and offended the ear of modesty by such indecent allusions, that his
character as a man has been stamped with infamy. Modern times have
scarcely produced so daring an infidel, with the exception perhaps of
*Voltaire*, who took no pains to conceal his intense hatred of
Christianity and of good men. Had he appeared earlier, his name might
perhaps have been substituted for that of *Lucian*, as the
representative of his class. — *Ed.*
