<span id="ii.xliv-p4"></span> **34**. And when they had passed over,
they came into the country of Gennesareth. **35**. And when the men of
that place had recognized him, they sent messengers into all the
surrounding country, and brought to him all that were diseased.
**36**. And besought him that they might ouch only the fringe of his
robe; and as many as touched were made whole.

<span id="ii.xliv-p6"></span> **53**. And when they had passed over,
they came into the country of Gennesareth, and landed. **54**. And when
they had left the ship, they immediately knew him.  <span

country round about, they began to carry to him in beds those that were
sick, wheresoever they heard that he was. **56**. And to what place,
soever he went, into villages, or into cities, or into towns, they laid
the diseased in the streets, and besought him that they might touch only
the fringe of his robe; and as many as touched him were healed.

14:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#034.md)<span
id="ii.xliv-p11.2"></span>.** *They came into the country of
Gennesareth.* The Evangelists give that designation to the country which
borrowed its name from the lake, though it is uncertain if it was not
rather the name of the country that was bestowed on the lake; but that
is a matter of little consequence. Our chief business is, to attend to
the object which the Evangelists have in view. It is, to show that the
glory of Christ was attested not by one or by another miracle, but that
this part of Judea was filled with innumerable proofs of it, the report
of which might easily be carried to Jerusalem and to other towns in
every direction. Hence we infer, that singularly base and wicked must
have been the ingratitude of that nation which wickedly shut its eyes
from perceiving, and even endeavored, as far as lay in its power, to
extinguish the brightness of the divine glory which was exhibited before
them. Our present business is, to perceive, amidst so large an
assemblage of miracles, the reason why Christ came, which was, that he
might offer himself as a physician to heal all the diseases of all men
 <span id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md) For we must bear in mind what
Matthew had formerly quoted from the Prophet Isaiah, (<span
id="ii.xliv-p12.2"></span>[Isa
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004)<span id="ii.xliv-p12.2"></span>,.md)
that in healing bodies he shadowed out something greater, namely, that
he restores our souls to health, and that it is his peculiar office to
remove spiritual diseases.  <span id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md) He
is not now an inhabitant of the earth; but it is certain that, now that
he is in heaven, he is authorized to bestow those favors of which he
then exhibited a visible proof. Now as we labor under every kind of
diseases till he heal us, let each of us not only present himself to
him, but endeavor to bring others who need the same remedy.

<span id="ii.xliv-p14"></span>*That they might touch the fringe.* There
is reason to believe that they were under the influence of some
superstition, when they limited the grace of Christ to a touch of his
robe; at least, they defrauded him of a part of his honor, since they
did not expect any efficacy  <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md) to
be derived from his bare word. But that he may not *quench the smoking
flax,* (<span id="ii.xliv-p15.2"></span>[Isa
42:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003)<span id="ii.xliv-p15.2"></span>,.md)
he accommodates himself to their ignorance. Yet there is nothing here
that lends countenance to the views of those who seek the grace of God
in wood, or nails, or robes; while Scripture expressly declares, that we
have no right to form any conception respecting Christ but what is
spiritual and consistent with his heavenly glory. The weakness of those
who, not knowing that Christ is God, desired to make a nearer approach
to him, was endured for a time. Now that he fills heaven and earth with
the sweet savor of his grace, we must embrace—not with hands or eyes,
but by faith—the salvation which he offers to us from heaven.
