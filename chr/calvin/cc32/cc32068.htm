<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p11"></A><b><a name="ii.lxvii-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003">Matthew 19:3</a><a name="ii.lxvii-p11.2"></A>.</b> <i>And the Pharisees came to him, tempting him.</i> Though the Pharisees lay snares for Christ, and cunningly endeavor to impose upon him, yet their malice proves to be highly useful to us; as the Lord knows how to turn, in a wonderful manner, to 			 the advantage of his people all the contrivances of wicked men to overthrow sound doctrine. For, by means of this occurrence, a question arising out of the liberty of divorce was settled, and a fixed law was laid down as to the sacred and indissoluble bond of marriage. The occasion of this quibbling was, that the reply, in whatever way it were given, could not, as they thought, fail to be offensive.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p12"></A>They ask, <i>Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever?</i> If Christ reply in the negative, they will exclaim that he wickedly abolishes the Law; and if in the affirmative, they will give out that he is not a prophet of God, but rather a pander, who lends such countenance to the lust of 			 men. Such were the calculations which they had made in their own minds; but the Son of God, who knew how to <i>take the wise in their own craftiness</i>, (<a name="ii.lxvii-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013">Job 5:13</a><a name="ii.lxvii-p12.1"></A>,) disappointed them, sternly opposing unlawful divorces, and at the same time showing that he brings forward nothing which is 			 inconsistent with the Law. For he includes the whole question under two heads: that the order of creation ought to serve for a law, that the husband should maintain conjugal fidelity during the whole of life; and that <i>divorces </i>were <i>permitted</i>, not because they were lawful, but because Moses had to deal with a rebellious and intractable nation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lxvii-p13"></A><a name="ii.lxvii-p13.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p14"></A><b>4.</b> <i>Have you not read?</i> Christ does not indeed reply directly to what was asked, but he fully meets the question which was proposed; just as if a person now interrogated about the Mass were to explain faithfully the mystery of the Holy Supper, and at length 			 to conclude, that they are guilty of sacrilege and forgery who venture either to add or to take away any thing from the pure institution of the Lord, he would plainly overturn the pretended sacrifice of the Mass. Now Christ assumes as an admitted principle, that at the beginning God <i>joined the male to the female,</i> so that the two made an entire man; and therefore he who 			 <i>divorces his wife </i>tears from him, as it were, the half of himself. But nature does not allow any man to tear in pieces his own body.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.lxvii-p15"></A>He adds another argument drawn from the less to the greater. The bond of marriage is more sacred than that which binds children to their parents. But piety binds children to their parents by a link which cannot be broken. Much less then can the husband renounce his wife. Hence it follows, that a chain which God made is burst asunder, if the husband divorce his wife.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">594</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p17"></A>Now the meaning of the words is this: God, who created the human race, <i>made them male and female,</i> so that every man might be satisfied with his own wife, and might not desire more. For he insists on the number <i>two</i>, as the prophet Malachi, (<a name="ii.lxvii-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015">Mal 2:15</a><a name="ii.lxvii-p17.1"></A>,)when he remonstrates against polygamy, employs the same argument, that God, whose <i>Spirit was so abundant </i>that He had it in His power to create more, <i>yet made but one man, </i>that is, such a man as Christ here describes. 			 And thus from the order of creation is proved the inviolable union of one husband with one wife. If it be objected, that in this way it will not be lawful, after the first wife is dead, to take another, the reply is easy, that not only is the bond dissolved by death, but the second wife is substituted by God in the room of the first, as if she had been one and the same woman.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lxvii-p18"></A><a name="ii.lxvii-p18.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p19"></A><b>5.</b> <i>Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother.</i> It is uncertain whether Moses represents Adam or God as speaking these words; but it is of little consequence to the present passage which of these meanings you choose, for it was enough to quote the 			 decision which God had pronounced, though it might have been uttered by the mouth of Adam. Now he who marries a wife is not commanded absolutely to <i>leave his father</i>; for God would contradict himself, if by marriage He set aside those duties which He enjoins on children towards their parents; but when a comparison is made between the claims, the <i>wife </i>is preferred to the <i>father and mother</i>  But if any man abandon his father, and shake off the yoke by which he is bound, no man will own such a monster;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_594"><FONT SIZE="1">595</FONT></A>
 			  much less will he be at liberty to dissolve a marriage.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p21"></A><i>And the two shall be one flesh.</i> This expression condemns polygamy not less than it condemns unrestrained liberty in divorcing wives; for, if the mutual union of two persons was consecrated by the Lord, the mixture of three or four persons is unauthorized.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_595"></A><A HREF="#fn_595"><FONT SIZE="1">596</FONT></A>
 			  But Christ, as I stated a little ago, applies it in a different manner to his purpose; namely, to show that whoever divorces his wife tears himself in pieces, because such is the force of holy marriage, that the husband and wife become one man. For it was not the design of Christ to introduce the impure and filthy speculation of Plato, but he spoke with reverence of the order which God has established. Let the husband and wife, therefore, live together in such a 			 manner, that each shall cherish the other in the same manner as if they were the half of themselves. Let the husband rule, so as to be the head, and not the tyrant, of his wife; and let the woman, on the other hand, yield modestly to his commands.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p24"></A><b>6.</b> <i>What God therefore hath joined.</i> By this sentence Christ restrains the caprice of husbands, that they may not, by divorcing their wives, burst asunder the sacred knot. And as he declares that it is not in the power of the husband to dissolve the 			 marriage, so likewise he forbids all others to confirm by their authority unlawful divorces; for the magistrate abuses his power when he grants permission to the husband to divorce his wife. But the object which Christ had directly in view was, that every man should sacredly observe the promise which he has given, and that those who are tempted, by wantonness or wicked dispositions, to divorce, may reflect thus with themselves: &#8220;Who, art thou that allowest thyself to <i>burst asunder what God hath joined?</i>&#8221; But this doctrine may be still farther extended. The Papists, contriving for us a church separated from Christ the Head, leave us an imperfect and mutilated body. In the Holy Supper, Christ joined the bread and the wine; but they have dared to withhold from all the people the use of the cup. To these diabolical corruptions we shall be at liberty to oppose these words, 			 <i>What God hath joined let not man separate</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lxvii-p25"></A><a name="ii.lxvii-p25.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p26"></A><b>7.</b> <i>Why then did Moses order?</i> They had thought of this calumny,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">597</FONT></A>
 			 if, which was more probable, Christ should demand a proper cause to be shown in cases of divorce; for it appears that whatever God permits by his law, whose will alone establishes the distinction between what is good or evil, is lawful. But Christ disarms the falsehood and slander by the appropriate reply, that Moses permitted it on account of their obstinacy, and not because he approved of it as lawful. And he confirms his opinion by the best argument, 			 <i>because it was not so at the beginning.</i> He takes for granted that, when God at first instituted marriage, he established a perpetual law, which ought to remain in force till the end of the world. And if the institution of marriage is to be reckoned an inviolable law, it follows that whatever swerves from it does not arise from its pure nature, but from the depravity of 			 men.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.lxvii-p28"></A>But it is asked, Ought Moses to have permitted what was in itself bad and sinful? I reply, That, in an unusual sense of the word, he is said to have<i> permitted </i>what he did not severely forbid;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_597"></A><A HREF="#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">598</FONT></A>
 			 for he did not lay down a law about divorces, so as to give them the seal of his approbation, but as the wickedness of men could not be restrained in any other way, he applied what was the most admissible remedy, that the husband should, at least, attest the chastity of his wife. For the law was made solely for the protection of the women, that they might not suffer any disgrace after they had been unjustly rejected. Hence we infer, that it was rather a punishment inflicted on the 			 husbands, than an indulgence or <i>permission </i>fitted to inflame their lust. Besides, political and outward order is widely different from spiritual government. What is lawful and proper the Lord has comprehended under the <i>ten words</i>.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_598"></A><A HREF="#fn_598"><FONT SIZE="1">599</FONT></A>
 			  Now as it is possible that many things, for which every man&#8217;s conscience reproves and charges him, may not be called in question at a human tribunal, it is not wonderful if those things are connived at by political laws.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p31"></A>Let us take a familiar instance. The laws grant to us a greater liberty of litigation than the law of charity allows. Why is this? Because the right cannot be conferred on individuals, unless there be an open door for demanding it; and yet the inward law of God declares that we ought to follow what charity shall dictate. And yet there is no reason why magistrates should make this an excuse for their indolence, if they voluntarily abstain 			 from correcting vices, or neglect what the nature of their office demands. But let men in a private station beware of doubling the criminality of the magistrates, by screening their own vices under the protection of the laws. For here the Lord indirectly reproves the Jews for not, reckoning it enough that their stubbornness was allowed to pass unpunished, if they did not implicate God as defending their iniquity. And if the rule of a holy and pious life is not always, or in all places, to be 			 sought from political laws, much less ought we to seek it from custom.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lxvii-p32"></A><a name="ii.lxvii-p32.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p33"></A><b>9.</b> <i>But I say to you. Mark </i>relates that this was spoken to the disciples apart, when they had come <i>into the house; </i>but <i>Matthew</i>, leaving out this circumstance, gives it as a part of the discourse, as the Evangelists frequently leave out some intermediate occurrence, because they reckon it enough to sum up the leading points. There is therefore no difference, except that the one explains the matter more distinctly than the other. The substance of it is: though the Law does not punish divorces, which are at variance with God&#8217;s 			 first institution, yet he is an adulterer who rejects his wife and takes another. For it is not in the power of a man to dissolve the engagement of marriage, which the Lord wishes to remain inviolate; and so the woman who occupies the bed of a lawful wife is a concubine.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p34"></A>But an exception is added; for the woman, by fornication, cuts herself off, as a rotten member, from her husband, and sets him at liberty. Those who search for other reasons ought justly to be set at nought, because they choose to be wise above the heavenly teacher. They say that <i>leprosy </i>is a proper ground for divorce, because the contagion of the disease affects not only the husband, but likewise the children. For my own part, while 			 I advise a religious man not to touch a woman afflicted with leprosy, I do not pronounce him to be at liberty to divorce her. If it be objected, that they who cannot live unmarried need a remedy, that they may not be <i>burned</i>, I answer, that what is sought in opposition to the word of God is not a remedy. I add too, that if they give themselves up to be guided by the Lord, they will never want continence, for they follow what he has prescribed. One man shall contract such a dislike 			 of his wife, that he cannot endure to keep company with her: will polygamy cure this evil? Another man&#8217;s wife shall fall into palsy or apoplexy, or be afflicted with some other incurable disease, shall the husband reject her under the pretense of incontinency? We know, on the contrary, that none of those who walk in their ways are ever left destitute of the assistance of the Spirit.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p35"></A><i>For the sake of avoiding fornication</i>, says Paul, <i>let every man marry a wife</i>, (<a name="ii.lxvii-p35.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#002">1Co 7:2</a><a name="ii.lxvii-p35.1"></A>.) He who has done so, though he may not succeed to his wish, has done his duty; and, therefore, if any thing be wanting, he will be supported by divine aid. To go beyond this is nothing else than to tempt God. When Paul mentions 			 another reason, namely, that when, through a dislike of godliness, wives happen to be rejected by unbelievers, a godly <i>brother or sister </i>is not, in such a case, liable to <i>bondage</i>, (<a name="ii.lxvii-p35.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#012">1 Cor. 7:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015">15</a><a name="ii.lxvii-p35.2"></A>,) this is not inconsistent with Christ&#8217;s meaning. For he does not there inquire into the proper grounds of divorce, but only whether a woman continues to 			 be bound to an unbelieving husband, after that, through hatred of God, she has been wickedly rejected, and cannot be reconciled to him in any other way than by forsaking God; and therefore we need not wonder if Paul think it better that she should part with a mortal man than that she should be at variance with God.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p36"></A>But the exception which Christ states appears to be superfluous. For, if the adulteress deserve to be punished with death, what purpose does it serve to talk of divorces? But as it was the duty of the husband to prosecute his wife for adultery, in order to purge his house from infamy, whatever might be the result, the husband, who convicts his wife of uncleanness, is here freed by Christ from the bond. It is even possible that, among a 			 corrupt and degenerate people, this crime remained to a great extent unpunished; as, in our own day, the wicked forbearance of magistrates makes it necessary for husbands to put away unchaste wives, because adulterers are not punished. It must also be observed, that the right belongs equally and mutually to both sides, as there is a mutual and equal obligation to fidelity. For, though in other matters the husband holds the superiority, as to the marriage bed, the wife has an equal right: for he 			 is not the lord of his body; and therefore when, by committing adultery, he has dissolved the marriage, the wife is set at liberty.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p37"></A><i>And whosoever shall marry her that is divorced.</i> This clause has been very ill explained by many commentators; for they have thought that generally, and without exception, celibacy is enjoined in all cases when a divorce has taken place; and, therefore, if a husband should put away an adulteress, both would be laid under the 			 necessity of remaining unmarried. As if this liberty of divorce meant only not to lie with his wife; and as if Christ did not evidently grant permission in this case to do what the Jews were wont indiscriminately to do at their pleasure. It was therefore a gross error; for, though Christ condemns as an adulterer the man <i>who shall marry a wife that has been divorced</i>, this is undoubtedly restricted 			 to unlawful and frivolous divorces. In like manner, Paul enjoins those who have been so dismissed</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ii.lxvii-p38"></A>to remain unmarried, or to be reconciled to their husbands, <br> 			 (<a name="ii.lxvii-p38.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#011">1Co 7:11</a><a name="ii.lxvii-p38.2"></A>;)</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxvii-p39"></A>that is, because quarrels and differences do not dissolve a marriage. This is clearly made out from the passage in Mark, where express mention is made of the wife who has left her husband: <i>and if the wife shall divorce her husband</i>  Not that wives were permitted to give their 			 husbands a letter of divorcement, unless so far as the Jews had been contaminated by foreign customs; but Mark intended to show that our Lord condemned the corruption which was at that time universal, that, after voluntary divorces, they entered on both sides into new marriages; and therefore he makes no mention of adultery.</p>
