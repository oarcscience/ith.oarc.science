gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and
findeth it not. **44**. Then he saith, I will return to my house, whence
I came out; and coming, he findeth it empty, and swept, and embellished.
**45**. Then he goeth away, and taketh with him seven other spirits more
wicked than himself; and entering, he dwelleth there: and the last state
of that man is worse than the first.  <span

generation.

<span id="ii.xv-p6"></span> **24**. When the unclean spirit hath gone
out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and not
finding it, he saith, I will return to my house, whence I came out.
**25**. And when he is come, he findeth it swept and embellished.
**26**. Then he goeth, and taketh with him seven other spirits more
wicked than himself; and entering, they dwell there: and the last state
of that man is worse than the first.

<span id="ii.xv-p7"></span> 

<span id="ii.xv-p8"></span> 

<span id="ii.xv-p9"></span><span id="ii.xv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xv-p10"></span>**43.** *But when the unclean spirit hath
gone out.* He speaks of scribes and hypocrites of a similar character,
who, despising the grace of God, enter into a conspiracy with the devil.
Against such persons he pronounces that punishment which their
ingratitude deserves. To make his doctrine more extensively useful, he
points out, in a general manner, the condemnation that awaits those who,
despising the grace offered to them, again open the door to the devil.
But as almost every particle has great weight, there are some points
that must be noticed in their order, before we come to treat the
substance of the parable.

<span id="ii.xv-p11"></span>What Christ says about the *going out* of
the devil is intended to magnify the power and efficacy of the grace of
God. Whenever God draws near to us, and, above all, when he approaches
us in the person of his Son, the design is, to rescue us from the
tyranny of the devil, and to receive us into his favor. This had been
openly declared by Christ in the miracle which he had lately performed.
As it is the peculiar office of Christ to banish wicked spirits, that
they may no longer reign over men, the devil is justly said to *go out
of* those men to whom Christ exhibits himself as a Redeemer. Though the
presence of Christ is not efficacious to all, because unbelievers render
it useless to them, yet he intended to point out why he visits us, what
is implied in his coming, and how it is regarded by wicked spirits; for
in every case in which Christ operates on men, the devils are drawn into
a contest with him, and sink beneath his power. Let us, therefore, hold
it to be a settled point, that the devil is cast out of us, whenever
Christ shines upon us, and displays his grace towards us by some
manifestation.

<span id="ii.xv-p12"></span>*Secondly*, the wretched condition of the
whole human race is here described to us; for it follows that the devil
has a residence within man, since he is driven from it by the Son of
God. Now what is here said relates not to one individual or to another,
but to the whole posterity of Adam. And this is the glory of our nature,
that the devil has his seat within us, and inhabits both the body and
the soul. So much the more illustrious is the display of the mercy of
God, when we, who were the loathsome dens of the devil, are made temples
to Himself, and consecrated for a habitation of His Spirit.

<span id="ii.xv-p13"></span>*Thirdly*, we have here a description of
Satan’s nature. He never ceases to do us injury, but is continually
busy, and moves from one place to another. In a word, he directs all his
efforts to accomplish our destruction; and above all, when he has been
vanquished and put to flight by Christ, it only tends more to whet his
rage and keenness to do us injury.  <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) Before Christ makes us partakers of
his energy, it seems as if it were in sport and amusement that this
enemy reigns over us;  <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) but when
he has been driven out, he conceives resentment at having lost his prey,
collects new forces, and arouses all his senses to attack us anew.

<span id="ii.xv-p16"></span>*He walketh through dry places.* This is a
metaphorical expression, and denotes that to dwell out of men is to him
a wretched banishment, and resembles a barren wilderness. Such, too, is
the import of the phrase, *seeking rest,* so long as he dwells out of
men; for then he is displeased and tormented, and ceases not to labor by
one means or by another, till he recover what he has lost.  <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) Let us, therefore, learn that, as soon
as Christ calls us, a sharper and fiercer contest is prepared for us.
Though he meditates the destruction of all, and though the words of
Peter apply to all without exception, that he

<span id="ii.xv-p18"></span>goeth about as a roaring lion, and seeketh
whom he may devour,  
(<span id="ii.xv-p18.2"></span>[1Pe
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#008)<span id="ii.xv-p18.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="ii.xv-p19"></span>yet we are plainly taught by these words of
Christ, that Satan views with deeper hatred, and attacks with greater
fierceness and rage, those who have been rescued from his snares. Such
an admonition, however, ought not to inspire us with terror, but to
arouse us to keep diligent watch, and to put on the spiritual armor,
that we may make a brave resistance.

<span id="ii.xv-p20"></span><span id="ii.xv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xv-p21"></span>**44.** *He findeth it empty* Christ is
unquestionably describing those who, being destitute of the Spirit of
God, are prepared for receiving the devil; for believers, in whom the
Spirit of God efficaciously dwells, are fortified on all sides, so that
no opening is left for Satan. The metaphor of *a house swept and
embellished* is taken from men who find pleasure in the cleanness and
neatness of their apartments; for to Satan no sight is beautiful but
deformity itself, and no smell is sweet but filth and nastiness. The
meaning therefore is, that Satan never finds a more appropriate
habitation within us, than when, having parted with Christ, we receive
Satan as a guest.  <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) His highest
delight is in that *emptiness* by which the neglect of divine grace is
followed.  <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md)

<span id="ii.xv-p24"></span><span id="ii.xv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xv-p25"></span>**45.** *He taketh with him seven other
spirits* The number *seven* is here used indefinitely, as in many other
passages. By these words Christ shows that if we fall from his grace,
our subjection to Satan is doubled, so that he treats us with greater
cruelty than before, and that this is the just punishment of our
slothfulness.  <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) Let us not then
suppose that the devil has been vanquished by a single combat, because
he has once gone out of us. On the contrary, let us remember that, as
his lodgment within us was of old standing, ever since we were born, he
has knowledge and experience of all the approaches by which he may reach
us; and that, if there be no open and direct entrance, he has dexterity
enough to creep in by small holes or winding crevices.  <span
id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) We must, therefore, endeavor that
Christ, holding his reign within us, may block up all the entrances of
his adversary. Whatever may be the fierceness or violence of Satan’s
attacks, they ought not to intimidate the sons of God, whom the
invincible power of the Holy Spirit preserves in safety. We know that
the punishment which is here threatened is addressed to none but those
who despise the grace of God, and who, by extinguishing the light of
faith, and banishing the desire of godliness,  <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) become profane.
