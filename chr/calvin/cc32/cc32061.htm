And even if the weak labor under imperfections which may expose them to contempt, our pride is not on that account to be excused; for we ought to esteem them not for the value of their virtues, but for the sake of Christ; and he who will not conform himself to 			 Christ&#8217;s example is too saucy and proud.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lx-p12"></A><b>12.</b> <i>What think you?</i> Luke carries the occasion of this parable still farther back, as having arisen from the <i>murmurings </i>of the <i>Pharisees and scribes </i>against our 			 Lord, whom they saw conversing daily with sinners. Christ therefore intended to show that a good teacher ought not to labor less to recover those that are <i>lost</i>, than to preserve those which are in his possession; though according to Matthew the comparison proceeds farther, and teaches us not only that we ought to treat with kindness the disciples of Christ, but that we ought to bear with their 			 imperfections, and endeavor, when they wander, to bring them back to the road. For, though they happen sometimes to wander, yet as they are <i>sheep </i>over which God has appointed his Son to be shepherd, so far are we from having a right to chase or drive them away roughly, that we ought to gather them from their wanderings; for the object of the discourse is to lead us to beware of <i>losing </i>what God 			 wishes to be <i>saved</i>  The narrative of Luke presents to us a somewhat different object. It is, that the whole human race belongs to God, and that therefore we ought to gather those that have gone astray, and that we ought to rejoice as much, when they that are <i>lost </i>return to the path of duty, as a man would do who, beyond his expectation, recovered 			 something the loss of which had grieved him.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lx-p14"></A><b><a name="ii.lx-p14.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#010">Luke 15:10</a><a name="ii.lx-p14.2"></A>.</b> <i>There will be joy in the presence of the angels.</i> If <i>angels </i>mutually rejoice with each other in heaven, when they see that what had wandered is restored to the fold, we too, who have the same cause in 			 common with them, ought to be partakers of the same <i>joy</i>  But. how does he say that the <i>repentance </i>of one ungodly man yields greater joy than the perseverance of many <i>righteous </i>men to <i>angels</i>, whose 			 highest delight is in a continued and uninterrupted course of <i>righteousness</i>? I reply, though it would be more agreeable to the wishes of <i>angels </i>(as it is also more desirable) that men should always remain in perfect integrity, yet as in the deliverance of a sinner, who had been already devoted to destruction, and had been cut off as a rotten member from the body, the mercy of God shines more 			 brightly, he attributes to <i>angels</i>, after the manner of men, a <i>greater joy </i>arising out of an unexpected good.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lx-p15"></A><i>Over one repenting sinner.</i> The word <i>repentance </i>is specially limited to the conversion of those who, having altogether turned aside from God, rise as it were from death to life; for otherwise the exercise of repentance ought to be uninterrupted throughout our whole life,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">511</FONT></A>
 			  and no man is exempted from this necessity, since every one is reminded by his imperfections that he ought to aim at daily progress. But it is one thing, when a man, who has already entered upon the right course, though he stumble, or fall, or even go astray, endeavors to reach the goal; and another thing, when a man leaves a road which was entirely wrong, or only starts in the right course.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">512</FONT></A>
 			  Those who have already begun to regulate their life by the standard of the divine law, do not need that kind of <i>repentance </i>which consists in beginning to lead a holy and pious life, though they must groan   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">513</FONT></A>
 			  under the infirmities of the flesh, and labor to correct them.</p>
