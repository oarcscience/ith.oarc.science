<span id="ii.lxiv-p4"></span> **21**. Then Peter approaching him said,
Lord, how often shall my brother offend against me, and I forgive him?
Till seven times? **22**. Jesus saith to him, I say not to thee till
seven times, but till seventy times seven. **23**. Therefore the kingdom
of heaven is compared to a king, who wished to make a reckoning with his
servants. **24**. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought to
him who owed ten thousand talents. **25**. But as he was unable to pay,
his master commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all
that he had, and payment to be made. **26**. And that servant falling
down, entreated him, saying, Master, have patience with me, and I will
pay thee all. **27**. And his master, pitying that servant, forgave him,
and acquitted him of the debt. **28**. But that servant, having gone
out, found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred pence: and
laying hands on him, saying, Pay me what thou owest. **29**. And his
fellow-servant, fallind down, entreated him, saying, Have patience with
me, and I will pay thee all. **30**. But he would not, but went out, and
threw him into prison, till he should pay the debt. **31**. And when his
fellow-servants saw what was done, they were deeply grieved, and came,
and related to their master all that had been done. **32**. Then his
master called him, and said to him, Wicked servant, I forgave thee all
that debt, because thou didst implore me: **33**. Oughtest not thou also
to pity thy fellow-servant, even as I pitied thee? **34**. And his
master, being enraged, delivered him to the tormentors, till he should
pay all that he owed him. **35**. So likewise shall my heavenly Father
do to you, if you forgive not every one his brother from your hearts
their offenses.

<span id="ii.lxiv-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.lxiv-p6"></span>**4**. And if seven times in a day he shall
offend against thee, and seven times in a day he shall turn to thee,
saying, I repent, forgive him.

<span id="ii.lxiv-p7"></span>

<span id="ii.lxiv-p9"></span><span id="ii.lxiv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxiv-p10"></span>**<span id="ii.lxiv-p10.2"></span>[Matthew
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.lxiv-p10.2"></span>.** *Lord, how often shall my brother offend
against me?*<span id="ii.lxiv-p10.3"></span> Peter made this objection
according to the natural feelings and disposition of the flesh. It is
natural to all men to wish to be forgiven; and, therefore, if any man
does not immediately obtain forgiveness, he complains that he is treated
with sternness and cruelty. But those who demand to be treated gently
are far from being equally gentle towards others; and therefore, when
our Lord exhorted his disciples to meekness, this doubt occurred to
Peter: “If we be so strongly disposed to grant forgiveness, what will be
the consequence, but that our lenity shall be an inducement to
*offend*<span id="ii.lxiv-p10.4"></span>?”  <span
id="fr_570"></span>[571](#fn_570.md) <span id="ii.lxiv-p11.2"></span>He
asks, therefore, if it be proper frequently to forgive offenders; for,
since the number *seven* <span id="ii.lxiv-p11.3"></span>is <span
id="ii.lxiv-p11.4"></span>taken for a large number, the force of the
adverb, (<span id="ii.lxiv-p11.5"></span>ἑπτάκις<span
id="ii.lxiv-p11.6"></span>) *seven times*<span
id="ii.lxiv-p11.7"></span>, <span id="ii.lxiv-p11.8"></span>is the same
as if he had said, “How long, Lord, dost thou wish that offenders be
received into favor? for it is unreasonable, and by no means
advantageous, that they should, in every case, <span
id="ii.lxiv-p11.9"></span>find us willing to be reconciled.” But Christ
is so far from yielding to this objection, that he expressly declares
that there ought to be no limit to forgiving;  <span
id="fr_571"></span>[572](#fn_571.md) <span id="ii.lxiv-p12.2"></span>for he
did not intend to lay down a fixed number, but rather to enjoin us never
to become wearied.

<span id="ii.lxiv-p13"></span>*Luke* differs somewhat from *Matthew*;
for he states the command of Christ to be simply, that we should be
prepared to *forgive seven times;* but the meaning is the same, that we
ought to be ready and prepared to grant forgiveness not once or twice,
but as often as the sinner *shall repent* There is only this difference
between them, that, according to Matthew, our Lord, in reproving Peter
for taking too limited a view, employs hyperbolically a larger number,
which of itself is sufficient to point out the substance of what is
intended. For when Peter asked if he should *forgive seven times,* it
was not because he did not choose to go any farther, but, by presenting
the appearance of a great absurdity, to withdraw Christ from his
opinion, as I have lately hinted. So then he who shall be prepared to
*forgive seven times* will be willing to be reconciled as far as to the
*seventieth* offense.

<span id="ii.lxiv-p14"></span>But the words of Luke give rise to another
question; for Christ does not order us to grant *forgiveness*, till *the
offender turn* to us and give evidence of *repentance*.  <span
id="fr_572"></span>[573](#fn_572.md) I reply, there are two ways in which
offenses are *forgiven.* If a man shall do me an injury, and I, laying
aside the desire of revenge, do not cease to love him, but even repay
kindness in place of injury, though I entertain an unfavorable opinion
of him, as he deserves, still I am said to *forgive him*. For when God
commands us to wish well to our enemies, He does not therefore demand
that we approve in them what He condemns, but only desires that our
minds shall be purified from all hatred. In this kind of pardon, so far
are we from having any right to wait till he who has offended shall
return of his own accord to be reconciled to us, that we ought to love
those who deliberately provoke us, who spurn reconciliation, and add to
the load of former offenses. A second kind of *forgiving* is, when we
receive a *brother* into favor, so as to think favorably respecting him,
and to be convinced that the remembrance of his offense is blotted out
in the sight of God. And this is what I have formerly remarked, that in
this passage Christ does not speak only of injuries which have been done
to us, but of every kind of offenses; for he desires that, by our
compassion, we shall raise up those who have fallen.  <span
id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573.md) This doctrine is very necessary,
because naturally almost all of us are peevish beyond measure; and
Satan, under the pretense of severity, drives us to cruel rigor, so that
wretched men, to whom pardon is refused, are swallowed up by grief and
despair.

<span id="ii.lxiv-p17"></span>But here another question arises. As soon
as a man by words makes profession of *repentance*, are we bound to
believe him? Were this done, we must of necessity go willingly and
knowingly into mistake; for where will be discretion, if any man may
freely impose on us, even to the hundredth offense? I answer, *first*,
the discourse relates here to daily faults, in which every man, even the
best, needs forgiveness.  <span id="fr_574"></span>[575](#fn_574.md) Since,
then, amidst such infirmity of the flesh, our road is so slippery, and
snares and attacks so numerous what will be the consequence if, at the
second or third fall, the hope *of forgiveness* is cut off? We must add,
*secondly,* that Christ does not deprive believers of the exercise of
judgment, so as to yield a foolish readiness of belief to every slight
expression, but only desires us to be so candid and merciful, as to
stretch out the hand to *offenders*, provided there be evidence that
they are sincerely dissatisfied with their sins. For repentance is a
sacred thing, and therefore needs careful examination; but as soon as
the offender gives probable evidence of conversion, Christ desires that
he shall be admitted to reconciliation, lest, on being repulsed, he lose
courage and fall back.

<span id="ii.lxiv-p19"></span>*Thirdly*, It must be observed that, when
any man, through his light and unsteady behavior, has exposed himself to
suspicion, we may grant pardon when he asks it, and yet may do so in
such a manner as to watch over his conduct for the future, that our
forbearance and meekness, which proceed from the Spirit of Christ, may
not become the subject of his ridicule. For we must observe the design
of our Lord himself, that we ought, by our gentleness, to assist those
who have fallen to rise again. And certainly we ought to imitate the
goodness of our heavenly Father, who meets sinners at a distance to
invite them to salvation. Besides, as repentance is a wonderful work of
the Spirit, and is the creation of the new man, if we despise it, we
offer an insult to God himself.

<span id="ii.lxiv-p20"></span><span id="ii.lxiv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxiv-p21"></span>**23.** *The kingdom of heaven is
compared.* As it is difficult to bend us to mercy, and as we are quickly
seized with weariness, particularly when we have to bear with many
faults of brethren, our Lord confirms this doctrine by a most
appropriate parable, the substance of which is, that those who will not
yield to pardon the faults of brethren judge very ill for themselves,
and subject themselves to a very hard and severe law; for they will find
God to be equally stern and inexorable towards themselves. There are
three parts in which the resemblance mainly consists; for the *master*
is contrasted with the *servant*, the large sum of money with small or
ordinary sums, and extraordinary kindness with extreme cruelty. By
attending to these three points, it will be easy to ascertain Christ’s
meaning; for what are we, if we are compared with God? And how large is
the sum which every one of us owes to God? Lastly, how inconsiderable
are the offenses, with which brethren are chargeable towards us, if we
take into account our obligation to God? How ill then does that man
deserve the compassion of God, who, though oppressed with an immense
load, implacably refuses to forgive even the smallest offenses to men
like himself? So far as regards the words, *the kingdom of heaven* here
denotes the spiritual condition of the Church; as if Christ had said,
that the state of matters between God and men, in regard to the soul and
the nature of spiritual life, is the same as between an ordinary or
earthly *master* and his *servants*, in regard to money and the affairs
of the present life.

<span id="ii.lxiv-p22"></span><span id="ii.lxiv-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxiv-p23"></span>**25.** *His master ordered him to be
sold.* It would be an idle exercise of ingenuity to examine here every
minute clause. For God does not always display severity at first, till,
constrained to pray, we implore pardon, but rather meets us with
undeserved goodness. But Christ only shows what will become of us, if
God shall treat us with the utmost severity; and again, if He shall
choose to demand from us what we owe, how necessary it is for us to
betake ourselves to prayer, because this is the only refuge that remains
for transgressors. We must also attend to the wide difference of the
sums; for, since one *talent* is worth more than *a hundred pence*, what
proportion will *a hundred pence* bear to *ten thousand talents?*

<span id="ii.lxiv-p24"></span><span id="ii.lxiv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxiv-p25"></span>**31.** *When his fellow-servants saw what
was done.* Though we ought not to search for mystery in these words —
because they contain nothing but what nature teaches, and what we learn
by daily experience — we ought to know that the men who live among us
will be so many witnesses against us before God; for it is impossible
but that cruelty shall excite in them displeasure and hatred, more
especially, since every man is afraid that what he sees done to others
will fall upon his own head. As to the clause which immediately follows,
it is foolish to inquire how God punishes those sins  <span
id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575.md) which he has already forgiven; for the
simple meaning is this: though he offers mercy to all, yet severe
creditors, from whom no forgiveness can be obtained, are unworthy of
enjoying it.

<span id="ii.lxiv-p27"></span><span id="ii.lxiv-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxiv-p28"></span>**34.** *Delivered him to the tormentors,
till he should pay all that he owed.* The Papists are very ridiculous in
endeavoring to light the fire of purgatory by the word *till*; for it is
certain that Christ here points out not temporal death, by which the
judgment of God may be satisfied, but eternal death.
