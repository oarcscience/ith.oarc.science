<span id="ii.xxiv-p3"></span> **38**. And it happened, while they were
traveling, that he entered into a certain village; and a certain woman,
called Martha, received him into her house. **39**. And she had a sister
called Mary, who also, sitting at the feet of Jesus, heard his word.
**40**. And Martha was cumbered about much serving; who stood, and said,
Lord, hast thou no care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid
her therefore assist me. **41**. And Jesus answering said to her,
Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and distressed about many things.
**42** But one thing is necessary: Mary hath chosen the good part, which
shall not be taken from her.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxiv-p5"></span><span id="ii.xxiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiv-p6"></span>**38.** *And it happened that he entered
into a certain village.* This narrative shows, that Christ, wherever he
came, did not devote himself to his private concerns, or consult his own
ease or comfort; but that the single object which he kept in view was,
to do good to others, and to discharge the office which had been
committed to him by the Father. Luke relates that, having been
hospitably received by Martha, as soon as he entered the house, he began
to teach and exhort. As this passage has been basely distorted into the
commendation of what is called a Contemplative life, we must inquire
into its true meaning, from which it will appear, that nothing was
farther from the design of Christ, than to encourage his disciples to
indulge in indolence, or in useless speculations. It is, no doubt, an
old error  <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) , that those who
withdraw from business, and devote themselves entirely to a
contemplative, lead an Angelical life. For the absurdities which the
*Sorbonnists*  <span id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) utter on this
subject they appear to have been indebted to Aristotle, who places the
highest good, and ultimate end, of human life in contemplation, which,
according to him, is the enjoyment of virtue. When some men were driven
by ambition to withdraw from the ordinary intercourse of life, or when
peevish men gave themselves up to solitude and indolence, the resolution
to adopt that course was followed by such pride, that they imagined
themselves to be like the angels, because they did nothing; for they
entertained as great a contempt for active life, as if it had kept them
back from heaven. On the contrary, we know that men were created for the
express purpose of being employed in labor of various kinds, and that no
sacrifice is more pleasing to God, than when every man applies
diligently to his own calling, and endeavors to live in such a manner as
to contribute to the general advantage.  <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md)

<span id="ii.xxiv-p10"></span>How absurdly they have perverted the words
of Christ to support their own contrivance, will appear manifest when we
have ascertained the natural meaning. Luke says that *Mary sat at the
feet of Jesus* Does he mean that she did nothing else throughout her
whole life? On the contrary, the Lord enjoins his followers to make such
a distribution of their time, that he who desires to make proficiency in
the school of Christ shall not always be an idle hearer but shall put in
practice what he has learned; for there is a time to hear, and a time to
act.  <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) It is, therefore, a
foolish attempt of the monks to take hold of this passage, as if Christ
were drawing a comparison between a contemplative and an active life,
while Christ simply informs us for what end, and in what manner, he
wishes to be received.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p12"></span>Though the hospitality of Martha deserved
commendation, and is commended, yet there were two faults in it which
are pointed out by Christ. The first is, that Martha carried her
activity beyond proper bounds; for Christ would rather have chosen to be
entertained in a frugal manner, and at moderate expense, than that the
holy woman should have submitted to so much toil. The second fault was,
that Martha, by distracting her attention, and undertaking more labor
than was necessary, deprived herself of the advantage of Christ’s visit.
The excess is pointed out by Luke, when he speaks of *much serving;* for
Christ was satisfied with little. It was just as if one were to give a
magnificent reception to a prophet, and yet not to care about hearing
him, but, on the contrary, to make so great and unnecessary preparations
as to bury all the instruction. But the true way of receiving prophets
is, to accept the advantage which God presents and offers to us through
their agency.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p13"></span>We now see that the kind attention of
Martha, though it deserved praise, was not without its blemishes. There
was this additional evil, that Martha was so delighted with her own
bustling operations, as to despise her sister’s pious eagerness to
receive instruction.  <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) This
example warns us, that, in doing what is right, we must take care not to
think more highly of ourselves than of others.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p15"></span><span id="ii.xxiv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiv-p16"></span>**42.** *But one thing is necessary.* Some
give a very meager interpretation of these words, as if they meant that
one sort of dish is enough.  <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md)
Others make ingenious inquiries, but beside the purpose, about Unity.
 <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) But Christ had quite another
design, which was, that whatever believers may undertake to do, and in
whatever employments they may engage, there is one object to which every
thing ought to be referred. In a word, we do but wander to no purpose,
if we do not direct all our actions to a fixed object. The hospitality
of Martha was faulty in this respect, that she neglected the main
business, and devoted herself entirely to household affairs. And yet
Christ does not mean that every thing else, with the exception of this
*one thing,* is of no importance, but that we must pay a proper
attention to order, lest what is *accessory*—*as* the phrase is—become
our chief concern.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p19"></span>*Mary hath chosen the good part.* There is
no comparison here, as unskillful and mistaken interpreters dream.
Christ only declares, that Mary is engaged in a holy and profitable
employment, in which she ought not to be disturbed. “You would have a
good right,” he says, “to blame your sister, if she indulged in ease, or
gave herself up to trifling occupations, or aimed at something
unsuitable to her station, and left to you the whole charge of the
household affairs. But now, when she is properly and usefully employed
in hearing, it would be an act of injustice to withdraw her from it; for
an opportunity so favorable is not always in her power.” There are some,
indeed, who give a different interpretation to the latter clause, *which
shall not be taken away from her,* as if Christ intended to say, that
*Mary hath chosen the good part,* because the fruit of heavenly doctrine
can never perish. For my own part, I have no objection to that opinion,
but have followed the view which appeared to me to be more in accordance
with Christ’s design.  <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md)

<span id="ii.xxiv-p7"></span> “<span id="ii.xxiv-p7.1"></span>Il est

“it is true that this error is not of today, but is very old.”

<span id="ii.xxiv-p8"></span> “Some readers may happen to ask, Who were
the *Sorbonnists,* or, as they are often called, *the Doctors of the
Sorbonne?* In reply, I take the liberty of extracting from a volume,
which I gave to the world a few years ago, a few remarks on this
subject.” — “The College of the *Sorbonne,* in Paris, takes its name
from *Robert de Sorbonne,* who founded it in the middle of the
thirteenth century. Its reputation for theological learning, philosophy,
classical literature, and all that formerly constituted a liberal
education, was deservedly high. In the Doctors of the Sorbonne the
Reformation found powerful adversaries. The very name of this
University, to which the greatest scholars in Europe were accustomed to
pay deference, would be regarded by the multitude with blind veneration.
If such men as Calvin, Beza, Melancthon, and Luther, were prepared by
talents and acquirements of the first order to brave the terrors of that
name, they must have frequently lamented its influence on many of their
hearers. Yet our author meets undaunted this formidable array, and
enters the field with the full assurance of victory. Despising, as we
naturally do, the weak superstitions and absurd tenets held by the
Church of Rome, we are apt to underrate our obligations to the early
champions of the Reformed faith, who encountered with success those
veteran warriors, and *contended earnestly* (<span

Iesus Christ eust voulu exlurre tout nombre;” — “others more
ingeniously, but inappropriately, treaying here of *unity:* as if, by
the word *One*, Jesus Christ intended to exclude all diversity of
employment.”

<span id="fn_259"></span>[260](cc32025.htm#fr_259.md) <span
id="ii.xxiv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiv-p20"></span> Calvin appears to interpret the words,
*which shall not be taken from her,* not as a doctrinal statement, but
as a command, or, at least, as marking out the line of conduct which
ought to be pursued by *Martha* and others towards *Mary. The good
part,* or, as he explains it, “the holy and profitable employment,”
*shall not be take, from her.* “She ought not to be disturbed,” and “it
would be an act of injustice to withdraw her from it.” — *Ed.*
