<span id="ii.lxvi-p5"></span>**1**. And it happened, when Jesus had
finished these discourses, he departed from Galilee, and came into the
coasts of Judea beyond Jordan. **2**. And great multitudes followed him,
and he cured them there.

<span id="ii.lxvi-p6"></span> 

<span id="ii.lxvi-p7"></span> **38**. And John answered him, saying,
Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not
us; and we forbade him, because he followeth him, because he followeth
not us. **39**. And Jesus said, Forbid him not; for there is no man who,
if he has performed a miracle in my name, can easily speak evil of me.
**40**. For he who is not against us is for us.

<span id="ii.lxvi-p8"></span><span id="ii.lxvi-p8.1"></span>[Mark
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001.md)<span id="ii.lxvi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxvi-p9"></span>**1**. And when he had risen thence, he
came into the coasts of Judea, through the district which is beyond
Jordan. And again the multitudes assemble to him, and again he taught
them, as he was accustomed.

<span id="ii.lxvi-p10"></span> 

<span id="ii.lxvi-p11"></span> **49**. And John answering said, Master,
we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbade him, because
he followeth not with us. **50**. And Jesus said to him, Forbid him not;
for he who is not against us is for us. **51**. And it happened, when
the days of his being received up were in course of being fulfilled, and
he set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem. **52**. And he sent
messengers before his face; and they went and entered into a town of the
Samaritans, to make ready for him: **53**. And they did not receive him,
because his face was as if he were going to Jerusalem.  <span
id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583.md) **54**. And when his disciples James
and John saw it, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come
down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elijah did? **55**. And
Jesus, turning, rebuked them, saying, You know not of what spirit you
are. **56**. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but
to save them. And they went into another village.

<span id="ii.lxvi-p13"></span> 

<span id="ii.lxvi-p14"></span><span id="ii.lxvi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxvi-p15"></span>**<span id="ii.lxvi-p15.2"></span>[Mark
9:38](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#038.md)<span
id="ii.lxvi-p15.2"></span>.** *Master, we saw one.* Hence it is evident
that the *name* of Christ was at that time so celebrated, that persons
who were not of the number of his intimate disciples used that *name*,
or perhaps even abused it, for I will not venture to avouch any thing on
this point as certain. It is possible that he who is here mentioned had
embraced the doctrine of Christ, and betaken himself to the performance
of miracles with no bad intention; but as Christ bestowed this power on
none but those whom he had chosen to be heralds of his Gospel, I think
that he had rashly taken, or rather seized upon, this office. Now though
he was wrong in making this attempt, and in venturing to imitate the
disciples without receiving a command to do so, yet his boldness was not
without success: for the Lord was pleased, in this way also, to throw
luster around his name,  <span id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584.md) as he
sometimes does by means of those of whose ministry he does not approve
as lawful. It is not inconsistent with this to say, that one who was
endued with special faith followed a blind impulse, and thus proceeded
inconsiderately to work miracles.

<span id="ii.lxvi-p17"></span>I now come to *John* and his companions.
They say that they *forbade* a man to *work miracles* Why did they not
first ask whether or not he was authorized? For now being in a state of
doubt and suspense, they ask the opinion of their Master. Hence it
follows, that they had rashly taken on themselves the right to *forbid*;
and therefore every man who undertakes more than he knows that he is
permitted to do by the word of God is chargeable with rashness. Besides,
there is reason to suspect the disciples of Christ of ambition, because
they are anxious to maintain their privilege and honor. For how comes it
that they all at once *forbid a* man who is unknown to them to work
miracles, but because they wish to be the sole possessors of this right?
For they assign the reason, that he *followeth not* Christ; as much as
to say, “He is not one of thy associates, as we are: why then shall he
possess equal honor?”

<span id="ii.lxvi-p18"></span><span id="ii.lxvi-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxvi-p19"></span>**39.** *Forbid him not.* Christ did not
wish that he should be *forbidden*; not that he had given him authority,
or approved of what he did, or even wished his disciples to approve of
it, but because, when by any occurrence God is glorified, we ought to
bear with it and rejoice. Thus Paul, (<span
id="ii.lxvi-p19.2"></span>[Php
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#018)<span id="ii.lxvi-p19.2"></span>,.md)
though he disapproves of the dispositions of those who used the Gospel
as a pretense for aggrandizing themselves, yet rejoices that by this
occurrence the glory of Christ is advanced. We must attend also to the
reason which is added, that *it is impossible for any man who works
miracles in the name of Christ to speak evil of Christ*, and therefore
this ought to be reckoned as gain; for hence it follows, that if the
disciples had not been more devoted to their own glory than anxious and
desirous to promote the glory of their Master, they would not have been
offended when they saw that glory heightened and enlarged in another
direction. And yet Christ declares that we ought to reckon as friends
those who are not open enemies.

<span id="ii.lxvi-p20"></span><span id="ii.lxvi-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxvi-p21"></span>**40.** *For he who is not against us is
for us.* He does not enjoin us to give a loose rein to rash men, and to
be silent while they intermeddle with this and the other matter,
according to their own fancy, and disturb the whole order of the Church:
for such licentiousness, so far as our calling allows, must be
restrained. He only affirms that they act improperly, who unseasonably
prevent the kingdom of God from being advanced by any means whatever.
And yet he does not acknowledge as his disciples, or reckon as belonging
to his flock, those who hold an intermediate place between enemies and
friends, but means that,. so far as they do no harm, they are useful and
profitable: for it is a proverbial saying, which reminds us that we
ought not to raise a quarrel till we are constrained.

<span id="ii.lxvi-p22"></span><span id="ii.lxvi-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxvi-p23"></span>**<span id="ii.lxvi-p23.2"></span>[Luke
9:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#051.md)<span
id="ii.lxvi-p23.2"></span>.** *While the days of his being received up,
etc.* <span id="ii.lxvi-p23.3"></span>Luke alone relates this narrative,
which, however, is highly useful on many accounts. For, first, it
describes the divine courage and firmness of Christ  <span
id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585.md) <span id="ii.lxvi-p24.2"></span>in
despising death; secondly, what deadly enmities are produced by
differences about religion; thirdly, with what headlong ardor the nature
of man is hurried on to impatience; next, how ready we are to fall into
mistakes in imitating the saints; and, lastly, by the example of Christ
we are called to the exercise of meekness. The death of Christ is called
his *being received up,* <span id="ii.lxvi-p24.3"></span>(<span
id="ii.lxvi-p24.4"></span>ἀνάληψις<span id="ii.lxvi-p24.5"></span>)
<span id="ii.lxvi-p24.6"></span>not only because he was then withdrawn
from the midst of us,  <span id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586.md) <span
id="ii.lxvi-p25.2"></span> but because, leaving the mean prison of the
flesh, he ascended on high.

<span id="ii.lxvi-p26"></span><span id="ii.lxvi-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxvi-p27"></span>**52.** *And he sent messengers.* It is
probable that our Lord was, at that time, attended by a great multitude
of followers; for the *messengers* were not *sent* to prepare a splendid
banquet, or to select some magnificent palace, but only to tell that a
vast number of guests were approaching. They again, when excluded and
repulsed, wait for their Master. Hence, too, we learn, what I remarked
in the second place,  <span id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587.md) that when
men differ among themselves about the doctrines of religion, they
readily break out into hatred of each other; for it was an evidence of
very bitter hatred to withhold food from the hungry, and lodging from
those who were fatigued. But the Samaritans have such a dislike and
enmity at the Jewish religion, that they look upon all who follow it as
unworthy of any kindness. Perhaps, too, they were tormented with
vexation at being despised; for they knew that their temple was detested
by the Jews as profane, and that they were considered to be spurious and
corrupt worshippers of God. But as the superstition once admitted kept
so firm a hold of them, they strove, with wicked emulation, to maintain
it to the last. At length the contention grew so hot, that it consumed
both nations in one conflagration; for Josephus assures us that it was
the torch which kindled the Jewish war. Now though Christ might easily
have avoided that dislike, he chooses rather to profess himself to be a
Jew, than by an indirect denial to procure a lodging.

<span id="ii.lxvi-p29"></span><span id="ii.lxvi-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxvi-p30"></span>**53.** *He steadfastly set his face.* By
this expression Luke has informed us that Christ, when he had death
before his eyes, rose above the fear of it, and went forward to meet it;
but, at the same time, points out that he had a struggle, and that,
having vanquished terror,  <span id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588.md) he
boldly presented himself to die. For if no dread, no difficulty, no
struggle, no anxiety, had been present to his mind, what need was there
that he should *set his face steadfastly?*  <span
id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589.md) But as he was neither devoid of
feeling, nor under the influence of foolish hardihood, he must have been
affected by the cruel and bitter death, or rather the shocking and
dreadful agony, which he knew would overtake him from the rigorous
judgment of God; and so far is this from obscuring or diminishing his
glory, that it is a remarkable proof of his unbounded love to us; for
laying aside a regard to himself that he might devote himself to our
salvation, through the midst of terrors he hastened to death, the time
of which he knew to be at hand.

<span id="ii.lxvi-p33"></span><span id="ii.lxvi-p33.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxvi-p34"></span>**54.** *And when His disciples James and
John saw it*. The country itself had perhaps suggested to them the
desire of thundering immediately against the ungodly; for it was there
that *Elijah* had formerly destroyed, by a fire from heaven, the king’s
soldiers who had been sent to apprehend him, (<span
id="ii.lxvi-p34.1"></span>[2Ki
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#010)<span id="ii.lxvi-p34.1"></span>..md)
It therefore occurred to them that the Samaritans, who so basely
rejected the Son of God, were at that time devoted to a similar
destruction. And here we see to what we are driven by a foolish
imitation  <span id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590.md) of the holy fathers.
*James and John* plead the example of *Elijah*, but they do not consider
how far they differ from *Elijah*; they do not examine properly their
own intemperate zeal, nor do they look at the calling of God. Under a
pretext equally plausible did the Samaritans cloak their idolatry, *our
fathers worshipped in this mountain*, (<span
id="ii.lxvi-p35.2"></span>[Joh
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#020)<span id="ii.lxvi-p35.2"></span>..md)
But both were in the wrong; for, neglecting the exercise of judgment,
they were apes rather than imitators of the holy fathers. Now though it
is doubtful whether they think that they have the power in their own
hand, or ask Christ to give it to them, I think it more probable that,
elated with foolish confidence, they entertain no doubt that they are
able to execute vengeance, provided that Christ give his consent.

<span id="ii.lxvi-p36"></span><span id="ii.lxvi-p36.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxvi-p37"></span>**55.** *You know not of what spirit you
are* By this reply he not only restrained the unbridled fury of the two
disciples, but laid down a rule to all of us not to indulge our temper.
For whoever undertakes any thing, ought to be fully aware that he has
the authority and guidance of the Spirit of God, and that he is actuated
by proper and holy dispositions. Many will be impelled by the warmth of
their zeal, but if the spirit of prudence be wanting, their ebullitions
end in foam. Frequently, too, it happens, that the impure feelings of
the flesh are mingled with their zeal, and that those who appear to be
the keenest zealots for the glory of God are blinded by the private
feelings of the flesh. And therefore, unless our zeal be directed by the
Spirit of God, it will be of no avail to plead in our behalf, that we
undertook nothing but from proper zeal. But the Spirit himself will
guide us by wisdom and prudence, that we may do nothing contrary to our
duty, or beyond our calling, nothing, in short, but what is prudent and
seasonable; and, by removing all the filth of the flesh, he may impart
to our minds proper feelings, that we may desire nothing but what God
shall suggest. Christ likewise blames his disciples because, though they
are widely distant from the *spirit of Elijah*,  <span
id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591.md) they rashly take upon themselves to do
what he did. For *Elijah* executed the judgment of God, which had been
committed to him by the Spirit; but they rush to vengeance, not by the
command of God, but by the movement of the flesh. And therefore the
examples of the saints are no defense to us, unless the same Spirit that
directed them dwell in us.
