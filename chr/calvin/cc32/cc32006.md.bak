*And after these things the Lord appointed* That the Apostles had
returned to Christ before these *seventy* were substituted in their
room, may be inferred from many circumstances. The twelve, therefore,
were sent to awaken in the Jews the hope of an approaching salvation.
After their return, as it was necessary that higher expectation should
be excited, others were sent in greater numbers, as secondary heralds,
to spread universally in every place the report of Christ’s coming.
Strictly speaking, they received no commission, but were only sent by
Christ as heralds, to prepare the minds of the people for receiving his
doctrine. As to the number *seventy,* he appears to have followed that
order to which the people had already been long accustomed. We must bear
in mind what has been already said about the *twelve* Apostles,  <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) that as this was the number of the tribes
when the people were in a flourishing condition, so an equal number of
apostles or patriarchs was chosen, to reassemble the members of the
lacerated body, that the restoration of the Church might thus be
complete.

<span id="ii.v-p9"></span><span id="ii.v-p9.1"></span>There was a
similar reason for these *seventy.* <span id="ii.v-p9.2"></span>We <span
id="ii.v-p9.3"></span>know that Moses, finding himself insufficient for
the burden, took *seventy* <span id="ii.v-p9.4"></span>judges to be
associated with him in governing the people, (<span
id="ii.v-p9.5"></span>[Exod. 18:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#022.md),
[Exod. 24:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.v-p9.5"></span><span id="ii.v-p9.6"></span>.) But when the Jews
returned from the Babylonish captivity, they had a council or <span
id="ii.v-p9.7"></span>συνέδριον<span id="ii.v-p9.8"></span>—which was
corrupted into *Sanedrin*  <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) <span
id="ii.v-p10.2"></span>—consisting <span id="ii.v-p10.3"></span>of
seventy-two judges. As usually happens with such numbers, when they
spoke of the council, they called them only the *seventy* <span
id="ii.v-p10.4"></span>judges; and Philo assures us, that they were
chosen out of the posterity of David, that there might be some remaining
authority in the royal line. After various calamities, this was the
finishing stroke, when Herod abolished that council, and thus deprived
the people of a legitimate share in the government. Now as the return
from Babylon prefigured a true and complete redemption, the reason why
our Lord chooses *seventy* <span id="ii.v-p10.5"></span>heralds of his
coming appears to be, to hold out the restoration of their fallen state;
and as the people were to be united under one head, he does not give
them authority as judges, but only commands them to go before him, that
he may possess the sole power. *And sent them by two and two. H*<span
id="ii.v-p10.6"></span>e appears to have done so on account of their
weakness. There was reason to fear, that individually they would not
have the boldness necessary for the vigorous discharge of their office;
and therefore, that they may encourage one another, they are sent *by
two and two*

<span id="ii.v-p11"></span><span id="ii.v-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v-p12"></span>**2.** *The harvest is indeed abundant.* I
have explained this passage under the ninth chapter of Matthew;  <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) but it was proper to insert it again in
this place, because it is related for a different purpose. In order to
stimulate his disciples the more powerfully to apply with diligence to
their work, he declares that *the harvest is abundant:* and hence it
follows, that their labor will not be fruitless, but that they will
find, in abundance, opportunities of employment, and means of
usefulness. He afterwards reminds them of dangers, contests, and
annoyances, and bids them go and prepare themselves for traversing with
speed the whole of Judea.  <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) In
short, he repeats the same injunctions which he had given to the
Apostles; and, therefore, it would serve no good purpose to trouble the
reader here with many words, since a full exposition of all these
matters may be found in the passage already quoted. We may notice
briefly, however, the meaning of that expression, *salute no man by the
way.* It indicates extreme haste, when, on meeting a person in *the
way,* we pass on without speaking to him, lest he should detain us even
for a short time. Thus, when Elisha sent his servant to the Shunamite
woman, he charged him not to salute any person whom he met:

<span id="ii.v-p15"></span>if thou meet any man, salute him not;  
and if any salute thee, answer not again, (<span
id="ii.v-p15.2"></span>[2Ki 4:31](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.v-p15.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.v-p16"></span>Christ does not intend that his disciples
shall be so unkind  <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) as not to deign
to salute persons whom they meet, but bids them hasten forward, so as to
pass by every thing that would detain them.

<span id="ii.v-p18"></span><span id="ii.v-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v-p19"></span>**7.** *Eating and drinking those things
which they shall give you* This is another circumstance expressly
mentioned by Luke. By these words Christ not only enjoins them to be
satisfied with ordinary and plain food, but allows them to eat at
another man’s table. Their plain and natural meaning is: “you will be at
liberty to live at the expense of others, so long as you shall be on
this journey; for it is proper that those for whose benefit you labor
should supply you with food.” Some think that they were intended to
remove scruples of conscience, that the disciples might not find fault
with any kind of food.  <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) But nothing
of this kind was intended, and it was not even his object to enjoin
frugality, but merely to permit them to accept of a reward, by living,
during this commission, at the expense of those by whom they were
entertained.
