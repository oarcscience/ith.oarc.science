bottom of the sea. **7**. Woe to the world on account of offenses! for

**8**. But if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut it off, and cast it
from thee;  <span id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) for it is better for
thee to enter lame or maimed into life, than that, having two hands or

enter into life having one eye, than that, having two eyes, thou
shouldst be cast into hell-fire. **10**. Beware of despising one of
these little ones; for I say to you, That their angels always behold the
face of my Father who is in heaven.

<span id="ii.lix-p8"></span> 

<span id="ii.lix-p9"></span> **42**. And whosoever shall offend one of
the little ones who believe in me, it were better for him that a
millstone were hung around his neck, and that he were thrown into the
sea. **43**. And if thy hand shall offend thee, cut it off; for it were
better for thee to enter lame into life, than that, having two hands,
thou shouldst go into hell, into the unquenchable fire:  <span

and their fire is not quenched. **45**. And if thy foot shall offend
thee, cut if off; for it were better for thee to enter lame into life,
than that, having two feet, thou shouldst be cast into hell, into the
unquenchable fire: **46**. Where their worm dieth not, and their fire is
not quenched. **47**. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out; for it
were better for thee to enter with one eye into the kingdom of God than
that, having two eyes, thou shouldst be cast into hell-fire:
**48**. Where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched.

<span id="ii.lix-p11"></span> 

<span id="ii.lix-p12"></span>**1**. And he said to his disciples, It is
impossible but that offenses will come; but woe to him by whom they
come! **2**. It were better for him that a millstone were hung around
his neck, and that he were thrown into the sea, than that he should
offend one of these little ones.

<span id="ii.lix-p16"></span>**<span id="ii.lix-p16.2"></span>[Matthew
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#006.md)<span id="ii.lix-p16.2"></span>.**
*But whosoever shall offend one of those little ones.* This appears to
be added for the consolation of the godly, that they may not be rendered
uneasy by their condition, if they are despised by the world. It is a
powerful obstruction to the voluntary exercise of modesty, when they
imagine, that by so doing they expose themselves to contempt; and it is
hard to be not only treated disdainfully, but almost trodden under foot,
by haughty men. Christ therefore encourages his disciples by the
consoling truth, that, if their mean condition draws upon them the
insults of the world, God does not despise them.

<span id="ii.lix-p17"></span>But he appears to have had likewise another
object in view; for a dispute had arisen amongst them as to the first
place of honor, from which it might naturally have been inferred that
the Apostles were tainted with sinful ambition. Every man who thinks too
highly of himself, or desires to be preferred to others, must
necessarily treat his brethren with disdain. To cure this disease,
Christ threatens a dreadful punishment, if any man in his pride shall
throw down those who are oppressed with poverty, or who in heart are
already humbled.

<span id="ii.lix-p18"></span>Under the word *offend* he includes more
than if he had forbidden them to *despise* their brethren; though the
man who gives himself no concern about *offending* the weak, does so for
no other reason, than because he does not render to them the honor to
which they are entitled. Now as there are various kinds of *offenses*,
it will be proper to explain generally what is meant by *offending* If
any man through our fault either stumbles, or is drawn aside from the
right course, or retarded in it, we are said to *offend* him.  <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) Whoever then desires to escape that
fearful punishment which Christ denounces, let him stretch out his hand
to the *little ones* who are despised by the world, and let him kindly
assist them in keeping the path of duty; for Christ recommends them to
our notice, that they may lead us to exercise voluntary humility; as
Paul enjoins the children of God to

<span id="ii.lix-p20"></span>condescend to men of low estate, (<span
id="ii.lix-p20.1"></span>[Ro
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#016)<span id="ii.lix-p20.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="ii.lix-p21"></span>and again says that

<span id="ii.lix-p22"></span>we ought not to please ourselves, (<span
id="ii.lix-p22.1"></span>[Ro 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.lix-p22.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.lix-p23"></span>To *hang a millstone about a* man’s *neck,
and drown him in the sea*, was the punishment then reckoned the most
appalling, and which was inflicted on the most atrocious malefactors.
When our Lord alludes to this punishment, we are enabled to perceive how
dear and precious those persons are in the sight of God, who are mean
and despised in the eyes of the world.

<span id="ii.lix-p24"></span><span id="ii.lix-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lix-p25"></span>**7.** *Woe to the world on account of
offenses!* This passage may be explained in two ways. It may be taken
*actively*, as meaning that Christ pronounces a curse on the authors of
*offenses;* and then by the term *world*, we must understand all
unbelievers. Or it may be taken *passively*, as meaning that Christ
deplores the evils which he perceives to be rapidly coming on *the world
on account of offenses;* as if he had said, that no plague will be more
destructive, or attended by more fearful calamities, than the alarm or
desertion of many *on account of offenses.* The latter meaning is more
appropriate; for I have no doubt that our Lord, who had spoken on
another occasion about offenses, proceeded to discourse more largely on
this subject; in order to make his disciples more attentive and watchful
in guarding against them. That Satan may not gain advantage over us
through our sluggishness, our Lord breaks out into an exclamation, that
there is nothing which we ought to dread more than *offenses;* for as
Satan has innumerable kinds of them in his hand, he constantly, and at
almost every step, throws new difficulties in our way; while we, through
excessive tenderness or sloth, are too ready to yield. The consequence
is, that there are few who make tolerable progress in the faith of
Christ; and of the few who have begun to walk in the way of salvation,
there is scarcely one in ten who has the courage to persevere till he
reaches the goal.  <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) Now since
Christ intended to strike his disciples with terror *on account of
offenses*, and thus to arouse them to exertion, *woe* to our
indifference, if each of us does not earnestly apply himself to overcome
those *offenses*

<span id="ii.lix-p27"></span>*For offenses must come.* To awaken more
powerfully their care and anxiety, our Lord reminds his disciples that
there is no possibility of walking but in the midst of various
*offenses;* as much as to say, that this is an evil which cannot be
avoided. Thus he confirms the former statement; for Christ shows us how
great are the inconveniences which arise from *offenses*, since the
Church never will be, and indeed never can be, free from this evil. But
he does not state the reason of this necessity, as Paul does, when,
speaking of heresies, he says that they arise, *that the good may be
made manifest*, (<span id="ii.lix-p27.1"></span>[1Co
11:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#019)<span id="ii.lix-p27.1"></span>..md)
It must be held by us as a fixed principle, that it is the will of God
to leave his people exposed to *offense*, in order to exercise their
faith, and to separate believers, as the refuse and the chaff, from the
pure wheat. Does any one object or complain, that blame attaches to our
Lord for giving loose reins to Satan, to accomplish the destruction of
wretched men? It is our duty to think and speak with the deepest
reverence of the secret purposes of God, of which this is one, that *the
world* must be disturbed by *offenses*

<span id="ii.lix-p28"></span>*But woe to the man by whom the offense
cometh.* After having exhorted his disciples to beware of *offenses*, he
again breaks out against those who occasion them. To impart the greater
vehemence to the threatening, he adds, that neither a *right eye* nor a
*right hand* ought to be spared, if they occasion *offense* to us; for I
explain these words as added for the purpose of amplification. Their
meaning is, that we ought to be so constant and so zealous in opposing
*offenses*, that we would rather choose to *pluck out our eyes, or cut
off our hands,* than give encouragement to *offenses;* for if any man
hesitate to incur the loss of his limbs, he spares them at the risk of
throwing himself into eternal perdition. What dreadful vengeance then
awaits those who by *offenses* shall bring ruin on their brethren!
 <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) As those two verses have been
already explained  <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) under <span
id="ii.lix-p30.2"></span>[Matt. 5:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029.md),
[30](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#030.md)<span id="ii.lix-p30.2"></span>, it
was sufficient, on the present occasion, to glance at the reason why
Christ repeats here the same statement.

<span id="ii.lix-p31"></span><span id="ii.lix-p31.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lix-p32"></span>**10.** *Beware of despising one of these
little ones* As pride is the mother of disdain, and as contempt hardens
men in giving *offense*, our Lord, for the purpose of applying an
appropriate remedy for curing this disease, forbids his disciples to
*despise the little ones.* And certainly, as we have already hinted, no
man who has a proper care for his brethren will ever allow himself, on
light grounds, to give them *offense* This conclusion of our Lord’s
discourse has the same tendency as the commencement of it, to remind us
that we ought to strive with each other who shall be most submissive and
modest; for God embraces with wonderful love the *little ones* It would
be strange indeed that a mortal man should *despise*, or treat as of no
account, those whom God holds in such high esteem. He proves this love
from the fact, that angels, who are ministers of their salvation, enjoy
intimately the presence of God. Yet I do not think that he intended
merely to show what honor God confers on them by appointing *angels* to
be their guardians, but likewise to threaten those who *despise* them;
as if he had said, that it is no light matter to *despise* those who
have *angels* for their companions and friends, to take vengeance in
their behalf. We ought therefore to *beware of despising* their
salvation, which even angels have been commissioned to advance.

<span id="ii.lix-p33"></span>The interpretation given to this passage by
some commentators, as if God assigned to each believer his own *angel*,
does not rest on solid grounds. For the words of Christ do not mean that
a single *angel* is continually occupied with this or the other person;
 <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) and such an idea is
inconsistent with the whole doctrine of Scripture, which declares that
*the* *angels encamp around* (<span id="ii.lix-p34.2"></span>[Ps
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007)<span id="ii.lix-p34.2"></span>.md)
the godly, and that not one *angel* only, but many, have been
commissioned to guard every one of the faithful. Away, then, with the
fanciful notion of a good and evil angel, and let us rest satisfied with
holding that the care of the whole Church is committed to *angels*, to
assist each member as his necessities shall require. It will perhaps be
asked, Do the angels occupy a station inferior to ours, because they
have been appointed to be our ministers? I reply, Though by nature they
take rank above us, this does not prevent them from rendering service to
God  <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) in dispensing the favor
which he freely bestows upon us. For this reason they are called *our
angels*, because their labors are bestowed on us.
