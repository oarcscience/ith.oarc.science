such be the case of the man with his wife,  <span
id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599.md) it is not expedient to enter into
marriage. **11**. Who said to them,  <span
id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600.md) All are not capable of receiving this
saying, but those to whom it is given. **12**. For there are eunuchs,
who were so born from their mother’s womb; and there are eunuchs, who
have been made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs, who have castrated
themselves for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who can receive it,
 <span id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601.md) let him receive it.

<span id="ii.lxviii-p7"></span> 

<span id="ii.lxviii-p8"></span><span id="ii.lxviii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxviii-p9"></span>**10.** *His disciples say to him.* <span
id="ii.lxviii-p9.1"></span>As if it were a hard condition for husbands
to be so bound to their wives, that, so long as they remain chaste, they
are compelled to endure every thing rather than leave them, the
disciples, roused by this answer of Christ, reply, that it is better to
want wives than to submit to a knot of this kind.  <span
id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602.md) <span id="ii.lxviii-p10.2"></span>But
why do they not, on the other hand, consider how hard is the bondage of
wives,  <span id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603.md) <span
id="ii.lxviii-p11.2"></span> but because, devoted to themselves and
their own convenience, they are driven by the feeling of the flesh to
disregard others, and to think only of what is advantageous for
themselves? Meanwhile, it is a display of base ingratitude that, from
the dread or dislike of a single inconvenience, they reject a wonderful
gift of God. It is better, according to them, to avoid marriage than to
bind one’s self by the bond of living always together.<span
id="ii.lxviii-p11.3"></span>  <span id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604.md)
<span id="ii.lxviii-p12.2"></span> But if God has ordained marriage for
the general advantage of mankind, though it may be attended by some
things that are disagreeable, it is not on that account to be despised.
Let us therefore learn not to be delicate and saucy, but to use with
reverence the gifts of God, even if there be something in them that does
not please us. Above all, let us guard against this wickedness in
reference to holy marriage; for, in consequence of its being attended by
many annoyances, Satan has always endeavored to make it an object of
hatred and detestation, in order to withdraw men from it. <span
id="ii.lxviii-p12.4"></span>And Jerome has given too manifest a proof of
a malicious and wicked disposition, in not only loading with calumnies
that sacred and divinely appointed condition of life, but in collecting
as many terms of reproach (<span
id="ii.lxviii-p12.5"></span>λοιδορίας<span id="ii.lxviii-p12.6"></span>)
<span id="ii.lxviii-p12.7"></span>as he could from profane authors, in
order to take away its respectability. But let us recollect that
whatever annoyances belong to marriage are accidental, for they arise
out of the depravity of man. Let us remember that, since our nature was
corrupted, marriage began to be a medicine, and therefore we need not
wonder if it have a bitter taste mixed with its sweetness. But we must
see how our Lord confutes this folly.

<span id="ii.lxviii-p13"></span><span id="ii.lxviii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxviii-p14"></span>**11.** *All are not capable of
receiving this saying.* By this he means, that the choice is not placed
in our hands, as if we were to deliberate on a matter submitted to us.
If any man thinks it advantageous for him to want a wife, and, without
making any inquiry, lays upon himself an obligation to celibacy,  <span
id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605.md) he is widely mistaken. God, who has
declared it to be good that a man should have a woman to be his helper,
will punish the contempt of his own appointment; for mortals take too
much on themselves, when they endeavor to exempt themselves from the
heavenly calling. But Christ proves that it is not free to all to make
what choice they please, because the gift of continence is a special
gift; for when he says *that all are not capable of receiving it, but
those to whom it is given*, he plainly shows that it was not given to
all. And this reproves the pride of those who do not hesitate to claim
for themselves what Christ so manifestly refuses to them.

<span id="ii.lxviii-p16"></span><span id="ii.lxviii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxviii-p17"></span>**12.** *For there are eunuchs* <span
id="ii.lxviii-p17.1"></span>Christ distinguishes three kinds of
*eunuchs* <span id="ii.lxviii-p17.2"></span>Those who are so by nature,
or who have been castrated by men, are debarred from marriage by this
defect, for they are not men. He says that there are other
*eunuchs*<span id="ii.lxviii-p17.3"></span>, <span
id="ii.lxviii-p17.4"></span>who have castrated themselves, that they may
be more at liberty to serve God; and these he exempts from the
obligation to marry. Hence it follows, that all others who avoid
marriage fight against God with sacrilegious hardihood, after the manner
of the giants. When Papists urge the word *castrate*<span
id="ii.lxviii-p17.5"></span>, <span id="ii.lxviii-p17.6"></span>(<span
id="ii.lxviii-p17.7"></span>εὐνοῦχισαν<span
id="ii.lxviii-p17.8"></span>) as if at their own pleasure men might lay
themselves under obligation to continence, it is too frivolous. For
Christ has already declared, that God gives it to whom he chooses; and,
a little afterwards, we shall find him maintaining, that it is folly in
any man to choose to live unmarried, when he has not received this
special gift. This castration, therefore, is not left to free will; but
the plain meaning is, while some men are by nature fit to marry, though
they abstain, they do not tempt God, because God grants them exemption.
 <span id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606.md)

<span id="ii.lxviii-p19"></span>*For the sake of the kingdom of heaven.*
Many foolishly explain this as meaning, *in order to deserve eternal
life;* as if celibacy contained within itself some meritorious service,
as the Papists imagine that it is an angelical state. But Christ meant
nothing more than that persons unmarried ought to have this for their
object, that, being freed from all cares, they may apply themselves more
readily to the duties of piety. It is, therefore, a foolish imagination,
that celibacy is a virtue; for it is not in itself more pleasing to God
than fasting, and is not entitled to be reckoned among the duties which
he requires from us, but ought to have a reference to another object.
Nay more, Christ expressly intended to declare that, though a man be
pure from fornication, yet his celibacy is not approved by God, if he
only consults his own ease and comfort, but that he is excused on this
single ground, that he aims at a free and unrestrained meditation on the
heavenly life. In short, Christ teaches us, that it is not enough, if
unmarried men live chastely, unless they abstain from having wives, for
the express purpose of devoting themselves to better employments.  <span
id="fr_607"></span>[608](#fn_607.md)

<span id="ii.lxviii-p21"></span>*He that can receive it, let him receive
it.* By this conclusion Christ warns them, that the use of marriage is
not to be despised, unless we intend, with blind rashness, to rush
headlong to destruction: for it became necessary to restrain the
disciples, whom he saw acting inconsiderately and without judgment. But
the warning is useful to all; for, in selecting a manner of life, few
consider what has been given to them, but men rush forward, without
discrimination, in whatever direction inconsiderate zeal prompts them.
And I wish that the warning had been attended to in past times; but
men’s ears are stopped by I know not what enchantments of Satan, so
that, contrary to nature, and, at it were, in spite of God, those whom
God called to marriage have bound themselves by the cord of *perpetual
virginity*  <span id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608.md) Next came the deadly
cord of a vow, by which wretched souls were bound,  <span
id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609.md) so that they never rose out of the
ditch.
