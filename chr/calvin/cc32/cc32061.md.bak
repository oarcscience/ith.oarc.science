<span id="ii.lx-p4"></span> **11**. For the Son of man is come to save
that which was lost. **12**. What think you? If a man shall have a
hundred sheep, and one of them shall go astray, doth he not leave the
ninety-nine, and go to the mountains, and seek that which had gone
astray? **13**. And if he happen to find it, verily, I say to you, he
rejoiceth more on account of that sheep than on account of the
ninety-nine which had gone astray. **14**. So it is not the will of your
Father who is in heaven, that one of those little ones should perish.

<span id="ii.lx-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.lx-p6"></span>**1**. And all the publicans and sinners drew
near to him to hear him. **2**. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured,
saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. **3**. And he
spoke to them a parable, saying, **4**. What man is there among you, who
hath a hundred sheep, and, if he shall lose one of them, doth not leave
the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after that which was lost,
till he find it? **5**. And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his
shoulders, rejoicing: **6**. And coming home, he calleth his friends and
neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me; for I have found the sheep
which was lost. **7**. I say to you, that in like manner there will be
greater joy in heaven over one repenting sinner, than over ninety-nine
righteous persons who do not need repentance. **8**. Or what woman
having ten pieces of money,  <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) if
she shall lose one piece, doth no light a candle, and sweep the house,
and seek diligently until she find it? **9**. And when she hath found
it, she calleth together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with
me, for I have found the piece which I had lost. **10**. In like manner,
I tell you, there will be joy in the presence of the angels of God over
one repenting sinner.

18:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#011.md)<span id="ii.lx-p10.2"></span>.**
*For the Son of man cometh* Christ now employs his own example in
persuading his disciples to honor even weak and despised brethren; for
he came down from heaven to save not them only, but even the dead who
were *lost* It is in the highest degree unreasonable that we should
disdainfully reject those whom the Son of God has so highly esteemed.
And even if the weak labor under imperfections which may expose them to
contempt, our pride is not on that account to be excused; for we ought
to esteem them not for the value of their virtues, but for the sake of
Christ; and he who will not conform himself to Christ’s example is too
saucy and proud.

<span id="ii.lx-p11"></span><span id="ii.lx-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lx-p12"></span>**12.** *What think you?* Luke carries the
occasion of this parable still farther back, as having arisen from the
*murmurings* of the *Pharisees and scribes* against our Lord, whom they
saw conversing daily with sinners. Christ therefore intended to show
that a good teacher ought not to labor less to recover those that are
*lost*, than to preserve those which are in his possession; though
according to Matthew the comparison proceeds farther, and teaches us not
only that we ought to treat with kindness the disciples of Christ, but
that we ought to bear with their imperfections, and endeavor, when they
wander, to bring them back to the road. For, though they happen
sometimes to wander, yet as they are *sheep* over which God has
appointed his Son to be shepherd, so far are we from having a right to
chase or drive them away roughly, that we ought to gather them from
their wanderings; for the object of the discourse is to lead us to
beware of *losing* what God wishes to be *saved* The narrative of Luke
presents to us a somewhat different object. It is, that the whole human
race belongs to God, and that therefore we ought to gather those that
have gone astray, and that we ought to rejoice as much, when they that
are *lost* return to the path of duty, as a man would do who, beyond his
expectation, recovered something the loss of which had grieved him.

<span id="ii.lx-p13"></span><span id="ii.lx-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lx-p14"></span>**<span id="ii.lx-p14.2"></span>[Luke
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk015.htm#010.md)<span id="ii.lx-p14.2"></span>.**
*There will be joy in the presence of the angels.* If *angels* mutually
rejoice with each other in heaven, when they see that what had wandered
is restored to the fold, we too, who have the same cause in common with
them, ought to be partakers of the same *joy* But. how does he say that
the *repentance* of one ungodly man yields greater joy than the
perseverance of many *righteous* men to *angels*, whose highest delight
is in a continued and uninterrupted course of *righteousness*? I reply,
though it would be more agreeable to the wishes of *angels* (as it is
also more desirable) that men should always remain in perfect integrity,
yet as in the deliverance of a sinner, who had been already devoted to
destruction, and had been cut off as a rotten member from the body, the
mercy of God shines more brightly, he attributes to *angels*, after the
manner of men, a *greater joy* arising out of an unexpected good.

<span id="ii.lx-p15"></span>*Over one repenting sinner.* The word
*repentance* is specially limited to the conversion of those who, having
altogether turned aside from God, rise as it were from death to life;
for otherwise the exercise of repentance ought to be uninterrupted
throughout our whole life,  <span id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) and
no man is exempted from this necessity, since every one is reminded by
his imperfections that he ought to aim at daily progress. But it is one
thing, when a man, who has already entered upon the right course, though
he stumble, or fall, or even go astray, endeavors to reach the goal; and
another thing, when a man leaves a road which was entirely wrong, or
only starts in the right course.  <span
id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) Those who have already begun to
regulate their life by the standard of the divine law, do not need that
kind of *repentance* which consists in beginning to lead a holy and
pious life, though they must groan  <span
id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) under the infirmities of the flesh,
and labor to correct them.
