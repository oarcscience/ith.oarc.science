<span id="ii.xxxviii-p3"></span> **11**. And it happened, while he was
going to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and of
Galilee. **12**. And as he was entering into a certain village, there
met him ten men, lepers, who stood at a distance; **13**. And, lifting
up their voice, said, Jesus, Master, take pity on us. **14**. When he
saw them, he said, Go, show yourselves to the priests. And it happened
that, while they were going, they were cleansed. **15**. And one of
them, when he saw that he was cleansed, turned back, glorifying God with
a loud voice, **16**. And fell on his face  <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) at his feet, thanking him: and he was
a Samaritan. **17**. And Jesus answering said, Were not ten cleansed?
But where are the nine? **18**. None are found that have returned to
give glory to God except this stranger. **19**. And he saith to him,
Arise, go, thy faith hath saved thee.  <span
id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md) **20**. And being interrogated by the
Pharisees, when the kingdom of God would come, he replied to them and
said, The kingdom of God will not come with observation;  <span
id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) **21**. For they shall not say, Lo, he
is here! or, Lo, he is there! for, lo, the kingdom of God is within you.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p7"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p8"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p9"></span>As, on a former occasion, Matthew and
the other two Evangelists (<span id="ii.xxxviii-p9.1"></span>[Mt
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#001.md)<span id="ii.xxxviii-p9.1"></span>;
<span id="ii.xxxviii-p9.2"></span>[Mr
1:40](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#040.md)<span
id="ii.xxxviii-p9.2"></span>; <span id="ii.xxxviii-p9.3"></span>[Lu
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.xxxviii-p9.3"></span>) related that *a leper* had been *cleansed*
by Christ, so Luke mentions that the same miracle of healing was
performed on *ten lepers* The object of this narrative, however, is
different; for it describes the base and incredible ingratitude of the
Jewish nation, to prevent us from wondering that so many of Christ’s
favors had been suppressed, and so many of his wonderful works buried,
among them. One circumstance, too, is added, which greatly heightens the
infamy of their crime. Our Lord had *cured nine Jews:* yet not one of
them returned thanks, but, with the view of obliterating the remembrance
of their disease, they privately stole away. One man only—a
Samaritan—acknowledged his obligation to Christ. There is, therefore, on
the one hand, a display of Christ’s divine power; and, on the other
hand, a reproof of the impiety of the Jews, in consequence of which so
remarkable a miracle as this received scarcely any attention.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p10"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p11"></span>**13.** *Jesus, Master*  <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) It is evident that all of them
possessed some measure of faith, not only because they implore Christ’s
assistance, but because they honor him with the title of *Master* That
they made use of that expression sincerely, and not in hypocrisy, may be
inferred from their ready obedience; for, although they perceive that
the filthy scab still remains in their flesh, yet as soon as they are
commanded to *show themselves to the priests,* they do not refuse to
obey. Add to this that, but for the influence of faith, they would never
have set out to *show themselves to the priests;* for it would have been
absurd to present themselves to the judges of leprosy, for the purpose
of attesting that they had been cleansed, if the promise of Christ had
been regarded by them as of no more value than a mere inspection of the
disease. They bear a visible leprosy in their flesh; and yet, trusting
to Christ’s word alone, they have no scruple about declaring that they
are clean. It cannot therefore be denied, that some seed of faith had
been implanted in their hearts. Now though it is certain that they were
not regenerated by the Spirit of adoption, yet there is no absurdity in
supposing that they had some beginnings of piety. There is the greater
reason to fear that sparks of faith, which make their appearance in us,
may be extinguished; for, although lively faith, which has its roots
deeply fixed by the Spirit of regeneration, never dies, yet we have seen
formerly that many conceive a temporary faith, which immediately
disappears. Above all, it is too common a disease that, when we are
urged by strong necessity, and when the Lord himself prompts us by a
secret movement of the Spirit, we seek God, but, when we have obtained
our wishes, ungrateful forgetfulness swallows up that feeling of piety.
Thus poverty and hunger beget faith, but abundance kills it.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p13"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p14"></span>**14.** *Show yourselves to the
priests* This reply was equivalent to saying, “You are clean;” for we
know that the discernment of leprosy belonged *to the priests,* who were
enjoined in the law to distinguish between the clean and the unclean,
(<span id="ii.xxxviii-p14.1"></span>[Le
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.xxxviii-p14.1"></span>.) Thus Christ preserves their right
entire, and appeals to them as witnesses for approving of the miracle
which he had wrought; and we have accordingly said, that pious and
devout sentiments concerning Christ must have been entertained by those
men who were instantly led, by his bare word, to entertain the hope of a
cure.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p15"></span>On this passage the Papists absurdly
build their *auricular* confession. The lepers, I admit, were sent by
Christ to the priests; but it was not for the purpose of vomiting out
their sins into their ears. On the contrary, they were sent to offer a
sacrifice, as the Law had enjoined. They were not sent to cleanse
themselves, as the Papists imagine that cleanness is produced by
confession, but to *show to the priests* that they were already clean.
It is an additional proof of the folly of the Papists, that they do not
consider what a foul stain of infamy they throw on their confession;
for, according to their reasoning, it will be quite enough if, out of
the whole troop of those who have gone *to the priests,* a tenth part
only shall return to Christ, and all the rest shall wickedly revolt.
They cannot plead this passage in behalf of their confession, without
giving us liberty to throw back upon them this advantage which it
yields, that none return from the priests *to give glory to God.* But,
not to dwell on these fooleries, we have ascertained the reason why *the
priests* were mentioned.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p16"></span>*It happened that, while they were
going, they were cleansed.* Here was displayed the divine power of
Christ and of his words, and there was also a proof of the high
estimation in which God holds the obedience of faith; for the great
suddenness of the cure arose from the confident hope which induced them
to undertake the journey, without hesitation, at the command of Christ.
But if that transitory faith—which wanted a living root, and produced
nothing more than the blade—was honored by God with a remarkable effect,
how much more valuable is the reward that awaits our faith, if it is
sincerely and permanently fixed on God? Though the *nine lepers* derived
no advantage to salvation from the cure of the flesh, but only obtained
a temporary gift by means of a fleeting and transitory faith, yet this
figure points out to us the great efficacy which will attend true faith.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p17"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p18"></span>**15.** *And one of them, etc.* It is
uncertain if he returned when they were halfway, and Luke’s words appear
to imply this; but I think it more probable, that it was not till he had
heard the decision of the priests that he returned to give thanks. He
must have obtained permission from the priests to return to the ordinary
intercourse of life; and he had no right to neglect the command of
Christ, and to defraud the temple of God of a sacrifice. Some will
perhaps be better pleased with a different conjecture, that as soon as
he saw that he was cleansed, and before he applied to the priests for a
testimony, he was seized with a devout and holy zeal, and returned to
the Author of the cure, so as to commence his sacrifice with
thanksgiving. The words of Christ contain an expostulation with the
whole nation; for it is by way of reproach that he draws a comparison
between one stranger and many Jews, because it was customary with them
to swallow up God’s favors without any feeling of piety. And this was
the reason why Christ gained hardly any reputation among them by
miracles so numerous and so splendid. Let us learn that this complaint
is brought generally against all of us, if we do not at least repay the
divine favors by the duty of gratitude.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p19"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p20"></span>**19.** *Thy faith hath saved thee.*
The word *save* is restricted by some commentators to the cleanness of
the flesh.  <span id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) But if this be the
case, since Christ commends the lively faith of this Samaritan, it may
be asked, how were the other nine *saved?* for all of them without
exception obtained the same cure.  <span
id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) We must therefore arrive at the
conclusion, that Christ has here pronounced a different estimate of the
gift of God from that which is usually pronounced by ungodly men;
namely, that it was a token or pledge of God’s fatherly love. The *nine
lepers were cured;* but as they wickedly efface the remembrance of the
grace of God, the cure itself is debased and contaminated by their
ingratitude, so that they do not derive from it the advantage which they
ought. It is faith alone that sanctifies the gifts of God to us, so that
they become pure, and, united to the lawful use of them, contribute to
our salvation. Lastly, by this word Christ has informed us in what
manner we lawfully enjoy divine favors. Hence we infer, that he included
the eternal salvation of the soul along with the temporal gift. The
*Samaritan* was *saved* by his *faith* How? Certainly not because he was
cured of leprosy, (for this was likewise obtained by the rest,) but
because he was admitted into the number of the children of God, and
received from His hand a pledge of fatherly kindness.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p23"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p24"></span>**20.** *And being interrogated by the
Pharisees* This question was undoubtedly put in mockery; for, since
Christ was continually speaking of the kingdom of God as at hand, while
no change was taking place in the outward condition of the Jews, wicked
and malicious persons looked upon this as a plausible excuse for
harassing him. As if all that Christ said about the kingdom of God were
idle talk and mere trifling, they put a sarcastic question to him, “When
shall that kingdom come?” If any one shall consider this question to
have been put on account of the grossness of their own views, rather
than for the sake of jeering, I have no objection.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p25"></span>*The kingdom of God will not come with
observation.* My opinion is, that Christ now disregards those dogs, and
accommodates this reply to the disciples; just as on many other
occasions, when he was provoked by wicked men, and seized the
opportunity of giving instruction. In this manner God disappoints their
malice, while the truth, which is maintained in opposition to their
sophistry, is the more fully displayed.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p26"></span>The word *observation* is here employed
by Christ to denote extraordinary splendor;  <span
id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md) and he declares, that the kingdom of
God will not make its appearance at a distance, or attended by pompous
display. He means, that they are greatly mistaken who seek with the eyes
of the flesh *the kingdom of God,* which is in no respect carnal or
earthly, for it is nothing else than the inward and spiritual renewal of
the soul. From the nature of the kingdom itself he shows that they are
altogether in the wrong, who look around *here* or *there,* in order to
observe visible marks. “That restoration of the Church,” he tells us,
“which God has promised, must be looked for *within;* for, by quickening
his elect into a heavenly newness of life, he establishes his kingdom
*within them.”* And thus he indirectly reproves the stupidity of the
Pharisees, because they aimed at nothing but what was earthly and
fading. It must be observed, however, that Christ speaks only of the
beginnings of the kingdom of God; for we now begin to be formed anew by
the Spirit after the image of God, in order that our entire renovation,
and that of the whole world, may afterwards follow in due time.
