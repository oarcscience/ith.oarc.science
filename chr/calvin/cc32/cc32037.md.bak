<span id="ii.xxxvi-p3"></span>**1**. And he spake also a parable to
them, that they ought always to pray, and not to grow weary:
**2**. Saying, There was a judge in a city, who neither feared God, nor
regarded man. **3**. And there was a widow in that city, who came to
him, saying, Do me justice on my adversary. **4**. And he refused for
some time,  <span id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md) but afterwards said
within himself, Though I neither fear God, nor regard man, **5**. Yet
because this widow is troublesome to me,  <span
id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) I will do her justice, lest by coming
perpetually she weary me out.  <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md)
**6**. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. **7**. And
will not God avenge his elect, who cry to him night and day, even though
he forbear with respect to them?  <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) **8**. I tell you that he will
speedily avenge them. But when the Son of man shall come, will he find
faith on the earth?  <span id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md)

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p9"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p10"></span><span id="ii.xxxvi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p11"></span>We know that perseverance in prayer is a
rare and difficult attainment; and it is a manifestation of our unbelief
that, when our first prayers are not successful, we immediately throw
away not only hope, but all the ardor of prayer. But it is an undoubted
evidence of our Faith, if we are disappointed of our wish, and yet do
not lose courage. Most properly, therefore, does Christ recommend to his
disciples to persevere in praying.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p12"></span>The *parable* which he employs, though
apparently harsh, was admirably fitted to instruct his disciples, that
they ought to be importunate in their prayers to God the Father, till
they at length draw from him what He would otherwise appear to be
unwilling to give. Not that by our prayers we gain a victory over God,
and bend him slowly and reluctantly to compassion, but because the
actual facts do not all at once make it evident that he graciously
listens to our prayers. In the *parable* Christ describes to us a
*widow,* who obtained what she wanted from an unjust and cruel *judge,*
because she did not cease to make earnest demands. The leading truth
conveyed is, that God does not all at once grant assistance to his
people, because he chooses to be, as it were, wearied out by prayers;
and that, however wretched and despicable may be the condition of those
who pray to him, yet if they do not desist from the uninterrupted
exercise of prayer, he will at length regard them and relieve their
necessities.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p13"></span>The parties between whom the comparison
is drawn are, indeed, by no means equal; for there is a wide difference
between a wicked and cruel man and God, who is naturally inclined to
mercy. But Christ intended to assure believers that they have no reason
to fear lest their persevering entreaties to the Father of mercy should
be refused, since by importunate supplication they prevail on men who
are given to cruelty. The wicked and iron-hearted *judge* could not
avoid yielding at length, though reluctantly, to the earnest
solicitations of the widow: how then shall the prayers of believers,
when perseveringly maintained, be without effect? If exhaustion and
weakness are felt by us when we give way after a slight exertion, or if
the ardor of prayer languishes because God appears to lend a deaf ear,
let us rest assured of our ultimate success, though it may not be
immediately apparent. Entertaining this conviction, let us contend
against our impatience, so that the long delay may not induce us to
discontinue our prayers.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p14"></span><span id="ii.xxxvi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p15"></span>**7.** *And shall not God avenge his
elect?* That *judge,* whom Christ has described to us as altogether
desperate, as not only hardened against the contemplation of God, but so
entirely devoid of shame, that he had no anxiety about his reputation,
at length opened his eyes to the distresses of the *widow* We have no
reason to doubt that believers will derive, at least, equal advantage
from their prayers, provided they do not cease to plead earnestly with
God. Yet it must be observed that, while Christ applies the parable to
his subject, he does not make God to resemble a wicked and cruel
*judge,* but points out a very different reason why those who believe in
him are kept long in suspense, and why he does not actually and at once
stretch out his hand to them: it is because he *forbears* If at any time
God winks at the injuries done to us longer than we would wish, let us
know that this is done with a fatherly intention—to train us to
patience. A temporary overlooking of crimes is very different from
allowing them to remain for ever unpunished. The promise which he makes,
that *God will speedily avenge them,* must be referred to his
providence; for our hasty tempers and carnal apprehension lead us to
conclude that he does not come quickly enough to grant relief. But if we
could penetrate into his design, we would learn that his assistance is
always ready and seasonable, as the case demands, and is not delayed for
a single moment, but comes at the exact time.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p16"></span>But it is asked, How does Christ instruct
his disciples to seek vengeance, while he exhorts them on another
occasion, *pray for those who injure and persecute you,* (<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p16.1"></span>[Mt
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md)<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p16.1"></span>.) I reply: what Christ says here about
vengeance does not at all interfere with his former doctrine. God
declares that he will avenge believers, not for the purpose of giving a
loose rein to their carnal affections, but in order to convince them
that their salvation is dear and precious in his sight, and in this
manner to induce them to rely on his protection. If, laying aside
hatred, pure and free from every wicked desire of revenge, and
influenced by proper and well-regulated dispositions, they implore
divine assistance, it will be a lawful and holy wish, and God himself
will listen to it. But as nothing is more difficult than to divest
ourselves of sinful affections, if we would offer pure and sincere
prayers, we must ask the Lord to guide and direct our hearts by his
Spirit. Then shall we lawfully call on God to be our avenger, and he
will answer our prayers.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p17"></span><span id="ii.xxxvi-p17.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p18"></span>**8.** *When the Son of man shall come.*
By these words Christ informs us that there will be no reason to wonder
if men shall afterwards sink under their calamities: it will be because
they neglect the true remedy. He intended to obviate an offense which we
are daily apt to take, when we see all things in shameful confusion.
Treachery, cruelty, imposture, deceit, and violence, abound on every
hand; there is no regard to justice, and no shame; the poor groan under
their oppressors; the innocent are abused or insulted; while God appears
to be asleep in heaven. This is the reason why the flesh imagines that
the government of fortune is blind. But Christ here reminds us that men
are justly deprived of heavenly aid, on which they have neither
knowledge nor inclination to place reliance. They who do nothing but
murmur against the Lord in their hearts, and who allow no place for his
providence, cannot reasonably expect that the Lord will assist them.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p19"></span>*Shall he find faith on the earth?*
Christ expressly foretells that, from his ascension to heaven till his
return, unbelievers will abound; meaning by these words that, if the
Redeemer does not so speedily appear, the blame of the delay will attach
to men, because there will be almost none to look for him. Would that we
did not behold so manifest a fulfillment of this prediction! But
experience proves that though the world is oppressed and overwhelmed by
a huge mass of calamities, there are few indeed in whom the least spark
of *faith* can be discerned. Others understand the word *faith* to
denote uprightness, but the former meaning is more agreeable to the
context.
