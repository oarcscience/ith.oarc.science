<span id="ii.xxvi-p3"></span>**1**. And at that time some were present,
who told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their
sacrifices. **2**. And Jesus answering said to them, Do you imagine that
these Galileans were sinners beyond all the Galileans, because they
suffered such things? **3**. I tell you, no; but unless you repent, you
will all perish in like manner. **4**. Or those eighteen, on whom the
tower in Siloah fell and slew them, do you imagine that they were
debtors beyond all men that dwell in Jerusalem?  <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) **5**. I tell you, no; but unless you
repent, you shall all perish in like manner. **6**. And he spake this
parable: A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and came
seeking fruit on it, and did not find it. **7**. And he said to the
vine-dresser, Lo, there are three years that I come seeking fruit on
this fig-tree, and find none: cut it down; why does it even occupy the
ground?  <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) **8**. But he
answering, said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall
dig about it, and dung it: **9**. And if it bear fruit:  <span
id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) but if not, afterwards thou shalt cut
it down.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p7"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxvi-p8"></span><span id="ii.xxvi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxvi-p9"></span>**2.** *Do you imagine? etc.* This passage
is highly useful, were it for no other reason than that this disease is
almost natural to us, to be too rigorous and severe in judging of
others, and too much disposed to flatter our own faults. The consequence
is, that we not only censure with excessive severity the offenses of our
brethren; but whenever they meet with any calamity, we condemn them as
wicked and reprobate persons. On the other hand, every man that is not
sorely pressed by the hand of God slumbers at ease in the midst of his
sins, as if God were favorable and reconciled to him. This involves a
double fault; for when God chastises any one before our eyes, he warns
us of his judgments, that each of us may examine himself, and consider
what he deserves. If he spares us for a time, we are so far from having
a right to take such kindness and forbearance as an opportunity for
slumber, that we ought to regard it as an invitation to repentance.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p10"></span>To correct the false and cruel judgment
which we are accustomed to pass on wretched sufferers, and, at the same
time, to shake off the indulgence which every man cherishes towards
himself, he shows, first, that those who are treated with severity are
not the most wicked of all men; because God administers his judgments in
such a manner, that some are instantly seized and punished, and others
are permitted to remain long in the enjoyment of ease and luxury,
Secondly, he declares that all the calamities which happen in the world
are so many demonstrations of the wrath of God; and hence we learn what
an awful destruction awaits us,  <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md)
if we do not avert it.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p12"></span>The immediate occasion for this
exhortation was, that *some told him that Pilate had mingled human blood
with sacrifices,* in order that so shocking an event might bring
*sacrifices* into abhorrence. As it is probable that this outrage was
committed on the Samaritans, who had departed from the pure service of
the Law, the Jews would easily and readily be disposed to condemn the
Samaritans, and by so doing to applaud themselves. But our Lord applies
it to a different purpose. As that whole nation was hated and detested
by them on account of ungodliness, he puts the question, “Do you imagine
that those wretched persons, who have been put to death by Pilate, were
worse than others? You are perfectly aware, that that country is full of
ungodly men, and that many who deserved the same punishment are still
alive. He is a blind and wicked judge who decides as to the sins of all
men by the punishments which they now endure. It is not always the most
wicked man who is first dragged to punishment; but when God selects a
few out of a large number to be punished, he holds out in their person a
threatening that he will take vengeance on the remainder, in order that
all may be alarmed.”

<span id="ii.xxvi-p13"></span>Having spoken of the Samaritans, he now
approaches more closely to the Jews themselves*. Eighteen men* had at
that time been killed by the fall of a *tower* in Jerusalem. He declares
that those men were not more wicked than others, but that their death
was held out to all as a ground of alarm; for if in them God gave a
display of his judgment, no more would others, though they might be
spared for a time, escape his hand. Christ does not, however, forbid
believers to consider attentively the judgments of God, but enjoins them
to observe this order, to begin with their own sins. They will thus
obtain the highest advantage; for they will avert God’s chastisements by
voluntary repentance. To the same purpose is the warning which Paul
gives,

<span id="ii.xxvi-p14"></span>Let no man deceive you with vain words;
for on account of these things the wrath of God cometh against the
rebellious,  
(<span id="ii.xxvi-p14.2"></span>[Eph
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006)<span id="ii.xxvi-p14.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xxvi-p15"></span><span id="ii.xxvi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxvi-p16"></span>**6.** *He spoke also this parable.* The
substance of it is, that many are endured for a time who deserve to be
cut off; but that they gain nothing by the delay, if they persist in
their obstinacy. The wicked flattery, by which hypocrites are hardened,
and become more obstinate, arises from this cause, that they do not
think of their sins till they are compelled; and, therefore, so long as
God winks at these, and delays his chastisements, they imagine that he
is well satisfied with them. Thus they indulge themselves more freely,
as if, to use the words of Isaiah, (<span id="ii.xxvi-p16.1"></span>[Isa
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.xxvi-p16.1"></span>,) they *had made a covenant with death, and
were in friendship with the grave.* And this is the reason why Paul
denounces them in such earnestness of language for

<span id="ii.xxvi-p17"></span>treasuring up to themselves the wrath of
God against the last day,  
(<span id="ii.xxvi-p17.2"></span>[Ro
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#005)<span id="ii.xxvi-p17.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xxvi-p18"></span>It is well known that trees are sometimes
preserved, not because their owners find them to be useful and
productive, but because the careful and industrious husbandman makes
every possible trial and experiment before he determines to remove them
out of the field or vineyard. This teaches us that, when the Lord does
not immediately take vengeance on the reprobate, but delays to punish
them, there are the best reasons for his forbearance. Such
considerations serve to restrain human rashness, that no man may dare to
murmur against the supreme Judge of all, if He does not always execute
his judgments in one uniform manner. A comparison is here drawn between
the *owner* and the *vine-dresser:* not that God’s ministers go beyond
him in gentleness and forbearance, but because the Lord not only
prolongs the life of sinners, but likewise cultivates them in a variety
of ways, that they may yield better fruit.
