<span id="ii.xxix-p1"></span><span id="ii.xxix-p1.1"></span>[Luke
11:37-41](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#037.md)<span

<span id="ii.xxix-p2"></span><span id="ii.xxix-p2.1"></span>[Luke

<span id="ii.xxix-p3"></span> **37**. And while he was speaking, a
certain Pharisee requested him to dine with him; and he entered and sat
down at table. **38**. And when the Pharisee saw it, he wondered that he
had not first washed before dinner. **39**. And the Lord said to him,
Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate; and
what is within you is full of cruelty and wickedness. **40**. Fools, did
not he who made what is without make also what is within? **41**. But
out of what you have  <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) give alms;
and, lo, all things are clean to you.

<span id="ii.xxix-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxix-p6"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxix-p7"></span><span id="ii.xxix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxix-p8"></span>This narrative agrees in some respects, but
not entirely, with the doctrine laid down by Matthew, (<span
id="ii.xxix-p8.1"></span>[Mt
10:1-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.xxix-p8.1"></span>,) that Christ, in order to correct the
superstition of the people, and particularly of the scribes,
intentionally disregarded outward ceremonies of human invention, which
the Jews were too solicitous to observe. God had prescribed in his Law
certain kinds of *washings,* that by means of them he might train his
people usefully to the consideration of true purity. The Jews, not
satisfied with this moderate portion had added many other washings, and
more especially, that no person should partake of food till he had been
washed with the water of purification, as Mark relates more minutely,
(<span id="ii.xxix-p8.2"></span>[Mark
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#004)<span id="ii.xxix-p8.2"></span>,.md)
and as is also evident from John, (<span id="ii.xxix-p8.3"></span>[Joh
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#006)<span id="ii.xxix-p8.3"></span>..md)
This fault was accompanied by wicked confidence; for they cared little
about the spiritual worship of God, and thought that they had perfectly
discharged their duty, when the figure was substituted in the place of
God. Christ is fully aware that his neglect of this ceremony will give
offense, but he declines to observe it, in order to show that God sets
very little value on outward cleanness, but demands the spiritual
righteousness of the heart.

<span id="ii.xxix-p9"></span><span id="ii.xxix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxix-p10"></span>**39.** *Now you Pharisees* Christ does
not here charge the *Pharisees,* as in Matthew, (<span
id="ii.xxix-p10.1"></span>[Mt
15:1-20](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.xxix-p10.1"></span>,) and Mark, (<span
id="ii.xxix-p10.2"></span>[Mr
12:2-13](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.xxix-p10.2"></span>,) with serving God in an improper manner by
human inventions, and breaking the law of God for the sake of their
traditions; but merely glances at their hypocrisy, in having no desire
of purity except before the eyes of men, as if they had not to deal with
God. Now this reproof applies to all hypocrites, even to those who
believe that righteousness consists in ceremonies appointed by God.
Christ includes more than if he had said, that it is in *vain to serve
God by the commandments of men,* (<span id="ii.xxix-p10.3"></span>[Mr
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#007)<span id="ii.xxix-p10.3"></span>;.md)
for he condemns generally the error of worshipping God by ceremonies,
and not spiritually, by faith and a pure affection of the heart.

<span id="ii.xxix-p11"></span>On this point the prophets had always
contended earnestly with the Jews; but, as the minds of men are strongly
inclined to hypocrisy, they proudly and obstinately adhered to the
conviction, that God is pleased with external worship, even when it is
not accompanied by faith. But in the time of Christ, they had sunk to
such depth of folly, that they made religion to consist entirely in
absolute trifles. Accordingly, he directs his accusation against the
*Pharisees,* for being extremely careful to *wash cups,* and cherishing
*within their hearts the most abominable filth of cruelty and
wickedness* He charges them with folly on this ground, that God, who
created *that which is within the man,* his soul, as truly as the body,
cannot be satisfied with a mere external appearance. The chief reason
why men are deceived is, that they do not consider that they have to
deal with God, or, they transform Him according to the vanity of their
senses, as if there were no difference between Him and a mortal man.

<span id="ii.xxix-p12"></span><span id="ii.xxix-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxix-p13"></span>**41.** *But out of what you have, give
alms.* Christ, according to his custom, withdraws the Pharisees from
ceremonies to charity, declaring that it is not water, but liberality,
 <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) that cleanses both men and
food. By these words he does not disparage the grace of God, or reject
the ceremonies of the Law as vain and useless; but addresses his
discourse to those who feel confident that God will be amused by mere
signs. “It is the lawful use alone,” he says, “that sanctifies food. But
food is rightly and properly used by those who supply from their
abundance the necessities of the poor. It would therefore be better *to
give alms out of what you have,* than to be careful about washing hands
and cups, and to neglect the poor.”

<span id="ii.xxix-p15"></span><span id="ii.xxix-p15.1"></span>The
inference which the Papists draw from these words, that *alms* <span
id="ii.xxix-p15.2"></span>are satisfactions, by which we are cleansed
from our sins, is too absurd to require a lengthened refutation. Christ
does not here inform us by what price we must purchase the forgiveness
of sins, but says that those persons eat their bread with cleanness, who
bestow a part of it on the poor. I understand the words, <span
id="ii.xxix-p15.3"></span>τὰ ἐνόντα<span id="ii.xxix-p15.4"></span>, to
mean “the present supply,”  <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md)
<span id="ii.xxix-p16.2"></span> and not, as Erasmus and the old
translator render them, “what remains over.”  <span
id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md)

<span id="ii.xxix-p18"></span>The reproofs which immediately follow may
be reserved, with greater propriety, for another occasion. I do not
think it probable that Christ, while sitting at table, indulged in this
continuous strain of invective against *scribes and Pharisees,* but that
Luke has introduced here what was spoken at another time; for the
Evangelists, as we have frequently mentioned, paid little attention to
the order of dates.
