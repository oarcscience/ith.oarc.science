<span id="ii.lvii-p5"></span> **19**. Then the disciples, coming to
Jesus apart, said, Why could not we cast it out? **20**. And Jesus said
to them, On account of your unbelief; for verily I say to you, If you
have faith as a grain of mustard-seed, you shall say to this mountain.
Remove thou hence, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible
to you. **21**. But this kind  <span id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md)
goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

<span id="ii.lvii-p7"></span> 

<span id="ii.lvii-p8"></span> **28**. And when he had entered into the
house, his disciples asked him apart, Why could not we cast out?
**29**. And he said to them, This kind  <span
id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) cannot go out in any other way than by
prayer and fasting.

<span id="ii.lvii-p10"></span> 

<span id="ii.lvii-p11"></span>**5**. And the apostles said to the Lord,
Increase our faith. **6**. And the Lord said, If you had faith as a
grain of mustard-seed, you might say to this sycamore tree. Be thou
rooted up and planted in the sea; and it would obey you.

<span id="ii.lvii-p12"></span>

<span id="ii.lvii-p15"></span>**<span id="ii.lvii-p15.2"></span>[Matthew
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.lvii-p15.2"></span>.** *Then the disciples coming.* The disciples
wonder that the power which they once possessed has been taken from
them; but they had lost it by their own fault. Christ therefore
attributes this want of ability to their unbelief, and repeats and
illustrates more largely the statement which he had previously made,
that *nothing is impossible to faith* It is a hyperbolical mode of
expression, no doubt, when he declares that faith *removes trees and
mountains;* but the meaning amounts to this, that God will never forsake
us, if we keep the door open for receiving his grace. He does not mean
that God will give us every thing that we may mention, or that may
strike our minds at random. On the contrary, as nothing is more at
variance with faith than the foolish and irregular desires of our flesh,
it follows that those in whom faith reigns do not desire every thing
without discrimination, but only that which the Lord promises to give.
Let us therefore maintain such moderation as to desire nothing beyond
what he has promised to us, and to confine our prayers within that rule
which he has laid down.

<span id="ii.lvii-p16"></span>But it may be objected, that the disciples
did not know whether or not the Lord was pleased to cure the *lunatic*
It is easy to reply, that it was their own fault if they did not know;
for Christ is now speaking expressly about special *faith*, which had
its secret instincts, as the circumstances of the case required. And
this is the *faith* of which Paul speaks, (<span
id="ii.lvii-p16.1"></span>[1Co
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#009)<span id="ii.lvii-p16.1"></span>..md)
How then came it that the apostles were deprived of the power of the
Spirit, which they had formerly exercised in working miracles, but
because they had quenched it by their indolence? But what Christ said
about special *faith*, in reference to this particular event, may be
extended to the common *faith* of the whole Church.

<span id="ii.lvii-p17"></span><span id="ii.lvii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lvii-p18"></span>**21.** *This kind goeth not out*,  <span
id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) By this expression Christ reproved the
negligence of certain persons, in order to inform them that it was not
an ordinary *faith* which was required; for otherwise they might have
replied that they were not altogether destitute of *faith* The meaning
therefore is, that it is not every kind of *faith* that will suffice,
when we have to enter into a serious conflict with Satan, but that
vigorous efforts are indispensably necessary. For the weakness of
*faith* he prescribes *prayer* as a remedy, to which he adds *fasting*
by way of an auxiliary. “You are effeminate exorcist,” said he, “and
seem as if you were engaged in a mock-battle got up for amusement;
 <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) but you have to deal with a
powerful adversary, who will not yield till the battle has been fought
out. Your *faith* must therefore be excited by *prayer*, and as you are
slow and languid in *prayer*, you must resort to *fasting* as an
assistance.”  <span id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) Hence it is very
evident how absurdly the Papists represent *fasting* to be the specific
method of driving away devils, since our Lord refers to it for no other
reason than to stimulate the earnestness of prayer. When he says that
*this kind* of devils *cannot be cast out in any other way than by
prayer and fasting,* he means that, when Satan has taken deep root in
any one, and has been confirmed by long possession, or when he rages
with unbridled fury, the victory is difficult and painful, and therefore
the contest must be maintained with all our might.
