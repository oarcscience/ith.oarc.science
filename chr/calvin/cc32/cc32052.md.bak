<span id="ii.li-p3"></span> **22**. And he cometh to Bethsaida, and they
bring to him a blind man, and implore him to touch him. **23**. Then
taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the village. And
when he had spat on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him
if he saw any thing. **24**. And he looking up said, I see men; for I
perceive them walking as if they were trees. **25**. Then he again laid
his hands upon his eyes, and desired him to look; and he was restored,
so that he saw them all clearly. **26**. And he sent him away to his own
house, saying, Neither enter into the village, nor tell it to any one in
the village.

<span id="ii.li-p7"></span>This miracle, which is omitted by the other
two Evangelists, appears to have been related by Mark chiefly on account
of this circumstance, that Christ *restored* sight to *the blind man*,
not in an instant, as he was generally accustomed to do, but in a
gradual manner. He did so most probably for the purpose of proving, in
the case of this man, that he had full liberty as to his method of
proceeding, and was not restricted to a fixed rule, so as not to resort
to a variety of methods in exercising his power. On this account, he
does not all at once enlighten the eyes of *the blind man*, and fit them
for performing their office, but communicates to them at first a dark
and confused perception, and afterwards, by laying on his hands a second
time, enables them to see perfectly. And so the grace of Christ, which
had formerly been poured out suddenly on others, flowed by drops, as it
were, on this man.

*I see men.* Our Lord had put the question to *the blind man* for the
sake of his disciples, to inform them that the man had received
something, but that hitherto nothing more than a slight commencement of
the cure had been effected. The reply is, that he *sees men*, because he
perceives some persons *walking* who are upright *like trees* By these
words he acknowledges that his sight is not yet so clear as to
distinguish *men* from *trees*, but that he has already obtained some
power of seeing, because he conjectures from the motion that those whom
he perceives to be in an erect posture are men; and it is in this
respect that he says they are *like trees* We see then that he speaks
only by conjecture when he says that he *sees men*

<span id="ii.li-p10"></span><span id="ii.li-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.li-p11"></span>**26.** *And he sent him away to his house.*
Christ does not suffer him to return to *Bethsaida*, where there were
many that had beheld the miracle. This is conjectured by some to have
been done, because Christ intended to punish the inhabitants of that
place by depriving them of the enjoyment of his favor. Whatever might be
the reason, it is certain that no miracle was performed by him in order
to remain perpetually buried, but that he intended to have it concealed
along with many others, till, after having expiated by his death the
sins of the world,  <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) he should
ascend to the glory of the Father.
