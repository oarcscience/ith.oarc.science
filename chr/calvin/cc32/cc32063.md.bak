<span id="ii.lxii-p3"></span> **25**. Now his elder son was in the
field; and when he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and
dancing. **26**. And he called one of his servants, and asked what those
things were.  <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md) **27**. And he
said to him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted
calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.  <span
id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540.md) **28**. And he was angry, and would
not go in: therefore his father went out, and entreated him. **29**. But
he answering said to his father, Behold, during so many years I serve
thee, and never have I transgressed thy commandment; and thou never
gavest me a kid, that I might be merry with my friends: **30**. But
after that this thy son, who hath devoured thy property with harlots, is
come, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. **31**. But he said to
him, Son,  <span id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541.md) thou art always with
me, and all my property is thine. **32**. But it was proper that we
should be merry and rejoice; because this thy brother was dead, and is
alive again; he was lost, and is found.

<span id="ii.lxii-p9"></span><span id="ii.lxii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxii-p10"></span>This latter portion of the parable charges
those persons with cruelty, who would wickedly choose to set limits to
the grace of God, as if they envied the salvation of wretched sinners.
For we know that this is pointed at the haughtiness of the scribes,
 <span id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542.md) who did not think that they
received the reward due to their merits, if Christ admitted publicans
and the common people to the hope of the eternal inheritance. The
substance of it therefore is, that, if we are desirous to be reckoned
the children of God, we must forgive in a brotherly manner the faults of
brethren, which He forgives with fatherly kindness.

<span id="ii.lxii-p12"></span>**25.** *And his elder son was in the
field.* Those who think that, under the figure of *the first-born son*,
the Jewish nation is described, have indeed some argument on their side;
but I do not think that they attend sufficiently to the whole of the
passage. For the discourse was occasioned by *the murmuring of the
scribes*, who took offense at the kindness of Christ towards wretched
persons who had led a wicked life. He therefore compares the scribes,
who were swelled with presumption, to good and modest men, who had
always lived with decency and sobriety, and had honorably supported
their family; nay, even to obedient children, who throughout their whole
life had patiently submitted to their father’s control. And though they
were utterly unworthy of this commendation, yet Christ, speaking
according to their belief, attributes to them, by way of concession,
their pretended holiness, as if it had been virtue; as if he had said,
Though I were to grant to you what you falsely boast of, that you have
always been obedient children to God, still you ought not so haughtily
and cruelly to reject your brethren, when they repent of their wicked
life.

<span id="ii.lxii-p13"></span><span id="ii.lxii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxii-p14"></span>**28.** *Therefore his father went out.*
By these words he reproaches hypocrites with intolerable pride, which
makes it necessary that the Father should entreat them not to envy the
compassion manifested to their brethren. Now though God does not
entreat, yet by his example he exhorts us to bear with the faults of our
brethren. And in order to take away every excuse from wicked severity,
he not only introduces hypocrites as speaking, whose false boasting
might be confuted, but even affirms that, though any man had discharged,
in the most perfect manner, all the duties of piety towards the Father,
yet he has no just reason to complain because his brother obtains
pardon. It is certain, indeed, that the sincere worshippers of God are
always pure and free from this malignant disposition; but the design of
Christ is, to show that it would be unjust in any man to murmur on
account of his brother having been received into favor, even though he
were not inferior in holiness to the angels.

<span id="ii.lxii-p15"></span><span id="ii.lxii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxii-p16"></span>**31.** *Son*,  <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md) *thou art always with me.* This answer
consists of two parts. The first is, that the *first-born son* has no
reason to be angry, when he sees his brother kindly received without any
loss to himself;  <span id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md) and the second
is, that, without paying any regard to his brother’s safety, he is
grieved on account of the rejoicing occasioned by his return. *All my
property,* says he, *is thine:* that is, “Though thou hast hitherto
carried nothing away out of my house, it has been no loss to the for all
is reserved for thee undiminished.”  <span
id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md) Besides, why art thou offended at our
joy, in which thou oughtest to have shared? for it was proper that thy
brother, who we thought had been lost, should now be congratulated on
his safety and return. Those two reasons deserve our attention; for, on
the one hand, it is no loss to us,  <span
id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) if God graciously receives into favor
those who had been at variance with him on account of their sins; and,
on the other hand, it is wicked hardness of heart not to rejoice, when
we see our brethren returned from death to life.  <span
