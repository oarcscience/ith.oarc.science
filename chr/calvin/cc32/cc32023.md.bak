like a treasure hid in a field, which when found a man hideth,  <span

account of it, goeth away, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that
field. **45**. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant, seeking
beautiful pearls,  <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) **46**. Who,
having found one valuable pearl, went away, and sold all that he
possessed, and bought it. **47**. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a
net east into the sea, and collecting of every kind,  <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) **48**. Which, when it was full, they
drew to shore, and sat down, and collected the good into vessels, but
cast away the bad.  <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) **49**. So
shall it be at the end of the world: the Angels will come, and will
separate the bad from the midst of the righteous, **50**. And will cast
them into a furnace of fire: there shall be lamentation and gnashing of
teeth. **51**. Jesus saith to them, Have you understood all these
things? They say to him, Yes, Lord. **52**. But he said to them,
Therefore every scribe instructed in reference to the kingdom of heaven
 <span id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) is like a householder, who
bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.

<span id="ii.xxii-p9"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxii-p10"></span><span id="ii.xxii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxii-p11"></span>The first two of these parables are
intended to instruct believers to prefer *the Kingdom of heaven* to the
whole world, and therefore to deny themselves and all the desires of the
flesh, that nothing may prevent them from obtaining so valuable a
possession. We are greatly in need of such a warning; for we are so
captivated by the allurements of the world, that eternal life fades from
our view;  <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) and in consequence of
our carnality, the spiritual graces of God are far from being held by us
in the estimation which they deserve. Justly, therefore, does Christ
speak in such lofty terms of the excellence of eternal life, that we
ought not to feel uneasiness at relinquishing, on account of it,
whatever we reckon in other respects to be valuable.

<span id="ii.xxii-p13"></span>First, he says, that *the kingdom of
heaven is like a hidden treasure.* We commonly set a high value on what
is visible, and therefore the new and spiritual life, which is held out
to us in the Gospel, is little esteemed by us, because it is *hidden,*
and lies in hope. There is the highest appropriateness in comparing it
to *a treasure,* the value of which is in no degree diminished, though
it may be buried in the earth, and withdrawn from the eyes of men. These
words teach us, that we ought not to estimate the riches of the grace of
God according to the views of our flesh, or according to their outward
display, but in the same manner as a *treasure,* though it be *hidden,*
is preferred to a vain appearance of wealth. The same instruction is
conveyed by the other parable*. One pearl,* though it be small, is so
highly valued, that a skillful *merchant* does not hesitate to *sell*
houses and lands in order to purchase it. The excellence of the heavenly
life is not perceived, indeed, by the sense of the flesh; and yet we do
not esteem it according to its real worth, unless we are prepared to
deny, on account of it, all that glitters in our eyes.

<span id="ii.xxii-p14"></span>We now perceive the leading object of both
parables. It is to inform us, that none are qualified for receiving the
grace of the Gospel but those who disregard all other desires, and
devote all their exertions, and all their faculties, to obtain it. It
deserves our attention, also, that Christ does not pronounce the *hidden
treasure,* or the *pearl,* to be so highly valued by all. The *treasure*
is ascertained to be valuable, after that it has been *found* and known;
and it is the skillful *merchant* that forms such an opinion about the
*pearl*  <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) These words denote the
knowledge of faith. “The heavenly kingdom,” Christ tells us, “is
commonly held as of no account, because men are incapable of relishing
it, and do not perceive the inestimable value of that treasure which the
Lord offers to us in the Gospel.”

<span id="ii.xxii-p16"></span>But it is asked, is it necessary that we
abandon every other possession, in order that we may enjoy eternal life?
I answer briefly. The natural meaning of the words is, that the Gospel
does not receive from us the respect which it deserves, unless we prefer
it to all the riches, pleasures, honors, and advantages of the world,
and to such an extent, that we are satisfied with the spiritual
blessings which it promises, and throw aside every thing that would keep
us from enjoying them; for those who aspire to heaven must be disengaged
from every thing that would retard their progress. Christ exhorts those
who believe in him to deny those things only which are injurious to
godliness; and, at the same time, permits them to use and enjoy God’s
temporal favors, as if they did not use them.

<span id="ii.xxii-p17"></span><span id="ii.xxii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxii-p18"></span>**46.** *And bought it.* By the word *buy*
Christ does not mean, that men bring any price, with which they may
purchase for themselves the heavenly life; for we know on what condition
the Lord invites believers in the book of Isaiah, (<span
id="ii.xxii-p18.1"></span>[Isa
55:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001)<span id="ii.xxii-p18.1"></span>,.md)
*Come and buy wine and milk without money and without price.* But though
the heavenly life, and every thing that belongs to it, is the free gift
of God, yet we are said to *buy* it, when we cheerfully relinquish the
desires of the flesh, that nothing may prevent us from obtaining it; as
Paul says, that he

<span id="ii.xxii-p19"></span>reckoned all things to be loss and dung,
that he might gain Christ,  
(<span id="ii.xxii-p19.2"></span>[Php
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008)<span id="ii.xxii-p19.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xxii-p20"></span><span id="ii.xxii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxii-p21"></span>**47.** *Again, the kingdom of heaven is
like a net.* No new instruction is here given by Christ; but what he
formerly taught is confirmed by another parable, that the Church of God,
so long as it exists in the world, is a mixture of the good with the
bad, and is never free from stains and pollutions. And yet the design of
this parable is perhaps different. It may be that Christ intends not
only to remove the offense which perplexes many weak minds, because they
do not find in the world all the purity that might be desired, but
likewise to employ the influence of fear and modesty, in restraining his
disciples from delighting themselves with the empty title, or mere
profession, of faith. For my own part, I cheerfully adopt both views.
Christ informs us, that a mixture of the good and the bad must be
patiently endured till *the end of the word;* because, till that time, a
true and perfect restoration of the Church will not take place. Again,
he warns us, that it is not enough, and—what is more—that it is of
little consequence to us, to be gathered into the fold, unless we are
his true and chosen sheep. To this effect is the saying of Paul,

<span id="ii.xxii-p22"></span>The Lord knoweth who are his; and let
every one that calleth on the name of the Lord depart from iniquity,  
(<span id="ii.xxii-p22.2"></span>[2Ti
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019)<span id="ii.xxii-p22.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xxii-p23"></span>The preaching of the Gospel is justly
compared to a *net* sunk beneath the water, to inform us that the
present state of the Church is confused.

<span id="ii.xxii-p24"></span>Our God is the God of order, and not of
confusion,  
(<span id="ii.xxii-p24.2"></span>[1Co
14:33](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033.md)<span
id="ii.xxii-p24.2"></span>,)

<span id="ii.xxii-p25"></span>and, therefore, recommends to us
discipline; but he permits hypocrites to remain for a time among
believers, till the last day, when he will bring his kingdom to a state
of perfection. So far as lies in our power, let us endeavor to correct
vices, and let us exercise severity in removing pollutions; but the
Church will not be free from every spot and blemish, until Christ shall
have *separated the sheep from the goats,* (<span
id="ii.xxii-p25.1"></span>[Mt
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032.md)<span
id="ii.xxii-p25.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xxii-p26"></span><span id="ii.xxii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxii-p27"></span>**51.** *Have you understood all these
things?* We must keep in recollection what we have formerly seen, that
all the parables of Christ were explained in private. And now the Lord,
after having taught them in this kind and familiar manner, warns them at
the same time, that his object, in taking so much pains to instruct
them, was not merely that they might be well informed,  <span
id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) but that they might communicate to
others what they had received. In this way he whets and excites their
minds more and more to desire instruction. He says that teachers *are
like householders,* who are not only careful about their own food, but
have a store laid up for the nourishment of others; and who do not live
at ease as to the passing day, but make provision for a future and
distant period. The meaning, therefore, is, that the teachers of the
Church ought to be prepared by long study for giving to the people, as
out of a storehouse,  <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) a variety
of instruction concerning the word of God, as the necessity of the case
may require. Many of the ancient expositors understand by *things new
and old* the Law and the Gospel; but this appears to me to be forced. I
understand them simply to mean a varied and manifold distribution,
wisely and properly adapted to the capacity of every individual.
