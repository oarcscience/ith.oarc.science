Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
**17**. Who said to him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good
but God alone?  <span id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613.md) but if thou wilt
enter into life, keep the commandments. **18**. He saith to him, Which?
And Jesus said, Thou shalt not murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery,
Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, **19** Honor
thy father and mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
**20**. The young man saith to him, All these things have I kept from my
youth: what do I still want? **21**. Jesus saith to him, If thou wilt be
perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt
have a treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. **22**. And when the
young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful; for he had many
possessions.  <span id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614.md)

<span id="ii.lxx-p8"></span> 

<span id="ii.lxx-p9"></span> **17**. And as he was going out into the
road, one ran, and, when he had kneeled down, asked him, Good Master,
what shall I do, that I may obtain eternal life? **18**. And Jesus said
to him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but God alone.
**19**. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor thy
father and mother. **20**. But he answering said to him, Master, all
these things have I kept from my youth. **21**. And Jesus, beholding
him, loved him, and said to him, Thou art in want of one thing, go sell
what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have a treasure in
heaven; and come, follow me, taking the cross on thy shoulders.
**22**. But he, affected with uneasiness on account of the saying, went
away sorrowful; for he had many possessions.

<span id="ii.lxx-p10"></span> 

<span id="ii.lxx-p11"></span> **18**. And a certain ruler asked him,
saying, Good Master, what shall I do, that I may obtain eternal life?
**19**. And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? None is good
but God alone. **20**. Thou knowest the commandments, Thou shalt not
commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt
not bear false witness. Honor thy father and thy mother. **21**. And he
said, All these things have I kept from my youth. **22**. Having heard
this, Jesus said to him, Yet one thing thou wantest; sell all that thou
hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have a treasure in heaven;
and come, follow me. **23**. Having heard these things, he was grieved;
for he was very rich.

<span id="ii.lxx-p13"></span> 

<span id="ii.lxx-p14"></span><span id="ii.lxx-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxx-p15"></span>**<span id="ii.lxx-p15.2"></span>[Matthew
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.lxx-p15.2"></span>.** *And, lo, one.*<span
id="ii.lxx-p15.3"></span> Luke says that he was a *ruler*<span
id="ii.lxx-p15.4"></span>, <span id="ii.lxx-p15.5"></span>(<span
id="ii.lxx-p15.6"></span>ἄρχων<span id="ii.lxx-p15.7"></span>,) that is,
a man of very high authority, not one of the common people.  <span
id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615.md) <span id="ii.lxx-p16.2"></span>And
though riches procure respect,  <span id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616.md)
<span id="ii.lxx-p17.2"></span> yet he appears to be here represented to
have been held in high estimation as a good man. For my own part, after
weighing all the circumstances, I have no doubt that, though he is
called a *young man*<span id="ii.lxx-p17.3"></span>, <span
id="ii.lxx-p17.4"></span>he belonged to the class of those who upheld
the integrity of the *Elders*<span id="ii.lxx-p17.5"></span>, <span
id="ii.lxx-p17.6"></span>by a sober and regular life.  <span
id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617.md) <span id="ii.lxx-p18.2"></span> He did
not come treacherously, as the scribes were wont to do, but from a
desire of instruction; and, accordingly, both by words and by
*kneeling*<span id="ii.lxx-p18.3"></span>, <span
id="ii.lxx-p18.4"></span>he testifies his reverence for Christ as a
faithful teacher. But, on the other hand, a blind confidence in his
works hindered him from profiting under Christ, to whom, in other
respects, he wished to be submissive. Thus, in our own day, we find some
who are not ill-disposed, but who, under the influence of I know not
what shadowy holiness,  <span id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618.md) <span
id="ii.lxx-p19.2"></span> hardly relish the doctrine of the Gospel.

<span id="ii.lxx-p20"></span>But, in order to form a more correct
judgment of the meaning of the answer, we must attend to the form of the
question. He does not simply ask how and by what means he shall reach
*life*, but *what good thing he shall do, in order to obtain it.* He
therefore dreams of merits, on account of which he may receive *eternal
life* as a reward due; and therefore Christ appropriately sends him to
the keeping of the law, which unquestionably is the way of *life*, as I
shall explain more fully afterwards.

<span id="ii.lxx-p21"></span><span id="ii.lxx-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxx-p22"></span>**17.** *Why callest thou me good?* I do
not understand this correction in so refined a sense as is given by a
good part of interpreters, as if Christ intended to suggest his
Divinity; for they imagine that these words mean, “If thou perceivest in
me nothing more exalted than human nature, thou falsely appliest to me
the epithet *good*, which belongs to *God alone*.” I do acknowledge
that, strictly speaking, men and even angels do not deserve so honorable
a title; because they have not a drop of goodness in themselves, but
borrowed from God; and because in the former, goodness is only begun,
and is not perfect. But Christ had no other intention than to maintain
the truth of his doctrine; as if he had said, “Thou falsely *callest me
a good Master*, unless thou acknowledgest that I have come from God.”
The essence of his Godhead, therefore, is not here maintained, but the
*young man* is directed to admit the truth of the doctrine. He had
already felt some disposition to obey; but Christ wishes him to rise
higher, that he may hear God speaking. For — as it is customary with men
to make angels of those who are devils — they indiscriminately give the
appellation of *good teachers* to those in whom they perceive nothing
divine; but those modes of speaking are only profanations of the gifts
of God. We need not wonder, therefore, if Christ, in order to maintain
the authority of his doctrine, directs the young *man* to God.

<span id="ii.lxx-p23"></span>*Keep the commandments.* This passage was
erroneously interpreted by some of the ancients, whom the Papists have
followed, as if Christ taught that, by *beeping* the law, we may merit
*eternal life* On the contrary, Christ did not take into consideration
what men can do, but replied to the question, What is the righteousness
of works? or, What does the Law require? And certainly we ought to
believe that God comprehended in his law the way of living holily and
righteously, in which righteousness is included; for not without reason
did Moses make this statement,

<span id="ii.lxx-p24"></span>He that does these things shall live in
them, (<span id="ii.lxx-p24.1"></span>[Le
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005)<span id="ii.lxx-p24.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="ii.lxx-p25"></span>and again,

<span id="ii.lxx-p26"></span>I call heaven and earth to witness that l
have  
this day showed you life, (<span id="ii.lxx-p26.2"></span>[De
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019)<span id="ii.lxx-p26.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.lxx-p27"></span>We have no right, therefore, to deny that
the keeping of the law is righteousness, by which any man who kept the
law perfectly — if there were such a man — would obtain life for
himself. But as we are *all destitute of the glory of God*, (<span
id="ii.lxx-p27.1"></span>[Ro 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md)<span
id="ii.lxx-p27.1"></span>,) nothing but cursing will be found in the
law; and nothing remains for us but to betake ourselves to the
undeserved gift of righteousness. And therefore Paul lays down a twofold
righteousness, *the righteousness of the law*, (<span
id="ii.lxx-p27.2"></span>[Ro 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.lxx-p27.2"></span>,) and the righteousness of faith, (<span
id="ii.lxx-p27.3"></span>[Ro 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.lxx-p27.3"></span>.) He makes the first to consist in works, and
the second, in the free grace of Christ.

<span id="ii.lxx-p28"></span>Hence we infer, that this reply of Christ
is legal, because it was proper that the *young man* who inquired about
the righteousness of works should first be taught that no man is
accounted righteous before God unless he has fulfilled the law,  <span
id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619) (which is impossible,.md) that, convinced
of his weakness, he might betake himself to the assistance of faith. I
acknowledge, therefore, that, as God has promised the reward of *eternal
life* to those who keep his law, we ought to hold by this way, if the
weakness of our flesh did not prevent; but Scripture teaches us, that it
is through our own fault that it becomes necessary for us to receive as
a gift what we cannot obtain by works. If it be objected, that it is in
vain to hold out to us *the righteousness which is in the law*, (<span
id="ii.lxx-p29.2"></span>[Ro 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.lxx-p29.2"></span>,) which no man will ever be able to reach, I
reply, since it is the first part of instruction, by which we are led to
the righteousness which is obtained by prayer, it is far from being
superfluous; and, therefore, when Paul says, that *the doers of the law
are justified*, (<span id="ii.lxx-p29.3"></span>[Ro
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013)<span id="ii.lxx-p29.3"></span>,.md)
he excludes all from *the righteousness of the law*.

<span id="ii.lxx-p30"></span>This passage sets aside all the inventions
which the Papists have contrived in order to obtain salvation. For not
only are they mistaken in wishing to lay God under obligation to them by
their good works, to bestow salvation as a debt; but when they apply
themselves to do what is right, they leave out of view the doctrine of
the law, and attend chiefly to their pretended *devotions*, as they call
them, not that they openly reject the law of God, but that they greatly
prefer human traditions.  <span id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620.md) But
what does Christ say? That the only worship of which God approves is
that which he has prescribed; because *obedience is better to him than
all sacrifices*,  <span id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md) (<span
id="ii.lxx-p32.2"></span>[1Sa
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022)<span id="ii.lxx-p32.2"></span>..md)
So then, while the Papists are employed in frivolous traditions, let
every man who endeavors to regulate his life by obedience to Christ
direct his whole attention to *keep the commandments* of the law.

<span id="ii.lxx-p33"></span><span id="ii.lxx-p33.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxx-p34"></span>**18.** *Thou shalt not murder* It is
surprising that, though Christ intended to show that we are bound to
obey the whole law, he should mention the second table only; but he did
so, because from the duties of charity the disposition of every man is
better ascertained. Piety towards God holds, no doubt, a higher rank;
 <span id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md) but as the observation of the
first table is often feigned by hypocrites, the second table is better
adapted for making a scrutiny.  <span id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623.md)
Let us know, therefore, that Christ selected those commandments in which
is contained a proof of true righteousness; but by a *synecdoche* he
takes a part for the whole. As to the circumstance of his placing that
commandment last which speaks of *honoring* parents, it is of no
consequence, for he paid no attention to the regular order. Yet it is
worthy of notice, that this commandment is declared to belong to the
second table, that no one may be led astray by the error of Josephus,
who thought that it belonged to the first table.  <span
id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624.md) What is added at the end, *Thou shalt
love thy neighbor,* contains nothing different from the former
commandments, but is, general explanation of them all.

<span id="ii.lxx-p38"></span>*The young man saith to him.* The law must
have been dead to him, when he vainly imagined that he was so righteous;
for if he had not flattered himself through hypocrisy, it was an
excellent advice to him to learn humility, to contemplate his spots and
blemishes in the mirror of the law. But, intoxicated with foolish
confidence, he fearlessly boasts that he has discharged his duty
properly from his childhood. Paul acknowledges that the same thing
happened to himself, that, so long as the power of *the law* was unknown
to him, he believed that he *was alive;* but that, after he knew what
*the law* could do, a deadly wound was inflicted on him, (<span
id="ii.lxx-p38.1"></span>[Ro 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.lxx-p38.1"></span>.) So the reply of Christ, which follows, was
suited to the man’s disposition. And yet Christ does not demand any
thing beyond the commandments of the law, but, as the bare recital had
not affected him, Christ employed other words for detecting the hidden
disease of avarice.

<span id="ii.lxx-p39"></span>I confess that we are nowhere commanded in
the law to *sell all;* but as the design of the law is, to bring men to
self-denial, and as it expressly condemns covetousness, we see that
Christ had no other object in view than to correct the false conviction
of the *young man*.  <span id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625.md) for if he
had known himself thoroughly, as soon as he heard the mention of *the
law*, he would have acknowledged that he was liable to the judgment of
God; but now, when the bare words of the law do not sufficiently
convince him of his guilt, the inward meaning is expressed by other
words. If Christ now demanded any thing beyond the commandments of the
law, he would be at variance with himself. He just now taught that
perfect righteousness is comprehended in *the commandments* of the law:
how then will it agree with this to charge the law with deficiency?
Besides, the protestation of Moses, (<span id="ii.lxx-p40.2"></span>[De
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015)<span id="ii.lxx-p40.2"></span>,.md)
which I formerly quoted, would be false.

<span id="ii.lxx-p41"></span><span id="ii.lxx-p41.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxx-p42"></span>**<span id="ii.lxx-p42.2"></span>[Mark
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.lxx-p42.2"></span>.** *One thing thou wantest.* Christ therefore
does not mean that the *young man wanted* one *Thing* beyond the keeping
of the law, but in the very keeping of the law. For though the law
nowhere obliges us to *sell all*, yet as it represses all sinful
desires, and teaches us to *bear the cross,* as it bids us be prepared
for hunger and poverty, the *young man* is very far from keeping it
fully, so long as he is attached to his riches, and burns with
covetousness. And he says that *one thing is wanting*, because he does
not need to preach to him about fornication and murder, but to point out
a particular disease, as if he were laying his finger on the sore.

<span id="ii.lxx-p43"></span>It ought also to be observed, that he does
not only enjoin him *to sell*, but likewise to *give to the poor;* for
to part with riches would not be in itself a virtue, but rather a vain
ambition. Profane historians applaud Crates, a Theban, because he threw
into the sea his money and all that he reckoned valuable; for he did not
think that he could save himself unless his wealth were lost; as if it
would not have been better to bestow on others what he imagined to be
more than he needed. Certainly, as *charity is the bond of perfection*,
(<span id="ii.lxx-p43.1"></span>[Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014)<span id="ii.lxx-p43.1"></span>,.md)
he who deprives others, along with himself, of the use of money,
deserves no praise; and therefore Christ applauds not simply the
*sellin*g but liberality in assisting *the poor*

<span id="ii.lxx-p44"></span>The mortification of the flesh is still
more strongly urged by Christ, when he says, *Follow me.* For he enjoins
him not only to become his disciple, but to submit his shoulders to
*bear the cross,* as Mark expressly states. And it was necessary that
such an excitement should be applied; for, having been accustomed to the
ease, and leisure and conveniences, of home, he had never experienced,
in the smallest degree, what it was to crucify the old man, and to
subdue the desires of the flesh. But it is excessively ridiculous in the
monks, under the pretense of this passage, to claim for themselves state
of perfection. First, it is easy to infer, that Christ does not command
all without exception to *sell all that they have;* for the husbandman,
who had been accustomed to live by his labor, and to support his
children, would do wrong in selling his possession, if he were not
constrained to it by any necessity. To keep what God has put in our
power, provided that, by maintaining ourselves and our family in sober
and frugal manner, we bestow some portion on the poor, is a greater
virtue than to squander all. But what sort of thing is that famous
*selling*, on which the monks plume themselves? A good part of them,
finding no provision at home, plunge themselves into monasteries as
well-stocked hog-styes. All take such good care of themselves, that they
feed in idleness on the bread of others. A rare exchange truly, when
those who are ordered to give to the poor what they justly possess are
not satisfied with their own, but seize on the property of others.

<span id="ii.lxx-p45"></span>*Jesus beholding him, loved him.* The
inference which the Papists draw from this, that works morally good —
that is, works which are not performed by the impulse of the Spirit, but
go before regeneration — have *the merit of congruity*, is an
excessively childish contrivance. For if *merit* be alleged to be the
consequence of the love of God, we must then say that frogs and fleas
have merit, because all the creatures of God, without exception, are the
objects of his love. To distinguish the degrees of love is, therefore, a
matter of importance.  <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626.md) As to the
present passage, it may be enough to state briefly, that God embraces in
fatherly love none but his children, whom he has regenerated with the
Spirit of adoption, and that it is in consequence of this love that they
are accepted at his tribunal. In this sense, to be loved by God, and to
be justified in his sight, are synonymous terms.  <span
id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627.md)

<span id="ii.lxx-p48"></span>But God is sometimes said to *love* those
whom he does not approve or justify; for, since the preservation of the
human race is agreeable to Him — which consists in justice, uprightness,
moderation, prudence, fidelity, and temperance — he is said to *love*
the political virtues; not that they are meritorious of salvation or of
grace, but that they have reference to an end of which he approves. In
this sense, under various points of view, God *loved* Aristides and
Fabricius, and also *hated* them; for, in so far as he had bestowed on
them outward righteousness, and that for the general advantage, he
*loved* his own work in them; but as their heart was impure, the outward
semblance of righteousness was of no avail for obtaining righteousness.
For we know that by faith alone hearts are purified, and that the Spirit
of uprightness is given to the members of Christ alone. Thus the
question is answered, How was it possible that Christ should *love* a
man who was proud and a hypocrite, while nothing is more hateful to God
than these two vices? For it is not inconsistent, that the good seed,
which God has implanted in some natures, shall be *loved* by Him, and
yet that He should reject their persons and works on account of
corruption.

<span id="ii.lxx-p49"></span><span id="ii.lxx-p49.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lxx-p50"></span>**<span id="ii.lxx-p50.2"></span>[Matthew
19:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.lxx-p50.2"></span>.** *He went away sorrowful.* The result at
length showed how widely distant the *young man* was from that
perfection to which Christ had called him; for how comes it that he
withdraws from the school of Christ, but because he finds it uneasy to
be stripped of his riches? But if we are not prepared to endure poverty,
it is manifest that covetousness reigns in us. And this is what I said
at the outset, that the order which Christ gave, to *sell all that he
had*, was not an addition to the law, but the scrutiny of a concealed
vice.  <span id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628.md) For the more deeply a man
is tainted by this or the other vice, the more strikingly will it be
dragged forth to light by being reproved. We are reminded also by this
example that, if we would persevere steadily in the school of Christ, we
must renounce the flesh. This *young man*, who had brought both a desire
to learn and modesty, withdrew from Christ, because it was hard to part
with a darling vice. The same thing will happen to us, unless the
sweetness of the grace of Christ render all the allurements of the flesh
distasteful to us. Whether or not this temptation was temporary, so that
the *young man* afterwards repented, we know not; but it may be
conjectured with probability, that his covetousness kept him back from
making any proficiency.
