<span id="ii.ix-p5"></span>**1**. At that time Jesus was passing through
the corn-fields on the Sabbath;  <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md)
and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and
to eat. **2**. But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, Lo, thy
disciples do what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath. **3**. But he
said to them, Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and
those who were with him? **4**. How he entered into the house of God,
and ate the shew-bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for
those who were with him, but for the priests alone? **5**. Or have you
not read in the Law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple
profane the temple, and are free from blame?  <span

than the temple is in this place. **7**. But if you knew what that is, I
choose mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the
innocent. **8**. For the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath.

<span id="ii.ix-p8"></span> 

<span id="ii.ix-p9"></span> **23**. And it happened, that he was passing
through the corn-fields, and his disciples began to pluck the ears of
corn as they went along. **24**. And the Pharisees said to him, Lo, why
do they on the Sabbath what is not lawful? **25**. And he said to them,
Have you not read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, and
those who were with him? **26**. How he entered into the house of God in
the time of Abiathar, the high-priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it
is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also  <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) to those who were with him? **27**. And
he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
Sabbath. **28**. Therefore the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath.

<span id="ii.ix-p11"></span> 

<span id="ii.ix-p12"></span>**1**. And it happened that, on the
second-first Sabbath, he was passing through the cornfields; and his
disciples were plucking ears of corn, and were eating, rubbing them in
their hands. **2**. And some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you
do what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath? **3**. And Jesus
answering saith to them, Have you not read even this which David did
when he was hungry, and those who were with him? **4**. How he entered
into the house of God, and took the shew-bread, and ate it, and gave
also to those who were with him, which it is not lawful to eat but only
for the priests? **5**. And he said to them, The Son of man is Lord even
of the Sabbath.

<span id="ii.ix-p16"></span>**<span id="ii.ix-p16.2"></span>[Matthew
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#001.md)<span id="ii.ix-p16.2"></span>.**
*Jesus was walking on the Sabbath* It was the design of the Evangelists,
in this history, to show partly what a malicious disposition the
Pharisees had, and partly how superstitiously they were attached to
outward and slight matters, so as to make holiness to consist in them
entirely. They blame the disciples of Christ for *plucking the ears of
corn on the Sabbath,* during their journey, when they were pressed with
hunger, as if, by so doing, they were violating the *Sabbath.* The
keeping of the *Sabbath* was, indeed, a holy thing, but not such a
manner of keeping it as they imagined, so that one could scarcely move a
finger without making the conscience to tremble.  <span
id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) It was hypocrisy, therefore, that made
them so exact in trifling matters, while they spared themselves in gross
superstitions; as Christ elsewhere upbraids them with

<span id="ii.ix-p18"></span>paying tithe of mint and anise, and
neglecting the  
important matters of the Law, (<span id="ii.ix-p18.2"></span>[Mt
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023)<span id="ii.ix-p18.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.ix-p19"></span>It is the invariable practice of hypocrites
to allow themselves liberty in matters of the greatest consequence, and
to pay close attention to ceremonial observances. Another reason why
they demand that outward rites should be more rigorously observed is,
that they wish to make their duty toward God to consist only in carnal
worship. But it was malevolence and envy, still more than superstition,
that led them to this act of censure; for towards others they would not
have been equally stern. It is proper for us to observe the feelings by
which they were animated, lest any one should be distressed by the fact,
that the very Doctors of the Law were so hostile to Christ.

<span id="ii.ix-p21"></span>**<span id="ii.ix-p21.2"></span>[Luke
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#001.md)<span id="ii.ix-p21.2"></span>.**
*On the second-first Sabbath* It is beyond all question that this
Sabbath belonged to some one of the festival-days which the Law enjoined
to be observed once every year. Some have thought that there were two
festival-days in immediate succession; but as the Jews had arranged
their festival-days after the Babylonish captivity so that one day
always intervened between them, that opinion is set aside. Others
maintain with greater probability, that it was the last day of the
solemnity, which was as numerously attended as the first. I am more
inclined to favor those who understand by it the second festivity in the
year; and this agrees exceedingly well with the name given to it, *the
second-first Sabbath,* because, among the great Sabbaths which were
annually observed, it was the second in the order of time. Now the
*first* was the Passover, and it is therefore probable that this was
*the feast of first-fruits,* (<span id="ii.ix-p21.3"></span>[Exod.
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016)<span id="ii.ix-p21.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.ix-p23"></span>**<span id="ii.ix-p23.2"></span>[Mark
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#024.md)<span id="ii.ix-p23.2"></span>.**
*Why do they on the Sabbath what is not lawful?* The Pharisees do not
blame the disciples of Christ for *plucking ears of corn* from a field
that was not their own, but for violating *the Sabbath;* as if there had
been a precept to this effect, that famishing men ought rather to die
than to satisfy their hunger. Now the only reason for keeping the
Sabbath was, that the people, by sanctifying themselves to God, might be
employed in true and spiritual worship; and next, that, being free from
all worldly occupations, they might be more at liberty to attend the
holy assemblies. The lawful observation of it, therefore, must have a
reference to this object; for the Law ought to be interpreted according
to the design of the Legislator. But this shows clearly the malicious
and implacable nature of superstition, and particularly the proud and
cruel dispositions of hypocrites, when ambition is joined to hatred of
the person. It was not the mere affectation of pretended holiness, as I
have said, that made the Pharisees so stern and rigorous; but as they
expressly wished to carp at every thing that Christ said or did, they
could not do otherwise than put a wrong meaning in cases where there was
nothing to blame, as usually happens with prejudiced interpreters. The
accusation was brought—according to Matthew and Mark—against our Lord,
and—according to Luke—against his disciples. But there is no
inconsistency here; for the disciples were in all probability so
harassed, that the charge was directed chiefly against the Master
himself. It is even possible that the Pharisees first wrangled with the
disciples, and afterwards with Christ, and that, in the rage of their
malice, they blamed him for remaining silent, and permitting his
disciples to break the Sabbath.

<span id="ii.ix-p24"></span><span id="ii.ix-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ix-p25"></span>**<span id="ii.ix-p25.2"></span>[Matthew
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#003.md)<span id="ii.ix-p25.2"></span>.**
*Have you not read what David did?* Christ employs five arguments to
refute their calumny. *First,* he apologizes for his disciples by
pleading the example of *David,* (<span id="ii.ix-p25.3"></span>[1Sa
21:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#006)<span id="ii.ix-p25.3"></span>..md)
While David was fleeing from the rage of Saul, he applied for provisions
to the high-priest Ahimelech; and there being no ordinary food at hand,
he succeeded in obtaining a part of the holy bread. If David’s necessity
excused him, the same argument ought to be admitted in the case of
others. Hence it follows, that the ceremonies of the Law are not
violated where there is no infringement of godliness.  <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) Now Christ takes for granted, that David
was free from blame, because the Holy Spirit bestows commendation on the
priest who allowed him to partake of the holy bread. When he says, that
*it was not lawful to eat* that bread *but for the priests alone,* we
must understand him to refer to the ordinary law:

<span id="ii.ix-p27"></span>they shall eat those things wherewith the
atonement was made,  
to consecrate and to sanctify them; but a stranger shall not  
eat thereof, because they are holy, (<span id="ii.ix-p27.3"></span>[Ex
29:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#033)<span id="ii.ix-p27.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.ix-p28"></span>If David had attempted to do what was
contrary to law, it would have been in vain for Christ to plead his
example; for what had been prohibited for a particular end no necessity
could make lawful.

<span id="ii.ix-p29"></span><span id="ii.ix-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ix-p30"></span>**5.** *That on the Sabbaths the priests
profane the Sabbath.* This is the *second* argument by which Christ
proves that the violation of the Sabbath, of which the Pharisees
complained, was free from all blame; because *on the Sabbaths* it is
lawful to slay beasts for sacrifice, to circumcise infants, and to do
other things relating to the worship of God. Hence it follows, that the
duties of piety are in no degree inconsistent with each other.  <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) But if *the temple* sanctifies manual
operations connected with sacrifices, and with the whole of the outward
service, the holiness of the true and spiritual *temple* has greater
efficacy, in exempting its worshippers from all blame, while they are
discharging the duties of godliness.  <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) Now the object which the disciples had in
view was, to present to God souls which were consecrated by the Gospel.

<span id="ii.ix-p33"></span>Matthew alone glances at this argument. When
Christ says, that *the priests Profane the Sabbath,* the expression is
not strictly accurate, and is accommodated to his hearers; for when the
Law enjoins men to abstain from their employments, it does not forbid
them to perform the services of religion. But Christ admits that to be
true which might appear to be so in the eye of ignorant persons,  <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) and rests satisfied with proving, that
the labors performed in the temple are not offensive to God.

<span id="ii.ix-p35"></span><span id="ii.ix-p35.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ix-p36"></span>**7.** *But if you knew* This *Third*
argument is also mentioned by Matthew alone. Christ conveys an indirect
reproof to the Pharisees, for not considering why ceremonies were
appointed, and to what object they are directed. This has been a common
fault in almost every age; and therefore the prophet Hosea (<span
id="ii.ix-p36.1"></span>[Ho 6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.ix-p36.1"></span>) exclaims against the men of his own age for
being too much attached to ceremonies, and caring little about the
duties of kindness. But God declares aloud, that he sets a higher value
on *mercy* than on sacrifice, employing the word *mercy,* by a figure of
speech, for offices of kindness, as *sacrifices* include the outward
service of the Law. This statement Christ applies to his own time, and
charges the Pharisees with wickedly torturing the Law of God out of its
true meaning, with disregarding the second table, and being entirely
occupied with ceremonies.

<span id="ii.ix-p37"></span>But a question arises: Why does God declare
that he is indifferent about ceremonies, when he strictly enjoined in
his Law that they should be observed? The answer is easy. External rites
are of no value in themselves, and are demanded by God in so far only as
they are directed to their proper object. Besides, God does not
absolutely reject them, but, by a comparison with deeds of kindness,
pronounces that they are inferior to the latter in actual value. Nor is
it inconsistent with this to say, that in the perfection of
righteousness the highest rank belongs to the worship of God, and the
duties which men owe to each other occupy the second rank. For, though
piety is justly reckoned to be as much superior to charity as God is
higher than men, yet as believers, by practicing justice towards each
other, prove that their service of God is sincere, it is not without
reason that this subject is brought under the notice of hypocrites, who
imitate piety by outward signs, and yet pervert it by confining their
laborious efforts to the carnal worship alone.  <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) From the testimony of the Prophet, Christ
justly infers that no blame attaches to his disciples; for while God
trained his people in the rudiments of the Law, it was far from being
his design to kill wretched men with famine.

<span id="ii.ix-p39"></span><span id="ii.ix-p39.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ix-p40"></span>**8.** *For the Son of man is Lord even of
the Sabbath.* Some connect this sentence with a preceding statement,
*that one greater than the temple is in this place,* (<span
id="ii.ix-p40.2"></span>[Mt 12:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.ix-p40.2"></span>;) but I look upon them as different. In the
former case, Christ, by an allusion to *the temple,* affirmed that
whatever was connected with his personal holiness was not a
transgression of the Law; but now, he declares that he has received
authority to exempt his followers from the necessity of observing the
Sabbath. *The Son of man,* (he says,) in the exercise of his authority,
can relax the Sabbath in the same manner as other legal ceremonies. And
certainly out of Christ the bondage of the Law is wretched, from which
he alone delivers those on whom he bestows the free *Spirit of
adoption,*  <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) (<span
id="ii.ix-p41.2"></span>[Ro 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.ix-p41.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.ix-p42"></span><span id="ii.ix-p42.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ix-p43"></span>**<span id="ii.ix-p43.2"></span>[Mark
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027.md)<span id="ii.ix-p43.2"></span>.**
*The Sabbath was made for man.* This *Fifth* argument is related by Mark
alone. The general meaning is, that those persons judge amiss who turn
to man’s destruction,  <span id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) the Sabbath
which God appointed for his benefit. The Pharisees saw the disciples of
Christ employed in a holy work; they saw them worn out with the fatigue
of the journey, and partly with want of food; and yet are offended that,
when they are hungry, they take a few grains of corn for the support of
their wearied bodies. Is not this a foolish attempt to overturn the
purpose of God, when they demand to the injury of men that observation
of the Sabbath which he intended to be advantageous? But they are
mistaken, I think, who suppose that in this passage the Sabbath is
entirely abolished; for Christ simply informs us what is the proper use
of it. Though he asserted, a little before, that he is *Lord of the
Sabbath,* yet the full time for its abolition  <span
id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md) was not yet come, because *the veil of
the temple* was not yet *rent,* (<span id="ii.ix-p45.2"></span>[Mt
27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051)<span id="ii.ix-p45.2"></span>..md)
