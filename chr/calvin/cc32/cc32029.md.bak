<span id="ii.xxviii-p3"></span> **31**. The same day some of the
Pharisees came, saying to him, Depart, and go hence: for Herod intends
to kill thee. **32**. And he said to them, Go, tell that fox, Lo, I cast
out devils, and I perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I
am completed.  <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) **33**. But yet I
must walk today and tomorrow, and the following day; for it is not a
usual occurrence that a prophet perish anywhere else than in Jerusalem.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p7"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxviii-p8"></span><span id="ii.xxviii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p9"></span>It deserves our attention, that Christ
gives the designation, *daughter of Abraham,* to one whose body had been
*enslaved by Satan during eighteen years.* She was so called, not only
in reference to her lineage, as all the Jews without exception gloried
in this title, but because she was one of the true and actual members of
the Church. Here we perceive also what Paul tells us, that some are

<span id="ii.xxviii-p10"></span>delivered to Satan for the destruction
of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord
Jesus,  
(<span id="ii.xxviii-p10.2"></span>[1Co
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.xxviii-p10.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xxviii-p11"></span>And the length of time points out to us
that, though the Lord does not immediately relieve our distresses, yet
we ought not to despair.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p12"></span>It is difficult to ascertain the precise
time when this happened, farther than that Christ was at that time
residing in Galilee, as during the whole period of his public calling he
remained longer there than in any other place. Certain persons, wishing
to be considered as his friends, advise him that, if he wishes to be in
safety, he should go beyond the boundaries of Herod’s jurisdiction. In
what manner those who gave that advice were affected towards him we have
no means of knowing; but I am strongly inclined to conjecture, that they
attempted to drive him to some other place, because they saw that the
greater part of the people in that place were attached to Christ, so
that the Gospel was generally received. We must observe who those
advisers were. Luke says that they were *some of the Pharisees* Now we
know that that sect was not so favorable to Christ as to make it
probable that those men were anxious about his life. What then? Their
design was, to awaken in him such fears as would drive him to some place
of concealment; for they expected that, in a short time, his authority
would decline, and that his whole doctrine would vanish away. But we
must also direct our attention to the first originator and contriver of
this scheme, Satan; for, as he endeavored at that time to interrupt the
progress of the Gospel, by terrifying the Son of God, so he constantly
invents and hatches up new grounds of alarm, to strike the ministers of
Christ with dismay, and to constrain them to turn aside.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p13"></span><span id="ii.xxviii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p14"></span>**32.** *Go, tell that fox* It is
certain, that the person here spoken of is Herod Antipas. Though he had
throughout the character of a *fox,* and was as remarkable for servility
as for cunning, I do not think that the term, *fox,* is intended to
refer generally to the cunning of his whole life, but rather to the
insidious methods by which he labored to undermine the doctrine of the
Gospel, when he did not venture to attack it openly. Christ tells him
that, with all his craftiness, he will gain nothing by his schemes.
“Whatever artifices he may devise,” says Christ, “*today and tomorrow* I
will discharge the office which God has enjoined upon me; and when I
shall have reached the end of my course, I shall then be offered in
sacrifice.” That we may perceive more clearly the meaning of the words,
Christ acknowledges, in the former part of his message, that on *the
third* day—that is, within a very short time—he must die; and in this
way shows, that he could not be deterred from his duty by any fear of
death, to which he advanced boldly, with fixed purpose of mind.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p15"></span><span id="ii.xxviii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p16"></span>**33.** *It does not usually happen,
etc.* He next adds, that it is an idle bugbear, which is held out by
false and hypocritical advisers; because there is no danger of death
*anywhere else than at Jerusalem.* In this second clause he sharply
attacks the Pharisees. “Is it you, who — I foresee — will be my
executioners, that advise me to beware of *Herod?*” The reproof extends,
indeed, much farther; for he says, not only that preparations had been
made for his own death in *Jerusalem,* but that it might be said to have
been, for a long period, a den of robbers, in which almost all the
*prophets* had been murdered. Many had, no doubt, been slain in other
places, and particularly at the time when that cruel fury,  <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) Jezebel, (<span
id="ii.xxviii-p17.2"></span>[1Ki
19:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.xxviii-p17.2"></span>,) raged against them; but because in no
other place had the *prophets,* at any time, been fiercely tormented,
Christ justly brings this reproach against the ungodly inhabitants of
the holy city.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p18"></span>*It usually happened* that the prophets
were slain there; because not only was it the source of all the
ungodliness which spread over the whole of Judea, but it was also the
field on which God trained his *prophets.*  <span
id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) We know that the more brightly the
light of doctrine shines, so as to press more closely on wicked men,
they are driven to a greater pitch of madness. What a dreadful example
was it, that a place which had been chosen to be the sanctuary of divine
worship, and the residence of the Law and of heavenly wisdom, should be
polluted not by one or another murder,, but by a regular butchery of the
*prophets*! It undoubtedly shows how obstinate is the rebellion of the
world in rejecting sound doctrine.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p20"></span>The exclamation which immediately
follows in Luke, (<span id="ii.xxviii-p20.1"></span>[Lu
13:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#034.md)<span
id="ii.xxviii-p20.1"></span>,) appears to be connected in such a manner,
as if Christ had taken occasion from the present occurrence to inveigh,
at this time, against *Jerusalem* But for my own part, I rather think,
that Luke, having said that *Jerusalem* had been formerly stained by the
blood of the *prophets,* nay, had been, through an uninterrupted
succession of many ages, the slaughter-place, where the prophets were
cruelly and wickedly put to death, immediately inserts, according to his
custom, a statement which harmonized with that discourse. We have seen,
on former occasions, that it is by no means unusual with him to
introduce into one place a collection of Christ’s sayings, which were
uttered at various times.
