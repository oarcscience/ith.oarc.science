<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text22"><a name="ii.lxii-p10"></A>This latter portion of the parable charges those persons with cruelty, who would wickedly choose to set limits to the grace of God, as if they envied the salvation of wretched sinners. For we know that this is pointed at the haughtiness of the scribes,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_542"></A><A HREF="#fn_542"><FONT SIZE="1">543</FONT></A>
 			 who did not think that they received the reward due to their merits, if Christ admitted publicans and the common people to the hope of the eternal inheritance. The substance of it therefore is, that, if we are desirous to be reckoned the children of God, we must forgive in a brotherly manner the faults of brethren, which He forgives with fatherly kindness.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxii-p12"></A><b>25. </b><i>And his elder son was in the field.</i> Those who think that, under the figure of <i>the first-born son</i>, the Jewish nation is described, have indeed some argument on their 			 side; but I do not think that they attend sufficiently to the whole of the passage. For the discourse was occasioned by <i>the murmuring of the scribes</i>, who took offense at the kindness of Christ towards wretched persons who had led a wicked life. He therefore compares the scribes, who were swelled with presumption, to good and modest men, who had always 			 lived with decency and sobriety, and had honorably supported their family; nay, even to obedient children, who throughout their whole life had patiently submitted to their father&#8217;s control. And though they were utterly unworthy of this commendation, yet Christ, speaking according to their belief, attributes to them, by way of concession, their pretended holiness, as if it had been virtue; as if he had said, Though I were to grant to you what you falsely boast of, that you have always been 			 obedient children to God, still you ought not so haughtily and cruelly to reject your brethren, when they repent of their wicked life.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lxii-p13"></A><a name="ii.lxii-p13.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxii-p14"></A><b>28. </b><i>Therefore his father went out.</i> By these words he reproaches hypocrites with intolerable pride, which makes it necessary that the Father should entreat them not to envy the compassion manifested to their brethren. Now though God does not entreat, yet by his example he exhorts us to bear with the faults of 			 our brethren. And in order to take away every excuse from wicked severity, he not only introduces hypocrites as speaking, whose false boasting might be confuted, but even affirms that, though any man had discharged, in the most perfect manner, all the duties of piety towards the Father, yet he has no just reason to complain because his brother obtains pardon. It is certain, indeed, that the sincere worshippers of God are always pure and free from this malignant disposition; but the design of 			 Christ is, to show that it would be unjust in any man to murmur on account of his brother having been received into favor, even though he were not inferior in holiness to the angels.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.lxii-p15"></A><a name="ii.lxii-p15.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text14"><a name="ii.lxii-p16"></A><b>31. </b><i>Son</i>,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_543"></A><A HREF="#fn_543"><FONT SIZE="1">544</FONT></A>
 			  <i>thou art always with me.</i> This answer consists of two parts. The first is, that the <i>first-born son </i>has no reason to be angry, when he sees his brother kindly received without any loss to himself;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_544"></A><A HREF="#fn_544"><FONT SIZE="1">545</FONT></A>
 			  and the second is, that, without paying any regard to his brother&#8217;s safety, he is grieved on account of the rejoicing occasioned by his return. <i>All my property,</i> says he, <i>is thine: </i>that is, &#8220;Though thou hast hitherto carried nothing away 			 out of my house, it has been no loss to the for all is reserved for thee undiminished.&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_545"></A><A HREF="#fn_545"><FONT SIZE="1">546</FONT></A>
 			  Besides, why art thou offended at our joy, in which thou oughtest to have shared? for it was proper that thy brother, who we thought had been lost, should now be congratulated on his safety and return. Those two reasons deserve our attention; for, on the one hand, it is no loss to us,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_546"></A><A HREF="#fn_546"><FONT SIZE="1">547</FONT></A>
 			  if God graciously receives into favor those who had been at variance with him on account of their sins; and, on the other hand, it is wicked hardness of heart not to rejoice, when we see our brethren returned from death to life.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_547"></A><A HREF="#fn_547"><FONT SIZE="1">548</FONT></A>
