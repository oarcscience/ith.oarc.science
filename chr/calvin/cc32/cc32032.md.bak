were invited, observing how they chose the first seats, saying to them:
**8**. When thou shalt be invited by any one to a marriage, do not sit
at table in the first seat, lest perhaps a more honorable person than
thyself be invited by him, **9**. And he who invited thee and him come
and say to thee, Give place to this man, and thou begin then with shame
to occupy the lowest place. **10**. But on the contrary, when thou shalt
be invited, go, and sit at table in the lowest place, that when he who
hath invited thee shall come, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher:
then shalt thou have honor in presence of those who sit at table with
thee. **11**. For every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled, and
he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. **12**. And he said to him by
whom he had been invited, When thou makest a dinner or supper, invite
not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy relatives, nor rich
neighbors, lest they also in their turn invite thee, and a recompense be
made thee. **13**. But when thou makest a banquet, invite the poor, the
maimed, the lame, the blind. **14**. And thou shalt be blessed, because
they cannot recompense thee; for thou shalt be recompensed at the
resurrection of the righteous.

<span id="ii.xxxi-p7"></span>**7.** *And he spoke a parable to those who
were invited.* We know to what an extent ambition prevailed among the
Pharisees and all the scribes. While they desired to exercise a haughty
dominion over all other men, the superiority among themselves was
likewise an object of emulation. It is constantly the case with men who
are desirous of empty applause, that they cherish envy towards each
other, every one endeavoring to draw to himself what others imagine to
be due to them. Thus the Pharisees and scribes, while they were all
equally disposed, in presence of the people, to glory in the title of
holy order, are now disputing among themselves about the degree of
honor, because every one claims for himself the highest place.

<span id="ii.xxxi-p8"></span>This ambition of theirs Christ exposes to
ridicule by an appropriate parable. If any one sitting at another man’s
table were to occupy the highest place, and were afterwards compelled to
give way to a *more honorable* person, it would not be without shame and
dishonor that he was ordered by the master of the feast to take a
different place. But the same thing must happen to all who proudly give
themselves out as superior to others; for God will bring upon them
disgrace and contempt. It must be observed, that Christ is not now
speaking of outward and civil modesty; for we often see that the
haughtiest men excel in this respect, and *civilly*, as the phrase is,
profess great modesty. But by a comparison taken from men, he describes
what we ought to be inwardly before God. “Were it to happen that a guest
should foolishly take possession of the highest place, and should, on
that account, be put down to the lowest, he would be so completely
overpowered with shame as to wish that he had never gone higher. Lest
the same thing should happen to you, that God would punish your
arrogance with the deepest disgrace, resolve, of your own accord, to be
humble and modest.”

<span id="ii.xxxi-p10"></span>**11.** *For every one that exalteth
himself shall be humbled.* This clause makes it evident that ambition
was the subject of which Christ was speaking; for he does not state what
usually happens in the ordinary life of men, but declares that God will
be their Judge, who *resisteth the proud,* and humbleth their
haughtiness, *but giveth grace to the humble,* (<span
id="ii.xxxi-p10.2"></span>[Jas
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md)<span id="ii.xxxi-p10.2"></span>;
<span id="ii.xxxi-p10.3"></span>[1Pe
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005.md)<span id="ii.xxxi-p10.3"></span>;
<span id="ii.xxxi-p10.4"></span>[Ps
138:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.xxxi-p10.4"></span>.) Scripture is full of similar testimonies,
that God is an enemy to all who desire to exalt themselves, as all who
claim for themselves any merit must of necessity make war with Him. It
is a manifestation of pride to boast of the gifts of God, as if there
were any excellence in ourselves, that would exalt us on the ground of
our own merit. Humility, on the other hand, must be not only an
unfeigned abasement, but a real annihilation of ourselves, proceeding
from a thorough knowledge of our own weakness, the entire absence of
lofty pretensions, and a conviction that whatever excellence we possess
comes from the grace of God alone.

<span id="ii.xxxi-p11"></span><span id="ii.xxxi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxi-p12"></span>**12.** *When thou makest a dinner.* Those
who think that this is an absolute condemnation of entertainments given
by relatives and friends to each other, take away a part of civility
from among men. It were not only unfeeling, but barbarous, to exclude
relatives from the hospitable table, and to class them only with
strangers. Christ did not intend to dissuade us from every thing
courteous, but merely to show, that acts of civility, which are
customary among men, are no proof whatever of charity. To perform any
act, in the hope of a reward, to rich men, from whom we expect a similar
return, is not generosity, but a system of commercial exchange; and, in
like manner, kind offices, rendered from mercenary views, are of no
account in the sight of God, and do not deserve to be ascribed to
charity. If I entertain at supper my relatives or rich friends, the act
of civility ought not in itself to be condemned, but, as a proof of
charity, it will have no value whatever; for we frequently see that
persons who are extremely selfish grudge no expense or luxury in
treating their friends. What then? You may spread a table for the rich,
but, at the same time, you must not neglect the poor; you may feast with
your friends and relatives, but you must not shut out strangers, if they
shall happen to be poor, and if you shall have the means of relieving
their wants. In a word, the meaning of the passage is, that those who
are kind to relatives and friends, but are niggardly towards the poor,
are entitled to no commend-ation; because they do not exercise charity,
but consult only their own gain or ambition.

<span id="ii.xxxi-p13"></span>Christ addresses, in a particular manner,
the person who had invited him; because he perceived that he was too
much addicted to pomp and luxury, and was so desirous to obtain the
applause and favor of the rich, that he cared very little about the
poor. Accordingly, in the person of one man, this reproof is directed
against all those who spend their wealth in ambitious display, or who
bargain for mutual compensation, but leave nothing over for the poor, as
if they were afraid that whatever is gratuitously bestowed would be
lost.

<span id="ii.xxxi-p14"></span><span id="ii.xxxi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxi-p15"></span>**14.** *And thou shalt be blessed.*
Christ pronounces those to be *blessed* who exercise liberality without
any expectation of earthly reward; for they manifestly look to God.
Those who constantly keep in view their own advantage, or who are driven
by the gale of popularity, have no right to expect a reward from God.
