his disciples to embark, and to go before him to the opposite bank, till
he had sent away the multitudes. **23**. And when he had sent away the
multitudes, he went up into a mountain alone to pray; and when the
evening came, he was there alone. **24**. But the ship was now in the
midst of the sea, tossed with waves; for the wind was contrary.
**25**. And about the fourth watch of the night Jesus came to them,
walking on the sea. **26**. And when the disciples saw him walking on
the sea, they were terrified, saying, It is an apparition, and cried out
for fear. **27**. But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Take
courage; it is I, be not afraid. **28**. And Peter replying to him said,
Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water. **29**. And he
said, Come. And when Peter had come down out of the ship, he walked on
the water, to go to Jesus. **30**. But when he perceived the wind to be
boisterous, he was afraid; and when he began to sink, he cried, saying,
Lord, save me. **31**. And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and
caught him, and said to him, O man of little faith, why didst thou
doubt? **32**. And when they had entered into the ship, the wind ceased.
**33**. Then they that were in the ship approached and worshipped him,
saying, Truly thou art the Son of God.

<span id="ii.xliii-p5"></span> **45**. And immediately he constrained
his disciples to embark, and to go before him, across the lake, to
Bethsaida, while he sent away the multitude. **46**. And when he had
sent them away, he went into the mountain  <span
id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md) to pray. **47**. And when the evening
came, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the
land. **48**. And he saw that they had difficulty in rowing, (for the
wind was contrary to them;) and about the fourth watch of the night he
came to them, walking on the sea, and intended to pass by them.
**49**. But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought that it
was an apparition, and cried out; **50**. For they all saw him, and were
alarmed. And immediately he spoke to them, and said to them, Take
courage; it is I, be not afraid. **51**. And he went up to them into the
ship, and the wind ceased; and they were greatly astonished within
themselves beyond measure, and wondered. **52**. For they had not
understood about the loaves; for their heart was blinded.  <span

<span id="ii.xliii-p9"></span> 

<span id="ii.xliii-p10"></span><span id="ii.xliii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliii-p11"></span>**<span
id="ii.xliii-p11.2"></span>[Matthew
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.xliii-p11.2"></span>.** *And immediately Jesus constrained his
disciples* They must have been *constrained;* for they would never, of
their own accord, have left him, and gone to the other side. Now in this
they testify their great veneration for him, when, contrary to their own
opinions, they yield to his command and obey it. And, indeed, it had an
appearance of absurdity, that he should remain alone *in a desert
place,* when night was approaching. But so much the greater commendation
is due to the submissiveness of those who set a higher value on the
authority of their heavenly teacher than on all that could be pleaded on
the other side. And, indeed, we do not truly and perfectly obey God,
unless we implicitly follow whatever he commands, though our feelings
may be opposed to it. There is always the best reason, no doubt, for
every thing that God does; but he often conceals it from us for a time,
in order to instruct us not to be wise in ourselves, but to depend
entirely on the expression of his will. And thus Christ *constrained his
disciples* to cross over, in order to train them to that rule of
obedience which I have mentioned; though there cannot be a doubt that he
intended to prepare the way for the miracle which will immediately come
under our consideration.

<span id="ii.xliii-p12"></span><span id="ii.xliii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliii-p13"></span>**23.** *He went up into a mountain
alone.* It is probable that the Son of God, who was fully aware of the
tempest that was coming on, did not neglect the safety of his disciples
in his prayers; and yet we naturally wonder that he did not rather
prevent the danger than employ himself in prayer. But in discharging all
the parts of his office as Mediator, he showed himself to be God and
man, and exhibited proofs of both natures, as opportunities occurred.
Though he had all things at his disposal, he showed himself to be a man
by praying; and this he did not hypocritically, but manifested sincere
and human affection towards us. In this manner his divine majesty was
for a time concealed, but was afterwards displayed at the proper time.

<span id="ii.xliii-p14"></span>In *going up into the mountain* he
consulted his convenience, that he might have more leisure for praying
when removed from all noise. We know how easily the slightest
interruptions destroy the ardor of prayer, or at least make it languish
and cool. Though Christ was in no danger of this fault, yet he intended
to warn us by his example, that we ought to be exceedingly careful to
avail ourselves of every assistance for setting our minds free from all
the snares of the world, that we may look direct towards heaven. Now in
this respect solitude has a powerful influence, by disposing those who
engage in prayer, when God is their only witness, to be more on their
guard, to pour their heart into his bosom, to be more diligent in
self-examination; and, in a word—remembering that they have to do with
God—to rise above themselves. At the same time, it must be observed,
that he did not lay down a fixed rule, as if we were never permitted to
pray except in retirement; for Paul enjoins us to *pray everywhere,
lifting up clean hands,* (<span id="ii.xliii-p14.1"></span>[1Ti
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008)<span id="ii.xliii-p14.1"></span>;.md)
and Christ himself sometimes prayed in presence of others, and even
instructed his disciples to assemble together for offering social
prayer. But that permission to pray in all places does not hinder them
from engaging in secret prayer at proper seasons.

<span id="ii.xliii-p15"></span><span id="ii.xliii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliii-p16"></span>**24.** *The ship was now in the midst of
the sea.* The reader will find this narrative expounded by me at the
sixth chapter of John’s Gospel, and therefore I shall treat it more
briefly here. When Christ permitted his disciples to be tossed about in
a perilous condition, for a time, by an opposing storm, it was to fix
their attention more powerfully on the assistance which he brought to
them. For the adverse wind arose about midnight, or at least a little
before it, and Christ appears *about the fourth watch,* that is, three
hours before sunrise. Their arms were not more fatigued by rowing than
their faith was shaken by grievous terrors. But when they were urged by
strong necessity to desire the presence of their Master, it showed very
extraordinary stupidity to be alarmed at his appearance as if he had
been a ghost.

<span id="ii.xliii-p17"></span>For this reason Mark tells us, that
*their heart was blinded,* and that *they understood not about the
loaves;* for that miracle had given abundant evidence that Christ
possessed divine power to assist his followers, and that he was careful
to assist them, when necessity required. Justly, therefore, are they now
charged with stupidity in not immediately recollecting that heavenly
power, having beheld, on the preceding day, so astonishing a proof of
it, which ought to have been still before their eyes. It is, no doubt,
true, that their blameworthy slowness of apprehension was the reason why
they were astonished; for they had not profited, as they ought to have
done, by other and preceding miracles. But the principal charge brought
against them is *blindness,* in allowing so recent an exhibition to fade
from their memory, or rather in not directing their mind to the
contemplation of Christ’s divinity, of which the multiplication of the
loaves was a sufficiently bright mirror.

<span id="ii.xliii-p18"></span>Two things are expressed by the words of
Mark; first, that they did not properly consider the glory of Christ,
which was exhibited in the multiplication of the loaves; and, secondly,
a reason is assigned, that *their heart was blinded.* This appears to
have been added, not only as an aggravation of their fault, but as a
warning to us respecting the corruption of our understanding, that we
may seek from the Lord new eyes. It certainly was a proof—as I have
lately mentioned—of brutal ignorance, that they did not perceive the
power of God, when they might almost feel it with their hands; but as
the whole human race labors under the same disease, Mark purposely
mentions *blindness,* in order to inform us that it is no new thing if
men have their eyes closed against the manifest works of God, till they
are enlightened from above; as Moses also said,

<span id="ii.xliii-p19"></span>The Lord hath not yet given thee a heart
to understand, (<span id="ii.xliii-p19.1"></span>[De
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.xliii-p19.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xliii-p20"></span>Now though the word *heart* more
frequently denotes the will or the seat of the affections, yet here, as
in that passage which I have now quoted from Moses, it is put for the
understanding.

<span id="ii.xliii-p21"></span><span id="ii.xliii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliii-p22"></span>**27.** *But immediately Jesus spake to
them.* As Christ is not known to be a Deliverer till he actually makes
his appearance, he speaks, and desires his disciples to recognize him.
That confidence, to which he exhorts them, is represented by him as
founded on his presence; plainly implying that, since they perceive him
to be present with them, there are abundant grounds of hope. But as
terror had already overpowered their minds, he corrects that terror,
lest it should hinder or abate their confidence: not that they could all
at once lay aside fear and experience unmingled joy, but because it was
necessary that the fear which had seized them should be allayed, that it
might not destroy their confidence. Although to the reprobate the voice
of the Son of God is deadly, and his presence appalling, yet the effect
which they produce on believers is here described to us as widely
different. They cause inward peace and strong confidence to hold the
sway over our hearts, that we may not yield to carnal fears. But the
reason why we are disturbed by unfounded and sudden alarms is, that our
ingratitude and wickedness prevent us from employing as shields the
innumerable gifts of God, which, if they were turned to proper account,
would give us all necessary support. Now though Christ appeared at the
proper time for rendering assistance, yet the storm did not immediately
cease, till the disciples were more fully aroused both to desire and to
expect his grace. And this deserves our attention, as conveying the
instruction, that there are good reasons why the Lord frequently delays
to bestow that deliverance which he has ready at hand.

<span id="ii.xliii-p23"></span><span id="ii.xliii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliii-p24"></span>**28.** *And Peter answering.* The
condition which he lays down shows that his faith was not yet fully
settled. *If it is thou, says he, bid me come to thee on the water.* But
he had heard Christ speak. Why then does he still argue with himself
under doubt and perplexity? While his faith is so small and weak, a wish
not well considered bursts into a flame. He ought rather to have judged
of himself according to his capacity, and to have supplicated from
Christ an increase of faith, that by its guidance and direction he might
walk over seas and mountains. But now, without the wings of faith, he
desires to fly at will; and though the voice of Christ has not its due
weight in his heart, he desires that the waters should be firm under his
feet. And yet there is no room to doubt that this longing sprung from a
good principle; but as it degenerates into a faulty excess, it cannot be
applauded as good.

<span id="ii.xliii-p25"></span>Hence too it happens that Peter
immediately begins to smart for his rashness. Let believers, therefore,
instructed by his example, beware of excessive haste. Wherever the Lord
calls, we ought to run with alacrity; but whoever proceeds farther, will
learn from the mournful result what it is to overleap the bounds which
the Lord has prescribed. Yet it may be asked, Why does Christ comply
with Peter’s wish? for by so doing he seems to approve of it. But the
answer is obvious. In many eases God promotes our interests better by
refusing our requests; but at times he yields to us, that by experience
we may be the more fully convinced of our own folly. In this manner, it
happens every day that, by granting to those who believe in him more
than is actually needed, he trains them to modesty and sober-mindedness
for the future. Besides, this was of advantage to Peter and to the other
disciples, and it is of advantage to us at the present day. The power of
Christ shone more brightly in the person of Peter, when he admitted him
as a companion, than if he had walked alone on the waters. But Peter
knows, and the rest see plainly, that, when he does not rest with a firm
faith, and rely on the Lord, the secret power of God, which formerly
made the water solid, begins to disappear; and yet Christ dealt gently
with him by not permitting him to sink entirely under the waters.  <span
id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md) Both of these things happen to us; for
as Peter was no sooner seized with fear than he began to sink, so the
fleeting and transitory thoughts of the flesh immediately cause us to
sink in the midst of our course of employments.  <span
id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md) Meanwhile, the Lord indulges our
weakness, and stretches out his hand, that the waters may not swallow us
up altogether. It must also be observed that Peter, when he perceives
the unhappy and painful consequences of his rashness, betakes himself to
the mercy of Christ. And we too, though enduring just punishment, ought
to betake ourselves to him, that he may have compassion on us, and
bestow the aid of which we are unworthy.

<span id="ii.xliii-p28"></span><span id="ii.xliii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliii-p29"></span>**31.** *O man of little faith.* While
our Lord kindly preserves Peter, he does not connive at Peter’s fault.
Such is the object of the chastisement administered, when Peter is
blamed for the weakness of his faith. But a question arises, Does every
kind of fear give evidence of a weakness of faith? for Christ’s words
seem to imply that, where faith reigns, there is no room for doubt.
 <span id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) I reply: Christ reproves here
that kind of doubt which was directly opposed to faith. A man may
sometimes doubt without any fault on his part; and that is, when the
word of the Lord does not speak with certainty on the matter. But the
case was quite different with Peter, who had received an express command
from Christ, and had already experienced his power, and yet leaves that
twofold support, and falls into foolish and wicked fear.

<span id="ii.xliii-p31"></span><span id="ii.xliii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliii-p32"></span>**33.** *They that were in the ship.* I
understand these words to refer not only to the disciples, but to the
sailors and other passengers. So then those who had not yet declared
that he was their Master, instantly acknowledge that he is the Son of
God, and by this term render to him the honor of the Messiah. Though at
that time this lofty *mystery* was not generally known, how *God was* to
be *manifested in the flesh,* (<span id="ii.xliii-p32.2"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.xliii-p32.2"></span>,) yet as they had learned from the prophets,
that he who was to be the Redeemer would be called the Son of God, those
who under this designation proclaim the glory of Christ, declare their
belief that he is the Christ.  <span id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md)
