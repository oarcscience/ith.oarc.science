<span id="ix.ix-p1"></span><span id="ix.ix-p1.1"></span>[Acts
2:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#043.md)<span id="ix.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ix-p2"></span>**43.** And there came fear upon every soul,
and many wonders and signs were wrought by the apostles. **44.** And all
those which believed were joined together, and had all things common.
**45.** And they sold their possessions and substance, and did part them
to all men, as every man had need.

<span id="ix.ix-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.ix-p4"></span><span id="ix.ix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ix-p5"></span>**43.** *And there came.* He signifieth unto
us that the show and sight of the Church was such, that it made others
afraid which did not consent unto \[its\] doctrine; and that was done
for the preserving and furthering of the Church. When there ariseth any
seen all men set themselves stoutly against the same; and as novelty is
odious, the Jews would never have suffered the Church of Christ to stand
one minute of an hour,  <span id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) unless
the Lord had restrained them with fear as with a bridle. Furthermore,
Luke noteth the manner of fear, that it was no such fear as bringeth men
unto the obedience of Christ, but such as causeth men to stand in a
doubt, and so, consequently, doth, as it were, so bind them hand and
foot,  <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) that they dare not hinder
the Lord’s work. Like as there be some at this day who will willingly be
ignorant of the gospel; or, at least, are so holden  <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) with the cares of this world, that
they cannot thoroughly join themselves unto Christ; and yet they are not
so hard-hearted but that they confess that the truth is on our side;
and, therefore, they rest, as it were, in the middle way, neither do
they favor the cruelty of the wicked, because they are afraid to strive
against God. And whereas he saith, *Every soul,* he speaketh thus by
*synecdoche.* For it is certain that many did contemn the hand of God,
and that other some were stricken with no great fear, but that they did
furiously rage together against the Church.  <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) But Luke’s meaning was this, that
there appeared such power of God in the Church, that the people for the
most part had not one word to say.  <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md)

<span id="ix.ix-p11"></span>*And many wonders.* This member serveth also
to the showing of the cause. For the miracles served to make them
afraid, together with other works of God, although this was not the only
reason, but one of many, why they were afraid to set themselves against
God, who was on that side, as they did gather by the miracles; whence we
gather that they are not only profitable for this to bring men to God,
 <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) but also to make the wicked
somewhat more gentle, and that they may tame their furiousness. Pharaoh
was a man of desperate stubbornness, (<span id="ix.ix-p12.2"></span>[Ex
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#008.md)<span id="ix.ix-p12.2"></span>,
etc. 19,) and yet we see how miracles do sometimes pierce his obstinate
heart. He forgetteth them by and by; but when the hand of God is heavy
upon him, he is compelled through fear to yield. To be brief, Luke
teacheth that the Jews were by this means kept back, that the Church,
which might easily have been destroyed, might have got up her head.
 <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) Which thing we have oftentimes
tried  <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) even in our time. And he
doth not only declare that they were bridled with fear, lest they should
be so bold as to attempt so much as they lusted to do hurt to the
Church, but that they were also humbled with reverence to the glory of
the gospel.

<span id="ix.ix-p15"></span><span id="ix.ix-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ix-p16"></span>**44.** *And all* Whereas I have translated
it *joined together,* it is word for word in St Luke, *Into the same, or
into one,* which may be expounded of the place; as if he should have
said that they were wont to dwell together in one place.
Notwithstanding, I had rather understand it of their consent (and
agreement;) as he will say in the fourth chapter, “That they had one
heart,” (<span id="ix.ix-p16.1"></span>[Ac
4:32](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#032)<span id="ix.ix-p16.1"></span>..md)
And so he goeth forward orderly, when, as he beginneth with their mind,
he addeth afterward their bountifulness, as a fruit proceeding thence.
Therefore, he giveth us to understand that they were rightly joined
together with brotherly love amongst themselves, and that they did
indeed declare the same, because the rich men did sell their goods that
they might help the poor. And this is a singular example of love, and
therefore doth Luke record the same, to the end we may know that we must
relieve the poverty of our brethren with our plenty.

<span id="ix.ix-p17"></span>But this place hath need of a sound
exposition, because of fantastical \[fanatical\] spirits, which do feign
a commonalty or participation together of goods, whereby all policy or
civil government is taken away; as in this age the Anabaptists have
raged, because they thought there was no Church unless all men’s goods
were put and gathered together, as it were, in one heap, that they might
all one with another take thereof. Wherefore, we must in this point
beware of two extremes. For many, under color of policy, do keep close
and conceal whatsoever they have; they defraud the poor, and they think
that they are twice righteous, so they take away no other men’s goods.
Other some are carried into the contrary error, because they would have
all things confused. But what doth Luke? Surely he noteth another order,
when he saith that there was choice made in the distribution. If any man
object that no man had any thing which was his own, seeing all things
were common, we may easily answer. For this community or participation
together must be restrained unto the circumstance which ensueth
immediately; to wit, that the poor might be relieved as every man had
need. We know the old proverb, “All things are common amongst friends.”
When as the scholars of Pythagoras said thus, they did not deny but that
every man might govern his own house privately, neither did they intend
to make their own wives common; so this having of things common, whereof
Luke speaketh, and which he commendeth, doth not take away household
government; which thing shall better appear by the fourth chapter,
whereas he nameth two alone which sold their possessions of so many
thousands. Whence we gather that which I said even now, that they
brought forth and made common their goods in no other respect, save only
that they might relieve the present necessity. And the impudency of the
monks was ridiculous, who did profess that they did observe the
apostles’ rule, because they call nothing their own; and yet,
nevertheless, they neither sell any thing, neither yet do they pass for
any man’s poverty;  <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) but they
stuff their idle bellies with the blood of the poor, neither do they
regard any other thing in their having of things common, save only that
they may be well filled and daintily, although all the whole world be
hungry. Wherein, then, are they like to the first disciples, with whom
they will be thought to be able to compare?  <span
