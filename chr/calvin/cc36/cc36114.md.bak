<span id="xx.x-p1"></span><span id="xx.x-p1.1"></span>[Acts
13:46-52](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046.md)<span id="xx.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p2"></span>**46.** And when Paul and Barnabas had taken
liberty, \[or boldness,\] they said, It was necessary that we should.
first preach the word of God to you. And after that ye reject it, and do
not judge yourselves worthy of eternal life, behold, we turn unto the
Gentiles. **47.** For thus hath the Lord commanded us: I have made thee
a light of the Gentiles, that thou mayest be the salvation unto the end
of the earth. **48.** And when the Gentiles heard, they rejoiced, and
glorified the word of the Lord; and they believed, as many as were
ordained unto eternal life. **49.** And the word of the Lord was spread
abroad throughout the whole region. **50.** And the Jews stirred certain
religious and honest women, and the chief men of the city, and they
raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of
their coasts. **51.** And they shaked up the dust of their feet against
them, and came to Iconium. **52.** And the disciples were filled with
joy and with the Holy Ghost.

<span id="xx.x-p3"></span> 

<span id="xx.x-p4"></span><span id="xx.x-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p5"></span>**46.** *When they had taken liberty.* Luke
showeth that the servants of Christ were so far from being discouraged
with the stubbornness of the enemies, that they began, therefore, to
inveigh against them afresh more freely. For though they had sharply
pricked them, yet they did yet spare them a little; but now, when they
see Christ obstinately rejected by them, they  <span
id="fr_831"></span>[832](#fn_831.md) excommunicate them and deprive them of
the kingdom of God. And by this example are we taught that we must not
use extreme severity, save only against those who are quite past hope.
And the more bold the reprobate are to oppress the truth, the more
courage ought we to take to ourselves. For the servants of God must be
armed with invincible constancy of the Spirit, that they may never give
place to the devil, nor to his ministers; as the Lord commandeth
Jeremiah to encounter with the reprobate with a face of iron.

<span id="xx.x-p7"></span>*It was necessary.* He accuseth them of
unthankfulness, because, whereas they were chosen by God out of all
people, that Christ might offer himself unto them, they refuse so great
a benefit maliciously. And in the former member he setteth down the
degree of honor and excellency whereunto God had exalted them; afterward
followeth the upbraiding, because they do willingly cast from them so
great grace; whereupon he concludeth that it is now time that the gospel
be translated unto the Gentiles. In that he saith, that *it was meet
that it should first be preached to them,* it doth properly appertain
unto the time of Christ’s kingdom. For under the law, before Christ was
given, the Jews were not only the first, but alone. Therefore was it
that Moses called them a priestly kingdom, and the peculiar people of
God, (<span id="xx.x-p7.1"></span>[Exod.
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006)<span id="xx.x-p7.1"></span>..md) But
the adoption of God rested then with them alone upon this condition,
(the Gentiles being omitted,) that they should be preferred as yet
before the Gentiles by the coming of Christ. For though Christ
reconciled the world to his Father, yet they were former in order, who
were already near unto God, and of his family. Therefore, that was the
most lawful order, that the apostles should gather the Church first of
the Jews, afterward of the Gentiles, as we saw in the first chapter,
(<span id="xx.x-p7.2"></span>[Ac
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#018)<span id="xx.x-p7.2"></span>,.md) and
in other places, so that the fellowship of the Gentiles did not take
from the Jews the right of the first-begotten, but that they were always
the chief in the Church of God. In this respect Paul saith, that the
righteousness of God is made manifest in the gospel, first to the Jews,
then to the Grecians, (<span id="xx.x-p7.3"></span>[Ro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)<span id="xx.x-p7.3"></span>..md)
Such greatness of grace which God vouchsafed to bestow upon them, doth
exaggerate and increase the greatness of their sin, whilst that they
reject that which is so mercifully offered unto them. Therefore he
addeth that they give judgment of themselves, *that they are unworthy of
eternal life.* For seeing that the rejecting of the gospel is the denial
of the righteousness of God, we need no other judge to condemn the
unbelievers.

<span id="xx.x-p8"></span>*And after that ye reject.* Paul seemeth to
reason unfitly. For, first it was not of necessity that the Jews should
be excluded, that the Gentiles might be admitted unto the hope of
salvation; secondly, this was more convenient, that, after the Jews had
embraced the gospel, they should grant the second place to the Gentiles.
And Paul speaketh in like sort as if they could not grow together into
one body, and as if the gospel could not come unto the Gentiles unless
it were rejected of the Jews. And now was he not ordained to be the
apostle of the Gentiles before he found such stubbornness in the Jews?
 <span id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832.md) I answer, that there is great
force in the words *we are turned* For his meaning is, that he is now
turned away from the Jews, that he may addict and give over himself
wholly to the Gentiles. If they had remained in their degree such
turning had not followed, but he should have drawn the Gentiles also
with a continual course, after that the Jews were received into the
bosom; and he should have embraced them both together, know, forasmuch
as the Jews turn their backs, and withdraw themselves from his ministry,
he cannot look upon them and the Gentiles both at once. Therefore,
taking his leave of them, he is enforced to translate his care unto the
Gentiles. Therefore, unless the Jews had estranged themselves from the
Church, the calling of the Gentiles should have been such as is by the
prophets described: “In that day shall seven strangers take hold of the
cloak of a man that is a Jew, and shall say, we will walk with you;
because God is with you.” But now the Gentiles are called after a new
and accidental manner; because, when the Jews were rejected, they
entered into the empty possession. They ought to have been gathered unto
the Jews; but after that they fell away, and were driven out, they came
in their place. So that their death was the life of the Gentiles, and
the natural branches being cut off, the wild olives were ingrafted into
the holy root, until God do at length restore them also unto life, being
ingrafted into their former root, that the Israel of God being gathered
together from all quarters may be saved.

<span id="xx.x-p10"></span><span id="xx.x-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p11"></span>**47.** *As he hath commanded.* The place is
taken out of Isaiah, where, notwithstanding, God doth rather speak unto
his Son than unto the apostles. But we must note, that many things which
the Scripture attributeth to Christ do appertain unto his ministers. I
say many things; not all things: for there be certain titles proper to
the person of Christ, wherewith to adorn the ministers were wicked
sacrilege. Christ is called our Righteousness, because he was the only
purging sacrifice,  <span id="fr_833"></span>[834](#fn_833.md) and hath
reconciled the Father to us by his death, and did rise again afterward,
that, having overcome death, he might purchase for us eternal life.
Therefore the whole substance of our salvation is in Christ’s person;
but inasmuch as he worketh by his ministers, by resigning to them his
office, he doth also impart with \[to\] them his titles. Of this sort is
the preaching of the gospel. He alone was appointed by the Father to be
our teacher; but he hath put in his place pastors and doctors, who
speak, as it were, out of his mouth. So that the authority remaineth
wholly to him, and he is nevertheless heard in his ministers. Therefore
Paul doth fitly apply unto himself the testimony of Isaiah, where he
intreateth of the preaching of the gospel.

<span id="xx.x-p13"></span>*I have made thee a light.* It should seem
that he speaketh in that place of such a calling of the Gentiles as doth
not carry with it the casting off of the old people. For God doth rather
associate strangers unto the Jews, who were before of the household. It
is but a small matter, saith he, that thou be my minister in teaching
Israel, because I have made thee a light to the Gentiles. God doth seem
to begin his Church among the children of Abraham, and, that done, to
reach out his hand to the Gentiles, that they may both make one Church
by one consent of faith. But Paul doth in such sort cite the prophecy,
as if it could not be fulfilled unless the Jews had been cast off. For
he signifieth that the light of Christ was lighted to the Gentiles,
after that they were cast into the darkness of death. I answer, that
this cannot be necessarily proved out of the text, that Paul doth affirm
that the Gentiles could not have been illuminated before the light of
the Jews had been put out. For this may be the sense, Forasmuch as you
have deprived yourselves of eternal life, there is no cause why ye
should think that the grace of God is profaned, if, leaving you, we take
care and charge of the Gentiles; for the Messiah is not given to you
alone, but he is appointed to be the Savior of the whole world; as it is
written, “I have made thee,” etc.; although, if you weigh the place of
the prophet more thoroughly, you shall find the casting off of the old
people included therein. For God pronounceth that he will be glorious
and renowned in the ministry of Christ, though Israel be not gathered
together. He addeth afterward, by way of exposition, that the power of
Christ shall not be restrained unto one people only, because his light
shall shed abroad his beams unto the farthest parts of the world unto
salvation. It seemeth that Paul noteth this occasion of calling the
Gentiles, namely, because, seeing he found no matter to exercise himself
in among the Jews, he gave himself wholly to the Gentiles. We must note
this by the way, in the words of the prophet, that salvation is put
after light, according to that saying of Christ,

<span id="xx.x-p14"></span>“This is eternal life, to know thee, the true
God,” etc.  
(<span id="xx.x-p14.2"></span>[Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003)<span id="xx.x-p14.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xx.x-p15"></span>For if the knowledge of God alone bring to us
salvation, it is likewise the only resurrection from destruction of
eternal death, for us to be illuminated into the faith of Christ, after
that we be delivered from the darkness of ignorance.

<span id="xx.x-p16"></span><span id="xx.x-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p17"></span>**48.** *And when the Gentiles heard.* The
matter of the Gentiles’ joy was this, \[viz.\] when they heard that they
were not called to salvation at a sudden, as if this had not been
decreed before by God, but that that is now at length fulfilled which
was foretold many years before. For doubtless it was small confirmation
of their faith, because salvation was promised to them by the coming of
Christ, whereby it did also come to pass that they did with more earnest
desire and reverence embrace the gospel. To *glorify* the word of God
may be expounded two manner of ways, either that they did confess that
it was true which was prophesied by Isaiah, or that they embraced the
doctrine which was set before them with faith. Assuredly there is a full
subscription noted out, because they dispute or doubt no longer, so soon
as they saw that Paul had gotten the victory. And surely we do then
honor the word of God as we ought, when we submit ourselves obediently
to it by faith; as it cannot be more grievously blasphemed than when men
refuse to believe it. And here we see how the Gentiles were not
hindered, by that stubbornness which they saw in the Jews, from giving
their name to Christ. With like courage  <span
id="fr_834"></span>[835](#fn_834.md) must we despise and tread under foot
the pride of the wicked, when, by their obstinacy, they study to stop
the way before us.

<span id="xx.x-p19"></span>*And they believed.* This is an exposition of
the member next going before, at least in my judgment.: For Luke showeth
what manner \[of\] glory they gave to the word of God. And here we must
note the restraint, \[reservation,\] when he saith that they believed,
(but) not all in general, but those who were ordained unto life. And we
need not doubt but that Luke calleth those <span
id="xx.x-p19.1"></span>τεταγμενους, who were chosen by the free adoption
of God. For it is a ridiculous cavil to refer this unto the affection of
those which believed, as if those received the gospel whose minds were
well-disposed. For this ordaining must be understood of the eternal
counsel of God alone. Neither doth Luke say that they were ordained unto
faith, but unto life; because the Lord doth predestinate his unto the
inheritance of eternal life. And this place teacheth that faith
dependeth upon God’s election. And assuredly, seeing that the whole race
of mankind is blind and stubborn, those diseases stick fast in our
nature until they be redressed by the grace of the Spirit, and that
redressing floweth from the fountain of election alone. For in that of
two which hear the same doctrine together,  <span
id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835.md) the one showeth himself apt to be
taught, the other continueth in his obstinacy. It is not, therefore,
because they differ by nature, but because God doth lighten \[illumine\]
the former, and doth not vouchsafe the other the like grace. We are,
indeed, made the children of God by faith; as faith, as touching us, is
the gate and the first beginning of salvation; but there is a higher
respect of God. For he doth not begin to choose us after that we
believe; but he sealeth his adoption, which was hidden in our hearts, by
the gift of faith, that it may be manifest and sure. For if this be
proper to the children of God alone to be his disciples, it followeth
that it doth not appertain unto all the children of Adam in general. No
marvel, therefore, if all do not receive the gospel;  <span
id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836.md) because, though our heavenly Father
inviteth all men unto the faith by the external voice of man, yet doth
he not call effectually by his Spirit any save those whom he hath
determined to save. Now, if God’s election, whereby he ordaineth us unto
life, be the cause of faith and salvation, there remaineth nothing for
worthiness or merits.

<span id="xx.x-p22"></span>Therefore, let us hold and mark that which
Luke saith, that those were ordained before unto life, who, being
in-grafted into the body of Christ by faith, do receive the earnest and
pledge of their adoption in Christ. Whence we do also gather what force
the preaching of the gospel hath of itself. For it doth not find faith
in men, save only because God doth call those inwardly whom he hath
chosen, and because he draweth those who were his own before unto
Christ, (<span id="xx.x-p22.1"></span>[Joh
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037)<span id="xx.x-p22.1"></span>..md)
Also Luke teacheth in the same words, that it cannot be that any of the
elect should perish. For he saith not that one or a few of the elect did
believe, but so many as were elect. For though God’s election  <span
id="fr_837"></span>[838](#fn_837.md) be unknown to us until we perceive it
by faith, yet is it not doubtful or in suspense in his secret counsel;
because he commendeth all those whom he counteth his to the safeguard
and tuition of his Son, who will continue a faithful keeper even unto
the end. Both members are necessary to be known. When election is placed
above faith, there is no cause why men should challenge to themselves
any thing in any part of their salvation. For if faith, wherein
consisteth salvation, which is unto us a witness of the free adoption of
God, which coupleth us to Christ, and maketh his life ours, whereby we
possess God with his righteousness, and, finally, whereby we receive the
grace of sanctification, be grounded without us in the eternal counsel
of God; what good things so ever we have, we must needs acknowledge that
we have received it of the grace of God, which doth prevent us of its
own accord. Again, because many entangle themselves in doubtful and
thorny imaginations, whilst that they seek for their salvation in the
hidden counsel of God, let us learn that the election of God is
therefore approved by faith, that our minds may be turned unto Christ as
unto the pledge of election, and that they may seek no other certainty
save that which is revealed to us in the gospel; I say, let this seal
suffice us, that

<span id="xx.x-p24"></span>“whosoever believeth in the only-begotten Son
of God hath eternal life,”  
(<span id="xx.x-p24.2"></span>[Joh
3:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#036)<span id="xx.x-p24.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xx.x-p25"></span><span id="xx.x-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p26"></span>**49.** *The word of the Lord was spread
abroad.* Luke doth in this place declare the proceeding  <span
id="fr_838"></span>[839](#fn_838.md) of the gospel; wherein appeareth how
true the parable of Christ is, when he saith that it is like to leaven,
(<span id="xx.x-p27.2"></span>[Lu
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#021)<span id="xx.x-p27.2"></span>..md)
We heard before that there was great concourse of people, so that the
seed of true doctrine was sown throughout the whole city. Luke saith now
that it was spread farther, to wit, throughout the whole country.

<span id="xx.x-p28"></span><span id="xx.x-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p29"></span>**50.** Nevertheless, he declareth that that
was done not without great pains and trouble. Therefore, the beginning
of the calling of the Gentiles was joyful and prosperous, neither could
Satan hinder the course of the grace of God; but in the mean season, it
stood Paul and Barnabas upon (whom God had brought forth into the field
 <span id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839) .md) to strive. And we must mark
what Luke saith, that the religious and honest women, together with the
chief men of the city, were enforced to persecute the servants of
Christ. For this was no small offense to the rude, and those who were as
yet scarce begotten in Christ, when they saw all those men and women
which were of any account or estimation set against Christ, and also
whatsoever was praise-worthy according to men. A great multitude of men
received Christ, but it was but the multitude and the offscourings of
men. Against them were set the chief men of the city, who with their
pomp did easily oppress the base and obscure multitude. That might also
cause doctrine to be suspected, yea, to be hated, in that godly and
honest matrons to look to were enemies to it. If wicked, ungodly, and
mischievous men should have issued out of their taverns and dens; if
companies of whores should break out of their brothel-house, it should
be no reproach to the gospel; yea, rather the dignity thereof should
thereby appear more plainly; but now, what may the weak think with
themselves, but that the doctrine which hath such adversaries is not of
God? Therefore it was expedient that not only the faithful, who were as
yet weak, should be confirmed by the Lord, lest their faith should fall,
but also that the hand should be reached out to Paul and Barnabas, lest,
being discouraged, they should leave off.

<span id="xx.x-p31"></span>And by this example the Lord meant to teach
us that we must valiantly resist such lets;  <span
id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840.md) and that we must beware lest the vain
visors of virtue  <span id="fr_841"></span>[842](#fn_841.md) do blind our
eyes, so that we cannot see the glory of Christ which shineth in the
gospel. For it is certain that all that virtue and honesty which is in
men is mere hypocrisy where they set themselves against. Christ; though
it may be that those who are rashly carried against Christ for a time
may afterwards repent. Notwithstanding, we must thus think with
ourselves, that whatsoever fair show of holiness those bear who resist
the gospel, they are neither endued with the perfect fear of God,
neither are they any thing else but a vain shadow, how greatly soever
they boast of their virtue. Neither is it without cause that Christ hath
this title given him, that he revealeth the cogitations of many hearts,
(<span id="xx.x-p33.2"></span>[Lu
2:35](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#035)<span id="xx.x-p33.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xx.x-p34"></span>*Religious.* And what manner \[of\] religion
could that be where there was no reverence of the Word of God? We must
note that there be four kinds of men: as there be few which worship God
sincerely and from the heart, so there be few who openly profess the
manifest and gross contempt of him. These be two sorts. And the more
part is neither quite without religion, neither is it altogether void of
the common worship of God; but yet, notwithstanding, whilst they do
coldly, and, as it were, overfields  <span
id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842.md) play with God, if they be thoroughly
examined they be but profane; like as, at this day, the ungodliness of
many is after a sort shrouded under ceremonies, and the reigned
profession of the worship of God. So that in all ages there have been
certain worshippers of God who have worshipped him like stage-players,
 <span id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843.md) whose holiness did wholly
consist in gestures and vain pomps. In Paul’s time, even as at this day,
a peculiar study of godliness was to be found in a few, whose religion,
though it were impure, and their heart reigned, deceitful, and double,
yet are they counted after a sort religious, in respect of their zeal.
But hereby appeareth what account we may make of bare religion, which
driveth headlong, through unadvised heat, the professors thereof, to
resist the kingdom of God, and to oppress his glory. Furthermore, it is
to be thought that though these matrons had not altogether given their
name to Judaism, neither had they been nousled  <span
id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844.md) in the doctrine of the law, yet were
they half Jewesses, and that was the cause that they did so willingly
take upon them the defense of the nation. For thus are women led about
captive, being laden with sins, as Paul witnesseth.

<span id="xx.x-p38"></span><span id="xx.x-p38.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p39"></span>**51.** *When they had shaken of the dust of
their feet.* We may also gather, even by the commandment of Christ,
(<span id="xx.x-p39.1"></span>[Mt
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#014.md)<span id="xx.x-p39.1"></span>;
<span id="xx.x-p39.2"></span>[Luke
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#005.md), [Luke
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#011)<span id="xx.x-p39.2"></span>,.md)
that this was a token of cursing among the Jews. For it is not to be
thought that Christ meant to have his \[disciples\] use an unknown sign,
forasmuch as it was his purpose to terrify the gross and professed
condemners of his doctrine. Furthermore, he meant by this means to
declare that God doth so detest the wicked, that we must take meat heed
that we have no fellowship with them, lest we be infected with their
uncleanness. All the wicked are said, indeed, to pollute the ground
whereon they tread; but the Lord did never command that any, save only
the condemners of his word, should be so rejected with such execration.
If any adulterer or whoremonger, if any perjured person, if any
drunkard,  <span id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845.md) were to be
excommunicate, this sign was not used. Therefore, it appeareth how
intolerable the contempt of the word of God is in his sight; because,
when as he commandeth that the dust of the feet be shaken off, it is as
much as if he should pronounce that they are the bond-slaves of Satan,
men past hope, and worthy to be banished  <span
id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846.md) from off the earth. Wherefore, let
this so great;, severity teach us to reverence the gospel. Also the
ministers of the word are taught with how great ferventness of zeal they
must maintain the majesty of the word, that they do not coldly dissemble
and wink at the contempt thereof.

<span id="xx.x-p43"></span><span id="xx.x-p43.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p44"></span>**52.** *The disciples were filled with joy*
This member may be expounded two manner of ways; That they were filled
with joy and the Spirit, by *hypallage,* thus, With joy of the Spirit,
or (which is all one) with spiritual joy; because there is no quietness,
peace, or joy of conscience, but it cometh of the Spirit of God, in
which respect Paul saith that the kingdom of God is righteousness,
peace, and joy in the Spirit, (<span id="xx.x-p44.1"></span>[Ro
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017)<span id="xx.x-p44.1"></span>;.md)
or that the word *Spirit* may contain under it other virtues and gifts.
Yet this pleaseth me better, that they were filled with joy; because the
grace of the Holy Spirit reigned in them, which alone doth so make us
glad, truly and perfectly, that we are carried up above the whole world.
For we must mark Luke’s drift, that the faithful were so far from being
troubled and shaken with those stumbling-blocks, how great soever they
were, with the reproach of their teachers, with the disquieting of the
city, with terrors and threatenings, also with fear and dangers hanging
over their heads, that they did with the loftiness of their faith
despise valiantly the gorgeousness, as well of their reigned holiness as
of their power. And assuredly, if our faith shall be well grounded in
God, and shall be thoroughly rooted in his word; and, finally, if’ it
shall be well fortified with the aid of the Spirit as it, ought, it;
shall nourish peace and joy spiritual in our minds, though all the world
be in an uproar.
