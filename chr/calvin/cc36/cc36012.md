<span id="viii.v-p1"></span><span id="viii.v-p1.1"></span>[Acts
1:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#012.md)<span id="viii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p2"></span>**12.** Then they returned unto Jerusalem
from the mountain which is called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem,
being distant about a Sabbath-day’s journey. **13.** And, coming in,
they went up into an upper chamber, where abode Peter and James, John
and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of
Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. **14.**
These all abode together with one accord in prayer and supplication,
with the wives, (or women,) and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his
brethren.

<span id="viii.v-p3"></span> 

<span id="viii.v-p4"></span><span id="viii.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p5"></span>**12.** That he may pass over unto another
history, he showeth that the disciples being returned unto Jerusalem,
dwelt together in one parlor. For it was the upper part of the house,
which used to be let out unto those which did hire houses;  <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) for the most commodious places were
reserved unto them that were masters of the house, (for their own use.)
Wherefore, by this word Luke doth signify that they were driven into a
strait room;  <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) and yet,
notwithstanding, though this commodity were great, yet they did not part
asunder. They might have been more commodiously asunder, yet might they
not part company before they had received the Spirit. In that he noteth
here the distance of place, it bringeth credit unto the history. Unless,
peradventure, he meant hereby to declare that they were not terrified
with any fear of danger, but that they did all return and kept company
together in one house, which was not so large, but that the company
being greater than the place could well contain, it might breed some
rumor (or noise.) A Sabbath-day’s journey was two miles, and that
account doth well agree with the place of <span
id="viii.v-p7.2"></span>[Joh
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#018.md)<span id="viii.v-p7.2"></span>,
where he saith, “that Jerusalem was distant from Bethany almost fifteen
furlongs;” which containeth about a thousand and nine hundred paces. And
the mount Olivet was at the side of Bethany. There was no Sabbath-day’s
journey prescribed in the law; for the Lord doth command them simply to
rest upon the Sabbath-day in the law.  <span
id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) But because the Jews could not easily be
ruled, but that they would run abroad about their business upon the
Sabbath-day, (as the Lord himself doth complain, “that they did bear
burdens out at the gates,”) (<span id="viii.v-p8.1"></span>[Jer
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#024)<span id="viii.v-p8.1"></span>,.md)
therefore, it is to be thought that it was determined by the priests,
 <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) (to the end they might restrain
such enormities,) that no man should travel upon the Sabbath-day above
two miles. Although Jerome, in his Answers unto Algasia, doth say that
this tradition did come from two Rabbins, namely, from Atriba, and from
Simon Heli.

<span id="viii.v-p10"></span><span id="viii.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p11"></span>**13.** *Where they abode* Some translate
it, *where they did abide;* as though they did use to dwell there. But I
am of that opinion, that they did then first of all use that hired room
to dwell together in, until such time as the Holy Spirit was come upon
them. Too, too ridiculous are the Papists, which go about to prove Peter
his supremacy  <span id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) hereby, because he
is reckoned up first of all the apostles. Although we do grant that he
was the chiefest of the apostles, yet it doth not follow hereupon that
he was the chiefest ruler of all the world. But if he be, therefore, the
chief of all the apostles, because his name is first in the catalogue of
the apostles’ names, I will again conclude, that the mother of Christ
was inferior unto all the rest of the women, because she is \[here\]
reckoned the last; which they will in no case admit, as indeed it were a
thing too absurd. Wherefore, unless they will set their Papacy to be
laughed at of all men, as hitherto they have done, they must leave off
to adorn it with such foolish toys. But what is their intent? Forsooth,
they will prove out of the Scriptures that there was a secondary head of
the Church, inferior to Christ; whereas there is no syllable in the
Scripture which is consenting unto this their foolish invention. No
marvel is it, therefore, if they do snatch here and there certain
places, which, although no man smite them out of their hands, they will
let fall of their own accord. But omitting them, let us mark what is
Luke’s purpose in this place. Because the disciples had fallen away, and
filthily fled from their Master Christ, every man whither fear did drive
him, (<span id="viii.v-p12.2"></span>[Mt
26:56](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#056)<span id="viii.v-p12.2"></span>,.md)
they did deserve, like forsakers of their masters, or run-agates, to be
deprived of honor. Therefore, that we may know that by the appointment
of the Lord they were gathered together again, and restored to their
former degree, Luke reckoneth up all their names.

<span id="viii.v-p13"></span><span id="viii.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p14"></span>**14.** *With their wives* Some translate
it *women;* and they think that he speaketh of those which accompanied
Christ. As I will not contend with any man concerning this matter, so
have I not doubted to prefer that which I thought was more probable. I
grant that the word which Luke useth may be interpreted both ways. But
this is my reason, why I do think that he speaketh rather of wives,
because, seeing that they used afterward to carry their wives about with
them, as Paul doth testify, (<span id="viii.v-p14.1"></span>[1Co
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005)<span id="viii.v-p14.1"></span>,.md)
it is not likely that they were then asunder. For they might more easily
rest together in one place, than by wandering to and fro oftentimes to
change their abiding; and, secondly, seeing that they did look for the
coming of the Holy Ghost, which was even then at hand, what reason was
there why they should deprive their wives of so great goodness? Peter’s
wife was about to be a helper unto him shortly after, which we must also
think of the rest of the wives. These women had need of heroical
fortitude and constancy, lest they should faint. Who would, therefore,
think that they were excluded from their husbands whilst they look for
the coming of the Spirit? But if they will stick to the general word, it
standeth with reason that there were married women in the company.
Howsoever it be, it is Luke’s mind to tell us by the way how greatly
they had changed their minds.  <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) For
whereas before the men, being afraid, had fled away, the women are
gathered together with them now, neither do they fear any danger. He
doth reckon up the mother of Jesus with the other women, whom,
notwithstanding, John is said to have kept at his own house. But, as I
have said before, they met altogether now only for a short season; for
it is not to be doubted but that they departed one from another
afterwards. It is well known that amongst the Hebrews all kinsfolk are
comprehended under this word *brethren.*

<span id="viii.v-p16"></span>*All these did continue.* Here he showeth
that they did diligently look for the coming of the Holy Spirit.; For
this was the cause of their prayer, that Christ would send his Spirit,
as he had promised. Whereupon we may gather that this is the true faith
which stirreth us up to call upon God. For the security of faith doth
much differ from sluggishness. Neither doth God, therefore, assure us of
this grace, that our minds may straightway become careless, but that he
may rather sharpen our desire to pray. Neither is prayer any sign of
doubting, but rather a testimony of our (sure hope and) confidence,
because we ask those things at the Lord’s hands which we know he hath
promised. So it becometh us also (after their example) to be instant in
prayer,  <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) and to beg at God’s hands
that he will increase in us his Holy Spirit:  <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52) increase, (I say,.md) because before we can
conceive any prayer we must needs have the first-fruits of the Spirit.
For as much as he is the only Master which teacheth us to pray aright,
who doth not only give us utterance, (<span id="viii.v-p18.2"></span>[Ro
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025)<span id="viii.v-p18.2"></span>,.md)
but also governs our inward affections.

<span id="viii.v-p19"></span>Furthermore, Luke doth express two things
which are proper to true prayer, namely, that they did persist, and that
they were all of one mind. This was art exercise of their patience, in
that Christ did make them stay a while,  <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) when as he could straightway have sent
the Holy Spirit; so God doth oftentimes drive off,  <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) and, as it were, suffer us to languish,
that he may accustom us to persevere. The hastiness of our petitions is
a corrupt, yea a hurtful plague; wherefore it is no marvel if God do
sometimes correct the same. In the mean season (as I have said) he doth
exercise us to be constant in prayer. Therefore, if we will not pray in
vain, let us not be wearied with the delay of time. As touching the
unity of their minds, it is set against that scattering abroad, which
fear had caused before. Yet, notwithstanding, we may easily gather, even
by this, how needful a thing it is to pray generally, in that Christ
commandeth every one to pray for the whole body, and generally for all
men, as it were, in the person of all men: Our Father, Give us this day,
etc., (<span id="viii.v-p21.2"></span>[Mt
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#009)<span id="viii.v-p21.2"></span>..md)
Whence cometh this unity of their tongues but from one Spirit?
Wherefore, when Paul would prescribe unto the Jews and Gentiles a right
form of prayer, he removeth far away all division and dissension. That
we *may,* (saith he,) being all of one mind, with one mouth glorify God,
(<span id="viii.v-p21.3"></span>[Ro
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#006)<span id="viii.v-p21.3"></span>..md)
And truly it is needful that we be brethren, and agree together like
brethren, that we rightly call God Father.
