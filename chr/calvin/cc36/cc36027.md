<span id="x.i-p1"></span><span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>[Acts
3:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#001.md)<span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p2"></span>**1.** Now, \[or almost at that time,\] Peter
and John went up together into the temple, about the ninth hour of
prayer. **2.** Furthermore, a certain man, which was lame from his
mother’s womb, was carried; whom they laid daily at the gate of the
temple which is called Beautiful, that he might ask alms of those which
entered into the temple. **3.** When he saw Peter and John draw near to
the temple, he asked an alms. **4.** And Peter, beholding him earnestly
with John, said, Look on us. **5.** And he gave heed unto them, thinking
that he should receive somewhat of them. **6.** And Peter said, Silver
and gold have I none; but such as I have, give I thee: In the name of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk. **7.** And when he had taken
him by the right hand, he lifted him up, and immediately his feet and
ankle-bones received strength. **8.** And leaping up he stood, and
walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and
praising God. **9.** And all the people saw him walking, and praising
God. **10.** And they knew him, that it was he which was wont to sit for
the alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple. And they were filled with
wondering, and were astonied at that thing which was come unto him.
**11.** Moreover, when the lame man which was healed held Peter and
John, all the people ran amazed unto them, into the Porch which is
called Solomon’s.

<span id="x.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="x.i-p4"></span><span id="x.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p5"></span>**1.** We saw before that many signs were
showed by the hands of the apostles; now Luke reciteth one of many for
example’s sake, after his common custom; namely, that a lame man, which
was lame of his feet from his mother’s womb, was perfectly restored to
his limbs. And he doth diligently gather all the circumstances which
serve to set forth the miracle. If it had been that his legs had been
out of joint, or if it had been some disease coming by some casualty, it
might have been the more easily cured. But the default of nature  <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) could not have been so easily
redressed. When as he saith that he was carried, we gather thereby that
it was no light halting, but that this man did lie as if his legs had
been dead. Forasmuch as he was wont daily to ask alms, hereby all the
people might the better know him. In that being healed, he walked in the
temple at the time of prayer, this served to spread abroad the fame of
the miracle. Furthermore, this doth not a little set forth the same,
that being lifted up and set upon his feet, he leapeth up therewithal,
and walketh joyfully.

<span id="x.i-p7"></span>*Went up together* Because these words, <span
id="x.i-p7.1"></span>επι το αυτο, doth no more signify place than time,
this latter sense seemeth better to agree with the text of Peter, yet,
because it is of no great importance, I leave it indifferent. That it is
called the ninth hour of prayer, when as the day began to draw towards
night.  <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) For seeing the day from
the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof had twelve hours, as I
have said elsewhere, all that time was divided into four parts. So that
by the ninth is meant the last portion of the day; as the first hour did
continue unto the third, the third unto the sixth, the sixth unto the
ninth. Hence may we gather, by a probable conjecture, that that hour was
appointed for the evening sacrifice. Furthermore, if any man ask,
whether the apostles went up into the temple that they might pray
according to the rite of the law, I do not think that that is a thing so
likely to be true, as that they might have better opportunity to spread
abroad the gospel. And if any man will abuse this place, as if it were
lawful for us to use and take up superstitious worshippings, whilst that
we are conversant amongst the ignorant and weak, his reason shall be
frivolous. The Lord appointed that the Jews should offer sacrifice
morning and evening, (<span id="x.i-p8.2"></span>[Ex
29:41](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#041)<span id="x.i-p8.2"></span>..md) By
this exercise were they taught to begin and end the day with calling
upon the name of God, and with worshipping him,  <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) (<span id="x.i-p9.2"></span>[Nu
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#002)<span id="x.i-p9.2"></span>..md)
Therefore Peter and John might freely come into the temple, which was
consecrated to God; neither did they pollute themselves, seeing they
called upon the God of Israel, that they might thereby declare their
godliness. First, in that the Lord would have the older people to
observe the appointed hours,  <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) we
gather thereby that the Church cannot be without certain discipline. And
even at this day, were it profitable for us to have such meetings daily,
unless our too \[too\] much sluggishness did let us. And whereas the
apostles go up at that hour, hereby we gather that we must foreslow
\[neglect\] no opportunity that is offered us for the furtherance of the
gospel.

<span id="x.i-p11"></span><span id="x.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p12"></span>**3.** *He asketh an alms.* We see how God
restored this lame man to his limbs contrary to his expectation. Because
he thought that his disease was incurable, he was only careful for
maintenance. That is given him which he durst never have asked. In like
sort God doth oftentimes prevent us, neither doth he stay until he be
provoked.  <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) And hence can we not
gather any occasion of slothfulness, as if the Lord did therefore meet
us of his own accord, that being idle and slothful we may suffer the
Lord to do good unto us. For we are commanded to pray, and therefore let
us not foreslow \[neglect\] our duty.  <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) But, first of all, under the person of
the lame man, we have set before us an example of a man that is not yet
illuminated by faith, that he may know how to pray aright. Such doth God
prevent, as it is needful, even of his own accord. Therefore, when as he
restoreth our souls not only to health, but also to life, he himself is
to himself the cause hereof. For this is the beginning of our calling,
that he may make those things to be which are not; that he may show
himself unto those who seek not after him, (<span
id="x.i-p14.2"></span>[Ro 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md)<span
id="x.i-p14.2"></span>.) Furthermore, howsoever we be already taught by
faith to pray unto God, yet, because we do not always feel our miseries,
it cometh not into our mind to seek for remedy; therefore the Lord
bringeth the same freely and unlooked for. Finally, howsoever we be bent
to pray, yet doth he exceed our hope and petitions with his goodness.

<span id="x.i-p15"></span><span id="x.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p16"></span>**4.** *Look upon us.* Peter doth not thus
speak before he be certain of the purpose and intent of God. And surely
in these words he commandeth him to hope for some singular and unwonted
benefit; yet here may a question be moved, whether they had power to
work miracles so often as they would? I answer, that they were ministers
of God’s power in such sort, that they did attempt nothing of their own
will or proper motion, but the Lord wrought by them, when he knew that
it was expedient it should be so. Hereby it came to pass that they
healed one and not all. Therefore, as in other things, they had the
Spirit of God to be their guide and director, so also in this point.
Therefore, before such time as Peter commandeth the lame man to arise,
he did east and fasten his eyes upon him; this steadfast looking upon
him was not without some peculiar motion of the Spirit. Hereby it cometh
to pass that he speaketh so surely (and safely, without all fear) of the
miracle. Furthermore, he meant by this word to provoke the lame man to
receive the grace of God; yet doth he look for nothing but for an alms.

<span id="x.i-p17"></span><span id="x.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p18"></span>**6.** *Silver and gold.* Peter doth truly
excuse himself, that he doth want that help which the lame man did
require. And therefore doth he declare, that if he were able to relieve
his poverty he would willingly do it; like as every man ought to
consider with himself what the Lord hath given him, that he may
therewith help his neighbors. For what store soever God giveth to every
man, he will have the same to be an instrument and help to exercise
love. Therefore he saith, that he giveth that which he hath. This was at
the first a trick of mockage,  <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md)
in that Peter beginneth to speak of his poverty, after that he had
brought the lame man into a rare hope, as if he meant to mock a gaping
crow; but he comforteth him immediately, to the end the miracle might be
had in greater estimation by the comparison. That is horrible
wickedness, in that the Pope, when as he is created, doth most
unshamefastly \[shamelessly\] abuse this place, making thereof a
comical, or rather a scoffing play. There be two cells, or places made
of stone, in the one whereof when he sitteth, and the people ask an
alms, using these words of Peter, he casteth abroad crosses in the air
with his fingers. When he is brought into the next tell, or place, he
hath bags full of money. Then his angels cry unto him,

<span id="x.i-p20"></span>“He hath dispersed, he hath given to the
poor,”  
(<span id="x.i-p20.2"></span>[Ps
112:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa112.htm#009)<span id="x.i-p20.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.i-p21"></span>I have made mention hereof, to the end all men
may see that Satan doth questionless reign there, where they do so
manifestly mock the sacred Word of God. And to the end I may return unto
the former sentence, it is evident enough that Peter was instructed by a
certain and sure revelation, when as he saith that he hath the gift of
healing.

<span id="x.i-p22"></span>*In the name of Jesus.* He saith that this is
the work and benefit of Christ, that he restoreth to the cripple the use
of his feet, for *name* is taken for power and empire, or government.
Neither must we dream that there is any magical force in the sounding or
pronouncing of the word, as the Jews do dote about the word Jehovah. To
be short, Peter meant to declare that he was nothing but a minister, and
that Christ was the author of the miracle. For this ought to have been,
and was his care, that Christ might be made known unto the world, and
that his name might be sanctified. But why doth he give Christ this
epithet, or title, *of Nazareth?* I leave to other men their own
judgment; but I think thus: Forasmuch as Christ was thus called in
contempt, Peter meant of set purpose to express that that Jesus of
Nazareth whom they had crucified, and whose name was despised and
without glory amongst the Jews, and was to the most of them detestable,
was nevertheless the Messias promised of God, and that all power was
given unto him of the rather; as Paul saith, that he preacheth Christ
and him crucified, (<span id="x.i-p22.1"></span>[1Co
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002)<span id="x.i-p22.1"></span>..md)

<span id="x.i-p23"></span>*Arise and walk.* This might seem to be a very
ridiculous thing. For the cripple might have readily objected, Why hast
thou not first given me legs and feet? For this is a plain mock, when as
thou biddest a man without feet to go. But he believed Peter’s words;
and he, which was at the first so slow, doth now with a ready and joyful
mind embrace God’s benefit. Whereby appeareth both the force of the
word, and also the fruit of faith. The force of the word is double, both
in that the cripple is so touched that he doth forthwith obey without
delay; and in that it giveth strength to his dead members, and doth,
after a sort, renew the man. And faith also hath her reward, in that the
cripple obeyeth him which commandeth him to rise not in vain. Therefore
we see how God worketh by his Word, to wit, when he giveth success to
the preaching thereof, that it may pierce into the minds of men;
secondly, when he giveth those things with his hand which are promised
there. Moreover, he suffereth not faith to be void, but she doth indeed
truly enjoy all those good things which she looketh for, and which are
offered unto her in the same Word. And we must remember that which I
have already said, that we have in this history a type  <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) or figure of our spiritual restoring;
namely, that as the Word, laid hold on by faith, did restore the cripple
to his limbs, so the Lord pierceth into our souls by the Word, that he
may restore the same. And, first of all, he speaketh by man’s mouth, and
pricketh us forward by the obedience of faith; that done, he moveth our
hearts inwardly by his Spirit, that the Word may take lively root in us;
finally, he reacheth out his hand, and by all means he finisheth his
work in us. We gather out of Matthew that miracles must be thus handled.

<span id="x.i-p25"></span><span id="x.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p26"></span>**9.** *And all the people saw.* He beginneth
now to declare the fruit of the miracle, to wit, that the cripple began
to show his thankfulness by praising God, and that all the people were
brought into great wondering. And here is a double fruit. For he which
was healed doth acknowledge and set forth the benefit of God; on the
other side, the people is moved, and the fame is spread abroad, many
come to see it. And whereas Luke saith that they were filled with
wondering, it doth only declare a preparation, which a more full
proceeding  <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171) (and going forward.md)
did at length follow. For it was necessary that they should go forward,
because this their wondering had served to no end of itself, but did
rather make them astonied and amazed, than bring them (from their own
proceedings) unto God.

<span id="x.i-p28"></span>Therefore it was, as it were, the foundation
of the building which was to come, in that the people was touched with
amazedness. For if we pass over the works of God contemptibly or
carelessly, we shall never be able to profit by them. Furthermore, this
place cloth teach us what miracles do work of themselves in men; to wit,
that they breed a confused amazedness. For although the Lord doth call
us straightway unto himself, by showing plainly his goodness and power
there, yet such is the weakness of our nature, that we stumble or faint
in the midway, until such time as we be holpen by doctrine.

<span id="x.i-p29"></span>Let us, therefore, learn reverently to
consider the works of God, that the wondering at them may make an
entrance for doctrine. For when doctrine is cold and unprofitable with
us, God doth justly punish our unthankfulness by this means, because we
have despised the glory of his works. Again, because we are not so quick
of sight, that we can see so much in the works of God alone, as is
sufficient, let us learn to join therewithal the help of doctrine.
 <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) To be brief, the one ought not
to be separated from the other. Which thing experience doth sufficiently
teach us. For hereby it came to pass that the world did so wickedly
abuse miracles.

<span id="x.i-p31"></span>The Papists do object unto us miracles again
and again. Let us suppose that they be true, whereof they make such
boast, yet do they greatly err in this, that they wrest them to a wrong
end; to wit, that they may darken the name of God, and infect the pure
truth of the gospel with their inventions. For whence come so many
superstitious worshippings of saints, save only from the abuse of
miracles? For when any miracle is wrought, men must needs be moved. And
because they are deaf when they should hear the Word, and do not mark
what God cloth mean, Satan doth craftily take an occasion of
superstition by our amazedness.  <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md)
As, for example, I will acknowledge the power of God in a miracle. If it
were wrought by Peter, Satan will by and by put this in my head, and
will say thus:  <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) Dost thou not
see that this is a man of God?  <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md)
therefore thou dost owe unto him divine honor. The same thing had
befallen the Jews when they were amazed, unless Peter’s sermon had
called them back into the right way. But in Popery, where none did call
them back or reprove them,  <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) the
preposterous wondering of men did easily get the upper hand. Wherefore,
we must so much the more  <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) seek
for medicine out of the Word, that doctrine may direct us unto the right
end, being lifted up  <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) with the
miracles.

<span id="x.i-p38"></span><span id="x.i-p38.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p39"></span>**11.** *In the porch.* It is like that there
was a porch built in that place where Solomon’s porch was sometimes, and
that it took the name therefrom. For the old temple was pulled down, but
Zerubbabel and Ezra, ill the re-edifying and new building of the same
temple, had imitated the same, so nigh as they could possibly devise.
Afterward Herod renewed the same, and made it far more gorgeous, but
that vain cost which he had bestowed had not yet blotted out the
remembrance of Solomon in the hearts of the people. And Luke nameth the
same as a most famous place, whereunto the people ran together (by
heaps, to celebrate their feasts unto God at the times appointed.)
