<span id="xvii.vi-p1"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Acts
10:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034.md)<span
id="xvii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p2"></span>**34.** And Peter opening his mouth said,
Of a truth I find that God is no accepter of persons: **35.** But in
every nation he that feareth him, and doth righteousness, is accepted of
him. **36.** Concerning the thing which God sent to the children of
Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ; (he is Lord of all:) **37.** Ye
know how the word was spread throughout all Judea, beginning at Galilee,
after the baptism which John preached; **38.** How that God hath
anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost, and with power; who went
doing good, and healing all those which were holden by the devil,
because God was with him.

<span id="xvii.vi-p3"></span> 

<span id="xvii.vi-p4"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p5"></span>**34.** *Opening his mouth.* We have
already said, that the Scripture useth this phrase when it doth signify
that there was any grave or weighty oration or speech made. In the fifth
of Matthew, (<span id="xvii.vi-p5.1"></span>[Mt
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001)<span id="xvii.vi-p5.1"></span>,.md)
it is said that Jesus opened his mouth when he would preach to his
disciples, and intreat of most weighty matters, as if a man should say
in Latin, he began to speak, having first well bethought himself what he
would speak.

<span id="xvii.vi-p6"></span>*In truth I find.* <span
id="xvii.vi-p6.1"></span>Καταλαμβανεσθαι is to apprehend, or to gather
by reasons, signs, and conjectures. Cornelius was a Gentile born, yet
God heareth his prayers; he vouchsafeth to show him the light of the
gospel; he appointed and sendeth an angel to him particularly; thereby
doth Peter know that, without respect of persons, those do please God
which live godly and innocently. For before, (being wholly possessed
with this prejudice, that the Jews alone were beloved of God, as they
alone were chosen out of all people,) \[nations,\] he did not think that
the grace of God could come unto others. He was not, indeed, so gross
that he thought that godliness and innocency of life were condemned
because they were in a man that was a Gentile; but, seeing he did simply
snatch at that,  <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) that all those
were estranged from the kingdom of God, and were profane, which were
uncircumcised, he entangleth himself unawares in that so filthy an
error, that God did despise his pure worship and an holy life, where
there was no circumcision; because uncircumcision made all virtues
unsavory to the Jews. By which example, we are taught how greatly we
ought to beware of prejudices, which make us oftentimes judge amiss.

<span id="xvii.vi-p8"></span>Furthermore, we must note what the word
*person* doth signify, because many are thereby deceived, whilst that
they expound it generally, that one man is preferred before another. So
Pelagius denied in times past that some are chosen and some are
\[re\]proved  <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) of God; because
God did not accept persons. But by this word we must understand the
external state or appearance, as they call it; and whatsoever is about
man himself, which doth either bring him in favor, or cause him to be
hated; riches, nobility, multitude of servants, honor, do make a man to
be in great favor; poverty, baseness of lineage, and such like things,
make him to be despised. In this respect, the Lord doth oftentimes
forbid the accepting of persons, because men cannot judge aright so
often as external respects do lead them away from the matter.  <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) In this place, it is referred unto the
nation; and the meaning is, that circumcision is no let, but that God
may allow  <span id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) righteousness in a
man that is a Gentile. But it shall seem by this means that God did
respect persons for a time. For, when as he did choose the Jews to be
his people, passing over the Gentiles, did he not respect persons? I
answer, that the cause of this difference ought not to be sought in the
persons of men, but it doth wholly depend upon the hidden counsel of
God. For, in that he rather adopted Abraham, that with him he might make
his covenant, than the Egyptians, he did not this being moved with any
external respect, but (all) the whole cause remained in his wonderful
counsel. Therefore, God was never tied to persons.

<span id="xvii.vi-p12"></span>Notwithstanding, the doubt is not as yet
dissolved,  <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) because it cannot be
denied but that circumcision did please God, so that he counted him one
of his people who had that token of sanctification. But we may easily
answer this also that circumcision followed after the grace of God,
forasmuch as it was a seal thereof. Whereupon it followeth that it was
no cause thereof. Nevertheless, it was unto the Jews a pledge of free
adoption; in such sort, that uncircumcision did not hinder God, but that
he might admit what Gentiles he would unto the society of the same
salvation. But the coming of Christ had this new and especial thing,
that after that the wall of separation was pulled down, (<span
id="xvii.vi-p13.2"></span>[Ephesians.
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014)<span id="xvii.vi-p13.2"></span>,.md)
God did embrace the whole world generally. And this do the words *in
every nation* import. For so long as Abraham’s seed was the holy
inheritance of God, the Gentiles might seem to be quite banished from
his kingdom; but when Christ was given to be a light of the Gentiles,
the covenant of eternal life began to be common to all alike.

<span id="xvii.vi-p14"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p15"></span>**35.** *He which feareth God, and doth
righteousness.* In these two members is comprehended the integrity of
all the whole life. For the fear of God is nothing else but godliness
and religion; and *righteousness* is that equity which men use among
themselves, taking heed lest they hurt any man, and studying to do good
to all men. As the law of God consisteth upon \[of\] these two parts,
(which is the rule of good life) so no man shall prove himself to God
but he which shall refer and direct all his actions to this end, neither
shall there be any sound thing in all offices, \[duties,\] unless the
whole life be grounded in the fear of God. But it seemeth that this
place doth attribute the cause of salvation unto the merits of works.
For if works purchase favor for us with God, they do also win life for
us which is placed in the love of God towards us. Some do also catch at
the word *righteousness,* that they may prove that we are not justified
freely by faith, but by works. But this latter thing is too frivolous.
For I have already showed that it is not taken for the perfect and whole
observing of the law, but is restrained unto the second table and the
offices of love. Therefore it is not the universal righteousness whereby
a man is judged just before God, but that honesty and innocency which
respecteth men, when as that is given to every man which is his.

<span id="xvii.vi-p16"></span>Therefore the question remaineth as yet,
whether works win the favor of God for us? which that we may answer, we
must first note that there is a double respect of God in loving men. For
seeing we be born the children of wrath, (<span
id="xvii.vi-p16.1"></span>[Eph
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003)<span id="xvii.vi-p16.1"></span>,.md)
God shall be so far from finding any thing in us which is worthy of his
love, that all our whole nature causeth him rather to hate us; in which
respect, Paul saith that all men are enemies to him until they be
reconciled by Christ, (<span id="xvii.vi-p16.2"></span>[Ro
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010)<span id="xvii.vi-p16.2"></span>..md)
Therefore the first accepting of God, whereby he receiveth us into
favor, is altogether free; for there can as yet no respect of works be
had, seeing all things are corrupt and wicked, and taste of \[bespeak\]
their beginning. Now, whom God hath adopted to be his children, them
doth he also regenerate by his Spirit, and reform in them his image:
whence riseth that second respect. For God doth not find man bare and
naked then, and void of all grace, but he knoweth his own work in him,
yea, himself. Therefore, God accepteth the faithful, because they live
godly and justly. And we do not deny that God accepteth the good works
of the saints; but this is another question, whether man prevent the
grace of God with his merits or no, and insinuate himself into his love,
or whether he be beloved at the beginning, freely and without respect of
works, forasmuch as he is worthy of nothing else but of hatred.
Furthermore, forasmuch as man, left to his own nature, can bring nothing
but matter of hatred, he must needs confess that he is truly beloved;
whereupon, it followeth that God is to himself the cause that he loveth
us, and that he is provoked \[actuated\] with his own mercy, and not
with our merits. Secondly, we must note, that although the faithful
please God after regeneration with good works, and their respects of
works, yet that is not done with the merit of works. For the cleanliness
of works is never so exact that they can please God without pardon; yea,
forasmuch as they have always some corruption mixed with them, they are
worthy to be refused. Therefore, the worthiness of the works doth not
cause them to be had in estimation, but faith, which borroweth that of
Christ which is wanting in works.

<span id="xvii.vi-p17"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p18"></span>**36.** *Concerning the matter.* Because
the Greek text is abrupt, some think that the accusative case is put
instead of the nominative; and that the sense is this, This is the word
which God hath sent unto the children of Israel. Other some refer it
unto the word *ye know*, which followeth afterward; and they think that
there was another word added to make the sentence more pleasant. For
Luke putteth <span id="xvii.vi-p18.1"></span>λογον in the former place,
and afterward <span id="xvii.vi-p18.2"></span>ρημα. But forasmuch as it
is common and familiar amongst the Grecians to understand  <span
id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) the prepositions; this sense, which I
have set down, seemeth to me more agreeable, though, if the harshness of
the speech can be any better mitigated, I will willingly yield.
Therefore I take this member to be a preface, which appertaineth unto
this worthy work of God, which he showed amongst the children of Israel,
preaching peace by Christ. That done, there is added a narration. At
length, in the conclusion of his speech, Peter showeth to what end
Christ was sent into the world. Furthermore, he beginneth with this
commemoration not without cause, That God sent his word unto the
children of Israel. And *speech* is put for *thing* in the Hebrew
phrase. The eternal covenant which God had made with that people was at
that time famous. There was nothing more commonly known among the Jews
than that there was a Redeemer promised in times past to the fathers,
who should restore things which were decayed unto a flourishing and
blessed estate. This did those also know who were familiarly conversant
with the Jews. Therefore, to the end Peter may purchase greater credit,
he saith that he will speak of no new or unknown thing, but of the
restoring of the Church, which did depend upon the eternal covenant of
God, and which was now manifestly showed, and almost in every man’s
mouth.

<span id="xvii.vi-p20"></span>*Preaching peace.* Peter teacheth here
what manner \[of\] rumor and thing that was which was spread abroad; to
wit, such as that it did make peace. I take peace in this place for the
reconciling of men and God, which, notwithstanding, hath in it the
perfect  <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) salvation of the
Church. For, as horrible confusion, and, as it were, a huge lump,  <span
id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) do follow after that God is once
estranged from us; so, so soon as his fatherly favor doth once appear,
he gathereth his Church together, and true felicity ariseth. Therefore,
this is Peter’s meaning, that God showed himself merciful to his people
in Christ, and that he received into favor Abraham’s children again,
(whom he seemed to have cast away for a time,) that he might establish
among them a flourishing estate. And as he maketh God the author of this
peace, so he placeth Christ in the midst as the pledge thereof, that it
may be certain and holy. He coupleth peace and preaching expressly
together, because this is one way whereby the fruit of the
reconciliation, purchased by Christ, cometh unto us. In like sort, after
that Paul had taught that Christ is our peace, he addeth immediately,
that he came to preach peace unto those who were nigh at hand and far
off, (<span id="xvii.vi-p22.2"></span>[Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017)<span id="xvii.vi-p22.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xvii.vi-p23"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p24"></span>**37.** *Ye know how the word.* This
sermon of Peter consisteth upon \[of\] two members principally; for in
the former he reciteth an history; secondly, he descendeth unto the
fruit of the history). For seeing that the coming of Christ into the
world, his death and resurrection, are the matter of our salvation,
Christ cannot otherwise be set before us to salvation, than if we first
know that he hath put on our flesh; that he was in such sort conversant
amongst men; that he proved himself, by certain testimonies, to be the
Son of God; that he was at length nailed upon the cross, and raised up
from the dead by the power of God. Again, lest the knowledge of the
history be unprofitable and cold, we must also show the end why he came
down from his heavenly glory into the world, why he suffered such a
death so reproachful amongst men, and accursed by the mouth of God. The
cause of his resurrection must be showed, whence the effect and fruit of
all these things is gathered; to wit, that Christ was humbled, that he
might restore us unto perfect blessedness who were quite lost; and also
that he put on brotherly love together with our flesh; that by taking
upon him our infirmities, he unburdened us thereof; that he made
satisfaction for our sins, by the sacrifice of his death, that he might
purchase the Father’s favor for us; that when as he had gotten the
victory of death, he purchased for us eternal life; that he set heaven
open for us by his entrance into the same; that all the power of the
Spirit was poured out upon him, that he might enrich us with his
abundance, (<span id="xvii.vi-p24.1"></span>[Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001)<span id="xvii.vi-p24.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xvii.vi-p25"></span>This order of teaching doth Peter observe
when he beginneth with the history of the gospel; and afterward showeth
what we have by Christ’s descending into the earth, by his death and
resurrection. First, he saith, that Jesus of Nazareth came abroad after
John’s baptism. For because John was appointed to this end, by the
counsel of God, that he might lift up the minds of the people to wait
for Christ, it was not meet that this point should be omitted. He was
counted an excellent prophet of God; therefore his authority was of
great importance to make Christ to be believed, especially amongst the
ignorant and those which were but novices. We must note the phrase, that
John preached baptism. For Luke comprehendeth, indeed, under the word
*baptism,* all the whole ministry of John; nevertheless he showeth that
it was no dumb sign, and void of doctrine. And assuredly this is the
chiefest thing in all sacraments, that the Word of God may appear
engraven there, and that the clear voice may sound. For which cause,
that wicked profanation which is seen in Papistry is so much the more to
be detested, because, burying preaching, they do only charm the
sacraments with magical enchantment,

<span id="xvii.vi-p26"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p27"></span>**38.** *Jesus of Nazareth.* He calleth
him a Nazarite here, not because he was born there, but because he came
thence to execute his office; again, because he was surnamed thus
commonly. He saith that he was anointed with the Spirit and power by
*hypallage.* For the power wherein Christ exceeded proceeded from the
Spirit alone. Therefore, when as the heavenly Father anointed his Son,
he furnished him with the power of his Spirit. Peter saith immediately
after, that this power appeared in miracles; although he expresseth one
kind only in plain words, that Christ testified that he was endowed with
power of the Holy Ghost that he might do good in the world. For it was
not meet that the fearful power of God should be showed forth in him,
but such as might allure the world with the sweet taste of goodness and
grace to love him and to desire him. The metaphor of anointing is usual
so often as mention is made of the gifts of the Holy Ghost. It is now
applied unto the person of Christ, because by this means he was
consecrated a king and priest by his Father. And we know that in time of
the law, oil was a solemn token of consecration. The going of Christ is
taken for the course of his calling, as if he should say, that he
fulfilled his function until the time appointed before. The similitude
is taken from travelers which go forward in their journey until they
come unto the appointed place; although he showeth therewithal that he
walked through Judea in three years, so that no corner was without his
good deeds.

<span id="xvii.vi-p28"></span>*Those which were holden of devils.* This
also was a more manifest token of God’s power in Christ, that he did not
only heal men of common diseases, but did also cure desperate evils. All
diseases are indeed light punishments  <span
id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md) wherewith God doth punish us; but when
as he dealeth more gently with us according to his fatherly kindness, he
is said to strike us with his hand then; but in more grievous scourges
he useth Satan as the minister of his wrath, and as it were an hangman.
And we must diligently mark this distinction; for it were an absurd
thing to say that he is tormented of the devil who is sick of an ague,
or of some other common kind of disease; but the alienating of the mind,
 <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md) furious madness, and other, as
it were, monstrous griefs, \[evils,\] are fitly and properly attributed
to Satan. And, in this respect, the Scripture useth to call men who are
so taken and carried headlong with such madness that they have no hold
of themselves, so that they seem to be turned almost into beasts, men
possessed of devils.

<span id="xvii.vi-p31"></span>*Because God was with him.* Peter noteth
briefly to what end those powers did tend which were showed  <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md) by the hand of Christ, to wit, that
tie might purchase credit among men, who did behold God as it were
present; and this was the true use of miracles, as we have said already
elsewhere, and as we shall see again hereafter when we come to it. For
we must stay ourselves upon this principle, that we diminish the majesty
of God unless we embrace and reverence those whom he marketh with the
mark of his servants. Therefore, forasmuch as powers \[miracles\] did
plainly prove that Christ descended from heaven, his dignity is placed
without the lot of man’s judgment.
