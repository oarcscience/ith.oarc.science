<span id="xiii.i-p1"></span><span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>[Acts
6:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001.md)<span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And in those days, when the number of
the disciples grew, there arose a murmuring of the Greeks against the
Hebrews, because their widows were despised in the daily ministry.
**2.** Therefore, when the twelve had called unto them the multitude of
the disciples, they said, It doth not please \[or it is not good\] that
we should serve tables, having left the word of God. **3.** Therefore,
brethren, look out seven men of you, of known honesty, full of the Holy
Ghost, and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this business, **4.**
And we will give ourselves unto prayer, and to the ministration of the
word. **5.** The speech pleased the whole multitude; and they chose
Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Ghost; and Philip, and
Prochorus, \[Nicanor,\] and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a
proselyte of Antioch; **6.** These did they set before the apostles: and
when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them.

<span id="xiii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xiii.i-p4"></span><span id="xiii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p5"></span>**1.** Luke declareth here upon what
occasion, and to what end, and also with what rite, deacons were first
made. He saith, When there arose a murmuring amongst the disciples, it
was appeased by this remedy, as it is said in the common proverb, Good
laws have taken their beginning of evil manners. And it may seem to be a
strange thing, seeing that this is a function so excellent and so
necessary in the Church, why it came not into the apostles’ minds at the
first, (before there was any such occasion ministered,) to appoint
deacons, and why the Spirit of God did not give them such counsel which
they take now, being, as it were, enforced thereunto. But that which
happened was both better then, and is also more profitable for us at
this day, to be unto us an example. If the apostles had spoken of
choosing deacons before any necessity did require the same, they should
not have had the people so ready; they should have seemed to avoid labor
and trouble; many would not have offered so liberally into the hands of
other men. Therefore, it was requisite that the faithful should be
convict \[convinced\] by experience that they might choose deacons
willingly, whom they saw they could not want; and that through their own
fault.

<span id="xiii.i-p6"></span>We learn in this history that the Church
cannot be so framed by and by, but that there remain somewhat to be
amended; neither can so great a building be so finished in one day, that
there may not something be added to make the same perfect. Furthermore,
we learn that there is no ordinance of God so holy and laudable, which
is not either corrupt or made unprofitable through the fault of men. We
wonder that things are never so well ordered in the world, but that
there is always some evil mixed with the good; but it is the wickedness
and corruption of our nature which causeth this. That was, indeed, a
godly order, whereof Luke made mention before, when the goods of all men
being consecrated to God, were distributed to every man as he had need;
 <span id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md) when as the apostles, being, as
it were, the stewards of God and the poor, had the chief government of
the alms. But shortly after there ariseth a murmuring which troubleth
this order. Here appeareth that corruption of men whereof I have spoken,
which doth not suffer us to use our good things. We must also mark the
subtilty  <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) of Satan, who, to the
end he may take from us the use of the gifts of God, goeth about this
continually, that it may not remain pure and sound; but that, being
mixed with other discommodities, it may, first, be suspected, secondly,
loathed, and, lastly, quite taken away. But the apostles have taught us,
by their example, that we must not yield unto such engines (and
policies) of Satan. For they do not think it meet (being offended with
the murmuring) to take away that ministry which they know pleaseth God;
but rather invent a remedy whereby the offense may be taken away, and
that may be retained which is God’s. Thus must we do. For what offenses
soever Satan raise,  <span id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) we must
take good heed that he take not from us those ordinances which are
otherwise wholesome.

<span id="xiii.i-p10"></span>*The number increasing.* We ought to wish
for nothing more than that God would increase his Church, and gather
together many  <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) on every side
unto his people; but the corruption of our nature hindereth us from
having any thing happy in all points. For there arise many
discommodities also, even of the increasings of the Church. For it is a
hard matter to keep many hypocrites from creeping into the multitude,
whose wickedness is not by and by discovered, until such time as they
have infected some part of the flock with their infection. Moreover,
many wicked, froward, and dissolute persons do insinuate themselves
under a false color of repentance. And that I may pass over innumerable
things, there is never such agreement amongst many, but that, according
to the diversity of their manners, their opinions are also diverse, so
that one thing cannot please all alike. This offense causeth many to be
desirous to choose a few for a Church; it causeth them to loathe or else
to hate a multitude. But no trouble, no irksomeness, ought so much to
prevail, but that we must always be desirous to have the Church
increased; but that we must study to enlarge the same; but that we must
cherish so much as in us lieth unity with the whole body.

<span id="xiii.i-p12"></span>*A murmuring of the Greeks.* Hereby it
appeareth that they were not fully regenerate by the Spirit of God, to
whom the diversity of nation and country ministereth occasion of
disagreement. For in Christ there is neither Jew nor Grecian, (<span
id="xiii.i-p12.1"></span>[Ga 3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p12.1"></span>.) Therefore, this indignation smelleth  <span
id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) of the flesh and the world. Wherefore
we must take good heed that the like fault be not found in us.  <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) There is another fault in that they
declare their indignation by murmuring. Furthermore it is uncertain
whether the complaint were true or no. For when Luke saith that the
Greeks murmured, because their widows were not honored, he showeth not
what was done in deed, but what they thought was done. And it may be
that forasmuch as the apostles did prefer the Jews,  <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) because they were better known, the
Greeks did think (though falsely) that their widows were despised as
strangers. And this seemeth to be more like to be true. Furthermore the
word *ministering* may be expounded two manner of ways, actively or
passively. For we know that at the first there were widows chosen unto
the ministration.  <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md)
Notwithstanding, I do rather think that the Greeks did complain, because
their widows were not so liberally relieved as they wished. So that the
ministration shall be that daily distribution which was wont to be made.

<span id="xiii.i-p17"></span><span id="xiii.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p18"></span>**2.** *The twelve having the multitude
called unto them* It is a point \[proof\] of patience and meekness that
the apostles are no more moved.  <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md)
It is a point of prudence and godly carefulness, in that they prevent
the evil which began to arise,  <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md)
without deferring the remedy. For after that every dissension and
division hath gathered strength, it is a wound hard to be cured. By this
assembly it appeareth that the Church was governed by order and reason,
so that the apostles had the chiefest authority, and that they did
impart their counsels and purposes unto the people.  <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) Again, we must note that the faithful,
or Christians, are in this place called disciples, in whom that of
Isaiah must be fulfilled, “That they were all taught of God.” And again,
that of Jeremiah, “They shall all know God, from the least to the
greatest.”

<span id="xiii.i-p22"></span>*It pleaseth not.* It is in Greek \[<span
id="xiii.i-p22.1"></span>ουκ αρεστον\] By which word, the Grecians do
now express every opinion or decree which is better than another, or
which is to be preferred as being better.  <span
id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md) I do rather think that the apostles
declare what is profitable, than simply what they have decreed. But if
it be not expedient for them to meddle with this business,  <span
id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) they seem \[now\] to acknowledge some
fault in that they ministered hitherto. And surely that is true, that
use is the father of wisdom.  <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md)
Wherefore there shall be no absurdity if we shall say, that the apostles
desire of the Church to be unburdened of that function, after that they
have tried \[experienced\] that it is not meet for them. But if there
were any fault, it ought rather to be ascribed unto necessity than unto
them; for they took not this burthen upon them greedily, but seeing
there was no other way as yet, they had better burthen themselves out of
measure than that the poor should be forslowed.  <span
id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) And when as they say that it is not
meet that they should be occupied in providing for the poor, their
meaning is, that are unable to endure both burthens, so that they must
needs let the one alone. For it is as if they should say, If thou wilt
enjoy our ministry in the preaching of the gospel, deliver us from the
charge of the poor, because we are not able to do both. But this seemeth
to be spoken out of season by them, because they had not left the charge
of teaching before, although they had the oversight of the alms. I
answer, forasmuch as the administration was confused, they were so
enwrapped,  <span id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) that they could not
wholly attend upon doctrine as was meet. Therefore, they refuse that
function which draweth them away from the free and perfect  <span
id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md) charge of teaching. Notwithstanding,
we may not think that they had quite cast away all care of the poor, but
that they did only seek somewhat to be lightened and eased, that they
might attend upon their office. And, in the mean season, they declare
that the ministry of the word is so painful  <span
id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) that it requireth a whole man, neither
will it suffer him to be occupied about any other business; which, if it
had been well considered, there had been a far other order taken in the
Church.

<span id="xiii.i-p30"></span>The Popish bishops did suck  <span
id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md) up great riches under color of the
ministration or deaconship; nevertheless, they entangled themselves in
divers businesses, which they were scarce able to overcome,  <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) though every one of them had had ten
heads. Notwithstanding, such is their wickedness, that they say that
there can be no church unless it be drowned in this depth;  <span
id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md) neither do they cease to brag and
boast that they are the successors of the apostles, whereas there is
nothing which appeareth to be more contrary. They were careful for this,
that they might not be occupied about serving of tables, and so be
compelled to leave their own banquets. For whosoever is careful for his
own table, he taketh leave to be vacant  <span
id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) from other men’s tables.

<span id="xiii.i-p35"></span>But omitting these things, let us mark this
sentence. We know what a holy thing it is to be careful for the poor.
Therefore, forasmuch as the apostles prefer the preaching of the gospel
before if we gather thereby that no obedience is more acceptable to God.
Notwithstanding, the hardness is also declared,  <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md) when as they say that they cannot
discharge both these duties. Surely we are not better than they.
Therefore, let every one of us that is called unto the function of
teaching addict himself wholly to order this his estate well.  <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md) For we are inclined to nothing more
than to fall to slothfulness. Again, the flesh ministereth goodly cloaks
and colors, so that those men cannot see by and by that they are led
away from their calling which enwrap themselves in strange business.
Wherefore, to the end ministers may prick forward themselves to do their
duty, let them remember this saying of the apostles oftentimes, wherein
they declare that, forasmuch as they are called unto the function of
teaching, they must not any longer take charge of the poor. Therefore,
what excuses have profane affairs  <span
id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329.md) (taken in hand even for some private
gain) where that is set aside, which is otherwise accounted no small
part of the worship of God.

<span id="xiii.i-p39"></span><span id="xiii.i-p39.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p40"></span>**3.** *Therefore, brethren, look out.* Now
we see to what end deacons were made. The word itself is indeed general,
yet is it properly taken for those which are stewards for the poor.
Whereby it appeareth how licentiously the Papists do mock God and men,
who assign unto their deacons no other office but this, to have the
charge of  <span id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330.md) the paten and
chalice. Surely we need no disputation to prove that they agree in no
point with the apostles. But if the readers be desirous to see any more
concerning this point, they may repair unto our Institution, chapter 8.
As touching this present place, the Church is permitted to choose. For
it is tyrannous if any one man appoint or make ministers at his
pleasure.  <span id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md) Therefore, this is
the (most) lawful way, that those be chosen by common voices  <span
id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md) who are to take upon them  <span
id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md) any public function in the Church. And
the apostles prescribe what manner \[of\] persons ought to be chosen, to
wit, men of tried honesty and credit,  <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) men endued with wisdom  <span
id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md) and other gifts of the Spirit. And
this is the mean between tyranny and confused liberty,  <span
id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) that nothing be done without  <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) the consent and approbation of the
people, yet so that the pastors moderate and govern (this action,  <span
id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338) .md) that their authority may be as a
bridle to keep under the people,  <span
id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) lest they pass their bounds too much.
In the mean season, this is worth the noting, that the apostles
prescribe an order unto the faithful, lest they appoint any save those
which are fit. For we do God no small injury if we take all that come to
hand  <span id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md) to govern his house.
Therefore, we must use great circumspection that we choose none  <span
id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341.md) unto the holy function of the Church
unless we have some trial of him first. The number of seven is applied
 <span id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md) unto the present necessity,
lest any man should think  <span id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md) that
there is some mystery comprehended under the same. Whereas Luke saith,
*full of the Spirit and wisdom,* I do interpret it thus, that it is
requisite that they be furnished both with other gifts of the Spirit,
and also with wisdom,  <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md) without
which that function cannot be exercised well, both that they may beware
of the leger-demain  <span id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) of those
men, who being too much given unto begging, require  <span
id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md) that which is necessary for the
poverty of the brethren, and also of their slanders, who cease not to
backbite, though they have none occasion given them. For that function
is not only painful, but also subject to many ungodly murmurings.  <span
id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md)

<span id="xiii.i-p59"></span><span id="xiii.i-p59.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p60"></span>**4.** *And we will give ourselves unto
prayer.* They show again that they have too much business otherwise,
wherein they may exercise themselves during their whole life. For the
old proverb agreeth hereunto very fitly, which was used sometimes in the
solemn rites, *do this.* Therefore, they use the word \[<span
id="xiii.i-p60.1"></span>προσκαρτερησαι\] which signifieth to be, as it
were, fastened and tied to anything. Therefore, pastors must not think
that they have so done their duty that they need to do no more when they
have daily spent some time in teaching. There is another manner of
study, another manner of zeal, another manner of continuance  <span
id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) required, that they may  <span
id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) indeed boast that they are wholly
given to that thing. They adjoin thereunto prayer, not that they alone
ought to pray, (for that is an exercise common to all the godly,) but
because they have peculiar causes to pray above all others. There is no
man which ought not to be careful for the common salvation of the
Church. How much more, then, ought the pastor, who hath that function
enjoined him by name to labor carefully \[anxiously\] for it? So Moses
did indeed exhort others unto prayer, but he went before them as the
ringleader  <span id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md) (<span
id="xiii.i-p63.2"></span>[Ex
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#011)<span id="xiii.i-p63.2"></span>..md)
And it is not without cause that Paul doth so often make mention of his
prayers, (<span id="xiii.i-p63.3"></span>[Ro
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#010)<span id="xiii.i-p63.3"></span>..md)
Again, we must always remember that, that we shall lose all our labor
bestowed upon plowing, sowing, and watering, unless the increase come
from heaven, (<span id="xiii.i-p63.4"></span>[1Co
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007)<span id="xiii.i-p63.4"></span>..md)
Therefore, it shall not suffice to take great pains in teaching, unless
we require the blessing at the hands of the Lord, that our labor may not
be in vain and unfruitful. Hereby it appeareth that the exercise of
prayer  <span id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) is not in vain commended
unto the ministers of the word.

<span id="xiii.i-p65"></span><span id="xiii.i-p65.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p66"></span>**5.** *Stephen, full of faith.* Luke doth
not, therefore, separate faith from the Spirit, as if it also were not a
gift of the Spirit; but by Spirit he meaneth other gifts wherewith
Stephen was endued, as zeal, wisdom, uprightness, brotherly love,
diligence, integrity of a good conscience; secondly, he expresseth the
principal kind. Therefore, he signifieth that Stephen did excel first in
faith, and, secondly, in other virtues; so that it was evident that he
had abundance of the grace of the Spirit. He doth not so greatly commend
the rest, because undoubtedly they were inferior to him. Moreover, the
ancient writers do, with great consent, affirm that this Nicholas, which
was one of the seven, is the same of whom John maketh mention in the
Revelation, (<span id="xiii.i-p66.1"></span>[Re
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#015)<span id="xiii.i-p66.1"></span>,.md)
to wit, that he was an author of a filthy and wicked sect; forasmuch as
he would have women to be common. For which cause we must not be
negligent in choosing ministers of the Church. For if the hypocrisy of
men do deceive even those which are most vigilant and careful to fake
heed, what shall befall the careless and negligent? Notwithstanding, if
when we have used such circumspection as is meet, it so fall out that we
be deceived, let us not be troubled out of measure; forasmuch as Luke
saith that even the apostles were subject to this inconvenience. Some
will ask this question, then, what good shall exhortation do? to what
use serveth prayer, seeing that the success itself showeth that the
election was not wholly governed by the Spirit of God? I answer, that
this is a great matter that the Spirit directed their judgments in
choosing six men; in that he suffereth the Church to go astray in the
seventh, it ought to seem no absurd thing. For it is requisite that we
be thus humbled divers ways, partly that the wicked and ungodly may
exercise us; partly that, being taught by their example, we may learn to
examine ourselves thoroughly, lest there be in us any hidden and privy
starting-corners of guile;  <span id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md)
partly that we may be more circumspect to discern, and that we may, as
it were, keep watch continually, lest we be deceived by crafty and
unfaithful men. Also it may be that the ministry of Nicholas was for a
time profitable, and that he fell afterward into that monstrous error.
And if so be it he fell in such sort from such an honorable degree, the
higher that every one of us shall be extolled, let him submit himself
unto God with modesty and fear.

<span id="xiii.i-p68"></span><span id="xiii.i-p68.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p69"></span>**6.** *Having prayed, they laid their
hands upon them.* Laying on of hands was a solemn sign of consecration
under the law. To this end do the apostles now lay their hands upon the
deacons, that they may know that they are offered to God.
Notwithstanding, because this ceremony should of itself be vain, they
add thereunto prayer, wherein the faithful commend unto God those
ministers whom they offer unto him. This is referred unto the apostles,
for all the people did not lay their hands upon the deacons; but when
the apostles did make prayer in the name of the Church, others also did
add their petitions. Hence we gather that the laying on of hands is a
rite agreeing unto order and comeliness, forasmuch as the apostles did
use the same, and yet that it hath of itself no force or power, but that
the effect dependeth upon the Spirit of God alone; which is generally to
be thought of all ceremonies.
