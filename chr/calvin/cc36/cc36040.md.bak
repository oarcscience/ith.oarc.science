<span id="xii.i-p1"></span><span id="xii.i-p1.1"></span>[Acts
5:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md)<span id="xii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And a certain man called Ananias, with
Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, **2.** And he kept back part of
the price, his wife knowing thereof, and bringing part, he laid it at
the apostles’ feet. **3.** And Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan
filled thine heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Ghost, and keep
back part of the price of the ground? **4.** Did it not, remaining,
remain to thee? and, being sold, was it not in thy power? How is it that
thou hast put this thing in thy heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to
God. **5.** And when Ananias heard these words, falling, he yielded up
the ghost; and there came great fear upon all those which had heard
these things**. 6.** Furthermore, the young men which were present
gathered him up, and, carrying him out, they buried him.

<span id="xii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xii.i-p4"></span><span id="xii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p5"></span>**1.** Those things which Luke hath reported
hitherto did show that that company, which was gathered together under
the name of Christ, was rather a company of angels than of men,
Moreover, that was incredible virtue, that the rich men did despoil
themselves of their own accord, not only of their money, but also of
their land, that they might relieve the poor. But now he showeth that
Satan had invented a shift to get into that holy company, and that under
color of such excellent virtue; for he hath wonderful wiles of hypocrisy
to insinuate himself. This way doth Satan assault the Church, when as he
cannot prevail by open war. But we must specially in this place have
respect unto the drift of the Holy Ghost. For in this history he meant
to declare, first, how acceptable singleness of heart is to God, and
what an abomination hypocrisy is in his sight; secondly, how greatly he
alloweth \[approves\] the holy and pure policy and govermnent of his
Church. For this is the principal point, the punishment wherewith
punished Ananias and his wife. As the greatness thereof did at that time
terrify them all, so it is unto us a testimony that God cannot abide
this unfaithfulness, when as bearing a show of holiness where there is
none, we do mock him contemptibly. For if, having weighed all the
circumstances, we be desirous to know the sum, Luke condemneth no other
fault in Ananias than this, that he meant to deceive God and the Church
with a reigned offering. Yet there were more evils packed under this
dissimulation: the contempt of God, whom he feareth not, though he knew
his wickedness; sacrilegious defrauding, because he keepeth back part of
that which he professeth to be holy to God; perverse vanity and
ambition, because he vaunteth himself in the presence of men, without
having any respect unto God’s judgment; want of faith, because he would
never have gone this way to work, unless he had mistrusted God; the
corrupting of a godly and holy order; furthermore, the hypocrisy itself
was a great offense of itself.  <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md)
The fact of Ananias did bear a goodly show,  <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) although he had given only the half of
his land. Neither is this a small virtue, for a rich man to bestow the
half of his goods upon the poor; but the sacrifices of the ungodly are
an abomination to God, (<span id="xii.i-p7.2"></span>[Pr
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#008)<span id="xii.i-p7.2"></span>;.md)
neither can any thing please him where the singleness of heart is
wanting. For this cause is it that Christ maketh more account of the two
mites offered by the widow, than of the great sums of others, who of
their great heaps gave some part, (<span id="xii.i-p7.3"></span>[Lu
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#002)<span id="xii.i-p7.3"></span>..md)
This is the cause why God doth show an example of such sharp punishment
in Ananias. Now, let us note every point by itself. *He laid it at the
feet of the apostles.* Lo, what ambition doth! Ananias is ashamed not to
be accounted one of the best; therefore, although he be greedy of money,
yet to the end he may purchase a name amongst men, he depriveth himself
of some part of his riches. In the meanwhile, he doth not consider that
he lieth and deceiveth in the sight of God, and that God will punish
this lie. So it is, that he honoreth the apostles’ feet more than God’s
eyes. Wherefore, we must take good heed, that when we do well, we do not
seek to be praised of the bystanders;  <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) and it is not without cause that
Christ saith, that it is profitable for us when we give our alms, to
have the left hand ignorant of that which the right hand doth.

<span id="xii.i-p9"></span><span id="xii.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p10"></span>**3.** *And Peter said.* How did Peter know
Ananias’ fraud (and purloining?) Undoubtedly by the revelation of the
Spirit. Therefore, Luke signifieth unto us, that the apostles did after
a sort represent God’s person, and supply his room. If the Spirit of
God, by the mouth of a mortal man, do so sore urge an hypocrite, being
otherwise painted with the beautiful color of virtues, how shall the
reprobate abide the voice of God himself, with the sound of the trumpet,
when they shall appear before his judgment-seat? Furthermore, Peter
pointeth out the cruelness and horribleness of the offense  <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) by his question, when he saith, that
Satan had filled the heart of Ananias. For there is no man whose heart
is not pricked with the pricks of Satan, and all men are also many ways
tempted, yea, these temptations pierce into their minds; but where Satan
possesseth the heart, he reigneth in the whole man, having, as it were,
expelled God. This is a sign of a reprobate, to be so addicted and given
over to Satan, that the Spirit of God hath no place. That which
followeth afterward concerning lying may have a double sense; either
that he did falsely bear a show of the Spirit, or that he lied against
the Spirit. And, indeed, it is word for word *mentiri Spiritum;* but
forasmuch as the Greek word \[<span id="xii.i-p11.2"></span>ψευδεσθαι\]
is joined with a double accusative case and that doth better agree with
the text \[context,\] I am rather of this mind, that Ananias is
reprehended, because he did lie falsely to the Holy Ghost. Which he
confirmeth shortly after, when he upbraideth this unto him, that he hath
lied unto God, and not unto men. Wherefore we must take great heed, that
hypocrisy reign not in us, which hath this wickedness proper to it, to
go about to deceive God, and, as it were *cornicum oculos configere.* To
go about to make blind those which are most wise;  <span
id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) which cannot be without a disloyal and
unseemly mock. Wherefore it is not without cause that Peter saith, that
where this cometh to pass the heart is possessed of Satan. For who durst
(unless he were void of reason) so blaspheme God? Therefore Peter asketh
him as of some wonder, because such blindness is horrible.

<span id="xii.i-p13"></span><span id="xii.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p14"></span>**4.** *Did it not remaining.* This
amplifieth the offense because he sinned, being enforced by no
necessity. For seeing it is no just or lawful excuse to have been
provoked by some other means, how much worse is it to run headlong unto
wickedness willingly, and, as it were of set purpose to pull down God’s
vengeance? We gather out of this, that no man was enforced to sell his
goods or lands. For Peter saith, that Ananias had free liberty to keep
both his land and his money; because in the second member, the field
which was sold is taken for the price itself. Therefore he should
nevertheless have been counted faithful, though he had kept that which
was his own. Whereby it appeareth that they are men destitute of their
right wits, who say that it is not lawful for the faithful to have
anything of their own.

<span id="xii.i-p15"></span>*Thou hast not lied to men, but to God.*
Although the words be diversely construed, yet do I not doubt but that
this confirmeth the former sentence. For hypocrites do so enwrap
themselves in so many shifts, that they think they have nothing to do
with God. And Peter speaketh thus expressly, because Ananias had
deceived the Church. But he ought to have considered, that

<span id="xii.i-p16"></span>“where two or three be gathered together in
the name of Christ, he is present there as the chief governor,”  
(<span id="xii.i-p16.2"></span>[Mt
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#020)<span id="xii.i-p16.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="xii.i-p17"></span>yea, he ought to have behaved himself no
otherwise in that assembly, than if he should have seen God with his
eyes. For seeing that God will reign in the Church, if we give him any
reverence, we must reverence that rule and government religiously which
he exerciseth by his Word. The apostles were indeed men, but not private
men, because God had put them in his stead. Furthermore, we must note,
that he saith that he lieth to God who doth lie to the Holy Ghost. For
the divinity of the Holy Ghost is manifestly proved by this form of
speech. In like sort Paul saith, “Ye are the temples of God, because his
Spirit dwelleth in you,” (<span id="xii.i-p17.1"></span>[1 Cor.
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#017.md), [1 Cor.
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019)<span id="xii.i-p17.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xii.i-p18"></span><span id="xii.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p19"></span>**5.** *When Ananias heard these things.*
The death of Ananias doth, indeed, declare and prove the force of the
word, which Paul cloth highly extol; to wit, that it is the savor of
death unto death to those which perish, (<span
id="xii.i-p19.1"></span>[2Co 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md)<span
id="xii.i-p19.1"></span>.) He speaketh, indeed, of the spiritual death
of the soul, but there was a visible sign in the body of Ananias of that
punishment which cannot be seen with the eyes of men. He was not slain
with sword, by force, nor hand, but was stricken dead with the only
hearing of the voice. When we hear this, let the threatenings of the
gospel terrify us, and humble us in time, lest we also feel the like
effect. For that which is spoken of Christ,

<span id="xii.i-p20"></span>“He shall slay the wicked with the breath of
his mouth.”  
(<span id="xii.i-p20.2"></span>[Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004)<span id="xii.i-p20.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="xii.i-p21"></span>doth not only appertain to the head of the
wicked, but also to every member. For those which refuse the salvation
offered in his word, it must needs be deadly to them, which was
naturally wholesome. But and if any man do think it an absurd thing that
the apostle did punish Ananias bodily, first, I answer, that this was an
extraordinary thing; secondly, that this was one of the gifts of the
Spirit, as it appeareth by the 19th chapter of the First to the
Corinthians, (verse 10.) After which sort we shall afterward see Elymas,
the sorcerer, stricken with blindness by Paul, (<span
id="xii.i-p21.1"></span>[Ac 13:8](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#008.md)<span
id="xii.i-p21.1"></span>.) Therefore, Peter did nothing which was
impertinent to his function, when he did in time shoot that dart which
the Holy Ghost had given him. And whereas some think that this was too
cruel a punishment, this cometh to pass, because, weighing Ananias’ sin
in their own and not in God’s balance, they count that but a light
offense which was a most great and grievous crime, being full of such
heinous offenses as I have already declared. Other some do think that
this was nothing so, because they see many hypocrites escape scot free
daily, which do no less mock God than did Ananias; yea, because they
themselves being most gross contemners of God, are yet notwithstanding
unpunished for their wickedness. But as God hath poured out visible
graces upon his Church in the beginning, to the end we may know that he
will be present with us by the secret power of his Spirit, yea, he
showed that openly by external signs, which we feel inwardly by the
experiment of faith; so he declared by the visible punishment of two,
how horrible a judgment remaineth for all hypocrites, which shall mock
God and his Church.

<span id="xii.i-p22"></span>*And there came great fear* This was the
Lord’s purpose, by punishing one to make the rest afraid, that they
might reverently beware of all hypocrisy. And that which Luke saith,
that *they feared,* doth appertain unto us also. For God meant to give
all ages a lesson at that time, that they may learn to deal sincerely
and uprightly with him. In the mean season, the punishment of this
wicked person ought to have encouraged the godly hereafter to consecrate
their goods more freely to God and the poor; because they might gather
how precious alms was in the sight of God, seeing the profaning thereof
was so punished.  <span id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md)
