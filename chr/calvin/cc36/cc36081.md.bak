<span id="xvi.vii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.vii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
9:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#026.md)<span id="xvi.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p2"></span>**26.** And when Saul was at Jerusalem, he
essayed to join himself to the disciples, and they were all afraid of
him, not believing that he was a disciple. **27.** But when Barnabas had
taken him, he brought him to the apostles, and he told them how that he
had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he
had behaved himself boldly at Damascus, in the name of Jesus, **28.**
And he was conversant with them at Jerusalem; and when he was emboldened
in the name of the Lord Jesus, **29.** He spake, and disputed with the
Grecians. And they went about to kill him. **30.** Which when the
brethren knew, they brought him to Cesarea, and sent him to Tarsus.
**31.** Then the churches throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and
Samaria, had peace; and they were edified, and walked in the fear of the
Lord, and were filled with the consolation of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="xvi.vii-p4"></span><span id="xvi.vii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p5"></span>**26.** *When Saul was.* These were yet
hard entrances  <span id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616.md) for Paul, who
was as yet but a freshwater soldier, in that, when he had hardly escaped
the hands of the enemies, the disciples would not receive him. For he
might have seemed to have been so tossed to and fro, as it were, in
mockery, that he could have no resting place. All his own nation was set
against him for Christ’s cause. The Christians refuse him. Might he not
have been quite discouraged and out of hope as one expelled out of men’s
company? First, what remaineth but that he fall away from the Church,
seeing he is not received? But when he remembereth the life which he had
led aforetime he marvelleth not that they are afraid  <span
id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617.md) of him. Therefore, he doth patiently
suffer the brethren to refuse his company, seeing they had just cause of
fear. This was true conversion, that whereas he raged horribly before,
he doth now valiantly suffer the storms of persecutions; and, in the
mean season, when as he cannot be admitted into the company of the
godly, he waiteth with a quiet mind until God reconcile them unto him.
We must diligently note what he desireth, to wit, that he may be
numbered amongst the disciples of Christ. This can he not obtain. Here
is no ambition, but he was to be instructed by this means to make more
account even of the lowest place amongst the disciples of Christ than of
all masterships in corrupt and revolted  <span
id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618.md) synagogues, And from this submission
was he exalted unto the highest degree of honor, that he might be the
principal doctor of the Church, even unto the end of the world. But no
man is fit to be a teacher in the Church save only he who willingly
submitteth himself,  <span id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619.md) that he may
be a fellow disciple with other men.

<span id="xvi.vii-p10"></span><span id="xvi.vii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p11"></span>**27.** *When Barnabas had taken him.*
Whereas the disciples fled so fast from Paul, that was, peradventure, a
point of too great fearfulness,  <span id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620.md)
and yet he speaketh of none of the common sort, but of the apostles
themselves. But he doth either extenuate or lighten their fault, because
they suspected him for just causes, whom they had found and tried  <span
id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md) to be such a deadly enemy; and, it was
to be feared, lest they should rashly endanger themselves if they should
have showed themselves to be so easy to entreat. Therefore, I think that
they are not to be blamed for that fear which they conceived for just
cause, or that they deserve to be even accused for the same. For if they
had been called to give an account of their faith, they would have
provoked  <span id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md) not Paul only, but
also all the furies of hell, without fear. Whence we gather that every
fear is not to be condemned but such as causeth us to turn aside from
our duty. The narration which Luke addeth may be referred as well unto
the person of Barnabas as of Paul. Yet I think rather that Paul
declareth to the apostles what had befallen him; and yet the speech may
be well applied to Barnabas, especially when as mention is made of
Paul’s boldness.

<span id="xvi.vii-p15"></span><span id="xvi.vii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p16"></span>**28.** Luke saith afterwards that Paul
*went in and out with the disciples,* which speech signifieth amongst
the Hebrews familiarity, as the inhabitants of cities are said to go in
and out at the gates of the city. Therefore after that Paul was
commended by the testimony of Barnabas, he began to be counted one of
the flock, that he might be thoroughly known to the Church. Luke saith
again that he dealt boldly in the name of the Lord, by which words he
commendeth his (stoutness and) courage in professing the gospel. For he
durst never have whispered amidst so many lets, unless he had been
endowed with rare constancy. Nevertheless, all men are taught what they
ought to do; to wit, every man according to the measure of his faith.
For though all be not Pauls, yet the faith of Christ ought to engender
in our minds so great boldness, that we be not altogether dumb when we
have need to speak. I take *the name of the Lord* in this place for the
profession of the gospel; in this sense, that Paul defended Christ’s
cause manfully.

<span id="xvi.vii-p17"></span><span id="xvi.vii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p18"></span>**29.** *He disputed with the Grecians.*
Erasmus noteth well in this place that those are here called Grecians,
not which came  <span id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623.md) of Grecians, but
rather those Jews who were scattered throughout divers parts of the
world. Those men were wont to come together  <span
id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624.md) to Jerusalem to worship. And it is to
be thought that Paul disputed rather with strangers and aliens,  <span
id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625.md) than with those who dwelt at
Jerusalem,  <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626.md) because this latter
sort would never have abidden him, neither had it been wisely done to
come in their sight. Therefore being excluded from those who knew him
before he tried whether there were any hope to do good amongst men whom
he knew not, so that he did most stoutly whatsoever concerned the duty
of a valiant soldier.

<span id="xvi.vii-p23"></span>*They would have slain him.* Behold,
again, fury instead of zeal; and it cannot otherwise be, but that
hypocrisy and superstition will be cruel and fierce. The godly must be
incensed with an holy wrath, when they see the pure truth of God
corrupted with false and wicked opinions; yet, so that they moderate
their zeal, that they set down nothing until they have thoroughly
weighed the cause; and, secondly, that they essay to bring those into
the way who wander out of the same. Lastly, that if they see their
stubbornness to be past hope, they themselves take not the sword in
hand, because they must know that they have no authority granted them of
the Lord to (punish or) revenge. But hypocrites are always ready to shed
blood before they know the matter; so that superstition is bloody,
through blind and headlong fury. But Paul, who of late ran up and down
to vex the godly, can abide nowhere now.  <span
id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627.md) And yet this estate was far better for
him, than if he should have reigned in peace and quietness, driving the
godly everywhere out of their places.

<span id="xvi.vii-p25"></span><span id="xvi.vii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p26"></span>**30.** In that he went to Tarsus, he did
it undoubtedly to this end, that he might carry the doctrine of the
gospel thither, because he hoped that he should have some favor and
authority in his country, where he was famous; yet was he brought
thither by the brethren, that they might deliver him from the lying in
wait.

<span id="xvi.vii-p27"></span><span id="xvi.vii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p28"></span>**31.** *Then the Churches.* Luke’s
meaning is, that the enemies of the gospel were greatly provoked by
Paul’s presence. For why was there such peace made suddenly by his
departure, save only because the very sight of him did provoke the fury
of the enemies? And yet this is no reproach to him, as if he had been,
as it were, some trumpet in war; but Luke doth rather commend him for
this, because he made the wicked run mad, only with the smell of him
when he was near them. For Christ meant so to triumph in him, that he
might be no less a trouble than an ornament to his Church.

<span id="xvi.vii-p29"></span>Therefore we are taught by this example
that those are not by and by  <span id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628.md) to
be condemned, who inflame the madness of the wicked more than others;
which admonition is not a little profitable. For as we are too dainty
and too much besotted with the love of our own rest, so we be also
sometimes angry with the best and most excellent servants of Christ, if
we think that through their vehemency the wicked are pricked forward to
do hurt; and by this means we do injury to the Spirit of God, whose
force and speech kindleth all that flame.

<span id="xvi.vii-p31"></span>And whereas Luke saith, that the Churches
had peace, let us know that it was not continual, but because the Lord
granted his servants some short breathing. For thus doth he bear with
 <span id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629.md) our infirmity, when he
appeaseth or mitigateth the winds and storms of persecutions, lest if
they should hold on still, they should urge us out of measure. And this
blessing is not to be despised, neither is it any common blessing, when
as the Churches have peace. But Luke addeth other things, which are of
far more value; to wit, that the Churches were edified, they walked in
the fear of God, and they were filled with the consolation of the
Spirit. For as we are wont to riot and exceed in time of peace, the
Churches are more happy, for the most part, amidst the tumults of war,
than if they should enjoy what rest they would desire. But and if holy
conversation, and the consolation of the Spirit, whereby their state
doth flourish, be taken away, they lose not only their felicity, but
they come to nought. Therefore, let us learn not to abuse external peace
in banqueting and idleness; but the more rest we have given us from our
enemies, to encourage ourselves to go forward in godliness whilst we
may. And if at any time the Lord let loose the bridle to the wicked to
trouble us, let the inward consolation of the Spirit be sufficient for
us. Finally, as well in peace as in war, let us always joyfully go
forward toward him who hath a reward for us.  <span
id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630.md)

<span id="xvi.vii-p34"></span>Edification may be taken either for
increase; to wit, whilst the Churches are augmented with the number of
the faithful, or for their going forward who are already in the flock;
to wit, whilst they have new gifts given them, and have greater
confirmation of godliness. In the first signification it shall be
referred unto the persons; in the second unto the gifts of the Spirit. I
embrace both willingly; that there were some every now and then gathered
unto the Church who were strangers before, and those who were of the
household of the Church did increase in godliness and other virtues.
Furthermore, the metaphor of a building is very convenient, because the
Church is the temple and house of God, and every one of the faithful is
also a temple, (<span id="xvi.vii-p34.1"></span>[1Ti
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md)<span id="xvi.vii-p34.1"></span>;
<span id="xvi.vii-p34.2"></span>[1Co
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#016)<span id="xvi.vii-p34.2"></span>..md)
The two things which follow, that they walked in the fear of God, and
that they were filled with the consolation of the Spirit, are parts of
that edification. Therefore, though the Churches had peace, yet they
were not drunken with delights and earthly joy, but, trusting to God’s
help, they were more emboldened to glorify God.
