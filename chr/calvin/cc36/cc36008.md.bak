<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Acts
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1.** The former speech truly have we had,
O Theophilus, of all things which Jesus began to do and teach, **2.**
Even until that day, wherein, after he had given commandment by the Holy
Ghost to the apostles, which he had chosen, he was taken up.

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span><span id="viii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span>That he may pass over unto those things
which followed the ascension of Christ, he briefly gathereth the sum of
all those which before he had handled in the former book, that he may
annex this thereunto. And he briefly setteth down this description of
the history of the gospel, that it is a narration of those things which
Christ did and said so long as he was conversant upon earth.
Furthermore, whereas they interpret this commonly, that there was first
in Christ purity of life, before such time as he began to preach, it
maketh nothing unto Luke’s mind. Truth it is, that the manners of a good
and godly teacher ought so to be framed, that he speak first with his
life, then with his tongue, otherwise he should differ nothing from a
stage-player. But Luke hath respect rather unto that which he had said
about the end of his gospel, (<span id="viii.i-p5.1"></span>[Lu
24:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#019)<span id="viii.i-p5.1"></span>,.md)
namely, that Christ was a prophet mighty in deed and word, that is, such
a one as did excel no less in deeds than in words; although there be but
small difference betwixt these two places. For the mightiness of works
which is commended there doth belong unto his miracles, but this, *to
do,* doth reach further in my opinion, namely, that under the same are
comprehended all the famous acts which were proper unto his ministry,
wherein his death and resurrection are the chiefest. For the office of
the Messias did not only consist in doctrine, but it was also behoveful
that he should make peace between God and man, that he should be a
Redeemer of the people, a restorer of the kingdom, and an author of
everlasting felicity. All these things, I say, as they were promised of
the Messias, so were they looked for at his hands.

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span>Now we see that the sum of the gospel
consisteth of these two parts, namely, of the doctrine of Christ, and of
his acts; forasmuch as he did not only bring unto men that embassage
which was given him in charge of his Father, but also performed all
things that could be required of the Messias. He began his kingdom, he
pacified God with his sacrifice, he purged man’s sins with his own
precious blood, he subdued death and the devil, he restored us unto true
liberty, he purchased righteousness and life for us. And to the end that
whatsoever he either did or said might be certain, he proved himself by
miracles to be the Son of God. So that this word, *to do,* is extended
unto his miracles also; but it must not be restrained only unto the
same. Here must we note, that those which have only the bare knowledge
of the history have not the gospel; unless the knowledge of the doctrine
which maketh manifest the fruits of the acts of Christ be adjoined
thereunto. For this is a holy knot which no man may dissolve. Therefore,
whensoever mention is made of the doctrine of Christ, let us learn to
adjoin thereunto his works, as seals whereby the truth thereof is
established and confirmed, and the effect declared. Furthermore, that we
may reap commodity by his death and resurrection, and also that miracles
may have their use, we must always have respect unto him that speaketh.
For this is the true rule of Christianity.

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span>**1.** *Of all things which he began* I do
not greatly mislike the interpretation which some give of this place
that Luke said rather of *all* than *all;* because it is possible in
some measure to intreat of the works and doctrine of Christ, but to set
down the whole course, that the narration may be perfect, were a matter
of great  <span id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) weight. Like as John doth
declare that the world could not contain the books, (<span
id="viii.i-p8.2"></span>[Joh
21:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#025)<span id="viii.i-p8.2"></span>..md)
That is also to be noted that Luke saith, that he began his history at
the beginning of the works of Christ. But so soon as he hath declared
the nativity of Christ, he passeth over unto the twelfth year of his age
(<span id="viii.i-p8.3"></span>[Lu
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#042)<span id="viii.i-p8.3"></span>;.md)
and after he had briefly spoken of his disputation had in the temple
with the doctors, passing over eighteen years without speaking any thing
of them, he entereth \[on\] the just narration of the works of Christ.
It is, therefore, manifest that those works and sayings only which make
any thing unto the sum of our salvation are noted in this place. For,
after that Christ came abroad into the world clothed with our flesh, he
lived privately at home until he was thirty years of age, at which time
his Father put upon him another manner of person. God would have him to
lead the former part of his life obscurely, to this end, that the
knowledge of these things might be more excellent which do edify our
faith.

<span id="viii.i-p9"></span>*The former speech.* It seemed good to me to
translate this on this wise, because <span id="viii.i-p9.1"></span>λογον
ποιεισθὰι, is the same with the Grecians, which *verba facere,* or to
speak, is with the Latins, as Budaeus doth note. And we must understand
the contrariety of the second part, which he taketh in hand, that we may
know that the evangelist determined with himself afresh to write, having
new matter whereupon to write.

<span id="viii.i-p10"></span><span id="viii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span>**2** *Even until that day.* Therefore, the
ascension of Christ is the end of the history of the gospel. For he hath
ascended, saith Paul, that he might fulfill all things, (<span
id="viii.i-p11.1"></span>[Eph
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010)<span id="viii.i-p11.1"></span>..md)
Our faith gathereth other fruit thereby; but it shall be sufficient to
note in this place, that our redemption was fully complete and finished
then when Christ did ascend unto his Father; and, therefore, that Luke
did fully perform his duty in this narration, as touching the doctrine
and works of Christ. And he is said to be taken up, that we may know
that he is truly departed out of this world, lest we should consent unto
their dotings who think that in his ascension there was no alteration of
place made.

<span id="viii.i-p12"></span>*Commandment by the Holy Ghost* Luke
showeth in these words, that Christ did not so depart out of the world
that he did no longer care for us; for in that he hath ordained a
perpetual government in his Church, he thereby declareth that he had a
care to provide for our salvation; yea, he hath promised that he will be
present with his to the end, (<span id="viii.i-p12.1"></span>[Mt
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020)<span id="viii.i-p12.1"></span>,.md)
like as, indeed, he is always present by his ministers. Luke, therefore,
doth show unto us, that Christ did no sooner depart hence, but
straightway he provided for the government of his Church; whence we may
gather that he is careful for our salvation. And this his providence
hath Paul plainly noted in the place lately cited, when he saith, That
he hath fulfilled all things, making some apostles, some evangelists,
some pastors, etc. But these commandments, which the evangelist saith
Christ gave unto his disciples, do I interpret of the preaching of the
gospel; like as ambassadors use to be instructed with certain precepts
before they go of their embassage, lest they should rashly attempt any
thing contrary to his will and mind that sendeth them. And all this is
spoken in commendation of that doctrine which the apostles taught. The
which that it may appear more manifestly, every thing is to be marked in
order as it lieth. First of all, he saith they were elect and chosen of
Christ, that we may be certain of their calling unto that function.
Neither doth he in this place set God’s election against man’s merits,
but only affirmeth that they were raised up by God, and that they did
not rashly take upon them this function. That is true, indeed, that they
were freely chosen; but now have we to inquire what is Luke’s drift in
this place. I say that he hath respect unto nothing else, but that we
may be certain of the calling of the apostles, that we may learn not to
have respect unto men, but unto the Son of God, the author thereof,
because this must always be a maxim in the Church, that no man usurp any
honor. Secondly, he saith, that they were instructed of Christ what they
should do. As if he should say, that they uttered not their own
inventions, but they delivered that sincerely and faithfully which was
enjoined them by their heavenly Master. And to the end that that which
Christ taught them might be the more reverenced, he addeth this, that
this was done by the direction of the Holy Ghost. Not because the Son of
God had any need to be guided by any other, who is eternal wisdom, but
because he was also man, lest any man should think that he did deliver
those things unto his disciples which he delivered by man’s wit and
reason, he calleth us back expressly unto the divine authority. Like as
the Lord himself doth so often affirm, that he taught nothing but that
which he had received of his Father; and therefore he saith, that his
doctrine was not his own. Therefore, he signifieth that in the preaching
of the gospel there is nothing which issueth from man’s brain, but that
it is the divine ordinance of the Spirit, whereunto the whole world must
be subject.
