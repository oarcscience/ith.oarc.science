<span id="xix.iv-p1"></span><span id="xix.iv-p1.1"></span>[Acts
12:19-25](../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#019.md)<span id="xix.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p2"></span>And descending from Judea to Cesarea, he
stayed there. **20.** And Herod was offended with those of Tyre and
Sidon: but they came unto him with one consent, and persuading Blastus,
the chamberlain to the king, they required peace, because their country
was nourished by the king’s country. **21.** And upon a day appointed
Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sitting upon his throne, he
made an oration unto them. **22.** And the people cried, It is the voice
of God, and not of man. **23.** And straightway the angel of the Lord
smote him, because he gave not the glory to God: and being eaten of
worms, he died. **24.** Furthermore, the word of God did increase and
multiply. **25.** And Barnabas and Paul returned from Jerusalem to
Antioch, having finished their office, taking John with them, which was
called Mark.

<span id="xix.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="xix.iv-p4"></span><span id="xix.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p5"></span>**20.** A worthy  <span
id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md) history, which doth not only show, as
it were in a glass, what end is prepared for the enemies of the Church,
but also how greatly God hateth pride. The Scripture saith that “God
resisteth the proud,” (<span id="xix.iv-p6.2"></span>[1Pe
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005)<span id="xix.iv-p6.2"></span>..md)
God himself did show a lively image thereof in the person of Herod. And
assuredly men cannot extol themselves higher than becometh them, but
they shall make war with God, who, to the end he may surpass all,  <span
id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md) commandeth all flesh to keep silence.
And if God did so sharply punish pride in a king whom prosperity did
puff up, what shall become of those of the common sort who are
ridiculously puffed up without cause? Furthermore, we must note the
course of the history, that all things go well with Herod after that he
had miserably vexed the Church; he enforced the nations round about him,
being tamed with hunger, to come to crave pardon upon their knees, as if
God had rewarded him well for his wicked fury. This was no small trial
for the godly, who might have thought thus with themselves  <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) that God cared not for them, and they
were afraid lest with Herod’s power his tyranny and cruelty should
increase. But the Lord had another purpose,  <span
id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md) for he set the oppressor of his Church
on high that he might have the greater fall. Therefore, that shadowish
felicity, wherein he delighted too much, was unto him a certain falling
against the day of slaughter. In like sort, when at this day we see the
bloody enemies of the Church carried up upon the wings of fortune into
heaven, there is no cause why we should be discouraged; but let us
rather call to mind that saying of Solomon,

<span id="xix.iv-p10"></span>“Pride goeth before calamity;  
and the heart is lifted up before a fall,”  
(<span id="xix.iv-p10.3"></span>[Pr
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#018)<span id="xix.iv-p10.3"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.iv-p11"></span>*Herod was displeased.* Luke useth the
compound participle, <span id="xix.iv-p11.1"></span>θυμομαχον which
signifieth *privy grudging* or *hatred.* Therefore Herod did not make
open war against those cities; but such was his displeasure, that he
essayed to subdue them by policy, as it were by undermining them by
little and little. It is a rare matter, saith Demosthenes, for free
cities to agree with monarchs. Moreover, Herod was naturally cruel,
bold, of insatiable covetousness; and it is not to be doubted but that
Tyre and Sidon were, as it were, certain bars or rails to stay his fury,
as they were wealthy cities, and unaccustomed to bear the yoke. Also,
the remembrance of their old glory might have encouraged them; forasmuch
as pride cometh commonly of wealth, it is no marvel if these two cities
were proud, the one whereof Isaiah calleth queen of the seas, whose
merchants, he said, were kings, and her chapmen dukes, (<span
id="xix.iv-p11.2"></span>[Isa
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#008)<span id="xix.iv-p11.2"></span>..md)
Also, he saith elsewhere that Sidon was become proud by reason of her
wealth. And although they had sundry times been brought almost to utter
ruin, yet the commodiousness of their situation did shortly restore them
to their wonted state. Hereby it came to pass that they could more
hardly digest Agrippa, of late a base fellow, a man of no estimation,
 <span id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) and one who had been let out of
prison; especially seeing that he had behaved himself so cruelly toward
his own subjects, and was troublesome and injurious to his neighbors.

<span id="xix.iv-p13"></span>*Forasmuch as their country was nourished.*
It had not been good for him to have assailed the men of Tyre and Sidon
with open war, therefore he giveth commandment that there should no corn
nor victual be carried  <span id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md) out of
his realm. By this means did he, without any army, besiege them by
little and little. For the borders of both cities were strait, and their
ground barren, whereas there was a great people to be fed. Therefore,
after that they were tamed with hunger, they humbly crave peace, and
that not free, for assuredly they had some laws given them; and it is to
be thought that this Blastus mentioned by Luke was not with bare words
persuaded, but with rewards \[gifts\] won to entreat the peace.  <span
id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md) I know not why Erasmus did think it
good to translate this place otherwise than the words import.

<span id="xix.iv-p16"></span><span id="xix.iv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p17"></span>**21.** *Upon an appointed day.* Luke saith
that the men of Tyrus and Sidon had peace granted them, because this was
the occasion of the king’s oration, without doubt, that he might make
them his underlings hereafter. The same history is extant in Josephus,
in his Nineteenth Book of Antiquities, save only that he calleth him
everywhere Agrippa, whom Luke calleth Herod. It is to be thought that
Agrippa was his proper name, and that he was called by none other name
so long as he was a private man; but after that he was advanced to be a
king, he took to himself princely dignity, according to the name of his
grandfather. Josephus and Luke agree together wonderfully in the thing
itself, and in all circumstances. First, they agree concerning the
place. Josephus saith, That his garment was embroidered with gold, on
which, when the sun-beams light, it did glister again; and that this was
the cause which moved the courtiers to call him  <span
id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) a god. That he was suddenly wounded;
also, that there was seen an owl sitting upon a cord over his head,
which cord did prognosticate his ruin. And he is so far from doubting
that his sacrilegious pride was punished with this kind of punishment,
that he saith, that he confessed the same openly amidst his cruel
torments, “Behold me, whom you call a god; I am enforced to finish my
life most miserable.” There is no mention made there of the peace made
with those of Tyrus and Sidon; but that he made and set forth plays
 <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) in honor of Caesar. But it may
be that the solemnity of the plays was appointed in respect of the peace
concluded, which we know was a solemn thing.

<span id="xix.iv-p20"></span><span id="xix.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p21"></span>**23.** *Forthwith he smote him.* As,
before, the angel was a minister of God’s grace in the delivery of
Peter, so now he taketh vengeance upon Herod. And God doth sometimes use
the ministry of angels in heaven in punishing; but sometimes he maketh
the devils as hangmen, by whose hand he executeth his judgments. And
this doth he as well toward his faithful servants as toward the
reprobate. Saul was troubled and vexed by Satan, (<span
id="xix.iv-p21.1"></span>[1Sa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014)<span id="xix.iv-p21.1"></span>.md)
but the same did also befall holy Job, (<span
id="xix.iv-p21.2"></span>[Job 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#012.md),
[Job 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#007.md)<span
id="xix.iv-p21.2"></span>.) In the Psalms, the punishments wherewith God
doth chasten the wicked are attributed to the evil angels; yet we see
how the angel which had the government of the safety of the Church
smiteth the Egyptians in the first-begotten, (<span
id="xix.iv-p21.3"></span>[Ex
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#029)<span id="xix.iv-p21.3"></span>;.md)
although the Scripture calleth the wicked spirits God’s spirits, because
they are obedient to his commandment, though full sore against their
will. But where the epithet *evil* is not added, as in this place, we
must understand the angel which doth willingly obey God, and yet the
shape of the owl, whereof Josephus maketh mention, did rather serve to
figure the devil than an heavenly angel.

<span id="xix.iv-p22"></span>Furthermore, I dare not affirm for a surety
what manner of disease that was. The word which Luke useth doth signify
that he was eaten up of worms. Many conjecture that it was a lousy
disease. This is certain, that even when he was yet alive he was corrupt
with stink and rottenness, so that he was, as it were, a living carcass.
So that he was not only vexed with cruel torments, but also made a
laughing-stock to all men, and of all men reviled. For God intended to
make choice of a kind of punishment wherewith he might repress the
cruelty of a proud man with extreme ignominy. If he had been overcome of
some great and valiant army, and had been brought to poverty, the
judgment of God had not been so marked; and this had been an honest and
princely chastisement;  <span id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) but
forasmuch as he abhorreth lice and worms, and this filthiness cometh out
of his body, which doth kill him by eating him up, he is handled
according to his deserts.

<span id="xix.iv-p24"></span>In like sort Pharaoh, forasmuch as he did
so oft exalt himself against God with untamed pride, he was not orderly
assailed by some prince that did border upon him, but locusts and
caterpillars were God’s warriors \[soldiers\] to make war against him,
(<span id="xix.iv-p24.1"></span>[Exod.
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#017.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#024)<span id="xix.iv-p24.1"></span>;.md)
for the more proudly a man exalteth himself, the more doth he deserve to
be cast doom of God into the lowest hell with shame and reproach. This
is the reason why he set this reigned god Herod to be eaten up of worms,
which he was at length enforced to grant, when he said, “Behold me, whom
ye saluted as a god; I die miserable.” Such a manifest example of
horrible vengeance in a king’s person ought to terrify us not a little
from presuming to take to ourselves more than we ought; and that we do
not suffer ourselves to be made drunk with the false commendation and
flattery of men as with deadly poison.

<span id="xix.iv-p25"></span>*Because he gave not the glory to God.* He
is condemned of sacrilege, not only because he suffered himself to be
called God, but because, forgetting himself, he took to himself the
honor due to God. We do not read that the king of Babylon was thus
extolled; and yet the prophet upbraideth to him that he went about to
make himself equal with God, (<span id="xix.iv-p25.1"></span>[Isa.
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#014)<span id="xix.iv-p25.1"></span>..md)
Therefore this sacrilege is a common fault in all proud men, because, by
taking to themselves more than they ought, they darken the glory of God;
and so, like giants, so much as ever they are able, they endeavor to
pluck God out of his seat. Howsoever, they do not usurp the title of
God, neither openly boast with their mouth that they are gods; yet
because they take to themselves that which is proper to God, they desire
to be, and to be accounted gods, having brought him under, furthermore,
the prophet pointeth out the beginning of this evil in one word, when he
bringeth in Nebuchadnezzar speaking on this wise, “I will go up,” (<span
id="xix.iv-p25.2"></span>[Isa
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#013)<span id="xix.iv-p25.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.iv-p26"></span>Wherefore there is but one remedy, if every
one keep himself in that degree wherein he is placed. Let those who are
base and castaways \[in a humble station\] not desire to climb higher;
let kings, and those who are above others, remember that they are
mortal, and let them modestly submit their highness to God. And we must
note, that it is not enough if men give to God only half the honor which
is due to him, who challengeth all that wholly which is his own; if they
submit themselves but in part, whom he will have to be thoroughly
humbled. Now, forasmuch as the Scripture despoileth us quite of all
praise of wisdom, virtue, and righteousness, there is no one of us that
can take to himself the least jot of glory without sacrilegious robbing
of God. And it is a wonder that, seeing the Scripture pronounceth that
all those make, as it were, open war against God which exalt themselves;
and we do all grant that that cannot be done without our overthrow,
\[destruction;\] the greatest part of men runneth, notwithstanding,
headlong with furious boldness unto their own destruction; for there is
scarce one of an hundred who, being mindful of his condition, doth leave
to God his glory undiminished.

<span id="xix.iv-p27"></span><span id="xix.iv-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p28"></span>**24.** *And the word of God.* When the
tyrant was once taken out of the way the Church was suddenly delivered,
as it were, out of the jaws of the wolf. Therefore, though the faithful
be accounted as sheep appointed to be slain, (<span
id="xix.iv-p28.1"></span>[Ps
44:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#023)<span id="xix.iv-p28.1"></span>,.md)
yet the Church doth always overlive her enemies; and though the word of
God seem oftentimes to be oppressed with the wicked tyranny of men, yet
it getteth up the head again by and by, (<span
id="xix.iv-p28.2"></span>[Ro 8:37](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037.md)<span
id="xix.iv-p28.2"></span>.) For Luke determined  <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) not only what had happened after that
Herod was dead, but also by this example to encourage us, that we may be
assured that God will do that, in all ages, which he then did, to the
end the gospel may at length break through all impediments of the
enemies, and that the more the Church is diminished, it may the more
increase through the heavenly blessing.

<span id="xix.iv-p30"></span><span id="xix.iv-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p31"></span>**25** *And Barnabas and Paul.* The
ministry which Luke saith Barnabas and Paul did finish, must be referred
unto the alms, whereof mention was made before. For after that Agabus
the prophet had foretold the famine and barrenness, the brethren
gathered money at Antioch, whereby they might relieve the necessity of
the church which was at Jerusalem; the carrying of this money was
committed to Barnabas and Paul. Now Luke saith that they returned to
Antioch, that he may pass over unto a new history. He addeth, *that they
took with them John, whose surname was Mark,* whose mother was honorably
commended before, that he might keep them company, who was afterward, as
we shall see, a cause of grievous and dangerous \[hurtful\] discord
between them.
