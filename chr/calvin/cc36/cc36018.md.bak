<span id="ix.iii-p1"></span><span id="ix.iii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
2:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#014.md)<span id="ix.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p2"></span>**14.** But Peter, standing with the eleven,
lift up his voice, and spoke unto them, Ye men of Judea, and all ye
which dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known unto you, and with your ears
hear my words. **15.** For these men are not drunk as ye suppose; for it
is the third hour of the day. **16.** But this is that which was spoken
by the prophet Joel, **17.** And it shall be in the last days, saith
God, I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your
daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your
elders shall dream dreams: **18.** Verily, I will pour out of my Spirit
in those days upon my servants, and upon mine handmaids, and they shall
prophesy. **19.** And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs
upon the earth beneath, blood and fire, and vapor of smoke. **20.** The
sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the
great and notable day of the Lord do come. **21.** And it shall come to
pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord he shall be
saved.

<span id="ix.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.iii-p4"></span><span id="ix.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p5"></span>**14.** *And Peter, standing* By this word
*standing* he did signify, that there was a grave sermon made in the
assembly; for they did rise when they spoke unto the people, to the end
they might be the better heard. The sum of this sermon is this, he
gathereth that Christ is already revealed and given by the gift of the
Holy Ghost, which they saw. Yet, first, he refuteth that false opinion,
in that they thought that the disciples were drunk. This refutation
consisteth upon a probable argument; because men use not to be drunk
betimes in the morning. For, as Paul saith,

<span id="ix.iii-p6"></span>“Those which are drunk are drunk in the
night,”  
(<span id="ix.iii-p6.2"></span>[1Th
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#007)<span id="ix.iii-p6.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.iii-p7"></span>For they flee the light for shame. And
surely so great is the filthiness of this vice, that for good causes it
hateth the light. And yet this argument were not always good; for Esaias
doth inveigh in his time against those which did rise early to follow
drunkenness. And at this day there be many who, like hogs, so soon as
they awake, run to quaffing. But because this is  <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) a common custom amongst men, Peter saith,
that it is no likely thing. Those which have but even small skill in
antiquity do know that the civil day, from the rising of the sun until
the going down thereof, was divided into twelve hours; so that the hours
were longer in summer, and shorter in winter. Therefore, that which
should now be the ninth before noon in winter, and in summer the eighth,
was the third hour amongst the old people.  <span
id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) Therefore, whereas Peter doth only
lightly remove the opinion of drunkenness, he doth it for this cause,
because it had been superfluous to have stood about any long excuse.
 <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) Therefore, as in a matter which
was certain and out of doubt, he doth rather pacify those which mocked,
than labor to teach them. And he doth not so much refute them by the
circumstance of time, as by the testimony of Joel. For when he saith
that that is now come to pass which was foretold, he toucheth briefly
their unthankfulness, because they do not acknowledge such an excellent
benefit promised unto them in times past which they now see with their
eyes. And whereas he upbraideth the fault of a few unto all,  <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) he doth it not to this end, that he may
make them all guilty of the same fault; but because a fit occasion was
offered by their mocking to teach them altogether, he doth not foreslow
the same.  <span id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md)

<span id="ix.iii-p13"></span><span id="ix.iii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p14"></span>**17.** *It shall be in the last days* By
this effect he proveth that the Messiah is already revealed. Joel,
indeed, doth not express the last days, (<span
id="ix.iii-p14.1"></span>[Joe
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#029)<span id="ix.iii-p14.1"></span>;.md)
but for as much as he intreateth of the perfect restoring of the Church,
it is not to be doubted but that that prophecy belongeth unto the last
age alone. Wherefore, that which Peter bringeth doth no whit dissent
from Joel’s meaning; but he doth only add this word for exposition sake,
that the Jews might know that the Church could by no other means be
restored, which was then decayed, but by being renewed by the Spirit of
God. Again, because the repairing of the Church should be like unto a
new world, therefore Peter saith that it shall be in the last days. And
surely this was a common and familiar thing among the Jews, that all
those great promises concerning the blessed and well-ordered state of
the Church should not be fulfilled until Christ, by his coming, should
restore all things. Wherefore, it was out of all doubt amongst them,
that that which is cited out of Joel doth appertain unto the last time.
Now, by the last days, or fullness of time, is meant the stable and firm
condition of the Church, in the manifestation or revealing of Christ.

<span id="ix.iii-p15"></span>*I will pour out my Spirit* He intendeth to
prove, (as we have already said,) that the Church can be repaired by no
other means, saving only by the giving of the Holy Spirit. Therefore,
forasmuch as they did all hope that the restoring drew near, he accuseth
them of sluggishness, because they do not once think upon the way and
means thereof. And when the prophet saith, “I will pour out,” it is,
without all question, that he meant by this word to note the great
abundance of the Spirit. And we must take *I will pour out of my Spirit*
in the same sense, as if he had said simply, I will pour out my Spirit.
For these latter words are the words of the prophet. But Peter followed
the Grecians, who translate the Hebrew word <span
id="ix.iii-p15.1"></span>ח, *(cheth,)* <span
id="ix.iii-p15.2"></span>απο Therefore, some men do in vain more
subtlely play the philosophers; because, howsoever the words be changed,
yet must we still retain and keep the prophet’s meaning. Nevertheless,
when God is said to pour out his Spirit, I confess it must be thus
understood, that he maketh manifold variety and change of gifts to flow
unto men from his Spirit, as it were out of the only fountain, the
fountain which can never be drawn dry. For, as Paul doth testify, there
be divers gifts, and yet but one Spirit, (<span
id="ix.iii-p15.3"></span>[1Co
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004)<span id="ix.iii-p15.3"></span>..md)
And hence do we gather a profitable doctrine, that we can have no more
excellent thing given us of God than the grace of the Spirit; yea, that
all other things are nothing worth if this be wanting. For, when God
will briefly promise salvation to his people, he affirmeth that he will
give them his Spirit. Hereupon it followeth that we can obtain no good
things until we have the Spirit given us. And truly it is, as it were,
the key which openeth unto us the door, that we may enter into all the
treasures of spiritual good things; and that we may also have entrance
into the kingdom of God.

<span id="ix.iii-p16"></span>*Upon all flesh* It appeareth, by that
which followeth, of what force this generality is; for, first, it is set
down generally, *all flesh;* after that the partition is added, whereby
the prophet doth signify that there shall be no difference of age or
kind, but that God admitteth all, one with another, unto the partaking
of his grace. It is said, therefore, *all flesh,* because both young and
old, men and women, are thereby signified; yet here may a question be
moved, why Clod doth promise that unto his people, as some new and
unwonted good thing, which he was wont to do for them from the beginning
throughout all ages; for there was no age void of the grace of the
Spirit. The answer of this question is set down in these two sentences:
“I will pour out,” and, “Upon all flesh;” for we must here note a double
contrariety,  <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md) between the time of
the Old and New Testament; for the pouring out (as I have said) doth
signify great plenty, when as there was under the law a more scarce
distribution; for which cause John also doth say that the Holy Ghost was
not given until Christ ascended into heaven. *All flesh* cloth signify
an infinite multitude, whereas God in times past did vouchsafe to bestow
such plenty of his Spirit only upon a few.

<span id="ix.iii-p18"></span>Furthermore, in both comparisons we do not
deny but that the fathers under the law were partakers of the self, same
grace whereof we are partakers; but the Lord doth show that we are above
them, as we are indeed. I say, that all godly men since the beginning of
the world were endued with the same spirit of understanding, of
righteousness, and sanctification, wherewith the Lord doth at this day
illuminate and regenerate us; but there were but a few which had the
light of knowledge given them then, if they be compared with the great
multitude of the faithful, which Christ did suddenly gather together by
his coming. Again, their knowledge was but obscure and slender, and, as
it were, covered with a veil, if it be compared with that which we have
at this day out of the gospel, where Christ, the Sun of righteousness,
doth shine with perfect brightness, as it were at noon day. Neither doth
that any whit hurt or hinder that a few had such an excellent faith,
that peradventure they have no equal at this day. For their
understanding did nevertheless smell or savor of the instruction and
schoolmastership  <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) of the law. For
that is always true, that godly kings and prophets have not seen nor
heard those things which Christ hath revealed by his coming. Therefore,
to the end the prophet Joel may commend the excellency of the New
Testament, he affirmeth and foretelleth that the grace of the Spirit
shall be more plentiful in time thereof; and, again, that it shall come
unto more men, (<span id="ix.iii-p19.2"></span>[Mt
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017.md)<span id="ix.iii-p19.2"></span>;
<span id="ix.iii-p19.3"></span>[Lu
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024)<span id="ix.iii-p19.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.iii-p20"></span>*And your sons shall prophesy* By the word
*prophesy* he meant to note the rare and singular gift of understanding.
And to the same purpose tendeth that partition which followeth
afterwards, *“your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall
dream dreams;”* for we gather out of the twelfth chapter of Numbers,
that these were the two ordinary ways whereby God did reveal himself to
the prophets. For in that place, when the Lord exempteth Moses from the
common sort of prophets, he saith,

<span id="ix.iii-p21"></span>“I appear unto my servants by a vision, or
by a dream; but I speak unto Moses face to face,”  
(<span id="ix.iii-p21.2"></span>[Nu
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006)<span id="ix.iii-p21.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.iii-p22"></span>Therefore, we see that two kinds are put
after the general word for a confirmation; yet this is the sum, that
they shall all be prophets so soon as the Holy Ghost shall be poured out
from heaven. But here it is objected, that there was no such thing, even
in the apostles themselves, neither yet in the whole multitude of the
faithful. I answer, that the prophets did commonly use to shadow under
tropes most fit for their time,  <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md)
the kingdom of Christ. When they speak of the worship of God, they name
the altar, the sacrifices, the offering of gold, silver, and
frankincense. Notwithstanding, we know that the altars do cease, the
sacrifices are abolished, whereof there was some use in time of the law;
and that the Lord requireth some higher thing at our hands than earthly
riches. That is true, indeed; but the prophets, whilst they apply their
style unto the capacity of their time, comprehend under figures
(wherewith the people were then well acquainted) those things which we
see otherwise revealed and showed now, like as when he promiseth
elsewhere that he will make priests of Levites, and Levites of the
common sort of men, (<span id="ix.iii-p23.2"></span>[Isa
66:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#021)<span id="ix.iii-p23.2"></span>,.md)
this is his meaning, that under the kingdom of Christ every base person
shall be extolled unto an honorable estate; therefore, if we desire to
\]lave the true and natural meaning of this place, we must not urge the
words which are taken out of the old order  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) of the law; but we must only seek the
truth without figures, and this is it, that the apostles, through the
sudden inspiration of the Spirit, did intreat of the heavenly mysteries
prophetically, that is to say, divinely, and above the common order.

<span id="ix.iii-p25"></span>Therefore, this word *prophesy* doth
signify nothing else save only the rare and excellent gift of
understanding, as if Joel should say, Under the kingdom of Christ there
shall not be a few prophets only, unto whom God may reveal his secrets;
but all men shall be endued with spiritual wisdom, even to the
prophetical excellency. As it is also in Jeremiah,

<span id="ix.iii-p26"></span>“Every man shall no longer teach his
neighbor; because they shall all know me, from the least unto the
greatest,”  
(<span id="ix.iii-p26.2"></span>[Jer
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034)<span id="ix.iii-p26.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.iii-p27"></span>And in these words Peter inviteth the Jews,
unto whom he speaketh, to be partakers of the same grace. As if he
should say, the Lord is ready to pour out that Spirit far and wide which
he hath poured upon us. Therefore, unless you yourselves be the cause of
let, ye shall receive with us of this fullness. And as for us, let us
know that the same is spoken to us at this day which was then spoken to
the Jews. For although those visible graces of the Spirit be ceased, yet
God hath not withdrawn his Spirit from his Church. Wherefore he offereth
him daily unto us all, by this same promise, without putting any
difference. Wherefore we are poor and needy only through our own
sluggishness; and also it appeareth manifestly, that those are wicked
and sacrilegious enemies of the Spirit which keep back the Christian
common people from the knowledge of God; and forasmuch as he himself
doth not only admit, but also call by name unto himself, women and men,
young and old.

<span id="ix.iii-p28"></span><span id="ix.iii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p29"></span>**18.** *Upon my servants.* In these words
the promise is restrained unto the worshippers of God. For God doth not
profane his Spirit; which he should do, if he should make the stone
common to the unbelieving and despisers. It is certain that we are made
the servants of God by the Spirit; and that, therefore, we are not,
until such time as we have received the same; but, first, whom God hath
adopted to be of his family, and whom he hath framed by his Spirit to
obey him, those doth he furnish with new gifts afterward. Again, the
prophet did not respect that order of thee, but his meaning was to make
this grace proper to the Church alone. And forasmuch as the Church was
only among the Jews, he calleth them honorably the servants and
handmaids of God. But after that God did gather unto himself on every
side a Church, the wall of separation being pulled down, so many as are
received into the society of the covenant are called by the same name.
Only let us remember, that the Spirit is appointed for the Church
properly.

<span id="ix.iii-p30"></span><span id="ix.iii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p31"></span>**19.** *And I will show wonders* We must
first see what is meant by this great day of the Lord. Some do expound
it of the former coming of Christ in the flesh; and others refer it unto
the last day of the resurrection, I do allow neither opinion. For, in my
judgment, the prophet comprehendeth the whole kingdom of Christ. And so
he calleth it the *great day,* after that the Son of God began to be
revealed in the flesh, that he may lead us into the fulfilling of his
kingdom. Therefore, he appointeth no certain day, but he beginneth this
day at the first preaching of the gospel, and he extendeth the same unto
the last resurrection. Those which restrain it unto the time of the
apostles are moved with this reason, because the prophet joineth this
member and that which goeth next before together. But in that there is
no absurdity at all, because the prophet doth assign the time when these
things began to come to pass, howsoever they have a continual going
forward even until the end of the world. Furthermore, whereas he saith
that the sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon into blood, they
are figurative speeches, whereby he doth give us to understand thus
much, that the Lord will show tokens of his wrath through the whole
frame of the world, which shall bring men even to their wit’s end, as if
there should be some horrible and fearful change of nature wrought. For
as the sun and moon are unto us witnesses of God’s fatherly favor
towards us, whilst that by course they give light to the earth; so, on
the other side, the prophet saith, that they shall be messengers to
foreshow God’s wrath and displeasure. And this is the second member of
the prophecy. For after that he had intreated of the spiritual grace
which should be abundantly poured out upon all flesh, lest any man
should imagine that all things should be quiet and prosperous together,
therewithal he addeth that the estate of the world shall be troublesome,
and full of great fear under Christ; as Christ himself doth more fully
declare, <span id="ix.iii-p31.1"></span>[Matthew
24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#000.md)<span id="ix.iii-p31.1"></span> and
<span id="ix.iii-p31.2"></span>[Luke
21](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#000.md)<span id="ix.iii-p31.2"></span>.

<span id="ix.iii-p32"></span>But this serveth greatly to the setting
forth of grace, that whereas all things do threaten destruction, yet
whosoever doth call upon the name of the Lord is sure to be saved. By
the darkness of the sun, by the bloody streaming of the moon, by the
black vapor of smoke, the prophet meant to declare, that whithersoever
men turn their eyes, there shall many things appear, both upward and
downward, which may make them amazed and afraid, as he hath already
said. Therefore, this is as much as if he should have said, that the
world was never in a more miserable case, that there were never so many
and such cruel tokens of God’s wrath. Hence may we gather how
inestimable the goodness of God is, who offereth a present remedy for so
great evils; and again, how unthankful they are towards God, and how
froward, which do not flee unto the sanctuary of salvation, which is
nigh unto them, and doth meet them. Again, it is out of all doubt, that
God meaneth by this so doleful a description, to stir up all godly men,
that they may with a more fervent desire seek for salvation. And Peter
citeth it to the same end, that the Jews may know that they shall be
more miserable unless they receive that grace of the Spirit which is
offered unto them. Yet here may a question be asked, how this can hang
together, that when Christ is revealed, there should such a sea of
miseries overflow and break out therewithal? For it may seem to be a
thing very inconvenient,  <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) that he
should be the only pledge of God’s love toward mankind, in whom the
heavenly Father doth lay open all the treasure of his goodness, yea, he
poureth out the bowels of his mercy upon us, and that yet, by the coming
of the same, his Son, his wrath should be more hot than it was wont, so
that it should, as it were, quite consume both heaven and earth at once.

<span id="ix.iii-p34"></span>But we must first mark, that because men
are too slow to receive Christ, they must be constrained by divers
afflictions, as it were with whips. Secondly, forasmuch as Christ doth
call unto himself all those which are heavy laden and labor, (<span
id="ix.iii-p34.1"></span>[Mt
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028)<span id="ix.iii-p34.1"></span>,.md)
we must first be tamed by many miseries, that we may learn humility. For
through great prosperity men do set up the horns of pride. And he cannot
but despise Christ fiercely, whosoever he be, that seemeth to himself to
be happy. Thirdly, because we are, more than we ought, set upon the
seeking of the peace of the flesh, whereby it cometh to pass that many
tie the grace of Christ unto the present life, it is expedient for us to
be accustomed to think otherwise, that we may know that the kingdom of
Christ is spiritual. Therefore, to the end God may teach us that the
good things of Christ are heavenly, he doth exercise us, according to
the flesh, with many miseries; whereby it cometh to pass that we do seek
our felicity without the world. Moreover, men do bring miseries upon
themselves through their unthankfulness; for the servant which knoweth
his master’s will, and doth not obey, is worthy of greater and more
stripes, (<span id="ix.iii-p34.2"></span>[Lu
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047)<span id="ix.iii-p34.2"></span>..md)
The more familiarly that God doth communicate with us in Christ, the
more doth our ungodliness grow and break out into open contumacy, so
that it is no marvel if, when Christ is revealed, there appear many
tokens of God’s vengeance on the other side, forasmuch as men do hereby
more grievously provoke God against them, and kindle his wrath through
wicked contempt. Surely, in that the day of Christ is fearful, it is an
accidental thing; whether God will correct our slothfulness, to bring us
under, which \[who\] are yet inapt to be taught, or whether he will
punish our unthankfulness. For it bringeth with it of itself nothing but
that which is pleasant; but the contempt of God’s grace doth provoke him
to horrible anger not without cause.

<span id="ix.iii-p35"></span><span id="ix.iii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p36"></span>**21.** *Whosoever shall call upon* An
excellent place. For as God doth prick us forward like sluggish asses,
with threatenings and terrors to seek salvation, se, after that he hath
brought darkness upon the face of heaven and earth, yet doth he show a
means whereby salvation may shine before our eyes, to wit, if we shall
call upon him. For we must diligently note this circumstance. If God
should promise salvation simply, it were a great matter; but it is a far
greater when as he promiseth the same amidst manifold dungeons of death.
Whilst that (saith he) all things shall be out of order, and the fear of
destruction shall possess all things, only call upon me, and ye shall be
saved. Therefore, howsoever man be swallowed up ill the gulf of
miseries, yet is there set before him a way to escape. We must also note
the universal word, *whosoever* For God admitteth all men unto himself
without exception, and by this means doth he invite them to salvation,
as Paul gathereth in the tenth chapter to the Romans, and as the prophet
had set it down before,

<span id="ix.iii-p37"></span>“Thou, Lord, which hearest the prayer,  
unto thee shall all flesh come,”  
(<span id="ix.iii-p37.3"></span>[Ps
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002)<span id="ix.iii-p37.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.iii-p38"></span>Therefore, forasmuch as no man is excluded
from calling upon God, the gate of salvation is set open unto all men;
neither is there any other thing which keepeth us back from entering in,
save only our own unbelief. I speak of all unto whom God doth make
himself manifest by the gospel. But like as those which call upon the
name of the Lord are sure of salvation, so we must think that, without
the same, we are thrice miserable and undone. And when as our salvation
is placed in calling upon God, there is nothing in the mean season taken
from faith, forasmuch as this invocation is grounded on faith alone.
There is also another circumstance no less worthy the noting; in that
the prophet doth signify, that the calling upon God doth properly
appertain and agree unto the last days. For although he would be called
upon in all ages, notwithstanding, since that he showed himself to be a
Father in Christ, we have the more easy access unto him. Which thing
ought both the more to embolden us, and to take from us all
sluggishness. As he himself doth also reason, that by this privilege our
forwardness to pray is doubled to us: “Hitherto have ye asked nothing in
nay name; ask, and ye shall receive;” as if he should say, theretofore,
although I did not yet appear to be a mediator and advocate in the
faith, yet did ye pray; but now, when you shall have me to be your
patron, with how much more courage ought ye to do that?
