<span id="xvii.i-p1"></span><span id="xvii.i-p1.1"></span>[Acts
10:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001.md)<span id="xvii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And there was a certain man of
Cesarea named Cornelius, a captain \[centurion\] of the band which was
called the Italian band; **2.** A devout man, and one that feared God
with his household, and one which gave alms to all the people, and which
prayed to God continually. **3.** He saw plainly in a vision, about the
ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying to
him, Cornelius. **4.** And beholding, and being afraid, he said, What is
it, Lord? Then he said to him, Thy prayers and thy alms are come up into
remembrance before God. **5.** And now send men to Joppa, and fet \[send
for\] Simon, which is called Peter: **6.** He lodgeth with one Simon a
tanner, whose house lieth to the sea; he shall tell thee what thou must
do.

<span id="xvii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xvii.i-p4"></span><span id="xvii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p5"></span>**1.** Luke passeth over now unto a worthy
 <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) history, to wit, that God
vouchsafeth to advance a stranger, and one uncircumcised, unto singular
honor above all the Jews, because he doth both send his angel unto him,
and for his sake bringeth Peter to Cesarea, that he may instruct him in
the gospel. But first of all Luke showeth what manner of person this
Cornelius was, for whose cause an angel descended from heaven, and God
spake to Peter in a vision. He was a captain \[centurion\] of the
Italian band; a band \[cohort\] did consist upon \[of\] a thousand
footmen, and he which was chief captain was called a tribune, (or
marshal.) Again, every hundred had a captain. A legion had for the most
part five bands. That band was called the Italian band, because the
Romans did choose soldiers oftentimes from amongst those which dwelt in
the provinces; but they had the strength of the army  <span
id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) out of Italy; therefore, Cornelius was
an Italian born; but he was at Cesarea with his hundred, to guard the
city. For the Romans were wont so to distribute their places of abode,
 <span id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) that every city of renown might
have a garrison to stay sudden uproars. A rare example that a soldier
was so devout towards God, so upright and courteous towards men! For at
that time the Italians, when as they were carried into the provinces to
live in warfare, ran to and fro like hungry wolves to get some prey;
they had for the most part no more religion than beasts; they had as
great care of innocency as cutthroats; for which cause the virtues of
Cornelius deserve the greater commendation, in that leading a soldier’s
life, which was at that time most corrupt, he served God holily, and
lived amongst men without doing any hurt or injury. And this is no small
amplification of his praise, in that casting away superstition wherein
he was born and brought up, he embraced the pure worship of God; for we
know what account the Italians made of themselves, and how proudly they
despised others. And the Jews were at that time in such contempt, that
for their sakes pure religion was counted infamous, and almost
execrable. Seeing that none of these things could hinder Cornelius, but
that forsaking his idols he did embrace the true worship of the true God
alone, it must needs be that he was endued with rare and singular
sincerity. Moreover, he could find scarce any thing amongst the Jews
wherewith he could be allured unto the study of godliness, because there
was then scarce one amongst a thousand which had even some small
smattering of the law; and, undoubtedly, Cornelius had lighted upon some
good worshipper of God, who being sound from corrupt opinions, did
expound unto him the law faithfully, without mixing any leaven
therewith; but because Luke giveth him many titles of commendation, we
must note them all \[singly.\]

<span id="xvii.i-p9"></span><span id="xvii.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p10"></span>**2.** He saith that he was a godly man,
and one that feared God; secondly, that like a good householder he had a
care to instruct his families; he praiseth him afterward for the offices
of love, because he was beneficial \[beneficent\] toward all the people;
and, lastly, that he prayed \[to\] God continually. The sum is this,
that Cornelius was a man of singular virtues, wherein the integrity of
the godly consisteth, so that his life was framed, in all points,
according to the rule which God prescribeth unto us. And because the law
is contained in two tables, Luke commendeth, in the former place,
Cornelius’ godliness; secondly, he descendeth unto the second part, that
he exercised the offices of love toward men. This is very profitable to
be marked, because we have a way to live well described in his person.

<span id="xvii.i-p11"></span>Wherefore, in ordering the life well, let
faith and religion be the foundation, which being taken away, all other
virtues are nothing else but smokes. Luke reckoneth up the fear of God
and prayer as fruits and testimonies of godliness and of the worship of
God, and that for good causes. For religion cannot be separated from the
fear of God and the reverence of him, neither can any man be counted
godly, save he who acknowledging God to be his Father and Lord, doth
addict himself wholly to him. And let us know that voluntary fear is
commended in this place when those men submit themselves to God
willingly and from their heart, who duly consider themselves what is due
to him.

<span id="xvii.i-p12"></span>Moreover, because a great part of the world
doth, with reigned trifles, corrupt and deprave the worship of God, Luke
added, for good causes, that Cornelius prayed continually; whereby he
doth signify, that he proved not his godliness only with external
ceremonies, but that he worshipped God spiritually, when as he exercised
himself in prayer. We must also note the continuance of his prayer;
whence we gather, that he did not pray only coldly, after the common
custom, but that he was earnestly bent to prayer, as the continual
benefits of God do exhort us and prick us forward thereunto, and the
force of faith ought there to show itself. Wherefore let every one of us
exhort himself to persevere in prayer by the example of Cornelius.

<span id="xvii.i-p13"></span>*With all his house.* We must not lightly
pass over this commendation that Cornelius had a church in his house.
And, surely, a true worshipper of God will not suffer so much as in him
lieth God to be banished from his house. For how unmeet a thing is it
for him to maintain his own right stoutly, that his wife, children,
servants, and maids may obey him, and not to regard that God is
disobeyed. It shall sometimes fall out so that a godly man cannot have
even his wife to be of his mind; yet he, which ruleth others, must
endeavor by all means to have God obeyed; and there is nothing more meet
than that we should consecrate all ours to God as ourselves. Therefore,
if a godly man have children which are unlike him, or a wife of evil
conditions, or lewd and wicked servants, let him not wink, nor yet
suffer his house to be polluted through his slothfulness. The diligence
of Cornelius is not so much commended as the blessing of God, whereby it
came to pass that he had his house obedient unto him in godliness. And
we must not omit the circumstance, that he instructed his family in the
fear of God, setting light by the fear of danger, which did hang over
his head therefore. For the Jewish religion was in great contempt;
 <span id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) and no citizen of Rome might
freely  <span id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) receive any strange
religion, as they called it. Wherefore, although the sincere profession
of the gospel be evil spoken of in the world, yet is it too corrupt
frightfulness  <span id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md) if that unjust
hatred hinder any man from offering his family to God for a sacrifice,
by godly instruction.

<span id="xvii.i-p17"></span>*Giving alms.* There is also the figure
*synecdoche* in this member, \[clause.\] For as it was said, even now,
that the worship of God was proved by prayers, so now, when Luke
speaketh of love, he maketh choice of one kind; whereby he showeth that
Cornelius was a liberal and bountiful man. For our godliness ought so to
appear to men, that we declare that we fear God by using bountifulness
and justice. The word *alms* is translated unto those external good
works wherewith we help the poor, (<span id="xvii.i-p17.1"></span>[Isa
58:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#007)<span id="xvii.i-p17.1"></span>,.md)
forasmuch as *misericordia,* or mercy, is the inward affection of the
heart properly. For from this fountain springeth true and well ordered
bountifulness, if the troubles and sorrows of our brethren do move us to
compassion; if, considering the unity which is amongst us, we foster and
cherish them as we would cherish our own flesh, and study to help them
as we would help our own members. Hypocrites are, indeed, sometimes
liberal, or at least bountiful; but howsoever they waste all,  <span
id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) yet no relief which they shall bestow
upon the poor shall be worthy to be called by the name of alms. For we
must hold that of Paul, He which hath no love is nothing, though he give
all his goods to the poor, (<span id="xvii.i-p18.2"></span>[1Co
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#003)<span id="xvii.i-p18.2"></span>..md)
Let us, therefore, learn by this word, that God doth then allow our
liberality, if we relieve the poverty of the poor, being moved with
compassion, and if, as it were, with open bowels we bestow that which
the liberality of God doth give.

<span id="xvii.i-p19"></span>Whereas Luke saith that he gave alms to
*all* the people, it signifieth as much as everywhere to the poor; for
there were not a few rich men to whom to have given had been an absurd
thing. But whereas he bestowed so liberally upon the Jews, he declared
how he agreed with them in religion; in which respect Luke saith,
shortly after, that he was allowed of  <span
id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md) all the Jews. And if so be it he was
such an excellent mirror of godliness and holiness, even when he had but
a small smattering of faith, although he were letted so many ways,
 <span id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) ought not we to be ashamed who
will be accounted most Christian doctors, and are yet so cold in the
exercises of godliness? If a small sparkle of faith prevailed so much in
him, what ought the full brightness of knowledge to work in us? But
howsoever we boast of Christ with full mouth, yet how far are we, for
the most part, from the example of the holy man, so that there appeareth
scarce a small shadow of those virtues wherewith he was replete? For how
loose  <span id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) are we in prayer? How
slow and sluggish to do the duties of mercy? Yea, many are not only
letted with filthiness and covetousness from giving liberally so much of
their own as they ought, but they are so inflamed with a desire  <span
id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) to have, they are become so beastly
through cruelty,  <span id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) that they are
not afraid to rob the poor of their substance, and to eat their very
flesh.

<span id="xvii.i-p25"></span><span id="xvii.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p26"></span>**3.** *He saw in a vision.* Luke putteth
vision for a kind of oracle coming from God, that we may know that
Cornelius was brought unto the faith of Christ after an heavenly manner.
And because men are oftentimes deceived with juggling, Luke setteth down
the time to avoid all suspicion, when he mentioneth the *ninth hour.*
And at that time they were wont to divide the day into twelve hours;
from the rising of the sun until the going down thereof. Whereupon it
followeth that it was fair daylight when the angel appeared, that the
vision might be more evident. Although there were always seals added
unto visions, that they might free the servants of God from fear of
illusions, because when he appeared in dreams, yet were there such marks
of certainty imparted in their minds as would not suffer them to doubt.

<span id="xvii.i-p27"></span><span id="xvii.i-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p28"></span>**4.** *And he beheld, and was afraid.*
Luke expresseth his attentiveness in plain words, that we may know that
it was no vain imagination which came upon the man as he was sleeping or
doing some other thing. The fear wherewith he was taken  <span
id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md) proceeded from the perceiving of the
majesty of God;  <span id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) for so soon as
men conceive the presence of God, they must needs be afraid and cast
down with fear. And whereas his words do no whit terrify us, that must
be imputed to our sluggishness, because we do not know nor perceive that
it is God which speaketh. But the godly, to whom God revealeth himself
in his word, do tremble when they hear it, as Isaiah saith, (<span
id="xvii.i-p30.2"></span>[Isa. 66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#005)<span id="xvii.i-p30.2"></span>..md)
Furthermore, the sight of God is unto them terrible, not that they may
always lie confounded, and be swallowed up of fear, but only that they
may humbly address themselves to reverence him.

<span id="xvii.i-p31"></span>*What is it, Lord?* It appeareth plainly by
this answer, that Cornelius’ mind was touched with religion; that he
knew that he had to deal with God. Therefore the common translation hath
it evil,  <span id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) Who art thou, Lord?
And it is likely that that which is there read was put in instead of
this, forasmuch as in the Greek text there is no doubtfulness, whereby
the interpreter might be deceived, and all the copies agree together in
this reading, <span id="xvii.i-p32.2"></span>τι εστι. And assuredly,
when Cornelius perceived that it is God, he submitteth himself to obey;
as the answer is nothing but a commandment.

<span id="xvii.i-p33"></span>*Thy prayers and alms.* Because God seemeth
to be after a sort deaf, unless he answer our petitions by and by, hence
cometh that speech, that our prayers come unto him, and that he is
mindful thereof. Furthermore, the angel assigneth this as the cause why
God vouchsafeth to show to Cornelius the light of his gospel; because he
hath heard his prayers and accepted his alms. Whence we gather that
virtues and good works do not only please God, but that they are also
adorned with this excellent reward, that he heapeth upon us and
enricheth us with greater gifts for their sakes; according to that, “To
him that hath shall be given,” (<span id="xvii.i-p33.1"></span>[Mt
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#012)<span id="xvii.i-p33.1"></span>..md)
And again,

<span id="xvii.i-p34"></span>“Well done, good and faithful servant; thou
hast been faithful in a few things, I will set thee over many things,”  
(<span id="xvii.i-p34.2"></span>[Mt
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#021)<span id="xvii.i-p34.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xvii.i-p35"></span>For God doth after this sort extol his by a
continual course of his gifts, as it were by certain steps, until he
bring them to the top.

<span id="xvii.i-p36"></span>But the Papists abuse this place two ways;
for because God respected the prayers and alms of Cornelius, so that he
endued him with the faith of the gospel, they wrest that unto the
preparations which they have invented, as if a man did get faith by his
own industry and power, and did prevent  <span
id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) the grace of God by the merits of
works. Secondly, they gather, generally, that good works are meritorious
in such sort, that the graces of God are increased in every man as he
hath deserved. In the former they are too childishly deceived, whilst
that they feign that the works of Cornelius were acceptable to God
before he was illuminate by faith. And we need not to fet \[seek\] a
proof far to refute their ignorance; for he could obtain nothing by
prayer unless faith went before, which only openeth the gate for us to
pray; and Augustine weigheth that well and wisely, who derideth
Pelagius, because he said that faith was obtained by prayers before it
was in man in any measure: Who (saith he) will seek a physician save he
who is already healed in some part? And it is the health of faith which
teacheth us to knock. Furthermore, the fear of God and godliness do
plainly prove that he was regenerate by the Spirit. For Ezekiel giveth
 <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) this praise to God alone, that
he frameth the hearts of men to fear him, (<span
id="xvii.i-p38.2"></span>[Ezekiel
32:40](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#040.md)<span id="xvii.i-p38.2"></span>
\[*sic*\].) And Isaiah saith, that the Spirit of the fear of God resteth
in Christ, (<span id="xvii.i-p38.3"></span>[Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002)<span id="xvii.i-p38.3"></span>,.md)
that we may know that he can be found no where save only in his members.
Therefore it is too great folly to feign a man in the person of
Cornelius, who, having nature for his guide, can attain unto eternal
life, or endeavor to come thither. Therefore they reason blockishly,
that we are able to prevent the grace of God with the merits of works.

<span id="xvii.i-p39"></span>As touching the second error, when as they
imagine that every one of us is increased with greater graces as he hath
deserved, it may easily be refuted. First, we deny that we have any good
works which God hath not freely given us; secondly, we say that the
right use of gifts cometh from him also and that this is his second
grace, that we use his former gifts well. Thirdly, we deny that we
deserve any thing by our works,  <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md)
which are always lame and corrupt. Good works do indeed purchase for us
the increase of grace, but not by their own desert. For they cannot be
acceptable to God without pardon, which they obtain by the benefit of
faith. Wherefore it is faith alone which maketh them acceptable.  <span
id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) Thus did Cornelius obtain more perfect
knowledge of Christ by his prayers and alms, but in that he had God to
be favorable and merciful to his prayers and alms, that did depend upon
faith.

<span id="xvii.i-p42"></span>Furthermore, if good works be esteemed
\[estimated\] by faith, it is of mercy, and not of merit, that God doth
allow \[approve\] them. For because faith findeth no worthy thing in us
whereby we can please God, it borroweth that of Christ which we want.
And this is too perverse, that though the Papists have this word merit
every now and then in their mouths, and cease not to puff up fools with
a vain confidence, yet they bring nothing whereby the studies of men may
be moved to do well. For they leave their consciences always in a doubt,
and command men to doubt whether their words please God or not. Must not
men’s minds need faint when they are possessed with such fear? But as
for us, though we take merit from works, yet when as we teach that there
is a reward laid up for them, we prick men forward with an excellent and
sharp prick, to desire to live well. For we address ourselves then
joyfully to serve God, when we are persuaded that we lose not our labor.
And whereas there appeareth at this day no more plentiful abundance of
the gifts of the Spirit, but that the more part doth rather wither away,
we must thank our unthankfulhess for that. For as God did crown
Cornelius’ prayers and alms, and holiness, with the most precious pearl
of his gospel, so there is just cause why he should suffer us to starve,
being brought unto hungry poverty, when as he seeth us abuse the
treasure of his gospel wickedly and ungodlily.

<span id="xvii.i-p43"></span>Yet here may a question be asked, Whether
faith require the knowledge of Christ, or it be content with the simple
persuasion of the mercy of God? for Cornelius seemeth to have known
nothing at all concerning Christ. But it may be proved by sound proofs
that faith cannot be separated from Christ; for if we lay hold upon the
bare majesty of God, we are rather confounded with his glory, than that
we feel any taste of his goodness. Therefore, Christ must come between,
that the mind of man may conceive that God is merciful. And it is not
without cause that he is called the image of the invisible God, (<span
id="xvii.i-p43.1"></span>[Col
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015)<span id="xvii.i-p43.1"></span>;.md)
because the Father offereth himself to be holden in his face alone.
Moreover, seeing that he is the way, the truth, and the life, (<span
id="xvii.i-p43.2"></span>[Joh
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006)<span id="xvii.i-p43.2"></span>;.md)
whithersoever thou goest without him, thou shalt be enwrapped on every
side in errors, and death shall meet you \[thee\] on every side. We may
easily answer concerning Cornelius. All spiritual gifts are offered unto
us in Christ; and especially whence cometh regeneration, save only
because we are ingrafted into the death of Christ, our old man is
crucified? (Romans, 6:5, 6.) And if Cornelius were made partaker of the
Spirit of Christ, there is no cause why we should think that he was
altogether void of his faith; neither had he so embraced the worship of
the true God, (whom the Jews alone did worship,) but that he had also
heard  <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) somewhat of the promised
Mediator; though the knowledge of him were obscure and entangled, yet
was it some. Whosoever came at that time into Judea he was enforced to
hear somewhat of the Messiah, yea, there was some fame of him spread
through countries which were far off.  <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) Wherefore, Cornelius must be put in
the catalogue of the old fathers, who hoped for salvation of the
Redeemer before he was revealed. And it is properly  <span
id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md) \[improperly\] said of Augustine, that
Peter grounded his faith; whereas it had now before a firm foundation;
although Augustine thinketh as we do in the thing itself, who affirmeth
plainly, that Cornelius could not pray unless he had faith, in his Book
of the Predestination of Saints, and other places.

<span id="xvii.i-p47"></span><span id="xvii.i-p47.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p48"></span>**5.** *Now send to Joppa.* God dealt most
favorably with Cornelius, in that he doth not command him to go himself,
but to send messengers unto Peter, that he may stay quietly at home, and
that Peter may endure the toil of the journey for his sake. But let us
not wonder that Cornelius was so courteously handled, seeing that God
thrusteth the ministers of his word daily upon the unwilling; so that he
appeareth of his accord to those which do not seek him, as he saith by
Isaiah, (<span id="xvii.i-p48.1"></span>[Isa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001)<span id="xvii.i-p48.1"></span>..md)
But why doth not the angel rather teach him?  <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) For this seemeth an inconvenient
 <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) thing that he resigneth his
office to a mortal man; for the oracle should have had greater authority
than when the gospel is preached to him by a mortal man. As when Christ
appeared to Paul by a vision, he set, notwithstanding, Ananias to teach
him, that he might by such an example establish the ministry of the
preaching of the gospel, which he committed to his Church; so now the
angel giveth place to Peter, that he may execute the office committed
unto him by Christ. Therefore, whosoever will be the disciple of Christ,
and be illuminated by the (heavenly) light of the heavenly wisdom, let
him not grudge to use attentiveness and docility toward the external
voice of men, which Christ useth as an instrument, and whereunto he will
have our faith annexed. And we see how sore God hath punished their
furious pride, who, contemning preaching, have looked for  <span
id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md) revelations from heaven. For since God
will be heard in men, the ministers to whom he hath given his word
 <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) cannot be contemned without
contempt and reproach of him. Nevertheless, I confess that the spirits
must be proved, (<span id="xvii.i-p52.2"></span>[1Jo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)<span id="xvii.i-p52.2"></span>,.md)
that we hear not without choice whosoever do pretend that they are
ministers of Christ. But because faith cometh by hearing, (<span
id="xvii.i-p52.3"></span>[Ro
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017)<span id="xvii.i-p52.3"></span>,.md)
no man shall attain thereunto which shall refuse and despise the word
when it is preached,
