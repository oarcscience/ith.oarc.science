9:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017)<span id="xvi.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p2"></span>**17.** And Ananias went and entered into the
house, and when he had laid his hands upon him, he said, Brother Saul,
the Lord hath sent me, namely Jesus, who appeared to thee in the way as
thou camest, that thou mayest recover thy sight, and that thou mayest be
filled with the Holy Ghost. **18.** And forthwith there fell from his
eyes as it had been scales: and he recovered his sight by and by; and
arising he was baptized. **19.** And when he had taken meat he was
strengthened.

<span id="xvi.v-p4"></span><span id="xvi.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p5"></span>**17.** *Having laid his hands upon.* We have
said elsewhere that this was a solemn, and, as it were, an ordinary
thing amongst the Jews, to lay their hands upon those whom they did
commend to God. The apostles translated that custom taken from
sacrifices to their use, either when they gave the visible graces of the
Spirit or when they made any man minister of the Church. To this end
doth Ananias lay his hands now upon Paul, partly that he may consecrate
him unto God, partly that he may obtain for him the gifts of the Spirit.
And though there be no mention made of doctrine in this place yet it
shall appear afterwards by Paul’s narration, that Ananias was also
commanded to teach him; and by baptism, which was later in order, we
gather that he was instructed in the faith. Let the readers note out of
the chapter next going before how this ceremony is effectual to give the
Spirit, But seeing Paul received the Spirit by the hand of Ananias, the
Papists are more than ridiculous, who will have the bishops alone to lay
on their hands.

<span id="xvi.v-p6"></span><span id="xvi.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p7"></span>**18.** *There fell from his eyes as it had
been scales.* The blindness of Paul, as we have said before did not
proceed from fear alone or from amazedness; but by this means was he
admonished of his former blindness, that he might quite abandon that
boldness and vain confidence wherewith he was puffed up. He boasted that
he was taught at the feet of Gamaliel, (<span id="xvi.v-p7.1"></span>[Ac
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#003)<span id="xvi.v-p7.1"></span>;)
and undoubtedly he thought very well of his great wittiness,  <span
id="fr_595"></span>[596](#fn_595) which was notwithstanding mere
blindness. Therefore he is deprived of the sight of his body  <span
id="fr_596"></span>[597](#fn_596) three days, that he may begin to see
with his mind; for those must become fools, whosoever they be, which
seem to themselves wise, that they may attain to true wisdom. For seeing
that Christ is the Sun of righteousness, in seeing without him we see
not; it is he also which openeth the eyes of the mind. Both things were
showed to Paul, and to us are they showed in his person; for he hath his
eyes covered with scales, that, condemning all his knowledge of
ignorance,  <span id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597) he may learn that he
hath need of new light, which he hath hitherto wanted; and he is taught
that he must let \[seek\] the true light from none other save only from
Christ, and that it is given by no other means save only through his
goodness. Furthermore, whereas being pined with three days hunger, he
maketh no haste to receive meat until he be baptized, thereby appeareth
the earnest  <span id="fr_598"></span>[599](#fn_598) desire he had to
learn, because he refreshed not his body with meat until his soul had
received strength.
