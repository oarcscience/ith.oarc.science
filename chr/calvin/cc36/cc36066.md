<span id="xv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 8

<span id="xv-p2"></span>In this history we may first see the state of
the godly in this world, to wit, that they are like sheep appointed to
be slain, as it is in the Psalm, (<span id="xv-p2.1"></span>[Ps
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022)<span id="xv-p2.1"></span>;) and
especially when the Lord letteth loose the bridle to his enemies, that
they may put that cruelty in execution which they have in mind
conceived. Secondly, here is set down the end of persecutions, to wit,
that they are so far from breaking off the course of the gospel, that
they are rather made helps to further the same through the wonderful
counsel of God. Like as it was a manifest miracle, that the scattering
abroad, mentioned by Luke, gathered many unto the unity of faith who
were estranged from God before. Now, let us consider every thing in
order.
