<span id="ix.vii-p1"></span><span id="ix.vii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
2:37-39](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037.md)<span id="ix.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p2"></span>**37.** And when they heard these things,
they were pricked in heart, and said unto Peter and to the other
apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? **38.** Peter said unto
them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the
Holy Spirit. **39.** For the promise appertaineth unto you, and unto
your child-ten, and unto all which are far off, whomsoever the Lord our
God shall call.

<span id="ix.vii-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.vii-p4"></span><span id="ix.vii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p5"></span>**37.** *They were pricked in heart.* Luke
doth now declare the fruit of the sermon, to the end we may know that
the power of the Holy Ghost was not only showed forth in the diversity
of tongues, but also in their hearts which heard. And he noteth a double
fruit; first, that they were touched with the feeling of sorrow; and,
secondly, that they were obedient to Peter’s counsel. This is the
beginning of repentance, this is the entrance unto godliness, to be
sorry for our sins, and to be wounded with the feeling of our miseries.
For so long as men are careless, they cannot take such heed unto
doctrine as they ought. And for this cause the word of God is compared
to a sword, (<span id="ix.vii-p5.1"></span>[Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012)<span id="ix.vii-p5.1"></span>,.md)
because it doth mortify our flesh, that we may be offered to God for a
sacrifice. But there must be added unto this pricking in heart readiness
to obey. Cain and Judas were pricked in heart, but despair did keep them
back from submitting themselves unto God, (<span
id="ix.vii-p5.2"></span>[Ge 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#013.md)<span
id="ix.vii-p5.2"></span>; <span id="ix.vii-p5.3"></span>[Mt
27:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#003)<span id="ix.vii-p5.3"></span>..md)
For the mind being oppressed with horror, can do nothing else but flee
from God. And surely when David affirmeth that a contrite spirit and an
humble heart is a sacrifice acceptable to God, he speaketh of voluntary
pricking; forasmuch as there is fretting and fuming mixed with the
prickings of the wicked. Therefore, we must take a good heart to us, and
lift up our mind with this hope of salvation, that we may be ready to
addict and give over ourselves unto God, and to follow whatsoever he
shall command. We see many oftentimes pricked, who, notwithstanding, do
fret and murmur, or else forwardly strive and struggle, and so,
consequently, go furiously mad. Yea, this is the cause why they go mad,
because they feel such prickings against their will. Those men,
therefore, are profitably pricked alone who are willingly sorrowful, and
do also seek some remedy at God’s hands.

<span id="ix.vii-p6"></span><span id="ix.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p7"></span>**38.** *Peter said* Hereby we see that
those do never go away empty which ask at the mouth of the Lord, and do
offer themselves unto him to be ruled and taught; for that promise must
needs be true, Knock, and it shall be opened unto you, (<span
id="ix.vii-p7.1"></span>[Mt 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md)<span
id="ix.vii-p7.1"></span>.) Therefore, whosoever shall be rightly
prepared to learn, the Lord will not suffer his godly desire to be in
vain; for he is a most faithful master, so that he hath scholars which
are apt to be taught and studious. Wherefore, there is no cause why he
should fear, lest he suffer us to be destitute of sound counsel, if we
be attentive and ready to hear him, and do not refuse to embrace
whatsoever he shall teach us. And let us suffer ourselves to be governed
by the counsel and authority of those men whom he offereth unto us to
teach us, for this ready obedience cometh thence so suddenly in those
which addict themselves unto the apostles, because they are persuaded
that they are sent of God, to show them the way of salvation.

<span id="ix.vii-p8"></span>*Repent.* There is greater force in the
Greek word, for it doth signify the conversion of the mind, that the
whole man may be renewed and made another man, which thing must be
diligently noted, because this doctrine was miserably corrupted in the
time of Popery; for they translated the name of repentance almost unto
certain external rites. They babble somewhat, indeed, about the reigned
contrition of the heart; but they touch that part very slightly, and
they stand principally upon the external *exercises* of the body, which
were little worth; yea, though there were in them no corruption; but
they urge nothing else in a manner but reigned trifles, wherewith men
are wearied in vain. Wherefore, let us know that this is the true
repentance, when a man is renewed in the spirit of his mind, as Paul
teacheth, (<span id="ix.vii-p8.1"></span>[Ro
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#002)<span id="ix.vii-p8.1"></span>..md)
Neither need we to doubt of this; but that Peter did preach plainly of
the force and nature of repentance; but Luke doth only touch the chief
points, and doth not reckon up the words of the oration which he made.
We must, therefore, know thus much, that Peter did at the first exhort
the Jews unto repentance; and that done, he lifted them up with hope of
pardon; for he promised them forgiveness of sins, which two things are
the two parts of the gospel, as we know full well; and, therefore, when
Christ will briefly teach what the doctrine of the gospel doth contain,
he saith, that repentance and remission of sins (<span
id="ix.vii-p8.2"></span>[Lu 24:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#047.md)<span
id="ix.vii-p8.2"></span>) must be preached in his name. Furthermore,
because we are reconciled unto God only by the intercession of Christ’s
death, neither are our sins otherwise purged,  <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) and done away, save only by his blood,
therefore, Peter calleth us back unto him by name. He putteth baptism in
the fourth place, as the seal whereby the promise of grace is confirmed.

<span id="ix.vii-p10"></span>Wherefore, we have in these few words
almost the whole sum of Christianity, namely, how a man renouncing
himself and taking his farewell of the world, may addict himself wholly
to God; secondly, How he may be delivered by free forgiveness of sins,
and so adopted into the number of the children of God. And forasmuch as
we can obtain none of all these things without Christ, the name of
Christ is therewithal set forth unto us, as the only foundation of faith
and repentance. And we must also note this, that we do so begin
repentance when we are turned unto God, that we must prosecute the same
during our life; therefore, this sermon must continually sound in the
Church, *repent,* (<span id="ix.vii-p10.1"></span>[Mr
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#015)<span id="ix.vii-p10.1"></span>;.md)
not that those men may begin the same, who will be counted faithful, and
have a place already in the Church; but that they may go forward in the
same; although many do usurp the name of faithful men, which had never
any beginning of repentance. Wherefore, we must observe this order in
teaching, that those which do yet live unto the world and the flesh may
begin to crucify the old man, that they may rise unto newness of life,
and that those who are already entered the course of repentance may
continually go forward towards the mark. Furthermore, because the inward
conversion of the heart ought to bring forth fruits in the life,
repentance cannot be rightly taught unless works be required, not those
frivolous works which are only in estimation amongst the Papists, but
such as are sound testimonies of innocence and holiness.

<span id="ix.vii-p11"></span>*Be baptized every one of you.* Although in
the text and order of the words, baptism doth here go before remission
of sins, yet doth it follow it in order, because it is nothing else but
a sealing of those good things which we have by Christ that they may be
established in our consciences; therefore, after that Peter had
intreated of repentance, he calleth the Jews unto the hope of grace and
salvation; and, therefore, Luke well afterwards, in Paul’s sermon,
joineth faith and repentance together in the same sense, wherein he
putteth forgiveness of sins in this place, and that for good
considerations; for the hope of salvation consisteth in the free
imputation of righteousness; and we are counted just, freely before God,
when he forgiveth us our sins. And as I said before, that the doctrine
of repentance hath a daily use in the Church so must we think of the
forgiveness of sins, that the same is continually offered unto us; and
surely it is no less necessary for us during the whole course of our
life, than at our first entrance into the Church, so that it should
profit us nothing to be once received into favor by God, unless this
embassage should have a continual course; be-reconciled unto God,
because

<span id="ix.vii-p12"></span>“he which knew no sin was made sin for us,
that we might be the righteousness of God in him,”  
(<span id="ix.vii-p12.2"></span>[2Co
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020)<span id="ix.vii-p12.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.vii-p13"></span>Moreover, the Papists do so corrupt this
other part of the gospel, that they quite exclude the remission of sins,
which was to be obtained by Christ. They confess their sins are freely
forgiven in baptism, but they will have them redeemed with satisfactions
after baptism; and although they mix the grace of Christ together
therewithal, yet because they inwrap the same in men’s merits, they do
by this means overthrow the whole doctrine of the gospel; for, first,
they take from men’s consciences the certainty of faith; that done,
forasmuch as they part the forgiveness of sins between the death of
Christ and our satisfactions, they do altogether deprive us of Christ’s
benefit. For Christ doth not reconcile us unto God in part, but wholly,
neither can we obtain remission of sins by him, unless it be whole and
perfect. But the Papists are much deceived therein, who restrain baptism
unto the nativity and former life, as if the signification and force
thereof did not reach even unto death.

<span id="ix.vii-p14"></span>Let us know, therefore, that forgiveness of
sins is grounded in Christ alone, and that we must not think upon any
other satisfaction  <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) save only
that which he hath performed by the sacrifice of his death. And for this
cause, as we have already said, doth Peter express his name, whereby he
doth signify unto us, that none of all these things can be rightly
taught, unless Christ be set in the midst, to the end the effect of this
doctrine may be sought in him. That needeth no long exposition where he
commandeth them to be baptized for the remission of sins; for although
God hath once reconciled men unto himself in Christ” by not imputing
unto them their sins,” (<span id="ix.vii-p15.2"></span>[2Co
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)<span id="ix.vii-p15.2"></span>,.md)
and doth now imprint in our hearts the faith thereof by his Spirit; yet,
notwithstanding, because baptism is the seal whereby he doth confirm
unto us this benefit, and so, consequently, the earnest and pledge of
our adoption, it is worthily said to be given us for the remission of
sins. For because we receive Christ’s gifts by faith, and baptism is a
help to confirm and increase our faith, remission of sins, which is an
effect of faith, is annexed unto it as unto the inferior mean.
Furthermore, we must not fetch the definition of baptism from this
place, because Peter doth only touch a part thereof. Our old man is
crucified by baptism, as Paul teacheth, that we may rise unto newness of
life, (<span id="ix.vii-p15.3"></span>[Rom.
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006)<span id="ix.vii-p15.3"></span>..md)
And, again, we put on Christ himself, (<span
id="ix.vii-p15.4"></span>[1Co 12](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#000.md)<span
id="ix.vii-p15.4"></span>.) and the Scripture teacheth every where, that
it is also a sign and token of repentance, (<span
id="ix.vii-p15.5"></span>[Ga 3:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#027.md)<span
id="ix.vii-p15.5"></span>.) But because Peter doth not intreat in thin
place openly of the whole nature of baptism, but speaking of the
forgiveness of sins, doth, by the way, declare that the confirmation
thereof is in baptism, there doth no inconvenience follow, if ye do omit
the other part.  <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md)

<span id="ix.vii-p17"></span>*In the name of Christ.* Although baptism
be no vain figure, but a true and effectual testimony; notwithstanding,
lest any man attribute that unto the element of water which is there
offered, the name of Christ is plainly expressed, to the end we may know
that it shall be a profitable sign for us then, if we seek the force and
effect thereof in Christ, and know that we are, therefore, washed in
baptism, because the blood of Christ is our washing; and we do also
hereby gather, that Christ is, the mark and end whereunto baptism
directeth us; wherefore, every one profiteth so much in baptism as he
learneth to look unto Christ. But here ariseth a question, Whether it
were lawful for Peter to change the form prescribed by Christ? The
Papists do think, at least feign so, and thence do they take a color of
liberty to change or abrogate the institutions of Christ. They confess
that nothing ought to be changed, as touching the substance, but they
will have the Church to have liberty to change whatsoever it will in the
form. But this argument may easily be answered. For we must first know
that Christ did not indite and rehearse unto his apostles magical words
for enchanting, as the Papists do dream, but he did, in few words,
comprehend the sum of the mystery. Again, I deny that Peter doth speak
in this place of the form of baptism; but he doth simply declare that
the whole strength  <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) of baptism
is contained in Christ; although Christ cannot be laid hold on by faith
without the Father by whom he was given us, and the Spirit by the which
he reneweth and sanctifieth us. The answer consisteth wholly in this,
that he intreateth not in this place of the certain form of baptizing,
but the faithful are called back unto Christ, in whom alone we have
whatsoever baptism doth prefigure unto us; for we are both made clean by
his blood, and also we enter into a new life by the benefit of his death
and resurrection.

<span id="ix.vii-p19"></span>*Ye shall receive the gift of the Spirit.*
Because they were touched with wondering when they saw the apostles
suddenly begin to speak with strange tongues, Peter saith that they
shall be partakers of the same gift if they will pass over unto Christ.
Remission of sins and newness of life were the principal things, and
this was, as it were, an addition, that Christ should show forth unto
them his power by some visible gift. Neither ought this place to be
understood of the grace of sanctification, which is given generally to
all the godly. Therefore he promiseth them the gift of the Spirit,
whereof they saw a pattern in the diversity of tongues. Therefore this
doth not properly appertain unto us. For because Christ meant to set
forth the beginning of his kingdom with those miracles, they lasted but
for a time; yet because the visible graces which the Lord did distribute
to his did shoe, as it were in a glass, that Christ was the giver of the
Spirit, therefore, that which Peter saith doth in some respect appertain
unto all the whole Church: ye shall receive the gift of the Spirit. For
although we do not receive it, that we may speak with tongues, that we
may be prophets, that we may cure the sick, that we may work miracles;
yet is it given us for a better use, that we may believe with the heart
unto righteousness, that our tongues may be framed unto true confession,
(<span id="ix.vii-p19.1"></span>[Ro
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010)<span id="ix.vii-p19.1"></span>,.md)
that we may pass from death to life, (<span
id="ix.vii-p19.2"></span>[Joh
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024)<span id="ix.vii-p19.2"></span>.md)
that we, which are poor and empty, may be made rich, that we may
withstand Satan and the world stoutly. Therefore, the grace of the
Spirit shall always be annexed unto baptism, unless the let be in
ourselves.

<span id="ix.vii-p20"></span><span id="ix.vii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p21"></span>**39.** *For the promise appertaineth unto
you.* It was requisite that this should be expressly added, that the
Jews might certainly think and persuade themselves that the grace of
Christ did belong as well to them as to the apostles. And Peter proveth
it thus, because the promise of God was made unto them. For we must
always look unto this, because \[that\] we cannot otherwise know the
will of God save only by his word. But it is not sufficient to have the
general word, unless we know that the same is appointed for us.
Therefore Peter saith, that those benefits which they see in him and his
fellows in office were in times past promised to the Jews; because this
is required necessarily for the certainty of faith, that every one be
fully persuaded of this, that he is comprehended in the number of those
unto whom God speaketh. Finally, this is the rule of a true faith, when
I am thus persuaded that salvation is mine, because that promise
appertaineth unto me which offereth the same. And hereby we have also a
greater confirmation, when as the promise is extended unto those who
were before afar off. For God had made the covenant with the Jews,
(<span id="ix.vii-p21.1"></span>[Ex
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#022)<span id="ix.vii-p21.1"></span>..md)
If the force and fruit thereof come also unto the Gentiles, there is no
cause why the Jews should doubt of themselves, but that they shall find
the promise of God firm and stable.

<span id="ix.vii-p22"></span>And we must note these three degrees, that
the promise was first made to the Jews, and then to their children, and
last of all, that it is also to be imparted to the Gentiles. We know the
reason why the Jews are preferred before other people; for they are, as
it were, the first begotten in God’s family, yea, they were then
separated from other people by a singular privilege. Therefore Peter
observeth a good order, when he giveth the Jews the pre-eminence.
Whereas he adjoineth their children unto them, it dependeth upon the
words of the promise: I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed after
thee, (<span id="ix.vii-p22.1"></span>[Ge
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007)<span id="ix.vii-p22.1"></span>,.md)
where God doth reckon the children with the fathers in the grace of
adoption.

<span id="ix.vii-p23"></span>This place, therefore, doth abundantly
refute the manifest error of the Anabaptists, which will not have
infants, which are the children of the faithful, to be baptized, as if
they were not members of the Church. They espy a starting hole in the
allegorical sense,  <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) and they
expound it thus, that by children are meant those which are spiritually
begotten. But this gross impudency doth nothing help them. It is plain
and evident that Peter spoke thus because God did adopt one nation
peculiarly. And circumcision did declare that the right of adoption was
common even unto infants. Therefore, even as God made his covenant with
Isaac, being as yet unborn, because he was the seed of Abraham, so Peter
teacheth, that all the children of the Jews are contained in the same
covenant, because this promise is always in force, I will be the God of
your seed.

<span id="ix.vii-p25"></span>*And to those which are afar off.* The
Gentiles are named in the last place, which were before strangers. For
those which refer it unto those Jews which were exiled afar off, (and
driven) into far countries, they are greatly deceived. For he speaketh
not in this place of the distance of place; but he noteth a difference
between the *Jews* and the Gentiles, that they were first joined to God
by reason of the covenant, and so, consequently, became of his family or
household; but the Gentiles were banished from his kingdom. Paul useth
the same speech in the second chapter to Ephesians, (<span
id="ix.vii-p25.1"></span>[Eph
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011)<span id="ix.vii-p25.1"></span>,.md)
that the Gentiles, which were strangers from the promises, are now drawn
near, through Jesus Christ, unto God. Because that Christ (the wall of
separation being taken away) hath reconciled both (the Jews and
Gentiles) unto the Father, and coming, he hath preached peace unto those
which were nigh at hand, and which were afar off. Now we understand
Peter’s meaning. For to the end he may amplify the grace of Christ, he
doth so offer the same unto the Jews, that he saith the Gentiles are
also partakers thereof. And therefore he useth this word *call,* as if
he should say: Like as God hath gathered you together into one peculiar
people heretofore by his voice, so the same voice shall sound
everywhere, that those which are afar off may come and join themselves
unto you, when as they shall be called by a new proclamation.
