<span id="xx.vi-p1"></span><span id="xx.vi-p1.1"></span>[Acts
13:27-31](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#027.md)<span id="xx.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xx.vi-p2"></span>**27.** For those which dwelt in Jerusalem,
and their rulers, seeing that they knew him not, neither the voices of
the prophets which are read every Sabbath day; when they had condemned
him, they fulfilled them. **28.** And when they found no cause of death
in him, they desired Pilate that he would crucify him. **29.** And after
that they had fulfilled all things which were written of him, when they
had taken him down from the tree, they put him in a tomb. **30.** But
God raised him up from the dead. **31.** Who appeared many days to those
which went up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses
to the people.

<span id="xx.vi-p3"></span> 

<span id="xx.vi-p4"></span><span id="xx.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xx.vi-p5"></span>**27.** He doth wisely, and in due time,
prevent an offense which might have been a great hindrance to their
faith, \[men’s faith.\] For Jerusalem was God’s sanctuary, the king’s
seat, the fountain of truth, and the light of the whole world; but
Christ was put to death there. Furthermore, nothing could seem more
absurd to look to than to receive him who was cast out of the temple of
God; and to seek the doctrine of salvation any where else than there
whence God himself had testified it should come. Moreover, by believing
in Christ, they seemed to make a departure from the Church; and,
therefore, this one objection was strong enough to refute all Paul’s
sermon, Why dost thou force upon us, under color of God’s covenant, a
man whom the principal part of the holy people condemned? This objection
doth Paul answer, lest it hinder the course of the gospel; and not that
only, but he turneth it also to the contrary part; for seeing that the
author of life was despised and rejected at Jerusalem, Paul exhorteth
the men of Antioch, at least those who among them feared God, that they
receive him so much the more joyfully; for this doth the causal word
declare, as if he should have said, Seeing that Jerusalem knew not her
good, it behoveth you to be the more awakened and inflamed, lest the
same unthankfulness and forwardness be found in you.

<span id="xx.vi-p6"></span>But he useth another reason to remove the
offense, to wit, that their ungodliness was so far from diminishing any
whit of Christ’s divine excellency, that it ought rather to serve to
prove and establish the same, for whereby doth Christ better appear than
because all that was fulfilled in him which had been foretold in the law
and prophets? (<span id="xx.vi-p6.1"></span>[Luke
24:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#025.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#026)<span id="xx.vi-p6.1"></span>..md)
Furthermore, what got the enemies of Christ, save only that in him
shined the plain truth of the Scripture? It must needs be that Christ
should be rejected of the chief, for it was so foretold,

<span id="xx.vi-p7"></span>“The stone which the builders refused hath  
God made the head of the corner,” (<span id="xx.vi-p7.2"></span>[Ps
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022)<span id="xx.vi-p7.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xx.vi-p8"></span>Christ must needs have been condemned among
the wicked, that he might acquit us before God; it was expedient that
sins should be laid upon him, that he might make satisfaction for the
same; that he should be offered upon the cross, that the shadowish
sacrifices of the law might cease; for even the Scripture contained
these things, (<span id="xx.vi-p8.1"></span>[Isa.
53:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005.md)<span id="xx.vi-p8.1"></span>; <span
id="xx.vi-p8.2"></span>[Da 9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md)<span
id="xx.vi-p8.2"></span>.)

<span id="xx.vi-p9"></span>Therefore, the more violently the captains of
the people sought to extinguish Christ, they did in very deed prove him
to be Christ, and the Lord did wonderfully deceive \[frustrate\] them,
so that their obstinate impiety doth more edify the faith of the godly
than destroy it. Of the same sort are almost all offenses which lead
away weak and inconstant souls from Christ; for if they would thoroughly
ponder the whole process of the work of God, there should be matter of
confirmation where they faint. Therefore it cometh to pass, for the most
part, that  <span id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801.md) we be troubled with
offenses and stumbling-blocks, because, whilst we behold those things
which belong to Christ with purblind eyes,  <span
id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802.md) we imagine that to be black which is
white; and we see how far Paul is from dissimulation, and how freely
 <span id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803.md) he professeth the truth of the
matter, that Christ was hated not only of the common sort, but also of
the chief chieftains; and that he was not hissed at by a few, but
oppressed by the wicked conspiracy of all the people. That was hard and
hateful at the first conflict; but Paul opposeth a more strong engine,
that God used them against their wills as a touchstone, whereby he might
try his Son. Seeing that the gospel standeth in the same state at this
day, let us not be ashamed, with Paul, to confess that the proud princes
of the world, and those who bear the greatest sway in the Church, are
the deadly enemies of Christ, seeing that doth rather turn to Christ’s
praise than reproach; for by this means is the Scripture fulfilled.

<span id="xx.vi-p13"></span>*Seeing they knew him not.* Though
deliberate malice did enforce the rulers to oppress Christ, yet doth
Paul truly impute it to ignorance,  <span
id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804.md) because otherwise they would never
have crucified the Lord of glory, (<span id="xx.vi-p14.2"></span>[1Co
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008)<span id="xx.vi-p14.2"></span>..md)
For the malice of the wicked is like to raging madness, and in seeing it
doth not see. Undoubtedly, we need not doubt of this, that they were
deprived of a sound mind and the light of the Spirit, who were not
afraid to fight against God to their own destruction. Again, he hitteth
them in the teeth with ignorance of the Scripture; and lest any should
object that he speaketh of some dark and unknown manner; he addeth also,
that he doth speak of no other prophecies than of those which are read
every Sabbath day; as if he should say, that the oracles of Scripture
are most plain and known to the most ignorant, and yet they knew them
not. Thus doth Paul teach how monstrous their unbelief was, that he may
make the hearers loathe it; and by this example are we taught, that
although the Lord appears to us by the Scripture, yet all men have not
eyes. After that also the blockishness of the nation waxed more gross,
as Paul saith elsewhere, that there is a veil put before their face,
that they cannot see Moses when he is present, (<span
id="xx.vi-p14.3"></span>[2Co 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#015.md)<span
id="xx.vi-p14.3"></span>.) In the mean season, we must note that we are
recalled to the Scripture, lest the authority of great men deceive us,
neither is there any cause why any man, inventing to himself a prejudice
according to the wicked meaning of other men, should think that he is
acquitted; for Paul exhorteth the men of Antioch to judge out of the
Scripture against the visored governors of the Church;  <span
id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805.md) for this cause is it given, that it
may be read; and reading is not appointed in vain by the Lord; but that
all godly men may thereby profit and judge what is right.

<span id="xx.vi-p16"></span>*This they fulfilled.* So that we see that
not only creatures void of understanding, but even the very devil, and
also the wicked, are subject to the power  <span
id="fr_806"></span>[807](#fn_806.md) of God, that he may execute by them
that which with himself he hath decreed. The same had we in the third
and fourth chapters, (<span id="xx.vi-p17.2"></span>[Ac
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#023.md)<span id="xx.vi-p17.2"></span>;
<span id="xx.vi-p17.3"></span>[Ac
4:28](../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#028)<span id="xx.vi-p17.3"></span>,.md)
that when the enemies of Christ did most of all rage to destroy him, yet
could they not obtain their purpose; but rather they brought that to
pass with their own hands which God had in his counsel determined; which
thing maketh not a little for commendation of God’s truth, because he is
not only of sufficient power to perform those things which he hath
promised; but also those who go about to bring his counsels to nought do
their endeavor to establish them, though it be against their will. For
how should not the truth of God stand which the chiefest enemies are
enforced to fulfill? Yet wisdom is necessary here, lest we join God and
Satan together.

<span id="xx.vi-p18"></span>For the Jews are not therefore excusable,
because they fulfilled the Scriptures; because we must consider their
wicked will, and not the event, which they did not look for, yea, which
ought to be counted a miracle. If we look into their work by itself, it
is quite contrary to God; but as God doth, in the sun and other planets,
by wonderful cunning, temper contrary motions, and such as strive among
themselves, so he directeth the perverse endeavors of the wicked, by his
secret power, unto another end than they thought upon and did desire,
lest they should do any thing but that which he would. They, indeed, as
touching themselves, do contrary to his will; but it falleth out
according to the will of God after an incomprehensible manner. Forasmuch
as this course is contrary to nature, no marvel if the wisdom of the
flesh see it not. Therefore, it must be discerned with the eye of faith,
or rather it must be reverenced; and those dogs who bark against it must
be despised with their wantonness.  <span
id="fr_807"></span>[808](#fn_807.md)

<span id="xx.vi-p20"></span><span id="xx.vi-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xx.vi-p21"></span>**28.** *When as they found no cause of
death.* It was very pertinent to the matter that they should know that
Christ was put to death guiltless, for we could not have been justified
by his death, if he had suffered death for his own evil deeds; therefore
it was requisite that he should be guiltless, that his death might be a
satisfaction for the sins of the world. And, undoubtedly, I think that
Paul did plainly declare that Pilate condemned Christ, not according to
the office of a judge, but that he consented that he should be put to
death after that he was overcome with the ungodly requests of the
people; and also that the Jews were driven by lust, and not enforced by
reason, to desire Christ’s death.: For it stood him upon to terrify the
hearers, that they might not couple themselves  <span
id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808.md) to so wicked a fact. But Luke doth now
in few words set down, after his common custom, those things which Paul
did then more at large declare.

<span id="xx.vi-p23"></span><span id="xx.vi-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xx.vi-p24"></span>**29.** *When they had fulfilled all
things;* to wit, which it pleased God should be done by them. For they
did so handle Christ that there was nothing of the prophecies of the
Scripture left unfulfilled. By this means is the stumbling-block (which
the understanding of the flesh conceiveth by reason of the ignominy of
the cross) taken away, that the Son of God was not laid open to the
furious fury of the wicked; but he obeyed his fathers decree.
Furthermore, it doth also in Scripture appear what condition was
appointed for him in times past. Whereas he saith that Christ was buried
by the same which had slain him, it seemeth contrary to the history of
the gospel; but it may be that Luke did take the word *buried*
indefinitely. And if it please you to refer it unto the same, it shall
be *synecdoche.* For he was buried with Pilate’s leave; and at the
appointment and pleasure of the priests there were watchmen set to watch
the grave. Therefore, though Joseph and Nicodemus did bury Christ,
(<span id="xx.vi-p24.1"></span>[Mt
27:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#057)<span id="xx.vi-p24.1"></span>,.md)
that is ascribed improperly, and yet not absurdly, to the Jews; because
it is not Paul’s drift in this place to commend the good deed, but to
prove Christ’s resurrection; because God took him out of the grave whom
his enemies had shut up there. Therefore he giveth us to understand that
the body of Christ was not taken thence privily or by stealth, but that
it was laid in a place both famous and known to the adversaries; and so,
consequently, that even they were set to watch it; and yet for all this
it was not found: whence we may gather the certainty of the
resurrection.

<span id="xx.vi-p25"></span><span id="xx.vi-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xx.vi-p26"></span>**30.** *God hath raised him up.* The death
of Christ was the salvation of the godly, yet joined with the
resurrection; therefore doth Paul stand longer upon this second point.
For he should never have persuaded his hearers that they were to seek
salvation in Christ’s death, unless the power of Almighty God had
appeared in raising Christ from death.

<span id="xx.vi-p27"></span><span id="xx.vi-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xx.vi-p28"></span>**31.** After that he hath said that Christ
came out of the grave, which was beset with the hired ministers of the
adversaries, he addeth now that he appeared to many of the disciples,
which bare faithful witness to the people. And he calleth them
*witnesses,* either in respect of their office; because they were chosen
for this purpose, as we have already said in the first chapter, (<span
id="xx.vi-p28.1"></span>[Ac 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008.md)<span
id="xx.vi-p28.1"></span>;) or else declaring simply that they professed
openly and freely that which they knew concerning Christ. Whereupon it
followeth that the matter was made known openly  <span
id="fr_809"></span>[810](#fn_809.md) at Jerusalem. And the proof was not so
light; because, in the fearful power of the enemies, who were ready and
bent to resist, and did omit nothing, there were, notwithstanding, such
as did openly affirm that Christ rose again, and were also such as saw
that thing with their eyes; for if there had been any refutation in
readiness, the scribes would not have neglected it.
