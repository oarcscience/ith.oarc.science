<span id="xvi.iii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
9:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#010.md)<span id="xvi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p2"></span>**10.** And there was a certain disciple at
Damascus, called Ananias, unto whom the Lord said in a vision, Ananias.
And he said, Here am I, Lord. **11.** And the Lord said unto him, Arise,
and go into the way that is called Straight, and seek in the house of
Judas one called Saul of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth. **12.** And he
hath seen in a vision a man, named Ananias, entering in, and laying his
hand upon him that he might see.

<span id="xvi.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xvi.iii-p4"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p5"></span>**10.** We have said before that this man
was rather chosen than any of the apostles, that Paul, having laid away
the swelling of his arrogancy, might learn to hear the least, and that
he \[might\] come down from too great loftiness even unto the lowest
degree. And this vision was necessary for Ananias, lest through fear he
should withdraw himself from that function which was enjoined him, to
wit, to teach Paul. For though he know that the Lord calleth him, yet he
slideth back, or, at least, he excuseth himself. Therefore it was
requisite that he should have some certain testimony of his calling,
that there should happy success be promised to his labor, that he might
take that in hand with a joyful and valiant mind which the Lord
commanded. Furthermore, as Christ animateth and confirmeth Ananias, by
appearing to him in the vision, so he prepareth and maketh Paul ready
for all things, that he may receive Ananias reverently, as if he would
receive an angel coming from heaven. The Lord could have sent Paul
straightway unto Ananias, and have showed him his house, but this was
more fit for his confirmation; because he knew the better that the Lord
had a care of him. And also the Lord setteth out his grace unto us, that
as he stopped Paul before, so now he reacheth him his hand of his own
accord, by his minister. And, in the mean season, we are also taught, by
his example, to be more ready and careful to seek out the lost sheep.

<span id="xvi.iii-p6"></span>*In a vision.* This word *vision*
signifieth some light  <span id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581.md) which was
set before the eyes to testify God’s presence. For this is the use of
visions, that the majesty of the Word being well proved, it may purchase
credit, amongst men; which kind of confirmation God used oftentimes
toward the prophets; as he saith, that he speaketh to his servants by a
vision or by a dream. He hath, indeed, suffered Satan to deceive the
unbelievers with false imaginations and visures.  <span
id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582.md) But forasmuch as Satan’s juggling
casts are of power only in darkness, God doth lighten the minds of his
children so, that they assure themselves that they need not to fear
legerdemain.  <span id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583.md) Therefore Ananias
answereth, *Here am I, Lord,* knowing indeed that it was God.

<span id="xvi.iii-p10"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p11"></span>**11.** *For, behold, he prayeth.* Luke
showeth that Paul gave himself  <span id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584.md)
to prayer those three days; and peradventure this was one cause why he
fasted, although it be certain, as I have already said, that he suffered
such long hunger, because he was after a sort deprived of sense, as men
which are in a trance use to be. Christ doth assuredly speak of no short
prayer  <span id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585.md) in this place, but he
doth rather show that Paul continued in this kind of exercise until he
should be more quiet in mind. For besides other causes of terror, that
voice might sound in his ears, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?”
And it is not to be doubted but that the careful  <span
id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586.md) looking for a perfect revelation did
marvellously trouble his mind; but this was the reason why the Lord
caused him to wait three days, that he might the more kindle in him an
earnest desire to pray.

<span id="xvi.iii-p15"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p16"></span>**12.** *He saw a man, named Ananias.* It
is uncertain whether Luke do yet repeat the words of Christ, or he add
this of his own. Those which take it in the person of Luke are moved
with some show of absurdity, because it is an unlikely thing that Christ
used these words. Although this may be easily answered thus, to wit,
that Christ confirmeth Ananias after this sort, There is no cause why
thou shouldst fear but that he will receive thee willingly, forasmuch as
he already knoweth thy shape by a vision. I have also told him thy name,
and whatsoever thou shalt do with him. Yet may the reader choose whether
he will.
