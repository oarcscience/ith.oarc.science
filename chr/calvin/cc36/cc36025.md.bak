<span id="ix.x-p1"></span><span id="ix.x-p1.1"></span>[Acts
2:46-47](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#046.md)<span id="ix.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.x-p2"></span>**46.** And continuing daily with one accord
in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they did eat
their meat with gladness, and singleness of heart, **47.** Praising God,
and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added daily unto the
congregation those which should be saved.

<span id="ix.x-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.x-p4"></span><span id="ix.x-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.x-p5"></span>**46.** *Continuing in the temple* We must
note that they did frequent the temple for this cause, because there was
more opportunity and occasion offered there to further the gospel.
Neither were they drawn with the holiness of the place, seeing they knew
that the shadows of the law were ceased; neither meant they to draw
others by their example to have the temple in any such reverence;  <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) but because there was there great
concourse of people, who having laid aside their private cares,
wherewith they had been drawn away elsewhere,  <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) did seek the Lord; they were
continually in the temple, that they might gain such unto Christ. There
might be another reason which might induce them hereunto, that they
might have a mutual conference and imparting of doctrine amongst
themselves, which they could not have done so conveniently in a private
house, especially seeing they were so, many.

<span id="ix.x-p8"></span>*Breaking bread from house to house.* Luke
signifieth unto us, that they did not only show some token of true
godliness publicly, but that the course and tenor of their private life
was alone in that respect. For whereas some do think that in this place,
by breaking of bread is meant the Holy Supper, it seemeth to me that
Luke meant no such thing. He signifieth, therefore, unto us, that they
used to eat together, and that thriftily.  <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) For those which make sumptuous
banquets do not eat their meat together so familiarly. Again, Luke
addeth, *in singleness of heart;* which is also a token of temperance.
In sum, his meaning is to declare, that their manner of living was
brotherly and sober. Some do join simplicity and gladness with the
praise of God; and both texts may well be allowed.  <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) But because there can be no singleness
of heart in praising God, unless the stone be also in all parts of the
life, therefore it is certain, that there is mention made thereof in
this sense, that the faithful did always use the same in all places.
 <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) And we must also note the
circumstance of time, that, being environed and beset with many dangers,
they were merry and joyful. The knowledge of God’s love toward us, and
the hope of his protection, do bring us this goodness with them, that we
praise God with quiet minds, whatsoever the world doth threaten. And as
Luke spoke a little before of the public estate of the Church, so he
declareth now what form and manner of life the faithful did use; that we
may learn by their example a thrifty fellowship in our manner of living,
and in all our whole life to embrace singleness, to enjoy the spiritual
joy, and to exercise ourselves in the praises of God. Furthermore, the
singleness of heart reacheth far; but if you join it in this place with
breaking of bread, it shall signify as much as sincere love, where one
man dealeth plainly with another, neither doth any man craftily hunt
after his own profit. Yet had I rather set the same against that
carefulness, wherewith worldly men  <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) do too much torment themselves. For
when as we do not cast our care upon the Lord, this reward hangeth over
our heads, that we tremble and quake even when we take our rest.

<span id="ix.x-p13"></span><span id="ix.x-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.x-p14"></span>**47.** *Having favor.* This is the fruit of
an innocent life, to find favor even amongst strangers. And yet we need
not to doubt of this, but that they were hated of many. But although he
speak generally of the people, yet he meaneth that part alone which was
sound, neither yet infected with any poison of hatred; he signifieth
briefly, that the faithful did so behave themselves, that the people did
full well like of them for their innocency of life.  <span
id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md)

<span id="ix.x-p16"></span>*The Lord added daily.* He showeth in these
words that their diligence was not without profit; they studied so much
as in them lay to gather into the Lord’s sheepfold those which wandered
and went astray. He saith that their labor bestowed herein was not lost;
because the Lord did increase his Church daily. And surely, whereas the
Church is rather diminished than increased, that is to be imputed to our
slothfulness, or rather forwardness.  <span
id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) And although they did all of them
stoutly labor to increase the kingdom of Christ, yet Luke ascribeth
 <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) this honor to God alone, that
he brought strangers into the Church. And surely this is his own proper
work. For the ministers do no good by planting or watering, unless he
make their labor effectual by the power of his Spirit, (<span
id="ix.x-p18.2"></span>[1Co 3](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#000.md)<span
id="ix.x-p18.2"></span>.) Furthermore, we must note that he saith, that
those were gathered unto the Church which should be saved. For he
teacheth that this is the means to attain salvation, if we be
incorporate into the Church. For like as there is no remission of sins,
so neither is there any hope of salvation.  <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) Furthermore, this is an excellent
comfort for all the godly, that they were received into the Church that
they might be saved; as the Gospel is called the power of God unto
salvation to all that believe, (<span id="ix.x-p19.2"></span>[Ro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)<span id="ix.x-p19.2"></span>..md)
Now, forasmuch as God doth gather only a part, or a certain number, this
grace is restrained unto election, that it may be the first cause of our
salvation.
