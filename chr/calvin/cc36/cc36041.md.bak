<span id="xii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
5:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#007.md)<span id="xii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p2"></span>**7.** And there was passed about the space
of three hours, when his wife came in, ignorant of that which was done.
**8.** And Peter said unto her, Tell me, sold ye the field for so much?
She answered, Surely, for so much. **9.** And Peter said unto her, What
is this that ye are agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?
Behold, the feet of those which have buried thy husband are at the door,
which shall carry thee out. **10.** And immediately she fell down at his
feet, and gave up the ghost. Furthermore, when the young men came in,
they found her dead, and when they had carried her out, they buried her
beside her husband. **11.** And there came great fear upon all the
church, and upon all which heard these things.

<span id="xii.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xii.ii-p4"></span><span id="xii.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p5"></span>**7.** That punishment wherewith the Lord
punished Sapphira containeth no new thing, save only that the example
was the more confirmed thereby. And it came to pass by the certain
providence of God, that the Church should see apart the obstinate
wickedness and treacherous mind of them both. Seeing their faults were
alike, they might have been known together; but this was more fit and
profitable for the Church, that they might severally bewray their own
wickedness. Neither was Sapphira provoked by the sight of her husband to
dissemble, (as it falleth out oftentimes,) that the fault could be
ascribed to shamefacedness, but of her own accord, and being pricked
forward by no other means, she seemeth to be no better than her husband.
Moreover, their wickedness in lying was like, forasmuch as she may see
by Peter’s interrogation that their guile was found out.

<span id="xii.ii-p6"></span><span id="xii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p7"></span>**8.** *Tell me.* We see that God doth not
by and by  <span id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) punish her, but first
he trieth the matter thoroughly, lest he should send vengeance upon any
save the obstinate, and those which will not be pardoned.  <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) For although Sapphira did know that
the matter was hidden, she ought to have been stricken with this
question of Peter, no otherwise than if she had been cited to appear
before the judgment-seat of God. She hath a time granted her to repent;
yea, this is, as it were, a pleasant  <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) inviting unto repentance. But she, in
holding on so carelessly,  <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) doth
declare that she was incurable, because she is touched with no fear of
God.

<span id="xii.ii-p12"></span>And hereby are we taught to labor
diligently to bring sinners into the way. For the Spirit of God keepeth
this moderation; but when as stubbornness and the stubborn contempt of
God is added unto the offense, it is now high time to punish. Therefore,
those men are too arrogant who are displeased with the immoderate rigor
of God. It is rather our duty to consider how we shall in time to come
 <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) stand before the judgment-seat
of God; although this is too much to despise his holy power and majesty,
if we will have him mocked freely without any punishment. Moreover, so
many circumstances, which before I have gathered, do sufficiently prove
that Ananias and Sapphira were not worthy of one death only. For, first
of all, hypocrisy is of itself very abominable to God. Secondly, whereas
they are determined to lie unto God, this ariseth of great contempt, in
that they do not reverence and fear Christ, being the Chief Governor of
those amongst whom they were. It is ungodliness joined with impudency;
because, so they can escape shame and reproach amongst men, before whom
they were determined to vaunt and brag, they pass not to deny their
manifest wickedness unto God. Whereas they do stubbornly deny their
offense, this doth, as it were, make up the heap and measure. And
whereas innumerable hypocrites do no less mock God and the Church daily,
who, notwithstanding, are not punished with death, I have already showed
why this ought to seem to be no inconvenient thing.  <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) Forasmuch as God is the only Judge of
the world, it belongeth to him to punish every man at his pleasure, when
and how it seemeth good to him. Wherefore we must not prescribe unto him
a certain mean and manner of punishment. But the greatness of the
spiritual judgment, which is as yet hid, hath been set before us in the
bodily punishment of two, as in a mirror. For if we consider what it is
to be cast into eternal fire, we shall not judge that this is the
greatest evil and punishment of all, to fall down dead before men. Look
the 10th chapter of the First to the Corinthians, verse 5.

<span id="xii.ii-p15"></span><span id="xii.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p16"></span>**9.** *To tempt the Spirit.* He uttereth
the same thing in other words which he had said before; to wit, that
they did mock God unreverently and contemptibly. But he said that they
*tempted* the Spirit, because they had cunningly packed their fraud, as
if the Spirit of God were not the knower of the hearts. For it was a
point of too great carelessness, seeing the one made the other privy to
their wickedness, to make their match between themselves, having, as it
were, excluded God. For the Scripture saith, that God is tempted either
when his power is taken from him, or the knowledge of all things is
denied him. Furthermore, he meaneth that Spirit which governed the
Church by the apostles. For when Christ saith, When the Spirit cometh,
he shall judge the world, he noteth no other kind of authority than that
which he exerciseth by the ministry of the Church.

<span id="xii.ii-p17"></span><span id="xii.ii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p18"></span>**11.** *And there came fear.* He saith,
again, that the punishment of one was a lesson to all. But he plainly
expresseth in this place a double fear. He saith that the Church feared,
because the faithful do never so perfectly fear God, but that they
profit yet more, being admonished by his judgments. Therefore, by all
those punishments which we read have been laid upon men in times past,
and do daily see to be laid upon them, doth God call us back from the
enticements and liberty of sinning. For our flesh must be bridled every
now and then after this sort, because one bridle will scarce serve the
turn. There was another manner \[of\] fear in the strangers, yet no such
fear as brought them unto the sincere worship of God; yet,
notwithstanding, it was such as caused them to give the glory to God.
