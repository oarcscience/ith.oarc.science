<span id="ix.v-p1"></span><span id="ix.v-p1.1"></span>[Acts
2:25-31](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#025.md)<span id="ix.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p2"></span>**25.** For David saith of him, I saw the Lord
before me always, because he is on my right hand; lest I should be
moved. **26.** For this my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad;
moreover, my flesh shall rest in hope: **27.** Because thou wilt not
leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see
corruption. **28.** Thou hast made known unto me the ways of life, thou
shalt fill me with gladness with thy face. **29.** Men and brethren,
seeing that I may boldly speak unto you of the patriarch David, because
he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher remaineth with us until
this day. **30.** Therefore, seeing he was a prophet, and did know that
God had sworn unto him with an oath that it should come to pass, that
Christ should rise of the fruits of his loins, concerning the flesh, who
should sit upon his throne; **31.** He knowing this before, spoke of the
resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither did
his flesh see corruption.

<span id="ix.v-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.v-p4"></span><span id="ix.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p5"></span>**25.** The resurrection,  <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) which was both declared and witnessed
by certain and evident testimonies, and which might also have been
gathered out of the continual doctrine of the prophets, was to be proved
to the Jews as some new and strange thing. And no marvel. For we see
that although Christ had oftentimes beat  <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) the same into his disciples’ heads,
yet did they profit but a little. And yet did they retain certain
principles of true doctrine, which might have made a way for them unto
the knowledge of Christ, as we shall see by and by. Therefore, because
the gift of the Spirit was a fruit of the resurrection of Christ, he
proveth by the testimony of David that Christ must needs have risen
again, that the Jews may thereby know that he was the author of the
gift. For he taketh it as a thing which all men grant, that he was
raised up from death, that he may live not for himself, but for his. Now
we see Peter’s drift; that that ought to seem no strange thing which was
foretold so long before; and that Jesus is also Christ, because David
did prophecy of him, as of the tied of the Church.

<span id="ix.v-p8"></span>First of all, we must see whether this place
ought altogether to be understood of Christ, as Peter affirmeth; that
done, if there be any thing in the words worth noting, we will in order
discuss it. Peter denieth that that agreeth with David which is said in
this place:

<span id="ix.v-p9"></span>“Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see
corruption,”  
(<span id="ix.v-p9.2"></span>[Ps
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010)<span id="ix.v-p9.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="ix.v-p10"></span>because David’s carcass was corrupt in the
grave. It seemeth at the first blush to be but a light argument. For a
man might easily object, that the word is not to be urged, forasmuch as
David meant nothing else, save only to exempt himself from destruction.
Therefore, howsoever corruption did touch him, yet doth that no whit
hinder but that he may easily say that he was safe from the danger
thereof, because he knew that the Lord would deliver him. Yea, it
seemeth to be a repetition of the former sentence, according to the
common custom of the Hebrew tongue. Which if it be so, the sense shall
be plain, that God will not suffer him to be oppressed with death, or
that death should consume him. And this interpretation is confirmed by
that where we read *hell,* it is in Hebrew <span
id="ix.v-p10.1"></span>סל*, (seol;)* where we read *corruption,* there
it is <span id="ix.v-p10.2"></span>שחת, *(shachat;)* both these words do
signify the grave. By this means David should say twice, that he shall
be delivered from death by the grace of God. Finally, he saith the same
thing in this place, which he saith, (<span id="ix.v-p10.3"></span>[Ps
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015)<span id="ix.v-p10.3"></span>,.md)
“God shall redeem my soul from the hand of hell.” Like as, on the other
side, when he speaketh of the reprobates, he is wont to take *“going*
down into the grave” for destruction. I answer briefly, that there is
some greater thing expressed in this place than the common redemption or
deliverance of the godly. David, indeed, doth promise that God will be
his eternal deliverer, as well in life as in death. Neither had he been
much better for this, to have been once delivered from one danger,
unless he had hoped that he should be safe even unto the end through
God’s protection; but he speaketh of such safety as is not common.
 <span id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) And surely the words do sound
that he speaketh of some new and singular privilege. Admit I grant that
it is a repetition, and that there is all one thing uttered in these two
members, “Thou shalt not leave my soul in hell;” and, “Thou shalt not
suffer me to see corruption;” yet do I deny that it is simply to be
understood that God will deliver his Holy One from eternal destruction;
for freedom from corruption is promised by name. Neither do I pass for
this, that <span id="ix.v-p11.2"></span>שחת *(shachat)* doth signify the
grave, as <span id="ix.v-p11.3"></span>סל, *(seol,)* which is put in the
former member. For although I do not stand nor contend about the words,
yet must we respect the etymology. Therefore, forasmuch as the grave is
called <span id="ix.v-p11.4"></span>שחת, *(shachat)* because it doth
corrupt man’s body with rottenness, it is not to be doubted but that
David meant to note that quality. Therefore, the place is not so much
expressed by this word, as the condition of rotting. So that the sense
is, that God will not suffer him of whom the Psalm speaketh “to rot or
corrupt in the grave.” And forasmuch as David was not free from this
necessity, it followeth that the prophecy was neither truly nor
perfectly fulfilled in him.

<span id="ix.v-p12"></span>And that the Psalm ought altogether to be
expounded of Christ, the thing itself doth prove. For seeing that David
was one of the sons of Adam, he could not escape that universal
condition and estate of mankind,

<span id="ix.v-p13"></span>“Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt
return,”  
(<span id="ix.v-p13.2"></span>[Ge
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019)<span id="ix.v-p13.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="ix.v-p14"></span>the grave standeth open (I say) for all the
children of Adam, that it may swallow them up, and consume them; so that
no man can exempt himself from corruption. So that, beholding ourselves
apart from Christ, we see the grave prepared for us, which threateneth
to us corruption. Wherefore, if David be separated from Christ, that
shall not belong to him which is here said, that he shall be preserved
from the grave. Therefore, when he boasteth that he shall be free from
the grave, as touching corruption, without all doubt he placeth himself
in the body of Christ, wherein death was overcome, and the kingdom
thereof abolished. But and if David do promise himself exempting from
the grave in another respect, save only so far forth as he is a member
of Christ, hereby it appeareth that this freedom must begin at Christ as
at the head. What man soever shall be of sound judgment shall easily
know that this is a good argument. God did put all mankind under
corruption; therefore, David, inasmuch as he was of the number of men,
could not be free from the same. Neither is it to be doubted, but that
the Jews, before whom this sermon was made, forasmuch as without
question that maxim was of force amongst them, that they were to hope
for the restoring of things at the hands of Christ alone, did the more
readily stay themselves upon  <span id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md)
the words of Peter; because they saw that that could no otherwise be
which the words do import, unless they should apply it to the Messias.
For they were not come to that point of impudence, at least those of
whom mention is made here, that they durst cavil in matters which were
evident; for God had then offered unto his disciples those which were
godly hearers, and apt to be taught. They sought the Messias in the Old
Testament. They knew that David was a figure of him. There was amongst
them some religion and reverence of the Scriptures then; but now the
impudency of all the whole nation almost is desperate. Howsoever they be
urged, they wrench themselves out one way or other.  <span
id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) Where there is no way to escape, yet
they break through; although they be overcome, yet will they not yield;
neither is it to be doubted but that this their shameless forwardness is
a punishment for their ungodliness. But let us return unto Peter’s
sermon.

<span id="ix.v-p17"></span>Seeing that David doth not only affirm that
God also shall be his deliverer, but doth express a singular way and
means; namely, that he shall not be subject to the corruption of the
grave, Peter doth for good causes gather, that that doth not properly
appertain unto him, for that his body was corrupt in the grave. And now,
because this had been somewhat hard to be spoken among the Jews, he
mollifieth the hardness with a circumlocution. For he doth not flatly
deny in one word that that was fulfilled indeed in David, but doth only
by the way  <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) signify so much unto
them, because he lieth consumed in the grave after the common custom of
other men. And David did so prophesy of Christ, that he did both apply
this consolation unto himself privately, and’ also extend the same unto
the whole body of the Church. For that which is sound and perfect in the
head is spread abroad, being afterward poured out into all the members.
Neither is it to be denied but that David spoke of himself in this
place; yet only so far forth as he beheld himself in Christ, as in the
mirror of life. First, he hath respect unto Christ; after that he
turneth his eyes toward himself, and others the faithful. So that we
have a general doctrine prescribed unto us in this plate, concerning the
nature of faith, the spiritual joy of conscience: and the hope of
eternal deliverance.

<span id="ix.v-p19"></span>*I saw* We must hold this principle. If we
will have God present with us, we must set him before our eyes; and that
before he do appear; for the prospect of faith pierceth far further than
unto the present experience. Therefore faith hath this property, to set
God always before it as a guide in all dangers and confused matters. For
there is nothing that doth so much hold us up, as when we know that God
is present with us; as the opinion of his absence doth often cast us
down, and at length quite discourage us. David addeth, That he took not
heed in vain unto the direction of God. “He is (saith he) at my right
hand;” whereby he doth signify that we need not to fear lest we be
deceived,  <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) when as we set him
before us at present; for we shall always feel his help most ready.
Faith, in hoping for the help of God, ought to prevent and overgo  <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) all experience, and whatsoever is
perceived by the sense; but so soon as it shall give this glory to God,
that it doth behold him in his Word, although he be absent, and so,
consequently, invisible, it shall be overcome with the effect of the
thing. For the measure of faith is not able to comprehend the infinite
greatness of the power and goodness of God. He draweth a similitude from
those which, when they will underprop the weak, or strengthen the
fearful, do join themselves unto their side. Not to be moved, is not to
be thrown down from their degree, but to remain firm in their estate;
like as also <span id="ix.v-p21.2"></span>[Ps
46:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005.md)<span id="ix.v-p21.2"></span>, God
is in the midst of it, therefore shall it not be moved. For although it
come to pass sometimes that the godly be sore shaken, yet because they
come to themselves again, they are said to continue firm. Therefore,
there is no cause why they should be afraid of falling, who are upholden
by the help of God. Like as, on the other side, those which place their
strength anywhere else save only in God, they shall be like to fall at
every blast of wind, but at any mean wind of temptation they shall fall
to the ground.

<span id="ix.v-p22"></span><span id="ix.v-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p23"></span>**26.** *For this my heart rejoiced* Joy of
the soul, gladness of the tongue, and quietness of all the whole body,
do ensue upon sure hope and confidence; for unless men be quite past
feeling,  <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) they must needs be
careful and sorrowful, and so, consequently, miserably tormented, so
long as they feel themselves destitute of the help of God. But that sure
trust which we repose in God doth not only deliver us from carefulness,
 <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) but doth also replenish our
hearts with wonderful joy (and gladness.) That is the joy which Christ
promised to his disciples should be full in them, and which he testified
could not be taken from them, (<span id="ix.v-p25.2"></span>[John
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022.md), [John
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#013)<span id="ix.v-p25.2"></span>..md)
He expresseth the greatness of the joy when he saith, That it cannot be
kept in, but that it will break forth into the gladness of the tongue.
 <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) <span
id="ix.v-p26.2"></span>כבוד, doth signify, indeed, *glory,* but it is
taken in that place, as in many others, for *the tongue* And so the
Grecians have truly translated the same. The rest of the *flesh* doth
signify the quietness of the whole man, which we have through the
protection of God. Neither is this any let, because the faithful are
continually out of quiet and tremble; for as in the midst of sorrows
they do nevertheless rejoice; so there are no troubles so great that can
break them of their rest. If any man object, that the peace of the
faithful doth consist in the spirit, and that it is not in the flesh: I
answer, that the faithful do rest in body; not that they are free from
troubles, but because they believe that God careth for them wholly, and
that not only their soul shall be safe through his protection, but their
body also.

<span id="ix.v-p27"></span><span id="ix.v-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p28"></span>**27.** *Because thou shalt not leave* To
leave the soul in hell is to suffer the same to be oppressed with
destruction. There be two words used in this place, both which do
signify the grave amongst the Hebricians. Because <span
id="ix.v-p28.1"></span>שאול, doth signify *to require,* I suppose it is
called <span id="ix.v-p28.2"></span>סול, because death is insatiable;
whence also cometh that translation, Hell hath enlarged her soul. Again,
they set open their mouth like hell. And because the latter <span
id="ix.v-p28.3"></span>שחת, is derived and set for *corruption,* or
*consumption,* that quality is to be considered, as David meant to note
the same. Those things which are disputed in this place by divers,
concerning the descending of Christ into hell, are in my judgment
superfluous; because they are far from the intent and purpose of the
prophet. For the word *anima,* or *soul,* doth not so much signify the
spirit being of an immortal essence as the life itself. For when a man
is dead, and lieth in the grave, the grave is said to rule over his
life. Whereas the Grecians translate it *holy,* it is in Hebrew <span
id="ix.v-p28.4"></span>חסת, which doth properly signify *meek,* or
*gentle,* but Luke did not much regard this, because it doth not much
appertain unto the present purpose. Furthermore, gentleness and meekness
is so often commended in the faithful, because it behoveth them to
imitate and resemble the nature of their Father.

<span id="ix.v-p29"></span><span id="ix.v-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p30"></span>**28.** *Thou hast made known.* He meaneth,
that he was restored from death to life by the grace of God. For in that
he was, as it were, a man raised from death to life, he acknowledgeth
that it was a great good gift of God. This was in such sort fulfilled in
Christ, that there wanted nothing unto perfection. As for the members
they have their measure. Therefore Christ was far from corruption, that
he may be the first-fruits of those which rise from death, (<span
id="ix.v-p30.1"></span>[1Co 15:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#023.md)<span
id="ix.v-p30.1"></span>.) We shall follow him in our order at length,
but being first turned into dust, (<span id="ix.v-p30.2"></span>[1Co
15:42](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#042)<span id="ix.v-p30.2"></span>..md)
That which followeth, that *he was filled with gladness,* with the
countenance of God, agreeth with that: Show us thy face, and we shall be
safe. And, again, The light of thy countenance is showed upon us: thou
hast put gladness in my heart. For it is only the pleasantness of God’s
countenance, which doth not only make us glad, but also quickens us;
again, when the same is turned away, or troubled, we must needs faint.

<span id="ix.v-p31"></span><span id="ix.v-p31.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p32"></span>**30.** *Therefore, seeing he was a prophet*
He showeth, by two reasons, that it is no marvel if David do speak of
things that should come to pass long after his time; the former is,
because he was a prophet. And we know that things to come, and such as
are removed far from the knowledge of men, are revealed unto the
prophets. Therefore, it were wickedness to measure their speeches
according to the common manner and order which we use in measuring the
speeches of other men, forasmuch as they go beyond the long courses of
years, having the Spirit for their director. Whereupon they are also
called seers; because being placed, as it were, upon an high tower,
 <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) they see those things which, by
reason of great distance, are hidden from other men. Another reason is,
because Christ was promised to him peculiarly. This maxim was so common
amongst the Jews, that they had ever now and then the son of David in
their mouth, so often as there was any mention made of Christ. They be
no such arguments, I confess, as do necessarily prove that this prophecy
is to be expounded of Christ; neither was that Peter’s intent and
purpose; but first he meant to prevent the contrary objection, whence
David had such skill to foretell a thing which was unknown. Therefore he
saith, That he knew Christ, both by prophetical revelation, and also by
singular promise. Furthermore, this principle was of great (<span
id="ix.v-p33.2"></span>[Ro 10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004.md)<span
id="ix.v-p33.2"></span>) force amongst the better-minded sort which Paul
setteth down, that Christ is the end of the law.  <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) No man, therefore, did doubt of this,
but that this was the mark whereat all the prophets did aim, to lead the
godly unto Christ as it were by the hand. Therefore, what notable or
extraordinary thing soever they did utter, the Jews were commonly
persuaded that it did agree with Christ. Furthermore, we must note, that
Peter doth reason soundly, when he gathered that David was not ignorant
of that which was the chiefest point of all revelations.

<span id="ix.v-p35"></span>*He had sworn with an oath* God swore not
only to the end he might make David believe his promise, but also that
the thing promised might be had in greater estimation. And to this end,
in my judgment, it is here repeated, that the Jews may think with
themselves of what great weight the promise was, which God did make so
notable (and so famous.) The same admonition is profitable for us also.
For we need not to doubt of this, but that the Lord meant to set forth
the excellency of the covenant by putting in a solemn oath. In the mean
season, this is also a fit remedy for the infirmity of our faith, that
the sacred name of God is set forth unto us,  <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) that his words may carry the greater
credit. These words, “according to the flesh,” do declare that there was
some more noble thing in Christ than the flesh. Therefore Christ did so
come of the seed of David as he was man, that he doth nevertheless,
retain his divinity; and so the distinction between the two natures is
plainly expressed; when as Christ is called the Son of God, according to
his eternal essence, in like sort as he is called the seed of David
according to the flesh.
