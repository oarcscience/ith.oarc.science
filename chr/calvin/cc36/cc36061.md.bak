<span id="xiv.ix-p1"></span><span id="xiv.ix-p1.1"></span>[Acts
7:42-43](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#042.md)<span id="xiv.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ix-p2"></span>**42.** And God turned himself, and gave
them up to worship the host of heaven: as it is written in the book of
the prophets, Have ye offered unto me slain beasts and sacrifices by the
space of forty years in the wilderness, O ye house of Israel? **43.**
And ye took to you the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god
Remphan, and figures which ye made to worship them; therefore I will
carry you away beyond Babylon.

<span id="xiv.ix-p3"></span> 

<span id="xiv.ix-p4"></span><span id="xiv.ix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ix-p5"></span>Stephen will here declare that the Jews did
never make an end of sinning, but that they wandered farther in their
froward errors; so that that first fall of theirs was unto them as it
were an entrance into a labyrinth. And this doth he assign unto the just
vengeance of God, that after that time their madness grew so, that they
gat for one idol infinity. This example teacheth us to be careful to
follow the rule which God hath set down; because, so soon as we are
turned even but a little aside from the same, we must needs be carried
to and fro with divers dotings, we must needs be entangled in many
superstitions, and be utterly drowned in the huge sink of errors; which
punishment God in justice layeth upon men which refuse to obey his word.
Therefore Stephen saith that God was turned away; which word imported as
much as if he should say, that he turned his back. For he had fastened
his eyes after a sort upon the people, when he showed his singular care
which he took in governing them; being offended with their falling away,
now he turneth his face another way.

<span id="xiv.ix-p6"></span>We may also hereby gather that we can no
otherwise follow the right way, save only when the Lord watcheth over us
to govern us; but so soon as his face is turned away, we run by and by
into errors. The Israelites were forsaken of God even then when they
made the calf; but Stephen meant to express the greatness of the
punishment, as if he should have said, that they were altogether cast
off into a reprobate sense then; as Paul also teacheth, that those which
gave not glory to God when he had showed himself unto them, were, by the
just judgment of God, given up unto blindness and blockishness, and unto
shameful lusts, (<span id="xiv.ix-p6.1"></span>[Ro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028)<span id="xiv.ix-p6.1"></span>..md)
Hereby it came to pass, that after that religion began to be corrupt,
innumerable abominations succeeded a few superstitions, and gross
monsters of idolatry came in place of light corruptions. For because men
neglected the light which was set before them, they became altogether
blockish by the just judgment of God, so that they had no more judgment
than brute beasts. Idolatry surely is very fertile, that of one reigned
god there should by and by come an hundred, that a thousand
superstitions should flow from one. But this so great madness of men
springeth hence, because God revengeth himself by delivering them to
Satan; because, after he hath once in hand to govern us, there is no
change in his part, but he is plucked away  <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) from us by our rash lightness.

<span id="xiv.ix-p8"></span>*Have ye offered unto me slain beasts and
sacrifices?* This place is taken out of the fifth chapter of Amos,
(<span id="xiv.ix-p8.1"></span>[Am
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025)<span id="xiv.ix-p8.1"></span>..md)
The speech which Stephen useth showeth that all the prophecies were
gathered into one body; and Amos addeth, (after that he had inveighed
against the idolatry and sundry sins of the people,) that this is no new
evil, that the Jews are rebellious against God, because their fathers
had fallen away from true godliness even in the wilderness. Furthermore,
he denieth that they offered slain beasts to him, not because there were
there no sacrifices at all, but because God refused their corrupt
worship; like as he reproveth and chideth the people in Isaiah, because
they honored him with no sacrifice,

<span id="xiv.ix-p9"></span>“Thou,” (saith he,) “O Jacob, hast not
called upon me, neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices,
neither have I made thee serve in offering or incense. Thou hast not
bought for me calamus, neither hast thou filled me with fatness. But
thou hast been burdenous \[burdensome\] unto me in thy sins, and hast
caused me to serve in thine iniquities,” (<span
id="xiv.ix-p9.1"></span>[Isa
43:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#022)<span id="xiv.ix-p9.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xiv.ix-p10"></span>Assuredly the Jews did all these things
daily, but God accepteth not the obedience of the wicked, neither doth
he approve the same. Again, he abhorreth all that which is polluted with
such mingle-mangles as are added.  <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) Thus doth Amos speak of the fathers
which were revolts.  <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) That which
is added forthwith may be referred either unto them or unto their
posterity.

<span id="xiv.ix-p13"></span><span id="xiv.ix-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ix-p14"></span>**43.** *You took to you the tabernacle of
Moloch.* Some take the copulative for the adversative \[particle,\] as
if he should say, Yea, rather, ye worshipped the idol. It may be
resolved also into the conjunction causal, thus, You did not offer
sacrifices to me, because ye erected a tabernacle to Moloch. But I
expound it somewhat otherwise, to wit, that God doth first accuse the
fathers for the more vehemency; and then afterwards he addeth, that
their posterity did increase the superstitions, because they gat to
themselves new and diverse idols; as if the prophet had spoken thus in
the person of God, If I shall rip up from the beginning, (O house of
Jacob,) how your kindred hath behaved itself toward me; your fathers
began to overthrow and corrupt, even in the wilderness, that worship
which I had commanded; but you have far passed their ungodliness, for
you have brought in an infinite company of gods. And this order is
fitter for Stephen’s purpose; for he intendeth to prove, (as we have
already said,) that after the Israelites felt away unto strange and
bastardly rites, they never made an end of sinning, but being stricken
with blindness, they polluted themselves every now and then with new
idolatries, until they were come even unto the last end  <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) of impiety. Therefore, Stephen
confirmeth this sentence fitly with the testimony of the prophet, that
the Jews, descending of wicked and rebellious fathers, had never ceased
to wax worse and worse. And although the prophet’s words be somewhat
unlike to these, yet is the sense all one. It is to be thought that
Stephen, who had to deal with the Jews, did repeat word for word in
their tongue that which is in the prophet; Luke, who wrote in Greek, did
follow the Greek interpreter. The prophet saith, Ye honored Succoth your
king, and Chiun your image, the star of your gods. The Greek interpreter
made a noun common of a noun proper, because of the alliance  <span
id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) of the word *Succoth,* which
signifieth *a tabernacle.* Furthermore, I cannot tell whence he fetcheth
that his Remphan, unless it were because that word was more used in that
time.

<span id="xiv.ix-p17"></span>*And figures which ye made.* The word
image, which is in the prophet, doth of itself signify no evil thing.
Moreover, the word \[<span id="xiv.ix-p17.1"></span>τυπος\]; is taken
amongst the Grecians in good part. For the ceremonies which God
appointed are called \[<span id="xiv.ix-p17.2"></span>τυποι\];
notwithstanding the prophet condemneth expressly the figures \[types\]
which the Jews had made. Why so? Because God will not be worshipped
under a visible and external form. If any man object that he speaketh in
this place of stars; that is true, I confess; but I stand only upon
this, that although the prophet doth give their idols some honest name,
yet doth he sharply condemn their corrupt worship; whereby the foolish
and childish caviling of the Papists is refuted. Because they deny that
those images which they worship are idols, they say, that that mad
worship of theirs is, \[<span id="xiv.ix-p17.3"></span>εικονοδουλεια\],
or serving of images, and not \[<span
id="xiv.ix-p17.4"></span>ειδολοδουλεια\], or worshipping of idols.
Seeing they mock God sophistically, there is no man that is endued even
but with common understanding, which doth not see that they are more
than ridiculous even in such toys. For although I move no question about
the word, it is certain that the word \[<span
id="xiv.ix-p17.5"></span>τυπος\]; is more honorable than \[<span
id="xiv.ix-p17.6"></span>εικων\]. But those same \[<span
id="xiv.ix-p17.7"></span>τυποι\], or figures, are simply condemned in
this place, which men make to themselves, not only \[<span
id="xiv.ix-p17.8"></span>προς την λατρειαν\], or that they may worship
them, but \[<span id="xiv.ix-p17.9"></span>προς την προσκυνησιν\], that
is, that they may give them even any reverence at all. Therefore that
filthy distinction falleth flat to the ground, wherein the Papists think
they have a crafty starting-hole.  <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md)

<span id="xiv.ix-p19"></span>*Beyond Babylon.* The prophet nameth
Damascus; neither doth the Greek interpretation dissent from the same.
Wherefore it may be that the word Babylon cropt \[crept\] in here
through error; though in the sum of the thing there be no great
difference. The Israelites were to be carried away to Babylon; but
because they thought that they had a sure and strong fortress in the
kingdom of Syria, whose head Damascus was, therefore the prophet saith
that Damascus shall not help them, but that God shall drive them
farther; as if he should say, So long as you have Damascus set against
your enemies, you think that you are well fenced; but God shall carry
you away beyond it; even into Assyria and Chaldea.
