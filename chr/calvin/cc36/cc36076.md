<span id="xvi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
9:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#006.md)<span id="xvi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p2"></span>**6.** And he trembling and fearing said,
Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise,
and go into the city, where it shall be told thee what thou must do.
**7.** And the men which accompanied him in his journey stood amazed,
hearing indeed a voice, and seeing no man. **8.** And when Saul was
risen from the ground, when his eyes were opened he saw no man; but they
led him by the hand, and brought him to Damascus. **9.** And he was
three days without sight, neither eating nor drinking.

<span id="xvi.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xvi.ii-p4"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p5"></span>**6.** The fruit of that reprehension
followeth, wherewith we have said it was requisite that Paul should have
been sore shaken, that his hardness might be broken. For now he offereth
himself as ready to do whatsoever he should command him, whom of late he
despised. For when he asketh what Christ would have him do, he granteth
him authority and power. Even the very reprobate are also terrified with
the threatening of God, so that they are compelled to reverence him, and
to submit themselves unto his will and pleasure; yet, nevertheless, they
cease not to fret and to foster stubbornness within. But as God humbled
Paul, so he wrought effectually in his heart. For it came not to pass by
any goodness of nature, that Paul did more willingly submit himself to
God than Pharaoh, (<span id="xvi.ii-p5.1"></span>[Ex
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#013)<span id="xvi.ii-p5.1"></span>;.md)
but because, being like to an anvil, \[Pharaoh\] did, with his hardness,
beat back the whips of God wherewith he was to be brought under, (even
as it had been the strokes of a hammer;) but the heart of Paul was
suddenly made a fleshy heart of a stony heart, after that it received
softness from the Spirit of God; which softness it had not naturally.
The same thing do we also try \[experience\] daily in ourselves. He
reproveth us by his word; he threateneth and terrifieth us; he addeth
also light correction, and prepareth us divers ways unto subjection. But
all these helps shall never cause any man to bring forth good fruit,
unless the Spirit of God do mollify his heart within.

<span id="xvi.ii-p6"></span>*And the Lord said unto him.* After that
Paul had put his stiff neck under the yoke of Christ, he is now governed
by his hand. For doubtless the Lord doth not so bring us into the way,
that he leaveth us either before we begin our course, or in the midst
thereof; but he bringeth us unto the very mark by little and little.
Luke depainteth out unto us in this place this continual course of God’s
governance. For He taketh him afterward unto himself to be taught whom
He hath made apt to be taught. Neither doth that any whit hinder that he
useth man’s ministry ill this point. Because the authority and power
remaineth nevertheless in him, howsoever he accomplish his work by man;
though it may seem an absurd thing that Christ, who is the Eternal
Wisdom of God, doth send a scholar (who was ready to hear, and did gape
after instruction) unto another  <span id="fr_575"></span>[576](#fn_575.md)
man, that he might learn. But I answer, that that was done not without
cause. For the Lord meant by this means to prove Paul’s modesty, when he
sendeth him to one of his scholars to be taught; as if he himself would
not vouchsafe as yet to speak unto him familiarly, but sendeth him to
his servants whom he did of late both so proudly contemn and so cruelly
persecute.

<span id="xvi.ii-p8"></span>And we are also taught humility under his
person. For if Christ made Paul subject to the teaching of a common
disciple, which of us can grudge to hear any teacher, so that he be
appointed by Christ, that is, he declare himself to be his minister in
deed? Therefore, whereas Paul is sent to Ananias, let us know that that
is done to adorn the ministry of the Church. This is assuredly no small
honor whereunto it pleaseth God to exalt mankind, when as he chooseth
our brethren from amongst us to be interpreters of his will; when as he
causeth his holy oracles to sound in the mouth of man, which is
naturally given to lying and vanity. But the unthankfulness of the world
betrayeth itself again herein, that no man can abide to hear when God
speaketh by the mouth of man. All men could desire to have angels come
flying unto them, or that heaven should be now and then cut asunder, and
that the visible glory of God should come thence. Forasmuch as this
preposterous curiosity springeth from pride and wicked contempt of the
Word, it setteth open a gate to many dotings, and breaketh the bond of
mutual consent among the faithful. Therefore the Lord doth testify, that
it pleaseth him that we should be taught by men, and confirmeth the
order set down by himself. And to this purpose serve these titles, “He
which heareth you heareth me,” (<span id="xvi.ii-p8.1"></span>[Lu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016)<span id="xvi.ii-p8.1"></span>;.md)
that he may cause his word to be reverenced as it ought.

<span id="xvi.ii-p9"></span>*It shall be told thee.* Christ putteth
Ananias in his place by these words, as touching the office of teaching;
not because he resigneth his authority to him, but because he shall be a
faithful minister, and a sincere preacher of the gospel. Therefore we
must always use this moderation, that we hear God alone in Christ, and
Christ himself alone, yet as he speaketh by his ministers. And these two
vices must be avoided, that the ministers be not proud, under color of
such a precious function, or that their base condition impair no whit of
the dignity of heavenly wisdom.

<span id="xvi.ii-p10"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p11"></span>**7.** *And the men.* He speaketh now
briefly of the companions of Paul, that they were witnesses of the
vision. Yet it seemeth that this narration doth not in all points agree
with that of Paul, which we shall see in the 22nd chapter, (<span
id="xvi.ii-p11.1"></span>[Ac 22:9](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#009.md)<span
id="xvi.ii-p11.1"></span>.) For he will say there, that his companions
were terrified with the light, but they heard no voice. Some there be
who think that it was a fault,  <span id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576.md)
and that through ignorance of the writer  <span
id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577.md) the negation is placed out of its
right place. I think that it is no hard matter to answer it; because it
may be that they heard the sound of the voice, yet did they not discern
either who it was that spake, or what was spoken. “They heard not,”
saith he, “the voice of him that spake with me.” Surely this is the
meaning of these words, that he alone knew the speech of Christ. It
followeth not thereupon, but that the rest might have heard a dark and
doubtful voice. Whereas Luke saith in this place that there was a voice
heard, and no man seen, his meaning is, that the voice proceeded from no
man, but that it was uttered by God. Therefore, to the end the miracle
may carry the greater credit, Paul’s companions see a light like to
lightning; they see Paul lie prostrate; a voice they hear (though not
distinctly  <span id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578) .md) sounding from
heaven; and yet, nevertheless, Paul alone is taught what he must do.

<span id="xvi.ii-p15"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p16"></span>**8.** *He was raised up from the earth.*
Luke addeth now, that he was taken with so great fear that he could not
rise of himself; and not that only, but he was also blind for a time,
that he might forget his former wit and wiliness.  <span
id="fr_579"></span>[580](#fn_579.md) When as he saith, that *after that his
eyes were opened, he saw not,* it seemeth that it doth not agree with
the other words which shall follow by and by, that his eyes were
covered, as it were, with scales; but the meaning of this place is, that
he was blind indeed, and deprived of his sight for that three days;
because when he opened his eyes he saw nothing.

<span id="xvi.ii-p18"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p19"></span>**9.** Whereas he saith, that he neither
ate nor drank for the space of three days, that is to be counted a part
of the miracle. For although the men of the east country endure hunger
better than we, yet we do not read that any did fast three days, save
only those who had want of victual, or who were constrained by some
greater necessity. Therefore we gather that Paul was wonderfully afraid,
 <span id="fr_580"></span>[581](#fn_580.md) seeing that being, as it were,
dead, he tasted no meat for three days.
