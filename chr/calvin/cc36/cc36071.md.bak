<span id="xv.v-p1"></span><span id="xv.v-p1.1"></span>[Acts
8:26-31](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026.md)<span id="xv.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.v-p2"></span>**26.** And an angel of the Lord spake to
Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south, to the way which goeth
down from Jerusalem to Gaza; it is waste. **27.** And when he arose, he
went. And, behold, a man, an Ethiopian, an eunuch, a man of great
authority with Candace, queen of Ethiopia, which had the rule of all her
treasure, which carne \[had come\] to Jerusalem to worship **28.** And
as he returned, and sat in his chariot, he read Esaias the prophet.
**29.** And the Spirit said to Philip, Draw near, and be thou joined to
this chariot. **30.** And as Philip ran unto it, he heard him reading
the prophet Esaias, and he said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
**31.** He said, How can I, unless some man direct me? And he requested
Philip that he would come up and sit with him.

<span id="xv.v-p3"></span> 

<span id="xv.v-p4"></span><span id="xv.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xv.v-p5"></span>**26.** *And the angel*. Luke passeth over
unto a new history, to wit, how the gospel came even unto the
Ethiopians. For though he reporteth there was but one man converted unto
the faith of Christ, yet because his authority and power was great in
all the realm, his faith might spread abroad a sweet smell far and wide.
For we know that the gospel grew of small beginnings; and therein
appeared the power of the Spirit more plainly, in that one grain of seed
did fill a whole country in a small space. Philip is first commanded by
the angel to go toward the south; the angel telleth him not to what end.
And thus doth God oftentimes use to deal with those that be his, to
prove their obedience. He showeth what he will have them to do; he
commandeth them to do this or that, but he keepeth the success hidden
with himself. Therefore let us be content with the commandment  <span
id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md) of God alone, although the reason of
that which he enjoineth, or the fruit of obedience, appear not by and
by.  <span id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) For although this be not
plainly expressed, yet all the commandments of God contain a hidden
promise, that so often as we obey him, all that work which we take in
hand must needs fall out well. Moreover, this ought to be sufficient for
us, that God doth allow our studies, when as we take nothing in hand
rashly or without his commandment. If any man object, that angels come
not down daily from heaven to reveal unto us what we ought to do, the
answer is ready, that we are sufficiently taught in the Word of God what
we ought to do, and that they are never destitute of counsel who ask it
of him,  <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) and submit themselves
to the government of the Spirit. Therefore nothing doth hinder and keep
us back from being ready to follow God, save only our own slothfulness
and coldness  <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) in prayer.

<span id="xv.v-p10"></span>*To the way which goeth down to Gaza.* All
the learned grant that that is called Gaza here which the Hebrews call
Haza. Wherefore, Pomponius Mela is deceived, who saith that Cambyses,
king of Persia, called that city by this name, because when he made war
against the Egyptians, he had his riches laid up there. It is true,
indeed, that the Persians call treasure or plenty, *Gaza*; and Luke
useth this word shortly after in this sense, when as he saith that the
eunuch was the chief governor of the treasure of Candace; but because
that Hebrew word was used before such time as Cambyses was born, I do
not think but that it was corrupt afterwards, the letter <span
id="xv.v-p10.1"></span>ה *(heth)* being changed into *g*, which thing we
see was done in all others almost. The epitheton waste is added for this
cause, because Alexander of Macedonia laid waste that old Gaza. Also
Luke refuteth those who make Constantinus the builder of the second and
new Gaza, who affirmeth that it was an hundred and fifty years before;
but it may be that he beautified and enlarged the city after it was
built. And all men confess that this new Gaza was situate on the
seacoast, distant twenty furlongs from the old city.

<span id="xv.v-p11"></span><span id="xv.v-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xv.v-p12"></span>**27.** *Behold, a man, an Ethiopian.* He
calleth him a man, who he saith shortly after was an eunuch; but because
kings and queens in the East were wont to appoint eunuchs over their
weighty affairs, thereby it came to pass that lords of great power were
called generally  <span id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) eunuchs,
whereas, notwithstanding, they were men. Furthermore, Philip findeth
indeed, now at length, that he did not obey God in vain. Therefore,
whosoever committeth the success to God, and goeth on forward thither
whither he biddeth him, he shall at length try  <span
id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) that all that falleth out well which
is taken in hand at his appointment.  <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md) The name *Candace* was not the name of
one queen only; but as all the emperors of Rome were called Caesars,, so
the Ethiopians, as Pliny withesseth, called their queens Candaces. This
maketh also unto the matter that the writers of histories report that
that was a noble and wealthy kingdom, because it may the better be
gathered by the royalty and power thereof how gorgeous the condition and
dignity of the eunuch was. The head and principal place  <span
id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) was Meroe. The profane writers agree
with Luke, who report that women used to reign there.

<span id="xv.v-p17"></span>*Came \[had come\] to worship.* Hereby we
gather that the name of the true God was spread far abroad, seeing he
had some worshippers in far countries. Certes, it must needs be that
this man did openly profess another worship than his nation; for so
great a lord could not come into Judea by stealth, and undoubtedly he
brought with him a great train. And no marvel if there were some
everywhere in the East parts which worshipped the true God, because that
after the people were scattered abroad, there was also some smell  <span
id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) of the knowledge of the true God
spread abroad with them throughout foreign countries; yea, the
banishment  <span id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535.md) of the people was a
spreading abroad of true godliness. Also, we see that though the Romans
did condemn the Jewish religion with many cruel edicts, yet could they
not bring to pass but that many, even on \[in\] heaps, would profess the
same.  <span id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536.md) These were certain
beginnings  <span id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537.md) of the calling of
the Gentiles, until such time as Christ, having with the brightness of
his coming put away the shadows of the law, might take away the
difference which was between the Jews and the Gentiles; and having
pulled down the wall of separation, he might gather together from all
parts the children of God, (<span id="xv.v-p21.2"></span>[Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014)<span id="xv.v-p21.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xv.v-p22"></span>Whereas the eunuch came to Jerusalem to
worship, it must not be accounted any superstition. He might, indeed,
have called  <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538.md) upon God in his own
country, but this man would not omit the exercises which were prescribed
to the worshippers of God; and, therefore, this was his purpose, not
only to nourish faith privily  <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md)
in his heart, but also to make profession of the same amongst men. And
yet, notwithstanding, he could not be so divorced  <span
id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540.md) from his nation, but that he might
well know that he should be hated of many. But he made more account of
the external profession of religion, which he knew God did require, than
of the favor of men. And if such a small sparkle of the knowledge of the
law did so shine in him, what a shame were it for us to choke the
perfect light of the gospel with unfaithful silence? If any do object
that the sacrifices were even then abrogated, and that now the time was
come wherein God would be called upon everywhere without difference of
place, we may easily answer, that those to whom the truth of the gospel
was not yet revealed, were retained in the shadows of the law without
any superstition. For whereas it is said that the law was abolished by
Christ, as concerning the ceremonies, it is thus to be understood, that
where Christ showeth himself plainly, those rites vanish away which
prefigured him when he was absent. Whereas the Lord suffered the eunuch
to come to Jerusalem before he sent him a teacher, it is to be thought
that it was done for this cause, because it was profitable that he
should yet be framed by the rudiments of the law, that he might be made
more apt afterward to receive the doctrine of the gospel. And whereas
God sent none of the apostles unto him  <span
id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541.md) at Jerusalem, the cause lieth hid in
his secret counsel, unless, peradventure, it were done that he might
make more account of the gospel, as of some treasure found suddenly, and
offered unto him contrary to hope; or because it was better that Christ
should be set before him, after that being separated and withdrawn from
the external pomp of ceremonies and the beholding of the temple, he
sought the way of salvation quietly at such time as he was at rest.
 <span id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542.md)

<span id="xv.v-p28"></span><span id="xv.v-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xv.v-p29"></span>**28.** *He read Esaias.* The reading of the
prophet showeth that the eunuch did not worship a God unadvisedly,
according to the understanding of his own head, whom he had reigned to
himself, but whom he knew by the doctrine of the law. And surely this is
the right way to worship God, not to snatch at bare and vain rites, but
to adjoin the word thereunto, otherwise there shall be nothing but that
which cometh by chance and is confused. And certainly the form of
worshipping prescribed in the law differeth nothing from the inventions
of men, save only because God giveth light there by his word. Therefore,
those which are God’s scholars do worship aright only, that is, those
who are taught in his school. But he seemeth to lose his labor when he
readeth without profit. For he confesseth that he cannot understand the
prophet’s meaning, unless he be helped by some other teacher. I answer,
as he read the prophet with a desire to learn, so he hoped for some
fruit, and he found it indeed. Therefore, why doth he deny that he can
understand the place which he had in hand? For because  <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md) he manifestly confesseth his ignorance
in darker places. There be many things in Isaiah which need no long
exposition, as when he preacheth of the goodness and power of God,
partly that he may invite men unto faith, partly that he may exhort and
teach them to lead a godly life. Therefore, no man shall be so rude an
idiot  <span id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md) which shall not profit
somewhat by reading that book, and yet, notwithstanding, he shall,
peradventure, scarce understand every tenth verse. Such was the eunuch’s
reading. For seeing that, according to his capacity, he gathered those
things which served to edification, he had some certain profit by his
studies. Nevertheless, though he were ignorant of many things,  <span
id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md) yet was he not wearied, so that he did
cast away the book. Thus must we also read the Scriptures. We must
greedily, and with a prompt mind, receive those things which are plain,
and wherein God openeth his mind. As for those things which are hid from
us, we must pass them over until we see greater light. And if we be not
wearied with reading, it shall at length come to pass that the Scripture
shall be made more familiar by continual use.

<span id="xv.v-p33"></span><span id="xv.v-p33.1"></span>

<span id="xv.v-p34"></span>**31.** *How should I?* Most excellent
modesty of the eunuch, who doth not only permit Philip who was one of
the common sort, to question with him, but doth also willingly  <span
id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) confess his ignorance. And surely we
must never hope that he will ever show himself apt to be taught who is
puffed up with the confidence of his own wit. Hereby it eometh to pass
that the reading of the Scriptures doth profit so few at this day,
because we can scarce find one amongst a hundred who submitteth himself
willingly to learn. For whilst all men almost are ashamed to be ignorant
of that whereof they are ignorant, every man had rather proudly nourish
his ignorance than seem to be scholar to other men. Yea, a great many
take upon them haughtily to teach other men. Nevertheless, let us
remember that the eunuch did so confess his ignorance, that yet,
notwithstanding, he was one of God’s scholars when he read the
Scripture. This is the true reverence of the Scripture, when as we
acknowledge that there is that wisdom laid up there which surpasseth
 <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md) all our senses; and yet
notwithstanding, we do not loathe it, but, reading diligently, we depend
upon the revelation of the Spirit, and desire to have an interpreter
given us.

<span id="xv.v-p37"></span>*He prayed Philip that he would come up.*
This is another token of modesty, that he seeketh an interpreter and
teacher. He might have rejected Philip according to the pride of rich
men; for it was a certain secret upbraiding of ignorance when Philip
said, *Understandest thou what thou readest?* But rich men think that
they have great injury done them if any man speak homely to them. And,
therefore, they break out by and by into these speeches, What is that to
thee? or, What hast thou to do with me? But the eunuch submitteth
himself humbly to Philip that by him he may be taught. Thus must we be
minded if we desire to have God to be our teacher, whose Spirit resteth
upon the humble and meek, (<span id="xv.v-p37.1"></span>[Isa
66:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002)<span id="xv.v-p37.1"></span>..md)
And if any man, mistrusting himself, submit himself to be taught, the
angels shall rather come down from heaven  <span
id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) than the Lord will suffer us to labor
in vain; though (as did the eunuch) we must use all helps, which the
Lord offereth unto us, for the understanding of the Scriptures. Frantic
men require inspirations and revelations  <span
id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) from heaven, and, in the mean season,
they contemn the minister of God, by whose hand they ought to be
governed. Other some, which trust too much to their own wit, will
vouchsafe to hear no man, and they will read no commentaries. But God
will not have us to despise those helps which he offereth unto us, and
he suffereth not those to escape scot free which despise the same. And
here we must remember, that the Scripture is not only given us, but that
interpreters and teachers are also added, to be helps to us. For this
cause the Lord sent rather Philip than an angel to the eunuch. For to
what end served this circuit, that God calleth Philip by the voice of
the angel, and sendeth not the angel himself forthwith, save only
because he would accustom us to hear men? This is, assuredly, no small
commendation of external preaching, that the voice of God soundeth in
the mouth of men to our salvation, when angels hold their peace.
Concerning which thing, I will speak more upon the ninth and tenth
chapters.
