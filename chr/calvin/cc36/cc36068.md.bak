<span id="xv.ii-p1"></span><span id="xv.ii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
8:5-13](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#005.md)<span id="xv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p2"></span>**5.** And when Philip came into the city of
Samaria, he preached Christ to them. **6.** And the multitude gave ear
to those things which Philip spake, hearing with one consent, and seeing
the signs which he showed. **7.** For whereas many were possessed with
unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice; and many that
had the palsy, and which were lame, were healed; **8.** So that there
was great joy in that city. **9.** And a man, named Simon, had been
before in the city, exercising the art magic, and bewitching the people
of Samaria, saying that he was some great man: **10.** To whom they all
gave heed, both small and great, saying, This man is the great power of
God. **11.** And they had given heed unto him, because they had been
bewitched long time with his witchcraft. **12.** But as soon as they
believed Philip preaching concerning the kingdom of God, and in the name
of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. **13.** And
Simon himself believed, and being baptized, did cleave to Philip; and
when he saw the signs and great powers which were done, he wondered.

<span id="xv.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xv.ii-p4"></span><span id="xv.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p5"></span>**5.** Luke said that they all preached the
Word of God, now he maketh mention of Philip alone, both because his
preaching was more fruitful and effectual than the preaching of the
rest, and also because there followed notable histories, which he will
add afterward. He put the *city of Samaria* for the *city Samaria* which
was laid waste by Hyrcanus, and built again by Herod, and called
Sebaste. Read Josephus, in his Thirteenth and Fifteenth Books of
Antiquities. When he saith that Philip *preached Christ,* he signifieth
that the whole sum of the gospel is contained in Christ. The other
speech which he useth shortly after is more perfect; yet it all one in
effect. He joineth the kingdom of God and the name of Christ together;
but because we obtain this goodness through Christ, to have God to reign
in us, and to lead an heavenly life, being renewed into spiritual
righteousness, and dead to the world, therefore the preaching of Christ
containeth this point also under it. But the sum is this, that Christ
doth repair with his grace the world, being destroyed; which cometh to
pass when he reconcileth us to the Father. Secondly, when he
regenerateth us by his Spirit, that the kingdom of God may be erected in
us when Satan is put to flight. Moreover, whereas he declared before,
that the apostles did not stir one foot from Jerusalem, it is to be
thought that he speaketh of one of the seven deacons in this place,
whose daughters did also prophesy.

<span id="xv.ii-p6"></span><span id="xv.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p7"></span>**6.** *And the multitude gave ear.* Luke
declareth how the Samaritans did embrace Philip’s doctrine. For he saith
that they heard, whereby they took some taste; there was also another
prick whereby they were pricked forward, and that was miracles; at
length there followed attentiveness. This is the right going forward
unto faith; for those which refuse that doctrine which they have not
heard, how is it possible that they should ever come unto faith, which
cometh by hearing? (<span id="xv.ii-p7.1"></span>[Ro
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014)<span id="xv.ii-p7.1"></span>..md)
Therefore, whereas they were ready to hear, that was the first step unto
reverence and attentiveness. And therefore it is no marvel if faith be
so rare, and almost none in the world; for how many be there which
vouchsafe to hearken when God speaketh? whereby it cometh to pass that
the more part rejecteth the truth before they know the same, and have
not so much as lightly tasted it. And as hearing is the beginning of
faith, so it should not be sufficient of itself, unless the majesty of
doctrine should also move the hearts. And surely, whosoever considereth
that he hath to do with God, cannot hear him contemptuously when he
speaketh; and the very doctrine which is contained in his word shall
purchase authority for itself, so that attentiveness shall flow of
itself from hearing. As touching miracles we know that there is a double
use thereof; they serve to prepare us to hear the gospel, and to confirm
us in the faith thereof. The adverb, *with one accord*, may be joined as
well with hearing as with attentiveness. This latter doth like me
better, that they were attentive with one accord; and therein doth Luke
commend the force and efficacy of Philip’s preaching, because a great
number of men was suddenly won to hear attentively with one consent.

<span id="xv.ii-p8"></span><span id="xv.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p9"></span>**7.** *Unclean spirits.* He toucheth certain
kinds briefly, that we may know with what miracles they  <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) were brought to attribute any
authority to Philip. That crying wherewith the unclean spirits cried was
a token of resistance. Wherefore this served not a little to set forth
the power of Christ, that he did bind the devils with his commandment,
though they resisted stubbornly.

<span id="xv.ii-p11"></span><span id="xv.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p12"></span>**8.** *The joy* whereof he speaketh is a
fruit of faith. For it cannot be but that so soon as we know that God
will be favorable and merciful our minds shall be wrapt with
incomparable joy, and such as doth far pass all understanding, (<span
id="xv.ii-p12.1"></span>[Php 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007.md)<span
id="xv.ii-p12.1"></span>.)

<span id="xv.ii-p13"></span><span id="xv.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p14"></span>**9.** *A certain man named Simon.* This was
such a let that it might seem that the gospel could have no passage to
come unto the Samaritans; for the minds of them all were bewitched with
Simon’s jugglings. And this amazedness was grown to some strength by
reason of long space of time. Furthermore experience teacheth what a
hard matter it is to pluck that error out of the minds of men which hath
taken root through long continuance and to call them back unto a sound
and right mind who are already hardened. Superstition made them more
obstinate in their error, because they counted Simon not only as a
prophet of God, but even as the Spirit of God.

<span id="xv.ii-p15"></span><span id="xv.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p16"></span>**10.** For the surname, *great power*,
tendeth to this end, that whatsoever should otherwise be divine might
wax vile through this greatness. Therefore the power of Christ appeareth
hereby more plainly, in that Philip brake through these lets; which
thing Luke amplifieth,

<span id="xv.ii-p17"></span><span id="xv.ii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p18"></span>**11.** When he saith that *they were
astonied*, from the least to the greatest. For seeing all men, of what
estate soever they were, were deluded, what entrance could the gospel
have, especially since it was no mean seducing? for all their senses
were besotted. And besides that we see thereby how mighty the truth is,
there is also set before us an example of constancy in Philip, who,
though he saw no way, yet doth he set hand to the Lord’s work with a
valiant courage, waiting for the success which God should give. And thus
must we do, we must valiantly attempt whatsoever the Lord commandeth,
even when our endeavors seem to be vain. Furthermore, whereas Satan did
bewitch the Samaritans, let us know that it is the common punishment of
infidelity. All men are not bewitched, indeed, with the jugglings of
enchanters, neither are there Simons everywhere, which can so seduce and
deceive; but my meaning is, that it is no wonder,  <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) if Satan do mock men diversely in the
dark; for they are subject to all errors whosoever are not governed by
the Spirit of God. Furthermore, when Luke saith that they were all
seduced one with another, we are taught that neither wit, neither all
that reason and wisdom which we have, are sufficient to avoid the
craftiness of Satan withal. And surely we see in what foolish and doting
errors they were entangled, who were counted in the world wiser than
others.

<span id="xv.ii-p20"></span>*The great power of God.* Therefore Satan
abused the name of God to deceive, which is the most pestilent kind of
deceiving, so far is it from being any excuse. It hath been said before,
that Simon did take to himself the name of the principal power of God,
that he might suppress and surpass whatsoever was elsewhere divine, as
the sun darkeneth all the stars with his light. This was wicked and
ungodly profaning of the name of God. But we read of nothing which was
done here, which is not done as yet daily; for men are bent to nothing
more than to translate that to Satan which is proper to God. They
pretend religion; but what did this pretense help the Samaritans?
Therefore it goeth well with us when God setteth forth to us his power
in Christ, and declareth therewith that we must not seek the same
anywhere else, and doth discover the sleights and juggling casts of
Satan, which we must avoid, to the end he may keep us still in himself.

<span id="xv.ii-p21"></span><span id="xv.ii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p22"></span>**12.** *When they had believed.* That is
the miracle whereof I spake because they heard Philip, who were
altogether made astonied with the illusions of Simon; in that they were
made partakers of the heavenly wisdom who were blockish and dull. So
that they were, after a sort, brought from hell to heaven. Whereas
baptism followed faith, it agreeth with Christ’s institution, as
concerning strangers, (<span id="xv.ii-p22.1"></span>[Mark
16:47](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#047.md)<span id="xv.ii-p22.1"></span>
\[*sic*\],) and those which were without. For it was meet that they
should be engrafted into the body of the Church before they should
receive the sign; but the Anabaptists are too foolish, whilst they
endeavor to prove by these places that infants are not to be baptized.
Men and women could not be baptized without making confession of their
faith; but they were admitted unto baptism upon this condition, that
their families might  <span id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md) be
consecrated to God; for the covenant goeth thus:

<span id="xv.ii-p24"></span>“I will be thy God, and the God of thy
seed,”  
(<span id="xv.ii-p24.2"></span>[Ge
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007)<span id="xv.ii-p24.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xv.ii-p25"></span><span id="xv.ii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p26"></span>**13.** *Simon also himself.* He which had
besotted the whole city with his witchery receiveth the truth together
with others. He which had boasted himself to be the principal power of
God submitteth himself to God, \[Christ; \] though he were brought to
the knowledge of the gospel, not so much for his own sake alone, as for
the whole country’s sake, that that offense might be taken out of the
way which might have hindered the unskillful. And to this end tendeth
that which Luke setteth down afterward, that he wondered at the signs.
For God meant to triumph over this man, whom the Samaritans counted a
petit God;  <span id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) which cometh to pass
whilst he is enforced to give glory to the true miracles, after that his
vain boasting is taken away. And yet he giveth not himself over
sincerely to Christ; for then his ambition, and that wicked and profane
account which he made of the gifts of God, should not break out. And yet
I am not of their mind who think that he made only a semblance of faith,
seeing he did not believe. Luke saith plainly that he believed, and the
reason is added, Because he was touched with wondering. How, then, doth
he shortly after betray himself to be but a hypocrite? I answer, That
there is some mean between faith and mere dissimulation. The Epicures
\[Epicureans\] and Lucianists do profess that they believe, whereas
notwithstanding they laugh inwardly, whereas the hope of eternal life is
unto them a vain thing; finally, whereas they have no more godliness
than dogs or swine.

<span id="xv.ii-p28"></span>But there be many who howsoever they be not
regenerate with the Spirit of adoption, and do not addict themselves
unto God with the true affection of the heart, being overcome with the
power of the Word, do not only confess that that is true which is
taught, but are also touched with some fear of God, so that they receive
doctrine; for they conceive that God must be heard; that he is both the
author and also the judge of the world. Therefore, they make no
semblance of faith before men, which is none, but they think that they
believe. And this faith continueth only for a time, whereof Christ
speaketh in Mark, (<span id="xv.ii-p28.1"></span>[Mr
4](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#000.md)<span id="xv.ii-p28.1"></span>; <span
id="xv.ii-p28.2"></span>[Lu 8:13](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#013.md)<span
id="xv.ii-p28.2"></span>;) to wit, when the seed of the Word conceived
in the mind is, notwithstanding, choked forthwith with divers cares of
the world, or with wicked affections, so that it never cometh to any
ripeness; yea, rather, it groweth out of kind unto unprofitable corn
nothing worth. Such, therefore, was Simon’s faith; he perceiveth that
the doctrine of the gospel is true, and he is enforced to receive the
same with the feeling of his conscience; but the groundwork is wanting;
that is, the denial of himself. Whereupon it followed that his mind was
enwrapped in dissimulation, which he uttereth forthwith. But let us know
that his hypocrisy was such as he deceived himself in; and not that
gross hypocrisy whereof Epicures and such like make boast;  <span
id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) because they dare not confess the
contempt of God.

<span id="xv.ii-p30"></span>*He was baptized*. It appeareth plainly, by
this example of Simon that all men have not that grace given them in
baptism, which grace is there figured. The opinion of the Papists is
this, That unless mortal sin be the cause of let,  <span
id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) all men receive the truth and effect
with the signs. So that they attribute unto the sacraments magical
force, as if they did profit without faith, But let us know that the
Lord offereth to us by the sacraments, whatsoever the annexed promises
do sound;  <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) and that they are not
offered in vain, so that  <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) being
directed unto Christ by faith, we set \[seek\] from him whatsoever the
sacraments do promise. And although the receiving of baptism did profit
him nothing then, yet if conversion followed afterward, as some men
suppose, the profit was not extinguished nor abolished. For it cometh to
pass oftentimes that the Spirit of God worketh afterward after a long
time, that the sacraments may begin to show forth their force.  <span
id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md)

<span id="xv.ii-p35"></span>*Did cleave to Philip*. Whereas Philip
admitted him into his company, it appeareth thereby how hard a matter it
is to know hypocrites. And this is a trial of our patience. So Demas was
a companion of Paul for a time; afterward he became an unfaithful revolt
 <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) (<span
id="xv.ii-p36.2"></span>[2Ti 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010.md)<span
id="xv.ii-p36.2"></span>,) Finally, we cannot escape this evil, but that
wicked men and deceitful will sometimes join themselves unto us; and if
at any time the wicked creep craftily into our company, proud censors
burden us unjustly, as if we were to answer for their misdeeds. Though
we must take heed of facility, which causeth the gospel to be slandered
oftentimes, and we must be so much the more vigilant, that we admit none
without great choice, forasmuch as we hear that great men have been
deceived. He saith that he was made astonied with the greatness of the
signs; that we may know that that great power, whereof he boasted, was
nothing else but juggling and smokes. And Luke speaketh not in this
place of any plain wondering, but of a damp or trance which causeth a
man to forget what he doth.  <span id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md)
