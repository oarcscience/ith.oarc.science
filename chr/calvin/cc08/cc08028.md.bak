<span id="xxix"></span>

<span id="xxix-p1"></span>PSALM 23.

<span id="xxix-p2"></span>This psalm is neither intermingled with
prayers, nor does it complain of miseries for the purpose of obtaining
relief; but it contains simply a thanksgiving, from which it appears
that it was composed when David had obtained peaceable possession of the
kingdom, and lived in prosperity, and in the enjoyment of all he could
desire. That he might not, therefore, in the time of his great
prosperity, be like worldly men, who, when they seem to themselves to be
fortunate,  <span id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) bury God in
forgetfulness, and luxuriously plunge themselves into their pleasures,
he delights himself in God, the author of all the blessings which he
enjoyed. And he not only acknowledges that the state of tranquillity in
which he now lives, and his exemption from all inconveniences and
troubles, is owing to the goodness of God; but he also trusts that
through his providence he will continue happy even to the close of his
life, and for this end that he may employ himself in his pure worship.

<span id="xxix-p4"></span>A Psalm of David.

<span id="xxix.i"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p1"></span><span id="xxix.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
23:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#001.md)<span id="xxix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p2"></span>**1.** Jehovah is my shepherd, I shall not
want.  <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) **2.** He maketh me to
lie down in pastures of grass; he leadeth me to gently flowing waters.
 <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) **3.** He restoreth my soul; he
leadeth me by the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. **4.**
Though I should walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear
no evil: for thou art with me; thy staff and thy crook comfort me.

<span id="xxix.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxix.i-p6"></span><span id="xxix.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p7"></span>**1.** *Jehovah is my shepherd.* Although
God, by his benefits, gently allures us to himself, as it were by a
taste of his fatherly sweetness, yet there is nothing into which we more
easily fall than into a forgetfulness of him, when we are in the
enjoyment of peace and comfort. Yea, prosperity not only so intoxicates
many, as to carry them beyond all bounds in their mirth, but it also
engenders insolence, which makes them proudly rise up and break forth
against God. Accordingly, there is scarcely a hundredth part of those
who enjoy in abundance the good things of God, who keep themselves in
his fear, and live in the exercise of humility and temperance, which
would be so becoming.  <span id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) For this
reason, we ought the more carefully to mark the example which is here
set before us by David, who, elevated to the dignity of sovereign power,
surrounded with the splendor of riches and honors, possessed of the
greatest abundance of temporal good things, and in the midst of princely
pleasures, not only testifies that he is mindful of God, but calling to
remembrance the benefits which God had conferred upon him,  <span
id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) makes them ladders by which he may
ascend nearer to Him. By this means he not only bridles the wantonness
of his flesh, but also excites himself with the greater earnestness to
gratitude, and the other exercises of godliness, as appears from the
concluding sentence of the psalm, where he says, “I shall dwell in the
house of Jehovah for a length of days.” In like manner, in the 18th
psalm, which was composed at a period of his life when he was applauded
on every side, by calling himself the servant of God, he showed the
humility and simplicity of heart to which he had attained, and, at the
same time, openly testified his gratitude, by applying himself to the
celebration of the praises of God.

<span id="xxix.i-p10"></span>Under the similitude of a shepherd, he
commends the care which God, in his providence, had exercised towards
him. His language implies that God had no less care of him than a
shepherd has of the sheep who are committed to his charge. God, in the
Scripture, frequently takes to himself the name, and puts on the
character of a shepherd, and this is no mean token of his tender love
towards us. As this is a lowly and homely manner of speaking, He who
does not disdain to stoop so low for our sake, must bear a singularly
strong affection towards us. It is therefore wonderful, that when he
invites us to himself with such gentleness and familiarity, we are not
drawn or allured to him, that we may rest in safety and peace under his
guardianship. But it should be observed, that God is a shepherd only to
those who, touched with a sense of their own weakness and poverty, feel
their need of his protection, and who willingly abide in his sheepfold,
and surrender themselves to be governed by him. David, who excelled both
in power and riches, nevertheless frankly confessed himself to be a poor
sheep, that he might have God for his shepherd. Who is there, then,
amongst us, who would exempt himself from this necessity, seeing our own
weakness sufficiently shows that we are more than miserable if we do not
live under the protection of this shepherd? We ought to bear in mind,
that our happiness consists in this, that his hand is stretched forth to
govern us, that we live under his shadow, and that his providence keeps
watch and ward over our welfare. Although, therefore, we have abundance
of all temporal good things, yet let us be assured that we cannot be
truly happy unless God vouchsafe to reckon us among the number of his
flock. Besides, we then only attribute to God the office of a Shepherd
with due and rightful honor, when we are persuaded that his providence
alone is sufficient to supply all our necessities.  <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md) As those who enjoy the greatest
abundance of outward good things are empty and famished if God is not
their shepherd; so it is beyond all doubt that those whom he has taken
under his charge shall not want a full abundance of all good things.
David, therefore, declares that he is not afraid of wanting any thing,
because God is his Shepherd.

<span id="xxix.i-p12"></span><span id="xxix.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p13"></span>**2.** *He maketh me to lie down in
pastures of grass.* With respect to the words, it is in the Hebrew,
*pastures,* or *fields of grass,* for *grassy and rich grounds.* Some,
instead of translating the word <span id="xxix.i-p13.1"></span>נאות,
*neoth,* which we have rendered *pastures,* render it *shepherds’ cots*
or *lodges.* If this translation is considered preferable, the meaning
of the Psalmist will be, that sheep-cots were prepared in rich pasture
grounds, under which he might be protected from the heat of the sun. If
even in cold countries the immoderate heat which sometimes occurs is
troublesome to a flock of sheep, how could they bear the heat of the
summer in Judea, a warm region, without sheepfolds? The verb <span
id="xxix.i-p13.2"></span>רבף, *rabats, to lie down,* or *repose,* seems
to have a reference to the same thing. David has used the phrase, *the
quiet waters,* to express gently flowing waters; for rapid streams are
inconvenient for sheep to drink in, and are also for the most part
hurtful. In this verse, and in the verses following, he explains the
last clause of the first verse, *I shall not want.* He relates how
abundantly God had provided for all his necessities, and he does this
without departing from the comparison which he employed at the
commencement. The amount of what is stated is, that the heavenly
Shepherd had omitted nothing which might contribute to make him live
happily under his care. He, therefore, compares the great abundance of
all things requisite for the purposes of the present life which he
enjoyed, to meadows richly covered with grass, and to gently flowing
streams of water; or he compares the benefit or advantage of such things
to sheep-cots; for it would not have been enough to have been fed and
satisfied in rich pasture, had there not also been provided waters to
drink, and the shadow of the sheep-cot to cool and refresh him.

<span id="xxix.i-p14"></span><span id="xxix.i-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p15"></span>**3.** *He restoreth my soul* As it is the
duty of a good shepherd to cherish his sheep, and when they are diseased
or weak to nurse and support them, David declares that this was the
manner in which he was treated by God. *The restoring of the soul,* as
we have translated it, or *the conversion of the soul,* as it is,
literally rendered, is of the same import as *to make anew,* or *to
recover,* as has been already stated in the 19th psalm, at the seventh
verse. By *the paths of righteousness,* he means easy and plain paths.
 <span id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) As he still continues his
metaphor, it would be out of place to understand this as referring to
the direction of the Holy Spirit. He has stated a little before that God
liberally supplies him with all that is requisite for the maintenance of
the present life, and now he adds, that he is defended by him from all
trouble. The amount of what is said is, that God is in no respect
wanting to his people, seeing he sustains them by his power, invigorates
and quickens them, and averts from them whatever is hurtful, that they
may walk at ease in plain and straight paths. That, however, he may not
ascribe any thing to his own worth or merit, David represents the
goodness of God as the cause of so great liberality, declaring that God
bestows all these things upon him *for his own name’s sake.* And
certainly his choosing us to be his sheep, and his performing towards us
all the offices of a shepherd, is a blessing which proceeds entirely
from his free and sovereign goodness, as we shall see in the sixty-fifth
psalm.

<span id="xxix.i-p17"></span><span id="xxix.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p18"></span>**4.** *Though I should walk.* True
believers, although they dwell safely under the protection of God, are,
notwithstanding, exposed to many dangers, or rather they are liable to
all the afflictions which befall mankind in common, that they may the
better feel how much they need the protection of God. David, therefore,
here expressly declares, that if any adversity should befall him, he
would lean upon the providence of God. Thus he does not promise himself
continual pleasures; but he fortifies himself by the help of God
courageously to endure the various calamities with which he might be
visited. Pursuing his metaphor, he compares the care which God takes in
governing true believers to a shepherd’s staff and crook, declaring that
he is satisfied with this as all-sufficient for the protection of his
life. As a sheep, when it wanders up and down through a dark valley, is
preserved safe from the attacks of wild beasts and from harm in other
ways, by the presence of the shepherd alone, so David now declares that
as often as he shall be exposed to any danger, he will have sufficient
defense and protection in being under the pastoral care of God.

<span id="xxix.i-p19"></span>We thus see how, in his prosperity, he
never forgot that he was a man, but even then seasonably meditated on
the adversities which afterwards might come upon him. And certainly, the
reason why we are so terrified, when it pleases God to exercise us with
the cross, is, because every man, that he may sleep soundly and
undisturbed, wraps himself up in carnal security. But there is a great
difference between this sleep of stupidity and the repose which faith
produces. Since God tries faith by adversity, it follows that no one
truly confides in God, but he who is armed with invincible constancy for
resisting all the fears with which he may be assailed.  <span
id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) Yet David did not mean to say that he
was devoid of all fear, but only that he would surmount it so as to go
without fear wherever his shepherd should lead him. This appears more
clearly from the context. He says, in the first place, *I will fear no
evil;* but immediately adding the reason of this, he openly acknowledges
that he seeks a remedy against his fear in contemplating, and having his
eyes fixed on, the staff of his shepherd: *For thy staff and thy crook
comfort me.* What need would he have had of that consolation, if he had
not been disquieted and agitated with fear? It ought, therefore, to be
kept in mind, that when David reflected on the adversities which might
befall him, he became victorious over fear and temptations, in no other
way than by casting himself on the protection of God. This he had also
stated before, although a little more obscurely, in these words, *For
thou art with me.* This implies that he had been afflicted with fear.
Had not this been the case, for what purpose could he desire the
presence of God?  <span id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535.md) Besides, it is
not against the common and ordinary calamities of life only that he
opposes the protection of God, but against those which distract and
confound the minds of men with the darkness of death. For the Jewish
grammarians think that <span id="xxix.i-p21.2"></span>צלמות,
*tsalmaveth,* which we have translated *the shadow of death,* is a
compound word, as if one should say *deadly shade.*  <span
id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536.md) David here makes an allusion to the
dark recesses or dens of wild beasts, to which when an individual
approaches he is suddenly seized at his first entrance with an
apprehension and fear of death. Now, since God, in the person of his
only begotten Son, has exhibited himself to us as our shepherd, much
more clearly than he did in old time to the fathers who lived under the
Law, we do not render sufficient honor to his protecting care, if we do
not lift our eyes to behold it, and keeping them fixed upon it, tread
all fears and terrors under our feet.  <span
id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537.md)

<span id="xxix.ii"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005.md)<span id="xxix.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p2"></span>**5.** Thou wilt prepare a table before me
in the presence of my persecutors: thou wilt anoint my head with oil; my
cup overflows. **6.** Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the
days of my life; and I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for a length
of days.

<span id="xxix.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxix.ii-p4"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p5"></span>**5.** *Thou wilt prepare.* These words,
which are put in the future tense, here denote a continued act. David,
therefore, now repeats, without a figure, what he has hitherto declared,
concerning the beneficence of God, under the similitude of a shepherd.
He tells us that by his liberality he is supplied with all that is
necessary for the maintenance of this life. When he says, *Thou
preparest a table before me,* he means that God furnished him with
sustenance without trouble or difficulty on his part, just as if a
father should stretch forth his hand to give food to his child. He
enhances this benefit from the additional consideration, that although
many malicious persons envy his happiness, and desire his ruin, yea,
endeavor to defraud him of the blessing of God; yet God does not desist
from showing himself liberal towards him, and from doing him good. What
he subjoins concerning *oil,* has a reference to a custom which then
prevailed. We know that in old time, ointments were used at the more
magnificent feasts, and no man thought he had honourably received his
guests if he had not perfumed them therewith. Now, this exuberant store
of *oil,* and also this overflowing *cup,* ought to be explained as
denoting the abundance which goes beyond the mere supply of the common
necessaries of life; for it is spoken in commendation of the royal
wealth with which, as the sacred historian records, David had been amply
furnished. All men, it is true, are not treated with the same liberality
with which David was treated; but there is not an individual who is not
under obligation to God by the benefits which God has conferred upon
him, so that we are constrained to acknowledge that he is a kind and
liberal Father to all his people. In the meantime, let each of us stir
up himself to gratitude to God for his benefits, and the more abundantly
these have been bestowed upon us, our gratitude ought to be the greater.
If he is ungrateful who, having only a coarse loaf, does not acknowledge
in that the fatherly providence of God, how much less can the stupidity
of those be tolerated, who glut themselves with the great abundance of
the good things of God which they possess, without having any sense or
taste of his goodness towards them? David, therefore, by his own
example, admonishes the rich of their duty, that they may be the more
ardent in the expression of their gratitude to God, the more delicately
he feeds them. Farther, let us remember, that those who have greater
abundance than others are bound to observe moderation not less than if
they had only as much of the good things of this life as would serve for
their limited and temperate enjoyment. We are too much inclined by
nature to excess; and, therefore, when God is, in respect of worldly
things, bountiful to his people, it is not to stir up and nourish in
them this disease. All men ought to attend to the rule of Paul, which is
laid down in <span id="xxix.ii-p5.1"></span>[Php
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012.md)<span id="xxix.ii-p5.1"></span>,
that they “may know both how to be abased, and how to abound.” That want
may not sink us into despondency, we need to be sustained by patient
endurance; and, on the other hand, that too great abundance may not
elate us above measure, we need to be restrained by the bridle of
temperance. Accordingly, the Lord, when he enriches his own people,
restrains, at the same time, the licentious desires of the flesh by the
spirit of confidence, so that, of their own accord, they prescribe to
themselves rules of temperance. Not that it is unlawful for rich men to
enjoy more freely the abundance which they possess than if God had given
them a smaller portion; but all men ought to beware, (and much more
kings,) lest they should be dissolved in voluptuous pleasures. David, no
doubt, as was perfectly lawful, allowed himself larger scope than if he
had been only one of the common people, or than if he had still dwelt in
his father’s cottage, but he so regulated himself in the midst of his
delicacies, as not at all to take pleasure in stuffing and fattening the
body. He knew well how to distinguish between the table which God had
prepared for him and a trough for swine. It is also worthy of particular
notice, that although David lived upon his own lands, the tribute money
and other revenues of the kingdom, he gave thanks to God just as if God
had daily given him his food with his own hand. From this we conclude
that he was not blinded with his riches, but always looked upon God as
his householder, who brought forth meat and drink from his own store,
and distributed it to him at the proper season.

<span id="xxix.ii-p6"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p7"></span>**6.** *Surely goodness and mercy.* Having
recounted the blessings which God had bestowed upon him, he now
expresses his undoubted persuasion of the continuance of them to the end
of his life. But whence proceeded this confidence, by which he assures
himself that the beneficence and mercy of God will accompany him for
ever, if it did not arise from the promise by which God is accustomed to
season the blessings which he bestows upon true believers, that they may
not inconsiderately devour them without having any taste or relish for
them? When he said to himself before, that even amidst the darkness of
death he would keep his eyes fixed in beholding the providence of God,
he sufficiently testified that he did not depend upon outward things,
nor measured the grace of God according to the judgment of the flesh,
but that even when assistance from every earthly quarter failed him, his
faith continued shut up in the word of God. Although, therefore,
experience led him to hope well, yet it was principally on the promise
by which God confirms his people with respect to the future that he
depended. If it is objected that it is presumption for a man to promise
himself a continued course of prosperity in this uncertain and changing
world, I answer, that David did not speak in this manner with the view
of imposing on God a law; but he hoped for such exercise of God’s
beneficence towards him as the condition of this world permits, with
which he would be contented. He does not say, My cup shall be always
full, or, My head shall be always perfumed with oil; but in general he
entertains the hope that as the goodness of God never fails, he will be
favorable towards him even to the end.

<span id="xxix.ii-p8"></span>*I will dwell in the house of Jehovah.* By
this concluding sentence he manifestly shows that he does not confine
his thoughts to earthly pleasures or comforts; but that the mark at
which he aims is fixed in heaven, and to reach this was his great object
in all things. It is as if he had said, I do not live for the mere
purpose of living, but rather to exercise myself in the fear and service
of God, and to make progress daily in all the branches of true
godliness. He makes a manifest distinction between himself and ungodly
men, who take pleasure only in filling their bellies with luxuriant
fare. And not only so, but he also intimates that to live to God is, in
his estimation, of so great importance, that he valued all the comforts
of the flesh only in proportion as they served to enable him to live to
God. He plainly affirms, that the end which he contemplated in all the
benefits which God had conferred upon him was, that he might dwell in
the house of the Lord. Whence it follows, that when deprived of the
enjoyment of this blessing, he made no account of all other things; as
if he had said, I would take no pleasure in earthly comforts, unless I
at the same time belonged to the flock of God, as he also writes in
another place,

<span id="xxix.ii-p9"></span>“Happy is that people that is in such a
case: yea, happy is that people whose God is the Lord,” (<span
id="xxix.ii-p9.1"></span>[Ps
144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015.md)<span
id="xxix.ii-p9.1"></span>.)

<span id="xxix.ii-p10"></span>Why did he desire go greatly to frequent
the temple, but to offer sacrifices there along with his
fellow-worshippers, and to improve by the other exercises of religion in
meditation upon the celestial life? It is, therefore, certain that the
mind of David, by the aid of the temporal prosperity which he enjoyed,
was elevated to the hope of the everlasting inheritance. From this we
conclude, that those men are brutish who propose to themselves any other
felicity than that which arises from drawing near to God.

alteration; as otherwise, we have an incongruous mixture of physical and

conducts them near peaceful waters, affords them the means of
refreshment when wearied, and guides them away from r ugged and tortuous
