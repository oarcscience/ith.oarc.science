<span id="xiii-p1"></span>PSALM 7

<span id="xiii-p2"></span>David, loaded with unjust calumny, calls upon
God to be his advocate and defender, and commits his innocence to the
Divine protection. In the first place, he protests that his conscience
did notaccuse him of the wickedness laid to his charge. Secondly, he
shows how greatly it concerns the glory of God that he should execute
judgment against the ungodly. Thirdly, to inspire his mind with
confidence, he seriously reflects upon the goodness and righteousness of
God, and sets before him the divine promises. Lastly, as if he had
obtained the desire of his heart, he derides the folly and the vain
attempts of his enemies; or rather, depending upon the aid of God, he
assures himself that all their endeavours against him shall turn to
their own destruction.

<span id="xiii-p3"></span>Shiggaion of David, which he sung unto
Jehovah,  
upon the words of Cush the Benjamite.

<span id="xiii-p4"></span>With respect to the word *Shiggaion,* the
Jewish interpreters are not agreed. Some understand it to mean a musical
instrument. To others it seems to be a tune to which a song is set.
Others suppose it to have been the beginning of a common song, to the
tune of which David wished this psalm to be sung. Others translate the
Hebrew word, *delight,* or *rejoicing.*  <span
id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) The second opinion appears to me the most
probable, namely, that it was some kind of melody or song, as if one
should term it Sapphic or Phaleucian verse.  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) But I do not contend about a matter of so
small importance. Again, the psalm is said to have been composed upon
the *words of Cush.* I cannot subscribe to the interpretation, (although
it is the commonly received one,) that words here mean *affairs,* or
*business.* To put *word* for a *matter,* or *an affair,* is, I allow, a
common form of speech among the Jews; but as David a little after
declares that he was falsely accused of some crime, I doubt not but he
here speaks of the accusation or calumny itself, of which, as I judge,
Cush, some one of Saul’s kindred, was the author, or, at least, the
instrument who preferred and circulated it. The opinion of some who say
that Saul is here spoken of under a fictitious name, is not supported by
any argument of sufficient weight. According to them, David avoided
calling him by his own name, in order to spare the royal dignity. David,
I admit, had great reverence for the holy anointing; but as he expressly
names Saul in other places where he reprehends him not less severely,
and paints him in colours no less black than he does in this psalm, why
should he suppress his name here, and not in these passages? In my
opinion, therefore, he here expresses by his proper name, and without
figure, a wicked accuser, who had excited hatred against him by falsely
charging him with some crime, and who had either been bribed by the king
to do this, or, currying the royal favour, had calumniated David of his
own accord; for David, we know, was very much slandered, as if he had
been ungrateful and treacherous towards the king, his father-in-law.
Saul, indeed, belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. We do not, however,
think that he is the person here mentioned, but that it was one of
Saul’s relations, one who belonged to the same tribe with him, who
falsely accused David.

<span id="xiii.i"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p1"></span><span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
7:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#001.md)<span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p2"></span>**1**. O Jehovah, my God, in thee do I
trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me. **2**.
Lest he seize upon my soul as a lion, and tear it in pieces, while there
is none to deliver it.

<span id="xiii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xiii.i-p4"></span><span id="xiii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p5"></span>At the commencement of the psalm, David
speaks of having many enemies, and in the second verse he specifies some
one in the singular number. And certainly, since the minds of all men
were inflamed against him, he had very good reason for praying to be
delivered from all his persecutors. But as the wicked cruelty of the
king, like a firebrand, had kindled against him, though an innocent
person, the hatred of the whole people, he had good reason also for
turning his pen particularly against him. Thus, in the first verse, he
describes the true character of his own circumstances—he was a
persecuted man; and, in the second verse, the fountain or cause of the
calamity he was enduring. There is great emphasis in these words which
he uses in the beginning of the Psalms *O Jehovah my Godly in thee do I
trust.* The verb, it is true, is in the past tense in the Hebrew; and,
therefore, if literally translated, the reading would be, *In thee have
I trusted;* but as the Hebrews often take one *tense for* another,
 <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) I prefer to translate it in the
present, *In thee I do trust,* especially since it is abundantly evident
that a continued act, as it is termed, is denoted. David does not boast
of a confidence in God, from which he had now fallen, but of a
confidence which he constantly entertained in his afflictions. And this
is a genuine and an undoubted proof of our faith, when, being visited
with adversity, we, notwithstanding, persevere in cherishing and
exercising hope in God. From this passage, we also learn that the gate
of mercy is shut against our prayers if the key of faith do not open it
for us. Nor does he use superfluous language when he calls Jehovah *his
own God;* for by setting up this as a bulwark before him, he beats back
the waves of temptations, that they may not overwhelm his faith. In the
second verses by the figure of *a lion,* he represents in a stronger
light the cruelty of Saul, as an argument to induce God to grant him
assistance, even as he ascribes it to Him as his peculiar province to
rescue his poor sheep from the jaws of wolves.

<span id="xiii.ii"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
7:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#003.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p2"></span>**3**. O Jehovah, my God, if I have done
this thing, if there be iniquity in my hands: **4** If I have rewarded
evil to him that was at peace with me, and have not delivered him that
persecuted me without cause: **5**. Let the enemy pursue my soul and
take it; and let him throw down my life to the ground,  <span
id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) and hold down  <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) my glory in the dust. Selah.

<span id="xiii.ii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xiii.ii-p6"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p7"></span>**3** *O Jehovah my God* Here David, to
induce God to show him favour, protests that he is molested unjustly,
and without being guilty of any crime. To give his protestation the
greater weight, he uses an imprecation. If he has done any wrong, he
declares his readiness to bear the blame; yea, he offers to endure the
severest punishment, if he is not altogether innocent of the crime of
which all men thought him almost convicted. And by entreating God to
succour him upon no other condition than this, that his integrity should
upon trial be found to be untarnished, he teaches us, by his example,
that as often as we have recourse to God, we must make it our first care
to be well assured in our own consciences with respect to the
righteousness of our cause; for we do him great wrong if we wish to
engage him as the advocate and defender of a bad cause. The pronoun
*this* shows that he speaks of a thing which was generally known; whence
we may conclude, that the slander which had been raised by Cush was
spread far and wide. And as David was condemned, by the false reports
and unrighteous judgments which men advanced against him, and saw no
remedy on earth, he betakes himself to the judgment-seat of God, and
contents himself with maintaining his innocence before the heavenly
Judge; an example which all the godly should imitate, in order that, in
opposition to the slanderous reports which are spread against them, they
may rest satisfied with the judgment of God alone. He next declares more
distinctly, that he had committed no crime. And in the fourth verse, he
mentions two particulars in self-vindication; first, That he had done no
wrong to any one; and, secondly, That he had rather endeavoured to do
good to his enemies, by whom notwithstanding he had been injured without
any just cause. I, therefore, explain the fourth verse thus: If I have
wronged any man that was at peace with me, and have not rather succoured
the unworthy, who persecuted me without a cause, etc. Since David was
hated of almost all men, as if ambition to reign had impelled him
perfidiously to rise up in rebellion against Saul, and to lay snares for
the monarch to whom he was bound by the oath of allegiances  <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) in the first part of the verse, he
clears himself of such a foul slander. The reason, perhaps, why he calls
Saul *him that was at peace with him* is, that on account of his royal
dignity his person ought to be sacred, and secure from danger,  <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) so that it should be unlawful to make
any hostile attempt against him. This phrase, however, may be understood
generally, as if he had said, No one who has meekly restrained himself
from injuring me, and has conducted himself kindly towards me, can with
truth complain that I have ever injured him in a single instance. And
yet it was the general persuasion, that David, in the midst of peace,
had stirred up great confusion, and caused war. From this it is just so
much the more manifest, that David, provided he enjoyed the approbation
of God, was contented with the consolation arising from this, though he
should have comfort from no other source.

<span id="xiii.ii-p10"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p11"></span>In the second clause of the fourth verse,
he proceeds farther, and states, that he had been a friend, not only to
the good, but also to the bad, and had not only restrained himself from
all revenge, but had even succoured his enemies, by whom he had been
deeply and cruelly injured. It would certainly not be very illustrious
virtue to love the good and peaceable, unless there were joined to this
self-government and gentleness in patiently bearing with the bad. But
when a man not only keeps himself from revenging the injuries which he
has received, but endeavours to overcome evil by doing good, he
manifests one of the graces of a renewed and sanctified nature, and in
this way proves himself to be one of the children of God; for such
meekness proceeds only from the Spirit of adoption. With respect to the
words: as the Hebrew word <span id="xiii.ii-p11.1"></span>חלץ *chalats,*
which I have translated *to delivers* signifies *to divide* and *to
separate,* some, to prevent the necessity of supplying any word to make
out the sense,  <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) thus explain the
passage, *If I have withdrawn myself from my persecutors, in order not
to succour them.* The other interpretation, however, according to which
the verb is rendered *to deliver* or *rescue from* danger, is more
generally received; because the phrase, *to separate* or *set aside,* is
applied to those things which we wish to place in safety. And thus the
negative word *not* must be supplied, an omission which we will find not
unfrequently occurring in The Psalms.

<span id="xiii.ii-p13"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p14"></span>**5** *Let mine enemy pursue* It is a
striking proof of the great confidence which David had in his own
integrity, when he is willing to endure any kind of punishment, however
dreadful, provided he should be found guilty of any crime. If we could
bring a good conscience like this before God, his hand would be more
quickly stretched forth to afford us immediate assistance. But as it
often happens that those who molest us have been provoked by us, or that
we burn with the desire of revenge when offended, we are unworthy of
receiving succour from God; yea, our own impatience shuts the gate
against our prayers. In the first place, David is prepared to be given
over to the will of his enemies, that they may *seize his life, and
throw it down to the ground;* and then to be publicly exhibited as an
object of their mockery, so that, even after he is dead, he may lie
under eternal disgrace. Some think that the <span
id="xiii.ii-p14.1"></span>כבוד *kebod,* which we have translated
*glory,* is here to be taken for *life,* and thus there will be three
words, *soul, life, glory,* signifying the same thing. But it appears to
me, that the meaning of the passage will be fuller if we refer the word
*glory* to his memory, or his good name, as if he had said, Let my enemy
not only destroy me, but, after having put me to death, let him speak of
me in the most reproachful terms, so that my name may be buried in mire
or filth.

<span id="xiii.iii"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
7:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006.md)<span id="xiii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p2"></span>**6**. Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger,
lift up thyself against the rage of mine enemies; and awake thou for me
to the judgment which thou hast ordained.  <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) **7**. And then the assembly of
peoples \[or nations\] shall compass thee about: and on account of this,
return thou on high. **8**. Jehovah shall judge the peoples, \[or
nations:\] judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and
according to the integrity that is in me.

<span id="xiii.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiii.iii-p5"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p6"></span>**6** *Arise, O Jehovah* David here sets
the anger of God in opposition to the rage of his enemies; and when we
are in similar circumstances we should act in the same manner. When the
ungodly are inflamed against us, and cast forth their rage and fury to
destroy us, we ought humbly to beseech God to be inflamed also on his
side; in other words, to show in truth that he has, no less zeal and
power to preserve us, than they have inclination to destroy us. The
word, *Arise,* is taken in a figurative sense, for *to ascend into a
judgment-seat, or* rather *to prepare one’s self to make resistance;*
and it is here applied to God, because, while he delays to succour us,
we are very apt to think him asleep. Accordingly, David also, a little
after, beseeches him *to awake;* for it seemed on the part of God
something like the forgetfulness of sleep to give no assistance to an
individual who was so much afflicted and oppressed on all hands.

<span id="xiii.iii-p7"></span>In the end of the verse he shows that he
asks nothing but what is according to the appointment of God. And this
is the rule which ought to be observed by us in our prayers; we should
in every thing conform our requests to the divine will, as John also
instructs us, (<span id="xiii.iii-p7.1"></span>[1Jo
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014)<span id="xiii.iii-p7.1"></span>..md)
And, indeed, we can never pray in faith unless we attend, in the first
place, to what God commands, that our minds may not rashly and at random
start aside in desiring more than we are permitted to desire and pray
for. David, therefore, in order to pray aright, reposes himself on the
word and prose mise of God; and the import of his exercise is this:
Lord, I am not led by ambition, or foolish headstrong passion, or
depraved desire, inconsiderately to ask from thee whatever is pleasing
to my flesh; but it is the clear light of thy word which directs me, and
upon it I securely depend. Since God, of his own good pleasure, had
called him to be one day king, it belonged to him to defend and maintain
the rights of the man whom he had chosen for his servant. David’s
language, therefore, is the same as if he had said, “When I was well
contented with my humble condition in private life, it was thy pleasure
to set me apart to the honourable station of being a king; now,
therefore, it belongs to thee to maintain this cause against Saul and
his associates who are using their efforts to defeat thy decree in
making war upon me.” The Hebrew word <span
id="xiii.iii-p7.2"></span>עורה, *urah,* which we have rendered *awake
thou,*  <span id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) might also be taken
transitively for to *build up,* or *to establish* the right of David.
The sum of the whole, however, comes to this, that David, trusting to
the call of God, beseeches him to stretch forth his hand for his relief.
The faithful must, therefore, take care not to exceed these bounds, if
they desire to have God present with them to maintain and preserve them.

<span id="xiii.iii-p9"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p10"></span>**7** *And a congregation of peoples*
Some limit this sentence exclusively to the people of Israel, as if
David promised that, as soon as he should ascend the throne, he would
endeavour to reunite together, in the pure worship of God, the people
who before had been as it were in a state of dispersion. Under the reign
of Saul, religion had been neglected, or such an unrestrained license in
wickedness had prevailed, that few paid any regard to God. The meaning,
therefore, according to these expositors, is this: Lord, when thou shalt
have constituted me king, the whole people, who have so basely gone
astray from thee,  <span id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) shall return
from their wanderings and disorderly courses to thee and to thy service,
so that all shall know that thou rulest in the midst of them, and shall
worship thee as their only King. But I am rather inclined to view this
as language which has a respect in common to many nations. David here
speaks in high terms of the effects resulting from his deliverance, the
report of which would be spread far and wide, and his words are, as if
he had said, “Lord, when thou shalt have put me in peaceable possession
of the kingdom, this will not only be a benefit conferred on me
personally, but it will be a common lesson to many nations, teaching
them to acknowledge thy just judgment, so that they shall turn their
eyes to thy judgment-seat.”  <span id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md)
David here alludes to the practice of a people who surround their king,
as in a circle, when he holds a solemn assembly. In the same sense, he
adds immediately after, that God, who, for a time, lay still and kept
silence, would raise himself on high that not only one or two, but whole
nations, might behold his glory: *And on account of this return thou on
high*  <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) There is in these words,
a tacit comparison, that although it might not be necessary to have a
regard to one man alone, it is requisite that God should keep the world
in the fear and reverence of his judgment.

<span id="xiii.iii-p14"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p15"></span>**8** *Jehovah shall judge the nations*
This sentence is closely connected with the preceding verse. David had
prayed God to show himself as judge to the nations; and now he takes it
for a certain and admitted truth, that it is the peculiar office of God
to judge the nations: for the word put in the future tense, and rendered
*shall judge,* denotes here a continued act; and this is the
signification of the future tense in general sentences. Besides, he does
not here speak of one nation only, but comprehends all nations. As he
acknowledges God to be the judge of the whole world, he concludes a
little after from this, that he will maintain his cause and right. And
as often as we seem to be forsaken and oppressed, we should recall this
truth to our remembrance, that as God is the governor of the world, it
is as utterly impossible for him to abdicate his office as to deny
himself. From this source there will flow a continual stream of comfort,
although a long succession of calamities may press upon us: for from
this truth we may assuredly conclude, that he will take care to defend
our innocence. It would be contrary to every principle of just reasoning
to supposes that he who governs many nations neglects even one man. What
happens with respect to the judges of this world can never take place
with respect to him; he cannot, as may be the case with them, be so
occupied about great and public affairs as to neglect, because unable to
attend to them, the concerns of individuals. He again brings into new
*his integrity* that he may not seem, after the example of hypocrites to
make the name of God a mere pretext for the better furthering of his own
purposes. Since God is no respecter of persons, we cannot expect him to
be on our side, and to favour us, if our cause is not good. But it is
asked, how can David here boast of his own integrity before God, when in
other places he deprecates God entering into judgment with him? The
answer is easy, and it is this: The subject here treated of is not how
he could answer if God should demand from him an account of his whole
life; but, comparing himself with his enemies, he maintains and not
without cause, that, in respect of them, he was righteous. But when each
saint passes under the review of God’s judgment, and his own character
is tried upon its own merits, the matter is very different, for then the
only sanctuary to which he can betake himself for safety, is the mercy
of God.

<span id="xiii.iv"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p1"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
7:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009.md)<span id="xiii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p2"></span>**9**. Let the malice of the wicked come to
an end I beseech thee and direct thou the righteous: for God who is
righteous, proves \[or searches\] the hearts and the reins. **10**. My
defense \[or shield\] is in God, who saves the upright in heart. **11**.
God judgeth the righteous, and him who despiseth God, daily.

<span id="xiii.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="xiii.iv-p4"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p5"></span>**9** *Let the malice of the wicked come to
an endow I beseech thee.* David, in the first place, prays that God
would restrain the malice of his enemies, and bring it to an end; from
which it follows, that his affliction had been of long duration. Others
suppose that this is rather a dreadful imprecation, and they explain the
Hebrew word <span id="xiii.iv-p5.1"></span>גמר, *gamar,* somewhat
differently. Instead of rendering it to *cease,* and *to come to an
end,* as I have done, they understand it *to make to cease,* which is
equivalent *to* *destroy* or *to consume.*  <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) Thus, according to them, David wishes
that God would cause the mischief which the wicked devise to fall upon
their own heads: *Let the wickedness of the wicked consume them* But, in
my opinion, the former interpretation is the more simple, namely, that
David beseeches God to bring his troubles to a termination. Accordingly
there follows immediately after the corresponding prayer *Direct thou
the righteous,* or *establish him;* for it is of little importance which
of these two readings we adopt. The meaning is, that God would
re-establish and uphold the righteous, who are wrongfully oppressed, and
thus make it evident that they are continued in their estate by the
power of God, notwithstanding the persecution to which they are
subjected.—*For God searcheth the hearts* The Hebrew copulative is here
very properly translated by the causal particle *for,* since David,
without doubt, adds this clause as an argument to enforce his prayer. He
now declares, for the third time, that, trusting to the testimony of a
good conscience, he comes before God with confidence; but here he
expresses something more than he had done before, namely, that he not
only showed his innocence, by his external conduct, but had also
cultivated purity in the secret affection of his heart. He seems to set
this confidence in opposition to the insolence and boasting of his
enemies, by whom, it is probable, such calumnies had been circulated
among the people concerning him, as constrained him in his deep
affliction to present his heart and reins to be tried by God. Perhaps,
also, he speaks in this manner, in order to divest them of all those
plausible but false and deceitful pretenses, which they made use of for
the purpose of deceiving men, and if they succeeded in doing this they
were satisfied.  <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) He shows that,
although they might triumph before the world, and receive the applause
of the multitude, they, nevertheless, gained nothing, inasmuch as they
would, by and by, have to make their appearance before the judgment-seat
of God, where the question would not be, What were their titles? or,
What was the splendour of their actions? but how it stood as to the
purity of their hearts.

<span id="xiii.iv-p8"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p9"></span>**10.** *My shield* It is not wonderful
that David often mingles meditations with his prayers, thereby to
inspire himself with true confidence. We may go to God in prayer with
great alacrity; but our fervour, if it does not gather new strength,
either immediately fails or begins to languish. David, therefore, in
order to continue in prayer with the same ardour of devotion and
affection with which he commenced, brings to his recollection some of
the most common truths of religion, and by this means fosters and
invigorates his faith. He declares, that as God *saves the upright in
heart,* he is perfectly safe under his protection. Whence it follows,
that he had the testimony of an approving conscience. And, as he does
not simply say *the righteous,* but *the upright in heart,* he appears
to have an eye to that inward searching of *the heart and reins*
mentioned in the preceding verse.

<span id="xiii.iv-p10"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p11"></span>**11** *God judgeth the righteous etc.*
Others read, *God is a righteous Judge, and God is angry every day.* The
words will certainly admit of this sense; but as the doctrine is fuller
according to the first reading, I have preferred following it, as I see
it is more approved of by the most learned divines, and, besides, it is
more suitable to the subject which David is now considering. As Saul and
his accomplices had, by their calumnious reports, so far succeeded in
their wicked design as to have produced a general prejudice against
David, so that he was condemned by almost the whole people, the holy man
supports himself from this one consideration, that whatever may be the
confusion of things in the world, God, notwithstanding, can easily
discern between the righteous and the wicked. He, therefore, appeals
from the false judgments of men to Him who can never be deceived. It
may, however, be asked, How does the Psalmist represent God *as judging
every day,* when we see him delaying punishment frequently for a long
time? The sacred writings certainly most justly celebrate his
long-suffering; but, although he exercises patience long, and does not
immediately execute his judgments, yet, as no time passes, yea, not even
a day, in which he does not furnish the clearest evidence that he
discerns between the righteous and the wicked, notwithstanding the
confusion of things in the world, it is certain that he never ceases to
execute the office of a judge. All who will be at the trouble to open
their eyes to behold the government of the world, will distinctly see
that the patience of God is very different from approbation or
connivance. Surely, then, his own people will confidently betake
themselves to him every day.

<span id="xiii.v-p9"></span>**12** *If he turn not* These verses are
usually explained in two ways. The meaning is, that if David’s enemies
should persevere in their malicious designs against him, there is
denounced against them the vengeance which their obstinate wickedness
deserves. Accordingly, in the second clause, they supply the name of
*God,*—*If he turn not, GOD will whet his sword;*  <span
id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) as if it had been said, If my enemy do
not repent,  <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) he shall, at
length, feel that God is completely armed for the purpose of maintaining
and defending the righteous. If it is understood in this sense, the
third verse is to be considered as a statement of the cause why God will
thus equip himself with armour, namely, because the ungodly, in
conceiving all kinds of mischief, in travailing to bring forth
wickedness, and in at length bringing forth deceit and falsehood,
directly assail God, and openly make war upon him. But, in my judgment,
those who read these two verses in one continued sentence, give a more
accurate interpretation. I am not, however, satisfied that even they
fully bring out the meaning of the Psalmist. David, I have no doubt, by
relating the dreadful attempts of his enemies against him, intended
thereby to illustrate more highly the grace of God; for when these
malicious men, strengthened by powerful military forces, and abundantly
provided with armour, furiously rushed upon him in the full expectation
of destroying him, who would not have said that it was all over with
him? Moreover, there is implied in the words a kind of irony, when he
pretends to be afraid of their putting him to death. They mean the same
thing as if he had said, “If my enemy do not alter his purpose, or turn
his fury and his strength in another direction, who can preserve me from
perishing by his hands? He has an abundant supply of arms, and he is
endeavouring, by all methods, to accomplish my death.” But Saul is the
person of whom he particularly speaks, and therefore he says, *he hath
made fit his arrows for the persecutors* This implies that Saul had many
agents in readiness who would willingly put forth their utmost efforts
in seeking to destroy David. The design of the prophet, therefore, was
to magnify the greatness of the grace of God, by showing the greatness
of the danger from which he had been delivered by him.  <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) Moreover, when it is here said, if *he
do not return, returning* does not signify repentance and amendment in
David’s enemy, but only a change of will and purpose, as if he had said,
“It is in the power of my enemy to do whatever his fancy may suggest.”
 <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) Whence it appears the more
clearly, how wonderful the change was which suddenly followed contrary
all expectation. When he says that Saul had *prepared the instruments of
death for his bow,* he intimates that he was driving after no ordinary
thing, but was fully determined to wound to death the man whom he shot
at. Some, referring the Hebrew word <span
id="xiii.v-p13.2"></span>דולקים *doulekim,* which we have rendered
*persecutors,* to *arrows,* have rendered it *burning,*  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) because it has also this
signification;  <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) but the
translation which I have given is the more appropriate. David complains
that he had reason to be afraid, not only of one man, but of a great
multitude, inasmuch as Saul had armed a powerful body of men to pursue
and persecute a poor fugitive.

<span id="xiii.v-p16"></span><span id="xiii.v-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p17"></span>**14** *Behold, he shall travail* David has
hitherto shown how great and formidable the danger was which was near
him. In this verse, laughing to scorn the presumptuous and foolish
attempts of Saul, and his magnificent preparations, he declares that
they had failed of accomplishing their object.  <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) By the demonstrative adverb *Behold,*
he enhances the wonder, inasmuch as such a result fell out, on his part
altogether unlooked for. *Behold,* says he, *after he has travailed to
bring forth wickedness, like as he had conceived mischief,* at length
there comes forth only empty wind and vanity, because God frustrated his
expectations, and destroyed all these wicked attempts.  <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) Iniquity and mischief are here put for
every kind of violence and outrage  <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) which Saul intended to inflict upon
David. Some interpreters think that the order of the words is inverted,
because *travailing to bring forth is* put before *conceiving;* but I
think that the words have their proper place if you explain them thus:
Behold, he shall travail to bring forth wickedness, for he hath
conceived mischief; that is to say, as he long ago devised with himself
my destruction, so he will do his utmost to put his design into
execution. David afterwards adds, *he hath brought forth falsehood* This
implies that Saul had been disappointed in his expectation; as Isaiah,
(<span id="xiii.v-p20.2"></span>[Isa
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#018)<span id="xiii.v-p20.2"></span>,.md)
in like manner, speaks of unbelievers “bringing forth wind,” when their
success does not correspond to their wicked and presumptuous attempts.
As often, therefore, as we see the ungodly secretly plotting our ruin,
let us remember that they speak falsehood to themselves; in other words
deceive themselves, and shall fail in accomplishing what they devise in
their hearts.  <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) If, however, we
do not perceive that they are disappointed in their designs until they
are about to be brought forth, let us not be cast down, but bear it with
a spirit of patient submission to the will and providence of God.

<span id="xiii.vi"></span>

<span id="xiii.vi-p1"></span><span id="xiii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015.md)<span id="xiii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vi-p2"></span>**15**. He hath digged a pit, and hollowed
it out;  <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) and he hath fallen into
the ditch which he hath made. **16**. His wickedness shall return upon
his own head, and his violence shall descend upon his own crown.

<span id="xiii.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiii.vi-p5"></span><span id="xiii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vi-p6"></span>Here David says not only that their wicked
devices were without success, but that, by the wonderful providence of
God, the result was the very opposite of what had been contemplated. He
sets this forth in the first place metaphorically, by employing the
figure of *a pit and a ditch;* and then he expresses the same thing in
simple terms without figure, declaring, that the *mischief intended for
others returned upon the head of him who had devised it* There is no
doubt that it was a common proverb among the Jews, He who hath digged a
pit falleth into it; which they quoted when they meant to say, that
wicked and crafty men are caught in the snares and traps which they have
set for others, or that the contrivers of the ruin of others perish by
their own devices.  <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) There is a
twofold use of this doctrine: the first place, however skilled in craft
our enemies may be, and whatever means of doing mischief they may have,
we must nevertheless look for the issue which God here promises, that
they shall fall by their own sword. And this is not a thing which
happens by chance; but God, by the secret direction of his own hand,
causes the evil which they intend to bring upon the innocent to return
upon their own heads. In the second place, If at any time we are
instigated by passion to inflict any injury upon our neighbours, or to
commit any wickedness, let us remember this principle of retributive
justice, which is often acted upon by the divine government, that those
who prepare a pit for others are cast into it themselves; and the effect
will be, that every one, in proportion as he would consult his own
happiness and welfare, will be careful to restrain himself from doing
any injury, even the smallest, to another.

<span id="xiii.vi-p8"></span><span id="xiii.vi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vi-p9"></span>**17** *I will praise Jehovah according to
his righteousness; and I will sing to the name of Jehovah, Most High* As
the design of God in the deliverances which he vouchsafes to his
servants is, that they may render to him in return the sacrifices of
praise, David here promises that he will gratefully acknowledge the
deliverance which he had received, and at the same time affirms that his
preservation from death was the undoubted and manifest work of God. He
could not, with truth, and from the heart, have ascribed to God the
praise of his deliverance, if he had not been fully persuaded that he
had been preserved otherwise than by the power of man. He, therefore,
not only promises to exercise the gratitude which was due to his
deliverer, but he confirms in one word what he has rehearsed throughout
the psalm, that he is indebted for his life to the grace of God, who had
not suffered Saul to take it from him. *The righteousness of God* is
here to be understood of his faithfulness which he makes good to his
servants in defending and preserving their lives. God does not shut up
or conceal his righteousness from our view in the secret recesses of his
own mind, but manifests it for our advantage when he defends us against
all wrongful violence, delivers us from oppression, and preserves us in
safety although wicked men make war upon us and persecute us.

<span id="xiii.v-p4"></span> According to Calvin, the pronoun refers to

<span id="xiii.v-p10"></span> This is the view adopted by *Hengstenberg*
in his excellent Commentary on The Psalms. “The apparently coarse manner
of expression in our text,” says he, “representing God as a warrior
equipped with sword and bow, has besides for its foundation the
coarseness of sinners, and the weakness of faith on the part of
believers, which does not direct itself against the visible danger with
pure thoughts of God’s controllable agency, but seeks to clothe those
thoughts with flesh and blood, and regards the judge as standing over
against the sinner, man against man, sword against sword.”

<span id="xiii.v-p14"></span> Those who adopt this rendering, support it
from the reading of the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac versions,
although the Chaldee version reads *persecuting;* and they generally
view the 12th and 13th verses as a representation of God under the image
of a warrior ready to shoot his flaming, burning, fiery arrows, against
the object to which he is opposed.” I read <span
id="xiii.v-p14.1"></span>וצלקים *urentes,* <span

and represented as the artillery of heaven.”—*Dr* *Kennicott’s note on
this place in his Select Passages of the Old Testament. Hengstenberg*
takes the same view. His rendering is, *He \[that is, God\] makes his
arrows burning. “*<span id="xiii.v-p14.6"></span>רלק, *to burn.* In
sieges it is customary to wrap round the arrows burning matter, and to
shoot them after being kindled.”

<span id="xiii.vi-p3"></span> *Fry*, from a comparison of the Hebrew
word which Calvin renders *hollowed it out,* with the cognate Arabic
words supposes that it means “dug it over, so as to cover and hide it.”
The imagery is taken from the common method of catching lions and other
wild beasts in the east, by digging pits on the spots which they were
observed to frequent, and covering them slightly over with reeds or
small branches of trees. *Luther’s* translation of this clause is
precisely the same with that of Calvin; and, in his Commentary on the
place, he well explains the force of the expressions of the Psalmist.
“See,” says he, “how admirably he expresses the hot burning fury of the
ungodly, not simply declaring, *he has dug a pit,* but adding to this,
*and hollowed it out.* So active and diligent are they to have the pit
dug and the hole prepared. They try every thing, they explore every
thing, and not satisfied that they have dug a pit, they clear it out and
make it deep, as deep as they possibly can, that they may destroy and
subvert the innocent.”
