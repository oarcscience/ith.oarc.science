<span id="xxxi-p1"></span>PSALM 25.

<span id="xxxi-p2"></span>This psalm consists of meditations mingled
with prayers. Being rudely treated, and grievously distressed, by the
cruelty of his enemies, David, in order to obtain assistance from God,
first acknowledges that God had justly made use of this as a means of
chastising and punishing him for his sins; and, therefore, he prays for
their forgiveness, that he may at once enjoy assurance of the divine
favor, and obtain deliverance. He then implores the aid of the Holy
Spirit, that, sustained by it, he might, even in the midst of so many
temptations, continue in the fear of God. And in various places he
intermingles meditation, as the means of stirring up himself to
increased confidence in God, and of withdrawing his thoughts from the
allurements of the world.

<span id="xxxi-p3"></span>A Psalm of David.

<span id="xxxi.i"></span>

<span id="xxxi.i-p1"></span><span id="xxxi.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md)<span id="xxxi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.i-p2"></span>**1.** Unto thee, O Jehovah! I have lifted
up my soul **2.** O my God! I have put my trust in thee; let me not be
ashamed; let not mine enemies rejoice over me. **3.** Yea, none of those
that wait on thee shall be ashamed; but they shall be ashamed that deal
falsely without cause.

<span id="xxxi.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxxi.i-p4"></span><span id="xxxi.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.i-p5"></span>**1.** *Unto thee, O Jehovah! etc* The
Psalmist declares at the very outset, that he is not driven hither and
thither, after the manner of the ungodly, but that he directs all his
desires and prayers to God alone. Nothing is more inconsistent with true
and sincere prayer to God, than to waver and gaze about as the heathen
do, for some help from the world; and at the same time to forsake God,
or not to betake ourselves directly to his guardianship and protection.
Those who imagine that David here declares that he had devoted himself
entirely to God, as if he had offered up himself in sacrifice, do not
properly understand the import of the passage. The meaning rather is,
that in order to strengthen the hope of obtaining his request, he
declares, what is of the greatest importance in prayer, that he had his
hope fixed in God, and that he was not ensnared by the allurements of
the world, or prevented from lifting up his soul fully and unfeignedly
to God. In order, therefore, that we may pray aright to God, let us be
directed by this rule — not to distract our minds by various and
uncertain hopes, nor to depend on worldly aid, but to yield to God the
honor of lifting up our hearts to him in sincere and earnest prayer.
Moreover, although the verb is properly rendered, *I will lift up,* yet
I have followed other interpreters in changing it into the past tense,
*I have lifted up* By the future tense, however, David denotes a
continued act.

<span id="xxxi.i-p6"></span><span id="xxxi.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.i-p7"></span>**2.** *O my God! I have put my trust in
thee.* By this verse we learn, (what will appear more clearly
afterwards,) that David had to do with men; but as he was persuaded that
his enemies were, as it were, the scourges of God, he with good reason
asks that God would restrain them by his power, lest they should become
more insolent, and continue, to exceed all bounds. By the word *trust*
he confirms what he had just said of the lifting up of his soul to God;
for the term is employed either as descriptive of the way in which the
souls of the faithful are lifted up, or else faith and hope are added as
the cause of such an effect, namely, the lifting up of the soul. And,
indeed, these are the wings by which our souls, rising above this world,
are lifted up to God. David, then, was carried upward to God with the
whole desire of his heart, because, trusting to his promises, he thereby
hoped for sure salvation. When he asks *that God would not suffer him to
be put to shame,* he offers up a prayer which is taken from the ordinary
doctrine of Scripture, namely, that they who trust in God shall never be
ashamed. The reason which is added, and which he here pleads, to induce
God to have pity upon him, ought also to be noticed. It is this, that he
might not be exposed to the derision of his enemies, whose pride is no
less hurtful to the feelings of the godly than it is displeasing to God.

<span id="xxxi.i-p8"></span><span id="xxxi.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.i-p9"></span>**3.** *Yea, none of those, etc.* If these
words should be explained in the form of a desire, as if David had said,
Let none who wait on thee be put to shame,  <span
id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) then, in this verse, he continues his
prayer, and extends to all the faithful in common what he had spoken of
himself alone. But I am rather inclined to understand the words in a
different sense, and to view them as meaning that David shows the fruit
of divine grace which should proceed from his deliverance. And there is
peculiar force in the word *yea;* for as he knew that he was seen by
many, and that the report of his confidence in God was widely spread,
his meaning is, that what shall be done in his person shall extend far
and wide, as an example to others, and shall have the effect of reviving
and animating all the children of God, on the one hand, and of casting
to the ground the arrogance of the wicked, on the other. The words might
also be understood in another sense, namely, that David, for the
strengthening of his faith, sets before himself a promise which God
frequently makes in his word. But the sense in which I have interpreted
them seems to be more suitable. By the wicked *that deal falsely without
cause,* he no doubt means especially his enemies. Accordingly, he
declares that when he is delivered he will not enjoy exclusively the
benefit of it; but that its fruit shall extend to all true believers;
just as on the other hand, the faith of many would have been shaken if
he had been forsaken of God. In the last clause of the verse, which he
puts in opposition to the first, he argues that when the wicked lie
confounded, it redounds to the glory of God, because the vaunting in
which they indulge in their prosperity is an open mockery of God, while,
in despite of his judgment, they break forth more boldly in doing evil.
When he adds, *without cause,* it only tends to show the aggravated
nature of the offense. The wickedness of a man is always the more
intolerable, when, unprovoked by wrongs, he sets himself, of his own
accord, to injure the innocent and blameless.

<span id="xxxi.ii"></span>

<span id="xxxi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxxi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
25:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#004.md)<span id="xxxi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.ii-p2"></span>**4.** O Jehovah! make me to know thy ways,
and teach me thy paths. **5.** Lead me in thy truth, and teach me; for
thou art the God of my salvation: I have waited for thee all the day.
**6.** Remember, O Jehovah! thy tender mercies and thy
loving-kindnesses, for they have been from everlasting. **7.** Remember
not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy
compassion, and for the sake of thy goodness, O Jehovah! do thou
remember me.

<span id="xxxi.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxxi.ii-p4"></span><span id="xxxi.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.ii-p5"></span>**4.** *O Jehovah! make me to know thy
ways.* By *the ways of the Lord,* David sometimes means, as we have seen
in another place, the happy and prosperous issue of affairs, but more
frequently he uses this expression to denote the rule of a holy and
righteous life. As the term *truth* occurs in the immediately following
verse, the prayer which he offers up in this place is, in my opinion, to
this effect: Lord, keep thy servant in the firm persuasion of thy
promises, and do not suffer him to turn aside to the right hand or to
the left. When our minds are thus composed to patience, we undertake
nothing rashly or by improper means, but depend wholly upon the
providence of God. Accordingly, in this place David desires not merely
to be directed by the Spirit of God, lest he should err from the right
way, but also that God would clearly manifest to him his truth and
faithfulness in the promises of his word, that he might live in peace
before him, and be free from all impatience.  <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) If any one would rather take the words
in a general sense, as if David committed himself wholly to God to be
governed by him, I do not object to it. As, however, I think it
probable, that, under the name of *truth* in the next verse, he explains
what he means by the ways and paths of God, of which he here speaks, I
have no hesitation in referring the prayer to this circumstance, namely,
that David, afraid of yielding to the feeling of impatience, or the
desire of revenge, or some extravagant and unlawful impulse, asks that
the promises of God may be deeply impressed and engraven on his heart.
For I have said before, that as long as this thought prevails in our
minds, that God takes care of us, it is the best and most powerful means
for resisting temptations. If, however, by *the ways and paths of God,*
any would rather understand his doctrine, I, nevertheless, still hold
this as a settled point, that in the language of the Psalmist there is
an allusion to those sudden and irregular emotions which arise in our
minds when we are tossed by adversity, and by which we are precipitated
into the devious and deceitful paths of error, till they are in due time
subdued or allayed by the word of God. Thus the meaning is, Whatever may
happen, suffer me not, O Lord, to fall from thy ways, or to be carried
away by a wilful disobedience to thy authority, or any other sinful
desire; but rather let thy truth preserve me in a state of quiet repose
and peace, by an humble submission to it. Moreover, although he
frequently repeats the same thing, asking that God would make him to
know his ways, and teach him in them, and lead him in his truth, there
is no redundancy in these forms of speech. Our adversities are often
like mists which darken the eyes; and every one knows from his own
experience how difficult a thing it is, while these clouds of darkness
continue, to discern in what way we ought to walk. But if David, so
distinguished a prophet and endued with so much wisdom, stood in need of
divine instruction, what shall become of us if, in our afflictions, God
dispel not from our minds those clouds of darkness which prevent us from
seeing his light? As often, then, as any temptation may assail us, we
ought always to pray that God would make the light of his truth to shine
upon us, lest, by having recourse to sinful devices, we should go
astray, and wander into devious and forbidden paths.

<span id="xxxi.ii-p7"></span><span id="xxxi.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.ii-p8"></span>At the same time, we ought to observe the
argument which David here employs to enforce his prayer. By calling God
*the God of his salvation,* he does so in order to strengthen his hope
in God for the future, from a consideration of the benefits which he had
already received from him; and then he repeats the testimony of his
confidence towards God. Thus the first part of the argument is taken
from the nature of God himself, and the duty which, as it were, belongs
to him; that is to say, because he engages to maintain the welfare of
the godly, and aids them in their necessities, on this ground, that he
will continue to manifest the same favor towards them even to the end.
But as it is necessary that our confidence in God should correspond to
his great goodness towards us, David alleges it, at the same time, in
connection with a declaration of his perseverance. For, by the
expression *all the day,* or *every day,* he signifies that with a fixed
and untiring constancy he depended upon God alone. And, doubtless, it is
the property of faith always to look to God, even in the most trying
circumstances, and patiently to wait for the aid which he has promised.
That the recollection of the divine blessings may nourish and sustain
our hope, let us learn to reflect upon the goodness which God has
already manifested towards us, as we see that David did in making this
the ground of his confidence, that he had found in his own personal
experience God to be the author of salvation.

<span id="xxxi.ii-p9"></span><span id="xxxi.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.ii-p10"></span>**6.** *Remember, O Jehovah;* From this it
appears, in the first place, that David was grievously afflicted and
tried, so much so that he had lost all sense of God’s mercy: for he
calls upon God to remember for him his favor, in such a manner as if he
had altogether forgotten it. This, therefore, is the complaint of a man
suffering extreme anguish, and overwhelmed with grief. We may learn from
this, that although God, for a time, may withdraw from us every token of
his goodness, and, apparently regardless of the miseries which afflict
us, should, as if we were strangers to him, and not his own people,
forsake us, we must fight courageously, until, set free from this
temptation, we cordially present the prayer which is here recorded,
beseeching God, that, returning to his former manner of dealing, he
would again begin to manifest his goodness towards us, and to deal with
us in a more gracious manner. This form of prayer cannot be used with
propriety, unless when God is hiding his face from us, and seems to take
no interest at all in us. Moreover David, by having recourse to the
mercy or compassion and goodness of God, testifies that he trusts not to
his own merit as any ground of hope. He who derives every thing from the
fountain of divine mercy alone, finds nothing in himself entitled to
recompense in the sight of God. But as the intermission which David had
experienced was an obstacle which prevented his free access to God, he
rises above it, by the very best remedy — the consideration, that
although God, who from his very nature is merciful, may withdraw
himself, and cease for a time to manifest his power, yet he cannot deny
himself; that is to say, he cannot divest himself of the feeling of
mercy which is natural to him, and which can no more cease than his
eternal existence. But we must firmly maintain this doctrine, that God
has been merciful even from the beginning, so that if at any time he
seem to act with severity towards us, and to reject our prayers, we must
not imagine that he acts contrary to his real character, or that he has
changed his purpose. Hence we learn for what end it is that the
Scriptures every where inform us, that in all ages God has regarded his
servants with a benignant eye, and exercised his mercy towards them.
 <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) This, at least, we ought to
regard as a fixed and settled point, that although the goodness of God
may sometimes be hidden, and as it were buried out of sight, it can
never be extinguished.

<span id="xxxi.ii-p12"></span><span id="xxxi.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.ii-p13"></span>**7.** *Remember not the sins of my
youth.* As our sins are like a wall between us and God, which prevents
him from hearing our prayers, or stretching forth his hand to help us,
David now removes this obstruction. It is indeed true, in general, that
men pray in a wrong way, and in vain, unless they begin by seeking the
forgiveness of their sins. There is no hope of obtaining any favor from
God unless he is reconciled to us. How shall he love us unless he first
freely reconcile us to himself? The right and proper order of prayer
therefore is, as I have said, to ask, at the very outset, that God would
pardon our sins. David here acknowledges, in explicit terms, that he
cannot in any other way become a partaker of the grace of God than by
having his sins blotted out. In order, therefore, that God may be
mindful of his mercy towards us, it is necessary that he forget our
sins, the very sight of which turns away his favor from us. In the
meantime, the Psalmist confirms by this more clearly what I have already
said, that although the wicked acted towards him with cruelty, and
persecuted him unjustly, yet he ascribed to his own sins all the misery
which he endured. For why should he ask the forgiveness of his sins, by
having recourse to the mercy of God, but because he acknowledged, that
by the cruel treatment he received from his enemies, he only suffered
the punishment which he justly merited? He has, therefore, acted wisely
in turning his thoughts to the first cause of his misery, that he may
find out the true remedy; and thus he teaches us by his example, that
when any outward affliction presses upon us, we must entreat God not
only to deliver us from it, but also to blot out our sins, by which we
have provoked his displeasure, and subjected ourselves to his chastening
rod. If we act otherwise, we shall follow the example of unskilful
physicians, who, overlooking the cause of the disease, only seek to
alleviate the pain, and apply merely adventitious remedies for the cure.
Moreover, David makes confession not only of some slight offenses, as
hypocrites are wont to do, who, by confessing their guilt in a general
and perfunctory manner, either seek some subterfuge, or else extenuate
the enormity of their sin; but he traces back his sins even to his very
childhood, and considers in how many ways he had provoked the wrath of
God against him. When he makes mention of the sins which he had
committed in his youth, he does not mean by this that he had no
remembrance of any of the sins which he had committed in his later
years; but it is rather to show that he considered himself worthy of so
much the greater condemnation.  <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md)
In the first place, considering that he had not begun only of late to
commit sin, but that he had for a long time heaped up sin upon sin, he
bows himself, if we may so speak, under the accumulated load; and, in
the second place, he intimates, that if God should deal with him
according to the rigour of law, not only the sins of yesterday, or of a
few days, would come into judgment against him, but all the instances in
which he had offended, even from his infancy, might now with justice be
laid to his charge. As often, therefore, as God terrifies us by his
judgments and the tokens of his wrath, let us call to our remembrance,
not only the sins which we have lately committed, but also all the
transgressions of our past life, proving to us the ground of renewed
shame and renewed lamentation. Besides, in order to express more fully
that he supplicates a free pardon, he pleads before God only on the
ground of his mere good pleasure; and therefore he says, *According to
thy compassion do thou remember me* When God casts our sins into
oblivion, this leads him to behold us with fatherly regard. David can
discover no other cause by which to account for this paternal regard of
God, but that he is good, and hence it follows that there is nothing to
induce God to receive us into his favor but his own good pleasure. When
God is said to remember us according to his mercy, we are tacitly given
to understand that there are two ways of remembering which are entirely
opposite; the one when he visits sinners in his wrath, and the other
when he again manifests his favor to those of whom he seemed for a time
to take no account.

<span id="xxxi.iii"></span>

<span id="xxxi.iii-p1"></span><span id="xxxi.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
25:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#008.md)<span
id="xxxi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.iii-p2"></span>**8.** Good and upright is Jehovah;
therefore will he teach sinners in the way. **9.** He will guide the
poor in judgment, and will teach the poor  <span
id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) his way. **10.** All the ways of
Jehovah are mercy and truth, to those who keep his covenant and his
testimony. **11.** For thy name’s sake, O Jehovah! be thou merciful to
mine iniquity, for it is great.

<span id="xxxi.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxxi.iii-p5"></span><span id="xxxi.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.iii-p6"></span>**8.** *Good and upright is Jehovah.*
Pausing for a little as it were in the prosecution of his prayer, he
exercises his thoughts in meditation upon the goodness of God, that he
may return with renewed ardor to prayer. The faithful feel that their
hearts soon languish in prayer, unless they are constantly stirring
themselves up to it by new incitements; so rare and difficult a thing is
it to persevere steadfastly and unweariedly in this duty. And, indeed,
as one must frequently lay on fuel in order to preserve a fire, so the
exercise of prayer requires the aid of such helps, that it may not
languish, and at length be entirely extinguished. David, therefore,
desirous to encourage himself to perseverance, speaks to himself, and
affirms that God is *good and upright,* that, gathering new strength by
meditating on this truth, he may return with the more alacrity to
prayer. But we must observe this consequence — that as God is good and
upright, he stretches forth his hand *to sinners* to bring them back
again into *the way.* To attribute to God an uprightness which he may
exercise only towards the worthy and the meritorious, is a cold view of
his character, and of little advantage to sinners, and yet the world
commonly apprehends that God is good in no other sense. How comes it to
pass that scarcely one in a hundred applies to himself the mercy of God,
if it is not because men limit it to those who are worthy of it? No on
the contrary, it is here said, that God gives a proof of his uprightness
when he shows to transgressors the way; and this is of the same import
as to call them to repentance, and to teach them to live uprightly. And,
indeed, if the goodness of God did not penetrate even to hell, no man
would ever become a partaker of it. Let the Papists then boast as they
please of their imaginary preparations, but let us regard this as a sure
and certain doctrine, that if God do not prevent men by his grace, they
shall all utterly perish. David, therefore, here commends this
preventing grace, as it is called, which is manifested either when God
in calling us at first renews, by the Spirit of regeneration, our
corrupt nature, or when he brings us back again into the right way,
after we have gone astray from him by our sins. For since even those
whom God receives for his disciples are here called sinners, it follows
that he renews them by his Holy Spirit that they may become docile and
obedient.

<span id="xxxi.iii-p7"></span><span id="xxxi.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.iii-p8"></span>**9.** *He will guide the poor in
judgment.* The Psalmist here specifies the second manifestation of his
grace which God makes towards those who, being subdued by his power, and
brought under his yoke, bear it willingly, and submit themselves to his
government. But never will this docility be found in any man, until the
heart, which is naturally elated and filled with pride, has been humbled
and subdued. As the Hebrew word <span id="xxxi.iii-p8.1"></span>ענוים,
*anavim,* denotes the *poor* or *afflicted,* and is employed in a
metaphorical sense, to denote *the meek and humble,* it is probable that
David, under this term, includes the afflictions which serve to restrain
and subdue the frowardness of the flesh, as well as the grace of
humility itself; as if he had said, When God has first humbled them,
then he kindly stretches forth his hand to them, and leads and guides
them throughout the whole course of their life. Moreover, some
understand these terms, *judgment* and *way of the Lord,* as denoting a
righteous and well ordered manner of life. Others refer them to the
providence of God, an interpretation which seems more correct, and more
agreeable to the context, for it is immediately added, *All the ways of
Jehovah are mercy and truth.* The meaning therefore is, that those who
are truly humbled in their hearts, and brought to place their confidence
in God, shall experience how much care he has for his children,  <span
id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) and how well he provides for their
necessities. The terms, *judgment* and *way of the Lord,* therefore, are
simply of the same import in this place as his government, in the
exercise of which he shows that he, as a kind father, has a special
interest in the welfare of his children, by relieving them when they are
oppressed, raising them up when cast down, cheering and comforting them
when sorrowful, and succouring them when afflicted. We perceive, then,
by what order God proceeds in the manifestation of his grace towards us.
First, he brings us again into the way when we are wandering and going
astray from him, or rather, when we are already fugitives and exiles
from him, he restrains our frowardness; and whereas we were before
froward and rebellious, he now subdues us to the obedience of his
righteousness: and, secondly, after he has afflicted and tried us, he
does not forsake us; but after he has moulded and trained us by the
cross to humility and meekness, he still shows himself to be a wise and
provident father in guiding and directing us through life.

<span id="xxxi.iii-p10"></span><span id="xxxi.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.iii-p11"></span>**10.** *All the ways of Jehovah.* This
verse is erroneously interpreted by those who think that the doctrine of
the law is here described as true and sweet, and that those who keep it
feel it indeed to be so, as if this passage were of the same import as
that which was spoken by Jesus Christ,

<span id="xxxi.iii-p12"></span>“My yoke is easy, and my burden is
light.”  
(<span id="xxxi.iii-p12.2"></span>[Mt
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030.md)<span
id="xxxi.iii-p12.2"></span>)

<span id="xxxi.iii-p13"></span>Such an interpretation is not only
strained, but may also be easily disproved by many similar passages in
which the expression, *The ways of the Lord,* is taken in a passive
signification, for the paternal manner in which he acts towards those
who are his people, in defending and cherishing them; nay, even for his
whole conduct in the government and direction of the affairs of this
world. The amount of what is said is, that God acts in such a manner
towards his people, as that, in all respects, they may find from
experience that he is merciful and faithful. David is not here speaking
of the character in which God acts towards mankind in general, but what
his own children find him to be. We have already seen in <span
id="xxxi.iii-p13.1"></span>[Ps
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)<span
id="xxxi.iii-p13.1"></span>, that he is stern and severe towards the
obstinate and rebellious; and even though he act with kindness towards
them, in mercifully exercising forbearance towards them notwithstanding
their iniquity, yet we find, that so far from seeking their full
enjoyment in him, and trusting to his promises, they have no sense of
his goodness. Nay, as soon as any adversity befalls them, they either
become passionate and fretful, accuse God of acting cruelly towards
them, or else complain that he is deaf to their prayers; and when they
enjoy prosperity, they despise and neglect him, and as much as they are
able flee from his presence. David, therefore, in speaking of the
*mercy* and *faithfulness* of God, justly describes them as a treasure
peculiar to the godly; as if he had said, We have no reason to be afraid
that God will deceive us if we persevere in his covenant. These words,
*covenant* and *testimony,* are of the same import, unless that the
second is added as an explanation of the first. They comprehend the
whole doctrine of the law, by which God enters into covenant with his
chosen people.

<span id="xxxi.iii-p14"></span><span id="xxxi.iii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.iii-p15"></span>**11.** *For thy name’s sake, O Jehovah!*
As in the original text the copulative *and* is inserted between the two
clauses of this verse, some think that the first clause is incomplete,
and that some word ought to be supplied; and then they read these words,
*Be thou merciful to mine iniquity, etc.,* as a distinct sentence by
itself. And thus, according to their opinion, the sense would be, Lord,
although I have not fully kept thy covenant, yet do not on that account
cease to show thy kindness towards me; and that mine iniquity may not
prevent thy goodness from being extended towards me, do thou graciously
pardon it. But I am rather of the opinion of others, who consider that
the copulative is here, as it is in many other places, superfluous, so
that the whole verse may form one connected sentence. As to the tense of
the verb, there is also a diversity of opinion among interpreters. Some
render it in the past tense thus, *Thou hast been merciful,* as if David
here renders thanks to God because he had pardoned his sin. But the
other interpretation, which is the one more generally received, is also
the most correct, namely, that David, in order to obtain pardon, again
resorts to the mercy of God as his only refuge. The letter <span
id="xxxi.iii-p15.1"></span>ו, *vau,* which is equivalent to *and,* has
often the force of changing the tense in the Hebrew verbs, so that the
future tense is often taken in the sense of the optative. Moreover, I
connect this verse with the preceding one in this way: The prophet,
having reflected upon this, that God is kind and faithful to those who
serve him, now examines his own heart, and acknowledges that he cannot
be accounted of their number, unless God grant unto him the forgiveness
of his sins; and, therefore, he betakes himself to prayer for pardon: as
in <span id="xxxi.iii-p15.2"></span>[Ps
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#013.md)<span
id="xxxi.iii-p15.2"></span>, after having spoken of the reward which is
laid up for the faithful who keep the law, he instantly exclaims, “Who
can understand his errors?” Accordingly, although David is not ignorant
that God promises liberally to bestow upon those who keep his covenant
every thing which pertains to a life of happiness, yet, at the same
time, considering how far he is as yet from the perfect righteousness of
the law, he does not rest his confidence upon it, but seeks a remedy for
the manifold offenses of which he feels himself to be guilty. And thus,
in order that God may reckon us of the number of his servants, we ought
always to come to him, entreating him, after the example of David, in
his fatherly loving-kindness, to bear with our infirmities, because,
without the free remission of our sins, we have no reason to expect any
reward of our works. At the same time, let it be observed, that in order
to show more distinctly that he depends entirely upon the free grace of
God, he expressly says, *for thy name’s sake;* meaning by this, that
God, as often as he vouchsafes to pardon his people, does so from no
other cause than his own good pleasure; just as he had said a little
before, in the same verse, *for thy goodness’ sake.* He was also
constrained, by a consideration of the magnitude of his offense, to call
upon the name of God: for he immediately adds, by way of confession,
*because mine iniquity is great,* or *manifold,* (for the word <span
id="xxxi.iii-p15.3"></span>רב, *rab,* may be translated in both ways;)
as if he had said, My sins are, indeed, like a heavy burden which
overwhelms me, so that the multitude or enormity of them might well
deprive me of all hope of pardon; but, Lord, the infinite glory of thy
name will not suffer thee to cast me off.

<span id="xxxi.iv-p1"></span><span id="xxxi.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
25:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#012.md)<span
id="xxxi.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.iv-p2"></span>**12.** Who is the man that feareth
Yehovah, he will teach him, in the way that he should choose. **13.**
His soul shalt dwell in good, and his seed shall inherit the earth.
**14.** The counsel  <span id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md) of Jehovah
is towards them that fear him, that he may make known his covenant to
them. **15.** Mine eyes are continually towards Jehovah, for he will
bring my feet out of the net.

<span id="xxxi.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxxi.iv-p5"></span><span id="xxxi.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.iv-p6"></span>**12.** *Who is the man.* By again
recalling to his mind the character in which God manifests himself
towards his servants, he derives new strength and courage. For we have
said, that nothing more readily occurs than a relaxation in earnest and
attentive prayer, unless it be sustained by the recollection of God’s
promises. There can, however, be no doubt, that David both accuses
himself, and by entertaining a better hope, takes encouragement to
continue in the fear of God. In the first place, by intimating that men
are destitute of right understanding and sound judgment, because they
yield not themselves to be governed by God with reverence and fear, he
imputes it to his own indolence, that by reason of the darkness of his
mind, he had wandered so far astray after his own lusts; and yet, on the
other hand, he promises himself the guidance and direction of the Holy
Spirit, if he only yield himself wholly to God, and show that he is
willing to learn. Moreover, the interrogatory style of speaking, which
he here employs, seems designed to show how few there are who fear God:
for, although all men in general pray, and manifest some appearance of
piety, yet where is there one among so many who is really in earnest?
Instead of this, almost all men indulge themselves in their own
drowsiness. The fear of God, therefore, is very rare; and on this
account it is that the world, for the most part, continues destitute of
the Spirit of counsel and wisdom.

<span id="xxxi.iv-p7"></span>Some interpreters render the word *choose*
in the present tense, instead of the future, *shall choose;* as if it
had been said, that God shows the way which he approves, and in which he
wishes men to walk. With this interpretation I cannot agree; for, in my
judgment, the word *choose* rather refers to every individual; as if it
had been said, Provided we are disposed to fear God, he will not be
wanting on his part, but will always direct us by the Spirit of wisdom
to choose the right way. When we are called upon to adopt some
particular course in life, we find ourselves as it were placed between
two ways, and know not which of them to follow;  <span
id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md) nay, in almost all our affairs we are
held in suspense and doubt, unless God appear to show us the way. David
therefore says, that although men know not what is right, and what they
ought to choose, yet provided they submit to God with pious docility of
mind, and are willing to follow him, he will always manifest himself
towards them as a sure and faithful guide. As, however, the fear of God
is not naturally in us, it were foolish for any man to argue from this
place, that God does not begin to take care of men until, by their own
previous efforts, they insinuate themselves into his favor, that he may
aid them in their pious endeavors. David has just declared, that this
grace comes directly from God, when he says that God teaches the
transgressors: and now he adds, in the second place, that after men have
once been subdued and moulded to meekness of spirit, God still takes
them under his charge, guiding and directing them till they are able, by
the illumination of the Holy Spirit, to know what is their duty.

<span id="xxxi.iv-p9"></span><span id="xxxi.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.iv-p10"></span>**13.** *His soul shall dwell in good.* If
the supreme felicity of man consists in undertaking or attempting
nothing except by the warrant of God, it follows that it is also a high
and incomparable benefit to have him for our conductor and guide through
life, that we may never go astray. But, in addition to this, an earthly
blessing is here promised, in which the fruit of the preceding grace is
distinctly shown, as Paul also teaches,

<span id="xxxi.iv-p11"></span>“Godliness is profitable unto all things,
having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.”
(<span id="xxxi.iv-p11.1"></span>[1Ti
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008)<span id="xxxi.iv-p11.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="xxxi.iv-p12"></span>The sum is, that those who truly serve God
are not only blessed as to spiritual things, but are also blessed by him
as to their condition in the present life. It is indeed true, that God
does not always deal with them according to their desires, and that the
blessings which they would wish do not always flow in a certain and
uniform manner. On the contrary, it often happens that they are tossed
with sickness and trouble, whilst the wicked enjoy prosperity. But we
must know, that as often as God withdraws his blessing from his own
people, it is for the purpose of awakening them to a sense of their
condition, and discovering to them how far removed they still are from
the perfect fear of God. And yet, in so far as it is expedient for them,
they now enjoy the blessings of God, so that, in comparison of worldly
men, and the despisers of God, they are truly happy and blessed,
because, even in their greatest poverty, they never lose the assurance
that God is present with them; and being sustained by this consolation,
they enjoy peace and tranquillity of mind. It is indeed true, that all
our miseries proceed from this one source — that by our sins we prevent
the divine blessing from flowing down in a uniform course upon us; and
yet, amidst such a state of confusion, his grace never ceases to shine
forth, so that the condition of the godly is always better than that of
others: for although they are not satiated with good things, yet they
are continually made to experience a sense of the fatherly favor of God.
And to this I am willing to refer the word *soul,* namely, that, in the
reception of the gifts of God, they do not devour them without feeling a
sense of their sweetness, but really relish them, so that the smallest
competency is of more avail to satisfy them than the greatest abundance
is to satisfy the ungodly. Thus, according as every man is contented
with his condition, and cheerfully cherishes a spirit of patience and
tranquillity, his soul is said *to dwell in good.* Some interpreters
apply this word *to dwell* or *abide* to the time of death; but this
interpretation is more subtle than solid. The inspired penman rather
speaks, as we have already said, of the condition of the present life.
 <span id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560.md) He adds, in the second place,
by way of illustration, that the posterity of the faithful *shall
inherit the land,* and from this it follows, that God continues to
extend his favor towards them. Hence we may again infer, that the death
of God’s servants does not imply their utter destruction, and that they
do not cease to exist when they pass out of this world, but continue to
live for ever. It would be absurd to suppose that God would totally
deprive of life those for whose sake he does good even to others. As to
what is here said, that the children of the saints shall inherit the
land, it has been touched upon elsewhere, and it will be shown still
more fully on the thirty-seventh Psalm, in what respects, and how this
is accomplished.

<span id="xxxi.iv-p14"></span><span id="xxxi.iv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.iv-p15"></span>**14.** *The counsel of Jehovah.* The
Psalmist here confirms what he had just said in a preceding verse,
namely, that God will faithfully discharge the office of a teacher and
master to all the godly; and, after his usual manner, he repeats the
same sentiment twice in the same verse for the *covenant of God* is
nothing else than his *secret* or *counsel.* By the use of the term
*secret,* he means to magnify and extol the excellency of the doctrine
which is revealed to us in the law of God. However much worldly men,
through the pride and haughtiness of their hearts, despise Moses and the
prophets, the faithful nevertheless acknowledge, that in the doctrine
which they contain, the secrets of heaven, which far surpass the
comprehension of man, are revealed and unfolded. Whoever, therefore,
desires to derive instruction from the law, let him regard with
reverence and esteem the doctrine which it contains. We are, farther, by
this place admonished to cultivate the graces of meekness and humility,
lest, in reliance upon our own wisdom, or trusting to our own
understanding, we should attempt, by our own efforts, to comprehend
those mysteries and secrets, the knowledge of which David here declares
to be the prerogative of God alone. Again, since the fear of the Lord is
said to be the beginning, and as it were the way that leads to a right
understanding of his will, (<span id="xxxi.iv-p15.1"></span>[Ps
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md)<span
id="xxxi.iv-p15.1"></span>,) according as any one desires to increase in
faith, so also let him endeavor to advance in the fear of the Lord.
Moreover, when piety reigns in the heart, we need have no fear of losing
our labor in seeking God. It is indeed true, that the covenant of God is
a secret which far exceeds human comprehension; but as we know that he
does not in vain enjoin us to seek him, we may rest assured that all
those who endeavor to serve him with an upright desire will be brought,
by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, to the knowledge of that heavenly
wisdom which is appointed for their salvation. But, in the meantime,
David indirectly rebukes those who falsely and groundlessly boast that
they are interested in the covenant of God, while they rest merely in
the letter of the law, and have no saving impressions of the fear of
God. God, it is true, addresses his word indiscriminately to the
righteous and the wicked; but men do not comprehend it, unless they have
sincere piety; just as <span id="xxxi.iv-p15.2"></span>[Isa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011.md)<span id="xxxi.iv-p15.2"></span>,
says, that as regards the ungodly, the law is like “a book that is
sealed.” And, therefore, it is no wonder that there is here made a
distinction between those who truly serve God, and to whom he makes
known his secret, and the wicked or hypocrites. But when we see David in
this confidence coming boldly to the school of God, and leading others
along with him, let us know, as he clearly shows, that it is a wicked
and hateful invention to attempt to deprive the common people of the
Holy Scriptures, under the pretense of their being a hidden mystery; as
if all who fear him from the heart, whatever their state or condition in
other respects may be, were not expressly called to the knowledge of
God’s covenant.

<span id="xxxi.iv-p16"></span><span id="xxxi.iv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.iv-p17"></span>**15.** *Mine eyes are continually towards
Jehovah.* David here speaks of his own faith, and of its perseverance,
not in the way of boasting, but to encourage himself in the hope of
obtaining his requests, so that he might give himself the more readily
and cheerfully to prayer. As the promise is made to all who trust in
God, that they shall not be disappointed of their hope, and that they
shall never be put to shame, the saints often make this their shield of
defense. Meanwhile, David shows to others, by his own example, the right
manner of prayer, telling them that they should endeavor to keep their
thoughts fixed upon God. As the sense of sight is very quick, and
exercises an entire influence over the whole frame, it is no uncommon
thing to find all the affections denoted by the term *eyes.* The reason
which immediately follows shows still more plainly, that in the mind of
David hope was associated with desire; as if he had said, That in
resting his confidence in the help of God, he did so, not in doubt or
uncertainty, but because he was persuaded that he would be his
deliverer. The pronoun *He,* it ought to be observed, is also emphatic.
It shows that David did not gaze around him in every direction, after
the manner of those who, being in uncertainty, devise for themselves
various methods of deliverance and salvation, but that he was contented
with God alone.

<span id="xxxi.v"></span>

<span id="xxxi.v-p1"></span><span id="xxxi.v-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
25:16-22](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#016.md)<span id="xxxi.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.v-p2"></span>**16.** Have respect unto me, and pity me,
for I am alone and poor. **17.** The troubles of my heart are enlarged;
bring thou me out of my distresses. **18.** Look upon mine affliction
and my trouble,  <span id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561.md) and take away
all my sins. **19.** Behold mine enemies, for they are increased; and
they hate me with a violent  <span id="fr_562"></span>[563](#fn_562.md)
hatred. **20.** Preserve my soul, and deliver me, that I may not be
ashamed; for I have put my trust in thee. **21.** Let integrity and
uprightness preserve me, for I have waited upon thee. **22.** Do thou, O
God! redeem Israel from all his troubles.

<span id="xxxi.v-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxxi.v-p6"></span><span id="xxxi.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.v-p7"></span>**16.** *Have respect unto me.* As the flesh
is ever ready to suggest to our minds that God has forgotten us, when he
ceases to manifest his power in aiding us, David here follows the order
which nature dictates, in asking God to have respect unto him, as if he
had altogether neglected him before. Now, it appears to me that the
words might be explained thus: Have respect unto me, in order to pity
me. He accounts it at once the cause and the source of his salvation to
be regarded of God; and then he adds the effect of it: for as soon as
God, of his own good pleasure, shall vouchsafe to regard us, his hand
also will be ready to help us. Again, in order to excite the compassion
of God, he sets forth his own misery, expressly stating that he is
*alone,* that is to say, *solitary;*  <span
id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563.md) and then he describes himself as
*poor.* There can be no doubt that, in speaking thus, he alludes to the
promises in which God declares that he will be always present with the
afflicted and oppressed, to aid and help them.

<span id="xxxi.v-p9"></span><span id="xxxi.v-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.v-p10"></span>**17.** *The troubles of my heart are
enlarged.* In this verse he acknowledges not only that he had to contend
outwardly with his enemies and the troubles which they occasioned him,
but that he was also afflicted inwardly with sorrow and anguish of
heart. It is also necessary to observe the manner of expression which he
here employs, and by which he intimates that the weight and number of
his trials had accumulated to such an extent that they filled his whole
heart, even as a flood of waters bursting every barrier, and extending
far and wide, covers a whole country. Now, when we see that the heart of
David had sometimes been wholly filled with anguish, we need no longer
wonder if at times the violence of temptation overwhelm us; but let us
ask with David, that even whilst we are as it were at the point of
despair, God would succor us.

<span id="xxxi.v-p11"></span><span id="xxxi.v-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.v-p12"></span>**18.** *Look upon mine affliction.* By
repeating these complaints so frequently, he plainly shows that the
calamities with which he was assailed were not some slight and trivial
evils. And this ought to be carefully marked by us, so that when trials
and afflictions shall have been measured out to us after the same
manner, we may be enabled to lift up our souls to God in prayer; for the
Holy Spirit has set before our view this representation, that our minds
may not fail us under the multitude or weight of afflictions. But in
order to obtain an alleviation of these miseries, David again prays that
his sins may be pardoned, recalling to his recollection what he had
already stated, that he could not expect to enjoy the divine favor,
unless he were first reconciled to God by receiving a free pardon. And,
indeed, they are very insensible who, contented with deliverance from
bodily affliction, do not search out the evils of their own hearts, that
is to say, their sins, but as much as in them lies rather desire to have
them buried in oblivion. To find a remedy, therefore, to his cares and
sorrows, David begins by imploring the remission of his sins, because,
so long as God is angry with us, it must necessarily follow, that all
our affairs shall come to an unhappy termination; and he has always just
ground of displeasure against us so long as our sins continue, that is
to say, until he pardons them.  <span id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564.md)
And although the Lord has various ends in view in bringing his people
under the cross, yet we ought to hold fast the principle, that as often
as God afflicts us, we are called to examine our own hearts, and humbly
to seek reconciliation with him.

<span id="xxxi.v-p14"></span><span id="xxxi.v-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.v-p15"></span>**19.** *Behold mine enemies.* In this
verse David complains of the number and cruelty of his enemies, because
the more the people of God are oppressed, the more is he inclined to aid
them; and in proportion to the magnitude of the danger by which they are
surrounded, he assists them the more powerfully. The words, *hatred of
violence,*  <span id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565.md) are here to be
understood of a cruel and sanguinary hatred. Now, as the rage of David’s
enemies was so great, that nothing short of his death would satisfy
them, he calls upon God to become the guardian and protector of his
life; and from this it may be inferred, as I have already said, that he
was now placed in extreme danger. The clause which immediately follows,
*That I may not be ashamed,* may be understood in two ways. Some retain
the future tense, *I shall not be ashamed,* as if David felt assured
that he was already heard by God, and as the reward of his hope promised
himself a gracious answer to his prayers. I am rather inclined to the
opposite opinion — to consider these words as still forming a part of
his prayer. The amount of what is stated therefore is, that as he trusts
in God, he prays that the hope of salvation which he had formed might
not be disappointed. There is nothing better fitted to impart a holy
ardor to our prayers, than when we are able to testify with sincerity of
heart that we confide in God. And, therefore, it behoves us to ask with
so much the greater care, that he would increase our hope when it is
small, awaken it when it is dormant, confirm it when it is wavering,
strengthen it when it is weak, and that he would even raise it up when
it is overthrown.

<span id="xxxi.v-p17"></span><span id="xxxi.v-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.v-p18"></span>**21.** *Let integrity and uprightness
preserve me.* Some are of opinion, that in these words David simply
prays that he may be preserved from all mischief, on the ground that he
had conducted himself inoffensively towards others, and had abstained
from all deceit and violence. Others make the words to contain a twofold
subject of prayer, and understand them as including at the same time a
desire that God would bestow upon him a sincere and upright purpose of
heart; and all this lest he should break forth into revenge, and other
unlawful means of preserving his life. Thus the meaning would be: Lord,
although my flesh may urge me to seek relief from whatever quarter it
may appear, and mine enemies also may constrain me to it by their
importunity, yet do thou subdue within me every sinful passion, and
every perverse desire, so that I may always exercise over my mind a pure
and entire control; and let integrity and uprightness suffice as two
powerful means of preserving me. We prefer the first interpretation,
because he immediately subjoins a proof of his integrity. Whosoever
waits upon God with a meek and quiet spirit, will rather suffer any
thing which men can inflict, than allow himself to contend unrighteously
with his enemies. In my opinion, therefore, David protests that such was
the rectitude of his behavior amongst men, that the persecution of his
enemies was wholly unmerited and unjust; and being conscious of having
given no offense to any, he calls upon God as the protector of his
innocence. But as he has already, in three different places,
acknowledged that he was justly visited with affliction, it may seem
strange that he should now glory in his integrity. This apparent
inconsistency has already been explained in another place, where we have
shown that the saints, in respect of themselves, always come into the
presence of God with humility, imploring his forgiveness: and yet this
does not prevent them from setting forth before him the goodness of
their cause, and the justice of their claims. At the same time, in
saying that he *trusted* in God, he only states what indeed is
essentially necessary; for, in undertaking our defense, it is not enough
that we have justice on our side, unless depending upon his promises, we
rely with confidence upon his protection. It often happens, that men of
firmness and prudence, even when their cause is good, do not always
succeed in its defense, because they confide in their own understanding,
or rely upon fortune. In order, therefore, that God may become the
protector and defender of our innocence, let us first conduct ourselves
uprightly and innocently towards our enemies, and then commit ourselves
entirely to his protection.

<span id="xxxi.v-p19"></span><span id="xxxi.v-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xxxi.v-p20"></span>**22.** *Do thou, O God! redeem Israel.* By
this conclusion David shows of what character the enemies were of whom
he complained. From this it would appear that they were domestic
enemies, who, like some disease raging within the bowels, were now the
cause of trouble and vexation to the people of God. By the word
*redeem,* which he here employs, we may infer that the Church was at
that time oppressed with hard bondage; and, therefore, I have no doubt
that in this psalm he alludes to Saul and others who reigned with him in
a tyrannical manner. At the same time, he shows that he has respect not
merely to his own benefit, but that he comprehends in his prayer the
state of the whole realm, just as the mutual communion and connection
which subsist among the saints require that every individual, deeply
affected by a sense of the public calamities which befall the Church at
large, should unite with all the others in lamentation before God. This
contributed in no small degree to confirm the faith of David, when,
regarding himself as in all things connected with the whole body of the
faithful, he considered that all the afflictions and wrongs which he
endured were common to himself with them. And we ought to regard it as
of the greatest importance, that in accordance with this rule, every one
of us, in bewailing his private miseries and trials, should extend his
desires and prayers to the whole Church.

<span id="xxxi.v-p8"></span> The Hebrew word here used is <span
id="xxxi.v-p8.2"></span>יחיד, *yachid, unus, one,* which is not
infrequently put, as in this place, for a *solitary* and *desolate*
person. David was now deserted, desolate, and destitute of all help. The
word is used in the same sense in <span id="xxxi.v-p8.3"></span>[Ps
22:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#020.md)<span id="xxxi.v-p8.3"></span>,
and <span id="xxxi.v-p8.4"></span>[Ps

<span id="xxxi.v-p13"></span> “<span id="xxxi.v-p13.1"></span>Cependant
que nos pechez demeurent c’est a dire iusaues a ce qu’il les pardonne.”

<span id="xxxi.v-p16"></span> The Hebrew words literally rendered are,
“With hatred of violence.”
