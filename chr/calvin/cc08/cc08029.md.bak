<span id="xxx-p1"></span>PSALM 24.

<span id="xxx-p2"></span>As God stands related to all mankind as their
Creator and Governor, David, from this consideration, magnifies the
special favor which God manifested towards the children of Abraham, in
choosing them to be his peculiar people, in preference to the rest of
mankind, and in erecting his sanctuary as his house that he might dwell
among them. He shows, at the same time, that although the sanctuary was
open to all the Jews, God was not near to all of them, but only to those
who feared and served him in sincerity, and who had cleansed themselves
from the pollutions of the world, in order to devote themselves to
holiness and righteousness. Moreover, as the grace of God was more
clearly manifested after the temple was built, he celebrates that grace
in a strain of splendid poetry, to encourage true believers with the
more alacrity to persevere in the exercise of serving and honoring him.

<span id="xxx-p3"></span>A Psalm of David.

<span id="xxx.i"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p1"></span><span id="xxx.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
24:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001.md)<span id="xxx.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p2"></span>**1.** The earth is Jehovah’s, and the
fullness thereof;  <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538.md) the world,
and they that dwell therein: **2.** For he hath founded it upon the
seas, and established it upon the floods. **3.** Who shall ascend unto
the hill of Jehovah? who shall stand in his holy place? **4.** He who is
clean of hands, and pure of heart; who hath not lifted up his soul to
vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

<span id="xxx.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxx.i-p5"></span><span id="xxx.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p6"></span>**1.** *The earth is Jehovah’s.* We will find
in many other places the children of Abraham compared with all the rest
of mankind, that the free goodness of God, in selecting them from all
other nations, and in embracing them with his favor, may shine forth the
more conspicuously. The object of the beginning of the psalm is to show
that the Jews had nothing of themselves which could entitle them to
approach nearer or more familiarly to God than the Gentiles. As God by
his providence preserves the world, the power of his government is alike
extended to all, so that he ought to be worshipped by all, even as he
also shows to all men, without exception, the fatherly care he has about
them. But since he preferred the Jews to all other nations, it was
indispensably necessary that there should be some sacred bond of
connection between him and them, which might distinguish them from the
heathen nations. By this argument David invites and exhorts them to
holiness. He tells them that it was reasonable that those whom God had
adopted as his children, should bear certain marks peculiar to
themselves, and not be altogether like strangers. Not that he incites
them to endeavor to prejudice God against others, in order to gain his
exclusive favor; but he teaches them, from the end or design of their
election, that they shall then have secured to them the firm and
peaceful possession of the honor which God had conferred upon them above
other nations, when they devote themselves to an upright and holy life.
 <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md) In vain would they have been
collected together into a distinct body, as the peculiar people of God,
if they did not apply themselves to the cultivation of holiness. In
short, the Psalmist pronounces God to be the King of the whole world, to
let all men know that, even by the law of nature, they are bound to
serve him. And by declaring that he made a covenant of salvation with a
small portion of mankind, and by the erection of the tabernacle, gave
the children of Abraham the symbol of his presence, thereby to assure
them of his dwelling in the midst of them, he teaches them that they
must endeavor to have purity of heart and of hands, if they would be
accounted the members of his sacred family.

<span id="xxx.i-p8"></span>With respect to the word *fullness*, I admit
that under it all the riches with which the earth is adorned are
comprehended, as is proved by the authority of Paul; but I have no doubt
that the Psalmist intends by the expression men themselves, who are the
most illustrious ornament and glory of the earth. If they should fail,
the earth would exhibit a scene of desolation and solitude, not less
hideous than if God should despoil it of all its other riches. To what
purpose are there produced so many kinds of fruit, and in so great
abundance, and why are there so many pleasant and delightful countries,
if it is not for the use and comfort of men?  <span
id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540.md) Accordingly, David explains, in the
following clause, that it is principally of men that he speaks. It is
his usual manner to repeat the same thing twice, and here *the fullness
of the earth,* and *the inhabitants of the world*, have the same
meaning. I do not, however, deny that the riches with which the earth
abounds for the use of men, are comprehended under these expressions.
Paul, therefore, (<span id="xxx.i-p9.2"></span>[1Co
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#026)<span id="xxx.i-p9.2"></span>.md)
when discoursing concerning meats, justly quotes this passage in support
of his argument, maintaining that no kind of food is unclean, because,
“the earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof.”

<span id="xxx.i-p10"></span><span id="xxx.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p11"></span>**2.** *For he hath founded it upon the
seas.* The Psalmist here confirms the truth, that men are rightfully
under the authority and power of God, so that in all places and
countries they ought to acknowledge him as King. And he confirms it from
the very order manifested in the creation; for the wonderful providence
of God is clearly reflected in the whole face of the earth. In order to
prove this, he brings forward the proof of it, which is most evident.
How is it that the earth appears above the water, but because God
purposely intended to prepare a habitation for men? Philosophers
themselves admit, that as the element of the water is higher than the
earth, it is contrary to the nature of the two elements  <span
id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541.md) for any part of the earth to continue
uncovered with the waters, and habitable. Accordingly, Job (<span
id="xxx.i-p12.2"></span>[Job 28:11](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#011.md),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#025)<span id="xxx.i-p12.2"></span>.md)
extols, in magnificent terms, that signal miracle by which God restrains
the violent and tempestuous ragings of the sea, that it may not
overwhelm the earth, which, if not thus restrained, it would immediately
do and produce horrible confusion. Nor does Moses forget to mention this
in the history of the creation. After having narrated that the waters
were spread abroad so as to cover the whole earth, he adds, that by an
express command of God they retired into one place, in order to leave
empty space for the living creatures which were afterwards to be
created, (<span id="xxx.i-p12.3"></span>[Ge
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#009)<span id="xxx.i-p12.3"></span>.md)
From that passage we learn that God had a care about men before they
existed, inasmuch as he prepared for them a dwelling-place and other
conveniences; and that he did not regard them as entire strangers,
seeing he provided for their necessities, not less liberally than the
father of a family does for his own children. David does not here
dispute philosophically concerning the situation of the earth, when he
says, that *it has been founded upon the seas*. He uses popular
language, and adapts himself to the capacity of the unlearned. Yet this
manner of speaking, which is taken from what may be judged of by the
eye, is not without reason. The element of earth, it is true, in so far
as it occupies the lowest place in the order of the sphere, is beneath
the waters; but the habitable part of the earth is above the water, and
how can we account for it, that this separation of the water from the
earth remains stable, but because God has put the waters underneath, as
it were for a foundation? Now, as from the creation of the world, God
extended his fatherly care to all mankind, the prerogative of honor, by
which the Jews excelled all other nations, proceeded only from the free
and sovereign choice by which God distinguished them.

<span id="xxx.i-p13"></span><span id="xxx.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p14"></span>**3.** *Who shall ascend unto.* It being
very well known that it was of pure grace that God erected his
sanctuary, and chose for himself a dwelling-place among the Jews, David
makes only a tacit reference to this subject.  <span
id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542.md) He insists principally on the other
point contained in the verse, that of distinguishing true Israelites
from the false and bastards. He takes the argument by which he exhorts
the Jews to lead a holy and righteous life from this, that God had
separated them from the rest of the world, to be his peculiar
inheritance. The rest of mankind, it is true, seeing they were created
by him, belong to his empire; but he who occupies a place in the church
is more nearly related to him. All those, therefore, whom God receives
into his flock he calls to holiness; and he lays them under obligations
to follow it by his adoption. Moreover, by these words David indirectly
rebukes hypocrites, who scrupled not falsely to take to themselves the
holy name of God, as we know that they are usually lifted up with pride,
because of the titles which they take without having the excellencies
which these titles imply, contenting themselves with bearing only
outside distinctions;  <span id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md) yea,
rather he purposely magnifies this singular grace of God, that every man
may learn for himself, that he has no right of entrance or access to the
sanctuary, unless he sanctify himself in order to serve God in purity.
The ungodly and wicked, it is true, were in the habit of resorting to
the tabernacle; and, therefore, God, by the Prophet Isaiah, (<span
id="xxx.i-p16.2"></span>[Isa 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#012.md)<span
id="xxx.i-p16.2"></span>) reproaches them for coming unworthily into his
courts, and wearing the pavement thereof. But David here treats of those
who may lawfully enter into God’s sanctuary. The house of God being
holy, if any rashly, and without a right, rush into it, their corruption
and abuse are nothing else but polluting it. As therefore they do not go
up thither lawfully, David makes no account of their going up; yea,
rather, under these words there is included a severe rebuke, of the
conduct of wicked and profane men, in daring to go up into the
sanctuary, and to pollute it with their impurity. On this subject I have
spoken more fully on the 15th psalm. In the second part of the verse he
seems to denote perseverance, as if he had said, Who shall go up into
the hill of Sion, to appear and stand in the presence of God? The Hebrew
word <span id="xxx.i-p16.3"></span>קום, *kum*, it is true, sometimes
signifies *to rise up*, but it is generally taken for *to stand*, as we
have seen in the first psalm. And although this is a repetition of the
same idea, stated in the preceding clause, it is not simply so, but
David, by expressing the end for which they ought to go up, illustrates
and amplifies the subject; and this repetition and amplification we find
him often making use of in other psalms. In short, how much soever the
wicked were mingled with the good in the church, in the time of David,
he declares how vain a thing it is to make an external profession unless
there be, at the same time, truth in the inward man. What he says
concerning the tabernacle of the covenant must be applied to the
continual government of the church.

<span id="xxx.i-p17"></span><span id="xxx.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p18"></span>**4.** *He who is clean of hands, and pure
of heart.* Under the purity of the hands and of the heart, and the
reverence of God’s name, he comprehends all religion, and denotes a well
ordered life. True purity, no doubt, has its seat in the heart, but it
manifests its fruits in the works of the hands. The Psalmist, therefore,
very properly joins to a pure heart the purity of the whole life; for
that man acts a ridiculous part who boasts of having a sound heart, if
he does not show by his fruits that the root is good. On the other hand,
it will not suffice to frame the hands, feet, and eyes, according to the
rule of righteousness, unless purity of heart precede outward
continence. If any man should think it absurd that the first place is
given to the hands, we answer without hesitation, that effects are often
named before their causes, not that they precede them in order, but
because it is sometimes advantageous to begin with things which are best
known. David, then, would have the Jews to bring into the presence of
God pure hands, and these along with an unfeigned heart. *To lift up*,
or *to take his soul*, I have no doubt is here put for to swear. It is,
therefore, here required of the servants of God, that when they swear,
they do it with reverence and in good conscience,  <span
id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md) and, under one particular, by
synecdoche, is denoted the duty of observing fidelity and integrity in
all the affairs of life. That mention is here made of oaths, appears
from the words which immediately follow, *And hath not sworn
deceitfully*, which are added as explanatory of what goes before. As,
however, there is a twofold reading of the Hebrew word for soul, that is
to say, as it may be read, *my soul*, or *his soul*, on account of the
point *hirek*, some Jewish commentators read, *Who hath not lifted up my
soul to vanity*,  <span id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md) and understand
the word *my* as spoken of God, an exposition which I reject as harsh
and strained. It is a manner of speaking which carries in it great
emphasis, for it means, that those who swear offer their souls as
pledges to God. Some, however, may perhaps prefer the opinion, that *to
lift up the soul*, is put for *to apply it to lying*, an interpretation
to the adoption of which I have no great objection, for it makes little
difference as to the sense. A question may here be raised — it may be
asked, why David does not say so much as one word concerning faith and
calling upon God. The reason of this is easily explained. As it seldom
happens that a man behaves himself uprightly and innocently towards his
brethren, unless he is so endued with the true fear of God as to walk
circumspectly before him, David very justly forms his estimate of the
piety of men towards God by the character of their conduct towards their
fellow-men. For the same reason, Christ (<span
id="xxx.i-p20.7"></span>[Mt 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md)<span
id="xxx.i-p20.7"></span>) represents judgment, mercy, and faith, as the
principal points of the law; and Paul calls “charity” at one time “the
end of the law,” (<span id="xxx.i-p20.8"></span>[1Ti
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005)<span id="xxx.i-p20.8"></span>.md) and
at another “the bond of perfection” (<span id="xxx.i-p20.9"></span>[Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014)<span id="xxx.i-p20.9"></span>..md)

<span id="xxx.ii"></span>

<span id="xxx.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxx.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
24:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#005.md)<span id="xxx.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.ii-p2"></span>**5.** He shall receive blessing from
Jehovah, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. **6.** This is
the generation of them that seek him, of them that seek thy face, O
Jacob!  <span id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) Selah.

<span id="xxx.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxx.ii-p5"></span><span id="xxx.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.ii-p6"></span>**5.** *He shall receive blessing.* The more
effectually to move the minds of the Israelites, David declares that
nothing is more desirable than to be numbered among the flock of God,
and to be members of the church. We must here consider that there is an
implied contrast between true Israelites and those of them who were
degenerate and bastards. The more license the wicked give themselves,
the more presumptuous are they in pretending to the name of God, as if
he were under obligation to them, because they are adorned with the same
outward symbols or badges as true believers. Accordingly, the
demonstrative pronoun *this*, in the following verse, is of great
weight, for it expressly excludes all that bastard generation which
gloried only in the mask of external ceremonies. And in this verse, when
he speaks of blessing, he intimates that it is not those who boast of
being the servants of God, while they have only the name, who shall be
partakers of the promised *blessing*, but those only who answer to their
calling with their whole heart, and without hypocrisy. It is, as we have
already observed, a very powerful inducement to godliness and an upright
life, when the faithful are assured that they do not lose their labor in
following righteousness, since God has in reserve for them a blessing
which cannot fail them. The word *righteousness* may be explained two
ways. It either means all the benefits of God, by which he proves
himself to be righteous and faithful towards his people in keeping his
promises to them, or it denotes the fruit or reward of the believer’s
righteousness. Indeed, David’s meaning is abundantly manifest. He
intends to show on the one hand, that it is not to be expected that the
fruit or reward of righteousness will be bestowed on those who
unrighteously profane God’s sacred worship; and on the other hand, that
it is impossible for God to disappoint his true worshippers; for it is
his peculiar office to give evidence of his righteousness by doing them
good.

<span id="xxx.ii-p7"></span><span id="xxx.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.ii-p8"></span>**6.** *This is the generation.* I have just
now observed, that by the demonstrative pronoun *this*, the Psalmist
erases from the catalogue of the servants of God all counterfeit
Israelites, who, trusting only to their circumcision and the sacrifices
of beasts, have no concern about offering themselves to God; and yet, at
the same time, they rashly thrust themselves into the church. Such
persons may pretend to have delight in the service of God, by often
coming to his temple, but they have no other design than to withdraw
themselves from him as far as they can. Now, as nothing was more common
in the mouths of each of them than to say, that they all belonged to the
holy seed, the Psalmist has limited the name of holy generation to the
true observers of the law; as if he had said, All who have sprung from
Abraham, according to the flesh, are not, on that account, his
legitimate children. It is, no doubt, truly said in many other places,
as we shall see in <span id="xxx.ii-p8.2"></span>[Psalm
27](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#000.md)<span id="xxx.ii-p8.2"></span>, that
those sought the face of God who, to testify their godliness, exercised
themselves in the ceremonies before the ark of the covenant; that is to
say, if they were brought thither by a pure and holy affection. But as
hypocrites seek God externally in a certain way, as well as true saints,
while yet they shun him by their windings and false pretences,  <span
id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md) David here declares that God is not
sought in truth unless there go before a zealous cultivation of holiness
and righteousness. To give the sentence greater emphasis, he repeats it,
using the second person, and addressing his discourse to God.  <span
id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) It is as if he summoned before the
judgment-seat of God hypocrites, who account it nothing falsely to use
the name of God before the world; and he thus teaches us, that whatever
they may say in their empty talk among men, the judgment of God will be
a very different matter. He adds the word Jacob, for the confirmation of
the same doctrine putting it for those who were descended from Jacob; as
if he had said, Although circumcision distinguishes all the seed of
Jacob according to the flesh from the Gentiles, yet we can only
distinguish the chosen people by the fear and reverence of God, as
Christ said, “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!” (<span
id="xxx.ii-p10.1"></span>[Joh
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047)<span id="xxx.ii-p10.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xxx.iii"></span>

<span id="xxx.iii-p1"></span><span id="xxx.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
24:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#007.md)<span id="xxx.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.iii-p2"></span>**7.** Lift up your heads, O ye gates! and
be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors! and the King of glory shall enter
in. **8.** Who is this King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah
mighty in battle. **9.** Lift up your heads, O ye gates! Be ye lifted
up, ye everlasting doors! and the King of glory shall enter in. **10.**
Who is this King of glory? Jehovah of hosts, he is the King of glory.
Selah.

<span id="xxx.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxx.iii-p4"></span><span id="xxx.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.iii-p5"></span>**7.** *Lift up your heads, O ye gates!*
The magnificent and splendid structure of the temple, in which there was
more outward majesty than in the tabernacle, not being yet erected,
David here speaks of the future building of it. By doing this, he
encourages the pious Israelites to employ themselves more willingly, and
with greater confidence, in the ceremonial observances of the law. It
was no ordinary token of the goodness of God that he condescended to
dwell in the midst of them by a visible symbol of his presence, and was
willing that his heavenly dwelling-place should be seen upon earth. This
doctrine ought to be of use to us at this day; for it is an instance of
the inestimable grace of God, that so far as the infirmity of our flesh
will permit, we are lifted up even to God by the exercises of religion.
What is the design of the preaching of the word, the sacraments, the
holy assemblies, and the whole external government of the church, but
that we may be united to God? It is not, therefore, without good reason
that David extols so highly the service of God appointed in the law,
seeing God exhibited himself to his saints in the ark of the covenant,
and thereby gave them a certain pledge of speedy succor whenever they
should invoke him for aid. God, it is true, “dwelleth not in temples
made with hands,” nor does he take delight in outward pomp; but as it
was useful, and as it was also the pleasure of God, that his ancient
people, who were rude, and still in their infancy, should be lifted up
to him by earthly elements, David does not here hesitate to set forth to
them, for the confirmation of their faith, the sumptuous building of the
temple, to assure them that it was not a useless theater; but that when
they rightly worshipped God in it, according to the appointment of his
word, they stood as it were in his presence, and would actually
experience that he was near them. The amount of what is stated is, that
in proportion as the temple which God had commanded to be built to him
upon mount Sion, surpassed the tabernacle in magnificence, it would be
so much the brighter a mirror of the glory and power of God dwelling
among the Jews. In the meantime, as David himself burned with intense
desire for the erection of the temple, so he wished to inflame the
hearts of all the godly with the same ardent desire, that, aided by the
rudiments of the law, they might make more and more progress in the fear
of God. He terms the *gates*, *everlasting*, because the promise of God
secured their continual stability. The temple excelled in materials and
in workmanship, but its chief excellence consisted in this, that the
promise of God was engraven upon it, as we shall see in <span
id="xxx.iii-p5.1"></span>[Ps
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md)<span id="xxx.iii-p5.1"></span>,
“This is my rest for ever.” In terming the gates *everlasting*, the
Psalmist, at the same time, I have no doubt, makes a tacit contrast
between the tabernacle and the temple. The tabernacle never had any
certain abiding place, but being from time to time transported from one
place to another, was like a wayfaring man. When, however, mount Sion
was chosen, and the temple built, God then began to have there a certain
and fixed place of abode. By the coming of Christ, that visible shadow
vanished, and it is therefore not wonderful that the temple is no longer
to be seen upon mount Sion, seeing it is now so great as to occupy the
whole world. If it is objected, that at the time of the Babylonish
captivity the gates which Solomon had built were demolished, I answer,
God’s decree stood fast, notwithstanding that temporary overthrow; and
by virtue of it, the temple was soon after rebuilt; which was the same
as if it had always continued entire. The Septuagint has from ignorance
corrupted this passage.  <span id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) The
Hebrew word <span id="xxx.iii-p6.8"></span>ראשים, *rashim*, which we
have rendered *heads*, is no doubt sometimes taken metaphorically for
*princes*; but the word *your*, which is here annexed to it,
sufficiently shows that we cannot draw from it another sense than this —
that the gates lift up their heads, otherwise we must say, Your princes.
Some, therefore, think that kings and magistrates are here admonished of
their duty, which is to open up the way, and give entrance to God. This
is a plausible interpretation, but it is too much removed from the
design and words of the prophet. Above all, from the natural sense of
the words, we may perceive how foolishly and basely the Papists have
abused this passage for the confirmation of the gross and ridiculous
notion by which they introduce Christ as knocking at the gate of the
infernal regions, in order to obtain admission.  <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) Let us, therefore, learn from this, to
handle the holy word of God with sobriety and reverence, and to hold
Papists in detestation, who, as it were, make sport of corrupting and
falsifying it in this manner, by their execrable impieties.  <span
id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md)

<span id="xxx.iii-p9"></span><span id="xxx.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.iii-p10"></span>**8.** *Who is this King of glory? etc*
The praises by which the power of God is here magnified are intended to
tell the Jews that he did not sit idle in his temple, but took up his
abode in it, in order to show himself ready to succor his people. It is
to be observed, that there is great weight both in the interrogation,
and in the repetition of the same sentence. The prophet assumes the
person of one who wonders thereby to express with greater effect that
God comes armed with invincible power to maintain and save his people,
and to keep the faithful in safety under his shadow. We have already
said, that when God is spoken of as dwelling in the temple, it is not to
be understood as if his infinite and incomprehensible essence had been
shut up or confined within it; but that he was present there by his
power and grace, as is implied in the promise which he made to Moses,

<span id="xxx.iii-p11"></span>“In all places where I record my name, I
will come unto thee, and I will bless thee,” (<span
id="xxx.iii-p11.1"></span>[Ex
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#024.md)<span
id="xxx.iii-p11.1"></span>.)

<span id="xxx.iii-p12"></span>That this was no vain and empty promise,
but that God truly dwelt in the midst of the people, is what the
faithful experienced who sought him not superstitiously, as if he had
been fixed to the temple, but made use of the temple and of the service
which was performed in it for elevating their hearts to heaven. The
amount of what is stated is, that whenever the people should call upon
God in the temple, it would manifestly appear, from the effect which
would follow, that the ark of the covenant was not a vain and an
illusory symbol of the presence of God, because he would always stretch
forth his omnipotent arm for the defense and protection of his people.
The repetition teaches us that true believers cannot be too constant and
diligent in meditation on this subject. The Son of God, clothed with our
flesh, has now shown himself to be *King of glory* and *Lord of hosts*,
and he is not entered into his temple only by shadows and figures, but
really and in very deed, that he may dwell in the midst of us. There is,
therefore, nothing to hinder us from boasting that we shall be
invincible by his power. Mount Sion, it is true, is not at this day the
place appointed for the sanctuary, and the ark of the covenant is no
longer the image or representation of God dwelling between the cherubim;
but as we have this privilege in common with the fathers, that, by the
preaching of the word and the sacraments, we may be united to God, it
becomes us to use these helps with reverence; for if we despise them by
a detestable pride, God cannot but at length utterly withdraw himself
from us.

<span id="xxx.i-p20"></span> The textual reading is <span
id="xxx.i-p20.1"></span>נפשו, *naphshiv, his soul;* the marginal reading
is <span id="xxx.i-p20.2"></span>נפשו*, naphshi, my soul.* But the
textual reading, from its clearness and simplicity, is, without doubt,
the correct one. “The points,” says *Hammond*, “direct to render <span
id="xxx.i-p20.3"></span>נפשת *my soul,* and so the interlinear reads
*anilmain roeare, my soul* or *life,* as if it were making God the
speaker of this verse, and then it is God’s life or soul. But the text
writing <span id="xxx.i-p20.4"></span> וnot <span
id="xxx.i-p20.5"></span>י, and the context agreeing with it, the
punctuation must, in reason, give place; and, accordingly, all the
ancient interpreters appear to have read it <span
id="xxx.i-p20.6"></span>נפשו*, his soul,* meaning by that *his own
soul,* or the *soul of the swearer.”*

<span id="fn_549"></span>[550](cc08029.htm#fr_549.md) <span
id="xxx.iii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="xxx.iii-p6"></span> The Septuagint reads, <span
id="xxx.iii-p6.1"></span>Αρατε πύλὰς οἱ ἄρχοντες ὑμῶν, which may be
rendered, “Ye princes, lift up your gates.” The reading of the Vulgate
is similar: “<span id="xxx.iii-p6.2"></span>Attollite portas principes
vestras“ and so is that of the Arabic and Ethiopic. But that rendering,
as Calvin justly observes, inadmissible; for in the Hebrew text, the
affix <span id="xxx.iii-p6.3"></span>כם, *kem, your,* is joined to <span
id="xxx.iii-p6.4"></span>ראשי, *roshey, heads,* and not to <span
id="xxx.iii-p6.5"></span>שערים, *shearim, gates.* Although, however the
reading of the Septuagint may be translated as above, “Ye princes, lift
up your gates,” *Hammond* thinks it more probable, that the translators
intended <span id="xxx.iii-p6.6"></span>οἱ ἄρχοντες ὑμῶν*, your
princes,* to represent <span id="xxx.iii-p6.7"></span>ראשיכם,
*rashekem,* as myertin, by mistake, the construction of the sentence, so
*your heads,* as to give this reading, “Your heads, or princes, lift up
the gates, instead of, “Ye gates, lift up your heads.”
