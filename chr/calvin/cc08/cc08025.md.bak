<span id="xxvi-p1"></span>PSALM 20.

<span id="xxvi-p2"></span>This psalm contains a common prayer of the
Church in behalf of the King of Israel, that God would succor him in
danger; and in behalf of his kingdom, that God would maintain it in
safety, and cause it to prosper: for in the person of David the safety
and well-being of the whole community centred. To this there is added a
promise, that God will preside over that kingdom of which he was the
founder, and so effectually watch over it as to secure its continual
preservation.

<span id="xxvi-p3"></span>To the chief musician. A Psalm of David.

<span id="xxvi.i"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p1"></span><span id="xxvi.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
20:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#001.md)<span id="xxvi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p2"></span>**1.** May Jehovah hear thee in the day of
trouble! may the name of the God of Jacob defend thee! **2.** May he
send thee help from his sanctuary, and sustain thee out of Sion!

<span id="xxvi.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxvi.i-p4"></span><span id="xxvi.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p5"></span>The inscription shows that the psalm was
composed by David; but though he was its author, there is no absurdity
in his speaking of himself in the person of others. The office of a
prophet having been committed to him, he with great propriety prepared
this as a form of prayer for the use of the faithful. In doing this, his
object was not so much to commend his own person, by authoritatively
issuing a royal ordinance enjoining upon the people the use of this
prayer, as to show, in the exercise of his office as a teacher, that it
belonged to the whole Church to concern itself, and to use its endeavors
that the kingdom which God had erected might continue safe and
prosperous. Many interpreters view this prayer as offered up only on one
particular occasion; but in this I cannot agree. The occasion of its
composition at first may have arisen from some particular battle which
was about to be fought, either against the Ammonites, or against some
other enemies of Israel. But the design of the Holy Spirit, in my
judgment, was to deliver to the Church a common form of prayer, which,
as we may gather from the words, was to be used whenever she was
threatened with any danger. God commands his people, in general, to pray
for kings, but there was a special reason, and one which did not apply
to any other kingdom, why prayer was to be made in behalf of this
kingdom; for it was only by the hand of David and his seed that God had
determined to govern and maintain his people. It is particularly to be
noticed, that under the figure of this temporal kingdom, there was
described a government far more excellent, on which the whole joy and
felicity of the Church depended. The object, therefore, which David had
expressly in view was, to exhort all the children of God to cherish such
a holy solicitude about the kingdom of Christ, as would stir them up to
continual prayer in its behalf.

<span id="xxvi.i-p6"></span>**1.** *May Jehovah hear thee, etc.* The
Holy Spirit, by introducing the people as praying that God would answer
the prayers of the king, is to be viewed as at the same time admonishing
kings that it is their duty to implore the protection of God in all
their affairs. When he says, *In the day of trouble,* he shows that they
will not be exempted from troubles, and he does this that they may not
become discouraged, if at any time they should happen to be in
circumstances of danger. In short, the faithful, that the body may not
be separated from the head, further the king’s prayers by their common
and united supplications. *The name of God* is here put for *God
himself* and not without good reason; for the essence of God being
incomprehensible to us, it behoves us to trust in him, in so far as his
grace and power are made known to us. From his name, therefore, proceeds
confidence in calling upon him. The faithful desire that the king may be
protected and aided by God, whose name was called upon among *the sons
of Jacob.* I cannot agree with those who think that mention is here made
of that patriarch, because God exercised him with various afflictions,
not unlike those with which he tried his servant David. I am rather of
opinion that, as is usual in Scripture, the chosen people are denoted by
the term *Jacob.* And from this name, *the God of Jacob,* the faithful
encourage themselves to pray for the defense of their king; because it
was one of the privileges of their adoption to live under the conduct
and protection of a king set over them by God himself. Hence we may
conclude, as I have said before, that under the figure of a temporal
kingdom there is described to us a government much more excellent.
 <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) Since Christ our King, being an
everlasting priest, never ceases to make intercession with God, the
whole body of the Church should unite in prayer with him;  <span
id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) and farther, we can have no hope of
being heard except he go before us, and conduct us to God.  <span
id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) And it serves in no small degree to
assuage our sorrows to consider that Jesus Christ, when we are
afflicted, accounts our distresses his own, provided we, at the same
time, take courage, and continue resolute and magnanimous in
tribulation; which we should be prepared to do, since the Holy Spirit
here forewarns us that the kingdom of Christ would be subject to dangers
and troubles.

<span id="xxvi.i-p10"></span><span id="xxvi.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p11"></span>**2.** *May he send thee help.* That is to
say, may he succor thee out of mount Sion, where he commanded the ark of
the covenant to be placed, and chose for himself a dwelling-place. The
weakness of the flesh will not suffer men to soar up to heaven, and,
therefore, God comes down to meet them, and by the external means of
grace shows that he is near them. Thus the ark of the covenant was to
his ancient people a pledge of his presence, and the sanctuary an image
of heaven. But as God, by appointing mount Sion to be the place where
the faithful should continually worship him, had joined the kingdom and
priesthood together, David, in putting into the lips of the people a
prayer for help out of Sion, doubtless had an eye to this sacred bond of
union. Hence I conjecture that this psalm was composed by David in his
old age, and about the close of his life. Some think he spake of Sion by
the Spirit of prophecy before it had been appointed that the ark should
be placed there; but this opinion seems strained, and to have little
probability.

<span id="xxvi.ii"></span>

<span id="xxvi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxvi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
20:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#003.md)<span id="xxvi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.ii-p2"></span>**3.** May he remember all thy offerings;
and make thy holocaust \[or burnt sacrifice\] fat!  <span
id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) Selah. **4.** May he grant thee
according to thy heart, and fulfill all thy counsel! **5.** That we may
rejoice in thy salvation, \[or safety;\] and set up a banner in the name
of our God, when Jehovah shall fulfill all thy petitions.

<span id="xxvi.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxvi.ii-p5"></span><span id="xxvi.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.ii-p6"></span>**3.** *May he remember.* I understand the
word *remember* as meaning *to have regard to,* as it is to be
understood in many other places; just as *to forget* often signifies *to
neglect,* or *not to deign to regard, nor even to behold,* the object to
which it is applied. It is, in short, a prayer that God would actually
show that the king’s sacrifices were acceptable to him. Two kinds of
them are here mentioned; *first,* the <span
id="xxvi.ii-p6.1"></span>מנחה*, mincha,* mentioned in the first clause
of the verse, which was the appointed accompaniment of all sacrifices,
and which was also sometimes offered by itself; and, secondly, the
holocaust, or whole burnt-sacrifice. But under these two kinds David
intended to comprehend, by synecdoche, all sacrifices; and under
sacrifices he comprehends requests and prayers. We know that whenever
the fathers prayed under the law, their hope of obtaining what they
asked was founded upon their sacrifices; and, in like manner, at this
day our prayers are acceptable to God only in so far as Christ sprinkles
and sanctifies them with the perfume of his own sacrifice. The faithful,
therefore, here desire that the solemn prayers of the king, which were
accompanied with sacrifices and oblations, might have their effect in
the prosperous issue of his affairs. That this is the meaning may be
gathered still more clearly from the following verse, in which they
commend to God the desires and counsels of the king. But as it would be
absurd to ask God to grant foolish and wicked desires, it is to be
regarded as certain, that there is here described a king who was neither
given to ambition, nor inflamed with avarice, nor actuated by the desire
of whatever the unruly passions might *suggest,* but wholly intent on
the charge which was committed to him, and entirely devoted to the
advancement of the public good; so that he asks nothing but what the
Holy Spirit dictated to him, and what God, by his own mouth, commanded
him to ask.

<span id="xxvi.ii-p7"></span><span id="xxvi.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.ii-p8"></span>**5.** *That we may rejoice in thy
salvation.* This verse may be explained in two other ways, besides the
sense it bears according to the translation which I have given. Some
consider it to be a prayer, as if it had been said, Lord, make us to
rejoice. Others think that the faithful, after having finished their
prayer, encourage themselves to entertain good hope;  <span
id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) or rather, being already inspired with
an assured hope of success, they begin to sing, so to speak, of the
victory, even as it is usual with David to intermingle such kind of
rejoicings with his prayers, thereby to stir up himself to continue with
the more alacrity in prayer. But upon considering the whole more
carefully, my opinion is, that what is meant to be expressed is the
effect or fruit which would result from the bestowment of the grace and
favor of God, for which the people prayed; and, therefore, I have
thought it necessary to supply the particle *that,* in the beginning of
the verse. The faithful, as an argument to obtain the favor of God
towards their king, set forth the joy which they would all experience in
common, in seeing it exercised towards him, and the thanksgiving which
they would with one accord render for it. The import of their language
is, It is not for the preservation and welfare of one man that we are
solicitous; it is for the safety and well-being of the whole Church. The
expression, *In thy salvation,* may be referred to God as well as to the
king; for the salvation which God bestows is often called *the salvation
of God;* but the context requires that it should be rather understood of
the king. The people lived “under the shadow of the king,” to use the
words of Jeremiah, (<span id="xxvi.ii-p9.1"></span>[La
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020)<span id="xxvi.ii-p9.1"></span>;.md)
and, therefore, the faithful now testify, that as long as he is safe and
in prosperity, they will all be joyful and happy. At the same time, to
distinguish their joy from the heathen dancings and rejoicings, they
declare that they will set up their banners in the name of God; for the
Hebrew word <span id="xxvi.ii-p9.2"></span>דגל, *dagal,* here used,
means *to set* or *lift up a banner.* The meaning is, that the faithful,
in grateful acknowledgement of the grace of God, will celebrate his
praises and triumph in his name.

<span id="xxvi.iii"></span>

<span id="xxvi.iii-p1"></span><span id="xxvi.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
20:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#006.md)<span id="xxvi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.iii-p2"></span>**6.** Now I know that Jehovah hath saved
his anointed; he will hear him from the heavens of his sanctuary, in the
mightiness of the salvation of his right hand.  <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) **7.** Some trust  <span
id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) in chariots, and some in horses; but
we will remember the name of Jehovah our God. **8.** They are bowed down
and are fallen; but we are risen and are erect. **9.** Save, O Jehovah!
let the king hear us in the day that we call upon him.

<span id="xxvi.iii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxvi.iii-p6"></span><span id="xxvi.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.iii-p7"></span>**6.** *Now I know.* Here there follows
grateful rejoicing, in which the faithful declare that they have
experienced the goodness of God in the preservation of the king. To this
there is at the same time added a doctrine of faith, namely, that God
showed by the effect that he put forth his power in maintaining the
kingdom of David, because it was founded upon his calling. The meaning
is, It appears from certain experience, that God is the guardian of the
kingdom which he himself set up, and of which he is the founder. For
David is called Messiah, or *anointed,* that the faithful might be
persuaded that he was a lawful and sacred king, whom God had testified,
by outward anointing, to be chosen by himself. Thus, then, the faithful
ascribe to the grace of God the deliverance which had been wrought for
David from the greatest dangers, and at the same time, particularly
mention the cause of this to be, that God had determined to protect and
defend him who, by his commandment, had been anointed king over his
people. They confirm still more clearly their hope, with respect to the
future, in the following clause: *God will hear him out of heaven* I do
not translate the verb which is here used into the past tense, but
retain the future: for I have no doubt, that from the experience which
God had already given them of his goodness, they concluded that it would
be hereafter exercised in the continual preservation of the kingdom.
Here the Psalmist makes mention of another *sanctuary,*  <span
id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md) namely, a heavenly. As God then
graciously vouchsafed to descend among the Israelites, by the ark of the
covenant, in order to make himself more familiarly known to them; so, on
the other hand, he intended to draw the minds of his people upwards to
himself, and thereby to prevent them from forming carnal and earthly
conceptions of his character, and to teach them that he was greater than
the whole world. Thus, under the visible sanctuary, which was made with
hands, there is set forth the fatherly goodness of God, and his
familiarity with his people; while, under the heavenly sanctuary, there
is shown his infinite power, dominion, and majesty. The words, *In the
mightiness of the salvation,* mean *his mighty salvation,* or *his
saving power.* Thus, in the very expression there is a transposing of
the words. The sense comes to this: May God by his wonderful power,
preserve the king who was anointed by his commandment! The Holy Spirit,
who dictated this prayer, saw well that Satan would not suffer David to
live in peace, but would put forth all his efforts to oppose him, which
would render it necessary for him to be sustained by more than human
power. I do not, however, disapprove of the other exposition which I
have marked on the margin, according to which the faithful, for their
greater encouragement, set before themselves this truth, that the
salvation of God’s right hand is in mightiness; in other words, is
sufficiently strong to overcome all impediments.

<span id="xxvi.iii-p9"></span><span id="xxvi.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.iii-p10"></span>**7.** *Some trust in chariots.* I do not
restrict this to the enemies of Israel, as is done by other
interpreters. I am rather inclined to think that there is here a
comparison between the people of God and all the rest of the world. We
see how natural it is to almost all men to be the more courageous and
confident the more they possess of riches, power and military forces.
The people of God, therefore, here protest that they do not place their
hope, as is the usual way with men, in their military forces and warlike
apparatus, but only in the aid of God. As the Holy Spirit here sets the
assistance of God in opposition to human strength, it ought to be
particularly noticed, that whenever our minds come to be occupied by
carnal confidence, they fall at the same time into a forgetfulness of
God. It is impossible for him, who promises himself victory by confiding
in his own strength, to have his eyes turned towards God. The inspired
writer, therefore, uses the word *remember,* to show, that when the
saints betake themselves to God, they must cast off every thing which
would hinder them from placing an exclusive trust in him. This
remembrance of God serves two important purposes to the faithful. In the
first place, however much power and resources they may possess, it
nevertheless withdraws them from all vain confidence, so that they do
not expect any success except from the pure grace of God. In the second
place, if they are bereft and utterly destitute of all succor, it
notwithstanding so strengthens and encourages them, that they call upon
God both with confidence and constancy. On the other hand, when ungodly
men feel themselves strong and powerful, being blinded with pride, they
do not hesitate boldly to despise God; but when they are brought into
circumstances of distress, they are so terrified as not to know what to
become. In short, the Holy Spirit here recommends to us the remembrance
of God, which, retaining its efficacy both in the want and in the
abundance of power, subdues the vain hopes with which the flesh is wont
to be inflated. As the verb <span id="xxvi.iii-p10.1"></span>נזכיר,
*nazkir,* which I have translated *we will remember,* is in the
conjugation *hiphil,* some render it transitively, *we shall cause to
remember.* But it is no new thing in Hebrew for verbs to be used as
neuter which are properly transitive; and, therefore, I have adopted the
exposition which seems to me the most suitable to this passage.

<span id="xxvi.iii-p11"></span><span id="xxvi.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.iii-p12"></span>**8.** *They are bowed down.* It is
probable that there is here pointed out, as it were with the finger, the
enemies of Israel, whom God had overthrown, when they regarded no event
as less likely to happen. There is contained in the words a tacit
contrast between the cruel pride with which they had been lifted up for
a time when they audaciously rushed forward to make havoc of all things
on the one hand, and the oppression of the people of God on the other.
The expression, *to rise,* is applied only to those who were before sunk
or fallen; and, on the other hand, the expression, *bowed down and
fallen,* is with propriety applied to those who were lifted up with
pride and presumption. The prophet therefore teaches by the event, how
much more advantageous it is for us to place all our confidence in God
than to depend upon our own strength.

<span id="xxvi.iii-p13"></span><span id="xxvi.iii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.iii-p14"></span>**9.** *Save, O Jehovah! etc.* Some read
in one sentence, *O Jehovah! save the king;*  <span
id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md) perhaps because they think it wrong to
attribute to an earthly king what is proper to God only, — to be called
upon, and to hear prayer. But if we turn our eyes towards Christ, as it
becomes us to do, we will no longer wonder that what properly belongs to
him is attributed in a certain sense to David and his successors, in so
far as they were types of Christ. As God governs and saves us by the
hand of Christ, we must not look for salvation from any other quarter.
In like manner, the faithful under the former economy were accustomed to
betake themselves to their king as the minister of God’s saving grace.
Hence these words of Jeremiah,

<span id="xxvi.iii-p16"></span>“The breath of our nostrils, the anointed
of the Lord, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the
heathen.” (<span id="xxvi.iii-p16.1"></span>[La
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020)<span id="xxvi.iii-p16.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xxvi.iii-p17"></span>Whenever, therefore, God promises the
restoration of his church, he sets forth a symbol or pledge of its
salvation in the kingdom. We now see that it is not without very good
reason that the faithful are introduced asking succor from their king,
under whose guardianship and protection they were placed, and who, as
the vicegerent of God, presided over them; as the Prophet Micah says,
(<span id="xxvi.iii-p17.1"></span>[Mic
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#013.md)<span
id="xxvi.iii-p17.1"></span>,) “Their king shall pass before them, and
the Lord on the head of them;” by which words he intimates, that their
king will be as it were a mirror in which they may see reflected the
image of God. To return to the present passage:— The expression, *Save,
O Jehovah,* is elliptical, but it has greater emphasis than if the
object for which salvation is sought had been mentioned; for by this
means David shows that this salvation belongs in common to the whole
body of the church. In <span id="xxvi.iii-p17.2"></span>[Ps
118:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#025.md)<span
id="xxvi.iii-p17.2"></span>, there is a prayer in the same words, and it
is certain that it is the very same prayer. In short, this is a prayer,
that God, by blessing the king, would show himself the Savior of the
whole people. In the last clause of the verse there is expressed the
means of this salvation. The people pray that the king may be furnished
with power from God to deliver them whenever they are in distress, and
cry to him for help. *Let the king hear us in the day that we call upon
him.* God had not promised that his people would be saved in any other
way than by the hand and conduct of the king whom he had given them. In
the present day, when Christ is now manifested to us, let us learn to
yield him this honor — to renounce all hope of salvation from any other
quarter, and to trust to that salvation only which he shall bring to us
from God his Father. And of this we shall then only become partakers
when, being all gathered together into one body, under the same Head, we
shall have mutual care one of another, and when none of us will have his
attention so engrossed with his own advantage and individual interest,
as to be indifferent to the welfare and happiness of others.
