*Calvin's Commentaries, Vol. 8: Psalms, Part I*, tr. by John King,
\[1847-50\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="xxii"></span>

<span id="xxii-p1"></span>PSALM 16.

<span id="xxii-p2"></span>In the beginning David commends himself to the
protection of God. He then meditates upon the benefits which he received
from God, and thereby stirs himself up to thanksgiving. By his service,
it is true, he could in no respect be profitable to God, but he,
notwithstanding, surrenders and devotes himself entirely to him,
protesting that he will have nothing to do with superstitions. He also
states the reason of this to be, that full and substantial happiness
consists in resting in God alone, who never suffers his own people to
want any good thing.

<span id="xxii-p3"></span>Mictam of David.

<span id="xxii-p4"></span>As to the meaning of the word *mictam,* the
Jewish expositors are not of one mind. Some derive it from <span
id="xxii-p4.1"></span>כתם, *catham,*  <span
id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) as if it were a golden crest or jewel.
Others think it is the beginning of a song, which at that time was very
common. To others it seems rather to be some kind of tune, and this
opinion I am inclined to adopt.

<span id="xxii.i"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p1"></span><span id="xxii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#001.md)<span id="xxii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Keep \[or guard  <span
id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) \] me, O God; for in thee do I trust.
 <span id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md)

<span id="xxii.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxii.i-p6"></span><span id="xxii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p7"></span>This is a prayer in which David commits
himself to the protection of God. He does not, however, here implore the
aid of God, in some particular emergency, as he often does in other
psalms, but he beseeches him to show himself his protector during the
whole course of his life, and indeed our safety both in life and in
death depends entirely upon our being under the protection of God. What
follows concerning *trust,* signifies much the same thing as if the Holy
Spirit assured us by the mouth of David, that God is ready to succor all
of us, provided we rely upon him with a sure and steadfast faith; and
that he takes under his protection none but those who commit themselves
to him with their whole heart. At the same time, we must be reminded
that David, supported by this trust, continued firm and unmoved amidst
all the storms of adversity with which he was buffeted.

<span id="xxii.ii"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
16:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md)<span id="xxii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p2"></span>**2.** Thou shalt say unto Jehovah, Thou
art my Lord, my well-doing extendeth not unto thee. **3.** Unto the
saints who are on the earth, and to the excellent; all my delight is in
them.

<span id="xxii.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxii.ii-p4"></span><span id="xxii.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p5"></span>**2.** *Thou shalt say unto Jehovah.* David
begins by stating that he can bestow nothing upon God, not only because
God stands in no need of any thing, but also because mortal man cannot
merit the favor of God by any service which he can perform to him. At
the same time, however, he takes courage, and, as God accepts our
devotion, and the service which we yield to him, David protests that he
will be one of his servants. To encourage himself the more effectually
to this duty he speaks to his own soul; for the Hebrew word which is
rendered *Thou shalt say,* is of the feminine gender, which can refer
only to the soul.  <span id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) Some may
prefer reading the word in the past tense, *Thou hast said,* which I
think is unobjectionable, for the Psalmist is speaking of an affliction
which had a continued abode in his soul. The import of his language is,
I am, indeed, fully convinced in my heart, and know assuredly, that God
can derive no profit or advantage from me; but notwithstanding this, I
will join myself in fellowship with the saints, that with one accord we
may worship him by the sacrifices of praise. Two things are distinctly
laid down in this verse. The first is, that God has a right to require
of us whatever he pleases, seeing we are wholly bound to Him as our
rightful proprietor and Lord. David, by ascribing to him the power and
the dominion of *Lord,* declares that both himself and all he possessed
are the property of God. The other particular contained in this verse
is, the acknowledgement which the Psalmist makes of his own indigence.
*My well-doing extendeth not unto thee.* Interpreters expound this last
clause in two ways. As <span id="xxii.ii-p6.2"></span>עליך, *aleyka,*
may be rendered *upon thee,* some draw from it this sense, that God is
not brought under obligation, or in the least degree indebted to us, by
any good deeds which we may perform to him; and they understand the term
*goodness* in a passive sense, as if David affirmed that whatever
goodness he received from God did not proceed from any obligation he had
laid God under, or from any merit which he possessed. But I think the
sentence has a more extensive meaning, namely, that let men strive ever
so much to lay themselves out for God, yet they can bring no advantage
to him. Our goodness extendeth not to him, not only because, having in
himself alone an all-sufficiency, he stands in need of nothing,  <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md) but also because we are empty and
destitute of all good things, and have nothing with which to show
ourselves liberal towards him. From this doctrine, however, the other
point which I have before touched upon will follow, namely, that it is
impossible for men, by any merits of their own, to bring God under
obligation to them, so as to make him their debtor. The sum of the
discourse is, that when we come before God, we must lay aside all
presumption. When we imagine that there is any good thing in us, we need
not wonder if he reject us, as we thus take away from him a principal
part of the honor which is his due. But, on the contrary, if we
acknowledge that all the services which we can yield him are in
themselves things of nought, and undeserving of any recompense, this
humility is as a perfume of a sweet odour, which will procure for them
acceptance with God.

<span id="xxii.ii-p8"></span><span id="xxii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p9"></span>**3.** *Unto the saints who are on the
earth.* Almost all are agreed in understanding this place, as if David,
after the sentence which we have just now been considering, had added,
The only way of serving God aright is to endeavor to do good to his holy
servants. And the truth is, that God, as our good deeds cannot extend to
him, substitutes the saints in his place, towards whom we are to
exercise our charity. When men, therefore, mutually exert themselves in
doing good to one another, this is to yield to God right and acceptable
service. We ought, doubtless, to extend our charity even to those who
are unworthy of it, as our heavenly Father

<span id="xxii.ii-p10"></span>“maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on
the good,” (<span id="xxii.ii-p10.1"></span>[Mt
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045)<span id="xxii.ii-p10.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="xxii.ii-p11"></span>but David justly prefers the saints to
others, and places them in a higher rank. This, then, as I have said in
the commencement, is the common opinion of almost all interpreters.
 <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) But although I do not deny that
this doctrine is comprehended under the words of David, I think he goes
somewhat farther, and intimates that he will unite himself with the
devout worshippers of God, and be their associate or companion; even as
all the children of God ought to be joined together by the bond of
fraternal unity, that they may all serve and call upon their common
Father with the same affection and zeal.  <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) We thus see that David, after having
confessed that he can find nothing in himself to bring to God, seeing he
is indebted to him for every thing which he has, sets his affections
upon the saints, because it is the will of God that, in this world, he
should be magnified and exalted in the assembly of the just, whom he has
adopted into his family for this end, that they may live together with
one accord under his authority, and under the guidance of his Holy
Spirit. This passage, therefore, teaches us that there is no sacrifice
more acceptable to God than when we sincerely and heartily connect
ourselves with the society of the righteous, and being knit together by
the sacred bond of godliness, cultivate and maintain with them brotherly
good-will. In this consists the communion of saints which separates them
from the degrading pollutions of the world, that they may be the holy
and peculiar people of God. He expressly speaks of *the saints who are
on the earth,* because it is the will of God that, even in this world,
there should be conspicuous marks, and as it were visible escutcheons,
 <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) of his glory, which may serve
to conduct us to himself. The faithful, therefore, bear his image, that,
by their example, we may be stirred up to meditation upon the heavenly
life. For the same reason, the Psalmist calls them *excellent,* or
honorable, because there is nothing which ought to be more precious to
us than righteousness and holiness, in which the brightness of God’s
Spirit shines forth; just as we are commanded in the preceding psalm to
prize and honor those who fear God. We ought, therefore, highly to value
and esteem the true and devoted servants of God, and to regard nothing
as of greater importance than to connect ourselves with their society;
and this we will actually do if we wisely reflect in what true
excellence and dignity consist, and do not allow the vain splendor of
the world and its deceitful pomps to dazzle our eyes.

<span id="xxii.iii"></span>

<span id="xxii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xxii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004.md)<span id="xxii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.iii-p2"></span>**4.** Their sorrows shall be multiplied
who offer to a stranger.  <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) I will
not taste  <span id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) their libations
 <span id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) of blood, nor will I take their
names in my lips.

<span id="xxii.iii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xxii.iii-p7"></span><span id="xxii.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.iii-p8"></span>The Psalmist now describes the true way of
maintaining brotherly concord with the saints, by declaring that he will
have nothing to do with unbelievers and the superstitious. We cannot be
united into the one body of the Church under God, if we do not break off
all the bonds of impiety, separate ourselves from idolaters, and keep
ourselves pure and at a distance from all the pollutions which corrupt
and vitiate the holy service of God. This is certainly the general drift
of David’s discourse. But as to the words there is a diversity of
opinion among expositors. Some translate the first word of the verse
<span id="xxii.iii-p8.1"></span>עצבות, *atsboth,* by *idols,*  <span
id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) and according to this rendering the
meaning is, that after men in their folly have once begun to make to
themselves false gods, their madness breaks forth without measure, until
they accumulate an immense multitude of deities. As, however, this word
is here put in the feminine gender, I prefer translating it *sorrows or
troubles,* although it may still have various meanings. Some think it is
an imprecation, and they read, *Let their sorrows be multiplied;* as if
David, inflamed with a holy zeal, denounced the just vengeance of God
against the superstitious. Others, whose opinions I prefer, do not
change the tense of the verb, which in the Hebrew is future, *Their
sorrows shall be multiplied;* but to me they do not seem to express,
with sufficient clearness, what kind of sorrows David intends. They say,
indeed, that wretched idolaters are perpetually adding to their new
inventions, in doing which, they miserably torment themselves. But I am
of opinion, that by this word there is, at the same time, denoted the
end and issue of the pains which they take in committing it; it points
out that they not only put themselves to trouble without any profit or
advantage, but also miserably harass and busy themselves to accomplish
their own destruction. As an incitement to him to withdraw himself
farther from their company, he takes this as an incontrovertible
principle, that, so far from deriving any advantage from their vain
superstitions, they only, by their strenuous efforts in practising them,
involve themselves in greater misery and wretchedness. For what must be
the issue with respect to those miserable men who willingly surrender
themselves as bond-slaves to the devil, but to be disappointed of their
hope? even as God complains in Jeremiah, (<span
id="xxii.iii-p9.8"></span>[Jer
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#013)<span id="xxii.iii-p9.8"></span>,.md)

<span id="xxii.iii-p10"></span>“They have forsaken me the fountain of
living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can
hold no water.”

<span id="xxii.iii-p11"></span>In the next clause there is also some
ambiguity. The Hebrew word <span id="xxii.iii-p11.1"></span>מהר,
*mahar,* which we have translated *to offer,* in the conjugation *kal*
signifies *to endow,* or *to give.* But as, in the conjugation *hiphil,*
it is more frequently taken for *to run,* or *to make haste,*  <span
id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) many have preferred this latter
meaning, and interpret the clause thus, that superstitious persons
eagerly hasten after strange gods. And in fact we see them rushing into
their idolatries with all the impetuosity and recklessness of madmen
running in the fields;  <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) and the
prophets often upbraid them for this inconsiderate frenzy with which
they are fired. I would, therefore, be much disposed to adopt this sense
were it supported by the common usage of the language; but as
grammarians observe that there is not to be found another similar
passage in Scripture, I have followed, in my translation, the first
opinion. In short, the sum of what the Psalmist says is this, That
unbelievers, who lavish and squander away their substance upon their
idols, not only lose all the gifts and offerings which they present to
them, but also, by provoking the wrath of God against themselves, are
continually increasing the amount of their miseries. Perhaps, also, the
prophet has an allusion to the common doctrine of Scripture, that
idolaters violate the promise of the spiritual marriage contracted with
the true God, and enter into covenant with idols.  <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) Ezekiel (<span
id="xxii.iii-p16.1"></span>[Eze
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#033.md)<span
id="xxii.iii-p16.1"></span>) justly upbraids the Jews, in that while the
custom is for the lover to allure the harlot with presents, they, on the
contrary, offered rewards to the idols to whom they prostituted and
abandoned themselves. But the meaning which we have above given brings
out the spirit of the passage, namely, that unbelievers, who honor their
false gods by offering to them gifts, not only lose what is thus
expended, but also heap up for themselves sorrows upon sorrows, because
at last the issue will be miserable and ruinous to them.

<span id="xxii.iii-p17"></span>*I will not taste their libations of
blood.* By libations of blood some understand that there is a reference
to sacrifices made of things acquired by murder or rapine. As, however,
the prophet is not here inveighing against cruel and bloodthirsty men,
but condemns, in general, all false and corrupt religious worship; and
again, as he does not directly name sacrifices, but expressly speaks of
the ceremony of taking the cup, and tasting a little of it, which was
observed in offering sacrifices,  <span
id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md) I have no doubt but that to this
ceremony, as it was observed according to the law of God, he here
tacitly opposes the drinking of blood in heathen sacrifices. We know
that God, in order to teach his ancient people to hold in greater
abhorrence murder and all cruelty, forbade them to eat or to drink blood
either in their common food or in sacrifices. On the contrary, the
histories of the heathen nations bear testimony that the custom of
tasting the blood in their sacrifices prevailed among them. David,
therefore, protests, that he will not only keep himself uncontaminated
by the corrupt and false opinions by which idolaters are seduced, but
that he will also take care not to show outwardly any token of his
complying with or approving them. In the same sense we are to understand
what follows immediately after, *I will not take their names in my
lips.* This implies that he will hold idols in such hatred and
detestation, as to keep himself from naming them as from execrable
treason against the majesty of heaven. Not that it is unlawful to
pronounce their names, which we frequently meet with in the writings of
the prophets, but David felt he could not otherwise more forcibly
express the supreme horror and detestation with which the faithful ought
to regard false gods. This is also shown by the form of expression which
he employs, using the relative only, *their names,* although he has not
expressly stated before that he is speaking of idols. Thus, by his
example, he enjoins believers not only to beware of errors and wicked
opinions, but also to abstain from all appearance of giving their
consent to them. He evidently speaks of external ceremonies, which
indicate either the true religion, or some perverse superstition. If,
then, it is unlawful for the faithful to show any token of consenting to
or complying with the superstitions of idolaters, Nicodemuses (who
falsely call themselves by this name  <span
id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317) .md) must not think to shelter themselves
under the frivolous pretext that they have not renounced the faith, but
keep it hidden within their hearts, when they join in the observance of
the profane superstitions of the Papists. Some understand the words
*strangers* and *their names,* as denoting the worshippers of false
gods; but in my judgment David rather means the false gods themselves.
The scope of his discourse is this: The earth is filled with an immense
accumulation  <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md) of superstitions
in every possible variety, and idolaters are lavish beyond all bounds in
ornamenting their idols; but the good and the holy will ever regard all
their superstitious inventions with abhorrence.

<span id="xxii.iv"></span>

<span id="xxii.iv-p1"></span><span id="xxii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
16:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#005.md)<span id="xxii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.iv-p2"></span>**5.** Jehovah is the portion of mine
inheritance, and of my cup; thou sustainest my lot. **6.** The lines
have fallen to me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.

<span id="xxii.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxii.iv-p4"></span><span id="xxii.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.iv-p5"></span>**5.** *The Lord is the portion of mine
inheritance.* Here the Psalmist explains his sentiments more clearly. He
shows the reason why he separates himself from idolaters, and resolves
to continue in the church of God, why he shuns, with abhorrence, all
participation in their errors, and cleaves to the pure worship of God;
namely, because he rests in the only true God as his portion. The
unhappy restlessness of those blind idolaters  <span
id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) whom we see going astray, and running
about as if stricken and impelled by madness, is doubtless to be traced
to their destitution of the true knowledge of God. All who have not
their foundation and trust in God must necessarily be often in a state
of irresolution and uncertainty; and those who do not hold the true
faith in such a manner as to be guided and governed by it, must be often
carried away by the overflowing floods of errors which prevail in the
world.  <span id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) This passage teaches us,
that none are taught aright in true godliness but those who reckon God
alone sufficient for their happiness. David, by calling God *the portion
of his lot,* and *his inheritance,* and *his cup,* protests that he is
so fully satisfied with him alone, as neither to covet any thing besides
him, nor to be excited by any depraved desires. Let us therefore learn,
when God offers himself to us, to embrace him with the whole heart, and
to seek in him only all the ingredients and the fullness of our
happiness. All the superstitions which have ever prevailed in the world
have undoubtedly proceeded from this source, that superstitious men have
not been contented with possessing God alone. But we do not actually
possess him unless “he is the portion of our inheritance;” in other
words, unless we are wholly devoted to him, so as no longer to have any
desire unfaithfully to depart from him. For this reason, God, when he
upbraids the Jews who had wandered from him as apostates,  <span
id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md) with having run about after idols,
addresses them thus, “Let them be thine inheritance, and thy portion.”
By these words he shows, that if we do not reckon him alone an
all-sufficient portion for us, and if we will have idols along with him,
 <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) he gives place entirely to
them, and lets them have the full possession of our hearts. David here
employs three metaphors; he first compares God to an inheritance;
secondly, to a cup; and, thirdly, he represents him as He who defends
and keeps him in possession of his inheritance. By the first metaphor he
alludes to the heritages of the land of Canaan, which we know were
divided among the Jews by divine appointment, and the law commanded
every one to be content with the portion which had fallen to him. By the
word *cup* is denoted either the revenue of his own proper inheritance,
or by synecdoche, ordinary food by which life is sustained, seeing drink
is a part of our nourishment.  <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md)
It is as if David had said, God is mine both in respect of property and
enjoyment. Nor is the third comparison superfluous. It often happens
that rightful owners are put out of their possession because no one
defends them. But while God has given himself to us for an inheritance,
he has engaged to exercise his power in maintaining us in the safe
enjoyment of a good so inconceivably great. It would be of little
advantage to us to have once obtained him as ours, if he did not secure
our possession of him against the assaults which Satan daily makes upon
us. Some explain the third clause as if it had been said, *Thou art my
ground in which my portion is situated;* but this sense appears to me to
be cold and unsatisfactory.

<span id="xxii.iv-p11"></span><span id="xxii.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.iv-p12"></span>**6.** *The lines*  <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) *have fallen to me.* The Psalmist
confirms more fully what he had already said in the preceding verse with
respect to his resting, with a composed and tranquil mind, in God alone;
or rather, he so glories in God as nobly to despise all that the world
imagines to be excellent and desirable without him. By magnifying God in
such honorable and exalted strains, he gives us to understand that he
does not desire any thing more as his portion and felicity. This
doctrine may be profitable to us in many ways. It ought to draw us away
not only from all the perverse inventions of superstition, but also from
all the allurements of the flesh and of the world. Whenever, therefore,
those things present themselves to us which would lead us away from
resting in God alone, let us make use of this sentiment as an antidote
against them, that we have sufficient cause for being contented, since
he who has in himself an absolute fullness of all good has given himself
to be enjoyed by us. In this way we will experience our condition to be
always pleasant and comfortable; for he who has God as his portion is
destitute of nothing which is requisite to constitute a happy life.

<span id="xxii.v"></span>

<span id="xxii.v-p1"></span><span id="xxii.v-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#007.md)<span id="xxii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.v-p2"></span>**7.** I will magnify Jehovah, who giveth me
counsel; even in the night my reins instruct me.  <span
id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md)

<span id="xxii.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxii.v-p5"></span><span id="xxii.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.v-p6"></span>Last of all, David confesses that it was
entirely owing to the pure grace of God that he had come to possess so
great a good, and that he had been made a partaker of it by faith. It
would be of no advantage to us for God to offer himself freely and
graciously to us, if we did not receive him by faith, seeing he invites
to himself both the reprobate and the elect in common; but the former,
by their ingratitude, defraud themselves of this inestimable blessing.
Let us, therefore, know that both these things proceed from the free
liberality of God; first, his being our inheritance, and next, our
coming to the possession of him by faith. The *counsel* of which David
makes mention is the inward illumination of the Holy Spirit, by which we
are prevented from rejecting the salvation to which he calls us, which
we would otherwise certainly do, considering the blindness of our flesh.
 <span id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) Whence we gather, that those
who attribute to the free will of man the choice of accepting or
rejecting the grace of God basely mangle that grace, and show as much
ignorance as impiety. That this discourse of David ought not to be
understood of external teaching appears clearly from the words, for he
tells us that *he was instructed in the night* when he was removed from
the sight of men. Again, when he speaks of this being done *in his
reins,* he doubtless means secret inspirations.  <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md) Farther, it ought to be carefully
observed, that, in speaking of the time when he was instructed, he uses
the plural number, saying, it was done in the *nights.* By this manner
of speaking, he not only ascribes to God the beginning of faith, but
acknowledges that he is continually making progress under his tuition;
and, indeed, it is necessary for God, during the whole of our life, to
continue to correct the vanity of our minds, to kindle the light of
faith into a brighter flame, and by every means to advance us higher in
the attainments of spiritual wisdom.

<span id="xxii.vi"></span>

<span id="xxii.vi-p1"></span><span id="xxii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
16:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#008.md)<span id="xxii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.vi-p2"></span>**8.** I have set Jehovah continually
before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. **9.**
Therefore my heart  <span id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md) is glad, my
tongue rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in confidence, \[or in
security.\]

<span id="xxii.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxii.vi-p5"></span><span id="xxii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.vi-p6"></span>**8.** *I have set Jehovah, etc.* The
Psalmist again shows the firmness and stability of his faith. To set God
before us is nothing else than to keep all our senses bound and captive,
that they may not run out and go astray after any other object. We must
look to him with other eyes than those of the flesh, for we shall seldom
be able to perceive him unless we elevate our minds above the world; and
faith prevents us from turning our back upon him. The meaning,
therefore, is, that David kept his mind so intently fixed upon the
providence of God, as to be fully persuaded, that whenever any
difficulty or distress should befall him, God would be always at hand to
assist him. He adds, also, *continually,* to show us how he constantly
depended upon the assistance of God, so that, amidst the various
conflicts with which he was agitated, no fear of danger could make him
turn his eyes to any other quarter than to God in search of succor. And
thus we ought so to depend upon God as to continue to be fully persuaded
of his being near to us, even when he seems to be removed to the
greatest distance from us. When we shall have thus turned our eyes
towards him, the masks and the vain illusions of this world will no
longer deceive us.

<span id="xxii.vi-p7"></span>*Because he is at my right hand.* I read
this second clause as a distinct sentence from the preceding. To connect
them together as some do in this way, *I have set the Lord continually
before me, because he is at my right hand,* would give a meagre meaning
to the words, and take away much of the truth which is taught in them,
as it would make David to say, that he measured God’s presence according
to the experience he had of it; a mode of speaking which would not be at
all becoming. I consider, therefore, the words, *I have set the Lord
continually before me,* as a complete sentence, and David set the Lord
before him for the purpose of constantly repairing to him in all his
dangers. For his greater encouragement to hope well, he sets before
himself what it is to have God’s assistance and fatherly care, namely,
that it implies his keeping firm and unmoved his own people with whom he
is present. David then reckons himself secure against all dangers, and
promises himself certain safety, because, with the eyes of faith, he
beholds God as present with him. From this passage we are furnished with
an argument which overthrows the fabrication of the Sorbonists,  <span
id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329.md) *that the faithful are in doubt with
respect to their final perseverance;* for David, in very plain terms,
extends his reliance on the grace of God to the time to come. And,
certainly, it would be a very miserable condition to be in, to tremble
in uncertainty every moment, having no assurance of the continuance of
the grace of God towards us.

<span id="xxii.vi-p9"></span><span id="xxii.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.vi-p10"></span>**9.** *Therefore my heart is glad.* In
this verse the Psalmist commends the inestimable fruit of faith, of
which Scripture every where makes mention, in that, by placing us under
the protection of God, it makes us not only to live in the enjoyment of
mental tranquillity, but, what is more, to live joyful and cheerful. The
principal, the essential part of a happy life, as we know, is to possess
tranquillity of conscience and of mind; as, on the contrary, there is no
greater infelicity than to be tossed amidst a multiplicity of cares and
fears.

<span id="xxii.vi-p11"></span>But the ungodly, however much intoxicated
with the spirit of thoughtlessness or stupidity, never experience true
joy or serene mental peace; they rather feel terrible agitations within,
which often come upon them and trouble them, so much as to constrain
them to awake from their lethargy. In short, calmly to rejoice is the
lot of no man but of him who has learned to place his confidence in God
alone, and to commit his life and safety to his protection. When,
therefore, encompassed with innumerable troubles on all sides, let us be
persuaded, that the only remedy is to direct our eyes towards God; and
if we do this, faith will not only tranquillise our minds, but also
replenish them with fullness of joy. David, however, not only affirms
that he is glad inwardly; he also makes his *tongue,* yea, even his
*flesh,* sharers of this joy. And not without cause, for true believers
not only have this spiritual joy in the secret affection of their heart,
but also manifest it by the tongue, inasmuch as they glory in God as He
who protects them and secures their salvation. The word <span
id="xxii.vi-p11.1"></span>כבוד, *kabod,* properly signifies glory and
excellence. I have, however, no doubt of its being here taken for *the
tongue,*  <span id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330.md) as it is in <span
id="xxii.vi-p12.4"></span>[Ge
49:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#006.md)<span id="xxii.vi-p12.4"></span>;
for otherwise the division which is obviously made in this verse of the
person into three parts is not so distinct and evident. Farther,
although the body is not free from inconveniences and troubles, yet as
God defends and maintains not only our souls, but also our bodies, David
does not speak groundlessly when he represents the blessing of dwelling
in safety as extending to his flesh in common with his soul.

<span id="xxii.vii"></span>

<span id="xxii.vii-p1"></span><span id="xxii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
16:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#010.md)<span id="xxii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.vii-p2"></span>**10.** For thou wilt not leave my soul in
the grave; neither wilt thou make thy Holy One to see the pit.  <span
id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md)

<span id="xxii.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxii.vii-p5"></span><span id="xxii.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.vii-p6"></span>The Psalmist goes on to explain still more
fully the preceding doctrine, by declaring that as he is not afraid of
death, there is nothing wanting which is requisite to the completion of
his joy. Whence it follows, that no one truly trusts in God but he who
takes such hold of the salvation which God has promised him as to
despise death. Moreover, it is to be observed, that David’s language is
not to be limited to some particular kind of deliverance, as in <span
id="xxii.vii-p6.1"></span>[Ps
49:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa049.htm#015.md)<span id="xxii.vii-p6.1"></span>,
where he says, “God hath redeemed my soul from the power of the grave,”
and in other similar passages; but he entertains the undoubted assurance
of eternal salvation, which freed him from all anxiety and fear. It is
as if he had said, There will always be ready for me a way of escape
from the grave, that I may not remain in corruption. God, in delivering
his people from any danger, prolongs their life only for a short time;
but how slender and how empty a consolation would it be to obtain some
brief respite, and to take breath for a short time, until death, coming
at last, should terminate the course of our life,  <span
id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md) and swallow us up without any hope of
deliverance? Hence it appears that when David spake thus, he raised his
mind above the common lot of mankind. As the sentence has been
pronounced upon all the children of Adam, “Dust thou art, and unto dust
shalt thou return,” (<span id="xxii.vii-p7.2"></span>[Ge
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#019)<span id="xxii.vii-p7.2"></span>,.md)
the same condition in this respect awaits them all without exception.
If, therefore, Christ, who is the first-fruits of those who rise again,
does not come forth from the grave, they will remain for ever under the
bondage of corruption. From this Peter justly concludes, (<span
id="xxii.vii-p7.3"></span>[Ac
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030)<span id="xxii.vii-p7.3"></span>,.md)
that David could not have gloried in this manner but by the spirit of
prophecy; and unless he had had a special respect to the Author of life,
who was promised to him, who alone was to be honored with this privilege
in its fullest sense. This, however, did not prevent David from assuring
himself of exemption from the dominion of death by right, seeing Christ,
by his rising from the dead, obtained immortality not for himself
individually, but for us all. As to the point, that Peter (<span
id="xxii.vii-p7.4"></span>[Ac
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#030)<span id="xxii.vii-p7.4"></span>.md)
and Paul (<span id="xxii.vii-p7.5"></span>[Ac
13:33](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#033)<span id="xxii.vii-p7.5"></span>.md)
contend that this prophecy was fulfilled in the person of Christ alone,
 <span id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md) the sense in which we must
understand them is this, that he was wholly and perfectly exempted from
the corruption of the grave, that he might call his members into his
fellowship, and make them partakers of this blessing,  <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) although by degrees, and each
according to his measure. As the body of David, after death, was, in the
course of time, reduced to dust, the apostles justly conclude that he
was not exempted from corruption. It is the same with respect to all the
faithful, not one of whom becomes a partaker of incorruptible life
without being first subjected to corruption. From this it follows that
the fullness of life which resides in the head alone, namely, in Christ,
falls down upon the members only in drops, or in small portions. The
question, however, may be asked, as Christ descended into the grave, was
not he also subject to corruption? The answer is easy. The etymology or
derivation of the two words here used to express the grave should be
carefully attended to. The grave is called <span
id="xxii.vii-p9.2"></span>שאול, *sheol,* being as it were an insatiable
gulf, which devours and consumes all things, and the pit is called <span
id="xxii.vii-p9.3"></span>שחת, *shachath,* which signifies *corruption.*
These words, therefore, here denote not so much the place as the quality
and condition of the place, as if it had been said, The life of Christ
will be exempted from the dominion of the grave, inasmuch as his body,
even when dead, will not be subject to corruption. Besides, we know that
the grave of Christ was filled, and as it were embalmed with the
life-giving perfume of his Spirit, that it might be to him the gate to
immortal glory. Both the Greek and Latin Fathers, I confess, have
strained these words to a meaning wholly different, referring them to
the bringing back of the soul of Christ from hell. But it is better to
adhere to the natural simplicity of the interpretation which I have
given, that we may not make ourselves objects of ridicule, to the Jews;
and farther, that one subtilty, by engendering many others, may not
involve us in a labyrinth. In the second clause mention is without doubt
made of the body; and we know it to be a mode of speaking very common
with David intentionally to repeat the same thing twice, making a slight
variation as to words. It is true, we translate <span
id="xxii.vii-p9.4"></span>נפש, *nephesh,* by *soul,* but in Hebrew it
only signifies *the vital breath,* or *life itself*

<span id="xxii.viii"></span>

<span id="xxii.viii-p1"></span><span id="xxii.viii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011.md)<span id="xxii.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.viii-p2"></span>**11.** Thou wilt make me to know the
path of life; fullness of joy is in thy countenance, pleasures are at
thy right hand for evermore.

<span id="xxii.viii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxii.viii-p4"></span><span id="xxii.viii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.viii-p5"></span>The Psalmist confirms the statement made
in the preceding verse, and explains the way in which God will exempt
him from the bondage of death, namely, by conducting and bringing him at
length safely to the possession of eternal life. Whence we again learn
what I have already observed, that this passage touches upon the
difference which there is between true believers and aliens, or
reprobates, with respect to their everlasting state. It is a mere cavil
to say, that when David here speaks of *the path of life* being shown to
him, it means the prolongation of his natural life. It is to form a very
low estimate, indeed, of the grace of God to speak of him as a guide to
his people in the path of life only for a very few years in this world.
In this case, they would differ nothing from the reprobate, who enjoy
the light of the sun in common with them. If, therefore, it is the
special grace of God which he communicates to none but his own children,
that David here magnifies and exalts, the showing of the way of life, of
which he speaks, must undoubtedly be viewed as extending to a blessed
immortality; and, indeed, he only knows the way of life who is so united
to God that he lives in God, and cannot live without him.

<span id="xxii.viii-p6"></span>David next adds, that when God is
reconciled to us, we have all things which are necessary to perfect
happiness. The phrase, *the countenance of God,* may be understood
either of our being beheld by him, or of our beholding him; but I
consider both these ideas as included, for his fatherly favor, which he
displays in looking upon us with a serene countenance, precedes this
joy, and is the first cause of it, and yet this does not cheer us until,
on our part, we behold it shining upon us. By this clause David also
intended distinctly to express to whom those *pleasures* belong, of
which God has in his hand a full and an overflowing abundance. As there
are with God pleasures sufficient to replenish and satisfy the whole
world, whence comes it to pass that a dismal and deadly darkness
envelopes the greater part of mankind, but because God does not look
upon all men equally with his friendly and fatherly countenance, nor
opens the eyes of all men to seek the matter of their joy in him, and no
where else? *Fulness of joy* is contrasted with the evanescent
allurements and pleasures of this transitory world, which, after having
diverted their miserable votaries for a time, leave them at length
unsatisfied, famished, and disappointed. They may intoxicate and glut
themselves with pleasures to the greatest excess, but, instead of being
satisfied, they rather become wearied of them through loathing; and,
besides, the pleasures of this world vanish away like dreams. David,
therefore, testifies that true and solid joy in which the minds of men
may rest will never be found any where else but in God; and that,
therefore, none but the faithful, who are contented with his grace
alone, can be truly and perfectly happy.

<span id="xxii-p5"></span> The word means *gold, the finest gold,* and
those who understand it in this sense here, think the psalm receives
this title to denote that it is fit to be written in letters of gold;
and some conjecture that the *psalms* distinguished by this title were,
on some occasion or other, thus written and hung up in the sanctuary.
Others are of opinion that the word *mictam* is derived from <span
id="xxii-p5.1"></span>כתם, *catham,* which signifies *to mark, to
engrave,* to denote that the psalm is fit to be engraven on a valuable
and durable pillar, to be preserved in everlasting remembrance. This is
the meaning attached to the word by the Septuagint, which translates it
<span id="xxii-p5.2"></span>στηλογραφία, an inscription on a pillar or
monument. In either of these views the title cannot but be regarded as
peculiarly appropriate to this sacred poem. “As a *sepulchral
inscription,”* remarks *Bishop* *Mant*, “it might have been written on
our Redeemer’s tomb; as a *triumphal monument,* it might have been sung
by him in the region of departed spirits; and in either, or in any
sense, it may well be considered as a *golden* composition, as *apples
of gold in network* of which occur in the titles of the psalms, are the
names of old melodies.

God. But I will never forsake thee by partaking with them in their
abominable sacrifices, (in which the blood of men is offered,) nor by
swearing by the name of any of their false gods.” “*Dathe* observes,
that <span id="xxii.iii-p9.3"></span>עצבות, never signifies idols, the

turn backward;  
Their libations of blood will I not offer;  
Nor will I take their names upon my lips.”

<span id="xxii.iii-p14"></span>And the sense which he attaches to the
passage is, that David having in the preceding verse declared his
delight in the righteous, here states that those who turn away from God
and his truth augment their own sufferings; and affirms it to be his
resolution to have no fellowship with them in their religious services,
which were polluted and detestable, or in the intercourse of friendship
by making mention of their names.

Hebrew text, and they denote the working of the thoughts and affections
of the soul. “Common experience,” says *Parkhurst*, “shows that the
workings of the mind, particularly the passions of joy, grief, and fear,
have a very, remarkable effect on the *reins* or *kidneys,* so, from
their retired situation in the body, and their being *hid* in fat, they
are often used in Scripture to denote the most *secret working* of the
soul and affections” “The reins or kidneys,” says *Walford*, in a note
on this passage, “are used to signify the interior faculties; and the
divine speaker observes, that in seasons of solitude, his thoughts were
instinctively employed in contemplating the heavenly discoveries that
were communicated to him.” In Tyndale’s Bible the reading of the last
clause is, “My reins also have *chastened me* in the night season.” And
*Fry* observes, that the word <span id="xxii.v-p3.1"></span>יסר,
signifies not so immediately *to instruct, as to chasten, correct, or*
*discipline.*

<span id="xxii.vi-p12"></span> The reading of the Septuagint is, “<span
id="xxii.vi-p12.1"></span>γλωσσα μου” “my tongue.” This is
unquestionably the meaning. David uses the word *glory* for the organ by
which God is glorified or praised. The Apostle Peter, in quoting this
passage, (<span id="xxii.vi-p12.2"></span>[Ac
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#026)<span id="xxii.vi-p12.2"></span>,.md)
reads, “my tongue.” See also <span id="xxii.vi-p12.3"></span>[Ps

<span id="xxii.vii-p3"></span> “The Hebrew word *shachath,”* says
*Poole*, “though sometimes, by a metonymy, it signifies the pit or place
of corruption, yet properly and generally it signifies corruption or
perdition. And so it must be understood here, although some of the Jews,
to avoid the force of this argument, render it the pit. But in that
sense it is not true, for whether it be meant of David, as they say, or
of Christ, it is confessed that both of them did see the pit, that is,
were laid in the grave.” Hence he concludes that *corruption* is the
proper rendering of the original word. The phrase, however, *to see the
pit,* may not mean to be laid in the grave, but to continue in it for
any length of time. The meaning which Calvin attaches to the word *pit*
is substantially that which our English translators attached to the
original word which they render *corruption. Hengstenberg* adopts and
defends Calvin’s rendering.

prophecy of Christ’s resurrection from the dead.
