<span id="xxiii-p1"></span>PSALM 17.

<span id="xxiii-p2"></span>This psalm contains a mournful complaint
against the cruel pride of David’s enemies. He protests that he did not
deserve to be persecuted with such inhumanity, inasmuch as he had given
them no cause for exercising their cruelty against him. At the same
time, he beseeches God, as his protector, to put forth his power for his
deliverance. The inscription of the psalm does not refer to any
particular time, but it is probable that David here complains of Saul
and his associates.  <span id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md)

<span id="xxiii-p4"></span>A prayer of David.

<span id="xxiii.i"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p1"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
17:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#001.md)<span id="xxiii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Hear my righteousness,  <span
id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) O Jehovah, attend to my cry; hearken
to my prayer, which proceedeth not from deceitful lips. **2.** Let my
judgment \[or judgment in my favor\] come forth from the presence of thy
countenance;  <span id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) let thine eyes
look upon my uprightness.

<span id="xxiii.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxiii.i-p6"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p7"></span>**1.** *Hear my righteousness, O Jehovah.*
The Psalmist begins the psalm by setting forth the goodness of his
cause. He does this because God has promised that he will not suffer the
innocent to be oppressed, but will always, at length, succor them. Some
explain the word *righteousness* as denoting *righteous prayer,* an
interpretation which appears to me unsatisfactory. The meaning rather
is, that David, confiding in his own integrity, interposes God as a
Judge between himself and his enemies, to cognosce or determine in his
cause. We have already seen, in a preceding psalm, that when we have to
deal with wicked men, we may warrantably protest our innocence before
God. As, however, it would not be enough for the faithful to have the
approving testimony of a good conscience, David adds to his protestation
earnest prayer. Even irreligious persons may often be able justly to
boast of having a good cause; but as they do not acknowledge that the
world is governed by the providence of God, they content themselves with
enjoying the approbation of their own conscience, as they speak, and,
gnawing the bit, bear the injuries which are done to them rather
obstinately than steadfastly, seeing they do not seek for any
consolation in faith and prayer. But the faithful not only depend upon
the goodness of their cause, they also commit it to God that he may
defend and maintain it; and whenever any adversity befalls them, they
betake themselves to him for help. This, therefore, is the meaning of
the passage; it is a prayer that God, who knew David to have done
justly, and to have performed his duty without giving occasion to any to
blame him,  <span id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) and, therefore, to
be unrighteously molested by his enemies, would graciously look upon
him; and that he would do this especially, since, confiding in his aid,
he entertained good hope, and, at the same time, prays to him with a
sincere heart. By the words *cry* and *prayer* he means the same thing;
but the word *cry,* and the repetition of what it denotes, by a
different expression, serve to show his vehement, his intense
earnestness of soul. Farther, as hypocrites talk loftily in commendation
of themselves, and to show to others a token of the great confidence
which they have in God, give utterance to loud cries, David protests
concerning himself that he does not speak *deceitfully;* in other words,
that he does not make use of his crying and prayer as a pretext for
covering his sins, but comes into the presence of God with sincerity of
heart. By this form of prayer the Holy Spirit teaches us, that we ought
diligently to endeavor to live an upright and innocent life, so that, if
there are any who give us trouble, we may be able to boast that we are
blamed and persecuted wrongfully.  <span
id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) Again, whenever the wicked assault us,
the same Spirit calls upon us to engage in prayer; and if any man,
trusting to the testimony of a good conscience which he enjoys, neglects
the exercise of prayer, he defrauds God of the honor which belongs to
him, in not referring his cause to him, and in not leaving him to judge
and determine in it. Let us learn, also, that when we present ourselves
before God in prayer, it is not to be done with the ornaments of an
artificial eloquence, for the finest rhetoric and the best grace which
we can have before him consists in pure simplicity.

<span id="xxiii.i-p10"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p11"></span>**2.** *From the presence of thy
countenance.* Literally it is, *from before thy face,* or, *before thy
face.* By these words David intimates that if God does not rise up as
the vindicator of his cause, he will be overwhelmed with calumnies
though innocent, and will be looked upon as a guilty and condemned
person. The cognisance which God will take of his cause is tacitly set
in opposition to the dark inventions of falsehood which were spread
against him.  <span id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md) His language is as
if he had said, I do not ask for any other judge but God, nor do I
shrink from standing before his judgment-seat,  <span
id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341.md) since I bring with me both a pure
heart and a good cause. What he immediately adds with respect to God’s
*looking upon* his uprightness is of similar import. He does not mean to
say that God is blind, but only beseeches him actually to show that he
does not connive at the wickedness of men, and that it is not to him a
matter of indifference when he beholds those who have not the means of
defending themselves  <span id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md) receiving
evil treatment undeservedly. Some take the word *judgment* in too
restricted a sense for the right to the kingdom which was promised to
David, as if he petitioned to be placed on the royal throne by the power
of God, inasmuch as he had been chosen by him to be king, and had also,
in his name and by his authority, been anointed to this office by the
hand of Samuel. The meaning which I attach to David’s language is simply
this, that being oppressed with many and varied wrongs, he commits
himself to the protection and defense of God.

<span id="xxiii.ii"></span>

<span id="xxiii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxiii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
17:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#003.md)<span id="xxiii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.ii-p2"></span>**3.** Thou hast proved my heart; thou
hast visited it by night; thou hast examined it, thou shalt find
nothing; my thoughts shall not pass beyond my mouth.  <span
id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md) **4.** As for the works of men, by the
word of thy lips I have taken heed of \[or watched\] the ways of the
destroyer.  <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md)

<span id="xxiii.ii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxiii.ii-p6"></span><span id="xxiii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.ii-p7"></span>**3.** *Thou hast proved my heart.* Some
are of opinion that in the three first verbs the past tense is put for
the future. Others more correctly and more clearly resolve the words
thus: If thou provest my heart, and visitest it by night, and examinest
it thoroughly, there will not be found any deceit therein. But without
making any change upon the words, they may be suitably enough explained
in this way: Thou, Lord, who understandest all the secret affections and
thoughts of my heart, even as it is thy peculiar prerogative to try men,
knowest very well that I am not a double man, and do not cherish any
deceit within. What David intended to express is certainly very evident.
As he was unjustly and falsely charged with crime, and could obtain
neither justice nor humanity at the hands of men, he appeals to God,
requesting he would become judge in the matter.  <span
id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) But not to do this rashly, he subjects
himself to an impartial examination, seeing God, whose prerogative it is
to search the secret recesses of the heart, cannot be deceived by the
external appearance. The time when he declares God to have visited him
is during *the night,* because, when a man is withdrawn from the
presence of his fellow-creatures, he sees more clearly his sins, which
otherwise would be hidden from his view; just as, on the contrary, the
sight of men affects us with shame, and this is, as it were, a veil
before our eyes, which prevents us from deliberately examining our
faults. It is, therefore, as if David had said, O Lord, since the
darkness of the night discovers the conscience more fully, all coverings
being then taken away, and since, at that season, the affections, either
good or bad, according to men’s inclinations, manifest themselves more
freely, when there is no person present to witness and pronounce
judgment upon them; if thou then examinest me, there will be found
neither disguise nor deceit in my heart.  <span
id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md) Hence we conclude how great was
David’s integrity, seeing that, when purposely and leisurely taking
account of his inmost thoughts, he presents himself so boldly, to be
tried by the judgment of God. And he not only declares himself to be
innocent of outward crimes, but also free from all secret malice. So far
from cherishing malicious designs, while he covered them over with fair
pretences, as his enemies alleged, he protests that his words were a
frank and undisguised representation of what was passing in his heart:
*My thought shall not pass beyond my mouth.* Our thought is said to pass
beyond our mouth when, for the purpose of deceiving, the mind thinks
differently from what the tongue expresses.  <span
id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md) The word <span
id="xxiii.ii-p10.2"></span>זמה, *zimmah,* which we have translated
simply *thought,* may also be taken in a bad sense for deceitful and
malicious devices.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p11"></span><span id="xxiii.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.ii-p12"></span>**4.** *As for the works of men, by the
word of thy lips.* Interpreters explain this verse in different senses.
Some thinking that the letter <span id="xxiii.ii-p12.1"></span>ב,
*beth,* which commonly signifies *in* or *by*, is taken for *against,*
render it thus: As for the works of men which they practice against thy
word. But I rather incline to the opinion of others who consider that
there is here commended a right judgment of the actions of men which is
formed according to the rule of the word of God. There are some shrewd
and ingenious persons who carefully mark the works of men, but they do
not judge of them according to the word of God. What we have as yet said
does not, however, fully give us the sense of the passage. We must still
consider what the Psalmist means when he speaks of *the paths of the
destroyer.*  <span id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) Some think he
refers to the men of his own company, who, if he had not restrained
them, would have instantly rushed like robbers to commit depredation;
since being reduced to the greatest distress, and seeing no prospect of
an alteration to the better in their affairs, they were become bold
through despair; and we know how sharp a spur necessity is in goading
men forward in any course. But this exposition seems to me to be forced,
and therefore I rather refer the words to his enemies. Farther, there is
a diversity of opinion among interpreters with respect to the meaning of
the word *watched* or *observed.* Some understand it in this sense, that
David had done his duty in strenuously opposing outrageous men, and
those who were wickedly engaged in the work of disturbing the repose and
tranquillity of their fellow-men.  <span
id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) Others understand it thus, that he was
careful to distinguish between good and evil, or right and wrong, that
he might not be corrupted by bad examples,  <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md) but avoid them, and, on the contrary,
practice those things which he saw to be agreeable to the word of God.
But David, I have no doubt, had a different meaning, and intended to
declare, that although wicked and malicious men provoked him to evil, he
had, nevertheless, been always restrained by the word of God, so that he
kept himself from exercising violence and inflicting injuries, or from
rendering evil for evil.  <span id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) He
therefore tells us, that whatever may have been the works of men, he had
been always so devoted to the word of God, and so hung, as it were, upon
his mouth, that he could not think of allowing himself, when provoked by
the injuries his enemies inflicted on him, to act towards them as they
acted towards him. We know how severe a temptation it is, and how
difficult to overcome, to disregard the manner in which men behave
themselves towards us, and to consider only what God forbids or commands
us. Even those who are naturally inclined to gentleness and humanity,
 <span id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) who desire to do good to all
men, and wish to hurt nobody, whenever they are provoked, burst forth
into a revengeful mood, carried away by a blind impetuosity; especially
when we see all right and equity overthrown, the confusion so blinds us,
that we begin to howl with the wolves. If, therefore, we would have a
good rule for governing ourselves, when our enemies, by their
mischievous actions, provoke us to treat them in a similar manner, let
us learn, after the example of David, to meditate upon the word of God,
and to keep our eyes fixed upon it. By this means our minds will be
preserved from ever being blinded, and we shall always avoid the paths
of wickedness, seeing God will not only keep our affections under
restraint by his commandments, but will also train them to patience by
his promises. He withholds us from doing evil to our neighbors,  <span
id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) not only by forbidding us, but by
declaring, at the same time, that he will take into his own hand the
execution of vengeance on those who injure us,  <span
id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) he admonishes us to “give place unto
wrath,” (<span id="xxiii.ii-p19.2"></span>[Ro
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md)<span
id="xxiii.ii-p19.2"></span>.)

<span id="xxiii.iii"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xxiii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
17:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#005.md)<span
id="xxiii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iii-p2"></span>**5.** Uphold my steps in thy paths, that
the soles of my feet may not slide. **6.** I have called upon thee,
surely thou wilt hear me, O God; incline thine ear unto me, and hear my
words.

<span id="xxiii.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxiii.iii-p4"></span><span id="xxiii.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iii-p5"></span>**5.** *Uphold my steps.* If we take
*God’s paths* for the precepts of his law, the sense will be evident,
namely, that although David had spoken according to truth, in boasting
of having, in the midst of the most grievous temptations which assailed
him, constantly practiced righteousness with a pure heart, yet,
conscious of his own weakness, he commits himself to God to be governed
by him, and prays for grace to enable him to persevere. His language is
as if he had said, Since hitherto, under thy guidance, I have proceeded
onward in the right path, I beseech thee, in like manner, to keep my
steps from sliding with respect to the time to come. And certainly the
more any one excels in grace,  <span id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md)
the more ought he to be afraid of falling; for it is the usual policy of
Satan to endeavor, even from the virtue and strength which God has given
us,  <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) to produce in us carnal
confidence which may induce carelessness. I do not altogether reject
this sense, but I think it more probable that David here beseeches God
to bring his affairs to a prosperous issue, however dark the aspect of
matters was at present. The import of his language is this, Lord, since
thou seest that I walk in uprightness and sincerity of heart, govern
thou me in such a manner as to make all men see that thou art my
protector and guardian, and leave me not to be cast down at the will of
my enemies. Thus, by *the paths of the Lord,* he will mean not the
doctrine by which our life is regulated, but the power by which God
upholds us, and the protection by which he preserves us. And he
addresses God in this manner, not only because all events are in his
hand, but because when he takes care of us all things in our lot go on
prosperously. When he adds, *that the soles of my feet may not slide,*
he refers to the many adverse events which threaten us every moment, and
to the danger we are in of perishing, if not sustained by the hand of
God.

<span id="xxiii.iii-p8"></span><span id="xxiii.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iii-p9"></span>**6.** *I have called upon thee, etc.*
This verb being put in the past tense denotes a continued act; and,
therefore, it includes the present time. The Hebrew word <span
id="xxiii.iii-p9.1"></span>כי, *ki*, which we translate *surely,* often
signifies *because,* and if it is so understood in this passage, the
meaning will be, that David took encouragement to pray, because,
depending upon the promise of God, he hoped that his prayers would not
be in vain. But, perhaps, it may be thought preferable to change the
tense of the verb as some do, so as to give this meaning, I will pray,
because I have hitherto experienced that thou hast heard  <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) my prayers. I have, however, chosen
the exposition what appears to me the more simple. David, in my
judgment, here encourages and animates himself to call upon God, from
the confident hope of being heard, as if he had said, Since I call upon
thee, surely, O God, thou wilt not despise my prayers. Immediately after
he beseeches God to bestow upon him the blessings of which he told us he
entertained an assured hope.

<span id="xxiii.iv"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iv-p1"></span><span id="xxiii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
17:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#007.md)<span id="xxiii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iv-p2"></span>**7.** Make marvellous thy mercies, O thou
preserver of those who trust \[in thee,  <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) \] from those that exalt themselves
against thy right hand. **8.** Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the
eye  <span id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) hide me in the shadow of
thy wings. **9.** From the face of the ungodly, who go about to destroy
me; and of mine enemies, who besiege \[or encompass\] my soul.

<span id="xxiii.iv-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxiii.iv-p6"></span><span id="xxiii.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iv-p7"></span>**7.** *Make marvellous thy mercies.* As
the word <span id="xxiii.iv-p7.1"></span>הפלה, *haphleh,* signifies
sometimes *to make wonderful,* or *remarkable,* and sometimes *to
separate and set apart,* both these senses will be very suitable to this
passage. In <span id="xxiii.iv-p7.2"></span>[Ps
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019.md)<span id="xxiii.iv-p7.2"></span>,
the “goodness” of God is said to be “laid up” in store as a peculiar
treasure “for them that fear him,” that he may bring it forth at the
proper season, even when they are brought to an extremity, and when all
things seem to be desperate. If, then, the translation, *separate and
set apart thy mercy,* is preferred, the words are a prayer that God
would display towards his servant David the special grace which he
communicates to none but his chosen ones. While God involves both the
good and the bad in danger indiscriminately, he at length shows, by the
different issue of things, in regard to the two classes, that he does
not confusedly mingle the chaff and the wheat together, seeing he
gathers his own people into a company by themselves, (<span
id="xxiii.iv-p7.3"></span>[Mt
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md)<span id="xxiii.iv-p7.3"></span>,
and <span id="xxiii.iv-p7.4"></span>[Mt
25:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#032.md)<span
id="xxiii.iv-p7.4"></span>.) I, however, prefer following another
exposition. David, in my judgment, perceiving that he could only be
delivered from the perilous circumstances in which he was placed by
singular and extraordinary means, betakes himself to the wonderful or
miraculous power of God. Those who think he desires God to withhold his
grace from his persecutors do too great violence to the scope of the
passage. By this circumstance there is expressed the extreme danger to
which David was exposed; for otherwise it would have been enough for him
to have been succoured in the ordinary and common way in which God is
accustomed daily to favor and to aid his own people. The grievousness of
his distress, therefore, constrained him to beseech God to work
miraculously for his deliverance. The title with which he here honors
God, *O thou preserver of those who trust \[in thee,\]* serves to
confirm him in the certain hope of obtaining his requests. As God takes
upon him the charge of saving all who confide in him, David being one of
their number, could upon good ground assure himself of safety and
deliverance. Whenever, therefore, we approach God, let the first thought
impressed on our minds be, that as he is not in vain called the
preserver of those who trust in him, we have no reason whatever to be
afraid of his not being ready to succor us, provided our faith continue
firmly to rely upon his grace. And if every way of deliverance is shut
up, let us also at the same time remember that he is possessed of
wonderful and inconceivable means of succouring us, which serve so much
the more conspicuously to magnify and manifest his power. But as the
participle *trusting,* or *hoping,* is put without any additional word
expressing the object of this trust or hope,  <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md) some interpreters connect it with the
last words of the verse, *thy right hand,* as if the order of the words
were inverted. They, therefore, resolve them thus, *O thou preserver of
those who trust in thy right hand, from those who rise up against them.*
As this, however, is harsh and strained, and the exposition which I have
given is more natural, and more generally received,  <span
id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) let us follow it. To express,
therefore, the meaning in one sentence, the Psalmist attributes to God
the office of defending and preserving his own people from all the
ungodly who rise up to assault them, and who, if it were in their power,
would destroy them. And the ungodly are here said *to exalt themselves
against the hand of God,* because, in molesting the faithful whom God
has taken under his protection, they openly wage war against him. The
doctrine contained in these words, namely, that when we are molested, an
outrage is committed upon God in our person, is a very profitable one;
for having once declared himself to be the guardian and protector of our
welfare, whenever we are unjustly assailed, he puts forth his hand
before us as a shield of defense.

<span id="xxiii.iv-p10"></span><span id="xxiii.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iv-p11"></span>The two similitudes which David has
subjoined in the following verse, respecting *the apple of the eye,* and
the little birds which the mother keeps *under her wings,*  <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) are introduced for illustrating the
same subject. God, to express the great care which he has of his own
people, compares himself to a hen and other fowls, which spread out
their wings to cherish and cover their young, and declares them to be no
less dear to him than the apple of the eye, which is the tenderest part
of the body, is to man; it follows, therefore, that whenever men rise up
to molest and injure the righteous, war is waged against him. As this
form of prayer was put into the mouth of David by the Holy Spirit, it is
to be regarded as containing in it a promise. We have here presented to
our contemplation a singular and an astonishing proof of the goodness of
God, in humbling himself so far, and in a manner so to speak,
transforming himself, in order to lift up our faith above the
conceptions of the flesh.

<span id="xxiii.iv-p13"></span><span id="xxiii.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iv-p14"></span>**9.** *From the face of the ungodly.*
The Psalmist, by again accusing his enemies, intends to set forth his
own innocence, as an argument for his obtaining the favor of God. At the
same time, he complains of their cruelty, that God may be the more
inclined to aid him. First, he says that they burn with an enraged
desire to waste and to destroy him; secondly, he adds, that they
*besiege him in his soul,* by which he means, that they would never rest
satisfied until they had accomplished his death. The greater, therefore,
the terror with which we are stricken by the cruelty of our enemies, the
more ought we to be quickened to ardor in prayer. God, indeed, does not
need to receive information and incitement from us; but the use and the
end of prayer is, that the faithful, by freely declaring to God the
calamities and sorrows which oppress them, and in disburdening them, as
it were, into his bosom, may be assured beyond all doubt that he has a
regard to their necessities.

<span id="xxiii.v"></span>

<span id="xxiii.v-p1"></span><span id="xxiii.v-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
17:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#010.md)<span
id="xxiii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.v-p2"></span>**10.** They have inclosed themselves in
their own fat,  <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) they have spoken
proudly with their mouth. **11.** They have now compassed me round about
in our steps; they have fixed their eyes to cast down to the ground.
**12.** The likeness of him is as a lion that desireth to tear in
pieces, and as a lion’s whelp which lurketh in secret places.

<span id="xxiii.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxiii.v-p5"></span><span id="xxiii.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.v-p6"></span>**10.** *They have inclosed themselves in
their own fat* If the translation which is given by others is considered
preferable, *They have inclosed their own fat,* the meaning will be
quite the same. Some Jewish interpreters explain the words thus: that
being stuffed with fat, and their throat being, as it were, choked with
it, they were unable to speak freely; but this is a very meagre and
unsatisfactory exposition. By the word *fat,* I think, is denoted the
pride with which they were filled and swollen, as it were, with fatness.
It is a very appropriate and expressive metaphor to represent them as
having their hearts choked up with pride, in the manner in which
corpulent persons are affected from the fat within them.  <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) David complains of their being puffed
up with their wealth and pleasures, and accordingly we see the ungodly,
the more luxuriously they are pampered, conducting themselves the more
outrageously and proudly. But I think there is described by the word
*fat* an inward vice namely, their being inclosed on all sides with
arrogance and presumption, and their having become utter strangers to
every feeling of humanity.  <span id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) The
Psalmist next declares that this is abundantly manifested in their
language. In short, his meaning is, that inwardly they swell with pride,
and that they take no pains to conceal it, as appears from the high
swelling words to which they give utterance. When it is said, *They have
spoken proudly with their mouth,* the word *mouth* is not a pleonasm, as
it often is in other places; for David means, that with mouths widely
opened they pour forth scornful and contemptuous language, which bears
testimony to the pride which dwells within them.

<span id="xxiii.v-p9"></span><span id="xxiii.v-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.v-p10"></span>**11.** *They have now compassed me round
about in our steps.* The Psalmist confirms what he has said before
concerning the furious passion for doing mischief with which his enemies
were inflamed. He says they were so cruelly bent on accomplishing his
destruction, that in whatever way he directed or altered his course,
they ceased not to follow close upon him. When he says *our steps,* he
doubtless comprehends his own companions, although he immediately after
returns to speak of himself alone; unless, perhaps, another reading is
preferred, for some copies have <span id="xxiii.v-p10.1"></span>סבבונו,
*sebabunu, They have compassed us,* in the plural number. This, however,
is not a matter of great importance. David simply complains, that unless
God stretch forth his hand from heaven to deliver him, there now remains
for him no way of escape, seeing his enemies, whenever he stirs his foot
to avoid their fury, immediately pursue him, and watch all his steps. By
the adverb *now,* he intimates not only that he is at present in very
great danger, but also that at every moment his enemies, in whatever way
he turns himself, pursue and press hard upon him. In the last clause,
*They have fixed their eyes to cast down to the ground,* some consider
David as comparing his enemies to hunters, who, with eyes fixed on the
ground, are silently looking with eager desire for their prey. They,
therefore, think that by the eyes fixed on the ground is denoted the
gesture or attitude of David’s adversaries, and certainly crafty and
malicious men have their countenance often fixed on the ground.
According to others, whose opinion is nearer the spirit of the passage,
this form of expression signifies the continual and unwearied ardor by
which the ungodly are impelled to turn all things upside down. *To fix
their eyes,* therefore, is nothing else than to apply all their
ingenuity, and put forth all their efforts. What follows, *to cast down
to the ground,* is the same thing as to overthrow. The ungodly, as if
they must necessarily fall, should the world continue to stand, would
wish all mankind thrown down or destroyed, and, therefore, they exert
themselves to the utmost to bring down and ruin all men. This is
explained more fully by the figurative illustration introduced in the
following verse, where they are said to be *like lions and lions’
whelps*  <span id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) But we ought always to
keep this truth in remembrance, that the more proudly wicked men
exercise their cruelty against us, the hand of God is so much the nearer
to us to oppose itself to their savage fury; for to him alone belongs
the praise of subduing and restraining these wild beasts who delight in
shedding blood. David speaks of *dens,* or *secret lurking places,*
because his enemies were deeply skilled in artful stratagem, and had
various methods of doing mischief, while they had also at hand the power
and means of executing them, so that it was difficult to resist them.

<span id="xxiii.vi"></span>

17:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#013.md)<span
id="xxiii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.vi-p2"></span>**13.** Arise, O Jehovah, prevent \[or go
before\] his face, lay him prostrate on the ground;  <span
id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md) deliver my soul from the ungodly man
by thy sword: **14.** From men by thy hand, O Jehovah, from men who are
of long duration, \[or who are from an age,  <span
id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) \] whose portion is in life, whose
belly thou fillest with thy secret goods; their children are filled with
them, and they leave the rest to their babes.

<span id="xxiii.vi-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxiii.vi-p6"></span><span id="xxiii.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.vi-p7"></span>**13.** *Arise, O Jehovah.* The more
furiously David was persecuted by his enemies, he beseeches God the more
earnestly to afford him immediate aid; for he uses the word *face* to
denote the swift impetuosity of his adversary, to repress which there
was need of the greatest haste. By these words, the Holy Spirit teaches
us, that when death shows itself to be just at hand, God is provided
with remedies perfectly prepared, by which he can effect our deliverance
in a moment. The Psalmist not only attributes to God the office of
delivering his people; he at the same time arms him with power to crush
and break in pieces the wicked. He does not, however, wish them to be
cast down farther than was necessary to their being humbled, that they
might cease from their outrageous and injurious conduct towards him, as
we may gather from the following clause, where he again beseeches God
*to deliver his soul* David would have been contented to see them
continuing in the possession of their outward ease and prosperity, had
they not abused their power by practising injustice and cruelty. Let us
know then, that God consults the good of his people when he overthrows
the ungodly, and breaks their strength; when he does this, it is for the
purpose of delivering from destruction the poor innocents who are
molested by these wretched men.  <span id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md)
Some expositors read the passage thus, *From the ungodly man, who is thy
sword,*  <span id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md) and also, *From the men
who are thy hand;* but this does not seem to me to be a proper
translation. I admit, that from whatever quarter afflictions come to us,
it is the hand of God which chastises us, and that the ungodly are the
scourges he employs for this purpose; and farther, that this
consideration is very well fitted to lead us to exercise patience. But
as this manner of speaking would here be somewhat harsh, and, at the
same time, not very consistent with the prayer, I prefer adopting the
exposition which represents David’s words as a prayer that God would
deliver him by his sword, and smite with his hand those men who, for too
long a time, had been in possession of power and prosperity. He
contrasts God’s sword with human aids and human means of relief; and the
import of his words is, If God himself does not come forth to take
vengeance, and draw his sword, there remains for me no hope of
deliverance.

<span id="xxiii.vi-p10"></span><span id="xxiii.vi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.vi-p11"></span>**14.** *From men by thy hand, O Jehovah,
from men who are from an age.* I connect these words thus: O Lord,
deliver me by thy hand, or by thy heavenly aid, from men; I say from men
whose tyranny has prevailed too long, and whom thou hast suffered to
wallow too long in the filth and draft of their prosperity. This
repetition is very emphatic; David’s voice being stifled, as it were,
with the indignation which he felt at seeing such villany continuing for
so long a period, he stops all at once after uttering the first word,
without proceeding farther in the sentence which he meant to express;
then, after having recovered his breath, he declares what it is that so
greatly distressed him. In the preceding verse he had spoken in the
singular number; but now he gives us to understand that he had not only
one enemy but many, and that those who were set against him were strong
and powerful, so that he saw no hope of deliverance remaining for him
except in the aid of God.

<span id="xxiii.vi-p12"></span>These words, *from world,* or *age,* (for
such is the exact literal rendering,  <span
id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371) .md) are expounded in different ways.
Some understand them as meaning *men who have their time,* as if David
intended to say that their prosperous condition would not be of long
duration; but this does not appear to me to be the proper explanation.
Others suppose he means by this expression such as are wholly devoted to
the world, and whose whole attention and thoughts are absorbed in the
things of earth; and, according to their opinion, David compares his
enemies to brute beasts. In the same sense they explain what follows
immediately after, *Their portion is in life,* language which they
consider as applied to them, because, being entirely destitute of the
Spirit, and cleaving with their whole hearts to transitory good things,
they think of nothing better than this world. For that in which each man
places his felicity is termed his portion. As, however, the Hebrew word
<span id="xxiii.vi-p13.2"></span>חלד, *cheled,* signifies *an age,* or
*the course of a man’s life,* David, I doubt not, complains that his
enemies had lived and enjoyed prosperity longer than the ordinary term
allotted to the life of man. The audacity and the outrages  <span
id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372.md) committed by wicked men might be borne
with for a short time, but when they wax wanton against God, it is very
strange indeed to see them continuing stable in their prosperous
condition. That this is the sense appears from the preposition <span
id="xxiii.vi-p14.2"></span>מן, *min,* which we have translated *from,*
by which David expresses that they were not sprung up only a few days
before or lately, but that their prosperity, which should have vanished
away in a moment, had lasted for a very long time. Such, then, is the
meaning of the Psalmist, unless, perhaps, we may understand him as
denominating them *of the world,* or *age,* because they bear the chief
authority among men, and are exalted in honors and riches, as if this
world had been made for them alone.

<span id="xxiii.vi-p15"></span>When he says, *Their portion is in life,*
I explain it as meaning that they are exempted from all troubles, and
abound in pleasures; in short, that they do not experience the common
condition of other men; as, on the contrary, when a man is oppressed
with adversities, it is said of him that his portion is in death. David
therefore intimates, that it is not a reasonable thing that the ungodly
should be permitted to gad about in joy and gaiety without having any
fear of death, and to claim for themselves, as if by hereditary right, a
peaceful and happy life.

<span id="xxiii.vi-p16"></span>What he adds immediately after, *Whose
belly thou fillest with thy secret goods,* is of the same import. We see
these persons not only enjoying, in common with other men, light,
breath, food, and all other commodities of life, but we also see God
often treating them more delicately and more bountifully than others, as
if he fed them on his lap, holding them tenderly like little babes, and
fondling them more than all the rest of mankind.  <span
id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373.md) Accordingly, by *the secret goods of
God,* we are here to understand the rare and more exquisite dainties
which he bestows upon them. Now, this is a severe temptation, if a man
estimates the love and favor of God by the measure of earthly prosperity
which he bestows; and, therefore, it is not to be wondered at, though
David was greatly afflicted in contemplating the prosperous condition of
ungodly men. But let us remember that he makes this holy complaint to
console himself, and to mitigate his distress, not in the way of
murmuring against God and resisting his will; - let us remember this, I
say*,* that, after his example, we may learn also to direct our
groanings to heaven. Some give a more subtile exposition of what is here
called *God’s secret goods,* viewing it as meaning the good things which
the ungodly devour without thinking of or regarding him who is the
author of them; or they suppose the good things of God to be called
*secret,* because the reason why God pours them forth so abundantly upon
the wicked is not apparent. But the exposition which I have given, as it
is both simple and natural, so of itself it sufficiently disproves the
others. The last point in this description is, that, by continual
succession, these persons transmit their riches to their children and
their children’s children. As they are not among the number of the
children of God, to whom this blessing is promised, it follows, that
when they are thus fattened, it is for the day of slaughter which he
hath appointed. The object which David therefore has in view in making
this complaint is, that God would make haste to execute vengeance,
seeing they have so long abused his liberality and gentle treatment.

<span id="xxiii.vii"></span>

<span id="xxiii.vii-p1"></span><span id="xxiii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
17:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015.md)<span id="xxiii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.vii-p2"></span>**15.** But as for me, I shall behold thy
face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I shall awake, with
thy image, \[or likeness.\]

<span id="xxiii.vii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxiii.vii-p4"></span><span id="xxiii.vii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.vii-p5"></span>Having with anguish of heart declared
before God the troubles which afflicted and tormented him, that he might
not be overwhelmed with the load of temptations which pressed upon him,
he now takes, as it were, the wings of faith and rises up to a region of
undisturbed tranquillity, where he may behold all things arranged and
directed in due order. In the first place, there is here a tacit
comparison between the well regulated state of things which will be seen
when God by his judgment shall restore to order those things which are
now embroiled and confused, and the deep and distressing darkness which
is in the world, when God keeps silence, and hides his face. In the
midst of those afflictions which he has recounted, the Psalmist might
seem to be plunged in darkness from which he would never obtain
deliverance.  <span id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md) When we see the
ungodly enjoying prosperity, crowned with honors, and loaded with
riches, they seem to be in great favor with God. But David triumphs over
their proud and presumptuous boasting; and although, to the eye of sense
and reason, God has cast him off, and removed him far from him, yet he
assures himself that one day he will enjoy the privilege of familiarly
beholding him. The pronoun *I* is emphatic, as if he had said, The
calamities and reproaches which I now endure will not prevent me from
again experiencing fullness of joy from the fatherly love of God
manifested towards me. We ought carefully to observe, that David, in
order to enjoy supreme happiness, desires nothing more than to have
always the taste and experience of this great blessing that God is
reconciled to him. The wicked may imagine themselves to be happy, but so
long as God is opposed to them, they deceive themselves in indulging
this imagination. *To behold God’s face,* is nothing else than to have a
sense of his fatherly favor, with which he not only causes us to rejoice
by removing our sorrows, but also transports us even to heaven. By the
word *righteousness,* David means that he will not be disappointed of
the reward of a good conscience. As long as God humbles his people under
manifold afflictions, the world insolently mocks at their simplicity, as
if they deceived themselves, and lost their pains in devoting themselves
to the cultivation and practice of purity and innocence.  <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md) Against such kind of mockery and
derision David is here struggling, and in opposition to it he assures
himself that there is a recompense laid up for his godliness and
uprightness, provided he continue to persevere in his obedience to the
holy law of God; as Isaiah, in like manner, (<span
id="xxiii.vii-p7.2"></span>[Isa
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#010.md)<span
id="xxiii.vii-p7.2"></span>,) exhorts the faithful to support themselves
from this consideration, that “it shall be well with the righteous: for
they shall eat the fruit of their doings.” We ought not, however, from
this to think that he represents works as the cause of his salvation. It
is not his purpose to treat of what constitutes the meritorious ground
upon which he is to be received into the favor of God. He only lays it
down as a principle, that they who serve God do not lose their labor,
for although he may hide his face from them for a time, he causes them
again in due season to behold his bright countenance  <span
id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376.md) and compassionate eye beaming upon
them.

<span id="xxiii.vii-p9"></span>*I shall be satisfied.* Some
interpreters, with more subtility than propriety, restrict this to the
resurrection at the last day, as if David did not expect to experience
in his heart a blessed joy  <span id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377.md)
until the life to come, and suspended every longing desire after it
until he should attain to that life. I readily admit that this
satisfaction of which he speaks will not in all respects be perfect
before the last coming of Christ; but as the saints, when God causes
some rays of the knowledge of his love to enter into their hearts, find
great enjoyment in the light thus communicated, David justly calls this
peace or joy of the Holy Spirit *satisfaction.* The ungodly may be at
their ease, and have abundance of good things, even to bursting, but as
their desire is insatiable, or as they feed upon wind, in other words,
upon earthly things, without tasting spiritual things, in which there is
substance,  <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378.md) or being so
stupified through the pungent remorse of conscience with which they are
tormented, as not to enjoy the good things which they possess, they
never have composed and tranquil minds, but are kept unhappy by the
inward passions with which they are perplexed and agitated. It is
therefore the grace of God alone which can give us contentment,  <span
id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md) and prevent us from being distracted
by irregular desires. David, then, I have no doubt, has here an allusion
to the empty joys of the world, which only famish the soul, while they
sharpen and increase the appetite the more,  <span
id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380.md) in order to show that those only are
partakers of true and substantial happiness who seek their felicity in
the enjoyment of God alone. As the literal rendering of the Hebrew words
is, *I shall be satisfied in the awaking of thy face,* or, *in awaking
by thy face;* some, preferring the first exposition, understand by the
awaking of God’s face the breaking forth, or manifestation of the light
of his grace, which before was, as it were, covered with clouds. But to
me it seems more suitable to refer the word *awake* to David,  <span
id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md) and to view it as meaning the same
thing as to obtain respite from his sorrow. David had never indeed been
overwhelmed with stupor; but after a lengthened period of fatigue,
through the persecution of his enemies, he must needs have been brought
into such a state as to appear sunk into a profound sleep. The saints do
not sustain and repel all the assaults which are made upon them so
courageously as not, by reason of the weakness of their flesh, to feel
languid and feeble for a time, or to be terrified, as if they were
enveloped in darkness. David compares this perturbation of mind to a
sleep. But when the favor of God shall again have arisen and shone
brightly upon him, he declares that then he will recover spiritual
strength and enjoy tranquillity of mind. It is true, indeed, as Paul
declares, that so long as we continue in this state of earthly
pilgrimage, “we walk by faith, not by sight;” but as we nevertheless
behold the image of God not only in the glass of the gospel, but also in
the numerous evidences of his grace which he daily exhibits to us, let
each of us awaken himself from his lethargy, that we may now be
satisfied with spiritual felicity, until God, in due time, bring us to
his own immediate presence, and cause us to enjoy him face to face.

<span id="xxiii-p3"></span> This is the general opinion as to the
occasion of the composition of this psalm. It is supposed that David, in
representing his innocence of those things of which he was accused,
refers to the charges brought against him of traitorously aspiring to
the kingdom, and seeking the life of Saul, <span
id="xxiii-p3.1"></span>[1Sa 24:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#009.md)<span
id="xxiii-p3.1"></span>; and that therefore the persecutors and
calumniators from whom he beseeches God to deliver him were Saul and his
courtiers.

Deus, justum,” “Hear O God, the just one, a reading which *Horsley* is
inclined to adopt, viewing the Messiah as the speaker in this psalm. In

<span id="xxiii.ii-p3"></span> Great difference of opinion has prevailed
among critics, as to the rendering and interpretation of this and the
following verse. The third verse is rendered thus in Tyndale’s Bible:
”Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night seasons, thou hast
tried me in the fire, and hast found no wickedness in me; for I utterly
purposed that my mouth should not offend.” *Geddes* reads the third
clause of the verse “Thou hast smelted me, and found in me no dross;”
and observes, that *smelted* is “a metaphor taken from the smelting of
metals to purify them from extraneous *matter.”* — *Geddes’ New
Translation of the Book of Psalms, with Notes.* The last clause of the
third verse is added to the first clause of the fourth verse, in the
Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions, and the reading is
thus “My mouth has not transgressed as to the evil designs of other men;
that is, I have not countenanced or approved of them by word.”

<span id="xxiii.ii-p10"></span> This is the sense put upon this last
clause by the learned *Castellio*, who translates it thus:- “<span

ore habere.” “Thou shalt not find me to have one thing in my breast and

<span id="xxiii.iii-p10"></span> The Septuagint renders the verb in the
past tense, “<span id="xxiii.iii-p10.1"></span>Επηκουσας μου,” “Thou
hast heard me.” The Syriac and Vulgate give a similar rendering. The
verb, in the Hebrew, is in the future; but it is a common thing in
Hebrew to use the future tense for the past.

*- French and Skinner’s Translation of the Book of Psalms.* There may no
doubt be a reference to the personal appearance and sensual indulgence
of David’s enemies. But something more is implied. “We know that, in the
figurative language of Scripture fatness denotes pride. This connection
of ideas is still maintained in the East, where, when it is intended to
indicate a proud man, he is said to be fat, or to look fat, whether
really so or not.” — *Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible.*

<span id="fn_365"></span>[366](cc08022.htm#fr_365.md) <span
id="xxiii.v-p7.4"></span>

<span id="xxiii.v-p8"></span> *Dr* *Geddes* translates the clause,
“Their hearts have they hardened.” “Literally,” says he, “they have
closed their midriff; — shut out all compassion from their hearts.” The
Hebrew word which is rendered fat is explained by *Gesenius*, when used
figuratively, as denoting a fat, that is, an unfeeling heart.

<span id="xxiii.v-p11"></span> In the French version it is <span
id="xxiii.v-p11.1"></span>lionceaux, young lions. *French* and *Skinner*
read “like a lion,” and “like a young lion*;’* and observe, “The word
translated ‘young lion’ signifies a lion in the rigour of youth, and
fully capable of pursuing his prey.”

<span id="fn_367"></span>[368](cc08022.htm#fr_367.md) <span

<span id="xxiii.vi-p3"></span> “The LXX. have happily expressed the
exact import of the Hebrew word, ‘<span id="xxiii.vi-p3.1"></span>Υπος
κελισον αὐτους’ ‘Make him sink upon his knees.’“ — *Horsley.* Street
reads, “Make them bend.” Cocceius renders it, “<span
id="xxiii.vi-p3.2"></span>Incurva ilium,” “Bend him,” and explains the
phrase thus: — “<span id="xxiii.vi-p3.3"></span>Fac, ut se demittat,”
etc.; i.e. “Make him to cast himself down, bend his stature, which is
erect and inflexible like iron; that is to say, take away from him the
power and the inclination of doing mischief.”

<span id="xxiii.vi-p9"></span> “It may be questioned whether David, in
this or the next clause, intended to represent wicked men as the sword
and the hand of God; that is, the instruments which he employed to
correct his servants; or whether his meaning was to pray that God would
interpose his own hand and sword to defend him and punish his enemies.
The latter sense is adopted by some interpreters; but as the former is a
perfectly Scriptural sentiment, and requires the supposition of no
ellipsis, it appears to me to be most likely what is intended. *Vide*
<span id="xxiii.vi-p9.1"></span>[Isa
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#005.md)<span id="xxiii.vi-p9.1"></span>.”
— *Walford*. Many of the most eminent critics, however, adopt the
translation which Calvin has given, as *Hammond, Houbigant, Ainsworth,
Bishops Lowth, Horsley, Home,* and *Hare, Dr Boothroyd, Dr Adam Clarke,
Dathe,* and *Venema*. The reading in Tyndale’s Bible is, “Deliver my
soul with thy sword from the ungodly.”

<span id="xxiii.vii-p14"></span> The Chaldee version applies it to
David, and reads, “When I shall awake, I shall be satisfied with the
glory of thy countenance.” But the Septuagint, the Vulgate, Arabic, and
Ethiopic versions apply the verb, *awake* to *thy glory.* “<span
id="xxiii.vii-p14.1"></span>Εν τῳ ὀφθηναι την δοξαν σου,” “At the
appearing of thy glory,” says the Septuagint. “<span
id="xxiii.vii-p14.2"></span>Cum apparuerit gloria tua,” “When thy glory
shall appear,” says the Vulgate.
