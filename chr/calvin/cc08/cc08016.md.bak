<span id="xvii-p1"></span>PSALM 11.

<span id="xvii-p2"></span>This psalm consists of two parts. In the first
part, David recounts the severe assaults of temptation which he had
encountered, and the state of distressing anxiety to which he had been
reduced during the time of his persecution by Saul. In the second, he
congratulates himself on the deliverance which God had granted him, and
magnifies the righteousness of God in the government of the world.

<span id="xvii-p3"></span>To the chief musician. A Psalm of David.

<span id="xvii.i"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p1"></span><span id="xvii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
11:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#001.md)<span id="xvii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p2"></span>**1.** In Jehovah do I put my trust: how
then say ye to my soul, Flee ye into your mountain as a bird? **2.**
Surely, behold! the ungodly shall bend  <span
id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) their bow, they have fixed their
arrows upon the string, to shoot secretly at the upright in heart.
**3.** Truly, the foundations are destroyed: what  <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) hath the righteous One done?

<span id="xvii.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="xvii.i-p6"></span><span id="xvii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p7"></span>**1.** *In Jehovah do I put my trust.*
Almost all interpreters think that this is a complaint which David
brings against his countrymen, that while seeking in every quarter for
hiding-places, he could find nowhere even common humanity. And it is
indeed true, that in the whole course of his wanderings, after betaking
himself to flight to escape the cruelty of Saul, he could find no secure
place of retreat, at least, none where he might continue for any length
of time undisturbed. He might, therefore, justly complain of his own
countrymen, in that none of them deigned to shelter him when he was a
fugitive. But I think he has a respect to something higher. When all men
were striving, as it were, with each other, to drive him to despair, he
must, according to the weakness of the flesh, have been afflicted with
great and almost overwhelming distress of mind; but fortified by faith,
he confidently and steadfastly leaned on the promises of God, and was
thus preserved from yielding to the temptations to which he was exposed.
These spiritual conflicts, with which God exercised him in the midst of
his extreme perils, he here recounts. Accordingly, as I have just now
observed, the psalm should be divided into two parts. Before celebrating
the righteousness of God, which he displays in the preservation of the
godly, the Psalmist shows how he had encountered even death itself, and
yet, through faith and an upright conscience, had obtained the victory.
As all men advised him to leave his country, and retire into some place
of exile, where he might be concealed, inasmuch as there remained for
him no hope of life, unless he should relinquish the kingdom, which had
been promised to him; in the beginning of the psalm, he opposes to this
perverse advice the shield of his trust in God.

<span id="xvii.i-p8"></span>But before entering farther upon the
subject, let us interpret the words. The word <span
id="xvii.i-p8.1"></span>נוד, *nud,* which we have rendered *to flee,* is
written in the plural number, and yet it is read in the singular;  <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) but, in my opinion, this is a corrupt
reading. As David tells us that this was said to himself only, the
Jewish doctors, thinking the plural number unsuitable, have taken it
upon them to read the word in the singular. Some of them, wishing to
retain the literal sense as it is called, perplex themselves with the
question, why it is said, *Flee ye,* rather than *Flee thou;* and, at
length, they have recourse to a very meagre subtilty, as if those who
counselled him to betake himself to flight addressed both his soul and
his body. But it was unnecessary labor to put themselves to so much
trouble in a matter where there is no difficulty; for it is certain that
those who counselled David did not say that he alone should flee, but
that he should flee, together with all his attendants, who were in the
same danger with himself. Although, therefore, they addressed themselves
especially to David, yet they included his companions, who had a common
cause with him, and were exposed to the like danger. Expositors, also,
differ in their interpretation of what follows. Many render it *from
your mountain,* as if it were <span id="xvii.i-p9.3"></span>מהרכם,
*meharkem;* and, according to them, there is a change of person, because
those who spoke to him must have said, *flee thou from* Our *mountain.*
But this is harsh and strained. Nor does it appear to me that they have
any more reason on their side, when they say that Judea is here called
mountain. Others think we should read <span id="xvii.i-p9.4"></span>הר
כמו צפור, *har kemo tsippor,*  <span id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md)
that is, *into the mountain as a bird,* without a pronoun.  <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) But if we follow what I have said, it
will agree very well with the scope of the passage to read thus, *Flee
ye into your mountain,* for you are not permitted to dwell in your own
country. I do not, however, think that any particular mountain is
pointed out, but that David was sent away to the desert rocks wherever
chance might lead him. Condemning those who gave him this advice, he
declares that he depends upon the promise of God, and is not at all
disposed thus to go away into exile. Such, then, was the condition of
David, that, in his extreme necessity, all men repelled and chased him
far away into desert places.

<span id="xvii.i-p12"></span>But as he seems to intimate that it would
be a sign of distrust were he to place his safety in flight, it may be
asked, whether or not it would have been lawful for him to flee; yea, we
know that he was often forced to retire into exile, and driven about
from place to place, and that he even sometimes hid himself in caves. I
answer, it is true he was unsettled like a poor fearful bird, which
leaps from branch to branch,  <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md)
and was compelled to seek for different bypaths, and to wander from
place to place to avoid the snares of his enemies; yet still his faith
continued so steadfast that he never alienated himself from the people
of God. Others accounted him a lost man, and one whose affairs were in a
hopeless condition, setting no more value upon him than if he had been a
rotten limb,  <span id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) yet he never
separated himself from the body of the Church. And certainly these
words, *Flee ye,* tended only to make him yield to utter despair. But it
would have been wrong for him to have yielded to these fears, and to
have betaken himself to flight, as if uncertain of what would be the
issue. He therefore says expressly, that this *was spoken to his soul,*
meaning that his heart was deeply pierced by such an ignominious
rejection, since he saw (as I have said) that it tended only to shake
and to weaken his faith. In short, although he had always lived
innocently, as it became a true servant of God, yet these malignant men
would have doomed him to remain for ever in a state of exile from his
native country. This verse teaches us, that however much the world may
hate and persecute us,  <span id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) we ought
nevertheless to continue steadfast at our post, that we may not deprive
ourselves of a right to lay claim to the promises of God, or that these
may not slip away from us; and that, however much and however long we
may be harassed, we ought always to continue firm and unwavering in the
faith of our having the call of God.

<span id="xvii.i-p16"></span><span id="xvii.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p17"></span>**2.** *Surely, behold! the ungodly.* Some
think that this is added as the excuse made by those who desired David
to save himself by flight. According to others, David expostulates with
his countrymen, who saw death menacing him on all sides, and yet denied
him shelter. But, in my judgment, he here continues his account of the
trying circumstances in which he was placed. His design is not only to
place before our view the dangers with which he was surrounded, but to
show us that he was exposed even to death itself. He therefore says,
that wherever he might hide himself, it was impossible for him to escape
from the hands of his enemies. Now, the description of so miserable a
condition illustrates the more strikingly the grace of God in the
deliverance which he afterwards granted him. With respect to the words,
*they have fixed their arrows upon the string, to* Shoot Secretly, or
*in darkness,* some understand them metaphorically of the attempts which
David’s enemies made to surprise him by craft and snares. I, however,
prefer this interpretation, as being more simple, - that there was no
place so hidden into which the darts of his enemies did not penetrate,
and that, therefore, to whatever caves he could betake himself for
concealment and shelter, death would follow him as his inseparable
attendant.

<span id="xvii.i-p18"></span><span id="xvii.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p19"></span>**3.** *Truly, the foundations are
destroyed.* Some translate the word <span
id="xvii.i-p19.1"></span>השתות, *hashathoth,* by *nets,* a sense in
which the Scripture in other places often uses this word; and their
explanation of the words is, that the wicked and deceitful arts which
the ungodly practiced against David were defeated. If we admit this
interpretation, the meaning of what he adds immediately after, *What
hath the righteous one done?* will be, that his escape in safety was
owing neither to his own exertion, nor to his own skill, but that,
without putting forth any effort, and when, as it were, he was asleep,
he had been delivered from the nets and snares of his enemies by the
power of God. But the word *foundations* agrees better with the scope of
the passage, for he evidently proceeds to relate into what straits he
had been brought and shut up, so that his preservation was now to all
appearance hopeless. Interpreters, however, who hold that *foundations*
is the proper translation of the word, are not agreed as to the sense.
Some explain it, that he had not a single spot on which to fix his foot;
others, that covenants which ought to have stability, by being
faithfully kept, had been often shamefully violated by Saul. Some also
understand it allegorically, as meaning that the righteous priests of
God, who were the pillars of the land, had been put to death. But I have
no doubt of its being a metaphor taken from buildings, which must fall
down and become a heap of ruins when their foundations are undermined;
and thus David complains, that, in the eyes of the world, he was utterly
overthrown, inasmuch as all that he possessed was completely destroyed.
In the last clause, he again repeats, that to be persecuted so cruelly
was what he did not deserve: *What hath the righteous one done?* And he
asserts his own innocence, partly to comfort himself in his calamities
from the testimony of a good conscience, and partly to encourage himself
in the hope of obtaining deliverance. That which encouraged him to trust
in God was the belief which he entertained, that on account of the
justice of his cause God was on his side, and would be favorable to him.

<span id="xvii.ii"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xvii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
11:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#004.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p2"></span>**4.** Jehovah is in the palace of his
holiness: Jehovah has his throne in heaven; his eyes behold,  <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) and his eyelids consider the children
of men. **5.** Jehovah approves the righteous man; but his soul hateth
the ungodly, and him who loveth iniquity.

<span id="xvii.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.ii-p5"></span><span id="xvii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p6"></span>**4.** *Jehovah is in the palace of his
holiness.* In what follows, the Psalmist glories in the assurance of the
favor of God, of which I have spoken. Being destitute of human aid, he
betakes himself to the providence of God. It is a signal proof of faith,
as I have observed elsewhere, to take and to borrow, so to speak,  <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) light from heaven to guide us to the
hope of salvation, when we are surrounded in this world with darkness on
every side. All men acknowledge that the world is governed by the
providence of God; but when there comes some sad confusion of things,
which disturbs their ease, and involves them in difficulty, there are
few who retain in their minds the firm persuasion of this truth. But
from the example of David, we ought to make such account of the
providence of God as to hope for a remedy from his judgment, even when
matters are in the most desperate condition. There is in the words an
implied contrast between heaven and earth; for if David’s attention had
been fixed on the state of things in this world, as they appeared to the
eye of sense and reason, he would have seen no prospect of deliverance
from his present perilous circumstances. But this was not David’s
exercise; on the contrary, when in the world all justice lies trodden
under foot, and faithfulness has perished, he reflects that God sits in
heaven perfect and unchanged, from whom it became him to look for the
restoration of order from this state of miserable confusion. He does not
simply say that God dwells in heaven; but that he reigns there, as it
were, in a royal palace, and has his throne of judgment there. Nor do we
indeed render to him the honor which is his due, unless we are fully
persuaded that his judgment-seat is a sacred sanctuary for all who are
in affliction and unrighteously oppressed. When, therefore, deceit,
craft, treachery, cruelty, violence, and extortion, reign in the world;
in short, when all things are thrown into disorder and darkness by
injustice and wickedness, let faith serve as a lamp to enable us to
behold God’s heavenly throne, and let that sight suffice to make us wait
in patience for the restoration of things to a better state. *The temple
of his holiness,* or *his holy temple,* which is commonly taken for
*Sion,* doubtless here signifies *heaven;* and that it does so is
clearly shown by the repetition in the next clause, *Jehovah has his
throne in Heaven;* for it is certain David expresses the same thing
twice.

<span id="xvii.ii-p8"></span>*His eyes behold.* Here he infers, from the
preceding sentence, that nothing is hidden from God, and that,
therefore, men will be obliged to render up to him an account of all
that they have done. If God reigns in heaven, and if his throne is
erected there, it follows that he must necessarily attend to the affairs
of men, in order one day to sit in judgment upon them. Epicurus, and
such like him as would persuade themselves that God is idle, and
indulges in repose in heaven, may be said rather to spread for him a
couch on which to sleep than to erect for him a throne of judgment. But
it is the glory of our faith that God, the Creator of the world, does
not disregard or abandon the order which he himself at first
established. And when he suspends his judgments for a time, it becomes
us to lean upon this one truth that he beholds from heaven; just as we
now see David contenting himself with this consolatory consideration
alone, that God rules over mankind, and observes whatever is transacted
in the world, although his knowledge, and the exercise of his
jurisdiction, are not at first sight apparent. This truth is still more
clearly explained in what is immediately added in the fifth verse, that
God distinguishes between the righteous and the unrighteous, and in such
a way as shows that he is not an idle spectator; for he is said *to
approve the righteous, and to hate the wicked* The Hebrew word <span
id="xvii.ii-p8.1"></span>בחן, *bachan,* which we have rendered *to
approve,* often signifies *to examine* or *try.* But in this passage I
explain it as simply meaning, that God so inquires into the cause of
every man as to distinguish the righteous from the wicked. It is farther
declared, that God hates those who are set upon the infliction of
injuries, and upon doing mischief. As he has ordained mutual intercourse
between men, so he would have us to maintain it inviolable. In order,
therefore, to preserve this his own sacred and appointed order, he must
be the enemy of the wicked, who wrong and are troublesome to others.
There is also here contrasted God’s hatred of the wicked, and wicked
men’s *love of iniquity,* to teach us that those who please and flatter
themselves in their mischievous practices gain nothing by such
flatteries, and only deceive themselves.

<span id="xvii.iii"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xvii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
11:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#006.md)<span id="xvii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p2"></span>**6.** He will rain upon the ungodly
snares, fire and brimstone, and a storm of whirlwinds: this is the
portion of their cup. **7.** For the righteous Jehovah loveth
righteousness;  <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) his countenance

<span id="xvii.iii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xvii.iii-p6"></span><span id="xvii.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p7"></span>**6.** *He will rain upon the ungodly.*
David now, in the last place, lays it down as a certain truth, that
although God, for a time, may be still and delay his judgments, yet the
hour of vengeance will assuredly come. Thus we see how by degrees he
rises up to the hope of a happy issue to his present affliction, and he
uses his efforts to attain this, that the social and moral disorder,
which he saw prevailing around him, might not weaken his faith. As the
tribunal of God remains firm and immovable, he, in the first place,
sustains and comforts himself from the consideration, that God from on
high beholds all that is done here below. In the next place, he
considers what the office of judge requires, from which he concludes,
that the actions of men cannot escape the inspection of God’s omniscient
eye, and that although he does not immediately punish their evil deeds,
he hates all the wicked. Finally, he adds, that since God is armed with
power, this hatred will not be in vain or ineffectual. Thus while God
defers the infliction of punishment, the knowledge of his justice will
have a powerful influence in maintaining our faith, until he actually
show that he has never departed from his watch-tower, from which he
beholds the actions of men.  <span id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) He
appropriately compares the punishments which God inflicts to rain. As
rain is not constant, but the Lord sends it forth when he pleases; and,
when the weather is calmest and most serene, suddenly raises a storm of
hail or violent showers of rain; in like manner, it is here intimated
that the vengeance which will be inflicted on the wicked will come
suddenly, so that, when they shall be indulging in mirth, and
intoxicated with their pleasures, and “when they shall say, Peace and
safety, sudden destruction will come upon them.”  <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) At the same time, David here evidently
alludes to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. As the prophets, when
they would promise the grace of God to the elect, remind them of the
deliverance from Egypt, which God wrought in behalf of his ancient
people, so when they would alarm the wicked, they threaten them with a
destruction like that which befell Sodom and Gomorrah, and they do so
upon good grounds; since Jude, in his Epistle, tells us that these
cities “are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal
fire,” (<span id="xvii.iii-p9.2"></span>[Jude
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007)<span id="xvii.iii-p9.2"></span>.md)
The Psalmist, with much beauty and propriety, puts *snares*  <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) before fire and brimstone. We see that
the ungodly, while God spares them, fear nothing, but give themselves
ample scope in their wayward courses, like horses let loose  <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) in an open field; and then, if they
see any adversity impending over them, they devise for themselves ways
of escape; in short, they continually mock God, as if they could not be
caught, unless he first entangle and hold them fast in his snares. God,
therefore, begins his vengeance by snares, shutting up against the
wicked every way of escape; and when he has them entangled and bound, he
thunders upon them dreadfully and horribly, like as he consumed Sodom
and the neighboring cities with fire from heaven. The word <span
id="xvii.iii-p11.2"></span>זלעפות, *zilaphoth,* which we have rendered
*whirlwinds,* is by some translated *kindlings* or *burnings;* and by
others, *commotions* or *terrors.*  <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) But the context requires the
interpretation which I have brought forward; for a tempest is raised by
stormy winds, and then follow thunder and lightning.

<span id="xvii.iii-p13"></span>*The portion of their cup.* By this
expression he testifies that the judgments of God will certainly take
effect, although ungodly men may delude themselves by deceitful
flattery. This metaphor is frequently to be met with in the Scriptures.
As the carnal mind believes nothing with greater difficulty than that
the calamities and miseries which seem to be fortuitous, happen
according to a just distribution from God, he represents himself under
the character of a householder, who distributes to each member his
portion or allowance. David, therefore, here intimates that there is
certainly a reward laid up for the ungodly; that it will be in vain for
them to resist, when the Lord shall reach to them the cup of his wrath
to drink; and that the cup prepared for them is not such as they may sip
drop by drop, but a cup, the whole of which they will be compelled to
drink, as the prophet threatens,

<span id="xvii.iii-p14"></span>(<span id="xvii.iii-p14.1"></span>[Eze
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#034.md)<span
id="xvii.iii-p14.1"></span>) “Thou shalt drink it off even to the
dregs.”

<span id="xvii.iii-p15"></span><span id="xvii.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p16"></span>**7.** *For the righteous Jehovah loveth
righteousness.* The Psalmist has just now reasoned from the office of
God that he will punish the wicked, and now, from the nature of God, he
concludes, that he will be the defender of the good and the upright. As
he is righteous, David shows that, as the consequence of this, he must
love righteousness, for otherwise he would deny himself. Besides, it
would be a cold speculation to conceive of righteousness as inherent in
God, unless, at the same time, we could come to the settled conclusion
that God graciously owns whatever is his own, and furnishes evidence of
this in the government of the world. Some think that the abstract term
*righteousness* is put for *righteous persons.* But, in my opinion, the
literal sense is here more suitable, namely, that righteousness is well
pleasing to God, and that, therefore, he favors good causes. From this
the Psalmist concludes, that the upright are the objects of his regard:
*His countenance approveth the upright* He had said a little before in a
different sense, that God beholds the children of men, meaning that he
will judge the life of every man; but here he means that God graciously
exercises a special care over the upright and the sincere, takes them
under his protection, and keeps them in perfect safety. This conclusion
of the psalm sufficiently shows, that the scope of the whole of it was
to make it manifest that all those who, depending upon the grace of God,
sincerely follow after righteousness, shall be safe under his
protection. The Psalmist himself was one of this number and, indeed, the
very chief of them. This last clause, *His countenance approveth the
upright,* is, indeed, variously explained; but the true meaning, I have
no doubt, is, that God has always a regard for the upright, and never
turns away his eyes from them. It is a strained interpretation to view
the words as meaning that the upright shall behold the face of God. But
I will not stop to refute the opinions of other men.

Hebrew letters, the verb is in the plural number; but according to the
Hebrew punctuation, which regulates the reading, it is in the singular.
*Piscator*, in his commentary on this passage, observes, <span
id="xvii.i-p9.1"></span>נודו, *nudi,* according to the points, is
singular and feminine, and refers to the soul of David; according to the
letters it is plural, <span id="xvii.i-p9.2"></span>נודו, *nudu,* and
refers to David and his associates. This last reading appears to me the
most appropriate, both because it is followed by the relative in the
plural number, and because it does not seem to be a proper or natural
mode of expression, to speak of persons addressing the soul of another”
The phrase, *to my soul,* however, may simply mean *to me,* a sense in
which it is frequently used in Scripture.

<span id="xvii.i-p10"></span> This is the reading adopted by the
Chaldee, Septuagint, and Vulgate versions. *Hammond* observes, that
“where the Hebrew now reads, <span id="xvii.i-p10.1"></span>הרכם צפור*,
har kemo tsippor, To your mountain a sparrow,* all the ancient
interpreters uniformly read, *To the mountain as a sparrow.” Horsley*
translates the words, “Flee, sparrows, to your hill,” and views the
expression “as proverbial, denoting a situation of helplessness and
danger, in which there was no hope of safety but in flight” The noun,
<span id="xvii.i-p10.2"></span>צפור *tsippor,* which he renders
*sparrows,* is singular, and it is here construed with a plural verb and
a plural pronoun. But he remarks, that as this word, like most names of
animals in the Hebrew language, signifies either the individual or the
species, it may here be used in the singular number for many
individuals, and construed with plural verbs, adjectives, and pronouns.

<span id="xvii.iii-p10"></span> *Horsley* reads, “glowing embers.”
*Lowth* renders the word “live coals,” and observes, that <span
id="xvii.iii-p10.1"></span>פתים, *pachim,* means *globes of fire,* or
simply the *lightning.* “This,” says he, “is certainly more agreeable to
the context than *snares.* The root is *puach,* which, though it
sometimes means *to ensnare,* yet more frequently means *to breathe
forth,* or *emit,* fire, for instance. <span
id="xvii.iii-p10.2"></span>[Eze
21:31](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#031.md)<span
id="xvii.iii-p10.2"></span>, ‘In the fire of my wrath I will blow upon
thee.’ The Ammonites are spoken of as thrown into the furnace of the
divine wrath: compare <span id="xvii.iii-p10.3"></span>[Eze
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#021.md)<span
id="xvii.iii-p10.3"></span>, where almost the same words occur, except
that the corresponding (and in this case synonymous) verb *apach* is
made use of, whence *mapnach,* a bellows, <span
id="xvii.iii-p10.4"></span>[Jer
6:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#029.md)<span id="xvii.iii-p10.4"></span>.
In the same sense the verb *puach* is introduced, <span
id="xvii.iii-p10.5"></span>[Pr
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#008.md)<span id="xvii.iii-p10.5"></span>,
‘Scorners will *inflame* a city.’ From this explication of the root
*puach,* the word *pach, a coal blown up,* is rightly derived.” —
*Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews,* volume. 1, pp. 194, 195. *Lowth* also
states, that the Orientals sometimes call the lightning *snares* or
*chains,* probably from the continual coruscations of the lightning in
its passage through the air, which seem to be connected with each other
like a chain. *Hengstenberg*, however, opposes this exposition, and
adopts and defends that which Calvin has given. “<span
id="xvii.iii-p10.6"></span>פחים,” says he, “must here, according to most
expositors, be taken as a figurative designation of *lightning,* which
is alleged to be called also by the Arabians, in prose and poetry, by
the name of *chains.* But it is a sufficient objection to this meaning,
that <span id="xvii.iii-p10.7"></span>פח does not signify *cord,* in
general, but specially, gin, snare, trap.” In proof of this, he quotes
<span id="xvii.iii-p10.8"></span>[Ps
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#015.md)<span id="xvii.iii-p10.8"></span>;
<span id="xvii.iii-p10.9"></span>[Job
18:9](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#009.md), [Job
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#010.md)<span
id="xvii.iii-p10.9"></span>; <span id="xvii.iii-p10.10"></span>[Isa.
24:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#017.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#018.md)<span id="xvii.iii-p10.10"></span>;
<span id="xvii.iii-p10.11"></span>[Pr
22:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#005.md)<span
id="xvii.iii-p10.11"></span>. “The expression, *that he will rain,”*
says he, “can present no proper difficulty, as it simply points to the
fullness of God’s retributive judgments, noticed already by *Luther*,
when he says, that by it the prophet indicates the great variety and
multitude of the evils threatened.”

<span id="xvii.iii-p12"></span> *Dr Adam Clarke* renders the words <span
id="xvii.iii-p12.2"></span>רוה זלעפות, *ruach zilaphoth,* “the spirit of
terrors,” and states, that “this may refer to the horribly suffocat ing
Arabian wind called *Sinurn.” Bishop* *Lowth* translates the words, “a
burning storm,” upon which *Michaelis* observes, “This is an admirable
image, and is taken from the school of nature. The wind *zilgaphoth,*
which blows from the east, is very pestilential, and, therefore, almost
proverbial among the Orientals Many wonderful stories are related of its
effects by the Arabians, and their poets feign that the wicked, in their
place of eternal torment, are to breathe this pestiferous wind as their
vital air.” — *Lowth’s Sacred Poetry,* vol. 1, p. 193. *Hengstenberg*
translates the words *wrath-wind,* and explains them as simply meaning
the divine anger which breaks forth as a tempest; and observes, that the
vehemence of the anger is denoted by the plural number. In opposition to
the rendering *burning wind,* and to the opinion that there is an
allusion to the Arabian *Samurn,* he states, “The root, <span
id="xvii.iii-p12.3"></span>זעפ has, in Hebrew, the signification of
*being angry,* no other; and that of *being hot,* is not once to be
found in the dialects.”
