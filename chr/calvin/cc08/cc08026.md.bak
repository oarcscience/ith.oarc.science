<span id="xxvii"></span>

<span id="xxvii-p1"></span>PSALM 21.

<span id="xxvii-p2"></span>This psalm contains a public and solemn
thanksgiving for the prosperous and happy condition of the king. Its
subject is almost the same with that of the preceding.  <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md) In the former there was set forth a
common form of prayer, which was designed to excite in the whole people
earnest concern for the preservation of their head. In this it is shown
that the safety and prosperity of the king ought to produce public and
general rejoicing through the whole realm, inasmuch as God by this means
intended to preserve the whole body in safety. But, above all, it was
the design of the Holy Spirit here to direct the minds of the faithful
to Christ, who was the end and perfection of this kingdom, and to teach
them that they could not be saved except under the head which God
himself had appointed over them.

<span id="xxvii-p4"></span>To the chief musician. A psalm of David.

<span id="xxvii.i"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p1"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
21:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#001.md)<span id="xxvii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p2"></span>**1.** The king will rejoice in thy
strength, O Yehovah! and in thy salvation how greatly will he rejoice!
**2.** Thou hast given him the desire of his heart, and hast not denied
him the request of his lips. Selah. **3.** For thou wilt prevent him
with blessings of good, thou wilt set a crown of gold upon his head.
 <span id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md)

<span id="xxvii.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxvii.i-p5"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p6"></span>**1.** *The king will rejoice in thy
strength, O Jehovah!* David could have given thanks to God in private
for the victories and other signal favors which he had received from
him; but it was his intention to testify not only that it was God who
elevated him to the throne, but also that whatever blessings God had
conferred upon him redounded to the public good, and the advantage of
all the faithful. In the beginning of the psalm the believing Israelites
express their firm persuasion that God, who had created David to be
king, had undertaken to defend and maintain him. It therefore appears
that this psalm, as well as the preceding, was composed for the purpose
of assuring the faithful that the goodness of God in this respect
towards David would be of long duration, and permanent; and it was
necessary, in order to their being established in a well-grounded
confidence of their safety; to hope well of their king, whose
countenance was as it were a mirror of the merciful and reconciled
countenance of God. The sense of the words is: Lord, in putting forth
thy power to sustain and protect the king, thou wilt preserve him safe;
and, ascribing his safety to thy power, he will greatly rejoice in thee.
The Psalmist has doubtless put *strength* and *salvation* for *strong
and powerful succor;* intimating, that the power of God in defending the
king would be such as would preserve and protect him against all
dangers.

<span id="xxvii.i-p7"></span>In the second verse there is pointed out
the cause of this joy. The cause was this: that God had heard the
prayers of the king, and had liberally granted him whatever he desired.
It was important to be known, and that the faithful should have it
deeply impressed on their minds, that all David’s successes were so many
benefits conferred upon him by God, and at the same time testimonies of
his lawful calling. And David, there is no doubt, in speaking thus,
testifies that he did not give loose reins to the desires of the flesh,
and follow the mere impulse of his appetites like worldly men, who set
their minds at one time upon this thing, and at another time upon that,
without any consideration, and just as they are led by their sensual
lusts; but that he had so bridled his affections as to desire nothing
save what was good and lawful. According to the infirmity which is
natural to men, he was, it is true, chargeable with some vices, and even
fell shamefully on two occasions; but the habitual administration of his
kingdom was such that it was easy to see that the Holy Spirit presided
over it. But as by the Spirit of prophecy the Psalmist had principally
an eye to Christ, who does not reign for his own advantage, but for
ours, and whose desire is directed only to our salvation, we may gather
hence the very profitable doctrine, that we need entertain no
apprehension that God will reject our prayers in behalf of the church,
since our heavenly King has gone before us in making intercession for
her, so that in praying for her we are only endeavoring to follow his
example.

<span id="xxvii.i-p8"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p9"></span>**3.** *For thou wilt prevent him.* The
change of the tense in the verbs does not break the connection of the
discourse; and, therefore, I have, without hesitation, translated this
sentence into the future tense, as we know that the changing of one
tense into another is quite common in Hebrew. Those who limit this psalm
to the last victory which David gained over foreign nations, and who
suppose that the crown of which mention is here made was the crown of
the king of the Ammonites, of which we have an account in sacred
history, give, in my judgment, too low a view of what the Holy Spirit
has here dictated concerning the perpetual prosperity of this kingdom.
David, I have no doubt, comprehended his successors even to Christ, and
intended to celebrate the continual course of the grace of God in
maintaining his kingdom through successive ages. It was not of one man
that it had been said,

<span id="xxvii.i-p10"></span>“I will be his father, and he shall be my
son,”  
(<span id="xxvii.i-p10.2"></span>[2Sa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014)<span id="xxvii.i-p10.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="xxvii.i-p11"></span>but this was a prophecy which ought to be
extended from Solomon to Christ, as is fully established by the
testimony of Isaiah, (<span id="xxvii.i-p11.1"></span>[Isa
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006)<span id="xxvii.i-p11.1"></span>,.md)
who informs us that it was fulfilled when the Son was given or
manifested. When it is said, *Thou wilt prevent him,* the meaning is,
that such will be the liberality and promptitude of God, in
spontaneously bestowing blessings, that he will not only grant what is
asked from him, but, anticipating the requests of the king, will load
him with every kind of good things far beyond what he had ever expected.
By *blessings* we are to understand abundance or plenteousness. Some
translate the Hebrew word <span id="xxvii.i-p11.2"></span>טוב, *tob,
goodness;*  <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md) but with this I
cannot agree. It is to be taken rather for *the beneficence* or *the
free gifts of God.* Thus the meaning will be, The king shall want
nothing which is requisite to make his life in every respect happy,
since God of his own good pleasure will anticipate his wishes, and
enrich him with an abundance of all good things. The Psalmist makes
express mention of *the crown,* because it was the emblem and ensign of
royalty; and he intimates by this that God would be the guardian of the
king, whom he himself had created. But as the prophet testifies, that
the royal diadem, after lying long dishonored in the dust, shall again
be put upon the head of Christ, we come to the conclusion, that by this
song the minds of the godly were elevated to the hope of the eternal
kingdom, of which a shadow only, or an obscure image, was set forth in
the person of the successors of David. The doctrine of the everlasting
duration of the kingdom of Christ is, therefore, here established,
seeing he was not placed upon the throne by the favor or suffrages of
men, but by God, who, from heaven, set the royal crown upon his head
with his own hand.

<span id="xxvii.ii"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxvii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
21:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#004.md)<span id="xxvii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p2"></span>**4.** He asked life from thee, and thou
hast given him length of days for ever and ever. **5.** His glory is
great in thy salvation: thou hast put upon him splendor and beauty.
 <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) **6.** For thou hast set him to
be blessings for ever: thou hast gladdened him with joy before thy
countenance, \[or, in thy presence.\]

<span id="xxvii.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxvii.ii-p5"></span><span id="xxvii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p6"></span>**4.** *He asked life from thee.* This
verse confirms what I have formerly said, that this psalm is not to be
limited to the person of any one man. David’s life, it is true, was
prolonged to an advanced period, so that, when he departed from this
world, he was an old man, and full of days; but the course of his life
was too short to be compared to this *length of days,* which is said to
consist of many ages. Even if we reckon the time from the commencement
of David’s reign to the captivity of Babylon, this length of days will
not be made up and completed in all David’s successors. David,
therefore, without doubt, comprehends the Eternal King. There is here a
tacit comparison between the beginnings of this kingdom, which were
obscure and contemptible, or rather which were fraught with the most
grievous perils, and which bordered on despair; and the incredible glory
which followed, when God, exempting it from the common lot of other
kingdoms, elevated it almost above the heavens. For it is no ordinary
commendation of this kingdom, when it is said, that it shall endure as
long as the sun and moon shall shine in the heavens, (<span
id="xxvii.ii-p6.1"></span>[Ps
72:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#001)<span id="xxvii.ii-p6.1"></span>..md)
David, therefore, in saying that *he asked life,* tacitly points to the
distressed circumstances to which he had often been reduced; and the
meaning is, Lord, since the time thou hast called thy servant to the
hope of the kingdom by thy holy anointing, his condition has been such
that he has accounted it a singular blessing to be rescued from the jaws
of death; but now, he has not only, by thy grace, escaped in safety the
dangers which threatened his life: thou hast also promised that his
kingdom will be continued for many ages in his successors. And it serves
not a little to magnify the grace of God, that he vouchsafed to confer
on a poor and miserable man, who was almost at the point of death, not
only his life, - when, amidst the dangers which threatened it, he
tremblingly asked merely its preservations — but also the inestimable
honor of elevating him to the royal dignity, and of transmitting the
kingdom to his posterity for ever. Some expound the verse thus:— Thou
hast given him the life which he asked, even to the prolonging of his
days for ever and ever. But this seems to me a cold and strained
interpretation. We must keep in view the contrast which, as I have said,
is here made between the weak and contemptible beginnings of the
kingdom, and the unexpected honor which God conferred upon his servant,
in calling the moon to witness that his seed should never fail. The same
has been exemplified in Christ, who, from contempt, ignominy, death, the
grave, and despair, was raised up by his Father to the sovereignty of
heaven, to sit at the Father’s right hand for ever, and at length to be
the judge of the world.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p7"></span><span id="xxvii.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p8"></span>**5.** *His glory is great.* By these
words the people intimate that their king, through the protection which
God afforded him, and the deliverances which he wrought for him, would
become more renowned than if he had reigned in peace with the applause
of all men, or had been defended by human wealth and human strength, or,
finally, had continued invincible by his own power and policy; for
thereby it appeared the more clearly that he had only attained to the
royal dignity by the favor, conduct, and commandment of God. The
believing Israelites, therefore, leave it to heathen kings to ennoble
themselves by their own achievements, and to acquire fame by their own
valor; and they set more value upon this, that God graciously showed
himself favorable towards their king,  <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) than upon all the triumphs of the
world. At the same time, they promise themselves such assistance from
God as will suffice for adorning the king with majesty and honor.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p10"></span><span id="xxvii.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p11"></span>**6.** *For thou hast set him to be
blessings for ever.* Some explain these words simply thus, That God had
chosen David to be king, in order to pour upon him his blessings in rich
abundance. But it is evident that something more is intended by this
manner of speaking. It implies, that the king had such an exuberant
abundance of all good things, that he might justly be regarded as a
pattern of the greatness of the divine beneficence; or that, in praying,
his name would be generally used to serve as an example of how the
suppliant wished to be dealt with. The Jews were accustomed to speak of
those being set to be a curse, who were rendered so detestable, and on
whom the dreadful vengeance of God had been inflicted with such
severity, that their very names served for cursing and direful
imprecations. On the other hand, they were accustomed to speak of those
being set to be a blessing, whose names we propose in our prayers as an
example of how we desire to be blessed; as if a man for instance should
say, May God graciously bestow upon thee the same favor which he
vouchsafed to his servant David! I do not reject this interpretation,
but I am satisfied with the other, which views the words as implying
that the king, abounding in all kind of good things, was an illustrious
pattern of the liberality of God. We must carefully mark what is said
immediately after concerning joy: *Thou hast gladdened him with joy
before thy countenance*  <span id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) The
people not only mean that God did good to the king, seeing he looked
upon him with a benignant and fatherly eye, but they also point out the
proper cause of this joy, telling us that it proceeded from the
knowledge which the king had of his being the object of the Divine
favor. It would not be enough for God to take care of us, and to provide
for our necessities, unless, on the other hand, he irradiated us with
the light of his gracious and reconciled countenance, and made us to
taste of his goodness, as we have seen in the 4th Psalm, “There be many
that say, Who will show us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy
countenance upon us, and we shall be saved.” And without all doubt, it
is true and solid happiness to experience that God is so favorable to us
that we dwell as it were in his presence.

<span id="xxvii.iii"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xxvii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
21:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#007.md)<span
id="xxvii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p2"></span>**7.** For the king trusteth in Jehovah,
and through the goodness of the Most High, he shall not be moved. **8.**
Thy hand shall find out all thy enemies, thy right hand shalt find out
those that hate thee. **9.** Thou shalt put them as it were into a
furnace of fire, in the time of thy anger; Jehovah  <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) in his wrath shall overwhelm them, and
the fire shall consume them. **10.** Thou wilt destroy their fruit from
the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxvii.iii-p5"></span><span id="xxvii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p6"></span>**7.** *For the king trusteth.* Here
again the pious Israelites glory that their king shall be established,
because he relies upon God; and they express at the same time how he
relies upon him, namely, by hope or trust. I read the whole verse as one
sentence, so that there is but one principal verb, and explain it thus:-
The king, as he places by faith his dependence on God and his goodness,
will not be subject to the disasters which overthrow the kingdoms of
this world. Moreover, as we have said before, that whatever blessings
the faithful attribute to their king, belong to the whole body of the
Church, there is here made a promise, common to all the people of God,
which may serve to keep us tranquil amidst the various storms which
agitate the world. The world turns round as it were upon a wheel, by
which it comes to pass, that those who were raised to the very top are
precipitated to the bottom in a moment; but it is here promised, that
the kingdom of Judah, and the kingdom of Christ of which it was a type,
will be exempted from such vicissitude. Let us remember, that those only
have the firmness and stability here promised, who betake themselves to
the bosom of God by an assured faith, and relying upon his mercy, commit
themselves to his protection. The cause or the ground of this hope or
trust is at the same time expressed, and it is this, that God mercifully
cherishes his own people, whom he has once graciously received into his
favor.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p7"></span><span id="xxvii.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p8"></span>**8.** *Thy hand shall find.* Hitherto
the internal happiness of the kingdom has been described. Now there
follows, as it was necessary there should, the celebration of its
invincible strength against its enemies. What is said in this verse is
of the same import as if the king had been pronounced victorious over
all his enemies. I have just now remarked, that such a statement is not
superfluous; for it would not have been enough for the kingdom to have
flourished internally, and to have been replenished with peace, riches,
and abundance of all good things, had it not also been well fortified
against the attacks of foreign enemies. This particularly applies to the
kingdom of Christ, which is never without enemies in this world. True,
it is not always assailed by open war, and there is sometimes granted to
it a period of respite; but the ministers of Satan never lay aside their
malice and desire to do mischief, and therefore they never cease to plot
and to endeavor to accomplish the overthrow of Christ’s kingdom. It is
well for us that our King, who lifts up his hand as a shield before us
to defend us, is stronger than all. As the Hebrew word <span
id="xxvii.iii-p8.1"></span>מצא, *matsa,* which is twice repeated, and
which we have translated, *to find,* sometimes signifies *to suffice;*
and, as in the first clause, there is prefixed to the word <span
id="xxvii.iii-p8.2"></span>כל, *kal,* which signifies *all,* the letter
<span id="xxvii.iii-p8.3"></span>ל, *lamed,* which signifies *for,* or
*against,* and which is not prefixed to the Hebrew word which is
rendered *those that hate thee;* some expositors, because of this
diversity, explain the verse as if it had been said, Thy hand shall be
able for all thine enemies, thy right hand shall find out those that
hate thee. Thus the sentence will ascend by degrees, — Thy hand shall be
able to withstand, thy right hand shall lay hold upon thy enemies, so
that they shall not escape destruction.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p9"></span><span id="xxvii.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p10"></span>**9.** *Thou shalt put them as it were
into a furnace of fire.*  <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) The
Psalmist here describes a dreadful kind of vengeance, from which we
gather, that he does not speak of every kind of enemies in general, but
of the malicious and frantic despisers of God, who, after the manner of
the giants  <span id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md) of old, rise up
against his only begotten Son. The very severity of the punishment shows
the greatness of the wickedness. Some think that David alludes to the
kind of punishment which he inflicted upon the Ammonites, of which we
have an account in the sacred history; but it is more probable that he
here sets forth metaphorically the dreadful destruction which awaits all
the adversaries of Christ. They may burn with rage against the Church,
and set the world on fire by their cruelty, but when their wickedness
shall have reached its highest pitch, there is this reward which God has
in reserve for them, that he will cast them into his burning furnace to
consume them. In the first clause, the king is called an avenger; in the
second, this office is transferred to God; and in the third, the
execution of the vengeance is attributed to fire; which three things
very well agree. We know that judgment has been committed to Christ,
that he may cast his enemies headlong into everlasting fire; but, it was
of importance distinctly to express that this is not the judgment of man
but of God. Nor was it less important to set forth how extreme and
dreadful a kind of vengeance this is, in order to arouse from their
torpor those who, unapprehensive of danger, boldly despise all the
threatenings of God. Besides, this serves not a little for the
consolation of the righteous. We know how dreadful the cruelty of the
ungodly is, and that our faith would soon sink under it, if it did not
rise to the contemplation of the judgment of God. The expression, *In
the time of thy wrath,* admonishes us that we ought patiently to bear
the cross as long as it shall please the Lord to exercise and humble us
under it. If, therefore, he does not immediately put forth his power to
destroy the ungodly, let us learn to extend our hope to the time which
our heavenly Father has appointed in his eternal purpose for the
execution of his judgment, and when our King, armed with his terrible
power, will come forth to execute vengeance. While he now seems to take
no notice, this does not imply that he has forgotten either himself or
us. On the contrary, he laughs at the madness of those who go on in the
commission of every kind of sin without any fear of danger, and become
more presumptuous day after day. This laughter of God, it is true,
brings little comfort to us; but we must, nevertheless, complete the
time of our condition of warfare till “the day of the Lord’s vengeance”
come, which, as Isaiah declares, (<span id="xxvii.iii-p12.1"></span>[Isa
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008.md)<span
id="xxvii.iii-p12.1"></span>) shall also be “the year of our
redemption.” It does not seem to me to be out of place to suppose, that
in the last clause, there is denounced against the enemies of Christ a
destruction like that which God in old time sent upon Sodom and
Gomorrah. That punishment was a striking and memorable example above all
others of the judgment of God against all the wicked, or rather it was,
as it were, a visible image upon earth of the eternal fire of hell which
is prepared for the reprobate: and hence this similitude is frequently
to be met with in the sacred writings.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p13"></span><span id="xxvii.iii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p14"></span>**10.** *Thou shalt destroy their fruit
from the earth.* David amplifies the greatness of God’s wrath, from the
circumstance that it shall extend even to the children of the wicked. It
is a doctrine common enough in Scripture, that God not only inflicts
punishment upon the first originators of wickedness, but makes it even
to overflow into the bosom of their children.  <span
id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) And yet when he thus pursues his
vengeance to the third and fourth generation, he cannot be said
indiscriminately to involve the innocent with the guilty. As the seed of
the ungodly, whom he has deprived of his grace, are accursed, and as all
are by nature children of wrath, devoted to everlasting destruction, he
is no less just in exercising his severity towards the children than
towards the fathers. Who can lay any thing to his charge, if he withhold
from those who are unworthy of it the grace which he communicates to his
own children? In both ways he shows how dear and precious to him is the
kingdom of Christ; first, in extending his mercy to the children of the
righteous even to a thousand generations; and, secondly, in causing his
wrath to rest upon the reprobate, even to the third and fourth
generation.

<span id="xxvii.iv"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iv-p1"></span><span id="xxvii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
21:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa021.htm#011.md)<span
id="xxvii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iv-p2"></span>**11.** For they have spread out  <span
id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) evil against thee; they have devised a
stratagem against thee, which they could not accomplish. **12.** For
 <span id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) thou wilt set them as a butt;
thou wilt prepare thy bowstrings to shoot against their faces. **13.**
Raise thyself, O Jehovah! In thy strength; then we will sing, and
celebrate in psalms thy power.

<span id="xxvii.iv-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxvii.iv-p6"></span><span id="xxvii.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iv-p7"></span>**11.** *For they have spread out.* In
this verse David shows that the ungodly had deserved the awful ruin
which he predicted would befall them, since they had not only molested
mortal man, but had also rushed forth in the fury of their pride to make
war against God himself. No man, as has been stated in our exposition of
the second psalm, could offer violence to the kingdom of Israel, which
was consecrated in the person of David, by the commandment of God,
without making foul and impious war against God. Much more when persons
directly attack the kingdom of Christ to overthrow it, is the majesty of
God violated, since it is the will of God to reign in the world only by
the hand of his Son. As the Hebrew word <span
id="xxvii.iv-p7.1"></span>נטה, *natah,* which we have translated *to
spread out,* also sometimes signifies *to turn aside,* it may not
unsuitably be here rendered either way. According to the first view the
meaning is, that the wicked, as if they had spread out their nets,
endeavored to subject to themselves the power of God. According to the
second the meaning is, that for the purpose of hindering, and as it were
swallowing up his power,  <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) they
turned aside their malice, so as to make it bear against it, just like a
man who, having dug a great ditch, turned aside the course of some
torrent to make it fall within it. The Psalmist next declares, that they
*devised a stratagem,* or device, which would fail of its
accomplishment. By these words he rebukes the foolish arrogance of those
who, by making war against God, manifest a recklessness and an audacity
which will undertake any thing, however daring.

<span id="xxvii.iv-p9"></span><span id="xxvii.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iv-p10"></span>**12.** *For thou wilt set them as a
butt.* As the Hebrew word <span id="xxvii.iv-p10.1"></span>שכם,
*shekem,* which we have rendered *a butt,* properly signifies *a
shoulder,* some understand it in that sense here, and explain the
sentence thus: Their heads shall be smitten with heavy blows, so that
having their bodies bended, their shoulders shall appear sticking out.
According to these interpreters, the subjugation of the enemies of God
is here metaphorically pointed out. But there is another explanation
which is more generally received even among the Jewish expositors,
namely, that God will shut them up in some corner, and there keep them
from doing mischief;  <span id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) and they
take this view, because the Hebrew word <span
id="xxvii.iv-p11.1"></span>שכם, *shekem,* is often used to denote a
*corner, quarter,* or *place.* As, however, the sacred writer, in the
clause immediately following, represents God as furnished with a bow,
ready to shoot his arrows directly in their faces, I have no doubt that,
continuing his metaphor, he compares them to a butt, or mound of earth,
on which it is customary to plant the mark which is aimed at, and thus
the sense will flow very naturally thus: Lord, thou wilt make them as it
were a butt against which to shoot thine arrows.  <span
id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) The great object which the Psalmist
has in view is doubtless to teach us to exercise patience, until God, at
the fit time, bring the ungodly to their end.

<span id="xxvii.iv-p15"></span><span id="xxvii.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iv-p16"></span>**13.** *Raise thyself, O Jehovah!* The
psalm is at length concluded with a prayer, which again confirms that
the kingdom which is spoken of is so connected with the glory of God,
that his power is reflected from it. This was no doubt true with respect
to the kingdom of David; for God in old time displayed his power in
exalting him to the throne. But what is here stated was only fully
accomplished in Christ, who was appointed by the heavenly Father to be
King over us, and who is at the same time God manifest in the flesh. As
his divine power ought justly to strike terror into the wicked, so it is
described as full of the sweetest consolation to us, which ought to
inspire us with joy, and incite us to celebrate it with songs of praise
and thanksgivings.

<span id="xxvii-p3"></span> “What was anticipated in the preceding
psalm, the present poem appears to celebrate as having been achieved.” —
*Drake’s Harp of Judah.*

<span id="fn_479"></span>[480](cc08026.htm#fr_479.md) <span
id="xxvii.i-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p3"></span> The Hebrew word is <span
id="xxvii.i-p3.1"></span>פז, *paz,* denoting fine gold, the purest gold,
the same word which is used in <span id="xxvii.i-p3.2"></span>[Ps
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010.md)<span id="xxvii.i-p3.2"></span>

<span id="fn_480"></span>[481](cc08026.htm#fr_480.md) <span
id="xxvii.i-p11.3"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p12"></span> Reading “blessings of goodness;” that is,
the best or most excellent blessings.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[482](cc08026.htm#fr_481.md) <span
id="xxvii.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p3"></span> Splendour and beauty. “*Parkhurst*
observes, that the two words thus translated are often joined in
Scripture. The former seems to denote ‘the *splendor* or *glory* itself;
the latter the *ornament, beauty,* or *majesty,* resulting from that
*glory.”* — *Bishop Mant.*

<span id="fn_482"></span>[483](cc08026.htm#fr_482.md) <span
id="xxvii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p9"></span> “<span id="xxvii.ii-p9.1"></span>Que la
grace de Dieu se monstre favorable envers leur Roy.” — Fr.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[484](cc08026.htm#fr_483.md) <span
id="xxvii.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p12"></span> *Walford* reads this clause — “Thou hast
made him glad with the joy of thy presence.”

<span id="fn_484"></span>[485](cc08026.htm#fr_484.md) <span
id="xxvii.iii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p3"></span> This is rendered according to the
pointing in the French version. According to the pointing in the Latin
version, *Jehovah* is joined to the preceding clause thus: — “In the
time of thy anger, O Jehovah!”

<span id="fn_485"></span>[486](cc08026.htm#fr_485.md) <span
id="xxvii.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p11"></span> *French* and *Skinner’s* translation of
these words is the same, and so also is that of *Rogers*. This last
author observes, “The common interpretation, *Thou shalt make them like
a fiery oven,* etc., is not very intelligible. I consider <span
id="xxvii.iii-p11.1"></span>כתור as put by ellipsis for <span
id="xxvii.iii-p11.2"></span>כבתנור *Thou shalt place them as it were*
\[in\] *a furnace of fire*.” — (*Rogers’ Book of Psalms*, in Hebrew,
metrically arranged, vol. 2, p. 178.) *Poole* takes the same view.
Calvin, however, in his French version, gives a translation much the
same as that of our English version: ”<span
id="xxvii.iii-p11.3"></span>Tu les rendras comme une fournaise de feu en
temps de ta cholere.” “Thou shalt make them like a furnace of fire, in
the time of thy anger.” This is exactly the rendering of *Horsley*, in
which he is followed by *Walford*. “It describes,” says the learned
prelate, “the smoke of the Messiah’s enemies perishing by fire,
ascending like the smoke of a furnace. ‘The smoke of their torment shall
ascend for ever and ever.’” “How awfully grand,” says *Bishop Mant*, “is
that description of the ruins of the cities of the plain, as the
prospect struck on Abraham’s eye on the fatal morning of their
destruction:’And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the
land of the plain, and beheld, and lo! the smoke of the country went up
as the smoke of a furnace.’”

<span id="fn_486"></span>[487](cc08026.htm#fr_486.md) <span
id="xxvii.iii-p11.4"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p12"></span> The allusion is to the fabulous giants
of heathen mythology, who waged war against heaven.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[488](cc08026.htm#fr_487.md) <span
id="xxvii.iii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p15"></span> “<span id="xxvii.iii-p15.1"></span>Mais
qu’il le fait mesme regorger au sein des enfans d’iceux.” — *Fr*. See
<span id="xxvii.iii-p15.2"></span>[Isa.
65:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#007.md)<span id="xxvii.iii-p15.2"></span>.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[489](cc08026.htm#fr_488.md) <span
id="xxvii.iv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iv-p3"></span> “<span id="xxvii.iv-p3.1"></span>Ou, ont
decliner.” — *Fr*., Or, have turned aside.”

<span id="fn_489"></span>[490](cc08026.htm#fr_489.md) <span
id="xxvii.iv-p3.2"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iv-p4"></span> This verse explains the reason why they
could not accomplish what they had devised.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[491](cc08026.htm#fr_490.md) <span
id="xxvii.iv-p7.2"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iv-p8"></span> “<span id="xxvii.iv-p8.1"></span>Pour
icello empescher et comme engloutir.” — *Fr*.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[492](cc08026.htm#fr_491.md) <span
id="xxvii.iv-p10.2"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iv-p11"></span> *Kimchi* and others read, “Thou wilt put
them into a corner;” which has been understood in this sense, “Thou wilt
thrust them into a corner, and then direct thine arrows against their
faces.” — See *Poole’s Synopsis Criticorum.*

<span id="fn_492"></span>[493](cc08026.htm#fr_492.md) <span
id="xxvii.iv-p11.2"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iv-p12"></span> This is the view taken by *Ainsworth,
Castellio, Cocceius, Diodati, Dathe, Horsley,* and *Fry. Horsley*
translates the verse thus:—

<span id="xxvii.iv-p13"></span>“Truly thou shalt make them a butt for
thine arrows;  
Thou shalt take a steady aim against them.”

<span id="xxvii.iv-p14"></span>“I take,” says he, “<span
id="xxvii.iv-p14.1"></span>כונך, \[the word which he translates *a
steady aim,*\] to be a technical term of archery, to express the act of
taking aim at a particular object.” In our English version it is,
Therefore thou shalt make them turn their backs.” In defense of this
sense of <span id="xxvii.iv-p14.2"></span>שכם, *shekem,* see *Merrick’s
Annotations.* Gesenius takes the word in the same sense. Literally, “thy
bow-string.”
