<p><a name="iv.ii.i-p17"></A><b>1</b> <i>Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ</i>  While Paul is accustomed, in the inscription of his epistles, to employ titles of distinction, with the view of procuring credit for himself and his ministry, there was no need of lengthened commendations in writing to the 		Philippians, who had known him by experience as a true Apostle of Christ, and still acknowledged him as such beyond all controversy. For they had persevered in the calling of God steadfastly, and in an even tenor.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.i-p19"></A><i>Bishops</i>  He names the <i>pastors</i> separately, for the sake of honor. We may, however, infer from this, that the name of <i>bishop</i> is common to all the ministers of the Word, inasmuch as he assigns several <i>bishops</i> to one Church. The titles, therefore, of <i>bishop</i> and <i>pastor</i>, are synonymous. And this is one of the passages which Jerome quotes for proving this in his epistle to Evagrius,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A>
 		 and in his exposition of the Epistle to Titus.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A>
 		 Afterwards   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A>
 		 there crept in the custom of applying the name of <i>bishop</i> exclusively to the person whom the presbyters in each church appointed over their company.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A>
 		 It originated, however, in a human custom, and rests on no Scripture authority. I acknowledge, indeed, that, as the minds and manners of men are, there cannot be order maintained among the ministers of the word, without one presiding over the others. I speak of particular bodies,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A>
 		 not of whole provinces, much less of the whole world. Now, although we must not contend for words, it were at the same time better for us in speaking to follow the Holy Spirit, the author of tongues, than to change for the worse forms of speech which are dictated to us by Him. For from the corrupted signification of the word this evil has resulted, that, as if all the presbyters   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A>
 		 were not colleagues, called to the same office, one of them, under the pretext of a new appellation, usurped dominion over the others.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.i-p26"></A><i>Deacons</i>. This term may be taken in two ways &#8212; either as meaning administrators, and curators of the poor, or for elders, who were appointed for the regulation of morals. As, however, it is more generally made use of by Paul in the former sense, I understand it rather as meaning stewards, who superintended the distributing and receiving of alms. On the 		other points consult the preceding commentaries.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.ii.i-p27"></A><a name="iv.ii.i-p27.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.i-p28"></A><b>3</b> <i>I give thanks</i>. He begins with thanksgiving   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A>
 		 on two accounts &#8212; <i>first</i>, that he may by this token shew his love to the Philippians; and secondly, that, by commending them as to the past, he may exhort them, also, to perseverance in time to come. He adduces, also, another evidence of his love &#8212; the anxiety which he exercised in supplications. It is to be observed, however, that, whenever he makes mention of things that are joyful, he immediately breaks forth 		into thanksgiving &#8212; a practice with which we ought also to be familiar. We must, also, take notice, what things they are for which he gives thanks to God, &#8212; the fellowship of the Philippians in the gospel of Christ; for it follows from this, that it ought to be ascribed to the grace of God. When he says, <i>upon every remembrance of you</i>, he means, &#8220;As often as I remember you.&#8221;</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.ii.i-p30"></A><a name="iv.ii.i-p30.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.i-p31"></A><b>4</b> <i>Always in every prayer</i>. Connect the words in this manner: &#8220;<i>Always presenting prayer for you all in every prayer of mine.</i>&#8221; For as he had said before, that the remembrance of them was an occasion of joy to him, so he now subjoins, that they come into his 		mind as often as he prays. He afterwards adds, that it is <i>with joy </i>that he presents prayer in their behalf. <i>Joy</i> refers to the past; <i>prayer</i> to the future. For he rejoiced in their auspicious beginnings, and was desirous of their perfection. Thus it becomes us always to rejoice in the blessings received from 		God in such a manner, as to remember to ask from him those things that we are still in need of.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.ii.i-p32"></A><a name="iv.ii.i-p32.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.i-p33"></A><b>5</b> <i>For your fellowship</i>. He now, passing over the other clause, states the ground of his joy &#8212; that they had come into the <i>fellowship of the gospel</i>, that is, had become partakers of the gospel, which, as is well 		known, is accomplished by means of faith; for the gospel appears as nothing to us, in respect of any enjoyment of it, until we have received it by faith. At the same time the term <i>fellowship</i> may be viewed as referring to the common society of the saints, as though he had said that they had been associated with all the children of God in the faith of the gospel. When he says, <i>from the first 		day</i>, he commends their promptitude in having shewn themselves teachable immediately upon the doctrine being set before them. The phrase <i>until now</i> denotes their perseverance. Now we know how rare an excellence it is, to follow God immediately upon his calling us, and also to persevere steadfastly unto the end. For many are slow and backward to obey, while there are 		still more that fall short through fickleness and inconstancy.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.ii.i-p35"></A><a name="iv.ii.i-p35.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.i-p36"></A><b>6</b> <i>Persuaded of this very thing.</i> An additional ground of joy is furnished in his confidence in them for the time to come.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A>
 		 But some one will say, why should men dare to assure themselves for to-morrow amidst so great an infirmity of nature, amidst so many impediments, ruggednesses, and precipices?   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A>
 		 Paul, assuredly, did not derive this confidence from the steadfastness or excellence of men, but simply from the fact, that God had manifested his love to the Philippians. And undoubtedly this is the true manner of acknowledging God&#8217;s benefits &#8212; when we derive from them occasion of hoping well as to the future.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A>
 		 For as they are tokens at once of his goodness, and of his fatherly benevolence towards us, what ingratitude were it to derive from this no confirmation of hope and good courage! In addition to this, God is not like men, so as to be wearied out or exhausted by conferring kindness.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A>
 		 Let, therefore, believers exercise themselves in constant meditation upon the favors which God confers, that they may encourage and confirm hope as to the time to come, and always ponder in their mind this syllogism: God does not forsake the work which his own hands have begun, as the Prophet bears witness, (<a name="iv.ii.i-p40.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008">Ps 138:8</a><a name="iv.ii.i-p40.2"></A>; <a name="iv.ii.i-p40.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008">Isa 64:8</a><a name="iv.ii.i-p40.3"></A>;) we are the work of his hands; therefore he will complete what he has begun in us. When I say that we are the work of his hands, I do not refer to mere creation, but to the calling by which we are adopted into the number of his sons. For it is a token to us of our election, that the Lord has called us effectually to himself by his Spirit.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.i-p41"></A>It is asked, however, whether any one can be certain as to the salvation of others, for Paul here is not speaking of himself but of the Philippians. I answer, that the assurance which an individual has respecting his own salvation, is very different from what he has as to that of another. For the Spirit of God is a witness to me of my calling, as he is to each of the elect. As to others, we have no testimony, except from the outward 		efficacy of the Spirit; that is, in so far as the grace of God shews itself in them, so that we come to know it. There is, therefore, a great difference, because the assurance of faith remains inwardly shut up, and does not extend itself to others. But wherever we see any such tokens of Divine election as can be perceived by us, we ought immediately to be stirred up to entertain good hope, both in order that we may not be envious  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A>
 		towards our neighbors, and withhold from them an equitable and kind judgment of charity; and also, that we may be grateful to God.  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A>
 		This, however, is a general rule both as to ourselves and as to others &#8212; that, distrusting our own strength, we depend entirely upon God alone.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.i-p44"></A><i>Until the day of Jesus Christ</i>  The chief thing, indeed, to be understood here is &#8212; until the termination of the conflict. Now the conflict is terminated by death. As, however, the Spirit is accustomed to speak in this manner in reference to the last coming of Christ, it were better to extend the advancement of the grace of Christ 		to the resurrection of the flesh. For although those who have been freed from the mortal body do no longer contend with the lusts of the flesh, and are, as the expression is, beyond the reach of a single dart,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A>
 		 yet there will be no absurdity in speaking of them as in the way of advancement,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A>
 		 inasmuch as they have not yet reached the point at which they aspire, &#8212; they do not yet enjoy the felicity and glory which they have hoped for; and in fine, the day has not yet shone which is to discover the treasures which lie hid in hope. And in truth, when hope is treated of, our eyes must always be directed forward to a blessed resurrection, as the grand object in view.</p>  <a name="iv.ii.ii"></A>

 		 valuators of the gifts of God if we do not reckon as children of God those in whom there shine forth those true tokens of piety, which are the marks by which the Spirit of adoption manifests himself. Paul accordingly says, that equity itself dictates to him,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A>
 		 that he should hope well of the Philippians in all time to come, inasmuch as he sees them to be associated with himself in participation of grace. It is not without due consideration that I have given a different rendering of this passage from that of Erasmus, as the judicious reader will easily perceive. For he states what opinion he has of the Philippians, which was the ground of his hoping well respecting them. He says, then, that they are <i>partakers with him of the same grace</i> in his <i>bonds</i>, and in the <i>defense of the gospel.</i></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p18"></A>To <i>have them in his heart</i> is to reckon them as such in the inmost affection of his heart. For the Philippians had always assisted Paul according to their ability, so as to connect themselves with him as associates for maintaining the cause of the gospel, so far as was in their power. Thus, although they were absent in body, yet, 		on account of the pious disposition which they shewed by every service in their power, he recognises them as in bonds along with him. &#8220;<i>I have you</i>, therefore, <i>in my heart;</i>&#8221; this is, sincerely and without any pretense, assuredly, and with no slight or doubtful opinion &#8212; as what? as <i>partakers of grace</i> &#8212; in what? <i>in my 		bonds</i>, by which the gospel is defended. As he acknowledged them to be such, it was reasonable that he should hope well respecting them.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p19"></A><i>Of my grace and in the bonds.</i> It were a ludicrous thing in the view of the world to reckon a prison to be a benefit from God, but if we estimate the matter aright, it is no common honor that God confers upon us, when we suffer persecution for the sake of his truth. For it was not in vain that it was said,</p>  	 
<p class="Center"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p20"></A>Blessed shall ye be, when men shall afflict and harass you with all kinds of reproaches for my name&#8217;s sake. (<a name="iv.ii.ii-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011">Mt 5:11</a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p20.1"></A>)</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p21"></A>Let us therefore bear in remembrance also, that we must with readiness and alacrity embrace the fellowship of the cross of Christ as a special favor from God. In addition to <i>bonds</i> he subjoins the <i>defense and confirmation of the gospel,</i> that he may express so much the better the 		honourableness of the service which God has enjoined upon us in placing us in opposition to his enemies, so as to bear testimony to his gospel. For it is as though he had entrusted us with the defense of his gospel. And truly it was when armed with this consideration, that the martyrs were prepared to contemn all the rage of the wicked, and to rise superior to every kind of torture. And would that this were present to the mind of all that are called to make a confession of their faith, that 		they have been chosen by Christ to be as advocates to plead his cause! For were they sustained by such consolation they would be more courageous than to be so easily turned aside into a perfidious revolt.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p23"></A>Here, however, some one will inquire, whether the <i>confirmation of the gospel</i> depends on the steadfastness of men. I answer, that the truth of God is in itself too firm to require that it should have support from any other quarter; for though we should all of us be found liars, God, nevertheless, remains true. (<a name="iv.ii.ii-p23.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004">Ro 3:4</a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p23.1"></A>.) There is, however, no absurdity in saying, that weak consciences are confirmed in it by such helps. That kind of confirmation, therefore, of which Paul makes mention, has a relation to men, as we learn from our own experience that the slaughter of so many martyrs has been attended at least with this advantage, that they have been as it were so many seals, by which the gospel has been sealed 		in our hearts. Hence that saying of Tertullian, that &#8220;the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church,&#8221; &#8212; which I have imitated in a certain poem: &#8220;But that sacred blood,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A>
 		 the maintainer of God&#8217;s honor, will be like seed for producing offspring.&#8221;   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p30"></A><b>8.</b> <i>For God is my witness.</i> He now declares more explicitly his affection for them, and, with the view of giving proof of it, he makes use of an oath, and that on good grounds, because we know how dear in the sight of God is the edification of his Church. It was, too, more especially of advantage, that 		Paul&#8217;s affection should be thoroughly made known to the Philippians. For it tends in no small degree to secure credit for the doctrine, when the people are persuaded that they are beloved by the teacher. He calls God as a witness to the truth, inasmuch as he alone is the Truth, and as a witness of his affection, inasmuch as he alone is the searcher of hearts. In the word rendered <i>long after</i>, a 		particular term is made use of instead of a general, and it is a token of affection, inasmuch as we <i>long after</i> those things which are dear to us.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p31"></A><i>In the bowels</i>  He places the <i>bowels of Christ</i> in opposition to carnal affection, to intimate that his affection is holy and pious. For the man that loves according to the flesh has respect to his own advantage, and may from time to time change his mind according to the variety of 		circumstances and seasons. In the meantime he instructs us by what rule the affections of believers ought to be regulated, so that, renouncing their own will, they may allow Christ to sit at the helm. And, unquestionably, true love can flow from no other source than from the <i>bowels of Christ</i>, and this, like a goad, ought to affect us not a little &#8212; that Christ in a manner opens his <i>bowels</i>, that 		by them he may cherish mutual affection between us.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A>

He states, accordingly, the sum of those things which he asked from God in their behalf, that they also may learn to pray after his example, and may aspire at 		proficiency in those gifts. The view taken by some, as though the <i>love of the Philippians</i> denoted the Philippians themselves, as illiterate persons are accustomed very commonly to say, &#8220;Your reverence,&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;Your paternity,&#8221; is absurd. For no instance of such an expression occurs in the writings of Paul, nor had such fooleries come into use. Besides, the statement would be less complete, and, independently of this, the simple and natural meaning 		of the words suits admirably well. For the true attainments of Christians are when they make progress in <i>knowledge</i>, and <i>understanding</i>, and afterwards in <i>love</i>. Accordingly the particle <i>in</i>, according to the idiom of the Hebrew tongue, is taken here to mean <i>with</i>, as I have also rendered it, unless perhaps one should prefer to explain it as meaning <i>by</i>, so as to denote the instrument or formal cause. For, the greater proficiency we make in <i>knowledge</i>, so much the more ought our <i>love</i> to increase. The meaning in that case would be, &#8220;That your love may increase according to the measure of 		knowledge.&#8221; <i>All knowledge</i>, means what is full and complete &#8212; not a knowledge of all things.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A>

For the Lord does not wish that his believing people should employ themselves 		fruitlessly in learning what is of no profit: From this you may gather in what estimation the Sorbonnic theology ought to be held, in which you may spend your whole life, and yet not derive more of edification from it in connection with the hope of a heavenly life, or more of spiritual advantage, than from the demonstrations of Euclid. Unquestionably, although it taught nothing false, it well deserves to be execrable, on the ground that it is a pernicious profanation of spiritual doctrine. For 		<i>Scripture is useful</i>, as Paul says, in <a name="iv.ii.ii-p37.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016">2Ti 3:16</a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p37.1"></A>, but <i>there</i> you will find nothing but cold subtleties of words.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p38"></A><i>That ye may be sincere.</i> This is the advantage which we derive from <i>knowledge</i> &#8212; not that every one may artfully consult his own interests, but that we may live in pure conscience in the sight of God.</p>

Chrysostom explains it in an <i>active</i> sense &#8212; that as he had desired that they 		should be pure and upright in the sight of God, so he now desires that they should lead an honorable life in the sight of men, that they may not injure their neighbors by any evil examples. This exposition I do not reject: the <i>passive</i> signification, however, is better suited to the context, in my opinion. For he desires wisdom for them, with this view &#8212; that they may with unwavering step go forward in their calling <i>until 		the day of Christ</i>, as on the other hand it happens through ignorance,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A>

For the beginning of our well-doing is, when we are sanctified by his Spirit, for he rested upon him, that we might all receive of his fullness.

<p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p43"></A>Paul&#8217;s speaking here of works under the term <i>righteousness</i>, is not at all inconsistent with the gratuitous righteousness of faith.

<p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p39"></A><b>15</b> <i>Some indeed</i>. Here is another fruit of Paul&#8217;s bonds, that not only were the brethren stirred up to confidence by his example &#8212; some by maintaining their position, others by becoming more eager to teach &#8212; but even those who wished him evil were on another account stirred up to publish the 		gospel.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p40"></A><a name="iv.ii.iii-p40.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p41"></A><b>16</b> <i>Some, I say, from contention</i>. Here we have a lengthened detail, in which he explains more fully the foregoing statement; for he repeats that there are two classes of men that are stirred up by his bonds to preach Christ &#8212; the one influenced by contention, that is, by depraved affection &#8212; the other 		by pious zeal, as being desirous to maintain along with him the defense of the gospel. The former, he says, do not <i>preach Christ purely</i>, because it was not a right zeal.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A>
 		 For the term does not apply to doctrine, because it is possible that the man who teaches most purely, may, nevertheless, not be of a sincere mind.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A>
 		 Now, that this impurity was in the mind, and did not shew itself in doctrine, may be inferred from the context. Paul assuredly would have felt no pleasure in seeing the gospel corrupted; yet he declares that he rejoices in the preaching of those persons, while it was not simple or sincere.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p44"></A>It is asked, however, how such preaching could be injurious to him? I answer, that many occasions are unknown to us, inasmuch as we are not acquainted with the circumstances of the times. It is asked farther, &#8220;Since the gospel cannot be preached but by those that understand it, what motive induced those persons to persecute the doctrine of which they approved?&#8221; I answer, that ambition is blind, nay, it is a furious beast. Hence it is not 		to be wondered if false brethren snatch a weapon from the gospel for harassing good and pious pastors.  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A>
 		Paul, assuredly, says nothing here  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A>
 		of which I have not myself had experience. For there are living at this very day those who have preached the gospel with no other design, than that they might gratify the rage of the wicked by persecuting pious pastors. As to Paul&#8217;s enemies, it is of importance to observe, if they were Jews, how mad their hatred was, so as even to forget on what account they hated him. For while they made it their aim to destroy him, they exerted themselves to promote the gospel, on account of which 		they were hostile to him; but they imagined, no doubt, that the cause of Christ would stand or fall  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A>
 		in the person of one individual. If, however, there were envious persons,  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A>
 		who were thus hurried away by ambition, we ought to acknowledge the wonderful goodness of God, who, notwithstanding, gave such a prosperous issue to their depraved affections.</p>

<p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p22"></A><b>20</b> <i>According to my expectation</i>. Should any one object, &#8220;From what do you derive that knowledge?&#8221; he answers, &#8220;From hope.&#8221; For as it is certain that God does not by any means design to frustrate our hope, hope itself ought not to be wavering. Let then the pious reader carefully observe this adverb 		<a name="iv.ii.iv-p22.1"></A><i>secundum</i>, (<i>according to</i>,) that he may be fully assured in his own mind, that it is impossible but that the Lord will fulfill our expectation, inasmuch as it is founded on his own word. Now, he has promised that he will never be wanting to us even in the midst of all tortures, if we are at any time called to make confession of his name. 		Let, therefore, all the pious entertain hope after Paul&#8217;s example, and they will not be put to shame.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p23"></A><i>With all confidence</i>  We see that, in cherishing hope, he does not give indulgence to carnal desires, but places his hope in subjection to the promise of God. &#8220;<i>Christ</i>,&#8221; says he, &#8220;<i>will 		be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death</i> &#8221; By making express mention, however, of the body, he intimates that, amongst the conflicts of the present life, he is in no degree doubtful as to the issue, for we are assured as to this by God. If, accordingly, giving ourselves up to the good pleasure of God, and having in our life the same object in view as Paul had, we expect, in whatever way it may be, a prosperous issue, we 		shall no longer have occasion to fear lest any adversity should befall us; for if we live and die to him, we are his in life and in death.

He expresses the way in which <i>Christ will be magnified</i> &#8212; by full assurance.

Interpreters have hitherto, in my opinion, given a wrong rendering and exposition to this passage; for they make this distinction, that Christ was life to Paul, and death was gain. I, on the other hand, make Christ the subject of discourse in both 		clauses, so that he is declared to be gain in him both in life and in death; for it is customary with the Greeks to leave the word <a name="iv.ii.iv-p27.2"></A>&#960;&#961;&#8057;&#962; to be understood. Besides that this meaning is less forced, it also corresponds better with the foregoing statement, and contains more complete doctrine. He declares that it is indifferent to him, and is all one, whether he lives or dies, because, having Christ, 		he reckons both to be <i>gain</i>. And assuredly it is Christ alone that makes us happy both in death and in life; otherwise, if death is miserable, life is in no degree happier; so that it is difficult to determine whether it is more advantageous to live or to die <i>out of Christ</i>. On the other hand, let Christ be with us, and he will bless our life as well as 		our death, so that both will be happy and desirable for us.</p>  <a name="iv.ii.v"></A>

<p><a name="iv.ii.v-p15"></A><b>22</b> <i>But if to live in the flesh</i>. As persons in despair feel in perplexity as to whether they ought to prolong their life any farther in miseries, or to terminate their troubles by death, so Paul, on the other hand, says that he is, in a spirit of contentment, so well prepared for death or for life, because 		the condition of believers, both in the one case and in the other, is blessed, so that he is at a loss which to choose. <i>If it is worth while;</i> that is, &#8220;If I have reason to believe that there will be greater advantage from my life than from my death, I do not see which of them I ought to prefer.&#8221; <i>To live in the 		flesh</i>, is an expression which he has made use of in contempt, from comparing it with a better life.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iv.ii.v-p16"></A><a name="iv.ii.v-p16.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.v-p17"></A><b>23</b> <i>For I am in a strait</i>  Paul did not desire to live with any other object in view that that of promoting the glory of Christ, and doing good to the brethren. Hence he does not reckon that he has any other advantage from living than the welfare of the brethren. But so far as 		concerns himself personally, it were, he acknowledges, better for him to die soon, because he would be <i>with Christ.</i> By his choice, however, he shews what ardent love glowed in his breast. There is nothing said here as to earthly advantages, but as to spiritual benefit, which is on good grounds supremely desirable in the view of the pious. Paul, however, as if forgetful of himself, does not merely hold himself undetermined, lest he should be 		swayed by a regard to his own benefit rather than that of the Philippians, but at length concludes that a regard to them preponderates in his mind. And assuredly this is in reality to live and die to Christ, when, with indifference as to ourselves, we allow ourselves to be carried and borne away withersoever Christ calls us.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.v-p18"></A><i>Having a desire to be set free and to be with Christ</i>  These two things must be read in connection. For death of itself will never be desired, because such a desire is at variance with natural feeling, but is desired for some particular reason, or with a view to some other end. Persons in despair have recourse to it from having 		become weary of life; believers, on the other hand, willingly hasten forward to it, because it is a deliverance from the bondage of sin, and an introduction into the kingdom of heaven. What Paul now says is this; &#8220;I desire to die, because I will, by this means, come into immediate connection with Christ.&#8221; In the mean time, believers do not cease to regard death with horror, but when they turn their eyes to that life which follows death, they easily overcome all dread by means of that 		consolation. Unquestionably, every one that believes in Christ ought to be so courageous as to <i>lift up his head</i> on mention being made of death, delighted to have intimation of his <i>redemption</i>. (<a name="iv.ii.v-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028">Lu 21:28</a><a name="iv.ii.v-p18.1"></A>.) From this we see how many are Christians only in name, since the greater part, on 		hearing mention made of death, are not merely alarmed, but are rendered almost lifeless through fear, as though they had never heard a single word respecting Christ. O the worth and value of a good conscience! Now faith is the foundation of a good conscience; nay more, it is itself goodness of conscience.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.v-p19"></A><i>To be set free</i>  This form of expression is to be observed. Profane persons speak of death as the destruction of man, as if he altogether perished. Paul here reminds us, that death is the separation of the soul from the body. And this he expresses more fully immediately afterwards, explaining as to what condition awaits believers 		after death &#8212; that of <i>dwelling with Christ</i>  We are <i>with Christ</i> even in this life, inasmuch as the <i>kingdom of God is within us</i>, (<a name="iv.ii.v-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#021">Lu 17:21</a><a name="iv.ii.v-p19.1"></A>,) and <i>Christ dwells in us by faith,</i> (<a name="iv.ii.v-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#017">Eph 3:17</a><a name="iv.ii.v-p19.2"></A>,) and has promised that he <i>will be with us even unto the end of the world</i>, (<a name="iv.ii.v-p19.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020">Mt 28:20</a><a name="iv.ii.v-p19.3"></A>,) but that presence we enjoy only in hope. Hence as 		to our feeling, we are said to be at present at a <i>distance</i> from him. See <a name="iv.ii.v-p19.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006">2Co 5:6</a><a name="iv.ii.v-p19.4"></A>. This passage is of use for setting aside the mad fancy of those who dream that souls sleep when separated from the body, for Paul openly declares that we enjoy Christ&#8217;s presence on being set free from the body.</p>

 		 should acknowledge himself to have been disappointed of his expectation, are of opinion that he was afterwards freed from bonds, and went over many countries of the world. Their fears, however, as to this are groundless, for the saints are accustomed to regulate their expectations according to the word of God, so as not to promise themselves more than God has promised. Thus, when they have a sure token of God&#8217;s will, they in that case place their reliance also 		upon a sure persuasion, which admits of no hesitation. Of this nature is a persuasion respecting a perpetual remission of sins, respecting the aid of the Spirit for the grace of final perseverance, (as it is called,) and respecting the resurrection of the flesh. Of this nature, also, was the assurance of the Prophets respecting their prophecies. As to other things, they expect nothing except conditionally, and hence they subject all events to the providence of God, who, they allow, sees more 		distinctly than they. To <i>remain</i>, means here, to stay for a little while: to <i>continue</i>, means, to remain for a long time.</p>

<p><a name="iv.ii.vi-p13"></A><i>That whether I come</i>  As the Greek phrase made use of by Paul is elliptical, I have made use of <a name="iv.ii.vi-p13.1"></A><i>videam</i><i>, (I see,)</i> instead of <a name="iv.ii.vi-p13.2"></A><i>videns</i><i> (seeing.)</i> If this does not appear satisfactory, you may supply the principal verb <a name="iv.ii.vi-p13.3"></A><i>Intelligam</i><i>, (I may learn,)</i> in this sense: &#8220;Whether, when I shall come and see you, or whether I shall, when absent, hear respecting your condition, I may learn in both ways, both by being present and by 		receiving intelligence, that ye <i>stand in one spirit.</i>&#8221; We need not, however, feel anxiety as to particular terms, when the meaning is evident.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.vi-p14"></A><i>Stand in one spirit</i>  This, certainly, is one of the main excellences of the Church, and hence this is one means of preserving it in a sound state, inasmuch as it is torn to pieces by dissensions. But although Paul was desirous by means of this antidote to provide against novel and strange doctrines, yet he requires a twofold 		unity &#8212; of <i>spirit</i> and <i>soul</i>. The <i>first</i> is, that we have like views; the <i>second</i>, that we be united in heart. For when these two terms are connected together, <a name="iv.ii.vi-p14.1"></A><i>spiritus</i><i> (spirit)</i> denotes the <i>understanding</i>, while <a name="iv.ii.vi-p14.2"></A><i>anima</i><i> (soul)</i> denotes the <i>will</i>. Farther, agreement of views comes first in order; and then from it springs union of inclination.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.vi-p15"></A><i>Striving together for the faith</i>  This is the strongest bond of concord, when we have to fight together under the same banner, for this has often been the occasion of reconciling even the greatest enemies. Hence, in order that he may confirm the more the unity that existed among the Philippians, he calls them to notice that they 		are fellow-soldiers, who, having a common enemy and a common warfare, ought to have their minds united together in a holy agreement. The expression which Paul has made use of in the Greek (<a name="iv.ii.vi-p15.1"></A>&#963;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#952;&#955;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#964;&#8035; &#960;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;) is ambiguous. The old interpreter renders it <a name="iv.ii.vi-p15.2"></A><i>Collaborantes fidei</i><i>, (laboring 		together with the faith.)</i>   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">83</FONT></A>
 		 Erasmus renders it <a name="iv.ii.vi-p16.1"></A><i>Adiuvantes fidem</i><i>, (Helping the faith,)</i> as if meaning, that they gave <i>help</i> to the <i>faith</i> to the utmost of their power. As, however, the dative in Greek is made use of instead of the ablative 		of instrumentality, (that language having no ablative,) I have no doubt that the Apostle&#8217;s meaning is this: &#8220;Let the faith of the gospel unite you together, more especially as that is a common armory against one and the same enemy.&#8221; In this way the particle <a name="iv.ii.vi-p16.2"></A>&#963;&#8059;&#957;, which others refer to <i>faith</i>, I take as referring to the Philippians, and with greater 		propriety, if I am not mistaken. In the first place, every one is aware how effectual an inducement it is to concord, when we have to maintain a conflict together; and farther, we know that in the spiritual warfare we are armed with the <i>shield of faith</i>, (<a name="iv.ii.vi-p16.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016">Eph 6:16</a><a name="iv.ii.vi-p16.3"></A>,) for repelling the enemy; nay, more, faith is both our panoply 		and our victory. Hence he added this clause, that he might shew what is the end of a pious connection. The wicked, too, conspire together for evil, but their agreement is accursed: let us, therefore, contend with one mind under the banner of faith.</p>

 		 that they may not be thrown into confusion by the rage of their adversaries. At that time the most cruel persecutions raged almost everywhere, because Satan strove with all his might to impede the commencement of the gospel, and was the more enraged in proportion as Christ put forth powerfully the grace of his Spirit. He exhorts, therefore, the Philippians to stand forward undaunted, and not be thrown into alarm.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.vi-p20"></A><i>Which is to them a manifest proof</i>. This is the proper meaning of the Greek word, and there was no consideration that made it necessary for others to render it <i>cause.</i> For the wicked, when they wage war against the Lord, do already by a trial-fight, as it were, give a token of their ruin, and the more 		fiercely they insult over the pious, the more do they prepare themselves for ruin. The Scripture, assuredly, nowhere teaches, that the afflictions which the saints endure from the wicked are the <i>cause</i> of their salvation, but Paul in another instance, too, speaks of them as a <i>manifest token</i> or <i>proof</i>, (<a name="iv.ii.vi-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005">2Th 1:5</a><a name="iv.ii.vi-p20.1"></A>,) and instead of <a name="iv.ii.vi-p20.2"></A>&#7956;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#958;&#953;&#957;, which we have here, he in that passage makes use of the term <a name="iv.ii.vi-p20.3"></A>&#7956;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#945;    		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">85</FONT></A>

 		 For persecutions are in a manner seals of adoption to the children of God, if they endure them with fortitude and patience: the wicked give a token of their condemnation, because they stumble against a stone by which they shall be bruised to pieces.

<p><a name="iv.ii.vi-p23"></A><i>And that from God</i>. This is restricted to the last clause, that a taste of the grace of God may allay the bitterness of the cross. No one will naturally perceive the cross a token or evidence of salvation, for they are things that are contrary in appearance. Hence Paul calls the attention of the Philippians to another consideration &#8212; that God by his 		blessing turns into an occasion of welfare things that might otherwise seem to render us miserable. He proves it from this, that the endurance of the cross is the gift of God. Now it is certain, that all the gifts of God are salutary to us. <i>To you</i>, says he,<i> it is given, not only to believe in Christ, but also to suffer for him.</i> Hence even the sufferings themselves are evidences of the grace of 		God; and, since it is so, you have from this source a token of salvation.

 		 And yet, what is more certain, than that it is the highest honor that is conferred upon us by Divine grace, that we suffer for his name either reproach, or imprisonment, or miseries, or tortures, or even death, for in that case he adorns us with his marks of distinction.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">89</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iv.ii.vi-p29"></A><b>29. </b><i>To believe</i>. He wisely conjoins faith with the cross by an inseparable connection, that the Philippians may know that they have been called to the faith of Christ on this condition &#8212; that they endure persecutions on his account, as though he had said that their adoption can no more be separated from the cross, than Christ can 		be torn asunder from himself. Here Paul clearly testifies, that faith, as well as constancy in enduring persecutions,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">91</FONT></A>
 		 is an unmerited gift of God. And certainly the knowledge of God is a wisdom that is too high for our attaining it by our own acuteness, and our weakness shews itself in daily instances in our own experience, when God withdraws his hand for a little while. That he may intimate the more distinctly that both are unmerited, he says expressly &#8212; for Christ&#8217;s sake, or at least that they are given to us on the ground of Christ&#8217;s grace; by which he excludes every idea of 		merit.</p>  	 
<p><a name="iv.ii.vi-p31"></A>This passage is also at variance with the doctrine of the schoolmen, in maintaining that gifts of grace latterly conferred are rewards of our merit, on the ground of our having made a right use of those which had been previously bestowed. I do not deny, indeed, that God rewards the right use of his gifts of grace by bestowing grace more largely upon us, provided only you do not place merit, as they do, in opposition to his unmerited 		liberality and the merit of Christ.</p>

By the same means, too, he shews them, that there is no reason why they should feel troubled on account of his bonds, when they behold the issue of the 		conflict.</p>

The name of <a name="iv.ii.iii-p30.2"></A><i>praetorium</i> was, in the provinces, given to the palace of the governors, both because they 			 administered justice, and had their guards stationed in their residence. Hence it is inferred that, although the Apostle was at Rome when he wrote this, and although the circumstances to which he refers occurred in that city, yet, writing to persons residing in the provinces, he uses the word <i>praetorium</i> in the provincial sense, and means by it the <i>emperor&#8217;s palace</i>.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Illustrated Commentary</i>. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 		</P>
