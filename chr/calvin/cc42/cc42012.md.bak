<span id="v.iii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="v.iii.i"></span>

<span id="v.iii.i-p1"></span><span id="v.iii.i-p1.1"></span>[Colossians
2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#001.md)<span id="v.iii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.i-p2"></span>**1**. For I would that ye knew what great
conflict I have for you, and *for* them at Laodicea, and *for* as many
as have not seen my face in the flesh;

<span id="v.iii.i-p3"></span>**1**. Volo autem vos scire, quantum
certamen habeam pro vobis et iis qui sunt Laodiceae, et quicunque non
viderunt faciem meam in carne;

<span id="v.iii.i-p4"></span>**2**. That their hearts might be
comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full
assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of
God, and of the Father, and of Christ;

<span id="v.iii.i-p5"></span>**2**. Ut consolationem accipiant corda
ipsorum, ubi compacti fuerint in caritate, et in omnes divitias
certitudinis intelligentiae, in agnitionem mysterii Dei, et Patris, et
Christi;

<span id="v.iii.i-p6"></span>**3**. In whom are hid all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge.

<span id="v.iii.i-p7"></span>**3**. In quo sunt omnes thesauri
sapientiae et intelligentiae absconditi.

<span id="v.iii.i-p8"></span>**4**. And this I say, lest any man should
beguile you with enticing words.

<span id="v.iii.i-p9"></span>**4**. Hoc autem dico, ne quis vos decipiat
persuasorio sermone.

<span id="v.iii.i-p10"></span>**5**. For though I be absent in the
flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order,
and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.

<span id="v.iii.i-p11"></span>**5**. Nam et si corpore sum absens,
spiritu tamen sum vobiscum, gaudens et videns ordinem vestrum, et
stabilitatem vestrae in Christum fidei.

<span id="v.iii.i-p12"></span> 

<span id="v.iii.i-p13"></span><span id="v.iii.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.i-p14"></span>**1.** *I would have you know.* He
declares his affection towards them, that he may have more credit and
authority; for we readily believe those whom we know to be desirous of
our welfare. It is also an evidence of no ordinary affection, that he
was concerned about them in the midst of death, that is, when he was in
danger of his life; and that he may express the more emphatically the
intensity of his affection and concern, he calls it a *conflict*. I do
not find fault with the rendering of Erasmus — *anxiety*; but, at the
same time, the force of the Greek word is to be noticed, for <span
id="v.iii.i-p14.1"></span>ἀγών is made use of to denote *contention*. By
the same proof he confirms his statement, that his ministry is directed
to them; for whence springs so anxious a concern as to their welfare,
but from this, that the Apostle of the Gentiles was under obligation to
embrace in his affection and concern even those who were unknown to him?
As, however, there is commonly no love between those who are unknown to
each other, he speaks slightingly of the acquaintance that is contracted
from sight, when he says, *as many as have not seen my face in the
flesh*; for there is among the servants of God a sight different from
that of the flesh, which excites love. As it is almost universally
agreed that the First Epistle to Timothy was written from Laodicea,
some, on this account, assign to Galatia that Laodicea of which Paul
makes mention here, while the other was the metropolis of Phrygia
Pacatiana.  <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md) It seems to me,
however, to be more probable that that inscription is incorrect, as will
be noticed in its proper place.

<span id="v.iii.i-p16"></span><span id="v.iii.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.i-p17"></span>**2.** *That their hearts may receive
consolation.* He now intimates what he desires for them, and shews that
his affection is truly apostolic; for he declares that nothing else is
desired by him than that they may be united together in faith and love.
He shews, accordingly, that it was by no unreasonable affection (as
happens in the case of some) that he had been led to take upon himself
so great a concern for the Colossians and others, but because the duty
of his office required it.

<span id="v.iii.i-p18"></span>The term *consolation* is taken here to
denote that true quietness in which they may repose. This he declares
they will at length come to enjoy in the event of their being *united in
love* and faith. From this it appears where the chief good is, and in
what things it consists — when mutually agreed in one faith, we are also
joined together in mutual love. This, I say, is the solid joy of a pious
mind — this is the blessed life. As, however, love is here commended
from its effect, because it fills the mind of the pious with true joy;
so, on the other hand, the cause of it is pointed out by him, when he
says, in *all fullness of understanding.*  <span
id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) The bond also of holy unity is the
truth of God, when we embrace it with one consent; for peace and
agreement with men flow forth from that fountain.

<span id="v.iii.i-p20"></span>*Riches of the assurance of
understanding.* As many, contenting themselves with a slight taste, have
nothing but a confused and evanescent knowledge, he makes mention
expressly of the *riches of understanding*. By this phrase he means full
and clear perception; and at the same time admonishes them, that
according to the measure of understanding they must make progress also
in love.

<span id="v.iii.i-p21"></span>In the term *assurance*, he distinguishes
between faith and mere opinion; for *that* man truly knows the Lord who
does not vacillate or waver in doubt, but stands fast in a firm and
constant persuasion. This constancy and stability Paul frequently calls
(<span id="v.iii.i-p21.1"></span>πληροφορίαν) *full* *assurance*, (which
term he makes use of here also,) and always connects it with faith, as
undoubtedly it can no more be separated from it than heat or light can
be from the sun. The doctrine, therefore, of the schoolmen is devilish,
inasmuch as it takes away assurance, and substitutes in its place
*moral* *conjecture*,  <span id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md) as they
term it.

<span id="v.iii.i-p23"></span>*Is an acknowledgment of the mystery.*
This clause must be read as added by way of *apposition*, for he
explains what that knowledge is, of which he has made mention — that it
is nothing else than the knowledge of the gospel. For the false apostles
themselves endeavor to set off their impostures under the title of
wisdom, but Paul retains the sons of God within the limits of the gospel
exclusively, that they may desire to *know* *nothing* *else*. (<span
id="v.iii.i-p23.1"></span>[1Co
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002)<span id="v.iii.i-p23.1"></span>..md)
Why he uses the term *mystery* to denote the gospel, has been already
explained. Let us, however, learn from this, that the gospel can be
understood by faith alone — not by reason, nor by the perspicacity of
the human understanding, because otherwise it is a thing that is hid
from us.

<span id="v.iii.i-p24"></span>The *mystery of God* I understand in a
passive signification, as meaning — that in which God is revealed, for
he immediately adds — *and of the Father, and of Christ* — by which
expression he means that God cannot be known otherwise than *in*
*Christ*, as, on the other hand, the Father must necessarily be known
where Christ is known. For John affirms both:

<span id="v.iii.i-p25"></span>He that hath the Son, hath the Father
also: he that hath not the Son, hath also not the Father. (<span
id="v.iii.i-p25.1"></span>[1Jo
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023)<span id="v.iii.i-p25.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iii.i-p26"></span>Hence all that think that they know
anything of God apart from Christ, contrive to themselves an idol in the
place of God; as also, on the other hand, that man is ignorant of
Christ, who is not led by him to the Father, and who does not in him
embrace God wholly. In the mean time, it is a memorable passage for
proving Christ’s divinity, and the unity of his essence with the Father.
For having spoken previously as to the knowledge of God, he immediately
applies it to the Son, as well as to the Father, whence it follows, that
the Son is God equally with the Father.

<span id="v.iii.i-p27"></span><span id="v.iii.i-p27.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.i-p28"></span>**3.** *In whom are all the treasures.*
The expression <span id="v.iii.i-p28.1"></span>*in* *quo* (*in* *whom*,
or *in* *which*) may either have a reference collectively to everything
he has said as to the *acknowledgment of the mystery*, or it may relate
simply to what came immediately before, namely, *Christ*. While there is
not much difference between the one or the other, I rather prefer the
*latter* view, and it is the one that is more generally received. The
meaning, therefore, is, that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
are hid in Christ — by which he means, that we are perfect in wisdom if
we truly know Christ, so that it is madness to wish to know anything
besides Him. For since the Father has manifested himself wholly in Him,
that man wishes to be wise apart from God, who is not contented with
Christ alone. Should any one choose to interpret it as referring to the
*mystery,* the meaning will be, that all the wisdom of the pious is
included in the gospel, by means of which God is revealed to us in his
Son.

<span id="v.iii.i-p29"></span>He says, however, that the *treasures are
hidden*, because they are not seen glittering with great splendor, but
do rather, as it were, lie hid under the contemptible abasement and
simplicity of the cross. For the *preaching* *of* *the* *cross* is
always *foolishness* *to* *the* *world*, as we found stated in
*Corinthians*. (<span id="v.iii.i-p29.1"></span>[1Co
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#018)<span id="v.iii.i-p29.1"></span>..md)
I do not reckon that there is any great difference between *wisdom* and
*understanding* in this passage, for the employment of two different
terms serves only to give additional strength, as though he had said,
that no knowledge, erudition, learning, wisdom, can be found elsewhere.

<span id="v.iii.i-p30"></span><span id="v.iii.i-p30.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.i-p31"></span>**4.** *This I say, that no man may
deceive you.* As the contrivances of men have (as we shall afterwards
see) an appearance of wisdom, the minds of the pious ought to be
preoccupied with this persuasion — that the knowledge of Christ is of
itself amply sufficient. And, unquestionably, this is the key that can
close the door against all base errors.  <span
id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md) For what is the reason why mankind
have involved themselves in so many wicked opinions, in so many
idolatries, in so many foolish speculations, but this — that, despising
the simplicity of the gospel, they have ventured to aspire higher? All
the errors, accordingly, that are in Popery, must be reckoned as
proceeding from this ingratitude — that, not resting satisfied with
Christ alone, they have given themselves up to strange doctrines.

<span id="v.iii.i-p33"></span>With propriety, therefore, does the
Apostle act in writing to the Hebrews, inasmuch as, when wishing to
exhort believers not to allow themselves to be led astray  <span
id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) by strange or new doctrines, he first
of all makes use of this foundation —

<span id="v.iii.i-p35"></span>Christ yesterday, and to-day, and for
ever. (<span id="v.iii.i-p35.1"></span>[Heb
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008)<span id="v.iii.i-p35.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iii.i-p36"></span>By this he means, that those are out of
danger who remain in Christ, but that those who are not satisfied with
Christ are exposed to all fallacies and deceptions. So Paul here would
have every one, that would not be *deceived*, be fortified by means of
this principle — that it is not lawful for a Christian man to know
anything except Christ. Everything that will be brought forward after
this, let it have ever so imposing an appearance, will, nevertheless, be
of no value. In fine, there will be no *persuasiveness of speech*  <span
id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) that can turn aside so much as the
breadth of a finger the minds of those that have devoted their
understanding to Christ. It is a passage, certainly, that ought to be
singularly esteemed. For as he who has taught men to know nothing except
Christ, has provided against all wicked doctrines,  <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md) so there is the same reason why we
should at this day destroy the whole of Popery, which, it is manifest,
is built on ignorance of Christ.

<span id="v.iii.i-p39"></span><span id="v.iii.i-p39.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.i-p40"></span>**5.** *For though I am absent in body.*
Lest any one should object that the admonition was unseasonable, as
coming from a place so remote, he says, that his affection towards them
made him be *present with them in spirit*, and judge of what is
expedient for them, as though he were present. By praising, also, their
present condition, he admonishes them not to fall back from it, or turn
aside.

<span id="v.iii.i-p41"></span>*Rejoicing*, says he, *And seeing*, that
is — “Because *I* *see*.” For *and* means *for*, as is customary among
the Latins and Greeks. “Go on as you have begun, for I know that
hitherto you have pursued the right course, inasmuch as distance of
place does not prevent me from beholding you with the eyes of the mind.”

<span id="v.iii.i-p42"></span>*Order and steadfastness.* He mentions two
things, in which the perfection of the Church consists — *order* among
themselves, and *faith* in Christ. By the term *order*, he means —
agreement, no less than duly regulated morals, and entire discipline. He
commends their *faith*, in respect of its constancy and steadfastness,
meaning that it is an empty shadow of faith, when the mind wavers and
vacillates between different opinions.  <span
id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md)

<span id="v.iii.ii"></span>

<span id="v.iii.ii-p1"></span><span
id="v.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Colossians
2:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#006.md)<span id="v.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.ii-p2"></span>**6**. As ye have therefore received
Christ Jesus the Lord, *so* walk ye in him:

<span id="v.iii.ii-p3"></span>**6**. Quemadmodum igitur suscepistis
Christum Iesum Dominum, in ipso ambulate:

<span id="v.iii.ii-p4"></span>**7**. Rooted and built up in him, and
stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with
thanksgiving.

<span id="v.iii.ii-p5"></span>**7**. Radicati in ipso, et aedificati, et
confirmati in fide, quemadmodum edocti estis, abundantes in ea cum
gratiarum actione.

<span id="v.iii.ii-p6"></span> 

<span id="v.iii.ii-p7"></span><span id="v.iii.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.ii-p8"></span>**6.** *As ye have received.* To
commendation he adds exhortation, in which he teaches them that their
having once received Christ will be of no advantage to them, unless they
remain in him. Farther, as the false apostles held forth Christ’s name
with a view to deceive, he obviates this danger twice, by exhorting them
to go on as they *had been taught*, and as they *had received Christ*.
For in these words he admonishes them, that they must adhere to the
doctrine which they had embraced, as delivered to them by Epaphras, with
so much constancy, as to be on their guard against every other doctrine
and faith, in accordance with what Isaiah said,

<span id="v.iii.ii-p9"></span>This is the way, walk ye in it. (<span
id="v.iii.ii-p9.1"></span>[Isa
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#021.md)<span
id="v.iii.ii-p9.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.iii.ii-p10"></span>And, unquestionbly, we must act in such a
manner, that the truth of the gospel, after it has been manifested to
us, may be to us as a brazen wall  <span
id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) for keeping back all impostures.
 <span id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md)

<span id="v.iii.ii-p13"></span>Now he intimates by *three* metaphors
what steadfastness of faith he requires from them. The *first* is in the
word *walk*. For he compares the pure doctrine of the gospel, as they
had learned it, to a way that is sure, so that if any one will but keep
it he will be beyond all danger of mistake. He exhorts them,
accordingly, if they would not go astray, not to turn aside from the
course on which they have entered.

<span id="v.iii.ii-p14"></span>The *second* is taken from trees. For as
a tree that has struck its roots deep has a sufficiency of support for
withstanding all the assaults of winds and storms, so, if any one is
deeply and thoroughly fixed in Christ, as in a firm root, it will not be
possible for him to be thrown down from his proper position by any
machinations of Satan. On the other hand, if any one has not fixed his
roots in Christ,  <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) he will easily
be

<span id="v.iii.ii-p16"></span>carried about with every wind of
doctrine, (<span id="v.iii.ii-p16.1"></span>[Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.iii.ii-p16.1"></span>,)

<span id="v.iii.ii-p17"></span>just as a tree that is not supported by
any root.  <span id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md)

<span id="v.iii.ii-p19"></span>The *third* metaphor is that of a
foundation, for a house that is not supported by a foundation quickly
falls to ruins. The case is the same with those who lean on any other
foundation than Christ, or at least are not securely founded on him, but
have the building of their faith suspended, as it were, in the air, in
consequence of their weakness and levity.

<span id="v.iii.ii-p20"></span>These two things are to be observed in
the Apostle’s words — that the stability of those who rely upon Christ
is immovable, and their course is not at all wavering, or liable to
error, (and this is an admirable commendation of faith from its effect;)
and, *secondly*, that we must make progress in Christ aye and until we
have taken deep root in him. From this we may readily gather, that those
who do not know Christ only wander into bypaths, and are tossed about in
disquietude.

<span id="v.iii.ii-p21"></span><span id="v.iii.ii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.ii-p22"></span>**7.** *And confirmed in the faith.* He
now repeats without a figure the same thing that he had expressed by
metaphors, — that the prosecution of the way, the support of the root,
and of the foundation, is firmness and steadfastness of faith. And
observe, that this argument is set before them in consequence of their
having been well instructed, in order that they may safely and
confidently secure their footing in the faith with which they had been
made acquainted.

<span id="v.iii.ii-p23"></span>*Abounding*. He would not have them
simply remain immovable, but would have them grow every day more and
more. When he adds, *with thanksgiving*, he would have them always keep
in mind from what source faith itself proceeds, that they may not be
puffed up with presumption, but may rather with fear repose themselves
in the gift of God. And, unquestionably, ingratitude is very frequently
the reason why we are deprived of the light of the gospel, as well as of
other divine favors.

<span id="v.iii.iii"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iii-p1"></span><span
id="v.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Colossians
2:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iii-p2"></span>**8**. Beware lest any man spoil you
through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after
the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p3"></span>**8**. Videte ne quis vos praedetur per
philosophiam et inanem deceptionem, secundum traditionem hominum
secundum elementa mundi,  <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) et non
secundum Christum:

<span id="v.iii.iii-p5"></span>**9**. For in him dwelleth all the
fulness of the Godhead bodily.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p6"></span>**9**. Quoniam in ipso habitat omnis
plenitudo Deitatis corporaliter.  <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md)

<span id="v.iii.iii-p8"></span>**10**. And ye are complete in him, which
is the head of all principality and power:

<span id="v.iii.iii-p9"></span>**10**. Et estis in ipso completi, qui
est caput omnis principatus et potestatis,

<span id="v.iii.iii-p10"></span>**11**. In whom also ye are circumcised
with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the
sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:

<span id="v.iii.iii-p11"></span>**11**. In quo etiam estis circumcisi
circumcisione non manufacta, exuendo corpus peccatorum carnis,
circumcisione, inquam, Christi.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p12"></span>**12**. Buried with him in baptism,
wherein also ye are risen with *him* through the faith of the operation
of God, who hath raised him from the dead.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p13"></span>**12**. Consepulti cum ipso per
baptismum, in quo et consurrexistis per fidem efficaciae Dei, qui
suscitavit illum ex mortuis.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p14"></span> 

<span id="v.iii.iii-p15"></span><span id="v.iii.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iii-p16"></span>**8.** *Beware lest any one plunder
you.* He again instructs them as to the poison, which the antidote
presented by him should be made use of to counteract. For although this,
as we have stated, is a common remedy against all the impostures of the
devil,  <span id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) it had, nevertheless, at
that time a peculiar advantage among the Colossians, to which it
required to be applied. *Beware*, says he, *lest any one plunder you*.
He makes use of a very appropriate term, for he alludes to *plunderers*,
who, when they cannot carry off the flock by violence, drive away some
of the cattle fraudulently. Thus he makes Christ’s Church a sheep-fold,
and the pure doctrine of the gospel the enclosures of the fold. He
intimates, accordingly, that we who are the sheep of Christ repose in
safety when we hold the unity of the faith, while, on the other hand, he
likens the false apostles to *plunderers* that carry us away from the
folds. Would you then be reckoned as belonging to Christ’s flock? Would
you remain in his folds? Do not deviate a nail’s breadth from purity of
doctrine. For unquestionably Christ will act the part of the *good
Shepherd* by protecting us if we but *hear his voice*, and *reject those
of strangers*. In short, the *tenth* chapter of John is the exposition
of the passage before us. \[<span id="v.iii.iii-p17.2"></span>[Joh
10](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#000.md)<span id="v.iii.iii-p17.2"></span>\]

<span id="v.iii.iii-p18"></span>*Through philosophy*. As many have
mistakingly imagined that *philosophy* is here condemned by Paul, we
must point out what he means by this term. Now, in my opinion, he means
everything that men contrive of themselves when wishing to be wise
through means of their own understanding, and that not without a
specious pretext of reason, so as to have a plausible appearance. For
there is no difficulty in rejecting those contrivances of men which have
nothing to set them off,  <span id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) but in
rejecting those that captivate men’s minds by a false conceit of wisdom.
Or should any one prefer to have it expressed in one word, *philosophy*
is nothing else than a persuasive speech, which insinuates itself into
the minds of men by elegant and plausible arguments. Of such a nature, I
acknowledge, will all the subtleties of philosophers be, if they are
inclined to add anything of their own to the pure word of God. Hence
*philosophy* will be nothing else than a corruption of spiritual
doctrine, if it is mixed up with Christ. Let us, however, bear in mind,
that under the term *philosophy* Paul has merely condemned all spurious
doctrines which come forth from man’s head, whatever appearance of
reason they may have. What immediately follows, as to *vain deceit*, I
explain thus; “Beware of *philosophy*, which is nothing else than *vain
deceit*,” so that this is added by way of *apposition*.  <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md)

<span id="v.iii.iii-p21"></span>*According to the tradition of men*. He
points out more precisely what kind of *philosophy* he reproves, and at
the same time convicts it of vanity on a twofold account — because it is
*not* *according* *to* *Christ*, but according to the inclinations of
men;  <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) and because it consists in
the *elements of the world*. Observe, however, that he places Christ in
opposition to the *elements of the world*, equally as to the *tradition
of men*, by which he intimates, that whatever is hatched in man’s brain
is not in accordance with Christ, who has been appointed us by the
Father as our sole Teacher, that he might retain us in the simplicity of
his gospel. Now, that is corrupted by even a small portion of the leaven
of *human* *traditions*. He intimates also, that all doctrines are
foreign to Christ that make the worship of God, which we know to be
spiritual, according to Christ’s rule, to consist in the *elements of
the world*,  <span id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) and also such as
fetter the minds of men by such trifles and frivolities, while Christ
calls us directly to himself.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p24"></span>But what is meant by the phrase —
*elements of the world*?  <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) There
can be no doubt that it means ceremonies. For he immediately afterwards
adduces one instance by way of example — *circumcision*. The reason why
he calls them by such a name is usually explained in two ways. Some
think that it is a metaphor, so that the *elements* are the rudiments of
children, which do not lead forward to mature doctrine. Others take it
in its proper signification, as denoting things that are outward and are
liable to corruption, which avail nothing for the kingdom of God. The
former exposition I rather approve of, as also in <span
id="v.iii.iii-p25.2"></span>[Ga
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#003.md)<span id="v.iii.iii-p25.2"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iii-p26"></span><span id="v.iii.iii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iii-p27"></span>**9.** *For in him dwelleth*. Here we
have the reason why those *elements of the world*, which are taught by
men, do not accord with Christ — because they are additions for
supplying a deficiency, as they speak. Now in Christ there is a
perfection, to which nothing can be added. Hence everything that mankind
of themselves mix up, is at variance with Christ’s nature, because it
charges him with imperfection. This argument of itself will suffice for
setting aside all the contrivances of Papists. For to what purpose do
they tend,  <span id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) but to perfect what
was commenced by Christ?  <span id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) Now
this outrage upon Christ  <span id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) is not
by any means to be endured. They allege, it is true, that they add
nothing to Christ, inasmuch as the things that they have appended to the
gospel are, as it were, a part of Christianity, but they do not effect
an escape by a cavil of this kind. For Paul does not speak of an
imaginary Christ, but of a Christ preached,  <span
id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md) who has revealed himself by express
doctrine.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p32"></span>Further, when he says that the *fullness
of the Godhead* dwells in Christ, he means simply, that God is wholly
found in him, so that he who is not contented with Christ alone, desires
something better and more excellent than God. The sum is this, that God
has manifested himself to us fully and perfectly in Christ.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p33"></span>Interpreters explain in different ways
the adverb *bodily*. For my part, I have no doubt that it is employed —
not in a strict sense — as meaning *substantially*.  <span
id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) For he places this manifestation of
God, which we have in Christ, to all others that have ever been made.
For God has often manifested himself to men, but it has been only in
part. In Christ, on the other hand, he communicates himself to us
wholly. He has also manifested himself to us otherwise, but it is in
figures, or by power and grace. In Christ, on the other hand, he has
appeared to us essentially. Thus the statement of John holds good:

<span id="v.iii.iii-p35"></span>He that hath the Son, hath the Father
also. (<span id="v.iii.iii-p35.1"></span>[1Jo
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023.md)<span
id="v.iii.iii-p35.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.iii.iii-p36"></span>For those who possess Christ have God
truly present, and enjoy Him wholly.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p37"></span><span id="v.iii.iii-p37.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iii-p38"></span>**10.** *And ye are complete in him.* He
adds, that this perfect essence of Deity, which is in Christ, is
profitable to us in this respect, that we are also perfect in him. “As
to God’s dwelling wholly in Christ, it is in order that we, having
obtained him, may posses in him an entire perfection.” Those, therefore,
who do not rest satisfied with Christ alone, do injury to God in two
ways, for besides detracting from the glory of God, by desiring
something above his perfection, they are also ungrateful, inasmuch as
they seek elsewhere what they already have in Christ. Paul, however,
does not mean that the perfection of Christ is transfused into us, but
that there are in him resources from which we may be filled, that
nothing may be wanting to us.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p39"></span>*Who is the head.* He has introduced
this clause again on account of the angels, meaning that the angels,
also, will be ours, if we have Christ. But of this afterwards. In the
mean time, we must observe this, that we are hemmed in, above and below,
with railings,  <span id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md) that our faith
may not deviate even to the slightest extent from Christ.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p41"></span><span id="v.iii.iii-p41.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iii-p42"></span>**11.** *In whom ye also are
circumcised.* From this it appears, that he has a controversy with the
false apostles, who mixed the law with the gospel, and by that means
made Christ have, as it were, two faces. He specifies, however, one
instance by way of example. He proves that the circumcision of Moses is
not merely unnecessary, but is opposed to Christ, because it destroys
the spiritual *circumcision of Christ*. For circumcision was given to
the Fathers that it might be the figure of a thing that was absent:
those, therefore, who retain that figure after Christ’s advent, deny the
accomplishment of what it prefigures. Let us, therefore, bear in mind
that outward *circumcision* is here compared with spiritual, just as a
figure with the reality. The figure is of a thing that is absent: hence
it puts away the presence of the reality. What Paul contends for is this
— that, inasmuch as what was shadowed forth by a *circumcision made with
hands*, has been completed in Christ, there is now no fruit or advantage
from it.  <span id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md) Hence he says, that
the circumcision which is made in the heart is the *circumcision of
Christ*, and that, on this account, that which is outward is not now
required, because, where the reality exists, that shadowy emblem
vanishes,  <span id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371.md) inasmuch as it has no
place except in the absence of the reality.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p45"></span>*By the putting off of the body.* He
employs the term *body*, by an elegant metaphor, to denote a mass, made
up of all vices. For as we are encompassed by our bodies, so we are
surrounded on all sides by an accumulation of vices. And as the body is
composed of various members, each of which has its own actings and
offices, so from that accumulation of corruption all sins take their
rise as members of the entire body. There is a similar manner of
expression in <span id="v.iii.iii-p45.1"></span>[Ro
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013.md)<span
id="v.iii.iii-p45.1"></span>.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p46"></span>He takes the term *flesh*, as he is
wont, to denote corrupt nature. The *body of the sins of the flesh*,
therefore, is the *old* *man* *with* *his* *deeds*; only, there is a
difference in the manner of expression, for here he expresses more
properly the mass of vices which proceed from corrupt nature. He says
that we obtain this  <span id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372.md) through
Christ, so that unquestionably an entire regeneration is his benefit. It
is he that circumcises the foreskin of our heart, or, in other words,
mortifies all the lusts of the flesh, not with the *hand*, but by his
Spirit. Hence there is in him the reality of the figure.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p48"></span><span id="v.iii.iii-p48.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iii-p49"></span>**12.** *Buried with him, in baptism.*
He explains still more clearly the manner of spiritual circumcision —
because, being *buried with Christ*, we are partakers of his death. He
expressly declares that we obtain this by means of baptism, that it may
be the more clearly apparent that there is no advantage from
circumcision under the reign of Christ. For some one might otherwise
object: “Why do you abolish circumcision on this pretext — that its
accomplishment is in Christ? Was not Abraham, also, circumcised
spiritually, and yet this did not hinder the adding of the sign to the
reality? *Outward* circumcision, therefore, is not superfluous, although
that which is *inward* is conferred by Christ.” Paul anticipates an
objection of this kind, by making mention of baptism. Christ, says he,
accomplishes in us spiritual circumcision, not through means of that
ancient sign, which was in force under Moses, but by baptism. Baptism,
therefore, is a sign of the thing that is presented to us, which while
absent was prefigured by circumcision. The argument is taken from the
economy  <span id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373.md) which God has
appointed; for those who retain circumcision contrive a mode of
dispensation different from that which God has appointed.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p51"></span>When he says that we are *buried with
Christ*, this means more than that we are *crucified* with him; for
burial expresses a continued process of mortification. When he says,
that this is done through means of baptism, as he says also in <span
id="v.iii.iii-p51.1"></span>[Ro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md)<span id="v.iii.iii-p51.1"></span>,
he speaks in his usual manner, ascribing efficacy to the sacrament, that
it may not fruitlessly signify what does not exist.  <span
id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md) By baptism, therefore, we are *buried
with Christ*, because Christ does at the same time accomplish
efficaciously that mortification, which he there represents, that the
reality may be conjoined with the sign.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p53"></span>*In which also ye are risen.* He
magnifies the grace which we obtain in Christ, as being greatly superior
to circumcision. “We are not only,” says he, “ingrafted into Christ’s
death, but we also rise to newness of life:” hence the more injury is
done to Christ by those who endeavor to bring us back to circumcision.
He adds, *by* *faith*, for unquestionably it is by it that we receive
what is presented to us in baptism. But what *faith*? That of his
*efficacy* or *operation*, by which he means, that faith is founded upon
the power of God. As, however, faith does not wander in a confused and
undefined contemplation, as they speak, of divine power, he intimates
what *efficacy* it ought to have in view — that by which *God raised
Christ from the dead*. He takes this, however, for granted, that,
inasmuch as it is impossible that believers should be severed from their
head, the same power of God, which shewed itself in Christ, is diffused
among them all in common.

id="v.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iv-p2"></span>**13**. And you, being dead in your sins

<span id="v.iii.iv-p8"></span> 

<span id="v.iii.iv-p9"></span><span id="v.iii.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iv-p10"></span>**13.** *And you, when ye were dead.* He
admonishes the Colossians to recognize, what he had treated of in a
general way, as applicable to themselves, which is by far the most
effectual way of teaching. Farther, as they were Gentiles when they were
converted to Christ, he takes occasion from this to shew them how absurd
it is to pass over from Christ to the ceremonies of Moses. *Ye* *were*,
says he, *dead in* *Uncircumcision*. This term, however, may be
understood either in its proper signification, or figuratively. If you
understand it in its proper sense, the meaning will be,
“*Uncircumcision* is the badge of alienation from God; for where the
covenant of grace is not, *there* is pollution,  <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md) and, consequently, curse and ruin. But
God has called you to himself from *uncircumcision*, and, therefore,
from death.”  <span id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376.md) In this way he
would not represent *uncircumcision* as the cause of death, but as a
token that they were estranged from God. We know, however, that men
cannot live otherwise than by cleaving to their God, who alone is their
life. Hence it follows, that all wicked persons, however they may seem
to themselves to be in the highest degree lively and flourishing, are,
nevertheless, spiritually dead. In this manner this passage will
correspond with <span id="v.iii.iv-p12.2"></span>[Eph
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#011.md)<span id="v.iii.iv-p12.2"></span>,
where it is said,

<span id="v.iii.iv-p13"></span>Remember that, in time past, when ye were
Gentiles, and called uncircumcision, by that circumcision which is made
with hands in the flesh, ye were at that time without Christ, alienated
from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the promises.

<span id="v.iii.iv-p14"></span>Taking it metaphorically, there would,
indeed, be an allusion to natural uncircumcision, but at the same time
Paul would here be speaking of the obstinacy of the human heart, in
opposition to God, and of a nature that is defiled by corrupt
affections. I rather prefer the former exposition, because it
corresponds better with the context; for Paul declares that
uncircumcision was no hinderance in the way of their becoming partakers
of Christ’s life. Hence it follows, that circumcision derogated from the
grace of God, which they had already obtained.

<span id="v.iii.iv-p15"></span>As to his ascribing death to
uncircumcision, this is not as though it were the cause of it, but as
being the badge of it, as also in that other passage in the Epistle to
the Ephesians, which we have quoted. It is also customary in Scripture
to denote deprivation of the reality by deprivation of the sign, as in
<span id="v.iii.iv-p15.1"></span>[Ge
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022.md)<span id="v.iii.iv-p15.1"></span>,
—

<span id="v.iii.iv-p16"></span>Lest peradventure Adam eat of the fruit
of life, and live.

<span id="v.iii.iv-p17"></span>For the tree did not confer life, but its
being taken away was a sign of death.  <span
id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377.md) Paul has in this place briefly
expressed both. He says that these were *dead in* *sins*: this is the
cause, for our sins alienate us from God. He adds, *in the
uncircumcision of your flesh.* This was outward pollution, an evidence
of spiritual death.

<span id="v.iii.iv-p19"></span>*By forgiving you.* God does not quicken
us by the mere remission of sins, but he makes mention here of this
particularly, because that free reconciliation with God, which
overthrows the righteousness of works, is especially connected with the
point in hand, where he treats of abrogated ceremonies, as he discourses
of more at large in the Epistle to the Galatians. For the false
apostles, by establishing ceremonies, bound them with a halter, from
which Christ has set them free.

<span id="v.iii.iv-p20"></span><span id="v.iii.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iv-p21"></span>**14.** *Having blotted out the
hand-writing which was against us.* He now contends with the false
apostles in close combat. For this was the main point in question, —
whether the observance of ceremonies was necessary under the reign of
Christ? Now Paul contends that ceremonies have been abolished, and to
prove this he compares them to a *hand-writing*, by which God holds us
as it were bound, that we may not be able to deny our guilt. He now
says, that we have been freed from condemnation, in such a manner, that
even the *hand-writing is blotted out*, that no remembrance of it might
remain. For we know that as to debts the obligation is still in force,
so long as the *hand-writing* remains; and that, on the other hand, by
the erasing, or tearing of the handwriting, the debtor is set free.
Hence it follows, that all those who still urge the observance of
ceremonies, detract from the grace of Christ, as though absolution were
not procured for us through him; for they restore to the *hand-writing*
its freshness, so as to hold us still under obligation.

<span id="v.iii.iv-p22"></span>This, therefore, is a truly theological
reason for proving the abrogation of ceremonies, because, if Christ has
fully redeemed us from condemnation, he must have also effaced the
remembrance of the obligation, that consciences may be pacified and
tranquil in the sight of God, for these two things are conjoined. While
interpreters explain this passage in various ways, there is not one of
them that satisfies me. Some think that Paul speaks simply of the moral
law, but there is no ground for this. For Paul is accustomed to give the
name of *ordinances* to that department which consists in ceremonies, as
he does in the Epistle to the Ephesians, (<span
id="v.iii.iv-p22.1"></span>[Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.iii.iv-p22.1"></span>,) and as we shall find he does shortly
afterwards. More especially, the passage in Ephesians shews clearly,
that Paul is here speaking of ceremonies.

<span id="v.iii.iv-p23"></span>Others, therefore, do better, in
restricting it to ceremonies, but they, too, err in this respect, that
they do not add the reason why it is *called hand-writing*, or rather
they assign a reason different from the true one, and they do not in a
proper manner apply this similitude to the context. Now, the reason is,
that all the ceremonies of Moses had in them some acknowledgment of
guilt, which bound those that observed them with a firmer tie, as it
were, in the view of God’s judgment. For example, what else were
washings than an evidence of pollution? Whenever any victim was
sacrificed, did not the people that stood by behold in it a
representation of his death? For when persons substituted in their place
an innocent animal, they confessed that they were themselves deserving
of that death. In fine, in proportion as there were ceremonies belonging
to it, just so many exhibitions were there of human guilt, and
*hand-writings* of obligation.

<span id="v.iii.iv-p24"></span>Should any one object that they were
sacraments of the grace of God, as Baptism and the Eucharist are to us
at this day, the answer is easy. For there are two things to be
considered in the ancient ceremonies — that they were suited to the
time, and that they led men forward to the kingdom of Christ. Whatever
was done at that time shewed in itself nothing but obligation. Grace was
in a manner suspended until the advent of Christ — not that the Fathers
were excluded from it, but they had not a present manifestation of it in
their ceremonies. For they saw nothing in the sacrifices but the blood
of beasts, and in their washings nothing but water. Hence, as to present
view, condemnation remained; nay more, the ceremonies themselves sealed
the condemnation. The Apostle speaks, also, in this manner in the whole
of his Epistle to the Hebrews, because he places Christ in direct
opposition to ceremonies. But how is it now? The Son of God has not only
by his death delivered us from the condemnation of death, but in order
that absolution might be made more certain, he abrogated those
ceremonies, that no remembrance of obligation might remain. This is full
liberty — that Christ has by his blood not only blotted out our sins,
but every *hand-writing* which might declare us to be exposed to the
judgment of God. Erasmus in his version has involved in confusion the
thread of Paul’s discourse, by rendering it thus — “which was contrary
to us by ordinances.” Retain, therefore, the rendering which I have
given, as being the true and genuine one.

<span id="v.iii.iv-p25"></span>*Took it out of the way, fastening it to
his cross.* He shews the manner in which Christ has effaced the
*hand-writing*; for as he fastened to the cross our curse, our sins, and
also the punishment that was due to us, so he has also fastened to it
that bondage of the law, and everything that tends to bind consciences.
For, on his being fastened to the cross, he took all things to himself,
and even bound them upon him, that they might have no more power over
us.

<span id="v.iii.iv-p26"></span><span id="v.iii.iv-p26.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iv-p27"></span>**15.** *Spoiling principalities.* There
is no doubt that he means devils, whom Scripture represents as acting
the part of accusing us before God. Paul, however, says that they are
disarmed, so that they cannot bring forward anything against us, the
attestation of our guilt being itself destroyed. Now, he expressly adds
this with the view of shewing, that the victory of Christ, which he has
procured for himself and us over Satan, is disfigured by the false
apostles, and that we are deprived of the fruit of it when they restore
the ancient ceremonies. For if our liberty is the spoil which Christ has
rescued from the devil, what do others, who would bring us back into
bondage, but restore to Satan the spoils of which he had been stript
bare?

<span id="v.iii.iv-p28"></span>*Triumphing over them in it.* The
expression in the Greek allows, it is true, of our reading — *in*
*himself*; nay more, the greater part of the manuscripts have <span
id="v.iii.iv-p28.1"></span>ἐν αὑτῳ with an aspirate. The connection of
the passage, however, imperatively requires that we read it otherwise;
for what would be meagre as applied to Christ, suits admirably as
applied to the cross. For as he had previously compared the cross to a
signal trophy or show of triumph, in which Christ led about his enemies,
so he now also compares it to a triumphal car, in which he shewed
himself conspicuously to view.  <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378.md)
For although in the cross there is nothing but curse, it was,
nevertheless, swallowed up by the power of God in such a way, that it
 <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md) has put on, as it were, a new
nature. For there is no tribunal so magnificent, no throne so stately,
no show of triumph so distinguished, no chariot so elevated,  <span
id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380.md) as is the gibbet on which Christ has
subdued death and the devil, the prince of death; nay more, has utterly
trodden them under his feet.

<span id="v.iii.v-p14"></span>**16.** *Let no one therefore judge you.*
What he had previously said of circumcision he now extends to the
difference of meats and days. For circumcision was the first
introduction to the observance of the law, other things  <span
id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) followed afterwards. To *judge* means
here, to hold one to be guilty of a crime, or to impose a scruple of
conscience, so that we are no longer free. He says, therefore, that it
is not in the power of men to make us subject to the observance of rites
which Christ has by his death abolished, and exempts us from their yoke,
that we may not allow ourselves to be fettered by the laws which they
have imposed. He tacitly, however, places Christ in contrast with all
mankind, lest any one should extol himself so daringly as to attempt to
take away what he has given him.

<span id="v.iii.v-p16"></span>*In respect of a festival-day*. Some
understand <span id="v.iii.v-p16.1"></span>τὸ μέρος to mean
*participation*. Chrysostom, accordingly, thinks that he used the term
*part*, because they did not observe all festival days, nor did they
even keep holidays strictly, in accordance with the appointment of the
law. This, however, is but a poor interpretation.  <span
id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md) Consider whether it may not be taken
to mean *separation*, for those that make a distinction of days,
separate, as it were, one from another. Such a mode of partition was
suitable for the Jews, that they might celebrate religiously  <span
id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md) the days that were appointed, by
separating them from others. Among Christians, however, such a division
has ceased.

<span id="v.iii.v-p19"></span>But some one will say, “We still keep up
some observance of days.” I answer, that we do not by any means observe
days, as though there were any sacredness in holidays, or as though it
were not lawful to labor upon them, but that respect is paid to
government and order — not to days. And this is what he immediately
adds.

<span id="v.iii.v-p20"></span><span id="v.iii.v-p20.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.v-p21"></span>**17.** *Which are a shadow of things to
come.* The reason why he frees Christians from the observance of them
is, that they were *shadows* at a time when Christ was still, in a
manner, absent. For he contrasts shadows with revelation, and absence
with manifestation. Those, therefore, who still adhere to those
*shadows*, act like one who should judge of a man’s appearance from his
shadow, while in the mean time he had himself personally before his
eyes. For Christ is now manifested to us, and hence we enjoy him as
being present. *The body*, says he, *is of Christ*, that is, IN
*Christ*. For the substance of those things which the ceremonies
anciently prefigured is now presented before our eyes in Christ,
inasmuch as he contains in himself everything that they marked out as
future. Hence, the man that calls back the ceremonies into use, either
buries the manifestation of Christ, or robs Christ of his excellence,
and makes him in a manner void.  <span id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md)
Accordingly, should any one of mortals assume to himself in this matter
the office of judge, let us not submit to him, inasmuch as Christ, the
only competent Judge, sets us free. For when he says, *Let no man judge
you*, he does not address the false apostles, but prohibits the
Colossians from yielding their neck to unreasonable requirements. To
abstain, it is true, from swine’s flesh, is in itself harmless, but the
binding to do it is pernicious, because it makes void the grace of
Christ.

<span id="v.iii.v-p23"></span>Should any one ask, “What view, then, is
to be taken of our sacraments? Do they not also represent Christ to us
as absent?” I answer, that they differ widely from the ancient
ceremonies. For as painters do not in the first draught bring out a
likeness in vivid colors, and (<span
id="v.iii.v-p23.1"></span>εἰκονικῶς) *expressively*, but in the first
instance draw rude and obscure lines with charcoal, so the
representation of Christ under the law was unpolished, and was, as it
were, a first sketch, but in our sacraments it is seen drawn out to the
life. Paul, however, had something farther in view, for he contrasts the
bare aspect of the *shadow* with the solidity of the *body*, and
admonishes them, that it is the part of a madman to take hold of empty
shadows, when it is in his power to handle the solid substance. Farther,
while our sacraments represent Christ as absent as to view and distance
of place, it is in such a manner as to testify that he has been once
manifested, and they now also present him to us to be enjoyed. They are
not, therefore, bare shadows, but on the contrary symbols  <span
id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md) of Christ’s presence, for they contain
that *Yea* *and* *Amen* of all the *promises* *of* *God*, (<span
id="v.iii.v-p24.2"></span>[2Co
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020)<span id="v.iii.v-p24.2"></span>,.md)
which has been once manifested to us in Christ.

<span id="v.iii.v-p25"></span><span id="v.iii.v-p25.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.v-p26"></span>**18.** *Let no one take from you the
palm.*  <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md) He alludes to runners,
or wrestlers, to whom the *palm* was assigned, on condition of their not
giving way in the middle of the course, or after the contest had been
commenced. He admonishes them, therefore, that the false apostles aimed
at nothing else than to snatch away from them the palm, inasmuch as they
draw them aside from the rectitude of their course. Hence it follows
that they must be shunned as the most injurious pests. The passage is
also carefully to be marked as intimating, that all those who draw us
aside from the simplicity of Christ cheat us out of the *prize* *of*
*our* *high* *calling*. (<span id="v.iii.v-p27.5"></span>[Php
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#014)<span id="v.iii.v-p27.5"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iii.v-p28"></span>*Desirous in humility.* Something must be
understood; hence I have, inserted in the text <span
id="v.iii.v-p28.1"></span>*id* *facere*, (*to* *do* *it*.) For he points
out the kind of danger which they required to guard against. All are
desirous to defraud you of the *palm*, who, under the pretext of
humility, recommend to you the *worship of angels*. For their object is,
that you may wander out of the way, leaving the one object of aim. I
read *humility* *and* *worship* *of* *angels* conjointly, for the one
follows the other, just as at this day the Papists make use of the same
pretext when philosophizing as to the worship of saints. For they reason
on the ground of man’s abasement,  <span
id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md) that we must, therefore, seek for
mediators to help us. But for this very reason has Christ humbled
himself — that we might directly betake ourselves to him, however
miserable sinners we may be.

<span id="v.iii.v-p30"></span>I am aware that the *worship of angels* is
by many interpreted otherwise, as meaning such as has been delivered to
men by angels; for the Devil has always endeavored to set off his
impostures under this title. The Pope at this day boasts, that all the
trifles with which he has adulterated the pure worship of God are
revelations. In like manner the Theurgians  <span
id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390.md) of old alleged that all the
superstitions that they contrived were delivered over to them by angels,
as if *from hand to hand.*  <span id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md)
They, accordingly, think that Paul here condemns all fanciful kinds of
worship that are falsely set forth under the authority of angels.  <span
id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392.md) But, in my opinion, he rather condemns
the contrivance as to the worshipping of angels. It is on this account
that he has so carefully applied himself to this in the very
commencement of the Epistle, to bring angels under subjection, lest they
should obscure the splendor of Christ.  <span
id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393.md) In fine, as he had in the first
chapter prepared the way for abolishing the ceremonies, so he had also
for the removal of all other hinderances which draw us away from Christ
alone.  <span id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md) In this class is the
*worship of angels*

<span id="v.iii.v-p36"></span>Superstitious persons have from the
beginning worshipped angels,  <span id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md)
that through means of them there might be free access to God. The
Platonists infected the Christian Church also with this error. For
although Augustine sharply inveighs against them in his tenth book “On
the City of God,” and condemns at great length all their disputations as
to the worship of angels, we see nevertheless what has happened. Should
any one compare the writings of Plato with Popish theology, he will find
that they have drawn wholly from Plato their prattling as to the
*worship of angels*. The sum is this, that we must honor angels, whom
Plato calls demons, <span id="v.iii.v-p37.1"></span>χάριν τὢς εὐφήμου
διαπορείας (*for* *the* *sake* *of* *their* *auspicious*
*intercession*.)  <span id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md) He brings
forward this sentiment in Epinomis, and he confirms it in Cratylus,
 <span id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md) and many other passages. In
what respect do the Papists differ at all from this? “*But*,” it will be
said, “they do not deny that the Son of God is Mediator.” Neither did
those with whom Paul contends; but as they imagined that God must be
approached by the assistance of the angels, and that, consequently, some
worship must be rendered to them, so they placed angels in the seat of
Christ, and honored them with Christ’s office. Let us know, then, that
Paul here condemns all kinds of worship of human contrivance, which are
rendered either to angels or to the dead, as though they were mediators,
rendering assistance after Christ, or along with Christ.  <span
id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md) For just so far do we recede from
Christ, when we transfer the smallest part of what belongs to him to any
others, whether they be angels or men.

<span id="v.iii.v-p41"></span>*Intruding into those things which he hath
not seen.* The verb <span id="v.iii.v-p41.1"></span>ἐμβατεύειν, the
participle of which Paul here makes use of, has various significations.
The rendering which Erasmus, after Jerome, has given to it, *walking*
*proudly*, would not suit ill, were there an example of such a
signification in any author of sufficient note. For we see every day
with how much confidence and pride rash persons pronounce an opinion as
to things unknown. Nay, even in the very subject of which Paul treats,
there is a remarkable illustration. For when the Sorbonnic divines put
forth their trifles  <span id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399.md) respecting
the intercession of saints or angels, they declare,  <span
id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400.md) as though it were from an oracle,
 <span id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401.md) that the dead  <span
id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402.md) know and behold our necessities,
inasmuch as they see all things in the reflex light of God.  <span
id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) And yet, what is less certain? Nay
more, what is more obscure and doubtful? But such, truly, is their
magisterial freedom, that they fearlessly and daringly assert what is
not only not known by them, but cannot be known by men.

<span id="v.iii.v-p47"></span>This meaning, therefore, would be
suitable, if that signification of the term were usual. It is, however,
among the Greeks taken simply as meaning to *walk*. It also sometimes
means to *inquire*. Should any one choose to understand it thus in this
passage, Paul will, in that case, reprove a foolish curiosity in the
investigation of things that are obscure, and such as are even hid from
our view and transcend it.  <span id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md) It
appears to me, however, that I have caught Paul’s meaning, and have
rendered it faithfully in this manner — *intruding into those things
which he hath not seen*. For that is the common signification of the
word <span id="v.iii.v-p48.2"></span>ἐμβατεύειν — to enter upon an
inheritance,  <span id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) or to take
possession, or to set foot anywhere. Accordingly, Budaeus renders this
passage thus: — “*Setting* foot upon, or entering on the possession of
those things which he has not seen.” I have followed his authority, but
have selected a more suitable term. For such persons in reality break
through and intrude into secret things,  <span
id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) of which God would have no discovery
as yet made to us. The passage ought to be carefully observed, for the
purpose of reproving the rashness  <span
id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md) of those who inquire farther than is
allowable.

<span id="v.iii.v-p52"></span>*Puffed up in vain by a fleshly mind.* He
employs the expression *fleshly* *mind* to denote the perspicuity of the
human intellect, however great it may be. For he places it in contrast
with that spiritual wisdom which is revealed to us from heaven in
accordance with that statement —

<span id="v.iii.v-p53"></span>Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
thee.  
(<span id="v.iii.v-p53.2"></span>[Mt
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#017.md)<span
id="v.iii.v-p53.2"></span>.)

<span id="v.iii.v-p54"></span>Whoever; therefore, depends upon his own
reason, inasmuch as the acuteness of the flesh is wholly at work in him,
 <span id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) Paul declares him to be *puffed
up in vain*. And truly all the wisdom that men have from themselves is
mere wind: hence there is nothing solid except in the word of God and
the illumination of the Spirit. And observe, that those are said to be
*puffed up* who insinuate themselves  <span
id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md) under a show of humility. For it
happens, as Augustine elegantly writes to Paulinus, by wonderful means,
as to the soul of man, that it is more puffed up from a false humility
than if it were openly proud.

<span id="v.iii.v-p57"></span><span id="v.iii.v-p57.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.v-p58"></span>**19.** *Not holding the Head*. He
condemns in the use of one word whatever does not bear a relation to
Christ. He also confirms his statement on the ground that all things
flow from him, and depend upon him. Hence, should any one call us
anywhere else than to Christ, though in other respects he were big with
heaven and earth, he is empty and full of wind: let us, therefore,
without concern, bid him farewell. Observe, however, of whom he is
speaking, namely, of those who did not openly reject or deny Christ,
but, not accurately understanding his office and power, by seeking out
other helps and means of salvation, (as they commonly speak,) were not
firmly rooted in him.

<span id="v.iii.v-p59"></span>*From whom the whole body by joints.* He
simply means this, that the Church does not stand otherwise than in the
event of all things being furnished to her by Christ, the *Head*, and,
accordingly, that her entire safety  <span
id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) consists in him. The body, it is true,
has its nerves, its *joints*, *and* *ligaments*, but all these things
derive their vigor solely from the Head, so that the whole binding of
them together is from that source. What, then, must be done? The
constitution of the body will be in a right state, if simply the Head,
which furnishes the several members with everything that they have, is
allowed, without any hinderance, to have the pre-eminence. This Paul
speaks of as the *increase of God*, by which he means that it is not
every increase that is approved by God, but only that which has a
relation to the Head. For we see that the kingdom of the Pope is not
merely tall and large, but swells out into a monstrous size. As,
however, we do not there see what Paul here requires in the Church, what
shall we say, but that it is a humpbacked body, and a confused mass that
will fall to pieces of itself.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p15"></span><span id="v.iii.vi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.vi-p16"></span>**20.** *If ye are dead*. He had
previously said, that the ordinances were fastened to the cross of
Christ. (<span id="v.iii.vi-p16.1"></span>[Col
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p16.1"></span>.) He now employs another figure of speech —
that we are *dead* to them, as he teaches us elsewhere, that we are
*dead* *to* *the* *law*, and the law, on the other hand, to us. (<span
id="v.iii.vi-p16.2"></span>[Ga
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#019.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p16.2"></span>.) The term death means abrogation,  <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) but it is more expressive *and* *more*
*emphatic*, (<span id="v.iii.vi-p17.2"></span>καὶ ἐμφατικώτερον.) He
says, therefore, that the Colossians, have nothing to do with
ordinances. Why? Because they have died with Christ to ordinances; that
is, after they died with Christ by regeneration, they were, through his
kindness, set free from ordinances, that they may not belong to them any
more. Hence he concludes that they are by no means bound by the
ordinances, which the false apostles endeavored to impose upon them.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p18"></span><span id="v.iii.vi-p18.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.vi-p19"></span>**21.** *Eat not, taste not.* Hitherto
this has been rendered — *Handle not*, but as another word immediately
follows, which signifies the same thing, every one sees how cold and
absurd were such a repetition. Farther, the verb <span
id="v.iii.vi-p19.1"></span>ἅπτεσθαι is employed by the Greeks, among its
other significations, in the sense of *eating*,  <span
id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md) in accordance with the rendering that
I have given. Plutarch makes use of it in the life of Caesar, when he
relates that his soldiers, in destitution of all things, *ate* animals
which they had not been accustomed previously to use as food.  <span
id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md) And this arrangement is both in other
respects natural and is also most in accordance with the connection of
the passage; for Paul points out, (<span
id="v.iii.vi-p21.2"></span>μιμητικῶς,) *by* *way* *of* *imitation*, to
what length the waywardness of those who bind consciences by their laws
is wont to proceed. From the very commencement they are unduly rigorous:
hence he sets out with their prohibition — not simply against eating,
but even against slightly partaking. After they have obtained what they
wish they go beyond that command, so that they afterwards declare it to
be unlawful to taste of what they do not wish should be eaten. At length
they make it criminal even to *touch*. In short, when persons have once
taken upon them to tyrannize over men’s souls, there is no end of new
laws being daily added to old ones, and new enactments starting up from
time to time. How bright a mirror there is as to this in Popery! Hence
Paul acts admirably well in admonishing us that human traditions are a
labyrinth, in which consciences are more and more entangled; nay more,
are snares, which from the beginning bind in such a way that in course
of time they strangle in the end.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p22"></span><span id="v.iii.vi-p22.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.vi-p23"></span>**22.** *All which things tend to
corruption.* He sets aside, by a twofold argument, the enactments of
which he has made mention — because they make religion consist in things
outward and frail, which have no connection with the spiritual kingdom
of God; and secondly, because they are from men, not from God. He
combats the first argument, also, in <span
id="v.iii.vi-p23.1"></span>[Ro
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p23.1"></span>, when he says,

<span id="v.iii.vi-p24"></span>The kingdom of God is not in meat and
drink;

<span id="v.iii.vi-p25"></span>likewise in <span
id="v.iii.vi-p25.1"></span>[1Co
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013.md)<span id="v.iii.vi-p25.1"></span>,

<span id="v.iii.vi-p26"></span>Meat for the belly, and the belly for
meats: God will destroy both.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p27"></span>Christ also himself says,

<span id="v.iii.vi-p28"></span>Whatever entereth into the mouth defileth
not the man, because it goes down into the belly, and is cast forth.  
(<span id="v.iii.vi-p28.2"></span>[Mt
15:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p28.2"></span>.)

<span id="v.iii.vi-p29"></span>The sum is this — that the worship of
God, true piety, and the holiness of Christians, do not consist in
drink, and food, and clothing, which are things that are transient and
liable to corruption, and perish by abuse. For abuse is properly
applicable to those things which are corrupted by the use of them. Hence
enactments are of no value in reference to those things which tend to
excite scruples of conscience. But in Popery you would scarcely find any
other holiness, than what consists in little observances of corruptible
things.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p30"></span>A *second* refutation is added  <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) — that they originated with men, and
have not God as their Author; and by this thunderbolt he prostrates and
swallows up all traditions of men. For why? This is Paul’s reasoning:
“Those who bring consciences into bondage do injury to Christ, and make
void his death. For whatever is of human invention does not bind
conscience.”

<span id="v.iii.vi-p32"></span><span id="v.iii.vi-p32.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.vi-p33"></span>**23.** *Which have indeed a show.* Here
we have the anticipation of an objection, in which, while he concedes to
his adversaries what they allege, he at the same time reckons it wholly
worthless. For it is as though he had said, that he does not regard
their having a *show of wisdom*. But *show* is placed in contrast with
*reality*, for it is an *appearance*, as they commonly speak, which
deceives by resemblance.  <span id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md)

<span id="v.iii.vi-p35"></span>Observe, however, of what colors this
*show* consists, according to Paul. He makes mention of three —
self-invented worship,  <span id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md)
humility, and neglect of the body. Superstition among the Greeks
receives the name of <span id="v.iii.vi-p36.2"></span>ἐθελοβρησκεία —
the term which Paul here makes use of. He has, however, an eye to the
etymology of the term, for <span
id="v.iii.vi-p36.3"></span>ἐθελοβρησκεία literally denotes a voluntary
service, which men choose for themselves at their own option, without
authority from God. Human traditions, therefore, are agreeable to us on
this account, that they are in accordance with our understanding, for
any one will find in his own brain the first outlines of them. This is
the *first* pretext.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p37"></span>The *second* is humility, inasmuch as
obedience both to God and men is pretended, so that men do not refuse
even unreasonable burdens.  <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) And
for the most part traditions of this kind are of such a nature as to
appear to be admirable exercises of humility.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p39"></span>They allure, also, by means of a *third*
pretext, inasmuch as they seem to be of the greatest avail for the
mortification of the flesh, while there is no sparing of the body. Paul,
however, bids farewell to those disguises, for

<span id="v.iii.vi-p40"></span>what is in high esteem among men is often
an abomination in the sight of God. (<span
id="v.iii.vi-p40.1"></span>[Lu
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p40.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.iii.vi-p41"></span>Farther, *that* is a treacherous
obedience, and a perverse and sacrilegious humility, which transfers to
men the authority of God; and *neglect of the body* is not of so great
importance, as to be worthy to be set forth to admiration as the service
of God.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p42"></span>Some one, however, will feel astonished,
that Paul does not take more pains in pulling off those masks. I answer,
that he on good grounds rests contented with the simple term *show*. For
the principles which he had taken as opposed to this are
incontrovertible — that the body is in Christ, and that, consequently,
those do nothing but impose upon miserable men, who set before them
shadows. *Secondly*, the spiritual kingdom of Christ is by no means
taken up with frail and corruptible elements. *Thirdly*, by the death of
Christ such observances were put an end to, that we might have no
connection with them; and, *fourthly*, God is our only *Lawgiver*.
(<span id="v.iii.vi-p42.1"></span>[Isa
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p42.1"></span>.) Whatever may be brought forward on the
other side, let it have ever so much splendor, is fleeting *show*.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p43"></span>*Secondly*, he reckoned it enough to
admonish the Colossians, not to be deceived by the putting forth of
empty things. There was no necessity for dwelling at greater length in
reproving them. For it should be a settled point among all the pious,
that the worship of God ought not to be measured according to our views;
and that, consequently, any kind of service is not lawful, simply on the
ground that it is agreeable to us. This, also, ought to be a commonly
received point — that we owe to God such humility as to yield obedience
simply to his commands, so as not to *lean* *to* *our* *own*
*understanding*, etc., (<span id="v.iii.vi-p43.1"></span>[Pr
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#005)<span id="v.iii.vi-p43.1"></span>,.md)
— and that the limit of humility towards men is this — that each one
submit himself to others in love. Now, when they contend that the
wantonness of the flesh is repressed by abstinence from meats, the
answer is easy — that we must not therefore abstain from any particular
food as being unclean, but must eat sparingly of what we do eat of, both
in order that we may soberly and temperately make use of the gifts of
God, and that we may not, impeded by too much food and drink, forget
those things that are God’s. Hence it was enough to say that these
 <span id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) were masks, that the
Colossians, being warned, might be on their guard against false
pretexts.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p45"></span>Thus, at the present day, Papists are not
in want of specious pretexts, by which to set forth their own laws,
however they may be — some of them impious and tyrannical, and others of
them silly and trifling. When, however, we have granted them everything,
there remains, nevertheless, this refutation by Paul, which is of itself
more than sufficient for dispelling all their smoky vapours;  <span
id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) not to say how far removed they  <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) are from so honorable an appearance as
that which Paul describes. The principal holiness of the Papacy,  <span
id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) at the present day, consists in
monkhood, and of what nature that is, I am ashamed and grieved to make
mention, lest I should stir up so abominable an odour. Farther, it is of
importance to consider here, how prone, nay, how forward the mind of man
is to artificial modes of worship. For the Apostle here graphically
describes  <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) the state of the old
system of monkhood, which came into use a hundred years after his death,
as though he had never spoken a word. The zeal of men, therefore, for
superstition is surpassingly mad, which could not be restrained by so
plain a declaration of God from breaking forth, as historical records
testify.

<span id="v.iii.vi-p50"></span>*Not in any honor. Honor* means *care*,
according to the usage of the Hebrew tongue. *Honour* *widows*, (<span
id="v.iii.vi-p50.1"></span>[1Ti
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#003)<span id="v.iii.vi-p50.1"></span>,.md)
that is, take care of them. Now Paul finds fault with this, that they
 <span id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) teach to leave off care for the
body. For as God forbids us to indulge the body unduly, so he commands
that these be given it as much as is necessary for it. Hence Paul, in
<span id="v.iii.vi-p51.2"></span>[Ro
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.iii.vi-p51.2"></span>, does not expressly condemn care for the
flesh, but such as indulges lusts. *Have no care*, says he, *for the
flesh, to the gratifying of its lusts.* What, then, does Paul point out
as faulty in those traditions of which he treats? It is that they gave
no honor to the body for the *satisfying the flesh*, that is, according
to the measure of necessity. For *satisfying* here means a mediocrity,
which restricts itself to the simple use of nature, and thus stands in
opposition to pleasure and all superfluous delicacies; for nature is
content with little. Hence, to refuse what it requires for sustaining
the necessity of life, is not less at variance with piety, than it is
inhuman.
