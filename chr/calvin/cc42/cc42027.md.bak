<span id="vii.iv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="vii.iv.i"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv.i-p1.1"></span>[2
Thessalonians 2:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#001.md)<span
id="vii.iv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p2"></span>**1**. Now we beseech you, brethren, by
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and *by* our gathering together
unto him,

<span id="vii.iv.i-p3"></span>**1**. Rogo autem vos, fratres, per
adventum (*vel, de adventu*) Domini nostri Iesu Christi, et nostri in
ipsum aggregationem,

<span id="vii.iv.i-p4"></span>**2**. That ye be not soon shaken in mind,
or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from
us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p5"></span>**2**. Ne cito dimoveamini a mente, neque
turbemini vel per spiritum, vel per sermonem, vel per epistolam, tanquam
a nobis scriptam, quasi instet dies Christi.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p6"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv.i-p7"></span><span id="vii.iv.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p8"></span>**1** *Now I beseech you, by the coming*.
It may indeed be read, as I have noted on the margin, *concerning the
coming*, but it suits better to view it as an earnest entreaty, taken
from the subject in hand, just as in <span
id="vii.iv.i-p8.1"></span>[1Co
15:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#031.md)<span id="vii.iv.i-p8.1"></span>,
when discoursing as to the hope of a resurrection, he makes use of an
oath by that *glory* which is to be hoped for by believers. And this has
much more efficacy when he adjures believers by the coming of Christ,
not to imagine rashly that his day is at hand, for he at the same time
admonishes us not to think of it but with reverence and sobriety. For it
is customary to adjure by those things which are regarded by us with
reverence. The meaning therefore is, “As you set a high value on the
coming of Christ, when he will gather us to himself, and will truly
perfect that unity of the body which we cherish as yet only in part
through means of faith, so I earnestly beseech you by his coming not to
be too credulous, should any one affirm, on whatever pretext, that his
day is at hand.”

<span id="vii.iv.i-p9"></span>As he had in his former Epistle adverted
to some extent to the resurrection, it is possible that some fickle and
fanatical persons took occasion from this to mark out a near and fixed
day. For it is not likely that this error had taken its rise earlier
among the Thessalonians. For Timothy, on returning thence, had informed
Paul as to their entire condition, and as a prudent and experienced man
had omitted nothing that was of importance. Now if Paul had received
notice of it, he could not have been silent as to a matter of so great
consequence. Thus I am of opinion, that when Paul’s Epistle had been
read, which contained a lively view of the resurrection, some that were
disposed to indulge curiosity philosophized unseasonably as to the time
of it. This, however, was an utterly ruinous fancy,  <span
id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635.md) as were also other things of the same
nature, which were afterwards disseminated, not without artifice on the
part of Satan. For when any day is said to be *near*, if it does not
quickly arrive, mankind being naturally impatient of longer delay, their
spirits begin to languish, and that languishing is followed up shortly
afterwards by despair.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p11"></span>This, therefore, was Satan’s subtlety: as
he could not openly overturn the hope of a resurrection with the view of
secretly undermining it, as if by pits underground,  <span
id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636.md) he promised that the day of it would
be near, and would soon arrive. Afterwards, too, he did not cease to
contrive various things, with the view of effacing, by little and
little, the belief of a resurrection from the minds of men, as he could
not openly eradicate it. It is, indeed, a plausible thing to say that
the day of our redemption is definitely fixed, and on this account it
meets with applause on the part of the multitude, as we see that the
dreams of Lactantius and the Chiliasts of old gave much delight, and yet
they had no other tendency than that of overthrowing the hope of a
resurrection. This was not the design of Lactantius, but Satan, in
accordance with his subtlety, perverted his curiosity, and that of those
like him, so as to leave nothing in religion definite or fixed, and even
at the present day he does not cease to employ the same means. We now
see how necessary Paul’s admonition was, as but for this all religion
would have been overturned among the Thessalonians under a specious
pretext.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p13"></span><span id="vii.iv.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p14"></span>**2** *That ye be not soon shaken in
judgment*. He employs the term *judgment* to denote that settled faith
which rests on sound doctrine. Now, by means of that fancy which he
rejects, they would have been carried away as it were into ecstasy. He
notices, also, three kinds of imposture, as to which they must be on
their guard — *spirit, word*, and *spurious epistle*. By the term
*spirit* he means pretended prophecies, and it appears that this mode of
speaking was common among the pious, so that they applied the term
*spirit* to prophesyings, with the view of putting honor upon them. For,
in order that prophecies may have due authority, we must look to the
Spirit of God rather than to men. But as the devil is wont to *transform
himself into an angel of light*, (<span id="vii.iv.i-p14.1"></span>[2Co
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014.md)<span
id="vii.iv.i-p14.1"></span>,) impostors stole this title, in order that
they might impose upon the simple. But although Paul could have stripped
them of this mask, he, nevertheless, preferred to speak in this manner,
by way of concession, as though he had said, “However they may pretend
to have the spirit of revelation, believe them not.” John, in like
manner, says:

<span id="vii.iv.i-p15"></span>“Try the spirits, whether they are of
God.” (<span id="vii.iv.i-p15.1"></span>[1Jo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)<span id="vii.iv.i-p15.1"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.iv.i-p16"></span>*Speech*, in my opinion, includes every
kind of doctrine, while false teachers insist in the way of reasons or
conjectures, or other pretexts. What he adds as to *epistle*, is an
evidence that this impudence is ancient — that of feigning the names of
others.  <span id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md) So much the more
wonderful is the mercy of God towards us, in that while Paul’s name was
on false grounds made use of in spurious writings, his writings have,
nevertheless, been preserved entire even to our times. This,
unquestionably, could not have taken place accidentally, or as the
effect of mere human industry, if God himself had not by his power
restrained Satan and all his ministers.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p18"></span>*As if the day of Christ were at hand*.
This may seem to be at variance with many passages of Scripture, in
which the Spirit declares that that day is at hand. But the solution is
easy, for it is *at hand* with regard to God, with whom *one day is as a
thousand years*. (<span id="vii.iv.i-p18.1"></span>[2Pe
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#008)<span id="vii.iv.i-p18.1"></span>..md)
In the mean time, the Lord would have us be constantly waiting for him
in such a way as not to limit him to a certain time.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p19"></span>Watch, says he, for ye know neither the
day nor the hour.  
(<span id="vii.iv.i-p19.2"></span>[Mt
24:36](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036.md)<span
id="vii.iv.i-p19.2"></span>.)

<span id="vii.iv.i-p20"></span>On the other hand, those false prophets
whom Paul exposes, while they ought to have kept men’s minds in
suspense, bid them feel assured of his speedy advent, that they might
not be wearied out with the irksomeness of delay.

<span id="vii.iv.ii"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>[2
Thessalonians 2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md)<span
id="vii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p2"></span>**3**. Let no man deceive you by any
means: for *that day shall not come*, except there come a falling away
first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p3"></span>**3**. Ne quis vos decipiat ullo modo;
quia nisi prius venerit discessio, et nisi revelatus fuerit sceleratus
ille filius perditus,

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p4"></span>**4**. Who opposeth and exhalteth himself
above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he, as God,
sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p5"></span>**4**. Adverserius, et qui se extollit
adversus omne, quod dicitur Deus, aut numen: ita ut ipse in templo Dei
tanquam Deus sedeat, ostendens se ipsum quasi sit Deus.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p6"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p7"></span><span id="vii.iv.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p8"></span>**3** *Let no man deceive you*. That they
may not groundlessly promise themselves the arrival in so short a time
of the joyful day of redemption, he presents to them a melancholy
prediction as to the future scattering of the Church. This discourse
entirely corresponds with that which Christ held in the presence of his
disciples, when they had asked him respecting the end of the world. For
he exhorts them to prepare themselves for enduring hard conflicts,
 <span id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md) (<span
id="vii.iv.ii-p9.2"></span>[Mt
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006.md)<span
id="vii.iv.ii-p9.2"></span>,) and after he has discoursed of the most
grievous and previously unheard of calamities, by which the earth was to
be reduced almost to a desert, he adds, that the *end is not yet*, but
that *these things are the beginnings of sorrows*. In the same way, Paul
declares that believers must exercise warfare for a long period, before
gaining a triumph.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p10"></span>We have here, however, a remarkable
passage, and one that is in the highest degree worthy of observation.
This was a grievous and dangerous temptation, which might shake even the
most confirmed, and make them lose their footing — to see the Church,
which had by means of such labors been raised up gradually and with
difficulty to some considerable standing, fall down suddenly, as if torn
down by a tempest. Paul, accordingly, fortifies beforehand the minds,
not merely of the Thessalonians, but of all the pious, that when the
Church should come to be in a scattered condition, they might not be
alarmed, as though it were a thing that was new and unlooked for.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p11"></span>As, however, interpreters have twisted
this passage in various ways, we must first of all endeavor to ascertain
Paul’s true meaning. He says that the day of Christ will not come, until
the world has fallen into apostasy, and the reign of Antichrist has
obtained a footing in the Church; for as to the exposition that some
have given of this passage, as referring to the downfall of the Roman
empire, it is too silly to require a lengthened refutation. I am also
surprised, that so many writers, in other respects learned and acute,
have fallen into a blunder in a matter that is so easy, were it not that
when one has committed a mistake, others follow in troops without
consideration. Paul, therefore, employs the term *apostasy* to mean — a
treacherous departure from God, and that not on the part of one or a few
individuals, but such as would spread itself far and wide among a large
multitude of persons. For when *apostasy* is made mention of without
anything being added, it cannot be restricted to a few. Now, none can be
termed *apostates*, but such as have previously made a profession of
Christ and the gospel. Paul, therefore, predicts a certain general
revolt of the visible Church. “The Church must be reduced to an
unsightly and dreadful state of ruin, before its full restoration be
effected.”

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p12"></span>From this we may readily gather, how
useful this prediction of Paul is, for it might have seemed as though
that could not be a building of God, that was suddenly overthrown, and
lay so long in ruins, had not Paul long before intimated that it would
be so. Nay more, many in the present day, when they consider with
themselves the long-continued dispersion of the Church, begin to waver,
as if this had not been regulated by the purpose of God. The Romanists,
also, with the view of justifying the tyranny of their idol, make use of
this pretext — that it was not possible that Christ would forsake his
spouse. The weak, however, have something here on which to rest, when
they learn that the unseemly state of matters which they behold in the
Church was long since foretold; while, on the other hand, the impudence
of the Romanists is openly exposed, inasmuch as Paul declares that a
revolt will come, when the world has been brought under Christ’s
authority. Now, we shall see presently, why it is that the Lord has
permitted the Church, or at least what appeared to be such, to fall off
in so shameful a manner.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p13"></span>*Has been revealed*. It was no better
than an old wife’s fable that was contrived respecting Nero, that he was
carried up from the world, destined to return again to harass the Church
 <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) by his tyranny; and yet the
minds of the ancients were so bewitched, that they imagined that Nero
would be Antichrist.  <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) Paul,
however, does not speak of one individual, but of a kingdom, that was to
be taken possession of by Satan, that he might set up a seat of
abomination in the midst of God’s temple — which we see accomplished in
Popery. The revolt, it is true, has spread more widely, for Mahomet, as
he was an apostate, turned away the Turks, his followers, from Christ.
All heretics have broken the unity of the Church by their sects, and
thus there have been a corresponding number of revolts from Christ.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p16"></span>Paul, however, when he has given warning
that there would be such a scattering, that the greater part would
revolt from Christ, adds something more serious — that there would be
such a confusion, that the vicar of Satan would hold supreme power in
the Church, and would preside there in the place of God. Now he
describes that reign of abomination under the name of a single person,
because it is only one reign, though one succeeds another. My readers
now understand, that all the sects by which the Church has been lessened
from the beginning, have been so many streams of revolt which began to
draw away the water from the right course, but that the sect of Mahomet
was like a violent bursting forth of water, that took away about the
half of the Church by its violence. It remained, also, that Antichrist
should infect the remaining part with his poison. Thus, we see with our
own eyes, that this memorable prediction of Paul has been confirmed by
the event.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p17"></span>In the exposition which I bring forward,
there is nothing forced. Believers in that age dreamed that they would
be transported to heaven, after having endured troubles during a short
period. Paul, however, on the other hand, foretells that, after they
have had foreign enemies for some time molesting them, they will have
more evils to endure from enemies at home, inasmuch as many of those
that have made a profession of attachment to Christ would be hurried
away into base treachery, and inasmuch as the temple of God itself would
be polluted by sacrilegious tyranny, so that Christ’s greatest enemy
would exercise dominion there. The term *revelation* is taken here to
denote manifest possession of tyranny, as if Paul had said that the day
of Christ would not come until this tyrant had openly manifested
himself, and had, as it were, designedly overturned the whole order of
the Church.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p18"></span><span id="vii.iv.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p19"></span>**4** *An adversary, and that exalteth
himself*. The two epithets — *man of sin*, and *son of perdition* —
intimate, in the first place, how dreadful the confusion would be, that
the unseemliness of it might not discourage weak minds; and farther,
they tend to stir up the pious to a feeling of detestation, lest they
should degenerate along with others. Paul, however, now draws, as if in
a picture, a striking likeness of Antichrist; for it may be easily
gathered from these words what is the nature of his kingdom, and in what
things it consists. For, when he calls him an *adversary*, when he says
that he will claim for himself those things which belong to God, so that
he is worshipped in the temple as God, he places his kingdom in direct
opposition to the kingdom of Christ. Hence, as the kingdom of Christ is
spiritual, so this tyranny must be upon souls, that it may rival the
kingdom of Christ. We shall also find him afterwards assigning to him
the power of deceiving, by means of wicked doctrines and pretended
miracles. If, accordingly, you would know Antichrist, you must view him
as diametrically opposed to Christ.  <span
id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md)

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p21"></span>Where I have rendered — *everything that
is called God*, the reading more generally received among the Greeks is,
*every one that is called*. It may, however, be conjectured, both from
the old translation  <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) and from
some Greek commentaries, that Paul’s words have been corrupted. The
mistake, too, of a single letter was readily fallen into, especially
when the shape of the letter was much similar; for, where there was
written <span id="vii.iv.ii-p22.2"></span>πᾶν τὸ, (*everything*,) some
transcriber, or too daring reader, turned it into <span
id="vii.iv.ii-p22.3"></span>πάντα, (*every one*.) This difference,
however, is not of so much importance as to the sense, for Paul
undoubtedly means that Antichrist would take to himself those things
that belonged to God alone, so that he would *exalt himself* above every
divine claim, that all religion and all worship of God might lie under
his feet. This expression then, *everything that is reckoned to be God*,
is equivalent to *everything that is reckoned as Divinity*, and <span
id="vii.iv.ii-p22.4"></span>σέβασμα, that is, in which the veneration
due to God consists.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p23"></span>Here, however, the subject treated of is
not the name of God himself, but his majesty and worship, and, in
general, everything that he claims for himself. “True religion is that
by which the true God alone is worshipped; *that*, the *son of
perdition* will transfer to himself.” Now, every one that has learned
from Scripture what are the things that more especially belong to God,
and will, on the other hand, observe what the Pope claims for himself —
though he were but a boy of ten years of age — will have no great
difficulty in recognizing Antichrist. Scripture declares that God is the
*alone Lawgiver* (<span id="vii.iv.ii-p23.1"></span>[Jas
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012.md)<span
id="vii.iv.ii-p23.1"></span>) *who is able to save and to destroy;* the
alone King, whose office it is to govern souls by his word. It
represents him as the author of all sacred rites;  <span
id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) it teaches that righteousness and
salvation are to be sought from Christ alone; and it assigns, at the
same time, the manner and means. There is not one of these things that
the Pope does not affirm to be under his authority. He boasts that it is
his to bind consciences with such laws as seem good to him, and subject
them to everlasting punishment. As to sacraments, he either institutes
new ones, according to his own inclination,  <span
id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) or he corrupts and deforms those which
had been instituted by Christ — nay, sets them aside altogether, that he
may substitute in their place the sacrileges  <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) which he has invented. He contrives
means of attaining salvation that are altogether at variance with the
doctrine of the Gospel; and, in fine, he does not hesitate to change the
whole of religion at his own pleasure. What is it, I pray you, for one
to lift up himself above everything that is reckoned God, if the Pope
does not do so? When he thus robs God of his honor, he leaves him
nothing remaining but an empty title of Deity,  <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) while he transfers to himself the
whole of his power. And this is what Paul adds shortly afterwards, that
*the son of perdition would shew himself as God*. For, as has been said,
he does not insist upon the simple term *God*, but intimates, that the
pride  <span id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md) of Antichrist would be
such, that, raising himself above the number and rank of servants, and
mounting the judgment-seat of God,  <span
id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md) would reign, not with a human, but
with a divine authority. For we know that whatever is raised up into the
place of God is an idol, though it should not bear the name of God.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p30"></span>*In the temple of God*. By this one term
there is a sufficient refutation of the error, nay more, the stupidity
of those who reckon the Pope to be Vicar of Christ, on the ground that
he has his seat in the Church, in whatever manner he may conduct
himself; for Paul places Antichrist nowhere else than in the very
sanctuary of God. For this is not a foreign, but a domestic enemy, who
opposes Christ under the very name of Christ. But it is asked, how the
Church is represented as the den of so many superstitions, while it was
destined to be the *pillar of the truth?* (<span
id="vii.iv.ii-p30.1"></span>[1Ti
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md)<span
id="vii.iv.ii-p30.1"></span>.) I answer, that it is thus represented,
not on the ground of its retaining all the qualities of the Church, but
because it has something of it remaining. I accordingly acknowledge,
that that is the *temple of God* in which the Pope bears rule, but at
the same time profaned by innumerable sacrileges.

<span id="vii.iv.iii"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>[2
Thessalonians 2:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#005.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p2"></span>**5**. Remember ye not, that, when I was
yet with you, I told you these things?

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p3"></span>**5**. Annon memoria tenetis, quod, quum
adhuc essem apud vos, haec vobis dicebam?

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p4"></span>**6**. And now ye know what withholdeth
that he might be revealed in his time.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p5"></span>**6**. Et nunc quid detineat, scitis,
donec ille reveletur suo tempore.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p6"></span>**7**. For the mystery of iniquity doth
already work: only he who now letteth *will let*, until he be taken out
of the way.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p7"></span>**7**. Mysterium enim iam operatur
iniquitatis, solum tenens modo donec e medio tollatur.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p8"></span>**8**. And then shall that Wicked be
revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and
shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p9"></span>**8**. Et tunc revelabitur iniquus ille,
quem Dominus destruet spiritu oris sui, et abolebit illustratione
adventus sui.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p10"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p11"></span><span id="vii.iv.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p12"></span>**5** *Do ye not remember?* This added
no small weight to the doctrine, that they had previously heard it from
the mouth of Paul, that they might not think that it had been contrived
by him at the instant. And as he had given them early warning as to the
reign of Antichrist, and the devastation that was coming upon the
Church, when no question had as yet been raised as to such things, he
saw beyond all doubt that the doctrine was specially useful to be known.
And, unquestionably, it is really so. Those whom he addressed were
destined to see many things that would trouble them; and when posterity
would see a large proportion of those who had made profession of the
faith of Christ revolt from piety, maddened, as it were, by a gad-fly,
or rather by a fury,  <span id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md) what could
they do but waver? This, however, was as a *brazen*  <span
id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) *wall*  <span
id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) — that matters were so appointed by
God, because the ingratitude of men  <span
id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) was worthy of such vengeance. Here we
may see how forgetful men are in matters affecting their everlasting
salvation. We must also observe Paul’s mildness; for while he might have
been vehemently incensed,  <span id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) he
does but mildly reprove them; for it is a fatherly way of reproving them
to say to them, that they had allowed forgetfulness of a matter so
important and so useful to steal in upon their minds.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p18"></span><span id="vii.iv.iii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p19"></span>**6***. And now what withholdeth* <span
id="vii.iv.iii-p19.1"></span>Τὸ κατέχον means here properly an
impediment or occasion of delay. Chrysostom, who thinks that this can
only be understood as referring to the Spirit, or to the Roman Empire,
prefers to lean to the latter opinion. He assigns a plausible reason —
because Paul would not have spoken of the Spirit in enigmatical terms,
 <span id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md) but in speaking of the Roman
Empire wished to avoid exciting unpleasant feeling. He states also the
reason why the state of the Roman Empire retards the revelation of
Antichrist — that, as the monarchy of Babylon was overthrown by the
Persians and Medes, and the Macedonians, having conquered the Persians,
again took possession of the monarchy, and the Macedonians were at last
subdued by the Romans, so Antichrist seized hold for himself of the
vacant supremacy of the Roman Empire. There is not one of these things
that was not afterwards confirmed by actual occurrence. Chrysostom,
therefore, speaks truly in so far as concerns history. I am of opinion,
however, that Paul’s intention was different from this — that the
doctrine of the gospel would require to be spread hither and thither,
until nearly the whole world were convicted of obstinacy and deliberate
malice. For there can be no doubt that the Thessalonians had heard from
Paul’s mouth as to this impediment, of whatever sort it was, for he
recalls to their remembrance what he had previously taught in their
presence.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p21"></span>Let my readers now consider which of
the two is the more probable — either that Paul declared that the light
of the gospel must be diffused through all parts of the earth before God
would thus give loose reins to Satan, or that the power of the Roman
Empire stood in the way of the rise of Antichrist, inasmuch as he could
only break through into a vacant possession. I seem at least to hear
Paul discoursing as to the universal call of the Gentiles — that the
grace of God must be offered to all — that Christ must enlighten the
whole world by his gospel, in order that the impiety of men might be the
more fully attested and demonstrated. This, therefore, was the delay,
until the career of the gospel should be completed, because a gracious
invitation to salvation was first in order.  <span
id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) Hence he adds, *in his time*, because
vengeance was ripe after grace had been rejected.  <span
id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md)

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p24"></span><span id="vii.iv.iii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p25"></span>**7***. The mystery of iniquity*. This
is opposed to *revelation;* for as Satan had not yet gathered so much
strength, as that Antichrist could openly oppress the Church, he says
that he is carrying on secretly and clandestinely  <span
id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) what he would do openly in his own
time. He was therefore at that time secretly laying the foundations on
which he would afterwards rear the edifice, as actually took place. And
this tends to confirm more fully what I have already stated, that it is
not one individual that is represented under the term Antichrist, but
one kingdom, which extends itself through many ages. In the same sense,
John says that Antichrist will come, but that there were already many in
his time. (<span id="vii.iv.iii-p26.2"></span>[1Jo
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iii-p26.2"></span>.) For he admonishes those who were then
living to be on their guard against that deadly pestilence, which was at
that time shooting up in various forms. For sects were rising up which
were the seeds, as it were, of that unhappy weed which has well-nigh
choked and destroyed God’s entire tillage.  <span
id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) But although Paul conveys the idea of
a secret manner of working, yet he has made use of the term *mystery*
rather than any other, alluding to the mystery of salvation, of which he
speaks elsewhere, (<span id="vii.iv.iii-p27.2"></span>[Col
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iii-p27.2"></span>,) for he carefully insists on the struggle
of repugnancy between the Son of God and this *son of perdition*

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p28"></span>*Only now withholding*. While he makes
both statements in reference to one person — that he will hold supremacy
for a time, and that he will shortly be taken out of the way, I have no
doubt that he refers to Antichrist; and the participle *withholding*
must be explained in the future tense.  <span
id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) For he has, in my opinion, added this
for the consolation of believers — that the reign of Antichrist will be
temporary, the limits of it having been assigned to it by God; for
believers might object — “Of what avail is it that the gospel is
preached, if Satan is now hatching a tyranny that he is to exercise for
ever?” He accordingly exhorts to patience, because God afflicts his
Church only for a time, that he may one day afford it deliverance; and,
on the other hand, the perpetuity of Christ’s reign must be considered,
in order that believers may repose in it.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p30"></span><span id="vii.iv.iii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p31"></span>**8** *And then will be revealed* —
that is, when that *impediment* (<span id="vii.iv.iii-p31.1"></span>τὸ
κατέχον) shall be removed; for he does not point out the time of
revelation as being when he, who now holds the supremacy, *will be taken
out of the way*, but he has an eye to what he had said before. For he
had said that there was some hindrance in the way of Antichrist’s
entering upon an open possession of the kingdom. He afterwards added,
that he was already hatching a secret work of impiety. In the *third*
place, he has interspersed consolation, on the ground that this tyranny
would come to an end.  <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) He now
again repeats, that he  <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) who was
as yet hidden, would be *revealed in his time;* and the repetition is
with this view — that believers, being furnished with spiritual armor,
may, nevertheless, fight vigorously under Christ,  <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) and not allow themselves to be
overwhelmed, although the deluge of impiety should thus overspread.
 <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md)

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p36"></span>*Whom the Lord*. He had foretold the
destruction of Antichrist’s reign; he now points out the manner of his
destruction — that he will be reduced to nothing by the *word of the
Lord*. It is uncertain, however, whether he speaks of the last
appearance of Christ, when he will be manifested from heaven as the
Judge. The words, indeed, seem to have this meaning, but Paul does not
mean that Christ would accomplish this  <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) in one moment. Hence we must
understand it in this sense — that Antichrist would be wholly and in
every respect destroyed,  <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) when
that final day of the restoration of all things shall arrive. Paul,
however, intimates that Christ will in the mean time, by the rays which
he will emit previously to his advent, put to flight the darkness in
which Antichrist will reign, just as the sun, before he is seen by us,
chases away the darkness of the night by the pouring forth of his rays.
 <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md)

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p40"></span>This victory of the word, therefore,
will shew itself in this world, for the *spirit of his mouth* simply
means the word, as it also does in <span
id="vii.iv.iii-p40.1"></span>[Isa
11:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iii-p40.1"></span>, to which passage Paul seems to allude.
For the Prophet there takes in the same sense the *scepter of his
mouth*, and the *breath of his lips*, and he also furnishes Christ with
these very arms, that he may rout his enemies. This is a signal
commendation of true and sound doctrine — that it is represented as
sufficient for putting an end to all impiety, and as destined to be
invariably victorious, in opposition to all the machinations of Satan;
as also when, a little afterwards, the proclamation of it is spoken of
as *Christ’s coming* to us.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p41"></span>When Paul adds, the *brightness of his
coming*, he intimates that the light of Christ’s presence will be such
as will swallow up the darkness of Antichrist. In the mean time, he
indirectly intimates, that Antichrist will be permitted to reign for a
time, when Christ has, in a manner, withdrawn, as usually happens,
whenever on his presenting himself we turn our back upon him. And,
undoubtedly, that is a sad departure  <span
id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) of Christ, when he has taken away his
light from men, which has been improperly and unworthily received,
 <span id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md) in accordance with what
follows. In the mean time Paul teaches, that by his presence alone all
the elect of God will be abundantly safe, in opposition to all the
subtleties of Satan.

<span id="vii.iv.iv"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>[2
Thessalonians 2:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#009.md)<span

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p2"></span>**9** *Even him*, whose coming is after
the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p3"></span>**9**. Cuius adventus est secundum

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p4"></span>**10**. And with all deceivableness of
unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love
of the truth, that they might be saved.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p5"></span>**10**. Et in omni deceptione

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p6"></span>**11**. And for this cause God shall send
them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p7"></span>**11**. Propterea mittet illis Deus

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p8"></span>**12**. That they all might be damned who
believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p9"></span>**12**. Ut iudicentur omnes qui non
crediderunt veritati, sed oblectati sunt iniustitia.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p10"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p11"></span><span id="vii.iv.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p12"></span>**9** *Whose coming* He confirms what he
has said by an argument from contraries. For as Antichrist cannot stand
otherwise than through the impostures of Satan, he must necessarily
vanish as soon as Christ shines forth. In fine, as it is only in
darkness that he reigns, the dawn of the day puts to flight and
extinguishes the thick darkness of his reign. We are now in possession
of Paul’s design, for he meant to say, that Christ would have no
difficulty in destroying the tyranny of Antichrist, which was supported
by no resources but those of Satan. In the mean time, however, he points
out the marks by which that *wicked one* may be distinguished. For after
having spoken of the *working* or *efficacy* of Satan, he marks it out
particularly when he says, *in signs and lying wonders, and in all
deceivableness*. And assuredly, in order that this may be opposed to the
kingdom of Christ, it must consist partly in false doctrine and errors,
and partly in pretended miracles. For the kingdom of Christ consists of
the doctrine of truth, and the power of the Spirit. Satan, accordingly,
with the view of opposing Christ in the person of his Vicar, puts on
Christ’s mask,  <span id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) while he,
nevertheless, at the same time chooses armor, with which he may directly
oppose Christ. Christ, by the doctrine of his gospel, enlightens our
minds in eternal life; Antichrist, trained up under Satan’s tuition, by
wicked doctrine, involves the wicked in ruin;  <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) Christ puts forth the power of his
Spirit for salvation, and seals his gospel by miracles; the adversary,
 <span id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) by the efficacy of Satan,
alienates us from the Holy Spirit, and by his enchantments confirms
miserable men  <span id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md) in error.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p17"></span>He gives the name of *miracles of
falsehood*, not merely to such as are falsely and deceptively contrived
by cunning men with a view to impose upon the simple — a kind of
deception with which all Papacy abounds, for they are a part of his
power which he has previously touched upon; but takes falsehood as
consisting in this, that Satan draws to a contrary end works which
otherwise are truly works of God, and abuses miracles so as to obscure
God’s glory.  <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) In the mean time,
however, there can be no doubt, that he deceives by means of
enchantments—an example of which we have in Pharaoh’s magicians. (<span
id="vii.iv.iv-p18.1"></span>[Ex
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iv-p18.1"></span>.)

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p19"></span><span id="vii.iv.iv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p20"></span>**10** *In those that perish*. He limits
the power of Satan, as not being able to injure the elect of God, just
as Christ, also, exempts them from this danger. (<span
id="vii.iv.iv-p20.1"></span>[Mt
24:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iv-p20.1"></span>.) From this it appears, that Antichrist has
not so great power otherwise than by his permission. Now, this
consolation was necessary. For all the pious, but for this, would of
necessity be overpowered with fear, if they saw a yawning gulf pervading
the whole path, along which they must pass. Hence Paul, however he may
wish them to be in a state of anxiety, that they may be on their guard,
lest by excessive carelessness they should fall back, nay, even throw
themselves into ruin, does, nevertheless, bid them cherish good hope,
inasmuch as Satan’s power is bridled, that he may not be able to involve
any but the wicked in ruin.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p21"></span>*Because they received not the love*.
Lest the wicked should complain that they perish innocently,  <span
id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md) and that they have been appointed to
death rather from cruelty on the part of God, than from any fault on
their part, Paul shews on what good grounds it is that so severe
vengeance from God is to come upon them — because they have not received
in the temper of mind with which they ought the truth which was
presented to them, nay more, of their own accord refused salvation. And
from this appears more clearly what I have already stated — that the
gospel required to be preached to the world before God would give Satan
so much permission, for he would never have allowed his temple to be so
basely profaned,  <span id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) had he not
been provoked by extreme ingratitude on the part of men. In short, Paul
declares that Antichrist will be the minister of God’s righteous
vengeance against those who, being called to salvation, have rejected
the gospel, and have preferred to apply their mind to impiety and
errors. Hence there is no reason why Papists should now object, that it
is at variance with the clemency of Christ to cast off his Church in
this manner. For though the domination of Antichrist has been cruel,
none have perished but those who were deserving of it, nay more, did of
their own accord *choose death*. (<span id="vii.iv.iv-p23.2"></span>[Pr
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iv-p23.2"></span>.) And unquestionably, while the voice of
the Son of God has sounded forth everywhere, it finds the ears of men
deaf, nay obstinate,  <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) and while
a profession of Christianity is common, there are, nevertheless, few
that have truly and heartily given themselves to Christ. Hence it is not
to be wondered, if similar vengeance quickly follows such a criminal
 <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) contempt.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p26"></span>It is asked whether the punishment of
blindness does not fall on any but those who have on set purpose
rebelled against the gospel. I answer, that this special judgment by
which God has avenged open contumacy,  <span
id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) does not stand in the way of his
striking down with stupidity,  <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md)
as often as seems good to him, those that have never heard a single word
respecting Christ, for Paul does not discourse in a general way as to
the reasons why God has from the beginning permitted Satan to go at
large with his falsehoods, but as to what a horrible vengeance impends
over gross despisers of new and previously unwonted grace.  <span
id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md)

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p30"></span>He uses the expression — *receiving the
love of the truth*, to mean — applying the mind to the love of it. Hence
we learn that faith is always conjoined with a sweet and voluntary
reverence for God, because we do not properly believe the word of God,
unless it is lovely and pleasant to us.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p31"></span><span id="vii.iv.iv-p31.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p32"></span>**11** *The working of delusion*. He
means that errors will not merely have a place, but the wicked will be
blinded, so that they will rush forward to ruin without consideration.
For as God enlightens us inwardly by his Spirit, that his doctrine may
be efficacious in us, and opens our eyes and hearts, that it may make
its way thither, so by a righteous judgment he delivers over to a
*reprobate mind* (<span id="vii.iv.iv-p32.1"></span>[Ro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iv-p32.1"></span>) those whom he has appointed to
destruction, that with closed eyes and a senseless mind, they may, as if
bewitched, deliver themselves over to Satan and his ministers to be
deceived. And assuredly we have a notable specimen of this in the
Papacy. No words can express how monstrous a sink of errors  <span
id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) there is *there*, how gross and
shameful an absurdity of superstitions there is, and what delusions at
variance with common sense. None that have even a moderate taste of
sound doctrine, can think of such monstrous things without the greatest
horror. How, then, could the whole world be lost in astonishment at
them, were it not that men have been struck with blindness by the Lord,
and converted, as it were, into stumps?

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p34"></span><span id="vii.iv.iv-p34.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p35"></span>**12** *That all may be condemned*. That
is, that they may receive the punishment due to their impiety. Thus,
those that perish have no just ground to expostulate with God, inasmuch
as they have obtained what they sought. For we must keep in view what is
stated in <span id="vii.iv.iv-p35.1"></span>[De
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#003.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iv-p35.1"></span>, that the hearts of men are subjected to
trial, when false doctrines come abroad, inasmuch as they have no power
except among those who do not love God with a sincere heart. Let those,
then, who *take pleasure in unrighteousness*, reap the fruit of it. When
he says *all*, he means that contempt of God finds no excuse in the
great crowd and multitude of those who refuse to obey the gospel, for
God is the Judge of the whole world, so that he will inflict punishment
upon a hundred thousand, no less than upon one individual.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p36"></span>The participle <span
id="vii.iv.iv-p36.1"></span>εὐδοκήσαντες (*taking pleasure*) means (so
to speak) a voluntary inclination to evil, for in this way every excuse
is cut off from the ungrateful, when they take so much *pleasure in
unrighteousness*, as to prefer it to the righteousness of God. For by
what violence will they say that they have been impelled to alienate
themselves by a mad revolt  <span id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) from
God, towards whom they were led by the guidance of nature? It is at
least manifest that they willingly and knowingly lent an ear to
falsehoods.

<span id="vii.iv.v"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.v-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv.v-p1.1"></span>[2
Thessalonians 2:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#013.md)<span
id="vii.iv.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.v-p2"></span>**13**. But we are bound to give thanks
alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath
from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the
Spirit and belief of the truth:

<span id="vii.iv.v-p3"></span>**13**. Nos autem debemus gratias agere
Deo semper de vobis, fratres dilecti a Domino, quia elegit vos Deus ab
initio in salutem, in sanctificatione Spiritus, et fide veritatis:

<span id="vii.iv.v-p4"></span>**14**. Whereunto he called you by our
gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="vii.iv.v-p5"></span>**14**. Quo vocavit vos per evangelium
nostrum, in possessionem gloriae (*vel, gloriosam*) Domini nostri Iesu
Christi.

<span id="vii.iv.v-p6"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv.v-p7"></span><span id="vii.iv.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.v-p8"></span>**13** *But we are bound to give thanks*.
He now separates more openly the Thessalonians from the reprobate, that
their faith may not waver from fear of the revolt that was to take
place. At the same time, he had it in view to consult, not *their*
welfare only, but also that of posterity.  <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) And he does not merely confirm them
that they may not fall over the same precipice with the world, but by
this comparison he extols the more the grace of God towards them, in
that, while they see almost the whole world hurried forward to death at
the same time, as if by a violent tempest, they are, by the hand of God,
maintained in a quiet and secure condition of life.  <span
id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) Thus we must contemplate the Judgments
of God upon the reprobate in such a way that they may be, as it were,
mirrors to us for considering his mercy towards us. For we must draw
this conclusion, that it is owing solely to the singular grace of God
that we do not miserably perish with them.

<span id="vii.iv.v-p11"></span>He calls them *beloved of the Lord*, for
this reason, that they may the better consider that the sole reason why
they are exempted from the almost universal overthrow of the world, was
because God exercised towards them unmerited love. Thus Moses admonished
the Jews —

<span id="vii.iv.v-p12"></span>“God did not elevate you so magnificently
because ye were more powerful than others, or were numerous, but because
he loved your fathers.” (<span id="vii.iv.v-p12.1"></span>[De
7:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#007.md)<span
id="vii.iv.v-p12.1"></span>.)

<span id="vii.iv.v-p13"></span>For, when we hear the term *love*, that
statement of John must immediately occur to our mind — *Not that we
first loved him*. (<span id="vii.iv.v-p13.1"></span>[1Jo
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019.md)<span
id="vii.iv.v-p13.1"></span>.) In short, Paul here does two things; for
he confirms faith, lest the pious should give way from being overcome
with fear, and he exhorts them to gratitude, that they may value so much
the higher the mercy of God towards them.

<span id="vii.iv.v-p14"></span>*Hath chosen you*. He states the reason
why all are not involved and swallowed up in the same ruin — because
Satan has no power over any that God has chosen, so as to prevent them
from being saved, though heaven and earth were to be confounded. This
passage is read in various ways.

<span id="vii.iv.v-p15"></span>The old interpreter has rendered it
*first-fruits*,  <span id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) as being in the
Greek <span id="vii.iv.v-p16.2"></span>ἀπαρχήν; but as almost all the
Greek manuscripts have <span id="vii.iv.v-p16.3"></span>απ᾿ ἀρχὢς, I
have in preference followed this reading. Should any one prefer
*first-fruits*, the meaning will be, that believers have been, as it
were, set aside for a sacred offering, by a metaphor taken from the
ancient custom of the law. Let us, however, hold by what is more
generally received, that he says that the Thessalonians were *chosen
from the beginning*

<span id="vii.iv.v-p17"></span>Some understand the meaning to be, that
they had been called among the first; but this is foreign to Paul’s
meaning, and does not accord with the connection of the passage. For he
does not merely exempt from fear a few individuals, who had been led to
Christ immediately on the commencement of the gospel, but this
consolation belongs to all the elect of God, without exception. When,
therefore, he says *from the beginning*, he means that there is no
danger lest their salvation, which is founded on God’s eternal election,
should be overthrown, whatever tumultuous changes may occur. “However
Satan may mix and confound all things in the world, your salvation,
notwithstanding, has been placed on a footing of safety, prior to the
creation of the world.” Here, therefore, is the true port of safety,
that God, who elected us of old,  <span
id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) will deliver us from all the evils
that threaten us. For we are elected to salvation; we shall, therefore,
be safe from destruction. But as it is not for us to penetrate into
God’s secret counsel, to seek *there* assurance of our salvation, he
specifies signs or tokens of election, which should suffice us for the
assurance of it.

<span id="vii.iv.v-p19"></span>*In sanctification of the spirit*, says
he, *and belief of the truth*. This may be explained in two ways, *with
sanctification*, or *by sanctification*. It is not of much importance
which of the two you select, as it is certain  <span
id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md) that Paul meant simply to introduce,
in connection with election, those nearer tokens which manifest to us
what is in its own nature incomprehensible, and are conjoined with it by
an indissoluble tie. Hence, in order that we may know that we are
elected by God, there is no occasion to inquire as to what he decreed
before the creation of the world, but we find in ourselves a
satisfactory proof if he has sanctified us by his Spirit, — if he has
enlightened us in the faith of his gospel. For the gospel is an evidence
to us of our adoption, and the Spirit seals it, and those that are *led
by the Spirit are the sons of God*, (<span
id="vii.iv.v-p20.2"></span>[Ro
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014.md)<span
id="vii.iv.v-p20.2"></span>,) and he who by faith possesses Christ has
everlasting life. (<span id="vii.iv.v-p20.3"></span>[1Jo
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012.md)<span
id="vii.iv.v-p20.3"></span>.) These things must be carefully observed,
lest, overlooking the revelation of God’s will, with which he bids us
rest satisfied, we should plunge into a profound labyrinth from a desire
to take it from his secret counsel, from the investigation of which he
draws us aside. Hence it becomes us to rest satisfied with the faith of
the gospel, and that grace of the Spirit by which we have been
regenerated. And by this means is refuted the wickedness  <span
id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md) of those who make the election of God
a pretext for every kind of iniquity, while Paul connects it with faith
and regeneration in such a manner, that he would not have it judged of
by us on any other grounds.

<span id="vii.iv.v-p22"></span><span id="vii.iv.v-p22.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.v-p23"></span>**14** *To which he called us*. He
repeats the same thing, though in somewhat different terms. For the sons
of God are not called otherwise than to the belief of the truth. Paul,
however, meant to shew here how competent a witness he is for confirming
that thing of which he was a minister. He accordingly puts himself
forward as a surety, that the Thessalonians may not doubt that the
gospel, in which they had been instructed by him, is the safety-bringing
voice of God, by which they are aroused from death, and are delivered
from the tyranny of Satan. He calls it *his* gospel, not as though it
had originated with him,  <span id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) but
inasmuch as the preaching of it had been committed to him.

<span id="vii.iv.v-p25"></span>What he adds, *to the acquisition* or
*possession of the glory of Christ*, may be taken either in an active or
in a passive signification — either as meaning, that they are called in
order that they may one day *possess* a glory in common with Christ, or
that Christ *acquired* them with a view to his glory. And thus it will
be a second means of confirmation that he will defend them, as being
nothing less than his own inheritance, and, in maintaining their
salvation, will stand forward in defense of his own glory; which latter
meaning, in my opinion, suits better.

<span id="vii.iv.vi"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>[2
Thessalonians 2:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#015.md)<span
id="vii.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p2"></span>**15**. Therefore, brethren, stand fast,
and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or
our epistle.

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p3"></span>**15**. Itaque fratres, state, et tenete
institutiones, quas didicistis vel per sermonem, vel per epistolam
nostram.

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p4"></span>**16**. Now our Lord Jesus Christ
himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given
*us* everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p5"></span>**16**. Ipse vero Dominus noster Iesus
Christus, et Deus, ac Pater noster, qui dilexcit nos, et dedit
consolationem aeternam, et spem bonam per gratiam,

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p6"></span>**17**. Comfort your hearts, and stablish
you in every good word and work.

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p7"></span>**17**. Consoletur corda vestra, et
stabiliat vos in omni opere et sermone bono.

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p8"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p9"></span><span id="vii.iv.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p10"></span>He deduces this exhortation on good
grounds from what goes before, inasmuch as our steadfastness and power
of perseverance rest on nothing else than assurance of divine grace.
When, however, God calls us to salvation, stretching forth, as it were,
his hand to us; when Christ, by the doctrine of the gospel, presents
himself to us to be enjoyed; when the Spirit is given us as a seal and
earnest of eternal life, though the heaven should fall, we must,
nevertheless, not become disheartened. Paul, accordingly, would have the
Thessalonians stand, not merely when others continue to stand, but with
a more settled stability; so that, on seeing almost all turning aside
from the faith, and all things full of confusion, they will,
nevertheless, retain their footing. And assuredly the calling of God
ought to fortify us against all occasions of offense in such a manner,
that not even the entire ruin of the world shall shake, much less
overthrow, our stability.

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p11"></span>**15** *Hold fast the institutions*.
Some restrict this to precepts of external polity; but this does not
please me, for he points out the manner of standing firm. Now, to be
furnished with invincible strength is a much higher thing than external
discipline. Hence, in my opinion, he includes all doctrine under this
term, as though he had said that they have ground on which they may
stand firm, provided they persevere in sound doctrine, according as they
had been instructed by him. I do not deny that the term <span
id="vii.iv.vi-p11.1"></span>παραδόσεις is fitly applied to the
ordinances which are appointed by the Churches, with a view to the
promoting of peace and the maintaining of order, and I admit that it is
taken in this sense when human traditions are treated of, (<span
id="vii.iv.vi-p11.2"></span>[Mt
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#006.md)<span
id="vii.iv.vi-p11.2"></span>.) Paul, however, will be found in the next
chapter making use of the term *tradition*, as meaning the rule that he
had laid down, and the very signification of the term is general. The
context, however, as I have said, requires that it be taken here to mean
the whole of that doctrine in which they had been instructed. For the
matter treated of is the most important of all — that their faith may
remain secure in the midst of a dreadful agitation of the Church.

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p12"></span>Papists, however, act a foolish part in
gathering from this that their traditions ought to be observed. They
reason, indeed, in this manner — that if it was allowable for Paul to
enjoin traditions, it was allowable also for other teachers; and that,
if it was a pious thing  <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) to
observe the former, the latter also ought not less to be observed.
Granting them, however, that Paul speaks of precepts belonging to the
external government of the Church, I say that they were, nevertheless,
not contrived by him, but divinely communicated. For he declares
elsewhere, (<span id="vii.iv.vi-p13.2"></span>[1Co
7:35](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#035.md)<span
id="vii.iv.vi-p13.2"></span>,) that it was not his intention to ensnare
consciences, as it was not lawful, either for himself, or for all the
Apostles together. They act a still more ridiculous part in making it
their aim to pass off, under this, the abominable sink of their own
superstitions, as though they were the traditions of Paul. But farewell
to these trifles, when we are in possession of Paul’s true meaning. And
we may judge in part from this Epistle what traditions he here
recommends, for he says — whether *by word*, that is, discourse, or *by
epistle*. Now, what do these Epistles contain but pure doctrine, which
overturns to the very foundation the whole of the Papacy, and every
invention that is at variance with the simplicity of the Gospel?

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p14"></span><span id="vii.iv.vi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p15"></span>**16** *Now the Lord himself*. When he
ascribes to Christ a work altogether Divine, and represents him, in
common with the Father, as the Author of the choicest blessings, as we
have in this a clear proof of the divinity of Christ, so we are
admonished, that we cannot obtain anything from God unless we seek it in
Christ himself: and when he asks that God may give him those things
which he had enjoined, he shews clearly enough how little influence
exhortations have, unless God inwardly move and affect our hearts.
Unquestionably there will be but an empty sound striking upon the ear,
if doctrine does not receive efficacy from the Spirit.

<span id="vii.iv.vi-p16"></span>What he afterwards adds, *who hath loved
you, and hath given consolation*, *etc.*, relates to confidence in
asking; for he would have the Thessalonians feel persuaded that God will
do what he prays for. And from what does he prove this? Because he once
shewed that they were dear to him, while he has already conferred upon
them distinguished favors, and in this manner has bound himself to them
for the time to come. This is what he means by *everlasting
consolation*. The term *hope*, also, has the same object in view — that
they may confidently expect a never-failing continuance of gifts. But
what does he ask? That God may sustain their hearts by his consolation;
for this is his office, to keep them from giving way through anxiety or
distrust; and farther, that he may give them perseverance, both in a
pious and holy course of life, and in sound doctrine; for I am of
opinion, that it is rather of this than of common discourse that he
speaks, so that this agrees with what goes before.
