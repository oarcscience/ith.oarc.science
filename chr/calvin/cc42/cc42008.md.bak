<span id="iv.v-p1"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="iv.v.i"></span>

<span id="iv.v.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.v.i-p1.1"></span>[Philippians
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.v.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.i-p2"></span>**1**. Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved
and longed for, my joy and corwn, so stand fast in the Lord, *my* dearly
beloved.

<span id="iv.v.i-p3"></span>**1**. Itaque, fratres mei dilecti et
desiderati, gaudium et corona mea, sic state in Domino, dilecti.

<span id="iv.v.i-p4"></span>**2**. I beseech Euodias, and beseech
Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.

<span id="iv.v.i-p5"></span>**2**. Euodian hortor, et Syntchen hortor,
ut unum sentiant in Domino.

<span id="iv.v.i-p6"></span>**3**. And I entreat thee also, true
yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with
Clement also, and *with* other my fellowlabourers, whose names *are* in
the book of life.

<span id="iv.v.i-p7"></span>**3**. Sane rogo etiam to, germane compar,
adiuva eas, quae in evangelio idem mecum certamen sustinuerunt, cum
Clemente etiam, et reliquis adiutoribus meis, quorum nomina sunt in
libro vitae.

<span id="iv.v.i-p8"></span> 

<span id="iv.v.i-p9"></span><span id="iv.v.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.i-p10"></span>**1.** *Therefore, my brethren* He
concludes his doctrine, as he is wont, with most urgent exhortations,
that he may fix it the more firmly in the minds of men. He also
insinuates himself into their affections by endearing appellations
 <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) , which at the same time are
not dictated by flattery, but by sincere affection. He calls them his
*joy* and *crown;* because, delighted to see those who had been gained
over through his instrumentality persevering in the faith  <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) , he hoped to attain that triumph, of
which we have spoken  <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) , when the
Lord will reward with a *crown* those things which have been
accomplished under his guidance.

<span id="iv.v.i-p14"></span>When he bids them *so stand fast in the
Lord,* he means that their condition is approved of by him. At the same
time, the particle *so* might be taken as referring to the doctrine
going before; but the former view is more suitable, so that, by praising
their present condition, he exhorts them to perseverance. They had
already, it is true, given some evidence of their constancy. Paul,
however, well knowing human weakness, reckons that they have need of
confirmation for the future.

<span id="iv.v.i-p15"></span><span id="iv.v.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.i-p16"></span>**2.** *I exhort Euodias and Syntyche* It
is an almost universally received opinion that Paul was desirous to
settle a quarrel, I know not of what sort, between those two women.
While I am not inclined to contend as to this, the words of Paul do not
afford ground enough for such a conjecture to satisfy us that it really
was so. It appears, from the testimony which he gives in their favor,
that they were very excellent women; for he assigns to them so much
honor as to call them fellow-soldiers in the gospel  <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) . Hence, as their agreement was a
matter of great moment  <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) , and,
on the other hand, there would be great danger attendant on their
disagreement, he stirs them up particularly to concord.

<span id="iv.v.i-p19"></span>We must take notice, however, that,
whenever he speaks of agreement, he adds also the bond of it—*in the*
*Lord.* For every combination will inevitably be accursed, if apart from
the Lord, and, on the other hand, nothing is so disjoined, but that it
ought to be reunited in Christ.

<span id="iv.v.i-p20"></span><span id="iv.v.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.i-p21"></span>**3** *I entreat thee, also, true
yokefellow* I am not inclined to dispute as to the gender of the noun,
and shall, accordingly, leave it undetermined  <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) , whether he addresses here a man or a
woman. At the same time there is excessive weakness in the argument of
Erasmus, who infers that it is a woman from the circumstance, that
mention is made here of other women — as though he did not immediately
subjoin the name of Clement in the same connection. I refrain, however,
from that dispute: only I maintain that it is not Paul’s wife that is
designated by this appellation. Those who maintain this, quote Clement
and Ignatius as their authorities. If they quoted correctly, I would not
certainly despise men of such eminence. But as writings are brought
forward from Eusebius  <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) which are
spurious, and were contrived by ignorant monks  <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) , they are not deserving of much
credit among readers of sound judgment  <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md)

<span id="iv.v.i-p26"></span>Let us, therefore, inquire as to the thing
itself, without taking any false impression from the opinions of men.
When Paul wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians, he was, as he
mentions, at that time unmarried.

<span id="iv.v.i-p27"></span>“To the unmarried,” says he, “and widows, I
say it is good that they should continue even as I am” (<span
id="iv.v.i-p27.1"></span>[1Co 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.v.i-p27.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.v.i-p28"></span> He wrote that Epistle at Ephesus  <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) when he was prepared to leave it. Not
long after, he proceeded to Jerusalem, where he was put in prison, and
sent to Rome. Every one must perceive how unsuitable a period of time it
would have been for marrying a wife, spent by him partly in journeying,
and partly in prison. In addition to this, he was even at that time
prepared to endure imprisonment and persecutions, as he himself
testifies, according to Luke. (<span id="iv.v.i-p29.4"></span>[Ac
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#013)<span id="iv.v.i-p29.4"></span>..md)
I am, at the same time, well aware what objection is usually brought
forward in opposition to this — that Paul, though married, refrained
from conjugal intercourse. The words, however, convey another meaning,
for he is desirous that unmarried persons may have it in their power to
remain in the same condition with himself. Now, what is that condition
but celibacy? As to their bringing forward that passage —

<span id="iv.v.i-p30"></span>Is it not lawful for me to lead about a
wife (<span id="iv.v.i-p30.1"></span>[1Co
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005)<span id="iv.v.i-p30.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="iv.v.i-p31"></span>for the purpose of proving he had a wife,
it is too silly to require any refutation  <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) . But granting that Paul was married,
how *came* his wife to be at Philippi — a city which we do not read of
his entering on more than two occasions, and in which it is probable he
never remained so much as two whole months? In fine, nothing is more
unlikely than that he speaks here of his wife; and to me it does not
seem probable that he speaks of any female. I leave it, however, to the
judgment of my readers. The word which Paul makes use of here (<span
id="iv.v.i-p32.3"></span>συλλάμβανεσθαι*)* means, to take hold of a
thing and embrace it along with another person, with the view of giving
help  <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md)

<span id="iv.v.i-p34"></span>*Whose names are in the book of life* The
*book of life* is the roll of the righteous, who are predestinated to
life, as in the writings of Moses. (<span id="iv.v.i-p34.1"></span>[Ex
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032)<span id="iv.v.i-p34.1"></span>..md)
God has this roll beside himself in safekeeping. Hence the book is
nothing else than His eternal counsel, fixed in His own breast. In place
of this term, Ezekiel employs this expression — *the writing of the
house of Israel.* With the same view it is said in

<span id="iv.v.i-p35"></span>Let them be blotted out of the book of the
living, and let them not be written among the righteous; (<span
id="iv.v.i-p35.1"></span>[Ps
69:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028)<span id="iv.v.i-p35.1"></span>.md)

<span id="iv.v.i-p36"></span>that is, let them not be numbered among the
elect of God, whom he receives within the limits of his Church and
kingdom  <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) .

<span id="iv.v.i-p38"></span>Should any one allege, that Paul therefore
acts rashly in usurping to himself the right of pronouncing as to the
secrets of God, I answer, that we may in some measure form a judgment
from the token by which God manifests his election, but only in so far
as our capacity admits. In all those, therefore, in whom we see the
marks of adoption shine forth, let us in the mean time reckon those to
be the sons of God until the *books are opened,* (<span
id="iv.v.i-p38.1"></span>[Re
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#012)<span id="iv.v.i-p38.1"></span>,.md)
which will thoroughly bring all things to view. It belongs, it is true,
to God alone now to *know them that are his,* (<span
id="iv.v.i-p38.2"></span>[2Ti
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019)<span id="iv.v.i-p38.2"></span>,.md)
and to separate at least the lambs from the kids;  <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) but it is our part to reckon in
charity all to be lambs who, in a spirit of obedience, submit themselves
to Christ as their Shepherd  <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) ,
who betake themselves to his fold, and remain there constantly. It is
our part to set so high a value upon the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which
he confers peculiarly on his elect, that they shall be to us the seals,
as it were, of an election which is hid from us.

<span id="iv.v.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.v.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.v.ii-p1.1"></span>[Philippians
4:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.v.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.ii-p2"></span>**4**. Rejoice in the Lord alway: *and*
again I say, Rejoice.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p3"></span>**4**. Gaudete in Domino semper, iterum
dico, gaudete.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p4"></span>**5**. Let your moderation be known unto
all men. The Lord *is* at hand.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p5"></span>**5**. Moderatio vestra nota sit omnibus
hominibus. Dominus prope est.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p6"></span>**6**. Be careful for nothing; but in every
thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be
made known unto God.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p7"></span>**6**. De nulla re sitis solliciti: sed in
omnibus, oratione et precatione, cum gratiarum actione, petitiones
vestrae innotescant apud Deum.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p8"></span>**7**. And the peace of God, which passeth
all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ
Jesus.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p9"></span>**7**. Et pax Dei, quae exsuperat omnem
intelligentiam, custodiet corda vestra et cogitationes vestras in
Christo Iesu.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p10"></span>**8**. Finally, brethren, whatsoever
things are true, whatsoever things *are* honest, whatsoever things *are*
just, whatsoever things *are* pure, whatsoever things *are* lovely,
whatsoever things *are* of good report; if *there be* any virtue, and if
*there be* any praise, think on these things

<span id="iv.v.ii-p11"></span>**8**. Quod reliquum est, fratres,
quaecunque sunt vera, quaecunque gravia, qaecunque iusta, quaecunque
pura, quaecunque amabilia, quaecunque honesta: si qua virtus, et qua
laus, haec cogitate.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p12"></span>**9**. Those things, which ye have both
learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of
peace shall be with you.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p13"></span>**9**. Quae et didicistis, et suscepistis,
et audistis, et vidistis in me: haec facite, et Deus pacis erit
vobiscum.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p14"></span> 

<span id="iv.v.ii-p15"></span><span id="iv.v.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.ii-p16"></span>**4.** *Rejoice in the Lord* It is an
exhortation suited to the times; for, as the condition of the pious was
exceedingly troublous, and dangers threatened them on every side, it was
possible that they might give way, overcome by grief or impatience.
 <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) Hence he enjoins it upon them,
that, amidst circumstances of hostility and disturbance, they should
nevertheless *rejoice in the Lord,*  <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) as assuredly these spiritual
consolations, by means of which the Lord refreshes and gladdens us,
ought *then* most of all to show their efficacy when the whole world
tempts us to despair. Let us, however, in connection with the
circumstances of the times, consider what efficacy there must have been
in this word uttered by the mouth of Paul, who might have had special
occasion of sorrow.  <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) For if they
are appalled by persecutions, or imprisonments, or exile, or death, here
is the Apostle setting himself forward, who, amidst imprisonments, in
the very heat of persecution, and in fine, amidst apprehensions of
death, is not merely himself joyful, but even stirs up others to joy.
The sum, then, is this — that come what may, believers, having the Lord
standing on their side  <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) , have
amply sufficient ground of joy.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p21"></span>The repetition of the exhortation serves
to give greater force to it: Let this be your strength and stability, to
*rejoice in the Lord,* and that, too, not for a moment merely, but so
that your joy in him may be perpetuated.  <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) For unquestionably it differs from the
joy of the world in this respect — that we know from experience that the
joy of the world is deceptive, frail, and fading, and Christ even
pronouces it to be accursed (<span id="iv.v.ii-p22.2"></span>[Lu
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025)<span id="iv.v.ii-p22.2"></span>.md).
Hence, that only is a settled joy in God which is such as is never taken
away from us.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p23"></span><span id="iv.v.ii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.ii-p24"></span>**5** *Your moderation* This may be
explained in two ways. We may understand him as bidding them rather give
up their right, than that any one should have occasion to complain of
their sharpness or severity. *“*Let all that have to deal with you have
experience of your equity and humanity.” In this way to *know,* will
mean to *experience.* Or we may understand him as exhorting them to
endure all things with equanimity.  <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) This latter meaning I rather prefer;
for is a term that is made use of by the Greeks themselves to denote
moderation of spirit — when we are not easily moved by injuries, when we
are not easily annoyed by adversity, but retain equanimity of temper. In
accordance with this, Cicero makes use of the following expression, —
“My mind is tranquil, which takes everything in good part.”  <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) Such equanimity — which is as it were
the mother of patience — he requires here on the part of the
Philippians, and, indeed, such as will manifest itself to all, according
as occasion will require, by producing its proper effects. The term
*modesty* does not seem appropriate here, because Paul is not in this
passage cautioning them against haughty insolence, but directs them to
conduct themselves peaceably in everything, and exercise control over
themselves, even in the endurance of injuries or inconveniences.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p27"></span>*The Lord is at hand* Here we have an
*anticipation,* by which he obviates an objection that might be brought
forward. For carnal sense rises in opposition to the foregoing
statement. For as the rage of the wicked is the more inflamed in
proportion to our mildness,  <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) and
the more they see us prepared for enduring, are the more emboldened to
inflict injuries, we are with difficulty induced to *possess our souls
in patience.* (<span id="iv.v.ii-p28.2"></span>[Lu
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.v.ii-p28.2"></span>.) Hence those proverbs, — “*We* must howl
when among wolves.” “Those who act like sheep will quickly be devoured
by wolves.” Hence we conclude, that the ferocity of the wicked must be
repressed by corresponding violence, that they may not insult us with
impunity.  <span id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) To such
considerations Paul here opposes confidence in Divine providence. He
replies, I say, that *the Lord is at hand,* whose power can overcome
their audacity, and whose goodness can conquer their malice. He promises
that he will aid us, provided we obey his commandment. Now, who would
not rather be protected by the hand of God alone, than have all the
resources of the world at his command?

<span id="iv.v.ii-p30"></span>Here we have a most beautiful sentiment,
from which we learn, in the *first* place, that ignorance of the
providence of God is the cause of all impatience, and that this is the
reason why we are so quickly, and on trivial accounts, thrown into
confusion,  <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) and often, too,
become disheartened because we do not recognize the fact that the Lord
cares for us. On the other hand, we learn that this is the only remedy
for tranquillizing our minds — when we repose unreservedly in his
providential care, as knowing that we are not exposed either to the
rashness of fortune, or to the caprice of the wicked,  <span
id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) but are under the regulation of God’s
fatherly care. In fine, the man that is in possession of this truth,
that God is present with him, has what he may rest upon with security.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p33"></span>There are, however, two ways in which *the
Lord* is said to be *at hand* — either because his judgment is at hand,
or because he is prepared to give help to his own people, in which sense
it is made use of here; and also in <span id="iv.v.ii-p33.1"></span>[Ps
145:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.v.ii-p33.1"></span>, *The Lord is near to all that call upon
him.* The meaning therefore *is,* — “Miserable were the condition of the
pious, if the Lord were at a distance from them.” But as he has received
them under his protection and guardianship, and defends them by his
hand, which is everywhere present, let them rest upon this
consideration, that they may not be intimidated by the rage of the
wicked. It is well known, and matter of common occurrence, that the term
<span id="iv.v.ii-p33.2"></span>*solicitudo* (carefulness) is employed
to denote that anxiety which proceeds from distrust of Divine power or
help.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p34"></span><span id="iv.v.ii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.ii-p35"></span>**6** *But in all things* It is the
singular number that is made use of by Paul, but is the neuter gender;
the expression, therefore, is equivalent to <span
id="iv.v.ii-p35.1"></span>*omni negotio, (in every matter,*) for
(*prayer*) and (*supplication*) are feminine nouns. In these words he
exhorts the Philippians, as David does all the pious in <span
id="iv.v.ii-p35.2"></span>[Ps
55:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#022.md)<span id="iv.v.ii-p35.2"></span>,
and Peter also in <span id="iv.v.ii-p35.3"></span>[1Pe
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.v.ii-p35.3"></span>,
to *cast all their care upon the Lord.* For we are not made of iron,
 <span id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) so as not to be shaken by
temptations. But this is our consolation, this is our solace — to
deposit, or (to speak with greater propriety) to disburden in the bosom
of God everything that harasses us. Confidence, it is true, brings
tranquillity to our minds, but it is only in the event of our exercising
ourselves in prayers. Whenever, therefore, we are assailed by any
temptation, let us betake ourselves forthwith to prayer, as to a sacred
asylum.  <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md)

<span id="iv.v.ii-p38"></span>The term *requests* he employs here to
denote desires or wishes. He would have us make these known to God by
prayer and supplication, as though believers poured forth their hearts
before God, when they commit themselves, and all that they have, to Him.
Those, indeed, who look hither and thither to the vain comforts of the
world, may appear to be in some degree relieved; but there is one sure
refuge — leaning upon the Lord.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p39"></span>*With thanksgiving* As many often pray to
God amiss,  <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) full of complaints
or of murmurings, as though they had just ground for accusing him, while
others cannot brook delay, if he does not immediately gratify their
desires, Paul on this account conjoins thanksgiving with prayers. It is
as though he had said, that those things which are necessary for us
ought to be desired by us from the Lord in such a way, that we,
nevertheless, subject our affections to his good pleasure, and give
thanks while presenting petitions. And, unquestionably, gratitude  <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) will have this effect upon us — that
the will of God will be the grand sum of our desires.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p42"></span><span id="iv.v.ii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.ii-p43"></span>**7.** *And the peace of God* Some, by
turning the future tense into the optative mood, convert this statement
into a prayer, but it is without proper foundation. For it is a promise
in which he points out the advantage of a firm confidence in God, and
invocation of him. *“If* you do that,” says he, *“the peace of God will
keep your minds and hearts.”* Scripture is accustomed to divide the soul
of man, as to its frailties, into two parts — the *mind* and the
*heart.* The *mind* means the *understanding,* while the *heart* denotes
all the *disposition* or *inclinations.* These two terms, therefore,
include the entire soul, in this sense, — “The peace of God will guard
you, so as to prevent you from turning back from God in wicked thoughts
or desires.”

<span id="iv.v.ii-p44"></span>It is on good ground that he calls it the
*peace of God,* inasmuch as it does not depend on the present aspect of
things,  <span id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) and does not bend
itself to the various shiftings of the world,  <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) but is founded on the firm and
immutable word of God. It is on good grounds, also, that he speaks of it
as *surpassing all understanding* or *perception,* for nothing is more
foreign to the human mind, than in the depth of despair to exercise,
nevertheless, a feeling of hope, in the depth of poverty to see
*opulence,* and in the depth of weakness to keep from giving way, and,
in fine, to promise ourselves that nothing will be wanting to us when we
are left destitute of all things; and all this in the grace of God
alone, which is not itself known otherwise than through the word, and
the inward earnest of the Spirit.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p47"></span><span id="iv.v.ii-p47.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.ii-p48"></span>**8.** *Finally* What follows consists of
general exhortations which relate to the whole of life. In the *first*
place, he commends *truth,* which is nothing else than the integrity of
a good conscience, with the fruits of it: *secondly, gravity,* or
*sanctity,* for <span id="iv.v.ii-p48.1"></span>τὸ σεμνόν  <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) denotes both — an excellence which
consists in this, that we walk in a manner *worthy of our vocation,*
(<span id="iv.v.ii-p49.5"></span>[Eph
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#001)<span id="iv.v.ii-p49.5"></span>,.md)
keeping at a distance from all profane filthiness: *thirdly, justice,*
which has to do with the mutual intercourse of mankind — that we do not
injure any one, that we do not defraud any one; and, *fourthly, purity,*
which denotes chastity in every department of life. Paul, however, does
not reckon all these things to be sufficient, if we do not at the same
time endeavor to make ourselves agreeable to all, in so far as we may
lawfully do so in the Lord, and have regard also to our good name. For
it is in this way that I understand the words —

<span id="iv.v.ii-p50"></span>If any praise,  <span
id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) that is, *anything praiseworthy*, for
amidst such a corruption of manners there is so great a perversity in
men’s judgments that praise is often bestowed  <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) upon what is blameworthy, and it is
not allowable for Christians to be desirous even of true praise among
men, inasmuch as they are elsewhere forbidden to glory, except in God
alone. (<span id="iv.v.ii-p52.2"></span>[1Co
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031)<span id="iv.v.ii-p52.2"></span>..md)
Paul, therefore, does not bid them try to gain applause or commendation
by virtuous actions, nor even to regulate their life according to the
judgments of the people, but simply means, that they should devote
themselves to the performance of good works, which merit commendation,
that the wicked, and those who are enemies of the gospel, while they
deride Christians and cast reproach upon them, may, nevertheless, be
constrained to commend their deportment.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p53"></span>The word, <span
id="iv.v.ii-p53.1"></span>προσφιλὢ καὶ εὔφημα however, among the Greeks,
is employed, like <span id="iv.v.ii-p53.2"></span>*cogitare* among the
Latins, to mean, meditate.  <span id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) Now
meditation comes first, afterwards follows action.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p55"></span><span id="iv.v.ii-p55.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.ii-p56"></span>**9.** *What things ye have learned, and
received, and heard* By this accumulation of terms he intimates, that he
was assiduous in inculcating these things. *“This* was my doctrine — my
instruction — my discourse among you.” Hypocrites, on the other hand,
insisted upon nothing but ceremonies. Now, it was a dishonorable thing
to abandon the holy instruction,  <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) which they had wholly imbibed, and
with which they had been thorouglly imbued.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p58"></span>*You have seen in me* Now, the main thing
in a public speaker  <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) should be,
that he may speak, not with his mouth merely, but by his life, and
procure authority for his doctrine by rectitude of life. Paul,
accordingly, procures authority for his exhortation on this ground, that
he had, by his life no less than by his mouth, been a leader and master
of virtues.

<span id="iv.v.ii-p60"></span>*And the God of peace* He had spoken of
the *peace of God;* he now more particularly confirms what he had said,
by promising that God himself, the Author of peace, will be with them.
For the presence of God brings us every kind of blessing: as though he
had said, that they would feel that God was present with them to make
all things turn out well and prosperously, provided they apply
themselves to pious and holy actions.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p2"></span>**10**. But I rejoiced in the Lord
greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again;
wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p3"></span>**10**. Gavisu sum autem in domino valde,
quod aliquando reviguistis in studio mei, de quo etiam cogitabatis, sed
deerat opportunitas.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p4"></span>**11**. Not that I speak in respect of
want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, *therewith* to be
content.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p5"></span>**11**. Non quod secundum penuriam loquar;
ego enim didici, in quibus sum, iis contentus esse.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p6"></span>**12**. I know both how to be abased, and
I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both
to be full and be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p7"></span>**12**. Novi et humilis esse, novi et
excellere: ubique et in omnibus institutus sum, et saturari, et esurire,
et abundare, et penuriam pati.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p8"></span>**13**. I can do all things through Christ
which strengtheneth me.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p9"></span>**13**. Omnia possum in Christo, qui me
corroborat.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p10"></span>**14**. Notwithstanding ye have well
done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p11"></span>**14**. Caeterum benefecistis simul
communicando afflictioni meae.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p12"></span> 

<span id="iv.v.iii-p13"></span><span id="iv.v.iii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iii-p14"></span>**10** *But I rejoiced* He now declares
the gratitude of his mind towards the Philippians, that they may not
regret their beneficence,  <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) as is
usually the case when we think that our services are despised, or are
reckoned of no account. They had sent him by Epaphroditus supplies for
the relief of his necessity; he declares that their present had been
acceptable to him, and he says, that he rejoiced that they had plucked
up new vigor so as to exercise care respecting him. The metaphor is
borrowed from trees, the strength of which is drawn inward, and lies
concealed during winter, and begins to flourish  <span
id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) in spring. But immediately afterwards
subjoining a correction, he qualifies what he had said, that he may not
seem to reprove their negligence in the past. He says, therefore, that
they had formerly, too, been concerned respecting him, but that the
circumstances of the times had not admitted of his being sooner relieved
by their benignity. Thus he throws the blame upon the want of
opportunity. I take the phrase <span id="iv.v.iii-p16.2"></span>ἐφ᾿ ᾧ᾿
as referring to the person of Paul, and that is its proper
signification, as well as more in accordance with the connection of
Paul’s words.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p17"></span><span id="iv.v.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iii-p18"></span>**11** *Not that I speak with respect to
want* Here we have *a second* correction, by which he guards against its
being suspected that his spirit was pusillanimous and broken down by
adversities. For it was of importance that his constancy and moderation
should be known by the Philippians, to whom he was a pattern of life.
Accordingly he declares, that he had been gratified by their liberality
in such a way that he could at the same time endure want with patience.
*Want* refers here to disposition, for that man can never be poor in
mind, who is satisfied with the lot which has been assigned to him by
God.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p19"></span>*In what state I am,* says he, that is,
*“Whatever* my condition may be, I am satisfied with it.” Why? because
saints know that they thus please God. Hence they do not measure
sufficiency by abundance, but by the will of God, which they judge of by
what takes place, for they are persuaded that their affairs are
regulated by his providence and good pleasure.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p20"></span><span id="iv.v.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iii-p21"></span>**12** *I know both how to be abased*
There follows here a distinction, with the view of intimating that he
has a mind adapted to bear any kind of condition.  <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) Prosperity is wont to puff up the mind
beyond measure, and adversity, on the other hand, to depress. From both
faults he declares himself to be free. *I know,* says he, *to be abased*
— that is, *to endure abasement with patience.* <span
id="iv.v.iii-p22.2"></span>Περισσεύειν is made use of twice, but in the
former instance it is employed as meaning, to *excel;* in the *second*
instance as meaning, to *abound,* so as to correspond with the things to
which they are exposed. If a man knows to make use of present abundance
in a sober and temperate manner, with thanksgiving, prepared to part
with everything whenever it may be the good pleasure of the Lord, giving
also a share to his brother, according to the measure of his ability,
and is also not puffed up, that man has learned to *excel,* and to
*abound.* This is a peculiarly excellent and rare virtue, and much
superior to the endurance of poverty. Let all who wish to be Christ’s
disciples exercise themselves in acquiring this knowledge which was
possessed by Paul, but in the mean time let them accustom themselves to
the endurance of poverty in such a manner that it will not be grievous
and burdensome to them when they come to be deprived of their riches.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p23"></span><span id="iv.v.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iii-p24"></span>**13** *I can do all things through
Christ* As he had boasted of things that were very great,  <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) in order that this might not be
attributed to pride or furnish others with occasion of foolish boasting,
he adds, that it is by Christ that he is endowed with this fortitude.
“*I can do all things,*” says he, “but it is in Christ, not by my own
power, for it is Christ that supplies me with strength.” Hence we infer,
that Christ will not be less strong and invincible in us also, if,
conscious of our own weakness, we place reliance upon his power alone.
When he says *all things,* he means merely those things which belong to
his calling.

<span id="iv.v.iii-p26"></span><span id="iv.v.iii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iii-p27"></span>**14** *Nevertheless ye did well* How
prudently and cautiously he acts, looking round carefully in both
directions, that he may not lean too much to the one side or to the
other. By proclaiming in magnificent terms his steadfastness, he meant
to provide against the Philippians supposing that he had given way under
the pressure of want.  <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) He now
takes care that it may not, from his speaking in high terms, appear as
though he despised their kindness — a thing that would not merely shew
cruelty and obstinacy, but also haughtiness. He at the same time
provides for this, that if any other of the servants of Christ should
stand in need of their assistance they may not be slow to give him help.

<span id="iv.v.iv"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p1"></span><span id="iv.v.iv-p1.1"></span>[Philippians

<span id="iv.v.iv-p2"></span>**15**. Now ye Philippians know also, that
in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no
church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye
only.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p3"></span>**15**. Nostis autem et vos Philippenses,
quod initio Evangelii, qunado exivi ex Macedonia, nulla mecum Ecclesia
in ratione dati et accepti, nisi vos soli.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p4"></span>**16**. For even in Thessalonica ye sent
once and again unto my necessity.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p5"></span>**16**. Nam et Tessalonicam semel atque
iterum mihi, quod opus erat, misistis:

<span id="iv.v.iv-p6"></span>**17**. Not because I desire a gift: but I
desire fruit that may abound to your account.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p7"></span>**17**. Non quia requiram donum, sed
requiro fructum, qui exsuperet in rationem vestram.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p8"></span>**18**. But I have all, and abound: I am
full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which *were sent from*
you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to
God.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p9"></span>**18**. Accepi autem omnia et abundo,
impletus sum, postquam ab Epaphrodito accepi, quai missa sunt a vobis in
odorem bonae fragrantiae, sacrificium acceptum gractum Deo.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p10"></span>**19**. But my God shall supply all your
need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p11"></span>**19**. Deus autem meus implebit, quicquid
vobis opus est, secundum divitias suas in gloria per Christum Iesum.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p12"></span>**20**. Now unto God and our Father *be*
glory for ever and ever. Amen.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p13"></span>**20**. Porro Deo et Patri nostro gloria

<span id="iv.v.iv-p14"></span>**21**. Salute every saint in Christ
Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p15"></span>**21**. Salutate omnes sanctos in Christo
Iesu. Salutant vos qui mecum sunt fratres.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p16"></span>**22**. All the saints salute you, chiefly
they that are of Cesar’s household.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p17"></span>**22**. Salutant vos omnes sancti: maxime
qui sunt ex domo Caesaris.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p18"></span>**23**. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
*be* with you all. Amen.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p19"></span>**23**. Gratia domini nostri Iesu Christi
cum omnibus vobis. Amen.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p20"></span>It was written to the Philippians from
Rome by Epaphroditus.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p21"></span>Scripta est a roma per Epaphroditum.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p22"></span> 

<span id="iv.v.iv-p23"></span><span id="iv.v.iv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p24"></span>**15** *And ye know* I understand this to
have been added by way of excuse, inasmuch as he often received
something from them, for if the other Churches had discharged their
duty, it might have seemed as though he were too eager to receive. Hence
in clearing himself he praises them, and in praising them he modestly
excuses others. We must also, after Paul’s example, take heed lest the
pious, on seeing us too much inclined to receive from others, should on
good grounds reckon us to be insatiable. *You also know,* says he. *“I*
do not require to call in other witnesses, for ye yourselves also know.”
For it frequently happens, that when one thinks that others are
deficient in duty, he is the more liberal in giving assistance. Thus the
liberality of some escapes the notice of others.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p25"></span>*In the matter of giving and receiving* He
alludes to pecuniary matters, in which there are two parts, the one
*receiving,* the other *expending.* It is necessary that these should be
brought to an equality by mutual compensation. There was an account of
this nature carried on between Paul and the Churches.  <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) While Paul administered the gospel to
them, there was an obligation devolving upon them in return for
supplying what was necessary for the support of his life, as he says
elsewhere,

<span id="iv.v.iv-p27"></span>If we dispense to you spiritual thinqs, is
it a great matter if you give in return carnal things? (<span
id="iv.v.iv-p27.1"></span>[1Co
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#011)<span id="iv.v.iv-p27.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.v.iv-p28"></span>Hence, if the other churches had relieved
Paul’s necessities, they would have been giving nothing gratuitously,
but would have been simply paying their debt, for they ought to have
acknowledged themselves indebted to him for the gospel. This, however,
he acknowledges, had not been the case, inasmuch as they had not laid
out anything on his account. What base ingratitude, and how very
unseemly, to treat such an Apostle with neglect, to whom they knew
themselves to be under obligation beyond their power to discharge! On
the other hand, how great the forbearance of this holy man, to bear with
their inhumanity with so much gentleness and indulgence, as not to make
use of one sharp word by way of accusing them!

<span id="iv.v.iv-p29"></span><span id="iv.v.iv-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p30"></span>**17.** *Not that I demand a gift.* Again
he repels an unfavourable opinion that might be formed of immoderate
cupidity, that they might not suppose that it was an indirect hint,
 <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) as if they ought singly to
stand in the room of all,  <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) and
as if he abused their kindness. He accordingly declares, that he
consulted not so much his own advantage as theirs. “While I receive from
you,” says he, *“there* is proportionably much advantage that redounds
to yourselves; for there are just so many articles that you may reckon
to have been transferred to the table of accounts.” The meaning of this
word  <span id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) is connected with the
similitude formerly employed of exchange or compensation in pecuniary
matters.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p34"></span><span id="iv.v.iv-p34.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p35"></span>**18** *I have received all things, and
abound* He declares in more explicit terms, that he has what is
sufficient, and honors their liberality with a remarkable testimony, by
saying, that he *has been filled.* It was undoubtedly a moderate sum
that they had sent, but he says, that by means of that moderate sum he
is filled to satiety. It is, however, a more distinguished commendation
that he bestows upon the gift in what follows, when he calls it a
*sacrifice acceptable, and presented as the odour of a good fragrance*
For what better thing can be desired than that our acts of kindness
should be sacred offerings, which God receives from our hands, and takes
pleasure in their sweet odour? For the same reason Christ says,
*Whatsoever ye shall have done unto one of the least of these, ye have
done it unto me.*

<span id="iv.v.iv-p36"></span>The similitude of sacrifices, however,
adds much emphasis, by which we are taught, that the exercise of love
which God enjoins upon us, is not merely a benefit conferred upon man,
but is also a spiritual and sacred service which is performed to God, as
we read in the Epistle to the Hebrews, that he is well pleased with such
sacrifices. (<span id="iv.v.iv-p36.1"></span>[Heb
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.v.iv-p36.1"></span>.) Alas for our indolence!  <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) — which appears in this, that while
God invites us with so much kindness to the honor of priesthood, and
even puts sacrifices in our hands, we nevertheless do not sacrifice to
him, and those things which were set apart for sacred oblations we not
only lay out for profane uses, but squander them wickedly upon the most
polluted contaminations.  <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) For
the altars, on which sacrifices from our resources ought to be
presented, are the poor, and the servants of Christ. To the neglect of
these some squander their resources on every kind of luxury, others upon
the palate, others upon immodest attire, others upon magnificent
dwellings.  <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md)

<span id="iv.v.iv-p40"></span><span id="iv.v.iv-p40.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p41"></span>**19** *My God will supply* Some read
<span id="iv.v.iv-p41.1"></span>*impleat* — in the *optative* — *May he
supply.*  <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) While I do not reject
this reading, I approve more of the other. He expressly makes mention of
God as *his,* because he owns and acknowledges as done to himself
whatever kindness is shewn to his servants. They had therefore been
truly sowing in the Lord’s field, from which a sure and abundant harvest
might be expected. Nor does he promise them merely a reward in the
future life, but even in respect of the necessities of the present life:
*“*Do not think that you have impoverished yourselves; God, whom I
serve, will abundantly furnish you with everything necessary for you.”
The phrase, *in glory,* ought to be taken in place of the adverb
*gloriously,* as meaning *magnificently,* or *splendidly.* He adds,
however, *by Christ,* in whose name everything that we do is acceptable
to God.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p43"></span><span id="iv.v.iv-p43.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p44"></span>**20** *Now to our God and Father* This
may be taken as a general thanksgiving, by which he closes the epistle;
or it may be viewed as bearing more particularly upon the last clause in
reference to the liberality shewn to Paul.  <span
id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) For in respect of the assistance which
the Philippians had afforded him, it became him to reckon himself
indebted to them for it in such a manner as to acknowledge, that this
aid had been afforded to them by the mercy of God.

<span id="iv.v.iv-p46"></span><span id="iv.v.iv-p46.1"></span>

<span id="iv.v.iv-p47"></span>**22** *The brethren that are with me
salute you* In these salutations he names first of all his intimate
associates,  <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) afterwards all the
saints in general, that is, the whole Church at Rome, but chiefly those
of the household of Nero — a thing well deserving to be noticed; for it
is no common evidence of divine mercy, that the gospel had made its way
into that sink of all crimes and iniquities. It is also the more to be
admired, in proportion as it is a rare thing for holiness to reign in
the courts of sovereigns. The conjecture formed by some, that Seneca is
here referred to among others, has no appearance of foundation; for he
never gave any evidence, even the smallest, of his being a Christian;
nor did he belong to the *household of Caesar,* but was a senator, and
had at one time held the office of praetor.  <span
