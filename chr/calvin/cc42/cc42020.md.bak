<span id="vi.v-p1"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="vi.v.i"></span>

<span id="vi.v.i-p1"></span><span id="vi.v.i-p1.1"></span>[1
Thessalonians 3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.v.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.i-p2"></span>**1**. Wherefore when we could no longer
forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;

<span id="vi.v.i-p3"></span>**1**. Quare non amplius sufferentes
censuimus, ut Athenis relinqueremur soli:

<span id="vi.v.i-p4"></span>**2**. And sent Timotheus, our brother, and
minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to
establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:

<span id="vi.v.i-p5"></span>**2**. Et misimus Timotheum fratrem nostrum,
et ministrum Dei, et cooperarium nostrum in evangelio Christi, ut
confirmaret vos, et vobis animum adderet ex fide nostra,

<span id="vi.v.i-p6"></span>**3**. That no man should be moved by these
afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

<span id="vi.v.i-p7"></span>**3**. Ut nemo turbaretur in his
afflictionibus: ipsi enim nostis quod in hoc sumus constituti.

<span id="vi.v.i-p8"></span>**4**. For verily, when we were with you, we
told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to
pass, and ye know.

<span id="vi.v.i-p9"></span>**4**. Etenim quum essemus apud vos,
praediximus vobis quod essemus afflictiones passuri; quemadmodum etiam
accidit, et nostis.

<span id="vi.v.i-p10"></span>**5**. For this cause, when I could no
longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the
tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.

<span id="vi.v.i-p11"></span>**5**. Quamobrem et ego non amplius
sustinens, misi ut cognoscerem fidem vestram: ne forte tentasset vos, is
qui tentat, et exinanitus esset labor noster.

<span id="vi.v.i-p12"></span> 

<span id="vi.v.i-p13"></span><span id="vi.v.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.i-p14"></span>**1** *Wherefore, when we could no longer
endure*. By the detail which follows, he assures them of the desire of
which he had spoken. For if, on being detained elsewhere, he had sent no
other to Thessalonica in his place, it might have seemed as though he
were not so much concerned in regard to them; but when he substitutes
Timothy in his place, he removes that suspicion, more especially when he
prefers them before himself. Now that he esteemed them above himself, he
shews from this, that he chose rather to be left alone than that they
should be deserted: for these words, *we judged it good to be left
alone*, are emphatic. Timothy was a most faithful companion to him: he
had at that time no others with him; hence it was inconvenient and
distressing for him to be without him. It is therefore a token of rare
affection and anxious desire that he does not refuse to deprive himself
of all comfort, with the view of relieving the Thessalonians. To the
same effect is the word <span id="vi.v.i-p14.1"></span>εὐδοκήσαμεν,
which expresses a prompt inclination of the mind.  <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md)

<span id="vi.v.i-p16"></span><span id="vi.v.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.i-p17"></span>**2** *Our brother*. He assigns to him
these marks of commendation, that he may shew the more clearly how much
inclined he was to consult their welfare: for if he had sent them some
common person, it could not have afforded them much assistance; and
inasmuch as Paul would have done this without inconvenience to himself,
he would have given no remarkable proof of his fatherly concern in
regard to them. It is, on the other hand, a great thing that he deprives
himself of a *brother* and *fellow-laborer*, and one to whom, as he
declares in <span id="vi.v.i-p17.1"></span>[Php
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#020.md)<span id="vi.v.i-p17.1"></span>,
he found no equal, inasmuch as all aimed at the promotion of their own
interests. In the mean time,  <span id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) he
procures authority for the doctrine which they had received from
Timothy, that it may remain the more deeply impressed upon their memory.

<span id="vi.v.i-p19"></span>It is, however, with good reason that he
says that he had *sent Timothy* with this view — that they might receive
a *confirmation of their faith* from his example. They might be
intimidated by unpleasant reports as to persecutions; but Paul’s
undaunted constancy was fitted so much the more to animate them, so as
to keep them from giving way. And, assuredly, the fellowship which ought
to subsist between the saints and members of Christ extends even thus
far — that the faith of one is the consolation of others. Thus, when the
Thessalonians heard that Paul was going on with indefatigable zeal, and
was by strength of faith surmounting all dangers and all difficulties,
and that his faith continued everywhere victorious against Satan and the
world, this brought them no small consolation. More especially we are,
or at least ought to be, stimulated by the examples of those by whom we
were instructed in the faith, as is stated in the end of the Epistle to
the Hebrews. (<span id="vi.v.i-p19.1"></span>[Heb
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#007)<span id="vi.v.i-p19.1"></span>.md)
Paul, accordingly, means that they ought to be fortified by his example,
so as not to give way under their afflictions. As, however, they might
have been offended if Paul had entertained a fear lest they should all
give way under persecutions, (inasmuch as this would have been an
evidence of excessive distrust,) he mitigates this harshness by saying —
*lest any one*, or, *that no one*. There was, however, good reason to
fear this, as there are always some weak persons in every society.

<span id="vi.v.i-p20"></span><span id="vi.v.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.i-p21"></span>**3** *For ye yourselves know*. As all
would gladly exempt themselves from the necessity of bearing the cross,
Paul teaches that there is no reason why believers should feel dismayed
on occasion of persecutions, as though it were a thing that was new and
unusual, inasmuch as this is our condition, which the Lord has assigned
to us. For this manner of expression — *we are appointed to it* — is as
though he had said, that we are Christians on this condition. He says,
however, that they *know* it, because it became them to fight the more
bravely,  <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md) inasmuch as they had
been forewarned in time. In addition to this, incessant afflictions made
Paul contemptible among rude and ignorant persons. On this account he
states that nothing had befallen him but what he had long before, in the
manner of a prophet, foretold.

<span id="vi.v.i-p23"></span><span id="vi.v.i-p23.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.i-p24"></span>**5** *Lest perhaps the tempter has tempted
you*. By this term he teaches us that temptations are always to be
dreaded, because it is the proper office of Satan to *tempt*. As,
however, he never ceases to place ambushes for us on all sides, and to
lay snares for us all around, so we must be on our watch, eagerly taking
heed. And now he says openly what in the outset he had avoided saying,
as being too harsh — that he had felt concerned lest his *labors* should
be *vain*, if, peradventure, Satan should prevail. And this he does that
they may be carefully upon their watch, and may stir themselves up the
more vigorously to resistance.

<span id="vi.v.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p1"></span><span id="vi.v.ii-p1.1"></span>[1
Thessalonians 3:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.v.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p2"></span>**6**. But now when Timotheus came from you
unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that
ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we
also *to see* you:

<span id="vi.v.ii-p3"></span>**6**. Nuper autem quum venisset Timotheus
ad nos a vobis, et annuntiasset nobis fidem et dilectionem vestram, et
quod bonam nostri memoriam habetis semper, desiderantes nos videre,
quemadmodum et nos ipsi vos:

<span id="vi.v.ii-p4"></span>**7**. Therefore, brethren, we were
comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:

<span id="vi.v.ii-p5"></span>**7**. Inde consolationem percepimus
fratres de vobis, in omni tribulatione et necessitate nostra per vestram
fidem:

<span id="vi.v.ii-p6"></span>**8**. For now we live, if ye stand fast in
the Lord.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p7"></span>**8**. Quia nunc vivimus, si vos stasis in
Domino.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p8"></span>**9**. For what thanks can we render to God
again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before
our God;

<span id="vi.v.ii-p9"></span>**9**. Quam enim gratiarum actionem
possumus Deo reddere de vobis, in omni gaudio quod gaudemus propter vos
coram Deo nostro;

<span id="vi.v.ii-p10"></span>**10**. Night and day praying exceedingly
that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in
your faith?

<span id="vi.v.ii-p11"></span>**10**. Nocte ac die supra modum
precantes, ut videamus faciem vestram, et suppleamus quae fidei vestrae
desunt?

<span id="vi.v.ii-p12"></span> 

<span id="vi.v.ii-p13"></span><span id="vi.v.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p14"></span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p15"></span>He shews here, by another argument, by
what an extraordinary affection he was actuated towards them, inasmuch
as he was transported almost out of his senses by the joyful
intelligence of their being in a prosperous condition. For we must take
notice of the circumstances which he relates. He was in *affliction* and
*necessity:* there might have seemed, therefore, no room for
cheerfulness. But when he hears what was much desired by him respecting
the Thessalonians, as though all feeling of his distresses had been
extinguished, he is carried forward to joy and congratulation. At the
same time he proceeds, by degrees, in expressing the greatness of his
joy, for he says, in the *first* place, *we received consolation:*
afterwards he speaks of a joy that was plentifully poured forth.  <span
id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) This congratulation,  <span
id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) however, has the force of an
exhortation; and Paul’s intention was to stir up the Thessalonians to
perseverance. And, assuredly, this must have been a most powerful
excitement, when they learned that the holy Apostle felt so great
consolation and joy from the advancement of their piety.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p18"></span>**6** *Faith and love*. This form of
expression should be the more carefully observed by us in proportion to
the frequency with which it is made use of by Paul, for in these two
words he comprehends briefly the entire sum of true piety. Hence all
that aim at this twofold mark during their whole life are beyond all
risk of erring: all others, however much they may torture themselves,
wander miserably. The third thing that he adds as to their *good
remembrance* of him, refers to respect entertained for the Gospel. For
it was on no other account that they held Paul in such affection and
esteem.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p19"></span><span id="vi.v.ii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p20"></span>**8** *For now we live*. Here it appears
still more clearly that Paul almost forgot himself for the sake of the
Thessalonians, or, at least, making regard for himself a mere secondary
consideration, devoted his first and chief thoughts to them. At the same
time he did not do that so much from affection to men as from a desire
for the Lord’s glory. For zeal for God and Christ glowed in his holy
breast to such a degree that it in a manner swallowed up all other
anxieties. “*We live*,” says he, that is, “we are in good health, *if
you persevere in the Lord*.” And under the adverb *now*, he repeats what
he had formerly stated, that he had been greatly pressed down by
*affliction* and *necessity;* yet he declares that whatever evil he
endures in his own person does not hinder his joy. “Though in myself I
am dead, yet in your welfare I *live*.” By this all pastors are
admonished what sort of connection ought to subsist between them and the
Church — that they reckon themselves happy when it goes well with the
Church, although they should be in other respects encompassed with many
miseries, and, on the other hand, that they pine away with grief and
sorrow if they see the building which they have constructed in a state
of decay, although matters otherwise should be joyful and prosperous.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p21"></span><span id="vi.v.ii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p22"></span>**9** *For what thanksgiving*. Not
satisfied with a simple affirmation, he intimates how extraordinary is
the greatness of his joy, by asking himself *what thanks he can render
to God;* for by speaking thus he declares that he cannot find an
expression of gratitude that can come up to the measure of his joy. He
says that he rejoices *before God*, that is, truly and without any
pretense.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p23"></span><span id="vi.v.ii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p24"></span>**10** *Praying beyond measure*. He
returns to an expression of his *desire*. For it is never allowable for
us to congratulate men, while they live in this world, in such
unqualified terms as not always to desire something better for them. For
they are as yet in the way: they may fall back, or go astray, or even go
back. Hence Paul is desirous to have opportunity given him of *supplying
what is wanting in the faith* of the Thessalonians, or, which is the
same thing, completing in all its parts their faith, which was as yet
imperfect. Yet this is the faith which he had previously extolled
marvelously. But from this we infer, that those who far surpass others
are still far distant from the goal. Hence, whatever progress we may
have made, let us always keep in view our *deficiencies*, (<span
id="vi.v.ii-p24.1"></span>ὑστερήματα,)  <span
id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md) that we may not be reluctant to aim at
something farther.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p26"></span>From this also it appears how necessary it
is for us to give careful attention to doctrine, for teachers  <span
id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md) were not appointed merely with the
view of leading men, in the course of a single day or month, to the
faith of Christ, but for the purpose of perfecting the faith which has
been begun. But as to Paul’s claiming for himself what he elsewhere
declares belongs peculiarly to the Holy Spirit, (<span
id="vi.v.ii-p27.2"></span>[1Co
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#014)<span id="vi.v.ii-p27.2"></span>.md)
this must be restricted to the ministry. Now, as the ministry of a man
is inferior to the efficacy of the Spirit, and to use the common
expression, is subordinate to it, nothing is detracted from it. When he
says that he prayed *night and day beyond all ordinary measure*,  <span
id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560.md) we may gather from these words how
assiduous he was in praying to God, and with what ardor and earnestness
he discharged that duty.

<span id="vi.v.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p1"></span><span id="vi.v.iii-p1.1"></span>[1
Thessalonians 3:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/th1003.htm#011.md)<span
id="vi.v.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p2"></span>**11**. Now God himself and our Father,
and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p3"></span>**11**. Ipse autem Deus et Pater noster,
et Dominus noster Iesus Christus viam nostram ad vos dirigat.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p4"></span>**12**. And the Lord make you to increase
and abound in love one toward another, and toward all *men*, even as we
*do* toward you:

<span id="vi.v.iii-p5"></span>**12**. Vos autem Dominus impleat et
abundare faciat caritate mutua inter vos et erga omnes: quemadmodum et
nos ipsi affecti sumus erga vos:

<span id="vi.v.iii-p6"></span>**13**. To the end he may stablish your
hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p7"></span>**13**. Ut confirmet corda vestra
irreprehensibilia, in sanctitate coram Deo et Patre nostro, in adventu
Domini nostri Iesu Christi, cum omnibus sanctis eius.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p8"></span> 

<span id="vi.v.iii-p9"></span><span id="vi.v.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p10"></span>**11** *Now God himself*. He now prays
that the Lord, having removed Satan’s obstructions, may open a door for
himself, and be, as it were, the leader and director of his way to the
Thessalonians. By this he intimates, that we cannot move a step with
success,  <span id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561.md) otherwise than under
God’s guidance, but that when he holds out his hand, it is to no purpose
that Satan employs every effort to change the direction of our course.
We must take notice that he assigns the same office to God and to
Christ, as, unquestionably, the Father confers no blessing upon us
except through Christ’s hand. When, however, he thus speaks of both in
the same terms, he teaches that Christ has divinity and power in common
with the Father.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p12"></span><span id="vi.v.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p13"></span>**12** *And the Lord fill you*. Here we
have another prayer — that in the mean time, while his way is
obstructed, the Lord, during his absence, may confirm the Thessalonians
in holiness, and fill them with love. And from this again we learn in
what the perfection of the Christian life consists — in love and pure
holiness of heart, flowing from faith. He recommends love mutually
cherished *towards each other*, and afterwards *towards all*, for as it
is befitting that a commencement should be made with those that are of
the *household of faith*, (<span id="vi.v.iii-p13.1"></span>[Ga
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010)<span id="vi.v.iii-p13.1"></span>.md)
so our love ought to go forth to the whole human race. Farther, as the
nearer connection must be cherished,  <span
id="fr_562"></span>[563](#fn_562.md) so we must not overlook those who are
farther removed from us, so as to prevent them from holding their proper
place.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p15"></span>He would have the Thessalonians abound in
love and be filled with it, because in so far as we make progress in
acquaintance with God, the love of the brethren must at the same time
increase in us, until it take possession of our whole heart, the corrupt
love of self being extirpated. He prays that the love of the
Thessalonians may be perfected by God, intimating that its increase, no
less than its commencement, was from God alone. Hence it is evident how
preposterous a part those act who measure our strength by the precepts
of the Divine law. *The end of the law is love*, says Paul, (<span
id="vi.v.iii-p15.1"></span>[1Ti
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005)<span id="vi.v.iii-p15.1"></span>.md)
yet he himself declares that it is a work of God. When, therefore, God
marks out our life,  <span id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563.md) he does not
look to what we can do, but requires from us what is above our strength,
that we may learn to ask from him power to accomplish it. When he says —
*as we also towards you*, he stimulates them by his own example.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p17"></span><span id="vi.v.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p18"></span>**13** *That he may confirm your hearts*.
He employs the term *hearts* here to mean *conscience*, or the innermost
part of the soul; for he means that a man is acceptable to God only when
he brings holiness of heart; that is, not merely external, but also
internal. But it is asked, whether by means of holiness we stand at
God’s judgment-seat, for if so, to what purpose is remission of sins?
Yet Paul’s words seem to imply this — that their consciences might be
*irreproveable in holiness*. I answer, that Paul does not exclude
remission of sins, through which it comes that our holiness, which is
otherwise mixed up with many pollutions, bears God’s eye, for faith, by
which God is pacified towards us, so as to pardon our faults,  <span
id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564.md) precedes everything else, as the
foundation comes before the building. Paul, however, does not teach us
what or how great the holiness of believers may be, but desires that it
may be increased, until it attain its perfection. On this account he
says — *at the coming of our Lord*, meaning that the completion of those
things, which the Lord now begins in us, is delayed till that time.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p20"></span>*With all his saints*. This clause may be
explained in two ways, either as meaning that the Thessalonians, *with
all saints*, may have pure hearts at Christ’s coming, or that Christ
will come with *all his saints*. While I adopt this second meaning, in
so far as concerns the construction of the words, I have at the same
time no doubt that Paul employed the term *saints* for the purpose of
admonishing us that we are called by Christ for this end—that we may be
gathered *with all his saints*. For this consideration ought to whet our
desire for holiness.
