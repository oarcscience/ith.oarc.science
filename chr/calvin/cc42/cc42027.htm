<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p8"></A><b>1</b> <i>Now I beseech you, by the coming</i>. It may indeed be read, as I have noted on the margin, <i>concerning the coming</i>, but it suits better to view it as an earnest entreaty, taken from the subject in hand, just as in <a name="vii.iv.i-p8.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#031">1Co 15:31</a><a name="vii.iv.i-p8.1"></A>, when discoursing as to the hope of a resurrection, he makes use of an oath by that <i>glory</i> which is to be hoped for by believers. And this has much more efficacy when he adjures believers by the coming of Christ, not to imagine rashly that his day is at hand, for he at the same time admonishes us not to think of it but with 		reverence and sobriety. For it is customary to adjure by those things which are regarded by us with reverence. The meaning therefore is, &#8220;As you set a high value on the coming of Christ, when he will gather us to himself, and will truly perfect that unity of the body which we cherish as yet only in part through means of faith, so I earnestly beseech you by his coming not to be too credulous, should any one affirm, on whatever pretext, that his day is at hand.&#8221;</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p9"></A>As he had in his former Epistle adverted to some extent to the resurrection, it is possible that some fickle and fanatical persons took occasion from this to mark out a near and fixed day. For it is not likely that this error had taken its rise earlier among the Thessalonians. For Timothy, on returning thence, had informed Paul as to their entire condition, and as a prudent and experienced man had omitted nothing that was 		of importance. Now if Paul had received notice of it, he could not have been silent as to a matter of so great consequence. Thus I am of opinion, that when Paul&#8217;s Epistle had been read, which contained a lively view of the resurrection, some that were disposed to indulge curiosity philosophized unseasonably as to the time of it. This, however, was an utterly ruinous fancy,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_635"></A><A HREF="#fn_635"><FONT SIZE="1">636</FONT></A>
 		 as were also other things of the same nature, which were afterwards disseminated, not without artifice on the part of Satan. For when any day is said to be <i>near</i>, if it does not quickly arrive, mankind being naturally impatient of longer delay, their spirits begin to languish, and that languishing is followed up shortly afterwards by despair.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p11"></A>This, therefore, was Satan&#8217;s subtlety: as he could not openly overturn the hope of a resurrection with the view of secretly undermining it, as if by pits underground,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_636"></A><A HREF="#fn_636"><FONT SIZE="1">637</FONT></A>
 		he promised that the day of it would be near, and would soon arrive. Afterwards, too, he did not cease to contrive various things, with the view of effacing, by little and little, the belief of a resurrection from the minds of men, as he could not openly eradicate it. It is, indeed, a plausible thing to say that the day of our redemption is definitely fixed, and on this account it meets with applause on the part of the multitude, as we see that the dreams of Lactantius and the 		Chiliasts of old gave much delight, and yet they had no other tendency than that of overthrowing the hope of a resurrection. This was not the design of Lactantius, but Satan, in accordance with his subtlety, perverted his curiosity, and that of those like him, so as to leave nothing in religion definite or fixed, and even at the present day he does not cease to employ the same means. We now see how necessary Paul&#8217;s admonition was, as but for this all religion would have been overturned among 		the Thessalonians under a specious pretext.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iv.i-p13"></A><a name="vii.iv.i-p13.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p14"></A><b>2</b> <i> That ye be not soon shaken in judgment</i>. He employs the term <i>judgment</i> to denote that settled faith which rests on sound doctrine. Now, by means of that fancy which he rejects, they would have been carried away as it were into ecstasy. He notices, also, 		three kinds of imposture, as to which they must be on their guard &#8212; <i>spirit, word</i>, and <i>spurious epistle</i>. By the term <i>spirit</i> he means pretended prophecies, and it appears that this mode of speaking was common among the pious, so that they applied the term <i>spirit</i> to prophesyings, with the view of 		putting honor upon them. For, in order that prophecies may have due authority, we must look to the Spirit of God rather than to men. But as the devil is wont to <i>transform himself into an angel of light</i>, (<a name="vii.iv.i-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014">2Co 11:14</a><a name="vii.iv.i-p14.1"></A>,) impostors stole this title, in order that they might impose upon the simple. But although Paul could 		have stripped them of this mask, he, nevertheless, preferred to speak in this manner, by way of concession, as though he had said, &#8220;However they may pretend to have the spirit of revelation, believe them not.&#8221; John, in like manner, says:</p>  	 
<p class="Center"><a name="vii.iv.i-p15"></A>&#8220;Try the spirits, whether they are of God.&#8221; (<a name="vii.iv.i-p15.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001">1Jo 4:1</a><a name="vii.iv.i-p15.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p16"></A><i>Speech</i>, in my opinion, includes every kind of doctrine, while false teachers insist in the way of reasons or conjectures, or other pretexts. What he adds as to <i>epistle</i>, is an evidence that this impudence is ancient &#8212; that of feigning the names of others.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_637"></A><A HREF="#fn_637"><FONT SIZE="1">638</FONT></A>
 		 So much the more wonderful is the mercy of God towards us, in that while Paul&#8217;s name was on false grounds made use of in spurious writings, his writings have, nevertheless, been preserved entire even to our times. This, unquestionably, could not have taken place accidentally, or as the effect of mere human industry, if God himself had not by his power restrained Satan and all his ministers.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p18"></A><i>As if the day of Christ were at hand</i>. This may seem to be at variance with many passages of Scripture, in which the Spirit declares that that day is at hand. But the solution is easy, for it is <i>at hand </i>with regard to God, with whom <i>one day is as a thousand years</i>. (<a name="vii.iv.i-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#008">2Pe 3:8</a><a name="vii.iv.i-p18.1"></A>.) In the mean time, the Lord would have us be constantly waiting for him in such a way as not to limit him to a certain time.</p>  	 
<p class="Center"><a name="vii.iv.i-p19"></A>Watch, says he, for ye know neither the day nor the hour. <br> 		(<a name="vii.iv.i-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#036">Mt 24:36</a><a name="vii.iv.i-p19.2"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p20"></A>On the other hand, those false prophets whom Paul exposes, while they ought to have kept men&#8217;s minds in suspense, bid them feel assured of his speedy advent, that they might not be wearied out with the irksomeness of delay.</p>  <a name="vii.iv.ii"></A>  	  		 		     		  
<p class="TableCaption16"><a name="vii.iv.ii-p1"></A><a name="vii.iv.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a><a name="vii.iv.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 		    		 		     		  
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p2"></A><b>3</b>. Let no man deceive you by any means: for <i>that day shall not come</i>, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</p>

<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p8"></A><b>3</b> <i> Let no man deceive you</i>. That they may not groundlessly promise themselves the arrival in so short a time of the joyful day of redemption, he presents to them a melancholy prediction as to the future scattering of the Church. This discourse entirely corresponds with that which Christ held in the 		presence of his disciples, when they had asked him respecting the end of the world. For he exhorts them to prepare themselves for enduring hard conflicts,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_638"></A><A HREF="#fn_638"><FONT SIZE="1">639</FONT></A>
 		 (<a name="vii.iv.ii-p9.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006">Mt 24:6</a><a name="vii.iv.ii-p9.2"></A>,) and after he has discoursed of the most grievous and previously unheard of calamities, by which the earth was to be reduced almost to a desert, he adds, that the <i>end is not yet</i>, but that <i>these things are the beginnings of sorrows</i>. In the 		same way, Paul declares that believers must exercise warfare for a long period, before gaining a triumph.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p10"></A>We have here, however, a remarkable passage, and one that is in the highest degree worthy of observation. This was a grievous and dangerous temptation, which might shake even the most confirmed, and make them lose their footing &#8212; to see the Church, which had by means of such labors been raised up gradually and with difficulty to some considerable standing, fall down suddenly, as if torn down by a tempest. Paul, accordingly, fortifies 		beforehand the minds, not merely of the Thessalonians, but of all the pious, that when the Church should come to be in a scattered condition, they might not be alarmed, as though it were a thing that was new and unlooked for.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p11"></A>As, however, interpreters have twisted this passage in various ways, we must first of all endeavor to ascertain Paul&#8217;s true meaning. He says that the day of Christ will not come, until the world has fallen into apostasy, and the reign of Antichrist has obtained a footing in the Church; for as to the exposition that some have given of this passage, as referring to the downfall of the Roman empire, it is too silly to require a lengthened 		refutation. I am also surprised, that so many writers, in other respects learned and acute, have fallen into a blunder in a matter that is so easy, were it not that when one has committed a mistake, others follow in troops without consideration. Paul, therefore, employs the term <i>apostasy</i> to mean &#8212; a treacherous departure from God, and that not on the part of one or a few individuals, but such as would spread itself far and wide among a large multitude of persons. For when <i>apostasy</i> 		is made mention of without anything being added, it cannot be restricted to a few. Now, none can be termed <i>apostates</i>, but such as have previously made a profession of Christ and the gospel. Paul, therefore, predicts a certain general revolt of the visible Church. &#8220;The Church must be reduced to an unsightly and dreadful state of ruin, before its full restoration be effected.&#8221;</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p12"></A>From this we may readily gather, how useful this prediction of Paul is, for it might have seemed as though that could not be a building of God, that was suddenly overthrown, and lay so long in ruins, had not Paul long before intimated that it would be so. Nay more, many in the present day, when they consider with themselves the long-continued dispersion of the Church, begin to waver, as if this had not been regulated by the purpose of 		God. The Romanists, also, with the view of justifying the tyranny of their idol, make use of this pretext &#8212; that it was not possible that Christ would forsake his spouse. The weak, however, have something here on which to rest, when they learn that the unseemly state of matters which they behold in the Church was long since foretold; while, on the other hand, the impudence of the Romanists is openly exposed, inasmuch as Paul declares that a revolt will come, when the world has been brought 		under Christ&#8217;s authority. Now, we shall see presently, why it is that the Lord has permitted the Church, or at least what appeared to be such, to fall off in so shameful a manner.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p13"></A><i>Has been revealed</i>. It was no better than an old wife&#8217;s fable that was contrived respecting Nero, that he was carried up from the world, destined to return again to harass the Church   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_639"></A><A HREF="#fn_639"><FONT SIZE="1">640</FONT></A>
 		 by his tyranny; and yet the minds of the ancients were so bewitched, that they imagined that Nero would be Antichrist.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_640"></A><A HREF="#fn_640"><FONT SIZE="1">641</FONT></A>
 		 Paul, however, does not speak of one individual, but of a kingdom, that was to be taken possession of by Satan, that he might set up a seat of abomination in the midst of God&#8217;s temple &#8212; which we see accomplished in Popery. The revolt, it is true, has spread more widely, for Mahomet, as he was an apostate, turned away the Turks, his followers, from Christ. All heretics have broken the unity of the Church by their sects, and thus there have been a corresponding 		number of revolts from Christ.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p16"></A>Paul, however, when he has given warning that there would be such a scattering, that the greater part would revolt from Christ, adds something more serious &#8212; that there would be such a confusion, that the vicar of Satan would hold supreme power in the Church, and would preside there in the place of God. Now he describes that reign of abomination under the name of a single person, because it is only one reign, though one succeeds another. 		My readers now understand, that all the sects by which the Church has been lessened from the beginning, have been so many streams of revolt which began to draw away the water from the right course, but that the sect of Mahomet was like a violent bursting forth of water, that took away about the half of the Church by its violence. It remained, also, that Antichrist should infect the remaining part with his poison. Thus, we see with our own eyes, that this memorable prediction of Paul has been 		confirmed by the event.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p17"></A>In the exposition which I bring forward, there is nothing forced. Believers in that age dreamed that they would be transported to heaven, after having endured troubles during a short period. Paul, however, on the other hand, foretells that, after they have had foreign enemies for some time molesting them, they will have more evils to endure from enemies at home, inasmuch as many of those that have made a profession of attachment to 		Christ would be hurried away into base treachery, and inasmuch as the temple of God itself would be polluted by sacrilegious tyranny, so that Christ&#8217;s greatest enemy would exercise dominion there. The term <i>revelation</i> is taken here to denote manifest possession of tyranny, as if Paul had said that the day of Christ would not come until this tyrant had openly manifested himself, and had, as it were, designedly overturned the whole order of the Church.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iv.ii-p18"></A><a name="vii.iv.ii-p18.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p19"></A><b>4</b> <i>An adversary, and that exalteth himself</i>. The two epithets &#8212; <i>man of sin</i>, and <i>son of perdition</i> &#8212; intimate, in the first place, how dreadful the confusion would be, that the unseemliness of it might not 		discourage weak minds; and farther, they tend to stir up the pious to a feeling of detestation, lest they should degenerate along with others. Paul, however, now draws, as if in a picture, a striking likeness of Antichrist; for it may be easily gathered from these words what is the nature of his kingdom, and in what things it consists. For, when he calls him an <i>adversary</i>, when he says that he will claim for himself those things which belong to 		God, so that he is worshipped in the temple as God, he places his kingdom in direct opposition to the kingdom of Christ. Hence, as the kingdom of Christ is spiritual, so this tyranny must be upon souls, that it may rival the kingdom of Christ. We shall also find him afterwards assigning to him the power of deceiving, by means of wicked doctrines and pretended miracles. If, accordingly, you would know Antichrist, you must view him as diametrically opposed to Christ.<b> 		</b>  		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_641"></A><A HREF="#fn_641"><FONT SIZE="1">642</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p21"></A>Where I have rendered &#8212; <i>everything that is called God</i>, the reading more generally received among the Greeks is, <i>every one that is called</i>. It may, however, be conjectured, both from the old translation   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_642"></A><A HREF="#fn_642"><FONT SIZE="1">643</FONT></A>
 		 and from some Greek commentaries, that Paul&#8217;s words have been corrupted. The mistake, too, of a single letter was readily fallen into, especially when the shape of the letter was much similar; for, where there was written <a name="vii.iv.ii-p22.2"></A>&#960;&#8118;&#957; &#964;&#8056;, (<i>everything</i>,) some transcriber, or too daring reader, turned it into <a name="vii.iv.ii-p22.3"></A>&#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#945;, (<i>every one</i>.) This difference, however, is not of so much importance as to the sense, for Paul undoubtedly means that Antichrist would take to himself those things that belonged to God alone, so that he would <i>exalt himself</i> above every divine claim, that all religion and all worship of God might lie under his 		feet. This expression then, <i>everything that is reckoned to be God</i>, is equivalent to <i>everything that is reckoned as Divinity</i>, and <a name="vii.iv.ii-p22.4"></A>&#963;&#8051;&#946;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#945;, that is, in which the veneration due to God consists.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p23"></A>Here, however, the subject treated of is not the name of God himself, but his majesty and worship, and, in general, everything that he claims for himself. &#8220;True religion is that by which the true God alone is worshipped; <i>that</i>, the <i>son of perdition </i>will transfer to himself.&#8221; Now, 		every one that has learned from Scripture what are the things that more especially belong to God, and will, on the other hand, observe what the Pope claims for himself &#8212; though he were but a boy of ten years of age &#8212; will have no great difficulty in recognizing Antichrist. Scripture declares that God is the <i>alone Lawgiver </i>(<a name="vii.iv.ii-p23.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012">Jas 4:12</a><a name="vii.iv.ii-p23.1"></A>) 		<i>who is able to save and to destroy;</i> the alone King, whose office it is to govern souls by his word. It represents him as the author of all sacred rites;   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_643"></A><A HREF="#fn_643"><FONT SIZE="1">644</FONT></A>
 		 it teaches that righteousness and salvation are to be sought from Christ alone; and it assigns, at the same time, the manner and means. There is not one of these things that the Pope does not affirm to be under his authority. He boasts that it is his to bind consciences with such laws as seem good to him, and subject them to everlasting punishment. As to sacraments, he either institutes new ones, according to his own inclination,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_644"></A><A HREF="#fn_644"><FONT SIZE="1">645</FONT></A>
 		 or he corrupts and deforms those which had been instituted by Christ &#8212; nay, sets them aside altogether, that he may substitute in their place the sacrileges   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_645"></A><A HREF="#fn_645"><FONT SIZE="1">646</FONT></A>
 		 which he has invented. He contrives means of attaining salvation that are altogether at variance with the doctrine of the Gospel; and, in fine, he does not hesitate to change the whole of religion at his own pleasure. What is it, I pray you, for one to lift up himself above everything that is reckoned God, if the Pope does not do so? When he thus robs God of his honor, he leaves him nothing remaining but an empty title of Deity,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_646"></A><A HREF="#fn_646"><FONT SIZE="1">647</FONT></A>
 		 while he transfers to himself the whole of his power. And this is what Paul adds shortly afterwards, that <i>the son of perdition would shew himself as God</i>. For, as has been said, he does not insist upon the simple term <i>God</i>, but intimates, that the pride   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_647"></A><A HREF="#fn_647"><FONT SIZE="1">648</FONT></A>
 		 of Antichrist would be such, that, raising himself above the number and rank of servants, and mounting the judgment-seat of God,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_648"></A><A HREF="#fn_648"><FONT SIZE="1">649</FONT></A>
 		 would reign, not with a human, but with a divine authority. For we know that whatever is raised up into the place of God is an idol, though it should not bear the name of God.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.ii-p30"></A><i>In the temple of God</i>. By this one term there is a sufficient refutation of the error, nay more, the stupidity of those who reckon the Pope to be Vicar of Christ, on the ground that he has his seat in the Church, in whatever manner he may conduct himself; for Paul places Antichrist nowhere else than in the very sanctuary of God. For this is not a 		foreign, but a domestic enemy, who opposes Christ under the very name of Christ. But it is asked, how the Church is represented as the den of so many superstitions, while it was destined to be the <i>pillar of the truth?</i> (<a name="vii.iv.ii-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015">1Ti 3:15</a><a name="vii.iv.ii-p30.1"></A>.) I answer, that it is thus represented, not on the ground of its retaining all the qualities of the 		Church, but because it has something of it remaining. I accordingly acknowledge, that that is the <i>temple of God </i>in which the Pope bears rule, but at the same time profaned by innumerable sacrileges.</p>  <a name="vii.iv.iii"></A>

And as he had given them early warning as to the reign of Antichrist, and 		the devastation that was coming upon the Church, when no question had as yet been raised as to such things, he saw beyond all doubt that the doctrine was specially useful to be known. And, unquestionably, it is really so. Those whom he addressed were destined to see many things that would trouble them; and when posterity would see a large proportion of those who had made profession of the faith of Christ revolt from piety, maddened, as it were, by a gad-fly, or rather by a fury,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_649"></A><A HREF="#fn_649"><FONT SIZE="1">650</FONT></A>

 		 was worthy of such vengeance. Here we may see how forgetful men are in matters affecting their everlasting salvation. We must also observe Paul&#8217;s mildness; for while he might have been vehemently incensed,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_653"></A><A HREF="#fn_653"><FONT SIZE="1">654</FONT></A>

Chrysostom, who thinks that this can only be understood as referring to the Spirit, or to the Roman Empire, prefers to lean to the 		latter opinion. He assigns a plausible reason &#8212; because Paul would not have spoken of the Spirit in enigmatical terms,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_654"></A><A HREF="#fn_654"><FONT SIZE="1">655</FONT></A>
 		 but in speaking of the Roman Empire wished to avoid exciting unpleasant feeling. He states also the reason why the state of the Roman Empire retards the revelation of Antichrist &#8212; that, as the monarchy of Babylon was overthrown by the Persians and Medes, and the Macedonians, having conquered the Persians, again took possession of the monarchy, and the Macedonians were at last subdued by the Romans, so Antichrist seized hold for himself of the vacant supremacy of 		the Roman Empire. There is not one of these things that was not afterwards confirmed by actual occurrence. Chrysostom, therefore, speaks truly in so far as concerns history. I am of opinion, however, that Paul&#8217;s intention was different from this &#8212; that the doctrine of the gospel would require to be spread hither and thither, until nearly the whole world were convicted of obstinacy and deliberate malice. For there can be no doubt that the Thessalonians had heard from Paul&#8217;s mouth as to this 		impediment, of whatever sort it was, for he recalls to their remembrance what he had previously taught in their presence.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p21"></A>Let my readers now consider which of the two is the more probable &#8212; either that Paul declared that the light of the gospel must be diffused through all parts of the earth before God would thus give loose reins to Satan, or that the power of the Roman Empire stood in the way of the rise of Antichrist, inasmuch as he could only break through into a vacant possession. I seem at least to hear Paul discoursing as to the 		universal call of the Gentiles &#8212; that the grace of God must be offered to all &#8212; that Christ must enlighten the whole world by his gospel, in order that the impiety of men might be the more fully attested and demonstrated. This, therefore, was the delay, until the career of the gospel should be completed, because a gracious invitation to salvation was first in order.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_655"></A><A HREF="#fn_655"><FONT SIZE="1">656</FONT></A>
 		 Hence he adds, <i>in his time</i>, because vengeance was ripe after grace had been rejected.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_656"></A><A HREF="#fn_656"><FONT SIZE="1">657</FONT></A>

<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p25"></A><b>7</b><i>. The mystery of iniquity</i>. This is opposed to <i>revelation;</i> for as Satan had not yet gathered so much strength, as that Antichrist could openly oppress the Church, he says that he is carrying on secretly and clandestinely   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_657"></A><A HREF="#fn_657"><FONT SIZE="1">658</FONT></A>
 		 what he would do openly in his own time. He was therefore at that time secretly laying the foundations on which he would afterwards rear the edifice, as actually took place. And this tends to confirm more fully what I have already stated, that it is not one individual that is represented under the term Antichrist, but one kingdom, which extends itself through many ages. In the same sense, John says that Antichrist will come, but that there were already many in his 		time. (<a name="vii.iv.iii-p26.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018">1Jo 2:18</a><a name="vii.iv.iii-p26.2"></A>.) For he admonishes those who were then living to be on their guard against that deadly pestilence, which was at that time shooting up in various forms. For sects were rising up which were the seeds, as it were, of that unhappy weed which has well-nigh choked and destroyed God&#8217;s entire tillage.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_658"></A><A HREF="#fn_658"><FONT SIZE="1">659</FONT></A>
 		 But although Paul conveys the idea of a secret manner of working, yet he has made use of the term <i>mystery</i> rather than any other, alluding to the mystery of salvation, of which he speaks elsewhere, (<a name="vii.iv.iii-p27.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#026">Col 1:26</a><a name="vii.iv.iii-p27.2"></A>,) for he carefully insists on the struggle of repugnancy between the Son of God and 		this <i>son of perdition</i></p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p28"></A><i>Only now withholding</i>. While he makes both statements in reference to one person &#8212; that he will hold supremacy for a time, and that he will shortly be taken out of the way, I have no doubt that he refers to Antichrist; and the participle <i>withholding</i> must be explained in the future tense.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_659"></A><A HREF="#fn_659"><FONT SIZE="1">660</FONT></A>
 		 For he has, in my opinion, added this for the consolation of believers &#8212; that the reign of Antichrist will be temporary, the limits of it having been assigned to it by God; for believers might object &#8212; &#8220;Of what avail is it that the gospel is preached, if Satan is now hatching a tyranny that he is to exercise for ever?&#8221; He accordingly exhorts to patience, because God afflicts his Church only for a time, that he may one day afford it deliverance; and, on the other 		hand, the perpetuity of Christ&#8217;s reign must be considered, in order that believers may repose in it.</p>

For he had said that there was some hindrance in the way of Antichrist&#8217;s entering upon an open possession of the kingdom. He afterwards added, that he was already hatching a secret work of impiety. In the <i>third</i> place, he has interspersed 		consolation, on the ground that this tyranny would come to an end.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_660"></A><A HREF="#fn_660"><FONT SIZE="1">661</FONT></A>
 		 He now again repeats, that he   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_661"></A><A HREF="#fn_661"><FONT SIZE="1">662</FONT></A>

He had foretold the destruction of Antichrist&#8217;s reign; he now points out the manner of his destruction &#8212; that he will be reduced to nothing by the <i>word of the Lord</i>. It is uncertain, however, whether he speaks of the last appearance of Christ, when he will be manifested from heaven as 		the Judge. The words, indeed, seem to have this meaning, but Paul does not mean that Christ would accomplish this   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_664"></A><A HREF="#fn_664"><FONT SIZE="1">665</FONT></A>
 		 in one moment. Hence we must understand it in this sense &#8212; that Antichrist would be wholly and in every respect destroyed,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_665"></A><A HREF="#fn_665"><FONT SIZE="1">666</FONT></A>
 		 when that final day of the restoration of all things shall arrive. Paul, however, intimates that Christ will in the mean time, by the rays which he will emit previously to his advent, put to flight the darkness in which Antichrist will reign, just as the sun, before he is seen by us, chases away the darkness of the night by the pouring forth of his rays.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_666"></A><A HREF="#fn_666"><FONT SIZE="1">667</FONT></A>
</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p40"></A>This victory of the word, therefore, will shew itself in this world, for the <i>spirit of his mouth</i> simply means the word, as it also does in <a name="vii.iv.iii-p40.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#004">Isa 11:4</a><a name="vii.iv.iii-p40.1"></A>, to which passage Paul seems to 		allude. For the Prophet there takes in the same sense the <i>scepter of his mouth</i>, and the <i>breath of his lips</i>, and he also furnishes Christ with these very arms, that he may rout his enemies. This is a signal commendation of true and sound doctrine &#8212; that it is represented as sufficient for putting an end to all impiety, and as destined to be invariably victorious, in opposition to all the 		machinations of Satan; as also when, a little afterwards, the proclamation of it is spoken of as <i>Christ&#8217;s coming</i> to us.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iii-p41"></A>When Paul adds, the <i>brightness of his coming</i>, he intimates that the light of Christ&#8217;s presence will be such as will swallow up the darkness of Antichrist.

And, undoubtedly, that is a sad departure   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_667"></A><A HREF="#fn_667"><FONT SIZE="1">668</FONT></A>

<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p12"></A><b>9</b> <i>Whose coming</i> He confirms what he has said by an argument from contraries. For as Antichrist cannot stand otherwise than through the impostures of Satan, he must necessarily vanish as soon as Christ shines forth. In fine, as it is only in 		darkness that he reigns, the dawn of the day puts to flight and extinguishes the thick darkness of his reign. We are now in possession of Paul&#8217;s design, for he meant to say, that Christ would have no difficulty in destroying the tyranny of Antichrist, which was supported by no resources but those of Satan. In the mean time, however, he points out the marks by which that <i>wicked one </i>may be distinguished. For after having spoken of the <i>working</i> or <i>efficacy</i> of Satan, he marks it out particularly when he says, <i>in signs and lying wonders, and in all deceivableness</i>. And assuredly, in order that this may be opposed to the kingdom of Christ, it must consist partly in false doctrine and errors, and partly in pretended miracles. For the kingdom of Christ 		consists of the doctrine of truth, and the power of the Spirit. Satan, accordingly, with the view of opposing Christ in the person of his Vicar, puts on Christ&#8217;s mask,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_669"></A><A HREF="#fn_669"><FONT SIZE="1">670</FONT></A>
 		 while he, nevertheless, at the same time chooses armor, with which he may directly oppose Christ. Christ, by the doctrine of his gospel, enlightens our minds in eternal life; Antichrist, trained up under Satan&#8217;s tuition, by wicked doctrine, involves the wicked in ruin;   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_670"></A><A HREF="#fn_670"><FONT SIZE="1">671</FONT></A>
 		 Christ puts forth the power of his Spirit for salvation, and seals his gospel by miracles; the adversary,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_671"></A><A HREF="#fn_671"><FONT SIZE="1">672</FONT></A>
 		 by the efficacy of Satan, alienates us from the Holy Spirit, and by his enchantments confirms miserable men   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_672"></A><A HREF="#fn_672"><FONT SIZE="1">673</FONT></A>
 		 in error.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p17"></A>He gives the name of <i>miracles of falsehood</i>, not merely to such as are falsely and deceptively contrived by cunning men with a view to impose upon the simple &#8212; a kind of deception with which all Papacy abounds, for they are a part of his power which he has previously touched upon; but takes falsehood as consisting in this, that 		Satan draws to a contrary end works which otherwise are truly works of God, and abuses miracles so as to obscure God&#8217;s glory.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_673"></A><A HREF="#fn_673"><FONT SIZE="1">674</FONT></A>
 		 In the mean time, however, there can be no doubt, that he deceives by means of enchantments&#8212;an example of which we have in Pharaoh&#8217;s magicians. (<a name="vii.iv.iv-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#011">Ex 7:11</a><a name="vii.iv.iv-p18.1"></A>.)</p>

<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p20"></A><b>10</b> <i>In those that perish</i>. He limits the power of Satan, as not being able to injure the elect of God, just as Christ, also, exempts them from this danger. (<a name="vii.iv.iv-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#024">Mt 24:24</a><a name="vii.iv.iv-p20.1"></A>.) From this it 		appears, that Antichrist has not so great power otherwise than by his permission. Now, this consolation was necessary. For all the pious, but for this, would of necessity be overpowered with fear, if they saw a yawning gulf pervading the whole path, along which they must pass. Hence Paul, however he may wish them to be in a state of anxiety, that they may be on their guard, lest by excessive carelessness they should fall back, nay, even throw themselves into ruin, does, nevertheless, bid them 		cherish good hope, inasmuch as Satan&#8217;s power is bridled, that he may not be able to involve any but the wicked in ruin.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.iv-p21"></A><i>Because they received not the love</i>. Lest the wicked should complain that they perish innocently,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_674"></A><A HREF="#fn_674"><FONT SIZE="1">675</FONT></A>
 		 and that they have been appointed to death rather from cruelty on the part of God, than from any fault on their part, Paul shews on what good grounds it is that so severe vengeance from God is to come upon them &#8212; because they have not received in the temper of mind with which they ought the truth which was presented to them, nay more, of their own accord refused salvation. And from this appears more clearly what I have already stated &#8212; that the gospel required to 		be preached to the world before God would give Satan so much permission, for he would never have allowed his temple to be so basely profaned,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_675"></A><A HREF="#fn_675"><FONT SIZE="1">676</FONT></A>
 		 had he not been provoked by extreme ingratitude on the part of men. In short, Paul declares that Antichrist will be the minister of God&#8217;s righteous vengeance against those who, being called to salvation, have rejected the gospel, and have preferred to apply their mind to impiety and errors. Hence there is no reason why Papists should now object, that it is at variance with the clemency of Christ to cast off his Church in this manner. For though the domination of 		Antichrist has been cruel, none have perished but those who were deserving of it, nay more, did of their own accord <i>choose death</i>. (<a name="vii.iv.iv-p23.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#036">Pr 8:36</a><a name="vii.iv.iv-p23.2"></A>.) And unquestionably, while the voice of the Son of God has sounded forth everywhere, it finds the ears of men deaf, nay obstinate,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_676"></A><A HREF="#fn_676"><FONT SIZE="1">677</FONT></A>
 		 and while a profession of Christianity is common, there are, nevertheless, few that have truly and heartily given themselves to Christ. Hence it is not to be wondered, if similar vengeance quickly follows such a criminal   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_677"></A><A HREF="#fn_677"><FONT SIZE="1">678</FONT></A>

 		does not stand in the way of his striking down with stupidity,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_679"></A><A HREF="#fn_679"><FONT SIZE="1">680</FONT></A>
 		as often as seems good to him, those that have never heard a single word respecting Christ, for Paul does not discourse in a general way as to the reasons why God has from the beginning permitted Satan to go at large with his falsehoods, but as to what a horrible vengeance impends over gross despisers of new and previously unwonted grace.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_680"></A><A HREF="#fn_680"><FONT SIZE="1">681</FONT></A>

<p><a name="vii.iv.v-p8"></A><b>13</b> <i>But we are bound to give thanks</i>. He now separates more openly the Thessalonians from the reprobate, that their faith may not waver from fear of the revolt that was to take place. At the same time, he had it in view to consult, not <i>their</i> welfare only, but 		also that of posterity.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_683"></A><A HREF="#fn_683"><FONT SIZE="1">684</FONT></A>
 		 And he does not merely confirm them that they may not fall over the same precipice with the world, but by this comparison he extols the more the grace of God towards them, in that, while they see almost the whole world hurried forward to death at the same time, as if by a violent tempest, they are, by the hand of God, maintained in a quiet and secure condition of life.   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_684"></A><A HREF="#fn_684"><FONT SIZE="1">685</FONT></A>
 		 Thus we must contemplate the Judgments of God upon the reprobate in such a way that they may be, as it were, mirrors to us for considering his mercy towards us. For we must draw this conclusion, that it is owing solely to the singular grace of God that we do not miserably perish with them.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.v-p11"></A>He calls them <i>beloved of the Lord</i>, for this reason, that they may the better consider that the sole reason why they are exempted from the almost universal overthrow of the world, was because God exercised towards them unmerited love. Thus Moses admonished the Jews &#8212;</p>  	 
<p class="Center"><a name="vii.iv.v-p12"></A>&#8220;God did not elevate you so magnificently because ye were more powerful than others, or were numerous, but because he loved your fathers.&#8221; (<a name="vii.iv.v-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#007">De 7:7-8</a><a name="vii.iv.v-p12.1"></A>.)</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.v-p13"></A>For, when we hear the term <i>love</i>, that statement of John must immediately occur to our mind &#8212; <i>Not that we first loved him</i>. (<a name="vii.iv.v-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#019">1Jo 4:19</a><a name="vii.iv.v-p13.1"></A>.) In short, Paul here does two things; for he confirms faith, lest the pious should give way from being overcome with fear, and he exhorts them to gratitude, that they may value so much the higher the mercy 		of God towards them.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.v-p14"></A><i>Hath chosen you</i>. He states the reason why all are not involved and swallowed up in the same ruin &#8212; because Satan has no power over any that God has chosen, so as to prevent them from being saved, though heaven and earth were to be confounded. This passage is read in various ways.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.v-p15"></A>The old interpreter has rendered it <i>first-fruits</i>,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_685"></A><A HREF="#fn_685"><FONT SIZE="1">686</FONT></A>
 		 as being in the Greek <a name="vii.iv.v-p16.2"></A>&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#8053;&#957;; but as almost all the Greek manuscripts have <a name="vii.iv.v-p16.3"></A>&#945;&#960;&#8127; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8034;&#962;, I have in preference followed this reading. Should any one prefer <i>first-fruits</i>, the meaning will be, that believers have been, as it 		were, set aside for a sacred offering, by a metaphor taken from the ancient custom of the law. Let us, however, hold by what is more generally received, that he says that the Thessalonians were <i>chosen from the beginning</i></p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.v-p17"></A>Some understand the meaning to be, that they had been called among the first; but this is foreign to Paul&#8217;s meaning, and does not accord with the connection of the passage. For he does not merely exempt from fear a few individuals, who had been led to Christ immediately on the commencement of the gospel, but this consolation belongs to all the elect of God, without exception. When, therefore, he says <i>from the beginning</i>, he means that there is no danger lest their salvation, which is founded on God&#8217;s eternal election, should be overthrown, whatever tumultuous changes may occur. &#8220;However Satan may mix and confound all things in the world, your salvation, notwithstanding, has been placed on a footing of safety, prior to the creation of the world.&#8221; Here, therefore, is the true port of safety, that God, who elected us of old,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_686"></A><A HREF="#fn_686"><FONT SIZE="1">687</FONT></A>
 		 will deliver us from all the evils that threaten us. For we are elected to salvation; we shall, therefore, be safe from destruction. But as it is not for us to penetrate into God&#8217;s secret counsel, to seek <i>there</i> assurance of our salvation, he specifies signs or tokens of election, which should suffice us for the assurance of it.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.v-p19"></A><i>In sanctification of the spirit</i>, says he, <i>and belief of the truth</i>. This may be explained in two ways, <i>with sanctification</i>, or <i>by sanctification</i>. It is not of much importance which of the two you select, as it is certain   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_687"></A><A HREF="#fn_687"><FONT SIZE="1">688</FONT></A>
 		 that Paul meant simply to introduce, in connection with election, those nearer tokens which manifest to us what is in its own nature incomprehensible, and are conjoined with it by an indissoluble tie. Hence, in order that we may know that we are elected by God, there is no occasion to inquire as to what he decreed before the creation of the world, but we find in ourselves a satisfactory proof if he has sanctified us by his Spirit, &#8212; if he has enlightened us in the 		faith of his gospel. For the gospel is an evidence to us of our adoption, and the Spirit seals it, and those that are <i>led by the Spirit are the sons of God</i>, (<a name="vii.iv.v-p20.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#014">Ro 8:14</a><a name="vii.iv.v-p20.2"></A>,) and he who by faith possesses Christ has everlasting life. (<a name="vii.iv.v-p20.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#012">1Jo 5:12</a><a name="vii.iv.v-p20.3"></A>.) These things must be carefully observed, lest, overlooking the revelation of God&#8217;s will, with which he bids us rest satisfied, we should plunge into a profound labyrinth from a desire to take it from his secret counsel, from the investigation of which he draws us aside. Hence it becomes us to rest satisfied with the faith of the gospel, and that grace of the Spirit by which we have been regenerated. And by this means is refuted the wickedness   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_688"></A><A HREF="#fn_688"><FONT SIZE="1">689</FONT></A>
 		 of those who make the election of God a pretext for every kind of iniquity, while Paul connects it with faith and regeneration in such a manner, that he would not have it judged of by us on any other grounds.</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iv.v-p22"></A><a name="vii.iv.v-p22.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.v-p23"></A><b>14</b> <i> To which he called us</i>. He repeats the same thing, though in somewhat different terms. For the sons of God are not called otherwise than to the belief of the truth. Paul, however, meant to shew here how competent a witness he is for confirming that thing of which he was a minister. He accordingly puts 		himself forward as a surety, that the Thessalonians may not doubt that the gospel, in which they had been instructed by him, is the safety-bringing voice of God, by which they are aroused from death, and are delivered from the tyranny of Satan. He calls it <i>his</i> gospel, not as though it had originated with him,   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_689"></A><A HREF="#fn_689"><FONT SIZE="1">690</FONT></A>
 		 but inasmuch as the preaching of it had been committed to him.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.v-p25"></A>What he adds, <i>to the acquisition</i> or <i>possession of the glory of Christ</i>, may be taken either in an active or in a passive signification &#8212; either as meaning, that they are called in order that they may one day 		<i>possess</i> a glory in common with Christ, or that Christ <i>acquired</i> them with a view to his glory. And thus it will be a second means of confirmation that he will defend them, as being nothing less than his own inheritance, and, in maintaining their salvation, will stand forward in defense of his own glory; which latter meaning, in my opinion, suits better.</p>  <a name="vii.iv.vi"></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iv.vi-p9"></A><a name="vii.iv.vi-p9.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.vi-p10"></A>He deduces this exhortation on good grounds from what goes before, inasmuch as our steadfastness and power of perseverance rest on nothing else than assurance of divine grace. When, however, God calls us to salvation, stretching forth, as it were, his hand to us; when Christ, by the doctrine of the gospel, presents himself to us to be enjoyed; when the Spirit is given us as a seal and earnest of eternal life, though the heaven should 		fall, we must, nevertheless, not become disheartened. Paul, accordingly, would have the Thessalonians stand, not merely when others continue to stand, but with a more settled stability; so that, on seeing almost all turning aside from the faith, and all things full of confusion, they will, nevertheless, retain their footing. And assuredly the calling of God ought to fortify us against all occasions of offense in such a manner, that not even the entire ruin of the world shall shake, much less 		overthrow, our stability.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.vi-p11"></A><b>15</b> <i>Hold fast the institutions</i>. Some restrict this to precepts of external polity; but this does not please me, for he points out the manner of standing firm. Now, to be furnished with invincible strength is a much higher thing than external discipline. Hence, in my opinion, he includes all doctrine 		under this term, as though he had said that they have ground on which they may stand firm, provided they persevere in sound doctrine, according as they had been instructed by him. I do not deny that the term <a name="vii.iv.vi-p11.1"></A>&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#8057;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962; is fitly applied to the ordinances which are appointed by the Churches, with a view to the promoting of peace and the maintaining of order, and I admit that it is taken in this 		sense when human traditions are treated of, (<a name="vii.iv.vi-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#006">Mt 15:6</a><a name="vii.iv.vi-p11.2"></A>.) Paul, however, will be found in the next chapter making use of the term <i>tradition</i>, as meaning the rule that he had laid down, and the very signification of the term is general. The context, however, as I have said, requires that it be taken here to mean the whole of that 		doctrine in which they had been instructed. For the matter treated of is the most important of all &#8212; that their faith may remain secure in the midst of a dreadful agitation of the Church.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.vi-p12"></A>Papists, however, act a foolish part in gathering from this that their traditions ought to be observed. They reason, indeed, in this manner &#8212; that if it was allowable for Paul to enjoin traditions, it was allowable also for other teachers; and that, if it was a pious thing   		&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_690"></A><A HREF="#fn_690"><FONT SIZE="1">691</FONT></A>
 		 to observe the former, the latter also ought not less to be observed. Granting them, however, that Paul speaks of precepts belonging to the external government of the Church, I say that they were, nevertheless, not contrived by him, but divinely communicated. For he declares elsewhere, (<a name="vii.iv.vi-p13.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#035">1Co 7:35</a><a name="vii.iv.vi-p13.2"></A>,) that it was not his intention to ensnare 		consciences, as it was not lawful, either for himself, or for all the Apostles together. They act a still more ridiculous part in making it their aim to pass off, under this, the abominable sink of their own superstitions, as though they were the traditions of Paul. But farewell to these trifles, when we are in possession of Paul&#8217;s true meaning. And we may judge in part from this Epistle what traditions he here recommends, for he says &#8212; whether <i>by word</i>, that is, discourse, or <i>by epistle</i>. Now, what do these Epistles contain but pure doctrine, which overturns to the very foundation the whole of the Papacy, and every invention that is at variance with the simplicity of the Gospel?</p>  	 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iv.vi-p14"></A><a name="vii.iv.vi-p14.1"></A></p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.vi-p15"></A><b>16</b> <i> Now the Lord himself</i>. When he ascribes to Christ a work altogether Divine, and represents him, in common with the Father, as the Author of the choicest blessings, as we have in this a clear proof of the divinity of Christ, so we are admonished, that we cannot obtain anything from God unless we seek 		it in Christ himself: and when he asks that God may give him those things which he had enjoined, he shews clearly enough how little influence exhortations have, unless God inwardly move and affect our hearts. Unquestionably there will be but an empty sound striking upon the ear, if doctrine does not receive efficacy from the Spirit.</p>  	 
<p><a name="vii.iv.vi-p16"></A>What he afterwards adds,<i> who hath loved you, and hath given consolation</i>, <i>etc.</i>, relates to confidence in asking; for he would have the Thessalonians feel persuaded that God will do what he prays for. And from what does he prove this? Because he once shewed that they were dear to 		him, while he has already conferred upon them distinguished favors, and in this manner has bound himself to them for the time to come. This is what he means by <i>everlasting consolation</i>. The term <i>hope</i>, also, has the same object in view &#8212; that they may confidently expect a never-failing continuance of gifts. But 		what does he ask? That God may sustain their hearts by his consolation; for this is his office, to keep them from giving way through anxiety or distrust; and farther, that he may give them perseverance, both in a pious and holy course of life, and in sound doctrine; for I am of opinion, that it is rather of this than of common discourse that he speaks, so that this agrees with what goes before.</p>
