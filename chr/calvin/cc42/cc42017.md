<span id="vi.ii-p1"></span>ARGUMENT

<span id="vi.ii-p2"></span>ON

<span id="vi.ii-p3"></span>THE FIRST EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS.

<span id="vi.ii-p4"></span>The greater part of this Epistle consists of
exhortations. Paul had instructed the Thessalonians in the right faith.
On hearing, however, that persecutions were raging there,  <span
id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485) he had sent Timothy with the view of
animating them for the conflict, that they might not give way through
fear, as human infirmity is apt to do. Having been afterwards informed
by Timothy respecting their entire condition, he employs various
arguments to confirm them in steadfastness of faith, as well as in
patience, should they be called to endure anything for the testimony of
the gospel. These things he treats of in the *first three* Chapters.

<span id="vi.ii-p6"></span>In the beginning of the *Fourth* Chapter, he
exhorts them, in general terms, to holiness of life, afterwards he
recommends mutual benevolence, and all offices that flow from it.
Towards the end, however, he touches upon the question of the
resurrection, and explains in what way we shall all be raised up from
death. From this it is manifest, that there were some wicked or
light-minded persons, who endeavored to unsettle their faith by
unseasonably bringing forward many frivolous things.  <span
id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486) Hence with the view of cutting off all
pretext for foolish and needless disputations, he instructs them in few
words as to the views which they should entertain.

<span id="vi.ii-p8"></span>In the *Fifth* Chapter he prohibits them,
even more strictly, from inquiring as to *times*; but admonishes them to
be ever on the watch, lest they should be taken unawares by Christ’s
sudden and unexpected approach. From this he proceeds to employ various
exhortations, and then concludes the Epistle.
