<span id="v.v-p1"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="v.v.i"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p1"></span><span id="v.v.i-p1.1"></span>[Colossians
4:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001.md)<span id="v.v.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p2"></span>**1.** Masters, give unto *your* servants
that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in
heaven.

<span id="v.v.i-p3"></span>**1.** Domini, quod iustum est, servis
exhibete, mutuamque aequabilitatem, scientes quod vos quoque Dominum
habeatis in coelis.

<span id="v.v.i-p4"></span>**2.** Continue in prayer, and watch in the
same with thanksgiving;

<span id="v.v.i-p5"></span>**2.** Orationi instate, vigilantes in ea,
cum gratiarum actione.

<span id="v.v.i-p6"></span>**3.** Withal praying also for us, that God
would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ,
for which I am also in bonds:

<span id="v.v.i-p7"></span>**3.** Orate simul et pro nobis, ut Deus
aperiat nobis ianuam sermonis ad loquendum mysterium Christi, cuius
etiam causa vinctus sum.

<span id="v.v.i-p8"></span>**4.** That I may make it manifest, as I
ought to speak.

<span id="v.v.i-p9"></span>**4.** Ut manifestem illud, quemadmodum
oportet me loqui.

<span id="v.v.i-p10"></span> 

<span id="v.v.i-p11"></span><span id="v.v.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p12"></span>**1.** *Masters, what is just*. He mentions
first, *what is just*, by which term he expresses that kindness, as to
which he has given injunction in the Epistle to the Ephesians. (<span
id="v.v.i-p12.1"></span>[Eph 6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.v.i-p12.1"></span>.) But as masters, looking down as it were from
aloft, despise the condition of servants, so that they think that they
are bound by no law, Paul brings them under control,  <span
id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461.md) because both are equally under
subjection to the authority of God. Hence that *equity* of which he
makes mention.

<span id="v.v.i-p14"></span>*And mutual equity.* Some understand it
otherwise, but I have no doubt that Paul here employed <span
id="v.v.i-p14.1"></span>ἰσότητα to mean analogical  <span
id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462.md) or distributive right,  <span
id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md) as in *Ephesians*, <span
id="v.v.i-p16.2"></span>τὰ αὐτὰ, (*the* *same* *things*.)  <span
id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md) For masters have not their servants
bound to them in such a manner as not to owe something to them in their
turn, as analogical right to be in force among all ranks.  <span
id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md)

<span id="v.v.i-p19"></span><span id="v.v.i-p19.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p20"></span>**2.** *Continue in prayer*. He returns to
general exhortations, in which we must not expect an exact order, for in
that case he would have begun with prayer, but Paul had not an eye to
that. Farther, as to prayer, he commends here two things; *first*,
assiduity; *secondly*, alacrity, or earnest intentness. For, when he
says, *continue*, he exhorts to perseverance, while he makes mention of
*watching* in opposition to coldness, and listlessness.  <span
id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md)

<span id="v.v.i-p22"></span>He adds, *thanksgiving*, because God must be
solicited for present necessity in such a way that, in the mean time, we
do not forget favors already received. Farther, we ought not to be so
importunate as to murmur, and feel offended if God does not immediately
gratify our wishes, but must receive contentedly whatever he gives. Thus
a twofold *giving of thanks* is necessary. As to this point something
has also been said in the Epistle to the Philippians. (<span
id="v.v.i-p22.1"></span>[Php 4:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#006.md)<span
id="v.v.i-p22.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.v.i-p23"></span><span id="v.v.i-p23.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p24"></span>**3.** *Pray also for us*. He does not say
this by way of pretense, but because, being conscious to himself of his
own necessity, he was earnestly desirous to be aided by their prayers,
and was fully persuaded that they would be of advantage to them. Who
then, in the present day, would dare to despise the intercessions of
brethren, which Paul openly declares himself to stand in need of? And,
unquestionably, it is not in vain that the Lord has appointed this
exercise of love between us — that we pray for each other. Not only,
therefore, ought each of us to pray for his brethren, but we ought also,
on our part, diligently to seek help from the prayers of others, as
often as occasion requires. It is, however, a childish  <span
id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md) argument on the part of Papists, who
infer from this, that the dead must be implored  <span
id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md) to pray for us. For what is there here
that bears any resemblance to this? Paul commends himself to the prayers
of the brethren, with whom he knows that he has mutual fellowship
according to the commandment of God: who will deny that this reason does
not hold in the case of the dead? Leaving, therefore, such trifles, let
us return to Paul.

<span id="v.v.i-p27"></span>As we have a signal example of modesty, in
the circumstance that Paul calls others to his assistance, so we are
also admonished, that it is a thing that is replete with the greatest
difficulty, to persevere steadfastly in the defense of the gospel, and
especially when danger presses. For it is not without cause that he
desires that the Churches may assist him in this matter. Consider, too,
at the same time, his amazing ardor of zeal. He is not solicitous as to
his own safety;  <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) he does not ask
that prayers may be poured forth by the Churches on his behalf, that he
may be delivered from danger of death. He is contented with this one
thing, that he may, unconquered and undaunted, persevere in a confession
of the gospel; nay more, he fearlessly makes his own life a secondary
matter, as compared with the glory of Christ and the spread of the
gospel.

<span id="v.v.i-p29"></span>By a *door of utterance*, however, he simply
means what, in <span id="v.v.i-p29.1"></span>[Eph
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#019.md)<span id="v.v.i-p29.1"></span>, he
terms the *opening of the mouth*, and what Christ calls a *mouth* *and*
*wisdom*. (<span id="v.v.i-p29.2"></span>[Lu
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#015)<span id="v.v.i-p29.2"></span>..md)
For the expression differs nothing from the other in meaning, but merely
in form, for he here intimates, by all elegant metaphor, that it is in
no degree easier for us to speak confidently respecting the gospel, than
to break through a door that is barred and bolted. For this is truly a
divine work, as Christ himself said,

<span id="v.v.i-p30"></span>It is not ye that speak,  
but the Spirit of your Father  
that speaketh in you.  
(<span id="v.v.i-p30.4"></span>[Mt
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#020)<span id="v.v.i-p30.4"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v.i-p31"></span>Having, therefore, set forward the
difficulty, he stirs up the Colossians the more to prayer, by declaring
that he cannot speak right, except in so far as his tongue is directed
by the Lord. *Secondly*, he argues from the dignity  <span
id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) of the matter, when he calls the
gospel the *mystery of Christ*. For we must labor in a more perfunctory
manner in a matter of such importance. *Thirdly*, he makes mention also
of his danger.

<span id="v.v.i-p33"></span><span id="v.v.i-p33.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p34"></span>**4.** *As I ought*. This clause sets forth
more strongly the difficulty, for he intimates that it is no ordinary
matter. In the Epistle to the Ephesians, (<span
id="v.v.i-p34.1"></span>[Eph 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.v.i-p34.1"></span>,) he adds, <span id="v.v.i-p34.2"></span>ἵνα
παῤῥησιάσωμαι, (*that* *I* *may* *speak* *boldly*,) from which it
appears that he desired for himself an undaunted confidence, such as
befits the majesty of the gospel. Farther, as Paul here does nothing
else than desire that grace may be given him for the discharge of his
office, let us bear in mind that a rule is in like manner prescribed to
us, not to give way to the fury of our adversaries, but to strive even
to death in the publication of the gospel. As this, however, is beyond
our power, it is necessary that we should *continue in prayer*, that the
Lord may not leave us destitute of the spirit of confidence.

<span id="v.v.ii"></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p1"></span><span id="v.v.ii-p1.1"></span>[Colossians
4:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#005.md)<span id="v.v.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p2"></span>**5.** Walk in wisdom toward them that are
without, redeeming the time.

<span id="v.v.ii-p3"></span>**5.** Sapienter ambulate erga extraneos,
tempus redimentes.

<span id="v.v.ii-p4"></span>**6.** Let your speech *be* alway with
grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every
man.

<span id="v.v.ii-p5"></span>**6.** Sermo vester semper in gratia sit
sale conditus: ut sciatis quomodo oporteat vos unicuique respondere.

<span id="v.v.ii-p6"></span>**7.** All my state shall Tychicus declare
unto you, *who is* a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and
fellowservant in the Lord:

<span id="v.v.ii-p7"></span>**7.** Res meas omnes patefaciet vobis
Tychicus dilectus frater et fidelis minister ac conservus in Domino.

<span id="v.v.ii-p8"></span>**8.** Whom I have sent unto you for the
same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;

<span id="v.v.ii-p9"></span>**8.** Quem misi ad vos hac de causa, ut
sciretis statum meum, et consolaretur corda vestra:

<span id="v.v.ii-p10"></span>**9.** With Onesimus, a faithful and
beloved brother, who is *one* of you. They shall make known unto you all
things which *are done* here.

<span id="v.v.ii-p11"></span>**9.** Cum Onesimo fideli et dilecto
fratre, qui est ex vobis. Omnia patefacient vobis quae hic sunt.

<span id="v.v.ii-p12"></span> 

<span id="v.v.ii-p13"></span><span id="v.v.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p14"></span>**5.** *Walk wisely.* He makes mention of
*those that are without*, in contrast with those that are of the
*household* *of* *faith*. (<span id="v.v.ii-p14.1"></span>[Ga
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#010)<span id="v.v.ii-p14.1"></span>..md)
For the Church is like a city of which all believers are the
inhabitants, connected with each other by a mutual relationship, while
unbelievers are strangers. But why would he have regard to be had to
them, rather than to believers? There are three reasons: *first*,

<span id="v.v.ii-p15"></span>lest any *stumblingblock* *be* *put*
*in*,  
*the* *way* *of* *the* *blind*, (<span id="v.v.ii-p15.2"></span>[Le
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#014)<span id="v.v.ii-p15.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="v.v.ii-p16"></span>for nothing is more ready to occur, than
that unbelievers are driven from bad to worse through our imprudence,
and their minds are wounded, so that they hold religion more and more in
abhorrence. *Secondly*, it is lest any occasion may be given for
detracting from the honor of the gospel, and thus the name of Christ be
exposed to derision, persons be rendered more hostile, and disturbances
and persecutions be stirred up. *Lastly*, it is, lest, while we are
mingled together, in partaking of food, and on other occasions, we be
defiled by their pollutions, and by little and little become profane.

<span id="v.v.ii-p17"></span>To the same effect, also, is what follows,
*redeeming the time*, that is, because intercourse with them is
dangerous. For in <span id="v.v.ii-p17.1"></span>[Eph
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#016.md)<span id="v.v.ii-p17.1"></span>,
he assigns the reason, *because* *the* *days* *are* *evil*. “Amidst so
great a corruption as prevails in the world we must seize opportunities
of doing good, and we must struggle against impediments.” The more,
therefore, that our path is blocked up with occasions of offense, so
much the more carefully must we take heed lest our feet should stumble,
or we should stop short through indolence.

<span id="v.v.ii-p18"></span><span id="v.v.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p19"></span>**6.** *Your speech*. He requires suavity
of speech, such as may allure the hearers by its profitableness, for he
does not merely condemn communications that are openly wicked or
impious, but also such as are worthless and idle. Hence he would have
them *seasoned with salt*. Profane men have their seasonings of
discourse,  <span id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) but he does not
speak of them; nay more, as witticisms are insinuating, and for the most
part procure favor,  <span id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) he
indirectly prohibits believers from the practice and familiar use of
them. For he reckons as tasteless everything that does not edify. The
term *grace* is employed in the same sense, so as to be opposed to
talkativeness, taunts, and all sorts of trifles which are either
injurious or vain.  <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md)

<span id="v.v.ii-p23"></span>*That ye may know how.* The man who has
accustomed himself to caution in his communications will not fall into
many absurdities, into which talkative and prating persons fall into
from time to time, but, by constant practice, will acquire for himself
expertness in making proper and suitable replies; as, on the other hand,
it must necessarily happen, that silly talkers expose themselves to
derision whenever they are interrogated as to anything; and in this they
pay the just punishment of their silly talkativeness. Nor does he merely
say *what*, but also *how*, and not to all indiscriminately, but to
*every* *one*. For this is not the least important part of prudence — to
have due regard to individuals.  <span id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md)

<span id="v.v.ii-p25"></span><span id="v.v.ii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p26"></span>**7** *My things.* That the Colossians may
know what concern he has for them, he confirms them, by giving them, in
a manner, a pledge. For although he was in prison, and was in danger of
his life, making care for himself a secondary matter, he consults for
their interests by sending Tychicus to them. In this the singular zeal,
no less than prudence of the holy Apostle, shines forth; for it is no
small matter that, while he is held prisoner, and is in the most
imminent danger on account of the gospel, he, nevertheless, does not
cease to employ himself in advancing the gospel, and takes care of all
the Churches. Thus, the body, indeed, is under confinement, but the
mind, anxious to employ itself in everything good, roams far and wide.
His prudence shews itself in his sending a fit and prudent person to
confirm them, as far as was necessary, and withstand the craftiness of
the false apostles; and, farther, in his retaining Epaphras beside
himself, until they should come to learn what and how great an agreement
there was in doctrine among all true teachers, and might hear from
Tychicus the same thing that they had previously learned from Epaphras.
Let us carefully meditate on these examples, that they may stir us up to
all imitation of the like pursuit.

<span id="v.v.ii-p27"></span><span id="v.v.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p28"></span>He adds, *Onesimus*, that the embassy may
have the more weight. It is, however, uncertain who this Onesimus was.
For it can scarcely be believed that this is the slave of Philemon,
inasmuch as the name of a thief and a fugitive would have been liable to
reproach.  <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) He distinguishes both
of them by honorable titles, that they may do the more good, and
especially Tychicus, who was to exercise the office of an instructor.

<span id="v.v.iii"></span>

<span id="v.v.iii-p1"></span><span id="v.v.iii-p1.1"></span>[Colossians
4:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#010.md)<span id="v.v.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iii-p2"></span>**10.** Aristarchus my fellowprisoner
saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye
received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)

<span id="v.v.iii-p3"></span>**10.** Salutat vos Aristarchus,
concaptivus meus, et Marcus, cognatus Barnabae, de quo accepistis
mandata si venerit ad vos, ut suscipiatis ipsum.

<span id="v.v.iii-p4"></span>**11.** And Jesus, which is called Justus,
who are of the circumcision. These only *are my* fellowworkers unto the
kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.

<span id="v.v.iii-p5"></span>**11.** Et Iesus qui dicitur Iustus, qui
sunt ex circumcisione, hi soli cooperarii in regnum Dei, qui mihi
fuerunt solatio.

<span id="v.v.iii-p6"></span>**12.** Epaphras, who is *one* of you, a
servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in
prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

<span id="v.v.iii-p7"></span>**12.** Salutat vos Epaphras, qui est ex
vobis servus Christi, semper decertans pro vobis in precationibus, ut
stetis perfecti et completi in omni voluntate Dei.

<span id="v.v.iii-p8"></span>**13.** For I bear him record, that he hath
a great zeal for you, and them *that are* in Laodicea, and them in
Hierapolis.

<span id="v.v.iii-p9"></span>**13.** Testimonium enim illi reddo, quod
multum studium vestri habeat, et eorum qui sunt Laodiceae et Hierapoli.

<span id="v.v.iii-p10"></span> 

<span id="v.v.iii-p11"></span><span id="v.v.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iii-p12"></span>**10.** *Fellow-prisoner.* From this it
appears that there were others that were associated with Paul,  <span
id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md) after he was brought to Rome. It is
also probable that his enemies exerted themselves, in the outset, to
deter all pious persons from giving him help, by threatening them with
the like danger, and that this for a time had the desired effect; but
that afterwards some, gathering up courage, despised everything that was
held out to them in the way of terror.

<span id="v.v.iii-p14"></span>*That ye receive him.* Some manuscripts
have *receive* in the imperative mood; but it is a mistake, for he
expresses the nature of the *charge* which the Colossians had received —
that it was a commendation of either Barnabas, or of Marcus. The latter
is the more probable. In the Greek it is the infinitive mood,  <span
id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md) but it may be rendered in the way I
have done. Let us, however, observe, that they were careful in
furnishing attestations, that they might distinguish good men from false
brethren — from pretenders, from impostors, and multitudes of vagrants.
The same care is more than simply necessary at the present day, both
because good teachers are coldly received, and because credulous and
foolish men lay themselves too open to be deceived by impostors.

<span id="v.v.iii-p16"></span><span id="v.v.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iii-p17"></span>**11.** *These only are fellow-workers,* —
that is, of the circumcision; for he afterwards names others, but they
were of the uncircumcision. He means, therefore, that there were few
Jews at Rome who shewed themselves to be helpers to the gospel, nay
more, that the whole nation was opposed to Christ. At the same time, by
*workers* he means those only who were endowed with gifts that were
necessary for promoting the gospel. But where was Peter at that time?
Unquestionably, he has either been shamefully passed over here, and not
without injustice, or else those speak falsely who maintain that he was
then at Rome. Farther, he calls the gospel the *kingdom of God*, for it
is the scepter by which God reigns over us, and by means of it we are
singled out to life eternal.  <span id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md)
But of this form of expression we shall treat more fully elsewhere.

<span id="v.v.iii-p19"></span><span id="v.v.iii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iii-p20"></span>**12** *Always striving.* Here we have an
example of a good pastor, whom distance of place cannot induce to forget
the Church, so as to prevent him from taking the care of it with him
beyond the sea. We must notice, also, the strength of entreaty that is
expressed in the word *striving*. For although the Apostle had it in
view here to express intensity of affection, he at the same time
admonishes the Colossians not to look upon the prayers of their pastor
as useless, but, on the contrary, to reckon that they would afford them
no small assistance. Lastly, let us infer from Paul’s words, that the
*perfection* of Christians is, when they *stand complete in the will of
God*, that they may not suspend their scheme of life upon anything else.

<span id="v.v.iv"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p1"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p1.1"></span>[Colossians
4:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014.md)<span id="v.v.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p2"></span>**14.** Luke, the beloved physician, and
Demas, greet you.

<span id="v.v.iv-p3"></span>**14.** Salutat vos Lucas medicus dilectus,

<span id="v.v.iv-p4"></span>**15.** Salute the brethren which are in

<span id="v.v.iv-p5"></span>**15.** Salutate fratres qui sunt Laodiceae,
et Nympham, et Ecclesiam quae est domi ipsius;

<span id="v.v.iv-p6"></span>**16.** And when this epistle is read among
you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and
that ye likewise read the *epistle* from Laodicea.

<span id="v.v.iv-p7"></span>**16.** Et quum lecta fuerit apud vos
epistola, facite ut etiam in Laodicensium Ecclesia legatur: et eam quae
ex Laodicea est ut vos legatis.

<span id="v.v.iv-p8"></span>**17.** And say to Archippus, Take heed to
the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.

<span id="v.v.iv-p9"></span>**17.** Et dicite Archippo: Vide ministerium
quod accepisti in Domino, ut illud impleas.

<span id="v.v.iv-p10"></span>**18.** The salutation by the hand of me
Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace *be* with you. Amen.

<span id="v.v.iv-p11"></span>**18.** Salutatio, mea manu Pauli. Memores
estote vinculorum meorum. Gratia vobiscum. Amen.

<span id="v.v.iv-p12"></span>Written from Rome to the Colossians by
Tychicus and Onesimus.

<span id="v.v.iv-p13"></span>Missa e Roma per Tychicum et Onesimum.

<span id="v.v.iv-p14"></span> 

<span id="v.v.iv-p15"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p16"></span>**14.** *Luke saluteth you.* I do not agree
with those who understand this to be Luke the Evangelist; for I am of
opinion that he was too well known to stand in need of such a
designation, and he would have been signalized by a more magnificent
eulogium. He would, undoubtedly, have called him his fellow-helper, or
at least his companion and participant in his conflicts. I rather
conjecture that he was absent at that time, and that it is another of
the same name that is called a *physician,* to distinguish him from the
other. *Demas*, of whom he makes mention, is undoubtedly the person of
whom he complains — that he afterwards deserted him. (<span
id="v.v.iv-p16.1"></span>[2Ti
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010)<span id="v.v.iv-p16.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v.iv-p17"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p18"></span>When he speaks of the Church which was in
the house of Nymphas, let us bear in mind, that, in the instance of one
household, a rule is laid down as to what it becomes all Christian
households to be — that they be so many little Churches.  <span
id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md) Let every one, therefore, know that
this charge is laid upon him — that he is to train up his house in the
fear of the Lord, to keep it under a holy discipline, and, in fine, to
form in it the likeness of a Church.

<span id="v.v.iv-p20"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p21"></span>**16.** *Let it be read in the Church of
the Laodiceans.* Hence, though it was addressed to the Colossians, it
was, nevertheless, necessary that it should be profitable to others. The
same view must also be taken of all the Epistles. They were indeed, in
the first instance, addressed to particular Churches, but, as they
contain doctrine that is always in force, and is common to all ages, it
is of no importance what title they bear, for the subject matter belongs
to us. It has been groundlessly supposed that the other Epistle of which
he makes mention was written by Paul, and those labor under a double
mistake who think that it was written by Paul to the Laodiceans. I have
no doubt that it was an Epistle that had been sent to Paul, the perusal
of which might be profitable to the Colossians, as neighboring towns
have usually many things in common. There was, however, an exceedingly
gross imposture in the circumstance that some worthless person, I know
not who, had the audacity to forge, under this pretext, an Epistle, that
is so insipid,  <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md) that nothing can
be conceived to be more foreign to Paul’s spirit.

<span id="v.v.iv-p23"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p24"></span>**17** *Say to Archippus.* So far as I can
conjecture, this Archippus was, in the mean time, discharging the office
of pastor, during the absence of Epaphras; but perhaps he was not of
such a disposition as to be sufficiently diligent of himself without
being stirred up. Paul, accordingly, would have him be more fully
encouraged by the exhortation of the whole Church. He might have
admonished him in his own name individually; but he gives this charge to
the Colossians that they may know that they must themselves employ
incitements,  <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) if they see their
pastor cold, and the pastor himself does not refuse to be admonished by
the Church. For the ministers of the word are endowed with signal
authority, but such at the same time as is not exempt from laws. Hence,
it is necessary that they should shew themselves teachable if they would
duly teach others. As to Paul’s calling attention again  <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) to his *bonds*, he intimates by this
that he was in no slight degree afflicted. For he was mindful of human
infirmity, and without doubt he felt some twinges of it in himself,
inasmuch as he was so very urgent that all pious persons, should be
mindful of his distresses. It is, however, no evidence of distrust, that
he calls in from all quarters the helps that were appointed him by the
Lord. The subscription, *with his own hand*, means, as we have seen
elsewhere, that there were even then spurious epistles in circulation,
so that it was necessary to provide against imposition.  <span

<span id="v.v.ii-p29"></span> Paley, in his <span
id="v.v.ii-p29.1"></span>Horae Paulinae, finds the statement here made
respecting Onesimus, “who is one of you,” one of the many undesigned
coincidences which he adduces in that admirable treatise, in evidence of
the credibility of the New Testament. The train of his reasoning in this
instance may be briefly stated thus — that while it appears from the
Epistle to Philemon, that Onesimus was the servant or slave of Philemon,
it is not stated in that Epistle to what city Philemon belonged; but
that it appears from the Epistle, (<span id="v.v.ii-p29.2"></span>[Phlm.
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002)<span id="v.v.ii-p29.2"></span>,.md)
that he was of the same place, whatever that place was, with an eminent
Christian, named Archippus, whom we find saluted by name amongst the
Colossian Christians; while the expression made use of by Paul here
respecting Onesimus, “who is one of you,” clearly marks him out as being
of the same city, viz., Colosse. — *Ed.*
