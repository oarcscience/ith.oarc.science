<span id="xviii"></span>

<span id="xviii-p1"></span>PSALM 52

<span id="xviii-p2"></span>This psalm was composed by David at the time
when the death of Abimelech and the other priests had spread universal
tenor among the people, indisposing them for lending any countenance to
his cause, and when Doeg was triumphing in the successful issue of his
information. Supported, even in these circumstances, by the elevating
influence of faith, he inveighs against the cruel treachery of that
unprincipled informer, and encourages himself by the reflection, that
God, who is judge in heaven, will vindicate the interests of such as
fear him, and punish the pride of the ungodly.

<span id="xviii-p3"></span>To the chief singer. A Psalm of David for
instruction; when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto
him, that David had come into the house of Abimelech.

<span id="xviii-p4"></span>I have already had occasion to observe that
the term <span id="xviii-p4.1"></span>משכיל, *maskil,* is strictly
affixed to those psalms in which David makes mention of having been
chastised by God, or at least admonished, by some species of affliction,
sent, like the rod of the schoolmaster, to administer correction. Of
this we have examples in <span id="xviii-p4.2"></span>[Psalms
32](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#000.md)<span id="xviii-p4.2"></span> and
42. As inscribed above the 45th psalm, its meaning is somewhat
different. There, it seems designed to intimate to the reader that the
song, although breathing of love, was not intended to please a mere
wanton taste, but describes the spiritual marriage of Christ with his
Church. In this and the following psalms, the term admits of being
understood as signifying *instruction,* more particularly such as
proceeds from *correction;* and David, by employing it, would evidently
insinuate that he was at this time subjected to peculiar trials, sent to
instruct him in the duty of placing an absolute trust in God. The
portion of history to which the psalm refers is well known. When David
had fled to Abimelech in Nob, he obtained provisions and the sword of
Goliath from the hands of that priest, having concealed from him the
real danger in which he stood, and pretended that he was executing a
secret and important business of the king. Doeg, chief of the king’s
herdsmen, having conveyed intelligence of this to Saul, in expectation
of a reward, was the means of drawing down the rage of the tyrant, not
only upon that innocent individual, but the whole priesthood.  <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) The bloody example which was thus made
must have deterred the people from extending to David even the commonest
offices of humanity, and every avenue of relief seemed shut upon the
miserable exile. As Doeg triumphed in the success of his crime, and
others might be tempted, by the reward which he had received, to
meditate the ruin of David, we find him in this psalm animating his soul
with divine consolations, and challenging his enemies with the audacity
of their conduct.

<span id="xviii.i"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p1"></span><span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
52:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#001.md)<span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p2"></span>**1**. Why boastest thou of thy wickedness,
thou mighty man? The goodness of God endureth daily. **2**. Thy tongue
reckons up mischiefs, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. **3**.
Thou lovest evil more than good, to speak lying rather than
righteousness. Selah. **4**. Thou lovest all words of deceit, O thou
guileful tongue!

<span id="xviii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xviii.i-p4"></span><span id="xviii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p5"></span>**1.** *Why boastest thou of thy
wickedness?* The success which crowned the treachery of Doeg must have
tended considerably to stagger David’s faith; and he seems to have
adopted the strain of holy defiance with which the psalm commences, in
order to arm himself more effectually against this temptation. He begins
by charging Doeg with an aggravation of his guilt, in boasting of the
power which he had acquired by an act of consummate villany. This power
may have been sufficiently considerable to attract the notice which is
here taken of it; for although he is only said to have been “master of
the king’s herdsmen,” the designation does not imply that he was
personally occupied in herding cattle, but may have been an honorary
title; as in modern courts we speak of “The Master of the Horse.” he is
reminded that there was no reason why he should applaud himself in his
greatness, so long as he abused it to purposes of wickedness; nor why he
should be vain of any new honor which the king might have conferred upon
him in consideration of his late crime, as integrity is the only sure
pathway to power and preferment. Any triumph which may be obtained by
violence, treachery, or other unjustifiable means, is short-lived. In
the second part of the verse, he points at the true cause of the
blindness and stupidity that lead men to glory in their wickedness,
which is, that they despise the poor and the humble; imagine that God
will not condescend to interest himself in their behalf; and therefore
embrace the occasion of oppressing them with impunity. They make no
account of that providence which God exerts over his own children.
David, in the exercise of a holy confidence, challenges such proud
boasters with dishonoring the goodness of God; and as the Divine
goodness does not always pursue the same even course — occasionally
appears to suffer an interruption, and sometimes seems as if it were cut
off altogether, David repels any temptation which this might suggest, by
asserting that, whatever appearances may say to the contrary, it is
daily exercised. This is evidently the meaning which he intends to
convey, that any partial obstructions which may take place in the
display of it can never prevent its constant renewal. He was confident
that he would experience, in the future, what he had found in the past;
for God cannot become weary in helping his people, or alleviating their
miseries; and although he may suffer them again and again to fall into
affliction, he is always equally ready to extend them the deliverance
which they need.

<span id="xviii.i-p6"></span><span id="xviii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p7"></span>**2.** *Thy tongue reckons up mischiefs*
David is not to be considered as here venting a flood of reproaches
against his adversary, as many who have been unjustly injured are in the
habit of doing, merely to gratify a feeling of revenge. He brings these
charges against him in the sight of God, with a view to encourage
himself in the hopefulness of his own cause: for it is plain that the
farther our enemies proceed in the practice of iniquity, they
proportionally provoke the anger of the Lord, and are nearer to that
destruction which must issue in our deliverance. His object, therefore,
is not to blacken the character of Doeg in the estimation of the world,
but rather to set before his own eyes the divine punishment which the
flagrant offenses he specifies were certain to draw down upon his head.
Amongst these he singles out, as more especially worthy of reprobation,
the hidden treachery with which he had been chargeable in accomplishing
the destruction of the priesthood. Adverting to his secret and malicious
information, he likens *his tongue to a sharp razor,* as elsewhere,
<span id="xviii.i-p7.1"></span>[Ps
120:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#004.md)<span id="xviii.i-p7.1"></span>,
the tongues of the wicked are compared to “sharp arrows.” It is added,
*working deceitfully,* which words are considered by some as referring
to the razor which cuts subtilely, and not with an open wound like a
sword; but perhaps they may be construed with more propriety as applying
to the tongue,  <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) although there
can be no doubt of the reason of the comparison.

<span id="xviii.i-p9"></span><span id="xviii.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p10"></span>The term <span
id="xviii.i-p10.1"></span>בלע*, balang,* in verse fourth, which has been
translated *destruction,* I prefer understanding in the sense of
*hiding* or *concealment.* He seems to allude to the drawing back of the
tongue when we swallow; and under this figure, to describe the
deceitfulness of Doeg’s words, by which he devoured the unsuspecting and
the innocent.  <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) The great design
of David, as I have already remarked in the preceding verses, is to
encourage himself in the hope of deliverance by dwelling upon the
extreme character of that wickedness which his enemy had displayed.

<span id="xviii.ii"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
52:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005.md)<span id="xviii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p2"></span>**5**. God shall likewise destroy thee for
ever: he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling-place,
and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah **6**. The righteous
also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him. **7**. Lo! this is the
man that made not God his strength; and trusted in the abundance of his
riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.

<span id="xviii.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xviii.ii-p4"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p5"></span>**5** *God shall likewise destroy thee for
ever.* From these words it is made still more evident that his object in
dwelling upon the aggravated guilt of Doeg, was to prove the certainty
of his approaching doom, and this rather for his own conviction and
comfort, than with a view to alarming the conscience of the offender.
Accordingly, he declares his persuasion that God would not allow his
treachery to pass unpunished, though he might for a time connive at the
perpetration of it. The ungodly are disposed, so long as their
prosperity continues, to indulge in undisturbed security; and the saint
of God, when he sees the power of which they are possessed, and
witnesses their proud contempt of the divine judgments, is too apt to be
overwhelmed with unbelieving apprehensions. But in order to establish
his mind in the truth which he announces, it is observable that the
Psalmist heaps one expression upon another, — God shall *destroy thee,
take thee away, pluck thee out, root thee out,* — as if by this
multiplicity of words he would convince himself more effectually, that
God was able to overthrow this adversary with all his boasted might and
authority.  <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) In adding that God
would root him out of his *dwelling-place* or *tent,*  <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) and *out of the land of the living,*
he insinuates that the wicked will be destroyed by God, however securely
they may seem to repose ir the nest of some comfortable mansion, and in
the vain hope of living upon earth for ever. Possibly he may allude, in
mentioning a *tent,* to the profession of Doeg, as shepherds have their
dwelling in tents.

<span id="xviii.ii-p8"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p9"></span>**6** *The righteous also shall see, and
fear*  <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) He here adduces, as
another reason why the ruin of Doeg might be expected, that an important
end would be obtained by it, in so far as it would promote religion in
the hearts of the Lord’s people, and afford them a refreshing display of
the Divine justice. Should it take place, it would be witnessed by the
ungodly as well as by the righteous; but there are two reasons why the
Psalmist represents it as being seen especially by the latter. The
wicked are incapable of profiting by the judgments of God, being blind
to the plainest manifestations which he has made of himself in his
works, and it was only the righteous therefore who could see it.
Besides, the great end which God has in view, when he prostrates the
pride of the ungodly, is the comfort of his own people, that he may show
to them the care with which he watches over their safety. It is they,
therefore, whom David represents as witnessing this spectacle of Divine
justice. And when he says that they would *fear,* it is not meant that
they would tremble, or experience any slavish apprehension, but that
their reverential regard for God would be increased by this proof of his
care of their interests. When left exposed to the injurious treatment of
their enemies, they are apt to be distressed with doubts as to the
concern which he takes in the government of the world. But such
illustrations to the contrary have the effect of quickening their
discouraged zeal, and promoting that fear which is by no means
inconsistent with the joy spoken of in the close of the verse. They are
led to reverence him the more when they see that he is the avenger of
cruelty and injustice: on the other hand, when they perceive that he
appears in defense of their cause, and joins common battle with them
against their adversaries, they are naturally filled with the most
triumphant joy. The beautiful play upon the words *see* and *fear,* in
the Hebrew, cannot be transferred to our language; the form of the
expression intimates that they would see, and see effectually.

<span id="xviii.ii-p11"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p12"></span>**7.** *Lo! this is the man that made not
God his strength* Some think that these words are given as what should
afterwards be proverbially applied to Doeg; but they would not appear to
have been intended in that restricted signification. They merely express
the improvement which the people of God would make of the judgment. It
would teach them, on the one hand, to be patient under the insolence of
the ungodly, which is so speedily humbled; and, on the other, to beware
of indulging a similarly infatuated spirit themselves. They would laugh
at their destruction, yet not in the way of insulting over them, but
rejoicing more and more in the confidence of the help of God, and
denying themselves more cheerfully to the vain pleasures of this world.
This is the lesson to be learned from such dispensations of providence:
they should recall our wandering affections to God. The verse is
introduced with an exclamation, *Lo! this is the man,* etc.; for David
would have us to look upon this one instance as representing to our
eyes, in a vivid manner, the end of all who despise the Lord; and it may
be remarked, that it is no small point of practical wisdom thus to
generalise individual providences. The two clauses, *made not God his
strength,* and, *trusted in the abundance of his riches,* stand mutually
connected; for none can be said sincerely to repose upon God but he who
has been emptied of all confidence in his own resources. So long as men
imagine that they have something of their own in which they can boast,
they will never resort to God: just in proportion as we arrogate to
ourselves do we derogate from him; and it is not only wealth, but any
other earthly possession, which, by engrossing our confidence, may
prevent us from inquiring after the Lord. The noun <span
id="xviii.ii-p12.1"></span>הוה, *havah,* which most interpreters have
rendered *wickedness,*  <span id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) and some
*slaughter* or *destruction,* seems, in this place, rather to mean
*substance.*  <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) Such repetitions
of the same sentiment in different words are common with the Psalmist;
and, according to this translation, the verse will flow connectedly,
reading, that the man who trusts in his riches, and strengthens himself
in his substance, defrauds God of his just glory.

<span id="xviii.iii"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
52:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#008.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p2"></span>**8**. But I am like a green olive-tree
in the house of God: I have hoped in the goodness of God for ever and
ever. **9**. I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it. I
will wait on thy name, for it is good before thy meek ones.

<span id="xviii.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xviii.iii-p4"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p5"></span>**8** *But I am like a green olive-tree*
 <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) We have seen that David was
enabled, by the exercise of faith, to look down upon the worldly
grandeur of Doeg with a holy contempt; and now we find him rising
superior to all that was presently afflictive in his own condition.
Though, to appearance, he more resembled the withered trunk of a tree
which rots upon the ground, he compares himself, in the confidence of
coming prosperity, to a green olive. I need not say that the destruction
of Doeg could only communicate comfort to his mind, in the way of
convincing him that God was the avenging judge of human cruelty, and
leading him to infer that, as he had punished his wrongs, so he would
advance him to renewed measures of prosperity. From his language, it
appears that he could conceive of no higher felicity in his condition
than being admitted amongst the number of the worshippers of God, and
engaging in the exercises of devotion. This was characteristic of his
spirit. We have already had occasion to see that he felt his banishment
from the sanctuary of God more keenly than separation from his consort,
the loss of worldly substance, or the dangers and hardships of the
wilderness. The idea of an allusion being here made, by way of contrast,
to Doeg, who came to the tabernacle of the Lord merely as a spy, and
under hypocritical pretexts, is strained and far-fetched. It is more
natural to suppose that David distinguishes himself from all his
enemies, without exception, intimating that, though he was presently
removed from the tabernacle, he would soon be restored to it; and that
they who boasted of possessing, or rather monopolising, the house of
God, would be rooted out of it with disgrace. And here let us engrave
the useful lesson upon our hearts, that we should consider it the great
end of our existence to be found numbered amongst the worshippers of
God; and that we should avail ourselves of the inestimable privilege of
the stated assemblies of the Church, which are necessary helps to our
infirmity, and means of mutual excitement and encouragement. By these,
and our common Sacraments, the Lord, who is one God, and who designed
that we should be one in him, is training us up together in the hope of
eternal life, and in the united celebration of his holy name. Let us
learn with David to prefer a place in the house of God to all the lying
vanities of this world. He adds the reason why he should be like the
green olive-tree — because *he hoped in the goodness of God;* for the
causal particle appears to be understood. And in this he adverts to the
contrast between him and his enemies. They might flourish for a time,
spread their branches far and wide, and shoot themselves up to a
gigantic stature, but would speedily wither away, because they had no
root in the goodness of God; whereas he was certain to derive from this
source ever renewed supplies of sap and vigor. As the term of his
earthly trials might be protracted, and there was a danger that he might
sink under their long continuance, unless his confidence should extend
itself far into futurity, he declares expressly that he would not
presume to prescribe times to God, and that his hopes were stretched
into eternity. It followed that he surrendered himself entirely to God
in all that regarded this life or his death. The passage puts us in
possession of the grand distinction between the genuine children of God
and those who are hypocrites. They are to be found together in the
Church, as the wheat is mingled with the chaff on the same
threshing-floor; but the one class abides for ever in the steadfastness
of a well-founded hope, while the other is driven away in the vanity of
its false confidences.

<span id="xviii.iii-p7"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p8"></span>**9.** *I will praise thee, etc*. He
concludes the psalm with thanksgiving, and shows that he is sincere in
this, by the special acknowledgement which he makes of the fact that
this had been the work of God. Such is the corruption of the human
heart, that out of a hundred who profess gratitude to God with their
lips, scarcely one man seriously reflects upon the benefits which he has
received as coming from his hand. David declares, therefore, that it was
entirely owing to the divine protection that he had escaped from the
treachery of Doeg, and from all his subsequent dangers, and promises to
retain a grateful sense of it throughout the whole of his life. There is
no religious duty in which it does not become us to manifest a spirit of
perseverance; but we need to be especially enjoined to it in the duty of
thanksgiving, disposed as we are so speedily to forget our mercies, and
occasionally to imagine that the gratitude of a few days is a sufficient
tribute for benefits which deserve to be kept in everlasting
remembrance. He speaks of joining the exercise of hope with that of
gratitude; *for to wait on the name of God* is synonymous with patiently
expecting his mercy even when there is least appearance of its being
granted, and trusting in his word, whatever delays there may be in the
fulfillment of it. He encourages himself in the belief that his hope
will not be vain, by reflecting that the name of God *is good before his
saints* Some read, *because it is good before thy saints;* that is, to
hope in the divine name, (<span id="xviii.iii-p8.1"></span>[Ps
118:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#008.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p8.1"></span>.) But the other reading appears to me to be
the most simple and natural, expressing the truth, that God will not
frustrate the expectations of his people, because his goodness towards
them is always conspicuous. The name of God may be detested by the
wicked, and the very sound of it be sufficient to strike terror into
their hearts; but David asserts it to be a sweet name in the experience
of all his people. They are here called his meek ones, because, as I
have remarked in commenting upon <span id="xviii.iii-p8.3"></span>[Psalm
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003.md)<span id="xviii.iii-p8.3"></span>,
they reflect in their character the kindness and beneficence of their
Father in heaven.

id="xviii-p4.3"></span>

<span id="xviii-p5"></span> The history of this transaction is recorded
in <span id="xviii-p5.1"></span>[1 Sam.
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#001.md), [1 Sam.
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#009.md)<span id="xviii-p5.1"></span>. It
affords a strong evidence of the hatred which Saul bore to David, and of
his savage cruelty to order the execution of eighty-five priests for no
crime; and what a monster of iniquity must Doeg have been, who executed
this command when not another individual in all Saul’s company would do
it, and who, in addition to this, “smote the city of the priests with
the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and
oxen, and asses, and sheep?” “If we are confounded,” says Walford, “by
the savage ferocity of a prince who could order the execution of
eighty-five persons of most venerable station, for a crime which existed
alone in his disturbed imagination, we shall feel disposed to execrate
the ruthless villain who could imbrue his hands in the blood of so many
innocent victims; and we shall be ready to draw the conclusion, that
both Saul and Doeg were prompted to this deed of atrocious cruelty, not
merely by their hatred of David, but by a malevolence, almost without
parallel, against the ministers of religion, and which rendered
conspicuous their contempt and hatred for God himself. It can excite
little surprise to find David saying, as he does, in the next psalm,
‘The fool saith in his heart, There is no God.’”

<span id="fn_275"></span>[276](cc09017.htm#fr_275.md) <span
id="xviii.i-p7.2"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p8"></span> According to the first sense, the meaning
is, that as a razor cuts so easily, that the wound is at first hardly
perceptible, in the same manner, the deceitful tongue works its purposes
of mischief before the objects which it means to ruin are conscious of
their danger. It is like a sharp razor, that cuts the throat before a
man is aware of it. “If, however, we take the words, *thou workest
deceitfully*, as being descriptive not of the razor but of the tongue,
the sense will be, that such a tongue is capable of inflicting deep and
dreadful wounds like a sharp razor.” — *Walford*.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[277](cc09017.htm#fr_276.md) <span
id="xviii.i-p10.2"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p11"></span> “<span id="xviii.i-p11.1"></span>בלע,
*balang*, is *to swallow*, *to devour*, with the idea of eagerness,
greediness.” — *Gesenius*

<span id="fn_277"></span>[278](cc09017.htm#fr_277.md) <span
id="xviii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p6"></span> “Wonderful,” says Bishop Horne, “is the
force of the verbs in the original, which convey to us the four ideas of
‘laying prostrate,’ ‘dissolving as by fire,’ ‘sweeping away as with a
besom,’ and ‘totally extirpating root and branch,’ as a tree eradicated
from the spot on which it grew.” The second verb, <span
id="xviii.ii-p6.1"></span>יחתך, *yachtecha*, Bythner explains, “*will*
*snatch thee away*, as one snatches fire from a hearth. From <span
id="xviii.ii-p6.2"></span>חתה, *chatheh*, he *snatched off live coals or
fire from one place to another*.”

<span id="fn_278"></span>[279](cc09017.htm#fr_278.md) <span
id="xviii.ii-p6.3"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p7"></span> There is another interpretation of this
expression which may here be stated. It has been thought that the
allusion is to God’s tabernacle. “<span id="xviii.ii-p7.1"></span>מאהל,
*meohel*,” says Hammond, “is literally ‘from the tabernacle,’ not ‘from
*thy* dwelling-place:’ and so the LXX. render it, ‘<span
id="xviii.ii-p7.2"></span>Απὸ σκηνώματος,’ ‘from the tabernacle;’ and
though the Latin, and Syriac, and Arabic, have added <span
id="xviii.ii-p7.3"></span>*tuo*, *thy*, yet neither will the Hebrew
bear, nor do the Chaldee acknowledge it, who read by way of paraphrase,
‘He shall cause thee to depart from inhabiting in the place of the
Schechina, or tabernacle, the place of God’s presence.’” Hammond
supposes that the expression is to be understood “of the censure of
excommunication, which in the last and highest degree was *Schammatha*,
delivering up the offender to the hand of heaven to be cut off, himself
and his posterity.” “Doeg,” says Archbishop Secker, “had no office in
the tabernacle; but it seems, by his history, that he frequented it,
which he might do to seem a good man. And there seems an opposition
between his being plucked out of God’s dwelling-place, and David’s
continuing in the house of God, verse eighth.”

<span id="fn_279"></span>[280](cc09017.htm#fr_279.md) <span
id="xviii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p10"></span> French and Skinner read, “The righteous
shall see it, and feel reverence; — *feel reverence*, *i*.*e*., in the
punishment of this wicked man, find additional reason to reverence God,
and to observe his righteous laws.”

<span id="fn_280"></span>[281](cc09017.htm#fr_280.md) <span
id="xviii.ii-p12.2"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p13"></span> If this is the true rendering, there may
be a reference to the expectations which Doeg had entertained of
increasing his power and influence by maliciously injuring David, as he
would thereby obtain, in a high degree, the favor of Saul.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[282](cc09017.htm#fr_281.md) <span
id="xviii.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p14"></span> This is the marginal reading in our
English Bible. As he was Saul’s chief herdsman, it is probable that his
riches consisted chiefly in cattle.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[283](cc09017.htm#fr_282.md) <span
id="xviii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p6"></span> Our English Bible also reads, “like a
green olive-tree;” but it would be more correct to translate, “I am like
a flourishing, or vigorous olive-tree.” The original word, <span
id="xviii.iii-p6.1"></span>רענן, *raanan*, has no reference to the color
of the tree, but to its fresh, vigouous and flourish condition. Hence
this word is used, in <span id="xviii.iii-p6.2"></span>[Ps
92:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#011.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p6.2"></span>, to express “*fresh* oil;” and in <span
id="xviii.iii-p6.3"></span>[Da
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#004.md)<span id="xviii.iii-p6.3"></span>,
to denote the prosperous condition of Nebuchadnezzar, “I was at rest in
mine house, and *flourishing* in my palace.” The fact is, that the color
of the olive-tree, so far from being of a bright and lively green, is
dark, disagreeable, and yellowish. Travellers, when they have seen this
tree, have experienced a feeling of disappointment in not finding it to
possess the vivid verdure which they had been led to expect from the
description given of it in the Scriptures. An excellent English
traveler, Mr Sharpe, writing from Italy, thus expresses himself on this
subject: “The fields, and indeed the whole face of Tuscany, are in a
manner covered with olive-trees; but the olive-tree does not answer the
character I had conceived of it. The royal Psalmist, and some of the
sacred writers, speak with rapture of the ‘green olive-tree,’ so that I
expected a beautiful green; and I confess to you I was wretchedly
disappointed to find its hue resembling that of our hedges when they are
covered with dust.” But this disappointment which Mr Sharpe felt arose
not from overcharged or exaggerated colouring on the part of the sacred
writers, but from his not understanding the meaning of their language.
The beauty of the olive-tree is represented in other parts of Scripture
as consisting, not in the greenness of its foliage, but in the spread of
its branches, (<span id="xviii.iii-p6.4"></span>[Ho
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#006.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p6.4"></span>.) — *Harmer*’*s Observations*, *volume* 3,
pp. 255-257. The propriety and beauty of the comparison which David here
makes appears from the fact that the olive is an evergreen, and is also,
considering its size, long-lived. While, in the 5th verse, he had
predicted the speedy and total destruction of Doeg, comparing him to a
tree plucked up by the roots, he, in contrast with this, represents
himself as like a young, vigorous olive-tree, which had long to live and
flourish; confidently expecting to obtain that outward peace and
prosperity which God had promised him, and, along with this, the
enjoyment of all spiritual blessings.
