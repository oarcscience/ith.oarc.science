<span id="xiv-p1"></span>PSALM 48

<span id="xiv-p2"></span>In this psalm there is celebrated some notable
deliverance of the city of Jerusalem at a time when many kings had
conspired to destroy it. The prophet, (whoever was the author of the
psalm,) after having given thanks to God for this deliverance, takes
occasion from thence to extol in magnificent terms the happy state of
that city, seeing it had God for its continual guardian and protector.
It would not have been enough for the people of God to have felt and
acknowledged that they were once preserved and defended by the power of
God, had they not at the same time been assured of being also preserved
and protected by the same God in the time to come, because he had
adopted them for his peculiar people. The prophet, therefore, chiefly
insists upon this point, that it was not in vain that the sanctuary of
God was erected upon mount Zion, but that his name was there called upon
in order that his power might be conspicuously manifested for the
salvation of his people. It is easy to gather from the subject-matter of
the psalm that it was composed after the death of David. I indeed admit
that among David’s enemies there were some foreign kings, and that it
was not for want of will on their part that the city of Jerusalem was
not utterly destroyed; but we do not read that they ever proceeded the
length of besieging it, and reducing it to such extremity as to render
it necessary that their efforts should be repressed by a wonderful
manifestation of the power of God. It is more probable that the psalm is
to be referred to the time of king Ahaz, when the city was besieged and
the inhabitants brought to the point of utter despair, and when,
nevertheless, the siege was suddenly raised, (<span
id="xiv-p2.1"></span>[2Ki 16:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#005.md)<span
id="xiv-p2.1"></span>;) or else to the time of Jehoshaphat and Asa,
(<span id="xiv-p2.2"></span>[2 Chr.
14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009.md), [2 Chr.
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#002)<span id="xiv-p2.2"></span>.md) for
we know that under their reigns Jerusalem was preserved from utter
destruction only by miraculous aid from heaven. This we are to regard as
certain, that the Psalmist here exhibited to true believers an example
of the favor of God towards them, from which they had reason to
acknowledge that their condition was happy, seeing God had chosen for
himself a dwelling-place upon mount Zion, that from thence he might
preside over them for their good and safety.

48:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001.md)<span id="xiv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p2"></span>**1**. Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be
praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness. **2**.
Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on

<span id="xiv.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xiv.i-p4"></span><span id="xiv.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p5"></span>**1.** *Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be
praised.* The prophet, before proceeding to make mention of that special
example of the favor of God towards them, to which I have adverted,
teaches in general that the city of Jerusalem was happy and prosperous,
because God had been graciously pleased to take upon him the charge of
defending and preserving it. In this way he separates and distinguishes
the Church of God from all the rest of the world; and when God selects
from amongst the whole human race a small number whom he embraces with
his fatherly love, this is an invaluable blessing which he bestows upon
them. His wonderful goodness and righteousness shine forth in the
government of the whole world, so that there is no part of it void of
his praise, but we are everywhere furnished with abundant matter for
praising him. Here, however, the inspired poet celebrates the glory of
God which is manifested in the protection of the Church. He states, that
*Jehovah is great, and greatly to be praised* in the holy city. But is
he not so also in the whole world? Undoubtedly he is. As I have said,
there is not a corner so hidden, into which his wisdom, righteousness,
and goodness, do not penetrate; but it being his will that they should
be manifested chiefly and in a particular manner in his Church, the
prophet very properly sets before our eyes this mirror, in which God
gives a more clear and vivid representation of his character. By calling
Jerusalem *the holy mountain,* he teaches us in one word, by what right
and means it came to be in a peculiar manner the city of God. It was so
because the ark of the covenant had been placed there by divine
appointment. The import of the expression is this: If Jerusalem is, as
it were, a beautiful and magnificent theater on which God would have the
greatness of his majesty to be beheld, it is not owing to any merits of
its own, but because the ark of the covenant was established there by
the commandment of God as a token or symbol of his peculiar favor.

<span id="xiv.i-p6"></span><span id="xiv.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p7"></span>**2.** *Beautiful for situation, the joy of
the whole earth, is mount Zion* For the confirmation of the statement
made in the preceding sentence, the prophet celebrates the excellencies
for which mount Zion was at that time renowned; and in them was to be
seen the glory of God, of which I have just now spoken. The beauty of
its situation, which he mentions in the first place, was indeed natural;
but by it he gives us to understand, that from the very commencement the
agreeable appearance of the city had engraven upon it marks of the favor
of God, so that the sight of it alone showed that God had in a special
manner adorned and enriched that place, with the view of its being, at
some future period, consecrated to sacred purposes. I do not, however,
think that the situation is called beautiful and pleasant, merely
because it was unequalled in the country of Judea; for there were other
cities, as is well known, which were in no respect inferior to
Jerusalem, either as to fertility or pleasantness of situation, and
other advantages. In my opinion, along with the situation of the city,
the Psalmist comprehends the glory which it derived from another source
— from the circumstance that the temple of God was built there. When,
therefore, we hear the beauty of the city here celebrated, let us call
to our remembrance that spiritual beauty which was added to the natural
beauty of the place, after the prophecy was given forth that the ark
would there abide for ever. With respect to the word <span
id="xiv.i-p7.1"></span>נופ, *noph,* which I have translated *situation,*
commentators are not agreed. Some understand it as meaning *height* or
*elevation,* as if it had been said that Jerusalem was situated on high
and elevated ground. Others render it *climate*  <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) because the Jews metaphorically call
climates *branches,*  <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) on account
of the extent to which they are spread out. In a matter like this, which
is of no great consequence, I am not disposed to be so very critical.
Only I have selected that translation which seemed to me the most
probable, namely, that the country in its appearance was pre-eminently
pleasant and delightful. When the Psalmist speaks of mount Zion being
*on the sides of the north,* it is doubtful whether he lays it down as a
commendation of mount Zion, that it lay or looked towards the north; or
whether we should explain the sentence thus: Although mount Zion looks
towards the north, that does not in any degree diminish its beauty. The
former interpretation, however, seems to me to give the more natural
meaning. We find the prophet Isaiah, with the view also of touching upon
the excellence of this mountain, applying to it the very expression
which is here employed. In the 14th chapter of his Prophecies, at the
13th verse, he represents Sennacherib as speaking thus: “I will ascend
into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit
also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north.”

<span id="xiv.i-p10"></span>The Psalmist, in the next place, calls mount
Zion *the joy of the whole earth* And he thus describes it, not only
because, as the Jews foolishly talk, that country was healthy on account
of the mildness of the climate; or because it produced sweet and
excellent fruits, which might gratify ard yield delight to foreign
nations — for this also is a cold and unsatisfactory speculation; — but
because from thence salvation was to issue forth to the whole world,
even as all nations have borrowed from thence the light of life, and the
testimony of heavenly grace. If the joy which men experience and cherish
is without God, the issue of their joy at length will be destruction,
and their laughter will be turned into gnashing of teeth. But Christ
appeared with his Gospel out of Zion, to fill the world with true joy
and everlasting felicity. In the time of the prophet, the knowledge of
the Gospel, it is true, had not yet reached foreign nations; but he
makes use of this manner of expression with the highest propriety, to
teach the Jews that true blessedness was to be sought for only from the
gracious covenant of God, which was deposited in that holy place. At the
same time also, he has foretold that which was at length fulfilled in
the last time by the coming of Christ. From this we may learn, that to
cause the hearts of the godly to rejoice, the favor of God alone
abundantly suffices; as, on the contrary, when it is withdrawn, all men
must inevitably be thrown into a state of wretchedness and sorrow. What
is added immediately after, concerning *the city of the great King,* is
intended to show, that mount Zion was not only holy itself, but that
this high prerogative had been conferred upon it to render sacred the
whole city, where God had chosen his seat, that he might rule over all
people.

<span id="xiv.i-p11"></span><span id="xiv.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p12"></span>**3.** *God in her palaces is known for a
defense* Here the sacred poet again brings forward, for the purpose of
setting forth the dignity of the city of Jerusalem, the protection which
God afforded it; as we have seen in <span id="xiv.i-p12.1"></span>[Ps
46:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005.md)<span id="xiv.i-p12.1"></span>,

<span id="xiv.i-p13"></span>“God is in the midst of her: she shall not
be moved:  
God shall help her, and that right early.”

<span id="xiv.i-p14"></span>He expressly makes mention of *palaces* for
the sake of contrast — to teach the Jews, that although the holy city
was fortified by strong towers, and had within it magnificent houses,
and such as resembled fortresses, yet its continued safety was owing to
the power and aid of God alone. By these words, the people of God are
taught, that although they dwell in strongholds and palaces, they must,
nevertheless, be carefully on their guard, that this magnificence or
loftiness may not shroud or conceal from their view the power of God;
and that they be not like worldly men, who, resting satisfied with
riches and earthly means of help, set no value whatever upon having God
for their guardian and protector. Worldly wealth, from our natural
perverseness, tends to dazzle our eyes, and to make us forget God, and,
therefore, we ought to meditate with special attention upon this
doctrine, That whatever we possess, which seems worthy of being prized,
must not be permitted to obscure the knowledge of the power and grace of
God; but that, on the contrary, the glory of God ought always clearly to
shine forth in all the gifts with which he may be pleased to bless and
adorn us; so that we may account ourselves rich and happy in him, and no
where else.

<span id="xiv.ii-p1"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
48:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#004.md)<span id="xiv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p2"></span>**4**. For, behold! the kings assembled,
they passed away together. **5**. They saw, so they marvelled; they were
frightened, they fled precipitately. **6**. Fear  <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) seized upon them there, and pain as of

<span id="xiv.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiv.ii-p5"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p6"></span>**4** *For, behold! the kings assembled*
Here that special deliverance of which I have spoken is touched upon.
The prophet relates how, when the kings were assembled together to
destroy Jerusalem, their efforts passed away without producing any
effect, even as clouds in the atmosphere vanish away; yea, he tells us,
that by a simple look at the city, they were defeated and undone, and
that not after an ordinary manner, but like a woman who, when the hour
of child-birth has come upon her, finds herself suddenly afflicted with
pain and sorrow. We cannot affirm with certainty what particular part of
Jewish history the prophet here speaks of; but the statements made suit
very well both the time of Ahaz, and that of Hezekiah or Asa. It was
indeed a wonderful work of God, when two very powerful kings — the king
of Syria and the king of Israel, accompanied with an immense army — had
smitten the city with such terror, that the king and his people were
brought to the brink of despair, to see this formidable host suddenly
routed and disappointed of the certain expectation which they
entertained of making themselves masters of the city. Hence the prophet
<span id="xiv.ii-p6.1"></span>[Isa
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#004.md)<span id="xiv.ii-p6.1"></span>
ironically calls them “smoking firebrands,” because they were, so to
speak, burning torches to kindle and consume by fire the whole country
of Judea. Nor was the destruction of the countless host of Sennacherib
in one night by an angel, without the intervention of man’s agency, a
less stupendous miracle, (<span id="xiv.ii-p6.2"></span>[2Ki
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md)<span id="xiv.ii-p6.2"></span>;
<span id="xiv.ii-p6.3"></span>[Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036)<span id="xiv.ii-p6.3"></span>..md)
In like manner, when the king of Ethiopia gathered together an army of
ten hundred thousand men, and came to besiege Jerusalem, the overthrow
of so great a host was a memorable instance of the power of God, (<span
id="xiv.ii-p6.4"></span>[2Ch 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/ch2014.htm#009.md)<span
id="xiv.ii-p6.4"></span>.) But whatever was the occasion on which this
psalm was composed, the sacred writer informs us that the Jews found
from manifest experience that God was the guardian and protector of the
holy city, when he opposed himself to the invincible power of their
enemies. He first declares that *the kings assembled* By these words he
intimates that they had confederated and conspired together to destroy
the Church. The expression, *passed away together,* may be explained in
two ways; either as meaning that the armies when they had gathered
themselves together were reduced to nothing, or that they undertook
together, and with one consent, the expedition, as it were marshalled in
battle array.

<span id="xiv.ii-p7"></span>This second sense seems to me the most
suitable to the scope of the passage; for it follows immediately after
in the fifth verse, that they stood stricken with astonishment whenever
they saw the city; and yet there will be no impropriety in understanding
this verse as added by way of amplification. But as it affects very
little the substance of the passage which of these two interpretations
is adopted, I leave the reader to choose that which he considers the
most appropriate. When the Psalmist says that upon beholding the city
*they marvelled* — *were frightened* — *fled precipitately* — *and were
seized with sorrow, like the pangs of a woman in travail* — he heaps
together as many and varied expressions as possible, in order to set
forth the greatness of the miracle which God had wrought in the
overthrow of such a vast and formidable host. The language should be
resolved thus: As soon as they saw the city they marvelled. It is
related of Caesar in ancient times, that when speaking of the ease with
which he subdued Egypt, he made use of the laconic saying, “I came, I
saw, I conquered;” but the prophet here states, on the contrary, that
the ungodly were struck with amazement at the mere sight of the city, as
if God had dazzled their eyes with the splendor of his glory. The
particle <span id="xiv.ii-p7.1"></span>כן, *ken, so,* is put as it were
to show the thing by pointing to it with the finger. In the verse which
immediately follows, the adverb <span id="xiv.ii-p7.2"></span>שם, *sham,
there,* is used in the same sense. The comparison of *a woman in
travail* is intended to express the sudden change which came upon the
enemies of Israel. It afforded a more bright and illustrious
manifestation of the grace of God, that they were seized with a fear
which they had not anticipated, lost their courage all at once, and from
the height of secure and presumptuous pride, instantly fell into such a
state of terror, and were so confounded, that they precipitately betook
themselves to flight.  <span id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) From this
passage we are taught that it is no uncommon thing, if in our day the
Church is assailed by powerful adversaries, and has to sustain dreadful
assaults; for it has been God’s usual way from the beginning thus to
humble his own people, in order to give more irrefragable and striking
proofs of his wonderful power. At the same time, let us remember that a
nod alone on the part of God is sufficient to deliver us; and that,
although our enemies may be ready to fall upon us on every side to
overwhelm us, it is in his power, whenever he pleases, to strike them
with amazement of spirit, and thus to make their hearts fail in a moment
in the very midst of their efforts against us. Let this reflection serve
as a bridle to keep our minds from being drawn away, to look in all
directions for human aid.

<span id="xiv.ii-p9"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p10"></span>**7.** *By the east wind*  <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) *thou breakest in pieces the ships of
Tarshish* Commentators are divided in their view of this passage.  <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) But let us rest contented with the
natural sense, which is simply this, that the enemies of the Church were
overthrown and plunged into destruction, just as God by suddenly raising
storms sinks the ships of Cilicia to the bottom of the sea. The Psalmist
celebrates the power which God is accustomed to display in great and
violent storms; and his language implies that it is not to be wondered
at if God, who breaks by the violence of the winds the strongest
*ships,* had also overthrown his enemies, who were inflated with the
presumptuous confidence which they reposed in their own strength. By the
*sea of Tarshish* the Hebrews mean the Mediterranean Sea, because of the
country of Cilicia, which in ancient times was called *Tarshish,* as
Josephus informs us, although in process of time this name came to be
restricted to one city of the country. But as the chief part of the
naval traffic of the Jews was with Cilicia, there is here attributed to
that country by synecdoche what was common to other countries which were
at a greater distance and less known.

<span id="xiv.iii"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p1"></span><span id="xiv.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
48:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#008.md)<span id="xiv.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p2"></span>**8**. As we have heard, so have we seen in
the city of Jehovah of hosts, \[or armies,\] in the city of our God: God
will establish it for ever. Selah. **9**. O God! we have waited for thy
mercy in the midst of thy temple. **10**. As is thy name, O God! so is
thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of
righteousness.

<span id="xiv.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xiv.iii-p4"></span><span id="xiv.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p5"></span>**8.** *As we have heard, so have we seen.*
There are two senses in which this passage may be understood, either of
which is suitable. The first is, that the sacred writer, speaking in the
name of true believers, declares that the same power which God in the
days of old had displayed in delivering their fathers, he now exercised
towards their posterity. They had heard from the mouth of their fathers,
and had learned from sacred history, how God in his great mercy and
fatherly goodness had succoured his Church; but now they affirm that
they can bear testimony to this not only from their having heard it
spoken about, but also from having seen it,  <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) inasmuch as they had actually
experienced the same mercy exercised by God towards themselves. The
amount of what is stated then is, that the faithful not only had a
record of the goodness and power of God in histories, but that they also
felt by actual experience, yea, even saw with their eyes, what they knew
before by hearsay, and the report of their fathers; and that therefore
God continues unchangeably the same, confirming as he does, age after
age, the examples of his grace exhibited in ancient times, by renewed
and ever-recurring experiences. The other sense is somewhat more
refined; and yet it is very suitable, namely, That God actually
performed what he had promised to his people; as if the faithful had
said, that what they had before only heard of was now exhibited before
their eyes. As long as we have only the bare promises of God, his grace
and salvation are as yet hidden in hope; but when these promises are
actually performed, his grace and salvation are clearly manifested. If
this interpretation is admitted, it contains the rich doctrine, that God
does not disappoint the hope which he produces in our minds by means of
his word, and that it is not His way to be more liberal in promising
than faithful in performing what he has promised. When it is said, *in
the city,* the letter <span id="xiv.iii-p6.2"></span>ב, *beth,* is taken
for <span id="xiv.iii-p6.3"></span>מ, *mem,* or <span
id="xiv.iii-p6.4"></span>ל, *lamed;* that is to say, for *of*, or *as
to,* or *with respect to the city.* The prophet does not mean to say
that in Jerusalem the faithful were informed that God would succor his
servants, although this was no doubt true, but that God from the
beginning had been the gracious and faithful guardian of his own city,
and would continue always to be so. Mention is expressly made of *the
city of God,* because he has not promised to extend the same protecting
care to all indiscriminately, but only to his chosen and peculiar
people. The name *Jehovah of armies* is employed to express the power of
God; but immediately after the faithful add, that he is *their God,* for
the purpose of pointing to their adoption, that thus they may be
emboldened to trust in him, and thus to betake themselves freely and
familiarly to him. In the second Council of Nice, the good fathers who
sat there wrested this passage to prove that it is not enough to teach
divine truth in churches, unless there are at the same time pictures and
images for confirming it. This was a piece of silliness very shameful,
and unworthy of being mentioned, were it not that it is profitable for
us to understand that those who purposed to infect the Church of God
with such a corruption, were horribly stricken with a spirit of
giddiness and stupidity.

<span id="xiv.iii-p7"></span>The concluding clause of the verse
distinguishes Jerusalem from all the other cities of the world, which
are subject to vicissitudes, and flourish only for a time. As Jerusalem
was founded by God, it continued steadfast and unmoved amidst the varied
commotions and revolutions which took place in the world; and it is not
to be wondered at, if he continued through successive ages to maintain
the city of which he made choice, and in which it was his will that his
name should be called upon for ever. It may, however, be objected, that
this city was once destroyed, and the people carried into captivity. But
this does not militate against the statement here made; for, before that
event happened, the restoration of the city was foretold by <span
id="xiv.iii-p7.1"></span>[Jer
27:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#022.md)<span id="xiv.iii-p7.1"></span>;
and, therefore, when it took place, God truly, and in a special manner,
showed how steadfast his work was. And now, since Christ by his coming
has renewed the world, whatever was spoken of that city in old time
belongs to the spiritual Jerusalem, which is dispersed through all the
countries of the world. Whenever, therefore, our minds are agitated and
perplexed, we should call to remembrance the truth, that, whatever
dangers and apprehensions may threaten us, the safety of the Church
which God has established, although it may be sorely shaken, can never,
however powerfully assaulted, be so weakened as to fall and be involved
in ruin. The verb, which is in the future tense, *will establish,* may
be resolved into the past tense, *has established;* but this will make
no difference as to the sense.

<span id="xiv.iii-p8"></span><span id="xiv.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p9"></span>**9** *O God! we have waited for thy mercy*
This verse teaches us that the faithful were preserved by the power of
God; for, when all things were in a state of the greatest confusion,
they continued tranquil and patient until God at length, having pity
upon them, brought them help. The Hebrew word, <span
id="xiv.iii-p9.1"></span>דמם, *damam,* which we have rendered *to wait,*
properly signifies *to be silent,* and is here used to denote
tranquillity of mind. From this we conclude, that the people of God were
so harassed with dangers, that, had they listened to the judgment of
carnal sense and reason, they would have been overwhelmed with terror;
even as we know that men are in a state of continual uneasiness, and are
driven hither and thither by contrary waves, until faith tranquillise
their minds, and settle them in true patience. The amount of what the
Psalmist says is, that the faithful, although severely afflicted, were
not driven from their purpose, and prevented from relying upon the aid
of God; but that, on the contrary, by their patience and hope, they
opened the gate of his grace. It served to magnify and illustrate the
greatness of the grace of God, that their expectations of assistance
from him were not disappointed. From this we may also deduce the
profitable warning, that if the aid of God is withdrawn from us, it is
because we distrust his promises, and, by our impatience, prevent his
grace, which is laid up for those who wait in patience, from flowing
upon us. But what is meant by the expression, *In the midst of the
temple?* Is it that the people of God maintained their faith only in
that place, and that each of them ceased to hope as soon as he returned
to his own dwelling? No; on the contrary, it is certain that they
carried home with them the hope which they had entertained in the
temple, that they might continue steadfastly to abide by it. But God
having promised that this place, in which he would be called upon, would
be the seat and dwelling-place of his power and grace, his people here
affirm, that, relying upon this heavenly promise, they were persuaded
beyond all doubt that God would show himself merciful and gracious
towards them, since they had a real and sure pledge of his presence. We
must not conceive, merely because our own fancy suggests it, that God
will be our deliverer. We are to believe that he will be so only in so
far as he freely and willingly offers himself to us in this character.
Now, if this symbol or pledge of the presence of God, which was only a
shadow, ought to have had such influence upon the minds of true
believers under the former dispensation, as to make them hope for life
in the midst of death, surely when Christ has now descended amongst us,
to unite us much more closely to his Father, we have sufficient ground
for continuing in a state of undisturbed tranquillity, although the
world should be embroiled in confusion and turned upside down. Only it
must be our endeavor that the service of God may flourish pure and
entire amongst us, and that thus the glory of his temple may shine forth
in the midst of us.

<span id="xiv.iii-p10"></span><span id="xiv.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p11"></span>**10.** *As is thy name, O God! so is thy
praise* Some connect this verse with the preceding sentence, as if it
had been said, Lord, it is not in vain that thou hast enjoined upon us
the duty of celebrating thy name; for thou furnishest at the same time
matter of praise. Thus the sense will be, that the name of God is
magnified and extolled with effect, or that along with his promises his
power is at the same time manifested. Others give this exposition, which
is somewhat more refined, That the works of God correspond with his
name; for in Hebrew he is called, <span id="xiv.iii-p11.1"></span>אל,
*El,*  <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) from his power, and he
shows in very deed that this name is not applied to him in vain, but
that the praise which is ascribed to him by it is right and what is due
to him. The former exposition, as it is less forced, so it comes nearer
to the words and mind of the sacred writer, namely, that God bore
testimony by his works that it was not in vain that he was acknowledged
and worshipped by the Jews as the true and only God. Yet when I come to
consider the words which follow immediately after, *Unto the ends of the
earth,* I think that the prophet meant something else, — that he
intended to show, that wherever the fame of the name of God may be
spread, men will know that he is worthy of the highest praise. The words
contain a tacit contrast. At that time, the names of idols, it is well
known, were very common, and had sway through the whole world; and yet,
whatever fame these counterfeit gods had acquired, we know that praise
in no respect belonged to them, since no sign of divinity whatever could
be discovered about them. But here the prophet, on the contrary,
declares, Lord, in whatever part of the world thy name is heard, it will
always be accompanied with solid and rightful praise, or it will ever
carry along with it matter of praise, since the whole world will
understand how thou hast dealt with thy chosen people. What is added
immediately after is to the same purpose, *Thy right hand is full of
righteousness,* teaching us, that God, in succouring his own people,
clearly manifests his righteousness, as if he stretched forth his arm to
us that we might touch his righteousness with the finger; and that he
shows not only one specimen or two of his righteousness, but in every
thing and every where exhibits to us a complete proof of it. We ought to
bear in mind what we have stated elsewhere, that *the righteousness of
God* is to be understood of his faithfulness which he observes in
maintaining and defending his own people. From this there accrues to us
the inestimable comfort, that the work in which God especially desires
to be acknowledged as righteous consists in providing what belongs to
our welfare and to our maintenance in safety.  <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) We now see that the meaning of the
inspired poet is, That the names of false gods prevailed, and were
renowned among men, although they had done nothing to furnish matter of
true praise; but that it was altogether different with respect to the
God of Israel: for wherever the report of him was carried, all would
understand that he was the deliverer of his people, and that he did not
disappoint their hope and desires, nor forsake them in danger.

<span id="xiv.iv-p1"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
48:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#011.md)<span id="xiv.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p2"></span>**11**. Mount Zion shall rejoice, the
daughters  <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) of Judah shall be
glad, because of thy judgments. **12**. Encompass Zion, and go round
about her, number her towers. **13**. Set your hearts  <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) to her walls, exalt her towers,  <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) that ye may make report to the
generation to come. **14**. For this God is our God for ever and ever:
he will be our guide even unto death.

<span id="xiv.iv-p7"></span> 

<span id="xiv.iv-p8"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p9"></span>**11** *Mount Zion shall rejoice* The
Psalmist now concludes his exhortation to rejoicing, telling us that
Jerusalem and the other cities of Judea shall have cause to commend the
righteousness of God,  <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) because
they had found from undoubted experience that he was the protector of
their welfare. He here makes use of the word *judgment,* because God,
who undertook the cause of his Church, openly showed that he was the
enemy of her oppressors, and that he would repress their presumption and
audacity.

<span id="xiv.iv-p11"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p12"></span>**12** and **13** *Encompass Zion, etc.*
Here the prophet again commends the situation and beauty of Jerusalem,
intimating that the city was strongly fortified and impregnable; and he
does this, because in these external things the blessing of God in some
respect shone forth. We must always bear in mind what he stated in a
preceding verse, that “God in her palaces is known for a fortress.” In
making mention here of her *towers* and *walls,* we are not to suppose
that he would have the minds of the faithful to rest in these things. He
rather sets them before us as a mirror in which the character of God may
be seen. He therefore says, *Encompass Zion* that is, look upon it
carefully and attentively on every side*;* — *number her towers, and
apply your mind to consider her walls;* that is, estimate her palaces as
they deserve, and thus it will be manifest beyond all doubt that this is
a city chosen of God, seeing it far surpasses all other cities. In
insisting upon these points, his whole drift is to make manifest the
character with which the Lord had invested Jerusalem in making it a
sacred place, in which he himself might take up his abode, and in
erecting it as a dwelling-place for his people. It seems, moreover, that
the prophet, in stating that the object of his exhortation was, that the
beauty and magnificence of the holy city *might be reported* to the
succeeding generation, tacitly gives us to understand, that the time
would at length come when that city would be no longer seen. What need
would there be for making this report if it could be seen and were
always before the eyes of the world? Although, then, he has said a
little before that Jerusalem is established for ever, yet he now teaches
us, by way of correction, what kind of perpetuity it will be — that it
will endure only till the time of the renovation of the Church. We
belong to that generation to come, to whom it is said these things will
be reported; for we are sharers in all the benefits which God, in the
days of old, bestowed upon his ancient people. The outward splendor for
which Jerusalem was admired does not, indeed, stand forth conspicuous
amongst us at the present day; but since the coming of Christ into our
world, the Church has been no less richly and magnificently adorned with
spiritual gifts than Jerusalem, under the shadows of the Law, was in old
time surrounded and fortified with strong walls and towers. I have
translated the word <span id="xiv.iv-p12.1"></span>פסגו, *pasgu, exalt,*
referring it to the value which ought to be put upon the towers of the
city because of their excellence. To explain it, as is done by some,
*fortify* or *strengthen,* seems to be less suitable. If any are
inclined rather to follow the interpretation of those who render it
*look upon* or *behold,* I have no great objection to it.

<span id="xiv.iv-p13"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p14"></span>**14.** *For this God is our God for ever
and ever* From these words it appears still more clearly, that when the
prophet spake of the palaces of Jerusalem, it was not that the godly
should keep their eyes fixed upon them, but that by the aid of these
outward things they should elevate their minds to the contemplation of
the glory of God. God would have them to behold, as it were, the marks
of his grace engraven wherever they turned themselves, or rather, to
recognize him as present in these marks. From this we conclude, that
whatever dignity or excellence shines forth in the Church, we are not to
consider it otherwise than as the means of presenting God to our view,
that we may magnify and praise him in his gifts. The demonstrative
pronoun <span id="xiv.iv-p14.1"></span>זה, *zeh, this,* is not
superfluous; it is put to distinguish the only true God, of whose
existence and character the faithful were fully persuaded, from all the
false gods which men have set themselves to invent. The unbelieving may
boldly speak of the name of God, and prate about religion; but however
much they may do this, when they are more closely questioned, it will be
found that they have nothing certain or settled on the subject. Yea, the
vain imaginations and inventions of those who are not grounded in the
true faith must necessarily come to nothing. It is, then, the property
of faith to set before us not a confused but a distinct knowledge of
God, and such as may not leave us wavering, as superstition leaves its
votaries, which, we know, is always introducing some new counterfeit
deities and in countless numbers. We ought, therefore, so much the more
to mark the emphatic demonstrative pronoun *this,* which is here used.
We meet with an almost similar passage in the prophecies of Isaiah,

<span id="xiv.iv-p15"></span>“Lo, this is our God; we have waited for
him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we
will be glad and rejoice in his salvation:”— <span
id="xiv.iv-p15.1"></span>[Isa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009.md)<span id="xiv.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p16"></span> as if the faithful had protested and
declared, We have not an uncertain God, or a God of whom we have only a
confused and an indistinct apprehension, but one of whom we have a true
and solid knowledge. When the faithful here declare that God will
continue unchangeably steadfast to his purpose in maintaining his
Church, their object is to encourage and strengthen themselves to
persevere in a continued course of faith. What follows immediately
after, *He will be our guide even unto death,* seems to be added by way
of exposition. In making this statement, the people of God assure
themselves that he will be their guide and keeper for ever. They are not
to be understood as meaning that they will be safe under the government
and conduct of God in this life only, and that he will abandon them in
the midst of death; but they express generally, and according to the
common people’s way of speaking,  <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) what I have stated, that God will take
care of all who rely upon him even to the end. What we translate, *Even
unto death,* consists of two words in the Hebrew text, <span
id="xiv.iv-p17.2"></span>אל מות, *al muth;* but some read in one word,
<span id="xiv.iv-p17.3"></span>אלמות, *almuth,* and take it for *age or
eternity*  <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) The sense, however,
will be the same whether we read the one way or the other. Others
translate it *childhood,*  <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) in
this sense, As God has from the beginning carefully preserved and
maintained his Church, even as a father brings up his children from
their infancy, so he will continue to act in the same manner. The first
sense, however, in my opinion, is the more appropriate. Others translate
it *in secret* or *hidden,*  <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md)
which seems equally remote from the meaning of the prophet; unless,
perhaps, we should understand him as intending expressly to say, that
God’s way of exercising his government is hidden, that we may not
measure or judge of it by carnal reason, but by faith.

Hence the LXX. translate the original words, “<span
id="xiv.ii-p11.8"></span>Εν πνευματι βιαίω,” “With a violent wind;” and
the Chaldee reads, “A strong east wind as a fire from before the Lord.”
“Such a wind,” says Bishop Mant, “is well known to the modern mariner by
the name of *Levanter*, and is of the same kind as that spoken of in the
twenty-seventh chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, under the name of
Euroclydon.”

<span id="xiv.ii-p12"></span> It is supposed by some that there is in it
an implied similitude; the particle of similitude used in the preceding
verse being understood. Thus French and Skinner translate the 6th and
7th verses — “Then did trembling seize upon them — Pangs as of a woman
in travail — As when with a stormy wind, Thou breakest in pieces the
ships of Tarshish.” According to this translation, “the ships of
Tarshish” do not refer to an invading army, nor “the breaking in pieces
of them” to an actual storm which had this effect; but the sacred writer
employs another figure, the more vividly to describe the terror which
seized upon these confederate powers. He had in the preceding verse
compared it with the pangs of a woman in travail; and here he compares
it to the trembling which seized upon mariners when the fury of the east
wind, which shattered in pieces the largest and strongest vessels, as
the ships of Tarshish probably then were, was let loose upon them.

is set forth in that psalm. Others, who read <span

consider them also as belonging to the inscription of the following
psalm, observing that there can be no propriety in saying — *ever and
ever* — *unto death* Merrick, however, remarks, “The words *for ever and
ever*, and *unto death*, seem to me very consistent, as they relate to
different propositions: This God will be our God to all eternity, and
(by that power which he has already thus exerted in our protection) will
conduct us through life with safety.”
