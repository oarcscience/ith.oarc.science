<span id="xxi-p1"></span>PSALM 55

<span id="xxi-p2"></span>Many interpreters have thought that this psalm
refers to the conspiracy of Absalom, by which David was driven from the
throne, and forced to take refuge under circumstances of great distress
in the wilderness. But it seems rather to have been written at a period
when he was reduced to extreme danger by the persecutions of Saul. It is
a prayer, expressive of the deepest distress, and full of fervor, urging
every consideration which could be supposed to solicit the compassion of
God. After having disburdened his sorrows and given utterance to his
requests, the Psalmist contemplates the prospect of deliverance, and
offers thanksgivings to God as if he had already obtained it.

<span id="xxi.i-p1"></span><span id="xxi.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
55:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#001.md)<span id="xxi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p2"></span>**1**. Give ear to my prayer, O God! and hide
not thyself from my supplication. **2**. Attend unto me, and answer me.
I will wail  <span id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) in my address,
 <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) and make a noise.  <span
id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) **3**. By reason of the voice of the
enemy, under the affliction of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon
me, and in wrath they fight against me.

<span id="xxi.i-p6"></span> 

<span id="xxi.i-p7"></span><span id="xxi.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p8"></span>**1.** *Give ear to my prayer, O God!* From
the language with which the psalm opens, we may conclude that David at
this time was laboring under heavy distress. It could be no ordinary
amount of it which produced such an overwhelming effect upon a saint of
his distinguished courage. The translation which has been given of <span
id="xxi.i-p8.1"></span>אריד, *arid, I will prevail,* does violence to
the context, for, so far from boasting of the fortitude which would
govern his address, he is anxious to convey an impression of his
wretchedness, by intimating that he was constrained to cry out aloud.
What is added in the third verse, *By reason of the voice of the enemy,*
may be viewed as connected either with the first verse or that
immediately preceding, or with both. By the *voice* some understand such
a noise as is occasioned by a multitude of men; as if he had said, that
the enemy was mustering many troops against him: but he rather alludes
to the threatenings which we may suppose that Saul was in the habit of
venting upon this innocent prophet. The interpretation, too, which has
been given of the *casting of iniquity* upon him, as if it meant that
his enemies loaded him with false accusations, is strained, and scarcely
consistent with the context. The words are designed to correspond with
the succeeding clause, where it is said that *his enemies fought against
him in wrath;* and, therefore, *to cast iniquity upon him* means, in my
opinion, no more than to discharge their unjust violence upon him for
his destruction, or iniquitously to plot his ruin. If any distinction be
intended between the two clauses, perhaps the *fighting against him in
wrath* may refer to their open violence, and *the casting of iniquity
upon him*  <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md) to their deceitful
treachery. In this case, <span id="xxi.i-p9.1"></span>און, *aven,* which
I have rendered *iniquity,* will signify hidden malice. The *affliction
of the wicked* is here to be understood in the active sense of
persecution. And in applying the term *wicked* to his enemies, he does
not so much level an accusation against them as implicitly assert his
own innocence. Our greatest comfort under persecution is conscious
rectitude, the reflection that we have not deserved it; for there
springs from this the hope that we will experience the help of the Lord,
who is the shield and defense of the distressed.

<span id="xxi.ii"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
55:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#004.md)<span id="xxi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii-p2"></span>**4**. My heart trembles within me, and the
terrors of death have fallen upon me. **5**. Fearfulness and trembling
are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. **6**. And I said, Who
will give me wings like a dove? I will fly away, and be at rest. **7**.
Lo! I will prolong the flight,  <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md)
I will repose in the wilderness. Selah. **8**. I will hasten a
deliverance for me,  <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) from the
wind raised by the whirlwind.

<span id="xxi.ii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxi.ii-p6"></span><span id="xxi.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii-p7"></span>**4.** *My heart trembles within me*  <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) Here we have additional evidence of
the extremity of David’s sufferings. He that uses these words was no
soft or effeminate person, but one who had given indubitable proofs of
constancy. Nor is it merely of the atrocious injuries inflicted upon him
by his enemies that he complains. He exclaims that he is overwhelmed
with terrors, and thus acknowledges that his heart was not insensible to
his afflictions. We may learn from the passage, therefore, not only that
the sufferings which David endured at this time were heavy, but that the
fortitude of the greatest servants of God fails them in the hour of
severe trial. We are all good soldiers so long as things go well with
us, but when brought to close combat, our weakness is soon apparent.
Satan avails himself of the advantage, suggests that God has withdrawn
the supports of his Spirit, and instigates us to despair. Of this we
have an example in David, who is here represented as struggling with
inward fears, as well as a complication of outward calamities, and
sustaining a sore conflict of spirit in his application to the throne of
God. The expression, *terrors of death,* shows that he was on the very
eve of sinking unless Divine grace interposed.

<span id="xxi.ii-p9"></span><span id="xxi.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii-p10"></span>**6** *And I said, Who will give me wings
like a dove?*  <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) These words mean
more than merely that he could find no mode of escape. They are meant to
express the deplorableness of his situation, which made exile a blessing
to be coveted, and this not the common exile of mankind, but such as
that of the dove when it flies far off to some deserted hiding-place.
They imply that he could only escape by a miracle. They intimate that
even the privilege of retreat by common banishment was denied him, so
that it fared worse with him than with the poor bird of heaven, which
can at least fly from its pursuer. Some think that the dove is singled
out on account of its swiftness. The Jews held the ridiculous idea that
the Hebrew reads *wing* in the singular number, because doves use but
one wing in flying; whereas nothing is more common in Scripture than
such a change of number. It seems most probable that David meant by this
comparison, that he longed to escape from his cruel enemies, as the
timid and defenseless dove flies from the hawk. Great, indeed, must have
been the straits to which he was reduced, when he could so far forget
the promise made to him of the kingdom as, in the agitation of his
spirits, to contemplate a disgraceful flight, and speak of being content
to hide himself far from his native country, and the haunts of human
society, in some solitude of the wilderness. Nay, he adds, as if by way
of concession to the fury of his adversaries, that he was willing (would
they grant it) *to wander far off,* that he was not proposing terms of
truce to them which he never meant to fulfill, merely to gain time, as
those will do who entertain some secret and distant hope of deliverance.
We may surely say that these are the words of a man driven to the
borders of desperation. Such was the extremity in which he stood, that
though prepared to abandon all, he could not obtain life even upon that
condition. In such circumstances, in the anguish of this anxiety, we
must not wonder that his heart was overwhelmed with the sorrows of
death. The Hebrew word <span id="xxi.ii-p13.3"></span>סועה, *soah,*
which I have rendered *raised,* is by some translated *tempestuous;* and
there can be no doubt that the Psalmist means a stormy wind raised by a
whirlwind. When he says that this wind *is raised by the whirlwind,*
 <span id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300.md) by this circumlocution he means
a violent wind, such as compels the traveler to fly and seek shelter in
the nearest dwelling or covert.

<span id="xxi.iii"></span>

<span id="xxi.iii-p1"></span><span id="xxi.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
55:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#009.md)<span id="xxi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.iii-p2"></span>**9**. Destroy, O Lord! and divide their
tongue: for I have seen persecution and strife in the city. **10**. Day
and night they go about it upon the walls thereof labouring also, and
sorrow, are in the midst of it. **11**. Wickedness  <span
id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) is in the midst thereof; deceit and
guile depart not from her streets.

<span id="xxi.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxi.iii-p5"></span><span id="xxi.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.iii-p6"></span>**9.** *Destroy,*  <span
id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) *O Lord; and divide their tongue*
Having now composed, as it were, his mind, he resumes the exercise of
prayer. Had he indulged longer in the strain of complaint, he might have
given his sanction to the folly of those who do themselves more harm
than good by the excessive use of this barren species of comfort. There
will occasionally escape from the lips of a saint, when he prays, some
complaining exclamations which cannot be altogether justified, but he
soon recalls himself to the exercise of believing supplication. In the
expression, *divide their tongue,* there seems an allusion to the
judgment which fell upon the builders of Babel, (<span
id="xxi.iii-p7.2"></span>[Ge 31:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#007.md)<span
id="xxi.iii-p7.2"></span>.) He means in general to pray that God would
break their criminal confederacies, and distract their impious counsels,
but evidently with an indirect reference to that memorable proof which
God gave of his power to thwart the designs of the wicked by confounding
their communication. It is thus that to this day he weakens the enemies
of the Church, and splits them into factions, through the force of
mutual animosities, rivalries, and disagreements in opinion. For his own
encouragement in prayer, the Psalmist proceeds to insist upon the
wickedness and malignity of his adversaries, this being a truth never to
be lost sight of, that just in proportion as men grow rampant in sin,
may it be anticipated that the divine judgments are about to descend
upon them. From the unbridled license prevailing amongst them, he
comforts himself with the reflection that the deliverance of God cannot
be far distant; for he visits the proud, but gives more grace to the
humble. Before proceeding to pray for divine judgments against them, he
would intimate that he had full knowledge of their evil and injurious
character. Interpreters have spent an unnecessary degree of labor in
determining whether the *city* here spoken of was that of Jerusalem or
of Keilah, for David by this term would appear merely to denote the open
and public prevalence of crime in the country. The *city* stands opposed
to places more hidden and obscure, and he insinuates that strife was
practiced with unblushing publicity. Granting that the city meant was
the metropolis of the kingdom, this is no reason why we should not
suppose that the Psalmist had in his view the general state of the
country; but the term is, in my opinion, evidently employed in an
indefinite sense, to intimate that such wickedness as is generally
committed in secret was at that time openly and publicly perpetrated. It
is with the same view of marking the aggravated character of the
wickedness then reigning in the nation, that he describes their crimes
as going about the walls, keeping sentry or watch, so to speak, upon
them. Walls are supposed to protect a city from rapine and incursion,
but he complains that this order of things was inverted — that the city,
instead of being surrounded with fortifications, was beset with strife
and oppression, or that these had possession of the walls, and went
about them.  <span id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) I have already
commented elsewhere upon the words <span id="xxi.iii-p8.1"></span>און,
*aven,* and <span id="xxi.iii-p8.2"></span>עמל, *amal.* In announcing
that *wickedness was in the midst* of the city, and *deceit and guile*
in her streets, he points to the true source of the prevailing crimes;
even as it was to be expected that those who were inwardly corrupt, and
given to such mischievous devices, would indulge in violence, and in
persecuting the poor and defenseless. In general, he is to be considered
as adverting in this passage to the deplorable confusions which marked
the government of Saul, when justice and order were in a manner banished
from the realm. And whether his description were intended to apply to
one city or to many, matters had surely reached a portentous crisis in a
nation professing the true religion, when any of their cities had thus
become a den of robbers. It may be observed, too, that David, in
denouncing a curse, as he does in the psalm before us, upon cities of
this description, was obviously borne out by what must have been the
judgment of the Holy Spirit against them.

<span id="xxi.iv"></span>

<span id="xxi.iv-p1"></span><span id="xxi.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
55:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#012.md)<span id="xxi.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.iv-p2"></span>**12.** Of a truth, it was not an enemy that
cast reproach upon me, for then I could have borne it:  <span
id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) it was not an adversary that did
magnify himself against me, for then I would have hid  <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md) myself from him. **13**. But it was
thou, a man of mine own order, my leader, and mine acquaintance. **14**.
We sweetly exchanged our most secret thoughts;  <span
id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) we walked into the house of God in
company. **15**. Let death seize upon them, let them descend alive into
the grave for wickedness is in their dwelling, and in the midst of them.

<span id="xxi.iv-p6"></span> 

<span id="xxi.iv-p7"></span><span id="xxi.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.iv-p8"></span>**12** *Of a truth, it was not an enemy that
cast reproach upon me* He informs us of one circumstance which added
bitterness to the injuries under which he suffered, that they came from
the hands not only of his professed enemies, but of such as pretended to
be his friends. Those mistake the meaning of <span
id="xxi.iv-p8.1"></span>נשא, *nasa,* who interpret it as if David had
said, that he *could patiently have borne* the reproach of an open
enemy. What he says is, that had an open enemy reproached him, he could
then have *met it,* as one meets and parries off a blow which is aimed
at him. Against a known foe we are on our watch, but the unsuspected
stroke of a friend takes us by surprise. By adopting this view of the
word, we shall find that the repetition in the verse is more perfect;
reading in the one member, *I* *would have met it;* and in the other, *I
would have hidden myself* When he speaks of the enemy *magnifying
himself against him,* he does not simply mean that he used insulting
language, but in general, that he summoned all his violence to overthrow
him. The sum of David’s complaint in this passage is, that he was
assailed by treachery of that secret description which rendered
self-defense impossible. With regard to the individual whom he had
particularly in view, when he preferred this accusation, I do not
imagine that it was Ahitophel, for the psalm itself would not appear to
have been written upon the persecution of Absalom. Whether it may have
been some notorious traitor in the city of Keilah, it is impossible to
determine. Not the least probable conjecture is, that it may have been
some great man at court, whose intimacy with David was generally known.
Possibly he may have had more than one in his eye, courtiers who had
sacrificed former friendship to a desire of rising in the royal favor,
and lent their influence to destroy him. These, with some more eminent
person at their head, may be the parties aimed at. At any rate, we are
taught by the experience of David, as here represented to us, that we
must expect in this world to meet with the secret treachery of friends,
as well as with undisguised persecution. Satan has assaulted the Church
with sword and open war, but he has also raised up domestic enemies to
injure it with the more secret weapons of stratagem and fraud. This is a
species of foe which, as Bernard expresses it, we can neither fly from
nor put to flight. Whoever might be the individual referred to, David
calls him a man of *his own order,* for so the term <span
id="xxi.iv-p8.2"></span>ערך, *erach,* should, in my opinion, be
translated, and not as some, *his equal in estimation,* or as by others,
a man *esteemed by him to be his second self.*  <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) He complains of the violation of the
common bond of fraternity, as none needs to be told that there are
various bonds, whether of relationship, profession, or office, which
ought to be respected and held sacred. He makes mention also of his
having been his *leader* and commander, of their having enjoyed sweet
interchange of secret counsel together, and of their having frequented
the religious assemblies in company, — all of which he adverts to as
circumstances which lent an additional aggravation to his treachery. The
term <span id="xxi.iv-p9.5"></span>רגש  <span
id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) , *regesh,* does not seem to signify
here *the stir attending the convention of an assembly,* but rather
*company,* intimating, that he was his close companion when they went to
the house of God. Thus he would inform us, that he was betrayed by one
who had been his intimate associate, and to whom he had looked up as a
leader, in matters not only secular but religious. We are taught by the
Spirit to reverence all the natural ties which bind us together in
society. Besides the common and universal one of humanity, there are
others of a more sacred kind, by which we should feel ourselves attached
to men in proportion as they are more nearly connected with us than
others by neighborhood, relationship, or professional calling, the more
as we know that such connections are not the result of chance, but of
providential design and arrangement. Need I say that the bond of
religious fellowship is the most sacred of all?

<span id="xxi.iv-p11"></span><span id="xxi.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.iv-p12"></span>**15** *Let death seize upon them.* He now
denounces the whole faction, not the nation generally, but those who had
taken a prominent part in the persecution of him. In imprecating this
curse he was not influenced by any bad feeling towards them, and must be
understood as speaking not in his own cause but in that of God, and
under the immediate guidance of his Spirit. This was no wish uttered in
a moment of resentment or of reckless and ill-considered zeal, and which
would justify us in launching maledictions against our enemies upon
every trivial provocation. The spirit of revenge differs widely from the
holy and regulated fervor with which David prays for the judgment of God
against wicked men, who had already been doomed to everlasting
destruction. The translation, *Let death condemn them,* is forced, and
so also is another which has been suggested, *Let him appoint death a
creditor over them.*  <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) That which
we have given is the most obvious and simple. In praying that his
enemies may *descend alive into the grave,* it has been well observed,
that he seems to allude to the punishment of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram;
though I conceive that in imprecating sudden and unexpected ruin upon
them, he adverts to the proud persuasion which they cherished in their
prosperity, that they would escape the stroke of death. “Lord,” as if he
had said, “in the infatuation of their pride they consider themselves to
be exempted from the ordinary lot of mortality, but let the earth
swallow them up alive — let nothing prevent their being dragged down
with all their pomp to the destruction which they deserve.” The cause
which he assigns for his prayer in the latter part of the verse, is
another proof that he was not influenced by any personal resentment
against his enemies, but simply denounced the just judgments of God upon
such as persecuted the Church. *Wickedness,* he adds, *is in their
dwelling* By this he meant that it could not but dwell where they dwelt
and this he expresses still more fully when he adds, *in the midst of
them;* intimating, that they inwardly cherished their wickedness, so
that it was their inseparable companion, and dwelt with them under the
same roof.

<span id="xxi.v"></span>

<span id="xxi.v-p1"></span><span id="xxi.v-p1.1"></span>[Psalm

<span id="xxi.v-p2"></span>**16**. I will call upon God, and Jehovah

<span id="xxi.v-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxi.v-p6"></span><span id="xxi.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.v-p7"></span>**16** *I will call upon God.* In translating
this verse I have retained the future tense of the verb, as the Psalmist
does not refer to something already done, but rather excites himself to
the duty of prayer, and to the exercise of hope and confidence. Though
there was no apparent method of escape, and he stood on the brink of
immediate destruction, he declares his resolution to continue in prayer,
and expresses his assurance that it would be successful. In the verse
which follows he engages more particularly to show perseverance in
prayer. He does not content himself with saying that he will pray, for
many do this in a perfunctory manner, and soon become wearied with the
exercise; but he resolves to display both assiduity and vehemency. From
the particular mention he makes of *evening, morning,* and *noon,* we
are left to infer that these must have been the stated hours of prayer
amongst the godly at that period. Sacrifices were offered daily in the
temple morning and evening, and by this they were taught to engage
privately in prayer within their own houses. At noon also it was the
practice to offer additional sacrifices. As we are naturally indisposed
for the duty of prayer, there is a danger that we may become remiss, and
gradually omit it altogether, unless we restrict ourselves to a certain
rule. In appointing particular fixed hours to be observed for his
worship, there can be no doubt that God had respect to the infirmity of
our nature, and the same principle should be applied to the secret as to
the public services of devotion, as appears from the passage now before
us, and from the example of Daniel, (<span id="xxi.v-p7.1"></span>[Da
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#003)<span id="xxi.v-p7.1"></span>..md)
Sacrifices are no longer to be observed in the Church, but as there
remains the same indisposition on our part to the duty, and an equal
need of incitements to overcome it, we should still prescribe certain
hours to ourselves to be observed in prayer. He adds, that he would *cry
aloud,* to denote vehemency of supplication, under the grief and anxiety
of mind to which he was subjected. He intimates, that no extremity of
present trouble would prevent him from directing his complaint to God,
and cherishing a confident hope of deliverance.

<span id="xxi.v-p8"></span><span id="xxi.v-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.v-p9"></span>**18** *He hath redeemed my soul into peace*
Those who read the two preceding verses in the perfect instead of the
future tense, are apparently led to this by considering that David here
proves his former prayers to have been answered, from the fact of
deliverance having been granted. But there is no difficulty involved in
adopting the other reading. We may suppose that either he was so
confident of being delivered that he speaks as if he actually were so
already, or that he inserts what was the substance of his meditations at
different times; it being sufficiently common, when mention is made of
prayers, to subjoin a statement of the event which followed from them.
Having spoken, then, of his prayers, he adverts to the result of them,
with the view of expressing his thankfulness for the mercy which he had
received. He says that he had been *redeemed into peace* — a strong
expression, signifying the danger to which he had been exposed, and the
almost miraculous manner in which he had been delivered from it. What is
added, *they were in great numbers with me,* admits of a double meaning.
Some understand him as referring to enemies; *with me* being, according
to them, equivalent to *against me. He* represents himself as having
been beset, by a host of adversaries, and commends the goodness
manifested by God in accomplishing his deliverance. Others think that he
refers to the angels, whose hosts are encamped round about those that
fear the Lord, (<span id="xxi.v-p9.1"></span>[Ps
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007)<span id="xxi.v-p9.1"></span>..md)
The letter <span id="xxi.v-p9.2"></span>ב, *beth,* which I have rendered
*in,* they consider to be here, as in many other places, merely
expletive;  <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) so that we may read
the words, *great numbers were with me.* The last of these
interpretations conveys a comfortable truth, as God, although he cannot
stand in need of auxiliaries, has seen fit, in accommodation to our
infirmity, to employ a multitude of them in the accomplishment of our
salvation. But David would appear rather to speak of enemies, and to
refer to the number of them, with the view of magnifying the deliverance
which he had received.  <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md)

<span id="xxi.v-p13"></span><span id="xxi.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.v-p14"></span>**19** *God shall hear, and afflict them* As
the verb <span id="xxi.v-p14.1"></span>ענה, *anah,* which I have
rendered *afflict,* signifies, occasionally, *to testify,* some
understand David to say that God would rise up as a witness against
them. The syntax of the language will scarcely, however, admit of this,
as, in Hebrew, the letter <span id="xxi.v-p14.2"></span>ב, *beth,* is
generally subjoined in such a case. There seems no doubt that the word
signifies here *to addict* or *punish,* although this is rather its
signification implicitly and by a species of irony; for, most commonly,
<span id="xxi.v-p14.3"></span>ענה, *anah,* means *to answer.* Having
said that God would hear him, he adds that he would answer him, in the
way of avenging his cause, in the punishment of his enemies. The
epithet, or descriptive title, which he applies to God, is one
calculated to comfort the pious mind in times of trouble and confusion.
Much of that impatience into which we are hurried arises from not
elevating our thoughts to the eternity of God. Can anything be more
unreasonable than that poor mortals, who pass away like a shadow, should
measure God by their feeble apprehensions, which is to cast him down
from his eternal throne, and subject him to the fluctuations of a
changing world? As <span id="xxi.v-p14.4"></span>חלף*, chalaph,* may
signify *to cut off* as well as *to change,* some have supposed that
David here complains of the destruction of the wicked having been too
long deferred; but this is not a probable interpretation. The term has
been more properly rendered *changes* But even those who have adopted
this rendering have varied in the sense of the passage.  <span
id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) Some understand it to mean that no
change to the better was to be expected in their character; that they
were so bent upon evil as to be inflexible to repentance; so entirely
under the influence of a cruel disposition, as never once to incline to
humanity or mercy. Others, with more reason, consider that he refers, in
the language of complaint, to the uninterrupted flow of their
prosperity, which was such that they seemed exempt from the common
vicissitudes of life. He represents them as being corrupted by this
indulgence, and casting off from their minds every principle of fear, as
if they were privileged with immunity from mortal ills. The copulative
particle will thus carry the force of a consequence — *they have no
changes, and therefore they fear not God*  <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) It is an undeniable truth, that the
longer the wicked are left in the enjoyment of their pleasures, they are
only hardened the more in their evil courses; and that where pride has
the ascendancy in the heart, the effect of the Divine indulgence is to
make us forget that we are men. In the connection between the two parts
of the verse there is an implied censure of the infatuation of those who
are led by their exemption from adversity to conclude that. they are a
species of demigods; for, how insignificant is the course of human life
when compared with the eternity of God? We have need to be upon our
guard when under prosperity, lest we fall into the secure spirit which
the Psalmist here alludes to, and even carry our exultation to the
extent of a defiance of the Almighty.

<span id="xxi.vi-p2"></span>**20**. He hath sent his hands against those
that were at peace with him:  <span id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md) he

half their days: but I will hope in thee.

<span id="xxi.vi-p6"></span> 

<span id="xxi.vi-p7"></span><span id="xxi.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.vi-p8"></span>**20.** *He hath sent his hands against
those that were at peace with him* He afterwards speaks in verse 23d in
the plural number, but here it is probable that he begins by addressing
the leader and head of the wicked conspiracy. He accuses him of waging
war in the midst of peace, and being thus guilty of a breach of faith.
He had neither suffered provocation, nor had he announced in an open
manner his intention to give battle, but had commenced the attack
unexpectedly and with treachery. The same charge is insisted upon still
further, when it is added, that butter and oil were in his lips, while
war was in his heart, and his words themselves were darts. To appearance
they were soft and agreeable, but they covered a hidden virulence and
cruelty which wounded like a sword or like darts,  <span
id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) according to the common proverb, that
deceivers carry on their lips poison besmeared with honey. It is well
known how many fair promises and flatteries Saul addressed to David with
a view to entrap him, and we may conjecture that the same arts were
practiced by his courtiers. It is one special trial of the Lord’s
people, that they are exposed to such attempts on the part of crafty men
to seduce them into destruction. Here the Holy Spirit puts a mark of
reprobation upon all subtilty of this kind, and particularly upon
treacherous flatteries, exhorting us to cultivate simplicity of
intention.

<span id="xxi.vi-p10"></span><span id="xxi.vi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.vi-p11"></span>**22** *Cast thy giving upon Jehovah.* The
Hebrew verb <span id="xxi.vi-p11.1"></span>יהב, *yahab,* signifies *to
give,* so that <span id="xxi.vi-p11.2"></span>יהבע, *yehobcha,*
according to the ordinary rules of grammar, should be rendered *thy
giving,* or *thy gift.*  <span id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) Most
interpreters read *thy burden,* but they assign no reason for this
rendering. The verb <span id="xxi.vi-p12.5"></span>יהב, *yahab,* never
denotes *to burden,* and there is no precedent which might justify us in
supposing that the noun deduced from it can mean *a burden.* They have
evidently felt themselves compelled to invent that meaning from the
harshness and apparent absurdity of the stricter translation, *Cast thy
gift upon Jehovah.* And I grant that the sentiment they would express is
a pious one, that we ought to disburden ourselves before God of all the
cares and troubles which oppress us. There is no other method of
relieving our anxious souls, but by reposing ourselves upon the
providence of the Lord. At the same time, I find no example of such a
translation of the word, and adhere therefore to the other, which
conveys sufficiently important instruction, provided we understand the
expression *gift* or *giving* in a passive sense, as meaning all the
benefits which we desire God to give us. The exhortation is to the
effect that we should resign into the hands of God the care of those
things which may concern our advantage. It is not enough that we make
application to God for the supply of our wants. Our desires and
petitions must be offered up with a due reliance upon his providence,
for how many are there who pray in a clamorous spirit, and who, by the
inordinate anxiety and restlessness which they evince, seem resolved to
dictate terms to the Almighty. In opposition to this, David recommends
it as a due part of modesty in our supplications, that we should
transfer to God the care of those things which we ask, and there can be
no question that the only means of checking an excessive impatience is
an absolute submission to the Divine will, as to the blessings which
should be bestowed. Some would explain the passage: Acknowledge the past
goodness of the Lord to have been such, that you ought to hope in his
kindness for the future. But this does not give the genuine meaning of
the words. As to whether David must be considered as here exhorting
himself or others, it is a question of little moment, though he seems
evidently, in laying down a rule for his own conduct, to prescribe one
at the same time to all the children of God. The words which he
subjoins, *And he shall feed thee,* clearly confirm that view of the
passage which I have given above. Subject as we are in this life to
manifold wants, we too often yield ourselves up to disquietude and
anxiety. But David assures us that God will sustain to us the part of a
shepherd, assuming the entire care of our necessities, and supplying us
with all that is really for our advantage. He adds, that *he will not
suffer the righteous to fall, or always to stagger* If <span
id="xxi.vi-p12.6"></span>מוט, *mot,* be understood as meaning *a fall,*
then the sense will run: God shall establish the righteous that he shall
never fall. But the other rendering seems preferable. We see that the
righteous for a time are left to stagger, and almost to sink under the
storms by which they are beset. From this distressing state David here
declares, that they shall be eventually freed, and blessed with a
peaceful termination of all their harassing dangers and cares.

<span id="xxi.vi-p13"></span><span id="xxi.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.vi-p14"></span>**23** *Thou, O God! shalt cast them into
the pit of corruption.* He returns to speak of his enemies, designing to
show the very different end which awaits them, from that which may be
expected by the righteous. The only reflection which comforts the
latter, when cast down at the feet of their oppressors, is, that they
can confidently look for a peaceful issue to the dangers which encompass
them; while, on the other hand, they can discern by faith the certain
destruction which impends the wicked. The Hebrew word <span
id="xxi.vi-p14.1"></span>שחת, *shachath,* signifies *the grave,* and as
there seems an impropriety in saying that they are cast into the *pit of
the grave,* some read in preference *the pit of corruption,*  <span
id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md) the word being derived from <span
id="xxi.vi-p15.1"></span>שחת*, shachath, to corrupt,* or *destroy.* It
is a matter of little consequence which signification be adopted; one
thing is obvious, that David means to assert that they would be
overtaken not only by a temporary, but everlasting destruction. And here
he points at a distinction between them and the righteous. These may
sink into many a deep pit of worldly calamity, but they arise again. The
ruin which awaits their enemies is here declared to be deadly, as God
will cast them into the grave, that they may rot there. In calling them
*bloody men,*  <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) he adverts to a
reason which confirmed the assertion he had made. The vengeance of God
is certain to overtake the cruel and the deceitful; and this being the
character of his adversaries, he infers that their punishment would be
inevitable. “But does it consist,” may some ask, “with what passes under
our observation, that *bloody men live not half their days?* If the
character apply to any, it must with peculiar force to tyrants, who
consign their fellow-creatures to slaughter, for the mere gratification
of their licentious passions. To such very evidently, and not to common
murderers, does the Psalmist refer in this place; and yet will not
tyrants, who have butchered their hundreds of thousands, reach
frequently an advanced period of life?” They may; but notwithstanding
instances of this description, where God has postponed the execution of
judgment, the assertion of the Psalmist is borne out by many
considerations. With regard to temporal judgments, it is enough that we
see them executed upon the wicked, in the generality of cases, for a
strict or perfect distribution in this matter is not to be expected, as
I have shown at large upon the thirty-seventh psalm. Then the life of
the wicked, however long it may be protracted, is agitated by so many
fears and disquietudes, that it scarcely merits the name, and may be
said to be death rather than life. Nay, that life is worse than death
which is spent under the curse of God, and under the accusations of a
conscience which torments its victim more than the most barbarous
executioner. Indeed, if we take a right estimate of what the course of
this life is, none can be said to have reached its goal, but such as
have lived and died in the Lord, for to them, and them alone, death as
well as life is gain. When assailed, therefore, by the violence or fraud
of the wicked, it may comfort us to know that their career shall be
short, — that they shall be driven away, as by a whirlwind, and their
schemes, which seemed to meditate the destruction of the whole world,
dissipated in a moment. The short clause which is subjoined, and which
closes the psalm, suggests that this judgment of the wicked must be
waked for in the exercise of faith and patience, for the Psalmist rests
in hope for his deliverance. From this it appears that the wicked are
not cut off so suddenly from the earth, as not to afford us hope for the
exhibition of patience under the severity of long-continued injuries.

<span id="xxi.ii-p11"></span> This very beautiful image, derived from
the flight of the dove, is continued in the two following verses. The
defenselessness of the dove, the danger to which it is exposed from
birds of prey, the surprising rapidity with which, when pursued by the
hawk, it flees to deserts and rocks to hide itself, putting forth its
utmost speed, and outstripping its deadly pursuer; all these
characteristics of this bird were in the view of the Psalmist on the
present occasion. We find an allusion to them in <span
id="xxi.ii-p11.1"></span>[Jer
48:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#028.md)<span id="xxi.ii-p11.1"></span>:
“O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and
be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole’s mouth.”
The poets of Greece and Rome make frequent allusions to the rapid flight
of the dove: —

<span id="xxi.ii-p12"></span>*“So, when the falcon wings her way
above,  
To the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove,  
Not fated yet to die.”* — Pope*’*s Homer.

<span id="xxi.ii-p13"></span>Sophocles, in a passage somewhat similar to
this of the Psalmist, says, “O that with the rapid whirlwind flight of a
dove I could cleave the etherial clouds!” — (*Œdip* *Colon* 1136.)
“Kimshi gives it as the reason why the Psalmist prefers the dove to
other birds, that while they become weary with flying, and alight upon a
rock or a tree to recruit their strength, and are taken; the dove, when
she is fatigued, alternately rests one wing, and flies with the other,
and, by this means, escapes from the swiftest pursuers.” — (*Paxton*’*s
Illustrations of Scripture*, *volume* 2, p. 292.) It is worthy of
observation, and it serves to heighten the effect of the Psalmist’s
comparison, that <span id="xxi.ii-p13.1"></span>יונה, *yonah*, the
Hebrew name of the dove, is derived from <span
id="xxi.ii-p13.2"></span>ינה, *yanah*, *he hath oppressed by force or
fraud*, and seems to have been applied to it from the circumstance of
its being particularly defenseless, and exposed to rapine and violence.

<span id="xxi.ii-p14"></span> Whirlwinds are not uncommon in Palestine,
and the surrounding countries, and to them we often find allusions in
the Sacred Writings. The description of that kind of whirlwind called
the Sammiel, which sometimes happens between Egypt and Nubia, will serve
to show the propriety with which David made this allusion in his present
circumstances of distress and danger. “This wind, which the Arabs call
poisonous, stifles on the spot those that are unfortunate enough to
breathe in it: so that to guard against its pernicious effects, they are
obliged to throw themselves speedily on the ground, with their face
close to these burning sands, with which they are surrounded, and to
cover their heads with some cloth or carpet, lest, in respiration, they
should suck in that deadly quality which everywhere attends it. People
ought even to think themselves very happy when this wind, which is
always besides very violent, does not raise up large quantities of sand
with a whirling motion, which, darkening the air, render the guides
incapable of discerning their way. Sometimes whole caravans have been
buried by this means under the sand, with which this wind is frequently
charged.” — Maillet, quoted in *Harmer*’*s Observations*, volume1, p.
95.

<span id="xxi.iii-p7"></span> Hare, Green, and others, conjecture that
the first verb in the verse, “destroy,” had been originally “divide” —
“divide, O Lord! divide their tongues.” In Scripture we sometimes meet
with an elegant repetition of this kind, as in <span
id="xxi.iii-p7.1"></span>[Ps

“Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be.”

<span id="xxi.iii-p8"></span> “Violence and Strife” are here
personified, as sentinels or patrol, who keep watch over the city; going
their rounds upon the walls to guard “labor, sorrow, wickedness, deceit,
and guile,” which reign in the midst of it, and to exclude happiness,
righteousness, and truth. “It is, in fact,” says Bishop Mant, “a very
fine specimen of that power of personification, or enduing general and
abstract ideas with personal qualities; and thus introducing them acting
and speaking upon the stage, for which the Hebrew poets are
distinguished, equalling therein the most polished writers of other
nations in elegance and beauty, and surpassing the most elevated in
grandeur and sublimity.”

<span id="xxi.iv-p9"></span>This is the sense put upon the Hebrew word
<span id="xxi.iv-p9.1"></span>ערך, *erach*, by the LXX., who read,
“<span id="xxi.iv-p9.2"></span>Σὺ δὲ ἄνθρωπε ἰσφ́ψυχε,” “But thou, a man

id="xxi.iv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.iv-p13"></span> This is the sense in which Horsley
understands the passage. He observes, that “the image here is not
sufficiently expressed by the English word *seize*, though it is not
impossible that our translators might intend to allude to the seizure of
a debtor. But this is rather a kindred image than the same. The precise
image in the original is the exaction of payment, not the seizure of the
person.” His rendering is, “Let death exalt his claim upon them.”

<span id="xxi.v-p10"></span> Rogers is of this opinion; and observes,
that “in the Appendix to the first volume of Glassius, many instances
are adduced of the redundancy of the prefix <span
id="xxi.v-p10.1"></span>כ; as <span id="xxi.v-p10.2"></span>[Ex

<span id="fn_313"></span>[314](cc09020.htm#fr_313.md) <span
id="xxi.v-p10.5"></span>

<span id="xxi.v-p11"></span> Walford renders the sentence, “Though
multitudes be in opposition to me.” “The sense,” says he, “which is here
given, is evidently required, and is fairly deducible from the Hebrew
text.” Bishop Horsley’s rendering is, “For they who stood on my side
told for many;” — “they who stood on my side,” denoting the Divine
assistance described under the image of numerous auxiliaries. See <span
id="xxi.v-p11.1"></span>[2Ki 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#016.md)<span
id="xxi.v-p11.1"></span>; <span id="xxi.v-p11.2"></span>[1Jo
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004.md)<span id="xxi.v-p11.2"></span>.
Bishop Mant is satisfied that this is the Psalmist’s meaning, and he
accordingly turns the verse thus: —

<span id="xxi.v-p12"></span>“And he shall hear me, he shall shield,  
And he with peace shall crown;  
My guardian in the battle-field,  
An host himself alone.”

<span id="fn_314"></span>[315](cc09020.htm#fr_314.md) <span
id="xxi.v-p14.5"></span>

<span id="xxi.v-p15"></span> The reason of this difference arises from
the ambiguity of the meaning of the original word, which signifies
*change* simply, without reference to the kind of change. Of the two
senses which our Author proceeds to state, the first is that adopted by
the Chaldee, which reads, “Wicked men, who change not their very evil
course, and fear not the sight of God, shall perish.” Dathe, while he
admits the ambiguity of the word, follows the Chaldee. Gesenius gives
the same interpretation. “But,” says Walford, “this reduces the passage
nearly to an identical proposition; so that the probable meaning is,
vicissitudes of fortune. These men had enjoyed great prosperity, and
been subjected to few trials; they were therefore enamoured of this
world and its pleasures, and gave themselves little regard about the
will and authority of God. See <span id="xxi.v-p15.1"></span>[Ps.

they also shall live for ever; or, at least, that things will go on the
same for ever. See <span id="xxi.v-p16.1"></span>[2Pe

<span id="xxi.vi-p3"></span> “<span id="xxi.vi-p3.1"></span>Misit manus
in paces suas.” — *Lat*. On the margin of the French version, “<span
id="xxi.vi-p3.2"></span>paces suas“ is thus explained: “<span
id="xxi.vi-p3.3"></span>C’est, ses alliez et gens qui vivoyent
paisiblement avec luy.”

<span id="fn_317"></span>[318](cc09020.htm#fr_317.md) <span

<span id="xxi.vi-p4"></span> “<span id="xxi.vi-p4.1"></span>Ou, ta
charge.” *Fr*. *marg*. “Or, thy burden.”

<span id="fn_318"></span>[319](cc09020.htm#fr_318.md) <span
id="xxi.vi-p4.2"></span>

<span id="xxi.vi-p5"></span> “<span id="xxi.vi-p5.1"></span>Ou, tombe.”
— *Fr*. *marg*. “Or, fall.” Fry reads, “He will not permit for ever the
displacing, moving, tossing, or slipping of the righteous.”

<span id="xxi.vi-p9"></span> In the figurative language of the East,
severe, unfeeling, and injurious words are often compared to swords,
daggers, arrows, etc. Thus it is said in <span
id="xxi.vi-p9.1"></span>[Ps 59:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#007.md)<span
id="xxi.vi-p9.1"></span>, “Swords are in their lips; for who, *say
they*, doth hear?” and in <span id="xxi.vi-p9.2"></span>[Pr
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#018.md)<span id="xxi.vi-p9.2"></span>,
“There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword.” In our own
language, a similar figure of speech is quite common, as when we speak
of *keen*, *cutting*, and *piercing* words, and of the wounds which they
inflict. “I will speak daggers to her.” — *Hamlet*.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[321](cc09020.htm#fr_320.md) <span
id="xxi.vi-p11.3"></span>

<span id="xxi.vi-p12"></span> “What thou desirest to have given thee,”
according to the Chaldee, which renders the word *thy hope*; *i* *e*.,
that which thou hopest to receive. On the margin of our English Bibles
it is, *thy gift*, which Williams explains by “allotment.” “*Cast thy
allotment upon the Lord*,” says he, “on which we may remark, that
whatever allotment we receive from God, whether of prosperity or
adversity, it is our duty to refer it back to him: ‘He that giveth to
the poor lendeth to the Lord, and he will repay him;’ or if our lot be
adverse, ‘he will sustain’ under every burden, and ‘never suffer the
righteous to be moved’ from his foundation.” In like manner Rogers
understands the word. “*Cast upon Jehovah what he allots you*; *i* *e*.,
commit to Jehovah your destiny. Supply <span
id="xxi.vi-p12.1"></span>אשר before <span id="xxi.vi-p12.2"></span>יהבך”
— *Book of Psalms in Hebrew*, volume 2, p. 210. The Septuagint reads,
<span id="xxi.vi-p12.3"></span>μέριμνάν, *thy care*; in which it is
followed by the apostle Peter, (<span id="xxi.vi-p12.4"></span>[1Pe
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005)<span id="xxi.vi-p12.4"></span>..md)
The reading of the Vulgate, Syriac, Æthiopic, and Arabic versions is the
same.

<span id="xxi.vi-p15"></span> The Chaldee explains it, “the deep
Gehenna.”
