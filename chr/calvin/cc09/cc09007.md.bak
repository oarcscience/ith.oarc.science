<span id="viii-p1"></span>PSALM 42

<span id="viii-p2"></span>In the first place, David shows that when he
was forced to flee by reason of the cruelty of Saul, and was living in a
state of exile, what most of all grieved him was, that he was deprived
of the opportunity of access to the sanctuary; for he preferred the
service of God to every earthly advantage. In the second place, he shows
that being tempted with despair, he had in this respect a very difficult
contest to sustain. In order to strengthen his hope, he also introduces
prayer and meditation on the grace of God. Last of all, he again makes
mention of the inward conflict which he had with the sorrow which he
experienced.

<span id="viii-p3"></span>To the chief musician. A lesson of instruction
to the sons of Korah.

<span id="viii-p4"></span>The name of David is not expressly mentioned
in the inscription of this psalm. Many conjecture that the sons of Korah
were the authors of it. This, I think, is not at all probable. As it is
composed in the person of David, who, it is well known, was endued above
all others with the spirit of prophecy, who will believe that it was
written and composed for him by another person? He was the teacher
generally of the whole Church, and a distinguished instrument of the
Spirit. He had already delivered to the company of the Levites, of whom
the sons of Korah formed a part, other psalms to be sung by them. What
need, then, had he to borrow their help, or to have recourse to their
assistance in a matter which he was much better able of himself to
execute than they were? To me, therefore, it seems more probable, that
the sons of Korah are here mentioned because this psalm was committed as
a precious treasure to be preserved by them, as we know that out of the
number of the singers, some were chosen and appointed to be keepers of
the psalms. That there is no mention made of David’s name does not of
itself involve any difficulty, since we see the same omission in other
psalms, of which there is, notwithstanding, the strongest grounds for
concluding that he was the author. As to the word <span
id="viii-p4.1"></span>משכיל, *maskil,* I have already made some remarks
upon it in the thirty-second psalm. This word, it is true, is sometimes
found in the inscription of other psalms besides those in which David
declares that he had been subjected to the chastening rod of God. It is,
however, to be observed, that it is properly applied to chastisements,
since the design of them is to instruct the children of God, when they
do not sufficiently profit from doctrine. As to the particular time of
the composition of this psalm, expositors are not altogether agreed.
Some suppose that David here complains of his calamity, when he was
expelled from the throne by his son Absalom. But I am rather disposed to
entertain a different opinion, founded, if I mistake not, upon good
reasons. The rebellion of Absalom was very soon suppressed, so that it
did not long prevent David from approaching the sanctuary. And yet, the
lamentation which he here makes refers expressly to a long state of
exile, under which he had languished, and, as it were, pined away with
grief. It is not the sorrow merely of a few days which he describes in
the third verse; nay, the scope of the entire composition will clearly
show that he had languished for a long time in the wretched condition of
which he speaks. It has been alleged as an argument against referring
this psalm to the reign of Saul, that the ark of the covenant was
neglected during his reign, so that it is not very likely that David at
that time conducted the stated choral services in the sanctuary; but
this argument is not very conclusive: for although Saul only worshipped
God as a mere matter of form, yet he was unwilling to be regarded in any
other light than as a devout man. And as to David, he has shown in other
parts of his writings with what diligence he frequented the holy
assemblies, and more especially on festival days. Certainly, these words
which we shall meet with in <span id="viii-p4.2"></span>[Ps
55:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#014.md)<span id="viii-p4.2"></span>, “We
walked unto the house of God in company,” relate to the time of Saul.

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
42:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1**. As the hart crieth  <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) for the fountains of water, so my soul
crieth after thee, O Jehovah! **2**. My soul hath thirsted for God, even
for the living God: when shall I come to appear before the face of God?
**3**. My tears have been my bread day and night, while they say daily
to me, Where is thy God?

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span><span id="viii.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span>**1.** *As the hart crieth for the fountains
of water, etc* The meaning of these two verses simply is, that David
preferred to all the enjoyments, riches, pleasures, and honors of this
world, the opportunity of access to the sanctuary, that in this way he
might cherish and strengthen his faith and piety by the exercises
prescribed in the Law. When he says that he *cried for the living God,*
we are not to understand it merely in the sense of a burning love and
desire towards God: but we ought to remember in what manner it is that,
God allures us to himself, and by what means he raises our minds
upwards. He does not enjoin us to ascend forthwith into heaven, but,
consulting our weakness, he descends to us. David, then, considering
that the way of access was shut against him, cried to God, because he
was excluded from the outward service of the sanctuary, which is the
sacred bond of intercourse with God. I do not mean to say that the
observance of external ceremonies can of itself bring us into favor with
God, but they are religious exercises which we cannot bear to want by
reason of our infirmity. David, therefore, being excluded from the
sanctuary, is no less grieved than if he had been separated from God
himself. He did not, it is true, cease in the meantime to direct his
prayers towards heaven, and even to the sanctuary itself; but conscious
of his own infirmity, he was specially grieved that the way by which the
faithful obtained access to God was shut against him. This is an example
which may well suffice to put to shame the arrogance of those who
without concern can bear to be deprived of those means,  <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) or rather, who proudly despise them,
as if it were in their power to ascend to heaven in a moment’s flight;
nay, as if they surpassed David in zeal and alacrity of mind. We must
not, however, imagine that the prophet suffered himself to rest in
earthly elements,  <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) but only that
he made use of them as a ladder, by which he might ascend to God,
finding that he had not wings with which to fly thither. The similitude
which he takes from *a hart* is designed to express the extreme ardor of
his desire. The sense in which some explain this is, that the waters are
eagerly sought by the harts, that they may recover from fatigue; but
this, perhaps, is too limited. I admit that if the hunter pursue the
stag, and the dogs also follow hard after it, when it comes to a river
it gathers new strength by plunging into it. But we know also that at
certain seasons of the year, harts, with an almost incredible desire,
and more intensely than could proceed from mere thirst, seek after
water; and although I would not contend for it, yet I think this is
referred to by the prophet here.

<span id="viii.i-p9"></span><span id="viii.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p10"></span>The second verse illustrates more clearly
what I have already said, that David does not simply speak of the
presence of God, but of the presence of God in connection with certain
symbols; for he sets before himself the tabernacle, the altar, the
sacrifices, and other ceremonies by which God had testified that he
would be near his people; and that it behoved the faithful, in seeking
to approach God, to begin by those things. Not that they should continue
attached to them, but that they should, by the help of these signs and
outward means, seek to behold the glory of God, which of itself is
hidden from the sight. Accordingly, when we see the marks of the divine
presence engraven on the word, or on external symbols, we can say with
David that there *is the face of God,* provided we come with pure hearts
to seek him in a spiritual manner. But when we imagine God to be present
otherwise than he has revealed himself in his word, and the sacred
institutions of his worship, or when we form any gross or earthly
conception of his heavenly majesty, we are only inventing for ourselves
visionary representations, which disfigure the glory of God, and turn
his truth into a lie.

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span><span id="viii.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p12"></span>**3.** *My tears have been my bread* Here
the Psalmist mentions another sharp piercing shaft with which the wicked
and malevolent grievously wounded his heart. There can be no doubt that
Satan made use of such means as these to fan the flame that consumed him
with grief. “What,” we may suppose that adversary to say, “wouldst thou
have? Seest thou not that God hath cast thee off? For certainly he
desires to be worshipped in the tabernacle, to which you have now no
opportunity of access, and from which you are as it were banished.”
These were violent assaults, and enough to have overturned the faith of
this holy man, unless, supported by the power of the Spirit in a more
than ordinary degree, he had made a strong and vigorous resistance. It
is evident that his feelings had been really and strongly affected. We
may be often agitated, and yet not to such an extent as to abstain from
eating and drinking; but when a man voluntarily abstains from food, and
indulges so much in weeping, that he daily neglects his ordinary meals,
and is continually overwhelmed in sorrow, it is obvious that he is
troubled in no light degree; but that he is wounded severely, and even
to the heart.  <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) Now, David says,
that he did not experience greater relief in any thing whatever than
from weeping; and, therefore, he gave himself up to it, just in the same
manner as men take pleasure and enjoyment in eating; and this he says
had been the case every day, and not only for a short time. Let us,
therefore, whenever the ungodly triumph over us in our miseries, and
spitefully taunt us that God is against us, never forget that it is
Satan who moves them to speak in this manner, in order to overthrow our
faith; and that, therefore, it is not time for us to take our ease, or
to yield to indifference, when a war so dangerous is waged against us.
There is still another reason which ought to inspire us with such
feelings, and it is this, that the name of God is held up to scorn by
the ungodly; for they cannot scoff at our faith without greatly
reproaching him. If, then, we are not altogether insensible, we must in
such circumstances be affected with the deepest sorrow.

<span id="viii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
42:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#004.md)<span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>**4**. When I remember these things,  <span
id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) I pour out my soul within me, because
I had gone in company with them, \[literally in number,\] leading them
even to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, even the
multitude dancing for joy.  <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md)
**5**. O my soul! why art thou cast down? and why art thou disquieted
within me? Wait thou upon God: for I shall yet praise him for the helps
\[or salvations\] of his countenance. **6**. O my God! my soul is cast
down within me, when I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of
Hermonim, \[or, and from the Hermons,\] from the hill Mizar.

<span id="viii.ii-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.ii-p6"></span><span id="viii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p7"></span>**4.** *When I remember these things* This
verse is somewhat obscure, on account of the variation of the tenses in
the Hebrew. And yet I have no doubt that the true and natural sense is,
that David, when he called to remembrance his former condition,
experienced so much the greater sadness by comparing it with his present
condition. The remembrance, I say, of the past had no small influence in
aggravating his misery, from the thought that he, who had formerly acted
the part of a leader and standard-bearer in conducting others to the
holy assemblies, should now be debarred from access to the temple. We
know that those who have been accustomed to suffering from their
childhood become insensible to it, and the very continuance of misery
produces in us a certain degree of callousness, so that we cease to
think of it, or to regard it as anything unusual. It is different with
those who have not been so accustomed to it. And, therefore, it is no
wonder if David, who had been not one of the common people, but who had
lately occupied a chief place among the princes, and had been leader of
the foremost ranks among the faithful, should be more grievously
disquieted, when he saw himself utterly cast off, and not admitted to a
place even among the lowest. Accordingly, I connect the demonstrative
pronoun *these* with the declaration which follows, namely, that he
remembered how he had been accustomed to mingle in the company of the
godly, and to lead them to the house of God. *To pour out* *the soul* is
taken metaphorically by some for to give utterance to his grief*;*
others are of opinion, that it signifies to rejoice greatly*,* or, as we
commonly speak, to be melted or dissolved in joy It appears to me that
David rather means to say, that his affections were, as it were, melted
within him, whether it were from joy or sorrow. As the soul of man
sustains him, so long as it keeps its energies collected, so also it
sinks within him, and, as it were, vanishes away, when any of the
affections, by excessive indulgence, gains the ascendancy.  <span
id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) Accordingly, he is said to pour out
his soul, who is so excited, that his affections lose their vigor, and
begin to flow out. David’s language implies, that his soul melted and
fainted within him by the greatness of his sorrow, when he thought of
the condition from which he had fallen. If any would rather understand
it of *joy,* the language will admit of such an illustration as this:
Formerly I took such a delight in walking foremost in the ranks of the
people, and leading them in procession to the sanctuary, that my heart
melted within me for joy, and I was quite transported with it: if,
therefore, I should again be restored to the same happy condition, all
my feelings would be ravished with the same delight. I have, however,
already stated what appeared to me to be the best exposition. We must
not suppose that David had been overwhelmed with the sorrow of the
world; but, as in his present misery he discerned the wrath of God, he
sorrowed after a godly sort, because, by his own fault, he had provoked
the displeasure of God against him. And, even without touching this
reason of his sorrow, we see the source from which it proceeded. Even
when afflicted by so many personal privations, he is nevertheless
grieved only for the sanctuary, thereby showing that it would have been
less distressing to him to have been deprived of life, than to continue
in a state of exile from the presence of God. And, indeed, the way in
which we ought to regulate all our affections is this, That, on the one
hand, our joy may have respect to the paternal love and favor of God
towards us, and that, on the other, the only cause of our grief may
arise from feeling that he is angry with us. This is the “godly sorrow”
of which Paul speaks, <span id="viii.ii-p8.2"></span>[2Co
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md)<span id="viii.ii-p8.2"></span>.
By the term *number,* which in the Hebrew is called <span
id="viii.ii-p8.3"></span>סך, *sach,* David, I have no doubt, intended
*ranks,* or *companies in procession;* for when they went to the
tabernacle on the holy days, they went not in confusion or in crowds,
but walked in regular order, (<span id="viii.ii-p8.4"></span>[Lu
2:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#044)<span id="viii.ii-p8.4"></span>..md)

<span id="viii.ii-p9"></span><span id="viii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p10"></span>**5** *O my soul! why art thou cast down?*
From this it appears that David contended strongly against his sorrow,
lest he should yield to temptation: but what we ought chiefly to observe
is, that he had experienced a strong and bitter contest before he
obtained the victory over it; or we might rather say, that he was not
delivered from it after one alarming assault, but was often called upon
to enter into new scenes of conflict. It need not excite our wonder that
he was so much disquieted and cast down, since he could not discern any
sign of the divine favor towards him. But David here represents himself
as if he formed two opposing parties. In so far as in the exercise of
faith he relied upon the promises of God, being armed with the Spirit of
invincible fortitude, he set himself, in opposition to the affections of
his flesh, to restrain and subdue them; and, at the same time, he
rebuked his own cowardice and imbecility of heart. Moreover, although he
carried on war against the devil and the world, yet he does not enter
into open and direct conflict with them, but rather regards himself as
the enemy against whom he desires chiefly to contend. And doubtless the
best way to overcome Satan is, not to go out of ourselves, but to
maintain an internal conflict against he desires of our own hearts. It
ought, however, to be observed, that David confesses that his soul was
cast down within him: for when our infirmities rise up in vast array,
and, like the waves of the sea, are ready to overwhelm us, our faith
seems to us to fail, and, in consequence we are so overcome by mere
fear, that we lack courage, and are afraid to enter into the conflict.
Whenever, therefore, such a state of indifference and faint-heartedness
shall seize upon us, let us remember, that to govern and subdue the
desires of their hearts, and especially to contend against the feelings
of distrust which are natural to all, is a conflict to which the godly
are not unfrequently called. But here there are two evils specified,
which, however apparently different, yet assail our hearts at the same
time; the one is *discouragement,* and the other *disquietude* When we
are quite downcast, we are not free of a feeling of disquietude, which
leads us to murmur and complain. The remedy to both of them is here
added, *hope in God,* which alone inspires our minds, in the first
place, with confidence in the midst of the greatest troubles; and,
secondly, by the exercise of patience, preserves them in peace. In what
follows, David very well expresses the power and nature of hope by these
words, *I shall yet praise him;* for it has the effect of elevating our
thoughts to the contemplation of the grace of God, when it is hidden
from our view. By the term *yet,* he confesses that for the present, and
in so far as the praises of God are concerned, his mouth is stopped,
seeing he is oppressed and shut up on all sides. This, however, does not
prevent him from extending his hope to some future distant period; and,
in order to escape from his present sorrow, and, as it were, get beyond
its reach, he promises himself what as yet there was no appearance of
obtaining. Nor is this an imaginary expectation produced by a fanciful
mind; but, relying upon the promises of God, he not only encourages
himself to cherish good hope, but also promises himself certain
deliverance. We can only be competent witnesses to our brethren of the
grace of God when, in the first place, we have borne testimony to it to
our own hearts. What follows, *The helps of his countenance,* may be
differently expounded. Commentators, for the most art, supply the word
*for:* so that, according to this view, David here expresses the matter
or cause of thanksgiving — that *yet he would give praise or thanks to
God for the help of his countenance* This interpretation I readily
admit. At the same time, the sense will not be inappropriate if we read
the terms separately, thus: *helps or salvations are from the
countenance of God;* for as soon as he is pleased to look upon his
people he sets them in safety. *The countenance of God* is taken for the
manifestation of his favor. His countenance then appears serene and
gracious to us; as, on the contrary, adversity, like the intervening
clouds, darkens or obscures its benign aspect.

<span id="viii.ii-p11"></span><span id="viii.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p12"></span>**6.** *O my God! my soul is cast down
within me.* If we suppose that this verse requires no supplement, then
it will consist of two distinct and separate sentences. Literally it may
be read thus: *O my God! my soul is cast down within me, therefore will
I remember thee, etc.* But the greater number of expositors render the
word <span id="viii.ii-p12.1"></span>על-כן*, al-ken,* by *forasmuch as,*
or *because,* so that it is employed to express the reason of what is
contained in the preceding clause. And certainly it would be very
appropriate in this sense, That as often as David, from the land of
Jordan, in which he now lay hid as an exile, set himself to think of the
sanctuary, his sorrow was so much the more increased. If, however, any
would rather, as I have already observed, distinguish this verse into
two parts, it must be understood as meaning that David thought of God in
his exile, not to nourish his grief, but to assuage it. He did not act
the part of those who find no relief in their afflictions but in
forgetting God; for although wounded by his hand, he, nevertheless,
failed not to acknowledge him to be his physician. Accordingly, the
import of the whole verse will be this, I am now living in a state of
exile, banished from the temple, and seem to be an alien from the
household of God; but this will not prevent me from regarding him, and
having recourse to him. I am now deprived of the accustomed sacrifices,
of which I stand much in need, but he has not taken from me his word.
As, however, the first interpretation is the one more generally
received, and this also seems to be added by way of exposition, it is
better not to depart from it. David then complains that his soul was
oppressed with sorrow, because he saw himself cast out of the Church of
God. At the same time, there is in these words a tacit contrast;  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) as if he had said, It is not the
desire to be restored to my wife, or my house, or any of my possessions,
which grieves me so much as the distressing consideration, that I now
find myself prevented from taking part in the service of God. We ought
to learn from this, that although we are deprived of the helps which God
has appointed for the edification of our faith and piety, it is,
nevertheless, our duty to be diligent in stirring up our minds, that we
may never suffer ourselves to be forgetful of God. But, above all, this
is to be observed, that as in the preceding verse we have seen David
contending courageously against his own affections, so now we here see
by what means he steadfastly maintained his ground. He did this by
having recourse to the help of God, and taking refuge in it as in a holy
sanctuary. And, assuredly, if meditation upon the promises of God do not
lead us to prayer, it will not have sufficient power to sustain and
confirm us. Unless God impart strength to us, how shall we be able to
subdue the many evil thoughts which constantly arise in our minds? The
soul of man serves the purpose, as it were, of a workshop to Satan in
which to forge a thousand methods of despair. And, therefore, it is not
without reason that David, after a severe conflict with himself, has
recourse to prayer, and calls upon God as the witness of his sorrow. *By
the land of Jordan* is to be understood that part of the country which,
in respect of Judea, was beyond the river of that name. This appears
still more clearly from the word Hermonim or Hermons. Hermon was a
mountainous district, which extended to a considerable distance; and
because it had several tops, was called in the plural number Hermonim.
 <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md)

<span id="viii.ii-p15"></span>Perhaps David also has purposely made use
of the plural number on account of the fear by which he was forced
frequently to change his place of abode, and wander hither and thither.
As to the word *Mizar,* some suppose that it was not the proper name of
a mountain, and therefore translate it *little,* supposing that there is
here an indirect comparison of the Hermons with the mountain of Sion, as
if David meant to say that Sion, which was comparatively a small hill,
was greater in his estimation than the lofty Hermons; but it appears to
me that this would be a constrained interpretation.

<span id="viii.iii-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.iii-p6"></span><span id="viii.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p7"></span>**7.** *Depth calleth unto depth* These
words express the grievousness, as well as the number and long
continuance, of the miseries which he suffered; as if he had said, I am
oppressed not only with one kind of misery, but various kinds of
distress return one after another, so that there seems to be neither end
nor measure to them. In the first place, by the term *depth,* he shows
that the temptations by which he was assailed were such, that they might
well be compared to gulfs in the sea; then he complains of their long
continuance, which he describes by the very appropriate figure, that his
temptations cry out from a distance, and call to one another. In the
second part of the verse, he continues the same metaphor, when he says,
that *all the waves and floods of God have passed over his head* By this
he means that he had been overwhelmed, and as it were swallowed up by
the accumulation of afflictions. It ought, however, to be observed, that
he designates the cruelty of Saul, and his other enemies*, floods of
God,* that in all our adversities we may always remember to humble
ourselves under the mighty hand of God which afflicts us. But it is of
importance to go beyond this, and to consider, that if it should please
God to rain with violence upon us, as soon as he shall have opened his
sluices or *waterspouts,* there will be no termination to our miseries
till he is appeased; for he has in his power means marvellous and
unknown for executing his vengeance against us. Thus, when once his
anger is kindled against us, there will be not only one depth to swallow
us up, but depth will call unto depth. And as the insensibility of men
is such, that they do not stand in awe of the threatenings of God, to
the degree in which they ought, whenever mention is made of his
vengeance, let us recall this verse to our recollection.

<span id="viii.iii-p8"></span><span id="viii.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p9"></span>**8.** *Jehovah will command his
loving-kindness by day* The verb here used is of the future tense; but I
do not deny that, according to the Hebrew idiom, it might be rendered in
the past tense, as some do who think that David here enumerates the
benefits which he had formerly received from God, in order by contrast
to add greater force to the complaint which he makes of his present sad
and miserable condition; as if he had said, How comes it to pass that
God, who formerly manifested so much kindness towards me, having as it
were changed his mind, now deals towards me with great severity? But as
there is no sufficient reason for changing the tense of the verb, and as
the other interpretation seems more in accordance with the scope of the
text, let us adhere to it. I do not, indeed, positively deny, that for
the strengthening of his faith, David calls to memory the benefits which
he had already experienced from God; but I think that he here promises
himself deliverance in future, though it be as yet hidden from him. I
have, therefore, no desire to raise any discussion regarding the verb,
whether it should be taken in the future or in the past tense, provided
only it be fully admitted that the argument of David is to this effect:
Why should I not expect that God will be merciful to me, so that in the
day-time his loving-kindness may be manifested towards me, and by night
upon my bed a song of joy be with me? He, no doubt, places this ground
of comfort in opposition to the sorrow which he might well apprehend
from the dreadful tokens of the divine displeasure, which he has
enumerated in the preceding verse. The *prayer* of which he speaks in
the end of the verse is not to be understood as the prayer of an
afflicted or sorrowful man; but it comprehends an expression of the
delight which is experienced when God, by manifesting his favor to us,
gives us free access into his presence. And, therefore, he also calls
him *the God of his life,* because from the knowledge of this arises

<span id="viii.iv-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
42:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#009.md)<span id="viii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p2"></span>**9**. I will say to God my rock, Why hast
thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the
enemy? **10**. It is as a wound  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md)
in my bones when my enemies reproach me, saying to me daily, Where is
thy God? **11**. O my soul! why art thou cast down? and why art thou
disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall yet praise him, the helps
\[or salvations\] of my countenance, and my God.

<span id="viii.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.iv-p5"></span><span id="viii.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p6"></span>**9.** *I will say to God my rock* If we
read the preceding verse in the past tense, the meaning of this verse
will be, Since God has, in this way, heretofore shown himself so kind
towards me, I will pray to him now with so much the greater confidence:
for the experience which I have had of his goodness will inspire me with
courage. But if the preceding verse is rendered in the future tense,
David, in this verse, combines the prayer which it contains with the
reflections which faith led him to make. And, surely, whoever, from a
persuasion of the paternal love of God, anticipates for himself the same
favor which David has just described, will also be induced from his
example to pray for it with greater confidence. The meaning, then, will
be this: Since I expect that God will be favorable to me, inasmuch as by
day he manifests his favor towards me, and continues to do this, so that
even by night I have occasion to praise him, I will bewail the more
frankly my miseries before him, saying, *O* *Lord! my rock, why hast
thou forgotten me?* In making such a complaint, the faithful are not to
be understood as meaning that God has utterly rejected them: for if they
did not believe that they were under his care and protection, it were in
vain for them to call upon him. But they speak in this manner according
to the sense of the flesh. This forgetfulness, then, relates both to
outward appearance, and to the disquietude by which the faithful are
troubled according to the flesh, although, in the meantime, they rest
assured by faith that God regards them, and will not be deaf to their
request.

<span id="viii.iv-p7"></span><span id="viii.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p8"></span>**10** *It is as a slaughter in my bones.*
This verse is somewhat involved in point of expression; but as to the
meaning of it there is no obscurity. David here affirms that the grief
which he experienced from the reproaches of his enemies, wounded him in
no degree less than if they had pierced through his bones. The word
<span id="viii.iv-p8.1"></span>ברצה*, beretsach,* signifies *killing;*
and, therefore, I have retained this idea in the translation of it. And
yet I do not condemn the opinion of those who render it *a slaughtering
sword.*  <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) There is here a
difference as to the reading, arising from the great similarity which
there is between the two letters <span id="viii.iv-p9.5"></span>ב*,
beth,* and <span id="viii.iv-p9.6"></span>כ*, caph,* the mark of
similitude. As the letter <span id="viii.iv-p9.7"></span>ב *beth,* is
often superfluous, I would rather be disposed, in a doubtful matter like
this, to omit it altogether. But as I have said, the sense is perfectly
plain, except that interpreters do not seem to take this sufficiently
into their consideration, that by the terms *my bones,* the bitterness
of grief is referred to; for we feel much more acutely any injury which
is done to the bones, than if a sword should pierce the bowels, or the
other parts of the body which are soft and yielding. Nor should the
children of God regard this similitude as hyperbolical; and if one
should wonder why David took so sorely to heart the derision of his
enemies, he only manifests in this his own insensibility. For of all the
bitter evils which befall us, there is nothing which can inflict upon us
a severer wound than to see the wicked tear in pieces the majesty of
God, and endeavor to destroy and overturn our faith. The doctrine taught
by Paul, (<span id="viii.iv-p9.8"></span>[Ga
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024)<span id="viii.iv-p9.8"></span>,.md)
concerning the persecution of Ishmael, is well known. Many consider his
childish jesting as of little moment, but as it tended to this effect,
that the covenant of God should be esteemed as a thing of no value, it
is on that account, according to the judgment of the Holy Spirit, to be
accounted a most cruel persecution. David, therefore, with much
propriety, compares to a slaughtering sword, which penetrates even
within the bones and marrow, the derision of his enemies, by which he
saw his own faith and the word of God trampled under foot. And would to
God that all who boast themselves of being his children would learn to
bear their private wrongs more patiently, and to manifest the same
vehement zeal for which David is here distinguished, when their faith is
assailed to the dishonor of God, and when the word also which gives them
life is included in the same reproach!

<span id="viii.iv-p10"></span><span id="viii.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p11"></span>**11** *O my soul! why art thou cast
down?* This repetition shows us that David had not so completely
overcome his temptations in one encounter, or by one extraordinary
effort, as to render it unnecessary for him to enter anew into the same
conflict. By this example, therefore, we are admonished, that although
Satan, by his assaults, often subjects us to a renewal of the same
trouble, we ought not to lose our courage, or allow ourselves to be cast
down. The latter part of this verse differs from the fifth verse in one
word, while in every other respect they agree. In the fifth verse, it is
the *helps of* His *countenance,* but here we have the relative pronoun
of the first person, thus, *The helps of* My *countenance* Perhaps in
this place, the letter *w*, *vau,* which in the Hebrew language denotes
the third person, is wanting. Still, as all the other versions agree in
the reading which I have adopted,  <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) David might, without any absurdity,
call God by this designation, *The helps* or *salvations of* My
*countenance,* inasmuch as he looked with confidence for a deliverance,
manifest and certain, as if God should appear in a visible manner as his
defender, and the protector of his welfare. There can, however, be no
doubt, that in this place the term *helps or salvations* is to be viewed
as an epithet applied to God; for immediately after it follows, *and my
God*

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span> Horsley also reads, “crieth.” In the Hebrew
it is “brayeth.” In Hebrew there are distinct words to mark the peculiar
cries of the hart, the bear, the lion, the zebra, the wolf, the horse,
the dog, the cow, and the sheep. The distressing cry of the hart seems
to be here expressed. Being naturally of a hot and sanguine
constitution, it suffers much from thirst in the Oriental regions. When
in want of water, and unable to find it, it makes a mournful noise, and
eagerly seeks the cooling river; and especially when pursued over the
dry and parched wilderness by the hunter, it seeks the stream of water
with intense desire, and braying plunges into it with eagerness, as soon
as it has reached its wished-for banks, at once to quench its thirst and
escape its deadly pursuers. It is the female hart which is here meant,
as “brayeth” is feminine, and as the reading of the LXX. also shows,
which is, <span id="viii.i-p3.1"></span>ἡ ἔλσφος

id="viii.ii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p4"></span> In this verse, there is evidently a
reference to the festive religious solemnities of the Jews, in which
singing and dancing were used. These also formed an eminent part of the
religious rites of the ancient Greeks and other heathen nations. Among
the Greeks at the present day, it is the practice for a lady of
distinction to lead the dance, and to be followed by a troop of young
females, who imitate her steps, and if she sings, make up the chorus.
This serves to throw light on the description given of Miriam, when she
“took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with
timbrels and dances,” (<span id="viii.ii-p4.1"></span>[Ex
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020)<span id="viii.ii-p4.1"></span>..md)
She led the dance; they followed and imitated her steps. When David
“danced before the Lord” at the bringing up of the ark, “with shouting
and with the sound of the trumpet,” it is probable that he was
accompanied by others whom he led in the dance, (<span
id="viii.ii-p4.2"></span>[2 Sam. 6:15](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016)<span id="viii.ii-p4.2"></span>..md)
To this practice there is evidently an allusion in this passage; and the
allusion greatly enhances its beauty.

<span id="viii.ii-p14"></span> Just as we say the Alps and the
Appenines. The Hermons formed part of the ridge of the high hills called
Antilibanus. The sources of the Jordan are in the vicinity. Davidson
reads, “*From the land of Jordan*, *even of the Hermons*; the two
espressions signifying the same district.” — *Sacred Hermeneutics*, p.
667.

<span id="viii.iii-p4"></span> “A waterspout is a large tube or cylinder
formed of clouds, by means of the electric fluid, the base being
uppermost, and the point let down perpendicularly from the clouds. It
has a particular kind of *circular motion* at the point; and being
hollow within attracts vast quantities of water; which it frequently
pours down in torrents on the earth or the sea. So great is the quantity
of water, and so sudden and precipitate the fall, that if it happen to
break on a vessel, it shatters it to pieces, and sinks it in an instant.
Those waterspouts which Dr Shaw saw in the Mediterranean, he informs us,
“seemed to be so many cylinders of water falling down from the clouds;”
and he states, that they “are more frequent near the capes of Latikea,
Greego, and Carmel, than in any other part of the Mediterranean.” —
(*Travels*, p. 333.) “These are all places,” as Harmer observes, “on the
coast of Syria, and the last of them every body knows in Judea, it being
a place rendered famous by the prayers of the prophet Elijah. The Jews
then could not be ignorant of what happened on their coasts; and David
must have known of these dangers of the sea, if he had not actually seen
some of them.” — (*Observations*, volume 3, p. 222.) In the description
of a violent and dangerous storm at sea, by which he here portrays his
great distress, he would, therefore, naturally draw his imagery from
these awful phenomena, which were of frequent occurrence on the Jewish
coasts.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[124](cc09007.htm#fr_123.md) <span
id="viii.iv-p8.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p9"></span> The original word <span
id="viii.iv-p9.1"></span>רצח *retsach*, is constantly used in prose for
a *homicide*, or *murderer*, being derived from the verb <span
id="viii.iv-p9.2"></span>רצח *ratsach*, which signifies *to slay*, *to
murder*; and although it is not used in any other passage for *a*
*sword*, “it may,” as Horsley observes, “very naturally, in poetry, be
applied to the instrument of slaughter, the sword.” In support of this
view, he refers to a passage in one of the tragedies of Sophocles, in
which Ajax calls his sword, upon which he is about to fall, <span
id="viii.iv-p9.3"></span>Ο σφαγεὺς which gives the literal rendering of
the Hebrew <span id="viii.iv-p9.4"></span>רצח, *retsach*, *murderer*
Horsley’s rendering is, “While the sword is in my bones.”

<span id="fn_124"></span>[125](cc09007.htm#fr_124.md) <span
id="viii.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p12"></span> All the ancient versions, with the
exception of the Chaldee, read both in this and the fifth verse, “my
countenance.” Hammond thinks that as these words are the burden of this
and the following psalm, and as the meaning of the other words of the
sentence in which they occur is the same in the different verses, it is
not improbable that the old reading in both places may have been “my
countenance.”
