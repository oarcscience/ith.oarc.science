*Calvin's Commentaries, Vol. 9: Psalms, Part II*, tr. by John King,
\[1847-50\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="xix"></span>

<span id="xix-p1"></span>PSALM 53

<span id="xix-p2"></span>This psalm being almost identical with the
fourteenth, it has not been considered necessary to subjoin any distinct
commentary.  <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283)

<span id="xix-p4"></span>To the chief musician upon Mahalath.  <span
id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284)  
A Psalm of David for instruction.

<span id="xix.i"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p1"></span><span id="xix.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
53:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#001)<span id="xix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p2"></span>**1**. The fool hath said in his heart, There
is no God: they have become corrupt, they have done abominable works:
there is none that doeth good. **2**. God looked down from heaven upon
the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that
did seek God. **3**. Every one of them has gone back; they have together
become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. **4**. Have
the workers of iniquity no knowledge? eating my people as they eat
bread:  <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285) they have not called
upon God. **5**. There were they in great fear where no fear was; for
God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou
hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them. **6**. Who shall
give the salvation of Israel out of Zion? When God bringeth back the
captivity of his people,  <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286) Jacob
shall rejoice, and Israel shall triumph.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_283"></span>[284](cc09018.htm#fr_283) <span

<span id="xix-p3"></span> Some slight differences will be found, on
comparison, between this and the 14th psalm; the chief of which is in
the 5th verse. For Calvin’s explanation of this verse, see volume 1, p.
199. It is not easy to say whether these variations are owing to
transcribers, or whether they were made by some prophetic bard, who,
during some afflictive period of Jewish history, adapted the 14th psalm,
by a few alterations, to circumstances different from those for which it
was originally composed. Theodoret is of this last opinion, and refers
it to the alarm created by Sennacherib’s invasion under the reign of
Hezekiah; others think it was written during the captivity — a
conjecture which is founded on the last verse, “O that the salvation of
Israel were come out of Zion!”

<span id="xix-p5"></span> What <span id="xix-p5.2"></span>מהלת,
*mahalath*, signifies, in the title of this and the 88th psalm, must be
uncertain, the word not being found elsewhere. It is most probably the
name of an instrument on which the psalm was to be sung; and it may
fitly be deduced from <span id="xix-p5.3"></span>חלל, *perforavit*, or
*incidit*, either from the hollowness of the instrument, or farther,
from the holes cut in it; in which respect <span
id="xix-p5.4"></span>חליל is ordinarily used for <span
id="xix-p5.5"></span>*fistula*, or *tibia*, *a pipe*.” — *Hammond*

<span id="fn_285"></span>[286](cc09018.htm#fr_285) <span
id="xix.i-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p3"></span> “<span id="xix.i-p3.1"></span>C’est, n’en
font non plus de conscience, que de manger un morceau de pain.” — *Fr*.
*marg*. “That is, they have no more scruple in doing this than in eating
a morsel of bread.”

<span id="fn_286"></span>[287](cc09018.htm#fr_286) <span
id="xix.i-p3.2"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p4"></span> “<span id="xix.i-p4.1"></span>C’est, son
peuple captif.” — *Fr*. *marg*. “That is, his captive people.”
