<span id="vii-p1"></span>PSALM 41

<span id="vii-p2"></span>David, while he was severely afflicted by the
hand of God, perceived that he was unjustly blamed by men who regarded
him as one who had already been condemned and devoted to eternal
destruction. Under this trial he fortifies himself by the consolation of
hope. At the same time, he complains partly of the cruelty, and partly
of the treachery, of his enemies. And although he recognises the
affliction with which he is visited as a just punishment of his sins,
yet he charges his enemies with cruelty and malice, inasmuch as they
troubled and afflicted one who had always endeavored to do them good.
Finally, he records an expression of his gratitude and joy, because he
had been preserved by the grace of God.

<span id="vii-p3"></span>To the chief musician. A Psalm of David.

<span id="vii.i"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p1"></span><span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
41:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p2"></span>**1**. Blessed is he that judgeth wisely of
the poor:  <span id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) Jehovah will deliver him
 <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) in the day of evil. **2**. Jehovah
will keep him, and preserve him in life: he shall be blessed upon the
earth;  <span id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) and thou wilt not abandon
him to the will of his enemies. **3**. Jehovah will support  <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) him upon the bed of sorrow: thou hast
turned all his bed in his sickness.

<span id="vii.i-p7"></span> 

<span id="vii.i-p8"></span><span id="vii.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p9"></span>**1.** *Blessed is he that judgeth wisely of
the poor.* Interpreters are generally of opinion that the exercise of
kindness and compassion manifested in taking care of the miserable, and
helping them, is here commended. Those, however, who maintain that the
Psalmist here commends the considerate candour of those who judge wisely
and charitably of men in adversity, form a better judgment of his
meaning. Indeed, the participle <span id="vii.i-p9.1"></span>משכיל,
*maskil,* cannot be explained in any other way. At the same time, it
ought to be observed on what account it is that David declares those to
be blessed who form a wise and prudent judgment concerning the
afflictions by which God chastises his servants. We have said that he
had to contend in his own heart against the perverse judgments of
foolish and wicked men, because, when affliction was pressing heavily
upon him, many considered that he had fallen into a desperate condition,
and was altogether beyond the hope of recovery. Doubtless, it happened
to him as it did to the holy patriarch Job, whom his friends reckoned to
be one of the most wicked of men, when they saw God treating him with
great severity. And certainly it is an error which is by far too common
among men, to look upon those who are oppressed with afflictions as
condemned and reprobate. As, on the one hand, the most of men, judging
of the favor of God from an uncertain and transitory state of
prosperity, applaud the rich, and those upon whom, as they say, fortune
smiles; so, on the other hand, they act contemptuously towards the
wretched and miserable, and foolishly imagine that God hates them,
because he does not exercise so much forbearance towards them as he does
towards the reprobate. The error of which we speak, namely, that of
judging wrongfully and wickedly, is one which has prevailed in all ages
of the world. The Scriptures in many places plainly and distinctly
declare, that God, for various reasons, tries the faithful by
adversities, at one time to train them to patience, at another to subdue
the sinful affections of the flesh, at another to cleanse, and, as it
were, purify them from the remaining desires of the flesh, which still
dwell within them; sometimes to humble them, sometimes to make them an
example to others, and at other times to stir them up to the
contemplation of the divine life. For the most part, indeed, we often
speak rashly and indiscriminately concerning others, and, so to speak,
plunge even into the lowest abyss those who labor under affliction. To
restrain such a rash and unbridled spirit, David says that they are
blessed who do not suffer themselves, by speaking at random, to judge
harshly of their neighbors; but, discerning aright the afflictions by
which they are visited, mitigate, by the wisdom of the Spirit, the
severe and unjust judgments to which we are naturally so prone. I have
just adduced as an example the case of Job, whom his friends, when they
saw him involved in extreme misery, hesitated not to account an outcast,
and one whose case was altogether hopeless.  <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) If any one endued with candour, and
possessed of a humane disposition, should meet with such a case, he
would regard it in the exercise of the same discretion which David here
commends. As to ourselves, being admonished by this testimony of the
Holy Spirit, let us learn to guard against a too precipitate judgment.
We must therefore judge prudently of our brethren who are in affliction;
that is to say, we must hope well of their salvation, lest, if we
condemn them unmercifully before the time, this unjust severity in the
end fall upon our own heads. It ought, however, especially to be
observed, what indeed I have already noticed, that the object which
David had in view, when he saw himself, as it were, overwhelmed by the
malicious and cruel judgments which were expressed concerning him, was
to fortify himself by this as a ground of consolation, lest he should
sink under the temptation. If, therefore, at any time Satan should
endeavor to destroy the foundation of our faith, by the rash and
presumptuous judgments of men, let us also learn to have recourse to
this device of wisdom, lest unawares we fall into despair. This is the
proper use of the doctrine contained in this passage.

<span id="vii.i-p11"></span>*The Lord will deliver him in the day of
evil.* Some connect these words, *in the day of evil,* with the
preceding clause; and the reading thus suggested might indeed be
admitted; but the distinction which I have followed is better adapted to
the sense, and is also supported by the Hebrew accent. Thus at least the
doctrine deducible from these words is susceptible of a fuller meaning,
namely, that the Lord will deliver the poor in the day of his adversity.
Some think that David here prays for a blessing in behalf of the upright
and compassionate; as if he had said, May the Lord himself recompense
them again for their kindness, if at any time it happen that they are
grievously afflicted! Others suppose that David here records the
language of such men from which we may come to the knowledge of their
wisdom and uprightness. In my opinion, however, both are equally in
error in reading this clause in the form of a desire or prayer. Whether,
indeed, David speaks in his own name, or in the name of others, he
briefly recommends and enjoins the kindness which we ought to exercise
towards the afflicted; for although God may for a time manifest his
displeasure against them, yet he will, nevertheless, be gracious to
them, so that the issue will at length be happier and more joyful than
the judgment we might be led to form from the present aspect of things.
We now see that the sense in which I have explained this verse is much
more copious and fuller of meaning, namely, that we ought to hope for
salvation and deliverance from the hand of the Lord, even in the day of
adversity; for otherwise, no man who had once fallen into a state of
sorrow and sadness would ever be able to rise again. And this I say,
because the design of the Holy Spirit in this passage is not only to
exhort the faithful to be ready in showing kindness towards their
brethren when they see them in affliction, but also to point out the
remedy which has been provided for the mitigation of our sorrow,
whenever our faith is shaken by adversity.

<span id="vii.i-p12"></span><span id="vii.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p13"></span>**2.** *Jehovah will keep him, and preserve
him in life.* Here David follows out the same sentiment expressed in the
preceding verse, when he says that the Lord will keep the afflicted,
whose destruction cruel and unjust men represent as inevitable. It is
likewise necessary always to bear in mind the contrast which is stated
between the day of evil and the blessing of deliverance. In this verse
the expressions denoting *restoration to life,* and *blessedness on the
earth,* are of similar import. By these expressions, David means to show
that although he had been to all appearance a dead man, yet the hope of
life both for himself and for all the faithful had not been
extinguished. There might, it is true, appear some inconsistency in his
promising himself a happy life in this world, seeing our condition here
would be miserable indeed if we had not the expectation of a better
state in the world to come. But the answer to this is, that as many had
despaired of his recovery, he expressly declares that he will yet be
restored to his former state, and will continue alive, nay, that in him
there will be seen manifest tokens of the favor of God. He does not in
the least exclude by these expressions the hope of a better life after
death. What follows concerning the *bed of sorrow* has led some to form
a conjecture which, in my opinion, is not at all probable. What David
says of affliction in general, without determining what kind of
affliction, they regard as applicable exclusively to sickness. But it is
no uncommon thing for those who are sorrowful and grieved in their minds
to throw themselves upon their bed, and to seek repose; for the hearts
of men are sometimes more distressed by grief than by sickness. It is,
certainly, highly probable that David was at that time afflicted with
some very heavy calamity, which might be a token that God was not a
little displeased with him. In the second clause of the verse there is
some obscurity. Some understand the expression, *turning the bed,* in
the same sense as if God, in order to give some alleviation to his
servant in the time of trouble, had made his bed and arranged it, as we
are wont to do to those who are sick, that they may lay themselves more
softly.  <span id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) Others hold, and, in my
opinion, more correctly, that when David was restored to health, his
bed, which had formerly served him as a sick couch, was *turned,* that
is to say, changed.  <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) Thus the
sense would be, that although he now languish in sorrow, whilst the Lord
is chastening him and training him by means of affliction, yet in a
little while he will experience relief by the hand of the same God, and
thus recover his strength.

<span id="vii.ii"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p1"></span><span id="vii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
41:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#004.md)<span id="vii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p2"></span>**4**. I have said, O Jehovah! Have mercy
upon me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee. **5**. My enemies
have spoken evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish? **6**.
And if he come to see me, he speaketh lies: his heart heapeth up
iniquity to himself; when he shall have gone forth he will tell it.

<span id="vii.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="vii.ii-p4"></span><span id="vii.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p5"></span>**4.** *I have said, O Jehovah! have mercy
upon me.* By this verse he shows that in his adversity he did not seek
to soothe his mind by flattery, as the greater part of men do, who
endeavor to assuage their sorrows by some vain consolation. And,
certainly, the man who is guided by the Spirit of God will, when warned
of God by the afflictions with which he is visited, frankly acknowledge
his sins, and quietly submit to the admonitions of his brethren, nay, he
will even anticipate them by a voluntary confession. David here lays
down a mark by which he distinguishes himself from the reprobate and
wicked, when he tells us that he earnestly entreated that his sin might
not be laid to his charge, and that he had sought refuge in the mercy of
God. He indeed requests that some alleviation might be granted to him
under the affliction which he endured: but he rises to a higher source
of relief, when he asks that through the forgiveness of his sins he
might obtain reconciliation to God. Those, as we have said elsewhere,
invert the natural order of things, who seek a remedy only for the
outward miseries under which they labor, but all the while neglect the
cause of them; acting as a sick man would do who sought only to quench
his thirst, but never thought of the fever under which he labors, and
which is the chief cause of his trouble. Before David, therefore, speaks
at all of the healing of his soul, that is to say, of his life  <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) he first says, *Have mercy upon me:*
and with this we must connect the reason which immediately follows —
*for I have sinned against thee.* In saying so, he confesses that God is
justly displeased with him, and that he can only be restored again to
his favor by his sins being blotted out. I take the particle <span
id="vii.ii-p6.2"></span>כי, *ki,* in its proper and natural
signification, and not adversatively, as some would understand it. He
asks then that God would have mercy upon him because he had sinned. From
that proceeds *the healing of the soul,* which he interposes between his
prayer and confession, as being the effect of the compassion and mercy
of God; for David expects that as soon as he had obtained forgiveness,
he would also obtain relief from his affliction.

<span id="vii.ii-p7"></span><span id="vii.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p8"></span>**5.** *My enemies have spoken evil of me.
To speak* is here used in the sense of *to imprecate.* In thus
describing the unbecoming conduct of his enemies, he seeks, as has been
elsewhere said, to induce God to have mercy upon him: because the more
that God sees his own people cruelly treated, he is so much the more
disposed mercifully to succor them. Thus David, by his own example,
stirs up and encourages us to greater confidence in God; because the
more that our enemies break forth in their cruelty towards us, so much
the more does it procure for us favor in the sight of God. The terms in
which his enemies uttered this imprecation show how cruel their hatred
had been towards him, since it could only be appeased by his
destruction, and that, too, accompanied with shame and ignominy; for
they wished that with his life the very remembrance of his name should
also be blotted out.

<span id="vii.ii-p9"></span><span id="vii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p10"></span>**6.** *And if he come to see me, he
speaketh lies.* What is contained in this verse relates to his false and
treacherous friends. Those who were his professed enemies made no secret
of their enmity against him, but openly persecuted him; and that he has
already shown in the preceding verse. In addition to this, he now
complains that many came to him with professions of attachment to him,
as if they had been his friends, who, nevertheless, afterwards poured
forth their malicious ill-will in secret against him. Enemies of this
sort, who thus cover and conceal their malice, and insinuate themselves
under the mask of a fair appearance, only for the purpose of secretly
doing us mischief, are indeed much more to be feared than those who
openly declare their wicked intentions. Accordingly, having complained
of his open enemies, he proceeds to speak of his pretended friends, of
whom he declares that they come to see him with no other design than *to
speak lies,* and yet that they are meanwhile devising some deceitful and
malicious purpose against him, nay, that they are even secretly *heaping
up iniquity,* and, so to speak, laying it up in store in their hearts;
and then he adds, that when *they have gone forth* from his presence,
they manifest their hypocrisy and deceitfulness.

<span id="vii.iii"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p1"></span><span id="vii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
41:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p2"></span>**7**. All they that hate me whisper
together against me: they plot mischief against me. **8**. An evil deed
of Belial cleaveth fast to him: and he that lieth down shall never be
able to rise again. **9**. Even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted,
who eats of my bread, has lifted up the heel against me.

<span id="vii.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="vii.iii-p4"></span><span id="vii.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p5"></span>**7.** *All they that hate me whisper
together against me.* Here he seems generally to include both classes of
his enemies; those who sought to oppress him in an open manner, and in
the character of avowed enemies; and those who, under the pretense of
friendship, attempted to do the same thing by deceit and stratagem.
Accordingly, he says that all of them took counsel together about his
destruction, just as we know that wicked men hold much secret
consultation respecting their intended deeds of treachery, and whisper
to one another concerning them. Hence he adds the words *to meditate,*
or *plot,* which he employs to denote their base conspiracies and sinful
consultations.

<span id="vii.iii-p6"></span><span id="vii.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p7"></span>**8.** *An evil deed of Belial cleaved fast
to him.* From this verse it appears that they had thus conspired
together for his destruction, on the ground that they regarded him as a
wicked man, and a person worthy of a thousand deaths. The insolence and
arrogance which they manifested towards him proceeded from the false and
wicked judgment which they had formed concerning him, and of which he
made mention in the beginning of the psalm. They say, therefore, that
*an evil deed of Belial holds* him shut up, and, as it were, bound fast.
This the verb <span id="vii.iii-p7.1"></span>יצוק, *yatsuk,* properly
signifies; but in translating the verse I have followed the rendering
which is most commonly received, reading *cleaveth fast to him, etc.*
This expression is by others rendered *spreadeth upon him,* but this
interpretation seems to me to be too constrained. As to the word
*Belial,* we have already spoken of it in the eighteenth psalm. But as
grammarians maintain that it is compounded of <span
id="vii.iii-p7.3"></span>בלי, *beli,* and <span
id="vii.iii-p7.4"></span>יעל, *yaäl,* which signify *not to rise,* the
expression, *thing of Belial,* (for so it is literally in the Hebrew,) I
understand in this place as meaning an extraordinary and hateful crime,
which, as we commonly say, can never be expiated, and from which there
is no possibility of escape; unless, perhaps, some would rather refer it
to the affliction itself under which he labored, as if his enemies had
said that he was seized by some incurable malady.  <span
id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) But whatever may be as to this, his
enemies regarded it as absolutely certain that God was altogether
hostile to him, and would never be reconciled towards him, since he was
chastising him with so much severity. When they add in the following
clause, *he shall never be able to rise again,*  <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) this clearly shows that they utterly
cut off from him all hope of recovery. And certainly it was a sore
temptation to David, who had in himself the testimony of a good
conscience, to think that he was regarded by men as one who was pursued
by the vengeance of God, nay, that they even cast him headlong into
hell. But it pleased God thus to try his servant, that, trusting to the
testimony of his own conscience, he should pay no regard to what men
might say, or be troubled by the reproaches they might cast upon him. It
was also his design to teach us, by his example, that we must seek the
reward of our righteousness elsewhere than in this world, since we see
with what unequal balances the world often sets itself to estimate the
difference between virtue and vice.

<span id="vii.iii-p10"></span><span id="vii.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p11"></span>**9.** *Even the man of my peace.* As the
very height of all his miseries, David here declares that he had found
the same treachery in some one, or, indeed, in many of his greatest
friends. For the change of number is very frequent in the Hebrew
language, so that he may speak of several individuals as if they were
only one person. Thus the meaning would be: Not only the common people,
or strangers of whom I had no knowledge or acquaintance, but my greatest
friends, nay, even those with whom I was most intimate, and those of my
own household, whom I admitted to eat and drink with me at my table,
vaunt themselves reproachfully against me. Among the Hebrews, the
expression, *men of peace,* denotes their kinsfolk and connections; but
it was a much closer alliance, and one which ought to have secured a
stricter observance of the laws of friendship, *to eat the bread* of
David in company with himself: for it is as if he had employed the
appellation, My companion.  <span id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) If,
however, any would rather understand it of some particular traitor than
of several persons, I have no objection to it. *To lift up the heel* is,
in my opinion, to be understood metaphorically, and signifies *to rise
up disdainfully* against a man who is afflicted and cast down.  <span
id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) Others explain the expression by *to
lay wait secretly;* but the former interpretation is more appropriate,
That the wicked, seeing that David was placed in embarrassed
circumstances, or already prostrated in the dust, took occasion from
this to assail him indirectly indeed, but, nevertheless, always with
insolence; a thing which usually happens among people of a wicked and
servile disposition. Christ, in quoting this passage, (<span
id="vii.iii-p13.2"></span>[Joh
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#018.md)<span
id="vii.iii-p13.2"></span>,) applies it to the person of Judas. And
certainly we ought to understand that, although David speaks of himself
in this psalm, yet he speaks not as a common and private person, but as
one who represented the person of Christ, inasmuch as he was, as it
were, the example after which the whole Church should be conformed — a
point well entitled to our attention, in order that each of us may
prepare himself for the same condition. It was necessary that what was
begun in David should be fully accomplished in Christ; and, therefore,
it must of necessity come to pass, that the same thing should be
fulfilled in each of his members, namely, that they should not only
suffer from external violence and force, but also from internal foes,
ever ready to betray them, even as Paul declares that the Church shall
be assailed, not only by *“fightings* without,” but also by *“fears*
within,” (<span id="vii.iii-p13.3"></span>[2Co
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#005)<span id="vii.iii-p13.3"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.iv"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
41:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#010.md)<span id="vii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p2"></span>**10**. Do thou, O Jehovah! have mercy upon
me: raise me up, and I will recompense them. **11**. By this I know that
I have been acceptable to thee, because my enemy doth not triumph over
me. **12**. And as for me, thou wilt uphold me in my integrity,  <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) and establish me before thy face for
ever. **13**. Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, for ever and ever.
Amen and Amen.

<span id="vii.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv-p5"></span><span id="vii.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p6"></span>**10** *Do thou, O Jehovah I have mercy upon
me.* From a consideration of the wrongful cruelty of his enemies, he
again takes encouragement to pray. And there is included in what he says
a tacit contrast between God and men; as if he had said, Since there is
to be found no aid or help in the world, but as, on the contrary, a
strange degree of cruelty, or secret malice, every where prevails, be
thou, at least, O Lord! pleased to succor me by thy mercy. This is the
course which ought to be pursued by all the afflicted, whom the world
unjustly persecutes; that is to say, they ought not only to occupy
themselves in bewailing the wrongs which are done them, but they ought
also to commend their cause to God: and the more Satan endeavors to
overthrow their faith, and to distract their thoughts, the more should
they fix their minds attentively on God alone. In using such language,
the Psalmist again ascribes his restoration to the mercy of God as its
cause. What he says in the concluding clause of the verse of taking
vengeance seems harsh and unaccountable. If he confessed truly and from
the heart, in the preceding part of the psalm, that God was just in thus
afflicting him, why does he not extend forgiveness to others, as he
desires that forgiveness should be granted to himself? Surely it were a
shameful abuse of the grace of God, if, after having been restored and
pardoned by him, we should refuse to follow his example in showing
mercy. Besides, it would have been a feeling far removed from that of
humility or kindness, for David, even while he was yet in the midst of
death, to have desired revenge. But here two things are to be taken into
account: First, David was not as one of the common people, but a king
appointed by God, and invested with authority; and, secondly, It is not
from an impulse of the flesh, but in virtue of the nature of his office,
that he is led to denounce against his enemies the punishment which they
had merited. If, then, each individual indiscriminately, in taking
vengeance upon his enemies, should allege the example of David in his
own defense, it is necessary, first, to take into account the difference
which subsists between us and David, by reason of the circumstances and
position in which he was placed by God;  <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) and, secondly, it is necessary to
ascertain whether the same zeal which was in him reigns also in us, or
rather, whether we are directed and governed by the same divine Spirit.
David, being king, was entitled, in virtue of his royal authority, to
execute the vengeance of God against the wicked; but as to us our hands
are tied. In the second place, As he represented the person of Christ,
so he cherished in his heart pure and holy affections: and hence it is,
that, in speaking as he does in this verse, he indulged not his own
angry spirit, but fulfilled faithfully the duties of the station to
which he had been called of God. In short, in acting thus, he executed
the righteous judgment of God, just in the same way as it is lawful for
us to pray that the Lord himself would take vengeance upon the ungodly;
for, as we are not armed with the power of the sword, it is our duty to
have recourse to the heavenly Judge. At the same time, in beseeching him
to show himself our guardian and defender, by taking vengeance on our
enemies, we must do so in a calm and composed state of mind, and
exercise a watchful care lest we should give too loose reins to our
desires, by casting off the rule prescribed by the Spirit. As to David,
the duties of his station required that he should employ means for
subduing the rebellious, and that he should be truly the minister of God
in inflicting punishment upon all the wicked.

<span id="vii.iv-p8"></span><span id="vii.iv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p9"></span>**11** *By this I know that I have been
acceptable to thee* David now proceeds to the exercise of thanksgiving;
unless, indeed, by altering the tense of the verb, we would rather with
some read this verse in connection with the preceding, in this way: In
this I shall know that thou favorest me, if thou suffer not my enemies
to triumph over me; but it suits much better to understand it as an
expression of joy on account of some deliverance which God had
vouchsafed to him. After having offered up his prayers, he now ascribes
his deliverance to God, and speaks of it as a manifest and singular
benefit he had received from him. It might, however, be asked, whether
it is a sufficiently sure method of our coming to the knowledge of God’s
love towards us, that he does not suffer our enemies to triumph over us?
for it will often happen, that a man is delivered from danger, whom,
nevertheless, God does not regard with pleasure; and, besides, the
good-will of God towards us is known chiefly from his word, and not
simply by experience. The answer to this is easy: David was not
destitute of faith, but for the confirmation of it he took advantage of
the helps which God had afterwards added to his word. In speaking thus,
he seems to refer not only to the favor and good-will which God bears to
all the faithful in common, but to the special favor which God had
conferred upon him in choosing him to be king; as if he had said, Now,
Lord, I am more and more confirmed in the belief that thou hast
vouchsafed to adopt me to be the first-born among the kings of the
earth. Thus he extends to the whole state of the realm the help of God,
by means of which he had been delivered from some particular calamity.

<span id="vii.iv-p10"></span><span id="vii.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p11"></span>**12** *And as for me, thou wilt uphold me
in my integrity* Some expound the clause thus: That, as David followed
after uprightness, God had stretched out the hand to him. But this
interpretation does not agree very well with a preceding sentence, in
which he acknowledged that he had been justly punished by God. The
calamity which had befallen him exposed him to the insult and derision
of his enemies; but it is not likely that they were the authors of it:
and hence, it would have been out of place to have adduced his integrity
for this purpose, because the Lord is said to have respect to our
integrity, when he defends us against our enemies, and delivers us from
the outrage of men. We must therefore seek another meaning. The Hebrew
word which we have rendered *integrity* might be referred to the body as
well as the mind, thus: I shall continue *sound,* because thou wilt
preserve and establish me. He seems, however, to extend the favor of God
still farther; as if he had said, that he had been assisted not only
once by his hand, but that, during the whole course of the period he had
enjoyed prosperity, he had always been upheld in safety by the power of
God. If any would rather understand by this term the piety and sincere
disposition for which David was distinguished, — and this meaning would
be very suitable, — it will not follow from this that David boasts of
his past life, but only that he declares that, when brought to the test,
or in the midst of the conflict, even although Satan and wicked men
endeavored to shake his faith, he had not turned aside from the fear of
God. By these words, then, he bears testimony to his patience, because,
when sorely vexed and tormented, he had not forsaken the path of
uprightness. If this meaning should be adopted, it must be observed,
that this benefit, namely, that David continued invincible, and boldly
sustained these assaults of temptation, is immediately after ascribed to
God, and that for the future, David looked for preservation by no other
means than by the sustaining power of God. If the language should be
understood as referring to his external condition, this will be found to
suit equally well the scope of the passage, and the meaning will be
this, That God will never cease to manifest his favor, until he has
preserved his servants in safety, even to the end. As to the form of
expression, *that God establishes them before his face,* this is said of
those whom he defends and preserves in such a manner, that he shows by
evident tokens the paternal care which he exercises over them; as, on
the other hand, when he seems to have forgotten his own people, he is
said to hide his face from them.

<span id="vii.iv-p13"></span>**13** *Blessed be Jehovah, the God of
Israel, for ever and ever*  <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) Here
the Psalmist confirms and repeats the expression of thanksgiving
contained in a preceding verse. By calling God expressly *the God of
Israel,* he testifies that he cherished in his heart a deep and thorough
impression of the covenant which God had made with the Fathers; because
it was the source from which his deliverance proceeded. The term *amen*
is repeated twice, to express the greater vehemence, and that all the
godly might be the more effectually stirred up to praise God.

<span id="vii.i-p14"></span> Viewed in this sense, the passage is very
beautiful and highly consolatory. How refreshing is it in sickness to
have the bed turned and made anew! and this is the way in which God
refreshes and relieves the merciful man in his sickness. He acts towards
him the part of a kind nurse, turning and shaking his whole couch, and
thus making it easy and comfortable for him.

<span id="vii.iii-p8"></span> There seems some difficulty as to what is
meant by the words <span id="vii.iii-p8.1"></span>לעיעל, *debar
beliyaäl* They are literally *a word of Belial* But *word* in Hebrew is
often used for *a thing* or *matter*, <span id="vii.iii-p8.2"></span>[Ex
18:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#016.md)<span id="vii.iii-p8.2"></span>;

<span id="vii.iii-p8.4"></span>[1Ki
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1014.htm#013.md)<span id="vii.iii-p8.4"></span>.
And *Belial* is used by the Hebrews to designate any detestable
wickedness. Thus the original words bring out the meaning which Calvin
fixes upon them; and in the same sense they are understood by several
critics. Dr Geddes reads “a lawless deed;” and he explains the
expression as referring to “David’s sin in the case of Uriah; which his
enemies now assign as the cause of his present calamity; as if they had
said, ‘This sin hath at length overtaken him,’ etc.” Horsley reads,
“Some cursed thing presseth heavily upon him;” and by “some cursed
thing” he understands “the crime which they supposed to be the cause of
the divine judgment upon him.” Fry reads, “Some hellish crime cleaveth
unto him.” Cresswell adopts the interpretation of M. Flaminius: “They
say, Some load of iniquity presses upon him, (or clings to him,) so that
from the place where he lieth he will rise no more.” But there is
another sense which the words will bear. The Septuagint reads, “<span
id="vii.iii-p8.5"></span>λόγος παράνομος;” the Vulgate, “a wicked word;”
the Chaldee, “a perverse word;” the Syriac, “a word of iniquity;” and
the Arabic, “words contrary to law;” and so the expression may mean a
grievous slander or calumny. This is the sense in which it is understood
by Hammond. “And this,” says he, “is said *to cleave* to him on whom it
is fastened; it being the nature of calumnies, when strongly affixed on
any, to cleave fast, and leave some evil mark behind them: “<span
id="vii.iii-p8.6"></span>*Calumniare fortiter*, *aliquid hoerebit*.” In
our vulgar version it is “an evil disease.” And <span
id="vii.iii-p8.7"></span>דבר, *debar*, no doubt sometimes signifies a
*plague* or *pestilence* According to this rendering, the sense will be,
he is smitten with an evil disease on account of his crimes, from which
he will never recover.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[106](cc09006.htm#fr_105.md) <span
id="vii.iii-p8.8"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p9"></span> So Hammond reads with our English version,
*Now that he lieth he shall rise again no more*, and thinks that this is
a proverbial phrase which was in use among the Hebrews, and which was
applied to any sort of ruin, as well as to that which is effected by
bodily disease. “The calumniator,” he observes, “may destroy and ruin as
well as the pestilence; and from him was David’s danger most frequently,
and not from a pestilential disease.”

id="vii.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p14"></span> The Hebrew Psalter is divided into five
books. This is the end of the first book. The second ends with the 72d
psalm, the third with the 89th, the fourth with the 106th, and the fifth
with the 150th. It is worthy of remark, that each of these five books
solemnly concludes with a distinct ascription of praise to God; only no
distinct doxology appears at the end of the fifth book, probably because
the last psalm throughout is a psalm of praise. The Jewish writers
affirm that this form of benediction was added by the person who
collected and distributed The Psalms into their present state. How
ancient this division is, cannot now be clearly ascertained. Jerome, in
his Epistle to Marcella, and Epiphanius, speak of The Psalms as having
been divided by the Hebrews into five books; but when this division was
made, they do not inform us. The forms of ascription of praise, added at
the end of each of the five books, are in the Septuagint version, from
which we may conclude that this distribution had been made before that
version was executed. It was probably made by Ezra, after the return of
the Jews from Babylon to their own country, and the establishment of the
worship of God in the new temple; and it was perhaps made in imitation
of a similar distribution of the books of Moses. In making this division
of the Hebrew Psalter, regard appears to have been paid to the
subject-matter of the psalms.
