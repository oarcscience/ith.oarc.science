<span id="xvii-p1"></span>PSALM 51

<span id="xvii-p2"></span>We learn the cause which led to the
composition of this psalm from the title appended to it, and which will
immediately come under our consideration. For a long period after his
melancholy fall, David would seem to have sunk into a spiritual
lethargy; but when roused from it by the expostulation of Nathan, he was
filled with self-loathing and humiliation in the sight of God, and was
anxious both to testify his repentance to all around him, and leave some
lasting proof of it to posterity. In the commencement of the psalm,
having his eyes directed to the heinousness of his guilt, he encourages
himself to hope for pardon by considering the infinite mercy of God.
This he extols in high terms, and with a variety of expressions, as one
who felt that he deserved multiplied condemnation. In the after part of
the psalm, he prays for restoration to the favor of God, being conscious
that he deserved to have been cast off for ever, and deprived of all the
gifts of the Holy Spirit. He promises, should forgiveness be bestowed
upon him, to retain a deep and grateful sense of it. Towards the
conclusion, he declares it to be for the good of the Church that God
should grant his request; and, indeed, when the peculiar manner in which
God had deposited his covenant of grace with David is considered, it
could not but be felt that the common hope of the salvation of all must
have been shaken on the supposition of his final rejection.

<span id="xvii-p3"></span>To the chief musician. A Psalm of David, when
Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.

<span id="xvii-p4"></span>*When Nathan the prophet came to him* Express
mention is made of the prophet having come before the psalm was written,
proving, as it does, the deep lethargy into which David must have
fallen. It was a wonderful circumstance that so great a man, and one so
eminently gifted with the Spirit, should have continued in this
dangerous state for upwards of a year. Nothing but satanic influence can
account for that stupor of conscience which could lead him to despise or
slight the divine judgment, which he had incurred. It serves
additionally to mark the supineness into which he had fallen, that he
seems to have had no compunction for his sin till the prophet came to
him. We have here a striking illustration, at the same time, of the
mercy of God in sending the prophet to reclaim him when he had wandered.
In this view, there is an antithesis in the repetition of the word
*came.* It was when David came in to Bathsheba that Nathan came to him.
By that sinful step he had placed himself at a distance from God; and
the Divine goodness was signally displayed in contemplating his
restoration. We do not imagine that David, during this interval, was so
wholly deprived of the sense of religion as no longer to acknowledge the
supremacy of the Divine Being. In all probability he continued to pray
daily, engaged in the acts of Divine worship, and aimed at conforming
his life to the law of God. There is no reason to think that grace was
wholly extinct in his heart; but only that he was possessed by a spirit
of infatuation upon one particular point, and labored under a fatal
insensibility as to his present exposure to Divine wrath. Grace,
whatever sparks it might emit in other directions, was smothered, so to
speak, in this. Well may we tremble to contemplate the fact, that so
holy a prophet, and so excellent a king, should have sunk into such a
condition! That the sense of religion was not altogether extinguished in
his mind, is proved by the manner in which he was affected immediately
upon receiving the prophet’s reproof. Had such been the case, he could
not have cried out as he did, “I have sinned against the Lord,” (<span
id="xvii-p4.1"></span>[2Sa 12:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#013.md)<span
id="xvii-p4.1"></span>;) nor would he have so readily submitted himself,
in the spirit of meekness, to admonition and correction. In this
respect, he has set an example to all such as may have sinned against
God, teaching them the duty of humbly complying with the calls to
repentance, which may be addressed to them by his servants, instead of
remaining under sin till they be surprised by the final vengeance of
Heaven.

<span id="xvii.i"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p1"></span><span id="xvii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
51:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#001.md)<span id="xvii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p2"></span>**1**. Have mercy upon me, O God: according
to thy lovingkindness; according to the multitude of thy compassions,
blot out my transgressions. **2**. Multiply to wash me from mine
iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.

<span id="xvii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xvii.i-p4"></span><span id="xvii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p5"></span>**1.** *Have mercy upon me.* David begins,
as I have already remarked, by praying for pardon; and his sin having
been of an aggravated description, he prays with unwonted earnestness.
He does not satisfy himself with one petition. Having mentioned the
*loving-kindness* of the Lord, he adds *the multitude of his
compassions,* to intimate that mercy of an ordinary kind would not
suffice for so great a sinner. Had he prayed God to be favorable, simply
according to his clemency or goodness, even that would have amounted to
a confession that his case was a bad one; but when he speaks of his sin
as remissible, only through the countless multitude of the compassions
of God, he represents it as peculiarly atrocious. There is an implied
antithesis between the greatness of the mercies sought for, and the
greatness of the transgression which required them. Still more
emphatical is the expression which follows, *multiply to wash me* Some
take <span id="xvii.i-p5.1"></span>הרבה,  <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) *herebeh,* for a noun, but this is too
great a departure from the idiom of the language. The sense, on that
supposition, would indeed remain the same, That God would wash him
abundantly, and with multiplied washing; but I prefer that form of
expression which agrees best with the Hebrew idiom. This, at least, is
certain from the expression which he employs, that he felt the stain of
his sin to be deep, and to require multiplied washings. Not as if God
could experience any difficulty in cleansing the worst sinner, but the
more aggravated a man’s sin is, the more earnest naturally are his
desires to be delivered from the terrors of conscience.

<span id="xvii.i-p7"></span>The figure itself, as all are aware, is one
of frequent occurrence in Scripture. Sin resembles filth or uncleanness,
as it pollutes us, and makes us loathsome in the sight of God, and the
remission of it is therefore aptly compared to *washing* This is a truth
which should both commend the grace of God to us, and fill us with
detestation of sin. Insensible, indeed, must that heart be which is not
affected by it!

<span id="xvii.ii"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xvii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
51:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#003.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p2"></span>**3**. For I know my transgressions, and my
sin is continually before me. **4**. Against thee, thee only, have I
sinned, and done evil in thy sight; that thou mayest be justified when
thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. **5**. Behold, I was born
in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. **6**. Behold, thou
hast desired truth in the inward parts, and hast shown me wisdom in
secret.

<span id="xvii.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xvii.ii-p4"></span><span id="xvii.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p5"></span>**3.** *For If know my sins*  <span
id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) He now discovers his reason for
imploring pardon with so much vehemency, and this was the painful
disquietude which his sins caused him, and which could only be relieved
by his obtaining reconciliation with God. This proves that his prayer
did not proceed from dissimulation, as many will be found commending the
grace of God in high terms, although, in reality, they care little about
it, having never felt the bitterness of being exposed to his
displeasure. David, on the contrary, declares that he is subjected by
his sin to constant anguish of mind, and that it is this which imparts
such an earnestness to his supplications. From his example we may learn
who they are that can alone be said to seek reconciliation with God in a
proper manner. They are such as have had their consciences wounded with
a sense of sin, and who can find no rest until they have obtained
assurance of his mercy. We will never seriously apply to God for pardon,
until we have obtained such a view of our sins as inspires us with fear.
The more easily satisfied we are under our sins, the more do we provoke
God to punish them with severity, and if we really desire absolution
from his hand, we must do more than confess our guilt in words; we must
institute a rigid and formidable scrutiny into the character of our
transgressions. David does not simply say that he will confess his sins
to man, but declares that he has a deep inward feeling of them, such a
feeling of them as filled him with the keenest anguish. His was a very
different spirit from that of the hypocrite, who displays a complete
indifference upon this subject, or when it intrudes upon him, endeavors
to bury the recollection of it. He speaks of his *sins* in the plural
number. His transgression, although it sprung from one root, was
complicated, including, besides adultery, treachery and cruelty; nor was
it one man only whom he had betrayed, but the whole army which had been
summoned to the field in defense of the Church of God. He accordingly
recognises many particular sins as wrapt up in it.

<span id="xvii.ii-p7"></span><span id="xvii.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p8"></span>**4.** *Against thee, thee only, have I
sinned*  <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) It is the opinion of
some that he here adverts to the circumstance of his sin, although it
was committed against man, being concealed from every eye but that of
God. None was aware of the double wrong which he had inflicted upon
Uriah, nor of the wanton manner in which he had exposed his army to
danger; and his crime being thus unknown to men, might be said to have
been committed exclusively against God. According to others, David here
intimates, that however deeply he was conscious of having injured men,
he was chiefly distressed for having violated the law of God. But I
conceive his meaning to be, that though all the world should pardon him,
he felt that God was the Judge with whom he had to do, that conscience
hailed him to his bar, and that the voice of man could administer no
relief to him, however much he might be disposed to forgive, or to
excuse, or to flatter. His eyes and his whole soul were directed to God,
regardless of what man might think or say concerning him. To one who is
thus overwhelmed with a sense of the dreadfulness of being obnoxious to
the sentence of God, there needs no other accuser. God is to him instead
of a thousand. There is every reason to believe that David, in order to
prevent his mind from being soothed into a false peace by the flatteries
of his court, realised the judgment of God upon his offense, and felt
that this was in itself an intolerable burden, even supposing that he
should escape all trouble from the hands of his fellow-creatures. This
will be the exercise of every true penitent. It matters little to obtain
our acquittal at the bar of human judgment, or to escape punishment
through the connivance of others, provided we suffer from an accusing
conscience and an offended God. And there is, perhaps, no better remedy
against deception in the matter of our sins than to turn our thoughts
inward upon ourselves, to concentrate them upon God, and lose every
self-complacent imagination in a sharp sense of his displeasure. By a
violent process of interpretation, some would have us read the second
clause of this verse, *That thou mayest be justified when thou
speakest,* in connection with the first verse of the psalm, and consider
that it cannot be referred to the sentence immediately preceding.  <span
id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) But not to say that this breaks in
upon the order of the verses, what sense could any attach to the prayer
as it would then run, *have mercy upon me, that thou mayest be clear
when thou judgest?* etc. Any doubt upon the meaning of the words,
however, is completely removed by the connection in which they are cited
in Paul’s Epistle to the Romans,

<span id="xvii.ii-p11"></span>“For what if some did not believe? Shall
God be unjust? God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar;
as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy sayings, and
mightest overcome when thou art judged.” — <span
id="xvii.ii-p11.1"></span>[Rom. 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p12"></span>Here the words before us are quoted in
proof of the doctrine that God’s righteousness is apparent even in the
sins of men, and his truth in their falsehood. To have a clear
apprehension of their meaning, it is necessary that we reflect upon the
covenant which God had made with David. The salvation of the whole world
having been in a certain sense deposited with him by this covenant, the
enemies of religion might take occasion to exclaim upon his fall, “Here
is the pillar of the Church gone, and what is now to become of the
miserable remnant whose hopes rested upon his holiness? Once nothing
could be more conspicuous than the glory by which he was distinguished,
but mark the depth of disgrace to which he has been reduced! Who, after
so gross a fall, would look for salvation from his seed?” Aware that
such attempts might be made to impugn the righteousness of God, David
takes this opportunity of justifying it, and charging himself with the
whole guilt of the transaction. He declares that God was justified *when
he spoke* — not when he spoke the promises of the covenant, although
some have so understood the words, but justified should he have spoken
the sentence of condemnation against him for his sin, as he might have
done but for his gratuitous mercy. Two forms of expression are here
employed which have the same meaning, *that thou mayest be justified
when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest* As Paul, in the
quotation already referred to, has altered the latter clause, and may
even seem to have given a new turn to the sentiment contained in the
verse, I shall briefly show how the words were applicable to the purpose
for which they were cited by him. He adduces them to prove that God’s
faithfulness remained unaffected by the fact that the Jews had broken
his covenant, and fallen from the grace which he had promised. Now, at
first sight it may not appear how they contain the proof alleged. But
their appositeness will at once be seen if we reflect upon the
circumstance to which I have already adverted. Upon the fall of one who
was so great a pillar in the Church, so illustrious both as a prophet
and a king, as David, we cannot but believe that many were shaken and
staggered in the faith of the promises. Many must have been disposed to
conclude, considering the close connection into which God had adopted
David, that he was implicated in some measure in his fall. David,
however, repels an insinuation so injurious to the divine honor, and
declares, that although God should cast him headlong into everlasting
destruction, his mouth would be shut, or opened only to acknowledge his
unimpeachable justice. The sole departure which the apostle has made
from the passage in his quotation consists in his using the verb *to
judge* in a passive sense, and reading, *that thou mightest overcome,*
instead of, *that thou mightest be clear.* In this he follows the
Septuagint,  <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) and it is well
known that the apostles do not study verbal exactness in their
quotations from the Old Testament. It is enough for us to be satisfied,
that the passage answers the purpose for which it was adduced by the
apostle. The general doctrine which we are taught from the passage is,
that whatever sins men may commit are chargeable entirely upon
themselves, and never can implicate the righteousness of God. Men are
ever ready to arraign his administration, when it does not correspond
with the judgment of sense and human reason. But should God at any time
raise persons from the depth of obscurity to the highest distinction,
or, on the other hand, allow persons who occupied a most conspicuous
station to be suddenly precipitated from it, we should learn from the
example which is here set before us to judge of the divine procedure
with sobriety, modesty, and reverence and to rest satisfied that it is
holy, and that the works of God, as well as his words, are characterised
by unerring rectitude. The conjunction in the verse, *that-that thou
mayest be justified,* denotes not so much cause as consequence. It was
not the fall of David, properly speaking, which caused the glory of
God’s righteousness to appear. And yet, although men when they sin seem
to obscure his righteousness, it emerges from the foul attempt only more
bright than ever, it being the peculiar work of God to bring light out
of darkness.

<span id="xvii.ii-p14"></span><span id="xvii.ii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p15"></span>**5** *Behold, I was born in iniquity,*
etc He now proceeds further than the mere acknowledgement of one or of
many sins, confessing that he brought nothing but sin with him into the
world, and that his nature was entirely depraved. He is thus led by the
consideration of one offense of peculiar atrocity to the conclusion that
he was born in iniquity, and was absolutely destitute of all spiritual
good. Indeed, every sin should convince us of the general truth of the
corruption of our nature. The Hebrew word <span
id="xvii.ii-p15.1"></span>יחמתני, *yechemathni,* signifies literally,
*hath warmed herself of me,* from <span id="xvii.ii-p15.2"></span>יחם,
*yacham,* or <span id="xvii.ii-p15.3"></span>חמם, *chamam, to warm;* but
interpreters have very properly rendered it *hath conceived me.* The
expression intimates that we are cherished in sin from the first moment
that we are in the womb. David, then, is here brought, by reflecting on
one particular transgression, to east a retrospective glance upon his
whole past life, and to discover nothing but sin in it. And let us not
imagine that he speaks of the corruption of his nature, merely as
hypocrites will occasionally do, to excuse their faults, saying, “I have
sinned it may be, but what could I do? We are men, and prone by nature
to everything which is evil.” David has recourse to no such stratagems
for evading the sentence of God, and refers to original sin with the
view of aggravating his guilt, acknowledging that he had not contracted
this or that sin for the first time lately, but had been born into the
world with the seed of every iniquity.

<span id="xvii.ii-p16"></span>The passage affords a striking testimony
in proof of original sin entailed by Adam upon the whole human family.
It not only teaches the doctrine, but may assist us in forming a correct
idea of it. The Pelagians, to avoid what they considered the absurdity
of holding that all were ruined through one man’s transgression,
maintained of old, that sin descended from Adam only through force of
imitation. But the Bible, both in this and other places, clearly asserts
that we are born in sin, and that it exists within us as a disease fixed
in our nature. David does not charge it upon his parents, nor trace his
crime to them, but sists himself before the Divine tribunal, confesses
that he was formed in sin, and that he was a transgressor ere he saw the
light of this world. It was therefore a gross error in Pelagius to deny
that sin was hereditary, descending in the human family by contagion.
The Papists, in our own day, grant that the nature of man has become
depraved, but they extenuate original sin as much as possible, and
represent it as consisting merely in an inclination to that which is
evil. They restrict its seat besides to the inferior part of the soul
and the gross appetites; and while nothing is more evident from
experience than that corruption adheres to men through life, they deny
that it remains in them subsequently to baptism. We have no adequate
idea of the dominion of sin, unless we conceive of it as extending to
every part of the soul, and acknowledge that both the mind and heart of
man have become utterly corrupt. The language of David sounds very
differently from that of the Papists, *I was formed in iniquity, and in
sin did my mother conceive me* He says nothing of his grosser appetites,
but asserts that sin cleaved by nature to every part of him without
exception.

<span id="xvii.ii-p17"></span>Here the question has been started, How
sin is transmitted from the parents to the children? And this question
has led to another regarding the transmission of the soul, many denying
that corruption can be derived from the parent to the child, except on
the supposition of one soul being begotten of the substance of another.
Without entering upon such mysterious discussions, it is enough that we
hold, that Adam, upon his fall, was despoiled of his original
righteousness, his reason darkened, his will perverted, and that, being
reduced to this state of corruption, he brought children into the world
resembling himself in character. Should any object that generation is
confined to bodies, and that souls can never derive anything in common
from one another, I would reply, that Adam, when he was endued at his
creation with the gifts of the Spirit, did not sustain a private
character, but represented all mankind, who may be considered as having
been endued with these gifts in his person; and from this view it
necessarily follows that when he fell, we all forfeited along with him
our original integrity.  <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md)

<span id="xvii.ii-p19"></span><span id="xvii.ii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p20"></span>**6.** *Behold, thou hast desired truth,
etc.* This verse confirms the remark which we already made, that David
was far from seeking to invent an apology for his sin, when he traced it
back to the period of his conception, and rather intended by this to
acknowledge that from his very infancy he was an heir of eternal death.
He thus represents his whole life to have been obnoxious to
condemnation. So far is he from imitating those who arraign God as the
author of sin, and impiously suggest that he might have given man a
better nature, that in the verse now before us he opposes God’s judgment
to our corruption, insinuating, that every time we appear before him, we
are certain of being condemned, inasmuch as we are born in sin, while he
delights in holiness and uprightness. He goes further, and asserts, that
in order to meet the approval of God, it is not enough that our lives be
conformed to the letter of his law, unless our heart be clean and
purified from all guile. He tells us that God desires truth in *the
inward parts,*  <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) intimating to
us, that secret as well as outward and gross sins excite his
displeasure. In the second clause of the verse, he aggravates his
offense by confessing that he could not plead the excuse of ignorance.
He had been sufficiently instructed by God in his duty. Some interpret
<span id="xvii.ii-p21.6"></span>בסתום, *besathum,* as if he here
declared that God had discovered secret mysteries to him, or things
hidden from the human understanding. He seems rather to mean that wisdom
had been discovered to his mind in a secret and intimate manner.  <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) The one member of the verse responds
to the other. He acknowledges that it was not a mere superficial
acquaintance with divine truth which he had enjoyed, but that it had
been closely brought home to his heart. This rendered his offense the
more inexcusable. Though privileged so highly with the saving knowledge
of the truth, he had plunged into the commission of brutish sin, and by
various acts of iniquity had almost ruined his soul.

<span id="xvii.ii-p23"></span>We have thus set before us the exercise of
the Psalmist at this time. First, we have seen that he is brought to a
confession of the greatness of his offense: this leads him to a sense of
the complete depravity of his nature: to deepen his convictions, he then
directs his thoughts to the strict judgment of God, who looks not to the
outward appearance but the heart; and, lastly, he adverts to the
peculiarity of his case, as one who had enjoyed no ordinary measure of
the gifts of the Spirit, and deserved on that account the severer
punishment. The exercise is such as we should all strive to imitate. Are
we conscious of having committed any one sin, let it be the means of
recalling others to our recollection, until we are brought to prostrate
ourselves before God in deep self-abasement. And if it has been our
privilege to enjoy the special teaching of the Spirit of God, we ought
to feel that our guilt is additionally heavy, having sinned in this case
against light, and having trampled under foot the precious gifts with
which we were intrusted.

<span id="xvii.iii"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xvii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
51:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#007.md)<span id="xvii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p2"></span>**7**. Thou shalt purge me with hyssop,
and I shall be clean; thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than the
snow. **8**. Make me to hear joy and gladness; and the bones which thou
hast broken shall rejoice. **9**. Hide thy face from my sins, and blot
out all mine iniquities.

<span id="xvii.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xvii.iii-p4"></span><span id="xvii.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p5"></span>**7.** *Thou shalt purge me with hyssop*
He still follows out the same strain of supplication; and the repetition
of his requests for pardon proves how earnestly he desired it. He speaks
of *hyssop*  <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) *,* in allusion to
the ceremonies of the law; and though he was far from putting his trust
in the mere outward symbol of purification, he knew that, like every
other legal rite, it was instituted for an important end. The sacrifices
were seals of the grace of God. In them, therefore, he was anxious to
find assurance of his reconciliation; and it is highly proper that, when
our faith is disposed at any time to waver, we should confirm it by
improving such means of divine support. All which David here prays for
is, that God would effectually accomplish, in his experience, what he
had signified to his Church and people by these outward rites; and in
this he has set us a good example for our imitation. It is no doubt to
the blood of Christ alone that we must look for the atonement of our
sins; but we are creatures of sense, who must see with our eyes, and
handle with our hands; and it is only by improving the outward symbols
of propitiation that we can arrive at a full and assured persuasion of
it. What we have said of the *hyssop* applies also to the *washings*
 <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) referred to in this verse, and
which were commonly practiced under the Law. They figuratively
represented our being purged from all iniquity, in order to our
reception into the divine favor. I need not say that it is the peculiar
work of the Holy Spirit to sprinkle our consciences inwardly with the
blood of Christ, and, by removing the sense of guilt, to secure our
access into the presence of God.

<span id="xvii.iii-p8"></span>In the two verses which follow, the
Psalmist prays that God would be pacified towards him. Those put too
confined a meaning upon the words who have suggested that, in praying
*to hear the voice of joy and gladness,* he requests some prophet to be
sent, who might assure him of pardon. He prays, in general, for
testimonies of the divine favor. When he speaks of his *bones* as having
been *broken,* he alludes to the extreme grief and overwhelming distress
to which he had been reduced. The joy of the Lord would reanimate his
soul; and this joy he describes as to be obtained by *hearing;* for it
is the word of God alone which can first and effectually cheer the heart
of any sinner. There is no true or solid peace to be enjoyed in the
world except in the way of reposing upon the promises of God. Those who
do not resort to them may succeed for a time in hushing or evading the
terrors of conscience, but they must ever be strangers to true inward
comfort. And, granting that they may attain to the peace of
insensibility, this is not a state which could satisfy any man who has
seriously felt the fear of the Lord. The joy which he desires is that
which flows from hearing the word of God, in which he promises to pardon
our guilt, and readmit us into his favor. It is this alone which
supports the believer amidst all the fears, dangers, and distresses of
his earthly pilgrimage; for the joy of the Spirit is inseparable from
faith. When God is said, in the 9th verse, to *hide his face* from our
sins, this signifies his pardoning them, as is explained in the clause
immediately annexed — *Blot out all my sins.* This represents our
justification as consisting in a voluntary act of God, by which he
condescends to forget all our iniquities; and it represents our
cleansing to consist in the reception of a gratuitous pardon. We repeat
the remark which has been already made, that David, in thus reiterating
his one request for the mercy of God, evinces the depth of that anxiety
which he felt for a favor which his conduct had rendered difficult of
attainment. The man who prays for pardon in a mere formal manner, is
proved to be a stranger to the dreadful desert of sin. “Happy is the
man,” said Solomon, “that feareth alway,” (<span
id="xvii.iii-p8.1"></span>[Pr
28:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#014.md)<span
id="xvii.iii-p8.1"></span>.)

<span id="xvii.iii-p9"></span>But here it may be asked why David needed
to pray so earnestly for the joy of remission, when he had already
received assurance from the lips of Nathan that his sin was pardoned?
(<span id="xvii.iii-p9.1"></span>[2Sa
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#013.md)<span
id="xvii.iii-p9.1"></span>.) Why did he not embrace this absolution? and
was he not chargeable with dishonoring God by disbelieving the word of
his prophet? We cannot expect that God will send us angels in order to
announce the pardon which we require. Was it not said by Christ, that
whatever his disciples remitted on earth would be remitted in heaven?
(<span id="xvii.iii-p9.2"></span>[Joh
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023.md)<span
id="xvii.iii-p9.2"></span>.) And does not the apostle declare that
ministers of the gospel are ambassadors to reconcile men to God? (<span
id="xvii.iii-p9.3"></span>[2Co
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#020)<span id="xvii.iii-p9.3"></span>..md)
From this it might appear to have argued unbelief in David, that,
notwithstanding the announcement of Nathan, he should evince a remaining
perplexity or uncertainty regarding his forgiveness. There is a twofold
explanation which may be given of the difficulty. We may hold that
Nathan did not immediately make him aware of the fact that God was
willing to be reconciled to him. In Scripture, it is well known, things
are not always stated according to the strict order of time in which
they occurred. It is quite conceivable that, having thrown him into this
situation of distress, God might keep him in it for a considerable
interval, for his deeper humiliation; and that David expresses in these
verses the dreadful anguish which he endured when challenged with his
crime, and not yet informed of the divine determination to pardon it.
Let us take the other supposition, however, and it by no means follows
that a person may not be assured of the favor of God, and yet show great
earnestness and importunity in praying for pardon. David might be much
relieved by the announcement of the prophet, and yet be visited
occasionally with fresh convictions, influencing him to have recourse to
the throne of grace. However rich and liberal the offers of mercy may be
which God extends to us, it is highly proper on our part that we should
reflect upon the grievous dishonor which we have done to his name, and
be filled with due sorrow on account of it. Then our faith is weak, and
we cannot at once apprehend the full extent of the divine mercy; so that
there is no reason to be surprised that David should have once and again
renewed his prayers for pardon, the more to confirm his belief in it.
The truth is, that we cannot properly pray for the pardon of sin until
we have come to a persuasion that God will be reconciled to us. Who can
venture to open his mouth in God’s presence unless he be assured of his
fatherly favor? And pardon being the first thing we should pray for, it
is plain that there is no inconsistency in having a persuasion of the
grace of God, and yet proceeding to supplicate his forgiveness. In proof
of this, I might refer to the Lord’s Prayer, in which we are taught to
begin by addressing God as our Father, and yet afterwards to pray for
the remission of our sins. God’s pardon is full and complete; but our
faith cannot take in his overflowing goodness, and it is necessary that
it should distil to us drop by drop. It is owing to this infirmity of
our faith, that we are often found repeating and repeating again the
same petition, not with the view surely of gradually softening the heart
of God to compassion, but because we advance by slow and difficult steps
to the requisite fullness of assurance. The mention which is here made
of *purging with hyssop,* and of *washing* or *sprinkling,* teaches us,
in all our prayers for the pardon of sin, to have our thoughts directed
to the great sacrifice by which Christ has reconciled us to God.
“Without shedding of blood,” says Paul, “is no remissions” (<span
id="xvii.iii-p9.4"></span>[Heb
9:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#022)<span id="xvii.iii-p9.4"></span>;.md)
and this, which was intimated by God to the ancient Church under
figures, has been fully made known by the coming of Christ. The sinner,
if he would find mercy, must look to the sacrifice of Christ, which
expiated the sins of the world, glancing, at the same time, for the
confirmation of his faith, to Baptism and the Lord’s Supper; for it were
vain to imagine that God, the Judge of the world, would receive us again
into his favor in any other way than through a satisfaction made to his
justice.

<span id="xvii.iv-p1"></span><span id="xvii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
51:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#010.md)<span
id="xvii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p2"></span>**10**. Create in me a clean heart, O God!
and renew a right spirit  <span id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) in my
inward parts. **11**. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not
the Spirit of thy holiness from me. **12**. Restore unto me the joy of
thy salvation, and uphold me with a free spirit.

<span id="xvii.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.iv-p5"></span><span id="xvii.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p6"></span>**10** *Create in me a clean heart, O God!*
In the previous part of the psalm David has been praying for pardon. He
now requests that the grace of the Spirit, which he had forfeited, or
deserved to have forfeited, might be restored to him. The two requests
are quite distinct, though sometimes confounded together, even by men of
learning. He passes from the subject of the gratuitous remission of sin
to that of sanctification. And to this he was naturally led with earnest
anxiety, by the consciousness of his having merited the loss of all the
gifts of the Spirit, and of his having actually, in a great measure,
lost them. By employing the term *create,* he expresses his persuasion
that nothing less than a miracle could effect his reformation, and
emphatically declares that repentance is the gift of God. The Sophists
grant the necessity of the aids of the Spirit, and allow that assisting
grace must both go before and come after; but by assigning a middle
place to the free will of man, they rob God of a great part of his
glory. David, by the word which he here uses, describes the work of God
in renewing the heart in a manner suitable to its extraordinary nature,
representing it as the formation of a new creature.

<span id="xvii.iv-p7"></span>As he had already been endued with the
Spirit, he prays in the latter part of the verse that *God would renew a
right spirit within him* But by the term *create,* which he had
previously employed, he acknowledges that we are indebted entirely to
the grace of God, both for our first regeneration, and, in the event of
our falling, for subsequent restoration. He does not merely assert that
his heart and spirit were weak, requiring divine assistance, but that
they must remain destitute of all purity and rectitude till these be
communicated from above. By this it appears that our nature is entirely
corrupt: for were it possessed of any rectitude or purity, David would
not, as in this verse, have called the one *a gift of the Spirit,* and
the other *a creation.*

<span id="xvii.iv-p8"></span>In the verse which follows, he presents the
same petition, in language which implies the connection of pardon with
the enjoyment of the leading of the Holy Spirit. If God reconcile us
gratuitously to himself, it follows that he will guide us by the Spirit
of adoption. It is only such as he loves, and has numbered among his own
children, that he blesses with a share of his Spirit; and David shows
that he was sensible of this when he prays for the continuance of the
grace of adoption as indispensable to the continued possession of the
Spirit. The words of this verse imply that the Spirit had not altogether
been taken away from him, however much his gifts had been temporarily
obscured. Indeed, it is evident that he could not be altogether divested
of his former excellencies, for he seems to have discharged his duties
as a king with credit, to have conscientiously observed the ordinances
of religion, and to have regulated his conduct by the divine law. Upon
one point he had fallen into a deadly lethargy, but he was not given
over to a reprobate mind;” and it is scarcely conceivable that the
rebuke of Nathan the prophet should have operated so easily and so
suddenly in arousing him, had there been no latent spark of godliness
still remaining in his soul. He prays, it is true, that his spirit may
be *renewed,* but this must be understood with a limitation. The truth
on which we are now insisting is an important one, as many learned men
have been inconsiderately drawn into the opinion that the elect, by
falling into mortal sin, may lose the Spirit altogether, and be
alienated from God. The contrary is clearly declared by Peter, who tells
us that the word by which we are born again is an incorruptible seed,
(<span id="xvii.iv-p8.1"></span>[1Pe
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023)<span id="xvii.iv-p8.1"></span>;.md)
and John is equally explicit in informing us that the elect are
preserved from falling away altogether, (<span
id="xvii.iv-p8.2"></span>[1Jo 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009.md)<span
id="xvii.iv-p8.2"></span>.) However much they may appear for a time to
have been cast off by God, it is afterwards seen that grace must have
been alive in their breast, even during that interval when it seemed to
be extinct. Nor is there any force in the objection that David speaks as
if he feared that he might be deprived of the Spirit. It is natural that
the saints, when they have fallen into sin, and have thus done what they
could to expel the grace of God, should feel an anxiety upon this point;
but it is their duty to hold fast the truth that grace is the
incorruptible seed of God, which never can perish in any heart where it
has been deposited. This is the spirit displayed by David. Reflecting
upon his offense, he is agitated with fears, and yet rests in the
persuasion that, being a child of God, he would not be deprived of what
indeed he had justly forfeited.

<span id="xvii.iv-p9"></span><span id="xvii.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p10"></span>**12** *Restore unto me the joy of thy
salvation* He cannot dismiss his grief of mind until he have obtained
peace with God. This he declares once and again, for David had no
sympathy with those who can indulge themselves in ease when they are
lying under the divine displeasure. In the latter clause of the verse,
he prays as in the verses preceding, that the Holy Spirit might not be
taken away from him. There is a slight ambiguity in the words. Some take
<span id="xvii.iv-p10.1"></span>תסמכני, *thismecheni,* to be the third
person of the verb, because <span id="xvii.iv-p10.2"></span>רוח,
*ruach,* is feminine, and translate, *let the Spirit uphold me.* The
difference is immaterial, and does not affect the meaning of the
passage. There is more difficulty in fixing the sense of the epithet
<span id="xvii.iv-p10.3"></span>נדיבה*, nedibah,* which I have
translated *free* As the verb <span id="xvii.iv-p10.4"></span>נדב,
*nadab,* signifies *to deal liberally,* princes are in the Hebrew
called, by way of eminence, <span id="xvii.iv-p10.5"></span>נדיבים,
*nedibim,* which has led several learned men to think that David speaks
here of a *princely* or *royal* spirit; and the translators of the
Septuagint rendered it accordingly <span
id="xvii.iv-p10.6"></span>ἡγεμονικον. The prayer, in this sense, would
no doubt be a suitable one for David, who was a king, and required a
heroical courage for the execution of his office. But it seems better to
adopt the more extensive meaning, and to suppose that David, under a
painful consciousness of the bondage to which he had been reduced by a
sense of guilt, prays for a free and cheerful spirit.  <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) This invaluable attainment, he was
sensible, could only be recovered through divine grace.

<span id="xvii.v"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p1"></span><span id="xvii.v-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
51:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#013.md)<span id="xvii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p2"></span>**13**. I will teach transgressors thy ways,
and sinners shall be converted unto thee. **14**. Deliver me from
bloods, O God! thou God of my salvation, and my tongue shall sing aloud
with joy of thy righteousness. **15**. O Lord! open thou my lips, and my
mouth shall show forth thy praise.

<span id="xvii.v-p3"></span> 

<span id="xvii.v-p4"></span><span id="xvii.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p5"></span>**13** *I will teach transgressors thy ways*
Here he speaks of the gratitude which he would feel should God answer
his prayer, and engages to show it by exerting himself in effecting the
conversion of others by his example. Those who have been mercifully
recovered from their falls will feel inflamed by the common law of
charity to extend a helping hand to their brethren; and in general, such
as are partakers of the grace of God are constrained by religious
principle, and regard for the divine glory, to desire that others should
be brought into the participation of it. The sanguine manner in which he
expresses his expectation of converting others is not unworthy of our
notice. We are too apt to conclude that our attempts at reclaiming the
ungodly are vain and ineffectual, and forget that God is able to crown
them with success.

<span id="xvii.v-p6"></span><span id="xvii.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p7"></span>**14** *Deliver me from bloods* His
recurring so often to petitions for pardon, proves how far David was
from flattering himself with unfounded hopes, and what a severe struggle
he sustained with inward terrors. According to some, he prays in this
verse to be delivered from the guilt of the blood of Uriah, and, in
general, of the whole army.  <span id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) But
the term *bloods* in Hebrew may denote any capital crime, and, in my
opinion, he is here to be considered as alluding to the sentence of
death, to which he felt himself to be obnoxious, and from which he
requests deliverance. By *the righteousness of God,* which he engages to
celebrate, we are to understand his goodness; for this attribute, as
usually ascribed to God in the Scriptures, does not so much denote the
strictness with which he exacts vengeance, as his faithfulness in
fulfilling the promises and extending help to all who seek him in the
hour of need. There is much emphasis and vehemency in the mode of his
address, *O God! the God of my salvation,* intimating at once how
tremblingly he was alive to the danger of his situation, and how
strongly his faith terminated upon God as the ground of his hope.
Similar is the strain of the verse which follows. He prays that *his
lips may be opened;* in other words, that God would afford him matter of
praise. The meaning usually attached to the expression is, that God
would so direct his tongue by the Spirit as to fit him for singing his
praises. But though it is true that God must supply us with words, and
that if he do not, we cannot fail to be silent in his praise, David
seems rather to intimate that his mouth must be shut until God called
him to the exercise of thanksgiving by extending pardon. In another
place we find him declaring that a new song had been put in his mouth,
(<span id="xvii.v-p8.6"></span>[Ps
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003.md)<span
id="xvii.v-p8.6"></span>,)and it seems to be in this sense that he here
desires his lips to be opened. He again signifies the gratitude which he
would feel, and which he would express, intimating, that he sought the
mercy of God with no other view than that he might become the herald of
it to others. *My mouth,* he says emphatically, *shall show forth thy
praise.*

<span id="xvii.vi"></span>

51:16-19](../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#016.md)<span

<span id="xvii.vi-p2"></span>**16**. For thou wilt not accept a
sacrifice; though I should give  <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md)
a burnt offering, it would not please thee. **17**. The sacrifices of
God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God! thou wilt

<span id="xvii.vi-p6"></span> 

<span id="xvii.vi-p7"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p8"></span>**16.** *For thou wilt not accept a
sacrifice* By this language he expresses his confidence of obtaining
pardon, although he brought nothing to God in the shape of compensation,
but relied entirely upon the riches of Divine mercy. He confesses that
he comes to God both poor and needy; but is persuaded that this will not
prevent the success of his suit, because God attaches no importance to
sacrifices. In this he indirectly reproves the Jews for an error which
prevailed amongst them in all ages. In proclaiming that the sacrifices
made expiation for sin, the Law had designed to withdraw them from all
trust in their own works to the one satisfaction of Christ; but they
presumed to bring their sacrifices to the altar as a price by which they
hoped to procure their own redemption. In opposition to this proud and
preposterous notion, David declares that God had no delight in
sacrifices,  <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) and that he had
nothing to present which could purchase his favor. God had enjoined the
observance of sacrifice, and David was far from neglecting it. He is not
to be understood as asserting that the rite might warrantably be
omitted, or that God would absolutely reject the sacrifices of his own
institution, which, along with the other ceremonies of the Law, proved
important helps, as we have already observed, both to David and the
whole Church of God. He speaks of them as observed by the proud and the
ignorant, under an impression of meriting the divine favor. Diligent as
he was, therefore, in the practice of sacrifice, resting his whole
dependence upon the satisfaction of Christ, who atoned for the sins of
the world, he could yet honestly declare that he brought nothing to God
in the shape of compensation, and that he trusted entirely to a
gratuitous reconciliation. The Jews, when they presented their
sacrifices, could not be said to bring anything of their own to the
Lord, but must rather be viewed as borrowing from Christ the necessary
purchase-money of redemption. They were passive, not active, in this
divine service.

<span id="xvii.vi-p10"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p11"></span>**17** *The sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit.* He had shown that sacrifices have no such efficacy in procuring
the Divine favor as the Jews imagined; and now he declares that he
needed to bring nothing whatever to God but a contrite and humbled
heart. Nothing more is necessary, on the part of the sinner, than to
prostrate himself in supplication for Divine mercy. The plural number is
used in the verse to express more forcibly the truth, that the sacrifice
of repentance is enough in itself without any other. Had he said no more
than that this kind of sacrifice was peculiarly acceptable to God, the
Jews might easily have evaded his argument by alleging that this might
be true, and yet other sacrifices be equally agreeable in his sight;
just as the Papists in our own day mix up the grace of God with their
own works, rather than submit to receive a gratuitous pardon for their
sins. In order to exclude every idea of a pretended satisfaction, David
represents contrition of heart as comprehending in itself the whole sum
of acceptable sacrifices. And in using the term *sacrifices of God,* he
conveys a tacit reproof to the proud hypocrite, who sets a high value
upon such sacrifices as are of his own unauthorised fancy, when he
imagines that by means of them he can propitiate God. But here a
difficulty may be started. “If the contrite heart,” it may be said,
“hold a higher place in the estimation of God than all sacrifices, does
it not follow that we acquire pardon by our penitence, and that thus it
ceases to be gratuitous?” In reply to this, I might observe, that David
is not speaking at this time of the meritorious condition by which
pardon is procured, but, on the contrary, asserting our absolute
destitution of merit by enjoining humiliation and contrition of spirit,
in opposition to everything like an attempt to render a compensation to
God. The man of broken spirit is one who has been emptied of all
vain-glorious confidence, and brought to acknowledge that he is nothing.
The contrite heart abjures the idea of merit, and has no dealings with
God upon the principle of exchange. Is it objected, that faith is a more
excellent sacrifice that that which is here commended by the Psalmist,
and of greater efficacy in procuring the Divine favor, as it presents to
the view of God that Savior who is the true and only propitiation? I
would observe, that faith cannot be separated from the humility of which
David speaks. This is such a humility as is altogether unknown to the
wicked. They may tremble in the presence of God, and the obstinacy and
rebellion of their hearts may be partially restrained, but they still
retain some remainders of inward pride. Where the spirit has been
broken, on the other hand, and the heart has become contrite, through a
felt sense of the anger of the Lord, a man is brought to genuine fear
and self-loathing, with a deep conviction that of himself he can do or
deserve nothing, and must be indebted unconditionally for salvation to
Divine mercy. That this should be represented by David as constituting
all which God desires in the shape of sacrifice, need not excite our
surprise. He does not exclude faith, he does not condescend upon any
nice division of true penitence into its several parts, but asserts in
general, that the only way of obtaining the favor of God is by
prostrating ourselves with a wounded heart at the feet of his Divine
mercy, and supplicating his grace with ingenuous confessions of our own
helplessness.

<span id="xvii.vi-p12"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p13"></span>**18** *Do good to Zion in thy good
pleasure: build thou the walls of Jerusalem*  <span
id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) From prayer in his own behalf he now
proceeds to offer up supplications for the collective Church of God, a
duty which he may have felt to be the more incumbent upon him from the
circumstance of his having done what he could by his fall to ruin it,
Raised to the throne, and originally anointed to be king for the very
purpose of fostering the Church of God, he had by his disgraceful
conduct nearly accomplished its destruction. Although chargeable with
this guilt, he now prays that God would restore it in the exercise of
his free mercy. He makes no mention of the righteousness of others, but
rests his plea entirely upon the good pleasure of God, intimating that
the Church, when at any period it has been brought low, must be indebted
for its restoration solely to Divine grace. Jerusalem was already built,
but David prays that God would build it still farther for he knew that
it fell far short of being complete, so long as it wanted the temple,
where he had promised to establish the Ark of his Covenant, and also the
royal palace. We learn from the passage, that it is God’s own work to
build the Church. “His foundation,” says the Psalmist elsewhere, “is in
the holy mountains,” (<span id="xvii.vi-p14.4"></span>[Ps
87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001)<span id="xvii.vi-p14.4"></span>..md)
We are not to imagine that David refers simply to the Church as a
material structure, but must consider him as having his eye fixed upon
the spiritual temple, which cannot be raised by human skill or industry.
It is true, indeed, that men will not make progress even in the building
of material walls, unless their labor be blessed from above; but the
Church is in a peculiar sense the erection of God, who has founded it
upon the earth in the exercise of his mighty power, and who will exalt
it higher than the heavens. In this prayer David does not contemplate
the welfare of the Church for a short period merely, but prays that God
would preserve and advance it till the coming of Christ. And here, may
it not justly excite our surprise, to find one who, in the preceding
part of the psalm, had employed the language of distress and almost of
despair, now inspired with the confidence necessary for commending the
whole Church to the care of God? How comes it about, may we not ask,
that one who so narrowly escaped destruction himself, should now appear
as a guide to conduct others to salvation? In this we have a striking
proof, that, provided we obtain reconciliation with God, we may not only
expect to be inspired with confidence in praying for our own salvation,
but may hope to be admitted as intercessors in behalf of others, and
even to be advanced to the higher honor still, of commending into the
hands of God the glory of the Redeemer’s kingdom.

<span id="xvii.vi-p15"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p16"></span>**19** *Then shalt thou accept sacrifices
of righteousness* In these words there is an apparent, but only an
apparent, inconsistency with others which he had used in the preceding
context. He had declared sacrifices to be of no value when considered in
themselves, but now he acknowledges them to be acceptable to God when
viewed as expressions or symbols of faith, penitence, and thanksgiving.
He calls them distinctly *sacrifices of righteousness,* right,
warrantable, and such as are offered in strict accordance with the
commandment of God. The expression is the same employed in <span
id="xvii.vi-p16.1"></span>[Ps 4:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#005.md)<span
id="xvii.vi-p16.1"></span>, where David uses it with a tacit
condemnation of those who gloried in the mere outward form of
ceremonies. We find him again exciting himself and others by his example
to the exercise of gratitude, and to the expression of it openly in the
solemn assembly. Besides sacrifices in general, two particular kinds of
sacrifice are specified. Although some consider <span
id="xvii.vi-p16.2"></span>כליל, *calil,* and <span
id="xvii.vi-p16.3"></span>עולה, *olah,* to be both of one signification,
others maintain with more correctness, that the first is to be
understood as meaning the priest’s sacrifice, because in it the offering
was consumed or burnt with fire.  <span
id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md) In the enumeration which he makes,
David designs to teach us that none of all the legal rites can find
acceptance with God, unless they be used with a reference to the proper
end of their institution. The whole of this verse has been figuratively
applied by some to the kingdom of Christ, but the interpretation is
unnatural and too refined. Thanksgivings are indeed called by Hosea “the
calves of the lips,” (<span id="xvii.vi-p17.4"></span>[Ho
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002)<span id="xvii.vi-p17.4"></span>;.md)
but it seems evident that in the passage before us there are conjoined
along with the frame or disposition of the heart those solemn ceremonies
which constituted part of the ancient worship.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[260](cc09016.htm#fr_259.md) <span
id="xvii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p9"></span> From the confession which David makes in
this verse, “Against thee, thee *only*, have I sinned,” Horsley is of
opinion that the title of the psalm is not authentic, and that it could
not have been composed on the occasion to which the title refers. “It
ill suits the case of David,” says he, “who laid a successful plot
against Uriah after he had defiled his bed.” But there seems to be no
force in this objection. The prefix <span id="xvii.ii-p9.1"></span>ל,
*lamed*, translated *against*, sometimes means *before*, *in the
presence of*, and is so rendered in <span id="xvii.ii-p9.2"></span>[Ge
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#011.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p9.2"></span>,
and 45:1. The Hebrew words <span id="xvii.ii-p9.3"></span>לך לברך,
*lecha*, *lebaddecha*, may, therefore be rendered, “before thee, before
thee only.” If this reading is adopted, then, David alludes to the
clandestine manner in which he committed the sin, intimating that it was
a secret sin witnessed by God only, and known in the first instance only
to him, God says of it, “For thou didst it secretly,” (<span
id="xvii.ii-p9.4"></span>[2Sa
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#012)<span id="xvii.ii-p9.4"></span>..md)
There is, however, no need to alter the translation to meet the
objection of Horsley. By these words, “Against thee, thee only,” David
does not mean to say that he had not wronged Uriah, whose wife he had
dishonored, whom he had caused to be made drunk, and afterwards to be
slain; for he acknowledges in the 14th verse that “blood-guiltiness” lay
heavy upon him, and he prays for deliverance from it. They are an
emphatic declaration of the heinousness of his guilt — that he had
sinned chiefly against God — more against him than against man. “My
offense,” as if he had said, “against Uriah, and against society at
large, great as it has been, is nothing compared to that which I have
committed against thee.”

<span id="fn_260"></span>[261](cc09016.htm#fr_260.md) <span
id="xvii.ii-p9.5"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p10"></span> This is the opinion of R. Abraham and
other Jewish commentators. They say that these words are not to be
joined to the immediately preceding part of this verse, but either to
the prayer in the first verse, or to what is stated in the third verse,
“I acknowledge my transgressions;” and they put the beginning of the
fourth verse, “Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done evil in
thy sight,” within a parenthesis. But there is no just ground for such
an interpretation. Green reads the last clause of the verse, “So that
thou art just in passing sentence *upon me*, and clear in condemning
*me*.” And it is not uncommon for <span id="xvii.ii-p10.1"></span>למען,
*le-maan*, to be used in the sense of *so that*, as in <span
id="xvii.ii-p10.2"></span>[Ps
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa030.htm#012.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p10.2"></span>;
<span id="xvii.ii-p10.3"></span>[Isa
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p10.3"></span>;
and <span id="xvii.ii-p10.4"></span>[Jer
50:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#034.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p10.4"></span>.
According to this reading, the words are a part of David’s confession; —
he not only confesses his sin in the first part of the verse, but also
here acknowledges the divine righteousness should God condemn him. This
is the sense in which Calvin understands the passage.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[262](cc09016.htm#fr_261.md) <span
id="xvii.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p13"></span> There does not appear to be any
substantial difference between the reading of the Septuagint, which the
apostle follows, and that of the Hebrew text. Calvin says that Paul uses
the verb *to judge* in a passive sense, whereas it is here used
actively. But this is a mistake. Street, after giving the words of the
Septuagint, which are, <span id="xvii.ii-p13.1"></span>Νικησης ἐν τω
κρινεσθαι σε, says, “The verb <span id="xvii.ii-p13.2"></span>κρινεσθαι
is in the middle, not in the passive voice, and the phrase <span
id="xvii.ii-p13.3"></span>ἐν τω κρινεσθαι σε, signifies <span
id="xvii.ii-p13.4"></span>*cum tu judicas*,” \[*i* *e* *when thou
judgest*.\] “I take notice of this the rather, because the passage being
cited by Paul, <span id="xvii.ii-p13.5"></span>[Ro
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p13.5"></span>,
(and the Septuagint version of it having been inserted instead of the
Hebrew, which the apostle quoted,) our translators seem to have mistaken
the sense of it; for they render it, ‘That thou mightest be justified in
thy sayings, and mightest overcome *when thou art judged*.’ But who
shall judge the Almighty?” In the other instance which Calvin mentions,
the difference between the apostle’s reading and that of the Hebrew text
is more in appearance than in reality. “The word <span
id="xvii.ii-p13.6"></span>זכה,” says Hammond, “is ordinarily rendered
<span id="xvii.ii-p13.7"></span>*mundus fuit*, *clean*, or *clear*, or
*pure* But this, as the context evinces, must be understood in a
forensic sense, as *pure* is all one with *free from guilt*; and so
there is a second notion of the word for *overcoming*, meaning that sort
of victory which belongs to him that carries the cause <span
id="xvii.ii-p13.8"></span>in judicature.” After stating that this is the
rendering of the Septuagint, he observes, “That is very reconcilable
with the notion of <span id="xvii.ii-p13.9"></span>*mundus fuit*; for he
that doth overcome in the suit is fitly said to be *cleared* or quitted
by the law.” Thus Hammond, with Chrysostom, supposes the meaning to be,
that should God proceed against David, should he indite and arraign him
at the bar of justice for his sins, demanding vengeance to be inflicted
upon him, God would be justified and cleared, and would overcome in the
suit.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[263](cc09016.htm#fr_262.md) <span

<span id="xvii.ii-p18"></span> Our Author’s views on the doctrine of
original sin are more fully stated in his Institutes, Book II. chap. 1.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[264](cc09016.htm#fr_263.md) <span
id="xvii.ii-p20.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p21"></span> The word <span
id="xvii.ii-p21.2"></span>טחות, *tuchoth*, which is rendered *inward
parts*, and which is derived from the verb <span
id="xvii.ii-p21.3"></span>טוח, *tuach*, *to spread over*, means *the
reins*, which are so called, because they are *overspread* with fat.
“Once more it is used in Scripture, <span id="xvii.ii-p21.4"></span>[Job
38:36](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#036.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p21.4"></span>,
where, as here, our English Bible renders it *inward parts*, somewhat
too generally. The Chaldee expresses it more particularly by *reins*,
and these, in the Scripture style, are frequently taken for the seat of
the affections, the purity whereof is most contrary to the natural
corruption or inbred pollution spoken of in the preceding verse. The
word <span id="xvii.ii-p21.5"></span>אמת, *emeth*, *truth*, ordinarily
signifies sincerity, uprightness, and integrity; and so *truth in the
reins* is equivalent to a hearty sincere obedience, not only of the
actions, but of the very thoughts and affections to God; and so, in
things of this nature, wherein this psalm is principally concerned,
denotes the purity of the heart, the not admitting any unclean desire or
thought, the very first degree of indulgence to any lust. And this God
is said *to will*, or *desire*, or *delight in*, and so to command and
require of us.” — *Hammond*

<span id="fn_264"></span>[265](cc09016.htm#fr_264.md) <span
id="xvii.ii-p21.7"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p22"></span> The word is explained in the first of
these senses in the Septuagint: “<span id="xvii.ii-p22.1"></span>Τὰ
ἄδηλα καὶ τα κρύφια τὢς σοφίας εδήλοσίς μοι;” — “Thou hast manifested to
me the secret and hidden things of thy wisdom.” Viewed in this light as
well as in the other, the language expresses the aggravated nature of
David’s sin. He had sinned, although God had revealed to him high and
secret mysteries.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[266](cc09016.htm#fr_265.md) <span
id="xvii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p6"></span> Hyssop was much used by the Hebrews in
their sacred purifications and sprinklings. The allusion here probably
is to the ceremony of sprinkling such as had been infected with leprosy.
Two birds were to be taken, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop; one of the
birds was to be killed, and the priest having dipped the living bird,
the cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop, in the blood of the bird that was
killed, sprinkled the leper, (<span id="xvii.iii-p6.1"></span>[Le
14](../../../bib/kjv/lev014.htm#000)<span id="xvii.iii-p6.1"></span>..md)
This ceremony, it is to be observed, was not to be performed until the
person was cured; and it was intended as a declaration to the people,
that, God having healed him of a disease which no human means could
remove, he might with safety be restored to society, and to the
privileges of which he had been deprived. David, polluted with the
crimes of adultery and murder, regarded himself as a man affected with
the dreadful disease of leprosy, and he prays that God would sprinkle
him with hyssop, as the leper was sprinkled, using this figurative
language to express his ardent desires to obtain forgiveness and
cleansing by the application of the blood of Christ, and that God would
show to the people that he had pardoned his sin, restored him to favor,
and purified his soul.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[267](cc09016.htm#fr_266.md) <span
id="xvii.iii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p7"></span> David felt that he was stained, as it
were, by the blood of Uriah, and therefore he prays, “Wash me.” The word
<span id="xvii.iii-p7.1"></span>כבסנ, *cabbeseni*, *wash me*, is from
<span id="xvii.iii-p7.2"></span>כבס, *cabas*, *to tread*, *to trample
with the feet*; and hence it signifies *to wash*, *to cleanse*, for
example, garments, by treading them in a trough, etc. It differs from
<span id="xvii.iii-p7.3"></span>רחף, *rachats*, *to lave or wash the
body*, as the Greek word <span id="xvii.iii-p7.4"></span>πλύνειν, *to
cleanse soiled garments*, differs from <span
id="xvii.iii-p7.5"></span>λούειν, *to wash the body* See Gesenius
Lexicon. These two words, <span id="xvii.iii-p7.6"></span>כבס, *cabas*,
and <span id="xvii.iii-p7.7"></span>רחף, *rachats*, which thus express
different kinds of washing, observes Bishop Mant, “are always used in
the Hebrew language with the strictest propriety: the one to signify
that kind of washing which *pervades the substance* of the thing washed,
and cleanses it thoroughly; and the other to express that kind of
washing which only *cleanses the surface* of a substance, which the
water cannot penetrate. The former is applied to the washing of clothes;
the latter is used for washing some part of the body. By a beautiful and
strong metaphor, David uses the former word in this and the second
verse: ‘*Wash* me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
sin.’ ‘*Wash* me, and I shall be whiter than snow.’ So in <span
id="xvii.iii-p7.8"></span>[Jer
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#014.md)<span id="xvii.iii-p7.8"></span>,
the same word is applied to the heart. There is a similar distinction in
the Greek language, which the LXX. constantly observe in their rendering
of the Hebrew words above alluded to.”

<span id="fn_267"></span>[268](cc09016.htm#fr_267.md) <span
id="xvii.iv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p3"></span> French and Skinner read, “*a steadfast
spirit*; *i*.*e*., a mind steady in following the path of duty.“

<span id="fn_268"></span>[269](cc09016.htm#fr_268.md) <span
id="xvii.iv-p10.7"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p11"></span> Some commentators refer the clause, upon
which Calvin is here commenting, to the Holy Spirit, and others to the
qualities of mind with which David desired to be endued. The translators
of our English Bible understand the expression in the first sense,
reading, “thy free Spirit.” The word *thy* is a supplement, but it does
not appear to be liable to any material objection. Fry, who adopts the
same view, reads, “bountiful or spontaneously flowing Spirit;” and
observes, that the word <span id="xvii.iv-p11.1"></span>נדיבה,
*nedibah*, “is more still than spontaneously flowing: it signifies to
flow both spontaneously and plentifully: ‘<span
id="xvii.iv-p11.2"></span>prae uberitate succi sponte fluens.’ This
epithet of the indwelling Spirit will be best explained from our Lord’s
own words, <span id="xvii.iv-p11.3"></span>[John
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014.md), [John
7:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#038.md)<span id="xvii.iv-p11.3"></span>.”
Others refer the expression to the mind of the Psalmist. Mudge reads,
“And let a plentiful effusion of spirit support me.” Dimock, “Let a free
spirit sustain me;” “that is,” says he, “let me not be enslaved, as I
have been, by my sinful passions.” Green, “And support with a cheerful
spirit.” French and Skinner, “And may a willing spirit uphold me;” by
which they understand, “a spirit devoted to the service of God.”
Walford, following the Septuagint, reads, “And with a princely spirit
sustain me.” “David,” says this critic, “was so overwhelmed by the
consciousness of his extreme iniquity, so broken in spirit, courage, and
fortitude, as to feel altogether incompetent to the discharge of his
office, as the King of Israel. He therefore addresses this petition to
God, in the hope that he would grant to him a renewal of that powerful
energy by which he had at first been fitted for an employment so every
way unsuitable to his lowly descent, and his employment as a shepherd.”

<span id="fn_269"></span>[270](cc09016.htm#fr_269.md) <span
id="xvii.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p8"></span> This opinion, although disapproved of by
our Author, is very generally held by commentators. When *blood* is used
in the plural number as here, it usually denotes murder or manslaughter,
and the guilt following thereupon: as in <span
id="xvii.v-p8.1"></span>[Ge 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#011.md)<span
id="xvii.v-p8.1"></span>, “The voice of thy brother’s bloods crieth unto
me from the ground;” <span id="xvii.v-p8.2"></span>[1Ch
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#008.md)<span id="xvii.v-p8.2"></span>,
“Thou hast shed bloods abundantly;” and <span
id="xvii.v-p8.3"></span>[Ps 9:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#013.md)<span
id="xvii.v-p8.3"></span>, “When he maketh inquisition for bloods.” See
also <span id="xvii.v-p8.4"></span>[Ps
106:38](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#038.md)<span id="xvii.v-p8.4"></span>.
“A man of bloods” is a bloody man, a man who is guilty of bloodshed,
<span id="xvii.v-p8.5"></span>[Ps.
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#006.md), [Ps.
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#009.md), [Ps.
59:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#002.md), [Ps.
55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023.md)<span id="xvii.v-p8.5"></span>.
David’s conduct towards Uriah, forming as it did a dark and an atrocious
deed of treachery and cruelty which has few parallels in the history of
mankind, must, on his recovery to a sense of its real character, have
inflicted on his soul an agony which cannot be told. He escaped being
tried before an earthly tribunal; but his conscience told him that he
stood at the bar of Heaven, laden with the guilt of murder; and he was
convinced that the mercy of God alone could pardon him and purify his
conscience. No wonder then that he cries out with such emphasis and
earnestness, *O* *God*! *thou God of my salvation*! *deliver me*! The
Chaldee reads, “Deliver me from the judgment of murder.”

<span id="fn_270"></span>[271](cc09016.htm#fr_270.md) <span
id="xvii.vi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p3"></span> The original word <span
id="xvii.vi-p3.1"></span>ואחנה, *ve-etenah*, which Calvin renders,
*Though I should give*, is considered by some as a noun. “The common
interpretation, *Else would I give it thee*,” says Rogers, “is harsh.
Gesenius attributes to the word <span id="xvii.vi-p3.2"></span>אחנה,
with a slight difference in the punctuation, the sense of a *gift*,
*reward* It is used only in <span id="xvii.vi-p3.3"></span>[Ho
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#014.md)<span id="xvii.vi-p3.3"></span>.
If this sense might be given to the word in this passage, the verse
might be translated,

<span id="xvii.vi-p4"></span>‘For thou desirest no sacrifice or gift,  
\[In\] a burnt-offering thou hast no delight.’”

<span id="xvii.vi-p5"></span>*Book of Psalms in Hebrew*, *volume* 2, p.
208.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[272](cc09016.htm#fr_271.md) <span
id="xvii.vi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p9"></span> There may be another reason why David here
affirms that God would not accept of a sacrifice, nor be pleased with a
burnt-offering. No particular sacrifices were appointed by the Law of
Moses to expiate the guilt of murder and adultery. The person who had
perpetrated these crimes was, according to the Divine law, to be
punished with death. David therefore may be understood as declaring,
that it was utterly vain for him to think of resorting to sacrifices and
burnt-offerings with a view to the expiation of his guilt; that his
criminality was of such a character, that the ceremonial law made no
provision for his deliverance from the doom which his deeds of horror
deserved; and that the only sacrifices which would avail were those
mentioned in the succeeding verse, “The sacrifices of a broken heart.”

<span id="fn_272"></span>[273](cc09016.htm#fr_272.md) <span
id="xvii.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p14"></span> We have already considered Horsley’s
first objection, founded on the fourth verse, to the authenticity of the
title of this psalm. His second and only other objection rests on the
18th verse. He thinks that the prayer, “Build thou the walls of
Jerusalem,” is more applicable to the time of the Babylonish captivity
than to the time of David; and to the former period he refers the psalm.
Calmet and Mudge are of the same opinion. Some learned Jewish
interpreters, while they assign the psalm to the occasion mentioned in
the title, conjecture that the 18th and 19th verses were added by some
Jewish bard in the time of the Babylonish captivity. This opinion is
also held by Venema, Green, Street, French and Skinner. There does not,
however, seem to be any sufficient ground for referring the poem, either
in whole or in part, to that period. Neither the walls of Jerusalem, nor
the buildings of Zion, as the royal palace, and the magnificent
structure of the temple, which we know David had already contemplated
for the worship of God, (<span id="xvii.vi-p14.1"></span>[2Sa
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#001.md)<span id="xvii.vi-p14.1"></span>,
etc.) were completed during his reign. This was only effected under the
reign of his son Solomon, (<span id="xvii.vi-p14.2"></span>[1Ki
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#001)<span id="xvii.vi-p14.2"></span>..md)
The prayer, then, in the 18th verse, might have a particular reference
to the completion of these buildings, and especially to the rearing of
the temple, in which sacrifices of unprecedented magnitude were to be
offered. David’s fears might easily suggest to him that his crimes might
prevent the building of the temple which God had promised should be
erected, (<span id="xvii.vi-p14.3"></span>[2Sa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013)<span id="xvii.vi-p14.3"></span>..md)
“The king forgets not,” observes Bishop Horne, “to ask mercy for his
people, as well as for himself; that so neither his own nor their sins
might prevent either the building and flourishing of the earthly
Jerusalem, or, what was of infinitely greater importance, the promised
blessing of Messiah, who was to descend from him, and to rear the walls
of the New Jerusalem.”

<span id="fn_273"></span>[274](cc09016.htm#fr_273.md) <span
id="xvii.vi-p16.4"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p17"></span> Ainsworth reads, “the burnt-offering and
the whole oblation;” and observes, that “*The* *whole oblation*, *the
calil*, was a kind of oblation that was wholly and every whit given up
in fire unto God, and differed from the *ghnola*, or burnt-offering,
which was only of beasts or birds, <span id="xvii.vi-p17.1"></span>[Le
1](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#000.md)<span id="xvii.vi-p17.1"></span>;
whereas the *calil* was also of flour, called the meat-offering, but
burned altogether, which the common meat-offerings were not, <span
id="xvii.vi-p17.2"></span>[Lev. 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#020.md),

[23](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#023.md)<span id="xvii.vi-p17.2"></span>.
It was also of beasts, <span id="xvii.vi-p17.3"></span>[1Sa
