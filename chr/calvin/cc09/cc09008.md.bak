<span id="ix-p1"></span>PSALM 43

<span id="ix-p2"></span>This psalm is very similar to the preceding.
 <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) David, who probably was the
author of it, being chased and driven out of his country by the unjust
violence and tyranny of his enemies, calls upon God for vengeance, and
encourages himself to hope for restoration.

<span id="ix.i-p1"></span><span id="ix.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
43:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p2"></span>**1**. Judge me, O God! and plead my cause:
deliver me from the cruel \[or unmerciful\] nation, free me from the
deceitful and wicked man. **2**. For thou art the God of my strength;
why art thou estranged from me? why go I sad because of the oppression
of the enemy? **3**. Send forth thy light and thy truth, let them direct
me, let them conduct me to thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles. **4**.
And I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy, \[literally
the joy of my rejoicing:\] and I will praise thee upon the harp, O God!
my God. **5**. O my soul! why art thou cast down? and why art thou
disquieted within me? for I will yet praise him who is the help of my
countenance, and my God.

<span id="ix.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.i-p4"></span><span id="ix.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p5"></span>**1** *Judge me, O God!* David, in the first
place, complains of the extreme cruelty of his enemies; but in the
verses which immediately follow, he shows that there was nothing which
he felt to be more grievous, than to be deprived of the opportunity of
access to the sanctuary. We have an evidence of his enjoying the
testimony of a good conscience in this, that he commends the defense of
his cause to God. The term *judge,* which he first makes use of, is
nothing else than *to undertake the defense of one’s cause;* and he
expresses his meaning more clearly by adding, *plead my cause* The
substance and object of his prayer, indeed, were, that he might be
delivered from the wicked and malicious men by whom he was undeservedly
persecuted. But as it is to the miserable and guiltless, who are
wrongfully afflicted, that God promises his help, David, in the first
place, submits himself to be examined by him, that, having discovered
and thoroughly proved the rectitude of his cause, he may at length grant
him aid. And as it is a most cheering source of consolation for us to
find that God disdains not to take cognisance of our cause, so also, it
is vain for us to expect that he will avenge the injuries and wrongs
which are done to us, unless our own integrity be so manifest as to
induce him to be favorable to us against our adversaries. By *the
unmerciful nation* is to be understood the whole company of David’s
enemies, who were cruel, and destitute of all the feelings of humanity.
What follows, concerning *the deceitful and wicked man,* might indeed be
applied to Saul; but it seems rather to be a form of speech in which, by
enallage, the singular number is used for the plural.

<span id="ix.i-p6"></span><span id="ix.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p7"></span>**2** *For thou art the God of my strength*
This verse differs very little from the ninth verse of the preceding
psalm, and the difference consists more in words than in matter. Setting
as a shield against temptation the fact, that he had experienced the
power of God to be present with him, he complains that his life is spent
in mourning, because he sees himself as it were abandoned to the will of
his enemies. He considered it absolutely certain that his enemies had no
power to do him harm except in so far as the Lord permitted them; and
therefore he asks, as if it were something altogether unaccountable, how
it happened that his enemies prevailed against him whilst he was under
the assured protection and guardianship of God. From this he gathers
courage to pray, that God would be pleased again to manifest his favor,
which he seemed to have hid from him for a time. The term *light* is to
be understood as denoting *favor;* for as adversities not only obscure
the face of God, but also overcast the heavens, as it were, with clouds
and fogs, so also, when we enjoy the divine blessing which makes rich,
it is like the cheerful light of a serene day shining around us; or
rather the light of life, dispelling all that thick obscurity which
overwhelmed us in sorrow. By this word the Psalmist intimates two
things; first, that all our miseries arise from no other source than
this, that God withdraws from us the tokens of his paternal love; and,
secondly, that as soon as he is pleased to manifest towards us his
serene and gracious countenance, deliverance and salvation also arise to
us. He adds *truth,* because he expected this light only from the
promises of God. The unbelieving desire the favor of God, but they do
not raise their eyes to his light; for the natural disposition of man
always tends towards the earth, unless his mind and all his feelings are
raised up on high by the word of God. In order, then, to encourage
himself in the hope of obtaining the grace of God, David rests with
confidence in this, that God, who is true, and cannot deceive any, has
promised to assist his servants. We must therefore explain the sentence
thus: Send forth thy light, that it may be a token and testimony of thy
truth, or that it may really and effectually prove that thou art
faithful and free from all deceit in thy promises. The knowledge of the
divine favor, it is true, must be sought for in the Word of God; nor has
faith any other foundation on which it can rest with security except his
word; but when God stretches out his hand to help us, the experience of
this is no small confirmation both of the word and of faith. David
declares what was the chief object of his desire, and what end he had in
view in seeking deliverance from his calamities, when he says, *Let them
direct me, and lead me to thy holy hill.* As the chief cause of his
sorrow consisted in his being banished from the congregation of the
godly, so he places the height of all his enjoyments in this, that he
might be at liberty to take part in the exercises of religion, and to
worship God in the sanctuary. Tacitly, indeed, David makes a vow of
thanksgiving to God; but there can be no doubt, that by these words he
intimates, that the end which he had in view in seeking deliverance from
his afflictions was, that as formerly he might be at liberty to return
to the sanctuary, from which he was driven by the tyranny of his
enemies. And it deserves to be particularly noticed, that although he
had been deprived of his wife, spoiled of his goods, his house, and all
his other earthly comforts, yet he always felt such an ardent desire to
come to the temple, that he forgot almost every thing else. But it is
enough for me at present briefly to notice this, as in the preceding
psalm I have treated at greater length of this holy desire of David,
which ought to be imitated by all the faithful.  <span
id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) Still, however, it might be asked, How
it is that mention is here made of *Mount Sion,* which was not appointed
to the service of God till after the death of Saul? The only solution of
this difficulty which I can give is, that David, composing this psalm at
an after period of his life, employs, in accordance with the revelation
which had subsequently been given to him, language which otherwise he
would have used more generally in speaking only of the tabernacle, and
without at all specifying the place.  <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) In this I see no inconsistency.

<span id="ix.i-p10"></span><span id="ix.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p11"></span>**4.** *And I will go to the altar of God.*
Here he promises to God a solemn sacrifice, in commemoration of the
deliverance which he should obtain from him; for he speaks not only of
the daily or ordinary service, but in making mention of the altar on
which it was customary to offer the peace-offerings, he expresses the
token of gratitude and thanksgiving of which I have spoken. For this
reason, also, he calls God *the God of his joy,* because, being
delivered from sorrow, and restored to a state of joy, he resolves to
acknowledge openly so great a benefit. And he calls him the *joy* *of
his rejoicing,* that he may the more illustriously set forth the grace
of his deliverance. The second word in the genitive is added by way of
an epithet, and by it he signifies that his heart had been filled with
joy of no common kind, when God restored him, contrary to the
expectation of all. As to the fifth verse, I have already treated of it
sufficiently in the preceding psalm, and therefore deem it superfluous
to speak of it here.

id="ix-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ix-p3"></span> This and the preceding psalm have been
considered by the greater number of critics as having originally formed
only one psalm, and they make but one in forty-six MSS. The similarity
of the style, sentiment, and metrical structure, and the occurrence of
the intercalary verse at verses 5th and 10th of <span
id="ix-p3.1"></span>[Psalm 42](../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#000.md)<span
id="ix-p3.1"></span>, and verse 5th of <span id="ix-p3.2"></span>[Psalm
43](../../../bib/kjv/psa043.htm#000.md)<span id="ix-p3.2"></span>, confirm
this opinion. “The fact, indeed,” says Williams, “is self evident, and
easily accounted for. The Jewish choristers having, on some occasion,
found the anthem too long, have divided it for their own conveniency,
(no uncommon thing among choristers,) and, being once divided, it was
ignorantly supposed it ought to be so divided.”
