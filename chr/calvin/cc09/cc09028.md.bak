<span id="xxix-p1"></span>PSALM 63

<span id="xxix-p2"></span>The following psalm cannot so properly be said
to consist of prayers as of a variety of pious meditations, which
comforted the mind of David under dangers, anxieties, and troubles of a
severe description. It contains the vows too which he made to God in the
distress occasioned by the alarming circumstances in which he was
placed.

<span id="xxix-p3"></span>A Psalm of David, when he was in the
wilderness of Judah.  <span id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md)

<span id="xxix.i"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p1"></span><span id="xxix.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
63:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001.md)<span id="xxix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p2"></span>**1**. O God! thou art my God; early will I
seek thee: my soul has thirsted for thee, my flesh has longed for thee
in  <span id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) a desert and thirsty  <span
id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) land, where no water is. **2**. Thus
have I beheld thee in the sanctuary, to see thy power and thy glory.
**3**. Because thy mercy is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
**4**. Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in
thy name.

<span id="xxix.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxix.i-p6"></span><span id="xxix.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p7"></span>**1.** *O God! thou art my God.* The
wilderness of Judah, spoken of in the title, can be no other than that
of Ziph, where David wandered so long in a state of concealment. We may
rely upon the truth of the record he gives us of his exercise when under
his trials; and it is apparent that he never allowed himself to be so
far overcome by them, as to cease lifting up his prayers to heaven, and
even resting, with a firm and constant faith, upon the divine promises.
Apt as we are, when assaulted by the very slightest trials, to lose the
comfort of any knowledge of God we may previously have possessed, it is
necessary that we should notice this, and learn, by his example, to
struggle to maintain our confidence under the worst troubles that can
befall us. He does more than simply pray; he sets the Lord before him as
his God, that he may throw all his cares unhesitatingly upon him,
deserted as he was of man, and a poor outcast in the waste and howling
wilderness. His faith, shown in this persuasion of the favor and help of
God, had the effect of exciting him to constant and vehement prayer for
the grace which he expected. In saying that *his soul thirsted, and his
flesh longed,* he alludes to the destitution and poverty which he lay
under in the wilderness, and intimates, that though deprived of the
ordinary means of subsistence, he looked to God as his meat and his
drink, directing all his desires to him. When he represents his soul as
thirsting, and his flesh as hungering, we are not to seek for any nice
or subtile design in the distinction. He means simply that he desired
God, both with soul and body. For although the body, strictly speaking,
is not of itself influenced by desire, we know that the feelings of the
soul intimately and extensively affect it.

<span id="xxix.i-p8"></span><span id="xxix.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p9"></span>**2.** *Thus in the sanctuary,* *etc.* It is
apparent, as already hinted, that God was ever in his thoughts, though
wandering in the wilderness under such circumstances of destitution. The
particle *thus* is emphatic. Even when so situated, in a wild and
hideous solitude, where the very horrors of the place were enough to
have distracted his meditations, he exercised himself in beholding the
power and glory of God, just as if he had been in the sanctuary.
Formerly, when it was in his power to wait upon the tabernacle, he was
far from neglecting that part of the instituted worship of God. He was
well aware that he needed such helps to devotion. But now, when shut
out, in the providence of God, from any such privilege, he shows, by the
delight which he took in spiritual views of God, that his was not a mind
engrossed with the symbols, or mere outward ceremonial of religion. He
gives evidence how much he had profited by the devotional exercises
enjoined under that dispensation. It is noticeable of ignorant and
superstitious persons, that they seem full of zeal and fervor so long as
they come in contact with the ceremonies of religion, while their
seriousness evaporates immediately upon these being withdrawn. David, on
the contrary, when these were removed, continued to retain them in his
recollection, and rise, through their assistance, to fervent aspirations
after God. We may learn by this, when deprived at any time of the
outward means of grace, to direct the eye of our faith to God in the
worst circumstances, and not to forget him whenever the symbols of holy
things are taken out of our sight. The great truth, for example, of our
spiritual regeneration, though but once represented to us in baptism,
should remain fixed in our minds through our whole life,  <span
id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) (<span id="xxix.i-p10.2"></span>Titus
3:5; <span id="xxix.i-p10.3"></span>[Eph
5:26](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#026)<span id="xxix.i-p10.3"></span>..md)
The mystical union subsisting between Christ and his members should be
matter of reflection, not only when we sit at the Lord’s table, but at
all other times. Or suppose that the Lord’s Supper, and other means of
advancing our spiritual welfare, were taken from us by an exercise of
tyrannical power, it does not follow that our minds should ever cease to
be occupied with the contemplation of God. The expression, *So have I
beheld thee to see,* etc., indicates the earnestness with which he was
intent upon the object, directing his whole meditation to this, that he
might see the power and glory of God, of which there was a reflection in
the sanctuary.

<span id="xxix.i-p11"></span><span id="xxix.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p12"></span>**3** *Because thy mercy is better than
life, etc.* I have no objections to read the verse in this connected
form, though I think that the first clause would be better separated,
and taken in with the verse preceding. David would appear to be giving
the reason of his earnestness in desiring God. By *life* is to be
understood, in general, everything which men use for their own
maintenance and defense. When we think ourselves well provided
otherwise, we feel no disposition to have recourse to the mercy of God.
That *being* (to speak so) which we have of our own, prevents us from
seeing that we live through the mere grace of God.  <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) As we are too much disposed to trust
in aids of a carnal kind, and to forget God, the Psalmist here affirms
that we should have more reliance upon the divine mercy in the midst of
death, than upon what we are disposed to call, or what may appear to be,
life. Another interpretation has been given of the words of this verse,
but a very meagre and feeble one, — That the mercy of God is better than
life itself; or, in other words, that the divine favor is preferable to
every other possession. But the opposition is evidently between that
state of secure prosperity, in which men are so apt to rest with
complacency, and the mercy of God, which is the stay of such as are
ready to sink and perish, and which is the one effectual remedy for
supplying (if one might use that expression) all defects.

<span id="xxix.i-p14"></span>The word which I have rendered *life,*
being in the plural number in the Hebrew, has led Augustine to assign a
meaning to the sentence which is philosophical and ingenious, but
without foundation, as the plural of the word is quite commonly used in
the singular signification. He considered that the term *lives* was here
used in reference to the truth, That different men affect different
modes of life, some seeking riches, and others pleasure; some desiring
the luxuries, and some the honors of this world, while others are given
to their sensual appetites. He conceived that there was an opposition
stated in the verse between these various kinds of life and eternal
life, here by a common figure of speech called *mercy,* because it is of
grace, and not of merit. But it is much more natural to understand the
Psalmist as meaning, that it was of no consequence how large a share men
possess of prosperity, and of the means which are generally thought to
make life secure, the divine mercy being a better foundation of trust
than any life fashioned out to ourselves, and than all other supports
taken together.  <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) On this account
the Lord’s people, however severely they may suffer from poverty, or the
violence of human wrongs, or the languor of desire, or hunger and
thirst, or the many troubles and anxieties of life, may be happy
notwithstanding; for it is well with them, in the best sense of the
term, when God is their friend. Unbelievers, on the other hand, must be
miserable, even when all the world smiles upon them; for God is their
enemy, and a curse necessarily attaches to their lot.

<span id="xxix.i-p16"></span><span id="xxix.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p17"></span>In the words which follow, David expresses
his consequent resolution to praise God. When we experience his
goodness, we are led to open our lips in thanksgiving. His intention is
intimated still more clearly in the succeeding verse, where he says that
*he will bless God in his life* There is some difficulty, however, in
ascertaining the exact sense of the words. When it is said, So *will I
bless thee,* etc., the *so* may refer to the good reason which he had,
as just stated, to praise God, from having felt how much better it is to
live by life communicated from God, than to live of and from ourselves.
 <span id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) Or the sense may be, *so,* that
is, *even in this calamitous and afflicted condition:* for he had
already intimated that, amidst the solitude of the wilderness, where he
wandered, he would still direct his eye to God. The word *life,* again,
may refer to his life as having been preserved by divine interposition;
or the sense of the passage may be, that he would bless God *through the
course of his life.* The former meaning conveys the fullest matter of
instruction, and agrees with the context; he would bless God, because,
by his goodness, he had been kept alive and in safety. The sentiment is
similar to that which we find elsewhere,

<span id="xxix.i-p19"></span>“I shall not die, but live, and declare the
works of the Lord;” — (<span id="xxix.i-p19.1"></span>[Ps
118:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#017)<span id="xxix.i-p19.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xxix.i-p20"></span>and again; —

<span id="xxix.i-p21"></span>“The dead shall not praise the Lord,
neither any that go down into silence, but we who live will bless the
Lord,”  
(<span id="xxix.i-p21.2"></span>[Ps.
115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#018)<span id="xxix.i-p21.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xxix.i-p22"></span>In the *lifting up of hands,*  <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) in the second clause of the verse,
allusion is made to praying and vowing; and he intimates, that besides
giving thanks to God, he would acquire additional confidence in
supplication, and be diligent in the exercise of it. Any experience we
may have of the divine goodness, while it stirs us up to gratitude,
should, at the same time, strengthen our hopes of the future, and lead
us confidently to expect that God will perfect the grace which he has
begun. Some understand by the *lifting up of his hands,* that he refers
to praising the Lord. Others, that he speaks of encouraging himself from
the divine assistance, and boldly encountering his enemies. But I prefer
the interpretation which has been already given.

<span id="xxix.ii"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
63:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005.md)<span id="xxix.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p2"></span>**5**. My soul shall be satisfied as with
marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.
**6**. I shall surely  <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) remember
thee upon my couch: I will meditate upon thee in the night watches,
 <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) **7**. Because thou hast been
my help: and I will rejoice in the shadow of thy wings. **8**. My soul
has cleaved hard after thee: thy right hand will uphold me.

<span id="xxix.ii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxix.ii-p6"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p7"></span>**5.** *My soul shall be satisfied as with
marrow, etc.* In accordance with what was said in the foregoing verse,
David expresses his assured persuasion of obtaining a rich and abundant
measure of every blessing that could call for thanksgiving and praise.
At the period of composing this psalm, he may have been already in the
enjoyment of ease and plenty; but there is reason to believe that he
cherished the persuasion referred to, even when wandering in the
wilderness in a state of poverty and destitution. If we would evidence a
strong faith, we must anticipate the divine favor before it has been
actually manifested, and when there is no present appearance of its
forthcoming. From the instance here set before us, we must learn to be
on our guard against despondency, in circumstances when we may see the
wicked wallowing and rioting in the abundance of the things of this
world, while we ourselves are left to pine under the want of them.
David, in the present pressure to which he was exposed, might have given
way to despair, but he knew that God was able to fill the hungry soul,
and that he could want for nothing so long as he possessed an interest
in his favor. It is God’s will to try our patience in this life, by
afflictions of various kinds. Let us bear the wrongs which may be done
us with meekness, till the time come when all our desires shall be
abundantly satisfied. It may be proper to observe, that David, when he
speaks in figurative language of *being filled with marrow and fatness,*
does not contemplate that intemperate and excessive indulgence to which
ungodly men surrender themselves, and by which they brutify their minds.
He looks forward to that moderate measure of enjoyment which would only
quicken him to more alacrity in the praises of God.

<span id="xxix.ii-p8"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p9"></span>**6** *I shall surely remember thee, etc.*
It may be read also, when, or, as often as *I remember thee, I will pray
in the night watches.* But as the Hebrew particle here used is
occasionally taken for an adverb of affirmation, as well as of time, I
have adhered to the commonly received translation, In this case, his
*remembering* God is to be understood as the same thing with his
meditating upon him; and the one clause contains just a repetition of
the sentiment expressed in the other. If the particle be taken in the
different sense formerly mentioned, the words intimate, that as often as
the name of God recurred to his mind, he would dwell upon it with
pleasure, and speak of his goodness. He particularly mentions *the night
watches,* as, when retired from the sight of our fellow-creatures, we
not only revert to what may have given us anxiety, but feel our thoughts
drawn out more freely to different subjects. We have next the reason
assigned for the engagement or declaration he has just made, which is,
that he owed to God his preservation. The experience of the divine
goodness should dispose us to prayer as well as praise. “I will come
into thy house,” says the Psalmist in another place, “in the multitude
of thy mercy,” (<span id="xxix.ii-p9.1"></span>[Ps
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#007)<span id="xxix.ii-p9.1"></span>..md)
The second part of the seventh verse is expressive of the lively hope
with which he was animated. He was resolved to rejoice and triumph under
the shadow of God’s wings, as feeling the same peace and satisfaction in
reliance upon his protection as he could have done had no danger
existed.

<span id="xxix.ii-p10"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p11"></span>**8** *My soul has cleaved hard after
thee* The Hebrew verb means also *to apprehend,* or *follow,* especially
when in construction with the preposition which is here joined to it,
and therefore we might very properly render the words, — *My soul shall
press or follow after thee.*  <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md)
But even should the other translation be retained, the sense is, that
David’s heart was devoted to God with steadfast perseverance. The
phrase, *after thee,* is emphatical, and denotes that he would follow
with unwearied constancy, long as the way might be, and full of
hardships, and beset with obstacles, and however sovereignly God might
himself seem to withdraw his presence. The latter clause of the verse
may be taken as referring simply to the deliverance which he had
previously mentioned as having been received. He had good reason to
persevere, without fainting, in following after God, when he considered
that he had been preserved in safety, up to this time, by the divine
hand. But I would understand the words as having a more extensive
application, and consider that David here speaks of the grace of
perseverance, which would be bestowed upon him by the Spirit. To say
that he would cleave to God, with an unwavering purpose, at all hazards,
might have sounded like the language of vain boasting, had he not
qualified the assertion by adding, that he would do this in so far as he
was sustained by the hand of God.

<span id="xxix.iii"></span>

<span id="xxix.iii-p1"></span><span id="xxix.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
63:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#009.md)<span
id="xxix.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.iii-p2"></span>**9**. And they, whilst they seek my soul
to destroy it, shall go into the lowest parts of the earth. **10**. They
shall cast him out  <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) to the edge
of the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes. **11**. But the king
 <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) , shall rejoice in God; and
every one who swears by him shall glory: for the mouth of them that
speak lies shall be stopped.

<span id="xxix.iii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxix.iii-p6"></span><span id="xxix.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.iii-p7"></span>**9.** *And they, whilst they seek, etc.*
Here we find David rising to a more assured confidence, and triumphing
as if he had already obtained the victory. And there is every reason to
believe, that though he had escaped his difficulties, and was in
circumstances of peace and prosperity when he wrote this psalm, yet he
only expresses what he actually felt at the critical period when his
life was in such imminent danger. He declares his conviction that the
enemies who eagerly sought his life would be cut off; that God would
cast them headlong into destruction; and that their very bodies should
be left without burial. To be *the portion of foxes,*  <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) is the same thing with being left to
be torn and devoured by the *beasts of the field.* It is often denounced
as one judgment which should befall the wicked, that they would perish
by the sword, and become the prey of wolves and of dogs, without
privilege of sepulture. This is a fate which the best of men have met
with in the world, — for good as well as bad are exposed to the stroke
of temporal evil; — but there is this distinction, that God watches over
the scattered dust of his own children, gathers it again, and will
suffer nothing of them to perish, whereas, when the wicked are slain,
and their bones spread on the field, this is only preparatory to their
everlasting destruction.

<span id="xxix.iii-p9"></span><span id="xxix.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.iii-p10"></span>**11.** *But the king will rejoice in
God.* The deliverance which David received had not been extended to him
as a private person, but the welfare of the whole Church was concerned
in it, as that of the body in the safety of the head, and there is
therefore a propriety in his representing all the people of God as
rejoicing with him. Nor can we fail to admire his holy magnanimity in
not scrupling to call himself king, overwhelming as the dangers were by
which he was surrounded, because he laid claim to that honor by faith,
though yet denied him in actual possession. In saying that *he would
rejoice in God,* he refers to the gratitude which he would feel; at the
same time, in extolling the divine goodness shown to him, he views it as
it affected the common body of the faithful.  <span
id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) As was already remarked, the safety of
God’s chosen people, at that time, was inseparably connected with the
reign of David and its prosperity — a figure by which it was the divine
intention to teach us, that our happiness and glory depend entirely upon
Christ. By those who *swear in the name of the Lord,* he means in
general all his genuine servants. The act of solemnly calling upon God
to witness and judge what we say, is one part of divine worship: hence
an oath, by the figure of speech called synecdoche, is made to signify
the profession of religion in general. We are not to imagine from this
that God reckons all those to be his servants who make mention of his
name. Many take it into their lips only to profane it by the grossest
perjury; others outrage or slight it by entering into trifling and
unnecessary oaths; and hypocrites are chargeable with wickedly abusing
it. But those whom David refers to are such as swear by the Lord,
considerately and with reverence, and whose hearts respond to what they
declare. This appears more clearly from the contrast which follows in
the verse, where he opposes those who swear by the name of God to those
*who speak lies,* understanding by that term, not only treacherous and
deceitful men, but men who profane the name of God by falsehoods of a
sacrilegious kind.

<span id="xxix-p4"></span> David was often compelled to flee into the
remote deserts which lay in the tribe of Judah, to escape the fury of
Saul. In tracing his steps, when eagerly sought after by this relentless
persecutor, we find him in the forest of Hareth, and in the wildernesses
of Ziph, Maon, and Engedi, all in the tribe of Judah. See <span
id="xxix-p4.1"></span>[1 Sam. 22:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#005.md), [1

[62](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#062.md)<span id="xxix-p4.1"></span>. The
only objection which can be made to referring the occasion of the
composition of this psalm to David’s persecution by Saul is, that in the
11th verse, David is called king; whereas Saul still swayed the scepter
over Israel. But, as Calvin observes on that verse, David may have
called himself by this title to express his confident persuasion that
God would raise him to the throne in fulfillment of his promise; and his
followers might call him king even during Saul’s lifetime, though he was
not acknowledged to be sovereign by any tribe till after Saul fell at
Gilboa. It is, however, supposed by some that the psalm was written
during the rebellion of his son Absalom, when he was under the necessity
of quitting Jerusalem, and escaping into the wilderness, <span

<span id="xxix.i-p23"></span> “The practice of lifting up the hands in
prayer towards heaven, the supposed residence of the object to which
prayer is addressed, was anciently used, both by believers, as appears
from various passages in the Old Testament, and by the heathen,
agreeably to numerous instances in the classical writers. Parkhurst,
considering the ‘hand’ to be the chief organ or instrument of man’s
power and operations, and properly supposing the word to be thence used
very extensively by the Hebrews for power, agency, dominion, assistance,
and the like, regards the lifting up of men’s hands in prayer as an
emblematical acknowledging of the *power*, and imploring of the
*assistance* of their respective gods. Is it not, however, rather the
natural and unstudied gesture of earnest supplication?” — *Mant*.

<span id="xxix.ii-p4"></span> Among the Hebrews the night was divided
into portions of three or four hours each, which were denominated vigils
or watches.

<span id="xxix.ii-p12"></span> Dr Adam Clarke renders, “My soul cleaves,
or is glued after thee.” “This phrase,” says he, “not only shows the
*diligence* of the pursuit, and the *nearness* of the attainment, but
also the *fast hold* he had got of the mercy of his God.”

<span id="xxix.iii-p3"></span> “<span id="xxix.iii-p3.1"></span>יגירהו,”
here rendered, *they shall cast him out*, “from <span
id="xxix.iii-p3.2"></span>נגר, signifies in *Hiphil*, *they shall cause
to be poured out*, or *shall pour out* The word is ordinarily applied to
water, <span id="xxix.iii-p3.3"></span>[2Sa

But here, by the immediate mention of the sword, it is restrained to the
effusion of blood; and being in the third person plural, in the active
sense, it is, after the Hebrew idiom, to be interpreted in the passive
sense, ‘They shall pour out by the hand of the sword;’ *i* *e*. ‘They
shall be poured out by the sword,’ the *hand* of *the sword* being no
more than the edge of the sword.” — *Hammond* Dr Adam Clarke gives the
same version: “*They* *shall be poured out by the hand of the sword*
Heb. That is, their life’s blood shall be shed either in war, or by the
hand of justice.” But <span id="xxix.iii-p3.5"></span>נגר, *nagar*, also
signifies metaphorically *to give over into one*’*s hands*, *to give
up*, as in the phrase, <span id="xxix.iii-p3.6"></span>הגיר על ירי חרב,
“to deliver any one up to the sword.” See <span
id="xxix.iii-p3.7"></span>[Eze

And the Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate, Aethiopic, and Arabic versions,
Gesenius and Hare here read, “They shall be delivered to the sword.”
Horsley translates, “They would shed it;” and observes, that *it*
signifies “*my* *life*; for <span id="xxix.iii-p3.9"></span>נפש, which
is of the doubtful gender, is the antecedent of the masculine suffix
<span id="xxix.iii-p3.10"></span>הו.”

<span id="xxix.iii-p8"></span> Under the Hebrew word <span
id="xxix.iii-p8.1"></span>שועל, *shual*, here rendered *fox*, was
comprehended, in common language, *the jackal*, or <span
id="xxix.iii-p8.2"></span>*Vulpes aureus*, *golden wolf*, so called in
Latin because its color is a bright yellow; and in this sense <span
id="xxix.iii-p8.3"></span>שועל, *shual*, has been generally interpreted
here, because the jackal is found in Palestine, and feeds on carrion.
Both of these circumstances are, however, also applicable to the fox,
and, moreover, Bochart has made it probable that the specific name of
the jackal (the <span id="xxix.iii-p8.4"></span>θῶς of the Greeks) in
Hebrew was <span id="xxix.iii-p8.5"></span>אי, *aye*, *the howler*,
being so called from the howling cry which he makes particularly at
night. The term occurs in <span id="xxix.iii-p8.6"></span>[Isa.
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022.md), [Isa.
34:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#014.md)<span id="xxix.iii-p8.6"></span>;
and <span id="xxix.iii-p8.7"></span>[Jer
50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039.md)<span id="xxix.iii-p8.7"></span>;
where <span id="xxix.iii-p8.8"></span>איים, *ayim*, is rendered, in our
version, “the wild beasts of the islands,” an appellation very vague and
indeterminate. At the same time, it is highly probable that *shual*
generally refers to the jackal. Several of the modern oriental names of
this animal, as the Turkish *chical*, and the Persian *sciagal*,
*sciachal*, or *schachal* — whence the English jackal — from their
resemblance to the Hebrew word *shual*, favor this supposition; and Dr
Shaw, and other travelers, inform us, that while jackals are very
numerous in Palestine, the common fox is rarely to be met with. We
shall, therefore, be more correct, under these circumstances, in
admitting that the jackal of the East is the Hebrew *shual* These
animals never go alone, but always associate in packs of from fifty to
two hundred. They are known to prey on dead bodies; and so greedy are
they of human carcases, that they dig them out of their graves, and
devour them, however putrescent They have been seen waiting near the
grave at the time of a funeral eagerly watching their opportunity of
digging up the body almost as soon as it was buried. “I have known
several instances,” says a traveler quoted by Merrick, “of their
attacking and devouring drunken men, whom they have found lying on the
road, and have heard that they will do the same to men that are sick and
helpless. I have seen many graves that have been opened by the jackals,
and parts of the bodies pulled out by them.” They visit the field of
battle to prey upon the dying and the dead, and they follow caravans for
the same purpose. It is usual with the barbarous nations of the East to
leave the bodies of their enemies, killed in battle, in the field, to be
devoured by jackals and other animals. When the Psalmist, therefore,
says that his enemies would become *a portion for foxes*, the meaning
is, that they would be denied the rites of sepulture, which was deemed a
great calamity, — that they should be left unburied, for jackals and
other wild beasts to prey upon and devour.
