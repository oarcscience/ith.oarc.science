31:1-11](../../../bib/kjv/exo031.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.i-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p3"></span>**1.** And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="vi.i-p4"></span>**1.** Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

<span id="vi.i-p5"></span>**2.** See, I have called by name Bezaleel the
son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:

<span id="vi.i-p6"></span>**2.** Vide, vocavi ex nomine Besaleel filium
Uri, filii Hur, e tribu Jehuda:

<span id="vi.i-p7"></span>**3.** And I have filled him with the spirit
of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all
manner of workmanship,

<span id="vi.i-p8"></span>**3.** Et replevi eum Spiritu Dei, sapientia
et intelligentia, scientia et onmi arte,

<span id="vi.i-p9"></span>**4.** To devise cunning works, to work in
gold, and in silver, and in brass,

<span id="vi.i-p10"></span>**4.** Ad excogitandum quicquid fabrefieri
potest ex auro, et argento, et aere:

<span id="vi.i-p11"></span>**5.** And in cutting of stones, to set
*them*, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

<span id="vi.i-p12"></span>**5.** Et in arte gemmaria, ad replendum, et
in arte lignaria, ut operetur in omni opere.

<span id="vi.i-p13"></span>**6.** And I, behold, I have given with him
Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of
all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that
I have commanded thee;

<span id="vi.i-p14"></span>**6.** Et ego ecce constitui cum eo Aholiab
filium Ahisamach e tribu Dan, et in corde omnis sapientis corde, dedi
sapientiam, ut faciant quaecunque praecepi tibi:

<span id="vi.i-p15"></span>**7.** The tabernacle of the congregation,
and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that *is* thereupon,
and all the furniture of the tabernacle,

<span id="vi.i-p16"></span>**7.** Tabernaculum Ecclesiae, et arcam
testimonii, et propitiatorium quod est super eam, et omnia vasa
tabernaculi,

<span id="vi.i-p17"></span>**8.** And the table and his furniture, and
the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,

<span id="vi.i-p18"></span>**8.** Et mensam et vasa ejus: et candelabrum
mundum, et omnia vasa ejus, et altare suffimenti,

<span id="vi.i-p19"></span>**9.** And the altar of burnt-offering with
all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,

<span id="vi.i-p20"></span>**9.** Et altare holocausti, et omnia vasa
ejus, et concham et basin ejus,

<span id="vi.i-p21"></span>**10.** And the clothes of service, and the
holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to
minister in the priest’s office,

<span id="vi.i-p22"></span>**10.** Et vestes ministerii, et vestes
sanctitatis ipsi Aharon sacerdoti, et vestes filiorum ejus, ut
sacerdotio fungantur.

<span id="vi.i-p23"></span>**11.** And the anointing oil, and sweet
incense for the holy *place*: according to all that I have commanded
thee shall they do.

<span id="vi.i-p24"></span>**11.** Et oleum unctionis, et suffimentum
aromaticum pro sanctuario juxta onmia quae praecepi tibi facient.

<span id="vi.i-p25"></span> 

<span id="vi.i-p26"></span><span id="vi.i-p26.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p27"></span>**2.** *See, I have called by name Bezaleel*.
In the remainder of this work we shall follow the course of the history
to the end of Deuteronomy, where the death of Moses himself is recorded.

<span id="vi.i-p28"></span>Although God had omitted nothing which
related to the form of the tabernacle, but had accurately prescribed
every thing that was to be done, still the actual difficulty of the work
might have overwhelmed both Moses and the whole people with despair; for
this was no ordinary work, or one on which the most skillful artificers
might exercise their ingenuity, but a marvelous structure, the pattern
of which had been shewn on the Mount, so that it might seem incredible
that any mortals should be able by their art to compass what God had
commanded. Besides, they had been entirely engaged in servile tasks in
Egypt, such as would extinguish all intellectual vigor, and prevent them
from aspiring to any liberal arts. Hence we gather that all, who
obediently follow God’s voice, are never destitute of His aid. In all
our difficulties, then, let this prayer encourage us to proceed:  <span
id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) “Give what Thou commandest: and
command what Thou wilt.”

<span id="vi.i-p30"></span>To “call by name,” is equivalent to rendering
eminent, so that Moses signifies that Bezaleel should be something
extraordinary, as being endowed with a peculiar gift. Thus Cyrus is said
in <span id="vi.i-p30.2"></span>[Isa
45:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#004.md)<span id="vi.i-p30.2"></span>, to
be called by his name, because in the purpose of God he had been
destined in a remarkable manner to execute such great things. Still,
although the call of Bezaleel was special, because, as I have just said,
God entrusted to him an unusual and by no means ordinary work, we gather
that no one excels even in the most despised and humble handicraft,
except in so far as God’s Spirit works in him. For, although “there are
diversities of gifts,” still it is the same Spirit from whom they all
flow, (<span id="vi.i-p30.3"></span>[1Co
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#004)<span id="vi.i-p30.3"></span>;.md)
and also as God has seen fit to distribute and measure them out to every
man. Nor is this only the case with respect to the spiritual gifts which
follow regeneration, but in all the branches of knowledge which come
into use in common life. It is, therefore, a false division, when
ungodly men ascribe all the means of our support partly to nature and
God’s blessing, and partly to the industry of man, since man’s industry
itself is a blessing from God. The poets are more correct who
acknowledge that all which is suggested by nature comes from God; that
all the arts emanate from Him, and therefore ought to be accounted
divine inventions. The utility of this doctrine is two-fold; first, that
all things which have reference to the support and defense of life,
whenever we meet with them, should excite our gratitude, and that
whatever seems to be derived from man’s ingenuity, should be regarded as
proofs of God’s paternal solicitude for us; and, secondly, that we
should honor God as the Author of so many good things, since He
sanctifies them for our use. Moses applies many epithets to the Spirit,
because he is speaking of so remarkable a work; yet we must conclude,
float whatever ability is possessed by any emanates from one only
source, and is conferred by God. This is the only difference, that
Bezaleel was endued with consummate excellence, whilst God makes
distribution to others according to His pleasure.

<span id="vi.i-p31"></span><span id="vi.i-p31.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p32"></span>**6.** *And I, behold, I have given with him
Aholiab*. It is no matter of surprise that the principal workman should
be chosen from the tribe of Judah;  <span
id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) why a companion should be given him
from the tribe of Dan can hardly be accounted for, unless its obscurity
more highly illustrated the grace of God.

<span id="vi.i-p34"></span>A kind of contradiction at first sight
appears, when it is added immediately afterwards that God had put wisdom
in the hearts of all that were wise-hearted; for, if they already
excelled in intelligence, what was the object of this new inspiration?
Hence it has been commonly supposed, that the special grace of God was
only given in aid of that ability which we naturally possess. But rather
are we taught by this passage that, when anything grows in us, and our
endowments manifest themselves more conspicuously, our progress is only
derived from the continued operation of the Spirit. God had already
conferred acuteness and intelligence on the artificers in question; yet
their dexterity was only, as it were, the seed; and He now promises that
He will give them more than had previously appeared. I know that the
words may be thus explained, — Whosoever shall be fit and proper for the
work, have therefore been endowed with intelligence, because God has
inspired it by His secret influence; but the other exposition is more
simple. What follows as to the various parts of the tabernacle has been
already treated of elsewhere.
