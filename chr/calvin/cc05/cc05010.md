<span id="ii.ii.iii"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii-p1"></span>The Exposition of the Commandment

<span id="ii.ii.iii.i"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii.i-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.iii.i-p1.1"></span>[Leviticus
19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#000.md)<span id="ii.ii.iii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii.i-p2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.iii.i-p2.1"></span>[Leviticus
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.ii.iii.i-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii.i-p3"></span>**17.** Thou shalt not hate thy brother
in thine heart.

<span id="ii.ii.iii.i-p4"></span>**17.** Ne oderis fratrem tuum in corde
tuo.

<span id="ii.ii.iii.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.ii.iii.i-p6"></span><span id="ii.ii.iii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii.i-p7"></span>I doubt not but that this part of the
verse should be taken separately, nor do I approve of the introduction
of the adversative particle *but*, by which translators  <span
id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) connect it with what follows. We know
that we are not always to trust to the division of verses; and, since it
is clear that whatever precepts we meet with in the writings of Moses
for the regulation of our lives depend on the Decalogue, this sentence
sufficiently proves that murder was forbidden, not only in order that
none should slay his brother by his \]land, or by a weapon, but also
that he should not indulge in wrong-doing, by cherishing in himself
hatred and ill-will. Hence the statement of Paul is confirmed, that “the
Law is spiritual,” (<span id="ii.ii.iii.i-p8.1"></span>[Ro
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.ii.iii.i-p8.1"></span>;) and their folly is refuted who pretend
that Moses was an earthly lawgiver to the Jews, like Lycurgus or Solon,
since he thus penetrates even to the secret affections. It is also
probable that John derived from this passage his saying, “He that hateth
his brother is a murderer,” (<span id="ii.ii.iii.i-p8.2"></span>[1Jo
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.ii.iii.i-p8.2"></span>;) for the word *heart* is here used
emphatically; since, although no outward signs of hatred may appear, yet
the internal feeling is accounted murder before God.

<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Leviticus
19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#000.md)<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>[Leviticus
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p3"></span>**18.** Thou shalt not avenge, nor
bear any grudge against the children of thy people; but thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself: I am the Lord.

<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p4"></span>**18.** Ne ulciscaris te, neque serves
odium contra filios populi tui: sed diliges proximum tuum sicut teipsum:
ego Jehova.

<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p6"></span><span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p7"></span>Hence it clearly appears that God had
a further object than that men should not kill each other, for He not
only restrains their hands, but requires their hearts to be pure from
all hatred. For, since the desire of vengeance is the fountain and cause
of enmities, it follows that under the word *kill* is condensed whatever
is opposed to brotherly love. And this is confirmed by the *antithesis*,
that none should hate his brother, but rather love him as himself. We
need, then, seek for no other expositor of the Commandment but God
Himself, who pronounces those to be guilty of murder who are affected
with any malevolence, and not only those who, when offended, desire to
return evil for evil, but those who do not sincerely love their
neighbors, even when with justice they deem them to be their enemies.
Wherefore, in order that God may absolve us from spiritual murder, let
us learn to purify our hearts from all desire of vengeance, and, laying
aside hatred, to cultivate fraternal affection with all men.

<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p8"></span><span
id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p8.1"></span>Although the latter part of the verse
embraces the sum of the whole Second Table, yet, because love is
contrasted with vengeance, I have not thought fit to separate things
which are so properly connected with each other, especially when one
depends on the other. The precept is indeed only given with reference to
the children of Abraham, because the crime of vengeance would be more
atrocious between those who were bound together by fraternal rights; yet
it is not to be doubted but that God generally condemns the vice. In the
schools  <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md) <span
id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p9.2"></span> this sentence was grossly corrupted; for,
since the rule (as they say) is superior to what is regulated by it.
they have invented a preposterous precept, that every one should love
himself first, and then his neighbors; of which subject I will treat
more fully elsewhere. The word <span
id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p9.3"></span>נטר<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p9.4"></span>,
*natar*<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p9.5"></span>, meaning to *guard*<span
id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p9.6"></span>, when used without any addition, is
equivalent to bearing an injury in mind; as we also say in French:
“*garder* *une* *injure*<span id="ii.ii.iii.ii-p9.7"></span>.”  <span
id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md)

<span id="ii.ii.iii.iii"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii.iii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.ii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Leviticus
19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#000.md)<span
id="ii.ii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii.iii-p2"></span><span
id="ii.ii.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>[Leviticus
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.ii.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii.iii-p3"></span>**14.** Thou shalt not curse the
deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God:
I *am* the Lord.

<span id="ii.ii.iii.iii-p4"></span>**14.** Surdo non maledices, et coram
caeco non pones offendiculum, sed timebis a Deo tuo: ego Jehova.

<span id="ii.ii.iii.iii-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.ii.iii.iii-p6"></span><span id="ii.ii.iii.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.iii.iii-p7"></span>Since the Law comprehends under the
word murder, all the wrongs whereby men are unjustly injured, that
cruelty was especially to be condemned by which those wretched persons
are afflicted, whose calamity ought rather to conciliate our compassion.
For, if any particle of humanity exists in us, when we meet a blind man
we shall be solicitous lest he should stumble or fall, and, if he goes
astray, we shall stretch out our hands to him and try to bring him back
into the way; we shall also spare the deaf, for to insult them is no
less absurd or barbarous than to assail stones with reproaches. It is,
therefore, gross brutality to increase the ills of those whom our
natural sense impels us to relieve, and who are already troubled more
than enough. Let us, then, learn from these words, that the weaker
people are, the more secure ought they to be from all oppression or
injury, and that, when we attack the defenseless, the crime of cruelty
is greatly aggravated, whilst any insult against the calamitous is
altogether intolerable to God.

Papaute.” *C*. refers elsewhere to this scholastic maxim: “Nor is the
argument worth a straw, *That* *the* *thing* *regulated* *must* *always*
*be* *inferior* *to* *the* *rule*. The Lord did not make self-love the
rule, as if love towards others was subordinate to it; but whereas,
through natural pravity, the feeling of love usually rests on ourselves,
He shows that it ought to diffuse itself in another direction — that is,
should be prepared to do good to our neighbor with no less alacrity,
ardor, and solicitude, than to ourselves.” — Inst., book 2, 8, Section
54. “Again, when Moses commanded us to love our neighbors as ourselves,
he did not intend to put the love of ourselves in the first place, so
that a man may first love himself and then love his neighbors: as the
sophists of the *Sorbonne* are wont to cavil, that *the* *rule* *must*
*always* *go* *before* *what* *it* *regulates*.” — Harm. of the
