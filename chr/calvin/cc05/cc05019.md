<span id="ii.iii.vi.i-p4"></span>**11.** When men strive together one
with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her
husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her
hand, and taketh him by the secrets;

<span id="ii.iii.vi.i-p5"></span>**11.** Quum rixati fuerunt viri simul
alter cum altero, et accesserit uxor unius ut eruat maritum suum e manu
percutientis eum, et immiserit manum suam, apprehenderitque pudenda
ejus:

<span id="ii.iii.vi.i-p6"></span>**12.** Then thou shalt cut off her
hand, thine eye shall not pity *her*

<span id="ii.iii.vi.i-p7"></span>**12.** Tunc abscindes manum illius,
nec oculus tuus parcet.

<span id="ii.iii.vi.i-p8"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.vi.i-p9"></span><span id="ii.iii.vi.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.vi.i-p10"></span>This Law is apparently harsh, but its
severity skews how very pleasing to God is modesty, whilst, on the other
hand, He abominates indecency; for, if in the heat of a quarrel, when
the agitation of the mind is an excuse for excesses, it was a crime thus
heavily punished, for a woman to take hold of the private parts of a man
who was not her husband, much less would God have her lasciviousness
pardoned, if a woman were impelled by lust to do anything of the sort.
Neither can we doubt but that the judges, in punishing obscenity, were
bound to argue from the less to the greater. A threat is also added,
lest the severity of the punishment should influence their minds to be
tender and remiss ill inflicting it. It was indeed inexcusable
effrontery, willfully to assail that part of the body, from the sight
and touch of which all chaste women naturally recoil.

<span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p3"></span>**12.** Thou shalt make thee fringes
upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest *thyself*

<span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p4"></span>**12.** Fimbrias facies tibi in
quatuor oris operimenti tui quo operies te.

<span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p5"></span>**5.** The woman shall not wear that
which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s
garment: for all that do so *are* abomination unto the Lord thy God.

<span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p6"></span>**5.** Mulier non feret arma viri, nec
induet vir muliebre vestimentum: quia abominatio Jehovae Dei tui est
quicunque haec facit

<span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p7"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p8"></span><span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p9"></span>**12.** This also was a part of, or
accessory to, chastity, to have regard to modesty in dress; for since
the thighs were then without covering, a door was thus opened to many
improprieties, if the upper garments were not closed, and many, as if by
accident, would have abused this, if it had been allowed, as an
incentive to licentiousness; for we see that many rush into such
excesses of lasciviousness, as to glory in their shame. God, therefore,
would have the flaps of their gowns thus drawn together by ties or
latchets, that not even by chance could those parts be uncovered, which
cannot be decently or modestly looked upon. But if divine provisions
were made even with respect to their garments, so that the elect people
should cultivate decency, and diligently guard against everything
immodest, it is abundantly clear that not only were adulteries
condemned, but whatever is repugnant to purity and chastity. This
passage is improperly referred to the fringes which were sewed to their
garments to renew the recollection of the Law, since decency and
delicacy are here alone regarded.

<span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p10"></span><span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p11"></span>**5.** This decree also commends
modesty in general, and in it God anticipates the danger, lest women
should harden themselves into forgetfulness of modesty, or men should
degenerate into effeminacy unworthy of their nature. Garments are not in
themselves of so much importance; but as it is disgraceful for men to
become effeminate, and also for women to affect manliness in their dress
and gestures, propriety and modesty are prescribed, not only for
decency’s sake, but lest one kind of liberty should at length lead to
something worse. The words of the heathen poet are very true:  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md)

<span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p15"></span>*“What* *shame* *can* *she,* *who*
*wears* *a* *helmet,* *show,  
Her* *sex* *deserting?”*

<span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p16"></span>Wherefore, decency in the fashion of
the clothes is an excellent preservative of modesty.

pudorem,  
Quae fugit a sexu.”

<span id="ii.iii.vi.ii-p14"></span>The *Fr*. translation is forcible:
“qu’une femme, qui contrefait le gendarme, et fuit son sexe, ne gardera
nulle honte.”
