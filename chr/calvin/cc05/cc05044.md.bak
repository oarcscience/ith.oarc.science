<span id="v.x-p3"></span>**25.** When thou shalt beget children, and
children’s children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and
shall corrupt *yourselves*, and make a graven image, or the likeness of
any *thing*, and shall do evil in the sight of the Lord thy God, to
provoke him to anger;

<span id="v.x-p4"></span>**25.** Quum genueris filios et nepotes, et
senueritis in terra illa, corruperitis autem vos, et feceritis
sculptile, imaginem cujuscunque rei atque feceritis malum in oculis
Jehovae Dei vestri, irritando illum,

<span id="v.x-p5"></span>**26.** I call heaven and earth to witness
against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the
land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong
*your* days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.

<span id="v.x-p6"></span>**26.** Testor contra vos hodie coelum et
terram, quod pereundo peribitis cito e terra ad quam pergendo transituri
estis Jordanem, ut possideatis eam: non protrahetis dies in ea: quia
disperdendo disperdemini.

<span id="v.x-p7"></span>**27.** And the Lord shall scatter you among
the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen,
whither the Lord shall lead you.

<span id="v.x-p8"></span>**27.** Ac disperget vos Jehova inter populos,
et relinquemini homines pauci numero in gentibus ad quas deducet vos
Jehova.

<span id="v.x-p9"></span>**28.** And there ye shall serve gods, the work
of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat,
nor smell.

<span id="v.x-p10"></span>**28.** Servietisque ibi diis, operi manuum
hominum, ligno et lapidi, quae non vident, nec audiunt, nec comedunt,
nec odorantur.

<span id="v.x-p11"></span>**29.** But if from thence thou shalt seek the
Lord thy God, thou shalt find *him*, if thou seek him with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul.

<span id="v.x-p12"></span>**29.** Quod si requisieris inde Jehovam Deum
tuum, tum invenies, si requisieris eum toto corde tuo, et tota anima
tua.

<span id="v.x-p13"></span>**30.** When thou art in tribulation, and all
these things are come upon thee, *even* in the latter days, if thou turn
to the Lord thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;

<span id="v.x-p14"></span>**30.** Quum fuerit tibi angustia,
invenerintque te omnia ista, in novissimis diebus si reversus fueris ad
Jehovam Deum tuum, et parueris voci ejus:

<span id="v.x-p15"></span>**31.** (For the Lord thy God is a merciful
God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the
covenant of thy fathers, which he sware unto them.

<span id="v.x-p16"></span>**31.** (Quia Deus misericors est Jehova Deus
tuus) non derelinquet te, neque disperdet te, neque oblivisectur pacti
patrum tuorum de quo juravit illis.

<span id="v.x-p17"></span> 

<span id="v.x-p18"></span><span id="v.x-p18.1"></span>

<span id="v.x-p19"></span>**25.** *When thou shalt beget children, and
children’s children*. Although at the outset he only adverts to
idolatry, yet, inasmuch as he thence takes occasion to inveigh generally
against the transgressors of the Law, and denounces punishment against
them, I have thought it advisable to introduce this passage amongst the
Sanctions (of the Law.) He had already strictly forbidden them to turn
aside to idols; he now requires this instruction to be handed down to
their grand-children and their whole race; as though he had said, that
they must continue faithfully in the pure worship of God, not only lest
they should deprive themselves of entering the land of Canaan, but also
lest, after having long enjoyed quiet possession of it, they should be
expelled from it. For long possession might have hardened their minds in
security and arrogance, as if they had no change to fear. Lest,
therefore, as time should pass away, they should trust that they were
firmly established, and advance to greater license, he now reminds them
that the punishment which he had already taught them to await
themselves, would also be extended to their descendants; since it was no
less easy for God to drive their  <span
id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) distant posterity from their quiet
nest, than it would have been for Him to prevent their taking possession
of it. But although he is treating of idols, still he addresses them on
the subject of the curse, which overhangs all despisers of God. And, in
order that the threat may affect them more deeply, he calls on “heaven
and earth to witness;” as though he had said, that even things inanimate
and without reason were in a manner conscious of the vengeance of God.
Their opinion  <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) is a poor one who
think that angels and men are thus designated by a *metonomy*; for we
shall see a little further on that the same form of expression is
repeated. And when he says in his song, (<span id="v.x-p24.1"></span>[De
32:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001)<span id="v.x-p24.1"></span>,.md)
“Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth,” it is to
signify by *hyperbole* that his address is worthy of being listened to
by all creatures. Thus Isaiah, the more to shame the Jews, who had
become stupified in their folly, addresses his words to the heavens and
earth. (<span id="v.x-p24.2"></span>[Isa
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002)<span id="v.x-p24.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.x-p25"></span>When he calls heaven and earth to witness
God’s vengeance, it is as much as to say, that it will as clearly appear
as the heaven and earth appear before our eyes; and after he has said
that they shall perish, he also declares in what manner, viz., that God
would scatter them hither and thither, and reduce them to a small
number. What follows might seem absurd, inasmuch as it ought not to be
reckoned among their punishments that they should serve idols among
strangers, whereas they had already worshipped them of their own accord
in their own land; but this difficulty is easily solved, and in two
ways, either that banishment was a just reward to them in order that
there they might indulge to their full these impure dispositions; and
thus there will be an antithesis between the nations of the heathen and
the Holy Land, as though God had said that He would not; suffer them to
profane the latter by their superstitions; or else, that then, the veil
being as it were removed, they should be ashamed when they should be
compelled to serve dead idols. Nor can it be questioned but that then
they were wounded in spirit by the same disgusting practices in which
they had before taken pleasure; and I (See *ante* on <span
id="v.x-p25.2"></span>[Deuteronomy
28:36](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036.md)<span id="v.x-p25.2"></span>, p.
254.) have stated elsewhere that I prefer this latter sense. Meanwhile,
he reproaches them for their stupidity in adoring  <span
id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) dead images, formed of corruptible
things, and the work of men’s hands.

<span id="v.x-p27"></span><span id="v.x-p27.1"></span>

<span id="v.x-p28"></span>**29.** *But if from thence thou shalt seek
the Lord*. In this passage also he exhorts and encourages them in the
confidence of obtaining pardon, and thus anticipates them, so that they
might not be overwhelmed with sorrow when smitten by God’s hand; for
despair awakens such rage in the wretched that they cannot submit
themselves to God. He sets before them, then, another object in their
punishments, that they may not cease to taste of God’s goodness in the
midst of their afflictions, whereby He invites them to repentance. For
the sinner will never set about seeking God, unless he deems Him to be
accessible to prayer. Moreover, he warns them to return truly and
sincerely to a sound mind, because they will gain nothing by false
profession. We know that nothing is more common than to make complaint
to God whenever we are oppressed with troubles, but, when they are at
all intermitted, immediately to return to our natural state. Sincere
conversion is, therefore, prescribed; for “all the heart” is precisely
equivalent to an upright heart, (*integrum*,) which is contrasted with a
double or feigned one; and this must be noted,  <span
id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) lest a sense of our infirmity should
disturb us; for, since it is not possible for men to give themselves
wholly to God, the knowledge of their own inability is apt to induce
listlessness; whereas, provided we do not deal deceitfully, it is
declared that our penitence is approved by God.

<span id="v.x-p30"></span><span id="v.x-p30.1"></span>

<span id="v.x-p31"></span>**30.** *When thou art in tribulation*. He
here shews the advantage of punishments, on the ground of their
usefulness and profit; for what the Apostle says is confirmed by
experience, that

<span id="v.x-p32"></span>“no chastening for the present seemeth to be
joyous, but grievous; nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
fruit of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby.”  
(<span id="v.x-p32.2"></span>[Heb
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011)<span id="v.x-p32.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.x-p33"></span>Lest, therefore, they should be provoked to
wrath by God’s stripes, he reminds them of their usefulness to them,
because they would never turn to God unless aided by this remedy. He
tells them that, after they shall have been afflicted by the curses of
God, if they sought after Him, they should find Him: and further, he
gives them grounds for hope both in God’s nature and in His covenant. He
assures them that God will be willing to be appeased, because He is by
nature merciful; but he adds another confirmation of this, which is more
certain and familiar, viz., because God had adopted them by a perpetual
covenant.
