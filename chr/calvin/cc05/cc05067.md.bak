<span id="vii.viii-p3"></span>**1.** And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of
Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put
incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which he
commanded them not.

<span id="vii.viii-p4"></span>**1.** Acceperunt autem filii Aharon:,
Nadab et Abihu quisque acerram sham, et posuerunt in ipsis ignem, et
supposuerunt suffimentum, obtuleruntque eoram Jebova ignem alienum secus
quam praeceperat eis.

<span id="vii.viii-p5"></span>**2.** And there went out fire from the
Lord, and devoured them; and they died before the Lord.

<span id="vii.viii-p6"></span>**2.** Tunc egressus est ignis a facie
Jehova, et mortui sunt coram Jehova.

<span id="vii.viii-p7"></span>**3.** Then Moses said unto Aaron, This
*is* *it* that the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that
come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron
held his peace.

<span id="vii.viii-p8"></span>**3.** Et dixit Moses ad Aharon, Hoc est
quod dixit Jehova, dicendo, In propinquis meis sanctificabor, et in
conspectu totius populi glorificabor, et siluit Aharon.

<span id="vii.viii-p9"></span>**4.** And Moses called Mishael and
Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them,
Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the
camp.

<span id="vii.viii-p10"></span>**4.** Et vocavit Moses, Misael et
Elsapham filios Uziel patrut Aharon, et dixit illis, Accedite, exportate
fratres vestros a conspectu sanctuarii extra castra.

<span id="vii.viii-p11"></span>**5.** So they went near, and carried
them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.

<span id="vii.viii-p12"></span>**5.** Accesserunt ergo, et exportaverunt
eos cum suis tunicis extra castra, quemadmodum praeceperat *Moses.*

<span id="vii.viii-p13"></span>**6.** And Moses said unto Aaron, and
unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither
rend your clothes, lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people:
but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning
which the Lord hath kindled.

<span id="vii.viii-p14"></span>**6.** Dixit etiam Moses ad Aharon, et
Eleazar, et Ithamar, filios ejus, Capita vestra ne nudetis, et vestes
vestras ne scindatis, ut non moriamini, ac me in totam congregationem
irascatur: fratres autem vestri, tota domus Israel, flebunt incendium
qued incendit Jehova.

<span id="vii.viii-p15"></span>**7.** And ye shall not go out from the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the
anointing oil of the Lord *is* upon you. And they did according to the
word of Moses.

<span id="vii.viii-p16"></span>**7.** Neque ab ostio tabernaculi
conventionis egrediemini: ne moriamini: quia oleum unctionis Jehovae est
super vos. Et fecerunt secundum verbum Mosis.

<span id="vii.viii-p17"></span>**12.** And Moses spake unto Aaron, and
unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the
meat-offering that remaineth of the offerings of the Lord made by fire,
and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it *is* most holy.

<span id="vii.viii-p18"></span>**12.** Loquutus est autem Moses ad
Aharon, et Eleazar et Ithamar filios ejus, qui reliqui erant, Tollite
minha quae remansit ex oblationibus ignitis Jehovae et comedite illam
cum azymis juxta altare: qnia sanctitas sanctitatum est.

<span id="vii.viii-p19"></span>**13.** And ye shall eat it in the holy
place, because it *is* thy due, and thy sons’ due, of the sacrifices of
the Lord made by fire: for so I am commanded.

<span id="vii.viii-p20"></span>**13.** Comedetis, inquam, illam in loco
sancto: quia in statutum tibi et in statutum iiliis tuis est de
oblationibus ignitis Jehovae: quia sic jussus sum.

<span id="vii.viii-p21"></span>**14.** And the wave-breast and
heave-shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and
thy daughters with thee: for *they* *be* thy due, and thy sons’ due,
*which* are given out of the sacrifices of peace-offerings of the
children of Israel.

<span id="vii.viii-p22"></span>**14.** Et pectusculum agitationis, et
armum elevationis comedetis in loco mundo, tu et filii tui, et filiae
tuae tecum: quia in statutum tibi et in statutum filiis tuis data sunt
de sacrificiis prosperitatum filiorum Israel.

<span id="vii.viii-p23"></span>**15.** The heave-shoulder and the
wave-breast shall they bring, with the offerings made by fire of the
fat, to wave *it* *for* a wave-offering before the Lord; and it shall be
thine, and thy sons with thee, by a statute for ever; as the Lord hath
commanded.

<span id="vii.viii-p24"></span>**15.** Armurn elevationis, et
pectusculum agitationis cure oblationibus ignitis adipum afferent, ut
agites agitatione coram Jehova: et hoc erit tibi et filiis tuis tecum in
statutum perpetuum, quemadmodum princepit Jehova.

<span id="vii.viii-p25"></span>**16.** And Moses diligently sought the
goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry
with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron *which* *were* left *alive,*
saying,

<span id="vii.viii-p26"></span>**16.** Et hircum oblatum pro peccato
requirendo requisivit Moses, et ecce, combustus erat: tum iratus est
contra Eleazar et Ithamar filius Aharon relictos, dicendo:

<span id="vii.viii-p27"></span>**17.** Wherefore have ye not eaten the
sin-offering in the holy place, seeing it *is* most holy, and *God* hath
given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement
for them before the Lord?

<span id="vii.viii-p28"></span>**17.** Cur non comedistis oblationem pro
peccato in loco sanctitatis? est enim sanctitas sanctitatum, quum illam
dederit vobis ad portandum iniquitatem congregationis, et ad expiandum
cos eoram Jehova.

<span id="vii.viii-p29"></span>**18.** Behold, the blood of it was not
brought in within the holy *place:* ye should indeed have eaten in
theholy *place,* as I commanded.

<span id="vii.viii-p30"></span>**18.** Ecce, nequaquam illatus est
sanguis ejus in sanctitatem intrinsecus: comedendo comedere debueraris
illam in sanctuario, quemadmodum praecepi.

<span id="vii.viii-p31"></span>**19.** And Aaron said unto Moses,
Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their
burnt-offering before the Lord; and such things have befallen me: and if
I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, should it have been accepted in the
sight of the Lord?

<span id="vii.viii-p32"></span>**19.** Loquutus est autem Aharon ad
Mosen, Ecce, hodie obtulerunt oblationem suam pro peccato, et
holocaustum suum coram Jehova: et evenerunt mihi talia, et, si
comedissem oblationem pro peccato bodie, nunquid placuisset in oculis
Jehovae?

<span id="vii.viii-p33"></span>**20.** And when Moses heard *that,* he
was content.

<span id="vii.viii-p34"></span>**20.** Postquam id audivit Moses:
placuit ei.

<span id="vii.viii-p35"></span> 

<span id="vii.viii-p36"></span><span id="vii.viii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p37"></span>**1.** *And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of
Aaron* A memorable circumstance is here recorded, from whence it appears
how greatly God abominates all the sins whereby the purity of religion
is corrupted. Apparently it was a light transgression to use strange
fire for burning incense; and again their thoughtlessness would seem
excusable, for certainly Nadab and Abihu did not wantonly or
intentionally desire to pollute the sacred things, but, as is often the
case in matters of novelty, when they were setting about them too
eagerly, their precipitancy led them into error. The severity of the
punishment, therefore, would not please those arrogant people, who do
not hesitate superciliously to criticise God’s judgments; but if we
reflect how holy a thing God’s worship is, the enormity of the
punishment will by no means offend us. Besides, it was necessary that
their religion should be sanctioned at its very commencement; for if God
had suffered the sons of Aaron to transgress with impunity, they would
have afterwards carelessly neglected the whole Law. This, therefore, was
the reason of such great severity, that the priests should anxiously
watch against all profanation. Their crime is specified, viz., that they
offered incense in a different way from that which God had prescribed,
and consequently, although they may have erred from ignorance, still
they were convicted by God’s commandment of having negligently set about
what was worthy of greater attention. The “strange fire” is
distinguished from the sacred fire which was always burning upon the
altar: not miraculously, as some pretend, but by the constant
watchfulness of the priests. Now, God had forbidden any other fire to be
used in the ordinances, in order to exclude all extraneous rites, and to
shew His detestation of whatever might be derived from elsewhere. Let us
learn, therefore, so to attend to God’s command as not to corrupt His
worship by any strange inventions. But if He so severely avenged this
error, how horrible a punishment awaits the Papists, who are not ashamed
obstinately to defend so many gross corruptions!

<span id="vii.viii-p38"></span><span id="vii.viii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p39"></span>**3.** *Then Moses said unto Aaron, This
is it that the Lord spake* Moses restrains his brother from giving way
to excessive grief; for this was a very bitter stroke after their recent
joy to see himself at once deprived of two sons on the same day, and at
the same moment, he might, too, have been disposed to murmur against God
for the cause of their death. Lest, therefore, He should give way to
such want of self-control, Moses reminds him that he must submit to the
just judgment of God. We shall, however, seek in vain for what is here
referred to,  <span id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) “I will be
glorified in them that come nigh me.” He had often threatened the
priests witlt death if they departed in the least degree from the
prescribed rule: He had often set before them the sacredness of their
office, lest they should defile themselves by any sacrilegious act; in a
word, He had chosen them to be His ministers in holy things, on the
condition that they should know themselves to be subject to greater
guilt and punishment than the rest of the people. By this consolation,
then, Aaron’s grief is quieted, that God had not dealt cruelly with his
sons, but had shewn forth in them a just and profitable example, in
order that their successors might be more attentive in their duties; for
thus should the sentence be paraphrased: In order that I may be
glorified before the whole people, I must be sanctified by those of the
highest degree and consequence; or, When I shall have been sanctified by
the priests themselves, whose dignity is the highest, my glory will
shine forth before the whole people. And, in point of fact, although God
may punish whole bodies of obscure persons, such lessons have but little
effect; but the punishment of men of more noble and illustrious
condition draws almost all eyes to the judgments of God. For God is said
to be sanctified in us in many ways, whether He shews Himself to be a
pitiful or a severe Judge. This declaration, then, is an exhortation to
those whom he has dignified with peculiar honor, to walk in fear and
trembling; for, since “judgment begins at the house of God,” the greater
are the gifts and the higher the pre-eminence is with which any one is
blessed, the greater is his obligation to God, and his ingratitude
worthy of severer punishment.

<span id="vii.viii-p41"></span>**3.** *And Aaron held his peace* Much is
this silence of Aaron to be applauded, whereby he confessed that his
sons were slain by the just judgment of God; for Moses indicates that he
yielded to his admonition, and was thus restrained from complaining
against. God. Thus Paul teaches us that Scripture is given to teach us
patience. (<span id="vii.viii-p41.1"></span>[Ro
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004.md)<span
id="vii.viii-p41.1"></span>.) Wherefore, whenever our passions are too
much excited, let us learn that this is the best remedy for quieting and
repressing them, to *submit* *ourselves* *to* *God,* and to *humble*
*ourselves* *beneath* *his* *mighty* *hand.* David invites us to this by
his own example when he says,

<span id="vii.viii-p42"></span>“I was dumb, I opened not my mouth;
because thou didst it.” (<span id="vii.viii-p42.1"></span>[Ps
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#009.md)<span
id="vii.viii-p42.1"></span>.)

<span id="vii.viii-p43"></span><span id="vii.viii-p43.1"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p44"></span>**4.** *And Moses called Mishael and
Elzaphan* Lest Eleazar and Ithamar should carry  <span
id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md) forth the corpses, Moses commanded
these others to anticipate them. It may also have been the case that all
were stupified by terror. He forbids the father and brothers to mourn
their death, not so much in accordance with the law, whereby all except
the high priest were permitted to mourn for their own brother, as to
prevent this memorable lesson from being obscured by their grief, since
thus was the sanctity of their religion magnificently asserted.
Nevertheless, God allowed the dead men to be bewailed by the people,
lest the recollection of their punishment should too soon be lost.

<span id="vii.viii-p46"></span>When he forbids (Aaron  <span
id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417) and his sons.md) to go out from the door
of the tabernacle, he does not mean so to fix them to that place as to
banish them from their own private tents, but he withholds them from all
pollution which might have compelled them to desert or interrupt their
duty.

<span id="vii.viii-p48"></span><span id="vii.viii-p48.1"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p49"></span>**12.** *And Moses spake unto Aaron, and
unto Eleazar* Lest hereafter the priests should transgress through
ignorance, Moses admonishes them of their duty; and perhaps he was moved
by some immediate reason to give these particular injunctions rather
than any others. As yet they were but little practiced in the observance
of the rites; and what had happened to their brethren must have rendered
them anxious. Now, this consternation at the death of their brethren
might have so confounded their senses, that they could not apply
themselves with so much composure as they ought to the service of God;
and thus the offering would have been improperly made. Lest, therefore,
their grief should so disturb them as to prevent the due performance of
their office, he commands them to eat what remained of the meat-offering
with the burnt-sacrifices. Whence we gather that he endeavored to
prevent them from transgressing on that day in consequence of their
minds being occupied by their recent grief. And in order to induce them
to obedience, he sets before them the authority of God, to which it was
fitting that the priesthood should be subject, as being founded upon it.

<span id="vii.viii-p50"></span><span id="vii.viii-p50.1"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p51"></span>**16.** *And Moses diligently sought the
goat of the sin-offering* Moses had not omitted to tell them what was to
be done with the goat; and the sacrifice which he had himself performed,
was a visible instruction to them. He had set before them what they
should imitate, and this would have been enough even for children. But,
as I have said, in such serious matters Moses had not spared labor and
care, whereas the sons of Aaron, as if they had neither heard nor seen
anything of the sort, pervert the whole order of them, although they had
been just before reminded that they had been appointed to keep the
charge of God. Perhaps they were impelled to this error by the trouble
arising from their grief; but we gather from hence that however
exquisite may be the ability of masters and teachers, it may be often
fruitless unless they have obedient scholars with retentive memories.
And hence also we learn that when God often inculcates the same thing,
His labor is not superfluous, because we do not understand what we seem
to understand; or what has been clearly shewn to us soon afterwards
escapes.

<span id="vii.viii-p52"></span>Further from the anger of Moses, which is
mentioned in his praise, we may infer that the transgression was no
light one, although it was not so severely punished as the presumption
of Nadab and Abihu. The excuse which some make for them, or allege in
extenuation of their crime, that they thought they were deprived of the
right before accorded to them, and therefore abstained through modesty,
is refuted by the answer of Aaron himself. It was, therefore, grief
alone which impelled them to this error. But the reason why God was more
merciful to them than to their brethren, is only known to Himself.
Conjectures may, indeed, be advanced; but at last we must come to this,
that because God’s judgments are hidden, they are not therefore unjust;
but that we must humbly adore their depth into which the minds of men
cannot penetrate.

<span id="vii.viii-p53"></span>**19.** *And Aaron said unto Moses,
Behold, this day* Aaron replies that it arose from pious fear that they
had not feasted before God, because they would in a manner have defiled
the sanctuary by their tears and melancholy, as if he had said, Part
indeed of the sin-offering was reserved for our food, but we could not
properly partake of it except in cheerfulness and with thanksgiving. The
grief arising from his sudden bereavement did not allow of this; but it
was not a just defense; for he ought rather to have striven against the
feelings of the flesh, so that his domestic calamity should not withhold
him from the service of God. But, inasmuch as in his perplexity his fear
was deserving of pity, Moses forgives him; and it is said that he was
appeased, because he finds less of evil than he supposed.
