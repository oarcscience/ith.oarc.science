<span id="ii.v.ii-p1"></span>The Exposition of the Commandment

<span id="ii.v.ii.i"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p1"></span><span id="ii.v.ii.i-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
23](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#000.md)<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p2"></span><span id="ii.v.ii.i-p2.1"></span>[Exod.
23:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#002.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#007.md)<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Thou shalt not raise a false
report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p4"></span>**1.** Non suscipies vocem mendacii,
neque adjicias manum tuam impio ut sis testis mendax.

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Thou shalt not follow a multitude
to *do* evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many
to wrest *judgment*

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p6"></span>**2.** Non eris post multos ad mala,
neque respondebis in causa, ut declines post multos ad pervertendum.

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p7"></span>**7.** Keep thee far from a false matter;
and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the
wicked.

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p8"></span>**7.** A sermone mendacii longe aberis:
nec occides innocentem et justum: quia non justificabo impium.

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p9"></span> 

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p10"></span><span id="ii.v.ii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p11"></span>**1.** *Thou shalt not receive* (margin)
*a false report*. It might also be translated, Thou shalt not *raise*,
or *stir* *up*: and, if this be preferred, God forbids us to invent
calumnies; but, if we read, Thou shalt not receive, He will go further,
*i* *e*., that none should cherish, or confirm the lie of another by his
support of it. For it has been stated that sin may thus be committed in
two ways: either when the wicked invent false accusations, or when other
over-credulous persons eagerly associate themselves with them; and thus
either sense would be very applicable, that the original authors are
condemned, who raise a false report, or those who help on their
wickedness, and give it, as it were, their endorsement. But, since it
immediately follows, “put not thine hand with” them, I willingly embrace
the version, “Thou shalt not receive,” in order that the two clauses may
combine the better. Indeed Moses uses this word with great propriety,
for a lie would soon come to nothing from its own emptiness, and fall to
the ground, if it were not taken up and supported by the unrighteous
consent of others. God, therefore, recalls His people from this wicked
conspiracy,  <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) lest by their
assistance they should spread abroad false accusations; and calls those
false witnesses who traduce their neighbors by lending their hand to the
ungodly: because there is but little difference between raising a
calumny and keeping it up.

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p13"></span>If it be thought preferable to restrict
the second verse to judges, it would be a Supplement to the Sixth
Commandment as well as the Eighth, viz., that none should willingly give
way to the unjust opinions of others, which might affect either the
means or the life of an innocent person. But, inasmuch as the error of
those who are too credulous is reproved by it, whence it arises that
falsehood prevails, and calumniators throw what is clear into obscurity,
it finds a fit place here.  <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md)

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p15"></span><span id="ii.v.ii.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii.i-p16"></span>**7.** *Keep thee far from a false
matter*. Since he seems to speak of perjury, which brings about the
death of the innocent, some might perhaps prefer that this passage
should be annexed to the Sixth Commandment; but this is easily solved;
for Moses is expressly condemning false-witness, and at the same time
instances one case of it, whereby it may appear how detestable a crime
it is, viz., the slaying of a brother by calumny, because the false
witness rather kills him with his tongue than the executioner with his
sword. Although, therefore, it is a gross act of inhumanity to lie in
general against one’s brother, yet is its atrocity increased if he be
put to death by perjury; because murder is thus combined with perfidy. A
threat follows, whereby God summons false-witnesses before His tribunal,
where they who have brought the good into peril by their falsehoods
shall not escape with impunity.

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.v.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Leviticus
19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#000.md)<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p2"></span><span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>[Lev.
19:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#017.md)<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p3"></span>**16.** Thou shalt not go up and down
*as* a tale-bearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand against
the blood of thy neighbor: I am the Lord.

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p4"></span>**16.** Non incedes obtrectator in
populis tuis, nec stabis contra sanguinem proximi tui: ego Jehova.

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p5"></span>**17.** Thou shalt in any wise rebuke
thy neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him.

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p6"></span>**17.** Corripiendo corripies proximum
tuum, neque excitabis super eum crimen.

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p7"></span> 

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p8"></span><span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p9"></span>**16.** *Thou shalt not go up and
down*<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p9.1"></span>. The principle of the second
clause is the same as that of the foregoing verse, for it is added to a
general precept, whereby detraction is condemned: and much more ought we
to be deterred from it, whilst we acknowledge that our tongue is thus
armed cruelly to shed innocent blood. Some suppose that the word <span
id="ii.v.ii.ii-p9.2"></span>רכיל<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p9.3"></span>,
*racil*<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p9.4"></span>, is metaphorically taken from
merchants, because the tale-bearer or whisperer  <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) <span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p10.26"></span>
is no less busy in hunting for false reports, which he may afterwards
circulate, than the merchant is diligently bent on buying and selling.
Others think that there is a change of the letter <span
id="ii.v.ii.ii-p10.27"></span>ג<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p10.28"></span> into
<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p10.29"></span>כ<span
id="ii.v.ii.ii-p10.30"></span>; and that thus the word is derived from
the *feet*<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p10.31"></span>; because calumniators are
always wandering about to hunt for grounds of detraction; and therefore
is always joined with a verb which signifies to walk. I do not think,
however, that it is always used in the same sense; for when Ezekiel
reproves the Israelites, because there were always men called <span
id="ii.v.ii.ii-p10.32"></span>רכיל<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p10.33"></span>,
*racil*<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p10.34"></span>, among them, to shed blood,
 <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) <span
id="ii.v.ii.ii-p11.1"></span> I understand men of fraud, or fraudulent
persons, who plot against the good to procure their destruction. (<span
id="ii.v.ii.ii-p11.2"></span>[Eze
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.v.ii.ii-p11.2"></span><span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p11.3"></span>.) Some
also translate it spies. Meanwhile, I doubt not, but that Moses, in this
passage, designates those vagabonds, who too eagerly run about hither
and thither, and in their malignant inquisitiveness penetrate into
everybody’s secrets, to bring quiet people into trouble. In short, we
are taught that they are *accounted*<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p11.4"></span>
false witnesses before God, whosoever by the virulence of their tongue
bring their brethren into danger and inconvenience.

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p12"></span><span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p13"></span>**17.** *Thou shalt in any wise rebuke
thy neighbor*<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p13.1"></span>. Because many, under
the pretext of conscientiousness, are not only rigid censors of others,
but also burst out in the open proclamation of their defects, Moses
seeks to prevent this preposterous zeal, shewing how they may best
restrain it, not by encouraging sin through their connivance or silence,
whilst they are still far from evil-speaking. For those who labor under
this disease of carping and vituperating, are wont to object that sins
are nourished by silence, unless all are eager in reproving them; and
hence their ardor in exclaiming against them and deriding them. But
Moses points out a more useful remedy, that they should bring back
wanderers into the way by private rebukes, and not by publishing their
offenses. For whosoever triumphs in the infamy of his brother,
precipitates his ruin as far as in him lies; whereas a well-regulated
zeal consults the welfare of one who is ruining himself. Therefore we
are commanded to rebuke the wandering, and not to regard our brethren as
enemies. A similar course is prescribed by Christ, “If thy brother shall
trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him
alone.” (<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p13.2"></span>[Mt
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.v.ii.ii-p13.2"></span><span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p13.3"></span>.) In
fine, an immoderate love of fault-finding will always be found to be
arrogant and cruel. The word <span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p13.4"></span>נשא<span
id="ii.v.ii.ii-p13.5"></span>, *nasa*<span
id="ii.v.ii.ii-p13.6"></span>, undoubtedly means to publish what was
concealed, and thus by exposure to drive to despair those who would else
have been corrigible.
