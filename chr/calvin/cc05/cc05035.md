<span id="v.i-p6"></span><span id="v.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p7"></span>**5.** *Ye shall therefore keep my statutes*.
Although Moses introduces this passage, where he exhorts the Israelites
to cultivate chastity in respect to marriage, and not to fall into the
incestuous pollutions of the Gentiles, yet, as it is a remarkable one,
and contains general instruction, from whence Paul derives his
definition of the righteousness of the Law, (<span
id="v.i-p7.1"></span>[Ro 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005)<span
id="v.i-p7.1"></span>,) it seems to me to come in very appropriately
here, inasmuch as it sanctions and confirms the Law by the promise of
reward. The hope of eternal life is, therefore, given to all who keep
the Law; for those who expound the passage as referring to this earthly
and transitory life are mistaken.  <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194) The cause of this error was, because
they feared that thus the righteousness of faith might be subverted, and
salvation grounded on the merit of works. But Scripture does not
therefore deny that men are justified by works, because the Law itself
is imperfect, or does not give instructions for perfect righteousness;
but because the promise is made of none effect by our corruption and
sin. Paul, therefore, as I have just said, when he teaches that
righteousness is to be sought for in the grace of Christ by faith,
(<span id="v.i-p8.4"></span>[Ro
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#004)<span id="v.i-p8.4"></span>,)
proves his statement by this argument, that none is justified who has
not fulfilled what the Law commands. Elsewhere also he reasons by
contrast, where he contends that the Law does not accord with faith as
regards the cause of justification, because the Law requires works for
the attainment of salvation, whilst faith directs us to Christ, that we
may be delivered from the curse of the Law. Foolishly, then, do some
reject as an absurdity the statement, that if a man fulfills the Law he
attains to righteousness; for the defect does not arise from the
doctrine of the Law, but from the infirmity of men, as is plain from
another testimony given by Paul. (<span id="v.i-p8.5"></span>[Ro
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003)<span id="v.i-p8.5"></span>.) We
must observe, however, that salvation is not to be expected from the Law
unless its precepts be in every respect complied with; for life is not
promised to one who shall have done this thing, or that thing, but, by
the plural word, full obedience is required of us. The pratings of the
Popish theologians about partial righteousness are frivolous and silly,
since God embraces at once all the commandments; and who is there that
can boast of having thoroughly fulfilled them? If, then, none was ever
clear of transgression, or ever will be, although God by no means
deceives us, yet the promise becomes ineffectual, because we do not
perform our part of the agreement.

<span id="v.i-p8"></span> “This some understand only of temporal life
and prosperity in this world, *Origen*, *Tostat*. *Oleaster*,
*Vatablus*; and make this to be the meaning, — that, as the
transgressors of the Law were to die, so they which kept it should
preserve their life, Thom. Aquin. 1. 2. q. 100, a. 12; but I prefer
rather *Hesychius*’ judgment, — *Per* *quas* *oeterna* *vita*
*hominibus* *datur*,” etc. — Willet Hexapla, *in* *loco*. There appears
to be unusual discrepancy on this point between the commentators,
whether Romanist or Protestant. Bush and Holden apply it to temporal
life. Bonar says, “If, as most think, we are to take, in this place, the
words ‘live in them,’ as meaning ‘eternal life to be got by them,’ the
scope of the passage is, that so excellent are God’s laws, and every
special minute detail of these laws, *that* *if* *a* *man* *were* *to*
*keep* *these* *always* *and* *perfectly*, the very keeping would be
eternal life to him. And the quotations in <span
id="v.i-p8.1"></span>[Ro 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005)<span
id="v.i-p8.1"></span>, and <span id="v.i-p8.2"></span>[Ga
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#012)<span id="v.i-p8.2"></span>, would
seem to determine this to be the true and only sense here.” *C*.’*s*
view appears to be confirmed by our Lord’s reply in <span
id="v.i-p8.3"></span>[Mt 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017)<span
id="v.i-p8.3"></span>, referred to in Poole’s Synopsis.
