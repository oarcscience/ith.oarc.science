*And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require?* After having
expounded each Commandment in its order, it now remains for us to see
what is the sum of the contents of the Law, and what the aim and object
of its instructions. For Paul elicits its true use, when he declares
that its end is

<span id="iii.i-p14"></span>“charity, out of a pure heart and of a good
conscience, and of faith unfeigned,” (<span id="iii.i-p14.1"></span>[1Ti
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005)<span id="iii.i-p14.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="iii.i-p15"></span>since even then it had its false
interpreters, who, he says, had “turned aside unto vain jangling,” when
they swerved from that object. Now, as it is contained in two Tables, so
also Moses reduces it to two heads, that we should love God with all our
heart, and our neighbor as ourselves; for, although he does not unite
the two in one passage, yet Christ, by whose Spirit he spoke, ought to
suffice to explain to us his intention, (<span
id="iii.i-p15.1"></span>[Mt 22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037.md)<span
id="iii.i-p15.1"></span>;) for, when He was asked what was the great
Commandment of the Law, He replied that the first indeed was, that God
should be loved, and the second like unto it, regarding the love of our
neighbor; as if He had said, that the whole perfection of righteousness,
which is set before us in the Law, consists of two parts, that we should
serve God with true piety, and conduct ourselves innocently towards men
according to the rule of charity. The same is the sense of Paul’s words,
for the faith, which is there called the source and origin of charity,
comprehends in it the love of God. At any rate, the declaration of
Christ stands sure, that nothing is required of us by the Law, but that
we should love God, together with our neighbors. From hence a short and
clear definition may be laid down, that nothing is required unto a good
life except piety and justice.  <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md)

<span id="iii.i-p17"></span>Paul, indeed, seems to add a third clause,
when he says, that

<span id="iii.i-p18"></span>“the grace of God hath appeared, teaching us
that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
righteously, and godly, in this present world,” (<span
id="iii.i-p18.1"></span>Titus 2:11, 12;)

<span id="iii.i-p19"></span><span id="iii.i-p19.1"></span>but this <span
id="iii.i-p19.2"></span>σωφροσύνη<span id="iii.i-p19.3"></span>,
(soberness,) is there added as the seasoning, so to speak, of a just and
pious life; and assuredly no one will prove that he aims at holiness and
integrity, unless by living chastely, honestly, and temperately. Thus,
where the service of God is omitted,  <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) <span id="iii.i-p20.1"></span> and the
doctrine of the Law confined to the love of our neighbor alone, it is
not so much that religion is put out of sight  <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) <span id="iii.i-p21.1"></span>
(*sepelitur*<span id="iii.i-p21.2"></span>,) as that the proof of it is
made to rest on serious self-examination; for since it is the way with
hypocrites to cover themselves with ceremonies as with a mask of
sanctity, whilst they are puffed up with pride, burn with avarice and
rapacity, are full of envy and malice, breathe out threatenings and
cruelty, and are abandoned to filthy lusts, Christ, in order to disperse
these clouds of pretense, declares that the three chief points in the
Law are “judgment, mercy,” and fidelity,  <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) <span id="iii.i-p22.2"></span> (<span
id="iii.i-p22.3"></span>[Mt 23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md)<span
id="iii.i-p22.3"></span><span id="iii.i-p22.4"></span>;) and elsewhere,
discoursing of the righteousness of the Law, He makes no mention of the
First Table. (<span id="iii.i-p22.5"></span>[Mt
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.i-p22.5"></span><span id="iii.i-p22.6"></span>.)

<span id="iii.i-p23"></span>For the same reason, Paul calls charity the
fulfillment of the Law, (<span id="iii.i-p23.1"></span>[Ro
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008)<span id="iii.i-p23.1"></span>,.md)
and elsewhere, “the bond of perfectness.” (<span
id="iii.i-p23.2"></span>[Col 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.i-p23.2"></span>.) Still, nothing was further from their
intention than to draw us away from the fear of God, that we might
devote ourselves to our duties towards men, as I have already shown from
another passage, where Christ, in summing up the Law, begins with the
love of God. And Paul, where he teaches that we should be altogether
perfect, if faith works in us by love, (<span
id="iii.i-p23.3"></span>[Ga 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.i-p23.3"></span>,) does not omit the cause and principle of a
good life. And thus are reconciled the passages which else might appear
contradictory, via, that holiness is perfected in the fear of the Lord,
when

<span id="iii.i-p24"></span>“we cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of
the flesh and spirit,” (<span id="iii.i-p24.1"></span>[2Co
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001)<span id="iii.i-p24.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="iii.i-p25"></span>and

<span id="iii.i-p26"></span>“all the law is fulfilled in one word, even
in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,” (<span
id="iii.i-p26.1"></span>[Ga 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.i-p26.1"></span>;)

<span id="iii.i-p27"></span>that is to say, because our piety cannot
otherwise make itself clear by certain proof, unless we behave justly
and harmlessly towards men.  <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md)
Again, since “our goodness extendeth not to” God, so it is perceived
what our mind is by our performance of the duties of the Second Table,
as it is said in the Psalm,

<span id="iii.i-p29"></span>“my goodness extendeth not to thee, but to
the saints that are in the earth, in whom is all my delight,”  <span
id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) (<span id="iii.i-p30.1"></span>[Ps.
16:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#003)<span id="iii.i-p30.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="iii.i-p31"></span>for how will any one boast, (as John says,)
that he loves God, whom he does not see, if he loveth not his brother
with whom he is familiarly united? (<span id="iii.i-p31.1"></span>[1Jo
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#020)<span id="iii.i-p31.1"></span>..md)
Since, therefore, falsehood is thus detected, God exercises us in piety
by mutual charity; and hence John concludes, that

<span id="iii.i-p32"></span>“this Commandment have we from him, That he
who loveth God love his brother also.” (<span
id="iii.i-p32.1"></span>[1Jo 4:21](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.i-p32.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.i-p33"></span>Before, however, I say any more of these two
precepts, we must observe the end of the Law as it is described by
Moses; “Now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to
fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to
serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul?” For,
although he further eulogizes the Law, because it prescribes nothing
which nature does not itself dictate to be most certain and most just,
and which experience itself does not shew us to be more profitable, or
more desirable than anything else, still, at the same time, he reminds
us what is the means by which it is to be kept.  <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) Therefore he sets before us at the
same time the fear and the love of God; for, inasmuch as God is the
Lord, He justly desires to be feared in right of His dominion; and,
inasmuch as He is our Father, He requires to be loved, as it is said in
<span id="iii.i-p34.1"></span>[Mal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006.md)<span id="iii.i-p34.1"></span>. Let
us learn, therefore, if we would set ourselves about keeping the Law,
that we must begin with the fear of God, which is hence called the
“beginning of wisdom.” (<span id="iii.i-p34.2"></span>[Ps
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md)<span id="iii.i-p34.2"></span>;
<span id="iii.i-p34.3"></span>[Pr
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md)<span id="iii.i-p34.3"></span>, and
<span id="iii.i-p34.4"></span>[Pr
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#010)<span id="iii.i-p34.4"></span>..md)
But, since God has no pleasure in extorted and forced obedience, love is
immediately added. And this deserves to be well weighed, that whereas
there is nothing pleasanter than to love God, still it always occupies
the first place in all His service. Surely he must be more than
iron-hearted who is not attracted by such kindness; since, for no other
cause, does He invite and exhort us to love Him, than because He loveth
us; nay, He has already prevented us with His love, as is said in <span
id="iii.i-p34.5"></span>[1Jo 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.i-p34.5"></span>. Meanwhile, we may at the same time gather,
that nothing is pleasing to God which is offered “grudgingly or of
necessity; for God loveth a cheerful giver.” (<span
id="iii.i-p34.6"></span>[2Co 9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.i-p34.6"></span>.) It is true that Paul is there speaking of
alms-giving; but this voluntary and hearty inclination to obey, such as
we see in good and ingenuous children, who take delight in subjection to
their parents, ought to be extended to all the actions of our lives. And
assuredly the reverence which is paid to God flows from no other source
than the tasting of His paternal love towards us, whereby we are drawn
to love Him in return; as it is said in <span
id="iii.i-p34.7"></span>[Ps 130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.i-p34.7"></span>, “There is forgiveness with thee, that thou
mayest be feared.” Whenever, then, we hear what Scripture constantly
inculcates; “O love ye Jehovah,  <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md)
all ye his meek ones!” (<span id="iii.i-p35.1"></span>[Ps
31:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#023)<span id="iii.i-p35.1"></span>..md)
let us remember that God shews Himself loving towards us, in order that
we may willingly and with becoming cheerfulness acquiesce in what He
commands.

<span id="iii.i-p36"></span><span id="iii.i-p36.1"></span>The perfection
which is here required shews with sufficient clearness how far we are
from a thorough obedience to the Law. We are commanded to love God with
all our heart, and soul, and strength. However much we strive, our
efforts are weak and imperfect, unless the love of God has possession of
all our senses, and all our desires and thoughts are altogether devoted
to Him, whilst all our endeavors are also directed to Him alone. But
every one is abundantly convinced by his own experience, in how many
ways our minds are carried away to vanity; how many corrupt affections
creep over us; how difficult it is for us to restrain and overcome the
evil motions of our flesh. Surely the very best wrestler, with all his
strivings, is hardly able to make advances in this spiritual warfare;
and if it be a great attainment not to faint altogether, certainly none
will dare to boast that he comes near the mark which is set before us in
the Law. In short, whenever worldly snares and foolish appetites
insinuate themselves upon us, we must so often feel that some part of
our soul is empty of the love of God, since otherwise nothing repugnant
to it would penetrate there. The word *heart*<span
id="iii.i-p36.2"></span> here,  <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md)
<span id="iii.i-p37.12"></span> as elsewhere, is not used for the seat
of the affections, but for the intellect; and, therefore, it would have
been superfluous to add <span id="iii.i-p37.13"></span>διάνοιας<span
id="iii.i-p37.14"></span>, as the Evangelists have done, unless for the
purpose of removing all ambiguity; but because this signification was
not commonly in use among the Greeks, they have not hesitated to add a
word of their own in explanation. Those, however, who are well
acquainted with the teaching of Moses, are not ignorant that the word
*heart*<span id="iii.i-p37.15"></span> is equivalent to *mind*<span
id="iii.i-p37.16"></span>; for he elsewhere says, “The Lord hath not
given you *an* *heart* *to* *understand*<span id="iii.i-p37.17"></span>,
 <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) <span id="iii.i-p38.1"></span>
and eyes to see, unto this day,” (<span id="iii.i-p38.2"></span>[De
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.i-p38.2"></span><span id="iii.i-p38.3"></span>;) but the
expression would have been obscure to the Greeks, as being unusual in
their language.  <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md)
