<p class="TableText15"><a name="v.xi-p28"></A><b>22.</b> Et dicet generatio postera, filii vestri qui surgent post vos, et alienigena qui veniet e terra longinqua, quum viderint plagas terrae hujus, et morbos quibus aegrotare fecerit Jehova in ea:</p>

<p class="TableText15"><a name="v.xi-p33"></A><b>25.</b> Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="v.xi-p34"></A><b>25.</b> Et dicent, Eo quod dereliquerunt pactum Jehovae Dei patrum suorum, quod pepigit cum eis, quum educeret eos e terra Aegypti:</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="v.xi-p35"></A><b>26.</b> For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and <i>whom</i> he had not given unto them:</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.xi-p43"></A><b>10. </b><i>Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God</i>. Again does Moses, as God&#8217;s appointed   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">261</FONT></A>
 			  representative, sanction the doctrine proclaimed by him by a solemn adjuration. With this design he says that the Israelites stood there not only to hear the voice of God, but to enter into covenant with Him, in order that they might apply themselves seriously, and with becoming reverence, to perform the promise they had given. Nor does he only address their chiefs, but, after having begun with the officers, the elders, and men,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_261"><FONT SIZE="1">262</FONT></A>
 			  he descends to the little children and the wives, in order that they might understand that their whole race, from the least to the greatest, were bound to keep the Law: nay, he adds all the strangers, who had devoted themselves to the service of the God of Israel, and states particularly that the very porters and lacqueys   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">263</FONT></A>
 			  were included in the covenant, in order that the minds of those, who derive their origin from the holy Patriarchs, should be more solemnly impressed. Moreover, in order that they may accept the covenant with greater reverence, he says that it was established with an oath. Now, if perjury between man and man is detestable, much less pardonable is it to belie that which you have promised God by his sacred name. Finally, he requires that the covenant should be 			 reverenced, both on account of its advantages and its antiquity. Nothing was more advantageous for the Israelites than that they should be adopted by God as His people; this incomparable advantage, therefore, ought deservedly to render the covenant gratifying; and, besides the exceeding greatness of this blessing, God had prevented them by His grace many ages   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">264</FONT></A>
 			  before they were born.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="v.xi-p48"></A>It would have been, therefore, very disgraceful not to embrace eagerly and ardently so signal a pledge of his love. Nevertheless, the question here arises, how the little children could have passed into covenant, when they were not yet of a proper age to learn (its contents;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_264"><FONT SIZE="1">265</FONT></A>
 			 ) the reply is easy, that, although they did not receive by faith the promised salvation, nor, on the other hand, renounce the flesh so as to dedicate themselves to God, still they were bound to God by the same obligations under which their parents laid themselves; for, since the grace was common to all, it was fitting that their consent to testify their gratitude should also be universal; so that when the children had come to age, they should more cheerfully endeavor after holiness, 			 when they remembered that they had been already dedicated to God. For circumcision was a sign of their adoption from their mother&#8217;s womb; and therefore, although they were not yet possessed of faith or understanding, God had a paternal power over them, because He had conferred upon them so great an honor. Thus, now-a-days, infants are initiated into the service of God,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">266</FONT></A>
 			 whom they do not yet know, by baptism; because He marks them out as His own peculiar people, and claims them as His children when He ingrafts them into the body of Christ. Moses goes further, stating that their descendants were bound by the same covenant, as if already enthralled to God; and surely, since slavery passes on by inheritance, it ought not to appear absurd that the same right should be assigned to God which mortal men claim for themselves. What he says, then, is tantamount 			 to reminding the Israelites that they covenanted with God in the name of their offspring, so as to devote both themselves and those belonging to them to His service.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xi-p51"></A><a name="v.xi-p51.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.xi-p52"></A><b>16. </b><i>For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt</i>. We know how greatly men&#8217;s minds are tickled by novelty; and this might occur to the Israelites when, upon entering the land of Canaan, they would see many forms of idolatry hitherto unknown, which would be so many snares to entangle them. Although, therefore, they were not as yet 			 accustomed to such corruptions, he exhorts them to beware by former instances; for they were not ignorant that God had held in abomination the superstitions of Egypt, and also of other nations, which He had punished in terrible ways. Consequently Moses reminds them that there was no reason why the people should be carried away to imitate the rites of the Gentiles with which they were unacquainted, since they knew by extraordinary proofs that whatever imaginations had been invented by heathen 			 nations were hateful to God. This argument, then, is drawn from experience, whereby the Israelites had been abundantly admonished, that they should hereafter beware of all delusions. But, when he passes from individual men and women to families and tribes, he indicates that those who are associated with others in sin, seek to excuse themselves in vain by their numbers; since a whole nation is as much to be condemned as a single person.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.xi-p53"></A>The conclusion of verse 18, &#8220;<i>lest there should be among you a root</i>,&#8221; etc., seems to be tamely explained by some,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">267</FONT></A>
 			  lest there should be venomous men, who should bring forth bitter fruits to God; for by the word <i>root</i> I rather under stand the hidden principles of sins, which, unless they be prevented in good time, spring up with collected vigor and lift themselves on high; for indulgence in sin increases by concealment and connivance. And to this the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews seems to allude when he exhorts believers 			 lest, through their negligence, &#8220;any root of bitterness, springing up, trouble them, and thereby many be defiled.&#8221; (<a name="v.xi-p54.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#015">Heb 12:15</a><a name="v.xi-p54.1"></A>.) As soon, therefore, as any one should endeavor to excite his brethren to worship false gods, God commands him to be plucked up, lest the poison should burst forth, and the bitter root should produce its natural fruits in the corruption of others. 			 Wormwood   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">268</FONT></A>
 			  (<i>absinthium</i>) is here used, as often elsewhere, in a bad sense, on account of its unpleasant savour; unless perhaps it is some other herb, as is more probable.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.xi-p56"></A><a name="v.xi-p56.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.xi-p57"></A><b>19. </b><i>And it come to pass when he heareth the words</i>. He shews that it is not without reason that he has used so solemn and severe an adjuration; since nothing is more common than for men to flatter themselves, and by levity to evade the decision of God. He therefore repeats, that they are standing before God, who neither deceives, nor is 			 deceived, nor even allows Himself to be thought lightly of; in order that they may tremble at His threats. Let the majesty of God, he says, be dreaded by you; so that none who despises Him, and wantons in his own lusts, should promise himself impunity. &#8220;To bless himself in his heart,&#8221; is to hope in his secret imaginations that all will go well; as the hypocrites do, who, in their foolish self-adulation, applaud themselves deceitfully, lest they should hear God thundering.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">269</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.xi-p59"></A>From this passage, therefore, let us learn that nothing is worse than to hope for peace, whilst we wage war with God; and to promise ourselves that He will let us alone, when we provoke Him by the impetuosity of our lusts.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text21"><a name="v.xi-p60"></A><a name="v.xi-p60.1"></A>The conclusion of the verse, &#8220;to add the drunken to the thirsty,&#8221; is variously explained on account of its ambiguity.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">270</FONT></A>
 			 <a name="v.xi-p61.3"></A> I am ashamed to repeat the silly triflings of the Hebrew interpreters. To me it seems unquestionable that Moses, by a proverbial figure of speech, forbids us to excite the appetites of the flesh, already sufficiently heated, by new stimulants. As, therefore, they are said to add oil to the grate, who add more flames to a fire already lighted,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">271</FONT></A>
 			 <a name="v.xi-p62.1"></A> so they are said to add the drunken to the thirsty who seek provocatives of their audacity, in order to sin more freely; for lust in a man is like an insatiable dropsy; and if any one indulges in such intemperance, he adds the drunken to the thirsty, <i>i</i> <i>e</i><a name="v.xi-p62.2"></A>., the madness of his own folly to unrestrained desire. <a name="v.xi-p62.3"></A>&#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;<a name="v.xi-p62.4"></A>, <i>ravah</i><a name="v.xi-p62.5"></A>, however, is, in my opinion, used actively, as elsewhere. In <a name="v.xi-p62.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#005">Ps 23:5</a><a name="v.xi-p62.6"></A><a name="v.xi-p62.7"></A>, it is said, &#8220;My cup <a name="v.xi-p62.8"></A>&#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;<a name="v.xi-p62.9"></A>, <i>revayah</i><a name="v.xi-p62.10"></A>, runneth over;&#8221; and, 			 in like manner, in <a name="v.xi-p62.11"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012">Ps 66:12</a><a name="v.xi-p62.11"></A><a name="v.xi-p62.12"></A>, a well-watered land   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">272</FONT></A>
 			 <a name="v.xi-p63.2"></A> is expressed by the same word, because it abundantly moistens the corn and grass. It is very appropriate that the desires of the flesh, that we burn with, should be compared to thirst; and the licentious impetuosity, which carries us away without reflection, to drunkenness; because the sinner stupifies himself into forgetfulness of the distinction between good and evil. And thence Paul calls those who are plunged in brutal forgetfulness of God and themselves, 			 <a name="v.xi-p63.3"></A>&#7936;&#960;&#951;&#955;&#947;&#951;&#954;&#8057;&#964;&#949;&#962;<a name="v.xi-p63.4"></A> (past feeling.)

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text21"><a name="v.xi-p65"></A><b>20. </b><i>The Lord will not spare him</i><a name="v.xi-p65.1"></A>. Moses here teaches us that the obstinacy in which the wicked are willfully hardened, shuts against them the door of hope, so that they will find that God is not to be appeased. And assuredly it is the climax of all sins that a wretched man, who is abandoned to vice, should extinguish the light of his own 			 reason, and destroy the image of God within him, so as to degenerate into a beast: and not only so, but also that he should dethrone God, as if He were not the Judge of the world. And this is the insult which they put upon Him who abandon themselves to sin in the confident expectation of impunity.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">273</FONT></A>
 			 <a name="v.xi-p66.1"></A> Thus, by Isaiah, God swears that this was an inexpiable crime, that, when He called them to baldness and to mourning, the Israelites encouraged each other to gladness; and, whilst feasting luxuriously, said in ridicule, &#8220;Tomorrow we shall die.&#8221; (<a name="v.xi-p66.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012">Isa. 22:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013">13</a><a name="v.xi-p66.2"></A><a name="v.xi-p66.3"></A>.)

 			 <a name="v.xi-p67.8"></A> Meanwhile he contrasts God&#8217;s fixed purpose, &#8212; that He will not be willing to pardon, &#8212; with the depraved pleasures of those who take too much delight in their sins.

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.xi-p68"></A>Further, in order the better to express that God will be irreconcilable to such great perversity, he declares that He will exterminate from the earth those who have so wantonly exulted in iniquity; and finally adds, that He will give them up to be accursed (<i>in</i> <i>anathemata</i>,) so that they shall no longer hold a place among the people of Israel. Now, it is a much more grievous thing to be cut off from the elect people, and to be set 			 apart unto evil, as it is here said, than to be deprived of natural life.</p>

For the question which is here put is such 			 as refers to something extraordinary, and what is not easily comprehended. It is not, however, confined to the preceding clause, but refers to the whole list of curses; not as if each of them by itself had awakened such horror, but because, when heaped one upon another, they compelled all men to wonder, both on account of their number and their severity and duration, and thus were for a sign and a prodigy. For it everywhere occurs that men are afflicted with diseases, and barrenness for a 			 single season is a common evil; but that sicknesses should cleave as it were to the marrow of a whole people, and that the earth should be dried up as if it were burnt with sulphur, this is an awful spectacle, in which God&#8217;s vengeance, which else would be incredible, manifestly appears; and therefore the cases of Sodom and Gomorrah are adduced, in whose destruction it might be seen what end awaits all the reprobate.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">275</FONT></A>
 			  (<a name="v.xi-p71.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007">Jude 1:7</a><a name="v.xi-p71.1"></A>.) Now the Israelites always had their desolation before their eyes, from the time that they entered the land, in order that they might be warned by so terrible a judgment, and might tremble at it. It is also worthy of notice, that strangers are introduced making inquiry; in which words Moses signifies that this vengeance would be terrible even to heathen 			 nations; and with this corresponds what we read in Jeremiah; &#8220;many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this great city? Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.&#8221; (<a name="v.xi-p71.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#008">Jer. 22:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#009">9</a><a name="v.xi-p71.2"></A>.) A similar 			 divine menace is recorded in <a name="v.xi-p71.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#008">1 Kings 9:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#009">9</a><a name="v.xi-p71.3"></A>; &#8220;And at this house,&#8221; referring to the Temple brought to desolation, &#8220;every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the Lord done thus to this house? And they shall answer, Because they forsook the Lord their God, and have taken hold upon other gods,&#8221; etc. What we find further on 			 is still more fearful; &#8220;Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.&#8221; (<a name="v.xi-p71.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#012">2Ki 21:12</a><a name="v.xi-p71.4"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="v.xi-p72"></A>Moses amplifies the crime of their rebellion, when he says, that forsaking the God of their fathers, God their deliverer, God who had made a covenant with them, they had gone and served strange and unknown gods, from  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">276</FONT></A>
 			 whom they had received no benefits to induce them. For God had bound them to Himself for ever, both by His instruction  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">277</FONT></A>
 			 and the incomparable manifestation of His power; there could therefore be no pretense of ignorance, or mistake to excuse their defection from Him, and their prostitution of themselves to unknown idols.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.xi-p75"></A>In the meantime, let us learn from this passage anxiously to inquire who is the true God, and what is His will; because there is no true religion without knowledge; and again, if He convicted His ancient people of wicked ingratitude on account of their deliverance, that we also are now much more inexcusable, unless we constantly abide in the faith of our eternal Redeemer.</p>
