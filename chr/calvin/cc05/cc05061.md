10, 11

<span id="vii.ii-p3"></span>**1.** At that time the Lord said unto me,
Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me
into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.

<span id="vii.ii-p4"></span>**1.** In tempore illo dixit mihi Jehova,
Dola tibi duns tabulas lapideas similes prioribus, et ascende ad me in
montem, et fac tibi arcata ligneam.

<span id="vii.ii-p5"></span>**2.** And I will write on the tables the
words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt
put them in the ark.

<span id="vii.ii-p6"></span>**2.** Et scribam in tabulis verba quae
erant in tabulis prioribus, quas fregisti, et pones eas in arca.

<span id="vii.ii-p7"></span>**3.** And I made an ark *of* shittim-wood,
and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the
mount, having the two tables in mine hand.

<span id="vii.ii-p8"></span>**3.** Feci igitur arcata e lignis sittim,
ac dolavi duas tabulas lapideas similes prioribus: ascendique in montem
habens duas tabulas in manu mea.

<span id="vii.ii-p9"></span>**4.** And he wrote on the tables, according
to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the Lord spake unto
you in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the
assembly: and the Lord gave them unto me.

<span id="vii.ii-p10"></span>**4.** Tunc scripsit in tabulis juxta
scripturam priorem decem verba quae loquutus fuerat Jehova vobiscum in
monte, e medio ignis, in die conventus: et dedit illas mihi Jehova.

<span id="vii.ii-p11"></span>**5.** And I turned myself, and came down
from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and
there they be, as the Lord commanded me.

<span id="vii.ii-p12"></span>**5.** Conversus autem descendi e monte:
posuique tabulas in arca quam feceram: et fuerunt illic, quemadmodum
praeceperat mihi Jehova.

<span id="vii.ii-p13"></span>**10.** And I stayed in the mount,
according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the Lord
hearkened unto me at that time also, *and* the Lord would not destroy
thee.

<span id="vii.ii-p14"></span>**10.** Ego autem steti in monte secundum
dies priores, quadraginta dies, et quadraginta noctes: et ex-audivit me
Jehova etiam hac vice, nec voluit Jehova perdere te.

<span id="vii.ii-p15"></span>**11.** And the Lord said unto me, Arise,
take *thy* journey before the people, that they may go in and possess
the land which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.

<span id="vii.ii-p16"></span>**11.** Itaque dixit mihi Jehova, Surge,
vade, proficiscendo ante populum ut ingrediantur et possideant terram
quam juravi patribus eorum me daturum illis.

<span id="vii.ii-p17"></span> 

<span id="vii.ii-p18"></span><span id="vii.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p19"></span>**1.** *At that time the Lord said unto me*
He had had intercourse with the people for some time, before he returned
into the mount with the second tables; and therefore he now begins to
relate more fully what he had already mentioned in the inverted order of
time, *i.e.,* that he stayed in the mount forty days to make entreaty
for them. And this also the repetition in the 10th verse more clearly
demonstrates, where he says, that he stayed in the mount “according
 <span id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392) to the first days.” But,
although he there says that he was hearkened to when he interceded in
the mount, still he includes the prayers which he had previously offered
when he heard of the people’s revolt, and after he had broken the tables
and taken away God’s tabernacle, in which he prayed apart to obtain
pardon for their sin. What is also here said respecting the ark is not
in its proper place; for it was a part of the tabernacle, as we have
elsewhere seen. It is, therefore, exacting too much to require that the
things which are related together, should be referred to the same
instant of time.
