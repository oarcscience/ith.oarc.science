<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.ii.iv.i-p23"></A><b>1. </b><i>If</i> <i>one</i> <i>be</i> <i>found</i> <i>slain</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>land</i>. This Supplement: is of a mixed character, relating partly to the civil, and partly to the criminal law. We are 				  informed by it how precious to God is the life of man; for, if a murder had been committed by some unknown person, He requires an expiation to be made, whereby the neighboring cities should purge themselves from the pollution of the crime. Whence it appears that the earth is so polluted by human blood, that those who encourage murder by impunity, implicate themselves in the guilt. The question here is as to a secret crime, the guilt of which attaches to the neighboring cities, until, by the 				  institution of a diligent inquiry, they can testify that the author is not discovered; how much less excusable, then, will they be, if they allow a murderer to escape with impunity? The rite prescribed is, that the elders of the nearest city should take a heifer which had not drawn in a yoke, and bring it into a stony and barren valley, cut off its neck with the assistance of the priests, wash their hands, and bear witness that their hands as well as their eyes are pure, as not being cognizant 				  of the criminal. God chose a heifer that had not born a yoke, in order that the satisfaction made by innocent blood might be represented in a more lively manner; whilst it was to be killed in a desert place, that the pollution might be removed from the cultivated lands. For, if the blood of the heifer had been shed in the middle of the market-place of the city, or in any inhabited spot, the familiarity with the sight of blood would have hardened their minds in inhumanity. For the purpose, 				  therefore, of awakening horror, it was drawn out into a solitary and uncultivated spot, that they might be thus accustomed to detest cruelty. But although, properly speaking, this was not a sacrifice which could be offered nowhere except in the sanctuary, still it nearly approached to the nature of a sacrifice, because the Levites were in attendance, and a solemn deprecation was made; nevertheless, they were not only employed as ministers of the altar, but also as judges, for their office is 				  expressed in the words, that they were &#8220;chosen to minister to God, to bless the people, and to pronounce sentence as to every stroke.&#8221;</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.ii.iv.i-p25"></A><b>6. </b><i>And</i> <i>all</i> <i>the</i> <i>elders</i> <i>of</i> <i>that</i> <i>city</i>. The washing of their hands had the effect of stirring them up the more, so that they should not inconsiderately protest in that solemn rite that they were pure and guiltless; for it was just as if they had presented 				  the corpse of the dead mall before God, and had stood themselves opposite to it to purge away the crime. At the same time, also, they ask for pardon, because it might have been through their carelessness that the man was smitten; and again, since, by the sacrilege of Achan alone the whole people were contaminated, it was to be feared lest the vengeance of God should extend more widely on account of the offense committed. And thus they were again taught how greatly God abominates murders, when 				  the people pray that they may be pardoned for the crime of another, as if, by the very looking upon it, they had contracted guilt. God at length declares that He will not impute it to them, when they have duly performed this rite of expiation; not because the heifer was the price of satisfaction to propitiate God, but because in this way they humbly reconciled themselves to Him, and shut the door against murders for the time to come. On this account it is said &#8212; &#8220;Thou shalt put away the blood 				  from among you;&#8221; for if the murder be passed over without observation, there remains a blot upon the people, and the earth itself, in a manner, stinks before God.</p>  <a name="ii.ii.iv.ii"></A>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.ii.iv.ii-p34"></A><b><a name="ii.ii.iv.ii-p34.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#015">Deuteronomy 12:15</a><a name="ii.ii.iv.ii-p34.1"></A>.</b> <i>Notwithstanding</i> <i>thou</i> <i>mayest</i> <i>kill</i>. What precedes I have introduced in its proper place, viz., that they should not kill the sacrifices anywhere but in the sanctuary, of which there was only one in Judea. Here the permission to eat meat is given, provided that they do not offer the animals to God, but eat of them as of wild beasts. By way of example, two kinds are mentioned, the roe-buck and the hart, of which no offering was made. They are, 				  therefore, freely allowed to eat meat wheresoever they pleased, with this exception, that they should not taste the blood; for, although this was observed by their forefathers before the giving of the Law, God ratifies it anew when He would gather a peculiar people to Himself. We know that immediately after the deluge, Noah and his posterity were commanded to abstain from blood; but, inasmuch as the greater part of mankind soon degenerated, it is probable that all nations neglected God&#8217;s 				  command, and permitted to themselves a universal license on this point; and it is even questionable whether this observance, which was everywhere fallen into desuetude, prevailed among the family of Shem. Certainly it may be conjectured from the renewed promulgation of the law, that it was altogether obsolete; at any rate, God would have His chosen people distinguished by this mark of separation from heathen nations.</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="ii.ii.iv.ii-p35"></A>The reason of the prohibition which is now mentioned had already been declared,  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>
 				  viz., because the blood is the seat of life. But although it, was allowable to kill an animal for food, yet, was it a useful restraint to prevent inhumanity, that they should not touch the blood; for if they abstained from the blood of beasts, much more necessary was it to spare human blood. After God, therefore, has forbidden blood to be eaten, He immediately proceeds to speak of men themselves: &#8220;Whose sheddeth man&#8217;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God 				  made he man.&#8221;  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A>
 				  (<a name="ii.ii.iv.ii-p37.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#004">Ge 9:4-6</a><a name="ii.ii.iv.ii-p37.1"></A>.) Hence I have deemed it appropriate to annex all the passages in which God commands the people to abstain from blood, to the Sixth Commandment. In itself, indeed, the eating of blood was a thing of no great importance: since, therefore, God so often inculcates a point of so little weight, it may be inferred that the law has some further object. To this may be added the severity 				  of the punishment, for surely it was not a crime worthy of death to taste the blood of some little bird; and hence, also, it is manifested that the prohibition had another meaning, viz., that cruelty might be abhorred. And the words of Moses show that the eating of blood is not forbidden because it infected man with its uncleanness, but that they might account the life of man to be precious; for it is said, &#8220;the blood is the life,&#8221; which, in the opinion of Augustine,  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A>
 				  is equivalent to its being &#8220;the sign of life;&#8220; but Moses rather means that animal life is contained in the blood. Wherefore, blood, which represents the life, was not interdicted without reason, nor was it only sinful to eat the blood by itself, but also together with the flesh, as is expressly declared both in Deuteronomy and in the last passage from Leviticus.</p>

 				   <i>sure</i> <i>that</i> <i>thou</i> <i>eat</i> <i>not</i>. It is not without cause that he earnestly exhorts them to inflexible firmness, because it was both a matter trifling in appearance, and its observation troublesome, whilst it was easy to decline from it on account of the universal example of the Gentiles. For if they considered within themselves that it contributed not to holiness that they should not touch blood, hence a snare to indulgence might easily have arisen.</p>  <a name="ii.ii.iv.iii"></A>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="ii.ii.iv.iii-p15"></A><b>10. </b><i>And</i> <i>whatsoever</i> <i>make</i> <i>there</i> 				  <i>be</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>house</i> <i>of</i> <i>Israel</i>. God here not only condemns to death whosoever shall have polluted themselves by eating of blood, but declares that He will Himself take vengeance on them, though they may escape from the hands of the judges; for He not only prescribes to the judges what it is right for them to do, but asserts for Himself the office of inflicting the punishment. For, if we consider the intention 				  of the Law, is there anything to surprise us in this; for although it be not consistent that the blood of a brute should be compensated for by the death of a man, still we must remember that this mode of instruction   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A>
 				   was necessary for a rude people, lest they should speedily lapse into barbarism. But, lest they should complain that no use remained for the blood, He reminds them that since it was given for atonement, they would be very ungrateful if they were not content with so great a blessing; and surely, since it was the price they were to pay for appeasing God, this was an employment of it far to be preferred to food. If, then, they desired to <i>exchange</i> into ordinary food the blood, which was destined to the altar for the <i>reconciliation</i> of God, Moses indirectly reproves their ingratitude; for when God took away the right of eating it, He left them something better, which should have abundantly satisfied them. But we have elsewhere 				    				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A>
 				   seen in what manner blood atones for souls, <i>i</i> <i>e</i>., in a sacramental manner, upon which it must be observed that what properly belongs to Christ is thus transferred by <i>metonomy</i> to figures and symbols, yet in such a way that the similitude should neither be empty nor inefficacious; for in so 				  far as the fathers apprehended Christ in the external <i>sacrifices</i>, atonement was truly exhibited in them. In this passage also, I do not understand &#8220;the strangers&#8221; to be all such visitors as may have journeyed amongst them on matters of business, but those who had devoted themselves to the worship of God; for many foreigners, abandoning their superstitions, were circumcised, and it behooved that such as these should be expressly laid under the 				  bonds of the Law, lest, if it had not referred to them, they should have withdrawn themselves from obeying it. This point must, therefore, be briefly adverted to, lest we should suppose that heathen sojourners were prohibited from the eating of blood, whereas they were allowed to buy for food   				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A>
 				   even flesh that had been torn by beasts.</p>  				
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="ii.ii.iv.iii-p19"></A>Since, however, the Patriarchs before the Law had abstained from blood, and its prohibition had no reference to the First Table or the legal service, hence it came to pass that when the Apostles abrogated the ceremonial law, they did not dare to allow immediately the free eating of blood, lest great scandal should arise from this new and unwonted thing. (<a name="ii.ii.iv.iii-p19.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020">Ac 15:20</a><a name="ii.ii.iv.iii-p19.1"></A>.) Wherefore, lest so trifling a matter should cause deadly schisms in the Churches, they commanded the Gentiles not to eat of blood; adding as the reason, that those who were accustomed to read the writings of Moses, would be disturbed at this innovation; yet this was only observed for a short period, as we gather from Paul.  				  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A>
 				  It was, not without superstition and misplaced zeal;. retained by some even to the days of Tertullian.</p>

In <i>C</i>.&#8217;<i>s</i> Commentary on the Acts, 15:28, he says, &#8220;We know that this law was foredone by Paul, so soon as the tumult and contention was once ended, when he teacheth that nothing is unclean, (<a name="ii.ii.iv.iii-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014">Ro 14:14</a><a name="ii.ii.iv.iii-p20.1"></A>,)and when he granteth liberty to eat all manner of meats, yea, even such as were sacrificed to idols.

Tertullian, <i>Apol</i>., <i>cap</i>. 						9, speaks as follows; &#8220;Erubescat error vester Christianis, qui ne animalium quidem sanguinem in epulis esculentas habemus, qui propterea quoque suffocatis et morticinis abstinemus, ne quo modo sanguine contaminemur, vel intra viscera sepulto.&#8221; See Bingham, book 17 ch. 5 sec. 20 &#8220;But on the other hand, because it was the custom of the Catholic Church, almost to the time of St. Austin, to abstain from eating of blood, in compliance with the rule given by the Apostles to the Gentile converts; 						therefore, by the most ancient laws of the Church, all clergymen were obliged to abstain from it under pain of degradation. This is evident from the Apostolical Canons, and those of Gangra, and the second Council of Orleans, and the Council of Trullo. But as this was looked upon by some only as a temporary injunction, so it appears from St. Austin that it was of no force in the African Church. (Contra Faust., lib. 32, c. 13.) He that would see more about it may consult Curcellaeus, who has 						written a large dissertation upon the subject.&#8221;</p> 				  </P>
