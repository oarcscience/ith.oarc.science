<span id="vii.vi-p3"></span>**1.** And it came to pass on the eighth
day, *that* Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;

<span id="vii.vi-p4"></span>**1.** Factum est die octavo, ut vocaret
Moses Aharon, et filius ejus, et seniores Israel.

<span id="vii.vi-p5"></span>**2.** And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a
young calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without
blemish, and offer *them* before the Lord.

<span id="vii.vi-p6"></span>**2.** Dixitque ad Aharon, Tolle tibi
vitulum filium bovis in sacrificium pro peccato, et arietem in
holocaustum, integros, et offer coram Jehova.

<span id="vii.vi-p7"></span>**3.** And unto the children of Israel thou
shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin-offering; and
a calf and a lamb, *both* of the first year, without blemish, for a
burnt-offering;

<span id="vii.vi-p8"></span>**3.** Ad filius vero Israel loqueris,
dicendo, Tollite hircum caprarum in sacrificium pro peccato, et vitulum,
et agnum, anniculos immaculatos in holocaustum.

<span id="vii.vi-p9"></span>**4.** Also a bullock and a ram for
peace-offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord; and a meat-offering
mingled with oil: for to-day the Lord will appear unto you.

<span id="vii.vi-p10"></span>**4.** Bovem quoque et arietem pro
sacrificio prosperitatum, ut sacrificetis coram Jehova, ct minham
conspersam oleo: quia hodie Jehova apparebit vobis.

<span id="vii.vi-p11"></span>**5.** And they brought *that* which Moses
commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation; and all the
congregation drew near, and stood before the Lord.

<span id="vii.vi-p12"></span>**5.** Tulerunt ergo qum praeceperat Moses
coram tabernaculo conventionis, et accessit totus coetus, et steterunt
coram Jehova.

<span id="vii.vi-p13"></span>**6.** And Moses said, This *is* the thing
which the Lord commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the Lord
shall appear unto you.

<span id="vii.vi-p14"></span>**6.** Tunc dixit Moses, Hoc est verbum
quod praecepit Jehova, facite, et apparebit vobis gloria Jehovae.

<span id="vii.vi-p15"></span>**7.** And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto
the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make
an atonement for thyself, and the people: and offer the offering of the
people, and make an atonement for them; as the Lord commanded.

<span id="vii.vi-p16"></span>**7.** Ad Aharon vero dixit Moses, Accede
ad altare, et fac oblationem pro peccato tuo, et holocaustum tuum, et
expiationem fac pro te et pro populo: fac etiam oblationem populi, ire
expiationem pro eis, quemadmodum praecepit Jehova.

<span id="vii.vi-p17"></span>**8.** Aaron therefore went unto the altar,
and slew the calf of the sin-offering which *was* for himself.

<span id="vii.vi-p18"></span>**8.** Accessit itaque Aharon ad altare, et
mactavit vitulum suum, oblationem pro peccato.

<span id="vii.vi-p19"></span>**9.** And the sons of Aaron brought the
blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put *it* upon
the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the
altar:

<span id="vii.vi-p20"></span>**9.** Et obtulerunt filii Aharon ei
sanguinere, qui tinxit digitum suum in sanguine, et posuit super cornua
altaris, residuum veto sanguinem fudit ad basira altaris.

<span id="vii.vi-p21"></span>**10.** But the fat, and the kidneys, and
the caul above the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar;
as the Lord commanded Moses.

<span id="vii.vi-p22"></span>**10.** Adipem autem et renes, et fibram
jecoris hostiae pro peccato, adolevit super altare, quemadmodum
praeceperat Jehova Mosi.

<span id="vii.vi-p23"></span>**11.** And the flesh and the hide he burnt
with fire without the camp.

<span id="vii.vi-p24"></span>**11.** Camera vero et pellem igni
combussit extra castra.

<span id="vii.vi-p25"></span>**12.** And he slew the burnt-offering; and
Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round
about upon the altar.

<span id="vii.vi-p26"></span>**12.** Mactavit et hostiam pro holocausto,
et obtulernnt filii Aharon ei sanguinem, quem sparsit super altare per
circuitum:

<span id="vii.vi-p27"></span>**13.** And they presented the
burnt-offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head; and he
burnt *them* upon the altar.

<span id="vii.vi-p28"></span>**13.** Holocaustum quoque ei obtulerunt in
frustis suis, et caput: et adolevit super altare.

<span id="vii.vi-p29"></span>**14.** And he did wash the inwards and the
legs, and burnt *them* upon the burnt-offering on the altar.

<span id="vii.vi-p30"></span>**14.** Deinde layit intestina et erura, ei
adolevit cum holocausto super altare.

<span id="vii.vi-p31"></span>**15.** And he brought the people’s
offering, and took the goat, which *was* the sin-offering for the
people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.

<span id="vii.vi-p32"></span>**15.** Obtulit et oblationem populi,
tulitque hircum oblationis pro peccato qui erat populi: mactavitque eum,
et pro peccato obtulit ipsum sicut primum.

<span id="vii.vi-p33"></span>**16.** And he brought the burnt-offering,
and offered it according to the manner.

<span id="vii.vi-p34"></span>**16.** Obtulit quoque holocaustum, et
apparavit illud secundum praescripture.

<span id="vii.vi-p35"></span>**17.** And he brought the meat-offering,
and took an handful thereof, and burnt *it* upon the altar, beside the
burnt-sacrifice of the morning.

<span id="vii.vi-p36"></span>**17.** Obtulit et minham, implevitque
manum suam ex ipsa, et adolevit super altare, praeter holocaustum
matutinum.

<span id="vii.vi-p37"></span>**18.** He slew also the bullock and the
ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings which *was* for the people: and
Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the
altar round about,

<span id="vii.vi-p38"></span>**18.** Mactavit insuper bovera et arietem
in sacrificium pacificorum quod erat populi: et obtulerunt filii Aharon
sanguinem, quem sparsit super altare per circuitum.

<span id="vii.vi-p39"></span>**19.** And the fat of the bullock and of
the ram, the rump, and that which covereth *the* *inwards,* and the
kidneys, and the caul *above* the liver:

<span id="vii.vi-p40"></span>**19.** Et adipes bovis et arietis, caudam
et adipem qui operit intestina et renes, et fibram jecoris.

<span id="vii.vi-p41"></span>**20.** And they put the fat upon the
breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:

<span id="vii.vi-p42"></span>**20.** Posueruntque adipes super
pectuscula, et adolevit adipes super altare.

<span id="vii.vi-p43"></span>**21.** And the breasts and the right
shoulder Aaron waved *for* a wave-offering before the Lord; as Moses
commanded.

<span id="vii.vi-p44"></span>**21.** Pectuscula vero et armum dextrum
agitavit Aharon agitatione coram Jehova, quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova
Mosi.

<span id="vii.vi-p45"></span>**22.** And Aaron lifted up his hand toward
the people, and blessed them; and came down from offering of the
sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and peace-offerings.

<span id="vii.vi-p46"></span>**22.** Posthaec elevavit Aharon ma-num
suam ad populum, benedixitque eis, et descendit a faciendo oblationem
pro peccato, et holocaustum, et sacrificium prosperitatum.

<span id="vii.vi-p47"></span>**23.** And Moses and Aaron went into the
tabernacle of the congregation, and came *out,* and blessed the people:
and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people.

<span id="vii.vi-p48"></span>**23.** Et venit Moses et Aharon ad
tabernaculum conventionis, et egressi sunt, et benedixerunt populo: et
apparuit gloria Jehovae toti populo.

<span id="vii.vi-p49"></span>**24.** And there came a fire out from
before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the
fat: *which* when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their
faces.

<span id="vii.vi-p50"></span>**24.** Egressusque est ignis a facie
Jehovae, et consumpsit super altare holocaustum et adipes: quod videns
universus populus, laudaverunt, et ceciderunt super facies suas.

<span id="vii.vi-p51"></span> 

<span id="vii.vi-p52"></span><span id="vii.vi-p52.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p53"></span>**1.** *And it came to pass on the eighth
day* We have here related how Aaron and his sons, after the time of
their consecration was fulfilled, began to execute their office. It was
necessary that He should be his brother’s disciple, in order to follow
the pattern laid down by God. And we must bear in mind that Moses, who
was not appointed priest by a solemn rite, sanctified the others, in
order that the authority and the efficacy of the outward sign should
rest in God alone. This, therefore, is contained in the earlier portion
of the chapter, how, after Aaron had been initiated in the priest’s
office for seven days, He commenced the work entrusted to him by God’s
command: the second part shews how the sacrifices were approved by a
divine miracle, in ratification of the priesthood which God had
instituted. But, first of all, He enumerates the ordinary kinds of
sacrifice, viz., for sin, the burnt-offering; and for thanksgiving, the
sacrifice with the meat-offering *(minha)* and the sprinkling: that in
every respect Aaron might be accounted the lawful priest of God.

<span id="vii.vi-p54"></span><span id="vii.vi-p54.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p55"></span>**6.** *And Moses said, This is the thing
which the Lord commanded* He seems, indeed, to address himself to the
whole people, to whom also the promise belonged; but in the word “do
ye,”  <span id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md) He specially speaks to the
sons of Aaron; and he promises what, at the end of the chapter, he will
state to have been fulfilled, that the glory of God should be manifested
in approbation of the priesthood, in order that they may set about their
duties more cheerfully. For this was no common aid to their faith and
assurance, that their office should be thus, as it were, sealed by God.

<span id="vii.vi-p57"></span><span id="vii.vi-p57.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p58"></span>**7.** *And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto
the altar* Here is repeated what was stated elsewhere, that the priest,
as being himself a sinner, must first make entreaty for himself, before
he propitiates God towards others. Hence the Apostle justly infers that
the legal priesthood was weak and merely typical. (<span
id="vii.vi-p58.1"></span>[Heb 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md)<span
id="vii.vi-p58.1"></span>.) For none can be a true peace-maker, except
he, who, in reliance on his perfect innocence, presents himself before
God to obtain pardon for others, and, being pure from every blemish,
requires no expiation for himself. All else to the end of the chapter I
pass over, because Moses only records how Aaron sacrificed according to
God’s command and the legal ritual.

<span id="vii.vi-p59"></span><span id="vii.vi-p59.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p60"></span>**22.** *And Aaron lifted up his hand
toward the people* This was a kind of application of the sacrifice, in
order that the people might know that God was reconciled to them through
the priest as their mediator and surety. The form of benediction  <span
id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) has been already expoundled; at
present let this one point suffice, that, when by the lifting up of
their hands the priests testified of God’s paternal favor to the people,
their commission was ratified and efficacious. Of this the sacred
history presents to us a memorable instance, where it records, that

<span id="vii.vi-p62"></span>“the priests and Levites blessed the
people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy
dwelling-place, even unto heaven.” (<span id="vii.vi-p62.1"></span>[2Ch
30:27](../../../bib/kjv/ch2030.htm#027)<span id="vii.vi-p62.1"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.vi-p63"></span>The fulfilment of this type was at length
manifested in Christ, who is not only the source and cause of blessing,
but publishes it by the Gospel with effectual results; for He came to
“preach peace to them which were afar off, and to them that were nigh,”
(<span id="vii.vi-p63.1"></span>[Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017)<span id="vii.vi-p63.1"></span>;.md)
and although He does not appear or speak in a visible form, yet we know
what He says, viz., that

<span id="vii.vi-p64"></span>“whatsoever His disciples shall bind on
earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever they shall loose on earth
shall be loosed in heaven.” (<span id="vii.vi-p64.1"></span>[Mt
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018)<span id="vii.vi-p64.1"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.vi-p65"></span><span id="vii.vi-p65.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p66"></span>**23.** *And Moses and Aaron went into the
tabernacle* This is a repetition of the same statement, except that what
had been said of Aaron only is now also ascribed to Moses, *i.e.,* that
he blessed the people, but for a different reason, for although he was
God’s prophet, yet Aaron, in right of his office, was the only mediator.
What follows, “the glory of the Lord appeared,” may be read separately,
viz., that the majesty of God was manifested in some conspicuous sign;
or else it is connected with the concluding verse, where it is said,
that “there came a fire out from before the Lord, etc.” If we prefer the
latter, the account of the consuming of the sacrifice was added
expositively, as if it were said that God appeared when He sent forth
the fire to consume the sacrifice. By this auspice, or rather miracle,
God manifested that He was the Author of the legal priesthood, so that
it should be held in reverence for ever. The same thing sometimes
occurred afterwards, when in troubled circumstances, it had need of
extraordinary confirmation: thus fire consumed the sacrifice of Manoah,
(<span id="vii.vi-p66.1"></span>[Jud
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#020)<span id="vii.vi-p66.1"></span>;.md)
or, when God’s service and pure religion required to be vindicated in
opposition to superstitious counterfeits; thus the sacrifice of Elijah
was utterly consumed and reduced to ashes without the application of
fire. (<span id="vii.vi-p66.2"></span>[1Ki
18:38](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#038)<span id="vii.vi-p66.2"></span>..md)
Or, lastly, when God would shew that He delighted in Mount Sion, which
He had chosen for His resting-place and home: for which reason, the
first sacrifice of Solomon was consumed by fire from heaven. (<span
id="vii.vi-p66.3"></span>[2Ch 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#001.md)<span
id="vii.vi-p66.3"></span>.)

<span id="vii.vi-p67"></span>Lest posterity should doubt of this matter,
as if it were not thoroughly certain, Moses says that the whole people
was stirred up by the sight to praise God, “and fell on their faces.”
