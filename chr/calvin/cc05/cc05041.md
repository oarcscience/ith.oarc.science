<span id="v.vii-p3"></span>**28.** Observe and hear all these words
which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy
children after thee for ever, when thou does *that* *which* *is* good
and right in the sight of the Lord thy God.

<span id="v.vii-p4"></span>**28.** Custodi, et audi omnia verba ista
quae ego praecipio tibi, ut bene sit tibi et fillis tuis post te usque
in saeculum, quum feceris quod bonum est et rectum in oculis Jehovae Dei
tui.

<span id="v.vii-p7"></span>Here, again, God invites the obedience of the
people by the promise of reward; not that the hope of reward at all
avails in itself to arouse men, but because He would thus keep all under
the conviction of their just condemnation: for how will it help them to
answer that they are not sufficient to perform what God requires, when
it appears that they are thus wretched through their own fault? But, as
has been said before, it is profitable by indulgence to believers that
the reward of obedience should be promised them when they have kept the
Law, since their innumerable defects are not imputed to them. Still this
doctrine remains sure, that if men devote themselves to the keeping of
the Law, God, although He owes them nothing, will nevertheless
faithfully reward them.
