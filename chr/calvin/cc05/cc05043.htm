For this reason, He declares that they should be &#8220;cursed in the city and in the field,&#8221; <i>i</i> <i>e</i>., at home and abroad, in the house or out of the house; and again, that their 			 food should be cursed in the seed and in the meal.

He does not, therefore, merely declare that He will send the pestilence, but that He will cause it to cleave to them, and when it 			 shall have once laid hold of them, that it shall be impossible to remove it. It might also be translated, The Lord shall cause that the pestilence should seize thee; but with the same meaning, viz., that the pestilence should be fixed, or glued (<i>agglutinatam</i>) upon them, until it should consume them in the Holy Land itself. He adds <i>phthisis</i>, or consumption, which disease emaciates the body, and 			 gradually exhausts its juices. It is superfluous to speak particularly of the other diseases, only let us learn that, whilst the multitude of diseases is almost innumerable, they are all so many ministers (<i>satellites</i>) prepared to execute God&#8217;s vengeance. It is true, indeed, that diseases are contracted in various ways, and especially by intemperance; still, this does not prevent God from smiting the transgressors of the Law with them, although 			 no natural cause may be apparent.

To this refers what He now says, that the heavens shall be of brass, and the earth of iron, because neither shall the moisture descend from heaven to fertilize the earth, whilst the earth, bound up and hardened, shall have no juice or dampness in order to production. Whence we gather, that not even a drop of rain falls to the earth except distilled by God, and that whenever it rains, the earth is irrigated as 			 if by His hand. It must, however, be observed, as we have seen before, that the land of Canaan was not like Egypt, which was watered by the care and industry of man, but fertilized by the bounty of heaven. Thus God, by the Prophet, marks the degrees which are worthy of observation, viz., that when He is reconciled to His people, He will &#8220;hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; and the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil;&#8221; so that, finally, all these things shall hear 			 starving men.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">240</FONT></A>

We have previously seen that those who execute punishment on the transgressors of 			 the Law, are stirred up and armed by the just judgment of God; Moses does not now touch on that point, but merely declares that the enemies of the people should be their conquerors, should cruelly entreat them and pursue them in their flight. Moreover, in order that God&#8217;s judgment might be more conspicuous, He says, that when they have gone out to battle by one way, <i>i</i> <i>e</i>., with their army in 			 regular order, they should return by seven ways, because, in the confusion of their flight, they should be dispersed in all directions. Hence we gather that the bravery of men is in God&#8217;s power, so that He can make cowards of the boldest whenever He so pleases.

Wherefore, on the contrary, God deprives of burial those whom He curses. But as we have said that punishments affecting the body are common to the pious and the reprobate, so also we must think of being deprived of sepulture, since it sometimes happens that the reprobate are honorably buried, as Christ relates of the luxurious Dives, (<a name="v.ix-p135.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#022">Lu 16:22</a><a name="v.ix-p135.1"></A>,) whilst the bodies of the pious are ignominiously cast a prey for birds and beasts; as the Prophet complains in <a name="v.ix-p135.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002">Ps 79:2</a><a name="v.ix-p135.2"></A>.

Whether you understand this passage of the extraordinary plagues which God inflicted on the Egyptians at the time of His people&#8217;s deliverance, or of the ordinary diseases which had before prevailed among them, though the latter is more probable, still Moses signifies, that whilst the 			 Egyptians were smitten with these plagues, God&#8217;s people escaped them, in order that this distinction might more clearly represent His favor. For it could not happen naturally that in the same place the diseases, from which the Israelites were free, should afflict the Egyptians alone. God therefore threatens, that if they should despise His Law, He would deal with them as they had seen Him deal with heathen nations. And assuredly, since God then chose to multiply His people miraculously, it can 			 be by no means doubted but that He wonderfully privileged them by the bestowment of health and rigor. It is doubtful whether by diseases of the fundament He signifies hemorrhoids or <i>prolapsus</i>, or some other secret disease, such as that which attacked the Philistines when they captured the ark of the covenant.

He subjoins 			 other diseases, in which there appear special marks of God&#8217;s wrath; for although they sometimes affect the children of God also, still I have shewn elsewhere that the same punishments are so dealt out to them respectively, that they widely differ from each other. When Job was smitten with terrible ulcers, so as to become corrupt, he seemed for a time to present the marks of a reprobate person; but what in that holy man was an exercise of patience, is in the transgressors of the Law the just 			 reward of their crimes by the curse of God.</p>

 			  of giddiness and madness, to make them drunk with astonishment.

 			  the carnal sense is not greatly disturbed by this form of vengeance, still it is much more severe and awful than any bodily disease. The Poets imagined that wicked men were agitated and terrified by the furies, because experience taught them that it was not without a secret impulse from God that they became so senseless, when, their minds being affected, they were like beasts in the shape of men. Even heathens, then, perceived that when the wicked are given over to 			 a reprobate mind, God thus manifests Himself as the just Avenger of their crimes.

The same denunciation is extended to their houses and vineyards. It is grievous indeed to see the fruit of our labors seized on by our enemies before we have been permitted to enjoy them; since the frustration of our hope does not slightly increase our pain. He then passes on to their flocks and their herds: then to their children, and in their case heightens the calamity, in that their sons and their daughters 			 should be taken from them in their very sight, so that their eyes should fail with grief, and their hands, as if dead, should be unable to afford them assistance. For two reasons He says that the robbers, who shall strip them of everything, should be unknown to them; both because they might expect less consideration and kindness from strangers and barbarians than from neighbors; and also that the Jews might be alarmed by this threat, so as not to suppose that they only had to deal with 			 neighboring nations; inasmuch as it was in God&#8217;s power to fetch nations from afar.

But, since the offenses 			 of all are not alike, God also maintains a just proportion in the execution of His various punishments; thus, in this passage He does not speak only of common maladies, but of those whereby He openly shews His vengeance against the transgressors of the Law; of which sort are incurable diseases.</p>

For, on account of the great distance from them, the Jews would never have supposed that the 			 Assyrians and Chaldeans were God&#8217;s scourges, as they actually found them to be; because they placed no faith in the words of Moses. Much less credible was it to them that the king, whom they had appointed, should be dragged as a prisoner to distant countries. And surely this was a very sad and formidable punishment, since all their safety depended on the stability of their kingly government. Thus Jeremiah magnifies this evil above all others, that the Christ of God, who was the breath of the 			 Church, and under whose shadow they hoped to be everywhere safe, should be taken.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">246</FONT></A>

All aggravation of their captivity is also added, <i>i</i> <i>e</i>., that they should be oppressed by such tyranny as to be compelled to serve wood and stone. Dull and stupid as they were, still they ought to have retained their abomination of such gross wickedness. Hence it might be gathered that they would not be reduced to such a necessity except by the terrible vengeance of God. For although they had been attracted by the superstitions of the 			 Gentiles, so as eagerly to run after them, still, after they were deprived of the worship of God, and had undergone the yoke of the wretched and ungodly servitude which was imposed on them, the foulness of idolatry must have been more fully understood. There is also an antithesis implied in these words, viz., that because they had refused to submit themselves to the true God, and to obey His Law, they should become the slaves of idols.</p>

Again, there is an implied antithesis between the ignominy to which God condemns His ungrateful people, and the extraordinary dignity with which He had honored them, so that they should be illustrious before the whole world.

This is one of those portents which was mentioned a little while ago; for it is an act of ferocity detestable and more than tragical, that fathers and mothers should eat their own offspring, so great love of which is naturally implanted in every heart, that parents often forget 			 themselves in their anxiety for their children; and many have not hesitated to die to insure their safety. Nay, when the brute animals so carefully cherish their young, what can be more disgusting or abominable than that men should cease to care for their own blood? But this is the most monstrous of all atrocities, when fathers and mothers devour the offspring which they have procreated, and yet this threat by no means failed of its fulfillment, as we have elsewhere seen. We ought then to be 			 the more alarmed when we see that God thus terribly punished the sins of those whom He had deigned to choose for His own. Still, it was not without very just cause that this wrath was so greatly kindled against the Jews who had left no kind of iniquity undone, so that their wickedness was altogether intolerable. Never, then, must it be forgotten that those of the household of the Church to whom God&#8217;s truth is revealed, are on that account the less excusable, because they knowingly and willfully 			 provoke His wrath, whilst their continued perseverance in sin is altogether unworthy of pardon. The monstrous brutality of the act is heightened, when He says that men, in other respects tender and accustomed to delicacies, should be so savage through hunger that they shall refuse to give a share of this horrible food to their wives and surviving children; as also Jeremiah expressly says, the pitiful women shall be so maddened by hunger as to cook their own children.

What follows as to the after-birth is still more horrible, for thus they call the membrane by which the foetus is covered in the womb, with all its excrements.

Inasmuch as even believers, although they are disposed to a willing obedience to the Law, and earnestly apply themselves to it, are still impeded and withheld by the infirmity of their flesh from fulfilling their duty, care and attention is here demanded of them; for &#8220;to 			 observe (<i>custodire</i><a name="v.ix-p177.2"></A>) to do&#8221; is equivalent to giving sedulous and diligent heed. Now, God declares that, unless the Israelites thoroughly devote themselves to the keeping of the Law, vengeance is prepared for their neglect. It is indeed a harsh and severe threat whereby transgression in any respect is without remission; for perfect obedience is required by the words, &#8220;to do all the words that are written in the Law.&#8221; But it is necessary that we 			 should bear in mind what I have already shewn, that Moses was thus severe in his exactions, in order that the people, being convinced of their condemnation, should betake themselves to the mercy of God; for no one longs after Christ, unless he first abandons all confidence in his works, and rests all his hope of salvation in gratuitous pardon. The curse here recorded so awaits the transgressors of the Law, that, whilst God pardons His children, He at the same time sometimes chastises them, and 			 executes upon the reprobate the vengeance they deserve. The fountain-head of obedience is indicated when it is said, &#8220;that thou mayest fear the Lord;&#8221; for all virtues are but smoke, which do not spring from the fear of God. Moreover, in order that their contempt may be without excuse, God&#8217;s name is called &#8220;glorious and fearful;&#8221; for it is a mark of gross stupidity, when God&#8217;s majesty and glory are openly set before us, not to be affected with becoming reverence so as to humble ourselves before 			 Him. He, however, threatens something more terrible than before, when he says that the plagues shall be <i>wonderful</i><a name="v.ix-p177.3"></A> not only on the parents but on their children and descendants; instead of which some construe it,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">250</FONT></A>

He puts plagues and sicknesses in apposition with each other, as explaining by the latter of what nature the plagues shall be; unless, perhaps, it may be rather thought that the <i>species</i><a name="v.ix-p178.5"></A> is appended to the <i>genus</i><a name="v.ix-p178.6"></A>, which seems to be more probable.

He says, therefore, that the severity of God against unbelievers, of which they had been spectators, should fall upon their own heads, if they should be followers of their ungodliness; for it was natural that they should tremble at the judgments of God, whereof they had been 			 eye-witnesses; and not only so, but at which they had trembled for fear.</p>

But although it is only by a metaphor that God is said to rejoice in destroying the wicked, yet it is not without good reason that this expression is applied to him; that we may know that He can no more fail to be the defender of His Law, and the Avenger of its contempt, than deny Himself. He complains, indeed, by Isaiah, (<a name="v.ix-p187.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#024">Isa 10:24</a><a name="v.ix-p187.1"></A>) that He is 			 unwillingly forced to punish the Jews; but these two things are quite consistent, that He rejoices in His just judgment, and at the same time is mindful of His clemency and indulgence, so that He would rather pardon, if the wickedness of men would allow Him. But this expression of Moses, that God receives consolation from punishing the wicked, constantly occurs in the Prophets.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.ix-p189"></A><b>64. </b><i>And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people</i>. At the end of the preceding verse, he had threatened them with banishment, which was far more painful to the people of Israel than to other nations. Inasmuch as affection for our country is natural to all, it is disagreeable to be away from it; but the condition of the Israelitish 			 people was peculiar, for to them the inheritance of Canaan was promised them by God, and they could not be expelled from it without being renounced by their heavenly Father. But he now proceeds a second and third step further; for he adds to banishment a miserable scattering, and to scattering, trembling and wanderings full of disquietude. For, if they had been expelled all together into any one corner of the world, their banishment would have been more tolerarable from their very association 			 with each other. Their calamity is, therefore, augmented when the storm of God&#8217;s wrath scatters them hither and thither like chaff, so that they should be dispersed, and dwell in widely different countries. Another kind of servitude, which I have elsewhere noticed, is incidentally added, <i>i</i> <i>e</i>., that He would enslave them not only to men, but to idols also. The third step is their want of rest, for 			 there was to be no fixed abode for them in their captivity; and this is far the most wretched state of all, to serve tyrannical conquerors as captives, and to have no certain master. Still it was a most just reward of the people&#8217;s ingratitude, that they should nowhere find a fixed resting-place, because they had rejected the rest offered them by God, as we read in Isaiah (<a name="v.ix-p189.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#012">Isa 28:12</a><a name="v.ix-p189.1"></A>) He, 			 however, extends the evil, bitter as it was in itself, still further, for they were not only to be compelled to wander in confusion, and immediately to pass onwards, but, wheresoever they should come, inward perturbation of mind was to follow them as their inseparable companion. Now, it is more sad to be agitated within with secret fear, than to be oppressed by external violence; for believers, although they too may be unsettled and tossed by many troublesome waves, still repose with tranquil 			 minds on God; whilst the wicked, however they may desire to lull themselves in security, are nevertheless always without true peace; and if, for a while, they sink into lethargy, are still soon compelled to arouse themselves by God whether they will or not. Surely as the repose of a well-regulated mind is a signal mark of God&#8217;s favor, so a constant and irremediable fear, such as is here referred to, is one of His terrible punishments.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="v.ix-p190"></A>Since the fear of spiritual punishments but lightly affects ungodly men, Moses magnifies in many words what the Israelites would else have carelessly passed over. Especially he points out what dreadful torments of anxiety would affect the wicked, when he says that their life should hang in suspense, as it were, before their eyes, so that they should fear day and night. An amusing device is related of Dionysius,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="#fn_252"><FONT SIZE="1">253</FONT></A>
 			 who commanded an exquisite supper, supplied with every delicacy, to be prepared for a courtly flatterer by whom his happiness had been lauded; he placed him in his own seat, so  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="#fn_253"><FONT SIZE="1">254</FONT></A>
 			 that he might feast pleasantly, but ordered a sword to be suspended by a thread so as to overhang his head, insomuch that he who had pronounced the tyrant to be happy, when he saw that death was so near him every moment, did not dare to taste either of meat or drink. Dionysius, therefore, confessed, and not without shame to himself, that he and all other tyrants, whilst they are formidable to others, are tormented by perpetual fear. Now, this same disquietude is common to all the 			 despisers of God; for the more wantonly they rage in forgetfulness of His fear, the more deservedly they dread their own shadow. Besides, when we look around us and see by how many forms of death our lives are beset, it cannot be but that innumerable anxieties should naturally possess us; how, then, can the wicked help being harassed by miserable and perplexing doubts when they perceive themselves to be shut out from the protection of God, and exposed to so many evils? Tranquillity of mind, 			 therefore, can only arise from having God as our Keeper, and from resting under His protection.</p>

We know that the people were so driven about in the desert amidst divers perils, that they only escaped from it in safety by extraordinary miracles. It was therefore a thing most highly to be desired by their posterity, that they should never be carried back into those mighty 			 depths. He who had once rescued them from those deaths might indeed often be their deliverer; but in order to make His blessing at that time more memorable, He had provided that they should never return into that wilderness. To bring them back into it again, was, then, in a manner to blot out the grace of redemption. If any object that it was impossible that the people should be conveyed in ships through dry places, the reply is easy, that since mention is made of the captivity, there is no 			 absurdity in their being carried in ships and landed on the shore which   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_255"></A><A HREF="#fn_255"><FONT SIZE="1">256</FONT></A>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="v.ix-p197"></A> There appears to be some oversight here. The Latin is &#8220;littus, quod planitiem Moah respicit;&#8221; and the <i>Fr</i>. sufficiently removes any difficulty which the latter word would present, by simply translating it &#8220;pour les jetter en la plaine de Moab;&#8221; <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., to put them ashore <i>on</i> the plain of Moab. Now, the only shores of the plain of Moab would be formed by the Dead Sea, and this would, of course, be inapplicable in the 				  circumstances referred to. The very impossibility of crossing the desert in ships, clearly proves that the word <i>way</i> must not be understood as indicating the line of route. Thus Holden paraphrases the words: &#8220;Thou shalt be taken there in ships, and not by the way in which I appeared and spake to thee;&#8221; and Dathe&#8217;s translation is, &#8220;Navibus Jova vos deportari sinet in Aegyptum, quam terram nunquam a vobis revisendam dixerat.&#8221; The wonderful fulfillment of the prophecy is thus well summed up 				  by Dr. Kitto: &#8220;This was accomplished on several occasions. It is related both by Aristeas and Josephus, that in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, there were vast numbers of Hebrew slaves in Egypt, and that the king himself bought above 100,000 of them from their masters, and set them free. Egypt, indeed, was the great slave-mart of ancient times; and several of the conquerors and oppressors of the Jews sent at least a portion of their captives thither to be sold. Titus had 90,000 captives after 				  Jerusalem was taken. Those above seventeen years of age were sent to different parts of the Roman empire to labor on the public works, besides great numbers who perished in compulsory combats with wild beasts. Those under seventeen were doomed to be sold for slaves; but in such deep contempt and detestation was the nation held, that few were willing to buy them; and the Jews who remained at large, were too few and poor to be able to redeem their brethren. The market was also glutted with their 				  numbers, so that they were sold at a mere nominal price, &#8212; sometimes thirty for a small piece of money. Those who remained unpurchased were sent into confinement, where they perished by hundreds and by thousands together, from neglect and hunger. Egypt received a large proportion of these slaves, who were probably sent thither in <i>ships</i>, as the Romans had a fleet in the Mediterranean, and this was a much easier and safer way of transporting them than by land across the desert. The same 				  things precisely took place on the final desolation of Israel by Hadrian, who may be said to have consummated their doom by decreeing, with the concurrence of the Roman Senate, that no Jew should ever, on pain of death, enter the land of his fathers.&#8221; &#8212; Illust.
