<span id="vii.vii-p3"></span>**20.** And Moses, and Aaron, and all the
congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according
unto all that the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did
the children of Israel unto them.

<span id="vii.vii-p4"></span>**20.** Fecit itaque Moses et Aharon, et
omnis congregatio filiorum Israel, de Levitis: secundum crania quae
praeceperat Jehova Mosi de Levitis, sic feterunt illis filii Israel

<span id="vii.vii-p5"></span>**21.** And the Levites were purified, and
they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them *as* an offering
before the Lord; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.

<span id="vii.vii-p6"></span>**21.** Et purificaverunt sese Levitae,
laveruntque vestimenta sua et obtulit Aharon filius oblationem coram
Jehova, et expiavit eos Aharon, ut purificaret eos.

<span id="vii.vii-p7"></span>**22.** And after that went the Levites in
to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron,
and before his sons: as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the
Levites, so did they unto them.

<span id="vii.vii-p8"></span>**22.** His peractis aggressi sunt Levitae
fungi ministerio suo in tabernaculo conventionis coram Abaton, et coram
filiis ejus: quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova Mosi de Levitis, sic
fecerunt illis.

<span id="vii.vii-p11"></span>**20.** *And Moses, and Aaron, and all the
congregation* The Levites also are now inaugurated for the performance
of their duties, but in their proper order, because their condition was
inferior. Here it must be noted that the sons of Moses and their
descendants were placed in this lower rank, and excluded from all
expectation of the priesthood. Hence the ingratitude of the whole
people, and especially of the tribe of Levi, was all the more base, when
they presumptuously sought the honor from which Moses had shut out his
children for ever. It was then no ordinary act of obedience in him to
execute what God had appointed respecting the Levites. Aaron is here
mentioned, because he consecrated the Levites in right of his
priesthood. As regards the people, their consent is merely commended,
because they agreed to what was the pleasure of God. But this virtue in
them only increased their ignominy afterwards, when they sought to
overthrow that divine decree of which they had approved.

<span id="vii.vii-p12"></span><span id="vii.vii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p13"></span>**21.** *And the Levites were purified,
and they washed their clothes* We have already spoken of the washing,
for since it was required of all private individuals, much less would it
be allowable for the Levites to handle the sacred things, unless they
were first purified. But what follows as to their presentation by the
hands of Aaron, was a shadowing forth by symbol of the truth, which at
length shone out at the coming of Christ; for it had been of old
predicted by the Prophets, that, in the renovation of the Church, those
who had hitherto been but of the multitude should become Levites.
Therefore, by this figure, God would declare that none even of His elect
servants would be approved of and accepted by Him, unless sanctified by
the one Priest.  <span id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) And thence an
atonement is joined with their offering, in order that the Levites might
be pure.

<span id="vii.vii-p15"></span><span id="vii.vii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p16"></span>**22.** *And after that went the Levites
in to do their service* In these words Moses signifies that, in the
type, nothing was omitted relative to the ancient priesthood which
pertains to the legitimate service of God, the main point in which is
obedience, and thence the purity which flows from it. The Levites are
said to have done their service before Aaron, because they humbly
submitted themselves to the yoke, and allowed themselves to be
controlled by the will of the priest, since God had so enjoined. But the
progress of the history will presently shew how prone man’s nature is to
rebellion. Hence it arises that the end does not always correspond with
the beginning, but that sad and unhappy conclusions sometimes follow
successful commencements.
