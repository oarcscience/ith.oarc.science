<span id="ii.i.iii.i-p7"></span>Since this passage unquestionably
relates to the explanation of the Fifth Commandment, it confirms what I
have before shown, that the honor which God-commands to be paid to
parents, does not consist in reverence only, but also embraces
obedience. For the reverence which He now prescribes will render
children submissive and compliant. Now, then, we more clearly understand
how parents are to be honored, when God exhorts their children to beware
of offending them; for this is, in a word, the true manifestation of
filial piety, calmly to bear the yoke of subjection, and to prove by
acts a sincere desire to obey.
