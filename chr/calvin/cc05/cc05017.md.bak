<span id="ii.iii.iv.i-p7"></span>We learn from these passages that the
people were not only prohibited from adultery, but also from all sins
 <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) which are repugnant to the modesty
of nature itself. In order that all impurity may be the more detestable,
He enumerates two species of unnatural lust, from whence it is evident
that when men indulge themselves in this respect, they are carried away
by an impulse, which is more than beastly, to defile themselves by
shameful wickedness. The beasts are satisfied with natural connection;
it is therefore a gross enormity that this distinction should be
confounded by man endowed with reason; for what is the use of our
judgment and intelligent faculties if it be not that greater
self-restraint should exist in us than in the brute animals? It is
plain, therefore, that they must be blinded in a horrible manner who so
shamefully defile themselves, as Paul says. (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.i-p8.1"></span>[Ro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.i-p8.1"></span>.) The madness of lust has, however,
invented several monstrous vices, whose names it would be better to
bury, if God had not chosen that these shameful monuments should exist,
to inspire us with fear and horror. It has at length advanced to such
excesses, that men created in God’s image, both male and female, have
had connection with brutes.

18:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#024.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.i-p10.1"></span>.** *Defile not yourselves in any of these
things*. An old proverb  <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) says, that
good laws have sprung from evil habits; and God reminds us that for this
reason He has been induced expressly to advert to these disgusting and
wicked things; for the monstrosities which He mentions would have been
concealed in eternal silence had not necessity compelled Him to bring
them to light. But since the Canaanitish nations had advanced to such a
pitch of licentiousness, that the prodigious sins, which else would have
been better concealed, had been but too familiarly known from their
wicked habits, God warns His people to beware of their fatal examples.
First, when He says that these abominations prevailed amongst the
Gentiles, He indicates that evil habits by no means avail as an excuse;
nay, that public consent is in vain alleged in defense of vice. But the
better to deter them from imitating them, He sets before their eyes the
vengeance He is about to take. It is true, indeed, that the nations of
Canaan were destroyed for other reasons, but it is not without cause
that He sets forth this amongst the rest, for undoubtedly God was
offended by such pollutions.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.i-p12"></span><span id="ii.iii.iv.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv.i-p13"></span>**26.** *Ye shall therefore keep my
statutes* He here contrasts His Law with the abominations of the
Gentiles. The exhibition of His severity, which He had referred to,
might indeed have sufficed for the instruction of His people; but in
order to influence them more strongly, He at the same time adduces the
way pointed out to them in the Law, which would not suffer them to go
astray, if only they refused not to follow God. For that the Gentiles,
who were destitute of light, should have been drawn aside in every
direction was not surprising; but whilst they thus proved their
blindness, it behooved true believers, on the contrary, to testify that
they were not children of darkness, but of light. And to this Paul seems
to allude, when he exhorts believers not to walk, like the Gentiles, “in
the vanity of their mind.” (<span id="ii.iii.iv.i-p13.1"></span>[Eph
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.i-p13.1"></span>.) On this account God not only commends
to them His precepts and statutes, but also His ordinances
(*custodias*,) because He had omitted nothing in the Law which would be
useful for the direction of men’s lives. The sum is, that unless they
order themselves constantly by the doctrine which enlightens them, the
same destruction awaited them also which was about to overwhelm the
(Canaanitish) nations.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.ii-p11"></span>**13.** *If* *a* *man* *also*  <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) God had hitherto taught what was right,
in order to restrain the people from sin, not only from fear of
punishment, but for conscience’ sake. But whereas all do not voluntarily
dispose themselves to obedience, the awards severe punishments to those
wicked despisers in whom there is no effort to be religious. And it is
astonishing that almost all the Gentiles have so sunk into stupid and
brutal folly, that they have tolerated with little less than impunity
unnatural crimes, detestable in their very name.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.ii-p13"></span>I admit that even the wickedest of
them were ashamed to justify so gross a crime; but although it was
practiced with impunity, it was a common reproach to make even against
the very public tribunals, that it ought to be more severely punished
than other crimes, which they did not spare.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.ii-p14"></span>Both of the offending parties were
subjected to the same punishment, because it is a pollution which ought
by no means to be borne. Nay, if a man or woman offend with a beast, in
order that, all may the more abhor and beware of the unnatural crime,
the penalty is extended even to the harmless animal; as we have before
seen that a goring ox is condemned to death if it had killed a man.
Hence we infer how greatly displeasing to God is this kind of crime,
since its iniquity is confirmed by the death of guiltless animals.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p3"></span>**29.** Do not prostitute thy
daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom,
and the land become full of wickedness.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p4"></span>**29.** Non pollues filiam tuam

<span id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p6"></span><span id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p7"></span><span
id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p7.1"></span>This passage more clearly proves that all
unlicensed connections  <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p8.1"></span> were always unlawful in God’s sight. It
is a tame and forced interpretation to apply what is here said to
spiritual fornication; and those also, who suppose that public stews
only are forbidden, restrict the law too much, whereas God rather gives
a general injunction that parents should preserve their daughters by
means of a pure and chaste education. But even although we admit that
nothing else is prohibited but that parents should be the panders of
their daughters, still we gather from the word *pollute*  <span
id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) <span id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p9.1"></span>
(for some render the word <span id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p9.2"></span>חלל<span
id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p9.3"></span>, *chalal*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p9.4"></span>, too tamely to *make* *common*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.iii-p9.5"></span>) that they are contaminated by their
whoredom, and the reason given abundantly confirms the fact, that all
whoredom is hateful to God, “lest the land fall to whoredom, (He says,)
and the land become full of wickedness.” It is plain that adultery is
not in question here; but God declares it to be criminal if a man and
woman have connection out of wedlock. Consequently, the people are
taught in the Seventh Commandment to beware of all unchastity.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p7"></span><span
id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p7.1"></span>This passage is akin to the foregoing; for
in the first clause He forbids that girls should be prostituted. Some
think that a whore is called in Hebrew <span
id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p7.2"></span>קדשה<span id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p7.3"></span>,
*kedeshah*<span id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p7.4"></span>, because she is exposed
to, and *prepared*<span id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p7.5"></span> for sin;  <span
id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) <span id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.6"></span> but
her pollution, the opposite of sanctity, seems rather to be expressed by
*antiphrasis*<span id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.7"></span>. At any rate, a
precept of chastity is given, that it should not be lawful for unmarried
girls to have connection with men. In the second clause there is some
ambiguity, “There shall be no <span
id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.8"></span>קדש<span id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.9"></span>,
*kadesh*<span id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.10"></span>, of the sons of Israel;”
for in other passages it is clearly used for a catamite, or male harlot,
but there is no reason why it should not be rendered a fornicator. In
this sense the word seems to be used in the Book of Job: “The hypocrites
shall die in youth, (or in the flower of their age,) and their life is
among the <span id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.11"></span>קדשים<span
id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.12"></span>, *kedeshim*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.13"></span>,” which is equivalent to their being
infamous and shameful in life. (<span

id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.14"></span><span id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.15"></span>.)
But if it be preferred to apply it to sodomy, all impurity is condemned
by *synecdoche*

<span id="ii.iii.iv.v-p23"></span>**<span

22:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.v-p23.1"></span>.** *If* *a* *man* *be* *found* *lying*
*with*. A Political Supplement, whereby it appears how greatly God
abominates adultery, since He denounces capital punishment against it.
And assuredly, since marriage is a covenant consecrated by God, its
profanation is in no wise tolerable; and conjugal faith should be held
too sacred to be violated with impunity, whilst it is an act of horrible
perfidiousness to snatch from a man’s bosom the wife who is as his very
life, or at any rate half of himself. Wherefore, also, the Prophet
ignominiously compares adulterers to neighing horses, (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.v-p23.2"></span>[Jer
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.v-p23.2"></span>;) for where such lasciviousness prevails,
men degenerate, as it were, into beasts. Another reason is, however,
here referred to; for, if a man had broken faith with his wife by having
connection with a harlot, it was not a capital offense; but if any man,
though a bachelor, had committed adultery with the wife of another, (he
was to die,  <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67) .md) because both the
husband is grossly injured, and the dishonor descends to the offspring,
and all adulterine race is substituted in place of the legitimate one,
whilst the inheritance is transferred to strangers, and thus bastards
unlawfully possess themselves of the family name. This cause impelled
the Gentiles, even before the Law, to punish adultery with severity, as
clearly appears from the history of Judah and Tamar. (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.v-p24.1"></span>[Ge
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.v-p24.1"></span>.) Nay, by the universal law of the
Gentiles, the punishment of death was always awarded to adultery;
wherefore it is all the baser and more shameful in Christians not to
imitate at least the heathen. Adultery is punished no less severely by
the Julian law  <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md) than by that of
God; whilst those who boast themselves of the Christian name are so
tender and remiss, that they visit this execrable offense with a very
light reproof. And lest they should abrogate God’s law without a
pretext, they allege the example of Christ, who dismissed the woman
taken in adultery, whereas she ought to have been stoned; just as He
withdrew Himself into a mountain that He might not be made a king by the
multitude. (<span id="ii.iii.iv.v-p25.2"></span>[Joh
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.v-p25.2"></span>, and 6:15.) For if we consider what the
office was which the Father delegated to His only-begotten Son, we shall
not be surprised that He was content with the limits of His vocation,
and did not discharge the duties of a Judge. But those who have been
invested with the sword for the correction of crime, have absurdly
imitated His example, and thus their relaxation of the penalty has
flowed from gross ignorance.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.v-p26"></span>Although the disloyalty of husband and
wife are not punished alike by human tribunals, still, since they are
under mutual obligation to each other, God will take vengeance on them
both; and hence the declaration of Paul takes effect before the
judgment-seat of God, Let not married persons defraud one another; for
the wife hath not power of her own body, nor the husband of his. (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.v-p26.1"></span>[1 Cor.
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005.md)<span

<span id="ii.iii.iv.v-p27"></span><span id="ii.iii.iv.v-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv.v-p28"></span>**23.** *If a damsel that is a virgin
be betrothed*. The severity of the punishment is now extended further,
and a betrothed woman is counted as a wife; and this for a very good
reason, because she has plighted her troth, and it is a token of
abandoned incontinency for the mind of a woman to be so alienated from
the man to whom she is betrothed, as to prostitute her virginity to
another’s embraces. But since one who has been ravished is not criminal,
a woman is absolved if she be forced in a field, because it is probable
that she yielded unwillingly, inasmuch as she was far from assistance.
Although, however, the terms are accommodated to the comprehension of a
rude people, it was the intention of God to distinguish force from
consent. Thus if a girl had been forced in a retired part of a building,
from whence her cries could not be heard, God would undoubtedly have her
acquitted, provided she could prove her innocence by satisfactory
testimony and conjecture.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.vi-p11"></span>Albeit in God’s sight there is no
difference between bond and free, yet their condition is diverse as
regards courts of justice;  <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) nor do
the same evil consequences ensue from adultery with a bond-maid, (as
with a free woman.)  <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md)
Notwithstanding, therefore, that the crime is worthy of death, still, in
consideration of the people’s infirmity, the punishment is mitigated, so
that, if a person shall have corrupted a betrothed bond-maid, both shall
be scourged.  <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) From hence we infer
that, if a concubine, who had already cohabited with a man, were
seduced, it was accounted a capital adultery. Lest it should be falsely
held, from the lenity or indulgence of the law, that the offense was a
trifling one, this error is at once anticipated by the addition of the
expiation: for, if one already beaten with stripes still required
reconciliation, it follows that the measure of the offense is not to be
estimated by its penalty.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16"></span><span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.1"></span>From this passage, as well as other
similar ones, it plainly appears how many vices were of necessity
tolerated in this people. It was altogether an act of barbarism that
fathers should sell their children for the relief of their poverty,
still it could not be corrected as might have been hoped. Again, the
sanctity of the marriage-vow should have been greater than that it
should be allowable for a master to repudiate his bond-maid, after he
had betrothed her to himself as his wife; or, when he had betrothed her
to his son, to make void that covenant, which is inviolable: for that
principle ought ever to hold good — “Those whom God hath joined
together, let not man put asunder.” (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.2"></span>[Mt
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.2"></span><span id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.3"></span>;

id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.4"></span><span id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.5"></span>.)
Yet liberty was accorded to the ancient people in all these particulars;
only provision is here made that the poor girls should not suffer infamy
and injury from their repudiation. But, although God is gracious in
remitting the punishment, still He shows that chastity is pleasing to
Him, as far as the people’s hardness of heart permitted. First of all,
He does not allow a master to seduce his purchased maid-servant, but if
he wishes to enjoy her embraces, a marriage must take place; for
although He does not set this out in express terms, still we may infer
from what He condemns, that the contrary is what He approves. From
whence, too, their notion is refuted who suppose that fornication was
lawful under the Law. But the words must be more closely examined on
account of their ambiguity. First, the sex is treated with
consideration, that the condition of a female may be somewhat more
favorable than that of a male; since, otherwise, their weakness would
render young women subject to injury and shame. An explanation then
follows, respecting which, however, interpreters differ; for some read
the particle <span id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.6"></span>לא<span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p16.7"></span>,  <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md)
*lo*<span id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p17.12"></span>, which is properly negative,
for <span id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p17.13"></span>לו<span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p17.14"></span>, *lo*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p17.15"></span>; and hence arise two opposite meanings
— If he hath, or hath *not*<span id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p17.16"></span>,
betrothed her to himself. If it be preferred to take it affirmatively,
the meaning of the precept will be: If a master shall repudiate his
bond-maid, whom he has loved and destined to be his wife, he must give
her her liberty; for although literally it is, “he shall cause her to be
redeemed,” yet; the context shows that the obligation of setting her
free is laid upon him; nor is this contradicted by the fact that he is
only deprived of the power of selling her to a strange people; since I
do not understand this as applying to foreigners only, but to others of
his own nation, since sometimes those of another tribe or family are
called strangers. For, even though there were no marriage-compact, it
was not otherwise lawful to sell slaves of the holy and elect people to
foreigners. Besides, amongst the Israelites, slavery was only temporary.
But, to pass by everything else, let it suffice to observe the absurdity
that a master should hold his wife as a slave to be sold at pleasure, if
their opinion is received who suppose that the words refer to
repudiation after betrothal.  <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p18.1"></span> I myself rather approve of the other
opinion, that, although the master shall not have aspired to matrimony
with her, if her appearance displeases him so that he would be unwilling
to have her as his wife, at least he must provide for her redemption;
because her chastity would be in jeopardy if she remained with him
unmarried; unless perhaps Moses may signify that, after she had been
seduced, her master did not honor her with marriage. But the other view
which I have just expressed is more simple; and a caution is given lest
masters should seduce their maid-servants at their pleasure. Thus the
word *despise*  <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) <span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p19.1"></span> does not refer to repudiation, but is
opposed to beauty, or conjugal love.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p20"></span><span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p20.1"></span>The next case is, that if he should
betroth her to his son, (he must give her a dowry,  <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76) <span id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.1"></span>.md)
in which, also, her modesty and honor is consulted, lest she should be
oppressed by the right of ownership, and become a harlot. In the third
place, it is provided that, if she should be repudiated, her condition
should not be disadvantageous. If, therefore, he would make her his
daughter-in-law, and betroth her to his son, he is commanded to deal
liberally with her; for “after the manner of daughters” is equivalent to
giving her a dowry, or, at any rate, to treating her as if she were
free. Finally, he adds that, if he should choose another wife for his
son, he should not reject the former one, nor defraud her of her food
and raiment, or of some third thing, concerning which translators are
not well agreed. Some render it *time*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.2"></span>, but I do not see what is the meaning
of *diminishing* *her* *time*<span id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.3"></span>;
others, *duty* *of* *marriage*<span id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.4"></span>,
but this is too free a translation; others, more correctly,
*affliction*<span id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.5"></span>, since the girl would
be humiliated by her repudiation; still, to diminish affliction, is too
harsh an expression for to compensate an injury. Let my readers, then,
consider whether the word, <span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.6"></span>ענתה<span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.7"></span>, *gnonathah*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.8"></span>, is not used for *compact*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.9"></span> or *agreement*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.vii-p21.10"></span>; for thus the context will run very
well: If his son have married another wife, that the girl who has
suffered ignominious rejection should obtain her rights as to food, and
raiment, and her appointed dowry; otherwise, God commands that she
should be set free gratuitously, in order that her liberty may
compensate for the wrong she has received.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.viii-p9"></span>Hence, also, it is manifest that,
although God remits the judicial penalty, fornication is displeasing to
Him. As to the spiritual judgment of the conscience, there were
expiations to propitiate Him; He here only has consideration for young
females, lest, being deceived, and having lost their virginity, they
should become prostitutes; and thus the land should be defiled by
whoredom. The remedy is, that lie who has corrupted girl should be
compelled to marry her, and also to give tie a dowry from his own
property, lest, if he should afterwards cast her off, she should go away
from her bed penniless. But, if the marriage should not please her
father, the penalty imposed on her seducer is, that he should assign her
a wedding portion.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.ix-p6"></span><span id="ii.iii.iv.ix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv.ix-p7"></span>The immunity here given has for its
object the awakening of that mutual love which may preserve the conjugal
fidelity of husband and wife; for there is danger lest, if a husband
departs from his wife immediately after marriage, the bride, before she
has become thoroughly accustomed to him, should be too prone to fall in
love with some one else. A similar danger affects the husband; for in
war, and other expeditions, many things occur which tempt men to sin.
God, therefore, would have the love of husband and wife fostered by
their association for a whole year, that thus mutual confidence may be
established between them, and they may afterwards continually beware of
all incontinency.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.ix-p8"></span>But that God should permit a bride to
enjoy herself with her husband, affords no trifling proof of His
indulgence. Assuredly, it cannot be but that the lust of the flesh must
affect the connection of husband and wife with some amount of sin; yet
God not only pardons it, but covers it with the veil of holy matrimony,
lest that which is sinful in itself should be so imputed; nay, He
spontaneously allows them to enjoy themselves. With this injunction
corresponds what Paul says,

<span id="ii.iii.iv.ix-p9"></span>“Let the husband render unto his wife
due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. Defraud ye

dissension, and, by alienating the mind of the husband from the wife,
should loosen the ties of pure affection, since thus the door would be
open to many iniquities. By this rite, therefore, God proclaims Himself
the guardian and avenger of conjugal fidelity; and hence it appears how
acceptable a sacrifice in His sight is the chastity of married women, of
which He condescends to profess Himself the guardian. It is, therefore,
no trifling consolation to husbands, that God undertakes the cognizance
of the secret wrong, if, perchance, their wives have dealt treacherously
with them.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.x-p48"></span>But it will be better to examine the
details in order. When at the outset he says, — If a man’s wife go
aside, and her offense be concealed, an absurdity appears to be implied;
as if He would thus bring to judgment none but those who should be
convicted, whereas, if the fact were established, there would be no use
in the application of the test. But the condition, “if she commit a
trespass against him,” does not signify that the woman’s adultery should
be discovered, but refers to the opinion of her husband; and thus the
words must be paraphrased in this way: If any one should think that his
wife has had connection with another man, and he cannot otherwise be
relieved from the anxiety which oppresses him, let him appeal to God for
that judgment, which is beyond the reach of man. Still God  <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) seems designedly to have expressed the
crime, lest husbands should heedlessly involve their innocent wives in
disgrace. We know that many are causelessly suspicious; and when
jealousy has once taken possession of the mind, there is no room for
moderation or equity.  <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) Wherefore it
would be inhuman to permit morose and unreasonable husbands to drag
their wives to this horrible judgment of God on account of certain
trifling suspicions. For, if the husband were cruel and ungodly, it
would be like putting a sword into the hands of a madman, to give him
such a power without any distinction. God, therefore, implies that the
priest should carefully consider, so as not too easily to *receive*
every complaint; although He afterwards more clearly expresses Himself
in another part of the conditions, “if a man be jealous of his wife, and
she be not defiled.”

<span id="ii.iii.iv.x-p51"></span><span id="ii.iii.iv.x-p51.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv.x-p52"></span>**15.** *Then shall the man bring his
wife to the priest*. This offering is different from the rest, which
have been heretofore mentioned, because it is a kind of *adjuration*,
whereby the woman exposes herself to be accursed. Pure meal without
frankincense or oil is therefore offered, since the rite  <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) of expiation would not be in accordance
with the curse. That the woman may be more afraid of perjuring herself,
she is presented before God, with her head uncovered too, as if the
priest would drag her from her lurking-place; for it seems incongruous
that, as some suppose, the veil was removed from her head in token of
her infamy, since thus she would have been condemned before her case was
heard. She is, then, brought before God’s face with her head bare, that
she may be seriously alarmed; and then follows the mode of absolution or
condemnation. The priest is commanded to take holy water in an earthen
vessel, to throw in some dust from the floor, and then a book or scroll,
on which were written the words of the curse, so that the blots should
remain in the water, and so to give the cup to the woman. Some interpret
the holy water to be that which was kept ill the brazen laver, to be
always ready for the ablution of those engaged in duly offering
sacrifices. Let my readers, however, consider whether he does not rather
mean the water in which the ashes of the red heifer were sprinkled, and
whereby solemn purifications were made, (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.x-p53.1"></span>[Nu
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/num019.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.x-p53.1"></span>,) as we have already seen. For thus the
woman was admonished that, if she perjured herself, no further means of
expiation remained. The dust collected from the floor was also a sign of
detestation: in short, the whole proceedings were calculated to humble
her, so that she might not double her offense by perjury. Besides, the
priest is commanded to repeat the words of the curse, lest she should
seek to escape by some subterfuge or other. The question, however,
arises, why she should be compelled to imprecate evil upon herself
rather than others were who were suspected of murder or other atrocious
crimes? and I think it was for this reason, because no other offense can
be so easily concealed. Lest, therefore, women should grow hardened from
their cunning and evil arts, a remedy is provided against their various
deceptions; and thus God shows that the marriage-bed is under His
protection and safeguard. We must remember, too, that this was not a
mere empty bugbear, inasmuch as God undoubtedly appeared as the open
avenger of unfaithfulness, according to His declaration. Nor is the
threat added in vain, that if the woman be a deceiver, she should be a
curse among the people, because her belly should swell and her thigh
dissolve; whilst, on the other hand, He does not promise in vain, that
if she be innocent, she should not only be free, but prolific also; so
that God’s blessing would be the seal of her absolution. For this is the
meaning of the expression, “she shall be sown with seed;”  <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) as, on the contrary, it was said that her
thigh  <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) should dissolve when she
wasted away with barrenness. We infer, from the opposite effects of the
same water, that by the outward symbol God wrought with His *secret*
power as the occasion demanded.

This passage also tends to the exaltation of chastity. God provides
against both cases, lest a husband should unjustly bring reproach upon a
chaste and innocent young woman, and lest a young woman, having been
defiled, should escape punishment, if she pretended to be a virgin. A
third object is also to be remarked, viz., that parents were thus
admonished to be more careful in watching over their children. This is,
indeed, an act of gross brutality, that a husband, wittingly and
willingly, should seek a false pretext for divorcing his wife by
bringing reproach and infamy upon her; but, since it does not
infrequently happen that the libidinous become disgusted with their
vices, and then endeavor to rid themselves of them in every way, it was
needful to correct this evil, and to prescribe a method whereby the
integrity of the woman should be safe from the calumnies of an ungodly
and cruel husband; whilst it was also just to give relief to an honest
man, lest he should be compelled to cherish in his bosom a harlot, by
whom he had been deceived; for it is a very bitter thing to ingenuous
minds silently to endure so great an ignominy. An admirable precaution
is here laid down, *i* *e*., that if a woman were accused by her
husband, it was in the power of her parents to produce the tokens of
chastity which should acquit her; but if they did not, that the husband
should not be obliged against his will to keep her in his house, after
she had been defiled by another. It is plain from this passage, that the
tokens of virginity were taken on a cloth, on the first night of
marriage, as future proofs of chastity. It is also probable that the
cloth was laid up before witnesses as a pledge, to be a sure defense for
pure and modest young women; for it would have been giving too much
scope to the parents if it had been believed simply on their evidence;
but Moses speaks briefly as of a well-known custom.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xi-p24"></span><span id="ii.iii.iv.xi-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xi-p25"></span>**18.** *And the elders of that city
shall take that man*. Calumny in this case received a threefold
punishment; first, that he, who had invented the false accusation,
should be beaten with stripes; secondly, that he should pay an hundred
pieces of silver to the father of the girl; thirdly, that he should
never be allowed to put her away; and tie reason is given, “because he
hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel.” God here shows
Himself to be the protector of virgins, that young women may be the more
encouraged to cultivate chastity. If any should object that it was a bad
provision for the unhappy woman that she should be subjected for ever to
tyrannical rule, I reply, that this was done because there was no means
for her release; for although, as we shall presently see, men were
permitted to obtain a divorce from their wives, still it was neither
just nor right to overthrow God’s earliest institution. Besides, it was
necessary to obviate the trick of the husband who would have gloried in
her divorce, as having gained what he desired.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xi-p27"></span>**20.** *But if this thing be
true*<span id="ii.iii.iv.xi-p27.1"></span>. If the punishment should
seem to anybody to be somewhat too severe, let him reflect that no kind
of fraud is more intolerable. A false sale of a field or a house shall
be accounted a crime, as also the utterance of false money; and,
therefore, she who abuses the sacred name of marriage for deception, and
offers an unchaste body instead of a chaste one, much less deserves to
be pardoned. The cause of severity, however, which is expressly
mentioned, is much more extensive, *i* *e*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xi-p27.2"></span>., because she hath wrought wickedness,
or filthiness in Israel. The translation which some. give, *folly*<span

id="ii.iii.iv.xi-p27.6"></span>, it still means something more atrocious

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xii-p12"></span><span
id="ii.iii.iv.xii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13"></span>Although what relates to divorce was
granted in indulgence to the Jews, yet Christ pronounces that it was
never in accordance with the Law, because it is directly repugnant to
the first institution of God, from whence a perpetual and inviolable
rule is to be sought. It is proverbially said that the laws of nature
are indissoluble; and God has declared once for all, that the bond of
union between husband and wife is closer than that of parent and child;
wherefore, if a son cannot shake off the paternal yoke, no cause can
permit the dissolution of the connection which a man has with his wife.
Hence it appears how great was the perverseness of that nation, which
could not be restrained from dissolving a most sacred and inviolable
tie. Meanwhile the Jews improperly concluded from their impunity that
that was lawful, which God did not punish because of the hardness of
their hearts; whereas they ought rather to have *considered*, agreeably
to the answer of Christ, that man is not at liberty to separate those
whom God hath joined together. (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13.1"></span>[Mt
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13.1"></span>.) Still, God chose to make a provision
for women who were cruelly oppressed, and for whom it was better that
they should at once be set free, than that they should groan beneath a
cruel tyranny during their whole lives. Thus, in Malachi, divorce is
preferred to polygamy, since it would be a more tolerable condition to
be divorced than to bear with a harlot and a rival. (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13.2"></span>[Mal
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13.2"></span>.) And undoubtedly the bill or scroll of
divorce, whilst it cleared the woman from all disgrace, cast some
reproach on the husband; for he who confesses that he puts away his
wife, because she does not please him, brings himself under the
accusation both of moroseness and inconstancy. For what gross levity and
disgraceful inconstancy it shows, that a husband should be so offended
with some imperfection or disease in his wife, as to east away from him
half of himself! We see, then, that husbands were indirectly condemned
by the writing of divorce, since they thus committed an injury against
their wives who were chaste, and in other respects what they should be.
On these grounds, God in Isaiah, in order that He might take away from
the Jews all subject of complaint, bids them produce the bill of
divorce, if He had given any to their mother, (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13.3"></span>[Isa
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xii-p13.3"></span>;) as much as to say, that His cause for
rejecting them was just, because they had treacherously revolted to
ungodliness.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xii-p14"></span>Some interpreters do not read these
three verses continuously, but suppose the sense to be complete at the
end of the first, wherein the husband testifies that he divorces his
wife for no offense, but because her beauty does not satisfy his lust.
If, however, we give more close attention, we shall see that it is only
one provision of the Law, viz., that when a man has divorced his wife,
it is not lawful for him to marry her again if she have married another.
The reason of the law is, that, by prostituting his wife, he would be,
as far as in him lay, acting like a procurer. In this view, it is said
that she was defiled, because he had contaminated her body, for the
liberty which he gave her could not abolish the first institution of
God, but rather, as Christ teaches, gave cause for adultery. (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xii-p14.1"></span>[Mt
5:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xii-p14.1"></span>, and 19:9.) Thus, the Israelites were
reminded that, although they divorced their wives with impunity, still
this license was by no means excused before God.

id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md) The enormity of the crime is seen by the
severity of the punishment; and surely, when a man and woman abandon
themselves to so disgraceful an act, it is plain that there are no
remains of modesty in them. God, therefore, does not only regard the
offense itself, but the brutal impulse of lust, whereby men are so
carried away as to degenerate from the very feelings of nature. For what
wickedness would he abstain from who yields to such impurity, that he
breaks through an obstacle in his fury which restrains the brutes
themselves? Let us not wonder, then, that God is a severe avenger of
such obscenity.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiii-p12"></span>This precept  <span
id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) has no other tendency than that believers
should be kept far from all filthiness, and that chastity may flourish
among them. It is indeed true that a woman, under these circumstances,
is withheld from connection with a man by the very foulness of the
disease, whilst there is also danger of contagion; but God rather
chooses here to be an instructor in decency to His people, than to
perform the office of a physician. It must be remembered, therefore,
that men are warned against all indelicacy, which is abhorrent to the
natural sense; and, by *synecdoche*, married persons are exhorted to
restrain themselves from all immodest lasciviousness, and that the
husband should enjoy his wife’s embraces with delicacy and propriety.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p39"></span>**1.** *And the Lord spoke unto
Moses*. I have not introduced this declaration amongst other similar
ones, which had for their object the preparation of their minds for the
reverent reception of the Law, because, whatever conformity there may be
in the words themselves, in their substance there is a great difference;
for they were general, whereas this is specially confined to a single
point. For it was not God’s intention here merely to exhort the people
to the study of the Law, but the address respecting the keeping of His
statutes is directed to the present cause, since He does not refer
indifferently to all the statutes of Himself and of the Gentiles, but
restricts Himself to the subject-matter, as it is called; and thus, by
the statutes of the Gentiles, He means those corruptions whereby they
had perverted His pure institution as to holy matrimony. First, however,
tie forbids them from following the customs of the Egyptians, and then
includes all the Canaanitish nations. For, since all the Orientals are
libidinous, they never had any scruple in polluting themselves by
incestuous marriages; whilst it is abundantly proved by history, how
great were the excesses of the Egyptians  <span
id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) in this respect. A brother had no
abhorrence against marrying his uterine sister, nor a paternal or
maternal uncle his niece; in a word, they were so dead to. shame that
they were carried away by their lusts to trample upon all the laws of
nature. This is the reason why God here enumerates the kinds of incest
of which the mention would else have been superfluous.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p41"></span><span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p41.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p42"></span>**4.** *Ye shall therefore keep my
statutes and my judgments*. Because it is no less difficult to correct
vices, to which men have been long accustomed, than to cure diseases of
long standing, especially because people in general so pertinaciously
cleave to bad examples, God adduces His statutes, in order to recall the
people from the errors of their evil habits into the right way. For
nothing is more absurd than for us to fix our minds on the actions of
men, and not on God’s word, in which is to be found the rule of a holy
life. It is, therefore, just as if God would overthrow whatever had been
received from long custom, and abolish the universal consent of the
world by the authority of His doctrine. With this object He commands His
Law to be regarded not once only, as we have already seen, lest the
Israelites should abandon themselves to filthy lusts; but He diligently
inculcates upon them, that they should turn away from all abuses, and
keep themselves within the bounds and ordinances of His Law. And to this
refers the expression, “I am the Lord your God;” containing a comparison
between Himself and the heathen nations, between whom and His people He
had interposed, as it were, a wall of partition.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p43"></span><span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p43.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p44"></span>**6.** *None of you shall approach
to any that is near*<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p44.1"></span>. This name
does not include all female relations; for cousin-ger-mans of the
father’s or mother’s side are permitted to intermarry; but it must be
restricted to the degrees, which He proceeds to enumerate, and is merely
a brief preface, declaring that there are certain degrees of
relationship which render marriages incestuous. We may, therefore,
define these female relations of blood to be those which are spoken of
immediately afterwards, viz., that a son should not marry his mother,
nor a son-in-law his mother-in-law; nor a paternal or maternal uncle his
niece, nor a grandfather his granddaughter, nor a brother his sister,
nor a nephew his paternal or maternal aunt, or his uncle’s wife, nor a
father-in-law his daughter-in-law, nor a brother-in-law his brother’s
wife, nor a step-father his stepdaughter. The Roman laws accord with the
rule prescribed by God, as if their authors had learnt from Moses what
was decorous and agreeable to nature. The phrase which God uses
frequently “to uncover the turpitude,” is intended to awaken abhorrence,
in order that the Israelites may beware more diligently of all incest.
The Hebrew word, indeed, <span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p44.2"></span>ערוה<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p44.3"></span>, *gnervah*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p44.4"></span>, signifies *nakedness*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p44.5"></span>, therefore some translate it actively,
“the nakedness of thy father,” *i* *e*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p44.6"></span>., the womb which thy father hath
uncovered; but this meaning would not be suitable to the nakedness of
thy daughter, or thy daughter-in-law, or thy sister. Consequently, there
is no doubt but that Moses means to denote that it is a filthy and
shameful thing.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p45"></span>We must remember, what I have
already hinted, that not only are incestuous connections out of wedlock
condemned, but that the degrees are pointed out, within which marriages
are unlawful. It is true, indeed, that this was a part of the political
constitution which God established for His ancient people; still, it
must be borne in mind, that whatever is prescribed here is deduced from
the source of rectitude itself, and from the natural feelings implanted
in us by Him. Absurd is the cleverness which some persons but little
versed in Scripture pretend to,  <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md)
who assert that the Law being abrogated, the obligations under which
Moses laid his countrymen are now dissolved; for it is to be inferred
from the preface above expounded, that. the instruction here given is
not, nor ought to be accounted, merely political. For, since their lusts
had led astray all the neighboring nations into incest, God, in order to
inculcate chastity amongst his people, says; “I am the Lord your God, ye
shall therefore keep my statutes; walk not after the doings of the land
of Egypt and of Canaan;” and then He adds what are the degrees of
consanguinity and affinity within which the marriage of men and women is
forbidden. If any again object that what has been disobeyed in many
countries is not to be accounted the law of the Gentiles, the reply is
easy, viz., that the barbarism, which prevailed in the East, does not
nullify that chastity which is opposed to the abominations of the
Gentiles; since what is natural cannot be abrogated by any consent or
custom. In short, the prohibition of incests here set forth, is by no
means of the number of those laws which are commonly abrogated according
to the circumstances of time and place, since it flows from the fountain
of nature itself, and is founded on the general principle of all laws,
which is perpetual and inviolable. Certainly God declares that the
custom which had prevailed amongst the heathen was displeasing to Him;
and why is this, but because nature itself repudiates and abhors
filthiness, although approved of by the consent (*suffragiis*) of men?
Wherefore, when God would by this distinction separate His chosen people
from heathen nations, we may assuredly conclude that the incests which
He commands them to avoid are absolute pollutions. Paul, on a very
trifling point, sets before our *eyes* the law of nature; for, when he
teaches that it is shameful and indecorous for women to appear in public
without veils, he desires them to consider, whether it would be decent
for them to present themselves publicly with their heads shorn; and
finally adds, that nature itself does not permit it. (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p46.1"></span>[1Co
11:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p46.1"></span>.) Wherefore, I do not see, that, under
the pretext of its being a political Law,  <span
id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) the purity of nature is to be abolished,
from whence arises the distinction between the statutes of God, and the
abuses of the Gentiles. If this discipline were founded on the utility
of a single people, or on the custom of a particular time, or on present
necessity, or on any other circumstances, the laws deduced from it might
be abrogated for new reasons, or their observance might be dispensed
with in regard to particular persons, by special privilege; but since,
in their enactment, the perpetual decency of nature was alone regarded,
not even a dispensation of them would be permissible. It may indeed be
decreed that it should be lawful and unpunished, since it is in the
power of princes to remit penalties; yet no legislator can effect that a
thing, which nature pronounces to be vicious, should not be vicious;
and, if tyrannical arrogance dares to attempt it, the light of nature
will presently shine forth and prevail. When, formerly, the Emperor
Claudius had married his niece Agrippina,  <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) for the purpose of averting the shame, he
procured a *Senatusconsultum*, which licensed such marriages; yet no one
was found to imitate his example, except one freedman. Hence, just and
reasonable men will acknowledge that, even amongst heathen nations, this
Law was accounted indissoluble, as if implanted and engraved on the
hearts of men. On this ground Paul, more severely to reprove the incest
of a step-son with his father’s wife, says, that such an occurrence “is
not so much as named among the Gentiles.” (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p48.1"></span>[1Co
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p48.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p49"></span>If it be objected that such
marriages are not prohibited to us in the New Testament, I reply, that
the marriage of a father with his daughter is not forbidden; nor is a
mother prohibited from marrying her son; and shall it therefore be
lawful for those, who are near of kin, to form promiscuous connections?
 <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) Although Paul expressly mentions
only one kind of incest, yet he establishes its disgrace by adducing the
example of the Gentiles, that at least we should be ashamed if more
delicacy and chastity is seen amongst them. And:. in fact, another
admonition of the same Paul is enough for me, who thus writes to the
Philippians:

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p51"></span>“Whatsoever things are true,
whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think
on these things.” (<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p51.1"></span>[Php
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p51.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p52"></span>As to those who ascend or descend
ill a direct line, it, sufficiently appears that there is a monstrous
indecency in the connection of father and daughter, or mother and son. A
licentious poet,  <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) being about to
relate the frantic incest of Myrrha, says:

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p55"></span>*“Daughters* *and* *fathers,* *from*
*my* *song* *retire,  
I* *sing* *of* *horror.”*

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p56"></span>In the collateral line, the uncles
on both sides represent the father, and the aunts the mother; and,
consequently, connection with them is forbidden, inasmuch as it would be
of somewhat similar impropriety. The same rule affects affinity; for the
step-mother, or mother-in-law, is held to stand in the relation of
mother; and the step-daughter, or daughter-in-law, in that of daughter;
as also the wife of the paternal or maternal uncle is to be regarded in
the relation of mother. And, although express mention may not be made of
it here, we must form our judgment by analogy as to what is prohibited;
— the uncle on the father’s or mother’s side is not here forbidden to
marry his niece; but, since the nephew is interdicted from marrying his
paternal or maternal aunt, the mutual relation of the inferior to the
superior degree must prevail. But if any should contend that there is a
difference, the reason added by Moses refutes his objection, for it is
said, “She is thy father’s or thy mother’s near kinswoman.” Hence it
follows, that a niece is guilty of incest if she marries her uncle on
either side. As to brothers and sisters, God pronounces that marriage
with a sister, although she be not uterine, is unlawful; for He forbids
the uncovering of the turpitude of a sister, who is either the daughter
of thy father or thy mother.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p57"></span><span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p57.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p58"></span>**16.** *Thou shalt not uncover the
nakedness of thy brother’s wife*. They are bad  <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) interpreters who raise a controversy on
this passage, and expound it, that a brother’s wife must not be taken
from his bed, or, if she be divorced, that manage with her would be
unlawful whilst her husband was still alive; for it is incongruous to
twist into different senses declarations which are made in the same
place, and in the same words. God forbids the uncovering of the
turpitude of the wife of a father, an uncle, and a son; and when He lays
down the same rule respecting a brother’s wife in the very same words,
it is absurd to invent a different meaning for them. If, therefore, it
be not lawful to marry the wife of a father, a son, an uncle, or a
nephew, we must. hold precisely the same opinion with respect to a
brother’s wife, concerning whom an exactly similar law is enacted in the
same passage and context. I am not, however, ignorant of the source from
whence those, who think otherwise, have derived their mistake; for,
whereas God gives a command in another place, that if a man shall have
died without issue, his surviving brother shall take his widow to wife,
in order that he may raise up of her seed to the departed, (<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p59.1"></span>[De
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p59.1"></span>,) they have incorrectly and ignorantly
restricted this to own-brothers, although God rather designates other
degrees of relationship. It is a well-known Hebrew idiom, to embrace
under the name of brother all near kinsmen in general; and the Latins
also formerly so denominated cousins-german.  <span
id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md) The law, then, now before us, respecting
marriage with a deceased brother’s wife, is only addressed to those
relations who are not otherwise prohibited from such a marriage, since
it was not God’s purpose to prevent the loss of a deceased person’s name
by permitting those incestuous marriages, which tie had elsewhere
condemned. Wherefore these two points agree perfectly well, that an
own-brother was prohibited from marrying his brother’s widow, whilst the
next of kin were obliged to raise up seed for the dead, by the right of
their relationship, wherever their marriage was otherwise permissible by
the enactment’s of the law. On this ground Boaz married Ruth, who had
previously been married to his near kinsman; and it is abundantly clear
from the history, that the law applied to all the near kinsmen. But if
any still contend that own-brothers were included in the number of
these, on the same grounds the daughter-in-law must be married by her
father-in-law, and the nephew’s wife by the uncle, and even the
mother-in-law by the son-in-law, which it is an abomination to speak of.
If any object that Er, Onan, and Shelah, the sons of Judah, were
own-brothers, and still that Tamar married two of them, the difficulty
is easily solved, viz., that Judah, following the common and received
practice of the Gentiles, acted improperly in permitting it. It is plain
enough, from the histories of all ages, that there were disgusting and
shameless mixtures in the marriages of Oriental nations. By evil
communications, then, as is ever the case, Judah was led into giving the
same wife to his second son as had before been married to the eldest.
And, in fact, God expressly says that this offense was rife among the
Gentiles, where tie condemns incestuous connections. This, therefore, I
still hold to be unquestionable, that, by the law of Moses, marriage
with the widow of an own-brother is forbidden.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p61"></span><span
id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p61.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p62"></span>**18.** *Neither shalt thou take a
wife to her sister*. By this passage certain froward persons pretend
that it is permitted, if a man has lost his wife, to marry her own
sister, because the restriction is added, not to take the one in the
lifetime of the other. From whence they infer, that it is not forbidden
that she should succeed in the place of the deceased. But they ought to
have considered the intention of the legislator from his own express
words, for mention is made not only of incest and filthiness, but of the
jealousy and quarrels, which arise from hence. If it had merely been
said, “Thou shalt not uncover her turpitude,” there would have been some
color to their pretext, that the husband being a widower, he would be
free to marry his wife’s sister; but, when a different object for the
law is expressly stated, *i* *e*., lest she, who was legally married,
should be troubled by quarrels and contentions, it is plain that the
license for polygamy is restricted by this exception, in order that the
Israelites should be contented with one evil, and, at least, should not
expose two sisters to hostile contention with each other. The condition
of the first wife was already painful enough, when she was compelled to
put up with a rival and a concubine; but it was more intolerable to be
constantly quarrelling with her near relative. The name of sister is
not, therefore, restricted, I think, to actual sisters, but other
relations are included in it, whose marriages would not otherwise have
been incestuous. In a word, it is not incest which is condemned, so much
as the cruelty of a husband, if he chose to contract a further marriage
with the near kinswoman of his wife. Nor can we come to any other
conclusion from the words of Moses; for if the turpitude of a brother is
uncovered when his brother marries his widow, no less is the turpitude
of a sister uncovered when her sister marries her husband after her
decease. But hence we plainly see the diabolical arrogance of the Pope,
who, by inventing new degrees of kindred, would be wiser than God;
whilst he also betrays his cunning, because from this kind of sport he
made himself a fat game-bag.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p63"></span>Since from long custom it is
established that cousins-german should not marry, we must beware of
giving scandal lest too unbridled a liberty should expose the Gospel to
much reproach; and we must bear in mind Paul’s admonition, to abstain
even from things lawful when they are not expedient. (<span

incest, but speaks only of that with a step-mother, it is probable that,
what he had more fully set forth before he here briefly recalled to the
minds of the Israelites under a single head. At any rate, the
prohibition of one offense does not open the gate to other abominations.
The expression which he adds, “nor discover his father’s skirt,” is as
much as to say, that the father is exposed to shame when the step-son
has; no regard to decency, and goes in to his step-mother. Perhaps he
alludes to the sin of Ham, who betrayed his ungodliness by exposing the
shame of his father. (<span id="ii.iii.iv.xv-p7.1"></span>[Ge

The Hebrew verb <span id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.2"></span>קדש<span
id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.3"></span> has the double signification of *sanctum*
*esse*<span id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.4"></span> and *praeparare*<span
id="ii.iii.iv.iv-p8.5"></span>, (Taylor’s Concordance,) though only, it
would appear, to prepare by sanctifying.

shall be scourged;” margin, “there shall be a scourging.” *Dathe*’*s*
translation is “vapulabunt ambo,” and his note, “sic Vulgatus recte,

that he may not sell her to strangers, is inserted to show that there
was no reason why he should sell her whom he has abused with vain hopes.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p40"></span> “A very objectionable custom, which
is not only noticed by Diodorus, but is fully authenticated by the
sculptures both of Upper and Lower Egypt, existed among them from the
earliest times, the origin and policy of which it is not easy to explain
— the marriage of brother and sister, which Diodorus supposes to have
been owing to, and sanctioned by, that of His and Osiris; but as this
was purely an allegorical fable, and these ideal personages never lived
on earth, his conjecture is of little weight; nor does any ancient
writer offer a satisfactory explanation of so strange a custom.” —
Wilkinson’s Popular Account of the Ancient Egyptians, 2:224.

<span id="ii.iii.iv.xiv-p46"></span> Thus, the third Canon of the 24th
Session of the Council of Trent declares; “Si quis dixerit, eos tantum
consanguinitatis et affinitatis gradus, qui Levitico exprimentur, posse
impedire matrimonium, et dirimere contractum: nec posse Ecclesiam in
nonnullis illorum dispensare, aut constituere, ut plures impediant, et
dirimant, anathema sit.” “Atqui plane certum est, (says Lorinus, *in*
*loco*,) praecepta de gradibus in isto capite contenta, cum non sint
omnia pure moralia, et naturalia, sed quaedam positiva, et judicialia,
per se non obligare Christianos, et idcirco posse per Ecclesiam in
quibusdam dispensari.”

posterum statuerentur.’ Neque tamen repertus est, nisi unus talis
matrimonii cupitor, T. Alladius Severus, eques Romanus, quem plerique

consanguinitatem fratres vocantur, et pene germani sunt.”
