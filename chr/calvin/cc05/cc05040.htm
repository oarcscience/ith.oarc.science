<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.vi-p19"></A><b>9. </b><i>Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God</i>. The verb   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">220</FONT></A>
 			  might have been as properly translated in the future tense; and, if this be preferred, an experimental knowledge, as it is called, is referred to, as if he had said that God would practically manifest how faithful a rewarder He is of His servants. But if the other reading is rather approved, Moses exhorts the people to be assured that God sits in heaven as the Judge of men, so that they may be both alarmed by the fear of His vengeance, and also attracted by the hope 			 of reward. This declaration, however,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">221</FONT></A>
 			  was appended to the Second Commandment, and there expounded; for since it is comprehended in the Decalogue, it was not right to separate it from thence; but since it is now repeated in confirmation of the whole Law, it is fitly inserted in this place. It will not be amiss, nevertheless, slightly to advert to what I there more fully explained. The promise stands first, because God chooses rather to invite His people by kindness than to compel them to obedience from 			 terror. The word <i>mercy</i> is coupled with the <i>covenant</i>, that we may know that the reward which believers must expect, does not depend on the merit of their works, since they have need of God&#8217;s mercy. We may, however, thus resolve the phrase &#8212; keeping the covenant of mercy &#8212; or the covenant founded on <i>mercy</i> &#8212; or the mercy which He 			 covenanted.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.vi-p22"></A>When it is required of believers that they should love God before they keep His Commandments, we are thus taught that the source and cause of obedience is the love wherewith we embrace God as our Father. With respect to the &#8220;thousand generations,&#8221; it is better that we should refer to the Second Commandment, because it is a point which cannot be hurried over in a few words.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vi-p23"></A><a name="v.vi-p23.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.vi-p24"></A><b>10. </b><i>And repayeth them that hate him</i>. There is no mention here made of the vengeance &#8220;unto the third and fourth generation?   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">222</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="v.vi-p26"></A>Those who expound the passage that God confers kindnesses on the wicked, whilst they are living in this world,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">223</FONT></A>
 			 that He may at length destroy them in final perdition, wrest the words too violently. Nor is the opinion of others probable, that God repays the wicked with the reward of hatred, in His <i>face</i>, or anger. I therefore interpret it to mean the face of those to whose disobedience God opposes Himself when He humbles their arrogance; for He alludes to their pride and audacity, because they do not hesitate to provoke God, as if He were without the courage or the power to contend with 			 them. He declares, then, that their impudence and brazen front shall avail them nothing, but that He will cast down the impertinence of their countenance, and the insolence of their forehead; and signifies that they shall as certainly feel the judgment which they despise, as if He presented it before their eyes. He adds, moreover, that He will not deal towards the wicked with the clemency which he uses towards His children; for He so chastises them that His correction is always profitable for 			 their salvation, whilst He denounces deadly punishment against the former; for although He seems to deal alike with both, when He inflicts temporal punishment, still, that which is but a medicine for believers, is to the reprobate a foretaste of their eternal destruction. What He says, however, as to taking vengeance without delay, does not seem to accord with other passages of Scripture, in which He declares Himself to be slow to anger, kind, and long-suffering. Besides, it seems also to be 			 contradicted by experience, since He does not immediately hasten to inflict punishment, but proceeds slowly, so as to compensate by His severity for the slowness with which He acts. But we must remember what He says in <a name="v.vi-p27.23"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#004">Ps 90:4</a><a name="v.vi-p27.23"></A>, that a thousand years in His sight are but as a single day; and consequently, when we think that He delays, He is, in His infinite wisdom, hastening as much as is necessary. He seems, 			 indeed, to take no notice for a time, that He may thus invite men to repent; but still He declares that He will not delay, but that He will come suddenly, like a whirlwind, to hasten His judgments, lest the ungodly should grow drowsy from their security. Let us, therefore, learn quietly and patiently to wait for the fit season of His vengeance.</p>  		  
<p><a name="v.vi-p28"></A><a name="v.vi-p28.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="v.vi-p29"></A><b>12. </b><i>Wherefore it shall come to pass</i>. God appears so to act according to agreement, as to leave (His people) no hope of His favor, unless they perform their part of it; and undoubtedly this is the usual form of expression in the Law, in which the condition is inserted, that God will do good to His people if they have deserved it by their 			 obedience. Still we must remember what we have elsewhere seen, that, after God has so covenanted with them, He Himself, in order that His promise may not be made of none effect, descends to the gratuitous promise of pardon, whereby He reconciles the unworthy to Himself. Thus the original covenant only avails to man&#8217;s condemnation. But when salvation is offered to them gratuitously, their works at the same time become pleasing to God. Inasmuch, however, as the cause of reward is unconnected with 			 men and their works, all calculation of merit is out of the question: still it is profitable to believers that a reward should be promised them if they walk in the commandments of God; since, in His inestimable liberality, He deals with them as if they did something to deserve it.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="v.vi-p30"></A>In conclusion, Moses enumerates some of the proofs of God&#8217;s favor, such as fecundity, and an abundance of the fruits of the earth. It is questionable whether by what is added at the end respecting the diseases of Egypt, he means the boils which were generated by the scattered ashes, (<a name="v.vi-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#008">Ex 9:8</a><a name="v.vi-p30.1"></A>,) or the lice which infested both man and beast, (<a name="v.vi-p30.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#017">Ex 8:17</a><a name="v.vi-p30.2"></A>,) or whether he extends them to those diseases which had prevailed long before the departure of the people. I am disposed to embrace the latter opinion;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">224</FONT></A>
 			 for in <a name="v.vi-p31.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027">De 28:27</a><a name="v.vi-p31.1"></A>, after mentioning &#8220;the botch of Egypt,&#8221; he adds &#8220;emerods, and the scab, and the itch:&#8221; it is, therefore, probable that the Egyptians were subject to various maladies, from which Moses declares that the people should be free by special privilege, if only they obeyed God&#8217;s Law.</p>

Even at the present day, there are in Egypt several peculiar diseases, especially ophthalmia, variolous diseases, and plague.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Rosenmuller</i>. Hengstenberg also, in his &#8220;Egypt and the Books of Moses,&#8221; has an article on this subject, p. 454, confirmative 				  of the above.
