<span id="ii.iii.i-p5"></span>THE REPETITION OF THE COMMANDMENT

<span id="ii.iii.i-p6"></span><span

<span id="ii.iii.i-p8"></span>**18.** Neither shalt thou commit

<span id="ii.iii.i-p9"></span>**18.** Non committes adulterium.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p10"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.i-p11"></span><span id="ii.iii.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.i-p12"></span>Although one kind of impurity is alone
referred to, it is sufficiently plain, from the principle laid down,
that believers are generally exhorted to chastity; for, if the Law be a
perfect rule of holy living, it would be more than absurd to give a
license for fornication, adultery alone being excepted. Furthermore, it
is incontrovertible that God will by no means approve or excuse before
this tribunal, what the common sense of mankind declares to be obscene;
for, although lewdness has everywhere been rampant in every age, still
the opinion could never be utterly extinguished, that fornication is a
scandal and a sin. Unquestionably what Paul teaches has been prevalently
received from the beginning, that a good life consists of three parts,
soberness, righteousness, and godliness, (<span
id="ii.iii.i-p12.1"></span>Titus 2:12;) and the soberness which he
commands differs not from chastity. Besides, when Christ or the Apostles
are treating of a perfect life, they always refer believers to the Law;
for, as it had been said of old by Moses, “This is the way, walk ye in
it;”  <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) Christ confirms this,

<span id="ii.iii.i-p14"></span>“If thou wilt enter into life, keep the
commandments,” (<span id="ii.iii.i-p14.1"></span>[Mt
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.iii.i-p14.1"></span>;)

<span id="ii.iii.i-p15"></span>and Paul corroborates it, “He that loveth
another hath fulfilled the Law,” (<span id="ii.iii.i-p15.1"></span>[Ro
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.iii.i-p15.1"></span>,) whilst they constantly pronounce a curse
against all fornicators. It is not worth while to quote the particular
passages in which they do so. Now, if Christ and the Apostles, who are
the best interpreters of the Law, declare that God’s Law is violated no
less by fornication than by theft, we assuredly infer, that in this
Commandment the whole *genus* is comprehended under a single *species*.
Wherefore, those have done nothing but betray their disgraceful
ignorance, who have sought to be praised for their acuteness on the
score of their ridiculous subtlety, when they admitted that fornication
is indeed condemned with sufficient clearness and frequency in the New
Testament, but not in the Law. For, if they had reasoned justly,
inasmuch as God is declared to have blessed marriage, it must at once be
concluded, on the contrary, that the connection of male and female,
except in marriage, is accursed. This is the argument of the author of
the Epistle to the Hebrews, where he contrasts two opposite things;

<span id="ii.iii.i-p16"></span>“Marriage (he says) is honorable in all,
and the bed undefiled; but whoremongers and adulterers God will
judge.”  
(<span id="ii.iii.i-p16.2"></span>[Heb
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.iii.i-p16.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.iii.i-p17"></span><span id="ii.iii.i-p17.1"></span>So also,
when God forbids the priest to marry a harlot, (<span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.2"></span>[Le
21:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.2"></span><span id="ii.iii.i-p17.3"></span>,) the
manifest impropriety of fornication is declared; and, if it was unlawful
for the daughters of Israel to be harlots, (<span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.4"></span>[De
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.4"></span><span id="ii.iii.i-p17.5"></span>,) the same
reasoning applies necessarily to males. Nor has Hosea taken that reproof
from anywhere else but the Law? “Whoredom and wine take away the heart.”
(<span id="ii.iii.i-p17.6"></span>[Ho
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.6"></span><span id="ii.iii.i-p17.7"></span>.) Thus,
when the Prophets metaphorically condemn the corruptions of their
nation, they do not always use the same; word as Moses here does, <span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.8"></span>נפ<span id="ii.iii.i-p17.9"></span>,
*naaph*<span id="ii.iii.i-p17.10"></span>, but compare them to
fornications, whereas, if fornication were lawful in itself, this
metaphor would be altogether inappropriate. Hosea was commanded to take
a harlot for a wife, (<span id="ii.iii.i-p17.11"></span>[Ho
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.11"></span><span id="ii.iii.i-p17.12"></span>;) no
mention is made of adultery, and still the shame and baseness of the
people is thus condemned. Who, then, would say that fornication is free
from sin, since God brands it with no ordinary mark of ignominy? But if
any should pertinaciously contest this, let him accuse Paul of error,
who bears witness that an example is set before us in the Law, that we
should. not “commit fornication as some of them committed, and fell in
one day three-and-twenty thousand.” (<span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.13"></span>[Nu
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.13"></span><span id="ii.iii.i-p17.14"></span>; <span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.15"></span>[1Co
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.15"></span><span id="ii.iii.i-p17.16"></span>.) Surely,
if they had not transgressed the Law, so horrible a vengeance would not
have overwhelmed them. If any should object that the crime of idolatry
was mixed up with it., still the declaration of Paul remains untouched,
that God was the avenger of fornication in this infliction of
punishment, which would not accord, unless it were a transgression of
the Law. And in truth, where, as recorded by Luke, (<span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.17"></span>[Ac
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.iii.i-p17.17"></span><span id="ii.iii.i-p17.18"></span>,) the
Apostles in their decree prohibit fornication amongst the Gentiles, the
reason is at the same time added, that “Moses is read in the
synagogues.” Now, if it were not a vice opposed to the Law, no offense
would have hence arisen.

<span id="ii.iii.i-p18"></span>We have already explained why, under this
word adultery, every impure lust was condemned. We know how unbridled
was the licentiousness of the Gentiles; for, although God never suffered
all shame to be extinguished together with their purity, still respect
for what was right was in a manner stifled, so that they evaded the
grossness of the sin by ribaldry and scurrilous jests. At any rate, the
doctrine of Paul was by no means understood, that those who indulge in
whoredom “sin against their own body.” (<span
id="ii.iii.i-p18.1"></span>[1Co
6:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.iii.i-p18.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.iii.i-p19"></span>Since, then, the minds of all men were
stupified by indulgence, it was needful to arouse them by declaring the
atrocity of the sin, that they might learn to beware of all pollution.
Nor are unbridled lusts only here condemned, but God instructs His
people to cherish modesty and chastity. The sum is, that those who
desire to approve themselves to God, should be pure “from all filthiness
of the flesh and spirit,” (<span id="ii.iii.i-p19.1"></span>[2Co
7:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#001)<span id="ii.iii.i-p19.1"></span>;.md)
nor can we doubt but that Paul in these words would interpret the law,
as he elsewhere exhorts,

<span id="ii.iii.i-p20"></span>“that everyone should possess his vessel
in sanctification and honor; not in the lust of concupiscence, even as
the Gentiles which know not God.” (<span id="ii.iii.i-p20.1"></span>[1
Thess. 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#005)<span id="ii.iii.i-p20.1"></span>..md)
