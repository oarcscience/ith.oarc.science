<span id="vii.x-p3"></span>**8.** At that time the Lord separated the
tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand
before the Lord to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto
this day.

<span id="vii.x-p4"></span>**8.** In tempore illo separavit Jehova
tribum Levi: ut gestaret Arcam foederis Jehovae, ut staret coram Jehova
ad ministrandum ei, et ad benediecudum in nomine ipsius usqae ad diem
hanc.

<span id="vii.x-p5"></span>**9.** Wherefore Levi hath no part nor
inheritance with his brethren; the Lord is his inheritance, according as
the Lord thy God promised him.

<span id="vii.x-p6"></span>**9.** Idcirco non fuit ipsi Levi portio et
haereditas cum fratribus suis: Jehova est haereditas ejus,
quemadmodumdixit ei Jehova Deus tuus.

<span id="vii.x-p9"></span>**8.** *At that time the Lord separated the
tribe of Levi* Moses does not exactly observe the order of time in the
chapter from which this passage is taken, since he deemed it sufficient
to collect here and there what was required to complete his general
exhortation. The object indeed of the recital of this history was, lest
any should attempt to overthrow God’s invioable decree in their pride
and audacity; and therefore, in order that the dignity of the tribe of
Levi may not beget envy, he testifies that God is its author. The
clause, “unto this day,” seems to refer to those instances in which God
had manifested His favor towards the Levites, lest any similar rivalry
should hereafter arise. The rest has been expounded elsewhere.
