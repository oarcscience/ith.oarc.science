<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p3"></A><b>1.</b> And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for <i>as</i> <i>for</i> this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of 				  him.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p4"></A><b>1.</b> Videns antem populus quod moram faceret Moses ad descendendum e monte, tunc congregatus est contra Aharon, et dixerunt ei, Surge, fac nobis Deos qui praecedant nos: huic enim Mosi viro illi qui eduxit nos e terra Aegypti, nescimus quid acciderit.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p5"></A><b>2.</b> And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden ear-rings which <i>are</i> in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring <i>them</i> unto me.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p6"></A><b>2.</b> Et dixit illis Aharon, Eripite, (<i>vel</i>, detrahite,) inaures aureas, quae sunt in auribus uxorum vestrarum, filiorum vestrorum et filiarum vestrarum, atque afferte.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p7"></A><b>3.</b> And all the people brake off the golden ear-rings which <i>were</i> in their ears, and brought <i>them</i> unto Aaron.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p8"></A><b>3.</b> Eripuerunt a se igitur totus populus inaures aureas, quae erant in auribus eorum, et attulerunt ad Aharon:</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p9"></A><b>4.</b> And he received <i>them</i> at their hand; and fashioned it with a graving-tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These <i>be</i> thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p10"></A><b>4.</b> Quas accepit de manu eorum, formavitque illud style, et fecit ex illo vitulum fusilem: et dixerunt, Isti sunt dii tui o Israel, qui eduxerunt te e terra Aegypti.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p11"></A><b>5.</b> And when Aaron saw <i>it</i>, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow <i>is</i> a feast to the Lord.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p12"></A><b>5.</b> Quod videns Aharon, tunc aedificavit altare coram eo: et elamavit Aharon, dixitque, Solennitas Jehovae erit cras.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p13"></A><b>6.</b> And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings: and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p14"></A><b>6.</b> Et summo mane surrexerunt sequenti die, atque obtulerunt holocausta, et adduxerunt hostias prosperitatum: seditque populus ut manducaret et biberet, postea surrexerunt ut luderent.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p15"></A><b>7.</b> And the Lord said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted <i>themselves</i>:</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p16"></A><b>7.</b> Loquutusque est Jehova ad Mosen: Vade, descende, corrupit se populus tuus quem eduxisti e terra Aegypti.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p17"></A><b>8.</b> They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These <i>be</i> thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p18"></A><b>8.</b> Recesserunt cito de via quam praecepi eis: fecerunt sibi vitulum fusilem, adoraveruntque illum, et sacrificaverunt ei, dixeruntque, Isti dii tui, Israel, qui eduxerunt te e terra Aegypti.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p19"></A><b>9.</b> And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it <i>is</i> a stiff-necked people:</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p20"></A><b>9.</b> Dixit praeterea Jehova ad Mosen, Vidi populum hunc: et ecce populus durae cervicis est.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p21"></A><b>10.</b> Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of thee a great nation.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p22"></A><b>10.</b> Nunc igitur dimitte me, ut excandescat furor meus in eos, consumamque eos: te autem faciam in gentem magnam.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p23"></A><b>11.</b> And Moses besought the Lord his God, and said, Lord, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p24"></A><b>11.</b> Et precatus est Moses faciem Jehovae Dei sui, et dixit, Utquid, O Jehova, exardescet furor tuus in populum tuum quem eduxisti e terra Aegypti in fortitudine magna et manu forti?</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p25"></A><b>12.</b> Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p26"></A><b>12.</b> Utquid dicent Aegyptii dicendo, In malum eduxit eos, ut occideret eos in montibus, utque consumeret eos e superficie terrae? convertere ab ira furoris tui, et poeniteat te super malo populi tui.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p27"></A><b>13.</b> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven; and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit <i>it</i> for ever.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p28"></A><b>13.</b> Recordare Abraham, Isaac et Israel servorum tuorum, quibus jurasti per teipsum, et dixisti eis, Multiplicabo semen vestrum sicut stellas coeli, et totam terram istam quam dixi dabo semini vestro, et haereditate accipient illam in seculum.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p29"></A><b>14.</b> And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p30"></A><b>14.</b> Et poenituit Jehovam super malo quod dixerat se facturum populo suo.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p31"></A><b>15.</b> And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony <i>were</i> in his hand: the tables <i>were</i> written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other <i>were</i> they written.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p32"></A><b>15.</b> Tunc vertit se Moses, et descendit e monte: erantque dutc tabulae testimonii in mann ejus, tabulae scriptae ab utraque super-ficie sua, hinc et inde erant scriptae.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p33"></A><b>16.</b> And the tables <i>were</i> the work of God, and the writing <i>was</i> the writing of God, graven upon the tables.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p34"></A><b>16.</b> Et tabulae erant opus Dei, scriptura Dei, scriptura erat sculpta in tabulis.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p35"></A><b>17.</b> And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, <i>There</i> <i>is</i> a noise of war in the camp.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p36"></A><b>17.</b> Audiens autem Jehosua vocem populi in vociferatione ejus, dixit ad Mosen, Vox praelii est in castris.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p37"></A><b>18.</b> And he said, <i>It</i> <i>is</i> not the voice of <i>them</i> <i>that</i> shout for mastery, neither <i>is</i> <i>it</i> the voice of 				  <i>them</i> <i>that</i> cry for being overcome; <i>but</i> the noise of <i>them</i> <i>that</i> sing do I hear.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p38"></A><b>18.</b> Qui respondit, Non est vex respendens fortitudini, neque vex respendens infirmitati, sed vocem cantionum ego audio.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p39"></A><b>19.</b> And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses&#8217; anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p40"></A><b>19.</b> Accidit quum appropinquasset ad castra, vidit vitulum et choros: et excanduit iracundia Mosis, abjecitque e manibus suis tabulas, et fregit eas sub monte.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p41"></A><b>20.</b> And he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the fire, and ground <i>it</i> to powder, and strawed <i>it</i> upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink <i>of</i> <i>it.</i></p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p42"></A><b>20.</b> Tulit quoque vitulum quem fecerant, et combussit igni, contrivitque donec redegit in pulverem: et sparsit in superficiem aquarum, et potavit filios Israel.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p43"></A><b>21.</b> And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p44"></A><b>21.</b> Et dixit Moses ad Aharon, Quid fecit tibi populus iste, quod induxisti super eum hoc peccatum grande?</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p45"></A><b>22.</b> And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they <i>are</i> <i>set</i> on mischief.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p46"></A><b>22.</b> Tunc dixit Aharon, Ne excandescat iracundia domini mei: tu nosti populum quod in malo sit.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p47"></A><b>23.</b> For they said unto me, Make us gods which shall go before us: for <i>asfor</i> this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p48"></A><b>23.</b> Dixerunt autem mihi, Fac nobis deos qui nos praecedant: quia isti Mosi viro qui eduxit nos e terra <i>A</i>Egypti, nescimus quid acciderit.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p49"></A><b>24.</b> And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break <i>it</i> off. So they gave <i>it</i> me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p50"></A><b>24.</b> Quibus respondi, Cui est aurum, private vos. Et dederunt mihi: et projeci in ignem, egressusque est vitulus iste.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p51"></A><b>25.</b> And when Moses saw that the people <i>were</i> naked, (for Aaron had made them naked unto <i>their</i> shame among their enemies,)</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p52"></A><b>25.</b> Vidit autem Moses quod populus discoopertus esset: (nam discooperuerat eum Aharon ad ignominiam inter hostes eorum,)</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p53"></A><b>26.</b> Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who <i>is</i> on the Lord&#8217;s side? <i>let</i> <i>him</i> <i>come</i> unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto Him.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p54"></A><b>26.</b> Stetit ergo Moses in porta castrorum, et dixit, Quis est Jehovae? Ad me. Et eongregati sunt ad eum omnes filii Levi.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p55"></A><b>27.</b> And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, <i>and</i> go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p56"></A><b>27.</b> Quibus dixit, Sic dixit Jehova Deus Israel, Ponite quisque gladium suum super femur suum: transite et revertimini a porta ad portam in castris, et occidite quisque fratrem suum, et quisque amicum suum, et quisque propinquum suum.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p57"></A><b>28.</b> And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p58"></A><b>28.</b> Fecerunt ergo filii Levi secundum sermonem Mosis: et ceciderunt e populo in die ilia circiter tria millia virorum.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p59"></A><b>29.</b> For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to the Lord, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p60"></A><b>29.</b> Dixerat autem Moses, Consecrate manum vestram hodie Jehovae, nempe quisque in filio suo, et in fratre suo: ut detur hodie vobis benedictio.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p61"></A><b>30.</b> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the Lord; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p62"></A><b>30.</b> Fuit postridie ut diceret Moses populo, Vos peccastis peccato magno: nunc tamen ascendam ad Jehovam, si forte propitiem eum super peccato vestro.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p63"></A><b>31.</b> And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Oh! this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold!</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p64"></A><b>31.</b> Reversus est itaque Moses ad Jehovam, et dixit: Obsecro: peccavit populus hic peccato magno: feterunt enim sibi deos aureos.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p65"></A><b>32.</b> Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin &#8212;: and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p66"></A><b>32.</b>: Nunc si remiseris peccatum eorum: quod si non, dele me agedum e libro tuo, quem scripsisti.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p67"></A><b>33.</b> And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p68"></A><b>33.</b> Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, qui peccavit mihi, delebo eum e libro meo.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p69"></A><b>34.</b> Therefore now go, lead the people unto <i>the</i> <i>place</i> of which I have spoken unto thee. Behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p70"></A><b>34.</b> Nunc ergo vade, duc populum ad locum de quo loquutus sum tibi. Ecce, Angelus meus ibit ante te: in die autem visitationis meae etiam visitabo in eos peccatum eorum.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p71"></A><b>35.</b> And the Lord plagued the people, because they made the calf which Aaron made.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText15"><a name="vi.ix-p72"></A><b>35.</b> Et percussit Jehova populum, eo quod fecissent vitulum quem fecerat Aharon.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vi.ix-p75"></A><b>1</b> <i>And when the people saw that Moses</i>. In this narrative we perceive the detestable impiety of the people, their worse than base ingratitude, and their monstrous madness, mixed with stupidity. For their sakes Moses had been carried up above the state of terrestrial life, that he might receive the injunctions of 			 his mission, and that his authority might be beyond the reach of controversy. They perversely declare that they know not what has become of him, nay, they speak contemptuously of him as of a person unknown to them. It is for this that Stephen severely blames them,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_323"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">324</FONT></A>
 			  This is that Moses (he says) whom your fathers rejected, though he was the minister of their salvation. (<a name="vi.ix-p76.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#035">Ac 7:35</a><a name="vi.ix-p76.1"></A>.) They confess that he had been their deliverer, yet they cannot tolerate his absence for a little time, nor are they affected with any reverence towards him, unless they have him before their eyes. Moreover,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">325</FONT></A>
 			  although God offered Himself as if present with them by day and by night in the pillar of fire, and in the cloud, they still despised so illustrious and lively an image of His glory and power, and desire to have Him represented to them in the shape of a dead idol. For what could they mean by saying, &#8220;make us gods which shall go before us?&#8221; Could they not see the pillar of fire and the cloud? Was not God&#8217;s paternal solicitude abundantly conspicuous every day in the 			 manna? Was he not near them in ways innumerable</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vi.ix-p78"></A>Yet, accounting as nothing all these true, and sure, and manifest tokens of God&#8217;s presence, they desire to have a figure which may satisfy their vanity. And this was the original source of idolatry, that men supposed that they could not otherwise possess God, unless by subjecting Him to their own imagination. Nothing, however, can be more preposterous; for since the minds of men and all their senses sink far below the loftiness of God, when 			 they try to bring Him down to the measure of their own weak capacity, they travesty Him. In a word, whatever man&#8217;s reason conceives of Him is mere falsehood; and nevertheless, this depraved longing can hardly be repressed, so fiercely does it burst out. They are also influenced by pride and presumption, when they do not hesitate to drag down His glory as it were from heaven, and to subject it to earthly elements. We now understand what motive chiefly impelled the Israelites to this madness in 			 demanding that a figure of God should be set before them, viz., because they measured Him by their own senses. Wonderful indeed was their stupidity, to desire that a God should be made by mortal men, as if he could be a god, or could deserve to be accounted such who obtains his divinity at the caprice of men. Still, it is not probable that they were so absurd as to desire a new god to be created for them; but they call &#8220;gods&#8221; by metonymy those outward images, by looking at which the 			 superstitious imagine that God is near them. And this is evident from the fact, that not only the noun but the verb also is in the plural number; for although they were satisfied with one God, still they in a manner cut Him to pieces by their various representations of Him. Nevertheless, however they may deceive themselves under this or that pretext, they still desire to be creators of God.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text21"><a name="vi.ix-p79"></A><a name="vi.ix-p79.1"></A>Those who suppose that <i>confusion</i><a name="vi.ix-p79.2"></A> is implied by the word &#8220;delayed,&#8221; are, in my opinion, mistaken; for, although the word <a name="vi.ix-p79.3"></A>&#1489;&#1513;&#1513;<a name="vi.ix-p79.4"></A>, <i>boshesh</i><a name="vi.ix-p79.5"></A>, with its third radical doubled, is derived from <a name="vi.ix-p79.6"></A>&#1489;&#1493;&#1513;<a name="vi.ix-p79.7"></A>, <i>bush</i><a name="vi.ix-p79.8"></A>, which means <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>ashamed</i><a name="vi.ix-p79.9"></A>, still it is clear from <a name="vi.ix-p79.10"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#028">Jud 5:28</a><a name="vi.ix-p79.10"></A><a name="vi.ix-p79.11"></A>, that it is used simply for <i>to</i> <i>delay</i><a name="vi.ix-p79.12"></A>, where it is said, in the address of the mother of Sisera, &#8220;Why   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_325"><FONT SIZE="1">326</FONT></A>
 			 <a name="vi.ix-p80.1"></A> does his chariot delay (or defer) to come?&#8221;</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vi.ix-p81"></A>Hence we may understand that hypocrites so fear God as that religion vanishes from their hearts, unless there be some task-master (<i>exactor</i>) standing by them to keep them in the path of duty. They duly obeyed Moses and reverenced his person; but, because they were only influenced by his presence, as soon as they were deprived of it they ceased to fear God. Thus, whilst Joshua was alive, and the other holy Judges, they seemed to be 			 faithful in the exercise of piety, but when <i>they</i> were dead, they straightway relapsed into disobedience.</p>

I doubt not but that Aaron, being overcome by the importunate clamor of the people, endeavored to escape by means of a subterfuge; still, this is no valid excuse for him, since he ought to have heartily opposed them in a direct reply, and sharply to have inveighed against their 			 wicked renunciation of God. By commanding them to give him gold, he might have quieted their intemperate demands through dread of the expense; but it was a remedy more likely to be successful, to snatch from them those ornaments and trinkets of which women do not willingly allow themselves to be deprived. He therefore purposely requires of them a hateful, or at any rate a by no means pleasant thing, that he might thus impede their sinful design; but without success, for the power of 			 superstition to carry people away is not less than that of lust. Perhaps also he had the tabernacle in view, lest they should sacrilegiously proceed to lay hands on the sacred vessels; and there was a probability that, if it remained uninjured, the sight of it might at length recall them to a better mind. Besides, the recollection of their recent profuse liberality might have extinguished or cooled their ardor, from the fear of being utterly drained. He says emphatically, &#8220;Break   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_326"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">327</FONT></A>
 			  off the ear-rings from your wives and children,&#8221; that they may desist from the purpose out of dread of giving offense, since women are slow to part with such objects of gratification. But it is added immediately afterwards, that they were so blinded by the fervor of their foolish zeal, that they undervalued everything in comparison with their perverse desire, and thus the ornaments were taken from their ears. The readiness with which this was done was wonderful; and 			 not by one person, or by a few, but by the whole people, as if in rivalry of each other. Even in these days ear-rings are worn by the   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_327"></A><A HREF="#fn_327"><FONT SIZE="1">328</FONT></A>
 			  Orientals, though it is not so common among us. Now, if unbelievers are so prodigal in their absurdities as to throw away thus carelessly and rashly whatever is precious to them, how shall their tenacity be excusable who are so niggardly in providing for the service of God? Hence let us learn to beware of foolishly squandering our possessions in unnecessary expenditure, and to be liberal where we ought; especially to be ready to spend ourselves, and what we have, 			 when we know that our offerings are pleasing and acceptable to God.</p>

He briefly narrates this base and shameful deed; yet sufficiently shows, that whilst Aaron yielded to their madness, he still desired to cure it, though, at the same time, he was weak and frightened, so as to pretend to give his assent, because he feared the consequences of the tumult as regarded 			 himself. For why does he not command the ear-rings to be thrown into some chest, lest he should pollute himself by the contagion of the sacrilege? Since, therefore, he received them into his own hands, it was a sign of a servile and effeminate mind; and thus he is said to have been the founder, or sculptor of the calf, when it is nevertheless probable that workmen were employed upon it. But the infamy of the crime is justly brought upon him, inasmuch as he was its main author, and by his guilt 			 betrayed the religion and honor of God.</p>

Still they neither speak ironically nor in mockery of God, nor have any intention of falling away from Him; but they cover their sin against Him under a deceitful pretext, as if they denied that by their new and unwonted mode of worship, they desired to detract from the honor of their Redeemer; but rather that it was thus magnified because they 			 worshipped Himself under a visible image. Thus now-a-days do the Papists boldly obtrude their fictitious rites upon God; and boast that they do more for Him by their additions and inventions than as if they merely continued within the bounds prescribed by Himself. But let us learn from this passage, that whatever colouring superstition may give to its idols, and by whatever titles it may dignify them, they remain idols still; for, however those who corrupt the pure worship of God by their 			 inventions, may pride themselves on their good intentions, they still deny the true God, and substitute devils in His place.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="vi.ix-p94"></A>Their conjecture is probable who suppose that, Aaron devised the calf in accordance with Egyptian superstition; for it is well known with what senseless worship that nation honored its god  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">330</FONT></A>

Thus from bad examples does contagion easily creep into the hearts of those who were else untainted; nor is it without good reason that David protests that idols should be held in such abomination by him, 			 that he would not even &#8220;take up their names into his lips,&#8221; (<a name="vi.ix-p96.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004">Ps 16:4</a><a name="vi.ix-p96.2"></A>;) for, unless we seriously abhor the ungodly, and withdraw ourselves as far as possible from their superstitions, they straightway infect us by their pestilential influence.</p>

Of this point Paul is the surest interpreter, who quotes this passage in 			 condemnation of the idolatry of the ancient people, and ably accommodates it to the purpose he had in hand; for the Corinthians had not gone to such an excess as to bow their knees to idols, but were boon-companions of unbelievers in their polluted sacrifices.

This was a violent temptation to shake the faith of Moses. He thought that his own and the people&#8217;s happiness was absolutely complete, when God&#8217;s covenant was engraven on the tables to secure its perpetuity; whereas now he hears that this covenant was violated, and almost annihilated 			 by the perfidy and rebellion of the people, whilst its abolition involved the loss of salvation and all other blessings. Moreover, that God might more sorely wound the mind of the holy man, He addresses him exactly as if part of the ignominy fell upon himself; for there is an indirect reproach implied in the words, &#8220;thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt.&#8221; Yet Moses had only taken this charge upon him by God&#8217;s command, and, indeed, unwillingly; how, then, is this deliverance 			 thrown in his teeth, wherein he had only obeyed God? and why is his devotedness spoken of in mockery, as if he had bestowed his labor amiss, when no part of the blame attaches to him? I have already said that God sometimes thus pierces the hearts of the godly to the quick, in order to prove their patience, as if their well-directed zeal had been the cause of the evils which occur.

 			 <a name="vi.ix-p108.2"></A> give too subtle an exposition to this, viz., that they are called the people of Moses, because they had ceased to be the people of God; and suppose that there is an antithesis here, as if it were said, &#8212; your people, and not mine; but I fear this is not well founded; for, since they had broken the covenant, they were not more alienated from God than from Moses the minister of the Law. I do not deny that it is an implied renunciation of them; but we must bear in mind 			 that design of God, to which I have already adverted, that Moses was in a manner implicated in their crime, in order that his patience might be tried, and also that he might be more grieved at its enormity. Meanwhile, it is obvious that God refers to His recent grace, because it was a monstrous and incredible thing that those who had been lately delivered by this amazing power, and with whom He had just renewed His covenant, should be so suddenly drawn away into rebellion. He adds also, in 			 aggravation of their crime, that they had immediately turned aside from the way which was pointed out to them. Forty days had not yet elapsed since Moses left them, when they were impelled by their depravity to such madness as this. A little time ago they had manifested a wonderful zeal for God&#8217;s service, by abundantly contributing what was required; the glory of the tabernacle was presented to their eyes to restrain them; and yet they burst through all these barriers, and rush impetuously 			 after their own lust, when scarcely six months had passed since the promulgation of the Law.

But it is to be observed, that what they had put forward as a colouring for their 			 ungodliness is alleged last, as the climax of their sin; for, when they said that these were their gods which had brought them up, their object was to advance a legitimate excuse, as if they were not falling away from the worship of the true God, and their Deliverer, but that rather it was an evidence of their more fervent zeal, that they should fall down as worshippers before the calf in honor of Him. But God retorts this upon them, and complains of the gross indignity which was put upon Him, 			 when the dead image of a calf was substituted in the place of His glory.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vi.ix-p112"></A><b>9. </b><i>I have seen this people, and behold</i>. This was, indeed, the sharpest and sorest trial of the faith of Moses; when God seemed to contradict Himself and to depart from His covenant. If ever, after having been long oppressed by excessive calamities, we are not only wearied by the delay, but also agitated with various doubts, which at 			 length tempt us to despair, as if God had disappointed us by deceptive promises, the contest is severe and terrible; but when God seems at first sight to throw discredit upon His own words, we have need of unusual fortitude and firmness to sustain this assault. For, since faith is founded on the Word, when that Word appears to be at issue with itself, how in such conflicting circumstances could pious minds be sustained unless they were supported by the incomparable power of the Spirit? Still in 			 the mind of Abraham there was such strength of faith, that he came forth as a conqueror from this kind of temptation. He had heard from God&#8217;s own mouth, &#8220;In Isaac shall thy seed be called;&#8221; he is afterwards commanded to slay him, and reduce his body to ashes; yet, because he is persuaded that God was able to raise him up seed even from the dead, he obeys the command. (<a name="vi.ix-p112.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#017">Heb 11:17-19</a><a name="vi.ix-p112.1"></A>.) The same thing is here recorded of Moses, before whom God sets a kind of contradiction in His Word, when He declares that He has the intention of destroying that people, to which He had promised the land of Canaan. Nevertheless, we see how successfully he strove, since, trusting in the eternal and inviolable covenant of God, he did not cease to cherish a good hope. If any still should ask whether it was right for him to despise or count for nothing what was said to him in the 			 second place as to the utter destruction of the people, I reply, that the victory of his faith did not consist in subtle disquisitions, but that having embraced God&#8217;s covenant with both arms, as they say, he was so fortified by his confidence that he had room for no objections; and, in point, of fact, pious minds which rest on firm assurance, although unable to free themselves from every perplexity which occurs, still do not waver, but keep a tight grasp on what the Spirit of God has once 			 sealed to them; and, if sometimes it happens that they begin to doubt or vacillate, nevertheless they come back to their foundation and break through every obstacle, so as never to desist from calling upon God. Meanwhile, it is certain that, whilst God is trying the faith of Moses, He quickens his mind to be more earnest in prayer, even as Moses himself was led in that direction by the secret influence of the Spirit. Nor is there any reason why slanderous tongues should here impugn God, as if 			 He pretended before men what He had not decreed in Himself; for it is no proof that He is variable or deceitful if, when speaking of men&#8217;s sins, and pointing out what they deserve, He does not lay open His incomprehensible counsel. He here presents Himself in the character of Judge; He pronounces sentence of condemnation against the criminals; he postpones their pardon to a fitting season. Hence we gather that his secret judgments are a great deep; whilst, at the same time, His will is declared 			 to us in His word as far as suffices for our edification in faith and piety. And this is more clearly expressed by the context; for He asks of Moses to let Him alone. Now, what does this mean? Is it not that, unless he should obtain a truce from a human being, He will not be able freely to execute His vengeance? &#8212; adopting, that is to say, by this mode of expression, the character of another, He declares his high estimation of His servant, to whose prayers He pays such deference as to say that 			 they are a hinderance to him. Thus it is said in <a name="vi.ix-p112.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023">Ps 106:23</a><a name="vi.ix-p112.2"></A>, that Moses &#8220;stood in the breach, to turn away the wrath&#8221; of God. Hence do we plainly perceive the wonderful goodness of God, who not only hears the prayers of His people when they humbly call upon Him, but suffers them to be in a manner intercessors with Him.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vi.ix-p113"></A>He assigns as the reason why He should be implacable, that He well knew the desperate and incurable wickedness of the people; for by &#8220;stiff-necked,&#8221; indomitable obstinacy is metaphorically expressed; and the similitude is taken from stubborn oxen who cannot be brought to submit to the yoke. Now, where such hardness and obstinacy exists, there is no room for pardon. It is indeed an expression which must not be taken literally, that God had 			 learnt by experience that they were a stiff-necked people; but we know that God often assumes human feelings; for unless He should thus come down to us, our minds could never attain to His loftiness. The sum is, that the character of the people was desperate, inasmuch as they had already manifested their inflexible perverseness by many proofs. Still, lest Moses should grieve at the loss of his noble chieftainship, a compensation is promised him; by which trial it appeared that he did not regard 			 his own private interests or advantages.</p>

But, as I have lately stated, inasmuch as he firmly grasped the principle, 			 that it was impossible for God&#8217;s covenant to be made ineffective, he breaks through or surmounts all obstacles with closed eyes as it were. He proves them to be God&#8217;s people by the benefit they had so recently received; yet he mainly relies on the covenant; nay, he mentions their deliverance as a result of it; for he proceeds afterwards to say, &#8220;Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel.&#8221; We see, therefore, that the first ground of his confidence is the promise, although Moses refers first of all to 			 the fact that the people had been delivered by the hand of God. He so expressly particularizes His &#8220;mighty hand,&#8221; and &#8220;great power,&#8221; to signify that the more conspicuous God&#8217;s miracles had been, the more was His glory exposed to the calumnies of the ungodly; and this he immediately afterwards explains, &#8220;Wherefore should the Egyptians speak,&#8221; etc.</p>

But with God repentance is nothing but a change of dealing, wherein He 			 seems to retrace His course, as if He had conceived some fresh design. When, therefore, it is said a little further on that &#8220;the Lord repented of the evil,&#8221; it is tantamount to saying, that He was appeased; not because He retracts in Himself what He has once decreed, but because He does not execute the sentence He had pronounced.

To myself it 			 seems probable that Moses, amazed at the horrible denunciation, immediately offered his prwer; and without receiving a reply promising pardon, came down in suspense to apply a remedy to the evil; for it was by no means likely that, after having heard so severe and weighty a threat, he would have interposed no supplications, when he was so deeply anxious for the safety of the people.</p>

Although, however, God had pronounced 			 sentence of rejection against the people, He still leaves the tables that testified of the covenant untouched in the hands of Moses, not that He wished them to remain whole, as we shall soon see, but that first the sight of them, and then the breaking of them, might inspire the apostates with greater horror, whose madness had otherwise stupified them.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="vi.ix-p127"></A>Why the Law was divided into two tables has been elsewhere seen, viz., because it first sets forth piety and the worship of God; and, secondly, prescribes the rule of righteous living between man and man, and instructs us in the mutual offices of charity. It was doubtless in testimony of the perfection of their doctrine that they were written on both sides. A fuller revelation was indeed afterwards added; but God would have it clearly 			 understood that He had thus embraced all in ten commandments, so that it was not lawful to add anything; and,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_338"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">339</FONT></A>
 			 therefore, lest men should annex anything of their own inventions, God filled both sides, so that nothing remained unwritten upon. Moreover, the tables are called &#8220;the work of God,&#8221; because he had prepared them for the purpose of being written on. Thus they are distinguished from those that came afterwards, on which, although God inscribed His Law, yet He willed that the stones should be chiselled and fashioned by the hand and workmanship of men. The sum is, that not only were the ten 			 commandments written by God on the first tables, but there was nothing human in the fashioning of the stones; and if it be inquired how the stones were engraved and the letters formed upon them, Moses indeed replies by a similitude, that it was done by the finger of God, meaning thereby His secret power; for He who created the world out of nothing by his more volition <i>(nutu,)</i> can by the same word convert all creatures to His own use in whatever way He pleases.</p>

Now, since anger is here mentioned with praise, the stoics must 			 abandon their paradox, that all the passions <i>(motus</i> <i>animi)</i> are vicious. I allow, indeed, that whilst men are led by nature, they are never angry without vice; because they always exceed due bounds, and often also do not aim at a proper object. But it must be observed that this occurs from the corruption of nature; and, consequently, anger is not in itself or absolutely to be condemned. For the 			 principle which the Stoics assume, that all the passions are perturbations and like diseases, is false, and has its origin in ignorance; for either to grieve, or to fear, or to rejoice, or to hope, is by no means repugnant to reason, nor does it interfere with tranquillity and moderation of mind; it is only excess or intemperance which corrupts what would else be pure.

Others think that he was carried away by his wrath, and did not sufficiently consider what he was about, as he would have done had his mind been composed. I have no doubt, however, but that he broke the tables in reference to his office, as if to annul the covenant of God for a time; for we know that God commits both charges to the ministers of 			 His word, to be the proclaimers of His vengeance, as well as the witnesses of His grace. Thus, whatever they bind on earth is bound also in heaven, and they retain sins unto condemnation, and are armed with vengeance against the unbelieving and rebellious.

 			 ) Therefore God rejected the people by the hand of Moses, renouncing the covenant which He had recently established in a solemn ceremony; and this severity was more useful as an example than as if He had sent Moses back empty-handed; for else it would never have suggested itself to the Israelites of how incomparable a treasure they had been deprived. It was then necessary that the tables should be produced, as if God so presented Himself to their sight and shewed His paternal 			 countenance; but when, on the other hand, the monstrous abomination of the calf was encountered, it behoved that these same tables should be broken, as if God turned His back upon them and retired. Meanwhile, it must be borne in mind, that the covenant of God was not altogether annulled, but only as it were interrupted, until the people had heartily repented. Still this temporary rupture, if I may so call it, did not prevent the covenant itself from remaining inviolable. In the same manner also 			 afterwards God put away His people, as if He had utterly renounced. them, yet His grace and truth never failed; so that He at least had some hidden roots from whence the Church sprang up anew; as it is said in <a name="vi.ix-p137.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018">Ps 102:18</a><a name="vi.ix-p137.2"></A>, &#8220;The people which shall be created shall praise the Lord.&#8221;</p>

They had already polluted both their bodies and souls more than enough, without the contagion entering any deeper. 			 Besides, he was thus likely to drive them to despair, when they bore within them the ground of their condemnation, as a woman nourishes her offspring in the womb. Nevertheless, such was the remedy to be applied to their senselessness; for, however they might have been terrified for a moment, the recollection of their crime and their fear of punishment would have immediately vanished had not this brand of their defilement been thoroughly impressed upon them. This, then, was a kind of tautcry, 			 whereby they might feel that the disgrace of such foul idolatry not only cleaved to their skin, but was fixed deep in their very bowels. For thus also was their shame enforced upon them when they admitted the substance of their god into their belly, to be soon afterwards ejected with their excrements. Therefore were they compelled to drink and to void a part of their god, in order that their superstition might be the more offensive to them. Besides, if the ashes had been scattered on the 			 ground, there was danger lest some of the more obstinate might collect the relics; and this evil was prevented when the gold, of which the false god was molten, was mixed with ordure. Finally, Moses is said to have made them drink of the accursed water, not because he himself held out the cup to each of them, but because the dust was cast into the stream of which they all drank; as is stated in <a name="vi.ix-p139.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#021">De 9:21</a><a name="vi.ix-p139.1"></A></p>

We have previously seen that when Moses went up into the mount he resigned his charge to Aaron; it was therefore his duty so to preside over them as, in right of his power, to 			 restrain the people, however perverse they might be. Consequently he is deservedly reproved with this severity, as if he had been the author of the sin which he had suffered to be committed.

The reproof here is very emphatic, viz., that he was as bitter an enemy to the public welfare as if he had desired to avenge himself on his mortal enemies. Not that vengeance would be lawful, although he might have had any colorable ground for it, but Moses 			 means that if Aaron had desired to ruin any persons, and had therefore purposely endeavored to do the worst thing he could against them, he could not have injured them more. Hence He deserves the greater reprehension for having taken such bad care of this poor people, the charge of whom he had undertaken; nay, for having, as far as in him lay, brought final destruction upon them. This, too, is worthy of observation, that when God&#8217;s service is in question, Moses no more spares his own and his 			 only brother than he would an utter stranger. If he had consulted flesh and blood, it would have been easy to invent some pretext for being more lenient towards his brother, since he had been compelled by necessity and violence to make the calf; but, inasmuch as he knew how strenuously we should contend for God&#8217;s glory, he assails his brother as if he were entirely unconnected with him.

Now, although the commencement of his address has 			 an appearance of modesty, still the excuse is frivolous. Rightly, indeed, does Aaron, though the elder, submit himself with reverence to his brother; since he acknowledges him as God&#8217;s minister, and trembles at his reproof; but it would have been better ingenuously to confess his guilt, than to escape the ignominy of condemnation by subterfuge; for it was the business of the chief to guide the whole body, and to quiet the tumult by authority and firmness; and, if their extravagance had even 			 advanced to madness, rather to die ten times over than to yield such base and servile compliance. But from the close it appears that, whilst in our anxiety for our reputation, we take pains to conceal or excuse our faults, our hypocrisy will at length appear ridiculous. It is obvious that when Aaron says he cast the gold into the fire, and the calf came out, he endeavors, at any rate, to cover the fault, which he cannot altogether efface, by this poor and flimsy tale; but by this childish 			 trifling he only betrays his impudence, so that such stupid confidence does but complete his condemnation.

For by 			 the slaughter of three thousand of them, they were reminded that they all had deserved the same. Nor can it be doubted but that he cleansed the camp of the chief authors of the evil, in order that God might be more inclined to pardon. First, therefore, the cause is set forth, whereby he was inflamed to such severity, viz., because he saw the people in such a state of nakedness, as to be even exposed as a laughing-stock to their enemies. The exposition   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_344"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">345</FONT></A>
 			  which some give of their nakedness, <i>i.e.,</i> that they were stripped of their ornaments, is by no means consistent; for it is immediately added, that it was &#8220;to their shame among their enemies;&#8221; and it will be seen in the next chapter that they were still splendidly ornamented; nay, that they wore the outward tokens of profane rejoicing. There is no doubt, then, but that he signifies that they were rejected of God, who 			 was to them, as it were, their sole ornamental garment, and under whose protection they were secure. The enormity of the evil is, therefore, set forth in these words, because they were not only deprived of God&#8217;s assistance, who is culled &#8220;the dwelling-place&#8221; of his people, (<a name="vi.ix-p147.7"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001">Ps 90:1</a><a name="vi.ix-p147.7"></A>,) but also abandoned to ignominy, whilst they were surrounded on all sides by enemies. Hence the holy 			 indignation of Moses, in inflicting punishment on the leaders of the rebellion. And again, it is to be noted, that Aaron is charged with the chief part of the crime, because he had not resisted the people&#8217;s folly with sufficient firmness.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vi.ix-p148"></A>Herein the astonishing power of God was manifested, that when Moses had summoned the Levites, and had commanded them openly in the gate to gird themselves with their swords, the other tribes did not all of them mutiny; for it was probable that they were thus to be armed, in order to execute punishment on the criminals. How, then, came it to pass that those, who were conscious of guilt, were quiet, except because the power of God&#8217;s Spirit 			 restrained their courage and fury?</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vi.ix-p149"></A>The form of the command is also worthy of observation, &#8220;Whoso is the Lord&#8217;s, let him betake himself to me:&#8221; from whence we learn, that if we love religion as it deserves, we must not halt between two sides; but that an ingenuous confession is required of us, so as to range ourselves every one under the banner of God; for, by calling all God&#8217;s servants to him, he condemns the cowardice, nay, the treachery, of all who shall stand in 			 indecision.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vi.ix-p150"></A>The question, however, arises, whether the Levites were not implicated in the crime, since they step forward at once to execute his command, like sincere upholders of God&#8217;s glory. I answer, that though they were not free from guilt, yet, inasmuch as they yielded to the people under the influence of fear, their sin was lighter than as if they had approved by their consent of the detestable idolatry. But here we perceive the wonderful 			 indulgence of God, who not only pardoned them, but deigned to assert His glory by their instrumentality, and appointed them his ministers for the punishment of a crime, in the toleration of which they had been guilty of base effeminacy and cowardice. Again, it may be asked, how it occurred that of the rest of the multitude not one stirred a foot at the command of Moses? My opinion is, that they were kept back not by contempt or obstinacy, but only by shame; and that they were all inspired with 			 so much alarm, that they waited in astonishment to see what Moseswas about, and how far he would proceed. It is, however, probable that the Levites were called out by name, and this we gather from the result; because they all immediately came forwards, and not one of any other tribe.</p>

Nor does he desire that all should be slain promiscuously; but only bids the Levites proceed courageously; so that, if they should chance to meet with any one worthy of death, neither relationship, nor friendship, nor familiarity, should hinder or delay the just course of severity. Nay, since it soon after follows that the Levites did as they were commanded, we gather that 			 he was content with a moderation more akin to leniency than to rigor. If any sedition has arisen in an army, which has proceeded to violence and slaughter, the general is wont, as an ordinary rule, to decimate the offenders; how much milder here is the rate of punishment, when only three thousand perish out of six hundred millions! Although he may have, therefore, dealt harshly with a few, yet the chastisement must appear lenient which permits so many to escape, though guilty of the same crime. 			 It is, however, asked, whether they made any, and what distinction? for it would have been an act of blind and headlong impetuosity to kill every one they might happen to meet.

Now, it is not without reason that the Levites are praised for obeying his command; for it demanded no common magnanimity to attack the whole twelve tribes, to whom they were not equal even by a twelfth part. We gellerally see that when many persons are concerned in a crime, the judges are alarmed by a 			 fear of sedition, and in the end have not the courage to perform their duty.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_347"></A><A HREF="#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">348</FONT></A>

Surely it would have been a lighter cause of offense to have prevented the idolatry of the people by 			 bold rebuke, than to execute capital punishment on the transgressors. Their piety and fear of God, therefore, aroused their hearts to new vigor when they dreaded no peril of death.</p>

 			  a mere quibble to say that a mere ordinary angel is here promised, in whom God will not so manifest His presence as He has done before. Therefore now Moses briefly records what he will afterwards more fully set forth, <i>i.e.,</i> how God was appeased and received the people back into favor, which was not the case until he was commanded to hew out or polish the new tables. And we know that it was a figure of speech in 			 common use with the Hebrews to touch upon the chief points of a matter, and then to fill up, in the progress of the history, what had been omitted.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text21"><a name="vi.ix-p170"></A><a name="vi.ix-p170.1"></A>His prayer commences with confession; for in such a case of wicked ingratitude nothing remained but freely to acknowledge their guilt, so as to look nowhere else for safety in their state of ruin and despair but to the mercy of God; for hypocrites only inflame His wrath the more by extenuating their offenses. The particle <a name="vi.ix-p170.2"></A>&#1488;&#1504;&#1488;<a name="vi.ix-p170.3"></A>, <i>ana,</i><a name="vi.ix-p170.4"></A> which we have followed others in translating &#8220;I beseech,&#8221; <i>(obsecro,) </i><a name="vi.ix-p170.5"></A>is sometimes expressive of exhortation, and used like <i>Agedum,</i><a name="vi.ix-p170.6"></A> (come on;) here it only signifies what the Latins express by <i>amabo</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">355</FONT></A>
 			 <a name="vi.ix-p171.7"></A> After having anticipated God&#8217;s judgment by the confession of their guilt, he nevertheless implores for pardon; and this with extreme earnestness, which is the reason why his address is suddenly broken off, for the sentence is imperfect, as is often the case in pathetic appeals, &#8220;if thou wilt forgive their sin.&#8221; I have no objection to make if any should construe the particle   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">356</FONT></A>

Hence it arises that their prayers begin hesitatingly, until faith prevails.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="vi.ix-p173"></A>What follows may in many respects appear to be absurd; for Moses both imperiously lays down the law to God, and in his eager impetuosity seeks to overthrow, as far as he can, His eternal counsel, and inconsiderately robs him of His justice. Surely all must condemn the pride of this address, Unless thou sparest the offenders, count me not as one of thy servants; nor can there seem to be less of folly in his attempt to bring to nought God&#8217;s 			 eternal predestination. Besides, when he desires that he himself should be involved in the same punishment, what is this but to destroy all distinction, that God should rashly condemn the innocent with the transgressors? Nor would I indeed deny that Moses was carried away by such vehemence, that he speaks like one possessed. Still it must be observed, that when believers unburden their cares into God&#8217;s bosom, they do not always deal discreetly, nor with well-ordered language, but sometimes 			 stammer, sometimes pour forth &#8220;groans which cannot be uttered,&#8221; sometimes pass by everything else, and lay hold of and press some particular petition. Assuredly there was nothing less present to the mind of Moses than to dictate to God; nor, if he had been asked, would he have said that what God had decreed respecting His elect before the creation of the world could be overthrown. Again, he knew that nothing was more foreign to the Judge of all the world than to destroy the innocent together 			 with the reprobate. But since his care for the people, whose welfare he knew to be consigned to him by God, had absorbed, as it were, all his senses, nothing else occupies his mind but that they may be saved, whilst he does not entertain a single thought which interferes with this his great solicitude. Hence it is, that arrogating far too much to himself, he throws himself forward as the people&#8217;s surety, and forgets that he is predestined to salvation by God&#8217;s immutable counsel; and, finally, 			 does not sufficiently consider what would be becoming in God. Nor is Moses the only one who has been thus carried away; but Paul has gone even further, expressing himself thus in writing after full premeditation, &#8220;I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren.&#8221; (<a name="vi.ix-p173.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003">Ro 9:3</a><a name="vi.ix-p173.1"></A>.) The fact is, that intent on the welfare of the elect people, they neither of them examine critically into particulars, 			 and therefore devote themselves in behalf of the whole Church; inasmuch as this general principle was deeply rooted in their minds, that if the welfare of the whole body were secured, it would be well with the individual members. Hence  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">357</FONT></A>
 			 the question arises whether it is a pious feeling to prefer the salvation of others to our own? Some being afraid lest the example of Moses and Paul should be prejudicial, have said that they were only influenced by their zeal for God&#8217;s glory, when they devoted themselves to eternal destruction; and that they did not prefer the people&#8217;s salvation to their own. Even, however, though this should be accepted, still their words would have been hyperbolical; for, although God&#8217;s glory may 			 well be preferred to a hundred worlds, yet He so far accommodates Himself to our ignorance, that He will not have the eternal salvation of believers brought into opposition with His glory; but has rather bound them inseparably together, as cause and effect. Moreover, it is abundantly clear that Moses and Paul did devote themselves to destruction out of regard to the general salvation. Let, therefore, that solution which I have advanced hold good, that their petition was so confused, that in the 			 vehemence of their ardor they did not see the contradiction, like men beside themselves. Nor is it matter of surprise that they should have been in such perplexity, since they supposed that by the destruction of the elect people God&#8217;s faithfulness was abandoned, and He Himself in a manner brought to nought, if the eternal adoption wherewith He had honored the children of Abraham should fail.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vi.ix-p175"></A>By &#8220;the book,&#8221; in which God is said to have written His elect, must be understood, metaphorically, His decree. But the expression which Moses uses, asking to be blotted out of the number of the pious, is an incorrect one, since it cannot be that one who has been once elected should be ever reprobated; and those lunatics who, on this ground, overturn, as far as they can, that prime article of our faiith concerning God&#8217;s eternal predestination, 			 thereby demonstrate their malice no less than their ignorance. David uses two expressions in the same sense, &#8220;blotted out,&#8221; and &#8220;not written:&#8221;</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="vi.ix-p176"></A>&#8220;Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.&#8221; (<a name="vi.ix-p176.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#028">Ps 69:28</a><a name="vi.ix-p176.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text20"><a name="vi.ix-p177"></A>We cannot hence infer any change in the counsel of God; but this phrase is merely equivalent to saying, that God will at length make it manifest that the reprobate, who for a season are counted amongst the number of the elect, in no respect belong to the body of the Church. Thus the secret catalogue, in which the elect are written, is contrasted by <a name="vi.ix-p177.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#009">Eze 13:9</a><a name="vi.ix-p177.1"></A> with that external profession, which is often deceitful.

<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="vi.ix-p178"></A>&#8220;nevertheless (as Paul testifies) this seal standeth sure, The Lord knoweth them that are his.&#8221; (<a name="vi.ix-p178.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019">2Ti 2:19</a><a name="vi.ix-p178.1"></A>.)</p>

Moreover, God reproves the preposterous request of Moses, inasmuch as it does not consist with His justice to reject the innocent; whence it follows, that Moses had prayed inconsiderately. The sum is, that God, whenever He punishes the ungodly and iniquitous, pays them the wages which they have earned; whereas He never punishes the just. Yet it is to be observed, that when God declares that he will be the avenger of sins, His mercy is not excluded, whereby 			 He buries the transgressions of His people, so that they come not into mind. Thus, when Paul says, &#8220;Neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor murderers, nor revilers, shall possess the kingdom of God,&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">358</FONT></A>

The exposition which some give, that an angel is now promised to take care of them, such as Daniel testifies 			 to have been sometimes assigned even to heathen nations, and an instance of which we shall see in the next chapter, is but a poor conjecture; besides, God declares that though the people have departed from the faith, still He stood firm to His agreement as to their enjoyment of the promised inheritance.</p>  		  
<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text19"><a name="vi.ix-p184"></A>His postponement of their punishment is an indirect reproof of the people&#8217;s wickedness, as though He had said that they were of so perverse a nature that they would hereafter give many fresh occasions for it. If any object that, whenever God afterwards punished other sins, He did not then take into account this act of idolatry, I reply that it is no new thing with God, when men contract again fresh guilt, to accumulate their punishments, and 			 also to call to judgment many sins together under one general punishment. Besides, we know that God casts the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation. Lastly, there is nothing to prevent Him from visiting at another time with temporal punishments the iniquity which He has once pardoned; for wherefore did He then forgive them? Was it not lest the truth of His covenant, should perish? Those, then, whom He thus was unwilling to destroy, He might at His own time 			 call up again for punishment, provided the chastisement were but moderate.
