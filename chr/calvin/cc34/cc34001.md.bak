<span id="ii-p1"></span>THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE

<span id="ii-p2"></span>Commentaries on the Gospel according to John are
numerous, and some of them are written with great learning and ability.
Rarely has a separate and extended interpretation been given to any of
the other three Gospels, which are, indeed, so closely interwoven with
each other, that it is scarcely possible to expound one of them in a
satisfactory manner, without bringing the whole into one view, comparing
parallel passages, accounting for apparent contradictions, and supplying
the omissions of each narrative, to such an extent as to produce what
shall be in substance, though not always in form, a Harmony of the Three
Evangelists.

<span id="ii-p3"></span>Few of these difficulties meet the expositor of
John’s Gospel, in which the slender thread of narrative — until it
reaches the period of the last sufferings of our Savior — does little
more than connect long discourses, which He delivered to the multitude
and to his disciples. Whatever opinion may be formed as to the theory of
the elder Tittmann, that John, wrote his work for the express purpose of
proving the supreme Divinity of Christ, we cannot avoid being struck
with the fact, that the miracles which he selects are distinguished by
peculiar grandeur, and that the discourses which he relates contain the
most abundant and delightful exhibitions of the glory of the Son of God,
and of the nature of his mediatorial office, which our great Master was
pleased to make during his personal ministry.

<span id="ii-p4"></span>Lampe, Hutcheson, and Tittmann, are better
known, and more highly esteemed, in this country than any other
Commentator on John that could be named. The three quarto volumes of
Lampe are a monument of judicious toil, and present such stores of
philological, historical, and theological learning as ought never to be
mentioned but with respect and gratitude. Though not free from the
faults of the Cocceian School, of which his miscellaneous treatises
afford some unhappy proofs, his Commentary displays generally such
caution and judgment, that it deserves to be not only consulted, but
perused throughout, and carefully studied. Hutcheson wanted both the
acuteness and the industry requisite for the successful elucidation of
the Holy Scriptures, but is justly admired for the copiousness, variety,
and excellence of his practical observations.

<span id="ii-p5"></span>Tittmann’s *Meletemata* *Sacra in Evangelium
Joannis*, now happily rendered accessible to the English reader,  <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) I must be regarded as one of the most
valuable contributions of modern times to biblical interpretation.
Accurate scholarship, elegant and flowing language, deep reverence for
the inspired volume, and a warmth of affectionate piety closely
resembling that of *the disciple whom Jesus loved*, have gained for that
work a reputation which is likely to increase. To the reader who is
chiefly desirous to ascertain the meaning of Scripture, and who
willingly dispenses with what serves no other purpose than illustration:
Tittmann’s exposition of the first four Chapters of John’s Gospel will
be highly acceptable; though it must be acknowledged that the remaining
portion of the work — not executed till towards the close of the life of
the venerable author — is somewhat less attractive, and, if it has been
prepared with equal care, yet, in consequence of extreme unwillingness
to bring forward explanations which had been already given, it will
sometimes disappoint one who only dips into an occasional passage, and
has not made himself familiar with the profound views unfolded in the
earlier pages.

<span id="ii-p7"></span>These and other eminent writers have been deeply
indebted to Calvin’s Commentary on John’s Gospel, but have left its
claims to the attention of all classes of readers as strong and urgent
as ever. Where they differ from him, they often go astray, and where
they agree with him, they generally fall below the instructive power of
his own pen; for few can equal his clear and vigorous statements. When
he places in a just light — as he frequently does — those texts which
had been wrested for the confutation of heretics, none but eager and
unscrupulous controversialists will complain. Every honorable mind will
admire the unbending integrity of our Author, which, even in the defense
of truth, disdains to employ an unlawful weapon, and devoutly bows to
the dictates of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="ii-p8"></span>The present Work brings under review some of the
most intricate questions in theology; and in handling them he is not
more careful to learn all that has been revealed than to avoid
unauthorized speculation. They who know the difficulty of the path will
the more highly appreciate so skillful a guide, who advances with a firm
step, points out the bypaths which have misled the unwary, conducts us
to scenes which we had not previously explored, and aids us in listening
to a Divine voice which says, *This is the way*, *walk*, *ye in it*.

<span id="ii-p9"></span>In the Harmony of the Three Evangelists, the
reader is so constantly referred to this Commentary, which appeared two
years sooner, that the benefit of the former cannot be fully reaped,
unless the latter be at hand. The Author’s references are sometimes
vague, but the Translator has endeavored to discover and point out the
page in which the desired information may be obtained.
