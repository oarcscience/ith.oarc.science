<span id="x-p1"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="x.i"></span>

<span id="x.i-p1"></span><span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>[John
4:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#001.md)<span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p2"></span>**1.** When, therefore, the Lord knew that the
Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than
John, (**2.** Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)
**3.** He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee. **4.** And it was
necessary that he should pass through Samaria. **5.** He came,
therefore, into the city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near a
field which Jacob gave to his son Joseph. **6.** And Jacob’s well was
there; and Jesus, fatigued by the journey, was thus sitting on the well,
for it was about the sixth hour. **7.** A woman came from Samaria to
draw water. Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink. **8.** For the
disciples had gone into the city to buy food. **9.** The Samaritan woman
saith to him, How dost thou, who art a Jew, ask drink from me, who am a
Samaritan woman? For the Jews hold no intercourse with the Samaritans.

<span id="x.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="x.i-p4"></span><span id="x.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p5"></span>**1.** *When, therefore, the Lord knew.* The
Evangelist, intending now to give an account of the conversation which
Christ had with *a Samaritan woman,* begins with explaining the cause of
his journey. Knowing that *the Pharisees* were ill-disposed towards him,
he did not wish to expose himself to their anger before the proper time.
This was his motive for setting out from Judea. The Evangelist thus
informs us that Christ did not come into Samaria with the intention of
dwelling there, but because he had to pass through it on his way from
Judea to Galilee; for until, by his resurrection, he should open up the
way for the gospel, it was necessary that he should be employed in
gathering the sheep of Israel to which he had been sent. That he now
favored the Samaritans with his instruction was an extraordinary and
almost accidental occurrence, if we may be allowed the expression.

<span id="x.i-p6"></span>But why does he seek the retirement and
lurking-places of Galilee, as if he were unwilling to be known, which
was highly to be desired? I reply, he knew well the proper way to act,
and made such use of the opportunities of usefulness that he did not
allow a moment to be lost. He wished, therefore, to pursue his course
with regularity, and in such a manner as he judged to be proper. Hence
too we hear that our minds ought to be regulated in such a manner that,
on the one hand, we may not be deterred by any fear from going forward
in duty; and that, on the other hand, we may not too rashly throw
ourselves into dangers. All who are earnestly desirous to pursue their
calling will be careful to maintain this moderation, for which they will
steadily follow the Lord even through the midst of deaths; they will not
rush into them heedlessly, but will walk in their ways. Let us,
therefore, remember that we must not advance farther than our calling
demands.

<span id="x.i-p7"></span>*That the Pharisees had heard. The Pharisees*
alone are mentioned by the Evangelist as having been hostile to Christ;
not that the other scribes were friendly, but because this sect was at
that time in the ascendant, and because they were filled with rage under
the pretense of godly zeal. It may be asked, Did they envy Christ that
he had *more disciples,* because their stronger attachment to John led
them to promote his honor and reputation? The meaning of the words is
different; for though they were formerly dissatisfied at finding that
John collected disciples, their minds were still more exasperated, when
they saw that a still greater number of disciples came to Christ. From
the time that John avowed himself to be nothing more than the herald of
the Son of God, they began to flock to Christ in greater crowds, and
already he had almost completed his ministry. Thus he gradually resigned
to Christ the office of teaching and baptizing.

<span id="x.i-p8"></span><span id="x.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p9"></span>**2.** *Though Jesus himself baptized not.* He
gives the designation of *Christ*’*s Baptism* to that which he conferred
by the hands of other, in order to inform us that Baptism ought not to
be estimated by the person of the minister, but that its power depends
entirely on its Author, in whose name, and by whose authority, it is
conferred. Hence we derive a remarkable consolation, when we know that
our baptism has no less efficacy to wash and renew us, than if it had
been given by the hand of the Son of God. Nor can it be doubted that, so
long as he lived in the world, he abstained from the outward
administration of the sign, for the express purpose of testifying to all
ages, that Baptism loses nothing of its value when it is administered by
a mortal man. In short, not only does Christ baptize inwardly by his
Spirit, but the very symbol which we receive from a mortal man ought to
be viewed by us in the same light as if Christ himself displayed his
hand from heaven, and stretched it out to us. Now if the Baptism
administered by a man is Christ’s Baptism, it will not cease to be
Christ’s Baptism whoever be the minister. And this is sufficient for
refuting the Anabaptists, who maintain that, when the minister is a
wicked man, the baptism is also vitiated, and, by means of this
absurdity, disturb the Church; as Augustine has very properly employed
the same argument against the Donatists.

<span id="x.i-p10"></span><span id="x.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p11"></span>**5.** *Which is called Sichar* Jerome, in his
epitaph on Paula, thinks that this is an incorrect reading, and that it
ought to have been written *Sichem*; and, indeed, the latter appears to
have been the ancient and true name; but it is probable that, in the
time of the Evangelist, the word *Sichar* was already in common use. As
to the place, it is generally agreed that it was a city situated close
to Mount Gerizzim, the inhabitants of which were treacherously slain by
Simeon and Levi, (<span id="x.i-p11.1"></span>[Ge
34:25](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#025)<span id="x.i-p11.1"></span>,.md)
and which Abimelech, a native of the place, afterwards razed to its
thundations, (<span id="x.i-p11.2"></span>[Jud
9:45](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#045)<span id="x.i-p11.2"></span>..md) But
the convenience of its situation was such that, a third time, a city was
built there, which, in the age of Jerome, they called *Neapolis* By
adding so many circumstances, the Apostle removes all doubt; for we are
clearly informed by Moses where that field was which Jacob assigned to
the children of Joseph, (<span id="x.i-p11.3"></span>[Ge
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#022)<span id="x.i-p11.3"></span>..md) It
is universally acknowledged, also, that Mount Gerizzim was near to
Shechem. We shall afterwards state that a temple was built there; and
there can be no doubt that Jacob dwelt a long time in that place with
his family.

<span id="x.i-p12"></span>*And Jesus, fatigued by the journey.* He did
not pretend weariness, but was actually fatigued; for, in order that he
might be better prepared for the exercise of sympathy and compassion
towards us, he took upon him our weaknesses, as the Apostle shows that

<span id="x.i-p13"></span>we have not a high priest who cannot be
touched with the feeling of our infirmities, (<span
id="x.i-p13.1"></span>[Heb 4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015.md)<span
id="x.i-p13.1"></span>.)

<span id="x.i-p14"></span>With this agrees the circumstance of the time;
for it is not wonderful that, being thirsty and *fatigued,* he rested at
the well about noon; for as the day, from sunrise to sunset, had twelve
hours, *the sixth hour* was *Noon* When the Evangelist says that *he
sat* thus, he means that it was the attitude of a man who was *fatigued*

<span id="x.i-p15"></span><span id="x.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p16"></span>**7.** A woman came from Samaria. When he asks
water from the woman, he does it not merely with the intention of
obtaining an opportunity to teach her; for thirst prompted him to desire
to drink. But this cannot hinder him from availing himself of the
opportunity of instruction which he has obtained, for he prefers the
salvation of the woman to his own wants. Thus, forgetting his own
thirst, as if he were satisfied with obtaining leisure and opportunity
for conversation, that he might instruct her in true godliness, he draws
a comparison between the visible water and the spiritual, and waters
with heavenly doctrine the mind of her who had refused him water to
drink.

<span id="x.i-p17"></span><span id="x.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p18"></span>**9.** *How dost thou, who art a Jew?* This is
a reproach, by which she retorts upon him the contempt which was
generally entertained by his nation. The Samaritans are known to have
been the scum of a people gathered from among foreigners. Having
corrupted the worship of God, and introduced many spurious and wicked
ceremonies, they were justly regarded by the Jews with detestation. Yet
it cannot be doubted that the Jews, for the most part, held out their
zeal for the law as a cloak for their carnal hatred; for many were
actuated more by ambition and envy, and by displeasure at seeing the
country which had been allotted to them occupied by the Samaritans, than
by grief and uneasiness because the worship of God had been corrupted.
There was just ground for the separation, provided that their feelings
had been pure and well regulated. For this reason Christ, when he first
sends the Apostles to proclaim the Gospel, forbids them to turn aside to
the Samaritans, (<span id="x.i-p18.1"></span>[Mt
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#005)<span id="x.i-p18.1"></span>..md)

<span id="x.i-p19"></span>But this woman does what is natural to almost
all of us; for, being desirous to be held in esteem, we take very ill to
be despised. This disease of human nature is so general, that every
person wishes that his vices should please others. If any man
disapproves of us, or of any thing that we do or say,  <span
id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) we are immediately offended without any
good reason. Let any man examine himself, and he will find this seed of
pride in his mind, until it has been eradicated by the Spirit of God.
This woman, therefore, knowing that the superstitions of her nation were
condemned by the Jews, now offers an insult to them in the person of
Christ.

<span id="x.i-p21"></span>*For the Jews hold no intercourse with the
Samaritans.* These words I consider to have been uttered by the woman.
Others suppose that the Evangelist added them for the sake of
explanation, and, indeed, it is of little consequence which meaning you
prefer. But I think it more natural to believe that the woman jeers at
Christ in this manner: “What? Is it lawful for you to ask drink from me,
when you hold us to be so profane?” If any prefer the other
interpretation, I do not dispute the point. Besides, it is possible that
the Jews carried their abhorrence of the Samaritans beyond proper
bounds; for as we have said that they applied to an improper purpose a
false pretense of zeal, so it was natural for them to go to excess, as
almost always happens with those who give way to wicked passions.

<span id="x.ii"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p1"></span><span id="x.ii-p1.1"></span>[John
4:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010.md)<span id="x.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p2"></span>**10.** Jesus answered and said to her, If
thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me
to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee
living water. **11.** The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to
draw with, and the well is deep; whence, therefore, hast thou living
water?  <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) **12.** Art thou greater
than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank of it,
and his children, and his cattle? **13.** Jesus answered and said to
her, Every one that drinketh of this water will thirst again; **14.**
But he who drinketh of the water which I shall give him will never
thirst; but the water, which I shall give him, shall be in him a well of
water springing up into eternal life. **15.** The woman saith to him,
Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, and may not come hither
to draw.

<span id="x.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.ii-p5"></span><span id="x.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p6"></span>**10.** *Jesus answered.* Christ now, availing
himself of the opportunity, begins to preach about the grace and power
of his Spirit, and that to a woman who did not at all deserve that he
should speak a word to her. This is certainly an astonishing instance of
his goodness. For what was there in this wretched woman, that, from
being a prostitute, she suddenly became a disciple of the Son of God?
Though in all of us he has displayed a similar instance of his
compassion. All the women, indeed, are not prostitutes, nor are all the
men stained by some heinous crime; but what excellence can any of us
plead as a reason why he deigned to bestow on us the heavenly doctrine,
and the honor of being admitted into his family? Nor was it by accident
that the conversation with such a person occurred; for the Lord showed
us, as in a model, that those to whom he imparts the doctrine of
salvation are not selected on the ground of merit. And it appears at
first sight a wonderful arrangement, that he passed by so many great men
in Judea, and yet held familiar discourse with this woman. But it was
necessary that, in his person, it should be explained how true is that
saying of the Prophet,

<span id="x.ii-p7"></span>I was found by them that sought me not; I was
made manifest to them that asked not after me. I said to those who
sought me not, Behold, here I am,  
(<span id="x.ii-p7.2"></span>[Isa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001)<span id="x.ii-p7.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.ii-p8"></span>*If thou knewest the gift of God.* These two
clauses, *If thou knewest the gift of God,* and, *who it is that talketh
with thee,* I read separately, viewing the latter as an interpretation
of the former. For it was a wonderful kindness of God to have Christ
present, who brought with him eternal life. The meaning will be more
plain if, instead of *and*, we put *namely*, or some other word of that
kind,  <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) thus: *If thou knewest the
gift of God*, namely, *who it is that talketh with thee* By these words
we are taught that then only do we know what Christ is, when we
understand what the Father hath given to us in him, and what benefits he
brings to us. Now that knowledge begins with a conviction of our
poverty; for, before any one desires a remedy, he must be previously
affected with the view of his distresses. Thus the Lord invites not
those who have drunk enough, but the thirsty, not those who are
satiated, but the hungry, to eat and drink. And why would Christ be sent
with the fullness of the Spirit, if we were not empty?

<span id="x.ii-p10"></span>Again, as he has made great progress, who,
feeling his deficiency, already acknowledges how much he needs the aid
of another; so it would not be enough for him to groan under his
distresses, if he had not also hope of aid ready and prepared. In this
way we might do no more than waste ourselves with grief, or at least we
might, like the Papists, run about in every direction, and oppress
ourselves with useless and unprofitable weariness. But when Christ
appears, we no longer wander in vain, seeking a remedy where none can be
obtained, but we go straight to him. The only true and profitable
knowledge of the grace of God is, when we know that it is exhibited to
us in Christ, and that it is held out to us by his hand. In like manner
does Christ remind us how efficacious is a knowledge of his blessings,
since it excites us to seek them and kindles our hearts. *If thou
knewest,* says he, *thou wouldst have asked.* The design of these words
is not difficult to be perceived; for he intended to whet the desire of
this woman, that she might not despise and reject the life which was
offered to her.

<span id="x.ii-p11"></span>*He would have given thee.* By these words
Christ testifies that, if our prayers be addressed to him, they will not
be fruitless; and, indeed, without this confidence, the earnestness of
prayer would be entirely cooled. But when Christ meets those who come to
him, and is ready to satisfy their desires, there is no more room for
sluggishness or delay. And there is no man who would not feel that this
is said to all of us, if he were not prevented by his unbelief.

<span id="x.ii-p12"></span>*Living water.* Though the name *Water* is
borrowed from the present occurrence, and applied to *the Spirit*, yet
this metaphor is very frequent in Scripture, and rests on the best
grounds. For we are like a dry and barren soil; there is no sap and no
rigour in us, until the Lord water us by his Spirit. In another passage,
the Spirit is likewise called *clean water*, (<span
id="x.ii-p12.1"></span>[Heb 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022.md)<span
id="x.ii-p12.1"></span>,) but in a different sense; namely, because he
washes and cleanses us from the pollutions with which we are entirely
covered. But in this and similar passages, the subject treated of is the
secret energy by which he restores life in us, and maintains and brings
it to perfection. There are some who explain this as referring to the
doctrine of the Gospel, to which I own that this appellation is fully
applicable; but I think that Christ includes here the whole grace of our
renewal; for we know that he was sent for the purpose of bringing to us
a new life. In my opinion, therefore, he intended to contrast *water*
with that destitution of all blessings under which mankind groan and
labor. Again, *living water* is not so called from its effect, as
*life-giving*, but the allusion is to different kinds of waters. It is
called *living*, because it flows from a *living* fountain.

<span id="x.ii-p13"></span><span id="x.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p14"></span>**11.** *Sir, thou hast nothing to draw
with.* As the Samaritans were despised by the Jews, so the Samaritans,
on the other hand, held the Jews in contempt. Accordingly, this woman at
first not only disdains Christ but even mocks at him. She understands
quite well that Christ is speaking figuratively, but she throws out a
jibe by a different figure, intending to say, that he promises more than
he can accomplish.

<span id="x.ii-p15"></span><span id="x.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p16"></span>**12.** *Art thou greater than our father
Jacob?* She proceeds to charge him with arrogance in exalting himself
above the holy patriarch *Jacob.* “*Jacob*,” she says, “was satisfied
with this well for his own use and that of his whole family: and hast
thou a more excellent water?” How faulty this comparison is, appears
plainly enough from this consideration, that she compares the servant to
the master, and a dead man to the living God; and yet how many in the
present day fall into this very error? The more cautious ought we to be
not to extol the persons of men so as to obscure the glory of God. We
ought, indeed, to acknowledge with reverence the gifts of God, wherever
they appear. It is, therefore, proper that we should honor men who are
eminent in piety, or endued with other uncommon gifts; but it ought to
be in such a manner that God may always remain eminent above all — that
Christ, with his Gospel, may shine illustriously, for to him all the
splendor of the world must yield.

<span id="x.ii-p17"></span>It ought also to be observed that the
Samaritans falsely boasted of being descended from the holy Fathers. In
like manner do the Papists, though they are a bastard seed, arrogantly
boast of the Fathers, and despise the true children of God. Although the
Samaritans had been descended from Jacob according to the flesh, yet, as
they were altogether degenerated and estranged from true godliness, this
boasting would have been ridiculous. But now that they are Cutheans by
descent, (<span id="x.ii-p17.1"></span>[2Ki
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#024)<span id="x.ii-p17.1"></span>,.md)
or at least collected out of the profane Gentiles, they still do not
fail to make false pretensions to the name of the holy Patriarch. But
this is of no avail to them; and such must be the case with all who
wickedly exult in the light of men, so as to deprive themselves of the
light of God, and who have nothing in common with the holy Fathers,
whose name they have abused.

<span id="x.ii-p18"></span><span id="x.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p19"></span>**13***. Every one that drinketh of this
water.* Though Christ perceives that he is doing little good, and even
that his instruction is treated with mockery, he proceeds to explain
more clearly what he had said. He distinguishes between the use of the
two kinds of water; that the one serves the body, and only for a time,
while the power of the other gives perpetual vigor to the soul. For, as
the body is liable to decay, so the aids by which it is supported must
be frail and transitory. That which quickens the soul cannot but be
eternal. Again, the words of Christ are not at variance with the fact,
that believers, to the very end of life, burn with desire of more
abundant grace. For he does not say that, from the very first day, we
drink so as to be fully satisfied, but only means that the Holy Spirit
is a continually flowing fountain; and that, therefore, there is no
danger that they who have been renewed by spiritual grace shall be dried
up. And, therefore, although we thirst throughout our whole life, yet it
is certain that we have not received the Holy Spirit for a single day,
or for any short period, but as a perennial fountain, which will never
fail us. Thus believers thirst, and keenly thirst, throughout their
whole life; and yet they have abundance of quickening moisture; for
however small may have been the measure of grace which they have
received, it gives them perpetual vigor, so that they are never entirely
dry. When, therefore, he says that they shall be satisfied, he contrasts
not with *Desire* but only with *Drought*

<span id="x.ii-p20"></span>*Shall be a fountain of water springing up
into eternal life.* These words express still more clearly the preceding
statement; for they denote a continual watering, which maintains in them
a heavenly eternity during this mortal and perishing life. The grace of
Christ, therefore, does not flow to us for a short time, but overflows
into a blessed immortality; for it does not cease to flow until the
incorruptible life which it commences be brought to perfection.,

<span id="x.ii-p21"></span><span id="x.ii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p22"></span>**15.** *Give me this water.* This woman
undoubtedly is sufficiently aware that Christ is speaking of spiritual
water; but because she despises him, she sets at naught all his
promises; for so long as the authority of him who speaks is not
acknowledged by us, his doctrine is not permitted to enter. Indirectly,
therefore, the woman taunted Christ, saying, “Thou boastest much, but I
see nothing: show it in reality, if thou canst.”

<span id="x.iii"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p1"></span><span id="x.iii-p1.1"></span>[John
4:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#016.md)<span id="x.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p2"></span>**16.** Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy
husband, and come hither. **17.** The woman answered, and said to him, I
have not a husband. Jesus said to her, Thou hast well said, I have not a
husband; **18.** For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now
hast is not thy husband; in this thou hast told the truth. **19.** The
woman saith to him, Sir, I see that thou art a Prophet. **20.** Our
fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you say that Jerusalem is the
place where we ought to worship. **21.** Jesus saith to her, Woman,
believe me, the hour cometh when you shall not worship the Father either
in this mountain or in Jerusalem.

<span id="x.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="x.iii-p4"></span><span id="x.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p5"></span>**16.** *Call thy husband.* This appears to
have no connection with the subject; and, indeed, one might suppose that
Christ, annoyed and put to shame by the impudence of the woman, changes
the discourse. But this is not the case; for when he perceived that
jeers and scoffs were her only reply to what he had said, he applied an
appropriate remedy to this disease, by striking the woman’s conscience
with a conviction of her sin. And it is also a remarkable proof of his
compassion that, when the woman was unwilling of her own accord to come
to him, he draws her, as it were, against her will. But we ought chiefly
to observe what I have mentioned, that they who are utterly careless and
almost stupid must be deeply wounded by a conviction of sin; for such
persons will regard the doctrine of Christ as a fable, until, being
summoned to the judgment-seat of God, they are compelled to dread as a
Judge him whom they formerly despised. All who do not scruple to rise
against the doctrine of Christ with their scoffing jests must be treated
in this manner, that they may be made to feel that they will not pass
unpunished. Such too is the obstinacy of many, that they will never
listen to Christ until they have been subdued by violence. Whenever then
we perceive that the oil of Christ has no flavour, it ought to be mixed
with wine, that its taste may begin to be felt. Nay more, this is
necessary for all of us; for we are not seriously affected by Christ
speaking, unless we have been aroused by repentance. So then, in order
that any one may profit in the school of Christ, his hardness must be
subdued by the demonstration of his misery, as the earth, in order that
it may become fruitful, is prepared and softened by the ploughshare,
 <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) for this knowledge alone shakes
off all our flatteries, so that we no longer dare to mock God. Whenever,
therefore, a neglect of the word of God steals upon us, no remedy will
be more appropriate than that each of us should arouse himself to the
consideration of his sins, that he may be ashamed of himself, and,
trembling before the judgment-seat of God, may be humbled to obey Him
whom he had wantonly despised.

<span id="x.iii-p7"></span><span id="x.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p8"></span>**17.** *I have not a husband.* We do not yet
fully perceive the fruit of this advice, by which Christ intended to
pierce the heart of this woman, to lead her to repentance. And, indeed,
we are so intoxicated, or rather stupified, by our self-love, that we
are not at all moved by the first wounds that are inflicted. But Christ
applies an appropriate cure for this sluggishness, by pressing the ulcer
more sharply, for he openly reproaches her with her wickedness; though I
do not think that it is a single case of fornication that is here
pointed out, for when he says that *she has had five husbands,* the
reason of this probably was, that, being a froward and disobedient wife,
she constrained her husbands to divorce her. I interpret the words thus:
“Though God joined thee to lawful husbands, thou didst not cease to sin,
until, rendered infamous by numerous divorces, thou prostitutedst
thyself to fornication.”

<span id="x.iii-p9"></span><span id="x.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p10"></span>**19.** *Sir, I perceive that thou art a
Prophet.* The fruit of the reproof now becomes evident; for not only
does the woman modestly acknowledge her fault, but, being ready and
prepared to listen to the doctrine of Christ, which she had formerly
disdained, she now desires and requests it of her own accord.
Repentance, therefore, is the commencement of true docility, as I have
already said, and opens the gate for entering into the school of Christ.
Again, the woman teaches us by her example, that when we meet with any
teacher, we ought to avail ourselves of this opportunity, that we may
not be ungrateful to God, who never sends *Prophets* to us without, as
it were, stretching out the hand to invite us to himself. But we must
remember what Paul teaches, that they who have grace given to them to

<span id="x.iii-p14"></span>**20.** *Our fathers.* It is a mistaken
opinion which some hold, that the woman, finding the reproof to be
disagreeable and hateful, cunningly changes the subject. On the
contrary, she passes from what is particular to what is general, and,
having been informed of her sin, wishes to be generally instructed
concerning the pure *worship* of God. She takes a proper and regular
course, when she consults *a Prophet,* that she may not fall into a
mistake in the *worship* of God. It is as if she inquired at God himself
in what manner he chooses to be *worshipped*; for nothing is more wicked
than to contrive various modes of *worship* without the authority of the
word of God.

<span id="x.iii-p15"></span>It is well known that there was a constant
dispute between the Jews and the Samaritans about the true rule of
worshipping God. Although the Cutheans and other foreigners, who had
been brought into Samaria, when the ten tribes were led into captivity,
were constrained by the plagues and punishments of God  <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) to adopt the ceremonies of the Law, and
to profess the worship of the God of Israel, (as we read, <span
id="x.iii-p16.2"></span>[2Ki
17:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#027)<span id="x.iii-p16.2"></span>;.md)
yet the religion which they had was imperfect and corrupted in many
ways; which the Jews could not all endure. But the dispute was still
more inflamed after that Manasseh, son of the high priest John, and
brother of Jaddus, had built the temple on mount Gerizzim, when Darius,
the last king of the Persians, held the government of Judea by the hand
of Sanballat, whom he had placed there as his lieutenant. For Manasseh,
having married a daughter of the governor, that he might not be inferior
to his brother, made himself a priest there, and procured for himself by
bribes as many apostles as he could, as Josephus relates, (Ant. 11:7:2,
and 8:2.)

<span id="x.iii-p17"></span>*Our fathers worshipped in this mountain.*
The Samaritans at that time did, as we learn from the words of the
woman, what is customary with those who have revolted from true
godliness, to seek to shield themselves by the examples of the
*Fathers.* It is certain that this was not the reason which induced them
to offer sacrifices there, but after that they had framed a false and
perverse worship, obstinacy followed, which was ingenious in contriving
excuses. I acknowledge, indeed, that unsteady and thoughtless men are
sometimes excited by foolish zeal, as if they had been bitten by a
gad-fly, so that when they learn that any thing has been done by the
Saints, they instantly seize on the example without any exercise of
judgment.

<span id="x.iii-p18"></span>A second fault is still more common, that
they borrow the deeds of the *Fathers* as a cloak to their errors, — and
this may be easily seen in Popery. But as this passage is a remarkable
proof how absurdly they act who, disregarding the command of God,
conform to the examples of *the Fathers,* we ought to observe in how
many ways the world commonly sins in this respect. For it frequently
happens that the majority, without discrimination, follow those persons
as *Fathers* who are least of all entitled to be accounted *Fathers.*
Thus in the present day we perceive that the Papists, while with open
mouth they declaim about *the Fathers*, allow no place for Prophets and
Apostles, but, when they have mentioned a few persons who deserve to be
honored, collect a vast group of men like themselves, or at least come
down to more corrupt ages in which, though there did not yet prevail so
gross a barbarism as now exists, yet religion and the purity of doctrine
had greatly declined. We ought, therefore, carefully to attend to the
distinction, that none may be reckoned *Fathers* but those who were
manifestly the sons of God; and who also, by the eminence of their
piety, were entitled to this honorable rank. Frequently, too, we err in
this respect, that by the actions of *the Fathers* we rashly lay down a
common law; for the multitude do not imagine that they confer sufficient
honor on *the Fathers,* if they do not exclude them from the ordinary
rank of men. Thus, when we do not remember that they were fallible men,
we indiscriminately mingle their vices with their virtues. Hence arises
the worst confusion in the conduct of life; for while all the actions of
men ought to be tried by the rule of the Law, we subject the balance to
those things which ought to be weighed by it; and, in short, where so
much importance is attached to the imitation of *the Fathers,* the world
thinks that there can be no danger in sinning after their example.

<span id="x.iii-p19"></span>A third fault is — a false, and
ill-regulated, or thoughtless imitation;  <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) that is, when we, though not endued with
the same spirit, or authorized by the same command, plead as our example
what any of *the Fathers* did; as for instance, if any private
individual resolved to revenge the injuries done to brethren, because
Moses did this, (<span id="x.iii-p20.2"></span>[Ex
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#012)<span id="x.iii-p20.2"></span>;.md)
or if any one were to put fornicators to death, because this was done by
Phinehas, (<span id="x.iii-p20.3"></span>[Nu
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#007)<span id="x.iii-p20.3"></span>..md)
That savage fury in slaying their own children originated, as many
think, in the wish of the Jews to be like their father Abraham, as if
the command, *Offer up thy son Isaac*, (<span
id="x.iii-p20.4"></span>[Ge 22:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#002.md)<span
id="x.iii-p20.4"></span>,) were a general command, and not rather a
remarkable trial of a single man. Such a false imitation (<span
id="x.iii-p20.5"></span>κακοζηλία) is generally produced by pride and
excessive confidence, when men claim more for themselves than they have
a right to do; and when each person does not measure himself by his own
standard. Yet none of these are true imitators of *the Fathers,* most of
them are apes. That a considerable portion of ancient monachism flowed
from the same source will be acknowledged by those who shall carefully
examine the writings of the ancients. And, therefore, unless we choose
to err of our own accord, we ought always to see what spirit each person
has received, what his calling requires, what is suitable to his
condition, and what he is commanded to do.

<span id="x.iii-p21"></span>Closely allied to this third fault is
another, namely, the confounding of times, when men, devoting their
whole attention to the examples *of the Fathers,* do not consider that
the Lord has since enjoined a different rule of conduct, which they
ought to follow.  <span id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) To this ignorance
ought to be ascribed that huge mass of ceremonies by which the Church
has been buried under Popery. Immediately after the commencement of the
Christian Church, it began to err in this respect, because a foolish
affectation of copying Jewish ceremonies had an undue influence. The
Jews had their sacrifices; and that Christians might not be inferior to
them in splendor, the ceremony of sacrificing Christ was invented: as if
the condition of the Christian Church would be worse when there would be
an end of all those shadows by which the brightness of Christ might be
obscured. But afterwards this fury broke out more forcibly, and spread
beyond all bounds.

<span id="x.iii-p23"></span>That we may not fall into this error, we
ought always to be attentive to the present rule. Formerly incense,
candles, holy garments, an altar, vessels, and ceremonies of this
nature, pleased God; and the reason was, that nothing is more precious
or acceptable to Him than obedience. Now, since the coming of Christ,
matters are entirely changed. We ought, therefore, to consider what he
enjoins on us under the Gospel, that we may not follow at random what
*the Fathers* observed under the Law; for what was at that time a holy
observation of the worship of God would now be a shocking sacrilege.

<span id="x.iii-p24"></span>The Samaritans were led astray by not
considering, in the example of Jacob, how widely it differed from the
condition of their own time. The Patriarchs were permitted to erect
altars everywhere, because the place had not yet been fixed which the
Lord afterwards selected; but from the time that God ordered the temple
to be built on mount Zion, the freedom which they formerly enjoyed
ceased. For this reason Moses said,

<span id="x.iii-p25"></span>Hereafter you shall not do every one what
appears right in his own eyes, but only what I command you,  
(<span id="x.iii-p25.2"></span>[Deut.
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#008.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#014)<span id="x.iii-p25.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="x.iii-p26"></span>for, from the time that the Lord gave the
Law, he restricted the true worship of himself to the requirements of
that Law, though formerly a greater degree of liberty was enjoyed. A
similar pretense was offered by those who worshipped in Bethel; for
there Jacob had offered a solemn sacrifice to God, but after that the
Lord had fixed the place of sacrifice at Jerusalem, it was no longer
Bethel, *the house of God*, but Bethaven, *the house of wickedness*.

<span id="x.iii-p27"></span>We now see what was the state of the
question. The Samaritans had the example of the Fathers for their rule:
the Jews rested on the commandment of God. This woman, though hitherto
she had followed the custom of her nation, was not altogether satisfied
with it. By worship we are to understand here not any kind of worship,
(for daily prayers might be offered in any place,) but that which was
joined with sacrifices, and which constituted a public and solemn
profession of religion.

<span id="x.iii-p28"></span><span id="x.iii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p29"></span>**21.** *Woman, believe me.* In the first
part of this reply, he briefly sets aside the ceremonial worship which
had been appointed under the Law; for when he says that the hour is at
hand when there shall be no peculiar and fixed place for worship, he
means that what Moses delivered was only for a time, and that the time
was now approaching when the partition-wall (<span
id="x.iii-p29.1"></span>[Eph 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md)<span
id="x.iii-p29.1"></span>) should be thrown down. In this manner he
extends the worship of God far beyond its former narrow limits, that the
Samaritans might become partakers of it.

<span id="x.iii-p30"></span>*The hour cometh.* He uses the present tense
instead of the future; but the meaning is, that the repeal of the Law is
already at hand, so far as relates to the Temple, and Priesthood, and
other outward ceremonies. By calling God Father, he seems indirectly to
contrast Him with the Fathers whom the woman had mentioned, and to
convey this instruction, that God will be a common Father to all, so
that he will be generally worshipped without distinction of places or
nations.

<span id="x.iv-p4"></span><span id="x.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p5"></span>He now explains more largely what he had
briefly glanced at about the abolition of the Law; but he divides the
substance of his discourse into two parts. In the former, he charges
with superstition and error the form of worshipping God which had been
used by the Samaritans, but testifies that the true and lawful form was
observed by the Jews. And he assigns the cause of the difference, that
from the word of God the Jews obtained certainty as to his worship,
while the Samaritans received nothing certain from the mouth of God. In
the second part, he declares that the ceremonies hitherto observed by
the Jews would soon be at an end.

<span id="x.iv-p6"></span>**22.** *You worship what you know not, we
worship what we know.* This is a sentence worthy of being remembered,
and teaches us that we ought not to attempt any thing in religion rashly
or at random; because, unless there be knowledge, it is not God that we
worship, but a phantom or idol. All good intentions, as they are called,
are struck by this sentence, as by a thunderbolt; for we learn from it,
that men can do nothing but err, when they are guided by their own
opinion without the word or command of God. For Christ, defending the
person and cause of his nation, shows that the Jews are widely different
from the Samaritans. And why?

<span id="x.iv-p7"></span>*Because salvation is from the Jews.* By these
words he means that they have the superiority in this respect, that God
had made with them a covenant of eternal salvation. Some restrict it to
Christ, who was descended from the Jews; and, indeed, since

<span id="x.iv-p8"></span>all the promises of God were confirmed and
ratified in him,  
(<span id="x.iv-p8.2"></span>[2Co
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020)<span id="x.iv-p8.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="x.iv-p9"></span>there is no salvation but in him. But as there
can be no doubt that Christ gives the preference to the Jews on this
ground, that they do not worship some unknown deity, but God alone, who
revealed himself to them, and by whom they were adopted as his people;
by the word *salvation* we ought to understand that saving manifestation
which had been made to them concerning the heavenly doctrine.

<span id="x.iv-p10"></span>But why does he say that it was *from the
Jews,* when it was rather deposited with them, that they alone might
enjoy it? He alludes, in my opinion, to what had been predicted by the
Prophets, *that the Law would go forth from Zion*, (<span
id="x.iv-p10.1"></span>[Isa 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md)<span
id="x.iv-p10.1"></span>; <span id="x.iv-p10.2"></span>[Mic
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#002)<span id="x.iv-p10.2"></span>,.md) for
they were separated for a time from the rest of the nations on the
express condition, that the pure knowledge of God should flow out from
them to the whole world. It amounts to this, that God is not properly
worshipped but by the certainty of faith, which cannot be produced in
any other way than by the word of God. Hence it follows that all who
forsake the word fall into idolatry; for Christ plainly testifies that
an idol, or an imagination of their own brain, is substituted for God,
when men are ignorant of the true God; and he charges with ignorance all
to whom God has not revealed himself, for as soon as we are deprived of
the light of his word, darkness and blindness reign.

<span id="x.iv-p11"></span>It ought to be observed that the Jews, when
they had treacherously set aside the covenant of eternal life which God
had made with their fathers, were deprived of the treasure which they
had till that time enjoyed; for they had not yet been driven out of the
Church of God. Now that they deny the Son, they have nothing in common
with the Father;

<span id="x.iv-p12"></span>for whosoever denieth the Son hath not the
Father,  
(<span id="x.iv-p12.2"></span>[1Jo
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023)<span id="x.iv-p12.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.iv-p13"></span>The same judgment must be formed concerning
all who have turned aside from the pure faith of the Gospel to their own
inventions and the traditions of men. Although they who worship God
according to their own judgment or human traditions flatter and applaud
themselves in their obstinacy, this single word, thundering from heaven,
lays prostrate all that they imagine to be divine and holy, *You*
*worship what you do not know* It follows from this that, if we wish our
religion to be approved by God, it must rest on knowledge obtained from
His word.

<span id="x.iv-p14"></span><span id="x.iv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p15"></span>**23.** *But the hour cometh.* Now follows
the latter clause, about repealing the worship, or ceremonies,  <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) prescribed by the Law. When he says that
*the hour cometh,* or *will come*, he shows that the order laid down by
Moses will not be perpetual. When he says that *the hour is now come,*
he puts an end to the ceremonies, and declares that *the time of
reformation*, of which the Apostle speaks, (<span
id="x.iv-p16.2"></span>[Heb 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#010.md)<span
id="x.iv-p16.2"></span>,) has thus been fulfilled. Yet he approves of
the Temple, the Priesthood, and all the ceremonies connected with them,
so far as relates to the past time. Again, to show that God does not
choose to be worshipped either in Jerusalem or in mount Gerizzim, he
takes a higher principle, that the true worship of Him consists *in the
spirit;* for hence it follows that in all places He may be properly
worshipped.

<span id="x.iv-p17"></span>But the first inquiry which presents itself
here is, Why, and in what sense, is the worship of God called
*spiritual*? To understand this, we must attend to the contrast between
the spirit and outward emblems, as between the shadows and the truth.
The worship of God is said to consist *in the spirit,* because it is
nothing else than that inward faith of the heart which produces prayer,
and, next, purity of conscience and self-denial, that we may be
dedicated to obedience to God as holy sacrifices.

<span id="x.iv-p18"></span>Hence arises another question, Did not the
Fathers worship Him *spiritually* under the Law? I reply, as God is
always like himself, he did not from the beginning of the world approve
of any other worship than that which is spiritual, and which agrees with
his own nature. This is abundantly attested by Moses himself, who
declares in many passages that the Law has no other object than that the
people may cleave to God with faith and a pure conscience. But it is
still more plainly declared by the Prophets when they attack with
severity the hypocrisy of the people, because they thought that they had
satisfied God, when they had performed the sacrifices and made an
outward display. It is unnecessary to quote here many proofs which are
to be found everywhere, but the most remarkable passages are the
following: — <span id="x.iv-p18.1"></span>[Ps.
50:0](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#000.md), [Isa.
1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000.md), [Isa.
58:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#000.md), [Isa.
66:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#000.md), [Mic.
5:0](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#000.md), [Amos
7:0](../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#000.md)<span id="x.iv-p18.1"></span>. But
while the worship of God under the Law was spiritual, it was enveloped
in so many outward ceremonies, that it resembled something carnal and
earthly. For this reason Paul calls the ceremonies *flesh* and *the
beggarly elements of the world*, (<span id="x.iv-p18.2"></span>[Ga
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009)<span id="x.iv-p18.2"></span>..md) In
like manner, the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews says that the
ancient *sanctuary*, with its appendages, was *earthly*, (<span
id="x.iv-p18.3"></span>[Heb 9:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#001.md)<span
id="x.iv-p18.3"></span>.) Thus we may justly say that the worship of the
Law was spiritual in its substance, but, in respect of its form, it was
somewhat earthly and carnal; for the whole of that economy, the reality
of which is now fully manifested, consisted of shadows.

<span id="x.iv-p19"></span>We now see what the Jews had in common with
us, and in what respect they differed from us. In all ages God wished to
be worshipped by faith, prayer, thanksgiving, purity of heart, and
innocence of life; and at no time did he delight in any other
sacrifices. But under the Law there were various additions, so that the
*spirit and truth* were concealed under forms and shadows, whereas, now
that *the vail of the temple has been rent*, (<span
id="x.iv-p19.1"></span>[Mt 27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051.md)<span
id="x.iv-p19.1"></span>,) nothing is hidden or obscure. There are indeed
among ourselves, in the present day, some outward exercises of
godliness, which our weakness renders necessary, but such is the
moderation and sobriety of them, that they do not obscure the plain
truth of Christ. In short, what was exhibited to the fathers under
figures and shadows is now openly displayed.

<span id="x.iv-p20"></span>Now in Popery this distinction is not only
confounded, but altogether overturned; for there the shadows are not
less thick than they formerly were under the Jewish religion. It cannot
be denied that Christ here lays down an obvious distinction between us
and the Jews. Whatever may be the subterfuges by which the Papists
attempt to escape, it is evident that we differ from the gathers in
nothing more than outward form, because while they worshipped God
spiritually, they were bound to perform ceremonies, which were abolished
by the coming of Christ. Thus all who oppress the Church with an
excessive multitude of ceremonies, do what is in their power to deprive
the Church of the presence of Christ. I do not stop to examine the vain
excuses which they plead, that many persons in the present day have as
much need of those aids as the Jews had in ancient times. It is always
our duty to inquire by what order the Lord wished his Church to be
governed, for He alone knows thoroughly what is expedient for us. Now it
is certain that nothing is more at variance with the order appointed by
God than the gross and singularly carnal pomp which prevails in Popery.
The *spirit* was indeed concealed by the shadows of the Law, but the
masks of Popery disfigure it altogether; and, therefore, we must not
wink at such gross and shameful corruptions. Whatever arguments may be
employed by ingenious men, or by those who have not sufficient courage
to correct vices — that they are doubtful matters, and ought to be held
as indifferent — certainly it cannot be endured that the rule laid down
by Christ shall be violated.

<span id="x.iv-p21"></span>*The true worshippers.* Christ appears
indirectly to reprove the obstinacy of many, which was afterwards
displayed; for we know how obstinate and contentious the Jews were, when
the Gospel was revealed, in defending the ceremonies to which they had
been accustomed. But this statement has a still more extensive meaning;
for, knowing that the world would never be entirely free from
superstitions, he thus separates the devout and upright *worshippers*
from those who were false and hypocritical. Armed with this testimony,
let us not hesitate to condemn the Papists in all their inventions, and
boldly to despise their reproaches. For what reason have we to fear,
when we learn that God is pleased with this plain and simple worship,
which is disdained by the Papists, because it is not attended by a
cumbrous mass of ceremonies? And of what use to them is the idle
splendor of the flesh, by which Christ declares that the Spirit is
quenched? What it is *to worship God in spirit and truth* appears
clearly from what has been already said. It is to lay aside the
entanglements of ancient ceremonies, and to retain merely what is
spiritual in the worship of God; for the *truth* of the worship of God
consists in *the spirit,* and ceremonies are but a sort of appendage.
And here again it must be observed, that *truth* is not compared with
*falsehood*, but with the outward addition of the figures of the Law;
 <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) so that — to use a common
expression — it is the pure and simple substance of spiritual worship.

<span id="x.iv-p23"></span><span id="x.iv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p24"></span>**24.** *God is a Spirit.* This is a
confirmation drawn from the very nature of God. Since men are flesh, we
ought not to wonder, if they take delight in those things which
correspond to their own disposition. Hence it arises, that they contrive
many things in the worship of God which are full of display, but have no
solidity. But they ought first of all to consider that they have to do
with God, who can no more agree with the flesh than fire with water.
This single consideration, when the inquiry relates to the worship of
God, ought to be sufficient for restraining the wantonness of our mind,
that God is so far from being like us, that those things which please us
most are the objects of his loathing and abhorrence. And if hypocrites
are so blinded by their own pride, that they are not afraid to subject
God to their opinion, or rather to their unlawful desires, let us know
that this modesty does not hold the lowest place in the true worship of
God, to regard with suspicion whatever is gratifying according to the
flesh. Besides, as we cannot ascend to the height of God, let us
remember that we ought to seek from His word the rule by which we are
governed. This passage is frequently quoted by the Fathers against the
Arians, to prove the Divinity of the Holy Spirit, but it is improper to
strain it for such a purpose; for Christ simply declares here that his
Father is of a spiritual nature, and, therefore, is not moved by
frivolous matters, as men, through the lightness and unsteadiness of
their character, are wont to be.

<span id="x.iv-p25"></span><span id="x.iv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p26"></span>**25.** *The Messiah is about to come.*
Although religion among the Samaritans was corrupted and mixed up with
many errors, yet some principles taken from the Law were impressed on
their minds, such as that which related to the Messiah. Now it is
probable that, when the woman ascertained from Christ’s discourse that a
very extraordinary change was about to take place in the Church of God,
her mind instantly recurred to the recollection of Christ, under whom
she hoped that all things would be fully restored. When she says that
*the Messiah is about to come,* she seems to speak of the time as near
at hand; and, indeed, it is sufficiently evident from many arguments,
that the minds of men were everywhere aroused by the expectation of the
Messiah, who would restore the affairs which were wretchedly decayed, or
rather, which were utterly ruined.

<span id="x.iv-p27"></span>This, at least, is beyond all controversy,
that the woman prefers Christ to Moses and to all the Prophets in the
office of teaching; for she comprehends three things in a few words.
First, that the doctrine of the Law was not absolutely perfect, and that
nothing more than first principles was delivered in it; for if there had
not been some farther progress to be made, she would not have said that
*the Messiah will tell us all things.* There is an implied contrast
between him and the Prophets, that it is his peculiar office to conduct
his disciples to the goal, while the Prophets had only given them the
earliest instructions, and, as it were, led them into the course.
Secondly, the woman declares that she expects such a *Christ* as will be
the interpreter of his Father, and the teacher and instructor of all the
godly. Lastly, she expresses her belief that we ought not to desire any
thing better or more perfect than his doctrine, but that, on the
contrary, this is the farthest object of wisdom, beyond which it is
unlawful to proceed.

<span id="x.iv-p28"></span>I wish that those who now boast of being the
pillars of the Christian Church, would at least imitate this poor woman,
so as to be satisfied with the simple doctrine of Christ, rather than
claim I know not what power of superintendence for putting forth their
inventions. For whence was the religion of the Pope and Mahomet
collected but from the wicked additions, by which they imagined that
they brought the doctrine of the Gospel to a state of perfection? As if
it would have been incomplete without such fooleries. But whoever shall
be well taught in the school of Christ will ask no other instructors,
and indeed will not receive them.

<span id="x.iv-p29"></span><span id="x.iv-p29.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p30"></span>**26.** *It is I who talk with thee.* When he
acknowledges to the woman that; he is the Messiah, he unquestionably
presents himself as her Teacher, in compliance with the expectation
which she had formed; and, therefore, I think it probable, that he
proceeded to give more full instruction, in order to satisfy her thirst.
Such a proof of his grace he intended to give in the case of this poor
woman, that he might testify to all that he never fails to discharge his
office, when we desire to have him for our Teacher. There is, therefore,
no danger that he will disappoint one of those whom he finds ready to
become his disciples. But they who refuse to submit to him, as we see
done by many haughty and irreligious men, or who hope to find elsewhere
a wisdom more perfect — as the Mahometans and Papists do — deserve to be
driven about by innumerable enchantments, and at length to be plunged in
an abyss of errors. Again, by these words, “*I who talk with thee am*
the Messiah, the Son of God,” he employs the name *Messiah* as a seal to
ratify the doctrine of his Gospel; for we must remember that he was
anointed by the Father, and that *the Spirit of God rested on him*, that
he might bring to us the message of salvation, as Isaiah declares,
(<span id="x.iv-p30.1"></span>[Isa

<span id="x.v-p2"></span>**27.** And, in the meantime, his disciples
came, and wondered that he talked with the woman. But no man said, What
seekest thou, or why talkest thou with her? **28.** The woman,
therefore, left her pitcher, and went away into the city, and said to
the men, **29.** Come, and see a man who hath told me all things that I
ever did: is not this the Christ? **30.** They went out of the city,
therefore, and came to him. **31.** In the meantime his disciples asked
him, saying, Master, eat. **32.** But he said to them, I have food to
eat which you know not. **33.** The disciples, therefore, said among
themselves, Hath any man brought him any thing to eat? **34.** Jesus
saith to them, My food is, to do the will of him who sent me, and to
finish his work.

<span id="x.v-p3"></span> 

<span id="x.v-p4"></span><span id="x.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="x.v-p5"></span>**27.** *His disciples came, and wondered.*
That *the disciples wondered*, as the Evangelist relates, might arise
from one of two causes; either that they were offended at the mean
condition of the woman, or that they reckoned the Jews to be polluted,
if they entered into conversation with the Samaritans. Now though both
of these feelings proceeded from a devout reverence for their Master,
yet they are wrong in *wondering* at it as an improper thing, that he
deigns to bestow so great honor on a woman who was utterly despised. For
why do they not rather look at themselves? They would certainly have
found no less reason to be astonished, that they who were men of no
note, and almost the offscourings of the people, were raised to the
highest rank of honor. And yet it is useful to observe what the
Evangelist says — that they did not venture to put a question; for we
are taught by their example that, if any thing in the works or words of
God and of Christ be disagreeable to our feelings, we ought not to give
ourselves a loose rein so as to have the boldness to murmur, but ought
to preserve a modest silence, until what is hidden from us be revealed
from heaven. The foundation of such modesty lies in the fear of God and
in reverence for Christ.

<span id="x.v-p6"></span><span id="x.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="x.v-p7"></span>**28.** *Therefore the woman left her pitcher.*
This circumstance is related by the Evangelist to express the ardor of
her zeal; for it is an indication of haste, that she leaves her pitcher,
and returns to the city. And this is the nature of faith, that when we
have become partakers of eternal life, we wish to bring others to share
with us; nor is it possible that the knowledge of God shall lie buried
and inactive in our hearts without being manifested before men, for that
saying must be true:

<span id="x.v-p8"></span>I believed, and therefore I will speak, (<span
id="x.v-p8.1"></span>[Ps 116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010.md)<span
id="x.v-p8.1"></span>.)

<span id="x.v-p9"></span>The earnestness and promptitude of the woman
are so much the more worthy of attention, that it was only a small spark
of faith that kindled them; for scarcely had she tasted Christ when she
spreads his game throughout the whole city. In those who have already
made moderate progress in his school, sluggishness will be highly
disgraceful. But she may appear to deserve blame on this account, that
while she is still ignorant and imperfectly taught, she goes beyond the
limits of her faith. I reply, she would have acted inconsiderately, if
she had assumed the office of a teacher, but when she desires nothing
more than to excite her fellow-citizens to hear Christ speaking, we will
not say that she forgot herself, or proceeded farther than she had a
right to do. She merely does the office of a trumpet or a bell to invite
others to come to Christ.

<span id="x.v-p10"></span><span id="x.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="x.v-p11"></span>**29.** *See a man.* As she here speaks
doubtfully, she might appear not to have been greatly moved by the
authority of Christ. I reply, as she was not qualified to discourse
about such high mysteries, she endeavors, according to her feeble
capacity, to bring her fellow-citizens to permit themselves to be taught
by Christ. It was a very powerful stimulant which she employed to excite
them, when she knew, by a sign which was not obscure or doubtful, that
he was a *prophet*; for, since they could not form a judgment from his
doctrine, this lower preparation was useful and well adapted to them.
Having, therefore, learned that Christ had revealed to the woman things
which were hidden, they infer from it that he is *a Prophet* of God.
This having been ascertained, they begin to attend to his doctrine. But
the woman goes farther; for she bids them inquire if he be not the
Messiah, being satisfied if she could only persuade them to seek, of
their own accord, what she had already found in Christ; for she knew
that they would find more than she promised.

<span id="x.v-p12"></span>*Who told me all things that ever I did.* Why
does she tell a lie, by saying that Christ told her *all things*? I have
already shown that Christ did not reprove her for a single instance of
fornication, but that he placed before her, in a few words, many sins of
her whole life. For the Evangelist has not minutely recorded every
sentence, but states generally that Christ, in order to repress the
woman’s talkativeness, brought forward her former and present life. Yet
we see that the woman, kindled by a holy zeal, does not spare herself,
or her reputation, to magnify the name of Christ: for she does not
scruple to relate the disgraceful passages of her life.

<span id="x.v-p13"></span><span id="x.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="x.v-p14"></span>**32.** *I have food to eat which you know
not.* It is wonderful that, when he is fatigued and hungry, he refuses
to eat; for if it be said that he does this for the purpose of
instructing us, by his example, to endure hunger, why then did he not do
so always? But he had another object than to say that we ought simply to
refuse food; for we must attend to this circumstance, that his anxiety
about the present business urges him so strongly, and absorbs his whole
mind, so that it gives him no uneasiness to despise food. And yet he
does not say that he is so eager to obey the commands of *his Father*,
that he neither eats nor drinks. He only points out what he must do
first, and what must be done afterwards; and thus he shows, by his
example, that the kingdom of God ought to be preferred to all the
comforts of the body. God allows us, indeed, to eat and drink, provided
that we are not withdrawn from what is of the highest importance; that
is, that every man attend to his own calling.

<span id="x.v-p15"></span>It will perhaps be said, that eating and
drinking cannot but be avocations which withdraw some portion of our
time that might be better employed. This I acknowledge to be true, but
as the Lord kindly permits us to take care of our body, so far as
necessity requires, he who endeavors to nourish his body with sobriety
and moderation does not fail to give that preference which he ought to
give to obedience to God. But we must also take care not to adhere so
firmly to our fixed hours, as not to be prepared to deprive ourselves of
food, when God holds out to us any opportunity, and, as it were, fixes
the present hour. Christ, having now in his hands such an opportunity
which might pass away, embraces it with open arms, and holds it fast.
When the present duty enjoined on him by the Father presses him so hard
that he finds it necessary to lay aside every thing else, he does not
scruple to delay taking food; and, indeed, it would have been
unreasonable that, when the woman left her pitcher and ran to call the
people, Christ should display less zeal. In short, if we propose it as
our object not to lose the causes of life on account of life itself, it;
will not be difficult to preserve the proper medium; for he who shall
place it before him as the end of life to serve the Lord, from which we
are not at liberty to turn aside even for the immediate danger of death,
will certainly reckon it to be of more value than eating and drinking.
The metaphor of eating and drinking is so much the more graceful on this
occasion, that it was drawn seasonably from the present discourse.

<span id="x.v-p16"></span><span id="x.v-p16.1"></span>

<span id="x.v-p17"></span>**34.** *My food is to do the will of him who
sent me.* He means not only that he esteems it very highly, but that
there is nothing in which he takes greater delight, or in which he is
more cheerfully or more eagerly employed; as David, in order to magnify
the Law of God, says not only that he values it highly, but that it is
*sweeter than honey*, (<span id="x.v-p17.1"></span>[Ps
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#010)<span id="x.v-p17.1"></span>..md)
If, therefore, we would follow Christ, it is proper not only that we
devote ourselves diligently to the service of God, but that we be so
cheerful in complying with its injunctions that the labor shall not be
at all oppressive or disagreeable.

<span id="x.v-p18"></span>*That I may finish his work.* By adding these
words, Christ fully explains what is that *will of the Father* to which
he is devoted; namely, to fulfill the commission which had been given to
him. Thus every man ought to consider his own calling, that he may not
consider as done to God what he has rashly undertaken at his own
suggestion. What was the office of Christ is well known. It was to
advance the kingdom of God, to restore to life lost souls, to spread the
light of the Gospel, and, in short, to bring salvation to the world. The
excellence of these things caused him, when fatigued and hungry, to
forget meat and drink. Yet we derive from this no ordinary consolation,
when we learn that Christ was so anxious about the salvation of men,
that it gave him the highest delight to procure it; for we cannot doubt
that he is now actuated by similar feelings towards us.

<span id="x.vi"></span>

<span id="x.vi-p1"></span><span id="x.vi-p1.1"></span>[John
4:35-38](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#035.md)<span id="x.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.vi-p2"></span>**35.** Do you not say, There are yet four
months, and harvest will come? Lo, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and
look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest. **36.** And
he who reapeth receiveth reward, and gathereth fruit into life eternal;
that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together.
**37.** For in this is the saying true, That there is one who soweth,
and another who reapeth. **38.** I sent you to reap that on which you
did not labor; other men labored, and you have entered into their
labors.

<span id="x.vi-p3"></span> 

<span id="x.vi-p4"></span><span id="x.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="x.vi-p5"></span>**35.** *Do you not say?* He follows out the
preceding statement; for, having said that nothing was more dear to him
than *to finish the work* of the Father, he now shows how *ripe* it is
for execution; and he does so by a comparison with *the harvest.* When
the corn is ripe, the harvest cannot bear delay, for otherwise the grain
would fall to the ground and be lost; and, in like manner, the spiritual
corn being now ripe, he declares that there must be no delay, because
delay is injurious. We see for what purpose the comparison is employed;
it is to explain the reason why he hastens to perform his work.  <span
id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) By this expression, *Do you not say?* he
intended indirectly to point out how much more attentive the minds of
men are to earthly than to heavenly things; for they burn with so
intense a desire of *harvest* that they carefully reckon up months and
days, but it is astonishing how drowsy and indolent they are in
gathering the heavenly wheat. And daily experience proves that this
wickedness not only is natural to us, but can scarcely be torn from our
hearts; for while all provide for the earthly life to a distant period,
how indolent are we in thinking about heavenly things? Thus Christ says
on another occasion, Hypocrites, you discern by the face of the sky what
sort of day to-morrow will be, but you do not acknowledge the time of my
visitation, (<span id="x.vi-p6.2"></span>[Mt
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#003)<span id="x.vi-p6.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.vi-p7"></span><span id="x.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="x.vi-p8"></span>**36.** *And he who reapeth receiveth reward.*
How diligently we ought to devote ourselves to the work of God, he
proves by another argument; namely, because a large and most excellent
reward is reserved for our labor; for he promises that there will be
*fruit,* and *fruit* not corruptible or fading. What he adds about
*fruit* may be explained in two ways; either it is an announcement of
the *reward,* and on that supposition he would say the same thing twice
in different words; or, he applauds the labors of those who enrich the
kingdom of God, as we shall afterwards find him repeating,

<span id="x.vi-p9"></span>I have chosen you, that you may go and bear
fruit, and that your fruit may remain, (<span id="x.vi-p9.1"></span>[Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016)<span id="x.vi-p9.1"></span>..md)

<span id="x.vi-p10"></span>And certainly both considerations ought
greatly to encourage the ministers of the word, that they may never sink
under the toil, when they hear that a crown of glory is prepared for
them in heaven, and know that the *fruit* of their *harvest* will not
only be precious in the sight of God, but will also be eternal. It is
for this purpose that Scripture everywhere mentions *reward,* and not
for the purpose of leading us to judge from it as to the merits of
works; for which of us, if we come to a reckoning, will not be found
more worthy of being punished for slothfulness than of being *rewarded*
for diligence? To the best laborers nothing else will be left than to
approach to God in all humility to implore forgiveness. But the Lord,
who acts towards us with the kindness of a father, in order to correct
our sloth, and to encourage us who would otherwise be dismayed, deigns
to bestow upon us an undeserved reward.

<span id="x.vi-p11"></span>This is so far from overturning justification
by faith that it rather confirms it. For, in the first place, how comes
it that God finds in us any thing to *reward,* but because He has
bestowed it upon us by his Spirit? Now we know that the Spirit is the
earnest and pledge of adoption, (<span id="x.vi-p11.1"></span>[Eph
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014)<span id="x.vi-p11.1"></span>..md)
Secondly, how comes it that God confers so great honor on imperfect and
sinful works but because, after having by free grace reconciled us to
himself, He accepts our works without any regard to merit, by not
imputing the sins which cleave to them? The amount of this passage is,
that the labor which the Apostles bestow on teaching ought not to be
reckoned by them hard and unpleasant, since they know that it is so
useful and so advantageous to Christ and to the Church.

<span id="x.vi-p12"></span>*That he who soweth, and he who reapeth, may
rejoice together.* By these words Christ shows that the *fruit* which
the Apostles will derive from *the labors of others* cannot give just
ground of complaint to any person. And this additional statement
deserves notice; for if in the world the groans of those who complain
that the *fruit* of their labor has been conveyed to another do not
hinder the new possessor from cheerfully *reaping* what another has
*sown,* how much more cheerful ought the *reapers* to be, when there is
mutual consent and mutual joy and congratulation?

<span id="x.vi-p13"></span>But, in order that this passage may be
properly understood, we must comprehend the contrast between *sowing*
and *reaping* The *sowing* was the doctrine of the Law and the Prophets;
for at that time the seed thrown into the soil remained, as it were, in
the blade; but the doctrine of the Gospel, which brings men to proper
maturity, is on that account justly compared to the *harvest.* For the
Law was very far from that perfection which has at length been exhibited
to us in Christ. To the same purpose is the well-known comparison
between infancy and manhood which Paul employs, when he says, that

<span id="x.vi-p14"></span>the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
not from a servant, though he be lord of all, but is under tutors and
governors until the time appointed by the father,  
(<span id="x.vi-p14.2"></span>[Gal.
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#002)<span id="x.vi-p14.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.vi-p15"></span>In short, since the coming of Christ brought
along with it present salvation, we need not wonder if the Gospel, by
which the door of the heavenly kingdom is opened, be called the
*harvest* of the doctrine of the Prophets. And yet it is not at all
inconsistent with this statement, that the Fathers under the Law were
gathered into God’s barn; but this comparison must be referred to the
manner of teaching; for, as the infancy of the Church lasted to the end
of the Law, but, as soon as the Gospel had been preached, it immediately
arrived at manhood, so at that time the salvation began to ripen, of
which the *sowing* only had been accomplished by the Prophets.

<span id="x.vi-p16"></span>But, as Christ delivered this discourse in
Samaria, he appears to extend the *sowing* more widely than to the Law
and the Prophets; and there are some who interpret these words as
applying equally to the Jews and to the Gentiles. I acknowledge, indeed,
that some grains of piety were always scattered throughout the whole
world, and there can be no doubt that — if we may be allowed the
expression — God *sowed,* by the hand of philosophers and profane
writers, the excellent sentiments which are to be found in their
writings. But, as that seed was degenerated from the very root, and as
the corn which could spring from it, though not good or natural, was
choked by a huge mass of errors, it is unreasonable to suppose that such
destructive corruption is compared to *sowing* Besides, what is here
said about uniting in joy cannot at all apply to philosophers or any
persons of that class.

<span id="x.vi-p17"></span>Still, the difficulty is not yet solved, for
Christ makes special reference to the Samaritans. I reply, though
everything among them was infected by corruptions, there still was some
hidden seed of piety. For whence does it arise that, as soon as they
hear a word about Christ, they are so eager to seek him, but because
they had learned, from the Law and the Prophets, that the Redeemer would
come? Judea was indeed the Lord’s peculiar field, which he had
cultivated by the Prophets, but, as some small portion of seed had been
carried into Samaria, it is not without reason that Christ says that
there also it reached maturity. If it be objected that the Apostles were
chosen to publish the Gospel throughout the whole world, the reply is
easy, that Christ spoke in a manner suited to the time, with this
exception, that, on account of the expectation of the fruit which
already was nearly ripe, he commends in the Samaritans the seed of
prophetic doctrine, though mixed and blended with many weeds or
corruptions.  <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md)

<span id="x.vi-p19"></span><span id="x.vi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="x.vi-p20"></span>**37.** *For in this is the saying true.*
This was a common proverb, by which he showed that many men frequently
receive the fruit of the labor of others, though there was this
difference, that he who has *labored* is displeased at seeing the fruit
carried away by another, whereas the Apostles have the Prophets for the
companions of their joy. And yet it cannot be inferred from this, that
the Prophets themselves are witnesses, or are aware, of what is now
going on in the Church; for Christ means nothing more than that the
Prophets, so long as they lived, taught under the influence of such
feelings, that they already rejoiced on account of the fruit which they
were not permitted to gather. The comparison which Peter employs (<span
id="x.vi-p20.1"></span>[1Pe 1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md)<span
id="x.vi-p20.1"></span>) is not unlike; except that he addresses his
exhortation generally to all believers, but Christ here speaks to the
disciples alone, and, in their person, to the ministers of the Gospel.
By these words he enjoins them to throw their labors into a common
stock, so that there may be no wicked envy among them; that those who
are first sent to the work ought to be so attentive to the present
cultivation as not to envy a greater blessing to those who are
afterwards to follow them; and that they who are sent, as it were, to
gather the ripe fruit, ought to be employed with equal cheerfulness in
their office; for the comparison which is here made between the teachers
of the Law and of the Gospel may likewise be applied to the latter, when
viewed in reference to each other.

<span id="x.vii"></span>

<span id="x.vii-p1"></span><span id="x.vii-p1.1"></span>[John
4:39-45](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#039.md)<span id="x.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.vii-p2"></span>**39.** And many Samaritans out of that city
believed in him on account of the saying of the woman, who testified, I
told you all things that ever I did. **40.** When the Samaritans,
therefore, came to him, they entreated him to remain with them; and he
remained two days. **41.** And many more believed on account of his
word; **42.** And said to the woman, We no longer believe on account of
thy speech; for we ourselves have heard, and know, that this is actually
the Christ, the Savior of the world. **43.** And after two days he
departed, and went away into Galilee. **44.** For Jesus himself
testified,  <span id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) that a Prophet hath no
honor in his own country. **45.** And when he came into Galilee, the
Galileans received him, who had seen  <span
id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) all that he did in Jerusalem on the
feast-day; for they had also come to the feast-day.

<span id="x.vii-p5"></span> 

<span id="x.vii-p6"></span><span id="x.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="x.vii-p7"></span>**39.** *And many Samaritans out of that city
believed.* The Evangelist here relates what was the success of the
woman’s announcement to her citizens, from which it is evident that the
expectation and desire of the promised Messiah had no small vigor among
them. Now, the word *believe* is here used inaccurately, and means that
they were induced by the woman’s statement to acknowledge Christ to be a
Prophet. It is, in some respects, a commencement of *faith*, when minds
are prepared to receive the doctrine. Such an entrance to *faith*
receives here the honorable appellation of *faith*, in order to inform
us how highly God esteems reverence for his word, when he confers so
great honor on the docility of those who have not yet been taught. Now,
their *faith* manifests itself in this respect, that they are seized
with a desire to profit, and, for that reason, desire that Christ
*should remain with them*

<span id="x.vii-p8"></span><span id="x.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="x.vii-p9"></span>**41.** *And many more believed.* From what
followed it is evident that Christ’s compliance with their wish was
highly proper; for we see how much fruit was reaped from the *two days*
which he granted to their request. By this example we are taught that we
ought never to refrain from working, when we have it in our power to
advance the kingdom of God; and if we are afraid that our readiness in
complying may be liable to unfavorable reports, or may often prove to be
useless, let us ask from Christ the Spirit of counsel to direct us. The
word *believe* is now used in a different sense; for it means not only
that they were prepared for *faith*, but that they actually had a proper
*faith*

<span id="x.vii-p10"></span><span id="x.vii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="x.vii-p11"></span>**42.** *On account of thy speech.* Though I
have followed Erasmus in rendering this word by *oratio*, (*speech*,)
because *loquela*, which the ancient interpreter uses, is a barbarous
term; yet I wish to warn my readers that the Greek word <span
id="x.vii-p11.1"></span>λαλία has the same meaning with the Latin word
*loquentia*, that is, *talk*, or *talkativeness*; and the Samaritans
appear to boast that they have now a stronger foundation than a woman’s
tongue, which is, for the most part, light and trivial.

<span id="x.vii-p12"></span>*We believe.* This expresses more fully the
nature of their faith, that it has been drawn from the word of God
itself, so that they can boast of having the Son of God as their
Teacher; as, indeed, it is on his authority alone that we can safely
rely. True, indeed, he is not now visibly present, so as to speak to us
mouth to mouth; but, by whomsoever we happen to hear him, our faith
cannot rest on any other than on himself. And from no other source
proceeds that *knowledge* which is likewise mentioned; for the speech
which comes from the mouth of a mortal man may indeed fill and satisfy
the ears, but will never confirm the soul in calm confidence of
salvation, so that he who has heard may be entitled to boast that he
*knows* In *faith*, therefore, the first thing necessary is, to *know*
that it is Christ who speaks by his ministers; and the next is, to give
him the honor which is due; that is, not to doubt that he is true and
faithful, so that, relying on so undoubted a guarantee, we may rely
safely on his doctrine.

<span id="x.vii-p13"></span>Again, when they affirm that Jesus is *the
Christ* and *the Savior of the world,* they undoubtedly have learned
this from hearing him. Hence we infer that, within *two days,* the sum
of the Gospel was more plainly taught by Christ than he had hitherto
taught it in Jerusalem. And Christ testified that the salvation, which
he had brought, was common to the whole world, that they might
understand more fully that it belonged to them also; for he did not call
them on the ground of their being lawful heirs, as the Jews were,  <span
id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) but taught that he had come to admit
*strangers* into the family of God, and to bring *peace to those who
were far off*, (<span id="x.vii-p14.2"></span>[Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017)<span id="x.vii-p14.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.vii-p15"></span><span id="x.vii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="x.vii-p16"></span>**44.** *For Jesus himself testified.* The
apparent contradiction which strikes us here at first sight, has given
rise to various interpretations. There is an excess of subtlety in the
explanation given by Augustine, that Christ was *without honor among his
own countrymen,* because he had done more good among the Samaritans in
*two days* only than he had done, in a long time, among the Galileans;
and because, without miracles, he gained more disciples in Samaria than
a great number of miracles had gained him in Galilee. Nor am I satisfied
with the view of Chrysostom, who understands Christ’s *country* to be
Capernaum, because he dwelt there more frequently than in any other
place. I rather agree with Cyril, who says that he left the city of
Nazareth, and departed into a different part of Galilee; for the other
three Evangelists mention Nazareth, when they relate this testimony of
Christ. The meaning might indeed be that, while the time of full
manifestation was not yet come, he chose to remain concealed in his
native country, as in a more obscure retreat. Some, too, explain it to
mean, that *he remained two days* in Samaria, because there was no
reason why he should hasten to go to a place where contempt awaited him.
Others think that he went straight to Nazareth, and immediately left it;
but, as John relates nothing of this sort, I do not venture to yield to
that conjecture. A more correct view of it is, that when he saw himself
despised in his native city Nazareth, he rather withdrew to another
place. And, therefore, it immediately follows (verse 46) that *he came
into the town of Cana.* What is next added — that *the Galileans
received him* — was a token of reverence, not of contempt.

<span id="x.vii-p17"></span>*A Prophet hath no honour in his own
country.* I have no doubt that this saying was common, and had passed
into a proverb;  <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) and we know that
proverbs are intended to be a graceful expression of what commonly and
most frequently (<span id="x.vii-p18.2"></span>ἐπὶ τὸ πολὶ) happens. In
such cases, therefore, it is not necessary that we should rigidly demand
uniform accuracy, as if what is stated in a proverb were always true. It
is certain that *prophets* are usually more admired elsewhere than in
their own country. Sometimes, too, it may happen, and in reality does
happen, that *a prophet* is not less honored by his countrymen than by
strangers; but the proverb states what is common and ordinary, that
*prophets* receive *honor* more readily in any other place than among
their own countrymen.

<span id="x.vii-p19"></span>Now this proverb, and the meaning of it, may
have a twofold origin; for it is a universal fault, that those whom we
have heard crying in the cradle, and whom we have seen acting foolishly
in their boyhood, are despised by us throughout their whole life, as if
they had made no progress, since they were boys. To this is added
another evil — envy, which prevails more among acquaintances. But I
think it probable that the proverb arose from this circumstance, that
*Prophets* were so ill-treated by their own nation; for good and holy
men, when they perceived that there was in Judea so great ingratitude
towards God, so great contempt of his word, so great obstinacy, might
justly utter this complaint, that nowhere are the Prophets of God less
honored than in their own country. If the former meaning be preferred,
the name *Prophet* must be understood generally to denote any teacher,
as Paul calls Epimenides *a prophet of the Cretians*, (<span
id="x.vii-p19.1"></span>Titus 1:12.)

<span id="x.vii-p20"></span><span id="x.vii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="x.vii-p21"></span>**45.** *The Galileans received him.*
Whether or not this honor was of long duration we have not the means of
determining; for there is nothing to which men are more prone than
forgetfulness of the gifts of God. Nor does John relate this with any
other design than to inform us that Christ performed miracles in
presence of many witnesses, so that the report of them was spread far
and wide. Again, this points out one advantage of miracles, that they
prepare the way for doctrine; for they cause reverence to be paid to
Christ.

<span id="x.viii"></span>

<span id="x.viii-p1"></span><span id="x.viii-p1.1"></span>[John
4:46-54](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#046.md)<span id="x.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.viii-p2"></span>**46.** Jesus therefore came again into Cana
of Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a
certain courtier, whose son was diseased, in Capernaum. **47.** When he
heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went away to him,
and entreated him to go down and cure his son; for he was near death.
**48.** Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders,
you will not believe. **49.** The courtier himself said to him, Sir,
come down ere my child die. **50.** Jesus said to him, Go, thy son
liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus had spoken to him, and
went away. **51.** And while he was still going down, his servants met
and informed him, saying, Thy son liveth. **52.** Then he asked them at
what hour he recovered; and they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh
hour the fever left him. **53.** The father therefore knew that it was
the same hour at which Jesus had said to him, Thy son liveth. And he
believed, and all his house. **54.** This second miracle did Jesus
again, when he had come out of Judea into Galilee.

<span id="x.viii-p3"></span> 

<span id="x.viii-p4"></span><span id="x.viii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="x.viii-p5"></span>**46.** *And there was a certain courtier.*
This is a more correct rendering, though Erasmus thinks differently, who
has translated <span id="x.viii-p5.1"></span>βασιλικός by a Latin word,
*Regulus*, which means a little king.  <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) I acknowledge indeed that, at that time,
they gave the name of *Reguli* (or, *little kings*) to those who are now
called Dukes, or Barons, or Earls; but the state of Galilee at that time
was such that there could be no person of that rank dwelling in
Capernaum. I think that he was some nobleman  <span
id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) of the court of Herod; for there is some
plausibility in the opinion of those who think that he was sent by
Caesar.  <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) This is expressly
mentioned by the Evangelist, because the rank of this personage made the
miracle the more illustrious.

<span id="x.viii-p9"></span><span id="x.viii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="x.viii-p10"></span>**47.** *When he had heard that Jesus had
come.* When he applies to Christ for aid, this is some evidence of his
faith; but, when he limits Christ’s manner of granting assistance, that
shows how ignorant he was. For he views the power of Christ as
inseparably connected with his bodily presence, from which it is
evident, that he had formed no other view concerning Christ than this, —
that he was a Prophet sent by God with such authority and power as to
prove, by the performance of miracles, that he was a minister of God.
This fault, though it deserved censure, Christ overlooks, but severely
upbraids him, and, indeed, all the Jews in general, on another ground,
that they were too eager to behold miracles.

<span id="x.viii-p11"></span>But how comes it that Christ is now so
harsh, who is wont to receive kindly others who desire miracles? There
must have been at that time some particular reason, though unknown to
us, why he treated this man with a degree of severity which was not
usual with him; and perhaps he looked not so much to the person as to
the whole nation. He saw that his doctrine had no great authority, and
was not only neglected but altogether despised; and, on the other hand,
that all had their eyes fixed on miracles, and that their whole senses
were seized with stupidity rather than with admiration. Thus, the wicked
contempt of the word of God, which at that time prevailed, constrained
him to make this complaint.

<span id="x.viii-p12"></span>True, indeed, some even of the saints
sometimes wished to be confirmed by miracles, that they might not
entertain any doubt as to the truth of the promises; and we see how God,
by kindly granting their requests, showed that he was not offended at
them. But Christ describes here far greater wickedness; for the Jews
depended so much on miracles, that they left no room for the word. And
first, it was exceedingly wicked that they were so stupid and carnal as
to have no reverence for doctrine, unless they had been aroused by
miracles; for they must have been well acquainted with the word of God,
in which they had been educated from their infancy. Secondly, when
miracles were performed, they were so far from profiting aright, that
they remained in a state of stupidity and amazement. Thus they had no
religion, no knowledge of God, no practice of godliness, except what
consisted in miracles.

<span id="x.viii-p13"></span>To the same purpose is that reproach which
Paul brings against them, *the Jews demand signs*, (<span
id="x.viii-p13.1"></span>[1Co
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#022)<span id="x.viii-p13.1"></span>..md)
For he means that they were unreasonably and immoderately attached to
signs, and cared little about the grace of Christ, or the promises of
eternal life, or the secret power of the Spirit, but, on the contrary,
rejected the Gospel with haughty disdain, because they had no relish for
any thing but miracles. I wish there were not many persons in the
present day affected by the same disease; but nothing is more common
than this saying, “Let them first perform miracles,  <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) and then we will lend an ear to their
doctrine;” as if we ought to despise and disdain the truth of Christ,
unless it derive support from some other quarter. But though God were to
overwhelm them by a huge mass of miracles, still they speak falsely when
they say that they would believe. Some outward astonishment would be
produced, but they would not be a whit more attentive to doctrine.

<span id="x.viii-p15"></span><span id="x.viii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="x.viii-p16"></span>**49.** *Sir, come down, ere my child die.*
Since he perseveres in asking, and at length obtains what he wished, we
may conclude that Christ did not reprove him in such a manner as if he
intended altogether to reject him, and refused his prayers; but that he
rather did so for the purpose of correcting that fault which obstructed
the entrance of true faith. And we ought to remember — what I have
formerly stated — that this was a general reproof of a whole people, and
was not peculiarly addressed to one individual. In this manner, whatever
is improper, or distorted, or superfluous, in our prayers, must be
corrected or removed, that dangerous obstructions may be taken out of
the way. Now courtiers are usually fastidious and haughty, and do not
willingly submit to be treated with harshness; but it deserves notice,
that this man, humbled by his necessitous case, and by the dread of
losing his son, does not burst into a passion, or murmur, when Christ
speaks to him roughly, but passes by that reproof in modest silence. We
find the same things in ourselves; for we are astonishingly delicate,
impatient, and fretful until, subdued by adversities, we are constrained
to lay aside our pride and disdain.

<span id="x.viii-p17"></span><span id="x.viii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="x.viii-p18"></span>**50.** *Thy son liveth.* The first thing
that strikes us here is, the astonishing kindness and condescension of
Christ, that he bears with the man’s ignorance, and stretches his power
beyond what had been expected. He requested that Christ would come to
the place and cure his son. He thought it possible that his son could be
freed from sickness and disease, but not that he could be raised up
after he was dead; and therefore he urges Christ to make haste, that his
son’s recovery may not be prevented by his death. Accordingly, when
Christ pardons both, we may conclude from it how highly he values even a
small measure of faith. It is worthy of observation that Christ, while
he does not comply with his desire, grants much more than he had
requested; for he testifies as to the present health of his son. Thus it
frequently happens that our Heavenly Father, while he does not comply
with our wishes in every particular, proceeds to relieve us by
unexpected methods, that we may learn not to prescribe to him in
anything. When he says, *Thy son liveth,* he means that he has been
rescued from the danger of death.

<span id="x.viii-p19"></span>*The man believed the word which Jesus had
spoken to him.* Having come with the conviction that Christ was a
prophet of God, he was on that account so much disposed to believe,
that, as soon as he had heard a single word, he seized it and fixed it
in his heart. Though he did not entertain all the respect that he ought
for the power of Christ, yet a short promise suddenly awoke new
confidence in his mind, so that he believed the life of his son to be
contained in a single word of Christ. And such is the promptitude with
which we ought to receive the word of God, but it is very far from
producing always so immediate an effect on the hearers. For how many
will you find that profit as much by many sermons as this man, who was
half a heathen, profited by hearing a single word? So much the more
ought we to labor with zeal to arouse our sluggishness, and, above all,
to pray that God would touch our hearts in such a manner, that we may
not be less willing to believe than He is ready and gracious to promise.

<span id="x.viii-p20"></span><span id="x.viii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="x.viii-p21"></span>**51.** *While he was still going down.*
Here is described the effect of faith, together with the efficacy of the
word; for as Christ, by a word, restores to life this child who was just
dying, so in one moment the father, by his faith, regains his son safe
and sound. Let us therefore know that, whenever the Lord offers his
benefits to us, his power will always be ready to accomplish whatever he
promises, provided that the door be not shut against him by our
unbelief. It does not always happen, I acknowledge, and even is not
frequent or ordinary, that God instantly displays his arm for giving us
assistance; but whenever he delays, he has always a good reason, and one
that is highly advantageous to us. This at least is certain, that so far
is he from delaying unnecessarily, that he rather contends with the
obstacles which we throw in the way; and, therefore, when we do not see
his immediate aid, let us consider how much of concealed distrust there
is in us, or at least how small and limited our faith is. And we ought
not to wonder if He is unwilling to allow his benefits to be lost, or to
throw them at random on the ground, but chooses to bestow them on those
who, by opening the bosom of their faith, are ready to receive them. And
though he does not always assist his people in the same manner, yet in
no instance will the faith of any one be fruitless, or hinder us from
experiencing the truth of what the Prophet says, that the promises of
God, even when they seem to delay, are in reality making great haste.

<span id="x.viii-p22"></span>Though it tarry, wait for it; because it
will surely come,  
it will not tarry, (<span id="x.viii-p22.2"></span>[Hab
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#003)<span id="x.viii-p22.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.viii-p23"></span><span id="x.viii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="x.viii-p24"></span>**52.** *Therefore he inquired at them.*
That this courtier asked his servants at what time his son began to
recover, was done by a secret impulse from God, that the truth of the
miracle might be rendered more conspicuous. For by nature we have an
exceedingly wicked disposition to extinguish the light of the power of
God, and Satan labors, by various means, to hide the works of God from
our view; and, therefore, in order that they may obtain from us that
praise which is due to them, they must be made so manifest that no room
is left for doubt. Whatever then may be the ingratitude of men, still
this circumstance does not permit so illustrious a work of Christ to be
ascribed to chance.

<span id="x.viii-p25"></span><span id="x.viii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="x.viii-p26"></span>**53.** *And he believed, and his whole
house.* It may appear absurd that the Evangelist should mention this as
the commencement of faith in that man, whose faith he has already
commended. Nor can it be supposed that the word *believe* — at least in
this passage — relates to the progress of faith. But it must be
understood that this man, being a Jew and educated in the doctrine of
the Law, had already obtained some taste of faith when he came to
Christ; and that he afterwards *believed in the saying of Christ* was a
particular faith, which extended no farther than to expect the life of
his son. But now he began to *believe* in a different manner; that is,
because, embracing the doctrine of Christ, he openly professed to be one
of his disciples. Thus not only does he now *believe* that his son will
be cured through the kindness of Christ, but he acknowledges Christ to
be the Son of God, and makes a profession of faith in his Gospel. His
whole family joins him, which was an evidence of the miracle; nor can it
be doubted that he did his utmost to bring others along with him to
embrace the Christian religion.
