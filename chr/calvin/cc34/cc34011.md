<span id="xii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 6

<span id="xii.i"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p1"></span><span id="xii.i-p1.1"></span>[John
6:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#001.md)<span id="xii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Afterwards, Jesus went across the sea
of Galilee, which is called (the sea) of Tiberias. **2.** And a great
multitude followed him, because they had seen his miracles, which he
performed on those who were diseased. **3.** And Jesus went up into a
mountain, and there sat down with his disciples. **4.** And the
passover, a feast of the Jews, was at hand. **5.** Jesus therefore,
lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude came to him,
saith to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that those men may eat?
**6.** (Now he said this, trying him; for he himself knew what he would
do.) **7.** Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii of bread is not
sufficient for them, that each of them may take a little. **8.** One of
his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith to him, **9.** There
is here a boy, who hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes; but
what are these among so many? **10.** And Jesus said, Make the men sit
down. (Now there was much grass in that place.) The men therefore sat
down, in number about five thousand. **11.** And Jesus took the loaves,
and, having given thanks, distributed them to the disciples, and the
disciples to those who had sat down, and likewise of the fishes, as much
as they wished. **12.** And after they were satisfied, he said to his
disciples, Gather the fragments which are left, that nothing may be
lost. **13.** They therefore gathered, and filled twelve baskets with
the fragments of the five loaves which were left by those who had eaten.

<span id="xii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xii.i-p4"></span><span id="xii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p5"></span>**1.** *Afterwards, Jesus went.* Although
John was accustomed to collect those actions and sayings of Christ,
which the other three Evangelists had omitted, yet in this passage,
contrary to his custom, he repeats the history of a miracle which they
had related. But he does so for the express purpose of passing from them
to Christ’s sermon, which was delivered next day at Capernaum, because
the two things were connected; and therefore this narrative, though the
other three Evangelists have it in common with him, has this
peculiarity, that it is directed to another object, as we shall see. The
other Evangelists (<span id="xii.i-p5.2"></span>[Mt
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#013.md)<span id="xii.i-p5.2"></span>;
<span id="xii.i-p5.3"></span>[Mr
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#032.md)<span id="xii.i-p5.3"></span>;
<span id="xii.i-p5.4"></span>[Lu
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010)<span id="xii.i-p5.4"></span>.md)
state that this happened shortly after the death of John the Baptist, by
which circumstance of time they point out the cause of Christ’s
departure; for when tyrants have once imbrued their hands in the blood
of the godly, they kindle into greater cruelty, in the same manner as
intemperate drinking aggravates the thirst of drunkards. Christ
therefore intended to abate the rage of Herod by his absence. He uses
the term, *Sea of Galilee*, as meaning the lake of Gennesareth. When he
adds that it was called the *Sea of Tiberias*, he explains more fully
the place to which Christ withdrew; for the whole lake did not bear that
name, but only that part of it which lay contiguous to the bank on which
*Tiberias* was situated.

<span id="xii.i-p6"></span><span id="xii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p7"></span>**2.** *And a great multitude followed him.*
So great ardor in following Christ arose from this, that, having beheld
his power in miracles, they were convinced that he was some great
prophet, and that he had been sent by God. But the Evangelist here omits
what the other three relate, that Christ employed a part of the day in
teaching and in healing the sick, and that, when the sun was setting,
his disciples requested him to *send away the multitudes*, (<span
id="xii.i-p7.1"></span>[Matt. 14:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#014.md)<span id="xii.i-p7.1"></span>;
<span id="xii.i-p7.2"></span>[Mark
6:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#034.md),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#035.md)<span id="xii.i-p7.2"></span>;
<span id="xii.i-p7.3"></span>[Luke
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#012)<span id="xii.i-p7.3"></span>;.md) for
he reckoned it enough to give the substance of it in a few words, that
he might take this opportunity of leading us on to the remaining
statements which immediately follow.

<span id="xii.i-p8"></span>Here we see, in the first place, how eager
was the desire of the people to hear Christ, since all of them,
forgetting themselves, take no concern about spending the night *in a
desert place*. So much the less excusable is our indifference, or rather
our sloth, when we are so far from preferring the heavenly doctrine to
the gnawings of hunger, that the slightest interruptions immediately
lead us away from meditation on the heavenly life. Very rarely does it
happen that Christ finds us free and disengaged from the entanglements
of the world. So far is every one of us from being ready to follow him
to a desert mountain, that scarcely one in ten can endure to receive
him, when he presents himself at home in the midst of comforts. And
though this disease prevails nearly throughout the whole world, yet it
is certain that no man will be fit for the kingdom of God until, laying
aside such delicacy, he learn to desire the food of the soul so
earnestly that his belly shall not hinder him.

<span id="xii.i-p9"></span>But as the flesh solicits us to attend to its
conveniences, we ought likewise to observe that Christ, of his own
accord, takes care of those who neglect themselves in order to follow
him.  <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) For he does not wait till
they are famished, and cry out that they are perishing of hunger, and
have nothing to eat, but he provides food for them before they have
asked it. We shall perhaps be told that this does not always happen, for
we often see that godly persons, though they have been entirely devoted
to the kingdom of God, are exhausted and almost fainting with hunger. I
reply, though Christ is pleased to try our faith and patience in this
manner, yet from heaven he beholds our wants, and is careful to relieve
them, as far as is necessary for our welfare; and when assistance is not
immediately granted, it is done for the best reason, though that reason
is concealed from us.

<span id="xii.i-p11"></span><span id="xii.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p12"></span>**3.** *Jesus therefore went up into a
mountain.* Christ unquestionably sought a place of retirement till *the
feast of the Passover*; and therefore it is said that he *sat down on a
mountain with his disciples.* Such was undoubtedly the purpose which he
formed as man; but the purpose of God was different, which he willingly
obeyed. Although, therefore, he avoided the sight of men, yet he permits
himself to be led by the hand of God as into a crowded theater; for
there was a larger assembly of men *in a desert mountain* than in any
populous city, and greater celebrity arose from the miracle than if it
had happened in the open market-place of *Tiberias* We are therefore
taught by this example to form our plans in conformity to the course of
events, but in such a manner that, if the result be different from what
we expected, we may not be displeased that God is above us, and
regulates everything according to his pleasure.

<span id="xii.i-p13"></span><span id="xii.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p14"></span>**5.** *He saith to Philip.* What we here
read as having been *said to Philip* alone, the other Evangelists tell
us, was said to all. But there is no inconsistency in this; for it is
probable that *Philip* spoke according to the opinion entertained by
all, and, therefore, Christ replies to him in particular; just as John,
immediately afterwards, introduces Andrew as speaking, where the other
Evangelists attribute the discourse to all alike. Perceiving that they
have no conception of an extraordinary remedy, he then arouses their
minds, which may be said to be asleep, so that they may, at least, have
their eyes open to behold what shall be immediately exhibited to them.
The design of all that is alleged by the disciples is, to persuade
Christ not to detain the people; and, perhaps, in this respect they
consult their private advantage, that a part of the inconvenience may
not fall upon themselves. Accordingly, Christ disregards their
objections, and proceeds in his design.

<span id="xii.i-p15"></span><span id="xii.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p16"></span>**7.** *Two hundred denarii.* As the
*denarius*, according to the computation of *Budaeus*, is equal to four
times the value of a *carolus* and two *deniers* of *Tours*, this sum
amounts to thirty-five *francs*, or thereby.  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) If you divide this sum among *five
thousand men*, each hundred of them will have less than *seventeenpence
sterling*  <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) If we now add about a
thousand of *women and children*, it will be found that *Philip* allots
to each person about the sixth part of an English penny,  <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) *to buy a little bread* But, as
usually happens in a great crowd, he probably thought that there was a
greater number of people present; and as the disciples were poor and ill
supplied with money, *Andrew* intended to alarm Christ by the greatness
of the sum, meaning that they were not wealthy enough to entertain so
many people.

<span id="xii.i-p20"></span><span id="xii.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p21"></span>**10.** *Make the men sit down.* That the
disciples were not sooner prepared to cherish the hope which their
Master held out, and did not remember to ascribe to his power all that
was proper, was a degree of stupidity worthy of blame; but no small
praise is due to their cheerful obedience in now complying with his
injunction, though they know not what is his intention, or what
advantage they will derive from what they are doing. The same readiness
to obey is manifested by the people; for, while they are uncertain about
the result, they all sit down as soon as a single word of command has
been pronounced. And this is the trial of true faith, when God commands
men to walk, as it were, in darkness. For this purpose let us learn not
to be wise in ourselves, but, amidst great confusion, still to hope for
a prosperous issue, when we follow the guidance of God, who never
disappoints his own people.

<span id="xii.i-p22"></span><span id="xii.i-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p23"></span>**11.** *After having given thanks.* Christ
has oftener than once instructed us by his example that, whenever we
take food, we ought to begin with prayer. For those things which God has
appointed for our use, being evidences of his infinite goodness and
fatherly love towards us, call on us to offer praise to Him; and
*thanksgiving*, as Paul informs us, is a kind of solemn
*sanctification*, by means of which the use of them begins to be pure to
us, (<span id="xii.i-p23.1"></span>[1Ti
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#004)<span id="xii.i-p23.1"></span>..md)
Hence it follows, that they who swallow them down without thinking of
God, are guilty of sacrilege, and of profaning the gifts of God. And
this instruction is the more worthy of attention, because we daily see a
great part of the world feeding themselves like brute beasts. When
Christ determined that the bread given to the disciples should grow
among their hands, we are taught by it that God blesses our labor when
we are serviceable to each other.

<span id="xii.i-p24"></span>Let us now sum up the meaning of the whole
miracle. It has this in common with the other miracles, that Christ
displayed in it his Divine power in union with beneficence, It is also a
confirmation to us of that statement by which he exhorts us to *seek the
kingdom of God*, promising that *all other things shall be added to us*,
(<span id="xii.i-p24.1"></span>[Mt
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033)<span id="xii.i-p24.1"></span>..md)
For if he took care of those who were led to him only by a sudden
impulse, how would he desert us, if we seek him with a firm and steady
purpose? True, indeed, he will sometimes allow his own people, as I have
said, to suffer hunger; but he will never deprive them of his aid; and,
in the meantime, he has very good reasons for not assisting us till
matters come to an extremity.

<span id="xii.i-p25"></span>Besides, Christ plainly showed that he not
only bestows spiritual life on the world, but that his Father commanded
him also to nourish the body. For abundance of all blessings is
committed to his hand, that, as a channel, he may convey them to us;
though I speak incorrectly by calling him a *channel*, for he is rather
the living fountain flowing from the eternal Father. Accordingly, Paul
prays that all blessings may come to us *from God the Father*, *and from
the Lord Jesus Christ*, in common, (<span id="xii.i-p25.1"></span>[1Co
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#003)<span id="xii.i-p25.1"></span>;.md)
and, in another passage, he shows that

<span id="xii.i-p26"></span>in all things we ought to give thanks to God
the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, (<span
id="xii.i-p26.1"></span>[Eph 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#020.md)<span
id="xii.i-p26.1"></span>.)

<span id="xii.i-p27"></span>And not only does this office belong to his
eternal Divinity, but even in his human nature, and so far as he has
taken upon him our flesh,  <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) the
Father has appointed him to be the dispenser, that by his hands he may
feed us. Now, though we do not every day see miracles before our eyes,
yet not less bountifully does God display his power in feeding us. And
indeed we do not read that, when he wished to give a supper to his
people, he used any new means; and, therefore, it would be an
inconsiderate prayer, if any one were to ask that meat and drink might
be given to him by some unusual method.

<span id="xii.i-p29"></span>Again, Christ did not provide great
delicacies for the people, but they who saw his amazing power displayed
in that supper, were obliged to rest satisfied with barley-bread and
fish without sauce.  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) And though
he does not now satisfy *five thousand men with five loaves*, still he
does not cease to feed the whole world in a wonderful manner. It sounds
to us, no doubt, like a paradox, that

<span id="xii.i-p31"></span>man liveth not by bread alone, but by the
word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God,  
(<span id="xii.i-p31.2"></span>[De
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003)<span id="xii.i-p31.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xii.i-p32"></span>For we are so strongly attached to outward
means, that nothing is more difficult than to depend on the providence
of God. Hence it arises that we tremble so much, as soon as we have not
bread at hand. And if we consider every thing aright, we shall be
compelled to discern the blessing of God in all the creatures which
serve for our bodily support;  <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md)
but use and frequency lead us to undervalue the miracles of nature. And
yet, in this respect, it is not so much our stupidity as our malignity
that hinders us; for where is the man to be found who does not choose to
wander astray in his mind, and to encompass heaven and earth a hundred
times, rather than look at God who presents himself to his view?

<span id="xii.i-p34"></span><span id="xii.i-p34.1"></span>

<span id="xii.i-p35"></span>**13.** *And filled twelve baskets.* When
*four thousand men* were fed by *seven loaves*, Matthew relates that the
number of baskets filled with fragments was exactly the same with the
number of the loaves, (<span id="xii.i-p35.1"></span>[Mt
15:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#037)<span id="xii.i-p35.1"></span>..md)
Since, therefore, a smaller quantity is sufficient for a greater number
of men, and since the quantity left is nearly double, hence we see more
clearly of what value is that blessing of God, against the sight of
which we deliberately shut our eyes. We ought also to observe, in
passing, that though Christ commands them to *fill the baskets* for
illustrating the miracle, yet he likewise exhorts his disciples to
frugality, when he says, *Gather the fragments which are left, that
nothing may be lost;* for the increase of the bounty of God ought not to
be an excitement to luxury. Let those, therefore, who have abundance,
remember that they will one day render an account of their immoderate
wealth, if they do not carefully and faithfully apply their superfluity
to purposes which are good, and of which God approves.

<span id="xii.ii"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xii.ii-p1.1"></span>[John
6:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#014.md)<span id="xii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p2"></span>**14.** Those men, therefore, when they saw
the miracle which Jesus had performed, said, This is truly the Prophet
who is to come into the world. **15.** And when Jesus knew that they
would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he again withdrew
alone into a mountain. **16.** And when it was evening, his disciples
went down to the sea. **17.** And having entered into a ship, they came
across the sea into Capernaum; and it was now dark, and Jesus had not
come to them. **18.** And the sea arose by means of a great wind that
blew. **19.** When therefore they had rowed about five-and-twenty or
thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea; and when he
approached the ship,  <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) they were
terrified. **20.** But he saith to them, It is I, be not terrified.
**21.** They were willing, therefore, to receive him into the ship; and
immediately the ship reached the place to which they were going.

<span id="xii.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.ii-p5"></span><span id="xii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p6"></span>**14.** *Those men, therefore.* The miracle
appears to have been attended by some advantage, that they acknowledge
the author of it to be the Messiah; for Christ had no other object in
view. But immediately they apply to a different and improper purpose the
knowledge which they have obtained concerning Christ. And it is a fault
extremely common among men, to corrupt and pervert his truth by their
falsehoods, as soon as he has revealed himself to them; and even when
they appear to have entered into the right path, they immediately fall
away.

<span id="xii.ii-p7"></span><span id="xii.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p8"></span>**15.** *To make him a king.* When those men
intended to give to Christ the title and honor of king, there was some
ground for what they did. But they erred egregiously in taking upon
themselves the liberty of *making a king*; for Scripture ascribes this
as peculiar to God alone, as it is said,

<span id="xii.ii-p9"></span>I have appointed my king on my holy hill of
Zion,  
(<span id="xii.ii-p9.2"></span>[Ps
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006)<span id="xii.ii-p9.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xii.ii-p10"></span>Again, what sort of *kingdom* do they
contrive for him? An earthly one, which is utterly inconsistent with his
person. Hence let us learn how dangerous it is, in the things of God, to
neglect His word, and to contrive anything of our own opinion; for there
is nothing which the foolish subtlety of our understanding does not
corrupt. And what avails the pretense of zeal, when by our disorderly
worship we offer a greater insult to God than if a person were expressly
and deliberately to make an attack on his glory?

<span id="xii.ii-p11"></span>We know how furious were the efforts of
adversaries to extinguish the glory of Christ. That violence, indeed,
reached its extreme point when he was crucified. But by means of his
crucifixion salvation was obtained for the world,  <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) and Christ himself obtained a splendid
triumph over death and Satan. If he had permitted himself to be now
*made a king*, his spiritual kingdom would have been ruined, the Gospel
would have been stamped with everlasting infamy, and the hope of
salvation would have been utterly destroyed. Modes of worship regulated
according to our own fancy, and honors rashly contrived by men, have no
other advantage than this, that they rob God of his true honor, and pour
upon him nothing but reproach.

<span id="xii.ii-p13"></span>*And take him by force.* We must also
observe the phrase, *take by force* They wished *to take Christ by
force*, the Evangelist says; that is, with impetuous violence they
wished *to make him a king,* though against his will. If we desire,
therefore, that he should approve of the honor which we confer upon him,
we ought always to consider what he requires. And, indeed, they who
venture to offer to God honors invented by themselves are chargeable
with using some sort of force and violence towards him; for obedience is
the foundation of true worship. Let us also learn from it with what
reverence we ought to abide by the pure and simple word of God; for as
soon as we turn aside in the smallest degree, the truth is poisoned by
our leaven, so that it is no longer like itself. They learned from the
word of God that he who was promised to be the Redeemer would be *a
king;* but out of their own head they contrive an earthly *kingdom*, and
they assign to him a kingdom contrary to the word of God. Thus, whenever
we mix up our own opinions with the word of God, faith degenerates into
frivolous conjectures. Let believers, therefore, cultivate habitual
modesty, lest Satan hurry them into an ardor of inconsiderate and rash
zeal,  <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) so that, like *the
Giants*, they shall rush violently against God, who is never worshipped
aright but when we receive him as he presents himself to us.

<span id="xii.ii-p15"></span>It is astonishing that *five thousand men*
should have been seized with such daring presumption, that they did not
hesitate, by *making a new king*, to provoke against themselves Pilate’s
army and the vast power  <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) of the
Roman empire; and it is certain that they would never have gone so far,
if they had not, relying on the predictions of the Prophets, hoped that
God would be on their side, and, consequently, that they would overcome.
But still they went wrong in contriving a *kingdom* of which the
Prophets had never spoken. So far are they from having the hand of God
favorable to aid their undertaking that, on the contrary, Christ
withdraws. That was also the reason why wretched men under Popery
wandered so long in gross darkness — while God was, as it were, absent —
because they had dared to pollute the whole of his worship by their
foolish inventions.  <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md)

<span id="xii.ii-p18"></span><span id="xii.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p19"></span>**16.** *His disciples went down.* Christ
undoubtedly intended to conceal himself until the crowd should disperse.
We know how difficult it is to allay a popular tumult. Now, if they had
openly attempted to do what they had intended, it would have been no
easy matter afterwards to wipe off the stain which had once been fixed
upon him. Meanwhile, he spent all that time in prayer, as the other
Evangelists (<span id="xii.ii-p19.1"></span>[Mt
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#023.md)<span id="xii.ii-p19.1"></span>;
<span id="xii.ii-p19.2"></span>[Mr
6:46](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#046)<span id="xii.ii-p19.2"></span>.md)
relate; probably, that God the Father might repress that folly of the
people.  <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) As to his crossing the
lake in a miraculous manner, it is intended to profit his disciples by
again confirming their faith. The advantage extended still farther; for
next day all the people would easily see that he had not been brought
thither by a boat or ship,  <span id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) but
that he had come by his own power; for they blockaded the shore from
which he had to set out, and would scarcely have been drawn away from
it, if they had not seen the disciples cross to a different place.

<span id="xii.ii-p22"></span><span id="xii.ii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p23"></span>**17.** *It was now dark.* John passes by
many circumstances which the other Evangelists introduce; such as, that
for several hours they struggled with a contrary wind; for it is
probable that the storm arose immediately after the night began to come
on; and they tell us that Christ did not appear to his disciples till
about the fourth watch of the night, (<span id="xii.ii-p23.1"></span>[Mt
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#028.md)<span id="xii.ii-p23.1"></span>;
<span id="xii.ii-p23.2"></span>[Mr
6:48](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#048)<span id="xii.ii-p23.2"></span>..md)
Those who conjecture that they were still about the middle of the lake
when Christ appeared to them, because John says that *they had then
advanced about twenty-five or thirty furlongs*, are led into a mistake
by supposing that they had sailed to the farther or opposite bank; for
Bethsaida, near which town, Luke tells us, the miracle was performed,
(<span id="xii.ii-p23.3"></span>[Lu
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#010)<span id="xii.ii-p23.3"></span>,.md)
and Capernaum, which the ship reached, (<span
id="xii.ii-p23.4"></span>[Joh
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#016)<span id="xii.ii-p23.4"></span>,.md)
were situated on the same coast.

<span id="xii.ii-p24"></span>Pliny, in his fifth book, states that this
lake was six miles in breadth, and sixteen in length. Josephus (in the
third book of the Wars of the Jews) assigns to it one hundred furlongs
in length, and forty in breadth;  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) and as eight furlongs make one mile,
we may easily infer how little the one description differs from the
other. So far as relates to the present sailing, my opinion is, that
they did not go over so great a space by direct sailing, but through
being driven about by the tempest.  <span
id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) However that may be, the Evangelist
intended to show that, when Christ presented himself to them, they were
in the utmost danger. It may be thought strange that the disciples
should be tormented in this manner, while others had nothing to disturb
them in sailing; but in this manner the Lord often makes his people fall
into alarming dangers, that they may more plainly and familiarly
recognize him in their deliverance.

<span id="xii.ii-p27"></span><span id="xii.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p28"></span>**19.** *They were terrified.* The other
Evangelists explain the cause of that fear to have been, that *they
thought that it was an apparition*, (<span id="xii.ii-p28.1"></span>[Mt
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#026.md)<span id="xii.ii-p28.1"></span>;
<span id="xii.ii-p28.2"></span>[Mr
6:49](../../../bib/kjv/mar006.htm#049)<span id="xii.ii-p28.2"></span>..md)
Now it is impossible not to be seized with consternation and dread, when
*an apparition* is presented before our eyes; for we conclude that it is
either some imposture of Satan, or some bad omen which God sends us.
Besides, John here holds out to us, as in a mirror, what kind of
knowledge of Christ we may obtain without the word, and what advantage
may be reaped from that knowledge. For if he present a simple
demonstration of his divinity, we immediately fall into our
imaginations, and every person forms an idol for himself instead of
Christ. After we have thus wandered in our understanding, this is
immediately followed by trembling and a confused terror of heart. But
when he begins to speak, we then obtain from his voice clear and solid
knowledge, and then also joy and delightful peace dawn upon our minds.
For there is great weight in these words:

<span id="xii.ii-p29"></span><span id="xii.ii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p30"></span>**20.** *It is I: be not terrified* We
learn from them that it is in Christ’s presence alone that we have
abundant grounds of confidence, so as to be calm and at ease. But this
belongs exclusively to the disciples of Christ; for we shall afterwards
see that wicked men were struck down by the same words, *It is I,*
(<span id="xii.ii-p30.1"></span>[Joh
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006)<span id="xii.ii-p30.1"></span>..md)
The reason of the distinction is, that he is sent as a Judge to the
reprobate and unbelievers for their destruction; and, therefore, they
cannot bear his presence without being immediately overwhelmed. But
believers, who know that he is given to them to make propitiation, as
soon as they hear his name, which is a sure pledge to them both of the
love of God and of their salvation, take courage as if they had been
raised from death to life, calmly look at the clear sky, dwell quietly
on earth, and, victorious over every calamity, take him for their shield
against all dangers. Nor does he only comfort and encourage them by his
word, but actually removes also the cause of the terror by allaying the
tempest.

<span id="xii.iii"></span>

<span id="xii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xii.iii-p1.1"></span>[John
6:22-25](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#022.md)<span id="xii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iii-p2"></span>**22.** Next day, the multitude standing on
the other side of the sea, when they saw that there was no other ship
there but only that into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus
had not entered into the ship with his disciples, but that his disciples
had gone away alone; **23.** And other ships came from Tiberias, near
the place where they had eaten bread, after that the Lord had given
thanks. **24.** When therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not
there, nor his disciples, they also entered into the ships, and came to
Capernaum, seeking Jesus. **25.** And having found him on the opposite
side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?

<span id="xii.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xii.iii-p4"></span><span id="xii.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iii-p5"></span>**22.** *Next day.* Here the Evangelist
relates circumstances from which the multitude might conclude that
Christ had gone across by divine power. There had been but one ship;
they see it go away without Christ; next day, ships come from other
places, by which they are conveyed to Capernaum; and there they find
Christ. It follows that he must have been conveyed across in a
miraculous manner. There is an intricacy and apparent confusion (<span
id="xii.iii-p5.1"></span>ἀνακόλουθον) in the words, but still the
meaning of them is plain enough; for, in the 22nd verse, John says that
*there had been but one ship*, and that all saw it leave the shore and
that place, and that it had not Christ as a passenger; and, in the 23rd
verse, he adds that *ships came from Tiberias,* by which the multitude
passed over, which had remained on the shore, blockading, as it were,
every outlet, that Christ might not escape.

<span id="xii.iii-p6"></span><span id="xii.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iii-p7"></span>**23.** *Near the place where they had
eaten bread.* The meaning of the words is doubtful; for they may be
explained, either that Tiberias was *near the place where* Christ had
fed them with five loaves, or that the ships reached the shore which was
near and below that place. I approve more highly of the latter
exposition; for Bethsaida, near which Luke states that the miracle was
performed, is half-way between Tiberias and Capernaum. Accordingly, when
ships came down from that place, which was farther up the lake, they
sailed along that shore on which the multitude were standing; and there
can be no doubt that they came to land for the purpose of taking in
passengers.

<span id="xii.iii-p8"></span>*After that the Lord had given thanks.*
When John again mentions that Christ *gave thanks*, it is not a
superfluous repetition; for he means that Christ obtained by prayer that
those few loaves were sufficient for feeding so many people; and as we
are cold and indolent in prayer, he presses upon us the same thing a
second time.

<span id="xii.iii-p9"></span><span id="xii.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iii-p10"></span>**25.** *On the other side of the sea.* We
have already said that Capernaum was not situated on the opposite shore;
for Tiberias is situated on that part of the lake where it is broadest,
Bethsaida follows next, and Capernaum lies near the lowest part, not far
from where the river Jordan issues from the lake. Now, when John places
it *on the other side of the lake* itself, we must not understand him as
if its position were directly across, but because, at the lower
extremity, the lake made a large winding, and, on account of the bay
that intervened, it was impossible to go by land without a very
circuitous journey. The Evangelist therefore says, *on the other side of
the sea*, adopting the mode of expression used by the common people,
because the only direct and ordinary mode of conveyance was by a boat.

<span id="xii.iv"></span>

<span id="xii.iv-p1"></span><span id="xii.iv-p1.1"></span>[John
6:26-29](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#026.md)<span id="xii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iv-p2"></span>**26.** Jesus answered them, and said,
Verily, verily, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw miracles,
but because you ate of the loaves, and were satisfied. **27.** Labour
for food, not that which perisheth, but the food which endureth to
eternal life, which the Son of man shall give to you; for him hath God
the Father sealed. **28.** They said therefore to him, What shall we do,
that we may work the works of God? **29.** Jesus answered and said to
them, This is the work of God, that you may believe in him whom he hath
sent.

<span id="xii.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="xii.iv-p4"></span><span id="xii.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iv-p5"></span>**26.** *Jesus answered them.* Christ does
not reply to the question put to him, which would have been fitted to
show to them his power in having come thither by a miracle.  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) But, on the contrary, he chides them
for throwing themselves forward without consideration; for they were not
acquainted with the true and proper reason of what he did, because they
sought in Christ something else than Christ himself. The fault which he
complains of in them is, that they seek Christ for the sake of the belly
and *not of the miracles* And yet it cannot be denied that they looked
to *the miracle;* nay more, the Evangelist has already told us that they
were excited by the miracles to follow Christ. But because they abused
the miracles for an improper purpose, he justly reproaches them with
having a greater regard to the belly than to miracles. His meaning was,
that they did not profit by the works of God as they ought to have done;
for the true way of profiting would have been to acknowledge Christ as
the Messiah in such a manner as to surrender themselves to be taught and
governed by him, and, under his guidance, to aspire to the heavenly
kingdom of God. On the contrary, they expect nothing greater from him
than to live happily and at ease in this world. This is to rob Christ of
his chief power; for the reason why he was given by the Father and
revealed himself to men is, that he may form them anew after the image
of God by giving them his Holy Spirit, and that he may conduct them to
eternal life by clothing them with his righteousness.

<span id="xii.iv-p7"></span>It is of great importance, therefore, what
we keep in view in the miracles of Christ; for he who does not aspire to
the kingdom of God, but rests satisfied with the conveniences of the
present life, seeks nothing else than to fill his belly. In like manner,
there are many persons in the present day who would gladly embrace the
gospel, if it were free from the bitterness of the cross, and if it
brought nothing but carnal pleasures. Nay, we see many who make a
Christian profession, that they may live in greater gaiety and with less
restraint. Some through the expectation of gain, others through fear,
and others for the sake of those whom they wish to please, profess to be
the disciples of Christ. In seeking Christ, therefore, the chief point
is, to despise the world and

<span id="xii.iv-p8"></span>seek the kingdom of God and his
righteousness,  
(<span id="xii.iv-p8.2"></span>[Mt
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033)<span id="xii.iv-p8.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xii.iv-p9"></span>Besides, as men very generally impose on
themselves, and persuade themselves that they are seeking Christ in the
best manner, while they debase the whole of his power, for this reason
Christ, in his usual manner, doubles the word *verily,* as if by the
oath he intended to bring to light the vice which lurks under our
hypocrisy.

<span id="xii.iv-p10"></span><span id="xii.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iv-p11"></span>**27.** *Labour for food, not that which
perisheth.* He shows to what object our desires ought to be directed,
namely, to eternal life; but because, in proportion as our
understandings are gross, we are always devoted to earthly things, for
this reason he corrects that disease which is natural to us, before he
points out what we ought to do. The simple doctrine would have been,
“Labour to have the incorruptible food;” but, knowing that the senses of
men are held bound by earthly cares, he first enjoins them to be loosed
and freed from those cords, that they may rise to heaven. Not that he
forbids his followers to labor that they may procure daily food; but he
shows that the heavenly life ought to be preferred to this earthly life,
because the godly have no other reason for living here than that, being
sojourners in the world, they may travel rapidly towards their heavenly
country.

<span id="xii.iv-p12"></span>Next, we ought to see what is the present
question; for, since the power of Christ is debased by those who are
devoted to the belly and to earthly things, he argues what we ought to
seek in him, and why we ought to seek it. He employs metaphors adapted
to the circumstances in which his sermon was delivered. If food had not
been mentioned, he would have said, without a figure, “You ought to lay
aside anxiety about the world, and strive to obtain the heavenly life.”
But as those men were running to their fodder like cattle, without
looking to anything better,  <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md)
Christ presents his sermon in a metaphorical dress, and gives the name
of *food* to everything that belongs to newness of life. We know that
our souls are fed by the doctrine of the gospel, when it is efficacious
in us by the power of the Spirit; and, therefore, as faith is the life
of the soul, all that nourishes and promotes faith is compared to *food*

<span id="xii.iv-p14"></span>*Which endureth to eternal life.* This kind
of food he calls incorruptible, and says that it *endureth to eternal
life*, in order to inform us that our souls are not fed for a day, but
are nourished in the expectation of a blessed immortality; because the
Lord

<span id="xii.iv-p15"></span>commences the work of our salvation, that
he may perform it till the day of Christ, (<span
id="xii.iv-p15.1"></span>[Php 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006.md)<span
id="xii.iv-p15.1"></span>.)

<span id="xii.iv-p16"></span>For this reason we must receive the gifts
of the Spirit, that they may be earnests and pledges of eternal life.
For, though the reprobate, after having tasted this food, frequently
reject it, so that it is not permanent in them, yet believing souls feel
that enduring power, when they are made partakers of the power of the
Holy Spirit in his gifts, which is not of short duration, but, on the
contrary, never fails.

<span id="xii.iv-p17"></span>It is a frivolous exercise of ingenuity to
infer, as some do, from the word *labor* or *work*, that we merit
eternal life by our works; for Christ metaphorically exhorts men, as we
have said, to apply their minds earnestly to meditation on the heavenly
life, instead of cleaving to the world, as they are wont to do; and
Christ himself removes every doubt, when he declares that it is he who
*giveth the food*; for what we obtain by his gift no man procures by his
own industry. There is undoubtedly some appearance of contradiction in
these words; but we may easily reconcile these two statements, that the
spiritual food of the soul is the free gift of Christ, and that we must
strive with all the affections of our heart to become partakers of so
great a blessing.

<span id="xii.iv-p18"></span>*For him hath God the Father sealed.* He
confirms the preceding statement, by saying that he was appointed to us
for that purpose by the Father. The ancient writers have misinterpreted
and tortured this passage, by maintaining that Christ is said to be
*sealed,* because he is the stamp and lively image of the Father. For he
does not here enter into abstruse discussions about his eternal essence,
but explains what he has been commissioned and enjoined to do, what is
his office in relation to us, and what we ought to seek and expect from
him. By an appropriate metaphor, he alludes to an ancient custom; for
they *sealed* with signets what they intended to sanction by their
authority. Thus Christ — that it may not appear as if he claimed
anything of himself, or by private authority  <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) — declares that this office was
enjoined on him by the Father, and that this decree of the Father was
manifested, as if a *seal* had been engraven on him. It may be summed up
thus: As it is not every person who has the ability or the right  <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) to feed souls with incorruptible food,
Christ appears in public, and, while he promises that he will be the
Author of so great a blessing, he likewise adds that he is approved by
God, and that he has been sent to men with this mark, which is, as it
were, God’s *seal* or *signet*  <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md)

<span id="xii.iv-p22"></span>Hence it follows that the desire of those
who shall present their souls to Christ, to be fed by him, will not be
disappointed. Let us know, therefore, that life is exhibited to us in
Christ, in order that each of us may aspire to it, not at random, but
with certainty of success. We are, at the same time, taught that all who
bestow this praise on any other than Christ are guilty of falsehood
before God. Hence it is evident that the Papists, in every part of their
doctrine, are altogether liars; for as often as they invent any means of
salvation in the room of Christ, so often do they — by erasing, as it
were, the impression which has been made — spoil and deface, with wicked
presumption and base treachery, this *seal* of God, which alone is
authentic. That we may not fall into so dreadful a condemnation, let us
learn to keep pure and entire for Christ all that the Father has given
to him.

<span id="xii.iv-p23"></span><span id="xii.iv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iv-p24"></span>**28***. What shall we do, that we may work
the works of God?* The multitude understood well enough that Christ had
exhorted them to aim at something higher than the conveniences of the
present life, and that they ought not to confine their attention to the
earth, since God calls them to more valuable blessings. But, in putting
this question, they are partly mistaken by not understanding the kind of
*labor*; for they do not consider that God bestows upon us, by the hand
of the Son, all that is necessary for spiritual life. First, they ask
*what they ought to do*; and next, when they use the expression, *the
works of God,* they do not understand what they say, and talk without
any definite object.  <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) In this
manner they manifest their ignorance of the grace of God. And yet they
appear here to murmur disdainfully against Christ, as if he were
accusing them groundlessly. “Dost thou suppose,” say they, “that we have
no solicitude about eternal life? Why, then, dost thou enjoin us to do
what is beyond our power?” By *the works of God* we must understand
those which God demands, and of which he approves.

<span id="xii.iv-p26"></span><span id="xii.iv-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iv-p27"></span>**29.** *The work of God is this.* They had
spoken of *works* Christ reminds them of one work, that is, *faith*; by
which he means that all that men undertake without *faith* is vain and
useless, but that *faith* alone is sufficient, because *this* alone does
God require from us, *that we believe* For there is here an implied
contrast between *faith* and the *works* and efforts of men; as if he
had said, Men toil to no purpose, when they endeavor to please God
without *faith*, because, by running, as it were, out of the course,
they do not advance towards the goal. This is a remarkable passage,
showing that, though men torment themselves wretchedly throughout their
whole life, still they lose their pains, if they have not *faith* in
Christ as the rule of their life. Those who infer from this passage that
*faith* is the gift of God are mistaken; for Christ does not now show
what God produces in us, but what he wishes and requires from us.

<span id="xii.iv-p28"></span>But we may think it strange that God
approves of nothing but *faith* alone; for the love of our neighbor
ought not to be despised, and the other exercises of religion do not
lose their place and honor. So then, though *faith* may hold the highest
rank, still other works are not superfluous. The reply is easy; for
*faith* does not exclude either the love of our neighbor or any other
good work, because it contains them all within itself. *Faith* is called
*the only work of God*, because by means of it we possess Christ, and
thus become the sons of God, so that he governs us by his Spirit. So
then, because Christ does not separate *faith* from its fruits, we need
not wonder if he make it to be the first and the last.  <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md)

<span id="xii.iv-p30"></span>*That you believe in him whom he hath
sent.* What is the import of the word *believe*, we have explained under
the Third Chapter. It ought always to be remembered that, in order to
have a full perception of the power of *faith*, we must understand what
Christ is, in whom we *believe*, and why he was given to us by the
Father. It is idle sophistry, under the pretext of this passage, to
maintain that we are justified by works, if faith justifies, because it
is likewise called *a work* First, it is plain enough that Christ does
not speak with strict accuracy, when he calls faith *a work*, just as
Paul makes a comparison between *the law of faith* and *the law of
works*, (<span id="xii.iv-p30.1"></span>[Ro
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027)<span id="xii.iv-p30.1"></span>..md)
Secondly, when we affirm that men are not justified by *works*, we mean
*works* by the merit of which men may obtain favor with God. Now *faith*
brings nothing to God, but, on the contrary, places man before God as
empty and poor, that he may be filled with Christ and with his grace. It
is, therefore, if we may be allowed the expression, a passive work, to
which no reward can be paid, and it bestows on man no other
righteousness than that which he receives from Christ.

12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039)<span id="xii.v-p7.1"></span>..md)
They had been at first drawn to Christ by the admiration of his miracles
or *signs,* and afterwards, through amazement at a new *sign,* they
acknowledged Christ to be the Messiah, and, with that conviction,
*wished to make him a king*; but now they demand *a sign* from him, as
if he were a man unknown to them. Whence came such sudden forgetfulness,
but because they are ungrateful to God, and, through their own malice,
are blind to his power, which is before their eyes? Nor can it be
doubted that they treat disdainfully all the miracles which they had
already beheld, because Christ does not comply with their wishes, and
because they do not find him to be what they imagined him to be. If he
had given them expectation of earthly happiness, he would have been
highly applauded by them; they would undoubtedly have hailed him as a
Prophet, and the Messiah, and the Son of God; but now, because he blames
them for being too much addicted to the flesh, they think that they
ought not to listen to him any more. And in the present day, how many
are there who resemble them! At first, because they promise to
themselves that Christ will flatter their vices, they eagerly embrace
the gospel, and call for no proof of it; but when they are called to
deny the flesh and to bear the cross, then do they begin to renounce
Christ and ask whence the gospel came. In short, as soon as Christ does
not grant their prayers, he is no longer their Master.

<span id="xii.v-p8"></span><span id="xii.v-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xii.v-p9"></span>**31.** *Our fathers ate manna in the
wilderness.* Thus we see that Christ put his finger on the sore, when he
told them that they came like brute beasts to fill their belly; for they
discover this gross disposition, when they demand a Messiah by whom they
are to be fed. And as to the magnificent terms in which they extol the
grace of God in the *manna,* they do this cunningly, in order to bury
the doctrine of Christ, by which he condemned them for immoderate desire
of corruptible food; for they contrast with it the magnificent title
bestowed on the *manna,* when it is called *heavenly bread* But when the
Holy Spirit bestows on the *manna* the honorable appellation of *the
bread of heaven*, (<span id="xii.v-p9.1"></span>[Ps
78:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#024)<span id="xii.v-p9.1"></span>,.md)
it is not with this intention, as if God fed his people, like a herd of
swine, and gave them nothing more valuable; and, therefore, they are
without excuse, when they wickedly reject the spiritual food of the
soul, which God now offers to them.

<span id="xii.v-p10"></span><span id="xii.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xii.v-p11"></span>**32.** *Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses
gave you not bread from heaven.* Christ appears to contradict what was
quoted from the psalm, but he speaks only by comparison. The *manna*
<span id="xii.v-p11.1"></span>מן is called *the bread of heaven*, but it
is for the nourishment of the body; but *the bread* which ought truly
and properly to be reckoned *heavenly*, is that which gives spiritual
nourishment to the soul. Christ therefore makes a contrast here between
the world and heaven, because we ought not to seek the incorruptible
life but in the kingdom of heaven. In this passage, *truth* is not
contrasted with *shadows*, as is often done elsewhere; but Christ
considers what is the *true* life of man, or, in other words, what it is
that makes him different from brute beasts, and excellent among the
creatures.

<span id="xii.v-p12"></span>*My Father giveth you the true bread from
heaven.* When he adds these words, the meaning is,” *The manna which
Moses gave to your fathers* did not bring *heavenly* life, but now
*heavenly* life is truly exhibited to you.” True, it is the *Father*
whom he calls *the giver of this bread*, but he means that it is given
by his own hand. Thus the contrast relates, not to Moses and God, but to
Moses and Christ. Now, Christ represents his Father rather than himself
as the Author of this gift, in order to procure for himself deeper
reverence; as if he had said, “Acknowledge me to be the minister of God,
by whose hands he wishes to feed you to eternal life.” But, again, this
appears to be inconsistent with the doctrine of Paul, who calls the
*manna* — *spiritual food*, (<span id="xii.v-p12.2"></span>[1Co
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003)<span id="xii.v-p12.2"></span>..md) I
reply, Christ speaks according to the capacity of those with whom he has
to deal, and this is not uncommon in Scripture. We see how variously
Paul speaks about circumcision. When he writes about the ordinance, he
calls it *the seal of faith*, (<span id="xii.v-p12.3"></span>[Ro
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011)<span id="xii.v-p12.3"></span>;.md)
but when he has to contend with false apostles, he calls it rather a
seal of cursing, and that by taking it with the qualities which they
ascribed to it, and according to their opinion.  <span
id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) Let us consider what was the objection
made against Christ, namely, that he did not prove himself to be the
Messiah, if he did not supply his followers with bodily food.
Accordingly, he does not inquire what it was that was prefigured by the
*manna,* but maintains that *the bread* with which *Moses* fed their
bellies was not *true bread.*

<span id="xii.v-p14"></span><span id="xii.v-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xii.v-p15"></span>**33.** *For the bread of God.* Christ
reasons negatively from the definition to the thing defined, in this
manner: “*The* *heavenly bread is that which hath come down from heaven
to give life to the world* In the *manna* there was nothing of this
sort; and, therefore, the *manna* was not *the heavenly bread*.” But, at
the same time, he confirms what he formerly said, namely, that he is
sent by the Father, in order that he may feed men in a manner far more
excellent than Moses. True, the *manna* came down *from* the visible
*heaven*, that is, from the clouds; but not from the eternal kingdom of
God, from which life flows to us. And the Jews, whom Christ addresses,
looked no higher than that the bellies of their fathers were well
stuffed and fattened in the wilderness.

<span id="xii.v-p16"></span>What he formerly called *the bread of
heaven,* he now calls *the bread of God;* not that the bread which
supports us in the present life comes from any other than God, but
because that alone can be reckoned *the bread of God*  <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) which quickens souls to a blessed
immortality. This passage teaches that the whole world is dead to God,
except so far as Christ quickens it, because life will be found nowhere
else than in him.

<span id="xii.v-p18"></span>*Which hath come down from heaven.* In the
*coming down from heaven* two things are worthy of observation; first,
that we have a Divine life in Christ, because he has come from God to be
the Author of life to us; secondly, that the heavenly life is near us,

<span id="xii.v-p19"></span>so that we do not need to fly above the
clouds or to cross the sea,

<span id="xii.vi-p2"></span>**34.** They said therefore to him, Lord,
give us always this bread. **35.** Jesus said to them, I am the bread of
life; he that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth in
me shall never thirst. **36.** But I have told you that you have also
seen me and do not believe. **37.** All that the Father giveth me shall
come to me; and him that cometh to me I will not cast out; **38.** For I
came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who
sent me. **39.** And this is the will of the Father who sent me, that of
all that he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up
again at the last day. **40.** And this is the will of him who sent me,
that whosoever seeth the Son, and believeth in him, shall have
everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

<span id="xii.vi-p4"></span><span id="xii.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vi-p5"></span>**34.** *Give us always this bread.* There
is no doubt that they speak ironically, to accuse Christ of vain
boasting, when he said that he was able to give *the bread of life.*
Thus wretched men, while they reject the promises of God, are not
satisfied with this evil alone, but put Christ in their room, as if he
were chargeable with their unbelief.

<span id="xii.vi-p6"></span><span id="xii.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vi-p7"></span>**35.** *I am the bread of life.* First, he
shows that *the bread*, which they asked in mockery, is before their
eyes; and, next, he reproves them. He begins with doctrine, to make it
more evident that they were guilty of ingratitude. There are two parts
of the doctrine; for he shows whence we ought to seek *life,* and how we
may enjoy it. We know what gave occasion to Christ to use those
metaphors; it was because *manna* and daily food had been mentioned. But
still this figure is better adapted to teach ignorant persons than a
simple style. When we eat *bread* for the nourishment of the body, we
see more clearly not only our own weakness, but also the power of divine
grace, than if, without, *bread,* God were to impart a secret power to
nourish the body itself. Thus, the analogy which is traced between the
body and the soul, enables us to perceive more clearly the grace of
Christ. For when we learn that Christ *is the bread* by which our souls
must be fed, this penetrates more deeply into our hearts than if Christ
simply said that *he is our life*

<span id="xii.vi-p8"></span>It ought to be observed, however, that the
word *bread* does not express the quickening power of Christ so fully as
we feel it; for *bread* does not commence *life,* but nourishes and
upholds that *life* which we already possess. But, through the kindness
of Christ, we not only continue to possess life, but have the beginning
of life, and therefore the comparison is partly inappropriate; but there
is no inconsistency in this, for Christ adapts his style to the
circumstances of the discourse which he formerly delivered. Now the
question had been raised, Which of the two was more eminent in feeding
men, Moses or Christ himself? This is also the reason why he calls it
*bread* only, for it was only the *manna* that they objected to him,
and, therefore, he reckoned it enough to contrast with it a different
kind of *bread* The simple doctrine is, “Our souls do not *live* by an
intrinsic power, so to speak, that is, by a power which they have
naturally in themselves,  <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) but
borrow *life* from Christ.”

<span id="xii.vi-p10"></span>*He who cometh to me.* He now defines the
way of taking this food; it is when we receive Christ by faith. For it
is of no avail to unbelievers that Christ is *the bread of life,*
because they remain always empty; but then does Christ become our
*bread,* when we come to him as hungry persons, that he may fill us. *To
come to Christ* and *to believe* mean, in this passage, the same thing;
but the former word is intended to express the effect of faith, namely,
that it is in consequence of being driven by the feeling of our hunger
that we fly to Christ to seek life.

<span id="xii.vi-p11"></span>Those who infer from this passage that *to
eat* Christ is *faith*, and nothing else, reason inconclusively. I
readily acknowledge that there is no other way in which we *eat* Christ
than by *believing*; but the *eating* is the effect and fruit of faith
rather than faith itself. For *faith* does not look at Christ only as at
a distance, but embraces him, that he may become ours and may dwell in
us. It causes us to be incorporated with him, to have life in common
with him, and, in short, *to become one with him*, (<span
id="xii.vi-p11.1"></span>[Joh
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021)<span id="xii.vi-p11.1"></span>..md)
It is therefore true that by faith alone we eat Christ, provided we also
understand in what manner faith unites us to him.

<span id="xii.vi-p12"></span>*Shall never thirst.* This appears to be
added without any good reason; for the office of *bread* is not to
quench *thirst*, but to allay hunger. Christ therefore attributes to
*bread* more than its nature allows. I have already said, that he
employs the word *bread* alone because it was required by the comparison
between the *manna* and the heavenly power of Christ, by which our souls
are sustained in life. At the same time, by the word *bread*, he means
in general all that nourishes us, and that according to the ordinary
custom of his nation. For the Hebrews, by the figure of speech called
synecdoche, use the word *bread* for *dinner* or *supper*; and when we
ask from God *our daily bread*, (<span id="xii.vi-p12.1"></span>[Mt
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#011)<span id="xii.vi-p12.1"></span>,.md)
we include drink and all the other parts of life. The meaning therefore
is, “Whoever shall betake himself to Christ, to have life from him, will
want nothing, but will have in abundance all that contributes to sustain
life.”

<span id="xii.vi-p13"></span><span id="xii.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vi-p14"></span>**36.** *But I have told you.* He now
reproves them for wickedly rejecting the gift of God, which is offered
to them. Now, that man is chargeable with wicked contempt of God, who
rejects what he knows that God has given him. If Christ had not made
known his power, and plainly showed that he came from God, the plea of
ignorance might have alleviated their guilt; but when they reject the
doctrine of him whom they formerly acknowledged to be the Lord’s
Messiah, it is extreme baseness. It is no doubt true, that men never
resist God purposely, so as to reflect that they have to do with God;
and to this applies the saying of Paul,

<span id="xii.vi-p15"></span>They would never have crucified the Lord of
glory, if they had known him  
(<span id="xii.vi-p15.2"></span>[1Co
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#008)<span id="xii.vi-p15.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xii.vi-p16"></span>But unbelievers, because they willingly
shut their eyes against the light are justly said to see that which
immediately vanishes from their sight, because Satan darkens their
understandings. This, at least, is beyond all controversy, that when he
said that they *saw*, we must not understand him to mean his bodily
appearance, but rather that he describes their voluntary blindness,
because they might have known what he was, if their malice had not
prevented them.

<span id="xii.vi-p17"></span><span id="xii.vi-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vi-p18"></span>**37.** *All that the Father giveth me.*
That their unbelief may not detract anything from his doctrine, he says,
that the cause of so great obstinacy is, that they are reprobate, and do
not belong to the flock of God. His intention, therefore, in
distinguishing here between the elect and the reprobate is, that the
authority of his doctrine may remain unimpaired, though there are many
who do not believe it. For, on the one hand, ungodly men calumniate and
utterly despise the word of God, because they are not moved by reverence
for it; and, on the other hand, many weak and ignorant persons entertain
doubts whether that which is rejected by a great part of the world be
actually the word of God. Christ meets this offense, when he affirms,
that all those who do not believe are not his own, and that we need not
wonder if such persons have no relish for the word of God, but that it
is embraced by all the children of God. In the first place, he says,
that *all whom the Father giveth him come to him*; by which words he
means, that faith is not a thing which depends on the will of men, so
that this man and that man indiscriminately and at random believe, but
that God elects those whom he hands over, as it were, to his Son; for
when he says, that *whatever is given cometh*, we infer from it, that
all do not come. Again, we infer, that God works in his elect by such an
efficacy of the Holy Spirit, that not one of them falls away; for the
word *give* has the same meaning as if Christ had said, “Those whom the
Father hath chosen he regenerates, and gives to me, that they may obey
the Gospel.”

<span id="xii.vi-p19"></span>*And him that cometh to me I will not cast
out.* This is added for the consolation of the godly, that they may be
fully persuaded that they have free access to Christ by faith, and that,
as soon as they have placed themselves under his protection and
safeguard, they will be graciously received by him. Hence it follows,
that the doctrine of the Gospel will be salutary to all believers,
because no man becomes a disciple of Christ who does not, on the other
hand, feel and experience him to be a good and faithful teacher.

<span id="xii.vi-p20"></span><span id="xii.vi-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vi-p21"></span>**38.** *For I came down from heaven.* This
is a confirmation of the preceding statement, that we do not seek Christ
in vain. For faith is a work of God, by which he shows that we are his
people, and appoints his Son to be the protector of our salvation. Now
the Son has no other design than to fulfill the commands of his Father.
Consequently, he will never reject those whom his Father hath sent.
Hence, finally, it follows, that faith will never be useless. As to the
distinction which Christ makes between his own will and the will of the
Father, in this respect, he accommodates himself to his hearers,
because, as the mind of man is prone to distrust, we are wont to
contrive some diversity which produces hesitation. To cut off every
pretense for those wicked imaginations, Christ declares, that he has
been manifested to the world, in order that he may actually ratify what
the Father hath decreed concerning our salvation.

<span id="xii.vi-p22"></span><span id="xii.vi-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vi-p23"></span>**39.** *And this is the will of the
Father.* He now testifies, that this is the design of the Father, that
believers may find salvation secured in Christ; from which again it
follows, that all who do not profit by the doctrine of the Gospel are
reprobate. Wherefore, if we see that it turns to the ruin of many, we
have no reason to despond, because those men willingly draw down the
evil on themselves. Let us rest satisfied with this, that the Gospel
will always have power to gather the elect to salvation.

<span id="xii.vi-p24"></span>*That I should lose none of it.* That is,
“That I should not suffer it to be taken from me or perish;” by which he
means, that he is not the guardian of our salvation for a single day, or
for a few days, but that he will take care of it to the end, so that he
will conduct us, as it were, from the commencement to the termination of
our course; and therefore he mentions the last resurrection. This
promise is highly necessary for us, who miserably groan under so great
weakness of the flesh, of which every one of us is sufficiently aware;
and at every moment, indeed, the salvation of the whole world might be
ruined, were it not that believers, supported by the hand of Christ,
advance boldly to the day of resurrection. Let this, therefore, be fixed
in our minds, that Christ has stretched out his hand to us, that he may
not desert us in the midst of the course, but that, relying on his
goodness, we may boldly raise our eyes to the last day.

<span id="xii.vi-p25"></span>There is also another reason why he
mentions the resurrection. It is because, so long as *our life is
hidden*, (<span id="xii.vi-p25.1"></span>[Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003)<span id="xii.vi-p25.1"></span>,.md)
we are like dead men. For in what respect do believers differ from
wicked men, but that, overwhelmed with afflictions, and *like sheep
destined for the slaughter*, (<span id="xii.vi-p25.2"></span>[Ro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036)<span id="xii.vi-p25.2"></span>,.md)
they have always one foot in the grave, and, indeed, are not far from
being continually swallowed up by death? Thus there remains no other
support of our faith and patience but this, that we keep out of view the
condition of the present life, and apply our minds and our senses to the
last day, and pass through the obstructions of the world, until the
fruit of our faith at length appear.

<span id="xii.vi-p26"></span><span id="xii.vi-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vi-p27"></span>**40.** *And this is the will of him who
sent me.* He had said that the Father had committed to him the
protection of our salvation; and now he likewise describes the manner in
which it is accomplished. The way to obtain salvation, therefore, is to
obey the Gospel of Christ. This point he had, indeed, glanced at a
little before but now he expresses more fully what he had spoken
somewhat obscurely. And if it is the will of God that those whom he has
elected shall be saved, and if in this manner he ratifies and executes
his eternal decree, whoever he be that is not satisfied with Christ, but
indulges in curious inquiries about eternal predestination, such a
person, as far as lies in his power, desires to be saved contrary to the
purpose of God. The election of God is in itself hidden and secret; the
Lord manifests it *by calling*, that is, when he bestows on us this
blessing *of calling us*  <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md)

<span id="xii.vi-p29"></span>They are madmen, therefore, who seek their
own salvation or that of others in the whirlpool of predestination, not
keeping the way of salvation which is exhibited to them. Nay more, by
this foolish speculation, they endeavor to overturn the force and effect
of predestination; for if God has elected us to this end, that we may
believe, take away faith, and election will be imperfect. But we have no
right to break through the order and succession of the beginning and the
end, since God, by his purpose, hath decreed and determined *that* it
shall proceed unbroken.  <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md)
Besides, as the election of God, by an indissoluble bond, draws his
calling along with it, so when God has effectually called us to faith in
Christ, let this have as much weight with us as if he had engraven his
seal to ratify his decree concerning our salvation. For the testimony of
the Holy Spirit is nothing else than the sealing of our adoption, (<span
id="xii.vi-p30.2"></span>[Ro 8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md)<span
id="xii.vi-p30.2"></span>.) To every man, therefore, his faith is a
sufficient attestation of the eternal predestination of God, so that it
would be a shocking sacrilege  <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md)
to carry the inquiry farther; for that man offers an aggravated insult
to the Holy Spirit, who refuses to assent to his simple testimony.

<span id="xii.vi-p32"></span>*Whosoever seeth the Son, and believeth in
him.* He uses the words, *see and believe,* in contrast with what he had
formerly said; for he had reproached the Jews with *not believing*,
*even though they saw*, (verse 36.) But now, speaking of the sons of
God, with the feeling which they have of the power of God in Christ, he
joins the obedience of faith. Moreover, these words show that faith
proceeds from the knowledge of Christ; not that it desires anything
beyond the simple word of God, but because, if we trust in Christ, we
must perceive what he is, and what he brings to us.

<span id="xii.vii"></span>

<span id="xii.vii-p1"></span><span id="xii.vii-p1.1"></span>[John
6:41-45](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#041.md)<span id="xii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vii-p2"></span>**41.** The Jews therefore murmured
concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which have come down
from heaven. **42.** And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of
Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How therefore doth he say, I
have come down from heaven? **43.** Jesus therefore answered, and said
to them, Murmur not among yourselves. **44.** No man can come to me,
unless the Father, who hath sent me, draw him; and I will raise him up
at the last day. **45.** It is written in the Prophets, And they shall
be all taught by God; whosoever therefore hath heard my Father, and hath
learned,  <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) cometh to me.

<span id="xii.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.vii-p5"></span><span id="xii.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vii-p6"></span>**41.** *The Jews therefore murmured
concerning him.* The Evangelist explains the cause of the murmuring to
have been, that the Jews were offended at the mean condition of Christ’s
human nature,  <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) and did not
perceive in him any thing Divine or heavenly. Yet he shows that they had
a twofold obstruction. One they had framed for themselves out of a false
opinion, when they said, *Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose
father and mother we hnow?* Another arose from a wicked sentiment, that
they did not think that Christ was the Son of God, because he came down
to men clothed with our flesh.  <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md)
But we are guilty of excessive malignity, if we despise the Lord of
glory because on our account

<span id="xii.vii-p9"></span>he emptied himself, and took upon him the
form of a servant,  
(<span id="xii.vii-p9.2"></span>[Php
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)<span id="xii.vii-p9.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="xii.vii-p10"></span>for this was rather an illustrious proof
of his boundless love towards us, and of his wonderful grace. Besides,
the Divine majesty of Christ was not so concealed under the mean and
contemptible appearance of the flesh, as not to give out the rays of his
brightness in a variety of ways; but those gross and stupid men wanted
eyes to see his conspicuous glory.

<span id="xii.vii-p11"></span>We, too, sin daily in both of these ways.
First, it is a great hinderance to us, that it is only with carnal eyes
that we behold Christ; and this is the reason why we perceive in him
nothing magnificent, for by our sinful views we pervert all that belongs
to him and to his doctrine, so unskilful are we to profit by them, or to
view them in the proper light.  <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md)
Secondly, not satisfied with this, we adopt many false imaginations,
which produce a contempt of the Gospel. Nay, there are even many who
frame for themselves monsters, that they may make them a pretense for
hating the Gospel. In this manner the world deliberately drives away the
grace of God. Now the Evangelist expressly names the Jews, in order to
inform us that the *murmuring* proceeded from those who gloried in the
title of faith and of the Church, that we may all learn to receive
Christ with reverence, when he *comes down to us*, and that, in
proportion as he comes nearer to us, we may more cheerfully approach to
him, that he may raise us to his heavenly glory.

<span id="xii.vii-p13"></span><span id="xii.vii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vii-p14"></span>**43.** *Murmur not among yourselves.* He
throws back on them the blame of the *murmuring*, as if he had said, “My
doctrine contains no ground of offense, but because you are reprobate,
it irritates your envenomed breasts, and the reason why you do not
relish it is, that you have a vitiated taste.”

<span id="xii.vii-p15"></span><span id="xii.vii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vii-p16"></span>**44.** *No man can come to me, unless the
Father, who hath sent me, draw him.* He does not merely accuse them of
wickedness, but likewise reminds them, that it is a peculiar gift of God
to embrace the doctrine which is exhibited by him; which he does, that
their unbelief may not disturb weak minds. For many are so foolish that,
in the things of God, they depend on the opinions of men; in consequence
of which, they entertain suspicions about the Gospel, as soon as they
see that it is not received by the world. Unbelievers, on the other
hand, flattering themselves in their obstinacy, have the hardihood to
condemn the Gospel because it does not please them. On the contrary,
therefore, Christ declares that the doctrine of the Gospel, though it is
preached to all without exception, cannot be embraced by all, but that a
new understanding and a new perception are requisite; and, therefore,
that faith does not depend on the will of men, but that it is God who
gives it.

<span id="xii.vii-p17"></span>*Unless the Father draw him.* To *come to
Christ* being here used metaphorically for *believing*, the Evangelist,
in order to carry out the metaphor in the apposite clause, says that
those persons are *drawn* whose understandings God enlightens, and whose
hearts he bends and forms to the obedience of Christ. The statement
amounts to this, that we ought not to wonder if many refuse to embrace
the Gospel; because no man will ever of himself be able to come to
Christ, but God must first approach him by his Spirit; and hence it
follows that all are not *drawn*, but that God bestows this grace on
those whom he has elected. True, indeed, as to the kind of *drawing*, it
is not violent, so as to compel men by external force; but still it is a
powerful impulse of the Holy Spirit, which makes men willing who
formerly were unwilling and reluctant. It is a false and profane
assertion, therefore, that none are *drawn* but those who are willing to
be *drawn*,  <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) as if man made
himself obedient to God by his own efforts; for the willingness with
which men follow God is what they already have from himself, who has
formed their hearts to obey him.

<span id="xii.vii-p19"></span><span id="xii.vii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vii-p20"></span>**45.** *It is written in the Prophets.*
Christ confirms by the testimony of Isaiah what he said, that *no man
can come to him*, *unless he be drawn by the Father* He uses the word
*prophets* in the plural number, because all their prophecies had been
collected into one volume, so that all *the prophets* might justly be
accounted one book. The passage which is here quoted is to be found in
<span id="xii.vii-p20.1"></span>[Isa
54:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#013.md)<span id="xii.vii-p20.1"></span>,
where, speaking of the restoration of the Church, he promises to her,
*sons taught by the instruction of God* Hence it may easily be inferred,
that the Church cannot be restored in any other way than by God
undertaking the office of a Teacher, and bringing believers to himself.
The way of teaching, of which the prophet speaks, does not consist
merely in the external voice, but likewise in the secret operation of
the Holy Spirit. In short, this *teaching* of God is the inward
illumination of the heart.

<span id="xii.vii-p21"></span>*And they shall be all taught by God.* As
to the word *all,* it must be limited to the elect, who alone are the
true children of the Church. Now it is not difficult to see in what
manner Christ applies this prediction to the present subject. Isaiah
shows that then only is the Church truly edified, when she has *her
children taught by God* Christ, therefore, justly concludes that men
have not eyes to behold the light of life, until God has opened them.
But at the same time, he fastens on the general phrase, *all;* because
he argues from it, that *all* who are *taught by God* are effectually
drawn, so as to come; and to this relates what he immediately adds,

<span id="xii.vii-p22"></span>*Whosoever therefore hath heard my
Father.* The amount of what is said is, that all who do not believe are
reprobate and doomed to destruction; because all *the sons* of the
Church and heirs of life are made by God to be his obedient disciples.
Hence it follows, that there is not one of all the elect of God who
shall not be a partaker of faith in Christ.  <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) Again, as Christ formerly affirmed
that men are not fitted for believing, until they have been *drawn*, so
he now declares that the grace of Christ, by which they are *drawn*, is
efficacious, so that they necessarily believe.

<span id="xii.vii-p24"></span>These two clauses utterly overturn the
whole power of free will, of which the Papists dream. For if it be only
when the Father has *drawn* us that we begin to *come to Christ,* there
is not in us any commencement of faith, or any preparation for it. On
the other hand, if all come *whom the Father hath taught*, He gives to
them not only the choice of believing, but faith itself. When,
therefore, we willingly yield to the guidance of the Spirit, this is a
part, and, as it were, a sealing of grace; because God would not *draw*
us, if He were only to stretch out his hand, and leave our will in a
state of suspense. But in strict propriety of language He is said to
draw us, when He extends the power of his Spirit to the full effect of
faith. They are said to *hear* God, who willingly assent to God speaking
to them within, because the Holy Spirit reigns in their hearts.

<span id="xii.vii-p25"></span>*Cometh to me.* He shows the inseparable
connection that exists between him and the Father. For the meaning is,
that it is impossible that any who are God’s disciples shall not obey
Christ, and that they who reject Christ refuse to be *taught by God;*
because the only wisdom that all the elect learn in the school of God
is, to come to Christ; for the Father, who sent him, cannot deny
himself.

<span id="xii.viii-p4"></span><span id="xii.viii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p5"></span>**46.** *Not that any man hath seen the
Father.* As he has hitherto magnified the grace of his Father, so now he
earnestly directs believers to himself alone. For both must be joined
together; that no knowledge of Christ can be obtained, until the Father
enlighten by his Spirit those who are by nature blind; and yet that it
is in vain to seek God, unless Christ go before; for the majesty of God
is so lofty, that the senses of men cannot reach him. Nay, more, all
that knowledge of God which men may think that they have attained out of
Christ will be a deadly abyss. When he says that he alone hath known the
Father, he means that it is an office which belongs peculiarly to
himself, to manifest God to men, who would otherwise have been
concealed.

<span id="xii.viii-p6"></span><span id="xii.viii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p7"></span>**47.** *He who believeth in me.* This is
an explanation of the former statement. For we are taught by these words
that it is when we believe in Christ that God is made known to us; for
then do we begin to see, as in a mirror, or as in a bright and lively
image, God who was formerly invisible. Accursed then be every thing that
is declared to us concerning God, if it do not lead us to Christ. What
it is to believe in Christ I have already explained; for we must not
imagine a confused and empty faith, which deprives Christ of his power,
as the Papists do, who believe in Christ just as far as they think fit.
For the reason why we obtain life by faith is, that we know that all the
parts of our life are contained in Christ.

<span id="xii.viii-p8"></span>The inference which some draw from this
passage — that *to* *believe in Christ* is the same thing as *to eat
Christ*, or *his flesh* — is not well founded. For these two things
differ from each other as former and latter; and in like manner, to
*come to Christ* and to *drink* him, for *coming to him* is first in
order. I acknowledge that Christ is not eaten but by faith; but the
reason is, because we receive him by faith, that he may dwell in us, and
that we may be made partakers of him, and thus may be one with him. To
*eat* him, therefore, is an effect or work of faith.

<span id="xii.viii-p9"></span><span id="xii.viii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p10"></span>**48.** *I am the bread of life* Besides
what he formerly said, that he is the life-giving *bread,* by which our
souls are nourished, in order to explain it more fully, he likewise
repeats the contrast between this *bread* and the ancient manna,
together with a comparison of the men.

<span id="xii.viii-p11"></span><span id="xii.viii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p12"></span>**49.** *Your fathers ate manna in the
wilderness, and are dead.* He says that the *manna* was a perishing food
to *their fathers,* for it did not free them from death. It follows,
therefore, that souls do not find anywhere else than in him that food by
which they are fed to spiritual life. Besides, we must keep in
remembrance what I formerly stated, that what is here said does not
relate to the *manna,* so far as it was a secret figure of Christ; for
in that respect Paul calls it *spiritual food*, (<span
id="xii.viii-p12.1"></span>[1Co
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#003.md)<span
id="xii.viii-p12.1"></span>.) But we have said that Christ here
accommodates his discourse to the hearers, who, caring only about
feeding the belly, looked for nothing higher in the *manna.* Justly,
therefore does he declare that *their fathers are dead,* that is, those
who in the same manner, were devoted to the belly, or, in other words,
who thought of nothing higher than this world.  <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) And yet he invites them to *eat,* when
he says that he has come, *that any man may eat;* for this mode of
expression has the same meaning as if he said, that he is ready to give
himself to all, provided that they are only willing to believe. That not
one of those who have once eaten Christ *shall die* — must be understood
to mean, that the life which he bestows on us is never extinguished, as
we stated under the Fifth Chapter.

<span id="xii.viii-p14"></span><span id="xii.viii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p15"></span>**51.** *I am the living bread.* He often
repeats the same thing, because nothing is more necessary to be known;
and every one feels in himself with what difficulty we are brought to
believe it, and how easily and quickly it passes away and is forgotten.
 <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) We all desire life, but in
seeking it, we foolishly and improperly wander about in circuitous
roads; and when it is offered, the greater part disdainfully reject it.
For who is there that does not contrive for himself life out of Christ?
And how few are there who are satisfied with Christ alone! It is not a
superfluous repetition, therefore, when Christ asserts so frequently
that he alone is sufficient to give life. For he claims for himself the
designation of *bread*, in order to tear from our hearts all fallacious
hopes of living. Having formerly called himself *the bread of life*, he
now calls himself *the living bread*, but in the same sense, namely,
*life-giving bread*. — *Which have come down from heaven* He frequently
mentions his *coming down from heaven*, because spiritual and
incorruptible life will not be found in this world, the fashion of which
passes away and vanishes, but only in the heavenly kingdom of God.

<span id="xii.viii-p17"></span>*If any man eat of this bread.* Whenever
he uses the word *eat,* he exhorts us to faith, which alone enables us
to enjoy this bread, so as to derive life from it.  <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) Nor is it without good reason that he
does so, for there are few who deign to stretch out their hand to put
this bread to their mouth; and even when the Lord puts it into their
mouth, there are few who relish it, but some are filled with wind, and
others — like Tantalus — are dying of hunger through their own folly,
while the food is close beside them.

<span id="xii.viii-p19"></span>*The bread which I shall give is my
flesh.* As this secret power to bestow life, of which he has spoken,
might be referred to his Divine essence, he now comes down to the second
step, and shows that this *life* is placed *in his flesh*, that it may
be drawn out of it. It is, undoubtedly, a wonderful purpose of God that
he has exhibited *life* to us in that *flesh,* where formerly there was
nothing but the cause of death. And thus he provides for our weakness,
when he does not call us above the clouds to enjoy life, but displays it
on earth, in the same manner as if he were exalting us to the secrets of
his kingdom. And yet, while he corrects the pride of our mind, he tries
the humility and obedience of our faith, when he enjoins those who would
seek *life* to place reliance on *his flesh,* which is contemptible in
its appearance.

<span id="xii.viii-p20"></span>But an objection is brought, that the
flesh of Christ cannot give life, because it was liable to death, and
because even now it is not immortal in itself; and next, that it does
not at all belong to the nature of flesh to quicken souls. I reply,
though this power comes from another source than from the flesh, still
this is no reason why the designation may not accurately apply to it;
for as the eternal Word of God is the fountain of *life*, (<span
id="xii.viii-p20.1"></span>[Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004)<span id="xii.viii-p20.1"></span>,.md)
so his flesh, as a channel, conveys to us that *life* which dwells
intrinsically, as we say, in his Divinity. And in this sense it is
called life-giving, because it conveys to us that life which it borrows
for us from another quarter. This will not be difficult to understand,
if we consider what is the cause of life, namely, righteousness. And
though righteousness flows from God alone, still we shall not attain the
full manifestation of it any where else than in the flesh of Christ; for
in it was accomplished the redemption of man, in it a sacrifice was
offered to atone for sins, and an obedience yielded to God, to reconcile
him to us; it was also filled with the sanctification of the Spirit, and
at length, having vanquished death, it was received into the heavenly
glory. It follows, therefore that all the parts of life have been placed
in it, that no man may have reason to complain that he is deprived of
life, as if it were placed in concealment, or at a distance.

<span id="xii.viii-p21"></span>*Which I shall give for the life of the
world.* The word *give* is used in various senses. The first *giving*,
of which he has formerly spoken, is made daily, whenever Christ offers
himself to us. Secondly, it denotes that singular *giving* which was
done on the cross, when he offered himself as a sacrifice to his Father;
for then he delivered himself up to death for the life of men, and now
he invites us to enjoy the fruit of his death. For it would be of no
avail to us that that sacrifice was once offered, if we did not now
feast on that sacred banquet. It ought also to be observed, that Christ
claims for himself the office of sacrificing his flesh. Hence it appears
with what wicked sacrilege the Papists pollute themselves, when they
take upon themselves, in the mass, what belonged exclusively to that one
High Priest.

themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? **53.**
Jesus therefore said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Unless you
eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have not life
in you. **54.** He who eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath
eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. **55.** For my
flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink. **56.** He who eateth
my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. **57.**
As the living Father hath sent me, and I live on account of my Father;
and he who eateth me, even he shall live for my sake. **58.** This is
the bread which hath come down from heaven; not as your fathers ate

<span id="xii.ix-p3"></span> 

<span id="xii.ix-p4"></span><span id="xii.ix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ix-p5"></span>**52.** *The Jews therefore debated among
themselves.* He again mentions the Jews, not by way of honor, but to
reproach them with their unbelief, because they do not receive the well
known doctrine concerning eternal life, or, at least, do not inquire
modestly into the subject, if it be still obscure and doubtful. For when
he says that they *debated,* it is a sign of obstinacy and contempt; and
those who dispute so keenly do, indeed, block up against themselves the
road to the knowledge of the truth. And yet the blame imputed to them is
not simply that they inquired into the manner; for the same blame would
fall on Abraham and the blessed Virgin, (<span
id="xii.ix-p5.1"></span>[Ge 15:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#002.md)<span
id="xii.ix-p5.1"></span>; <span id="xii.ix-p5.2"></span>[Lu
1:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#034)<span id="xii.ix-p5.2"></span>..md)
Those persons, therefore, are either led astray through ignorance, or
are deficient in candour, who, without taking into account the hardihood
and eagerness to quarrel, which alone the Evangelist condemns, direct
all their outcry against the word *how;* as if it had not been lawful
for the Jews to inquire about the manner of *eating the flesh of Christ*
 <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) But it ought rather to be
imputed to sloth than ascribed to the obedience of faith, if we
knowingly and willingly leave unsolved those doubts and difficulties
which are removed for us by the word of the Lord. Not only is it lawful,
therefore, to inquire as to the manner of *eating the flesh of Christ*,
but it is of great importance for us to understand it, so far as it is
made known by the Scriptures. Away, then, with that fierce and obstinate
pretense of humility, “For my part, I am satisfied with that single word
of Christ, when he declares that hi*s flesh is truly food*: to all the
rest I willingly shut my eyes.” As if heretics would not have equal
plausibility on their side, if they willingly were ignorant that Christ
was conceived by the Holy Ghost, because, believing that he is the seed
of Abraham, they make no farther inquiry. Only we ought to preserve such
moderation about the secret works of God, as not to desire to know
anything more than what he determines by his word.

<span id="xii.ix-p7"></span><span id="xii.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ix-p8"></span>**53.** *Verily, verily, I say to you.* The
just resentment which Christ felt,  <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) when he saw his grace rejected with
such haughty disdain, constrained him to employ this oath. For he does
not now make use of simple doctrine, but likewise mingles threatenings
for the purpose of striking terror. He denounces eternal perdition
against all who refuse to seek life from his flesh; as if he had said,
“If you hold my flesh in contempt, rest assured that there remains for
you no other hope of life.” The vengeance that awaits all despisers of
the grace of Christ is, that with their pride they miserably perish; and
the reason why they must be urged with plainness and severity is, that
they may not continue to flatter themselves. For if we threaten with
death those diseased persons who refuse to take medicines, what must we
do with wicked men, when they strive, as far as lies in their power, to
destroy *life* itself?

<span id="xii.ix-p10"></span>*Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of
man.* When he says*, the flesh of the Son of man,* the expression is
emphatic; for he reproves them for their contempt, which arose from
perceiving that he resembled other men. The meaning therefore is:
“Despise me as much as you please, on account of the mean and despicable
appearance of *my flesh*, still that despicable *flesh* contains *life;*
and if you are destitute of it, you will nowhere else find any thing
else to quicken you.”

<span id="xii.ix-p11"></span>The ancients fell into a gross error by
supposing that little children were deprived of eternal *life,* if they
did not dispense to them the eucharist, that is, the Lord’s Supper;
 <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) for this discourse does not
relate to the Lord’s Supper, but to the uninterrupted communication *of
the flesh of Christ*,  <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) which we
obtain apart from the use of the Lord’s Supper. Nor were the Bohemians
in the right, when they adduced this passage to prove that all without
exception ought to be admitted to the use of the cup. With respect to
young children, the ordinance of Christ forbids them to partake of the
Lord’s Supper; because they are not yet able to know or to celebrate the
remembrance of the death of Christ. The same ordinance makes *the cup*
common to all, for it commands us *all to drink of it*, (<span
id="xii.ix-p13.2"></span>[Mt
26:27](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#027)<span id="xii.ix-p13.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xii.ix-p14"></span><span id="xii.ix-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ix-p15"></span>**54.** *He who eateth my flesh.* This is a
repetition, but is not superfluous; for it confirms what was difficult
to be believed, That souls feed on *his flesh and blood*, in precisely
the same manner that the body is sustained by *eating and drinking*
Accordingly, as he lately testified that nothing but death remains for
all who seek life anywhere else than in *his flesh*, so now he excites
all believers  <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) to cherish good
hope, while he promises to them *life* in the same *flesh.*

<span id="xii.ix-p17"></span>*And I will raise him up at the last day.*
It ought to be observed, that Christ so frequently connects *the
resurrection* with eternal life, because our salvation will be hidden
till that day. No man, therefore, can perceive what Christ bestows on
us, unless, rising above the world, he places before his eyes the last
*resurrection* From these words, it plainly appears that the whole of
this passage is improperly explained, as applied to the Lord’s Supper.
For if it were true that all who present themselves at the holy table of
the Lord are made partakers of his flesh and blood, all will, in like
manner, obtain *life;* but we know that there are many who partake of it
to their condemnation. And indeed it would have been foolish and
unreasonable to discourse about the Lord’s Supper, before he had
instituted it. It is certain, then, that he now speaks of the perpetual
and ordinary manner of eating the flesh of Christ, which is done by
faith only.  <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) And yet, at the
same time, I acknowledge that there is nothing said here that is not
figuratively represented, and actually bestowed on believers, in the
Lord’s Supper; and Christ even intended that the holy Supper should be,
as it were, a seal and confirmation  <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) of this sermon. This is also the
reason why the Evangelist John makes no mention of the Lord’s Supper;
and therefore Augustine follows the natural order, when, in explaining
this chapter, he does not touch on the Lord’s Supper till he comes to
the conclusion; and then he shows that this mystery is symbolically
represented, whenever the Churches celebrate the Lord’s Supper, in some
places daily, and in other places only on the Lord’s day.

<span id="xii.ix-p20"></span><span id="xii.ix-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ix-p21"></span>**55.** *For my flesh is truly food.* He
confirms the same statement by other words, “As the body is weakened and
consumed by the want of food, so the soul, if it be not fed with
heavenly bread, will soon perish with hunger.” For when he declares that
*his flesh is truly food,* he means that souls are famished, if they
want that food. Then only wilt thou find life in Christ, when thou shalt
seek the nourishment of life in his flesh. Thus we ought to boast, with
Paul, that we reckon nothing to be excellent but Christ crucified;
because, as soon as we have departed from the sacrifice of his death, we
meet with nothing but death; nor is there any other road that conducts
us to a perception of his Divine power than through his death and
resurrection. Embrace Christ, therefore, as *the Servant of the Father*,
(<span id="xii.ix-p21.1"></span>[Isa
42:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001)<span id="xii.ix-p21.1"></span>,.md)
that he may show himself to thee to be *the Prince of life*, (<span
id="xii.ix-p21.2"></span>[Ac 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#015.md)<span
id="xii.ix-p21.2"></span>.) For when *he emptied himself*, (<span
id="xii.ix-p21.3"></span>[Php 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md)<span
id="xii.ix-p21.3"></span>,) in this manner we were enriched with
abundance of all blessings; his humiliation and descent into hell raised
us to heaven; and, by enduring the curse of his cross, he erected the
banner of our righteousness as a splendid memorial of his victory.
 <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) Consequently, they are false
expounders of the mystery of the Lord’s Supper,  <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) who draw away souls from the flesh of
Christ.

<span id="xii.ix-p24"></span>*And my blood is truly drink.* But why does
Christ mention *his blood* separately, when it is included in the word
*flesh*? I reply, he did so in condescension to our weakness. For when
he expressly mentions *food and drink,* he declares that the life which
he bestows is complete in every respect, that we may not imagine to
ourselves a life which is only half or imperfect; as if he had said,
that we shall want nothing that belongs to life, provided that we *eat
his flesh and drink his blood.* Thus also in the Lord’s Supper, which
corresponds to this doctrine, not satisfied with the symbol of *the
bread*, he adds also *the cup*, that, having in him a twofold pledge, we
may learn to be satisfied with him alone; for never will a man find a
part of life in Christ, until he has entire and complete life in him.

<span id="xii.ix-p25"></span><span id="xii.ix-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ix-p26"></span>**56.** *He who eateth my flesh.* This is
another confirmation; for while he alone has life in himself, he shows
how we may enjoy it, that is, by *eating his flesh*; as if he had
affirmed that there is no other way in which he can become ours, than by
our faith being directed to his flesh. For no one will ever come to
Christ as God, who despises him as man; and, therefore, if you wish to
have any interest in Christ, you must take care, above all things, that
you do not disdain his flesh.

<span id="xii.ix-p27"></span>*Dwelleth in me, and I in him.* When he
says that he *dwelleth in us*, the meaning is the same as if he had
said, that the only bond of union, and the way by which he becomes one
with us, is, when our faith relies on his death. We may likewise infer
from it, that he is not now speaking of the outward symbol, which many
unbelievers receive equally with believers, and yet continue separated
from Christ. It enables us also to refute the dream of those who say,
that Judas received the body of Christ as well as the other apostles,
when Christ gave the bread to all; for as it is a display of ignorance
to limit this doctrine to the outward sign, so we ought to remember what
I have formerly said, that the doctrine which is here taught is sealed
in the Lord’s Supper. Now, it is certain, in the first place, that Judas
never was a member of Christ; secondly, it is highly unreasonable to
imagine *the flesh of Christ* to be dead and destitute of the Holy
Spirit; and, lastly, it is a mockery to dream of any way of *eating the
flesh of Christ* without faith, since faith alone is the mouth — so to
speak — and the stomach of the soul.

<span id="xii.ix-p28"></span><span id="xii.ix-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ix-p29"></span>**57.** *As the living Father hath sent
me.* Hitherto Christ has explained the manner in which we must become
partakers of life. He now comes to speak of the principal cause, for the
first source of life is in the Father. But he meets an objection, for it
might be thought that he took away from God what belonged to him, when
he made himself the cause of life. He makes himself, therefore, to be
the Author of life, in such a manner, as to acknowledge that there was
another who gave him what he administers to others.

<span id="xii.ix-p30"></span>Let us observe, that this discourse also is
accommodated to the capacity of those to whom Christ was speaking; for
it is only with respect to his flesh that he compares himself to the
Father. For though the Father is the beginning of *life,* yet the
eternal Word himself is strictly *life* But the eternal Divinity of
Christ is not the present subject; for he exhibits himself such as he
was manifested to the world, clothed with our flesh.

<span id="xii.ix-p31"></span>*I also live on account of the Father.*
This does not apply to his Divinity simply, nor does it apply to his
human nature simply and by itself, but it is a description of the Son of
God manifested in the flesh. Besides, we know that it is not unusual
with Christ to ascribe to the Father every thing Divine which he had in
himself. It must be observed, however, that he points out here three
degrees of life. In the first rank is the living Father, who is the
source, but remote and hidden. Next follows the Son, who is exhibited to
us as an open fountain, and by whom life flows to us. The third is, the
life which we draw from him. We now perceive what is stated to amount to
this, that God the Father, in whom life dwells, is at a great distance
from us, and that Christ, placed between us, is the second cause of
life, in order that what would otherwise be concealed in God may proceed
from him to us.

<span id="xii.ix-p32"></span><span id="xii.ix-p32.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ix-p33"></span>**58.** *This is the bread which came down
from heaven.* He returns to the comparison between *the manna* and *his
flesh,* with which he had begun; for it was necessary that he should
close the sermon in this manner: “There is no reason why you should
prefer Moses to me, because he fed your fathers in the wilderness; since
I supply you with far more excellent food, for I bring heavenly life
with me.” For — as was formerly said — the bread is said to have come
down from heaven, because it has nothing earthly or corruptible in its
nature, but breathes the immortality of the kingdom of God. They who
were only bent on feeding the belly, did not find such virtue in the
*manna;* for while the *manna* had a twofold use, the Jews, with whom
Christ is now disputing, beheld in it nothing else than bodily food. But
the life of the soul is not fading, but makes continual progress until
the whole man is renewed.

<span id="xii.x-p2"></span>**59** He spoke these things in the
synagogue, while he was teaching in Capernaum. **60.** Many of his
disciples, therefore, having heard it, said, This is a harsh saying;
 <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) who can hear it? **61.** But
Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to
them, Doth this offend you? **62.** What if you shall see the Son of man
ascend to where he was before? **63.** It is the Spirit that quickeneth;
the flesh profiteth nothing. The words which I speak to you are spirit
and life. **64.** But there are some of you who do not believe. For
Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe, and
who he was that would betray him.

<span id="xii.x-p5"></span><span id="xii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p6"></span>**59.** *He spoke these things in the
synagogue.* John points out the place, that we may know that there were
many present, and likewise, that a sermon was delivered as on a weighty
and important subject. But it immediately follows that out of so great a
multitude there were scarcely to be found a very few who profited by it;
and — what is worse — it proved to be the occasion of desertion to many
who professed to be disciples of Christ. If the Evangelist had said that
only some of them were offended, that ought to have been accounted
monstrous; but when they rise up in crowds and conspire together against
him, what name shall we give to such an action? Let this narrative then
be deeply impressed on our minds, that we may never murmur against
Christ when he speaks; and if in the present day we perceive any thing
of this kind in others, let not their pride disturb our faith.

<span id="xii.x-p7"></span><span id="xii.x-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p8"></span>**60.** *This is a harsh saying.* On the
contrary, it was in their hearts, and not in the *saying,* that the
*harshness* lay. But out of the word of God the reprobate are thus
accustomed to form stones to dash themselves upon, and when, by their
hardened obstinacy, they rush against Christ, they complain that *his
saying is harsh*, which ought rather to have softened them. For whoever
shall submit with true humility  <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md)
to the doctrine of Christ will find nothing in it *harsh* or
disagreeable; but to unbelievers, who oppose themselves with obstinacy,
it will be *a hammer which breaketh the rocks in pieces*, as the Prophet
calls it, (<span id="xii.x-p9.2"></span>[Jer
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029)<span id="xii.x-p9.2"></span>..md)
But since the same hardness is natural to us all, if we judge of the
doctrine of Christ according to our feelings, his words will be just so
many strange and incredible  <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md)
statements. All that remains for us, therefore, is, that every one
commit himself to the guidance of the Spirit, that he may inscribe on
our hearts what otherwise would never have even entered into our ears.

<span id="xii.x-p11"></span>*Who can hear it?* Here we see the awful
wickedness of unbelief; for they who impiously and basely reject the
doctrine of salvation, not satisfied with excusing themselves, have the
hardihood to put the Son of God in their room as if he were guilty, and
to declare that he is unworthy of being *heard* Thus, in the present
day, Papists not only reject the Gospel in a daring manner, but likewise
break out into horrid blasphemies, that it may not be thought that they
have no good reason for opposing God. And, indeed, since they desire
darkness, we need not wonder if Satan deceives them by strange monsters,
where there is nothing but the open highway.  <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) But that which they, through their
rage and fury, cannot endure will not only be tolerable to modest and
teachable persons, but will support and comfort them. Yet the reprobate,
by their obstinate slanders, will do nothing more than bring down on
themselves more dreadful condemnation.

<span id="xii.x-p13"></span><span id="xii.x-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p14"></span>**61.** *But Jesus knowing.* Christ knew
indeed, that the offense which the reprobate had taken up could not be
removed; for, to tell the truth,  <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) the doctrine does not so much wound
them as it exposes the putrid ulcer which they inwardly nourished in
their hearts. But he wished by all methods to try if there were not one
of those who were offended that was not yet beyond the reach of cure,
and to stop the mouths of the rest. By putting the question, he means
that they have no reason to be offended,  <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) or, at least, that the ground of
offense does not lie in the doctrine itself. Thus we ought to repress
the wickedness of those who, urged on by nothing but the rage of mastiff
dogs, slander the word of God; and thus too we ought to chastise the
folly of those who inconsiderately attack the truth.

<span id="xii.x-p17"></span>*Knowing in himself.* He says that Jesus
*knew in himself*, because they had not yet declared openly what gave
them uneasiness, but secretly murmured and groaned within themselves,
and, therefore, he anticipates their open complaints. If it be objected,
that the nature of those complaints was not difficult to understand,
because in express terms they rejected the doctrine of Christ, I
acknowledge that the words which John has formerly related are plain
enough; but still I say that, like persons who are disgusted at any
thing, they whispered those words to each other in low murmurs. For if
they had spoken to Christ, there would have been better ground of hope,
because the way would have been opened up for teaching them; but now,
when they indulge in secret murmurings, they shut up against themselves
the way to gain instruction. So then, when we do not immediately
perceive the Lord’s meaning, there is nothing better than to go straight
to him, that he may solve all our difficulties.

<span id="xii.x-p18"></span>*Doth this offend you?* Christ appears here
to increase the offense instead of removing it; but if any person
examine very closely the ground of offense, there was in the following
statement what ought to have pacified their minds.

<span id="xii.x-p19"></span><span id="xii.x-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p20"></span>**62.** *What if you shall see the Son of
man ascend to where he was before?* The mean and despicable condition of
Christ which they saw before their eyes, while, clothed with flesh, he
was not at all different from other men, prevented them from submitting
to his Divine power; but now — by withdrawing, as it were, the veil — he
calls them to behold his heavenly glory, as if he had said, “Because I
converse among men without honor, I am despised by you, and you
recognize in me nothing that is Divine; but ere long God will adorn me
with splendid power, and, withdrawing me from the contemptible state of
mortal life, will raise me above the heavens.” For, in the resurrection
of Christ, so great was the power displayed by the Holy Spirit, that it
plainly showed Christ to be the Son of God, as Paul also shows, (<span
id="xii.x-p20.1"></span>[Ro 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004.md)<span
id="xii.x-p20.1"></span>.) And when it is said,

<span id="xii.x-p21"></span>Thou art my Son, today have I begotten
thee,  
(<span id="xii.x-p21.2"></span>[Ps
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007)<span id="xii.x-p21.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="xii.x-p22"></span>the resurrection is brought forward as a
proof from which that glory of Christ ought to be acknowledged, and his
*ascension* to heaven was the completion of that glory. When he says
that *he was formerly in heaven*, this does not apply strictly to his
human nature, and yet he speaks of *the Son of man;* but since the two
natures in Christ constitute one person, it is not an unusual way of
speaking to transfer to one nature what is peculiar to the other.

<span id="xii.x-p23"></span><span id="xii.x-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p24"></span>**63.** *It is the Spirit that quickeneth.*
By these words Christ shows the reason why the Jews did not profit by
his doctrine to be, that, being spiritual and *quickening*, it does not
find ears well prepared. But as this passage has been variously
expounded, it will be of importance first to ascertain the natural
meaning of the words; from which it will be easy to perceive Christ’s
intention. When he affirms that *the flesh profiteth nothing,*
Chrysostom improperly, in my opinion, refers it to the Jews, who were
*carnal* I readily acknowledge that in heavenly mysteries the whole
power of the human mind is utterly unavailing; but the words of Christ
do not bear that meaning, if they be not violently tortured. Equally
forced would be that opinion, as applied to the apposite clause; namely,
it is the illumination of *the Spirit that quickeneth.* Nor do I approve
of the views of those who say, that *the flesh of Christ profiteth*, so
far as he was crucified, but that, when it is eaten, it is of no
advantage to us; for, on the contrary, we must eat it, that, having been
crucified, it may *profit*

<span id="xii.x-p25"></span>Augustine thinks that we ought to supply the
word *only*, or *by itself*, as if it had been said, “*The flesh* alone,
and by itself, *profiteth not*,”  <span
id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) because it must be accompanied by *the
Spirit* This meaning accords well with the scope of the discourse, for
Christ refers simply to the manner of eating. He does not, therefore,
exclude every kind of usefulness, as if none could be obtained from his
*flesh;* but he declares that, if it be separated from *the Spirit,* it
will then be useless. For whence has *the flesh* power to *quicken*, but
because it is spiritual? Accordingly, whoever confines his whole
attention to the earthly nature of *the flesh,* will find in it nothing
but what is dead; but they who shall raise their eyes to the power of
*the Spirit,* which is diffused over the flesh, will learn from the
actual effect and from the experience of faith, that it is not without
reason that it is called *quickening*

<span id="xii.x-p27"></span>We now understand in what manner *the flesh
is truly food*, and yet *it profiteth not* It *is food*, because by it
life is procured for us, because in it God is reconciled to us, because
in it we have all the parts of salvation accomplished. It *profiteth
not*, if it be estimated by its origin and nature; for the seed of
Abraham, which is in itself subject to death, does not bestow life, but
receives from *the Spirit* its power to feed us; and, therefore, on our
part also, that we may be truly nourished by it, we must bring the
spiritual mouth of faith.

<span id="xii.x-p28"></span>As to the sentence breaking off in so abrupt
a manner, it is probable that this was done because Christ saw that it
was necessary to act in this manner towards unbelievers. By this clause,
therefore, he suddenly closed the sermon, because they did not deserve
that he should speak to them any longer. Yet he did not overlook those
who are godly and teachable; for they have here, in a few words, what
may abundantly satisfy them.

<span id="xii.x-p29"></span>*The words which I speak to you.* This is an
allusion to the preceding statement, for he now employs the word
*Spirit* in a different sense. But as he had spoken of the secret power
of *the Spirit*, he elegantly applies this to his doctrine, because it
is spiritual; for the word *Spirit* must be explained to mean
*spiritual* Now the word is called *spiritual*, because it calls us
upwards to seek Christ in his heavenly glory, through the guidance of
the Spirit, by faith, and not by our carnal perception; for we know that
of all that was said, nothing can be comprehended but by faith. And it
is also worthy of observation, that he connects *life* with *the Spirit*
He calls his word *life,* from its effect, as if he had called it
quickening; but shows that it will not be *quickening* to any but those
who receive it *spiritually*, for others will rather draw death from it.
To the godly, this commendation bestowed on the Gospel is most
delightful, because they are certain that it is appointed for their
eternal salvation; but at the same time, they are reminded to labor to
prove that they are genuine disciples.

<span id="xii.x-p30"></span><span id="xii.x-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p31"></span>**64.** *But there are some of you who do
not believe.* He again imputes blame to them, because, being destitute
of *the Spirit,* they wickedly corrupt and debase his doctrine, and thus
turn it to their ruin. For otherwise they might have objected: “You
boast, indeed, that what you speak is quickening, but we experience
nothing of that nature.” He therefore says, that by themselves it is
prevented; for unbelief, as it is always proud, will never understand
any thing in the words of Christ which it despises and disdains.
Wherefore, if we wish to profit at all under this Teacher, let us bring
minds well disposed to listen to him; for if the entrance to his
doctrine be not opened up by humility and reverence, our understandings
are harder than stones, and will not receive any part of sound doctrine.
And therefore, when in the present day we see so few people in the world
profiting by the Gospel, we ought to remember that this arises from the
depravity of men. For how many will you find who deny themselves, and
truly submit to Christ? As to his saying only that there were some *who
did not believe*, though almost all of them were liable to this charge,
his reason for doing so appears to have been that, if there were any who
were not yet beyond the possibility of cure, they might not cast down
their minds in despair.

<span id="xii.x-p32"></span>*For Jesus knew from the beginning.* The
Evangelist added this, that none might think that Christ formed an
opinion at random about his hearers. Many professed to belong to his
flock, but a sudden apostacy exposed their hypocrisy. But the Evangelist
says that their treachery, even while it was unknown to others, was well
known to Christ. And this is stated, not so much on his account, as that
we may learn not to form a judgment except on subjects which we have
thoroughly investigated; for as to their being known to Christ from the
beginning, this was peculiar to his Divinity. It is otherwise with us;
for since we do not know the hearts, we ought to delay forming a
judgment, until impiety be manifested by outward signs, and thus *the
tree be known by its fruits*, (<span id="xii.x-p32.1"></span>[Mt
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016)<span id="xii.x-p32.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xii.xi-p2"></span>**65.** And he said, Therefore have I told
you that no man can come to me, unless it be given to him by my Father.
**66.** From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no
more with him. **67.** Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Do you also
wish to go away? **68.** Simon Peter therefore answered him, Lord, to
whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. **69.** And we
have believed and known that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God. **70.** Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one
of you is a devil? **71.** Now he spoke of Judas Iscariot, son of Simon;
for it was he that would betray him, although he was one of the twelve.

<span id="xii.xi-p3"></span> 

<span id="xii.xi-p4"></span><span id="xii.xi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xi-p5"></span>**65.** *Therefore have I told you.* He
again states that faith is an uncommon and remarkable gift of the Spirit
of God, that we may not be astonished that the Gospel is not received in
every place and by all. For, being ill qualified to turn to our
advantage the course of events, we think more meanly of the Gospel,
because the whole world does not assent to it. The thought arises in our
mind, How is it possible that the greater part of men shall deliberately
reject their salvation? Christ therefore assigns a reason why there are
so few believers, namely, because no man, whatever may be his acuteness,
 <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) can arrive at faith by his own
sagacity; for all are blind, until they are illuminated by the Spirit of
God, and therefore they only partake of so great a blessing whom the
Father deigns to make partakers of it. If this grace were bestowed on
all without exception, it would have been unseasonable and inappropriate
to have mentioned it in this passage; for we must understand that it was
Christ’s design to show that not many believe the Gospel, because faith
proceeds only from the secret revelation of the Spirit.

<span id="xii.xi-p7"></span>*Unless it be given him by my Father.* He
now uses the word *give* instead of the word which he formerly used,
*draw*; by which he means that there is no other reason why God *draws*,
than because out of free grace he loves us; for what we obtain by the
gift and grace of God, no man procures for himself by his own industry.

<span id="xii.xi-p8"></span><span id="xii.xi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xi-p9"></span>**66.** *From that time many of his
disciples went back.* The Evangelist now relates what trouble was the
consequence of that sermon. It is a dreadful and monstrous thing, that
so kind and gracious an invitation of Christ could have alienated the
minds of many, and especially of those who had formerly professed to
belong to him, and were even his ordinary *disciples.* But this example
is held out to us for a mirror, as it were, in which we may perceive how
great is the wickedness and ingratitude of men, who turn a plain road
into an occasion of stumbling to them, that they may not come to Christ.
Many would say that it would have been better that a sermon of this kind
should never have been preached, which occasioned the apostacy of many.
But we ought to entertain a widely different view; for it was then
necessary, and now is daily necessary, that what had been foretold
concerning Christ should be perceived in his doctrine, namely, that

<span id="xii.xi-p10"></span>he is the stone of stumbling, (<span
id="xii.xi-p10.1"></span>[Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014)<span id="xii.xi-p10.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xii.xi-p11"></span>We ought, indeed, to regulate our doctrine
in such a manner that none may be offended through our fault; as far as
possible, we ought to retain all; and, in short, we ought to take care
that we do not, by talking inconsiderately or at random,  <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) disturb ignorant or weak minds. But it
will never be possible for us to exercise such caution that the doctrine
of Christ shall not be the occasion of offense to many; because the
reprobate, who are devoted to destruction, suck venom from the most
wholesome food, and gall from honey. The Son of God undoubtedly knew
well what was useful, and yet we see that he cannot avoid  <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) offending *many of his disciples.*
Whatever then may be the dislike entertained by many persons for pure
doctrine, still we are not at liberty to suppress it. Only let the
teachers of the Church remember the advice given by Paul, that *the word
of God* ought to be *properly divided*, (<span
id="xii.xi-p13.2"></span>[2Ti
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#015)<span id="xii.xi-p13.2"></span>;.md)
and next let them advance boldly amidst all offenses. And if it happen
that many apostatize, let us not be disgusted at the word of God,
because it is not relished by the reprobate; for they who are so much
shaken by the revolt of some that, when those persons fall away, they
are immediately discouraged, are too delicate and tender.

<span id="xii.xi-p14"></span>*And walked no more with him.* When the
Evangelist adds these words, he means that it was not a complete
apostacy, but only that they withdrew from familiar intercourse with
Christ; and yet he condemns them as apostates. Hence we ought to learn
that we cannot go back a foot breadth, without being immediately in
danger of falling into treacherous denial of our Master.

<span id="xii.xi-p15"></span><span id="xii.xi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xi-p16"></span>**67.** *Jesus therefore said to the
twelve.* As the faith of the apostles might be greatly shaken, when they
saw that they were so small a remnant of a great multitude, Christ
directs his discourse to them, and shows that there is no reason why
they should allow themselves to be hurried away by the lightness and
unsteadiness of others. When he asks them if *they also wish to go
away,* he does so in order to confirm their faith; for, by exhibiting to
them himself, that they may remain with him, he likewise exhorts them
not to become the companions of apostates. And, indeed, if faith be
founded on Christ, it will not depend on men, and will never waver,
though it should see heaven and earth mingling. We ought also to observe
this circumstance, that Christ, when deprived of nearly all his
disciples, retains *the twelve* only, in like manner as Isaiah was
formerly commanded to

<span id="xii.xi-p17"></span>bind the testimony and seal the law among
the disciples,  
(<span id="xii.xi-p17.2"></span>[Isa
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016)<span id="xii.xi-p17.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xii.xi-p18"></span>By such examples, every one of the
believers is taught to follow God, even though he should have no
companion.

<span id="xii.xi-p19"></span><span id="xii.xi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xi-p20"></span>**68.** *Simon Peter therefore answered
him. Peter* replies here in the name of all, as he does on other
occasions; because all of them were of the same mind, except that in
Judas there was no sincerity. This reply contains two clauses; for
*Peter* first states the reason why he cheerfully adheres to Christ,
along with his brethren; namely, because they feel that his doctrine is
wholesome and quickening; and, secondly, he acknowledges that *to
whomsoever they might go,* if they left Christ, there remained for them
nothing but death.

<span id="xii.xi-p21"></span>*Thou hast the words of eternal life.* When
he says *the words of life*, by the phrase *of life*, he means
*quickening*, using the genitive case instead of the adjective, which is
a very common mode of expression among the Hebrews. It is a remarkable
commendation bestowed on the Gospel, that it administers to us *eternal
life*, as Paul testifies, that

<span id="xii.xi-p22"></span>it is the power of God for salvation to
every one who believeth,  
(<span id="xii.xi-p22.2"></span>[Ro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)<span id="xii.xi-p22.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xii.xi-p23"></span>True, the Law also contains *life*, but
because it denounces against all transgressors  <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) the condemnation of eternal death, it
can do nothing but kill. Widely different is the manner in which life is
offered to us in the Gospel, that is, when *God reconciles us to
himself* through free grace, *by not imputing our sins*, (<span
id="xii.xi-p24.2"></span>[2Co
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)<span id="xii.xi-p24.2"></span>..md)
It is no ordinary assertion that Peter makes concerning Christ, when he
says that he has *the words of eternal life;* but he ascribes this to
Christ as belonging to him alone. Hence follows the second statement
which I glanced at a little ago, that as soon as they have gone away
from Christ, there remains for them everywhere nothing but death.
Certain destruction, therefore, awaits all who, not satisfied with that
Teacher, fly to the inventions of men.

<span id="xii.xi-p25"></span><span id="xii.xi-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xi-p26"></span>**69.** *And we have believed and known.*
The verbs are in the past tense, but they may be changed into the
present tense, *we believe and know*, but it makes little difference in
the meaning. In these words Peter gives a brief summary of faith. But
the confession appears to have nothing to do with the matter in hand,
for the question had been raised about *eating the flesh of Christ*. I
reply, although *the twelve* did not at once comprehend all that Christ
had taught, yet it is enough that, according to the capacity of their
faith, they acknowledge him to be the Author of salvation, and submit
themselves to him in all things. The word *believe* is put first,
because the obedience of faith is the commencement of right
understanding, or rather, because faith itself is truly the eye of the
understanding. But immediately afterwards knowledge is added, which
distinguishes faith from erroneous and false opinions; for Mahometans
and Jews and Papists *believe*, but they neither *know* nor understand
any thing. Knowledge is connected with faith, because we are certain and
fully convinced of the truth of God, not in the same manner as human
sciences are learned, but when the Spirit seals it on our hearts.

<span id="xii.xi-p27"></span><span id="xii.xi-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xi-p28"></span>**70.** *Jesus answered them.* Since Christ
replies to all, we infer from it that all spake by the mouth of Peter.
Besides, Christ now prepares and fortifies the eleven apostles against a
new offense which was already at hand. It was a powerful instrument of
Satan for shaking their faith, when they were reduced to so small a
number, but the fall of Judas might take away all their courage; for
since Christ had chosen that sacred number, who would ever have thought
that any portion of the whole number could be torn away? That admonition
of Christ may be interpreted thus: “You twelve alone remain out of a
large company. If your faith has not been shaken by the unbelief of
many, prepare for a new contest; for this company, though small, will be
still diminished by one man.”

<span id="xii.xi-p29"></span>*Have not I chosen you twelve?* When Christ
says that he has chosen or elected *twelve*, he does not refer to the
eternal purpose of God; for it is impossible that any one of those who
have been predestinated to life shall fall away; but, having been
*chosen* to the apostolic office, they ought to have surpassed others in
piety and holiness. He used the word *chosen,* therefore, to denote
those who were eminent and distinguished from the ordinary rank.

<span id="xii.xi-p30"></span>*And one of you is a devil.* He
unquestionably intended, by this name, to hold up Judas to the utmost
detestation; for they are mistaken who extenuate the atrocity implied in
the name and indeed we cannot sufficiently execrate those who dishonor
so sacred an office. Teachers who faithfully discharge their office are
called *angels*

<span id="xii.xi-p31"></span>They should seek the law at his mouth, for
he is the angel of the Lord of Hosts,  
(<span id="xii.xi-p31.2"></span>[Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007)<span id="xii.xi-p31.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xii.xi-p32"></span>Justly, therefore, is he accounted *a
devil,* who, after having been admitted to so honorable a rank, is
corrupted through his treachery and wickedness. Another reason is, that
God allows more power and liberty to Satan over wicked and ungodly
ministers, than over other ordinary men; and therefore, if they who were
*chosen* to be pastors are driven by diabolical rage, so as to resemble
wild and monstrous beasts, so far are we from being entitled, on that
account, to despise the honorable rank to which they belong, that we
ought rather to honor it the more, when the profanation of it is
followed by so fearful a punishment.

<span id="xii.xi-p33"></span><span id="xii.xi-p33.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xi-p34"></span>**71.** *He spoke of Judas* Although Judas
had a bad conscience, still we do not read that he was at all moved.
Hypocrites are so stupid that they do not feel their sores, and in the
presence of men they have such hardened effrontery, that they do not
scruple to prefer themselves to the very best of men.

through so many changes, that all reasoning about them must be involved
in uncertainty; but, so far as we have been able to ascertain, the value
of a *carolus* of Tours, in Calvin’s time, was nearly that of a penny
sterling, and the *denier* was the tenth part of it, or nearly a modern
*centime* of Paris. “Four times the *carolus*, with two *deniers*,”
would thus be 4 and 1/5 pence sterling, and, multiplying that by 200, we
have *three pounds*, *ten shillings*. Again, taking *the franc* (as
Cotgrave rates it) at *two shillings*, 35 francs are also equal to
*three pounds*, *ten shillings*. This is, at least, a curious
coincidence, and the reader may compare it with a computation made from
the *livre Parisis*, (*Harmony*, volume 2, page 234, n. 2.) It would
appear, however, that Budaeus and Calvin had estimated the *denarius* at
little more than half its real value, which was *sevenpence halfpenny*
sterling, taking silver at five shillings per ounce; so that *two
hundred denarii* would be equal to *six pounds*, *five shillings
sterling*. — *Ed*.
