<span id="ix.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 37

<span id="ix.ii"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p1"></span><span id="ix.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
37:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p2"></span>**1**. And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah
reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king
of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.

<span id="ix.ii-p3"></span>**1**. Et regnavit rex Zedechias, filius
Josiae, pro Choniah (Jechania) filio Joiakim, quem constituit regem
Nebuchadnezer, rex Babylonis, in terra Jehudah:

<span id="ix.ii-p4"></span>**2**. But neither he, nor his servants, nor
the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he
spake by the prophet Jeremiah.

<span id="ix.ii-p5"></span>**2**. Et non audivit, neque servi ejus,
neque populus terrae sermones Jehovae, quos loquutus est per manum
Jeremiae Prophetae.

<span id="ix.ii-p6"></span> 

<span id="ix.ii-p7"></span><span id="ix.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p8"></span>The Prophet tells us here, that after
Jeconiah the king had been led into exile, the Jews had not on that
account repented, though God had as it were forced them to return to
him; for it was so severe a chastisement, that to become worse was an
evidence of monstrous stupidity. Jeremiah, however, says that they were
not reformed by that punishment; for Zedekiah, who had succeeded
Jeconiah, rejected sound doctrine, and did not obey the counsel of the
Prophet.

<span id="ix.ii-p9"></span>But we must bear in mind the history of that
time, that we may understand the meaning of the Prophet: the Jews made
Jeconiah king in the place of his father, but in the third month the
army of the king of Babylon came. Then Jeconiah surrendered himself to
them of his own accord. Now the Prophet had said, that there would be no
legitimate successor to Jehoiakim; and this was fulfilled, though his
son was set on the throne, for a three months’ reign was so unimportant
that it was deemed as nothing. And when Nebuchadnezzar saw that the
people could hardly be kept in order without a king, he made Mattaniah
king, whom he called Zedekiah. And he immediately revolted to the
Egyptians and made a treaty with them, in order that he might shake off
the yoke of the king of Babylon. Hence the Prophet says, that though
Zedekiah had been taught by the example of Jehoiakim and of his nephew
Jeconiah, he yet became nothing the better, he does not shnply blame his
ingratitude: it is indeed certain that he had been severely reproved by
the Prophet for having acted perfidiously towards the King
Nebuchadnezzar, for he ought to have kept faith with him to the last. He
feigned a reason of his own for revolting from him; no new cause had
occurred; but it was only that he might be exempt from tribute, and also
lest the malevolent should object to him that he reigned by permission,
and that. he was the slave of another king. As, then, he saw that his
reign would be exposed to many reproaches, except he revolted from the
king of Babylon, he made a treaty with the Egyptians. This deserved
reproof: but the Prophet speaks here generally of his obstinate
wickedness, and also of that of the whole people.

<span id="ix.ii-p10"></span>*King Zedekiah,* he says, *the son of
Josiah, reigned instead of Coniah* Here the word, Jeconiah, is
curtailed, as it is probable, for the sake of degrading him; and we have
seen that this has been the common opinion. He is then called Coniah by
way of reproach, when yet his full name was Jeconiah. He says that
Zedekiah was *made king by Nebuchadnezzar:* hence his perfidy and
ingratitude became manifest. It is added, that he *hearkened not to the
word of Jehovah, nor his servants, nor his people* I have said that
Zedekiah was condemned, not simply because he obeyed not the Prophet by
keeping faith with the King Nebuchadnezzar, but also because he retained
the superstitions of his fathers, and corrupted the true worship of God,
and would not be called back to the doctrine of the Law.

<span id="ix.ii-p11"></span>The disobedience then, mentioned here,
extended to the whole Law of God, or to the two tables; for the Jews had
then become degenerate together with their king; they did not purely
worship God, but polluted themselves and the Temple by impious and
filthy superstitious, and they were also libidinous, avaricious, cruel,
violent, and dishonest, and had thus cast off the whole teaching of the
Law. And this was a proof of strange blindness, as they had before their
eyes the calamities of the city and the reproach to which their king had
been subjected; for as we have already said, his sons had been slain in
his presence, his own eyes had been pulled out, and he was bound with
chains, after having been judged guilty of a capital offense. Such an
example ought surely to have terrified Zedekiah and all the rest, so as
to make thenl at length wise, and to seek reconciliation with God. But
the Prophet says, that they *did not hearken to the word of Jehovah*

<span id="ix.ii-p12"></span>He mentions the king, then his counsellors,
and in the third place, the whole people; as though he had said, that
this madness was found not only in the king, but also in his counsellors
and in the whole community, so that no one was excusable. He then begins
with the head, even the king himself, and shews also that his
counsellots were nothing better, and afterwards adds the common people,
in whom the fault seems to have been less; for we know that the lower
orders go astray through want of wisdom and ignorance. But the Prophet
here shews that even the lowest of the people were disobedient to God.

<span id="ix.ii-p13"></span>We ought to notice especially the words,
that they *hearkened not to the word of Jehovah which he had spoken by
Jeremiah* For he intimates, that though God did not appear from heaven,
it was sufficient to condemn the unbelieving, that he spoke by his
Prophets. There was, then, no reason why the wicked should make evasions
and say, that it was not their purpose to reject God and his doctrine,
but that they only refused deference to mortals, and would not regard
the words of men as heavenly oracles. This evasion availed them nothing,
for God would have them to hearken to his servants. Though he did not
shew himself from heaven, nor addressed them in a visible form, it was
yet enough that he had once for all testified, that after the
promulgation of the Law, there would always be Prophets among the
people, and had commanded them to be reverently attended to. Nor could
the Jews avail themselves of that evasion, which the ungodly commonly
resorted to, that they could not distinguish between true and false
Prophets; for if they had examined the doctrine of Jeremiah, they would
have found that it had certain marks by which they could have easily
seen that it was altogether consistent with the Law. That they then
rejected the Prophet and his heavenly doctrine, was a proof of their
obstinacy and contempt, but not through ignorance. It follows, —

<span id="ix.iii"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p1"></span><span id="ix.iii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
37:3-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#003.md)<span id="ix.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p2"></span>**3**. And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal
the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, to
the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.

<span id="ix.iii-p3"></span>**3**. Et misit rex Zedechias Jucal filium
Selemiae, et Zephaniam filium Maassiae sacerdotem (vel, sacerdotis) ad
Jeremiam Prophetam, dicendo, Ora agedum pro nobis Jehovam Deum nostrum.

<span id="ix.iii-p4"></span>**4**. Now Jeremiah came in and went out
among the people: for they had not put him into prison.

<span id="ix.iii-p5"></span>**4**. Et Jeremias (autem) ibat et
egrediebatur in medio populi; necdum posuerant eum in domum clausurae
(vel, carceris)

<span id="ix.iii-p6"></span>**5**. Then Pharaoh’s army was come forth
out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard
tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.

<span id="ix.iii-p7"></span>**5**. Et exercitus Pharaonis egressus erat
ex Egypto, et audierant Chaldmi qui oppugnabant Jerusalem famam de
illis, et ascenderant a Jerusalem.

<span id="ix.iii-p8"></span>**6**. Then came the word of the LORD unto
the prophet Jeremiah, saying,

<span id="ix.iii-p9"></span>**6**. Et fuit sermo Jehovae ad Jeremiam
Prophetam, dicendo,

<span id="ix.iii-p10"></span>**7**. Thus saith the LORD, the God of
Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to
enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you,
shall return to Egypt into their own land.

<span id="ix.iii-p11"></span>**7**. Sic dicit Jehova, Deus Israel, Ita
dicetis regi Jehudab, qui misit vos ad me ut me interrogaretis, Ecce
exercitus Pharaonis, qui egressus est vobis in auxilium, reversus est
(revertatur, potius) in terram Egypti;

<span id="ix.iii-p12"></span>**8**. And the Chaldeans shall come again,
and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.

<span id="ix.iii-p13"></span>**8**. Et redibunt Chaldaei et oppugnabunt
hanc urbem (proeliabuntur contra urbem hanc) et capient eam et comburent
eam igni.

<span id="ix.iii-p14"></span> 

<span id="ix.iii-p15"></span><span id="ix.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p16"></span>Jeremiah had briefly explained what was the
state of the city and the land, that though they had been already
severely chastised by God’s scourges, they yet remained obstinate in
their wickedness. He now adds, that messengers were *sent* to him by
*King Zedekiah,* when danger arose from the Chaldeans; and it is
probable that this message came to Jeremiah when the siege was raised,
or if the siege still continued, it was at a time when the Jews, no
doubt, flattered themselves with the hope of receiving some aid, while
yet they saw that the power of the king of Babylon was very great. For
though they hoped for some help from the Egyptians, they were yet
perplexed, and fear constrained the king to send messengers to the
Prophet Jeremiah. But it appears from the answer that the Egyptians were
already in arms, and had also come out for the purpose of raising the
siege, and driving the Chaldeans from Judea. We hence see that the king
was, in a measure, elated with vain confidence, seeing that the
Egyptians were coming with a strong army to assist him, and yet he was
full of anxiety, as the ungodly must ever be: while they seek to confirm
themselves in a state of security, they are still tossed here and there,
for God’s judgment is upon them. They are fearful, though they try to
shake off fear. Hence Zedekiah, though he thought that he should soon be
freed from all danger, yet could not wholly divest himself of anxiety,
and therefore sent to Jeremiah: for the ungodly are wont to seek God,
but not in earnest; they wish to discharge the outward duty, but they
bring neither faith nor repentance, by which alone access to God is
opened.

<span id="ix.iii-p17"></span><span id="ix.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p18"></span>But Jeremiah tells us that he was then at
liberty, coming in and going out *among the people* It may be that he
had been in prison, but that after the rage of the king and of the
people had cooled, he might have been set free. It is hence said that he
was among the people, that is set at liberty, and at his own disposal,
so that he could safely walk through the city; for to come and to go
implies that he was free to follow his own business. He is said to come
and to go who undertakes this or that concern as he pleases; for men, we
know, are not engaged always in the same thing, but do various things as
necessity requires. Such, then, was the condition of Jeremiah; he
enjoyed common liberty. It is then added, that he *was not as yet cast
into prison,* as it happened soon after. It is further said, that the
*army of Pharaoh was come out from Egypt to* give aid to the Jews, and
that thus the siege was raised, for the Chaldeans went forth to meet the
Egyptians. At this time, then, Jeremiah received an answer from God. It
seems not, therefore, probable that the messengers were sent, when the
report spread through the city of the coming of the enemy, but rather
when the city was relieved, for the condition of the people was still
doubtful, as the liberty of the city and the land depended on the
uncertain issue of the war. The Chaldeans had not yet come unto an
engagement with the Egyptians. A victory gained by Pharaoh would have
given the prospect of peace and safety to Zedekiah and the whole people;
but if the Chaldeans gained the day, they saw that the greatest danger
was at hand, for they would then be deprived of every assistance.

<span id="ix.iii-p19"></span>It was in this state of things that
Zedekiah sent messengers to Jeremiah, to solicit his prayers. Thus we
see that hypocrites are driven by the fear of God, whom yet they proudly
despise, to seek his aid when forced to do so; nor is this done, that
they may appear to do so before men, but because God brings them to such
straits, that they cannot but feel that they stand in need of his help.
They wish, indeed, as I have said, to obliterate every recollection of
God, and were they also able to do so, they would rob him of all power
and authority; but as they are forced, willing or unwilling, to know
that God so reigns in heaven that the whole world is subject to his
power, necessity constrains them formally to pray, and, in a manner, to
conciliate his favor, or, at least, to try to do so. But as I have
already said, they ought to begin with repentance and faith. Hypocrites
withdraw themselves as far as they can, both from the promises of God
and from the duty of repentance. They so seek God that they at the same
time shun him.

<span id="ix.iii-p20"></span>We must also observe, that Zedekiah felt
himself so guilty, that he could not pray himself. As, then, he was
conscious of his own unworthiness, he put the Prophet, as it were,
between himself and God, that he might suppliantly intercede for him.
This also is what the faithful often do, for they seek aid here and
there that they may be more readily heard by God; and this they do
according to God’s command. But there is a great difference between the
godly and hypocrites. The true worshippers of God, as I have said, are
not content with their own prayers, but ask others to join them, while,
at the same time, they pray God themselves. But hypocrites, what do they
do? As they think that an access is forbidden them, and know that they
are unworthy of being heard by God, they substitute others in their
place to pray for them. Thus they do not seek themselves to know whether
God will be propitious to them; and though they wish the whole world to
pray for them, they do not yet pray themselves. Such, then, was the
sottishhess of Zedekiah, who asked the holy Prophet to pray for him to
God, while he himself was lying torpid in his own dregs; for he did not
acknowledge that he was suffering a just punishment, nor had he recourse
to the true remedy, that is, to return to God’s favor, to embrace his
mercy and the promises of salvation. All these principal things he
omitted, and only attended to what is, as they say, accessory.

<span id="ix.iii-p21"></span>Now as to the time, we ought carefully to
notice that it was when the Egyptians came to raise the siege. Thus God
for a time permitted hypocrites to be deceived by a fortunate event; for
the Jews then began to praise their own prudence in forming a league
with the Egyptians, for that kingdom, as it is well known, was powerful,
and at the same time populous, so that a large army could be raised. As,
then, they saw that their treaty turned out beneficially to them, they,
no doubt, assumed to themselves great credit, and thus their boldness
increased. But God, however, so touched their liearts, that they
continued in suspense, and, by turns, greatly feared: for Zedekiah would
not have sent to Jeremiah, except, constrained by some great necessity;
and yet, as it has been said, success might have inebriated him; but God
rendered him anxious, so as to feel that the prayer of the Prophet was
needed.

<span id="ix.iii-p22"></span><span id="ix.iii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p23"></span>Now follows the answer: Jeremiah says that
the word of Jehovah came to him, and that he was to tell the messengers
of Zedekiah, that the Chaldeans would shortly return. He then says,
*Behold the army of Pharaoh, which has come forth to deliver you, shall
return to their own land;* that is, being compelled to do so, the
Egyptians being either conquered in battle or smitten with fear, and
returning of their own accord to secure themselves in their own cities.
The Prophet says, that no advantage could be expected from the
Egyptians, for the soldiers of Pharaoh would return to their own land;
and then he adds, *and the Chaldeans shall return and fight against this
city, until they take and burn it* This was a hard answer, and Zedekiah
was, no doubt, greatly exasperated at hearing the message, and also very
angry with the Prophet, who thus dared plainly to threaten the city and
the people with final ruin. But here the Prophet disregarded the pride
of the king, for it was necessary for him to obey God’s command, he
therefore boldly performed his office; and, at the same time, he touched
the king Zedekiah to the quick, *say to the king who sent you to inquire
of me*, *etc*

<span id="ix.iii-p24"></span>The word <span id="ix.iii-p24.1"></span>דרש
*daresh,* means indeed to ask in general, but the Prophet means here
that he was to inquire; and yet this was not said before; for he only
told us that messengers had been sent to ask him to pray for the safety
of the king and the people. But Scripture, we know, often omits one of
the two things that are included; and we may easily conclude, that the
king had not only sent to Jeremiah to pray, but also to bring some
favorable prophecy from the Lord. For why did he apply to him rather
than to the chief priest or some others, except that he knew him to be
the true Prophet of God? Then Zedekiah requested Jeremiah to pray, but
he tried also to draw from him some favorable prophecy, by which he
might be relieved. Hence Jeremiah indirectly reproved him, because he
feignedly sent to him as though he was ready to hear whatever God might
declare by the mouth of his servant, — “He sent you to inquire of me; he
is mistaken, for he will not get what he seeks; for thus saith God, ‘The
Egyptians shall avail you nothing, and the Chaldeans shall return and
take and burn the city.’”

<span id="ix.iii-p25"></span>We now perceive that when hypocrites
pretend in a circuitous way to seek God, they do not obtain what they
wish; for God justly disappoints them, inasmuch as they do not come to
him with sincere hearts and desires; for they wish to transform God into
their own nature and character, and they bend not themselves to his
service nor submit to his word. Thus it comes that God will not answer
their prayers; but the faithful, who seek God sincerely and from the
heart, always find him propitious; and though he may not hear them
immediately, yet he really shews that he cares for their safety. But
hypocrites, whose confidence God regards with disdain, deserve that it
should be empty and vain. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet gave
such a severe answer to Zedekiah and his messengers. It now follows, —

<span id="ix.iv"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p1"></span><span id="ix.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
37:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#009.md)<span id="ix.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p2"></span>**9**. Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not
yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they
shall not depart.

<span id="ix.iv-p3"></span>**9**. Sic dicit Jehova, Ne efferatis animas
vestras *(vel, cum puncto diverso,* Ne decipiatis, *quia duoe sunt
lectiones,*\] <span id="ix.iv-p3.1"></span>תשאו *aut*, <span
id="ix.iv-p3.2"></span> תשיאוNe *ergo* efferatis vos, *vel,* Ne
decipiatis animus vestras) dicendo, Proficisicendo proficisicentur
Chaldaei, quia non proficisicentur:

<span id="ix.iv-p4"></span>**10**. For though ye had smitten the whole
army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained *but*
wounded men among them, *yet* should they rise up every man in his tent,
and burn this city with fire.

<span id="ix.iv-p5"></span>**10**. Quia si percusscritis totum exercitum
Chaldaeorum, qui praeliantur vobiscam (vol, qui vos oppugnant) et
residui, fuerint ex illis viri transfixi (hoc est, vulnerati) quisque e
tabernaculo suo consurgent (hoc est, singuli ex tabernacalo suo) et
exurent hanc urbem igni.

<span id="ix.iv-p6"></span> 

<span id="ix.iv-p7"></span><span id="ix.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p8"></span>The Prophet confirms the former verse, and it
was indeed necessary that this should be added, for though Zedekiah
might not have divested himself of all anxiety and fear, he must yet
have been moved by that prophecy, and thus he might have become more
hardened in his obduracy, as it is the case with hypocrites; who, when
they find that they can gain nothing, become furious against God, and
run on headlong in their course. This might then have been the case with
Zedekiah and also the Jews; hence Jeremiah adds, by way of confirmation,
*Elate not your hearts, or,* Deceive not yourselves; that is, on account
of the report respecting the Egyptian army. Thus he told the Jews that
they had no reason to expect any alleviation. And the reason is added,
*For if,* he says, *ye had smitten, the Chaldeans* so that few remained,
*yet they would rise up every one from his tent, and burn this city*

<span id="ix.iv-p9"></span><span id="ix.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p10"></span>The Prophet shews how foolishly and absurdly
the Jews acted, in casting their eyes on fortunate events, and thus
forming their opinions. He therefore exhorts them to cease to rely on
such a confidence as would deceive them; for he says, that though they
gained many battles, and the war turned on their side, yet they could
not escape final ruin, for they had to do with God. It was hence the
same thing, as though he had said, that they were not to judge by their
state at that time, as to what it would be, because God was at war with
them; and therefore if God had resolved to destroy them, though there
were no enemy, yet he could by one breath slay them all. And for the
same reason he concludes that he could employ the Chaldeans, *Though few
in number remained, and even wounded,* yet riley would *rise up from
their tents,* and set the buildings of Jerusalem on fire. This city,
therefore, shall be burnt; ask not by whom or when: God will in this
work employ the Chaldeans, for he hath so determined.

<span id="ix.iv-p11"></span>We may hence conclude, that the Jews had
been for a time victorious, at least had successfully repelled their
enemies in their attacks on the city; for the Prophet would not have
said this, had he not seen that the Jews entertained hope of deliverance
on account of some success they had in the war. He therefore says, that
all this was of no importance, for their city was to perish by fire. But
the principle which I have mentioned must be borne in mind, for Jeremiah
took it as granted that the destruction of the city Jerusalem was not to
be effected by the forces of the King Nebuchadnezzar, neither by the
power or number of his army, nor by the valor of his soldiers, but by
the judgment of God. Since it is so, he says, *though few remained, and
they wounded,* even lying as half dead, *yet they will rise up every one
from his tent,* that is, not together, nor in a regular order, nor under
a banner, as soldiers are wont to do, but each one, though no comrade
were near, though scattered here and there, would yet rise up from his
tent. He intimates, in short, that though the contest were only with
shadows, they yet could not escape that extreme vengeance which God had
threatened. Hence he says, *they shall rise up every one from his tent,
and burn this city*

<span id="ix.iv-p12"></span>Now he says not that the Chaldeans would
take possession of the city, he speaks not of the assault, but only of
the burning, he hence intimates, that though the Chaldeans might have in
themselves no power to hurt them, yet it was sufficient that they were
armed by God, for the purpose of setting fire to the houses, like women
and children, who often burn whole cities and villages; for in this case
there is no need of valor or of any great skill. So then God declares,
that though the Chaldeans might not be prepared to fight, yet they were
strong enough, yea, even though they were lying down and half-dead after
having been wounded. This is the meaning.

<span id="ix.v"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="ix.v-p2"></span>Grant, omnipotent God, that as thou hast been
pleased kindly to invite us to thyself, and settest before us the
reconciliation which is through thine only-begotten Son, — O grant, that
we may not proceed in our wickedness so as to provoke thee more and more
against us, and to kindle the fire of thy vengeance on our own heads,
but that we may so suhmit ourselves to thee, as to flee in sincere
repentance and true faith to thy mercy, that we may find thee to be
propitious to us, and that thou mayest thus afford us reason to give
glory to thy name, having shewn mercy to us, through the same, thine
only-begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="ix.vii"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p1"></span><span id="ix.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
37:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#011.md)<span id="ix.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p2"></span>**11**. And it came to pass, that when the
army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s
army,

<span id="ix.vii-p3"></span>**11**. Et aceidit postquam ascenderat
exercitus Chaeldmorum ab Jerosolyma propter exercitum Pharaonis;

<span id="ix.vii-p4"></span>**12**. Then Jeremiah went forth out of
Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in
the midst of the people.

<span id="ix.vii-p5"></span>**12**. Tunc egressus est Jeremias
Jerosolyma, ut proficisceretur in terram Benjamin, ut divideret illinc
in medio populi.

<span id="ix.vii-p6"></span>**13**. And when he was in the gate of
Benjamin, a captain of the ward *was* there, whose name *was* Irijah,
the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the
prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.

<span id="ix.vii-p7"></span>**13**. Quum esset in porta Benjamin, illic
erat magister custodiae, cujus nomen liria, filius Selemiae, filii
Chananiae, qui apprehendit Jeremiam Prophetam, dicendo, Ad Chaldaeos tu
cadis *(aut,* dilaberis, *hoc enim* significat verbum לפנ)

<span id="ix.vii-p8"></span>**14**. Then said Jeremiah, *It is* false; I
fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah
took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.

<span id="ix.vii-p9"></span>**14**. Et dixit Jeremias, Mendacium, non
dilabor ad Chaldaeos; sed non audivit eum, et apprehendit Iiria
Jeremiam, et deduxit eum ad principes.

<span id="ix.vii-p10"></span> 

<span id="ix.vii-p11"></span><span id="ix.vii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p12"></span>Here Jeremiah tells us how, and on what
occaision, he was cast into prison. He had said shortly before, that he
was in the middle of the people, or among them; but now he gives an
account of the cruelty of the princes, that they not only cast him into
prison, but even into a grave, for they put him, as we shall see, in a
dungeon, so that it was a miracle that he did not die there; and this
was not done only once; but we shall hereafter see, before the end of
the chapter, that he was unhumanly treated, so that he was afraid to
return to the same place, lest it should prove fatal to him. He mentions
the time when this was done, that is, when the Chaldean army went forth
to meet the Egyptians. He was then free to leave the city: no one before
could have gone out, because the gates were closed, and the city was
also surrounded by enemies. It was then, he says, that he went out, that
he might go to *the land of Benjamin,* where, as it has elsewhere
appeared, he was born.

<span id="ix.vii-p13"></span><span id="ix.vii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p14"></span>But he then adds, that he was intercepted
by the *prefect of the ward in the gate of Benjamin* That gate had its
name from its situation, for a part of Jerusalem belonged to the tribe
of Benjamin; and hence it was not strange that the gate which led to the
heritage of the tribe of Benjamin was so called. There then was Jeremiah
intercepted by Irijah, the prefect of the ward, and not without a
grievous charge, that he was escaping to the Chaldeans. The Prophet
attempted to clear himself, but with no effect; for an opinion had
prevailed, that he was already in league with the enemies. He thus
gained nothing by defending himself, but was taken to the princes, the
king’s counsellors.

<span id="ix.vii-p15"></span>This passage teaches us that God’s servants
cannot escape without being exposed to many calumnies and false
suspicions. Jeremiah might at the beginning have evaded this, and
according to the perception of the flesh, his exemption or immunity
might have been viewed as lawful, for there was now before his eyes the
danger, not only of losing his life, but also of his name and
reputation, which, to ingenuous and wise men, is of much more value. Had
Jeremiah then chosen to evade, he might have made this pretense, — “I am
indeed ready to offer my life as a sacrifice a hundred times, but what
will it avail me, if I am to be regarded as a revolter?” For he must
have thus exposed the very name of God to many blasphemies: they might
have said,” This is the Prophet who boasted that he had been sent from
above, but he is now become perfidious and a traitor to his own countw,
and has tried to deliver up the city into the hands of enemies.”
Jeremiah then might have shaken off this burden laid on him; but it was
nccessary for him to bear this reproach, with which he was falsely
charged. Faithful teachers ought indeed to remove, as far as they can,
all calumnies, and to check the wicked and malicious, so that they may
not have the occasion to speak evil; but when they have done all, they
will not yet exempt themselves from calumny; for their words and their
deeds will be misconstrued. Thus Jeremiah was loaded with false charges;
for all had persuaded themselves, that as he had so much extolled the
power of King Nebuchadnezzar, he had been hired by him for the purpose
of depressing the people by fear; and it may be that the violent among
them did wilfully and knowingly make his case to appear worse to the
ignorant, even by false reports. As then this conviction respecting him
prevailed everywhere, he was apprehended as a revolter, as he was going
out of the city.

<span id="ix.vii-p16"></span>But he says, that he intended to go *into
the land of Benjamin,* so as to *separate* himself. The verb <span
id="ix.vii-p16.1"></span>חלק, *chelak,* means to divide, to scatter, to
dissipate; and hence some have given this meaning, that he went into the
land of Benjamin in order to divide his heritage; but this seems harsh
and forced. They add, “In the midst of the people,” as though Jeremiah
wished to make his land common, and to give it to the people: but in
this explanation there is nothing probable or suitable. I therefore
doubt not but that Jeremiah sought this as a quiet place, as it is
understood by most interpreters, he then *went forth towards the land of
Benjamin, that he might separate himself;* that is, that he might be
secluded there in the midst of his people. It is, indeed, a brief mode
of speaking, but the meaning is not *ambiguous,* — *that he might be
there,* where he might separate himself from the people, as the places
were distant from one another.  <span id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md)
For he was tired with the city, because he saw that he spent his labor
in vain. Some think that he was afraid of being cast into prison,
because he had just announced a command greatly disliked; but it is more
probable that, he was worn out with weariness, because he saw that he
made no impression on men so hard and refractory. Hence then it was,
that he wished to withdraw from the presence of the whole people.

<span id="ix.vii-p18"></span>Then follows what we have already
mentioned, that he was *taken in the gate by the keeper Irijah,* as
though he were revolting to the Chaldeans. We have stated how this
suspicion arose, even because he had faithfillly proclaimed the commands
of God. We hence see how God tried his servant, when he thus constrained
him to speak, so that his words became suspected. And hence also we may
gather how thoroughly fixed in the minds of men was that false opinion,
for Jeremiah was not heard in his own defense. He indeed said openly
that he was not fleeing away, nay, that this was a false charge. *It is
a lie,* he says, *I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans*

<span id="ix.vii-p19"></span>I have already reminded you that the verb
<span id="ix.vii-p19.1"></span>נפל *nuphal,* found here, means properly
to fall, but it is to be taken here metaphorically, as signifying to
fall away, or to incline to another side. *Thou* then *fallest away* or
inclinest *to the Chaldeans,* which was the same thing as to revolt. We
see that the Prophet was not charged with a common offense, for it would
have been the highest to forsake his own country and to pass over to the
enemies: it would have been better for him to die a hundred deaths. But,
as I have already said, the servants of God ought to be so courageous as
to despise the slanders of the unprincipled, and, when it so pleases
God, to prepare themselves for patience whenever any reproach is to be
undergone, only let their conscience be always clear before God and
angels; and let also their integrity confute all slanders, and let them
disprove them too, provided there be those who can bear to hear them:
but if a defense be not always admitted, let them patiently bear this
indignity. And this also we ought to notice, that God’s servants, though
ready to clear themselves of crimes ascribed to them, and to defend
their innocence at the peril of life, are yet often repelled and
condemned unheard. This is, indeed, a great indignity; but yet as
Jeremiah met with such a treatment, it ought not at this day to appear
to us unendurable or new. It now follows —

<span id="ix.viii"></span>

<span id="ix.viii-p1"></span><span id="ix.viii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#015.md)<span id="ix.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.viii-p2"></span>**15**. Wherefore the princes were wroth
with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of
Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.

<span id="ix.viii-p3"></span>**15**. Et ebullierunt (iracundia)
principes *(nam* <span id="ix.viii-p3.1"></span>קצף*; hoc significat,
vel,* efferbuerunt principes) contra Jeremiam, et percusserunt eum
*(alii vetunt transitive,* percutere fecerunt, *sed proprie est
percutere, vel verberare,* percusserunt *ergo* eun) et posuerunt ipsum
in domum carceris, in domum Jonathan scribae, quia ipsam fecerant *(id
est,* constituerant) in domum carceris.

<span id="ix.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.viii-p5"></span><span id="ix.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.viii-p6"></span>Here Jeremiah pursues the same narrative,
and shews how unjustly he was treated, for he found no equity at the
hands of the princes any more than in the keeper of the ward. He was no
doubt prepared to defend himself before them, and sufficient proof was
ready at hand, only he would have had to speak to the deaf. But here he
shews by one word that the liberty of speaking was precluded, for a
furious madness seized them that they would not hear him. And here we
may notice how much opposed is wrath to just and peaceable decisions;
for if we wish to be right and equitable judges, self-government is
especially necessary. When, therefore, our minds are inflamed with anger
or wrath, it is impossible that any rectitude or humanity should
prevail. So Jeremiah complains that he was oppressed, because the
princes boiled with rage, so that they suffered him not to give the
explanation which he had prepared.

<span id="ix.viii-p7"></span>He then adds, that they *smote him* They no
doubt ordered their servants to smite him; for it would have been more
than strange, had the princes themselves risen up to strike the Prophet
with their fists, or to smite him with their hands. It is then probable
that he was smitten by their orders and at their bidding. This is the
reason, if I mistake not, why some have given this rendering, “They
caused him to be smitten.” But he is often said to have killed a man,
who has ordered him to be killed, while he himself had not touched him
with his finger. Even so Jeremiah was smitten by the princes, because
they had commanded him to be smitten. And this passage shews also, as in
a glass, how miserable would be the condition of God’s servants, were he
not to sustain them by the power of his Spirit. For here is a holy
Prophet overwhelmed with unjust accusations and also reproaches, and the
princes abstained not from stripes, and at last he was cast into a pit.
Whenever, then, such, a thing happens to us, let us cast our eyes on
Jeremiah, and let it not be grievous to us to follow the steps of the
holy Prophet; nor let us think it hard to endure the trials with which
God was pleased to exercise him. They *put him,* he says, *in the
house,* and then the word is changed, *the prison,* <span
id="ix.viii-p7.1"></span>האסור *easur,* but; the same thing is meant. It
now follows what sort of prison it was —

<span id="ix.ix"></span>

<span id="ix.ix-p1"></span><span id="ix.ix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#016.md)<span id="ix.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ix-p2"></span>**16**. When Jeremiah was entered into the
dungeon, and into the cabins, and jeremiah had remained there many days;

<span id="ix.ix-p3"></span>**16**. Et quo venit Jeremias in domum lacus,
et ad mansiones, et sedit ibi Jeremias diebus multis.

<span id="ix.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.ix-p5"></span><span id="ix.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ix-p6"></span>The particle <span id="ix.ix-p6.1"></span>כי,
*ki,* is to be taken here as an adverb of time, as I think, though
interpreters have not observed this, *When Jeremiah*, he says, *came
into the house of the pit* or dungeon, or of the prison. The word <span
id="ix.ix-p6.2"></span>בור means also sometimes the grave, but is to be
taken here for a pit or a deep place: he means that it was a dark and
filthy prison. And he adds, *and to the dwellings* I know not why some
have rendered it, “victualling houses;” for the word <span
id="ix.ix-p6.3"></span>החניות*, echeniot,* means narrow prisons, which
we call at this day *cachots:*  <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md)
he was therefore cast into a dungeon, where there were narrow places,
that, the holy man had no space either freely to rise or to stand or to
sit down, or to he down. Then the Prophet shews that he was so confined
by the straitness of the place, that he could hardly sit or lay down or
stand erect.; and he says that he was there many days.  <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md)

<span id="ix.ix-p9"></span>We must notice the circumstances of the case:
It was a thing cruel enough in itself, that an innocent man, after
having been beaten, should be thrust into prison: but when a dark and
deep prison was chosen, and when he was confined to a narrow place, as
though he was in fetters, it was a great addition to the indignity
offered to him. Since then the holy Prophet was so atrociously treated,
let us not think it strange, when the same thing at this day is endured
by God’s children, and for the same cause, even for bearing testimony to
celestial truth. When the length of time is added, it increased the
evil; for he was not retained in prison for a few days or for a month,
but until the city was taken; not indeed in that prison, for the king,
as we shall presently see, removed him into the ccurt of the prison. He
was, however, the second time cast into a filthy prison, as though he
was destined to die; thence he was afterwards removed also by the order
of the king. But the Prophet says, that he was in that dungeon many
days. It now follows —

<span id="ix.x"></span>

<span id="ix.x-p1"></span><span id="ix.x-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
37:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#017.md)<span id="ix.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.x-p2"></span>**17**. Then Zedekiah the king sent, and
tookhim out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is
there *any* word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said
he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.

<span id="ix.x-p3"></span>**17**. Et misit rex Zedechias et sustulit
cum; et interrogavit eum rex domi suae secreto loco *(hoc est,* seorsum)
et dixit, Estne sermo a Jehova? Tunc dixit Jeremias, Est; et cixit, In
manum regis Babylonis traderis.

<span id="ix.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.x-p5"></span><span id="ix.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.x-p6"></span>From these words we learn, that King Zedekiah,
though he had not obeyed good and wise counsels, nor even God and his
truth, was not yet one of the worst, for of his own self he called the
Prophet to him, and wished to find out whether he could in any way
appease God. There is here, in short, a description given of the
character of Zedekiah: he was unwilling to submit to God and his word,
and yet he was not so cruel as to become enraged against the Prophet;
nor had he wholly cast away all fear of God, all concern for religion,
and all regard for prophetic teaching. For he no doubt sent for Jeremiah
as God’s true servant, and in some degree honored him, and wished God to
be propitious to himself. But this is usually the case with hypocrites:
they would willingly be reconciled with God, but at the same time they
wish to remain free, that is, to retain their own sinful dispositions;
in short, they wish so to live as that God should give place to them,
and allow them to sin as they please. Such was Zedekiah, and yet he had
not reached to the highest pitch of impiety, for as yet he had some
regard for the Prophet; nor was he so savage and cruel as his
counsellors. He then called him to himself and asked him privately, that
he might not depart, as we shall see in another place, in any measure
from his royal dignity: for he simply asked the Prophet not to speak
openly, because he would thus lose his own authority.

<span id="ix.x-p7"></span>He then *asked* him in *secret,* because he
had been perplexed. He wished indeed for some favorable answer, but he
hardly dared to hope for it; and therefore he led the Prophet to a
secret place, and asked him without any being a witness, *Is there,* he
said, *a word from God?* Some explain this, as though Zedekiah had asked
whether the prophecies of Jeremiah were true, as though he had said,
“What thou hast hitherto spoken, has it come from God?” but this is no
suitable explanation; on the contrary, he asked, Whether the Prophet had
lately received any word from God? He wished then for some new message,
and to hear something respecting the future deliverance of the city: for
he was no doubt persuaded that Jeremiah had been hitherto discharging
the office of a Prophet, as it became him; for he did not ask him as a
common man, nor did he regard him as an impostor, but inquired whether
there was a word from God. True is what I before stated, that hypocrites
always seek God’s favor in a foolish way; for they would have God to
gratify their sinful lusts, but God cannot deny himself. Hence Zedekiah,
though he shewed apparently some regard for religion, yet foolishly
asked, Whether there was a word from Jehovah? that is, Whether any
message had been lately made known to Jeremiah? He answered, *There is,*
even this, *Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the Chaldeans*

<span id="ix.x-p8"></span>Here we may notice the boldness of the
Prophet; he had not been broken down by all the evils he had met with,
but ever faithfully performed the office committed to him. He therefore
answered the king honestly, though not without danger, *Thou shalt be
delivered,* he said, *into the hands of the Chaldeans:* for he had
hardly come out of prison, where he had been buried as in a grave, and
we shall see that the prison had been to him like death; and the Prophet
was not divested of infirmity and fear, as he will presently shew; yet
fear did not prevent him from faithfully performing the office committed
to him. Though the Prophet dreaded the sufferings of the prison, though
he also feared death, he yet overcame all these feelings, and presented
his life as a sacrifice, when he openly and boldly answered the king,
that the Chaldeans would shortly be conquerors, and make him a captive.
Then follows the expostulation which the Prophet made to the king —

<span id="ix.xi"></span>

<span id="ix.xi-p1"></span><span id="ix.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
37:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#018.md)<span id="ix.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xi-p2"></span>**18**. Moreover Jeremiah said unto king
Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or
against this people, that ye have put me in prison?

<span id="ix.xi-p3"></span>**18**. Et dixit Jeremias regi Zedechiae:
Quid peccavi tibi et servis tuis? *(hoc est,* quid sceleris in to admisi
et in servos tuos) et populum hunc, quod tradidistis me in domum
carceris.

<span id="ix.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.xi-p5"></span><span id="ix.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xi-p6"></span>Though the Prophet had spoken what was
displeasing to the king, he yet complains that wrong had been done to
him, as he had been cast into prison; and thus he shews that he had been
unjustly condemned for having threatened ruin to the city and
destruction to the kingdom, because he was constrained to do this by the
obligations of his office. Hence the Prophet shews that he had not
sinned in this — that he had proclaimed God’s commands, however bitter
they were to the king and to the people.

<span id="ix.xi-p7"></span>This passage deserves special notice: earthly
princes are so proud, that as soon as they order anything, they wish
every dispute about their authority to be suspended; for they will have
their own ordinances to be counted laws, and their own decrees to be
sacred and authoritative; and yet we know, that by following their own
wills, they decree often what is wholly unjust and inconsistent with
everything that is reasonable. This passage then, as I have said,
deserves special notice; for Jeremiah boldly declares that he had not
sinned, because he had threatened the king, displeased his counsellors,
inveighed against the impiety of the people, and denounced utter ruin on
the city and the Temple. He then denies that in all this he had done
anything wrong. So also Daniel said,

<span id="ix.xi-p8"></span>“Against God and the king have I not sinned,”
(<span id="ix.xi-p8.1"></span>[Da
6:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan006.htm#022)<span id="ix.xi-p8.1"></span>.md)

<span id="ix.xi-p9"></span>and yet he had disregarded the king’s decree,
and firmly refused by an impious flattery to put the king in the place
of God: he however denied that he had done anything wrong against the
king, because his decree was unjust and wicked. Let us then bear in
mind, that though princes may in bear their decrees to be disregarded by
us, they are yet not absolved before God and his angels, and also that
we can boldly, openly, and with a full mouth, as they say, assert our
innocence, when religion constrains us, and when it is not lawful to
obey the impious and unjust edicts of kings. He afterwards adds —

<span id="ix.xii"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p1"></span><span id="ix.xii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
37:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#019.md)<span id="ix.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p2"></span>**19**. Where *are* now your prophets which
prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against
you, nor against this land?

<span id="ix.xii-p3"></span>**19**. Et ubi prophertae vestri, qui
prophetarunt vobis, dicendo, Non veniet rex Babylonis contra vos et
contra hanc terram?

<span id="ix.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.xii-p5"></span><span id="ix.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xii-p6"></span>Here Jeremiah, taking confidence, advances
to a higher ground; for he reprobates the folly of Zedekiah, because he
had given ear to the false prophets and their flatteries. But this he
did, that he might more fully confirm his own innocence, as though he
had said, “I indeed am grievously blamed, because I threatened ruin to
the city and the Temple; but what if the Lord had constrained me to do
so? and it is evident that I was commissioned by God, and that I alleged
nothing without authority; for I have always declared what has happened,
and events have proved that I was sent from above, when I announced to
you what was to be. But where are your prophets? for they have been
always flattering you; and it has happened through their falsehoods,
that ye have not returned to the right way. It was yet in your power to
be reconciled to God, when I at first warned you; and all my labor and
endeavors were for this end, that you might anticipate God’s wrath by a
willing repentance. Since then your prophets have deceived you, and the
event now clearly proves this, know, O king, that I have been sent from
above.”

<span id="ix.xii-p7"></span>We thus see that Jeremiah was not so anxious
about his life, but that he always remained stedfast to his purpose; and
thus he turned not aside from making an honest profession of the truth,
so as to provide for his own safety, as they do, who are fearful and
think that they act prudently, when they are compliant and try to please
men opposed to them at the expense of truth. This was not done by
Jeremiah. He had indeed a regard for his life, as we shall now see; but
he went on in the discharge of his office, and valued the truth
communicated to him from above more than hundred lives. It is then with
reference to this that he says, *Where are your prophets?* as though he
had said, “You see that you have all been deceived by their false
prophecies.” It follows —

<span id="ix.xiii"></span>

<span id="ix.xiii-p1"></span><span id="ix.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
37:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#020.md)<span id="ix.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xiii-p2"></span>**20**. Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O
my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before
thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the
scribe, lest I die there.

<span id="ix.xiii-p3"></span>**20**. Et tu audi obsecro *(vel,* nunc,
*vel* agedum) domine mi Rex; cadat precatio mea coram facie tua, ut ne
*(ad verbum,* et non *sed, potius,* ut ne) remittas me *(v.el,* redire
me facias) in domum Jonathan scribae, neque moriar lilic.

<span id="ix.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.xiii-p5"></span><span id="ix.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xiii-p6"></span>This verse shews that Jeremiah was not
destitute of human feelings, for he, as other men, dreaded death. But
yet he could so control himself, that no fear made him to turn aside
from his duty. Fear, then, did not dishearten him, as the boldness which
we have noticed was a manifest proof of his constancy. The Prophet
therefore overcame, as to his work, every anxiety and the fear of death;
and yet he did not disregard his life, but sought, as far as he could,
deliverance from his evils. He asked for some alleviation from the king.
We hence see that the Prophets were not logs of wood, nor had iron
hearts; but though subject to human feelings, yet they elevated
themselves to an invincible courage as to their work, so as to fulfill
their office.

<span id="ix.xiii-p7"></span>As to the words, *Let my prayer fall before
thee,* they mean a humble supplication; it is a mode of expression
derived, as we have before seen, from what was done by men in
prostrating themselves in prayer, and is transferred here from God to
mortals. The Prophet then humbly asked, that he might not be cast again
into that horrid prison where he had been confined — and why? that he
might *not die* We see that he shunned death, for this was natural; and
yet he was prepared to die, whenever necessary, rather than to turn
aside in the least from discharging the duty imposed on him by God.

<span id="ix.xiv"></span>

<span id="ix.xiv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="ix.xiv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we must in
various ways carry on a warfare on earth, we may be animated by the
power of thy Spirit, so as to go on through fire and water, and be ever
so subject to thee, that relying on thine aid, we may never hesitate to
face all perils of death, all troubles, all reproaches, and all the
terrors of men, until having at length gained the final victory, we
shall come to that blessed rest, which thine only-begotten Son hath
procured for us by his own blood. — Amen.

<span id="ix.xv-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and forty-Seventh

<span id="ix.xvi"></span>

<span id="ix.xvi-p1"></span><span id="ix.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
37:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer037.htm#021.md)<span id="ix.xvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xvi-p2"></span>**21**. Then Zedekiah the king commanded
that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that
they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers’ street,
until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in
the court of the prison.

<span id="ix.xvi-p3"></span>**21**. Et praecepit rex Zedechias, et
posuerunt Jeremiam in atrio custodiae, et dederunt ei frustum panis
quotidie e platea pistorum, usque dum consumptus esset totus panis ex
urbe; et habitavit Jeremias in atrio custodiae.

<span id="ix.xvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.xvi-p5"></span><span id="ix.xvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xvi-p6"></span>The Prophet tells us, that God regarded the
miseries to which he had been unjustly exposed: and the king no doubt
became humane towards Jeremiah, because God turned his heart towards
what was just and right. We said, indeed, yesterday, that the king was
not in disposition cruel or sanguinary; yet he would not have been so
easily eritreated by the Prophet, had he not been influenced by the
hidden working of God’s Spirit. We hence see how God favors his servants
and has regard for their infirmity when necessary. We yet see also that
the Prophet was not so kindly dealt with as to be allowed to return free
to his own house, but that he was removed to another prison, where his
condition was more tolerable. *He was* then *in the court of the prison*

<span id="ix.xvi-p7"></span>He says, that a *crust of bread was given to
him daily,* or every day. The word <span id="ix.xvi-p7.1"></span>ככר*,
kekar,* is by some rendered “mass,” or lump, and means sometimes a large
loaf; but it is probable, that during so much scarcity the Prophet had
but a scanty living. He had then a *crust* or piece of *bread every day*
We see how mean was his food; but God often tries his servants in this
way, withholding from them all the delicacies of this world. It is
added, *from the street of the bakers;* by these words is meant, I
think, that it was coarse bread, not made of fine flour, such as rich
men did eat, for their mouths could not endure what was rough and
course. Then God’s holy Prophet was content with the common bread. The
king and his counsellors had their own bakers; but it is said that bread
was brought to the Prophet from a common place, *the street of the
bakers* And the bread then sold during such a scarcity was no doubt
black bread. We hence see what kind of bread it was, because it was sold
for the common use of the people.

<span id="ix.xvi-p8"></span>Thus the Prophet shews, that though some
relaxation was allowed him, he was still confined in prison, and also
that no meat nor any delicacies were given him, but a crust of bread
only. He however commemorates the favor of God, inasmuch as in so great
a scarcity he was not without bread. He had, then, his daily bread until
all provisions failed.

<span id="ix.xvi-p9"></span>And hence we learn, that God often so
provides for his servants, that he appears to have forsaken them; and
yet he then especially takes care of them and supplies them with what is
needful for their support. Had Jeremiah been at home, he might have been
at any time stoned by the people; for there were not wanting those
disposed to stir up famished men against him. He might then have been
every moment in danger of his life at home. But now in prison, he was
safe, and no one could do him any harm. Besides, had he been at home,
many might have robbed him, so as to leave him nothing to preserve life;
but in prison he had his daily allowance. Thus, then, God often conducts
his servants in a manner that is wonderful and beyond what we can
conceive, and in the meantime acts as the head of a family, in supplying
their wants. In short, the Prophet here intimates that he was cared for
by God, so that during the famine and scarcity among the whole people,
his bread was yet given to him, when he could not have begged it. When
he could not have procured bread for himself either by labor, or by
industry, or by begging, or by money, he shews that God took care of him
so as to feed him during that distress.

<span id="ix.xvi-p10"></span>He however adds, that he was *in the court
of the prison,* in order to shew that God tried his patience, for a
prison was a place of degradation. The Prophet was exposed to the
reproaches of all; and then the princes might have often threatened him
with danger, and might have also transferred him to another place, as we
shall hereafter see. Therefore, in a measure only did God bring aid to
his Prophet, for it was not his pleasure wholly to deliver him, and yet
he suffered him not to be reduced to extremities. Now follows —

<span id="ix.vii-p17"></span> The idea of trafficking or buying is given
by the *Sept.,* “to buy thence in the midst of the people.” The *Vulg.*
is, “that he might divide there *his* possession in the sight of the
citizens;” and materially the same meaning is given by the *Syr.* and
the *Targ.* The literal rendering is, “For a portion from thence (or,
there) among the people;” which seems to mean, that he intended to go to
the land of Benjanmin, that he might get his portion or share from the
inheritance he had among his people. So that *Blayney’s* version appears
to be right, “to receive a portion thereof among the people.” The
Chaldeans had deprived him of his patrimony in the land of Benjamin:
when they retreated he purposed to go there, “with the view,” as
*Blayney* observes, “of coming in for a share of the produce of the land
with the rest of his neighbors.” — *Ed*.

<span id="ix.ix-p7"></span> The versions and the *Targ.* render the word
differently; its meaning was not evidently understood. *Blaney* gives
the best explanation, who renders it “cells.” “The dungeon,” he says,
was a deep pit like a well, and near the bottom were scooped niches, or
cells, for the lodgement of the prisoners. The word comes from, <span
id="ix.ix-p7.1"></span>הנה, to fix, to settle, to lodge; hence the
plural noun here means places for prisoners to settle or lodge on, where
they could fix themselves, without sinking in the mire at the bottom of
the pit, as the case was with Jeremiah on another occasion. See <span
id="ix.ix-p7.2"></span>[Jer 38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006.md)<span
id="ix.ix-p7.2"></span>. That pit, it seems, had no cells. — *Ed*

<span id="ix.ix-p8"></span> This paragraph is intermingled in the
original with the text; but it has been thought better to introduce it
separately. — *Ed*.
