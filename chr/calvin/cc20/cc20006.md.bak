<span id="vii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 35

<span id="vii.i"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p1"></span><span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
35:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p2"></span>**1**. The word which came unto Jeremiah from
the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,
saying,

<span id="vii.i-p3"></span>**1**. Sermo qui factus fuit ad Jeremiam a
Jehova diebus Jehoiakim filii Joziae regis Jehudah, dicendo,

<span id="vii.i-p4"></span>**2**. Go unto the house of the Rechabites,
and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one
of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.

<span id="vii.i-p5"></span>**2**. Vade ad domum Rechabitarum, et dices
illis, (et loquere cum ipsis) et adducas eos in domum Jehovae ad unum
cubiculorum, et popina illis vinum.

<span id="vii.i-p6"></span>**3**. Then I took Jaazaniah the son of
Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and
the whole house of the Rechabites;

<span id="vii.i-p7"></span>**3**. Et sumpsi Jaazaniah filium Jeremiae,
filii Habazaniiae, et fratres ejus, (hoc est, cognatos) et omnes filios
ejus, totam domum Rechabitarum;

<span id="vii.i-p8"></span>**4**. And I brought them into the house of
the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a
man of God, which *was* by the chamber of the princes, which *was* above
the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:

<span id="vii.i-p9"></span>**4**. Et adduxi eos in domum Jehovae ad
cubiculum filiorum Chanan filii Igdaliae, viri Dei, quod erat juxta
cubiculum principum, quod erat e super cubiculo Maassaiae filii Selum
custodis thesauri (alii vertunt, liminis, sed sine ratione, ut
milhividetur)-

<span id="vii.i-p10"></span>**5**. And I set before the sons of the
house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto
them, Drink ye wine.

<span id="vii.i-p11"></span>**5**. Et posui in conspectu filiorum domus
Rechabitarum (vel, coram filiis domus Rechabitarum) scyphos plenos vino,
et calices, et dixi, Bibite vinum.

<span id="vii.i-p12"></span>**6**. But they said, We will drink no wine:
for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall
drink no wine, *neither ye,* nor your sons for ever:

<span id="vii.i-p13"></span>**6**. Et dixerunt, Non bibimus vinum, quia
Jonadab filius Rechab, pater noster (vel, patris nostri) praecepit
nobis, dicendo, Non bibetis vinum, vos et filii vestri, usque in
seculum;

<span id="vii.i-p14"></span>**7**. Neither shall ye build house, nor sow
seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have *any*: but all your days ye shall
dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye *be*
strangers.

<span id="vii.i-p15"></span>**7**. Et domos non aedificabitia, et semen
non seretis, et vitem non plantabitis, et non erit vobis quicquam, quia
(hoc est, quin potius) habitabitis in tabernaculis, cunctis diebus
vestris, ut vivatis dies multos in superficie terrae in qua vos
peregrini estis.

<span id="vii.i-p16"></span> 

<span id="vii.i-p17"></span><span id="vii.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p18"></span>It must be first observed, that the order of
time in which the prophecies were written has not been retained. In
history the regular succession of days and years ought to be preserved,
but in prophetic writings this is not so necessary, as I have already
reminded you. The Prophets, after having been preaching, reduced to a
summary what they had spoken; a copy of this was usually affixed to the
doors of the Temple, that every one desirous of knowing celestial
doctrine might read the copy; and it was afterwards laid up in the
archives. From these were formed the books now extant. And what I say
may be gathered from certain and known facts. But that we may not now
multiply words, this passage shews that the prophecy of Jeremiah
inserted here did not follow the last discourse, for he relates what he
had been commanded to say and to do in the time of Jehoiakim, that is,
fifteen years before the destruction of the city. Hence what I have said
is evident, that Jeremiah did not write the book as it exists now, but
that his discourses were collected and formed into a volume, without
regard to the order of time. The same may be also gathered from the
prophecies which we shall hereafter see, from the forty-fifth to the end
of the fiftieth chapter.

<span id="vii.i-p19"></span>The power of the kingdom of Judah was not so
weakened under King Jehoiakim, but that they were still inflated with
pride. As, then, their security kept them from being attentive to the
words of the Prophet, it was necessary to set before them a visible
sign, in order to make them ashamed. It was, then, God’s purpose to shew
how inexcusable was their perverseness. This was the design of this
prophecy. And the Prophet was expressly commanded to call together the
Rechabites, and to offer wine to them, in order that the obstinacy of
the people might appear more disgraceful, as they could not be induced
to render obedience to God, while the Rechabites were so obedient to
their father, a mortal man, and who had been dead for nearly three
centuries. The Rechabites derived their origin from Obad and from
Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses. There are those indeed who think
that Obad and Jethro were the same; but this conjecture seems not to me
probable. However this may be, interpreters think that, the Rechabites
were the descendants of Obad, who followed Moses and the Israelites. And
their opinion seems to be confirmed, because it is said here that they
were commanded by Jonadab to live as sojourners in the land. An
inheritance was indeed promised them, but as it appears from many parts
of Scripture, they were unfaith-fifily dealt with, for they were
scattered here and there throughout the tribes. They then did not enjoy
an inheritance as it was right and as they deserved. And we see also
that they lived among other nations.

<span id="vii.i-p20"></span>With regard to *Jonadab,* of whom mention is
made, we read in <span id="vii.i-p20.1"></span>[2Ki
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#015.md)<span id="vii.i-p20.1"></span>,
that he was a man of great name and influence, for when Jehu began to
reign, he had him as his friend, though he was an alien. He must, then,
have been in high esteem, and a man of power and wealth among the
Israelites. And it is certain that it was the same Jonadab of whom
sacred history speaks of there, because he is called the son of Rechab;
and yet three hundred years, or nearly so, had elapsed from that time to
the reign of Jehoiakim. As to the origin of this family or people, the
first was Obad; from him came Rechab, whose son was Jonadab, who lived
in the time of King Jehu, and was raised up into his chariot to be, as
it were, next to him, when Jehu had not as yet his power firmly
established. But they went afterwards to Jerusalem on account of the
continual calamities of the land of Israel, for it was exposed to
constant plunders, and this we shall hereafter see in the narrative.
Then the sons of Rechab did once dwell in the kingdom of Israel; but
when various incursions laid waste the land, and final ruin was at hand,
having left their tents they went to Jerusalem; for they were not
allowed to cultivate either fields or vineyards, as we shall hereafter
see. The Rechabites, therefore, dwelt in the city Jerusalem, which
protected them from the incursions and violence of enemies; but they
still retained their ancient mode of living in abstaining from wine, and
in not cultivating either fields or vineyards. They thought it indeed
right for them to dwell in buildings, because they could not find a
vacant place in the city where they might pitch their tents: but this
was done from necessity. In the meantime they obeyed the command of
their father Jonadab; and though he had been dead three hundred years,
they yet so venerated the memory of their father, that they willingly
abstained from wine, and led not only a frugal but an austere life.

<span id="vii.i-p21"></span>The Prophet is now bidden to *bring these to
the Temple, and to offer them wine to drink* I have briefly explained
the design of God in this matter, even that he purposed to lay before
the Jews the example of the Rechabites, in order to shame them; for that
family obeyed their father after he was dead, but the Jews could not be
induced to submit to the command of the living God, who was also the
only Father of all. The Prophet then was bidden to bring them to the
Temple, and to lay before them cups full of wine, that they might drink.
He says that they *refused* to drink, and brought as a reason, that
Jenadab their father forbade them to do so. We shall hereafter see how
this example was applied; for the whole cannot be explained at the same
time.

<span id="vii.i-p22"></span>Let us consider the Prophet’s words, he says
that the word came to him *in the days of Jehoiakim,* that is, after he
had found out by the trial of many years how untameable the Jews were,
and how great was their ferocity. Much labor then had the Prophet
undertaken, and yet they were not so subdued as to submit to the yoke of
God. When, therefore, they had now for many years given many proofs of
their obduracy, God summoned the Rechabites as witnesses, who, by their
example, proved that the Jews were inexcusable for being so rebellious
and disobedient to the commands of the Prophet.

<span id="vii.i-p23"></span><span id="vii.i-p23.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p24"></span>*Go,* said he, *to the house of Rechab,* (we
have said that they dwelt then at Jerusalem, and this will appear
hereafter) *and bring them unto the house of Jehovah* But we must
inquire why the Prophet was ordered to lay wine before them in the
Temple rather than in a private house. The reason, indeed, is evident;
for God’s purpose was to shew how wicked and perverse the Jews were, for
not even the priests abstained from wine except when they were
performing their duties. The Law commanded them to abstain then from
wine; but the Levites, who took care of the Temple, and also the
priests, when not engaged in the discharge of their office, were fully
allowed to drink wine. As, then, the priests were permitted to drink
wine even in the Temple, that is, in the chambers adjoining the priests’
court, what excuse could have been made when the Rechabites, who were
yet of the common people, and even aliens among the Jews, refused wine
according to the command of their father Jenadab? Had God forbidden the
whole people the use of wine, the Law might have appeared too rigid; but
God not only permitted the people to drink wine, but also the priests;
nay, no religious reverence prevented them from drinking wine close to
the Temple when they were not engaged in their duties. We now, then,
perceive why the place has been mentioned, that is, that the Prophet
relates that he brought the Rechabites into the Temple.

<span id="vii.i-p25"></span>*Go,* then, and *bring them into the house
of Jehovah, into one of the chambers, and offer them wine to drink* We
have said that the chambers were nigh the priests’ court; for many of
the Levites were always keeping watch, guarding the Temple, and also
some of the priests. The priests, while serving their turn, alone
abstained from wine; but a permission was given by the Law to the
Levites to drink wine, and in those very chambers, which were on both
sides a sort of appendages to the Temple.

<span id="vii.i-p26"></span><span id="vii.i-p26.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p27"></span>Now the Prophet adds that he *took
Jaazaniah,* who was a chief man, and as it were the head of the family.
And he names his father, even *Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah;* and he
then says, *his whole house* It is added, that he *brought them into the
Temple, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a
man of God* The Prophet no doubt chose a well-known place, that the
report of this might spread through the whole city, and even throughout
Judea, and also that the dignity of the place might add credit to the
report; for we know that when a thing is done in an obscure corner, it
may be regarded as doubtful or fabulous. But the Prophet brought the
Rechabites into an honorable place, even *into the chamber of the sons
of Hanan* And he afterwards says, that he was *the son of Igdaliah, a
man of God* Doubtless such was the reverence in which this man was held,
that no one dared to call into question what had been done there. Then
he adds that the *chamber was nigh the chamber of the princes, which was
over the chamber of the keeper of the treasury* Some render the last
word, “the entrance,”  <span id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) the word
means a vessel; and it signifies here the sacred furniture; and there is
a change of number, for this word included all the vessels of the
Temple. We hence see that the place was select, superior to other
places, so that it might be as a notable theater, and that the prophecy
might thus gain more credit among all the Jews.

<span id="vii.i-p29"></span><span id="vii.i-p29.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p30"></span>He says, that he *set wine before them* and
requested them to drink when full cups were placed before them. Then he
adds that they refused, *We will not drink wine, because Jonadab our
father commanded us, saying, Drink ye no wine, nor build houses, nor sow
seed, nor plant vineyards, nor have any such thing as your own* We see
that four things were commanded the Rechabites by their father, to drink
no wine, to cultivate no fields, and to plant no vineyards, — these were
three; and the fourth was, not to build houses, but to be content with
tents. Here is also added a promise, *that ye may live long in the land
where ye are strangers* Then Jonadab promised to his sons and his
posterity a long life, if they obeyed his precepts, that is, to live
without wine all their life, and not to possess anything, nor build
houses. Their saying that they had obeyed their father’s precept, shall
be hereafter considered, for we cannot take in everything at once.

<span id="vii.i-p31"></span>But let us now see whether Jenadab did what
was right in forbidding his posterity to drink wine and to cultivate
land. Agriculture is in itself a mode of living not only honest and
innocent, but also remote from ambition, fraud, and plunder: in short,
it seems to be of all kinds of living the simplest and the most
innocent. Then the advice of Jenadab to keep his sons from agriculture
might in this instance be blamed and condemned. But the probability is,
that when he saw the Jews and the Israelites despising the Law of their
God, he thought of the vengeance, which, though it followed not for a
long time, yet ought then to have been dreaded. He also saw the sources
of vices, even that the Israelites especially gave themselves up to
luxuries, and indulged themselves, as it clearly appears from the
Prophets, in all manner of excesses. When, therefore, he saw, on the one
hand, the corruptions of the land, and that on the other he dreaded
punishment, he wished his posterity to accustom themselves to an austere
mode of living, so that they might more easily move here and there, and
also that they might with more tranquil minds endure any adversity that
might happen, being neither rich nor used to delicacies. Jenadab then
did not condemn agriculture, nor the use of wine, nor commodious
habitations, when he commanded his posterity to be contented with tents
and water, and wished them to buy wheat and to follow only a pastoral
life; but as we have said, he had another object in view. This, then, is
what we are, in the first place, to bear in mind.

<span id="vii.i-p32"></span>But we must observe, at the same time, that
the posterity of Jenadab did not live on plunder, nor spend their time
in idleness; for they were shepherds, who with great labor and many
watchings gained their own living. But it was their father Jonadab’s
wish that they should in a manner be separated from the common affairs
of life, on account of the corruptions which prevailed, and which he saw
rampant before his eyes; so that he had no doubt as to what was to be,
when the Israelites abandoned themselves more and more to all kinds of
excesses, and when all integrity was disregarded. This then was the
reason why Jenadab restrained his posterity from following the common
way of living.

<span id="vii.i-p33"></span>His counsel is, however, not commended, but
the obedience which his sons rendered; and this is here proposed as an
example, in order to make the Jews ashamed, because they so perversely
rejected the Law of God and the doctrine of the Prophets: and it is an
argument from the less to the greater; for if the authority of a mortal
man prevailed so much with his posterity as to cause them to abstain
from wine, and not only to live frugally, but also to endure cold and
want and other hard things, how much more it behoved the Jews to do what
was right and easy, when God commanded them: This is one thing, even a
comparison between God and mortal man. And then there is another, — that
this precept continued in force for three hundred years, and kept
posterity from neglect; but the Law of God, which continually sounded in
the ears of the people, had no power to influence them. Here is another
comparison. The third is, that God acted equitably, and did not press
too much on the Jews, so as to make the rigor of the law odious and
wearisome: as then God used moderation in his Law, so as to require from
the people nothing but what was easy to be borne, he says that Jonadab
was rigid and austere, for he forbade the use of wine and did not allow
his posterity to cultivate fields, nor to dwell in houses.

<span id="vii.i-p34"></span>This threefold comparison ought then to be
borne in mind, and these three parts of the contrast ought to be well
considered, even that God had not obtained from his people what Jonadab
had from his posterity; and also that God, continually admonishing,
prevailed nothing, when a regard for a dead man retained posterity in
their duty; and further, that the Law of God, which required nothing but
what might be easily done, had been perversely rejected by the Jews,
when the Rechabites, in honor to their dead father, suffered themselves
to be deprived of all luxuries, and dreaded not an austere, rustic, and,
as it were, a savage kind of life; for they not only abstained from
wine, but also dared not to shelter themselves from cold by dwelling in
houses, and were forbidden all the comforts of life.

<span id="vii.i-p35"></span>Now that. the Prophet was ordered to offer
them wine, and that they refused, a question here arises, Was their
continency in this respect laudable? They seemed thus to prefer Jonadab
to God, for they knew that Jeremiah, who offered them wine, was sent by
God. But the Rechabites, no doubt, modestly excused themselves, when
they said that it was not right for them to drink wine, because they had
been forbidden by their father. It was not then their purpose to give
more honor to their father than to God or to his Prophet, but they
simply answered for the sake of excusing themselves, that they had
abstained from wine for three hundred years, that is, that the whole
family had done so. This, then, is the solution of the question. But
what the Papists do in bringing against us the Rechabites, first to
support their tyrannical laws, and secondly, in order to torment
miserable consciences at their pleasure, is frivolous in the extreme. As
I have already said, the advice of Jonadab is not commended, as though
he had rightly forbidden his sons to drink wine; but only his sons are
spoken of as having reverently and humbly obeyed the command of their
dead father. Then this passage gives no countenance to the Papists, as
though the object of it was to bind the consciences of the faithful to
their laws; for what is here spoken of is, that the Rechabites proved by
their obedience how base and wicked was the obduracy of the people, as
they shewed less reverence and honor to God than these did to a man that
was dead.

<span id="vii.i-p36"></span>But the Papists, however, dwell much on
another point, — that whatever has been handed down from the fathers
ought to be observed; and thus they reason, “The authority of the whole
Church is greater than that of a private man; now the Rechabites are
commended for having followed the command of a private individual, much
more then ought we to obey the laws of the Church.” To this I answer,
that we ought to obey the fathers and the whole Church: nor have we a
controversy with them on this subject; for we do not simply say, that
everything which men have delivered to us ought to be rejected; but we
deny that we ought to obey the laws of men, when they bind the
conscience without any necessity. When, therefore, a religious act is
enjoined on us, men arrogate to themselves what is peculiar to God
alone; thus the authority of God is violated, when men claim so much for
themselves as to bind consciences by their own laws. We must then
distinguish between civil laws, such as are introduced to preserve
order, or for some other end, and spiritual laws, such as are introduced
into God’s worship, and by which religion is enjoined, and necessity is
laid on consciences. — But I cannot now finish, for I see that the hour
has already passed.

<span id="vii.ii"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vii.ii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast been
pleased to adopt us for thy children, and also to shew to us what
pleases thee, — O grant, that we may in all things be obedient to thee,
and never turn aside either to the right hand or to the left; and as
thou exhortest us also continually, and stirrest us onward, grant that
we may, in quiet meekness of spirit, so surrender ourselves to be ruled
by thee, as to prove ourselves to be thy children, and to glorify thee
as our Father, until we shall enjoy that eternal inheritance, which is
laid up for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="vii.iii"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Fortieth

<span id="vii.iii-p2"></span>We said in the last Lecture that the
example of the Rechabites is brought forward, not for the purpose of
commending their obedience, as though it were some great virtue, but
only that the Prophet might reprove the Jews for rendering less honor to
the living God, than the Rechabites did to their dead father. And,
doubtless, this comparison must have exhibited the Jews as acting very
disgracefully, for they could not be induced to render obedience, though
they had before their eyes the Rechabites as an example. We have also
said, that Jenadab did not forbid his posterity to drink wine, to sow
fields, and to plant vineyards, in order to set up something new in
God’s worship; but that he did so, because he deemed it good for his
posterity thus to sojourn in the land, so that they might not become
attached to their possessions, and that amidst various changes they
might be less anxious, and be prepared, as it were, to move elsewhere.
We have hence shewn that the Papists ignorantly pervert this passage in
order to support their tyrannical laws, in which they pretend to include
the spiritual worship of God, and by which they also distress miserable
souls; for there is no likeness nor affinity between the command of
Jenadab and those laws which are introduced for the purpose of
establishing the spiritual worship of God.

<span id="vii.iii-p3"></span>For it was not primarily the object of
Jonadab’s precept to demand from his posterity an abstinence from wine
as a necessary thing, but it had a regard to what was quite different.
Now, what is commanded for another end, as it is not necessary, so it is
not opposed to the word of God; for their liberty of conscience is not
taken away: nor was it Jonadab’s design to claim for himself the right
and authority of God, as though he were a spiritual lawgiver; but his
precept only referred to what was civil or social. It hence appears how
unlike was his command to the tyrannical laws by which liberty is
destroyed under the Papacy. Were it allowable to speak jocosely, we
might say, that it is a wonder that the Papists make so much of this
example, which yet none of them follow; for though the monks have among
them rigid and severe laws, as to eating and drinking, yet the most holy
among them have never observed them; and there has not been a Carthusian
or a Celestian, who submitted to the obligation of abstaining from wine.
If then this virtue of the Rechabites pleases them so much, why do they
not discontinue the use of wine? But this I have not said seriously.

<span id="vii.iii-p4"></span>With regard to the subject itself, the
solution is certain and easy, — that the Rechabites are not commended as
though they had obeyed their father as God, but that they obediently
received what their father had commanded them, because it was only a
civil precept: he therefore had in view an ulterior object; and he did
not require abstinence from wine and other things for its own sake. And
Paul, even by one sentence, has settled this controversy; for when he
exhorts children to obey their parents, he modifies his exhortation by
saying,

<span id="vii.iii-p5"></span>“In the Lord.” (<span
id="vii.iii-p5.1"></span>[Eph 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#001.md)<span
id="vii.iii-p5.1"></span>)

<span id="vii.iii-p6"></span>We then see that Paul commands children to
obey their parents, not in everything, or without limitation, but so
that God, who is the Sovereign and the only Father of all, may still
retain his authority, and that earthly parents may not claim for
themselves so much authority as to ascend the throne of God, as though
they were lawgivers to souls. Let us now proceed —

<span id="vii.iv"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
35:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p2"></span>**8**. Thus have we obeyed the voice of
Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to
drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;

<span id="vii.iv-p3"></span>**8**. Et audivimus in voce *(hoc est,*
obedivimus voci) Jenadab, filii Rechab, patris nostri, secundum omnia
qute mandavit nobis, ne biberemus vinum cunctus diebus nostris, nos,
uxores nostrae, filii nostri, et filiae nostrae;

<span id="vii.iv-p4"></span>**9**. Nor to build houses for us to dwell
in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:

<span id="vii.iv-p5"></span>**9**. Et ne, aedificaremus domes in quibus
habitaremus, et ne vitis vel ager vel semen nobis esset *(ad verbum*, et
vitis et ager et semen non erunt nobis)

<span id="vii.iv-p6"></span>**10**. But we have dwelt in tents, and have
obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.

<span id="vii.iv-p7"></span>**10**. Et habitavimus (quin potius, *est
enim copula resolvenda in adversativam particulam,* quin potius
habitavimus) in tabernaculis, et obedivimus, et fecimus secundum omnia
quae praecepit nobis Jonadab pater noster.

<span id="vii.iv-p8"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv-p9"></span><span id="vii.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p10"></span>Jeremiah explains at large what might have
been expressed in few words, in order to amplify the constancy of the
Rechabites. For one may obey his father, and yet be not so fixed in his
purpose, but that he might on some slight occasion fail in his duty.
Jeremiah here shews that such was the prompt perseverance of the
Rechabites, that they could not be enticed by having wine set before
them; but that as though no temptation had been presented to them, they
kept the commandment of their father, who, at the same time, had been
dead, as it has already appeared, some ages before.

<span id="vii.iv-p11"></span>They then said, that they *hearkened to the
voice of Jonabab the son of Rechab, their father;* and also added,
*according to all the things which he has commanded us* tle again
relates what Jonadab had commanded, and to this belongs the sentence,
*According to all things,* etc. For had he ordered them only to be
abstemious, to obey would not have been difficult or hard; he designed
to bind them to a wandering life, that they might be covered only by
tents, and that they might not possess anything. As then Jonadab did not
in one thing only try the obedience of his family, it appears more
clearly how great was their promptitude and perseverance in obeying.

<span id="vii.iv-p12"></span>They then said, first, that they were *not
to drink wine;* and also added, *all their days* We indeed know that the
Nazarites were forbidden to drink wine, but it was only for a time,
until they had performed their vow; we also know, that when the priest
was discharging his duty, he was not allowed, for that time, to take
wine. But afterwards the priests as well as the Nazarites, resumed their
common mode of living. But to taste no wine throughout life was a thing
far more difficult. The Prophet, no doubt, detailed these particulars,
that he might load the Jews with greater disgrace, who, in a matter the
most just, and by no means hard, were not, as we shall see, obedient to
God. They said, *We, our wives, our sons, our daughters,* as though they
had said, “This precept has ever been observed in our family; and what
has been delivered to us, by our fathers, we have followed to this day,
as also our fathers, who obeyed the command of a dead man, because his
will had been explained to them.”

<span id="vii.iv-p13"></span><span id="vii.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p14"></span>They added, that they were *not to build
houses,* literally, to inhabit them, that is, to dwell in them. It was
then lawful for the Rechabites to construct houses, that is, to build
them for others; but they were to be contented with tents, and to live
in them. They might then assist others in building splendid palaces, and
thus by their labor gain a livelihood; but they were not allowed to
inhabit them, as this was one of their precepts. They farther added,
*And a vineyard and a field and a seed we have not* If we duly consider
how hard was their condition, we shall see reason to commend the
constancy of the Rechabites, for they were not frightened from their
purpose when they saw that they were brought into miserable straits.
But, however, we ought especially to attend to the object the Prophet
had in view, even to shew how shameful was the perverseness of the Jews,
who dared to despise and regard as nothing the precepts of God, when yet
the authority of a mortal man, and one that was dead, was so great with
his posterity. They then said, that they *dwelt in tents, and did
according to all the things which Jonadab their father had commanded
them* It follows —

<span id="vii.v"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p1"></span><span id="vii.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
35:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#011.md)<span id="vii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p2"></span>**11**. But it came to pass, when
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said,
Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans,
and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.

<span id="vii.v-p3"></span>**11**. Et factum est cum ascendit
Nebuchadnezer rex Babylonis in terram, tunc diximus, Venite, ingrediamur
Jerusalem a facie excreitus Chaldaeorum, eta facie excreitus Assyriorum
*(alii vertunt,* Syriae, *sed* <span id="vii.v-p3.1"></span>ארם *quamvis
aliquando restringatur ad Syriae, comprehendit tamem Mesopotamiam et
alias regiones)* et habitavimus Jerusalem.

<span id="vii.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.v-p5"></span><span id="vii.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p6"></span>It hence appears that it proved advantageous
to the Rechabites to observe what their father had commanded them: for
had they been fixed to their possessions, they must have been driven
into exile with the rest when the kingdom of Israel was destroyed; what
happened to the ten tribes nmst have happened to the Rechabites. But as
they had nothing as their own, they were freer to move elsewhere; nor
had they the trial of leaving possessions, for they had none. We know
that many are so tied to their own houses, fields, vineyards, and
meadows, that they would rather be killed a hundred times than to be
torn away from them. Then Jenadab consulted well the benefit of his
posterity, when he ordered them to dwell in tents; for thus they could
collect together in one day all that they had, according to the known
saying of Bias. Hence poverty was a great advantage to them: their
austerity of life was also a benefit to them; they could without
difficulty dwell at Jerusalem, for they had no need of many luxuries.
Had they been accustomed to wine and to other delicacies, they might
have discussed the point, whether it would have been better for them at
once to die than to suffer want in a besieged city. Moreover, as they
had lived frugally and had also been accustomed to an austere life, no
anxiety prevented them to come with confidence to Jerusalem; for they
thought that they could gain a sparing and sordid subsistence by their
own labor.

<span id="vii.v-p7"></span>It hence then appears what Jenadab had in
view, when he forbade his posterity the use of wine as well as the
possession of fields and vineyards; for he could then foresee what
dreadful revolutions were at hand. It was therefore his purpose thus to
train up his posterity, that when difficulties came they might not
succumb under the burden, but patiently bear want or any other
inconvenience, which to others would be intolerable, whenever their
former delicacies came to mind. *We they said, Come, and let us enter
into Jerusalem from the face* of both armies. When therefore the
Israelites were detained by their fields and domestic possessions, the
Rechabites went to Jerusalem, and thus were freed from danger. It now
follows, —

<span id="vii.vi"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p1"></span><span id="vii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
35:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#012.md)<span id="vii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p2"></span>**12**. Then came the word of the LORD unto
Jeremiah, saying,

<span id="vii.vi-p3"></span>**12**. Et fuit serum Jehovae ad Jeremiam,
dicendo,

<span id="vii.vi-p4"></span>**13**. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the
God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith
the LORD.

<span id="vii.vi-p5"></span>**13**. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus

disciplinam (vel, correctionum) ad obediendum sermonibus meis, dicit
Jehova?

<span id="vii.vi-p6"></span>**14**. The words of Jonadab the son of
Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for
unto this day they drink none, but obey their father’s commandment:
notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but
ye hearkened not unto me.

<span id="vii.vi-p7"></span>**14**, Stabiliti sunt sermones Jonadab
filii Rechab, quos mandavit filiis suis, ne biberent vinum, et non
biberunt usque ad hunc diem; quia obedierunt mandato patris sui; ego

loquendo, et non obtemperastis mihi:

<span id="vii.vi-p8"></span>**15**. I have sent also unto you all my
servants the prophets, rising up early and sending *them*, saying,
Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go
not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which
I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your
ear, nor hearkened unto me.

<span id="vii.vi-p9"></span>**15**. Et misi ad vos omnes servos meos
Prophetas, mane surgendo et mitttendo (mane surgens et mittens) dicendo,

vestras, et ne ambuletis post deos alienos ad serviendum ipsis (ut
serviatis ipsis) et habitabitis in terra quam dedi vobis et patribus
vestris, et non inclinastis aurem vestram, et non obedivistis mihi.

<span id="vii.vi-p10"></span> 

<span id="vii.vi-p11"></span><span id="vii.vi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p12"></span>Here Jeremiah applies the example which he
had related; for subjoined is God’s complaint, — that he was less
regarded by his people than Jonadab was by his posterity. He then says,
*Go and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants ofJerusalem*
To make the reproof the more effectual, the Prophet introduces God as
the speaker. It was therefore God’s purpose to convey the reproof to the
Jews in his own name, and as it were in his own person. *Will ye not
receive instruction,* he says, *so as to obey me?* The word <span
id="vii.vi-p12.1"></span>מוסר *musar,* means sometimes ruling or
governing, and sometimes correction. But God here no doubt reprehends
that madness of the Jews in which they had long hardened themselves, as
though he had said, “You never think it right to return to a sound
mind.” Since, then, they had been for a long time incorrigible and
wandered after their own lusts like unbridled wild beasts, a reproof is
here given, as though he had said, “Will this people be always
ungovernably wanton so as never to submit to the yoke?” And he says, *so
as to obey me* God shews that he required nothing unjust from the Jews,
so that a true excuse could be pretended, as though he was too rigid: “I
require only,” he says, “that ye obey me: this is all my severity, for
lovely is the rule of meekness which I use towards you. Since, then, I
demand nothing but what children ought willingly to render to their
fathers without being admonished, how is it that this mederation is so
displeasing to you, and can by no means be approved by you?”

<span id="vii.vi-p13"></span><span id="vii.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p14"></span>It is then added, *confirmed have been the
words of Jonadab* by his children; but my people do not obey me. But as
we have said in the last lecture, the Prophet touches particularly on
this circumstance, — that the Rechabites obeyed the command of their
father in not drinking wine: this was hard; they did *not drink even to
that day* But what did God require from his children? only to receive
his Law, and not to go astray, as it is here added, after alien gods.
There is, then, a contrast between the hard precept of Jonadab and the
equity of the Law; for God required nothing from his people *except* to
render him pure worship, he says, *They have drunk no wine to this* day
— and why? because they *obeyed;* that is, there was no scruple of
*conscience* to prevent them, but the authority of a man who was dead so
far prevailed witIt them, that they willingly gave up the use of wine.
“As then simple obedience, that is, piety or respect for their father,
produced such influence on the Rechabites, how is it that I am not
heard? for *I have spoken,”* he says, “so that the sin of the people is
not excusable on the ground of ignorance.”

<span id="vii.vi-p15"></span>Then he adds, *Early rising and speaking*
Here assiduity and diligence are mentioned. Jonadab only once gave his
command to his children; that command, which might have been forgotten,
remained perpetually in the hearts of his sons, so that they taught the
same to his grandsons. But God commanded what was right not only once,
but *rose up early,* that is, he sedulously anticipated them; for by
this metaphor he intimates that he did not wait until after a continued
licentiousness they became more addicted to their vices; for we know
that those who have for many years been without restraint, are not
easily brought into order, but they become habitually refractory. And
hence, also, it comes to be necessary to form those from infancy who are
to be ruled by us; for if they be allowed to act as they please, their
wantonness cannot afterwards be restrained by any laws. God then says,
that he *rose up early,* that is, that he anticipated the Jews, so that
together with their milk they might imbibe religion.

<span id="vii.vi-p16"></span><span id="vii.vi-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p17"></span>He afterwards adds, that he was assiduous
in teaching them, *rising early and speaking* By *speaking,* he
intimates that he had daily repeated the same things, so that
forgetfulness might not be pleaded by the Jews as an excuse: *I have
spoken to you, rising up early and speaking, and ye obeyed me not* Then
follows an explanation,wthat God had sent the Prophets: the Jews would
have otherwise been ready to object and say, that God had never appeared
to them. Hence he says, that he had spoken to them by his Prophets. *I
have sent,* he says, and indeed many — *I have sent all my servants,*
etc.; for if Moses only had commanded the Jews what was right, they
might have pretended that the Law was buried and forgotten, and that
they had no recollection of what Moses had taught. Hence to meet such
evasions, he says shortly, that he had *sent all his servants,* that is,
that he had sent many Prophets, and so many, that he continually
proclaimed in their hearing the doctrine of the Law. He again repeats
the words, *rising early and sending,* so that he never ceased to warn
and exhort them. Now they who are otherwise tardy and also refractory,
yet become gentle when they are recalled to their duty every day and
hour. Since God then thus urged them by his Prophets, their mad
obstinacy became more evident when they still refused to obey.

<span id="vii.vi-p18"></span>Now follows that easy requirement, which
still more aggravated their sin, *Turn ye now, every one from his evil
way, and make right your doings,* (literally, *make good)* Here God
shews the difference between his Law and the precepts of Jonadab; for he
simply required of the Jews what they ought willingly to have done; for
had no Law been written, natural light was sufficient to teach the Jews
that it was their duty to obey God; for the law of obedience is so
written on our hearts, as a testimony, that no one can justly plead
ignorance as an excuse. God then here declares that he required nothing
but what nature itself dictated, even that the Jews should repent and
form their life according to the rule of obedience; though no Prophet
were among them, yet every one ought to have been in this respect his
own teacher.

<span id="vii.vi-p19"></span>It follows, *And walk not after alien gods
to serve them* This admonition still more clearly proves how moderate
was what God required; for he souhlt nothing more than to retain the
Jews under his authority and protection, that he might be a Father to
them. Jonadab might have demanded obedience from his posterity, and yet
have allowed them the free use of wine, and also the possession of
fields and vineyards; but he wished to cut them off as it were from
mankind, so that their condition became worse than that of all the
nations and people among whom they dwelt; for they became, no doubt,
objects of ridicule to their neighbors, endured many reproaches, and
were grievously harassed. God shews that he had abstained from
exercising rigid authority, and from requiring unbearable servitude, and
demanded nothing from his people, but that he might be acknowledged by
them as a Father. As, then, he did not tyrannically force the Jews to
render him service, and his Law was moderate in its demands, it hence
appears still more clear, as I have said, how incorrigible was the
wickedness and depravity of that people.

<span id="vii.vi-p20"></span>He further adds a promise, which ought by
its sweetness to have allured them, so as to become more disposed and
prompt to obey. Though he might by authority have commanded, “Turn ye
from your superstitions, and faithfully serve me,” it would yet have
been a command just and equitable; but when he is pleased to add a
promise, which ought to have disposed the Jews to obedience, and yet
gains nothing from them, their wickedness is rendered again by this
circumstance still more detestable. We hence see that there is something
important in every clause, and that it is not without meaning that he
here adds, *Ye shall dwell in the land which I gave to you and to your
fathers* God here sets forfth his own bounty, and then promises a
perpetual fruition of it, provided the Jews obeyed. He says that he gave
that land to them, and before to their fathers, had they never partaken
of God’s bounty, yet the promise alone ought to have induced them to
submit to his authority. But God had been already liberal to them. Then
experience ought to have convinced them, for they knew that they had
obtained the promised land by no other right than by a promise made by
God; they knew that the nations, into whose place they had entered, had
been cast out by God’s mighty hand. As, then, they had by experience
found God to be bountiful, and as he had promised to be in future the
same, how great and how monstrous nmst have been their madness when they
would not turn to obedience? Then it is also a circumstance of weighty
importance, when God reminded them that it was he who gave the land to
them and to their fathers.

<span id="vii.vi-p21"></span>He adds, *Ye have not inclined your ear,
nor obeyed me* We have stated elsewhere the import of these words, “Not
to incline the ear:” they removed the plea of ignorance or of the want
of knowledge. God, then, charges the Jews here with deliberate
wickedness; for they had obstinately rejected the doctrine of the Law,
and all the warnings given by the Prophets; for when doctrine is set
before any people, and God is pleased familiarly to teach them, and
nothing is effected, their perverseness is thus more fully made known.
God then intimates here that the Jews had not gone astray through
ignorance, for they sufficiently understood what was right. Whence,
then, was there so great a hardness? even because they had designedly
closed their ears, that is, they had wickedly denied obedience to God,
and had been refractory, as it were, through a long-cherished
resolution, so that they could never be brought to a sound mind. It
afterwards follows again, —

<span id="vii.vii"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p1"></span><span id="vii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
35:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#016.md)<span id="vii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p2"></span>**16**. Because the sons of Jonadab the son
of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he
commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:

<span id="vii.vii-p3"></span>**16**. Quoniam stabilierunt filii Jonadab,
filii Rechab, mandatum patris sui, qued mandaverat ipsis, populus antera
hic non audierunt ad me, *(hoc est,* non obediverunt mihi)

<span id="vii.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.vii-p5"></span><span id="vii.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p6"></span>The Prophet says nothing new here, but
confirms what has been said before; and this he did, that the indignity
of the people’s conduct might more fully appear, inasmuch as, on one
hand, a mortal man, and he now dead, retained authority over his
posterity, having once laid on them a restraint in a matter hard and
difficult; while God, on the other hand, effected nothing, though he had
constantly addressed and exhorted his people, had sent prophets, and
ceased not to invite them to himself, and had not only invited them, but
also kindly allured them by setting before them his favors, and gave
them hope as to the time to come. Since God, then, had tried all means,
but without any success, the hopeless depravity of the people became
hence evident. This is the import of the whole.

<span id="vii.viii"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vii.viii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast
made known to us by thy servants, not only once, and even often, the way
of salvation, but hast sent also thine only-begotten Son to be to us a
teacher of perfect wisdom, — O grant, that we may so submit to thee and
so consecrate to thee our whole life, that he who died for our salvation
and rose again, may peaceably rule us by the doctrine of his gospel; and
that we may strive to glorify thee in this world, so that we may at last
be made partakers of that celestial glory which the same thy Son our
Lord has obtained for us. — Amen.

<span id="vii.x-p2"></span>**17**. Therefore thus saith the LORD God of
hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all
the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against
them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I
have called unto them, but they have not answered.

<span id="vii.x-p3"></span>**17**. Propterea sic dicit Jehova, Deus
exercituum, Deus Israel, Ecce ego adducam super Jehudah, et super
incolas Jerusalem omne malum quod pronuntiavi contra cos; quia loquutus
sum ad eos, et non audierunt; et vocavi eos et non responderunt.

<span id="vii.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.x-p5"></span><span id="vii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.x-p6"></span>The Prophet, after having shewn that the Jews
were so condemned by the example of the Rechabites, that there was no
defense for them, now adds, — that as the word of God had been to them
useless, it would now be efficacious against them. This is the purport
of the verse.

<span id="vii.x-p7"></span>*I have spoken to them,* says God; I will now
speak to them no more, but I will speak against them, that is, I will
command the Chaldeans, and they shall be my ministers and the
executioners of my vengeance. We hence see the order which the Prophet
has observed: he did not bring forward this final sentence, which is
like a thunderbolt, until he had proved the Jews guilty. For this
purpose was the comparison he made, when he said that the Rechabites had
obeyed their father, and that the Jews had disregarded God’s Law and all
the warnings given by the Prophets. *I will bring,* he says, *upon
Judah, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, all the evil which I have
spoken against them; for I have spoken to them, and they heard not*

<span id="vii.x-p8"></span>Here the Prophet distinguishes between two
sorts of speaking. For God had spoken to the Jews, but he had also
spoken against them. Here are two prepositions, not very unlike, the one
begins with an <span id="vii.x-p8.1"></span>א *aleph,* and the other
with <span id="vii.x-p8.2"></span>ע, *oin.* By the one the Prophet
denotes doctrine, exhortations, and whatever may lead to repentance, so
that men may either be recalled to their duty or retained in it. This,
then, is one mode of speaking, that is, when God addresses us and
invites us to himself. The other mode is that which refers to
threatenings, that is, when God, after having found that he can do
nothing by teaching, has recourse to threatenings, and shews what
vengeance awaits us. This passage, then, is especially worthy of
observation, because we hence learn, that when men reject the word of
teaching, they cannot escape the other word, which denounces the
judgment of God. Teaching appears useless when not received by men; but
whosoever despises his word, will find at last, to his own ruin, that
the denunciations by which God confirms and ratifies the authority of
his word, cannot possibly be made void: *as,* then, *they heard not the
word which I had spoken to them,* come upon them shall all the evils
*which I have pronounced against them*

<span id="vii.x-p9"></span>By adding, *I have called and they answered
not,* he amplifies the atrocity of their sin; for God had not simply
shewn what was necessary for their salvation, but had also called them
to himself, and had even loudly called them; but he spoke to the deaf,
for they answered not. It follows, —

<span id="vii.xi"></span>

<span id="vii.xi-p1"></span><span id="vii.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
35:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer035.htm#018.md)<span id="vii.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xi-p2"></span>**18**. And Jeremiah said unto the house of
the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because
ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his
precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:

<span id="vii.xi-p3"></span>**18**. Domui autem Rechabitarum dixit
Jeremias, sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus Israel, Propterea quod
audistis *(vel,* obedivistis) mandato Jonadab patris vestri, et
servastis omnia ejus mandata, et fecistis secundum omnia quae
praeceperat vobis,

<span id="vii.xi-p4"></span>**19**. Therefore thus saith the LORD of
hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man
to stand before me for ever.

<span id="vii.xi-p5"></span>**19**. Propterea sic dick Jehova
exercituum, Deus Israel, Non excidetur vir ex Jonadab filio Rechab, quin
stet coram facie mea cunctis diebus.

<span id="vii.xi-p6"></span> 

<span id="vii.xi-p7"></span><span id="vii.xi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xi-p8"></span>Here the Prophet, that he might affect the
Jews more deeply, promises a reward to the sons of Jonadab, because they
obeyed their father; and he promises them a blessing from God. Nor is it
to be wondered at, for this commandment, as Paul says, is the first to
which a promise is annexed. (<span id="vii.xi-p8.1"></span>[Eph
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#002)<span id="vii.xi-p8.1"></span>.md) God
promises generally a reward to all who keep the Law, for every command
has in general connected with it the hope of reward; but this is in a
special manner added to the Fifth Commandment: “Honor thy father and thy
mother, that thou mayest prolong thy life,” etc. It is, then, nothing
strange that God promised a reward to the Rechabites, because they
followed the command of their father, for he had promised that in the
Law.

<span id="vii.xi-p9"></span>But what the Papists allege, that the
obedience rendered to the Church is on the same account pleasing to God,
may, as we have said, be easily confuted; for if the Rechabites had
followed the command of their father in a thing unlawfill, they would
have been worthy of punishment; but as this precept, as we have shewn,
was not inconsistent with God’s Law, God approved of their obedience.
But the laws which are made for the purpose of setting up fictitious
modes of worship are altogether impious, for they introduce idolatry.
God has prescribed how he would have us to worship him; whatever,
therefore, men bring in of themselves is wholly impious, for it
adulterates the pure worship of God; and further, when necessity is laid
on consciences, it is, as we have said, a tyrannical bondage. Such was
not the object of Jonadab; for what he commanded his posterity was
useful, and referred only to things of this life; and it did not bind
their consciences; for when it was necessary they moved to Jerusalem and
dwelt as others in houses; for they did not erect tents at Jerusalem,
but lived in hired dwellings; and yet they obeyed their father’s
command, for his purpose in ordering them to dwell in tents, was, that
they might remain unincumbered, so that they might be always ready to
move. We hence see how foolishly the Papists pervert this passage in
order to support their tyrannical laws.

<span id="vii.xi-p10"></span>And thus this truth may stand, that the
obedience of the Rechabites pleased God, because nature itself requires
that children should obey their parents; and we also know that God often
rewards the shadows of virtues in order to shew that virtues themselves
are pleasing to him.  <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) But there is
no doubt but that this promise, as I have before said, was designedly
given, in order to stimulate the Jews, according to what is said in the
Song of Moses,

<span id="vii.xi-p12"></span>“I will provoke them by a foolish nation,
because they have provoked me by those who are no gods; and I will take
vengeance on them, for I will bring forth nations which were not
before.” (<span id="vii.xi-p12.1"></span>[De
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021)<span id="vii.xi-p12.1"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.xi-p13"></span><span id="vii.xi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xi-p14"></span>So then God now, in order to excite and
rouse the Jews, promises to bless the Rechabites, because they had been
obedient to their father, *There shall not be cut off a man from
Jonadab,* that is, from the offspring of Jonadab, *standing* (literally)
*before my face;* but as the conciseness of the verse renders it obscure
and ambiguous, I have introduced an addition, — but that *he may stand
before my face* And he says that they would stand before his face, not
that they were to be priests or Levites, as some of the Rabbins have
said, who have applied this passage to the priesthood, because it is
often said in Scripture both of the Levites and the priests, that they
stood before the face of God. They, therefore, think that the same thing
is meant here when spoken of the Rechabites. But this is a strained
meaning. God simply intimates, that some of Jonadab’s offspring would be
always living, and that through his special favor, that their obedience
might not appear to be without its just reward. This is the meaning. Now
