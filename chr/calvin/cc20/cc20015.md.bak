<span id="xvi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 44

<span id="xvi.i"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p1"></span><span id="xvi.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#001.md)<span id="xvi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p2"></span>**1**. The word that came to Jeremiah
concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at
Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros,
saying,

<span id="xvi.i-p3"></span>**1**. Sermo qui fuit ad Jeremiam ad omnes
Judaeos qui habitabant in terra Aegypti, qui habitabant Magdali et in
Taphneis et Memphi et in terra Pathros, dicendo,

<span id="xvi.i-p4"></span>**2**. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God
of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem,
and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they *are* a
desolation, and no man dwelleth therein;

<span id="xvi.i-p5"></span>**2**. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus
Israel, Vos vidistis omne malum quod adduxi super Jerusalem et super
omnes urbes Jehudah; et ecce sunt (ipsae) vastitas hodie, et nullus in
illis habitans,

<span id="xvi.i-p6"></span>**3**. Because of their wickedness which they
have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn
incense, *and* to serve other gods, whom they knew not, *neither* they,
ye, nor your fathers.

<span id="xvi.i-p7"></span>**3**. Propter malitiam quam perpetrarunt ad
irritandum me ut proficiscerentur ad offerendum suffitum et ad
serviendum diis alienis, quos non cognoverant ipsi, neque vos, neque
patres vestri.

<span id="xvi.i-p8"></span>**4**. Howbeit I sent unto you all my
servants the prophets, rising early and sending *them,* saying, Oh, do
not this abominable thing that I hate.

<span id="xvi.i-p9"></span>**4**. Et misi ad vos omnes servos meos,
Prophetas, mane surgens et mittens, dicendo, Agedum ne feceritis rem
abominationis hujus quam odi:

<span id="xvi.i-p10"></span>**5**. But they hearkened not, nor inclined
their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other
gods.

<span id="xvi.i-p11"></span>**5**. Et non audierunt et non inclinarunt
aurem suam, ut reverterentur a malitia sua, et non offerrent suffitum
diis alienis:

<span id="xvi.i-p12"></span>**6**. Wherefore my fury and mine anger was
poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets
of Jerusalem; and they are wasted *and* desolate, as at this day.

<span id="xvi.i-p13"></span>**6**. Et effusa est excandescentia mea et
iracundia mea, et exarsit in urbibus Jehudah et in compitis Jerusalem,
et fuerunt in vastitatem et in desolationem (*sicuti*) secundum diem
hunc.

<span id="xvi.i-p14"></span>**7**. Therefore now thus saith the LORD,
the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye *this* great
evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and
suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;

<span id="xvi.i-p15"></span>**7**. Et nunc dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus
Israel, Quare vos facitis malum hoc grande contra animas vestras ad
excidendum vobis virum et mulierem et parvulum et lactantem e medio
Jehudah, ut non faciatis residuas vobis reliquias.

<span id="xvi.i-p16"></span> 

<span id="xvi.i-p17"></span><span id="xvi.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p18"></span>Jeremiah had already prophesied against the
Jews, who had taken refuge in Egypt, as though there would be for them
in that rich and almost unassailable land a safe and quiet retreat. But
he now speaks against them for another reason, and denounces on them
something more grievous than before, even because they had not only gone
into Egypt against God’s will, but when they came there they polluted
themselves with all kinds of superstition. God, no doubt, designed, in
due time, to prevent this, when he forbade them to go into Egypt; for he
knew how prone they were to idolatry, and to false and adulterous modes
of worship. He was therefore unwilling that they should dwell in that
land, where they might learn to pervert his worship. And this had
happened, as it appears from the present prophecy. As then they had cast
aside every shame, and given themselves up to the superstitions of the
heathens, the Prophet again testified, that God would take vengeance on
them. But we shall see that he had to do with refractory men; for
without shewing any respect for him, they attacked him with impetuous
fury. The sum of what is said then is, that the Jews who dwelt in Egypt
were unworthy of any pardon, because they had, as it were, designedly
rejected the favor of God, and their obstinacy had become altogether
hopeless. We shall now consider the words:

<span id="xvi.i-p19"></span>*A word* is said to have been *given to
Jeremiah to all the Jews* But God spoke to Jeremiah not in the same way
as to the Jews; for he committed to him the words which he commanded him
to deliver to others. Then the word was directly given to Jeremiah only;
but as Jeremiah was God’s interpreter to the people, the word is said to
be given in common to all, which yet at first, as it has been stated,
was committed to Jeremiah alone. For he did not favor the Jews with such
an honor as to speak to them, but he sent the Prophet as his messenger.
He said then *to the Jews who dwelt in Egypt,* and afterwards he
mentions certain places, first *Migdol,* then *Tahpanhes,* and thirdly,
*Noph.* The first name some have rendered Magdal. That city was not so
much known at the time when Egypt flourished, but it has been mentioned
by heathen writers. Of Tahpanhes we spoke yesterday. Noph has been
called Memphis; and it is generally agreed that what the Hebrews called
Noph was that noble and celebrated city Memphis, which, as they suppose
at this day, is called Cairo, *Le Caire.* He lastly mentions the
*country of Pathros,* which is supposed by some to have been near
Pelusia. But on such a matter as this I bestow no great labor; for even
heathen writers have regarded this as an obscure country, of no
importance. Pathros is elsewhere mentioned as a city, and some think it
to have been Petra of Arabia. But the Prophet no doubt refers here to
the country in which Memphis and other cities were situated, in which
the Jews dwelt.

<span id="xvi.i-p20"></span>But he says these things for this reason,
because a question might have been raised, “As the Jews dwelt in Egypt,
so large was the land, that the Prophet could not have announced the
commands of God to all. This, then, was the reason why he intimates
that. they were not dispersed everywhere throughout Egypt, from one end
to the other, but that they were in one part only, and that they were so
collected that his word might come to all. This, then, was the reason
why he mentioned the places where the Jews sojourned.

<span id="xvi.i-p21"></span><span id="xvi.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p22"></span>He now begins with reproof, because they
were so stupid as not to remember the vengeance which God had executed
on themselves and on the whole nation. They had been left alive for this
end, that they might acknowledge God’s judgment, and thus return to a
right mind. Here, then, the Prophet upbraids them with their
insensibility, that they had profited nothing under the scourges of God.
They commonly say that fools, when they are beaten, become wise. As then
the Jews had not repented, after having been so grievously chastised, it
was a proof of extreme perverseness; for if the remnant had a grain of a
sound mind, they would have been humbled at least by the final
destruction of their nation, and when the city and the temple were
demolished. Since then they followed the same wicked courses, for which
God had inflicted so grievous a punishment, it was evident that they
were wholly irreclaimable and destitute of reason and judgment. This is
the import of all the words of the Prophet which we have read.

<span id="xvi.i-p23"></span>He says first, *Ye have seen what great
evils I brought* on you and the land. “Then ye know that you have justly
suffered all the evils which have happened to you; for ye have not
sinned through want of knowledge, but when I had sedulously warned you
by my Prophets, ye continued ever obstinate; ye have therefore fully
deserved such punishments. Now when God spared you, and wished that a
small number should remain, to preserve as it were a seed, how is it
that these evils which are still as it were before your eyes, are not
remembered by you?” We now then understand the design of the Prophet.

<span id="xvi.i-p24"></span>But it may be well to examine every part;
*Ye have seen,* he says, *all the evil which I have brought* (evil here
means calamity) on *Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah;* and,
behold, they are now *a waste, and no one dwells there.* There is here
an emphatical comparison between Jerusalem and Memphis, between the
cities of Judah and Heliopolis and the whole country of Pathros. If then
God had not. spared the holy city which he had chosen, if he had not
spared the cities of Judah which were under his protection, how foolish
it was for the Jews to think that they would be safe in the cities of
Egypt? By what privilege could these be secure, since the cities of
Judah had been reduced to a waste? We now then perceive why the Prophet
mentioned Jerusalem and the cities of Judah; it was, that he might
expose the stupidity of the Jews, because they thought, themselves safe
in Egypt, a land which God had ever held in abomination.

<span id="xvi.i-p25"></span><span id="xvi.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p26"></span>He afterwards adds, *For the evil which they
did to provoke* me. He refers to the sins by which the Jews had provoked
the wrath of God; for the people whom Jeremiah addressed had relapsed
into those superstitions which had been the cause of their ruin. Had the
Prophet spoken generally and said, that it was strange that the Jews had
forgotten the punishment which had been inflicted by God on the whole
nation, his doctrine would not have been so impressive. But when he now
points out as by the finger how they had procured for themselves such
calamities, he presses and urges them more forcibly to acknowledge their
madness, because they thus continually provoked God, and sinned not
through ignorance, but offended him by the same sins for which yet they
had suffered punishment so grievous and dreadful. This is the reason why
the Prophet says, *For the evil which they did to provoke me,* even *to
go,* he says, *to offer incense and to serve alien gods.* To go here
intimates the care and diligence they *exercised* in false worship. God
had shewn to the Jews a certain way in his Law which they ought to have
followed: had they then continued in the doctrine of the Law, they would
have kept in the right way, and gone forward to the right end. But they
are said to go, because they disregarded the Law and went here and
there, as those who wander at random, and know not where they are going.
There is then to be understood a contrast between *going* and remaining
under the teaching of the Law. To go, in short, is to weary one’s self
by an erratic course, when the word of God is neglected, and the way
which it points out is forsaken. This is one thing.

<span id="xvi.i-p27"></span>Then he adds, *to offer incense and to serve
alien gods. In*cense here is mentioned as a particular thing, then that
which is general is added; for incense, as it is well known, was an
evidence of worship. Then the Prophet under one thing condemns the
idolatry of his own nation. But at length he shews that they were given
to other abominations, that they had devoted themselves to the false
worship of alien gods.

<span id="xvi.i-p28"></span>This passage, and those which are like it,
are entitled to particular notice; for we hence learn that men depart
from God and alienate themselves from the true worship of him, whenever
they mingle with it something of their own, and dream of this and that
according to their own will, the very thing intended, as we have said,
by *going* as used by the Prophet. As soon, then, as men devise for
themselves some new modes of worship, it is the same thing as though
they turned backward or willfully wandered, for they keep not in the
right and legitimate way. We also learn from the second clause that
idolaters in vain adduce pretences to excuse themselves. For if they
transfer to another what peculiarly belongs to God, and what he claims
for himself, it is more than a sufficient proof of idolatry; and
incense, as I have said, was a symbol of divine worship. As then they
offered incense to their idols, they robbed the true God of his own
honor, and chose new gods, and adorned them with the rights of the only
true God.

<span id="xvi.i-p29"></span>In vain, then, and foolishly do the Papists
at this day seek evasions when we object to them and say, that gross
idolatries prevail among them: “*He!* it is not our intention to
transfer the worship which peculiarly belongs to the only true God to
saints, to images; but we apply all this to God.” Since they burn
incense to saints, images, and pictures, since they offer incense even
to the dead, there is surely no further need of disputing the point; and
when they try to evade whatever they can bring forward, it is confuted
by this one expression of the Prophet, for when he speaks of incense, he
condemns the Jews for their idolatry.

<span id="xvi.i-p30"></span>But as I have said, he speaks afterwards
generally, and says, *and to serve alien gods.* Then it follows, *whom
they knew not, neither ye nor your fathers* Here the Prophet amplifies
the sin of his own nation, because they had devoted their attention to
unknown gods. There is here again a contrast to be understood, that is,
between God, who had revealed himself by his Law, by his Prophets, by so
many miracles and blessings, and the fictitious gods, who had, without
thought and without judgment, been invented and contrived by the Jews.
Now, it was an evidence of a base and an intolerable ingratitude, that
the Jews should have forsaken the true God after he had made himself
known to them. For had the Law never been given, had God suffered them,
as other nations, to be entangled in their own errors, their offense
would have been lighter. But God had made himself to be so familiarly
known to them, that he was pleased to give them his Law, to be a certain
rule of religion; he had also exercised his miraculous powers among
them. As, then, the knowledge of the true God had been made so
remarkably clear to them, how great and how base was their ingratitude
to reject him and to depart from him, in order to run after idols! when
they contrived for themselves vain gods and nothing but fictions! Had
any one inquired what sort of god was Baal, or what were their Baalim,
they would have said, that they had Baalim as their patrons, who
obtained favor for them with the supreme God. But whence had they
derived their vain notion? It was nothing but superstition founded on no
reason.

<span id="xvi.i-p31"></span>This ought to be carefully observed; for at
this day were any one to ask the Papists by what right they have devised
for themselves so various and so many modes of worship: devotion alone
they say will suffice, or a good intention. Let us then know that
religion, separated from knowledge, is nothing but the sport and
delusion of Satan. It is hence necessary that men should with certainty
know what god they worship. And Christ thus distinguishes the true
worship of God from that of vain idols,

<span id="xvi.i-p32"></span>“We know,” he says, speaking of the Jews,
“whom we worship.” (<span id="xvi.i-p32.1"></span>[Joh
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022)<span id="xvi.i-p32.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xvi.i-p33"></span>He then says that the *Jews* knew, even
those who worshipped God according to what the Law prescribes, — he says
that they knew whom they worshipped. He then condemns all good
intentions in which the superstitious delight themselves, for they know
not whom they worship. And I have said that religion ought not to be
separated from knowledge; but I call that knowledge, not what is innate
in man, or what is by diligence acquired, but that which is delivered to
us by the Law and *the* Prophets.

<span id="xvi.i-p34"></span>We now, then, understand why the Prophet
says that the Jews devoted themselves to alien gods, whom *they had not
known,* nor their fathers.

<span id="xvi.i-p35"></span><span id="xvi.i-p35.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p36"></span>Now follows a circumstance by which their
impiety was still further enhanced, that God had *sent* them Prophets
who stretched forth their hands to them to draw them from their errors.
For had they never been warned, their condemnation would have been just;
for God had once shewn to them by his Law what was right. The teaching,
then, of the Law ought to have been sufficient for all ages. But when
God had never *ceased to* send Prophets, one after another, it was a
sign of hopeless obstinacy to reject so many and so constant warnings.
God then added this circumstance that it might appear that the Jews were
wholly inexcusable, and worthy of a hundred and of a thousand deaths,
because they had so perversely despised all the means of salvation.

<span id="xvi.i-p37"></span>But God says, that he had *sent to them all
his servants* What is universal has its own peculiar importance; for if
one or two Prophets had been sent, the Jews would have been proved
guilty; for the law does not require more than two or three witnesses to
condemn those who have done wrong. (<span id="xvi.i-p37.1"></span>[De
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#006)<span id="xvi.i-p37.1"></span>..md)
But God shews here that there had been a vast number of those, through
whom, had they been believed, the Jews might have been preserved in
safety. They might, then, have been proved guilty, not only by three or
four witnesses, but even by a great number; for the Prophets had
continually succeeded one another. And thus had been fulfilled what God
had promised in the Law,

<span id="xvi.i-p38"></span>“A Prophet will I raise up from the midst of
thy brethren, him shalt thou hear; and every one who will not hear that
Prophet shall be cut off from his people.” (<span
id="xvi.i-p38.1"></span>[Deut. 18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#019)<span id="xvi.i-p38.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xvi.i-p39"></span>For God shews in his proclaimed Law, that
this would be one of his chief blessings, ever to keep the Jews in the
knowledge of their duty, by never leaving them destitute of Prophets and
faithful teachers, here then he shews that he had ever really performed
what he had promised by Moses; for he does not say that he had only sent
a few, but, as I have said, that there had been a copious abundance; for
in every age there were several Prophets, and some, when it became
necessary, succeeded others. But what had been the fruit? He afterwards
complains that all the Prophets had been rejected.

<span id="xvi.i-p40"></span>But to render their sin still more heinous,
he says, *rising up early and sending* Of this kind of speaking an
explanation has been elsewhere given. (<span
id="xvi.i-p40.1"></span>[Jer 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p40.1"></span>; <span id="xvi.i-p40.2"></span>[Jer
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#007)<span id="xvi.i-p40.2"></span>.md) It
is a metaphorical language; for God rises not nor does he change places;
but here he applies to himself what peculiarly belongs to men. For he
who is attentive to business, does not wait till the sun rises, but
anticipates the morning dawn. So also the Prophet says, that God had
been vigilant, for he had been solicitous concerning the wellbeing of
the people.

<span id="xvi.i-p41"></span>We further learn from this mode of speaking
how invaluable is the benefit which God bestows when he raises up honest
and faithful teachers; for it is the same as when the head of a family
rises early from his bed, calls up his children, and takes care of them.
Let us, then, know that teaching, when it is communicated to us, is an
evidence of God’s paternal solicitude, because he would not have us to
perish, but comes down to us and sees what is needful, as though he were
present with us, and as a father towards his children, he takes care of
us and of our affairs. This is the meaning.

<span id="xvi.i-p42"></span>He now adds the substance of his message,
*Do not the thing of this abomination which I hate* God intimates, in
short, that it had not been through him that the Jews did not return
from their errors to the right way, because he had stretched forth his
hand to them, and had, as it were, sup-pliantly requested them to
provide better for themselves, and not knowingly and willfully to seek
their own destruction, having acted as though he were a husband, who,
being anxious to preserve the fidelity of his wife, might thus say to
*her,* — *“Behold,* thou knowest that I cannot endure unchaste-ness;
beware, then, lest thou shouldest prostitute thyself to adulterers.” So
God shews here that he had testified by all his servants, that all kinds
of idolatry were displeasing to him, in order that the Jews might keep
themselves from idolatry.

<span id="xvi.i-p43"></span><span id="xvi.i-p43.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p44"></span>And he adds, *But they hearkened not, nor
inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to
alien gods* Here God charges the Jews with irreclaimable obstinacy, for
the teaching of the Law did not retain them in obedience, nor did they
attend to it, though often and at different times warned and admonished
by the Prophets. And their perverseness he still more clearly sets forth
by the second clause, when he says that they did *not incline their ear*
Had he said, “They have not *hearkened*,” it would have been quite
sufficient; but when he adds, “They have not inclined their ear,” he
expresses, as I have said, something worse than contempt, even that they
designedly rejected the teaching of the Prophets, that they disdained to
hear the Prophets or to listen to their admonitions, but became
willingly deaf, nay, closed up their ears, as rebels do, who are said
elsewhere to harden their heart. We now then understand the import of
this verse.

<span id="xvi.i-p45"></span><span id="xvi.i-p45.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p46"></span>Now he adds, *On this account has my wrath
and my fury been poured forth, and has burned through the cities of
Judah, and through the streets of Jerusalem; and this day they are a
waste and a desolation* The word <span id="xvi.i-p46.1"></span>שממה,
*shimme,* sometimes means amazement, as it has been before stated; but
when it is connected with <span id="xvi.i-p46.2"></span>חרבה, *cherebe,*
as here, it means desolation. *As at this day; a* dreadful waste was
then at that time apparent, he again refers to this truth, that the Jews
ought to have been so touched by that remarkable and memorable instance
of God’s displeasure, as not to abandon themselves afterwards to new
idolatries; they ought to have remembered so recent an example of
punishment. As, then, they still persevered in their hardness, it was an
evidence of extreme impiety. The Prophet says that the perverseness of
the Jews had not been unpunished, for God’s wrath had been poured forth
against the cities of Judah, nay, against Jerusalem itself, the
sanctuary of God, so that all things had been reduced to desolation. The
Jews then ought, on the one hand, seriously to have considered how
inexcusable had been their impiety in having so perversely despised God;
and then they ought on the other hand, to have entertained fear and
dread, since they saw that God had taken such vengeance on those who had
despised his teaching and violated his worship.

<span id="xvi.i-p47"></span><span id="xvi.i-p47.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p48"></span>He then adds, *Why then do ye now this great
evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child
and suckling,* from the midst of Judah, *that nothing may remain for
you? he*re at length the passage is finished; for what we have hitherto
read would have kept the reader in suspense, had not this been added. He
then says, “Since the sin of your fathers ought to have been detested by
you, and since God’s judgment had been dreadful, and that punishment
ought at this day to fill, you with fear, *how is it,* that ye seek to
bring on yourselves again the vengeance of God?” *Why then,* he says,
*now,* etc. This *now* is emphatical, that is, after so many and so
remarkable examples, after so many admonitions, after the most grievous
punishment inflicted on the obstinate. He says, *against your own
souls;* and by this he touched them very sharply, reminding them that
what they were doing would be to their ruin, as though he had said, that
God would receive no loss from their wickedness, but that they would
become the authors of their own destruction, he indeed intimates, as I
have already said, that their impiety would not be without its
punishment; but he shews at the same time that God could, if he thought
proper, look down with indifference on their impieties; for he would
remain perfect even if they were the worst. For when God is robbed by
men of his just and legitimate worship, there is nothing taken away from
his greatness; for he ever remains the same, and is neither advanced nor
diminished through the will of men. Then the Prophet shews that the Jews
were acting madly for their own ruin, when he says, that they did evil
*against their own souls*

<span id="xvi.i-p49"></span>And this he explains more fully by adding,
*To cut off man and woman, child and suckling, from the midst of Judah*
He intimates that God still manifested his mercy, while there was any
remnant. They might have remained in Judea, even in their own
inheritance; and the country might have been inhabited till the time of
seventy years had elapsed, which God had fixed for the exile. Now the
Prophet shews that they fought as it were against the goodness of God,
for they sought to extinguish their own name, so that nothing should
remain of that people, to whom God had still left some seed, that they
might not wholly perish.

<span id="xvi.ii"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xvi.ii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou ceasest
not continually to shew to us thy paternal love and care, — O grant,
that we may not be so insensible as to turn a deaf ear to thy teaching
and admonitions; but as thou watchest for our safety, may the constancy
of our faith and obedience so respond to thee, that we may reverently
receive thy word, suffer ourselves to be ruled by it, and follow the way
which thou hast set before us, until we shall attain complete salvation,
and enjoy that blessed inheritance which has been prepared for us in
heaven by Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xvi.iii"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Sixty-First

<span id="xvi.iv"></span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p1"></span><span id="xvi.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#008.md)<span id="xvi.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p2"></span>**8**. In that ye provoke me unto wrath with
the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of
Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off,
and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the
earth?

<span id="xvi.iv-p3"></span>**8**. Ad provocandum me in operibus manuum
vestrarum, ad offerendum suffitum diis alienis in terra Aegypti, ad quam
vos profecti estis, ut habitetis illic, ut excidium paretis vobis
(*vel,* ut excidatis vos,) et ut sitis in maledictum et probrum inter
cunctas gentes terrae.

<span id="xvi.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.iv-p5"></span><span id="xvi.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p6"></span>I was in the last Lecture obliged to cut
short the subject of the Prophet; for this verse depends on the
foregoing, and is to be read together with it. The Prophet asked why the
Jew’s willingly cut off from themselves every hope of safety, and were
seeking their own ruin. He now expresses the matter more fully, even
that they were provoking God’s wrath by their superstitions. He then
points out the cause of all evils, — the pollution of God’s true worship
by idolatries.

<span id="xvi.iv-p7"></span>We here see that there is no end of sinning,
when men despise God and allow themselves every license in doing evil:
God was unwilling that the Jews should go to Egypt; for he had promised
to cherish them as it were under his own wings; and thus he intended to
shew them mercy, so that they might remain in safety, though in a
country then miserable and desolate. But against his command they went
into Egypt. When they came there, in order to gain favor with the
Egyptians, they polluted themselves with vain superstitions. They might
in the land of Judah have worshipped God in purity without any danger.
Distrusting the favor of God they fled into Egypt; and the fear of men
led them to deny their religion. We hence see how one evil proceeds from
another; when the Jews coveted the favor of that heathen nation, they
polluted themselves with many ungodly superstitions.

<span id="xvi.iv-p8"></span>This is the sin which the Prophet now refers
to, — *To provoke me,* he says, *by the works of your hands* There is
here to be understood a contrast between the works which God had
commanded, and those which men had devised for themselves. The altar and
the whole Temple were indeed works done by the hand and art of men; but
as God had commanded the altar to be made and the Temple to be built,
the Temple was not, properly speaking, a human but a divine work, it
having been commanded. But whatever men devise of themselves for the
purpose of worshipping God, is what is called the work of their hands;
for they invent things themselves, and follow only their own fancies;
they attend not to what pleases God, but give *license* to their own
imaginations, so that according to their own will they mingle together
any sort of worship they please. This, then, is the reason, and
according to this sense it is, that the Prophet says, that the *Jews*
provoked God by *the works* of their *hands*: they corrupted his lawful
worship and *departed* from true religion, when they attached themselves
to heathen Actions and corruptions.

<span id="xvi.iv-p9"></span>He then adds, *To offer incense to alien
gods* Under one particular thing, as it has been already said, the
Prophet includes what is general, for the Jews did not only sin by
offering incense, but also through various other superstitions. But by
stating a part for the whole, he clearly intimates that they denied the
true God when they worshipped idols. And then he adds, *in the land of
Egypt, into which ye have entered, that ye might dwell there.* he takes
away the excuse which they might have made, that they were constrained
by fear, because they were unhappy exiles, and saw that their own
religion would not be tolerated by that proud nation. The Prophet says
that they had *come* into Egypt when God commanded them to remain in the
land of Judah. That plea, then, could not have been admitted, that being
terrified by danger they sought to please the Egyptians, for they
brought themselves into that bondage, when they might have been at
liberty in the land of Judah to worship God in purity. This is the
reason why he says that they *came into Egypt* to sojourn there.

<span id="xvi.iv-p10"></span>He at length adds, *to cut you off.* The
construction is indeed different, but the meaning is clear. He
intimates, in short, as he said in the last verse, that they willingly,
and as it were designedly, rushed headlong into their own ruin. He then
adds, *and ye shall be a curse and a reproach among all nations* By
which words he means that their destruction would be memorable; and this
was harder than if their memory was buried with their life. But the
Prophet says that their death would be such an example as that they
would be deemed *execrable* by all. In short, he *declares* that they
would be exposed to all kinds of reproaches even after their death. It
follows, —

<span id="xvi.v"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p1"></span><span id="xvi.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#009.md)<span id="xvi.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p2"></span>**9**. Have ye forgotten the wickedness of
your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the
wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness
of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in
the streets of Jerusalem?

<span id="xvi.v-p3"></span>**9**. An obliti estis malorum patrum

<span id="xvi.v-p4"></span>**10.** They are not humbled *even* unto this
day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes,
that I set before you and before your fathers.

<span id="xvi.v-p5"></span>**10.** Et non humiliati sunt (*vel,*
attriti) usque ad hunc diem, et non timuerunt, et non ambulaverunt in
lege mea et in statutis meis, quae posueram coram facie vestra, et coram
facie patrum vestrorum.

<span id="xvi.v-p6"></span> 

<span id="xvi.v-p7"></span><span id="xvi.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p8"></span>The Prophet now sets forth how extremely
shameful was the insensibility of the Jews, in not acknowledging that
God had most severely and grievously punished the superstitions to which
they had previously been addicted. At the same time, if we regard the
word used, he seems not to understand punishments by *evils,* but
raffler the wicked deeds by which they had provoked God. And this ought
to be observed, for some interpreters give this rendering, “Have you
forgotten your evils and those of your fathers;*”* that is, how severely
God had afflicted you? But there is no doubt but that the Prophet means
by <span id="xvi.v-p8.1"></span>רעות, *rout,* their sins, by which they
had exposed themselves to God’s judgment; for it immediately follows,
*which they did,* or committed, *in the land of Judah, and in the
streets of Jerusalem* But though he means by this word the sins of the
people, there is yet no doubt but that he includes also the punishments
by which they ought to have known that the impiety in which they
continued most obstinately had displeased God.

<span id="xvi.v-p9"></span>When therefore the Prophet says, *Have ye
forgotten* your evils and those of your fathers? he takes it for granted
that it was sufficiently known that God had taken vengeance on them for
their sins; for he does not address the Jews in their prosperity, but
when they were fugitives from their own land and under the curse of
heaven. As, then, they were evidently condemned by God, the Prophet
justly asks them, “Have ye forgotten that you have been condemned for
the sins of your fathers and those of your kings, even for those which
they had committed?” This he asked, because it was a horrid stupidity,
that though the *city* had been overthrown and the temple burnt, they
did not yet leave off their superstitions, especially when so singular a
vengeance of God ought to have retained their posterity in fear and
obedience even for ten ages. Thus we see that punishment is linked with
sins.

<span id="xvi.v-p10"></span>He says, *of the kings of Judah and of their
wives* The relative is singular, “his wives;*”* but no doubt it refers
to the people. Some read, “of every one of them;*”* but there is no
need, it being a singular number, referring to a collective noun, Judah.
he afterwards adds, *which they did* This ought not to be confined to
the women, (nor is it suitable,) but it refers to all the Jews as well
as to kings of Judah, and also to the women, — *which* then *they did*
*in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem*

<span id="xvi.v-p11"></span>When he mentions *the streets of Jerusalem,*
he exaggerates their wickedness. For we know that city to have been as
it were the earthly sanctuary of God. It, was then a most disgraceful
impiety to pollute that place which God had consecrated for himself. The
whole land of Judah was indeed under his authority and power, but he had
favored the city, and especially Mount Sion, with singular privileges.
Then the Prophet amplifies the greatness of their sin, when he says that
Jerusalem had been polluted by their superstitions.

<span id="xvi.v-p12"></span><span id="xvi.v-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p13"></span>He afterwards mentions how great had been
the perverseness of that people, *They are not humbled,* he says, *to
this day,* though they had been most severely smitten by the rods of
God. Even fools, when smitten, become wise, as the old proverb says. As
the Jews then had been so grievously chastised by God’s hand, and had
experienced extreme rigor, ought they not to have considered what they
had deserved? But the Prophet shews that their wickedness was past
remedy, for though broken down they were not yet humbled, like those who
are of a perverse disposition, who could not be reformed were they
broken down a hundred times. Then the Prophet upbraids the Jews with
their obstinacy, for not even the greatest calamity had brought them to
obedience.

<span id="xvi.v-p14"></span>*They were not* then *humbled to that day*,
*nor did they fear* Fear ought also to be referred here to the
calamities which *they* had *experienced,* for God had sufficiently
shewn that he had been grievously offended with their impiety. As then
God’s dreadful judgment had been made conspicuous to all, the Prophet
here condemns their dullness, *because* they had not been brought back
to a sound mind so as to fear God. He now adds another instance of
obstinacy, that they had not *walked* in the Law of God and in his
commandments. Then he shows that their obstinacy was twofold, that they
had profited nothing by his teaching, and that they had disregarded his
punishments. The Law itself was to them a rule according to which they
were to worship God, nor ought they to have sought elsewhere what they
were to do. As, then, they had in the Law a revelation as to true
religion, it was an intolerable contempt to depart from it of their own
accord, and to abandon themselves to all kinds of errors. But the
Prophet shews that they had been extremely unteachable, because they had
not only cast aside every regard for the Law, but they had also despised
God’s hand, and refused to be corrected by any punishments.

<span id="xvi.v-p15"></span>That he might shew still further that they
had sinned through sheer wickedness, he says, They have not walked in my
Law *nor in my statutes* This second clause seems to be superfluous; but
the Prophet here commends the clear teaching of the Law, as though God
had said that he had not only shewn in a brief manner what was true and
right, but that he had also by many statutes taught the Jews, so that
they had no pretext for their ignorance. And he confirms the same thing
in other words, when he says that he had *put* these statutes *before
their face;* for by these words he intimates that there is nothing
obscure in the Law, and that the Jews therefore had not gone astray
through want of knowledge; for men always extenuate by evasions their
sins, when their impiety is condemned. The Prophet then says that the
Jews were inexcusable, because the rule of true religion had been set
before their eyes.

<span id="xvi.v-p16"></span>Now this passage testifies that the teaching
of the Law is not doubtful, as some profane men say, who hold that
Scripture may be turned anyhow like a nose of wax. But God declares that
he had not spoken ambiguously. Since, then, the Prophet affirms that the
Law had been set before the eyes of the Jews, that they might surely
know the will of God, we ought to maintain at this day, that in the
Gospel, clearly discovered to us by the coming of Christ, there is
nothing obscure, but that the treasures of all knowledge have been made
known to us, as far as it is necessary, so that they who now go astray
in vain pretend that they do so because the will of God is hid from
them; for in no other way can they err than by dissembling and willfully
closing their eyes, lest the brightness of the sun should reach them.
Let us yet know that the more plainly God is made known to us, the more
grievously we sin when we turn aside from his true worship and service;
for he has omitted nothing in his word which is necessary in order to
worship him acceptably. Since, then, we have before our eyes the rule of
a godly life, except we follow it this reproof belongs to us, that God
has set before our eyes his statutes. It now follows, —

<span id="xvi.vi"></span>

<span id="xvi.vi-p1"></span><span id="xvi.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#011.md)<span id="xvi.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vi-p2"></span>**11.** Therefore thus saith the LORD of
hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for

<span id="xvi.vi-p3"></span>**11.** Propterea sic dicit Jehova

<span id="xvi.vi-p4"></span>**12.** And I will take the remnant of
Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn
there, and they shall all be consumed, *and* fall in the land of Egypt;
they shall *even* be consumed by the sword *and* by the famine: they
shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by
the famine: and they shall be an execration, *and* an astonishment, and
a curse, and a reproach.

<span id="xvi.vi-p5"></span>**12.** Et tollam reliquias Jehudah, quae

erunt in execrationem et stuporem et in maledictum et in opprobrium.

<span id="xvi.vi-p6"></span> 

<span id="xvi.vi-p7"></span><span id="xvi.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vi-p8"></span>He again denounces punishment on the
obstinate; nor is it a wonder that these threatenings were so often
repeated, since he had to do with men so ferocious and refractory. The
reason then why he denounced on them God’s judgment, was because they
boldly derided him; and it will become more evident from what follows
how necessary was such vehemence.

<span id="xvi.vi-p9"></span><span id="xvi.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vi-p10"></span>And first, indeed, the Prophet briefly
shews that all those would perish who had yet falsely imagined that they
could not otherwise be safe than by fleeing into Egypt. Then Jeremiah
here reproves and condemns their false and vain confidence. And then he
explains the manner when he says, *I will take away all the remnant of
Judah, who have set their face to come to Egypt, etc. By* these words
and the following, God intimates that the Jews had in vain sought
hiding-places in Egypt, because there he would inflict on them the
punishment which they had deserved. He names the *sword* and *the
famine;* the third kind he omits here, but he will mention it presently.
Then he says that they were to perish, partly by the sword and partly by
famine, and in order to speak more emphatically, he uses different
words, *They shall be consumed by famine, they shall fall by the sword,
they shall all be consumed,* and then he *says, from the least to the
greatest.*

<span id="xvi.vi-p11"></span>At length he adds, *And they shall be a
curse.* We have said elsewhere that the word <span
id="xvi.vi-p11.1"></span>אלה, *ale,* sometimes means a curse, though it
properly signifies an oath; and the reason is, *because* men in swearing
often introduce a curse, “Let God curse me,” — “Let me perish.” Then he
says, that the *Jews* would become an example of a curse; for in making
an oath this would be the common form, “Let God destroy me as he
destroyed the Jews.” He afterwards adds, *an astonishment,* because all
would be horrified at the very sight of their calamity. It follows in
the last place, *a curse and a reproach,* of which we have spoken
before. *Let* us now proceed, —

<span id="xvi.vii"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#013.md)<span id="xvi.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p2"></span>**13.** For I will punish them that dwell
in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the
famine, and by the pestilence:

<span id="xvi.vii-p3"></span>**13.** Et visitabo super eos qui habitant
in terra Aegypti, quemadmodum visitavi super Jerusalem, in gladio et
fame et peste (*hic exprimitur tertia species.*)

<span id="xvi.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.vii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.vii-p6"></span>He confirms in this verse what he had said
in the last, that he would again take vengeance on impiety, as he had
done previously. The Jews were before visited with a very grievous
calamity, when inebriated with prosperity; but now, when God would have
shaken from off them their torpor, the Prophet justly reminds them of
the calamities which they had suffered: *As,* then, *I visited
Jerusalem, so will I visit those who dwell in Egypt* But the argument is
also from the greater to the less; for if God had not spared the holy
city, in which he had chosen a habitation, how should he spare Egypt?
for Egypt was not worthy that God should regard it. We know that it was
a profane and an accursed land. It was, then, the greatest madness for
the Jews to hope to be safe in Egypt, when they could not have been so
in the holy land, which was God’s sanctuary, which was their heritage,
which was even God’s rest.

<span id="xvi.vii-p7"></span>We now see the object of the Prophet; for
he set before · them the ruin of the city and of the land of Judah, that
they might know that they could not escape the hand of God while they
dwelt in Egypt contrary to his command, for God would be a severer judge
to them there than he had been before in the land of Judah. It follows,
—

<span id="xvi.viii"></span>

<span id="xvi.viii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.viii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014.md)<span id="xvi.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.viii-p2"></span>**14.** So that none of the remnant of
Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall
escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the
which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return
but such as shall escape.

<span id="xvi.viii-p3"></span>**14.** Et non erit qui evadat (qui sit
residuus) inter reliquias Jehudah quae venerunt ad peregrinandum hic
(*nam erat Propheta in Aegypto*) nempe in terra Aegypti, et ad
revertendum in terram Jehudah, ad quam ipsi elevant animam suam (*vel,*
elevant animas suas) ad revertendum ut habitent illic, quia non
revertentur nisi qui evaserint.

<span id="xvi.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.viii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.viii-p6"></span>The Prophet seems to be inconsistent with
himself; for at the beginning of the verse he says that there would be
no residue, but at the end he adds an exception, that there would be few
alive, who would flee, and, by some miracle, escape from death. Some
take this view, that none of the ungodly despisers would remain, but
that some would yet be preserved alive, even those who had been drawn
there against their own will, such as Jeremiah, Baruch, and such as were
like them. But this explanation may seem forced at the first view; and
yet if the Prophet is speaking of the Jews who had fled into Egypt, it
is necessary so to take it; otherwise there would be a manifest
inconsistency and contradiction. But we may also refer what he says at
the end of the verse to the exiles in Babylon; for they who had
concealed themselves in Egypt thought that it was all over with all
others, because they had been led away into a distant country. As, then,
a return to their country was closed up against them, they thought that
they themselves would become the sole heirs of the land; for as Egypt
was not far from the land of Judah, a return was easy, and also free,
because they had made a treaty with the Egyptians; and further, they had
gone to them as friends to partake of their hospitality. They, then, who
dwelt in Egypt thought that the land of Judah would be their own.

<span id="xvi.viii-p7"></span>But God says that none would return into
that land except those who should escape, even those to whom permission
to return would be given at the end of their captivity and exile. I take
then the word <span id="xvi.viii-p7.1"></span>פלטים, p*elethim,* at the
end of the verse, as referring to the remnant which God would at length
gather, when liberty to return was granted to the *Jews* by the edict of
Cyrus, at the end of the seventy years, which the Prophet had before
mentioned. And this seems to me a simpler meaning, that. is, that none
would remain of that remnant which had gone down to Egypt, who *came,*
as it is expressed, *to sojourn in the land of Egypt and to return to
the land of Judah,* for this was their purpose.  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md)

<span id="xvi.viii-p11"></span>He then adds, To *which they lift up
their souls to return there* The Prophet here exposes the *confidence*
by which the Jews still deceived themselves; for the lifting up of which
he speaks, means to aspire or to hope, and denotes pride and
presumption. So by saying that they *lifted up their souls,* he reproves
them, because they were still inflated with a foolish hope, and
persuaded themselves that a return would soon be open for them, as the
land was without any possessors. As, then, they were cherishing
themselves with such delusions, they were to know that they were never
to return there, *They shall not return,* he says. And then follows an
exception, *Except those who escape,* even those of whom the Jews in
Egypt despaired, who thought that they did well, and had taken a prudent
counsel, because they had for a time a quiet hiding-place in Egypt. It
now follows, —

<span id="xvi.ix"></span>

<span id="xvi.ix-p1"></span><span id="xvi.ix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#015.md)<span id="xvi.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ix-p2"></span>**15.** Then all the men which knew that
their wives had burnt incense unto other gods, and all the women that
stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land
of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,

<span id="xvi.ix-p3"></span>**15.** Et responderunt Jeremiae om-nes
viri, qui sciebant quod suffitum offerrent uxores ipsorum diis alienis,
et omnes mulieres quae adstabant, coetus magnus, et totus populus qui
habitabant in terra Aegypti, in Pathros, dicendo,

<span id="xvi.ix-p4"></span>**16.** *As for* the word that thou hast
spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.

<span id="xvi.ix-p5"></span>**16.** In sermone (*subaudiendum est* in,
*vel,* quoad sermonem) quem locutus es ad nos in nomine Jehovae, nos
audivimus to.

<span id="xvi.ix-p6"></span> 

<span id="xvi.ix-p7"></span><span id="xvi.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ix-p8"></span>Here is more fully seen the irreclaimable
obstinacy of that nation; for Jeremiah had given them more than
sufficient evidences of his integrity. They ought then to have been
fully convinced that he was a true Prophet of God. Though they had
disregarded him for forty years and more, he had yet given full proof of
his legation when he had constantly, even to the last, prophesied of the
destruction of the city and the Temple. They had, then, learnt by their
own calamities that Jeremiah was an instrument of the Holy Spirit, and a
true interpreter of God’s will. And it hence appears how blind they were
when they rejected all his admonitions, and counted his threatenings as
fables. Thus, as in a mirror, the Holy Spirit of God sets before us how
great the madness of men is when Satan once takes possession of their
minds. But let us, at the same time, learn that this is the reward
rendered to obstinacy, when God’s Prophets are despised. It was, indeed,
a monstrous and most disgraceful thing, when they dared so insolently to
repudiate the holy Prophet, while, at the same time, they had been
reduced to the greatest extremities, and when spoiled of all things, had
fled into Egypt, and lived there, as we have seen, in a servile and
miserable condition. Inasmuch, then, as they were still ferocious and
still arrogant towards God’s Prophet, it hence appears that they were
untamable.

<span id="xvi.ix-p9"></span>He then says, that *all the men* to whom the
impiety of their wives was known, *answered Jeremiah* By these words the
Prophet intimates that the beginning of idolatry was from the women.
Things then had not as yet gone so far that all the men openly
worshipped idols; but the women had taken this liberty, and the men
readily indulged them. But why then did the Prophet before reprove them,
as though they all made *incense* to idols? We doubtless learn from this
passage, that they are not only guilty before God who openly do what is
wicked, but also those who by connivance tolerate them; for the men
ought to have interfered so as to restrain their wives from polluting
themselves with ungodly superstitions; but this they patiently endured.
Then their consent was the same as the deed, as we may rightly conclude
from the words of the Prophet. He then says, that the men offered
incense, not indeed openly and with their own hands, but that they knew
of their wives, and that this impiety was done by the women with their
consent. The rest I cannot now finish, I will proceed with it to-morrow.

<span id="xvi.x"></span>

<span id="xvi.x-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xvi.x-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou wouldest
prove our faith by many trials, we may constantly persevere in the pure
worship of thy name, and in calling on thee in sincerity and truth, and
that as we are surrounded and beset on every side by many pollutions, we
may preserve ourselves pure and devoted to thee, both in body and soul,
and thus proceed through the whole course of our life, so that at length
we may appear unpolluted before thee, through Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xvi.xi"></span>

<span id="xvi.xi-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Sixty-Second

<span id="xvi.xi-p2"></span>WE began yesterday to explain what the
Prophet says of the answer given him by the men and women. The sum of it
was, that they would not do what the Prophet commanded them, though he
spoke to them in the name of God. They did not answer distinctly, that
the word of God or his oracle to them was of no account, but impeached
the fidelity of Jeremiah, as though he had alleged the name of God
falsely.

<span id="xvi.xi-p3"></span>But he says that the *men who knew that
their wives burnt incense to alien gods, answered him;* and he
afterwards adds, *and the women who stood by;* some read, “In the great
assembly.” But I have no doubt but that the Prophet means, that the
answer was given in common by the men and by the women. He then says,
that the women were at the same time present. He afterwards adds, *a
great assembly.* What follows is an explanation, *the whole people who
dwelt in the land of Egypt,* who dwelt in Pathros in the land of Egypt,
and especially in that part. We have elsewhere spoken, of Pathros.

<span id="xvi.xi-p4"></span><span id="xvi.xi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xi-p5"></span>We see, in short, that God’s Prophet was
rejected; and yet there is no doubt but the Jews pretended some
religion, but they did not think that they were bound to obey the
command of man. And whence was this contempt? even from nothing but
perverseness; for however hypocrites may dissemble and say that they do
not despise God and his word, and address their words to ministers, yet
their impiety betrays them when, on the one hand, they pretend that they
worship God, and on the other they repudiate those furnished with his
commands whom he would have them to hear. But God will not and cannot
have himself separated from his word. Let us now go on —

<span id="xvi.xii"></span>

<span id="xvi.xii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah

<span id="xvi.xii-p2"></span>**17.** But we will certainly do whatsoever
thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen
of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done,
we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah,
and in the streets of Jerusalem: for *then* had we plenty of victuals,
and were well, and saw no evil.

<span id="xvi.xii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xii-p6"></span>Here they shew more openly their obstinacy;
for having said that they had no faith in Jeremiah, as he had not been
sent by God, they now add that they would indeed be the worshippers of
God, but according to their own will. We have here discovered to us the
fountain of all superstitions. This passage sufficiently proves whence
these flow, and from what source proceed all the corruptions by which
religion has been vitiated in all ages, even from the willfulness and
pride of men. While therefore men arrogate so much to themselves as to
make a law respecting the worship of God, all things must necessarily go
wrong. It was for this reason I said that this is the origin of all
errors. How then is religion to remain pure? even by depending on God’s
mouth, by subjecting ourselves to his word, and by putting a bridle on
ourselves, so as not to introduce anything except what he commands and
approves. The right rule then as to the worship of God is, to adopt
nothing but what he prescribes. On the other hand religion becomes
vitiated and degenerates into superstition as soon as men seek to be
legislators for themselves, when they say, *Doing we shall do every word
that cometh forth from our mouth.*

<span id="xvi.xii-p7"></span>This willfulness is indeed what humble men
will condemn if they only consult common sense; but it is an evil innate
in all, to seek to worship God as it seems good to them. But Jeremiah
here paints for us as it were on a tablet the beginning of all
superstitions: men set up their own will and fancies in opposition to
the commands of God.

<span id="xvi.xii-p8"></span>He afterwards adds, *To offer incense to
the frame-work of the heavens.* Interpreters differ as to the meaning of
this clause. We have stated some things already in the seventh chapter;
but as a great part of you were not then present, it is necessary to
repeat what was then said. Some derive the last word but one from <span
id="xvi.xii-p8.1"></span>מלך, *melek,* which means to reign; and *hence*
they give this rendering, “to the queen of the heavens;” and this is the
explanation of *Jerome.* But others derive the word from <span
id="xvi.xii-p8.2"></span>לאך, *lak,* and render it “work;” and some more
rashly, “ministry;” and others, “framework,” or, fabric, (*machina.*)
There are also those deduce the word from <span
id="xvi.xii-p8.3"></span>הלך, *elek,* which is to walk; and they think
that all the stars or planets are included in this term; and we indeed
see that walking or motion is what belongs to all the stars. But if the
word comes from the verb to reign, “the queen of the heavens” must be
taken for the principal star, as the Chaldee paraphrase regards it.

<span id="xvi.xii-p9"></span>But some consider that the sun is intended,
and some the moon. The sun in Hebrew is of the feminine gender;
therefore the sun may properly be called a queen in that language. But
if we take it as meaning frame-work, one of the radical letters <span
id="xvi.xii-p9.1"></span>א, *aleph,* is wanting, as in the seventh
chapter. The Prophet, however, seems to mention here the whole machinery
of the heavens, as though the unbelieving had said, that as wonderful
glory appeared there, their worship was doubtless pleasing to God, when
his majesty was adored in the stars and in the whole frame-work of the
heavens. I do not therefore consider that one starts meant, but the very
heavens or all the stars; and though the word is in the singular number,
yet it means what is commonly called the hosts of heaven.

<span id="xvi.xii-p10"></span>They then said, “We shall go on in our
usual manner; for we have hitherto offered *incense to the fabric* (or
the frame-work) *of the heavens,* and poured libations; we shall not
then desist from what we have usually done: “and they further said, “So
have we done, *we, and our fathers, and our kings, and our princes.”*
Here they set up the authority of fathers in opposition to the authority
of God, as it was usually done.

<span id="xvi.xii-p11"></span>We see also in our day that the Papists
superciliously boast of the Fathers and the Catholic Church, when the
plain truth is brought forward. They think that darkness overspreads the
Word of God, and that whatever is adduced from the Law, from the
Prophets, and from the Gospel, is reduced to nothing when they object
and say that it is otherwise, that the fathers have spoken otherwise,
that it was otherwise understood in old times. We hence see that the
Papists of this day fight with the same weapons as idolaters formerly
employed; and though the devil transforms himself in various ways, yet
superstitious men ever adopt this principle, that whatever is handed
down from our forefathers ought to be held sacred; and hypocrites do
especially harden themselves in this error, when they can boast of kings
and princes, as was the case in this instance; for they said, that they
followed what had been done, not only by the common people, but even by
kings and princes. They took it as granted that kings and princes could
not have fallen into ignorance. The truth is, that greatness and
splendor cover the ignorance and folly of kings. So when simple men
speak of kings, their eyes are blinded or dazzled by the magnificence
displayed, so that they think kings to be without dispute wise and
endowed with the best understanding. Hence it is that Satan is wont
often to use such masks for the purpose of deceiving men. Let us
therefore learn to render to God altogether the honor of prescribing by
his word the law as to religion; and thus let no altitude or dignity be
allowed to overshadow the authority of God; but on the contrary, let
kings and princes be constrained to submit when God appears.

<span id="xvi.xii-p12"></span>They afterwards added, *In the cities of
Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem* And they mentioned these places
in order to sanction their own superstitions; for the holiness of
Jerusalem was to them a cover for all vices, as we see to be the case at
this day with respect to Rome, which is boastfully extolled by the
Papists, as though the hypocrisy which sends forth the most nauseous
filth through the whole world, were the most perfect holiness. Whatever
then comes from Rome, they would have to be counted as a heavenly
oracle. In the same manner the wretched Jews dared to set up Jerusalem
in opposition to God. Great, indeed, was the dignity of the city, not
such is that of Rome at this day; for the Papists have not taken from
God’s word the encomiums, by which they extol that city, which is really
a foetid and an abominable brothel. Jerusalem had its dignity from God
himself; but the Jews in their folly degraded Jerusalem when they
corrupted the Law and instituted fictitious worship, according to their
own will. And yet we see that they armed themselves with this name, as a
weapon, against the Prophet, as though they brought God to fight against
himself. Jerusalem had no dignity but that with which God himself had
favored it; but they boasted that it was a holy city, that whatever was
done in it was to be deemed holy and lawful, and not to be disputed, as
though God’s Law had been lying buried under the dignity of the city.
Now Jerusalem had derived its splendor and all the dignity it had from
the Law only. But this, as I have said, was the wickedness of men, that
they corrupted and perverted the benefits of God.

<span id="xvi.xii-p13"></span>They then added, that they were *satisfied
with bread,* when they burned *incense to the work* or workmanship *of
the heavens* It has ever been a common thing with the despisers of God,
that they have been inebriated with earthly things, so as to disregard
God himself, and to think that all their superstitions would go
unpunished. But whence comes this error? even because men deceive
themselves, when God patiently bears with them. God does not immediately
take vengeance on the profanation of his name, he does not immediately
punish hypocrites and idolaters, he does not immediately fulminate
against ungodly and spurious modes of worship: his forbearance seems to
be taken as an inducement to sin, as an excitement to licentiousness.
When, therefore, the Jews adduced this defense, that they were
*satisfied with bread,* it was the same thing as though they had said,
“As long as God spared us, and suspended his judgment, it was well with
us.” But they ought not to have abused the forbearance of God, and thus
to have heaped on themselves judgment, as Paul says. Now there was also
another cause of error, for when God drew men back from error by
chastising them more severely, as they deserved, after seeing they were
still obstinate, they then began so to regard God’s judgment, as
foolishly to think that the cause proceeded from religion being changed.
So, at the beginning of the Gospel we see that there were similar
complaints among all the ungodly, as the ancients have recorded, and
especially *Tertullian,* in his apologies: “If the Tiber inundated, if
any calamity happened, if hail or frost, the fault was ascribed to the
name of Christ and his doctrine. From the time religion has been
changed, we have not ceased to be miserable.” But they did not consider
as they ought to have done, that when they were blind and sunk in
errors, God for a long time bore with them, and that after the doctrine
of the gospel had shone forth, they still wickedly followed their
accustomed impiety, which before might have been excused on the ground
of ignorance: from the time God had shewn to them the way of salvation,
they had resisted it, as it were designedly and willfully, so that they
deserved a heavier punishment.

<span id="xvi.xii-p14"></span>Such was the impiety of the ancient people
according to this answer, *We were satisfied with bread* when we poured
out libations to the frame-work of the heavens; that is, as God did not
immediately punish their impiety, they were happy and saw no evil. And
yet it is certain that they said what was untrue, for God had often
chastised them, and at the time they were sedulous and devoted to their
false worship. They had gone astray to idolatry before Jeremiah was
born; nay, before Isaiah had commenced his office as a Prophet: and we
know how severely at that time God punished them for their wickedness;
for in the time of Isaiah the kingdom of Israel was distressed, and then
wholly destroyed. Jerusalem, as Isaiah says, became like a cottage, and
the whole country was laid waste; and at this time they poured out
libations to the workmanship of heaven and burnt incense. We know how
great was the zeal of Ahaz, and of other wicked kings. Hezekiah, indeed,
and Josiah labored to restore the pure worship of God; but Manasseh, the
son and successor of Hezekiah, immediately subverted everything. While
then they were so fervid in their superstitions, did all things succeed
according to their wishes, as they now boasted? By no means, for God
pursued them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence.

<span id="xvi.xii-p15"></span>What then did this boasting mean, that
they were *satisfied* with bread, and were *happy,* and saw no *evil,*
at the time they poured out libations? The truth is, that madness so
drives on headlong the ungodly, that they perceived not God’s hand, when
stretched forth against them. But even had they truly said, that they
were *happy* at the time they pro-stituted themselves to idols, yet they
could not have hence inferred, that their false worship was approved by
God; for when he bears with men for a time, he does not yet cease to be
their judge; for he will at length, in his own time, sum-. mort to his
tribunal the ungodly whom he has long spared. In short, hypocrites at
first trifle with God, and thus turn his mercy to an occasion of
sinning, as though there were no punishment; this is one thing: and in
the second place, they are not roused by the scourges of God, but remain
stupid when God chastises them. It follows, —

<span id="xvi.xiii"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#018.md)<span id="xvi.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiii-p2"></span>**18.** But since we left off to burn
incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto
her, we have wanted all *things,* and have been consumed by the sword
and by the famine.

<span id="xvi.xiii-p3"></span>**18.** Ex quo autem desiimus suffitum
offerre artificio coelo-rum et libare ei libamina, desti-tuti (*vel,*
privati) fuimus omnibus, et gladio et fame sumus consumpti.

<span id="xvi.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xiii-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiii-p6"></span>Here he enlarges on their ingratitude,
that they attributed to God the fault of all their calamities, when yet
God would have drawn them, as the Prophet will hereafter tell us, as it
were out of darkness into light, had they been reclaimable. They ought
to have been restored, by punishments, to their right mind. But this had
been so far from being the case, that the effect of God’s scourges had
been to render them more and more obstinate.

<span id="xvi.xiii-p7"></span>They then said, that from the time they
left off to worship idols, they had been miserable, that they had
labored under the want of everything, and had been consumed by famine
and the sword. They had before been consumed, as it is well known, by
the famine and the sword, and as we have said, they had before suffered
many calamities. Why then did they not refer to these punishments which
they had suffered for having so often, and for so long a time, rebelled
against God? But they willfully *covered* over God’s judgments: and yet
they said that they had been in every way miserable, since they had
*ceased* from false worship. But was it for this reason they became
miserable, because they no longer poured out libations to stars and
idols? Nay, the reason was very different, as the Prophet will presently
answer them. But we must repeat all their words; we shall come
afterwards to the refutation given by the Prophet.

<span id="xvi.xiv"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiv-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#019.md)<span id="xvi.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiv-p2"></span>**19.** And when we burned incense to the
queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make
her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without
our men?

<span id="xvi.xiv-p3"></span>**19.** Et quando nos suffitum fecimus
artificio coelorum, et libavimus ei libamina, an absque viris nostris
fecimus ei placentas ad exhilarandum illud (*aliivertunt,* simulaehrum,)
et etiam libando ei libamina?

<span id="xvi.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xiv-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xiv-p6"></span>They brought forward another argument, that
they were not a small portion, but the whole people, who then flourished
in prosperity, when they offered incense to idols. We know that but a
few remained of that large multitude, which lived when the kingdom as
yet existed. They said then that they were not the sole authors of this
superstition, but that it was practiced by a large number of men, even
the whole people, when Jerusalem was full of inhabitants, and the whole
country.

<span id="xvi.xiv-p7"></span>Some explain this of the women, but
improperly, as I think. The masculine gender is sometimes applied to
women, but seldom, and it is harsh, and then it agrees not with this
passage, where the whole context shews that men are spoken of; but one
reason only leads them to think so, and that is frivolous. It is said,
*Have we done this without our men?* When, therefore, they said that
they had not acted without the men, it has immediately occurred to
inter-prefers that the women spoke; but the word is in the masculine
gender. It is well known that <span id="xvi.xiv-p7.1"></span>אנשים,
*anushim,* mean sometimes the aged, and also the princes who bear rule,
as it is evident from other passages. But here that small band which
remained brought forward the consent of a large multitude, as though
they had said, “We here are many against thee who standest alone; but if
thou comparest the ancient condition of the city and of the land with
our miserable state, when the kingdom flourished, when the city remained
in safety, when the whole country was full of inhabitants, did they not
all then, with one consent, worship the stars and the workmanship of the
heavens? Since, then, this religion has been approved by the consent of
so many, what meanest thou in attempting to take it away from us?”

<span id="xvi.xiv-p8"></span>We now, then, perceive the design of the
Prophet, or rather we understand the meaning of those whom he has
introduced as the speakers. They then said that they did not offer
incense and pour out libations without their *men,* that is, without
that large multitude, which afterwards perished or was consumed; and
thus they set up against him, as a cloud, a large number of men, as the
Papists do at this day, who, by means of consent, only fight against the
truth, of God for the purpose of overwhelming it. In like manner did
these wretched men contend with Jeremiah; and this pretext was their
shield, that the whole people, before the city was demolished, followed
these superstitions: *We have,* then, *not done* this *without* our
*men,* pouring out libations and offering incense. It now follows, —

<span id="xvi.xv"></span>

<span id="xvi.xv-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:20-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#020.md)<span id="xvi.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xv-p2"></span>**20.** Then Jeremiah said unto all the
people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had
given him *that* answer, saying,

<span id="xvi.xv-p3"></span>**20.** Et dixit Jeremias ad totum populum,
ad viros et mulieres, et ad totum populum, qui responderant ipsi
sermonem, dicendo,

<span id="xvi.xv-p4"></span>**21.** The incense that ye burned in the
cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers,
your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the
LORD remember them, and came it *not* into his mind?

<span id="xvi.xv-p5"></span>**21.** An non suffitus quem vos suffiebatis
(vel, adolebatis) in urbibus Jehudah et compitis Jerusalem, vos et
patres vestri, reges vestri et duces vestri, et populus terre, eorum
(hoc est, ejus suffumigationis, vel, harum omnium superstitionum)
recordatus est Jehova, et ascenderunt in cor ejus?

<span id="xvi.xv-p6"></span>**22.** So that the LORD could no longer
bear, because of the evil of your doings, *and* because of the
abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a
desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as
at this day.

<span id="xvi.xv-p7"></span>**22.** Et non potuit Jehova amplius ferre
propter malitiam operum vestrorum, propter abominationes quas fecistis,
et redacta est terra vestra in vastitatem et in stuporem et in
maledictum (vel, execrationem,) ita ut nemo sit habitator, sicut dies
haec (hoc est, sicut hodie apparet.)

<span id="xvi.xv-p8"></span>**23.** Because ye have burned incense, and
because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice
of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his
testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.

<span id="xvi.xv-p9"></span>**23.** Propterea quod suffitum fecis-tis et
peccastis Jehovae (vel, impie gessistis contra Jehovam,) et non
audivistis vocem Jehovae, et in lege ejus et statutis et testimoniis non
ambulastis, propterea accedit vobis malum hoc, sicut dies haec (hoc est,
sicut hodie apparet.)

<span id="xvi.xv-p10"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xv-p11"></span><span id="xvi.xv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xv-p12"></span>The Prophet refutes the impious objections
by which the Jews had attempted to subvert and to render contemptible
his doctrine, he then turns against them all that they had falsely
boasted. They had at the beginning said, *“Our kings,* our *princes,*
and our *fathers,* had before used these rites; and they have been
delivered to us, as it were, by their hands.” To this Jeremiah answers,
*“This* is certainly true, and for this reason it was that God became so
severe a judge of their impiety, when he took away your fathers from the
world, when he wholly destroyed the kingdom itself, when he demolished
the city, and when at length he afflicted you with all kinds of evils:
for except your kings, and your fathers, and your princes, had been
impious towards God, he would have never treated them with so much
severity; for he has promised to be a Father to the children of Abraham.
God, then, must have been grievously offended with you, and your
fathers, and your kings, when his wrath thus burned against them.”

<span id="xvi.xv-p13"></span>There is, then, here a retort; for as we
see that the Prophet turns against them what they had adduced against
him. This is the sum of what is said.

<span id="xvi.xv-p14"></span>He says that he spoke to *the whole
people,* both men and women, and he repeats *the whole people,* because
all had subscribed to the impious calumny. Then God says, “For this
reason have I destroyed your city and you, even because ye burnt incense
to-your idols.” The truth of what they had boasted is allowed, but it is
turned to a meaning different from what they thought. For, as their
fathers and their kings had imbibed superstitions, they supposed that
they were doing right in following them; for, as we have said,
*hypocrites* consider use and custom as sufficient reasons for
disregarding the Law. Then, as to the fact itself, the Prophet admits
that what they said was quite true, that this had been the cause of all
their evils; for had not the kings and the whole people provoked the
wrath of God, the temple would not have been demolished, nor the kingdom
destroyed; God, in short, would not have alienated himself from his own
people whom he had adopted. This is the meaning.

<span id="xvi.xv-p15"></span><span id="xvi.xv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xv-p16"></span>*The incense,* he says, *which ye have
burnt in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your
fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the whole people of the land,
has not Jehovah remembered them?* Whence, he says, has this dreadful
calamity proceeded, which has destroyed all your race? Even from the
wrath of God, for it has not happened to you by chance, for God had by
his servants predicted what afterwards has been really fulfilled. It
then follows, that your city has been destroyed through the righteous
judgment of God. And what has been the cause of so great and so grievous
a vengeance? Even your incense.

<span id="xvi.xv-p17"></span><span id="xvi.xv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xv-p18"></span>And hence he adds, *Jehovah could not
endure the wickedness of your works and the abominations which ye have
done: therefore,* he says, *your land has been reduced to a waste* The
Prophet, in short, shews that had they not been justly exposed to God’s
judgment, they would not have been destroyed. For he assumes this
principle, that God is not angry without reason; and then he assumes
another principle, that as God had chosen the seed of Abraham, and had
been always propitious even to the unworthy, they would have been made
partakers of his kindness, had not God been wholly alienated from them.
It then follows, that God’s vengeance had not been thus kindled by some
slight offense, but by many and daily offenses, so that it could no
longer be deferred: for the atrocity of punishment shews the atrocity of
sin; and hence he says, *Jehovah could not endure the wickedness of your
works, and the abominations which ye have done: therefore,* he adds,
*your land has been made a waste, an astonishment, and a curse, or
execration, so that there is no inhabitant*

<span id="xvi.xv-p19"></span><span id="xvi.xv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xv-p20"></span>He at length explains more clearly, in
other words, the same thing, on *account of your incense,* he says, *and
because ye have done wickedly,* etc. By naming incense especially,
stating a part for the whole, he refers to all false and corrupt modes
of worship, as it was stated yesterday; but he declares all of them to
have been abominable. Then he says, *Ye have acted impiously against
God* He now exaggerates their sin, for they had despised all godly
admonitions, *ye have not hearkened,* he says, *to the voice of Jehovah*
I apply this to the discourses of the Prophets, by which God continued
to exhort them to repentance; for he daily and constantly addressed
them, in order to restore them to the way of salvation. Then the Prophet
condemns them, because they hearkened not to the words of the Prophets.

<span id="xvi.xv-p21"></span>Then he adds, *Nor walked in his Law, nor
in his statutes, nor in his testimonies, he* shews by these words, that
even if Prophets had not been sent, one after the other, the Law ought
to have been sufficient for them. But he was not content with mentioning
the Law only, but added, *statutes and testimonies:* by which words he
intimates, as we said yesterday, that the doctrine of the Law was clear
and plain.

<span id="xvi.xv-p22"></span>he at length adds, *Therefore has all this
evil happened to you, as it appears at this day.* The Prophet, in short,
intimates that their guilt was sufficiently proved, because God had been
so angry with them, and they had been so severely afflicted; for if his
judgments are right, it follows that the punishment he inflicted on the
Jews was right. It may also be hence inferred, that they had been
rebellious, because they had perverted and corrupted his true worship.

<span id="xvi.xvi"></span>

<span id="xvi.xvi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xvi.xvi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast not
only in thy Law prescribed to us what is right, and shewed to us the way
of a godly life, but hast also more clearly revealed thy will to us by
the light of thy Gospel, where Christ thy Son shines forth as the Sun of
righteousness, — O grant, that we may submit ourselves wholly to thee,
and from the heart render thee obedience, and to this apply all our
efforts and direct all our doings, so that having finished the course of
this life, we may at length come into that blessed rest which has been
prepared for us in heaven by Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xvi.xviii-p10"></span>Jeremiah pursues the same subject, and
not only bitterly reproves the ungodly men who so pertinaciously
despised his doctrine, but also shews that they could gain nothing by
their audacity, because they would at length be violently broken down,
as they could not bear to be corrected, he says at the beginning, *Ye
and your wives have spoken;* the men are also included, Ye have spoken
both men and women, and *with your hands have fulfilled it;* that is,
your obstinacy is complete, for, as you have spoken insolently against
God, so there has been a performance; for by *hands* he designates the
work done. he then shews that they had advanced to the highest pitch of
impiety, for they hesitated not to vomit forth these impious words, *We
will not obey God,* and they joined their hands to their mouth, for they
strenuously executed what they had said. The thought itself was
sufficient to condemn them; but when they thus spoke with their tongues,
and then employed their hands against God, it was a proof of desperate
audacity, as though they willfully designed to provoke him.

<span id="xvi.xviii-p11"></span>But he shews what issue awaited these
impious men, who so presumptuously rebelled against God. When he bids
them to hear what God on the other hand had sworn, he compares God with
themselves, as though he had said, *“You* may a hundred times increase
in your madness, yet God will be the conqueror; for he is an adversary
who will surely subvert all schemes and efforts.” But before he comes to
this, he mentions what they said, *Doing we shall do our vows which we
have vowed, to burn incense,* etc. Here Jeremiah relates what we have
before seen, that the Jews, under the pretext of doing what had been
before done, continued thus rebellious against God. We perceive this by
the word *vows;* and the superstitious, when they are pressed, are wont
always to flee to this pretext, that to persevere in one’s resolution is
a great virtue. While, then, they avoid the charge of fickleness, they
harden themselves against God.

<span id="xvi.xviii-p12"></span>The same thing we see at this day under
the Papacy: The older any one is, the more obstinate he is. “What! have
I not learned during forty or fifty years what religion is, and how to
worship God? I have been thus taught from a child, and have by a long
habit followed this way: it would be now a disgraceful thing for me to
change my course and to relinquish the faith which I have professed for
so many years.”

<span id="xvi.xviii-p13"></span>There is, then, no doubt but the Jews
made a pretense of this kind against Jeremiah, when they said that they
had *vowed.* For hypocrites make no distinction when they vow anything,
but indiscriminately obtrude on God whatever comes to their minds; they
afterwards stand fixed in their foolish fancies, and say that a. vow is
inviolable, a sacred thing. Such was the excuse of the people. But we
see from the Prophet’s answer how vainly they did bring forward in
opposition to God their vows, which had been made without judgment and
without reason.

<span id="xvi.xviii-p14"></span>And this passage ought to be carefully
noticed; so that we may especially know, that it is a folly in no way
pleasing to God, when men indiscriminately vow whatever they may dream
according to their own fancies. God then would have sobriety and regard
to his will to be observed as to vows. But when any one has made an
*inconsiderate* vow, pertinaciously to persist in it is no less
displeasing to God than the vow itself. The Jews had vowed; the warning
of the Prophet ought to have constrained them to change their
resolution. But while they avoided every kind of fickleness, we see that
instead of constancy they set up their own perverseness and diabolical
obstinacy in opposition to God. When, therefore, we rashly make vows,
disapproved by God, nothing is better than immediately to retract them;
for we have already sinned more than enough in having abused the holy
name of God. For this reason the Prophet says, that the Jews spoke thus,
*Doing we shall do the vows we have vowed;* and what were these? To
offer incense to the stars and to hosts of Heaven. Had they vowed
anything to God, they ought not to have broken their pledged faith; but
they had made vows to the devil; then they ought to have immediately
changed their purpose. When I say that vows made to God ought to be
performed, I mean lawful vows; for he who makes a vow without judgment,
does not vow to God; but those vows which God sanctions ought to be
deemed sacred; and whatever vows God repudiates, ought to be counted as
nothing. We hence see that the Jews were justly condemned, for they
pertinaciously paid their vows to their own idols.

<span id="xvi.xviii-p15"></span>He adds by way of irony, *Confirming ye
will confirm your vows, doing ye will do your vows* Here the Prophet
sharply *checks* their insolence, *because* they thus set up themselves
against God, as though it were a great virtue to persevere in their
wicked purpose; ye cannot change, he says, but confirming ye will
confirm your vows!

<span id="xvi.xviii-p16"></span><span id="xvi.xviii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xviii-p17"></span>*Hear ye now,* he says, *the word of
Jehovah, etc*. By these words, as I have already hinted, he intimates,
that they could gain nothing by their insolence, except that they would
thereby provoke God, who on the other hand did set up his own power
against them. *Thus,* then, *saith Jehovah,* Behold, *I have sworn by my
great name,* etc. As they had so often disregarded God speaking to them,
he confirmed by an oath what he was going to say. Had he only
threatened, they might have as usual disregarded him, as though the
Prophet spoke what was vain. This is the reason why he now introduces
God as making an oath. And it ought to be observed, that whenever God
confirms his words by an oath, this he does, either because he sees that
he has to do with men who are like stones, who cannot be made to feel by
simple truth; or when he is pleased to give aid to our infirmity and
sloth: for God confirms threatenings as well as promises by an oath.
When he thus confirms threatenings, then he indirectly condemns the
obstinate wickedness of those whom he addresses. But when he promises
anything by an oath, he shews how great our propensity is to indulge
doubts, and what weakness there is in our faith; for were such faith in
us as ought to be, we should be contented with one little word. As,
then, God interposes his own name as a pledge, it hence appears, that we
are naturally unbelieving, or that the weakness of our faith is such
that it wants this support. But here, as God threatens, he shews that
the Jews were so obstinate in their wickedness, that it was necessary to
shake them by terror.

<span id="xvi.xviii-p18"></span>Now, God makes an oath by *his own great
name* Men, as the Apostle says, swear by God, (<span
id="xvi.xviii-p18.1"></span>[Heb
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#016.md)<span
id="xvi.xviii-p18.1"></span>;) because he is called as a witness and a
judge when his name is interposed. But it is no superfluous addition,
when God not only swears by himself, but by his own *great name* For he
thus intimated, that the Jews were greatly deceived, if they thought
that God would not execute vengeance on them, because they indulged
themselves. For it is a common thing with hypocrites to measure God by
their own judgment; and when they extenuate his power, they think of him
as of a child. In order, then, to divest the Jews of this false
imagination, he says, *by his own great name* There is, then, implied
here a contrast between the greatness of God’s name, which cannot be
diminished at the will of man, and the presumption of the ancient
people, who rendered God’s name contemptible.

<span id="xvi.xviii-p19"></span>He afterwards adds, *If my name,* etc.
It is an imperfect sentence, which, as we have often said, was
frequently used in order that a greater reverence may be observed by us,
when we swear by God’s name. We must now come to what is said, *There
shall not be a Jew, who is to swear any more in my name* God himself
makes an oath, and what is the oath which he makes? that no one was to
profane his name; for they thought that it was some evidence of religion
when they swore by Jehovah. It was yet nothing but an awful profanation
of God’s name. They contaminated themselves, as it appears, with
Egyptian superstitions; but that they might differ from the Egyptians
themselves and possess something special, that they, in short, might
seem to be a holy nation, they still retained a form of swearing,
distinct from what was common among the Gentiles. God declares that he
would not suffer his name to be any more irreverently used in Egypt*.
Not invoked,* he says, *shall be my name any more by the mouth of a Jew*
And that he speaks of oaths we gather from the next verse, when he says,
*Live doth Jehovah in all the land of Egypt* For, as it has been said,
the Jews as yet boasted that they kept the *Law,* because God’s name was
still in their mouth and on their tongue. But God says that it was to be
taken away from them, because it was a disgraceful pollution of his
name, when they mingled themselves with the Egyptians in all kinds of
superstitions, and yet boasted that they were God’s people. It follows,
—

<span id="xvi.xix"></span>

<span id="xvi.xix-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#027.md)<span id="xvi.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xix-p2"></span>**27.** Behold, I will watch over them for
evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that *are* in the land
of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there
be an end of them.

<span id="xvi.xix-p3"></span>**27.** Ecce ego vigilo super eos in malum,
et non in bonum; et consumentur omnes viri (omnis vir, *ad verbum*)
Jehudah, quicunque sunt in terra Aegypti gladio et fame usque dum
consumantur (*est quidem, aliud verbum, sed ejusdem significationis.*)

<span id="xvi.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xix-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xix-p6"></span>Here he more dearly expresses what he had
said in the last verse, that none of the Jews would remain alive in
Egypt. He now then points out the manner, even because he would not
cease to consume them until they wholly perished and were brought to
final ruin. He had said, No *more shall my name be called, nor shall the
Jews in Egypt swear, Live doth Jehovah;* and why? because I will destroy
them all, so that there will be none remaining in Egypt to pollute under
a false pretense my name.

<span id="xvi.xix-p7"></span>*I will watch over them,* he says, *for
evil and not for good* This mode of speaking we have observed elsewhere,
and explained why the Prophets spoke thus, even because hypocrites,
though they think God cares not for human affairs, and imagine that he
sleeps in heaven, and hence audaciously provoke him, as though they were
fugitives and their purpose hid from God, yet boast of God’s providence,
and pretend that they acquiesce confidently in him. For this reason the
Prophet answered, that God watched indeed, but *not for good* We then
perceive the object of the Prophet; he derided the presumption of the
people, who thought that God had a care for their safety. He then says,
that God indeed does not sleep, but that this would bring no benefit to
hypocrites; for though God watches as a father to preserve his own
people, he yet watches as a judge to destroy all the ungodly. It
follows, —

<span id="xvi.xx"></span>

<span id="xvi.xx-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#028.md)<span id="xvi.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xx-p2"></span>**28.** Yet a small number that escape the
sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and
all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to
sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.

<span id="xvi.xx-p3"></span>**28.** Et qui evaserint e gladio
re-vertentur e terra Aegypti in terram Jehudah pauci numero; et
cognoscent omnes reliquiae Jehudah, quae ingressi sunt terram Aegypti,
ut habitarent illic, sermo quis stabit a me, an ab ipsis.

<span id="xvi.xx-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xx-p5"></span><span id="xvi.xx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xx-p6"></span>He at length adds that a few would escape.
He had said before, (<span id="xvi.xx-p6.1"></span>[Jer
44:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#014)<span id="xvi.xx-p6.1"></span>.md)
that there would be none, but added at the end of the verse, *“but* such
as shall escape.” We said that this second clause is to be explained of
the Jews who had been driven into exile in Babylon. But if it be applied
to exiles in Egypt the meaning will be different. For the Prophet then
said that none would escape, that none would remain alive: he thus
doubtless took away every hope of deliverance with regard to those in
Egypt. But he added, “but such as shall escape,” that is, such as should
stealthily escape from the sword, as though they had never migrated into
Egypt. And then in this different sense must necessarily be taken what
the Prophet adds now, *They who escape shall return* But we must bear in
mind that those remaining alive would not be numbered among the exiles,
for they must have withdrawn themselves so as no longer to form a part
of that people. They had before become fugitives, but when they departed
from Egypt, that second flight made them to be no longer a residue in
that land.

<span id="xvi.xx-p7"></span>When, therefore, the Prophet declares that
none of the residue would escape, we must understand the words as
meaning, that there would be Jews no more in Egypt, as their memory
would be obliterated. But when, in the second place, he mentions
evaders, <span id="xvi.xx-p7.1"></span>פליטים, *pelithim,* (the word
which we have rendered, “They who shall escape,”) he means that those
who escaped had now ceased to be counted among the residue, having in a
manner of their own accord separated themselves from them, so that they
were no longer to be reckoned among the fugitive exiles in Egypt. Then
he says, that *those who escape from the sword would return into the
land of Judah;* an event wholly different from what they looked for, for
they expected to return to their own country in a triumphant manner.
They intended indeed to dwell in Egypt only for a time; and they hoped
to come afterwards into a free possession of the land, when the
Chaldeans had gone far away. Thus they had promised to themselves a new
kingdom, and were not disposed to return except in great pomp. As, then,
such a restoration had been imagined by them, the Prophet *says,* that
*a few only would return* *into the land of Judah;* and then that they
would return, not to possess the land and enjoy it as their own
inheritance, but that they would return, because there would be no safe
corner where they might hide themselves. We hence see that this return
is set up in opposition to the false imagination in which the Jews
indulged; and he says that a few only would return.

<span id="xvi.xx-p8"></span>And at length he adds, *All the remnant of
Judah who had entered into the land of Egypt, shall know whose word
shall stand, mine, or theirs* Here at length the sentence is completed,
for I have said that it was the Prophet’s object to convince the Jews of
their foolish and impious presumption, when in their perverseness they
contended against God, as though he had said, “What do you mean, ye
wretched beings? Is the truth of God to give way, or can you frustrate
his purpose by your madness and obstinacy? And surely God will prove
stronger than you.” He now then fully explains his meaning. By saying,
*all shall know,* he does not refer to true and sincere knowledge, but
to experience, that is, they shall at length really find out whose word
is firm, mine or theirs.

<span id="xvi.xx-p9"></span>This passage deserves special attention; we
hence learn that we ought to acquiesce in God’s word, and wholly to
receive it, and especially to beware of that diabolical obstinacy which
the Prophet here condemns; for when we fight to the last, we must at the
end necessarily fall; though we may a hundred times complain and clamor,
yet God’s word will stand firm and will never yield to us. It follows, —

<span id="xvi.xxi"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxi-p1"></span><span id="xvi.xxi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
44:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#029.md)<span
id="xvi.xxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxi-p2"></span>**29.** And this *shall be* a sign unto
you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may
know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:

<span id="xvi.xxi-p3"></span>**29.** Et hoc vobis signum, dicit Jehovah,
quod visitabo ego super vos in hoc loco, ut sciatis quod stando stabunt
sermones mei super vos in malum.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p4"></span>**30.** Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will
give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into
the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah
into the hand of Nebuehadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that
sought his life.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p5"></span>**30.** Sic dicit Jehova, Ecce ego trado
Pharaonem Ophra regem Aegypti in manum inimicorum ejus, et in manum
quaerentium animam ejus; quemadmodum tradidi Zedechiam regem Jehudah in
manum Nabuchadnezer regis Babylonis, inimici ejus et quaerentis animam
ejus.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p6"></span> 

<span id="xvi.xxi-p7"></span><span id="xvi.xxi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxi-p8"></span>Jeremiah seals his prophecy by adding a
sign which yet was to be coincident with it. It was not then, as they
say, a premonstrative sign. And doubtless the Jews were wholly unworthy
that God should shew them anything extraordinary; but this sign was only
added, that they might know that they in vain trusted in the protection
of Egypt, and also that every excuse might be taken away.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p9"></span>This brief notice may perhaps be obscure.
We shall therefore refer to a distinction that exists: some signs
precede the time and order of things, but others are connected with the
events themselves. The signs which precede events avail to prepare the
minds of the faithful, so that they may not doubt but that God will do
what he has promised, as when Gideon sought a sign from God, and it was
granted to him; the ground was wet with dew, while the fleece remained
dry; and then the fleece remained dry when the ground was wet. (<span
id="xvi.xxi-p9.1"></span>[Jud
6:36-40](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#036.md)<span
id="xvi.xxi-p9.1"></span>.) By this sign Gideon was encouraged to
proceed in his course, when before doubt made him inert Gideon was
torpid, but when he saw by this miracle that victory would be given him,
he boldly undertook the work assigned to him. The greatest portion of
signs are of this kind. But there are other signs which do not precede
events, but shew that when the time is fulfilled the events have been
truly predicted, as when God said to Moses,

<span id="xvi.xxi-p10"></span>“This sign I give thee, that after ye have
come out of Egypt ye shall sacrifice to me in this mountain.” (<span
id="xvi.xxi-p10.1"></span>[Ex
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#012)<span id="xvi.xxi-p10.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xvi.xxi-p11"></span>Neither Moses nor the people could know
anything by that sign before they had departed from Egypt. But after
they were delivered they there gave thanks on the third day to God their
Redeemer.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p12"></span>Hence signs refer sometimes to past time,
and sometimes to what is future. Those which refer to the future are
such as we call premonstrative, as the case was with Gideon, who took up
arms with alacrity, because he knew that he was fighting under God’s
banner; and he was fully persuaded of a victory when he understood that
God would be his leader.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p13"></span><span id="xvi.xxi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxi-p14"></span>This sign then had a reference to what was
future. But the sign given to Moses was retrospective, for the people
more clearly saw that God had *been* their deliverer, because it had
been predicted to Moses when yet in the desert that the Israelites would
come there; and that place, even Mount Sinai, had been already destined
for that worship which afterwards was presented to God. The people at
the time considered this, and by calling to mind what had been
predicted, they were more and more confirmed as to their faith in God’s
favor. Such was also the sign mentioned here, *This shall be a sign,*
says Jeremiah, even that God would *deliver ­Pharaoh-hophrah into the
hand of Nebuchadnezzar his enemy*

<span id="xvi.xxi-p15"></span>Had any one then asked the Prophet why he
spoke of the king of Egypt, he would have said, “Now indeed this sign
remains as it were buried, its use is not seen; but God will in due time
shew that I have been entrusted with his commands, for whatever I
predict of the king of Egypt shall be fulfilled.” This sign was also
added, for the thing seemed incredible, that is, that Egypt could be
conquered, which was strongly fortified on every side. As, then, there
was no entrance open for enemies, especially from Pelusium, the Jews
thought that they dwelt, as they say, within the circle of the moon, and
that they were placed beyond the reach of danger. Since, then, they
confided in the protection of Egypt, and thought the land unassailable,
this their confidence was laughed to scorn.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p16"></span>And the Prophet expressly mentions the
surname of Pharaoh, which was Hophra, the meaning of which is not known
to me; and it is probably an Egyptic word, for there is no such word in
Hebrew: and it is not known whence the word Pharaoh has come. We know
that all the kings of Egypt had this name, as the emperors of Rome were
called Caesars, in memory of Julius Caesar. The kings of Egypt were in
the same manner called Pharaohs. But each had his own name to
distinguish him from the rest; and this king was called Hophra.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p17"></span>Now what the Prophet *predicted,* if we
believe *Josephus,* was fulfilled about the fourth year after they had
departed into Egypt. For Nebuchadnezzar went down again into Egypt,
after having spoiled the Moabites and the Ammonites, and at length took
possession of that kingdom. But it was a hateful message, when Jeremiah
predicted the ruin of the kingdom. Nor is there a doubt, but that danger
appeared before his eyes, when he saw that he addressed ungodly men, who
a hundred times wished him to be destroyed. When therefore he dared to
prophesy against the king, the whole people, and the land, we hence see
how great must have been his firmness and his courage, still boldly to
discharge his office; for he was not terrified by danger, but
promulgated whatever God had committed to him. We then have here a
singular example of magnanimity; for the Prophet hesitated not to risk
his own life while obeying God.

<span id="xvi.xxi-p18"></span>By saying, *I will deliver the king of
Egypt into the hands of his enemies, and of them who seek his life,* he
intimates that there would be fatal enemies, though he speaks only of
one enemy, but he connects the army with its head: *I will deliver
­Pharaoh* then *into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, as
I have delivered Zedekiah into the hand of his enemy and of him who
sought his life;* as though he had said, “The condition of the king of
Egypt will not be better than that of *Zedekiah.”*: For Zedekiah
occupied that sacred throne of which God had testified, “Here will I
dwell;” and further, “On the throne of David shall one of his posterity
ever continue.”

<span id="xvi.xxi-p19"></span>We hence see, that the Prophet reasons
from the greater to the less; for if God had not spared King Zedekiah,
who was, as it were, a sacred person, nothing better could be hoped for
as to the king of Egypt, who reigned only in a manner usual and common.
The sum of what is said then is, that the Jews had been already
sufficiently taught by facts how true his *prophecies* were; for he had
*predicted* what at length happened to Zedekiah; but his word was not
believed. “It is now the *time,”* he says, “when the Jews must know that
I am God’s faithful servant, as God had added a proof in the *case* of
Zedekiah, which ought to have remained fixed in their memory.” Now, if
they thought that the king of Egypt was beyond danger, they ascribed
great injustice to God, who had not delivered Zedekiah, who had been
anointed in his name, and by his command. This then is the import of the
passage.

<span id="xvi.xxii"></span>

<span id="xvi.xxii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xvi.xxii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since by our
adoption, thou hast favored us with this honor, that we may call on thy
name, — O grant, that we may with a pure mouth call on thee, that thou
mayest be glorified among us, through the whole course of our life; and
that whilst we labor to render to thee that sincere obedience which thou
requirest, thy truth may be more and more propagated among us, and that
the memory of thy name may flourish more and more, until we shall at
length come into that glory, which we know is laid up for us in heaven,
by Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xvi.viii-p8"></span> The easiest way to reconcile this seeming
inconsistency is as follows: He threatens the fugitives to Egypt with
the sword; this sword was that of Nebuchadnezzar, as he foretells in
<span id="xvi.viii-p8.1"></span>[Jer
46:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#015.md)<span id="xvi.viii-p8.1"></span>,
etc. None would escape this sword except those who might have escaped in
the meantime into the land of Judah. We see the same thing referred to
in <span id="xvi.viii-p8.2"></span>[Jer
