<span id="vi.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 34

<span id="vi.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
34:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p2"></span>**1**. The word which came unto Jeremiah from
the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all
the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought
against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,

<span id="vi.ii-p3"></span>**1**. Sermo qui fuit ad Jeremiam a Jehova,
cum Nebuchadnezer rex Babylonis et totus excreitus ejus et omnia regna
terrae, quae sub dominatione marius ejus erant, et omnes populi
pugnarent contra Jerusalem *(hoc est,* oppugnarent Jerosolymam) et
cunctas urbes, dicendo,

<span id="vi.ii-p4"></span>**2**. Thus saith the LORD, the God of
Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith
the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of
Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:

<span id="vi.ii-p5"></span>**2**. Sic dicit Jehova, Deus Israel, Vade et
dices Zedechiae regi Jehudah, dices, inquam, illi, Sic dicit Jehova,
Ecce ego trado urbem hanc in manum regis Babylonis, et incendet eam
igni.

<span id="vi.ii-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.ii-p7"></span><span id="vi.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p8"></span>It is no wonder, nor ought it to be deemed
useless, that the Prophet so often repeats the same things, for we know
how great was the hardness of the people with whom he had to do. Here,
then, he tells us that he was sent to King Zedekiah when the city was
besieged by Nebuchadnezzar and his whole army. The Prophet mentions the
circumstances, by which we may understand how formidable that siege was,
for Nebuchadnezzar had not brought a small force, but had armed many and
various people. Hence the Prophet here expressly mentions *the kingdoms
of the earth and the nations who were, under his dominion*

<span id="vi.ii-p9"></span>Zedekiah was then the king at Jerusalem, and
there remained two other cities safe, as we shall hereafter see; but it
is evident how unequal he must have been to contend with an army so
large and powerful. Nebuchadnezzar was a monarch; the kingdom of Israel
had been cut off, which far exceeded in number the kingdom of Judah; and
he had subdued all the neighboring nations. Such a siege then ought to
have immediately taken away from the Jews every hope of deliverance; and
yet the Prophet shews that the king was as yet resolute, and there was
still a greater obstinacy among the people. But Zedekiah was not
overbearing; we find that he was not so proud and so cruel as tyrants
are wont to be: as then he was not of a ferocious disposition, we hence
see how great must have been the pride of the whole people, and also
their perverseness against God, when they made the king to be so angry
with the Prophet. Yet the state of things as described ought to have
subdued his passion; for as ungodly men are elevated by prosperity, so
they ought to be humbled when oppressed with adversity. The king
himself, as well as the people, were reduced to the greatest
extremities, and yet they would not be admonished by God’s Prophet; and
hence it is expressly said in <span id="vi.ii-p9.1"></span>[2Ch
36:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#016.md)<span id="vi.ii-p9.1"></span>,
that Zedekiah did not regard the word of the Prophet, though he spoke
from the mouth of the Lord, by whom he had been sent.

<span id="vi.ii-p10"></span>The sum of this prophecy is as follows: — He
first says that the *word was given him by Jehovah;* and secondly, he
points out the time, for what reason we have already stated. For if he
had reproved Zedekiah when there was peace and quietness, and when there
was no fear of danger, the king might have been easily excited, as it is
usual, against the Prophet. But when he saw the city surrounded on every
side by so large and powerful an army, — when he saw collected so many
from the kingdoms of the earth, — so many nations, that he could hardly
muster up the thousandth part of the force of his enemies,wthat he could
not and would not, notwithstanding all this, submit to God and
acknowledge his vengeance just, — this was an instance of extreme
blindness, and a proof that he was become as it were estranged in mind.
But God had thus blinded him, because his purpose was, as it is said
elsewhere, to bring an extreme punishment on the people. The blindness,
then, and the madness of the king, was an evidence of God’s wrath
towards the whole people; for Zedekiah might have appeased God if he had
repented. It was then God’s will that he should have been of an
intractable disposition, in order that he might by such perverseness and
obstinacy bring on himself utter ruin.

<span id="vi.ii-p11"></span>He mentions *Nebuchadnezzar* and *his whole
army;* he afterwards describes the army more particularly, *with all the
kingdoms under his dominion, and all nations* When Jerusalem was in this
condition, the Prophet was sent to the king. The substance of the
message follows, even that the city was doomed to destruction, because
God had resolved to deliver it into the hand of the enemy. This was a
very sad message to Zedekiah. Hypocrites, we know, seek flatteries in
their calamities; while God spares them they will not bear to be
reproved, and they reject wise counsels, and even become exasperated
when God’s Prophets exhort them to repent. But when God begins to smite
them, they wish all to partake of their misfortunes; and then also they
accuse God’s servants of cruelty, as though they insulted their misery
by setting their sins before them.

<span id="vi.ii-p12"></span>This is what we are taught by daily
experience. When any one of the common people, at the time when God does
not chasten them either by disease or poverty, or any other adversity,
is admonished, the petulant answer is, “What do you mean? in what
respect am I worthy of blame? I am conscious of no evil.” Thus
hypocrites boast as long as God bears with them, and though his kindness
spares them. But when any adversity happens to them, when any one is
laid on his bed, when another is bereaved of a son or a wife, or in any
way visited with afltietion, — if then God’s judgment is set before
them, they think that a grievous wrong is done to them: “What! have I
not evils enough without any addition? I expected comfort from God’s
servants, but they exaggerate my calamities.” In short, hypocrites are
never in a fit condition to receive God’s reproofs.

<span id="vi.ii-p13"></span>There is then no doubt but that Jeremiah
knew that his message would be intolerable to King Zedekiah, and to his
people. However, he boldly declared, as we shall see, what God had
committed to him. And we further perceive how stupid and hardened
Zedekiah must have been, for he hesitated not to cast God’s Prophet into
prison, even at the time when things were come into extremity. It was
the same thing as though God with a stretched out arm and a drawn sword
had shewn himself to be his enemy; yet he ceased not to manifest his
rage against God; and as he could do nothing worse, he cast God’s
servant into prison; and though he did this, not so much through the
impulse of his own mind as that of others, he yet could not have been
excused from blame.

<span id="vi.ii-p14"></span><span id="vi.ii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p15"></span>Now the Prophet says, *Behold, I will
deliver this city into the hand of the king of Babylon* Had he simply
said that the city would in a short time be taken, it would have been a
general truth, not effectual but frigid. It was therefore necessary to
add this, — that the ruin of the city was a just punishment inflicted by
God. And Zedekiah was also thus reminded, that though he were stronger
than his enemy, yet he could not effectually resist him, for the war was
carrid on under the authority of God, as though he had said, “Thou
thinkest that thou contendest with men; it would be difficult enough for
thee and more than enough, to contend with the eastern monarchy and so
many nations and kingdoms; farther than this, God himself is thine
enemy; have regard to him, that thou mayest learn to dread his
judgment.” And that the words might be more forcible, God himself speaks
in his own person, *Behold,* he says, *I will deliver this city into the
hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire* This last
sentence was a dreadful aggravation; for it often happens that cities
are taken, and the conquerors are satisfied with the spoils. When,
therefore, Nebuchadnezzar came against the city of Jerusalem with so
much rage that he burnt it, it was a proof of the dreadful vengeance of
God. It now follows —

<span id="vi.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.iii-p1"></span><span id="vi.iii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
34:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#003.md)<span id="vi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii-p2"></span>**3**. And thou shalt not escape out of his
hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine
eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak
with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.

<span id="vi.iii-p3"></span>**3**. Et tu non liberaberis e manu ejus,
quia comprehendendo comprehenderis et in manum ejus traderis; et oculi
tui videbunt oculos regis Babylonii, et os ejus loquetur ad os tuum
*(vel,* eum ore tuo) et Babylonem migrabis.

<span id="vi.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.iii-p5"></span><span id="vi.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii-p6"></span>As Zedekiah saw the people still doing their
duty he despised his enemy; for as the city was very strongly fortified,
he hoped to be able to preserve it a little time longer. Hence was the
false hope of deliverance; for he thought that the enemy being wearied
would return into Chaldea. He was deceived by this expectation. But the
Prophet forthwith assailed him, and declared that he would become a
captive, which Zedekiah indeed deserved through his ingratitude: for
Nebuchadnezzar had put hint in the place of his nephew, when Jeconiah
was led away into Babylon and had made him king. He afterwards revolted
from the king of Babylon, to whom he had pledged his faith, and to whom
he became tributary. But the Prophet did not regard these intermediate
causes, but the primary cause, the fountain, even because the people had
not ceased to add sins to sins, because they had been wholly untameable
and had rejected all promises, and had also closed their ears against
all wise counsels. Then God, resolving to inflict extreme punishment on
a people so perverse and desperate, blinded their king, as we have
before said, so that he revolted from the king of Babylon, and thus
brought destruction on himself, and the city, and the whole country.
Thus God overruled the intermediate causes which are apparent to us; but
he had his hidden purpose which he executed through external means.

<span id="vi.iii-p7"></span>He then says, *Thou shalt not be freed from
his hand, for thou shalt be taken;* and then he adds, *Thou shalt be
delivered into his hand* What he says in many words might have been
expressed in one sentence: but it was necessary to rouse the king’s
sottishness, by which he was inebriated, so that he might be awakened in
order that he might dread the punishment which was at hand, which,
however, was not the case; but he was thereby rendered more inexcusable.
Thus the threatenings which God repeats by his servants are never
useless; for if the ears of those who are reproved are deaf, yet what
God declares will be a testimony against them, so that every excuse on
the ground of ignorance is removed.

<span id="vi.iii-p8"></span>He says afterwards, *Thine eyes shall see
the eyes of the king of Babylon* And this happened; but his eyes were
afterwards pulled out. He met, indeed, with singular disgrace, for he
was taken to Riblah and tried as a criminal. He was not treated as a
king, nor did he retain any of his former dignity; but he was taken
before the tribunal of the king of Babylon as a thief or a miscreant.
Then after he was convicted of ingratitude and treachery, the Chaldean
king ordered his children to be slain before his eyes, and also his
chief men and counsellors, and himself to be bound with chains and his
eyes to be pulled out; and he brought him to Babylon. It was, then, a
most cruel punishment which the king of Babylon inflicted on Zedekiah.
And the Prophet seems to have indirectly referred to what happened,
*Thine eyes,* he says, *shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon:* he
was forced to look with his eyes on the proud conqueror, and then his
eyes were pulled out; but he had first seen his own children slain.

<span id="vi.iii-p9"></span>He adds, *and his mouth shall speak to thy
mouth,* that is, “Thou shalt hear the dreadful sentence pronounced upon
thee, after thou shalt be convicted of a capital offense; the king
himself shall degrade thee with all possible disgrace.” Now, this was a
harder fate than if Zedekiah had been secretly put to death. He was
dragged into the light; he then underwent many terrible things when led
into the presence of his enemy. This, then, the Prophet related, that
Zedekiah might understand that he in vain defended the city, for its
miserable end was near at hand. He afterwards adds, —

<span id="vi.iv"></span>

<span id="vi.iv-p1"></span><span id="vi.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
34:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#004.md)<span id="vi.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv-p2"></span>**4**. Yet hear the word of the LORD, O
Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die
by the sword:

<span id="vi.iv-p3"></span>**4**. Tamen audi sermonum Jehovae, Zedechia
rex Jehudah, sic dicit Jehova de to, Non morieris gladio;

<span id="vi.iv-p4"></span>**5** *But* thou shalt die in peace: and with
the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so
shall they burn *odours* for thee; and they will lament thee, *saying,*
Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.

<span id="vi.iv-p5"></span>**5**. In pace morieris, et combustionibus
patrum tuorum regum superiorum, qui ruerunt ante re, sic comburent to,
et, Heus domine, plangent super to, quia sermonum ego locutus sum, dicit
Jehova.

<span id="vi.iv-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.iv-p7"></span><span id="vi.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv-p8"></span>Here Jeremiah adds some comfort, even that
Zedekiah himself would not be slain by the sword, but that he would die
in his bed, and, as they commonly say, yield to his fate. It was indeed
some mitigation of punishment, that God extended his life and suffered
him not to be immediately smitten with the sword. And yet if we consider
all circumstances, it would have been a lighter evil at once to be put
to death, than to prolong life on the condition of being doomed to pine
away in constant misery. When the eyes are pulled out, we know that the
principal part of life is lost. When, therefore, this punishment was
inflicted on Zedekiah, was not death desirable? And then he was not only
deprived of his royal dignity, but was bereaved also of all his
offspring, and was afterwards bound with chains. We hence see that what
remained to him was not so much an object of desire, he might have
preferred ten times or a hundred times to die. God, however, designed it
as a favor, that he was not smitten with the sword.

<span id="vi.iv-p9"></span>A question may be here raised, Ought violent
death to be so much dreaded? We indeed know that some heathens have
wished it. They tell us of Julius Caesar, that the day before he was
killed, he disputed at supper what death was the best, and that he
deemed it the easiest death (<span id="vi.iv-p9.1"></span>εὐθανασίαν)
when one is suddenly deprived of life, — the very thing which happened
to him the day after. Thus he seemed to have gained his wish, for he had
said, that it was a happy kind of death to be suddenly extinguished.
There is, however, no doubt but that natural death is always more easy
to be borne, when other things, as they say, are equal; for the feeling
of nature is this, that men always dread a bloody death, and it is
regarded a monstrous thing when human blood is shed; but when any one
dies quietly through disease, as it is a common thing, we do not feel so
much horror. Then time is granted to the sick, to think of God’s hand,
to reflect on the hope of a better life, and also to flee to God’s
mercy, which cannot be done in a violent death. When, therefore, all
these are duly weighed, it ought not to be deemed strange, that God,
willing to mitigate the punishment of Zedekiah, should say, *Thou shaft
not die by the sword, but thou shall die in peace* To die in peace is to
die a natural death, when no violence is used, but when God hhnself
calls men, as though he stretched forth his hand to them. It is indeed
certain, that it is much better for some to be slain by the sword, than
to pine away through disease: for we see that many are either seized
with frenzy on their bed, or rage against God, or remain obstinate:
there are, in short, dreadful examples, which daily occur, where the
Spirit of God does not work nor rule. For there is then no tenderness in
man, especially when he has the fear of death; he then kindles up as it
were into rage against God. But, on the other hand, many who are brought
into affliction, acknowledge themselves to be justly condemned, and at
the same time acknowledge the punishment inflicted to be medicine, in
order that they may obtain mercy before God. To many, then, it is better
to die a violent death than to die in peace; but this happens through
the fault of men: at the same time, natural death, as I have said,
justly deserves to be much preferred to a violent and bloody death, and
I have briefly stated the reasons. The subject might indeed be more
fully handled, but it is enough to touch shortly on the chief point as
the passage requires.

<span id="vi.iv-p10"></span><span id="vi.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv-p11"></span>*In peace,* he says, *shalt thou die,* and
then adds, *with the burnings of thy fathers shall they burn thee, and
lament over thee, “Alas! Lord.”* Here is added another comfort, — that
when Zedekiah should die, there would be some to bury him, not only in a
humane, but also in an honorable manner. And burial in many places is
reckoned as one of God’s favors, as in life God shews himself kind and
bountiful to us when we are in health and in vigor. For as health and
food sufficient for the necessities of life, are evidences of God’s
love, so is burial after death; for burial distinguishes men from
brutes. When a wild beast dies, his carcase is left to putrify. Why are
men buried, except in hope of the resurrection, as though they were laid
up in a safe place till the time of restoration? Burial, then, as it is
a symbol of our immortality, makes a distinction between us and brute
animals after death. In death itself there is no difference; the death
of a man and the death of a dog, have no certain marks to distinguish
the one from the other. Then it is God’s will that there should be some
monument, that men might understand how nmch more excellent: is their
condition than that of brute animals. Hence then it is, that when God
favors us with a burial, he shows his paternal care towards us. On the
contrary, when the body of any one is cast away, it is in itself a sign
of God’s displeasure, as it appeared before, when the Prophet said of
Jehoiakim that his burial would be that of an ass, (<span
id="vi.iv-p11.1"></span>[Jer
22:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#019)<span id="vi.iv-p11.1"></span>.md)
As then Jehoiakim was threatened with the burial of an ass, so now he
promises an honorable burial to Zedekiah.

<span id="vi.iv-p12"></span>I said that this is true, when the thing is
in itself considered. For it sometimes happens that the most wicked are
buried with honor and great pomp, when the children of God are either
burnt or torn by wild beasts. Known is that complaint of the Psalmist,
that the bodies of the saints were cast away and became food to birds
and wild beasts. (<span id="vi.iv-p12.1"></span>[Ps
79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002)<span id="vi.iv-p12.1"></span>.md)
And it is said of the rich man, who lived in splendor, that he died and
was buried, but there is no mention made of the burial of Lazarus.
(<span id="vi.iv-p12.2"></span>[Lu
16:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#022)<span id="vi.iv-p12.2"></span>.md)
We ought not then simply to conclude, that those are miserable who are
not buried, and that those are blessed who obtain the honor of a burial.
As the sun is said to rise on the children of God and on strangers, so
also after death, as burial is a temporal benefit, it may be considered
as belonging indiscriminately to the good and to the bad. It may on the
contrary be, that God should deprive his children of a burial; yet still
that truth remains fixed, that burial in itself is an evidence of God’s
favor; and that; when any one is cast away and denied a burial, it is a
sign of God’s displeasure. When yet we come to individuals, the Lord
turns a temporal punishment into a benefit to his own people; and makes
his temporal blessings to serve for a heavier condemnation to all the
reprobate and ungodly, hence they were barbarous who dared to deride
burial, as the Cynics did, who treated burial with contempt. This was
inhumanity.

<span id="vi.iv-p13"></span>But we ought to hold these points, — that as
God supplies us with bread, wine, and water, and other necessaries of
life, in order to feed us, and to preserve us in health and rigor, so we
ought to regard burial; but when the faithful are exposed to hunger,
when they die through cold or nakedness, or when they are made subject
to other evils, and when they are treated ignominiously after death, all
this turns out for their salvation, for the Lord regards their good even
when he seems to afflict them with adversities.

<span id="vi.iv-p14"></span>This, then, is the reason why the Prophet
now in some measure mitigates the sorrow of Zedekiah, by saying,. *They
shall bury thee, and with the burnings of thy fathers shall they burn
thee* This was not a common but a royal mode of burial. He then
promises, that after many degradations and reproaches, God would at
length shew him, when dead, some favor. But one may say, what would this
avail Zedekiah? for his body would then be without sense or feeling.
But. it was well to hear of this kindness of God, for he might thereby
conclude that God would be at length merciful to him, if he really
humbled himself. There is then no doubt but that a hope of pardon was
promised to him, though he was to be sharply and severely chastised even
until he died. God then intended that this symbol should ever be
remembered by him, that he might not wholly despair. We now then
understand why the Prophet promised this to Zedekiah, not that it might
be a matter of interest to him to be buried with honor, but that he
might have some conception of God’s kindness and mercy.

<span id="vi.iv-p15"></span>Now we know that the dead bodies of kings
were burnt at a great expense; many precious odors were procured, a fire
was kindled, and the bodies were seared; not that they were reduced to
ashes, (for this was not the custom, as among the Romans and other
nations, who burnt the bodies of the dead, and gathered the ashes) But
among the Jews, the body was never burnt; only they kindled a fire
around the dead body, that putrefaction might not take place. The bodies
of the dead were dried by a slow fire. This was not indeed commonly
done, but only at the burials of kings, as it appears from the case of
Asa and of others. (<span id="vi.iv-p15.1"></span>[2Ch
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2016.htm#014)<span id="vi.iv-p15.1"></span>.md)

<span id="vi.iv-p16"></span>Then he says, *With the burnings of thy
fathers* shall they burn thee, and they shall lament *thee, “Alas!
Lord,”* it may be asked, whether these lamentations were approved by
God? To this there is a ready answer, — that the Prophet does not here
commend immoderate mourning, and cryings, and ejaculations, when he
says, *they shall lament thee,* but that he took the expression from
what was commonly done, as though he had said, “They shall perform for
thee this office of humanity, such as is usually done over the remains
of kings in full power, in the day of their prosperity.” God, then, in
speaking here of lamentation and mourning, does not commend them as
virtues, or as worthy of praise, but refers only to what was then
commonly done. But we know what Paul especially teaches us, — that we
are so to moderate our sorrow, as not to be like the unbelieving, who
have no hope, (<span id="vi.iv-p16.1"></span>[1Th
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#013)<span id="vi.iv-p16.1"></span>.md)
for they think that death is the death of the soul as well as of the
body: they therefore lament their dead as for ever lost; and they also
murmur against God, and sometimes utter horrid blasphemies. Paul then
would have us to be moderate in our sorrow. He does not condemn sorrow
altogether, but only requires it to be moderate, so that we may shew
what influence the hope of resurrection has over us.

<span id="vi.iv-p17"></span>And yet there is no doubt but that men, in
this respect, exceed moderation. It has commonly been the case almost in
all ages to be ostentatious in mourning for the dead. For not only are
they without genuine feeling in lamenting for their friends or
relatives, but they are carried away by a sort of ambition, while
burying the dead with great noise and lamentation. When they are alone
they contain themselves, so that at least they make no noise; but when
they go out before others, they break forth into noisy lamentations. It
hence appears that, as I have said, mourning is often ostentatious. But
as men have from the beginning gone astray in this respect, greater care
ought to be taken by us, that each of us may check and restrain himself.
Still it is natural, as I have said, to weep for the dead; but
doubtless, it may be said, the ejaculations mentioned by the Prophet
cannot be approved; for to what purpose was it to cry, “Alas! Lord; our
king is dead,” and things of the same kind? But we ought to bear in
mind, that eastern nations were always excessive in this respect, and we
find them to be so at this day. The warmer the climate the more given to
gestures and ceremonies the people are. In these cold regions
gesticulations and crying out, “Alas! Lord, alas! father,” would be
deemed impertinent and foolish. But where they tear off their hair, and
also cut themselves and tear their cheeks not only with their nails, but
also with knives, — where they do these things, they also utter these
ejaculations spoken of by the Prophet.

<span id="vi.v"></span>

<span id="vi.v-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vi.v-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as it is ever
expedient for us to be often chastised by thine hand, — O grant, that we
may learn to bear thy scourges patiently, and with quiet minds, and so
acknowledge our sins, that we may not at the same time doubt but that
thou wilt be merciful to us, and that we may with this confidence ever
flee to seek pardon, and that it may avail also to increase our
repentance, so that we may strive more and more to put off all the vices
of the flesh, and to put on the new man, so that thine image may be
renewed in us, until we shall at length come to partake of that eternal
glory, which thou hast prepared in heaven for us, through Christ thy
Son. — Amen.

these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,

<span id="vi.vii-p3"></span>**6**. Et loquutus est Jeremias Propheta ad

fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were
left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities
remained of the cities of Judah.

<span id="vi.vii-p5"></span>**7**. Et exercitus regis Babylonii
pugnabant *(hoc est,* oppugnabant) Jerusalem et onmes urbes Jehudah quae
residuae erant, nempe Lachis et Azekah, quoniam ipsae restabant in

<span id="vi.vii-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.vii-p7"></span><span id="vi.vii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii-p8"></span>Here Jeremiah only relates that he had
delivered the message committed to him; and here is seen the Prophet’s
magnanimity, for as it appeared yesterday, he was an unwelcome
messenger; and though there was danger, yet Jeremiah performed his
office, for he knew that God would not suffer the king to do anything to
him unless it were for some benefit. There is then no doubt but that he
deposited his life in God’s hand, and offered himself, as it were, a
sacrifice, when he dared openly to threaten the king, which could not
have been done without offending him; and

<span id="vi.vii-p9"></span>“the wrath of a king,” as Solomon says,  
“is the messenger of death.” (<span id="vi.vii-p9.2"></span>[Pr
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#014)<span id="vi.vii-p9.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vi.vii-p10"></span>Here, then, the firmness of the Prophet is
deserving of praise; for he dreaded no danger when he saw that necessity
was laid on him by God.

<span id="vi.vii-p11"></span><span id="vi.vii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii-p12"></span>He again repeats that Jerusalem was then
surrounded by *the army of the king of Babylon,* as well as the other
cities of Judah, which he names, even *Lachish* and *Azekah.* He seems,
therefore, indirectly to reprove the arrogance of Zedekiah, for he still
retained his high spirits, when yet he was reduced to such straits. All
the cities of Judah, — how many were they? Two, says the Prophet. This,
then, was no unsuitable way of indirectly exposing to ridicule the vain
confidence of the king, who still thought that he could overcome the
enemy, though he was master only of three cities, that is, Jerusalem,
Lachish, and Azekah. But the Prophet gives a reason why these cities did
not immediately fall into the hands of the king of Babylon, because they
were *fortified.* It hence follows, that the other cities were taken
without trouble, or that they surrendered of their own accord. Zedekiah
the king was then deprived of his power, and yet he had not relinquished
the ferocity of his mind, nor was he terrified by the threatenings of
the Prophet; and this was a proof of extreme madness. For he hence
appears that he was alienated in mind; for. the dreadful hand of God was
put forth against him, and yet he rushed headlong to his own ruin as a
wild beast destitute of reason. Let us proceed, —

<span id="vi.viii-p1"></span><span id="vi.viii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah

<span id="vi.viii-p2"></span>**8** *This is* the word that came unto
Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant
with all the people which *were* at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto
them;

<span id="vi.viii-p3"></span>**8**. Sermo qui factus est ad Jeremiam a
Jehova, postquam percussit rex Zedechias foedus cum toto popalo, qui
erant in Jerusalem, ad promulgandum ipsis (hoc est, inter ipsos)
libertatem;

<span id="vi.viii-p4"></span>**9**. That every man should let his
manservant, and every man his maidservant, *being* an Hebrew or an
Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, *to wit,* of
a Jew his brother.

<span id="vi.viii-p5"></span>**9**. Ut dimitteret quisque servum suum,
et quisque ancillam suam (vir, vir, ad verbum, sed significat quisque
indefinite) Hebraeum vel Hebraeum liberos, ut ne ultra servirent ipsis
(vel, transitive, ut alii malunt et bene quadrat, ut non haberent cos
servos) inter Judaeos vir fratrem suum.

<span id="vi.viii-p6"></span>**10**. Now when all the princes, and all
the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one
should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that
none should serve themselves of them any more; then they obeyed, and let
*them* go.

<span id="vi.viii-p7"></span>**10**. Et audierunt omnes principes et
torus populus, qui venerant ad foedus, ut dimitteret servum suum et
ancillam suam liberos, ut ne servirent amplius ipsis (vel, ut ne
dominarentur) et obedierunt et dimiserunt.

<span id="vi.viii-p8"></span>**11**. But afterward they turned, and
caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to
return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.

<span id="vi.viii-p9"></span>**11**. Et reversi aunt (hoc est, mutarunt
concilium) postea, et reduxerunt servos suos et ancillas suas quos
dimiserant liberos et subegerunt cos in servos et ancillas.

<span id="vi.viii-p10"></span>**12**. Therefore the word of the LORD
came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

<span id="vi.viii-p11"></span>**12**. Et fuit sermo Jehovae ad Jeremiam
a Jehova, dicendo, (hoec necessario contexere oportet)

<span id="vi.viii-p12"></span>**13**. Thus saith the LORD, the God of
Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought
them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen,
saying,

<span id="vi.viii-p13"></span>**13**. Sic dicit Jehova, Deus Israel, Ego
percussi foedus cum pattibus vestris die quo eduxi ipsos e terra Egypti,
e domo servorum, dicendo,

<span id="vi.viii-p14"></span>**14**. At the end of seven years let ye
go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and
when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from
thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their
ear.

<span id="vi.viii-p15"></span>**14**. A fine septem annorum dimittetis
quisque fratrem suum Hebraeum, qui venditus tibi fuerit et serviret tibi
sex annis, et dimittes liberum abesse tecum (hoc est, ut non sit amplius
tecum, vel apud to) et non audierunt patres vestri me, et non
inclinarunt aurem suam.

<span id="vi.viii-p16"></span>**15**. And ye were now turned, and had
done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his
neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is
called by my name:

<span id="vi.viii-p17"></span>**15**. Et conversi estis vos hodie, et
fecistis quod rectum erat in oculis meis, promulgando libertatem quisque
proximo suo, et pepigistis foedus coram facie mea in domo super quam
invocatum est nomen meum:

<span id="vi.viii-p18"></span>**16**. But ye turned and polluted my
name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom
ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them
into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.

<span id="vi.viii-p19"></span>**16**. Et reversi estis (hoc est,
mutastis consilium) et profanastis nomen meum, et reduxistis quisque
servum suum, et quisque ancillam suam, quos dimiseratis liberos animae
suae, (hoc est, ad arbitrium suum) et subegistis ipsos ut essent vobis
in servos et ancillas.

<span id="vi.viii-p20"></span>**17**. Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye
have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his
brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty
for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the
famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the
earth.

<span id="vi.viii-p21"></span>**17**. Propterea sic dicit Jehova, Vos
non audistis ad promulgandum libertatem quisque fratri suo, et quisque
proximo suo, ecce ego pro-mulgo contra vos libertatem, dicit Jehova,
gladio et pesti et fatal, et dabo vos in commotionum (vel,
con-cussionem) cunctis regnis terrae.

<span id="vi.viii-p22"></span> 

<span id="vi.viii-p23"></span>Though we do not read that what the
Prophet relates here was done by God’s command, yet we may easily gather
that Zedekiah the king had been admonished to liberate the servants
according to the Law, as written in <span id="vi.viii-p23.1"></span>[Ex
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002.md)<span id="vi.viii-p23.1"></span>.
It was God’s will that some difference should be between the people he
had adopted and other nations; for God had chosen the seed of Abraham as
his peculiar treasure, and other nations were in this respect aliens. It
was therefore his will to establish this law among the people of Israel,
that servitude should not be perpetual, except one bound himself
willingly, of his own accord, through his whole life, according to what
we read in <span id="vi.viii-p23.2"></span>[Deut.
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#017.md)<span id="vi.viii-p23.2"></span>;
for when one of an ignoble mind deprived himself of the benefit of this
law, his master bored his ear with an awl; and having this mark, he
could no longer become free, except, perhaps, he lived to the jubilee
year. By the words of the Prophet we learn that this command of the Law
had been disregarded, for at the end of the seventh year the servants
were not made free. Hence the King Zedekiah, having been warned on the
subject, called the people together, and by the consent of all, liberty
was proclaimed, according to what God had commanded. But this was done
in bad faith, for soon after the servants were remanded, and thus
treachery was added to cruelty. They had before unjustly oppressed their
brethren, but now perjury was heaped on wickedness. We hence see that
they not only wronged their own brethren, by imposing on them perpetual
servitude, but they also wickedly profaned the sacred name of God,
having thus violated a solemn oath.

<span id="vi.viii-p24"></span>Now, Jeremiah says that he was *sent* at
the time when, by a wicked perjury, the people began to oppress again
their servants and their maids. He therefore says, that the word of
Jehovah came to him *after the covenant* was made. A covenant he calls
that solemn agreement when God’s Law was revived, that servitude should
not be perpetual among the people of Israel. And he expresses the same
thing when he says, that *a covenant was made with all the people who
were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them* Some take “to them,”
<span id="vi.viii-p24.1"></span>להם, *laem,* as referring to the
servants and maids, but we may take it as meaning *among them,* so that
the Law should be in force, not only for the present, but perpetually.
Then follows what sort of liberty it was to be, even *that every one
should let free his servant, and every one should let free his maid, a
Hebrew or a Hebrewess, so that they should not serve* Some take the verb
<span id="vi.viii-p24.2"></span>עבר *ober,* in an intransitive, and
others in a transitive sense, as we say in French, *Qu’ils ne leur
fussent plus serfs,* ou, *Qu’ils ne se servissent plus d’eux.* As to the
main point there is not much difference. If we take <span
id="vi.viii-p24.3"></span>עבר *ober,* in the sense of *serving,* we must
read thus, “That they may not serve,” or, “That they may not be their
servants.” But if we take <span id="vi.viii-p24.4"></span>עבר *ober, in*
the sense of *ruling,* it must be read thus, *That no man,* that is,
that no one *may rule over them,* that is, over his Jewish brother, or,
*That no man among them should serve,* that is, his Jewish brother.
 <span id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md)

<span id="vi.viii-p28"></span>Here a question arises, Is perpetual
servitude so displeasing to God, that it ought not to be deemed lawful?
To this the answer is easy, — Abraham and other fathers had servants or
slaves according to the common and prevailing custom, and it was not
deemed wrong in them. Before the Law was given, there was nothing to
forbid one who had servants or maids to exercise power over them through
life; and then the Law, mentioned here, was not given indiscriminately
and generally, but it was a peculiar privilege in favor of the chosen
people. Hence it is without reason that any one infers that it is not
lawful to exercise power over servants and maids; for, on the contrary,
we may reason thus, That since God permitted the fathers to remain
servants and maids, it is a thing lawful; and further, as God permitted
the Jews also, under the Law, to bear rule over aliens, and to keep them
perpetually as servants, it follows that this cannot be disapproved. And
still a clearer evidence may be adduced; for since the Gentiles have
been called to the hope of salvation, no change has in this respect been
made. For the Apostles did not constrain masters to liberate their
servants, but only exhorted them to use kindness towards them, and to
treat them humanely as their fellow-servants. (<span
id="vi.viii-p28.1"></span>[Eph
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009.md)<span id="vi.viii-p28.1"></span>;
<span id="vi.viii-p28.2"></span>[Col
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001)<span id="vi.viii-p28.2"></span>.md)
If, then, servitude were unlawful, the Apostles would have never
tolerated it; but they would have boldly denounced such a profane
practice had it been so. Now, as they commanded masters only to be
humane towards their servants, and not to treat them violently and
reproachfully, it follows that what was not denied was permitted, that
is, to retain their own servants. We also see that Paul sent back
Onesimus to Philemon. (<span id="vi.viii-p28.3"></span>[Phm
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#012)<span id="vi.viii-p28.3"></span>.md)
Philemon was not only one of the faithful, but a pastor of the Church.
He ought, then, to have been an example to others. His servant had fled
away from him; Paul sent him back, and commended him to his master, and
besought his master to forgive his theft. We hence see that the thing in
itself is not unlawful.

<span id="vi.viii-p29"></span>Our servitudes have been abolished, that
is, that miserable condition when one had no right of his own, but when
the master had power over life and death; that custom has ceased, and
the abolition cannot be blamed. Some superstition might have been at the
beginning; and I certainly think that the commencement of the change
arose from superstition. It is, however, by no means to be wished that
there should be slaves among us, as there were formerly among all
nations, and as there are now among barbarians. The Spaniards know what
servitude is, for they are near neighbors to the Africans and the Turks;
and then those they take in war they sell; and as one evil proceeds from
another, so they retain miserable men as slaves throughout life. But as
no necessity constrains us, our condition, as I have said, is better,
that is, in having hired servants and not slaves; for those called
servants at this day are only hired servants.

<span id="vi.viii-p30"></span>When heathens commended humanity and
kindness towards servants, they said, Let them not be treated as
servants, but as those who are hired. So also Cicero said. (Off. 1) he
distinguished between servants and such as were hired, he calls the
first slaves, that is, those who were under the power of another, and
those hired servants who undertook to work for hire, as the case is with
us.

<span id="vi.viii-p31"></span>But as I have already said, the practice
among the chosen people was peculiar. For it was the Lord’s will that
those whom he had redeemed should remain free and enjoy in this respect
the benefits of freedom. That there might then be a memorial of God’s
favor among the people of Israel, it was the Lord’s will that servitude
among them should be temporary, even for six years only. And as the law
had been disregarded, Zedekiah exhorted the people to set free their
servants. But there is no doubt but that God at the same time made it
known, that external enemies justly exercised cruelty towards the
people, because they themselves shewed no commiseration towards their
own brethren. For when they ruled over their servants according to their
own wantonness, they in vain complained of the Chaldeans or of the
Assyrians, they in vain proclaimed that they were unjustly oppressed, or
that the people of God were harassed by the violence of a tyrannical
power; for the first originators of cruelty were themselves, and not the
Chaldeans or the Assyrians. It was then on this account that Zedekiah
was induced to call the people together, and that by a public act all
the servants were set free.

<span id="vi.viii-p32"></span><span id="vi.viii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p33"></span>He says, that all *the princes and all the
people heard, who had come to the covenant, that every one should let
his servant free, etc*.; and then he adds, *And they obeyed* The verb
<span id="vi.viii-p33.1"></span>שמע, *shemo,* is to be taken in a
twofold sense; at the beginning of the verse it refers to the simple act
of hearing, and at the end of the verse, to obedience. Then he says that
they *obeyed,* and that every one set free his servant. By saying that
the princes, as well as all the people, heard, he took away every
pretense as to ignorance; so that they could not make an excuse, that
they relapsed through want of knowledge or through inconsideration. How
so? because they had *heard;* nor is it to be doubted, but that the Law
of God to which we have referred, had been set before them, that they
might be ashamed of the iniquity and tyrannical violence which they had
exercised towards their servants. The hearing then mentioned here,
proves that the Jews were wholly inexcusable, for they saw that God’s
Law had been long disregarded by them. And hence we learn, that each of
them had sinned the more grievously, as he had been taught what was
right, and had, as it were, designedly cast off the yoke. So also Christ
teaches us, that the servant who knows his master’s will and does it
not, shall be more severely punished than one who offends through
ignorance. (<span id="vi.viii-p33.2"></span>[Lu
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047)<span id="vi.viii-p33.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vi.viii-p34"></span><span id="vi.viii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p35"></span>He then adds, *And they afterwards
turned,* that is, after they had heard and obeyed. The turning refers to
a change of purpose, for they immediately repented of what they had
done. They had felt some fear of God, and then equity and kindness
prevailed; but they soon turned or changed. The word is taken sometimes
in a good, and sometimes in a bad sense. He says that they *turned,* or
returned, because they receded or turned back after having commenced a
right course. *And they remanded;* there is a correspondence between the
verbs <span id="vi.viii-p35.1"></span>ישובו *ishibu,* they *turned,* and
<span id="vi.viii-p35.2"></span>ישיבו *ishibu,* they *remanded,* or made
to return *the servants and maids whom they let go free, and brought
them under as servants and maids* There is no doubt but that the Jews
alleged some excuse when they thus remanded their servants, and robbed
them of the privilege of freedom: but God designed that they should act
in sincerity and without disguise. Whatever, then, subtle men may
contrive as an excuse for oppressing the miserable, and however they may
disguise things before men, yet God, who requires integrity, does not
allow such disguises, for he would have us to deal honestly with our
neighbors, for all craftiness is condemned by him.

<span id="vi.viii-p36"></span><span id="vi.viii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p37"></span>Now follows the message: The Prophet had,
indeed, said that the word of God had been committed to him, but he
interposed this narrative, that we might know for what reason God had
sent this message to the Jews. For if he had thus begun, “The word came
to Jeremiah from Jehovah,” and then added, “Thus saith Jehovah, the God
of Israel, I have made a covenant,” etc., the passage would have been
more obscure. It was therefore necessary that the narrative should come
first, and with this the Prophet’s message was connected, even that the
Jews had added perjury to cruelty, and thus had committed a heinous
iniquity. The Prophet now then comes to close quarters with them, and
introduces God as the speaker, *I made a covenant with your fathers the
day I brought them up from the land of Egypt, from the house of
servants*

<span id="vi.viii-p38"></span>God reminded the Jews of their own law;
and though he might have justly required whatever he pleased, yet he
proved that the Israelites were bound to him, because he *brought then,
out of the house of servants* Who can dare to arrogate to himself
dominion over others, who is himself a servant? for there cannot be
dominion where there is no liberty. Any one may be free, though without
a servant; but no one can be a master except he be free. So God declares
that the Israelites were not once free, for they were in a miserable
state of servitude, when he stretched out his hand to them. Whence then
came liberty to the Israelites? even from the gratuitous mercy of God,
who made them free, who brought them forth from tyranny in Egypt. It
hence follows, that they could not be masters over others, since they
themselves were servants. This is the reason why he says that he *made a
covenant the day he brought them up from the house of servants,* as
though he had said, that they came forth from their prisons, because he
had been pleased to draw them out, not that they might domineer for ever
over their brethren, but only for a time. He relates here the law given
by Moses in <span id="vi.viii-p38.1"></span>[Exodus
21](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.viii-p38.1"></span>, as
we have stated. At *the end of seven, years*  <span
id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md) *every one shall set free his brother, a
Hebrew, who had been sold to him, and him who has served him six years
he shall let free from him,* that is, that he should not be with him;
*but your fathers hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear* The
Israelites at first, no doubt, submitted to what God had commanded, but
shortly after the law was disregarded. When, therefore, he complains
here that his voice was not hearkened to, it ought not to be so
generally understood, as that the Law had been at all times disregarded;
but it is the same as though he had said, “Your fathers formerly were
disobedient, because they did not set free their servants within the
prescribed time, at the end of the sixth year.”

<span id="vi.viii-p40"></span><span id="vi.viii-p40.1"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p41"></span>This passage, as many others, clearly
shews the great perverseness of the people. Certainly the Law spoken of
here ought to have been well approved by the Jews, for they found that
they were by a privilege exempted from the common lot of men, and had
been preferred before all nations. As, then, they saw that it was a
signal evidence of God’s bounty towards the seed of Abraham, this ought
to have allured them to observe the Law, inasmuch as they found in it
what was especially suitable to them; but as every one became addicted
to his own private advantage, the poor were oppressed, and a temporary
servitude was changed into what was perpetual. There is no wonder then
that men soon forgot what was right, though they seemed to have
hearkened for a short time to God. It has been the common vice of all
ages that the laws of God became soon forgotten and disregarded; so the
law of freedom, though especially excellent, became, as we see,
neglected.

<span id="vi.viii-p42"></span>He adds, *Nor inclined their ear* We have
stated elsewhere that this phrase is emphatic, when added to the
expression of not hearkening; for it is a proof of deliberate
wickedness, when men close up their ears, and listen not to what is
right. It is possible for one to neglect what is said, or not to
understand it; but when one intentionally closes his ears, it is a proof
of hopeless obstinacy. God, then, is wont to express by this mode of
speaking, the perverseness and hardness that prevailed in the ancient
people, through which they rejected all sound doctrine. And this ought
to be carefully noticed; for where the word of God is made clearly
known, in vain we excuse ourselves for not following what he commands,
for he speaks not obscurely, as he says by Isaiah. (<span
id="vi.viii-p42.1"></span>[Isa
45:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019)<span id="vi.viii-p42.1"></span>.md)
How comes it, then, that doctrine does not produce fruit in us? even
because we wilfully reject it, closing our cars and disregarding God
himself when he speaks. Now the reason why God brings a charge against
the fathers is, that the comparison might enhance the wickedness of
their children, who, after having professed that they had some regard
for religion and some feeling of mercy, soon returned to their old ways,
according to what follows —

<span id="vi.viii-p43"></span><span id="vi.viii-p43.1"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p44"></span>*And ye now turned, and did what was right
in my eyes, by proclaiming liberty every one to his neighbor:* God seems
at first to commend the people; and no doubt it ought to have been
deemed praiseworthy, that the people, after having been reminded that
they had perversely disregarded God’s law, willingly engaged in doing
their duty; but as they gave but a false proof of repentance, and did
not really perform what they had promised, it was, as I have said, a
great aggravation of their crime. So then God commended the repentance
of the people, in order to shew how detestable is hypocrisy; for they
shewed for a short time some feeling of humanity, but soon after proved
that it was nothing but dissimulation. He therefore says, that they *did
what was right by proclaiming liberty* And hence it also appears that
they had not gone astray through ignorance, for God had required this
kindness from them, that is, to restore what had been wickedly taken
away from servants and maids, and to let them free again: except they
had been constrained by the clear testimony of the Law, they would have
never thus given up their private advantages. But after having made a
pretense that they wished to obey God, they again soon remanded their
servants and their maids. It hence appears evident that they trifled
with God, and that it was a mere fraud to set free their servant only
for a short time.

<span id="vi.viii-p45"></span>He says that they *made a covenant in the
house on which his name* had been *called,* and also, that they had
*profaned* his *name* All this added to their wickedness; for not only
liberty had been proclaimed and confirmed by an oath, but this had also
been done in the Temple. Hence he aggravates the sin of the people by
this circumstance, — that they had made the covenant which they
afterwards violated in the presence of God. For though the eyes of God
penetrate into the most hidden recesses, yet the wickedness of the
people became greater, and it was an evidence of men lost to all shame,
that they dared to violate their pledged faith, and thus to shew no
regard for the Temple, as though they had lost all reverence for God and
all fear. It is hence evident how profane they were become, that they
dared to come to the Temple and to make an oath before God, and then
immediately to forfeit their faith.

<span id="vi.ix"></span>

<span id="vi.ix-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vi.ix-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since we have been
redeemed by thine only-begotten Son, not only from temporal servitude,
but also from the miserable tyranny of the devil and death, — O grant,
that we may acknowledge thee as our Deliverer, and so wholly devote
ourselves to thee, that we may also labor to serve one another, and by
mutual acts of kindness so cherish among ourselves brotherly love, that
it may appear that thou indeed rulest among us, and that we are subject
to thee through the same thy Son. — Amen.

and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he
had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into
subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.

<span id="vi.xi-p3"></span>**16**. Et reversi estis et polluistis nomen
meum, et reduxistis quisque servum suum, et quisque ancillam suam, quos
dimiseratis liberas animae suae *(id est,* arbitrio suo) et subegistis
eos, ut essent vobis in servos et in ancillas.

<span id="vi.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xi-p5"></span><span id="vi.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xi-p6"></span>The Prophet expostulates here with the Jews,
as we said in the last Lecture, with regard to their perjury; for they
had made in a solemn manner a covenant in the Temple of God, to set free
their servants according to what the law prescribed. There would have
been no need of such a ceremony, had they observed what they learnt from
the Law; but neither they nor their fathers observed the equity
prescribed to them by God. Hence there was a necessity for a new
promise, sanctioned by sacrifice. The Prophet commended them for obeying
God’s command. But he now shews, that they were the more inexcusable,
because they soon after returned to their old ways. *But ye turned,* he
says, that is, they soon repented of the obedience they had promised to
render to God. Their promptitude was worthy of praise, when they
promised that they would willingly obey; but by doing this in bad faith,
they treated God with mockery.

<span id="vi.xi-p7"></span>He adds that God’s *name was polluted* We
hence learn that whenever we misuse God’s name, it is a kind of
sacrilege; for nothing is deemed more precious by God than truth; yea,
as he himself is truth, and is so called, (<span
id="vi.xi-p7.1"></span>[Joh 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p7.1"></span>) there is nothing more adverse to his nature
than falsehood. It is then an intolerable profanation of God’s name
whenever it is falsely appealed to; and thus perjury is allied with
sacrilege. God’s name is indeed polluted in other ways than by perjury,
that is, when God’s name is taken in vain rashly, thoughtlessly, and
without reverence. But the most heinous pollution of it is, when the
truth is changed into a lie. This passage then contains a useful
doctrine, which teaches us to act faithfully, especially when God’s name
is interposed.

<span id="vi.xi-p8"></span>He afterwards adds, *Ye have remanded every
one his servant and every one his maid, whom ye have set free, etc.* The
crime was doubled by this circumstance, — that they had emancipated
their servants, and then remanded them. For had they not dissembled,
their obstinacy could by no means have been tolerated; but their
rebellion became still more base, when they had pretended to obey God,
and it became shortly known that they had perfidiously promised liberty
to their servants. He says that they were *set free to their own soul,*
that is, to their own will; for we call men free when it is in their
power to choose what they please, for when they are under the power of
another, they have no will, no choice of their own.  <span
id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) And indignity is increased, when servants
who have been made free are afterwards deprived of so great a privilege;
for nothing is more desirable than liberty, as even heathens have
declared. He adds that this was done by force, *Ye have made them
subject* The verb <span id="vi.xi-p9.2"></span>כבש *cabesh,* means to
subject and to oppress. The Prophet then shews, that those who had been
made free, were not willing to return to their miserable condition, and
that they were not constrained to submit to the yoke in any other way
than by tyranny.  <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) It hence appears
that their masters not only employed deceit, but also cruel and
tyrannical violence; so that to perjury they added inhumanity, which
more increased their crime. It now follows, —

<span id="vi.xii"></span>

<span id="vi.xii-p1"></span><span id="vi.xii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#017.md)<span id="vi.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xii-p2"></span>**17**. Therefore thus saith the LORD, Ye
have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his
brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty
for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the
famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the
earth.

<span id="vi.xii-p3"></span>**17**. Propterea sic dicit Jehova, Vos non
audistis me ad promulgandam (hoc est, ut promulgaretis) libertatem
quisque fratri suo, et quisque proximo suo (vel, propinquo, vel, sodali
suo) ecce promulgo contra vos libertatem, dicit Jehova, gladio, pesti et
fami, et dabo vos in commotionum cunctis regnis terrae (alii vertunt,
ecce promulgo vobis libertatem ad gladium et ad pestera et ad famem;
quantum ad summam rei pertinet, non multum est discriminis utrumvis
legamus, nempe, promulgo vobis libertatem ad, etc., vel, promulgo contra
vos libertatem gladio, etc., ut videbimus)

<span id="vi.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xii-p5"></span><span id="vi.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xii-p6"></span>Here the Prophet shews that a just reward
was prepared for the Jews, who robbed their brethren of the privilege of
freedom, for they also would have in their turn to serve after the Lord
had made them free. But he alludes to the way then in use in which they
had granted freedom, and says, *Ye have not proclaimed liberty* They had
indeed proclaimed it, as we have seen; but not in sincerity, for they
who had been for a short time made free, were soon afterwards
constrained to serve. God then makes here no reference to the outward
act which the Jews had performed, but shews that faithfulness and
integrity are so pleasing to him, that he makes no account of what is
merely done outwardly. Hence the promulgation of liberty is not before
God the verbal one, but that which is carried into effect. With men it
is enough to profess a thing, but God regards as nothing all false
professions. He therefore complains that the Jews did not obey his word.
We have already said that it was not right according to the law to
retain servants longer than six years; for in the seventh year the law
ordered those who had given themselves up to servitude to be set free.
But God restored this law as it were by way of recovery, as it had
become almost obsolete. And this is the reason why he says that they
*hearkened not* For he had not only taught by Moses what was right, but
had also shewn by Jeremiah that the Jews impiously and wickedly
disregarded this humane command. We hence learn what it is to obey God’s
word, even when we not only embrace what he declares, but also persevere
in obedience to him: for it is not enough to exhibit some kind of a
right feeling for a short time, except we continue to obey God. The Jews
had with their mouth made a profession, and gave some evidence of a
disposition to obey; the servants were allowed their liberty; but as the
masters shortly after returned to their previous injustice, we see the
reason why God says that they had *not hearkened to him*

<span id="vi.xii-p7"></span>It is added, that he would *proclaim liberty
to them,* that is, against them. If we read, “Behold, I proclaim liberty
to you,” then the meaning is, “I will emancipate you,” that is, “I shall
have nothing more to do with you; go and enjoy your own liberty; but ye
shall immediately become a prey to other masters, even to the sword, to
the pestilence, and to famine.” This meaning is not unsuitable; for it
was the happiness of the ancient people alone to be under the protection
of God: but when they became disobedient, he dismissed them, and would
not have them under his guardianship. But nothing can be more miserable
than such emancipation, that is, when God rejects those over whom he had
been pleased to rule, and whose patron he had for a time been; for all
kinds of evils will soon come upon them, and God will not interpose his
hand. This, then, is the liberty of those who are not willing to bear,
as it becomes them, the yoke of obedience to God, even to be exposed to
all evils, for it is only by him we can be defended. We hence see that
the meaning is very suitable, when we read “Behold, I proclaim to you
liberty, but it is to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine.”

<span id="vi.xii-p8"></span>We may, however, take another view, “Behold,
I proclaim liberty for you,” that is, against you; for <span
id="vi.xii-p8.1"></span>ל*, lamed,* has this sense: “I proclaim liberty
against you,” — how? to the sword, etc., that is, “I order the sword to
exercise power against you, and I will permit also the same right to the
pestilence, and I will permit a like dominion to the famine: the sword,
then, and the pestilence, and the famine, shall rule over you, for ye
cannot bear my authority.” For though the Jews boasted that they were
God’s chosen people, yet as they were so refractory as to despise the
Law and the Prophet, it is quite evident that what they wished was
unbridled licentiousness. God then renounces here his own right, and
says that it was their fault that they were not free, for he would no
more defend them, as an advocate his clients, or as a master his
servants. So also it is said in the Psalms,

<span id="vi.xii-p9"></span>“Behold, our eyes are to God, as the eyes of
servants who look to their masters, as the eyes of a maid to her
mistress.” *  
*(<span id="vi.xii-p9.2"></span>[Ps.
123:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#002)<span id="vi.xii-p9.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vi.xii-p10"></span>We indeed know that servants formerly were
exposed to all sorts of wrongs; they dared not move a finger, when
grievously treated; but if any servant was wronged by another man, his
master would undertake his cause and defend him. Then the Psalmist
compares the people to servants and slaves, and says that their whole
safety depended on the help of God. But God now declares that he will be
no longer their guardian; and when he dismissed them, all kinds of
evils, as we have said, would come upon them, even the sword, the
pestilence, and the famine.

<span id="vi.xii-p11"></span>He at length adds, *And I will give you for
a commotion to all the kingdoms of the earth* The words may mean two
things. Some take them as though God threatened that they should become
unsettled, and vagrants through all the kingdoms of the world; and
others, that they would be for a commotion, for every one either seeing
or hearing of their miserable state would tremble. The passage is taken
from <span id="vi.xii-p11.1"></span>[De
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025.md)<span id="vi.xii-p11.1"></span>,
where we read,

<span id="vi.xii-p12"></span>“I will give thee for a commotion.”

<span id="vi.xii-p13"></span>The latter meaning is what I mostly
approve, — that the Jews would *be for a commotion;* for the vengeance
which God would take on them would be so dreadful, that all would be
greatly moved or affected, according to what is said by Isaiah,

<span id="vi.xii-p14"></span>“The, commotion shall be for amazement.”
(<span id="vi.xii-p14.1"></span>[Isa
28:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#019)<span id="vi.xii-p14.1"></span>.md)

<span id="vi.xii-p15"></span>We then perceive what the Prophet means, —
that God would so severely punish perjury and treachery, that the Jews
would become an example to all people; for it would be a sad spectacle
for all nations to see the children of Abraham, whom God had adopted,
the most miserable of human beings. Their condition, then, would be an
object of horror; and this is what the Prophet now declares and
threatens. It follows, —

<span id="vi.xiii"></span>

<span id="vi.xiii-p1"></span><span id="vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
34:18-19](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xiii-p2"></span>**18**. And I will give the men that have
transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the
covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain,
and passed between the part thereof,

<span id="vi.xiii-p3"></span>**18**. Et dabo viros qui transgressi sunt
foedus meum, qui non stabilierunt sermones foederis, quod inciderunt
coram me, vitulo quem conciderunt in duo, et transierunt inter partes
ejus,

<span id="vi.xiii-p4"></span>**19**. The princes of Judah, and the
princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people
of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;

<span id="vi.xiii-p5"></span>**19**. Principes Jehudah et principes
Jerusalem, proceres (eunuchos) et sacerdotes, et totum populum terrae,
qui transierunt inter partes vituli.

<span id="vi.xiii-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.xiii-p7"></span><span id="vi.xiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xiii-p8"></span>He pursues the same subject, — that perjury
would not be unpunished. But here is described the manner of making an
oath, even that they *cut a calf into two parts, and passed between
these parts* Now we know that this was the custom in the time of
Abraham, for it is said that he offered a sacrifice to God as a symbol
of the covenant, and cut the victim, and passed between the parts.
Historians also relate that the Macedonians in mustering an army
observed the same ceremony; and it was probably a custom which prevailed
among all nations. When the Romans made a covenant, they sacrificed a
sow; they did not divide it into parts, but killed it with a stone; and
this was the form of execration, — “So may Jupiter smite him who will
violate this covenant; if I violate this covenant, may Jupiter thus
smite me, as I now kill this sow.” But we see that among the Orientals,
the victims were cut in two, and there was another form of execration,
even that he might be thus cut asunder, who unjustly and in bad faith
violated the given promise or engagement.

<span id="vi.xiii-p9"></span>It is to this custom the Prophet refers
here, and says, I *will give the men who have transgressed my covenant,
which they made before me by the calf which they cut into two parts, and
passed between the parts,* etc. But God assigns a reason why he resolved
to inflict so dreadful punishment on perjury: he said before, that his
name was profaned, and now he adds, that his covenant was violated. He
does not speak here of the Law; the covenant of God is called the law
for the most part in Scripture; but Jeremiah takes it here in a
different sense, even the covenant in which God’s name was interposed,
or what was sanctioned by an appeal to God, as by way of excellence,
marriage is called by Solomon the covenant of God, because it is the
principal contract among men. But as the Jews had promised in God’s
presence that they were ready to obey, when Jeremiah commanded the
servants to be made free, and as the agreement was confirmed by a solemn
rite, hence the promise given to men is said to be the covenant of God,
even on account of the sanction which we have mentioned.

<span id="vi.xiii-p10"></span>Let us then remember, that whenever we
perform not what we have pledged, not only wrong is done to men, but
also to God himself, and that it is a sacrilege, and what is much more
atrocious than theft, or fraud, or cruelty. Let us, therefore, learn
from this passage to act in good faith, especially when the name of God
is invoked, when he is appealed to as a witness and judge.

<span id="vi.xiii-p11"></span>He adds afterwards, that they had
*transgressed his covenant;* and he immediately explains himself,
*because they have not confirmed the words of the covenant* which *they
had made before* him. To confirm or establish the words, was to
persevere in what they had promised. For the Jews gave a proof of
humanity for a short time; but it was a mere falacious show and
pretense. It was for this reason, then, that the Prophet says that they
had not *confirmed* or ratified *the words of the covenant which they
had made* Then follows the outward ceremony, the *calf* which they had
cut into two parts; and they passed between them, in order that this
very passing might produce a deep impression on their hearts, and make
them dread the violation of their faith. For we know that external signs
are intended for this end, — that men may be kept awake, who would
otherwise be tardy and slothful. The same also is the use of sacred
symbols, by which God intends to touch and move all our senses. It hence
appears how great must have been the insensibility of the people, when
they afterwards disregarded that awful protest, for they had *passed
between the parts,* and imprecated such a death on themselves if they
failed in what they promised. They afterwards hesitated not to violate
their promise. We hence see that they were under the power of a
diabolical madness, when they disregarded God’s judgment.  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md)

<span id="vi.xiii-p16"></span><span id="vi.xiii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xiii-p17"></span>He adds, *The princes of Judah* and *the
princes of Jerusalem, etc.* He does not here name them as though they
were different persons, but he speaks by way of amplifying. He then says
that he would punish these chief men, lest they should think themselves
to be exempted, because they were superior to others in rank and honor;
for we know that those who are elevated in the world are so filled with
pride, that they deem themselves as free from all laws. This, then, is
the reason why God expressly names the *princes* and the *eunuchs.* But
he does not mean by the eunuchs those who had been emasculated, as we
have stated already in several *places.* The chief men were called by
this name, <span id="vi.xiii-p17.1"></span>סרסים *serasim.*  <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md)

<span id="vi.xiii-p19"></span>He mentions the *princes of Jerusalem,*
because they were especially proud, on account of their privileges as
citizens; for in Jerusalem was the royal residence and the sanctuary of
God. But the Prophet declares that their lot would be nothing better
than that of the common people, because God would not suffer his holy
name to be a mockery and all equity to be violated, and especially the
covenant made in his name to be deemed as nothing, and rendered wholly
void. At length he names *the whole people;* whosoever, he says, have
passed between the parts of the calf, shall be punished. It follows —

<span id="vi.xiv"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p1"></span><span id="vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
34:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#020.md)<span id="vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p2"></span>**20**. I will even give them into the hand
of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and
their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to
the beasts of the earth.

<span id="vi.xiv-p3"></span>**20**. Et dabo illos in manum inimicorum
ipsorum, et in manum quaerentium animam ipsorum: et erit cadaver ipsorum
in cibum avi (hoc est, avibus) coelorum, (est heterosis numeri) et
bestiae (hoc est, bestiis) terrae.

<span id="vi.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xiv-p5"></span><span id="vi.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p6"></span>He confirms and explains what he had before
said, and expresses how the punishment would be executed, — that he
would *deliver* them *into the hand* of their enemies; and he adds, *who
seek their life,* in order to shew that their enemies would not be
content with the spoils, or with a moderate punishment, but would be
their inveterate enemies, who would not be satisfied until they
destroyed them. Now this passage teaches us also that the ungodly are
God’s scourges, for the punishment he resolved to inflict on the
transgressors of his law, he executed through them. Though then the
Chaldeans had another object than to be God’s ministers in punishing the
Jews, yet they performed God’s work as though they were his hired
servants, subject to his own will and pleasure. Nor is there a doubt but
that their minds had been greatly exasperated against the Jews, so that
they shed blood indiscriminately withoat mercy: for as God often says,

<span id="vi.xiv-p7"></span>“I will give you favor in the sight of your
enemies,”  
(<span id="vi.xiv-p7.2"></span>[Exod.
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#021.md), [Exod.
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#003)<span id="vi.xiv-p7.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vi.xiv-p8"></span>so also on the other hand, he declares, that
when enemies raged cruelly against them, it was through hls secret
influence, he having resolved severely to punish them. This is the
reason why he now says, that he would deliver the Jews *into the hand of
those who sought their life,* that is, who were not intent on prey or
spoils, and would not be satisfied with moderate punishment, but would
be implacable enemies, until they destroyed the people.

<span id="vi.xiv-p9"></span>Another kind of punishment follows, *Their
carcases shall be for food to the birds of heaving, and to the beasts of
the earth,* as though he had said, that God’s vengeance on the Jews
would be made evident even after death. We said last week, that it would
be no loss to us were we to he unburied, for burial brings no advantage
to us; but yet it is a sign of God’s vengeance. As then famine, and
nakedness, and cold, and diseases, and other evils, are evidences of
God’s wrath against men, so also it is when the body of a dead man is
cast forth, and is either torn by wild beasts, or eaten by birds. If any
one objects and says, that this has sometimes happened to the best and
holiest of God’s servants; to this we answer, that temporal punishment
happens in common to the good and the bad; but when God by famine and
want, by diseases also, or by exile, or by prison, or by any other
evils, tries and chastises his servants, all this is to them as a help
to their salvation. Yet this special mercy of God towards the faithful,
which is a peculiar privilege, is no reason why all miseries should in
themselves be deemed evidences of God’s wrath, for they are everywhere
called curses. And we also know that from the same fountain flow all the
evils which men suffer in this life, even from God’s judgment, who in
this manner executes punishment. It is not then without reason that the
Prophet here declares, that so severe and dreadful would be God’s
judgment towards the Jews, that it would extend beyond death itself, for
they would become meat to the birds of heaven and to the beasts of the
earth. It follows —

<span id="vi.xv"></span>

<span id="vi.xv-p1"></span><span id="vi.xv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
34:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#021.md)<span id="vi.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xv-p2"></span>**21**. And Zedekiah king of Judah and his
princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of
them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s
army, which are gone up from you.

<span id="vi.xv-p3"></span>**21**. Et Zedechiam regem Jehudah, et
principes ejus dabo in manum inimicorum ipsorum, et in manum quaerentium
animam eorum, et in manum exercitus regis Babylonii, qui ascenderunt e
vobis.

<span id="vi.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xv-p5"></span><span id="vi.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xv-p6"></span>He repeats almost the same words, but yet he
comes closer to the subject, for he names the enemies of whom he had
spoken indefinitely before. He had indeed said that they would be cruel,
and would seek their death, and would not be otherwise satisfied. He
repeats again the same for the sake of confirmation; but he afterwards
adds, that these enemies would be the soldiers of the king of Babylon,
even the Chaldeans. He then shews, as by the finger, to the Jews, their
calamity, lest they should, as usual, indulge themselves with the hope
of security. He does not then declare generally, that they would be
punished, and that enemies would come cruelly to destroy them; but he
points out the army of the king of Babylon, and says that the Chaldeans
would come, being armed by God and fighting under his banner, and would
take the city, and destroy the whole kingdom.

<span id="vi.xv-p7"></span>But as the Chaldeans had departed, the
confidence and the security of the Jews had increased, for they thought
that they were now freed from danger. The cause of this departure was,
that the Egyptians had gathered an army to help the Jews, or rather to
provide by anticipation, for their own safety. There was an alliance, we
know, at that time between the Jews and the Egyptians; and the object of
both was to fortify themselves against the king of Babylon. The
Egyptians had no great care for the Jews, but another reason influenced
them; for it was well known, that as soon as the Chaldeans finished the
Jewish war, they would make an attack on Egypt. Now they thought that it
would be an advantage to them to engage with the Babylonian army in
connection with the Jews; for they would have had to fight alone, had
Nebuchadnezzar gained the victory; nay, the Jews themselves would have
been compelled to assist in subduing Egypt. Hence the Egyptians, having
well weighed these things, gathered a large army. The Babylonians,
having heard the report, went forth to meet them. Thus the siege of the
city was left. The Jews exulted as though they had escaped all danger.
Hence the Prophet derides their folly in thinking that they would now be
in peace and quietness, because the Chaldeans *had gone up* from them,
because they left for a time the city, and went up towards Egypt.
*Though* then, he says, (the particle is to be taken adversatively) they
have *ascended from you,* yet God will deliver you into into their hand.

<span id="vi.xv-p8"></span>We now see that Jeremiah spared neither the
king nor the princes; and thus we ought to notice the power of the Holy
Spirit, which prevailed in the hearts of the Prophets, for they boldly
addressed, not only the common people, but also kings and princes. As
then we find the Prophet denouncing, with so much courage, the judgment
of God on the king and the chief men, let us know, that none are fit to
bear rule in the Church, except they be endued with so much firmness as
not to fear any, and not to be disheartened by the power of any, so as
not to reprove boldly the highest as well as the lowest. It follows —

<span id="vi.xvi"></span>

<span id="vi.xvi-p1"></span><span id="vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
34:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#022.md)<span id="vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xvi-p2"></span>**22**. Behold, I will command, saith the
LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight
against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the
cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.

<span id="vi.xvi-p3"></span>**22**. Ecce ego praecipio, dicit Jehova, et
reducam cos ad urbem hanc, et expugnabunt cam, et capient eam (vel,
oppugnabunt eam, et capient eam) et comburent eam igni; et urbes Jehudah
ponent vastitatem absque habitatore.

<span id="vi.xvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xvi-p5"></span><span id="vi.xvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xvi-p6"></span>He shews the same thing in other words, but
the repetition was not in vain, for what we read here seemed incredible
to the Jews. For they raised up their horns when they saw the King
Nebuchadnezzar departing from the city. Lest then this vain confidence
should deceive them, he again declared to them that God conducted the
war, as though he had said, that the Chaldeans had not thoughtlessly
taken up arms, but as God had determined, and as he had commanded them.
He does not indeed speak of an open command, for it was not the purpose
of the Chaldeans to obey God, or to render service to him; but he speaks
of his hidden providence. God is said to command, when the ungodly are
guided by his secret impulse, for he can tuae them as he pleases,
according to what is said in other places, “I will hiss for the
Egyptians,” or for the Assyrians, or for the Chaldeans. The same is the
meaning here, when he says, *Behold, I will command,* etc. In short, God
commands the wicked, he commands diseases, he commands the sword, he
commands the famine and the pestilence; and yet there is no reason or
understanding in the sword, in the pestilence, or in the famine: but
Scripture thus teaches us that all things are under his control, so that
nothing can touch us, except as far as God intends by these to chastise
or humble us.

<span id="vi.xvi-p7"></span>And for the same purpose are these words,
*Behold, I,* <span id="vi.xvi-p7.1"></span>הנני*, enni,* etc. God shews
that he was present, though the Chaldeans were not now seen in the land
of Judah. The manner of his presence he sets forth by saying, *I will
bring them back to this city, and they shall attack it, and take it, and
burn it with fire* These things have been elsewhere explained, I shall
therefore now pass them by.

<span id="vi.xvii"></span>

<span id="vi.xvii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vi.xvii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we cease not
continually to provoke thy wrath against us, — O grant, that we, being
terrified by thy warnings, may obey thy wise counsels, and that thus by
anticipating thy vengeance, which would otherwise remain on us, we may
labor to be so reconciled to thee, that we may really find thee to be
our Father and the guardian of our salvation, until we shall at length,
having finished our course here, come to that blessed rest, which thou
hast prepared for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="vi.xviii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Thirty-Ninth

<span id="vi.xviii-p2"></span>We saw in the last Lecture what the
Prophet denounced on the Jews, — that as they had acted perfidiously
towards their servants, God would punish them by making them servants
perpetually. When Nebuchadnezzar went forth to meet the Egyptians, there
was some appearance of freedom being granted; for the Jews thought that
theywere afterwards to be free: but as they had deceived their servants,
so the Prophet says, that they were greatly mistaken in thinking that
they were to be perpetually free, because Nebuchadnezzar would soon
return. So he declares that they were doomed to servitude, so that the
liberty in which they gloried would prove illusory. Now follows, —

id="vi.viii-p24.5"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p25"></span> The *Tarq.* and the versions, except the
*Sept.,* give the idea of domineering or ruling; and this is the meaning
of the verb everywhere when followed by <span
id="vi.viii-p25.1"></span>ב —

<span id="vi.viii-p26"></span>To send away, a man his servant, and a man
his maid, The Hebrew and the Hebrewess, free; So as not to domineer over
them, A man over a Jew his brother.

<span id="vi.viii-p27"></span>This is a literal rendering of the verse.
But perhaps it would be better to render “servant,” bondman; and “maid,”
bondwoman, as they were the married as well as the unmarried. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[94](cc20005.htm#fr_93.md) <span
id="vi.viii-p38.2"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p39"></span> It is said afterwards that for *six*
years was the servitude to be, and yet the statement here is, “at the
*end* of seven years.” Were it not for two other places, (<span
id="vi.viii-p39.1"></span>[Deut. 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#001.md),
[Deut. 31:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu031.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.viii-p39.1"></span>,) where we find the same words, we might
follow the *Sept.* and the *Arab.,* and read *six* instead of *seven.*
The Rabbins remove the difficulty by saying that the word, <span
id="vi.viii-p39.2"></span>קף, means the commencing, as well as the
terminating end or extremity; so the meaning then would be, “at the
beginning of seven years;” and this would agree with the *six* years
afterwards mentioned. And this is the best explanation of the passage. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_94"></span>[95](cc20005.htm#fr_94.md) <span
id="vi.xi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xi-p9"></span> Our version, “at their pleasure,” is the
best, or we may render it, “to themselves,” as <span
id="vi.xi-p9.1"></span>נפש often has this meaning. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_95"></span>[96](cc20005.htm#fr_95.md) <span
id="vi.xi-p9.3"></span>

<span id="vi.xi-p10"></span> The verb means here evidently to constrain
or to force, —

<span id="vi.xi-p11"></span>And ye have forced them to be to you For
bondmen and for bondwomen.

<span id="vi.xi-p12"></span>It would be better throughout the passage to
retain the words bondmen and bondwomen — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_96"></span>[97](cc20005.htm#fr_96.md) <span
id="vi.xiii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xiii-p12"></span> The construction of this verse as to “the
calf,” is various. Our version is that of *Junius* and *Tremelius.* It
is difficult to understand the *Sept.,* the *Targ.,* and the *Vulg.* The
*Syr.* is substantially as follows, —

<span id="vi.xiii-p13"></span>**18.** And I will make the men who have
transgressed my covenant, Who have not performed the words of the
covenant, Which they made before me, *like* the calf, Which they cut in
two and passed between its parts, —

<span id="vi.xiii-p14"></span>**19.** The princes of Judah, etc. etc.

<span id="vi.xiii-p15"></span>This is the most literal rendering of the
passage: the omission of <span id="vi.xiii-p15.1"></span>כ*, like,* or
as, is not uncommon. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_97"></span>[98](cc20005.htm#fr_97.md) <span
id="vi.xiii-p17.2"></span>

<span id="vi.xiii-p18"></span> It is rendered “<span
id="vi.xiii-p18.1"></span>δυνάστας, rulers,” by the *Sept.,* “eunuchs,”
by the *Vulg.* and *Syr.,* and “princes” by the *Targ*. They were the
attendants on royalty, not necessarily eunuchs, for Potiphar, who had a
wife, was so called. (<span id="vi.xiii-p18.2"></span>[Ge
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#007)<span id="vi.xiii-p18.2"></span>..md)
They may have acted as judges; and hence perhaps it is, that they are
named here with “the priests.” — *Ed*
