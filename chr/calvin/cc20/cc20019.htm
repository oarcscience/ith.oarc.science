<p><a name="xx.i-p3"></A><b>1 </b>The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, &#8212; Write thee all the words which I have spoken to thee in a book;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p5"></A><b>3</b> For, be- hold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, when I shall restore the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah; and I will restore them to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Even these are the words which Jehovah hath spoken of Israel and Judah, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Surely thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; A voice of trembling have we heard, Of fear and not of peace.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Ask and see, can a male bring forth? Why have I seen all men With their hands on their loins as a woman in travail? Turned also are all faces into paleness.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Alas! for great that day, none like it, Even a time of distress to Jacob; Yet from it shall he be saved:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And it shall be in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, <i>That </i>I will break the yoke from thy neck, And thy bands will I burst asunder, And no more force thee to serve shall strangers;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p11"></A><b>9 </b>But serve shall they Jehovah their God, And David their king, whom I will raise up for them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p12"></A><b>10 </b>And thou Jacob my servant, fear not, saith Jehovah, And be not thou, Israel, afraid; For behold I will save thee from far, And thy seed from the land of their captivity, And dwell shall Jacob, and rest, and be secure, And none shall terrify him:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p13"></A><b>11 </b>For I <i>shall be </i>with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee; For I will make an end of all the nations, Among whom I shall scatter thee; Yet of thee I will not make an end: But I will chastise thee in moderation, And I will not wholly cut thee off.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p14"></A><b>12 </b>For thus saith Jehovah, Grievous thy bruise, desperate thy wound!</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p15"></A><b>13 </b>No one undertakes thy cause; For a cure, medicines and healing thou hast not.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p16"></A><b>14 </b>All thy friends forget thee, they ask not for thee; For with the stroke of an enemy have I struck thee, With the chastisement of the cruel, On account of the multitude of thine iniquity, Because prevailed have thy sins.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Why criest thou because of thy bruise? Heavy is thy sorrow: For the multitude of thine iniquity. Because thy sins have prevailed, Have I done these things to thee.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Therefore, all who devour thee shall be devoured, And all thine enemies shall go into captivity, And they who plunder thee shall become a plunder, And all who spoil thee shall be a spoil:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p19"></A><b>17 </b>For I will bring a healing to thee, And from thy wounds will I heal thee, saith Jehovah; Because an outcast have they called thee, Sion, Whom no one careth for.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; Behold, I will restore the captivity of Jacob&#8217;s tents, And his dwellings will I pity; And built shall be the city on its heaps, And the palace in its own place shall stand:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p21"></A><b>19 </b>And go forth from them shall praise and the voice of joy; And I will increase them, and they shall not be lessened; And I will honor them, and they shall not be degraded;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p22"></A><b>20 </b>And his children shall be as at the beginning, And his assembly before me shall be established, And I will visit all his oppressors:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p23"></A><b>21 </b>And his valiant <i>man </i>shall be from himself, And his ruler from his midst shall come forth; And I will bring him nigh, and he shall come to me; For who is he who forms his heart, That he may come to me, saith Jehovah!</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p24"></A><b>22 </b>And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p25"></A><b>23 </b>Behold <i>as </i>a tempest shall Jehovah&#8217;s wrath go forth, <i>As </i>an involving tempest; On the head of the ungodly shall it settle:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.i-p26"></A><b>24 </b>Not return shall the fury of Jehovah&#8217;s wrath, Till he performs it, and till he effects the thoughts of his heart; In the latter days ye shall understand this.</p>  <a name="xx.ii"></A>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xx.ii-p1"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref27"><a name="xx.ii-p2"></A>CHAPTER 31</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>At that time, saith Jehovah, Will I be a God to all the families of Israel; And they shall be my people.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; Found favor in the desert Hath a people who had escaped the sword, By advancing till he gave rest to Israel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Of old Jehovah appeared to me: Nay, with perpetual love have I loved thee; Therefore have I prolonged to thee mercy.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>I will yet build thee, And built shalt thou be, virgin of Israel; Thou shalt yet be adorned with thy tabrets, And go forth with the choir of players;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Thou shalt yet plant vineyards On the mountains of Samaria; Plant shall planters and eat the fruit.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>For the day shall be, when they shall cry, The watchmen, on Mount Ephraim, &#8212; &#8220;Arise, and let us ascend into Sion, To Jehovah our God.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>For thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; Exult for Jacob with joy, And shout at the head of the nations, Publish, give thanks, and say, &#8220;Save, Jehovah, thy people, the remnant of Israel.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>Behold, I will bring them from the land of the north, And gather them from the ends of the earth; Among them shall be the blind and the lame, The pregnant, and she that travaileth; Together a great company shall they return thither.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>With weeping shall they come, And in mercies will I lead them; I will lead them to streams of water, In a straight way, where they shall not stumble: For I will be to Israel a father, And Ephraim, my first-born is he.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>Hear the word of Jehovah, ye nations, And tell <i>it </i>in islands afar off, and say, &#8212; &#8220;He who scattered Israel will gather him, And will watch him as a shepherd his flock:&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>For redeem Jacob will Jehovah, And free him from the hand of one stronger than himself;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And come shall they, and shout on the height of Sion; And flow together shall they to the bounty of Jehovah, For corn and wine and oil, And for the young of the flock and the herd; And their soul shall be as a watered garden, And they shall mourn no more.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Then rejoice shall the virgin in the dance, And the youth and the aged together; And I will turn their mourning to joy, And comfort them and cheer them after their sorrow;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p16"></A><b>14 </b>And I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness, And my people with my goodness shall be satiated, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; A voice on high is heard, The lamentation of bitter weeping; Rachel, weeping for her children, Refused comfort for her children, because they are not,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, Hold thy voice from weeping, And thine eyes from tears; For a reward shall be to thy work, saith Jehovah, And return shall they from the land of the enemy:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>Yea, there will be a hope in the latter end, saith Jehovah; For return shall thy children to their own border.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p20"></A><b>18 </b>Hearing I have heard Ephraim when exiled, &#8212; &#8220;Thou hast chastised me, and I was instructed, Like a bullock not trained; Turn thou me, and I shall be turned, For thou, Jehovah, art my God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p21"></A><b>19 </b>Verily, after thou hadst turned me, I repented; And after I knew myself, I smote my thigh; I was ashamed and even confounded, Because I bore the reproach of my youth.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p22"></A><b>20 </b>Is Ephraim a son dear to me &#8212; Is he a son delighted in Even from the time I spoke to him? Remembering I will still remember him; Therefore sounded for him have my bowels; Pitying I pitied him, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p23"></A><b>21 </b>Set up titles for thee, raise for thee heaps,: Fix my heart on the pathway, On the way thou hast walked; Return, virgin of Israel, return to these thy cities.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p24"></A><b>22 </b>How long wilt thou wander, rebellious daughter! For create does Jehovah a new thing on the earth &#8212; A woman shall surround a man.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p25"></A><b>23 </b>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, &#8212; They shall again say this word in the land of Judah, And in the cities, when I restore their captivity, &#8212; &#8220;Bless thee let Jehovah, The habitation of righteousness, the mount of holiness.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p26"></A><b>24 </b>And dwell in it shall Judah and all his cities, Also husbandmen, and they shall go with the flock:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p27"></A><b>25 </b>For I will water the thirsty soul, And every hungry soul will I fill.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p28"></A><b>26 </b>I then awoke and saw, And my sleep had been sweet to me.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p29"></A><b>27 </b>Behold the days come, saith Jehovah, That I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah, With the seed of man and with the seed of beast:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p30"></A><b>28 </b>And it shall be, that as I have watched over them, To root up and to break down, And to break in pieces and to destroy and to afflict; So will I watch over them, To build and to plant, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p31"></A><b>29 </b>In those days they shall no more say, &#8212; Our fathers have eaten a sour grape, And the children&#8217;s teeth are blunted;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p32"></A><b>30 </b>But every man, in his iniquity shall he die; Every man, eating a sour grape, Blunted shall be his teeth.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p33"></A><b>31 </b>Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, That I will make with the house of Israel, And with the house of Judah, a new covenant:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p34"></A><b>32 </b>Not according to the covenant I made With their fathers, in the day I took their hand, To bring them out from the land of Egypt; Because void have they made that covenant, Though I ruled over them, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p35"></A><b>33 </b>But this is the covenant which I will make With the house of Israel, after those days, saith Jehovah, &#8212; I will put my law in their inward parts, And on their heart will I write it; And I will be to them a God, And they shall be to me a people:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p36"></A><b>34 </b>And teach shall no one any more his neighbor, And no one his brother, saying, &#8212; &#8220;Know ye Jehovah;&#8221; for all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them, saith Jehovah; For I will forgive their sins, And their iniquities will I remember no more.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p37"></A><b>35 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; He who hath set the sun for light by day, And the courses of the moon and stars for light by night, Who moves the sea and its waves roar, &#8212; Jehovah of hosts is his name:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p38"></A><b>36 </b>If removed shall be these ordinances From my presence, saith Jehovah, Then also the seed of Israel shall cease To be a nation before me continually:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p39"></A><b>37 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, &#8212; If measured can be the heavens above, Or searched the foundations of the earth below, Then also will I reject the whole seed of Israel For all that they have done, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p40"></A><b>38 </b>Behold the days come, saith Jehovah, That built shall be the city of Jehovah From the tower of Hananeel to the corner gate;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p41"></A><b>39 </b>And go forth shall the measuring line from before it, Even to the hill Gareb, and surround Goatha,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.ii-p42"></A><b>40 </b>And all the valley of carcasses and ashes, And all the fields to the brook Kedron, Even to the corner gate of the horses eastward: <i>Being </i>holiness to Jehovah, it shall not be cut off, Nor destroyed any more for ever.</p>  <a name="xx.iii"></A>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xx.iii-p1"></A>  		  
<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref27"><a name="xx.iii-p2"></A>CHAPTER 32</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah; this was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p4"></A><b>2</b> And then the army of the king of Babylon besieged Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the palace of the king of Judah;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p5"></A><b>3</b> For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why hast thou prophesied, saying, &#8212; &#8220;Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I deliver this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he wilt take it:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p6"></A><b>4</b> And Zedekiah, king of Judah, shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans; for delivering I will deliver him into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p7"></A><b>5</b> And to Babylon will he bring Zedekiah, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith Jehovah: when ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>And Jeremiah said, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Behold, Hanameel, the son of Shallum thine uncle, will come to thee and say, &#8220;Buy thee my field which is in Anathoth, for thine is the right of affinity to buy.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And Hanameel, my uncle&#8217;s son, came to me, as Jehovah had spoken, into the court of the prison, and said, &#8220;Buy, I pray thee, my field which is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin, for thine is the right of inheritance, and thine the redemption; buy it for thyself.&#8221; Then I knew that it was the word of Jehovah;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p11"></A><b>9</b> And I bought the field from Hanameel, my uncle&#8217;s son, who was in Anathoth, and I weighed money to him, seven shekels and ten pieces of silver:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p12"></A><b>10</b> When I had written in a book and sealed it, and had taken witnesses and weighed the money in a balance;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p13"></A><b>11</b> Then I took the book of the purchase, the sealed according to the law and statute, and the open;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p14"></A><b>12</b> And gave the book of the purchase to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, before the eyes of Hanameel, my uncle&#8217;s son, and before the eyes of the witnesses who were written in the book of the purchase, and before the eyes of all the Jews who sat in the court of the prison;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p15"></A><b>13</b> And I commanded Baruch in their presence, saying,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p16"></A><b>14 </b>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Take these books, the book of purchase, the sealed and the open book, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue for many days;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p17"></A><b>15</b> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, They shall again buy houses and fields and vineyards in this land.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p18"></A><b>16 </b>And I prayed to Jehovah, after I gave the book of the purchase to Baruch, the son of Neriah, saying, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p19"></A><b>17 </b>&#8220;Ah! Lord Jehovah! behold thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine extended arm;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p20"></A><b>18</b> There is nothing difficult for thee: thou shewest mercy to thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of fathers into the bosom of their children after them:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p21"></A><b>19 </b>God, strong, mighty! Jehovah of hosts is his name; great in counsel, mighty in work, whose eyes are open on all the ways of the children of men, to render to every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p22"></A><b>20</b> Who hast wrought signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even to this day, and in Israel and among men; and hast made thyself a name as at this day;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p23"></A><b>21</b> And hast brought forth thy people Israel from the land of Egypt by signs and wonders, and with a strong hand and an extended arm, and with great terror;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p24"></A><b>22</b> And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p25"></A><b>23</b> And they entered in and possessed it, but they have not hearkened to thy voice nor walked in thy law; all that thou hast commanded them to do they have not done; therefore hast thou made all this evil to befall them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p26"></A><b>24 </b>&#8220;Behold, the mounts have come to the city to take it, and the city is given to the hand of the Chaldeans, who war against it by means of the sword, the famine, and the pestilence; and what thou hast spoken has happened; and behold thou seest it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p27"></A><b>25 </b>Yet thou, Lord Jehovah, hast said to me, Buy thee the field for money, and make witnesses to attest, when yet the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p28"></A><b>26 </b>And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p29"></A><b>27 </b>Behold, I Jehovah, am the God of all flesh, Will anything be hard for me?</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p30"></A><b>28 </b>Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold I give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take it;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p31"></A><b>29</b> And enter in shall the Chaldeans who war against the city, and shall set this city on fire and burn it, and the houses on the roofs of which they have burned incense to Baal, and poured out libations to alien gods, in order to provoke me.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p32"></A><b>30 </b>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have been only doing evil before me from their childhood; for the children of Israel have been only provoking me by the work of their hands, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p33"></A><b>31 </b>For to <i>provoke </i>my wrath and my indignation has this city been to me from the day they built it to this day, to cause me to remove it from my presence,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p34"></A><b>32</b> For all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to wrath, &#8212; they, their kings, their princes, their priests and prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p35"></A><b>33 </b>For they turned to me the back and not the face; and when I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, they hearkened not so as to receive correction:</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p36"></A><b>34</b> And they have set their abominations in the house on which my name is called, to pollute it;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p37"></A><b>35</b> And have built high places to Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass to Molech, which I commanded them not, nor did it come to my mind, to do this abomination so as to make Judah to sin.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p38"></A><b>36 </b>And now, therefore, thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which ye say, &#8220;Given it is into the hand of the king of Babylon, by the sword, and famine, and pestilence;&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p39"></A><b>37</b> Behold I will gather them from all the lands to which I shall have driven them in my wrath, and fury, and great indignation, and will restore them to this land, and make them dwell in safety;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p40"></A><b>38 </b>And they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p41"></A><b>39 </b>And I will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me continually, that it may be well with them and with their children after them;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xx.iii-p42"></A><b>40 </b>And I will make with them a perpetual covenant, so as not to depart from them to do them good; and my fear will I put in their hearts, that they may not depart from me;</p>
