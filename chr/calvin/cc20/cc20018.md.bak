<span id="xix-p1"></span>CHAPTER 47

<span id="xix.i"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p1"></span><span id="xix.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
47:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#001.md)<span id="xix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p2"></span>**1**. The word of the LORD that came to
Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote
Gaza.

<span id="xix.i-p3"></span>**1**. Qui fuit sermo Jehovae ad Jeremiam
Prophetam contra Philistim antequam percuteret Pharao Azah.

<span id="xix.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.i-p5"></span><span id="xix.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p6"></span>Jeremiah prophesies here against the
Philistines, who were enemies to the Israelites, and had contrived
against them many cruel and unjust things. There is then no doubt, but
that God intended to testify, by this prophecy, his love towards the
Israelites, for he undertook their cause, and avenged the wrongs done to
them. We hence perceive why God had predicted the ruin of the
Philistines, even that the Israelites might know his paternal love
towards them, as he set himself against their enemies; and thus he gave
them a reason for patience, because it behooved them to wait until God
fulfilled this prophecy.

<span id="xix.i-p7"></span>And he points out the time, *Before Pharaoh
smote Aza,* or *Gaza*. The ancient Gaza, as far as we can find out, was
near the sea; but after it was destroyed, another was built, which is
mentioned by Luke, (<span id="xix.i-p7.1"></span>[Ac
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#026)<span id="xix.i-p7.1"></span>;.md) it
appears from heathen writers that it was a celebrated city and opulent.
But they are mistaken who think that its name is derived from the Persic
word “Gaza,” which means treasures; for they say, that when Cambyses led
an army against Egypt, he left there his riches. But the word <span
id="xix.i-p7.2"></span>עזה, *Oze,* is a very ancient Hebrew word; and it
is well known that the <span id="xix.i-p7.3"></span>ע, *oin,* has been
pronounced like our g; and this is the case as to other words, as for
instance, Gomorrah, <span id="xix.i-p7.4"></span>עמרה, the <span
id="xix.i-p7.5"></span>ע, *oin,* has the sound of <span
id="xix.i-p7.6"></span>ג, *gimel;* so also <span
id="xix.i-p7.7"></span>צער, *Tsor,* the Greek and Latin interpreters
have rendered it, Segor. Then Gaza has not derived its name from
treasures, but it is a Hebrew word, signifying fortitude or strength.

<span id="xix.i-p8"></span>Now Jeremiah says, that he prophesied against
the Philistines *before Pharaoh smote* that city, but he did not
demolish it. But we see that the Prophet threatens nothing to it from
the Egyptians, but rather from the Chaldeans. Why then does he speak
here of Pharaoh?

<span id="xix.i-p9"></span>We must refer to history, and then we shall
see what the design of the Holy Spirit was. When Pharaoh came to bring
assistance to the Jews under Zedekiah, as we have already seen, he was
soon compelled to return to Egypt, for the Chaldeans, having raised the
siege, went against the Egyptians; for if they routed them, they knew
that they could soon possess themselves of the whole of Judea. Haying
then left the Jews for a time, they went against the Egyptians. Pharaoh,
possessing no confidence in himself, as I have said, retreated; but he
plundered Gaza in his way, *because* it was very hostile to the *Jews;*
and he wished to shew that he did not come altogether in vain, though
this afforded no relief to the Jews. But thus in things of nought
earthly kings shew off themselves. Pharaoh then at that time plundered
Gaza, but he did not retain it. At this time Jeremiah predicted greater
calamities. And this ought to be carefully noticed, for there would be
no reason why the Prophet spake of the Philistines, except, he had
respect to something farther. Let us now then come to the second verse:

<span id="xix.ii"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p1"></span><span id="xix.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
47:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#002.md)<span id="xix.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p2"></span>**2**. Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters
rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall
overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that
dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the
land shall howl.

<span id="xix.ii-p3"></span>**2**. Sic dicit Jehova, ecce aquae
ascendunt ab aquilone, et erunt in torrentem exundantem, et exundabunt
terram et plenitudinem ejus, urbem et habitatores ejus, et clamabunt
homo (*hoc est,* singuli homines clamabunt,) et ululabit omnis incola
terrae.

<span id="xix.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.ii-p5"></span><span id="xix.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p6"></span>The Prophet, no doubt, wished to remind the
Jews that it would only be a prelude when Gaza was plundered, and that a
far more grievous punishment was impending over that ungodly nation,
which had done so many wrongs to God’s people. For if Gaza had suffered
only that loss, the Jews might have complained of their lot, as those
ungodly men who had acted so wickedly and in so many ways provoked God’s
vengeance, had lightly suffered. They might then have objected and said,
“What can this mean? God has indeed lightly smitten Gaza; but we would
thus willingly redeem our lives: as those who wish to avoid shipwreck
cast forth their goods into the sea, and whatever precious thing they
may have; so we, if life only be given us, are prepared to part with all
our property.” The Jews then might have thus deplored their lot. Hence
the Prophet says, that something more grievous awaited that city.

<span id="xix.ii-p7"></span>“When ye see Gaza plundered,” he says,
*“think* not that this is the last judgment of God; *for, behold, waters
shall rise from the north,* that is, the Chaldeans shall complete the
work of executing God’s vengeance; the Egyptians shall only plunder the
wealth of the city, which will be endurable; but at length the Chaldeans
will come to exercise boundless cruelty, and they shall be like a flood,
and shall overwhelm Gaza, so as utterly to destroy it.” We now, then,
see what the Prophet meant: there is implied a comparison between the
plunder effected by the Egyptians and the final ruin brought on it by
the Chaldeans.

<span id="xix.ii-p8"></span>The *rising* or ascending of *waters* is
evidently a metaphorical expression. He adds that they would be *an
overflowing torrent,* that is, the waters would be like an inundating
river; *and they will inundate the land.* He speaks of the land of the
Philistines, where this city was. *They will inundate,* he says, *the
land and its fullness* Fullness is taken in Hebrew for opulence or
wealth; trees, corn, and animals are called the fullness of the land;
for when the land brings forth no corn and no fruits, when it breeds no
animals, it is deemed naked and empty. As then God clothes the land with
such ornaments, the land is said to be full, when it abounds in those
productions with which God enriches it. he afterwards speaks of men,
*the city,* he says; he speaks not now of the city Gaza, but of the
whole country; then the singular number is to be taken here for the
plural. At length he says, Cry *shall men, and howl shall all the
inhabitants of the land* The number as to the verbs is here changed, but
there is no ambiguity in the meaning. And by these words the Prophet
intimates, that a most grievous punishment would be inflicted on the
Philistines, so that they would not only cry for sorrow, but even howl.
It follows, —

<span id="xix.iii"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p1"></span><span id="xix.iii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
47:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#003.md)<span id="xix.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p2"></span>**3**. At the noise of the stamping of the
hoofs of his strong *horses,* at the rushing of his chariots, *and at*
the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to *their*
children for feebleness of hands.

<span id="xix.iii-p3"></span>**3**. A voce strepitus ungularum fortium
ejus, a commotione currus ejus, a tumultu rotarum ejus, non respicient
patres ad filios prae dissolutione manuum.

<span id="xix.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.iii-p5"></span><span id="xix.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p6"></span>He continues the same subject; for he says,
that so grievous would be the calamity, that fathers would not have a
care for their children, which is a proof of extreme sorrow; for men
even in adversity do not divest themselves of their natural feelings.
When a father has children, he would willingly undergo ten deaths, if
necessary, in order to save their life; but when men forget that they
are parents, it is a proof, as I have said, of the greatest grief, as
though men, having changed their nature, were become logs of wood. But
the Prophet expresses the cause, not only of sorrow, but also of
anxiety; *From the voice,* he says*, of the noise of the hoofs of his
valiant* ones; he does not name the horses, but <span
id="xix.iii-p6.1"></span>פרסות, *peresut,* refer to horses; *hoofs, he*
says, shall make a great noise by stamping. And then such would be the
commotion by the driving of *chariots,* and such a *tumult* would the
revolving *wheels* create, *that fathers,* being astonished, would not.
look on their *children* At length, he adds, *through dissolution of
hands* By dissolution of hands he means loss of courage or fainting. For
as vigor spreads from the heart through every part of the body, so also
the bands are the chief instruments of all actions. When therefore the
bands are relaxed and become feeble, it follows that men become as it
were inanimate. The Prophet now means that the Philistines would become
like the dead, so as not to move, no, not even their fingers; and why?
because they would be so terrified by the stamping of horses, by the
commotion of chariots, and by the rumbling of wheels, that they would
lose their senses. It follows, —

<span id="xix.iv"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p1"></span><span id="xix.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
47:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#004.md)<span id="xix.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p2"></span>**4**. Because of the day that cometh to
spoil all the Philistines, *and* to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every
helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the
remnant of the country of Caphtor.

<span id="xix.iv-p3"></span>**4**. Propter diem qui venit ad perdendum
omnes Philistinos (*vel,* totam terram Philistinorum, *loquitur de terra
et populo,*) ad excidendum Tyrum et Sidonem, totas reliquias
fortitudinis; quia devastat Jehova Philistinos, reliquias insuliae
Caphthor.

<span id="xix.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.iv-p5"></span><span id="xix.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p6"></span>Jeremiah shews now more clearly, and without
a figure, his meaning, even that destruction would come on the
Philistines when their time was completed. And he mentions *Tyre* and
*Sidon,* neighboring cities, and. formerly under their own jurisdiction.
But Tyre in the time of Isaiah had its own king; yet afterwards in the
time of Alexander the Great the city was free, as it is well known.
These, however, were cities of Palestine, and the people called then
Philistines were contiguous to these cities, so that the Prophet rightly
includes them as it were in the same bundle. *Coming,* he says, *is the
day to destroy all the Philistines,* and also *to cut off* the most
opulent cities, even *Tyre* and *Sidon*

<span id="xix.iv-p7"></span>Sidon was more ancient than Tyre; but the
daughter devoured the mother, according to the common proverb. For Tyre
in time flourished, and Sidon became almost forsaken. It, however,
always retained a name and also some wealth on account of its commodious
harbor. But Tyre was an island in the time of Alexander the Great; and
was therefore more commodious for ships, as it had many harbors. But the
Prophet connects them both together, because they formed then a part of
the land of the Philistines. There is no doubt but that the destruction
was especially denounced on these cities, that the Jews might know that
nothing would be safe throughout the whole land, inasmuch as these
cities, the defenses, as it were, of the whole country, were destined to
perish.

<span id="xix.iv-p8"></span>He farther adds, on account of the day which
is coming against all *the helping remnants, for Jehovah will destroy,*
that is, he will destroy the Philistines, *who are the remnants* (it is
indeed another word, but means the same) *of the island of Oaphtor* He
confirms here the same thing in other words, even that God’s hand would
be on these cities and the whole land, though external aids might come;
and these he calls *all the remnants of courage, or* auxiliaries. Though
they might have many friends alive, ready to bring them help, yet the
Lord would demolish them all, as it follows, *for Jehovah will destroy
the Philistines, the remnants of the island of Caphtor*

<span id="xix.iv-p9"></span>By the *island of Caphtor* he no doubt means
Palestine; but it is doubtful for what reason the Hebrews called the
Cappadocians Caphtorim. As it is hardly credible that they who inhabited
this land had come from so far a country, interpreters have supposed
that others, and not Cappadocians, are here called Caphtorim. Yet Moses
intimates (<span id="xix.iv-p9.2"></span>[De
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023)<span id="xix.iv-p9.2"></span>.md)
that those who inhabited the land from Gaza to Jordan, were not natives,
that is, were not born in those places, but that they were a wandering
people; for he says, that

<span id="xix.iv-p10"></span>“The Caphtorim went forth and dwelt there  
in the place of the natives.”

<span id="xix.iv-p11"></span>We may hence conclude that the Caphtorim
were foreigners, who, wandering from their own country, sought an
habitation elsewhere, and took possession of this land. Whether they
were Cappadocians, I leave undecided; nor ought we to toil much on a
subject of this kind. But as the Caphtorim had emigrated into Palestine,
Jeremiah calls that region the *remnants of the island of Caphtor* It
follows, —

<span id="xix.v"></span>

<span id="xix.v-p1"></span><span id="xix.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#005.md)<span id="xix.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.v-p2"></span>**5**. Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon
is cut off *with* the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut
thyself?

<span id="xix.v-p3"></span>**5**. Venit calvitium super Gazam, destructa
est Asealon, reliquiae vailis ipsorum (*vel,* profunditatis, *potius, ut
mihi videtur,*) quousque laniabis te?

<span id="xix.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.v-p5"></span><span id="xix.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.v-p6"></span>The Prophet returns again to what is
figurative, that he might more fully illustrate his prophecy, and more
powerfully move the Jews. Now by *baldness* he points out a sign of
mourning; for they were wont even to tear their faces with their nails,
and to pluck off their hair. He then says that *baldness,* or the loss
of hair, *had come upon Gaza;* because the inhabitants of the valley and
of the whole land, according to what was usually done in despair, would
pluck off their own hair. It is added, *Destroyed is Ashkelon* This
city, we know, had a great name in the land of the Philistines, and was
nigh Gaza, as it appears from many parts of Scripture. he mentions *the
remnants of their valley,* or depth, for the word is <span
id="xix.v-p6.1"></span>עמק, *omek*: and though it means a valley, yet
the Prophet, no doubt, alludes to the situation of that part, because
they were hid, as it were, in a safe place, and they thought themselves
secure as those who are hid in caverns, to which an access is not easy;
and then Tyre and Sidon, as well as Gaza, were cities on the sea side.
As then they dwelt in these deep and hidden places, they thought,
themselves far away from every danger and trouble. The Prophet derides
this confidence, and says that the *remnants of their valley* should
perish; as though he had said, that there would be no place so deep and
hidden where God’s vengeance would not penetrate.

<span id="xix.v-p7"></span>He at length addresses the whole country*,
How long wilt thou tear thyself?* By tearing he means, no doubt,
mourning or lamentation; for they would tear their faces, as it has been
said, with their nails, as in the greatest grief. The meaning is, that
there would be no end to their calamities, because the Palestines would
mourn perpetually: for otherwise they who are even most grievously
afflicted do not perpetually mourn, for time alleviates grief and
sorrow. The Prophet then shews that so dreadful would be God’s
vengeance, that evils would be heaped on evils, and thus renewed daily
to the Palestines would be the cause of mourning. He afterwards adds, —

<span id="xix.vi"></span>

<span id="xix.vi-p1"></span><span id="xix.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
47:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#006.md)<span id="xix.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.vi-p2"></span>**6**. O thou sword of the LORD, how long
*will it be* ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest,
and be still.

<span id="xix.vi-p3"></span>**6**. Heus gladie Jehovae, quousque non
quiesces? collige te (*vel,* reconde te) in vaginam tuam; quiesce et
sile.

<span id="xix.vi-p4"></span>**7**. How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD
hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore?
there hath he appointed it.

<span id="xix.vi-p5"></span>**7**. Quomodo quiesces, cum Jehova
praeceperit ei (*vel,* de ipsa, *sed malo,* praeceperit ei) super
Ascalon, et super littus maris, illic contestatus sit ei?

<span id="xix.vi-p6"></span> 

<span id="xix.vi-p7"></span><span id="xix.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xix.vi-p8"></span>Here Jeremiah turns to address the sword of
God; and it is a happy apostrophe. It is very striking and forcible,
when the Prophet at one time addresses the land of the Philistines, and
at another, the sword of God; and he had no other object but to confirm
his prophecy, of which otherwise, the Jews might have doubted.

<span id="xix.vi-p9"></span>He then says, *Ho! sword of Jehovah!* Though
he puts here the preposition <span id="xix.vi-p9.1"></span>ל, *lamed,*
which designates the dative case; yet it is often redundant. There is,
in the meantime, no doubt but that he intimates that the slaughter of
which he speaks would be, as it were, by God’s sword, or by a sword
hired by him. Thus he shews that the Chaldeans would do the work of God
in destroying the land of the Philistines.

<span id="xix.vi-p10"></span>*How long,* he says, *ere thou restest!
Hide thyself in thy sheath, rest and be still* Here the Prophet assumes
the character of another, as though he wished to soothe with
blandishments the sword of God, and mitigate its fury. “O sword,” he
says, “spare them, leave off to rage against the Philistines.” The
Prophet, it is certain, had no such feeling; but, as we have said
elsewhere, it was a common thing with the Prophets to assume different
characters while endeavor-ing more fully to confirm their doctrine. It
is the same, then, as though he represented here the Philistines; and
the Prophets speak also often in the person of those on whom they
denounce the vengeance of God. It is here as though he had said, “The
Philistines will humbly ask pardon of God’s sword, but it will be
without advantage or profit; for when they seek to mitigate the wrath of
God, the answer will be, *How can it rest?”* Here the Prophet, as it
were, reproves himself, “I act foolishly in wishing to repress the sword
of God; for how canst thou rest?” It could not be; and why? *because God
hath commanded it against Ashkelon* He now changes the person, but
without any injury to the sense. *God,* then, *hath commanded it,*
therefore the whole world would intercede in vain; in vain also will the
Philistines deprecate it; for it will not be in their power to mitigate
God’s wrath, when it shall burn against them and against Ashkelon.

<span id="xix.vi-p11"></span><span id="xix.vi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xix.vi-p12"></span>Some take *it*, <span
id="xix.vi-p12.1"></span>ה, *he*, as meaning the land itself; but as it
immediately follows, *against Ashkelon* and *against the seashore*, it
is better to explain it as above.

<span id="xix.vi-p13"></span>By the *sea-shore* some understand Joppa;
but it is probable that the Prophet includes the whole coast, and that
he thus still speaks of Tyre, and Sidon, and Gaza, though he names
Ashkelon, which was a little distant from the sea. When, therefor, God
commanded his sword against Ashkelon and all the cities which were by
the sea-shore, the execution of his judgement could not be prevented in
that region. He further adds*, he hath commanded it;* but it is in a
solemn manner, and hence I have rendered the words, *he hath called it
to witness*, or protested it. He then intimates that God had not simply
given his sword a command to commit slaughters through the whole land,
but bound his sword, as it were, by solemn protest; as though he had
said, that this decree could not be revoked, because Godwill not only
command his sword to execute his vengeance, but will also give it a
solemn command, and bind it, as it were, by an oath, never to cease from
its work until the whole people, and all the cities, and the whole land,
should be destroyed together.

<span id="xix.vii"></span>

<span id="xix.vii-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="xix.vii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou wouldst
have to exist a monument of thine invaluable mercy towards thy chosen
people, when thou didst so grievously punish the unbelieving, — O grant,
that we may at this day resort to thee whenever our enemies distress us,
and never doubt but that thou wilt take care of our safety, and so
recumb on thy mercy, that we may patiently wait for the time of our
deliverance; and that, in the meantime, we may see from on high, as in
mirror, the punishment prepared for the unbelieving, so that we may not
follow their example nor implicate ourselves in their vices, but
separate ourselves from them, that, being devoted to thee, we may fight
under the banner of thine only-begotten Son, until he shall gather us
into his celestial kingdom. — Amen.
