<span id="xi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 39

<span id="xi.i"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p1"></span><span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
39:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#001.md)<span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p2"></span>**1**. In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of
Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all
his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.

<span id="xi.i-p3"></span>**1**. Anno nono Zedechiae regis Jehudah,
mense decimo venit Nebuchadnezer rex Babylonis et totus exercitus ejus
Jerosolymam, et obsiderunt eam.

<span id="xi.i-p4"></span>**2** *And* in the eleventh year of Zedekiah,
in the fourth month, the ninth *day* of the month, the city was broken
up.

<span id="xi.i-p5"></span>**2**. In undecimo anno Zedechiae, mense
quarto, nona mensis, disrupta fuit urbs.

<span id="xi.i-p6"></span> 

<span id="xi.i-p7"></span><span id="xi.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p8"></span>Jeremiah seems here indeed to undertake the
office of an historian rather than that of a Prophet; but he seals his
previous prophecies, and at the same time shews that he had brought
forward nothing rashly or thoughtlessly. There is, then, here a proof of
all his former doctrine; he brings before us the reality, and shews that
whatever he had predicted was accomplished by God’s hand, and in a
manner almost incredible. We now understand what this chapter contains.

<span id="xi.i-p9"></span>he says that King Nebuchadnezzar *came,*
though he soon departed from the siege, for, as we shall presently see,
he went to Riblah, which, as some think, was the Antioch of Syria; but
of this we shall speak in its proper place. When, therefore, the king
came with his army, he soon departed, and his purpose was to live at
leisure, and in the enjoyment of pleasures as long as the city was
besieged, he was not disposed to undertake the trouble and weariness of
a long warfare; but yet, in order to spread more terror, he came himself
to the City and gave instructions to his army.

<span id="xi.i-p10"></span>We must notice the time: he came *in the
ninth year, in the tenth month,* that is about the end of the year.
Zedekiah, no doubt, entertained a good hope, though reports were flying
as to the coming of the Chaldean army; for the king had not so soon
prepared for the war as he ought to have done. he thought that his
revolt from the king of Babylon would be passed by unpunished. But the
Prophet here reminds us that it was a false confidence; for though God
spared him for a time and suspended his judgment, he yet at length
punished the impiety of his revolt, to which was also added ingratitude,
as it has been before stated. Thus much as to *the ninth year and the
tenth month*

<span id="xi.i-p11"></span><span id="xi.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p12"></span>It then follows, *In the eleventh year, in
the fourth month, the city was broken up* We hence see that the city was
besieged for a year and half; for there was the whole of the tenth year,
and then added must be two months of the ninth year and four months of
the eleventh year; and thus a year and half was the whole time. Here
also we must remember how much the Jews must have suffered; for were a
city at this day to bear a siege for a few months, it would appear a
rare instance of valor; but Jerusalem was besieged for a year and half.
Let us now consider what number of people must have been there, and we
have seen that the Prophet threatened them with famine. And how much
scarcity there was in the city, the Prophet has not only testified
elsewhere, but in the book of Lamentations he has shewed most fully.
(<span id="xi.i-p12.1"></span>[La
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010)<span id="xi.i-p12.1"></span>..md)
And there was not only famine, but it was followed by pestilence. We
hence learn how ferocious must have been the character of the king, that
he could see miserable men perishing by scores, and yet persist in his
obstinacy. Nor is there a doubt but that the people were also on their
part obstinate, and became at length stupefied through their sufferings;
for there was hardly one, from the least to the greatest, who did not
despise what the Prophet taught; and thus they were all blinded by
madness and stupidity.

<span id="xi.i-p13"></span>It ought to be noticed that they bore a siege
for a year and six months, and that they were not even then persuaded to
surrender themselves, until the city was broken up, that is, until the
walls were beaten down by battering-rams and other warlike engines; for
the city was broken when the wall, beaten by the engines, fell down. In
short, the city was gained by storm; this is what is meant, and will
hereafter be more fully expressed. But I cannot proceed further now.

<span id="xi.ii"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xi.ii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we are
surrounded by so many dangers, and bring on ourselves daily, through our
sins, so many miseries, — O grant, that we may at least yield to thy
threatenings, and learn in due time to seek thy favor and to anticipate
thy judgment, and so to humble ourselves under thy mighty hand, that we
may find thee propitious to us miserable sinners, who flee to thy mercy,
until, having at length been freed from all our sins, we shall appear
before thy tribunal, and there receive the reward of our faith, even
that blessed immortality, which thine only-begotten Son, our Lord, has
procured for us by his own blood. — Amen.

<span id="xi.iii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Fifty-First

<span id="xi.iv"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p1"></span><span id="xi.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
39:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#003.md)<span id="xi.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p2"></span>**3**. And all the princes of the king of
Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, *even* Nergalsharezer,
Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the
residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.

<span id="xi.iv-p3"></span>**3**. Et ingressi sunt omnes duces regis
Babylonis, et sederunt in porta media, Neregal, Sarezer, Samegar,
Nebusarzechin Rabsaris, Neregal, Sarezer, Rabmag, et residuum ducum
(*hoc est,* et alii duces) regis Babylonis.

<span id="xi.iv-p4"></span>**4**. And it came to pass, *that* when
Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they
fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s
garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of
the plain.

<span id="xi.iv-p5"></span>**4**. Et factum est cum vidisset eos
Zedechias rex Jehudah, et omnes viri militares, tunc aufugerunt, et
egressi sunt ex urbe noctu per viam horti regis ad portam inter duos
muros, et egressus est per viam deserti.

<span id="xi.iv-p6"></span> 

<span id="xi.iv-p7"></span><span id="xi.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p8"></span>IT is proved here that the prophecy of
Jeremiah was fulfilled; so that it became really evident that he had not
spoken unadvisedly, but from the mouth of God. And thus was fulfilled
also what is said as a common proverb, that fools become wise too late;
for they never obey good and wise counsels while they may, but at length
they are made to know by their own miseries and their teacher,
experience, that what they despised is true, but without any benefit.
This happened to Zedekiah, who had been often exhorted by the Prophet to
surrender himself to King Nebuchadnezzar. As, then, he had obstinately
refused the yoke, he was at length constrained to reap the fruit of his
obstinacy.

<span id="xi.iv-p9"></span>Now Jeremiah says, that *the princes* of King
Nebuchadnezzar, that is, those he had set over his forces, *entered the
city,* the wall being broken down, and *sat in the middle gate;* for it
was necessary for them to be wary, lest there should be ambushes; and
even conquerors do not immediately penetrate into every part when a city
is taken, but search whether all the places be free from enemies. This
then was done by the leaders of the army, for they stood in *the middle
gate,* that they might exercise authority over the city, and yet be safe
from all ambushes. Jeremiah mentions some of them by name, but it is
uncertain whether he adds a surname to some of them. But as this is
doubtful and is of no great moment, it is enough for us that the chief
of the leaders are named, in order to accredit the narrative.

<span id="xi.iv-p10"></span><span id="xi.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p11"></span>he then adds, *After Zedekiah saw them,
etc*.; not that he came to that part, but after he understood that that
part of the city was occupied by the enemies; for matters then had come
to an extremity. *Then he fled with his men of war.* And here is set
before us a sad spectacle: men in no way trained up for war were left in
the city, women also and children were left there, while the men of war
fled, inasmuch as their condition was worse, because they had delayed
the taking of the city. It was then according to what is commonly done,
that they fled. We yet see that ungodly men, after having long despised
heavenly truth, flee in time of danger, and are so filled with terror,
that they cast themselves headlong into many perils. This is a just
reward to those who are not terrified by the threatenings of God, but
become so hardened, that they too late acknowledge that they ought to
have feared; and being, as it were, stunned, they see not what is
expedient, and cannot follow any fixed course.

<span id="xi.iv-p12"></span>The Prophet adds, that they fled *in the
night,* and that they *went out by the way of the king’s garden,* and
lastly, that they came to the *gate* which was *between the two walls*
There is in this passage nothing superfluous; for he meant to shew us,
that though the king thought that he could escape from the hands of his
enemies, he was yet taken, as God had predicted. For, if after the city
was taken, he had come as a suppliant, of his own accord, he might
probably have obtained mercy; and this counsel, we know, was given while
the state of things was not yet desperate; but he put no faith in God’s
word. In the meantime he thought that he could disappoint his enemies,
if he quickly fled through some secret way. Some think that there was a
subterranean passage, which had a door in the middle of the garden, and
had also an egress at the other end in the plain of Jericho, as we shall
hereafter see. And that region was barren, and therefore solitary. Hence
the king entertained confidence; but he found, at length, how certain
was prophetic truth; for it is said afterwards, that the Chaldeans
followed and took him. But this circumstance, as I have said, ought to
be carefully observed, that the king, as the Prophet tells us, fled.
through a secret way, during the darkness of the night, and escaped. It
now follows —

<span id="xi.v"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p1"></span><span id="xi.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#005.md)<span id="xi.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p2"></span>**5**. But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after
them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had
taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to
Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.

<span id="xi.v-p3"></span>**5**. Et persecuti sunt exercitus Chaldaeorum
ipsos, et apprehenderunt Zedechiam in desertis Jericho (alii vertunt, in
planicie, et fuit planicies; coeterum ut dixi, inculta, et squalida et
vacua etiam incolis;) et tulerunt ipsum, et adduxerunt ad Nebuchadnezer
regem Babylonis Riblathah (urbem) in terra Chemath, qui locutus est cum
ipso judicia.

<span id="xi.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.v-p5"></span><span id="xi.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p6"></span>The Chaldeans pursued the fugitive king, no
doubt, through a hidden impulse from above. It is, indeed, probable that
he was betrayed by his own people; and this often happens in a disturbed
state of things; but however, he might have escaped, had he not been
given up by the hand of God. These things are therefore narrated, that
we may know that the ungodly, by their evasions, gain no other thing
than really to acknowledge that God is true ill his threatenings as well
as in his promises. They believe not his word, it is therefore necessary
that they should be convinced by actual experience. Zedekiah then is
here set before us as an example, so that we may know that as soon as
God announces any calamity, we ought to tremble and to humble ourselves
under his mighty hand, for he holds us on every side completely shut up,
so that if hiding places and refuges be open before us, they can yet
avail us nothing.

<span id="xi.v-p7"></span>The Prophet then tells us, that he was *taken
in the deserts of Jericho* This circumstance also is important, for he
had gone forth beyond the sight of men, even into solitude; for that
plain was not so fruitful as to support many inhabitants, but it was as
it were a desert. It is then a wonder how the Chaldeans found him in
that solitude, but they had God, as it were, as their guide. Hence then
it was, that Zedekiah fell into the hands of the Chaldean army. The
Prophet adds, that they *brought him into Riblah,* which is thought to
have been Antioch. It is also called Hemath; but this name designated
the country and not the city. And yet in <span id="xi.v-p7.1"></span>[Am
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002.md)<span id="xi.v-p7.1"></span>, it
means the city, when it is said,

<span id="xi.v-p8"></span>“Go to Calneh, go to Hemath the great.”

<span id="xi.v-p9"></span>But it may be, that the dignity of the city
was the reason why the country was so called; and no doubt Pliny, in his
fifth book, calls that part of Syria Antiochean; and as to what he says
shortly before, that Antioch was that part of Syria toward Cilicia, that
place seems to me to have been corrupted. I rather read thus, that it
was a part of Syria, for, as I have said, he calls it Antiochean. And it
was not unsuitable that the city should be called Hemath and Riblah, and
that the name of the city should be given to the country. Interpreters
indeed agree, that Riblah was Antioch. Jerome says, that in his day, the
first station towards Chaldea still retained its ancient name, though,
by changing some letters, they called it Emmaus. But he doubts not but
it was Antioch, which was formerly called Epidaphne, and had also the
name of Hemath. There then Zedekiah was *brought to Nebuchadnezzar, who
spoke judgments with him,* that is, who brought him as a criminal before
his tribunal, that he might pronounce sentence upon him; for to speak
judgments means the same as to minister justice or to pass judgment.

<span id="xi.v-p10"></span>Now this was very inconsistent with royal
dignity, for though, as a conqueror, he was angry with his enemy, he
might yet have been content with his death alone. Kings are not wont to
deal in this way with kings, for they respect themselves, and are not
disposed to degrade royal dignity. But Jeremiah says, that Zedekiah was
by no means dealt with royally; for he was constrained to plead guilty,
and was condemned by a solemn sentence. Then to speak judgments is the
same as what we call in French *former proces criminel.* And this
indignity increased the weight of his calamity and his punishment; for
Zedekiah not only had to bear many reproaches, while the king of Babylon
expostu-lated with him, but he was also brought to judgment, so that
punishment, according to the common practice, was allotted to him. For
Nebuchadnezzar had made him king, and imposed tribute on him. He
therefore condemned him as guilty of perfidy and perjury. This is the
degradation which the Prophet points out, when he says, that he spoke
judgments with him, or acted towards him judicially; and he repeats the
same expression in the last chapter. It follows —

<span id="xi.vi"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p1"></span><span id="xi.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#006.md)<span id="xi.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p2"></span>**6**. Then the king of Babylon slew the sons
of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all
the nobles of Judah.

<span id="xi.vi-p3"></span>**6**. Et occidit rex Babylonis filios
Zedechiae in Riblathah coram oculis ejus; et omnes nobiles Jehudah
occidit rex Babylonis.

<span id="xi.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.vi-p5"></span><span id="xi.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p6"></span>It is probable that Nebuchadnezzar continued
in that pleasant city while Jerusalem was attacked, for he would not
endure the weariness of a long siege, and he also wished to be far away
from danger. It was enough for him that his generals, of whom mention is
made, fought under his banner. Nebuchadnezzar then was beyond the reach
of danger, and yet he filled the Jews with terror, because he did not
return home, or to the principal seat of government, but remained in the
neighborhood; for the Antioch of Syria was not far from Judea.

<span id="xi.vi-p7"></span>The Prophet now tells us how cruelly
Nebuchadnezzar acted towards Zedekiah. It was surely a sad spectacle to
see a king, who had been before in repute, who was of a noble family,
who was a type of Christ, lying prostrate at the feet of a proud
conqueror. But much more bitter to him than this, was to see his own
sons killed before his eyes. It would have been better for him to die a
hundred times than to be compelled to witness that slaughter. He was,
however, compelled to do so. And then, that all hope might be cut off,
all those who excelled in dignity and power were slain. For under the
name princes, Jeremiah generally in-eluded the chief men; so that all
who had any name among the people were killed. It was a horrible
carnage! not only the king’s sons were slain, but all who were capable
of restoring the city and the land to a better condition. Thus
Nebuchadnezzar wished to take away every hope, by putting to death the
royal family and all the nobles. It afterwards follows —

<span id="xi.vii"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p1"></span><span id="xi.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
39:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#007.md)<span id="xi.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p2"></span>**7**. Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes,
and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.

<span id="xi.vii-p3"></span>**7**. Et oculos Zedechiae excaecavit, et
vinxit eum cathenis (*in duali numero,* duabus cathenis,) ut adduceret
ipsum Babylonem.

<span id="xi.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.vii-p5"></span><span id="xi.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p6"></span>Here was an accumulation of misery: the king
had his eyes pulled out,  <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) after
having been a spectator of the slaughter of his own sons! He then saw
heaped together the dead bodies of his own offspring and of all his
nobles. After that slaughter he was made blind. His life was, no doubt,
prolonged to him, that he might die, as it were, by little and little,
according to what a notorious tyrant has said. And thus Nebuchadnezzar
intended to kill him a hundred and a thousand times, and not at once to
put him to death, for death removes man from all the miseries of the
present life. That Zedekiah remained alive, was then a much harder
condition.

<span id="xi.vii-p8"></span>And this has been recorded that we may know,
that as he had been so long obstinate against God, the punishment
inflicted on him was long protracted; for he had not sinned through
levity or want of thought, or some hidden impulse, but hardened himself
against every truth and all counsels. It was therefore just that he
should die by little and little, and not be killed at once. This was the
reason why the king of Babylon pulled out his eyes.

<span id="xi.vii-p9"></span>The Prophet says in the last place, that he
was *bound with chains,* and that he was in this miserable condition
*led into Babylon* This reproach was an addition to his blindness: he
was bound with chains as a criminal. It would have been better for him
to have been taken immediately to the gallows, or to have been put to
death in any way; but it was the design of Nebuchadnezzar, that he
should lead a miserable life in this degraded state, and be a public
example of what perfidy deserved. It follows, —

<span id="xi.viii"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p1"></span><span id="xi.viii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
39:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#008.md)<span id="xi.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p2"></span>**8**. And the Chaldeans burned the king’s
house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls
of Jerusalem.

<span id="xi.viii-p3"></span>**8**. Et domum regis et domum populi
combusserunt Chaldaei igni, et muros Jerusalem diruerunt.

<span id="xi.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.viii-p5"></span><span id="xi.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p6"></span>Here also the Prophet shews that whatever
he had predicted was fulfilled, so that nothing was wanting to render
faith sure and fixed. He had said, as we have seen, that if Zedekiah
surrendered himself of his own accord, the houses in the city would not
be burnt. Zedekiah thought this all vain, or at least he closed up his
ears. He now heard, though he was blind, that God had declared nothing
in vain by the mouth of Jeremiah; for his palace was burnt, and also all
the other houses.

<span id="xi.viii-p7"></span>He put <span id="xi.viii-p7.1"></span>בית*,
bith,* in the second clause, the singular for the plural; and so there
is here an enallage, for it was not only one house of the people that
was burnt, but the fire consumed all the houses. We at last come to the
walls, which were beaten down; and thus the city was destroyed as
Jeremiah had predicted. It follows, —

<span id="xi.ix"></span>

<span id="xi.ix-p1"></span><span id="xi.ix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
39:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#009.md)<span id="xi.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ix-p2"></span>**9**. Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the
guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that
remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with
the rest of the people that remained.

<span id="xi.ix-p3"></span>**9**. Residuum vero populi qui superstites
erant in urbe, et elapsos (*hoc est,* defectores,) qui defecerant ad
ipsum (*nempe,* ad Nebuchadnezer,) et residuum populi qui relicti
fuerant (qui fuerant superstites, *idem nomen repetitur*) transtulit
Nabuzardan princeps interfectorum Babylonem.

<span id="xi.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.ix-p5"></span><span id="xi.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ix-p6"></span>The Prophet now relates also what happened to
others, even those who remained in the city, and whom Nebuchadnezzar and
his army had spared: he says that they were *brought to Babylon.* There
were those who had fled and went over to the Chaldeans before the city
was taken; for we have seen that so great was the despair of many, that
they revolted, and those were they whom Zedekiah chiefly feared, lest he
should be, as we have seen, an object of mockery to them, had he gone to
the Chaldeans and made a willing surrender. Jeremiah now says that those
also were led into Chaldea. Nebuchadnezzar might have removed them on
this account, because he could not confide in traitors. He had found out
their inconstancy, for they had revolted from their own real and
legitimate king. As then they had. thus once violated their faith, he
could not but regard them with suspicion, and therefore removed them,
lest they should afterwards attempt something new, and create
disturbance; or, it may be, that it was done according to their request,
because they feared lest, after the departure of the Chal-deans, the
common people should rage against them, as they had helped the enemies,
and thus had become perfidious and ungrateful towards their own country.
It might then be, that they themselves had made this request, and that
it was granted them: they might then live quietly in a far country, but
they could not be safe in Judea. However, whatever may have been the
reason, Jeremiah tells us, that they were led with the rest into Babylon
and Chaldea.

<span id="xi.ix-p7"></span>he afterwards names the head or general of
the army, even *Nebuzaradan,* whom he calls the *prince* of the killers,
or of the cooks. The Greek translators have rendered it <span
id="xi.ix-p7.1"></span>ἀρχιμάγειρον, the prince of the cooks, who at
this day is called Grand Master in the courts of princes. But their
opinion is more probable, who render the words, the prince of the
killers. The verb <span id="xi.ix-p7.2"></span>טבח, *thebech,* means to
slay, to kill, and to kill men as well as to slay beasts; and for this
reason some have applied it to cookery. But as Nebuzaradan is mentioned
here as the chief among military men, the probability is that he was the
judge of all capital offenses in the army.  <span
id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) Hence Jeremiah names him when he says
that they were *removed who remained in the city.*

<span id="xi.ix-p9"></span>But there seems to be here an unnecessary
repetition, as he mentions twice, *the rest of the people which
remained* There is, however, a difference, for in the first clause he
says, *in the city* He then means those who had been besieged, and whom
Nebuchadnezzar had pardoned so as not to put them to death. The last
clause embraces more, even all the inhabitants of the land; for there
were many scattered abroad, on whom Nebuchadnezzar might have vented his
rage, but he removed them as slaves into Chaldea. Then our Prophet
speaks here of these two parties, for he says that there were some
remaining in the city, and that others were remaining, even those who
were found scattered through various parts of the country, and had not
been besieged by the Chaldean army. He afterwards adds, —

<span id="xi.x"></span>

<span id="xi.x-p1"></span><span id="xi.x-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010.md)<span id="xi.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.x-p2"></span>**10.** But Nebuzaradan the captain of the
guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of
Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.

<span id="xi.x-p3"></span>**10.** Et ex populo pauperes, quibus nihil
quicquam erat, reliquos fecit Nabuzardan, princeps interfectorum, in
terra Jehudah, et dedit illis vites et agros in die isto.

<span id="xi.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.x-p5"></span><span id="xi.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.x-p6"></span>He now adds, that some were left to inhabit
the land, even *the poor and those who had nothing* He says that these
were made, as it were, the lords of the land when the Chal-deans
returned into their own country. We here see that poverty is often an
advantage, for the nobles, as we have seen, were killed, and many also
of the middle class were killed in the siege of the city, and some of
them were treated a little more humanely. Still the exiles were
miserable, and driven to a distant land without any hope of return. The
land was now left to the poor alone; and those who possessed not’ a foot
of ground before, lived now very comfortably; for they were not so large
a number, but that each of them had some extent of land, as we shall
hereafter see. While then these miserable men, who before lived very
scantily, and perhaps begged their bread, while these remained secure in
the land of Judah, the possessors of the land were torn away and driven
into exile; and as Nebuzaradan had assigned to each of them vineyards
and fields, it hence appears how much better it was for them to have
suffered hunger for a time, to have been in an ignoble condition, and to
have been trodden as it were under foot by others, than to have lived in
pomp and splendor. Thus often God shews his *care* for us, when he
suffers us not to rise high, but keeps us in an obscure and humble
condition; and the issue at length proves that he thus had a regard for
our salvation.

<span id="xi.x-p7"></span>At the same time there is here set before our
eyes a woeful change. The king is led bound in chains, and is also
blind; and all the rest having left their own, are driven into exile;
and, on the other hand, the poor alone, and needy men who had nothing,
dwell at large, as it were, in their own possessions. As, then, they had
their quiet habitations and large fields, and enjoyed a land so fertile
and rich, there is no doubt but that Nebuzaradan meant thus to rouse the
envy of the exiles; for they saw that *needy* and worthless men dwelt in
that land from which they had been banished. Hence their indignation was
increased when they saw that they were more severely and cruelly treated
than those lowest of men. It follows, —

<span id="xi.xi"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p1"></span><span id="xi.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
39:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#011.md)<span id="xi.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p2"></span>**11.** Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard,
saying,

<span id="xi.xi-p3"></span>**11.** Praecepit autem Nabuchad-nezer rex
Babylonis de Jeremia per manum Nabuzardan principis interfectorum,
dicendo,

<span id="xi.xi-p4"></span>**12.** Take him, and look well to him, and
do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.

<span id="xi.xi-p5"></span>**12.** Tolle ipsum et oculos tuos pone super
eum, et ne facias ei quiequam mali; sed prout loquutus fuerit tecum fac
cum eo.

<span id="xi.xi-p6"></span> 

<span id="xi.xi-p7"></span><span id="xi.xi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p8"></span>The Prophet now sets forth the paternal care
of God, which he had experienced in the preservation of his life and
safety. The innocent, we know, are often killed in a tumult, and the
storming of cities is turbulent, so that many things are done without
any thought; nay, even the leaders are not able to moderate the excesses
of the victorious. When, therefore, the Chaldeans burnt the palace,
Jeremiah might have perished at the same time, being suffocated by the
very smoke of the fire. We know what happened at the taking of Syracuse.
Marcellus did not wish that Archimedes should perish, nay, he commanded
that he should be preserved; for he wished to save that man on account
of his singular industry and noble genius. However, while he was drawing
circles on the ground, he was killed by a common soldier. If no one had
come to Jeremiah, he might, as I have said, have been buried under the
ruins of the palace, when the king’s court was burnt down. But he says
that he had been wonderfully preserved, for *Nebuchadnezzar had given a
command respecting him,* that he might not be exposed to any trouble,
but that Nebuzaradan as well as the whole army should secure his safety.

<span id="xi.xi-p9"></span><span id="xi.xi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p10"></span>It is indeed probable that the king of
Babylon had heard of Jeremiah; and though he was in prison, yet the Word
of God, which he boldly proclaimed, was not bound. Then the report of
this might have reached the king of Babylon: and hence it was, that he
was disposed to preserve him; for he had given a faithful counsel to
Zedekiah. But Nebuchadnezzar no doubt regarded only his own advantage;
and hence we ought to bear in mind the wonderful goodness of God in
preserving, as it were, by his own hand, the life of the Prophet; so
that in extremities no one touched him, but he remained free and quiet,
as we shall hereafter see. But we must put off the rest until to-morrow.

<span id="xi.xii"></span>

<span id="xi.xii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xi.xii-p2"></span>Grant, omnipotent God, that since thou hast
once given us so awful a proof of thy wrath in the destruction of that
city, which thou didst choose, and in which thou hadst had thy holy
habitation, — O grant, that we may learn so to submit to thee in true
humility and obedience, that we may not provoke thy extreme displeasure,
but on the contrary anticipate it by real repentance, and that being
terrified by thy threatenlugs, we may so submit ourselves to thee as to
obtain thy mercy, and thus to regard thee as a Father, ever propitious
to all those who flee to thee through Christ Jesus our Lord. — Amen.

39:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#013.md)<span id="xi.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xiv-p2"></span>**13.** So Nebuzaradan the captain of the
guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and
all the king of Babylon’s princes;

<span id="xi.xiv-p3"></span>**13.** Et misit Nabuzardan, princeps
interfectorum, et Nebusazban, Rabsaris (*diximus quosdam has voces
interpretari, quod sit princeps eunuchus, sed aliis magis placere esse
proprium nomen, quos ego sequor*) et Neregal, Sarezer, Rabmag, et alii
principes Regis Babel (Babylonis:)

<span id="xi.xiv-p4"></span>**14.** Even they sent, and took Jeremiah
out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son
of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt
among the people.

<span id="xi.xiv-p5"></span>**14** Miserunt (inquam) et tulerunt
Jeremiam ex atrio custodiae, et dederunt eum (*hoc est,* commiserunt
eum) Godoliae filio Achikam, filii Saphan, ut deduceret eum domum; et
ita habitavit in medio populi.

<span id="xi.xiv-p6"></span> 

<span id="xi.xiv-p7"></span><span id="xi.xiv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xiv-p8"></span>Here Jeremiah completes what we began
yesterday to expound, even that by the command of King Nebuchadnezzar he
was delivered from prison. But we have said, that though that heathen
king had regard to his own interest, yet his mind was ruled by the
secret power of God, who thus designed to rescue his servant from death;
for God is wont thus to work even by the ungodly, who have another thing
in view. It is not always by a voluntary act that men serve God, for
many execute what God has decreed when they have no intention of doing
so: and he so turns and drives them here and there, that they are
constrained, willing or unwilling, to obey his authority. Thus, then, it
was that Nebuchadnezzar liberated Jeremiah.

<span id="xi.xiv-p9"></span>And yet the Prophet fully believed that he
did not owe his life to King Nebuchadnezzar, but that he had been in a
wonderful manner preserved by God’s favor; and to shew this is the
design of the whole narrative.

<span id="xi.xiv-p10"></span>He says, that the king had sent all-the
leaders of the Chaldean army to take him out of the court of the prison,
and that he was then delivered to the care of Gedaliah, not that he
might be watched as usual, but because the princes knew that the people
had entertained hatred towards the holy Prophet, and therefore wished
him to be preserved safe from all violence. This then was the reason why
they committed him to the keeping of Gedaliah, who, as we shall
hereafter see, was in favor with the Chaldeans and highly esteemed.

<span id="xi.xiv-p11"></span>He adds in the last place, that he *dwelt
in the midst of the people*: by which expression is set forth complete
liberty, as we say in our language, *aller et venir. He* then says that
he was in the midst of the people, because he had been before shut up in
prison. It now follows —

<span id="xi.xv"></span>

<span id="xi.xv-p1"></span><span id="xi.xv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
39:15-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#015.md)<span id="xi.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xv-p2"></span>**15.** Now the word of the LORD came unto
Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,

<span id="xi.xv-p3"></span>**15.** Ad Jeremiam vero fuit sermo Jehovae,
quum adhuc esset clausus in atrio custodiae, dicendo,

<span id="xi.xv-p4"></span>**16.** Go and speak to Ebedmelech the
Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good;
and they shall be *accomplished* in that day before thee.

<span id="xi.xv-p5"></span>**16.** Vade et dic Ebedmelech Aethiopi (*hoc
est,* alloquere Ebed-melech, dicendo,) Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus
Israel, Ecce adduco sermones meos super urbem hanc in malum, et non in
bonum; et erunt coram facie tua in die illo:

<span id="xi.xv-p6"></span>**17.** But I will deliver thee in that day,
saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of
whom thou *art* afraid.

<span id="xi.xv-p7"></span>**17.** Et eripiam te in die illo, dicit
Jehova, et non traderis in manum hominum, a quorum facie tu expavescis
(*ad verbum est,* quos tu expavescis ab eorum facie;)

<span id="xi.xv-p8"></span>**18.** For I will surely deliver thee, and
thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto
thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.

<span id="xi.xv-p9"></span>**18.** Quia liberando liberabo te, in
gladium non cades, et erit tibi anima tua in spolium, quia sperasti in
me, dicit Jehova.

<span id="xi.xv-p10"></span> 

<span id="xi.xv-p11"></span><span id="xi.xv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xv-p12"></span>The Prophet tells us here that God was not
unmindful of that Ethiopian, by whom he had been preserved, though he
was an alien and from a barbarous nation. We have seen, however, that he
alone undertook the cause of the Prophet, when others, being terrified
by fear, did not exert themselves, or were avowedly enemies to God’s
servant. Ebedmelech then alone dared to go forth in a case so hopeless,
and undertook the defense of the holy man. The Prophet says now that
this service was so acceptable, that it would not be without its reward.
We have said that Ebedmelech had thus manifested his concern for the
Prophet’s life, but not without evident danger; for he knew that the
princes were united against him, and that these ungodly men had drawn to
their side the greatest part of the court and also of the common people.
Then Ebedmelech roused against himself both high and low; but God aided
him, so that he was not overpowered by his adversaries. In his very
danger he experienced the favor of God, and was protected and delivered
from danger.

<span id="xi.xv-p13"></span>But now he finds that he had not ill
employed his exertions; for he had not only been humane and merciful
towards a mortal man, but had also done service for God; for whatever we
do for God’s servants, he acknowledges as done to himself, and will have
it to be laid to his account, according to what Christ says,

<span id="xi.xv-p14"></span>“He who gives a cup of cold water to one of
the least of my disciples, shall not lose his reward.” (<span
id="xi.xv-p14.1"></span>[Mt 10:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042.md)<span
id="xi.xv-p14.1"></span>)

<span id="xi.xv-p15"></span>There is then no doubt but that the Spirit
of God intended by the example of Ebedmelech to rouse us to the duties
of humanity, even to teach us to sue-coup the miserable, and to give
them help as far as we can, and not to shun the hatred of men or any
dangers, which we may thereby incur. And as we are torpid and negligent
in doing good, the reward given to the Ethiopian is set before us, so
that we may know, that though nothing is to be hoped from men, when we
are kind and liberal, yet we shall not lose our labor, for God is rich
enough, who can render to us more than can be expected from the whole
world. This then is the lesson conveyed here.

<span id="xi.xv-p16"></span>But the *circumstances* must be noticed: the
Prophet says, that he was *commanded* to promise deliverance to
Ebedme-lech, while he was yet confined in prison. This, at the first
view, seems strange; for the Prophet might have objected and said, “Thou
biddest me to go forth; why, then, are not the gates of the prison
opened for me? and then thou wouldst have me to be the herald of thy
favor; but my present miserable condition will prevent any credit to be
given to my words: for how can Ebedmelech believe that I have been sent.
by thee? for I am here confined and surrounded by many deaths.” But let
us hence learn not to bring down God’s word to our judgment, when
anything is promised beyond our expectation, and all our conceptions.
Though, indeed, God seemed, as it were, to mock his servant, when he
ordered him, a prisoner, to go to Ebedmelech; and yet the Prophet
received and embraced this command, and performed it, no doubt, though
this is not expressly mentioned.

<span id="xi.xv-p17"></span>This is the reason why he says, that *a word
came to him from Jehovah, while he was in the court of the prison*

<span id="xi.xv-p18"></span><span id="xi.xv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xv-p19"></span>The word *Ethiopian* is now repeated,
because God intended, in the person of an alien indirectly to reprove
the Jews; for no doubt they despised him, because he was not of the holy
seed of Abraham. But God shews that he peculiarly regarded him, while he
rejected the masked and hypocritical children of Abraham, who were only
born of him according to the flesh, but had, by their impiety, renounced
him, so that they were wholly unworthy of so high an honor.

<span id="xi.xv-p20"></span>And he says, *Go and say, Behold, I am
bringing my words on this city for evil and not for good; and they shall
be before thee in that day.* We conclude, from these words, that this
was spoken to Ebedmelech before the city was taken by the Chaldeans, in
order that he might remain quietly at home, and not flee away with the
king, who, as we have seen, tried to escape. God then intended to
strengthen the confidence of Ebedmelech, so that he might not fear and
tremble like others, and expose himself to death, in trying to secure
his safety. For this is the design of all God’s promises, even to keep
us from being disturbed, to give us quietness of mind, and to cause us
to look for the help promised to us. For we know that when fear lays
hold on our minds, there is no settled purpose, but we are harassed by
disquietude, and, as it were, tossed to and fro. It was therefore God’s
design to bring aid beforehand, so that Ebedmelech might not, with
others, be hurried into despair. He says, *Behold, I am bringing,* etc.
God here confirms Ebedmelech in the truth, that he would be the author
of the calamity; for had Jerusalem been taken by chance, Ebedmelech
might justly have feared; but when he was taught that it was to happen
through God’s just judgment he would feel sure of his safety; for it
would be in the power of the same God to save one man and even many,
while he was destroying the whole people. This, then, is the reason why
God declared that he was *bringing* his words for evil and not for good;
for except Ebedmelech had been convinced that the city and its
inhabitants were in God’s hand and power, he could never have been led
to entertain good hope; but when he knew that the city would perish
through the righteous vengeance of God, he would then be fully confident
as to his own safety; for God promised to preserve him in the midst of
the common ruin.

<span id="xi.xv-p21"></span>He says, Thou shalt see, *my words shall be
before thee,* as though he had said, “Thou shalt be an eye-witness of my
power.” It was indeed necessary, as I have said, that Ebedmelech should
see God’s hand in the destruction of the city and people; for he would
ever have vacillated, and would have known no rest, had he not before
his eyes the hand and the vengeance of God, This is one thing. But as to
the words, *I am bringing my words for evil and not* for good, we have
explained them elsewhere. The word evil does not mean sin here, but
according to a common usage, evil is said to be whatever men regard as
adverse to them; so all punishments inflicted by God are called evils,
as we find in Isaiah,

<span id="xi.xv-p22"></span>“I am God, who create light and darkness,
life and death,  
good and evil.” (<span id="xi.xv-p22.2"></span>[Isa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007)<span id="xi.xv-p22.2"></span>.md)

<span id="xi.xv-p23"></span><span id="xi.xv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xv-p24"></span>He then adds, *But I will deliver thee in
that day, and thou shalt not be given up into the hand of the men whose
face thou fearest* Here God promises that Ebedmelech would be saved
through a special privilege; and the Prophet shews that this prophecy
had not been without reason announced. For though Ebedmelech had, with
an intrepid mind, undertaken the cause of Jeremiah, and boldly and
perseveringly fronted all reproaches, he yet was not divested of all the
feelings of nature, but he had his fears, especially when he saw the
cause of fear set before him. Hence the Prophet says, that he *feared*
the face of enemies: and this might, at the same time, avail to rouse
him to receive with more alacrity, the promise offered to him; for we
know that the blessings of God are, in a manner, deemed of no value by
us, when we do not know how necessary to us they are. The prophecies and
the promises, by which God comforts us and animates us to patience, are
for the most part viewed as of no worth, until God really shews to us
how miserable we must be, except he thus succors us. Then the Prophet
wished to remind Ebedmelech of this, when he said that he *feared. Thou
fearest,* he says. For if Ebedmelech had no fear, he might have
disregarded this prophecy as being superfluous. But being reminded of
his fear and anxiety, he became more ready to receive what God promised
to him.

<span id="xi.xv-p25"></span><span id="xi.xv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xv-p26"></span>Then he says, that he would be safe, because
the Lord would *deliver him in that day* And, again, he confirms the
same thing, *For delivering I will deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall
by the sword* The Prophet again calls the attention of Ebedmelech to God
himself; for we know how all things are in a confusion when cities are
taken by storm. Except then Ebedmelech had his mind fixed on God, he
could never have retained any hope of deliverance. Hence the Prophet
assures him again, that God would be his deliverer. And he adds, *Thy
soul shall be for a prey* This mode of expression has been elsewhere
explained. The comparison is taken from those who deem that a great gain
which is yet but small, if they get it beyond their expectation, as when
a man finds a prey which he had by no means hoped for: he becomes
suddenly rich, or increased in his goods; and though the gain may not be
great, he yet greatly rejoices. So they who escape alive from present
death, have no small reason to be joyful, because their life has been
preserved. In the meantime God alludes to those who regard it enough to
escape from death, though they may be deprived of all other things. As
those who, in shipwreck, cast forth their mer-chandize, and their money,
and all they have, deem it enough if they can reach the harbor, and they
prefer to beg their bread all their life rather than to sink in the
midst of the sea, so he who escapes with his life; though poverty is
bitter, yet the horror of death is so great, that he deems his life a
great, gain, though stripped of all that he had.

<span id="xi.xv-p27"></span>The reason follows, *because* he *trusted*
in God. Another reason might have been assigned, even because he had not
been wanting in his kindness to a holy man, but had extended his hand to
him in his extreme misery; but as that office of humanity proceeded from
faith and piety, God does here express the chief cause. As then the
mercy which Ebedmelech exercised towards the Prophet was an evidence of
his piety and faith, here is found the fruit in its own tree, or in its
root: and certain it is, that Ebedmelech would have never been so humane
towards the Prophet, had he not relied on God and his aid; for unbelief
is always timid. There is then no doubt but that the vigor which
appeared in Ebedmelech, when he regarded his life in bringing aid to the
Prophet, made manifest that faith which is now commended: *because* then
*thou hast trusted in me,* therefore *delivering I will deliver thee,*
says God. There is now then no doubt but that Ebedmelech had some of the
elements of faith and piety. If then God has allowed us to make farther
progress, we may feel the more assured that he will be our deliverer;
for his grace and his power will ever exceed our faith, how much so ever
it may be. Now follows —
