<span id="x-p1"></span>CHAPTER 38

<span id="x.i"></span>

<span id="x.i-p1"></span><span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#001.md)<span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p2"></span>**1**. Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and
Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur
the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all
the people, saying,

<span id="x.i-p3"></span>**1**. Et audivit Saphatias fillus Matthew tam,
et Guadalias filius Passhur, et Juchal filius Selemiae et Passhur filius
Malchiae, sermones quos Jere-mias loquutus fuerat ad toturm popu-lum,
dicendo,

<span id="x.i-p4"></span>**2.** Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth
in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the
pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he
shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.

<span id="x.i-p5"></span>**2**. Sic dicit Jehova, Qui manebit in urbe
hac morietur gladio, fame et peste; qui autem egressus fuerit ad
Chaldaeos, rivet et erit ei anima sua in spolium et vivet.

<span id="x.i-p6"></span>**3**. Thus saith the LORD, This city shall
surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which shall
take it.

<span id="x.i-p7"></span>**3**. Sic dicit Jehova, Ecce tradendo tradetur
haec urbs in manum exer-citus regis Babylonis, et capiet eam.

<span id="x.i-p8"></span>**4**. Therefore the princes said unto the
king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he
weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the
hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man
seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.

<span id="x.i-p9"></span>**4**. Et dixeunt principes ad regem, Moriatur
nunc (*vel,* agedum, *est hor-tantis particula* <span
id="x.i-p9.1"></span>נא) vir iste, quoni-am propterea (*vel,* hoc modo)
solvit manus virorum bellicosorum, qui residui sunt in urbe hac, et
manus totius populi, loquendo ad ipsos se-cundum istos sermones; quoniam
hic vir non quaerit pacem (*hoc est,* non spectat ad pacem) populo huic
(populi hujus) quin potius ad malum.

<span id="x.i-p10"></span> 

<span id="x.i-p11"></span><span id="x.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p12"></span>The Prophet now shews that he was again
dragged from the court of the prison to the inner part, which was dark,
filthy, and like a grave. The cause of this he states: it was because
four of the princes had heard his words. It is probable that many of the
people had come there for the purpose of hearing the Prophet, and that
he, having received a message, delivered it to every one that came to
him. Though then he was shut up in prison, yet the word of God could not
be bound, as Paul says, who gloried in the fact, that though he was in
chains, yet the truth spread far and wide. (<span
id="x.i-p12.1"></span>[2Ti 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#009.md)<span
id="x.i-p12.1"></span>.) Such was the case as to Jeremiah; though he was
retained as a prisoner, he yet ceased not to discharge his office; and
yet there is no doubt but that the purpose of the king was in this way
to restrain him. The prison was, as it were, the captivity of prophetic
truth. But the king and his counselors were mistaken; for Jeremiah was
not less free in the court of the prison, than if he had walked through
the city all the day, nay, he had many heralds.

<span id="x.i-p13"></span>But the four princes mentioned here watched
him, even *Shephatiah, Gadaliah, Jucal,* and *Pashur.* Then the four
princes he names, having insidiously watched what he said, immediately
made a commotion. They had, no doubt, contrived the ruin of the Prophet
before they came to the king; for the unprincipled and wicked, we know,
discuss matters together when intent on mischief, and their courtly arts
must be taken to the account. As, then, the four were in authority, they
must, doubtless, have influenced the greatest part of the king’s
council, and led astray easy men, or such as were not of themselves bent
on evil. The matter was at length brought before the king; and therefore
he adds, that they *came to the king* But he first explains the
doctrine, on account of which these unprincipled men created so much
ill-will to him, and endangered his life. Hence he says that the
accusation was, that he had not only threatened with ruin all the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, but that he had also pro-raised life to all
that would go out to the Chaldeans: *Every one who abides in the city
shall die by the sword, famine, or pestilence; but every one who goeth
out to the Chaldeans shall live* This was the accusation.

<span id="x.i-p14"></span><span id="x.i-p14.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p15"></span>We have seen elsewhere that the Prophet had
before said the same; it was not, then, a new thing, for he had thirty
years before that time dearly pronounced the same in the Temple, and it
was then written as a prophecy and fixed to the doors of the Temple. It
was, therefore, nothing new to hear all this from the mouth of Jeremiah.
But as I have already said, the king and his couriers thought that he
was so subdued by evils that he could hardly open his mouth. In short,
they thought that the holy man had, in a manner, lost his tongue since
he had been in prison. This, then, was the reason why they now accused
him so gravely to the king, and declared him worthy of death. He had
deserved death many years before, if he had now committed a capital
offense. But as I have already stated, they regarded the Prophet as
having designedly despised the king’s authority, and they were indignant
because he could not be subdued, when yet he was a prisoner and might
see danger at hand every hour. This, then, was the reason why *they*
regarded as a new thing what Jeremiah said, *Whosoever abides in the
city shall perish,* etc.

<span id="x.i-p16"></span>As to these threatenings, we have elsewhere
said, that all those who expected help from the Egyptians were willful
despisers of God; for the Prophet had often exhorted them all, quietly
and submissively to bear that temporary punishment which God had
resolved to inflict on them. They wished in their perverseness to drive
to a distance God’s judgment, and then when they saw that God was their
enemy, they deemed it enough to have the Egyptians as their friends. It
was then no wonder that the Prophet allotted to them the sword, and
famine, and pestilence.

<span id="x.i-p17"></span>He then adds, *Whosoever passeth over to the
Chaldeans shall live* The condition, however, was very hard; *his soul,*
he says, *shall be for a prey, as* though he had said, “He who flees to
the Chaldeans shall only save his life, but must suffer the loss of all
his property,” as when a shipwreck is dreaded, there is no one who is
not ready to save his life at the loss of all his goods; and, therefore,
in extreme danger the merchants are wont to cast into the sea all that
they have, for they prefer to escape to the harbor empty and destitute
of everything, than to perish together with their riches. It was, then,
a hard condition; but the Prophet shews that they could not otherwise
escape; they were to give up their own country, and all other things,
and could only preserve their life. For this reason he says, that their
life would be for a prey to them, as when anything is snatched from the
fire, or as when one is exposed to plunder, he were content to take
something away by stealth, for otherwise, if he sought to take away many
things, he would have to contend with many enemies. The Prophet then
intimates that the Jews could not save themselves from death in any
other way than by casting away all they had, and by being solicitous
only to save life. He again repeats, *he shall live.* By this repetition
he more pressingly urged them, and with more earnestness exhorted them
to save their life.

<span id="x.i-p18"></span><span id="x.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p19"></span>Then follows a confirmation, *Given up shall
be this city into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and they
shall take it* The Prophet shews the reason why he exhorted the Jews to
flee, because the city would at length be taken. This is substantially
what he says.

<span id="x.i-p20"></span><span id="x.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p21"></span>Now the princes add, *Die let this man,
because in this manner,* or therefore, that is, on account of his bad
counsel, *he weakens the hands of the men of war, etc*. Here *hand* is
to be taken for valor, for deeds are mainly performed by the hands.
Hence to loosen or weaken the hands means the same as to render men
inert, or so idle as not to move a finger. Then the princes accused
Jeremiah on this account, that he terrified the men of war and thus
rendered them listless. It was a specious charge; but the slander had
nothing to support it; for Jeremiah could not have been condemned as a
public enemy to his country, when he earnestly exhorted them to flee and
gave no hope to the people, in order they might all, despairing of
deliverance, willingly surrender themselves to their enemies.

<span id="x.i-p22"></span>A question may be raised here, whether it is
lawful for a private individual to persuade subjects to violate their
oath of allegiance to their king or prince. I now call Prophets private
persons; for I have in view civil order. Jeremiah, indeed, sustained a
public character, for he was God’s Prophet; but as to the government of
the city he was a private individual, one of the people. It seems, then,
that the Prophet had passed over the limits of what is right, when he
persuaded the people to revolt, for that could not have been done
without forfeiting allegiance to the king. To this I answer, that the
Prophet was invested with a special command, and that, therefore, he did
nothing presumptuously or rashly. Though, then, the people had pledged
to the end their faith to the king, yet as God had now delivered the
city to the Chaldeans, the obligation of the oath ceased; for when
governments are changed, whatever the subjects had promised is no longer
binding. As, for example, when any country has a prince, he binds the
whole people to himself by an oath, so that they may all abide in their
allegiance. When any one invades that country, the subjects incur the
charge of perfidy if they come not forward and assist their prince, as
they had promised; but when a foreign enemy takes possession of the
whole land, the obligation of the oath ceases; for it is not in the
power of the people to set up princes, because it belongs to God to
change governments as he pleases. Since, then, this power belongs to God
alone, while a prince rules, the people ought resolutely to continue
obedient to him, as their legitimate prince, set over them by God. But
this was not at that time the case with the Jews; for though the
Chaldeans had not yet entered the city, yet God had declared that they
were its masters. The people, then, were not to wait until the Chaldeans
broke in into the city, burnt its houses, and killed all they met with;
but it ought to have been sufficient for them that the prediction of the
Prophet was the decree or sentence of God, by which they were given up
to the Chaldeans.

<span id="x.i-p23"></span>The question as to Jeremiah and all others in
similar circumstances, is now answered: for when any one sees only some
danger at hand, he ought not, on that account, to persuade the people to
forsake their prince; but every one who seeks to be God’s faithful
servant, will risk his own life in the defense of his king. When called
to his council, he will advise what is useful and right; but he will not
stir up commotions and tumults: on the contrary, he would rather die a
hundred times than cause the people to revolt either by his counsels or
by his influence. But the case of Jeremiah, as it has been said, was
peculiar; for God had made known his purpose as to the Chaldeans. Hence
Jeremiah did not only prudently persuade the people to do what he deemed
necessary, but he also discharged faithfully his *office* as a Prophet:
nor did he give any other counsel than what he had been commanded to
give: nay, he commanded them, by authority, to pass over to the
Chaldeans, for it was according to God’s will.

<span id="x.i-p24"></span>The princes, however, brought this charge
against him, that he *weakened the hands, etc*.; and added, *In this
manner he seeks not the good of the people, when he thus speaks,*
(*peace* here is to be taken for what is good or useful,) *but he seeks
evil* This they slanderously added, for Jeremiah, as far as he could,
consulted the public good, he wished the city to continue safe; had it
been in his power, he would have put to flight all the Chaldeans; but he
could not carry on war with God, under whose banner the Chaldeans
fought. Jeremiah then sought the good of the people, but he could not
resist God, and therefore he gave way to the divine decree: he saw no
other remedy than this, that the Jews should undergo a temporary
punishment, and be chastised by an exile, so that they might return
afterwards into their own country. Had it been possible, as I have said,
he would have kept the people from every injury; but this was not now
practicable; for God had pronounced that it was all over with the
kingdom and the city, until the Jews were punished by an exile of
seventy years. There was then a second good or benefit, so that exile
might be: more tolerable to the miserable, or captivity become milder:
and this good was, to come of their own accord to King Nebuchadnezzar,
and to suffer themselves to be led forth to the Chaldeans. This was the
second good.

<span id="x.i-p25"></span>Jeremiah then, seeing that the city, the
kingdom, and the Temple were not to stand, was anxious to urge with all
his might what remained to be done, in order that the city might at
least continue as it was, while the inhabitants migrated into another
land, so that afterwards they might return to it. This was the best
thing for the people, because God had determined to drive them all into
exile. It was then absurd to bring against him this unjust charge, that
he sought not the *good* of the people, but their *ruin.*

<span id="x.i-p26"></span>But as we said yesterday, all the sayings and
doings of the saints have been always unjustly condemned. And if the
same thing happen to us at this day, let us patiently bear it. We also
see that it has been always objected to the Prophets and faithful
teachers, as a crime, that they did not consult the public good, as all
ungodly men at this day bring the same charge against us, especially the
couriers, who take it as granted, that were anything changed, it would
be the cause of all kinds of disturbances; and hence they think, that
their religion could not possibly fall without ruin to the public good.
Hence it comes, that the free preaching of the Gospel is disliked by
them, as though it brought with it some public calamity. Therefore they
call us turbulent; and they say that we go astray through ignorance:
though we are not avowedly enemies to the public good, yet we do not
understand how kingdoms are to be governed; and hence we rashly stir up
the greatest tumults. All these reproaches we have to bear, as Jeremiah
did, when, with a quiet mind, he endured the hatred which the princes
unjustly produced against him, on account of his doctrine, which yet he
had announced by God’s command, and which was necessary for the safety
of the city and people; for the Jews could not, against God’s will,
remain in their city, from which God had resolved to remove them. When,
therefore, Jeremiah saw that the city could not be defended against the
Chaldeans, even had he been the only counselor of the king, and not
God’s Prophet, what could he have advised better or more beneficial,
than to anticipate the extreme cruelty of their enemies, and at least to
do all they could, that the city might not be burnt with fire, and that
the slaughter of the people might not be universal, but that they might
continue alive, with the loss only of their property? He could not then
have brought a better counsel. But, as I have already said, nothing is
deemed good or useful by the ungodly, except liberty perversely to
resist God. This was the reason why they so unjustly accused God’s
Prophet. It follows —

<span id="x.ii"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p1"></span><span id="x.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#005.md)<span id="x.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p2"></span>**5**. Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he
*is* in your hand: for the king *is* not *he that* can do *any* thing
against you.

<span id="x.ii-p3"></span>**5**. Et dixit rex Zedechias, Ecce ipsc in
manibus vestris; quia rex non potest erga vos quicquam.

<span id="x.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.ii-p5"></span><span id="x.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p6"></span>Zedekiah doubtless knew that wrong was done to
the holy Prophet; for though he wished him to remain as he was, yet he
knew that the Prophet had not threatened the people from ill-will or a
hostile mind; and he was thus conscious that he had to do with God
rather than with a mortal man. However this may have been, he knew that
Jeremiah was not an enemy to the public safety according to the charge
brought by the princes. He might then have wished to deliver the Prophet
from their hands, but he submitted to their fury; for he was divested of
all regal power, and was become, as it were, a slave to his own
counselors, on whom depended the government of the kingdom.

<span id="x.ii-p7"></span>They wrongly explain this verse, who think
that the king spoke honorably of his counselors, as though he had said,
that such was their prudence and dignity, that nothing could be denied
them. They pervert the meaning of the Prophet; for the king, on the
contrary, acknowledges here, that he was reduced to such a condition, as
though he were a private individual, he, in short, confessed that he was
the servant of servants; “Now I *see,”* he says, “that I am no king, but
that ye so rule, that, willing or unwilling, I am forced to yield to
you, even in the best cause.” There is then no doubt but that it was the
bitter complaint of the king when he said, *The king can do nothing
against you.*  <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)

<span id="x.ii-p9"></span>But Zedekiah deserved this degradation: for he
ought to have been from the beginning more teachable, and to submit to
God. But in the first place, as we have seen, he had despised prophetic
doctrine, and hearkened not to the voice of God; and in the second
place, he revolted perfidiously from the Chaldean king, and became thus
guilty of ingratitude, for when his nephew was dethroned, that is,
Jeconiah or Coniah, he obtained the regal power through the favor of the
king of Babylon. He had therefore been ungrateful in denying tribute to
him. But his impiety was the main cause of all evils. As then he had
been such a rebel against God, he deserved that the princes should prove
rebels to him. He then degraded himself, and deprived himself of royal
authority, when he refused submission to the word of God, and also when
he denied tribute to the king of Babylon. It was no wonder, then, that
God made him subject to the princes and counselors, who were yet his
servants.

<span id="x.ii-p10"></span>As to these couriers, their arrogance was
inexcusable in daring to condemn Jeremiah; for this was to take away
from the king his own right; *Die let this man,* for he is worthy of
death. Why was it that they were not content with accusing him, without
assuming also to be his sole judges? As, then, they treated the king so
disrespectfully, there is no doubt but they were despisers of God, when
they deemed as nothing the royal dignity. But as to the king, he reaped,
as I have said, the fruit of his own impiety, for he had not given to
God his due honor in embracing the truth taught by the Prophet. It was
therefore necessary, that he should be unworthily and contumeliously
treated, so that he dared not to *say* even one word in behalf of a just
and good cause. This was the reason why he said, *He is in your hands,
for the king can do nothing against you*

<span id="x.iii"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="x.iii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou invitest
us daily to thyself with so much kindness, and givest us also time to
repent, and then offerest to us the hope of mercy and salvation, if we
return to thee, — O grant, that we may not pass by such benevolent
warnings with deaf ears, but in due time attend to thee, and with true
and sincere acknowledgment of all our sins so surrender up ourselves to
thee, that we may find thee to be merciful; and that when we return to
thee we may so continue in obedience to thee, that we may be capable of
receiving thy constant kindness, until the full fruition of it shall be
given us in thy celestial kingdom, through Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="x.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="x.iv"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Forty-Eighth

<span id="x.v"></span>

<span id="x.v-p1"></span><span id="x.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#006.md)<span id="x.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.v-p2"></span>**6**. Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him
into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that *was* in the
court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the
dungeon *there was* no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.

<span id="x.v-p3"></span>**6**. Et tulerunt Jeremiam, et demiserunt eum
in puteum Malchiae filii Hammalech (in lacum, *proprie,*) qui erat in
atrio custodiae; et (itaque) demiserunt Jeremiam funibus; et in lacu non
erat aqua, sed coenum; et demersus fuit Jeremias in coeno.

<span id="x.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.v-p5"></span><span id="x.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.v-p6"></span>HERE is narrated the extreme presumption as
well as cruelty of the princes; for they cast the holy Prophet into a
pit, where he sank in the mire. It was a proof of hardened impiety not
to spare so excellent a servant of God; and it was also a savage
cruelty, when they had no cause of being so filled with rage, except
that Jeremiah had obeyed God, and faithfully performed the office
committed to him.

<span id="x.v-p7"></span>Let us at the same time learn from this
example, whenever it pleases the Lord to try our patience, to bear with
resignation what we see to have been borne by the holy Prophet. If,
then, we shudder at any time at the horrors of the cross, so that it may
seem hard to us to bear persecution, let us remember this example of the
Prophet. In a word, there is here, on the one hand, shewn to us, as in a
picture, the wickedness of the world; and on the other, the wonderful
constancy and also the singular meekness of God’s servant shine forth
gloriously.

<span id="x.v-p8"></span>Jeremiah then says, that he was *taken by the
princes and cast into a pit, which* *was in the court of the prison;*
and in that part, where one of the counselors dwelt, even *Malchiah the
son of Hamelech* And at the same time he describes the state of the
place, that it was a miry pit, so that he sank down in the mud. He does
not mean that he was covered with mud, but that he was fixed in it, as
the Hebrew word intimates; and we may thus rightly render the words, “He
lay fixed in the mud.” It now follows —

<span id="x.vi"></span>

<span id="x.vi-p1"></span><span id="x.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#007.md)<span id="x.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.vi-p2"></span>**7**. Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one
of the eunuchs which was in the king’s house, heard that they had put
Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;

<span id="x.vi-p3"></span>**7**. Audivit autem Ebedmelech Aethiops vir
eunuchus (*vel,* unus ex numero procerum, םיסרס *enim ut alibi dictum
fuit, non tanturn eunuchos vocant, sed etiam proceres et consiliarios
regis*) ipsc autem erat in domo regis (*per parenthesin hoc legendum
est,* audivit *ergo*) quod posuissent Jeremiam in lacum; rex autera
sedebat in porta Benjamin:

<span id="x.vi-p4"></span>**8**. Ebedmelech went forth out of the king’s
house, and spake to the king, saying,

<span id="x.vi-p5"></span>**8**. Et egressus est Ebedmelech e domo (vel,
palatio) regis, et loquutus est ad regem, dicendo,

<span id="x.vi-p6"></span>**9**. My lord the king, these men have done
evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have
cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place
where he is: for *there is* no more bread in the city.

<span id="x.vi-p7"></span>**9**. Domine, mi Rex, perverse egerunt viri
isti in onmibus quae fecerunt Jeremiae Prophetae, quando eum demiserunt
in foveam (*vel,* lacum,) uti subtus se morietur a fame (*hoc est,* prae
fame,) quia nullus panis amplius est in urbe.

<span id="x.vi-p8"></span> 

<span id="x.vi-p9"></span><span id="x.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="x.vi-p10"></span>Jeremiah relates here how he was delivered
from death; for he could not have lived long in the mire; partly,
because he must have died through want; and partly, he must have been
starved through cold and suffocated with the filth of the dungeon. But
God rescued him in a wonderful manner through the aid of Ebedmelech, an
Ethiopian. He was an alien, and this is expressly said, that we may
know, that among the king’s counselors there was no one who resisted so
great a wickedness. But there was one found, an Ethiopian, who came to
the aid of God’s Prophet.

<span id="x.vi-p11"></span>There is then implied here a comparison
between an Ethiopian, an alien, and all the Jews, who professed
themselves to be the holy seed of Abraham, who had been circumcised, and
boasted loudly of God’s law and covenant; and yet there was not one
among them, who would stretch forth his hand to the holy servant of God!
It may be there were some who pitied him, but courage was wanting; so
that no one dared to open his mouth, for it was a reproach to patronize
the holy man. They, then, preferred the favor of the ungodly to their
own duty. But there was an Ethiopian so courageous, that he dared to
accuse all the king’s couriers and the other princes. There is, then, no
doubt but that the Spirit by the mouth of the Ethiopian brought a
perpetual disgrace on the king’s princes, who passed themselves as the
children of Abraham, and boasted in high terms of God’s covenant. A
similar case is represented by Christ in a parable, when he says that a
Levite and a priest passed by a wounded man and disregarded him, but
that help was brought to him by a Samaritan. (<span
id="x.vi-p11.1"></span>[Lu
10:30-35](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#030.md)<span
id="x.vi-p11.1"></span>.) His purpose, no doubt, was to condemn the
Jews, even *the* Levites and the priests, for their barbarity in caring
nothing for the life of a miserable man in his extremity. So also, in
this place, the Ethiopian is set forth to us as an example, for he alone
had the feeling of kindness and humanity, so as to bring help to the
holy Prophet, and to rescue him, as it were, from immediate death and
the grave: but we see all the king’s couriers either wholly torpid or
influenced by the same spirit of rage and cruelty, as to be mortal
enemies to the holy man, because he freely and openly declared to them
the command of God.

<span id="x.vi-p12"></span>And Jeremiah says that *Ebed-melech heard,
etc*. We may hence conclude, that he was anxious about the safety of the
holy Prophet, and that he had his friends who watched the proceedings.
It is then added, that he was *in the palace,* but that the *king was
sitting in the gate of Benjamin;* for kings were wont to administer
justice in the gates, and to have there their tribunal; and it was there
that the people held their regular assemblies. *The king,* then, *was
sitting in the gate of Benjamin* But, in the meantime, his palace was a
place of execution and the den of robbers. We hence see that the sloth
of the king is here denoted, for he apparently performed the proper
office of a king, but neglected the principal part of it, for he
suffered a holy man to be east into a pit. As, then, he thus exposed the
Prophet’s life to the will of the princes, it is evident that he was but
an empty shadow, though he stood there as the judge of the people, and
had there a sacred tribunal.

<span id="x.vi-p13"></span><span id="x.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="x.vi-p14"></span>It now follows, that Ebed-melech *went forth
from the palace* and *came* to the king’s tribunal, that he might there
plead the cause of the Prophet. It is right to notice this circumstance
as well as the former. For if Ebedmelech had met the king accidentally,
he might have spoken to him in passing; but as he went forth from the
palace, it is clear that he had been meditating on what he was going to
do, and that he had not felt only a sudden impulse of compassion: but
that when he might have rested quietly in the palace, he came of his own
accord to the king to make known his complaint. And further, he did not
address the king in a room or in some private corner of the palace, but
he spoke to him in the gate, that is, in a public assembly. We hence see
that the previous circumstance commends to us the perseverance of this
man, for he was not only suddenly moved, but persevered in his holy
purpose; and the second circumstance commends to us his magnanimity, for
he did not shun ill-will, but openly and boldly spoke for Jeremiah
before the people; and he amplified the excellency of the Prophet by
bringing an accusation against the princes. He no doubt knew that he was
bringing himself into danger, but he exposed his own life that he might
aid the Prophet.

<span id="x.vi-p15"></span><span id="x.vi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="x.vi-p16"></span>He then said, that the king’s counselors had
*done wickedly in all the things which they had done against Jeremiah
the Prophet,* because they had cast him into the well: and he added,
*There he will die under himself,* or as some render it, and rightly,
*“in* his own place.” But the expression is striking, but cannot be
fully expressed in our language: for Ebedmelech meant that Jeremiah
would die, though no one molested him, though no evil or harm were done
to him by another. *He will,* then, *die in his own place,* that is, he
will die, if left where he is; because he lay, as it has appeared, sunk
in mire. And then he said, *He will die through famine;* for he had been
cast into the pit as into a grave. And as scarcity prevailed among the
whole people, Jeremiah could not have hoped for any aid; and bread, as
we shall hereafter see, could not have been thrown to him. Then
Ebedmelech says here first, that Jeremiah had been unworthily treated,
because he was *God’s Prophet;* for he honors him with this title, that
he might expose the impiety of the princes; and secondly, he shews how
miserably he lay in the pit, because no one could supply him with food,
and there was no more bread in the city. It now follows —

<span id="x.vii"></span>

<span id="x.vii-p1"></span><span id="x.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#010.md)<span id="x.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.vii-p2"></span>**10.** Then the king commanded Ebedmelech
the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up
Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.

<span id="x.vii-p3"></span>**10.** Et praecepit rex ipsi Ebed-melech
Aethiopi, Sume ad manum tuam hinc triginta viros, et educas Jeremiam
Prophetam e fovea antequam moriatur.

<span id="x.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.vii-p5"></span><span id="x.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.vii-p6"></span>We here see, what I have already said, that;
the Prophet’s deliverance was wholly from above. The king, smitten with
fear, had lately given over the holy Prophet to the cruelty of his
princes; and had confessed that he had no longer any authority: “for it
is not the king,” he said, “who now governs you.” As, then, the king had
not dared resolutely to contend against his princes:, how was it, that
he now ventured to extricate Jeremiah from the pit? We hence see that
the king’s mind had been changed; *because* he was lately so stunned
with fear, that he dared not to plead *the cause* of the holy man; but
now he commands the Ethiopian to *take him out from the pit* It then
appears that this was over-ruled by a divine power.

<span id="x.vii-p7"></span>But let us hence learn to be courageous, when
necessity requires, though there may not be a hope of a favorable issue.
Ebedmelech might have thought within himself that his attempt would be
in vain, however strenuously he might have pleaded for Jeremiah. He
might, then, have thus relinquished that purpose which he had so boldly
undertaken; for thus they who are over-wise are often led, as it were,
into inertness: “*What* can you effect? thou art but one, and they are
many; and then the thing is done. If the king himself has been forced to
yield to their fury, and thou being a private individual, with what.
confidence can you resist them? and further, a tumult will be raised,
and thou wilt perish in it; and in the meantime they will perhaps stone
with stones that unhappy man, whom thou seekest to help.” All these
things might have occurred to Ebedmelech, and thus he might have
desisted. But we see that he rested in confidence on God’s favor. Let
us, then, remembering his example, hope beyond hope, when God requires
us to do a thing, that is, when faith, the obligation of duty, demands
anything from us, and which may be done, if we close our eyes to all
obstacles and go on in our work; for events are in God’s hands alone,
and they will be such as he pleases. In the meantime it is simply our
duty to proceed in our course, though we may think that our labors will
be in vain and without any fruit. Ebedmelech happily succeeded, and how?
because he performed the part of a pious and upright man. Thus God will
extend his hand to us; whatever difficulties may meet us, we shall
overcome them all by his power and aid.

<span id="x.vii-p8"></span>*Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the
Ethiopian, Take hence thirty men with thee and extricate Jeremiah from
the well* Ebedmelech might even then have relinquished his undertaking;
for he might not have been able with thirty men to overcome so great a
power; for all the king’s counselors had united together, and no doubt
they had enlisted many others. We thus see that Ebedmelech did not rely
on human aid, but that being strengthened by invincible confidence he
undertook this office, so that he dared to draw Jeremiah out of the pit.
It hence follows —

<span id="x.viii"></span>

<span id="x.viii-p1"></span><span id="x.viii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#011.md)<span id="x.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.viii-p2"></span>**11.** So Ebedmelech took the men with him,
and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence
old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the
dungeon to Jeremiah.

<span id="x.viii-p3"></span>**11.** Et sumpsit Ebedmelech homines illos
in manum suam (*hoc est,* sub sua potestate,) et venit in domum regis,
nempe in locum sub thesauris; et sumpsit illinc veteramenta tractorum,
et veteramenta (*ad verbum*) corruptorum, et demisit ad Jeremiam in
lacum per funes.

<span id="x.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.viii-p5"></span><span id="x.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.viii-p6"></span>Here Jeremiah goes on with the history of
his deliverance. The courage of Ebedmelech ought ever to be noticed by
us, for he went immediately to the holy Prophet. And it is said, that he
*took* from some hidden place *old tatters,* <span
id="x.viii-p6.1"></span>*De vieux haillons,* as we call them. It is
properly a noun substantive. But if its harshness be displeasing, we may
give this rendering, *“old* tatters which had been dragged, and old
tatters which were rotten.” Yet some render the words thus, “Worn out
clothes and rotten clothes.” But the former is more properly the
meaning; for <span id="x.viii-p6.2"></span>סחב, *sacheb,* means to drag,
and it may be rendered in French, <span id="x.viii-p6.3"></span>*Vieux
haillons trainez, ou, qui avoyent traine* Then we have <span
id="x.viii-p6.4"></span>סלחים, *salechim, corrupted* or marred, <span
id="x.viii-p6.5"></span>*usez;* for <span id="x.viii-p6.6"></span>סלח,
*salech,* means to salt; but it is a verb in *Hophal,* and in that form
it means to corrupt. They were torn or rotten garments, <span
id="x.viii-p6.7"></span>*des vieux haillons a demi pourris* It is said
then that Ebedmelech took these old, torn, and rotten garments, and
which had been used. This ought to be carefully noticed; for it appears
that Ebed-melech was afraid of the violence of the princes, not so much
on his own account, but lest he should be hindered in effecting his
purpose.

<span id="x.viii-p7"></span>For if he had provided other things, he
might have been apprehended; report might have been brought to the
princes, who would have immediately assembled and put a stop to his
efforts. There is then no doubt but that Ebedmelech, being very
confident, prudently considered what might prevent him in his attempt of
bringing help to the holy Prophet. Hence it was, that he stealthily took
from a hidden place these worn-out and marred garments. This is one
thing. Then we see the miserable state of the holy Prophet; he lay half
buried in mud, and he was to be drawn out by ropes or cords, and to have
these torn and worn-out garments under his arms. And we are afterwards
expressly told for what purpose these clothes were sent down to him.

<span id="x.ix"></span>

<span id="x.ix-p1"></span><span id="x.ix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#012.md)<span id="x.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.ix-p2"></span>**12.** And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto
Jeremiah, Put now *these* old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine
arm holes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.

<span id="x.ix-p3"></span>**12.** Et dixit Ebedmelech Aethiops Jeremiae,
Pone nunc veteramenta tractorum et corruptorum sub axillis manuum tuarum
subtus funes: et fecit Jeremias sic.

<span id="x.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.ix-p5"></span><span id="x.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.ix-p6"></span>We find the same words here as before, *Put
now the old tatters, dragged or torn and rotten,*  <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) *under the pits of thy hands
underneath the cords.* This is an improper mode of speaking in Latin,
but not in Hebrew. Then it is, “Put them under thine armpits underneath
the cords.” This was to be done, lest the Prophet should receive any
hurt; for he was to be drawn up by the cords, and he was fixed in the
mud: and this could not have been done without lacerating his skin and
injuring his armpits, for that part, we know, is tender. Then Ebedmelech
ordered the Prophet to take these old tatters and to put them under the
cords, so that he might be drawn up by the men with the least injury.
This was the advice of Ebedmeleeh, and Jeremiah did as he was bidden.

<span id="x.ix-p8"></span>God thus delivered his Prophet in a wonderful
manner from death: but we hence see how miserable was his condition; for
the Prophet could not have otherwise escaped than by using these
worn-out and rotten tatters and by being drawn up by cords. There is no
doubt but that he had thought of the difficulty; for he had been there
now some time; and he was not so strong that he could trust to his own
arms, and he knew that his hands were not strong enough to hold fast the
cords. But he doubtless east all his cares on God and his providence.
Though then he does but briefly tell us that he did as he was bidden, he
yet has left us to consider how much confidence he had, when he
immediately obeyed, and did not decline what he might have justly
feared, that he was feeble and weak; nor did he know whether his hands
were strong enough to hold the cords, nor how the cords were to be
applied to his shoulders. He therefore did what Ebedmelech had told him,
for he knew that the advice came from God. It afterwards follows —

<span id="x.x"></span>

<span id="x.x-p1"></span><span id="x.x-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#013.md)<span id="x.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.x-p2"></span>**13.** So they drew up Jeremiah with cords,
and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court
of the prison.

<span id="x.x-p3"></span>**13.** Et extraxerunt Jeremiam funibus, et
extulerunt ipsum e fovea (*vel,* lacu;) et habitavit Jeremias in atrio
custodiae.

<span id="x.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.x-p5"></span><span id="x.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.x-p6"></span>We here see that the Prophet was rescued from
death, not however that he might be set at liberty, and sent home, for
that would not have been for his benefit, as he would have been taken
again by the king’s counselors. Ebedmelech could not, therefore, save
his life otherwise than by having him confined in another part of the
prison. He could have wished, no doubt, to have him as a guest in his
own house: he doubtless wished to do for him more than he did. But his
prudence deserves to be commended, that he placed the Prophet again in
prison; for otherwise the fury and cruelty of the princes could not have
been mitigated. Then *Jeremiah dwelt in the court of the prison.*

<span id="x.x-p7"></span>He was evidently led there by Ebedmelech. If
one were to object and say that this was a proof of too much timidity;
to this the answer is, that Ebedmelech was not fearful on his own
account, but because he saw that he had to do with wild beasts; and he
saw that their rage could not otherwise be calmed than by having
Jeremiah confined in the prison. Indeed, the whole city was then like a
prison, as it is well known; for they were oppressed everywhere with
want, and no one could hardly go out of his house. This state of things
was then wisely considered by Ebedmelech, for he had not only his own
business to attend to, but he also labored to preserve God’s Prophet.

<span id="x.x-p8"></span>When God at any time relieves our miseries, and
yet does not wholly free us from them at once, let us bear them
patiently, and call to mind this example of Jeremiah. God, indeed,
manifested his power in delivering him, and yet it was his will that he
should continue in prison: even thus he effects his work by degrees. If
then the full splendor of God’s grace does not shine on us, or if our
deliverance is not as yet fully granted, let us allow God to proceed by
little and little; and the least alleviation ought to be sufficient for
comfort, resignation, and patience. It now follows, —

<span id="x.xi"></span>

<span id="x.xi-p1"></span><span id="x.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#014.md)<span id="x.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.xi-p2"></span>**14.** Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took
Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that *is* in the
house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a
thing; hide nothing from me.

<span id="x.xi-p3"></span>**14.** Et misit rex Zedechias et tulit (*hoc
est,* accersivit) Jeremiam Prophetam ad se ad ingressum tertium, qui
erat in domo Jehovae (*hoc est,* in ipso Templo,) et dixit rex ad
Jeremiam, Ego interrogo to verbum, ne celes a me verbum (*hoc est,* Ego
rem unam abs to quaero, ne quicquam celes.)

<span id="x.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.xi-p5"></span><span id="x.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.xi-p6"></span>Here is added another narrative, — that King
Zedekiah again sent for Jeremiah to come to him in the Temple, that is,
in the court of the Temple; for it was not lawful for the king to enter
into the Sanctuary, and the court is often called the Temple. But there
were, as it is well known, many entrances. The largest gate was towards
the east, but there were gates on the other sides. The court also had
several parts, separated from each other. Then Zedekiah, that he might
speak privately to Jeremiah, came to the third entrance of the court,
and there he asked the Prophet faithfully to explain to him what he had
received from God.

<span id="x.xi-p7"></span>There is no doubt but that Zedekiah in course
of time entertained a higher regard for Jeremiah as God’s faithful
servant. Yet he was not, as we have said, really attentive to the
teaching of the Prophet. Hence the mind of the king was in a dubious
state, like those hypocrites, who, having some seed of God’s fear
remaining in them, fluctuate and continually change, and have nothing
solid and fixed. They dare not, indeed, to despise either God or his
servants; nay, they acknowledge that they are under God’s authority, and
that his word is not evanescent; and yet they make evasions as much as
they can, and seek to change, as it were, the nature of God. Such was
the character of Zedekiah. For he was not one of those who grossly and
openly despise God, as we see at this day, the world being full of
Epicureans, who regard religion as a fable. Such, then, was not
Zedekiah, but he retained some fear of God; nay, he even shewed regard
for the Prophet; and yet he was unwilling to submit to God, and to
follow the counsels of the Prophet. He was, therefore, suspended, as it
were, between two opinions. But it is probable that he entertained some
hope, because he had saved the life of Jeremiah. he might, then, have
thought that God was pacified, or that he would remit in some degree his
severity, as hypocrites always flatter themselves. For if they do the
least thing, they think that they merit some favor, I know not what, at
God’s hand. Hence Zedekiah, when he had relieved the holy Prophet, and
fed him during the greatest scarcity, thought that this service was
acceptable to God; and it was in part acceptable; but he was mistaken in
thinking this to be a kind of expiation. Hence then it was that he sent
for the Prophet; he expected some favorable answer, even that God’s
wrath was pacified, or at least mitigated. But we must defer the rest
till to-morrow.

<span id="x.xii"></span>

<span id="x.xii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="x.xii-p2"></span>Grant, omnipotent God, that since the life of
thy servants ought to be deemed precious by us, each of us, according to
his ability may strive to do his part in this respect, and, in the
meantime, so cultivate mutual love as to assist one another in time of
necessity, and that we may also be so solicitous respecting thy
servants, as to consecrate all our efforts, all our labors, and all our
services to thee, and strive thus to please thee, so that all our doings
may be directed to this end, until, having at length finished the course
of our present warfare, we shall come to that rest in thy celestial
kingdom, which has been procured for us by the blood of thine
only-begotten Son. — Amen.

38:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#015.md)<span id="x.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.xiv-p2"></span>**15.** Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If
I declare *it* unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I
give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?

<span id="x.xiv-p3"></span>**15.** Et dixit Jeremias ad Zedechiam, Si
annuntiavero tibi, an non interficiendo interficies me? et si consilium
dedero tibi, non auscultabis mihi (non audies ad me, *ad verbum.*)

<span id="x.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.xiv-p5"></span><span id="x.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.xiv-p6"></span>THE Prophet seems here to have acted not very
discreetly; for when he ought of his own accord to have announced to the
king the destruction of the city, being asked he refused to answer, or
at least he took care of his life, and secured himself from danger
before he littered a word. And the Prophets, we know, disregarding their
own life, ought to have preferred to it the commands of God, as we find
was often the case with Jeremiah, who frequently at the risk of his life
proclaimed prophecies calculated to rouse the hatred of all the people,
and to create the greatest danger to himself. It seems, then, that he
had made no good progress, since he now fails, as it were, in this
hazardous act of his vocation, and dares not to expose himself to
danger.

<span id="x.xiv-p7"></span>But it ought to be observed, that the
Prophets had not always an express command to speak. For had God bidden
Jeremiah to declare what we shall hereafter meet with, he would not have
evaded the question; for he had been so trained up for a long time, that
he feared not for himself so as to turn aside from the straight course
of his office. That he now, then, seems to draw back, this he did
because God had not as yet commanded him to explain to the king what we
shall presently see. For he would have done this without benefit: and he
had often admonished the king, and had seen that his counsel was
despised. No wonder, then, that he was unwilling to endanger his life
without any prospect of doing good. If any one brings this objection,
that it is then lawful for us to do the same; to this I answer, that we
are not thoughtlessly to cast pearls before swine; but until we try
every means, we ought to hope for the best, and therefore to act
confidently. But Jeremiah had fully performed his duty: for the king
could not have pleaded mistake or ignorance, since the Prophet had so
often testified that there was no other remedy for the evil but to pass
over to the Chaldeans.

<span id="x.xiv-p8"></span>As then the Prophet had so often warned the
king, he might now be silent, and thus excuse himself, “Thou *wilt kill
me,* and at the same time *thou wilt not believe me,* or, thou wilt not
obey, if I give thee counsel.” These two clauses ought to be read
together; for if Jeremiah had seen that there was a prospect of doing
good, he would doubtless have offered his life a sacrifice. But as he
saw that his doe-trine would be useless, and that his life was in
danger, he did not think it right rashly to expose his life, when he
could hope for no benefit. The Prophet then did not regard only his own
danger, but was also unwilling to expose heavenly truth to scorn, for it
had often been already despised. He then did not answer the king’s
question, because he was convinced that he would be disobedient, as he
had ever been up to that very time. It follows —

<span id="x.xv"></span>

<span id="x.xv-p1"></span><span id="x.xv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#016.md)<span id="x.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.xv-p2"></span>**16.** So Zedekiah the king sware secretly
unto Jeremiah, saying, *As* the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I
will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of
these men that seek thy life.

<span id="x.xv-p3"></span>**16.** Et juravit rex Zedechias Jeremiae in
secreto, dicens, Vivit Jehova, qui fecit nobis animam hanc, si
interfecero te, et si tradidero te in manum istorum qui quaerunt animam
tuam.

<span id="x.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.xv-p5"></span><span id="x.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.xv-p6"></span>The king, desirous of having a new revelation,
promised safety to the Prophet by an oath. He then swore that he would
not take revenge, though he might be displeased with the Prophet’s
answer he might indeed have *conjectured,* though Jeremiah had not
expressly said anything, that the answer would be unfavorable, and by no
means agreeable to his wishes. For if some pleasant and joyful oracle
had been given to the Prophet, he would not have made a preface
respecting his own danger, and the wrath of the king, and also
respecting his obstinacy. Zedekiah then could have concluded, that
nothing but what was sad could be expected. For this reason he made an
oath, that whatever might be the answer, he would not be so offended as
to cause any harm to the Prophet.

<span id="x.xv-p7"></span>He said, *I will not kill thee, nor deliver
thee into the hand of those who seek thy life,* that is, who are enemies
to thy life: for to seek life is the same thing as to pursue man to
death. It is a way of speaking that often occurs, especially in the
Psalms. (<span id="x.xv-p7.1"></span>[Ps
38:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#012.md)<span id="x.xv-p7.1"></span>;
<span id="x.xv-p7.2"></span>[Ps.
40:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#015)<span id="x.xv-p7.2"></span>..md) Then
he refers to the mortal enemies of Jeremiah: and he promises at the same
time that he would, with undisturbed mind, receive whatever he might
hear from the Prophet.

<span id="x.xv-p8"></span>Let us notice the form of the oath, *Live does
Jehovah, who made for us this soul* He first made an oath by the life of
God, that is, by the immortal God. The word <span
id="x.xv-p8.1"></span>חי, *chi*, when applied to God, denotes a life
different from what is in men or in brute animals; for men live by the
will of another, that is, while God gives them life. It belongs then to
God alone to live, for we do not live, nor move, nor have any being but
in him, as Paul says, in <span id="x.xv-p8.2"></span>[Ac
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028.md)<span id="x.xv-p8.2"></span>; and
hence he teaches us in another place, that God alone is immortal. (<span
id="x.xv-p8.3"></span>[1Ti 6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md)<span
id="x.xv-p8.3"></span>) At the same time comprehended in this word is
everything that peculiarly belongs to God; for God does not live to
enjoy ease and indulge in idleness, but to govern the universe, to
exercise his power throughout heaven and earth, to judge men, to render
to every one his own just reward. Then life in God is not an idle life,
as ungodly men imagine, but includes his infinite power, justice,
wisdom, and all that peculiarly belongs to him. Whenever then we speak
of the life of God, let us know that we do not live but through him, and
also that he does not sit idly and carelessly in heaven, but that he
governs the whole world, and is the judge of men.

<span id="x.xv-p9"></span>According to this meaning, then, Zedekiah
said, *Live does Jehovah*, and then he added, *who made for us this
soul*. He expresses more clearly what I have already stated, and it is
the same as though he had offered his own life before God as a pledge.
He then prayed for the punishment of perjury on himself; for when he
made an oath by God, the giver of life, it was the same as though he had
said, “Let my life be forfeited, if I deceive thee, or turn false.” We
hence see what is the end of an oath, even that God’s sacred name may be
for us a pledge, that our word may be relied on. It hence follows, that
God’s name, whenever we swear, cannot be taken with impunity: for we
expose our life to his judgement, that he may revenge the wrong done to
him; for his name, as it is sufficiently known, is profaned by
perjuries. It now follows —

<span id="x.xvi"></span>

<span id="x.xvi-p1"></span><span id="x.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#017.md)<span id="x.xvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.xvi-p2"></span>**17**. Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah,
Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt
assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul
shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt
live, and thine house:

<span id="x.xvi-p3"></span>**17**. Tunc dixit Jeremias ad Zedechiam, Sic
dicit Jehova, Deus exercituum, Deus Israel, Si egrediendo egressus
fueris ad proceres regis Babylonis, vivet anima tua, et urbs ista non
consumetur (non incendetur) igni, sed vives tu et domus tua.

<span id="x.xvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.xvi-p5"></span><span id="x.xvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.xvi-p6"></span>A question may be raised here, Whether God
had again bidden his Prophet to repeat what he had so often spoken in
vain? To this we cannot say anything certain, except that the
probability is, that the Prophet did not open his mouth without being
guided by the Holy Spirit. For though he had not received any new
command, yet the Spirit of God influenced him, and ruled his tongue as
well as his heart. We shall indeed presently find, that what was nigh at
hand had been revealed to him; not what he had before, but it was added
as a new confirmation of former doctrine. But this is only a probable
conjecture; let then every one take his own view of the question.

<span id="x.xvi-p7"></span>That he might now gain credit to his answer,
he prefaced it by saying, that he did not speak except from God’s mouth.
He had often declared this, having testified that what he said was made
known to him by God. But it is not now known whether he had been bidden
to repeat the same things; though it is certain that he did not make a
wrong use of God’s name, nor did he, without authority, assert that it
was God’s word. The Spirit, therefore, as I have said, was his guide and
ruler, though we may grant that he did not receive any divine command.

<span id="x.xvi-p8"></span>He calls God, *the God of hosts, and the God
of Israel. By* the first title he denotes the omnipotence of God; and by
the second, the covenant which he had made with the Jews. He then did
set forth the immeasurable power of God, that he might make Zedekiah to
fear; for hypocrites, though they are constrained to dread God’s name,
yet afterwards do, in a manner, become hardened: it is therefore
necessary to rouse them, as the Prophet did here. He then touched on the
impiety of Zedekiah; for he not only professed himself to be one of
God’s elect people, but he was also the king and head; he ruled over the
heritage of the Lord. And yet he did not believe any of the prophecies.
There is therefore implied a reprobation, when the Prophet says, *the
God of Israel*

<span id="x.xvi-p9"></span>A mitigation of punishment is added, provided
Zedekiah willingly put his neck under the yoke. And it was no common
mercy from God, that he could yet escape extreme punishment; for he was
unworthy to be regarded by God, since for some years he had not attended
to what he had heard from the mouth of Jeremiah, that he was to
surrender himself, his people, and the city to the Chaldeans. he had
refused, nay, he had been refractory and obstinate against God. We hence
see, that he was unworthy of any alleviation; and yet God was still
ready to forgive him, as to his life, provided he passed over, of his
own accord, to the Chal-deans. And thus he was made more inexcusable,
inasmuch as when he heard that God would be propitious if he submitted
to due punishment, he was still unwilling to obey, as afterwards we
shall see. And thus we see that Jeremiah had not said without reason,
“If I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hear nor obey me;*”* for the
event proved this. This is one thing. Then he said, *Thou shalt live;*
and in the first place, he said, *Thy soul shall live;* and then, *This
city shall not be burned, and thou shalt live;* and he repeated the
words, *Thou shalt live, thou and thy house* Now follows the threatening
—

<span id="x.xvii"></span>

<span id="x.xvii-p1"></span><span id="x.xvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#018.md)<span id="x.xvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.xvii-p2"></span>**18.** But if thou wilt not go forth to the
king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand
of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not
escape out of their hand.

<span id="x.xvii-p3"></span>**18.** Si vero non egressus fucris ad
proceres regis Babylonis, tradetur urbs ista in manum Chaldaeorum, et
exurent eam igni, et tu non evades e manu ipsorum.

<span id="x.xvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.xvii-p5"></span><span id="x.xvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.xvii-p6"></span>The Prophet gave to the king the hope of
pardon; not that he promised impunity, but that the king might at least
hope that God would be merciful to him, if he anticipated his extreme
vengeance. But as hypocrites are not easily moved when God allures them
by the sweetness of his promises, hence a threatening is added, “Except
thou deliverest thyself *up,”* says the Prophet, “to the. Chaldeans,
thou shalt not escape, and the city shall be taken and burnt by the
Chaldeans.”

<span id="x.xvii-p7"></span>Zedekiah might have had hope in part, and
thus have found the mercy which God offered to him. As he had profited
nothing in this respect, it was necessary, in another way, to arouse
him, by setting before him the destruction of the city, and his own
death. But he was not prevailed upon either by fear or by hope, to obey
the advice of the Prophet. We hence see, that though he did not avowedly
despise God, he was yet neither cold nor hot, but wished to be wholly
spared. Hence then it was, that he rejected the favor offered to him by
the Prophet. However his excuse follows —

<span id="x.xviii"></span>

<span id="x.xviii-p1"></span><span id="x.xviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#019.md)<span id="x.xviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.xviii-p2"></span>**19.** And Zedekiah the king said unto
Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest
they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.

<span id="x.xviii-p3"></span>**19.** Et dixit rex Zedechias ad Jeremiam,
Ego metuo (*vel,* crucior) ob Judaeos qui defecerunt ad Chaldaeos
(*vel,* solitus sum, *vel,* timeo, et metuo Judaeos ipsos,) ne forte
tradant me in manum ipsorum, et contumelia me afficiant (*alii vertunt,*
illudant mihi.)

<span id="x.xviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.xviii-p5"></span><span id="x.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.xviii-p6"></span><span id="x.xviii-p6.1"></span>Zedekiah
seems, here <span id="x.xviii-p6.2"></span>to <span
id="x.xviii-p6.3"></span>have had a good reason why he should not
immediately obey the Prophet. And often the best of the faithful openly
set forth their anxieties, and we have seen that even the Prophet, when
any apprehension of danger was entertained, sometimes mentioned it. It
was not then a thing to be blamed, that Zedekiah ingenuously confessed
that he was prevented by the fear of those who had revolted to the
Chaldeans. For we know that subjects, having once cast off the yoke, and
violated their pledged faith, conduct themselves in an insolent way; for
they know that those to whom they have not performed their duty would be
implacable to them. Zedekiah then was justly anxious, and his simplicity
in explaining to the Prophet his fear, seemed worthy of an excuse, for
he seemed to give some sign of obedience. But the event at length will
shew us, that he was so bound by fear, that he refused the counsel of
God and the Prophet. It often happens, as I have just said, that the
faithful also fear, and thus vacillate or stand still, when God commands
them anything hard and difficult, and they would willingly withdraw from
the contest, but they at length obey God, and surrender their own
thoughts, and submit in obedience to God. But Zedekiah so feared,  <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) <span id="x.xviii-p7.2"></span> that
he could not partake of God’s goodness promised to him.

<span id="x.xviii-p8"></span>We hence see what the faithful have in
common with the reprobate, and also how they differ from one another. At
first the faithful fear as well as the unbelieving; they are anxious,
they vacillate, and *make* known their perplexities: the unbelieving at
the same time indulge themselves, and become hardened in their perverse
purposes; but the faithful fight with themselves, and subject their
thoughts to the will of God, and thus overcome fear by faith; they also
crucify the flesh, and give themselves up wholly to God. We have seen
the same thing before in the Prophet. But we shall now see the obstinacy
of King Zedekiah, to which we have referred. Then Zedekiah feared lest
the Jews, who had revolted to the Chaldeans, should treat him with
insolence. The Prophet thus answered him —

<span id="x.xix"></span>

<span id="x.xix-p1"></span><span id="x.xix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:20-22](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#020.md)<span id="x.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.xix-p2"></span>**20.** But Jeremiah said, They shall not
deliver *thee.* Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I
speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.

<span id="x.xix-p3"></span>**20.** Tunc dixit Jeremias, Non tradent te,
audi agedum vocem Jehovae quam tibi profero (quam ego loquar ad te,) et
tibi erit bene (tibi bene cedat,) et vivet anima tua:

<span id="x.xix-p4"></span>**21.** But if thou refuse to go forth, this
*is* the word that the LORD hath shewed me:

<span id="x.xix-p5"></span>**21.** Quod si tu abnueris ad egrediendum
(*hoc est,* recusaveris egredi,) hic est sermo quem ostendit mihi
Jehova;

<span id="x.xix-p6"></span>**22.** And, behold, all the women that are
left in the king of Judah’s house *shall be* brought forth to the king
of Babylon’s princes, and those *women* shall say, Thy friends have set
thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire,
*and* they are turned away back.

<span id="x.xix-p7"></span>**22.** Et ecce omnes mulieres, quae relictae
fuerint in domo regis Jehudah egrediuntur ad proceres regis Babylonis,
et ecce ipsae dicent, Suaserunt tibi (*alii,* deceperunt te*, vel,*
subduxerunt) et praevaluerunt tibi viri pacis tuae; defixi sunt in luto
pedes tui, conversi sunt retrorsum.

<span id="x.xix-p8"></span> 

<span id="x.xix-p9"></span><span id="x.xix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="x.xix-p10"></span>Here again Jeremiah strengthens Zedekiah,
that he might not hesitate to make the trial, since God would yet give
him pardon, so that at least his chastisement would be paternal and
light He then promised to Zedekiah that he would be safe from all the
insults about which he was anxious. *They will not deliver thee,* he
says; as though he had said, “Leave this to God’s providence, resign
thyself to God, and doubt not but that he will keep thee safe.” God, in
his kindness, as I have said, allows the faithful to cast their cares
into his bosom: but at the same time, if any disobey, when he confirms
them, it is a sign of deliberate wickedness, and such perverseness
extinguishes all the light of grace. Such was the stupidity of Zedekiah,
that he did not accept of this second promise. He might indeed have
confessed his fear, but he ought also to have received the remedy. The
Prophet assured him that his life would be safe in God’s hand; what more
could he have wished? But this was said to no purpose, because fear
fully occupied his mind, so that there was no entrance for the promise.
Now this ought to be carefully noticed; for there are none of us whom
many cares do not disturb, and many fears do not perplex; but a place
ought to be given to a remedy. God succors us when he sees us distressed
by anxious thoughts; but if fear so prevails, that all the promises by
which God raises us up avail nothing, it is a sign of hopeless unbelief.

<span id="x.xix-p11"></span>It afterwards follows, *Hear the voice of
Jehovah, which I utter to you, that it may be well with thee, and that
thy soul, may live* The promise is again added, to lead Zedekiah to
submit more willingly to God. For though we know that we cannot escape
his power, it will yet be dreaded by us, except he favors us with the
promises of grace. In this way, then, the Prophet endeavored to lead
Zedekiah to render obedience to God: *Hear,* he says, *the voice of
Jehovah, that it may be well with thee* He shewed that it was yet in the
power of Zedekiah to provide for his own safety, if only he obeyed the
word of God. And this passage teaches us, that the Prophet had not
spoken thoughtlessly and in vain, but under the guidance and teaching of
God’s Spirit For though it may not have been, that he had received a new
command, he yet knew that it was God’s will, that he should confirm and
reassert the previous oracles; for he did not falsely assume God’s name,
when he bade Zedekiah to hear God’s voice which he had made known.

<span id="x.xix-p12"></span>Now, though this discourse was especially
directed to Zedekiah, we may yet conclude, that it is always for our
good to embrace whatever God declares to us, though it may apparently be
hard and unpleasant, as it was to Zedekiah; for it was by no means an
agreeable thing to him to deliver up himself to his enemies, to be
deprived of his regal power, to be drawn into exile, and from a king to
become a slave; and yet nothing was better for him, in order to save his
life, than to obey God. Though, then, the words of God contain what is
contrary and grievous to our flesh, yet let us feel persuaded that God
always speaks what is good for our salvation. It would then have been
well for Zedekiah, had he obeyed the counsel of the Prophet; for he
would have found in captivity that God would be propitious to him, and
this would have been an invaluable comfort; and then he might have been
brought back from exile, at least he would have preserved the city and
the Temple: but by his obstinacy he betrayed the city to his enemies,
and hence it was also that the Temple was burnt.

<span id="x.xix-p13"></span><span id="x.xix-p13.1"></span>

<span id="x.xix-p14"></span>He then adds, *If thou refuse to go forth,
this is the word which God hath shewed to me* Jeremiah again declares
that Zedekiah resisted in vain, because he kicked, as it is said,
against the goad, for he could not possibly escape from coming into the
hand of his enemies; which, when done, then neither the city nor the
Temple would be spared. But the Prophet repeats again, that it had been
shewn to him what to speak, he then spoke not in his own name, but by
God’s command; which, it may be, was not then given him: but the Prophet
knew that God’s decree, of which he had been the herald, could not be
abolished. He then says, that this word had been shewed to him by God,
even what follows —

<span id="x.xix-p15"></span><span id="x.xix-p15.1"></span>

<span id="x.xix-p16"></span>*Behold, the women who as yet remain in the
palace of the king, shall go forth to the princes of the king of
Babylon,* that is, having left the city they will betray thee to thine
enemies; and they *shall say, The men of thy peace have deceived thee,*
or persuaded thee, *and have prevailed; thus fixed in the mire are thy
feet, and they have turned backward* There is here a part stated for the
whole, for under one thing is included the whole calamity of the city.
We indeed know that the female sex do not stand in the ranks to fight,
and that when a city is taken, women are commonly spared. When,
therefore, the Prophet says, *Go forth shall women who are yet remaining
in the king’s palace,* it is the same thing as if he had said, “Even the
women shall be compelled to go forth to the enemies, and give themselves
up into their power; what then will become of the men, when such shall
be the hard condition of the women?”

<span id="x.xix-p17"></span>We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet:
*Go forth then shall women,* that is, when the city is taken, the women
in the palace shall be drawn forth from their hiding-places, and be
constrained to appear before their enemies. And then he adds, *and,
behold, they shall say, etc*. He used the particle <span
id="x.xix-p17.1"></span>הנה, *ene,* twice, in order to lead Zedekiah
into the very scene itself; for it is necessary thus to rouse those who
are torpid in their apathy. *And, behold,* he says, *they will say* Here
Jeremiah declares that women would be witnesses to bear testimony to the
folly of the king, and also to the wickedness and obstinacy of the
princes, as though he had said, *“Thou* wilt not obey me to-day, and thy
counsel-lors also pertinaciously resist; God has already pronounced
judgment on you: ye despise, and regard it as nothing: God will at
length rouse up women, who will openly proclaim thy folly, O king, and
the perverseness of thy counselors, for having despised all the
prophecies.”

<span id="x.xx"></span>

<span id="x.xx-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="x.xx-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou daily
invitest us to repentance by constant exhortations, we may seriously
reflect on thy goodness, and in due time return to thee and submit to
thy will, and never refuse to undergo the punishment thou layest on us;
and that we may not in the meantime so provoke thy extreme vengeance, as
to find thee a rigorous judge, but ever experience, even under
punishment, thy paternal mercy, until we shall at length come to the
fullness of that joy which is laid up in heaven for us in Christ Jesus
our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="x.xxi"></span>

<span id="x.xxi-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Fiftieth

<span id="x.xxi-p2"></span>We, were obliged yesterday to break off where
the Prophet said to King Zedekiah that women would be his judges, and
that for a heavier reproach to him, because he refused to believe the
oracles of God. Though the Prophet had often exhorted him to repent, he
had yet refused all his admonitions. Therefore Jeremiah here declares
that he would have to bear the punishment he had deserved, even that the
very women would openly speak of his folly and of the perfidy of all the
princes. *They shall* then *say, They have persuaded* or seduced *thee,*
as some read, and others, “have driven thee,” which I should prefer,
were it the common meaning, for it immediately follows, *and have
prevailed over thee;* but we may simply take it in its proper sense,
because they had perfidiously persuaded the king.

<span id="x.xxi-p3"></span>He calls them *the men of peace,* from whom
acts of kindness might have been expected. We indeed know that friends
and associates were thus called by the Hebrews. Peace does not only mean
unity, but what is more, even friendship, such as ought to be between a
king and his counselors. Jeremiah, no doubt, sought in this case to try
whether Zedekiah was yet capable of being recovered; for he foretells
that women would announce this as from a judicial throne; but as I have
said yesterday, and as we shall hereafter see, he spoke to the deaf.

<span id="x.xxi-p4"></span>It is then added, *Fixed are thy feet in the
mire* This is to be taken metaphorically. He might have secured his own
life, had he passed over to the enemy, and thus a willing surrender
might have been, as it were, the price for his liberation; but he chose
rather to live in his own nest: and the Prophet says that this torpor
would be like clay, in which he would he fixed. What follows, *turned
are they backward,* is, in my judgment, improperly applied to the
princes. I read the words in connection with the former, *Fixed are thy
feet in the clay, turned backward;* for everything happened to the king
contrary to what he hoped.  <span id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) It
follows —

<span id="x.xxii"></span>

<span id="x.xxii-p1"></span><span id="x.xxii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#023.md)<span id="x.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxii-p2"></span>**23.** So they shall bring out all thy
wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out
of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon:
and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.

<span id="x.xxii-p3"></span>**23.** Et omnes uxores tuas et filios tuos
deducent ad Chaldaeos, et tu non evades e manu eorum, quia in manu regis
Babylonis comprehenderis, et urbem hanc combures igni.

<span id="x.xxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.xxii-p5"></span><span id="x.xxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxii-p6"></span>Jeremiah pursues the same subject; but he
sets forth at large the calamity, that the king being at least
frightened with horror, might submit to a right counsel; for when we
hear that death is at hand, this indeed fills us with horror; and when
many evils are mentioned, we must necessarily be roused; and this, no
doubt, was what the Prophet looked for. Then he says that Zedekiah would
come into the hands of his enemies, hut he adds other indignities, which
would bring greater bitterness, *They shall draw out,* he says, *all thy
wives and thy children,* etc. Had Zedekiah been right-minded, he would
have preferred to die a hundred times, and thus to have died for them
all, than to have been the cause of so many evils. For we know that many
have boldly exposed themselves to danger in defending the chastity of
their wives; and doubtless such a reproach is far harder to be endured
by ingenuous minds than a hundred deaths. We hence see what was the
design of the Prophet; for he saw that Zedekiah could not be
sufficiently roused by merely setting his own death before him, hence he
added other circumstances, calculated to affect him still more, *They
shall draw out,* he says, *thy wives and thy children*

<span id="x.xxii-p7"></span>We hence learn how conjugal fidelity was
then with impunity violated. It was, we know, an ancient evil, but it
had now passed into general practice, so that it was, as it were, the
common law: and yet what God had once established continued unchanged,
even that every man should have only his own wife. As, then, polygamy
had so prevailed and had become so licentious among the Jews, we see
that the fear of God was in fact extinguished and all regard to purity.
More liberty was indeed allowed to kings, but they were not on that
account to be excused, because their life ought to have been an example
to others, a mirror of uprightness and chastity. When, therefore, they
married a number of wives, it became an intolerable evil. And now when
mention is made of *all the wives,* we conclude that the king had not
only three or four wives or concubines, but a large number, that he
might gratify his lust. hence then we learn how great was the corruption
of that age. It is also a wonder that the king was thus given to his
lusts, and not brought back to some degree of moderation when necessity
itself constrained him. We hence see that he must have been extremely
insensible in retaining so many concubines, when his only city was
hardly safe, and the whole country in the possession of enemies. But
thus perverse men despise God and his scourges. For though all confess,
according to the common proverb, that necessity is a mistress whom all
are forced to obey, yet the greater part struggle with necessity itself,
as we see was the case with Zedekiah, who refused to bend or turn,
though very poor and miserable, and who suffered nothing of his royal
pomp and splendor to be diminished. Hence it was that he had a large
number of wives or concubines, as mentioned here.

<span id="x.xxii-p8"></span>It then follows, *This city shalt thou burn
with fire* It is certain that the torch was not applied by Zedekiah, nor
was he the agent in the burning. But the Prophet reminded him that the
cause of all the evils might justly be attributed to his obstinacy; as
though he had said, that the Chaldeans would indeed be the authors of
the burning, as they would with their own hands set the houses on fire,
and yet that the first and the chief fault would be in Zedekiah himself,
because he obstinately resisted God.  <span
id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md)

<span id="x.xxii-p10"></span>But as to the women, this brief notice must
be added: other kings, indeed, had been very dissolute; but God now
applied the remedy when the court was purged from all its old filth. For
with Jeconiah, we know, the royal dignity ceased; and the city was
exposed to plunder; and yet some concubines remained; and these passed
as by hereditary right to other kings, as they succeeded to the wives as
to the kingdom. But when wickedness became incorrigible, all the
concubines were taken away also. It was then a sign of final
destruction. It follows —

<span id="x.xxiii"></span>

<span id="x.xxiii-p1"></span><span id="x.xxiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#024.md)<span id="x.xxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxiii-p2"></span>**24.** Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah,
Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.

<span id="x.xxiii-p3"></span>**24.** Et dixit Zedechias ad Jeremias, Vir
nesciat (*hoc est,* nemo sciat) de sermonibus istis, et non morieris
(*hoc est,* ne moriaris.)

<span id="x.xxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.xxiii-p5"></span><span id="x.xxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxiii-p6"></span>Here is seen the miserable condition of the
king. Had he no faith in the answer of Jeremiah, he would not have thus
feared. But he acknowledged that what he had heard from the mouth of the
Prophet was true. In the meanwhile he delayed and extended time as far
as he could, and chose rather to spend his life in trembling than to be
immediately freed from all care and anxiety. This was by no means to act
like a king; for had he any courage, he would not have waited to the
last hour. We indeed know that men of courage boldly meet death, when
they see no hope of honor remaining. Zedekiah had lost his authority; he
held indeed the title of a king, but he was without power; for he was
compelled servilely to obey his counselors; and now he feared his own
shadow, and yet protracted time, as I have said, as much as he could;
and on this account he requested the Prophet, that this conversation
might remain as buried.

<span id="x.xxiii-p7"></span>By saying, *thou shalt not die,* he did not
threaten the Prophet, but intimated that silence would not be less a
benefit to Jeremiah than to himself: “*Thou* wilt rouse the fury of all
against thyself, if thou speakest of this interview, for no one can bear
to hear anything of the ruin of the city: if then thou consultest thine
own benefit, say not a word of this, and let it not come to the people
nor to my counselors.” Under the color of an advice then he said to
Jeremiah, *“See lest thou die*  <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md)
He therefore did not speak threateningly.

<span id="x.xxiv"></span>

<span id="x.xxiv-p1"></span><span id="x.xxiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:25-26](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#025.md)<span id="x.xxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxiv-p2"></span>**25.** But if the princes hear that I have
talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare
unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and
we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:

<span id="x.xxiv-p3"></span>**25.** Et si audierint proceres quod
loquutus fuerim tecum, et venerint ad te, et dixerint tibi, Expone
(*vel,* narra) nunc nobis quod loquutus fueris ad regem, ne celes a
nobis (*hoc est,* ne celes nos quicquam,) et non occidemus te, et quid
locutus sit tecum rex:

<span id="x.xxiv-p4"></span>**26.** Then thou shalt say unto them, I
presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to
return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.

<span id="x.xxiv-p5"></span>**26.** Et tunc, (*copula enim resolvi debet
in adverbium temporis,* tunc) dices illis, Prostravi ego preces meas
coram facie regis (*hoc est,* suppliciter deprecatus sum regem,) ne
reduceret me in domum Jonathan, ut morerer illic.

<span id="x.xxiv-p6"></span> 

<span id="x.xxiv-p7"></span><span id="x.xxiv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxiv-p8"></span>Here again Zedekiah shews his anxiety, lest
Jeremiah should be apprehended, were the princes unexpectedly to assail
him; for he might in this respect have stumbled, though admonished. Then
the king intimated to him what to answer, in case the counselors came to
him and made inquiry respecting their intercourse. He then advised him
simply to say, that he *entreated* him not to send him back to the
filthy pit, where he almost perished. The miserable servitude of the
king appears now still evident; for he feared his own counselors, lest
they should revolt from him. he might easily have made a spontaneous
surrender of himself, but he dared not, lest he should be killed by them
in a tumult; and yet, on the other hand, he feared lest the princes
should despise him, and so redeem themselves by the sacrifice of his
life.

<span id="x.xxiv-p9"></span>We see in what straits he was, but God
rendered to him a just recompense for his obstinacy. It was indeed a
miserable thing to hear that the king’ was thus oppressed on every side,
but the cause of all this ought ever to be borne in mind; which was,
that he had despised God and his Prophet. He then deserved to be in this
state of anxiety, to fear death on every side, and not to be able to
extricate himself from those cares and perplexities which tormented him.

<span id="x.xxiv-p10"></span>Let us then learn to cast all our cares on
God, so that our life may be safe, and that we may have calm and
tranquil minds: otherwise what is written in the Law must necessarily
happen to us,

<span id="x.xxiv-p11"></span>“Our life will hang on a thread, so that we
shall say in the morning, Who will give us to see the evening? and in
the evening, How can we live to the morning?” (<span
id="x.xxiv-p11.1"></span>[Deut. 28:66](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#066.md),
[67](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#067)<span id="x.xxiv-p11.1"></span>.md)

<span id="x.xxiv-p12"></span>Lest then the same thing happen to us as to
this miserable king, let us learn to re-cumb on God, for this is the
only way to obtain peace.

<span id="x.xxiv-p13"></span>For though Zedekiah set before Jeremiah the
danger which he might bring on himself, if he confessed what took place
between them, he yet had a regard no doubt to his own safety, for his
care for the Prophet was not very great. *If, then,* he says, *the
princes will hear that I have spoken to him, etc*. We see here, that as
kings very curiously inquire into the sayings and actions of all, so
they in their turn are exposed to innumerable spies, who observe all
their secret proceedings. Zedekiah, as we have already seen, left his
palace, sought some secret place, and at the third entrance called to
him Jeremiah. This place might be deemed in some measure secret, yet he
knew that he was observed even by his own servants.

<span id="x.xxiv-p14"></span>Thus kings, while they seek immoderate
splendor, renounce the main good, which ought to be preferred to all
other things. For it is commonly said that liberty is an invaluable
gift, and it is very true: but were we to seek for liberty among
mankind, we should by no means find it in courts; for all there are
slaves, and slavery begins with the most elevated. Kings, then, while
they thus seek from their height to look down on all mankind, are
placed, as it were, in a theater, and the eyes of all turn to them, so
that no liberty remains for them; and they who hang on their favor are
also in constant fear. This, then, ought to be noticed by us; for there
is no one who does not seek splendor; but yet we know how anxious is the
life of princes. Their external appearance is indeed very flattering;
but we do not see what inward torments harass them. When, therefore, it
is said of Zedekiah, that he could not have a secret conference, it
hence appears that kings are by no means free.

<span id="x.xxiv-p15"></span><span id="x.xxiv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxiv-p16"></span>He says, “Though they promise thee
impunity, trust them not.” Zedekiah feared lest the Prophet should be
too credulous, and should freely relate to the counselors what he had
said. But he no doubt had reflected on the fact, that the Prophet had
already announced the destruction of the city. He then could have hardly
hoped for the silence which he required. Hence then it was, that he so
earnestly bid him to be careful; and though the counselors should
promise that there would be no danger to him, he yet bade him to be
silent. *Say to them,* he said, *I humbly prayed the king not to send me
back to the house of Jonathan, that I might not die there* It was not
indeed a falsehood, but this evasion cannot be wholly excused. The
Prophet justly feared, and, as we have before seen, he was perplexed and
anxious, for that prison was horrible, and it would have been better at
once to die than to have been thus buried alive in the earth. But it is
certain that he did not come to the king for this purpose, for he had
been sent for. Though, then, the Prophet did not expressly or in so many
words say what was false, yet it was a kind of falsehood; and what
follows, in reference to himself, cannot be excused.

<span id="x.xxv"></span>

<span id="x.xxv-p1"></span><span id="x.xxv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#027.md)<span id="x.xxv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxv-p2"></span>**27.** Then came all the princes unto
Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words
that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the
matter was not perceived.

<span id="x.xxv-p3"></span>**27.** Et venerunt cuncti proceres ad
Jeremiam, et interrogarunt ipsum; et annuntiavit illis (hoc est,
narravit illis) secundum sermones istos, quemadmodum praeceperat rex, et
siluerunt ab eo, quia sermo non fuit auditus.

<span id="x.xxv-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.xxv-p5"></span><span id="x.xxv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxv-p6"></span>Here, indeed, the Prophet confesses that he
did as the king had commanded him; but he does not commend what he had
done. There is no doubt but that on the one hand he placed before his
eyes the timidity of the king, who, being forgetful of plain dealing,
slavishly feared his own counselors; and that., on the other hand, he
manifested that he was not sufficiently discreet, for when the princes
came, even if he wished not to deceive them, he yet concealed the main
thing, and said that he went to the king to pray for his own life, which
was not true. Though then what he said was in part true, that he prayed
not. to be sent back to prison, yet he could not by this evasion be
wholly exempted from blame.

<span id="x.xxv-p7"></span>In short, we see that even God’s servants
have sometimes spoken evasively, when oppressed with extreme fear; and
thus we are reminded to seek of God magnanimity of mind and resolute
firmness; for he alone can strengthen and sustain us when we are
terrified by any fear of danger.

<span id="x.xxv-p8"></span>He says, that he *did as the king had
commanded him;* but he ought rather to have hearkened to God’s word, in
which simplicity is enjoined. It is also said, that the princes *were
silent,* that is, departed in silence; for no one had been a witness to
the conference, and the matter had not spread farther; for the king was
silent through fear, and the Prophet also had not made known the secret
interview. Hence it was that the princes departed, and thought that the
matter was as represented. In short, Jeremiah intimates that they were
deceived by this pretext. It follows at last, —

<span id="x.xxvi"></span>

<span id="x.xxvi-p1"></span><span id="x.xxvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
38:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer038.htm#028.md)<span id="x.xxvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxvi-p2"></span>**28.** So Jeremiah abode in the court of
the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was *there*
when Jerusalem was taken.

<span id="x.xxvi-p3"></span>**28.** Et habitavit Jeremias in atrio
custodiae, usque ad diem quo capta fuit Jerusalem; et accidit secundum
quod capta fuit Jerusalem.

<span id="x.xxvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.xxvi-p5"></span><span id="x.xxvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxvi-p6"></span>Some render the last words simply thus, “And
it happened that Jerusalem was taken;” and others, “It happened
accordingly that Jerusalem was taken;*”* but this seems unnatural.
Others take the relative as a demonstrative pronoun, and of this I
approve, “For it happened that according to this Jerusalem was taken.”

<span id="x.xxvi-p7"></span>He first says that he *dwelt in the court of
the prison.* It hence appears that he was not even then at liberty; for
though the king wished him to be free, yet he dared not to release him.
This is one thing. Then he says, that he *was there until the day the
city was taken* We shall hereafter see that he was saved by the king’s
command, and was brought out of prison. He was, then, until that day in
the court of the prison, as though he had said, that he was a prisoner
until the king was taken prisoner, together with his counselors, and
also until the day the whole city was taken. And here we may see, as in
a vivid form, the wonderful judgment of God. As long as the Jews boasted
that they offered sacrifices to God, they kept Jeremiah shut up in
prison, so that he was not a free man until the king was taken, the city
perished, and almost all were driven into exile. I have no doubt but
that he added the following by way of explanation, *And it happened that
according to this Jerusalem was taken;* that is, he reminds readers in
these words, that he had not been a false Prophet, but a true and
faithful witness as to God’s judgment, for all his prophecies were
verified by the event.  <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) He then
says that the city was taken, not by chance, but because God had so
declared. He now begins to narrate historically the destruction and the
burning of the city. He therefore says, —

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_109"></span>[110](cc20009.htm#fr_109.md) <span
id="x.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p8"></span> “The king,” observes *Blayney,* “evidently
speaks this in disgust with the princes, for endeavoring to frustrate
his clemency.” — Ed.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[111](cc20009.htm#fr_110.md) <span
id="x.ix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="x.ix-p7"></span> *Blayney* gives a better version, “torn rags
and worn-out rags.” The literal rendering is, “Rags of the torn, and
rags of the rotten.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_111"></span>[112](cc20009.htm#fr_111.md) <span
id="x.xviii-p6.4"></span>

<span id="x.xviii-p7"></span> The verb means trouble of mind or anxiety
rather than fear, “I am disturbed with regard to the Jews,” etc. The
*Vulgate* is, “I am solicitous,” and the *Targum.,* “I am anxious. Our
version, “I am afraid of,” is the *Syriac.* The king seems to have been
too proud to own that he had fear. The last clause in the verse may be
thus rendered, “And they exult over me.” The verb means to raise up or
elevate one’s self, and then the preposition <span
id="x.xviii-p7.1"></span>ב means over, or against. The king was
disturbed in his mind, being apprehensive of the taunts and insults of
those already gone to the Chaldeans. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_112"></span>[113](cc20009.htm#fr_112.md) <span
id="x.xxi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxi-p5"></span> Both the *Sept.* and the *Vulg.* take
*“fixed”* in a transitive sense, “They have fixed” or caused to sink;
and the last words are made to refer to the princes. As to the *Vulg.*
the two clauses are, “They have sunk thy feet in the mire and in a
slippery *place,* and have departed from thee.” The *Syriac.* as to the
last clause is the same.

<span id="x.xxi-p6"></span>The whole matter is related as seen in a
vision, given to the Prophet as he says in the previous verse, —

<span id="x.xxi-p7"></span>**21.** This is the thing which Jehovah made
me to see; and (*he said*) Behold the women, who have remained in the
house of Judah, going forth to the princes of the king of Babylon, and
behold them saying, — They have roused thee and prevailed over thee,
*even* thy friends; sunk have they in the mire thy feet, they have run
away from thee.

<span id="x.xxi-p8"></span>The scene, as seen in the vision, is
presented to the king, the women going out and then speaking tauntingly
to him. The princes roused or excited Zedekiah to break faith with the
king of Babylon, and prevailed on him to do so. By so doing they sunk
him as it were in the mire, that is, brought him to difficulties, and
then ran away from him. And then in the next verse the Prophet confirms
and explains the vision. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[114](cc20009.htm#fr_113.md) <span
id="x.xxii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxii-p9"></span> And this city shall be burnt with fire,” is
the rendering of the *Sept.,* the *Syriac.,* and the *Targum.* The
*Vulg.* is, “and he (the king of Babylon) will burn this city with
fire.” The first, no doubt, is the true version of the Hebrew, except
the verb *he* in *Hiphil,* according to our version, and also that of
*Blayney;* but what corresponds best with the passage is the former
rendering. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[115](cc20009.htm#fr_114.md) <span
id="x.xxiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxiii-p8"></span> The words literally are, “Let no man know
of these words, and thou shalt not die.” Such is the rendering of the
*Sept.,* the *Vulg.,* and the *Targum.;* the *Syriac.* is, “lest thou
die;” which suggests the view taken by *Calvin.* — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_115"></span>[116](cc20009.htm#fr_115.md) <span
id="x.xxvi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="x.xxvi-p8"></span> These words are left out in the *Sept.* and
the Syriac. The *Vulgate,* and the *Targum.* give this version, “And it
came to pass that Jerusalem was taken;” which seems not in this
connection to have any meaning. Some connect them with the following
chapter, but improperly. Our version, followed by *Blayney,* gives the
best sense, *“And* he was *there* (that is, in the court of the prison)
when Jerusalem was taken:“ He was there not only *to* the day or time of
its capture, but during that time. This was added to shew that he was
not released by the Jews, but by those who took the city. — *Ed*.
