<span id="viii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 36

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1**. And it came to pass in the fourth
year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, *that* this word came
unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span>**1**. Et fuit anno quarto Joakim filii
Josiae regis Jehudah (fuit inquam) sermo hic ad Jeremiam a Jehova,
dicendo,

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span>**2**. Take thee a roll of a book, and write
therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and
against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto
thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span>**2**. Sume tibi volumen libri, et scribe in
eo cunctos sermones quos loquutus sum ad to contra Israel et contra
Jehudah, et contra eunctos gentes a die quo loquutus sum ad to, a diebus
scilicet Josiae usque ad hunc diem.

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span><span id="viii.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p8"></span>The Prophet relates in this chapter a
history worthy of being remembered, and very useful to us; for he says
that he wrote down by God’s command what he had previously taught in the
Temple, and also that he sent that summary by Baruch to be recited in
the Temple, that the report of this spread, and that the king’s
counsellors called to them Baruch, and that when they heard what was
written in the volume, they brought word to the king, having, however,
first admonished Baruch to conceal himself, together with Jeremiah, lest
the king should be exasperated against them. And so it happened, for the
king, being instantly filled with indignation, ordered Jeremiah and
Baruch to be taken, that they might be put to death; but they were
hidden and protected through God’s favor. We shall hereafter see what
the king by his obduracy had effected, even to cause the Prophet to
speak more boldly against him.

<span id="viii.i-p9"></span><span id="viii.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p10"></span>The Prophet then says at the beginning,
that *the word of Jehovah came,* by which he was ordered to *write in a
volume of a book whatever he had previously spoken* By the volume of a
book he means the volume in which he was to write; for <span
id="viii.i-p10.1"></span>ספר *sepher,* does not here mean a written
book, for the volume was without any writing. Then the Prophet must have
dictated to his servant Baruch. And this mode of speaking occurs also
elsewhere, as in <span id="viii.i-p10.2"></span>[Ps
40:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.i-p10.2"></span>.
But the Hebrews, according to an ancient custom, called a volume <span
id="viii.i-p10.3"></span>מגלה*, megele;* for they had no books in a
compact form, such as we have in the present day, but had volumes or
rolls; and the same word, volume, is also used in Latin. For as the
Hebrews called what is folded up <span id="viii.i-p10.4"></span>מגלה*,
megele,* which comes from <span id="viii.i-p10.5"></span>גלל*, gelal,*
to fold up, or to roll; so the Latins also have derived it from a verb
*(volvo)* which means to roll, and we call it *rolle;* and in Gaul they
used the same form of writing; for all ancient documents and also
judicial proceedings were wont formerly to be written on rolls, and in
the old archieves there is nothing found but what is so written. God
then ordered his Prophet to take a roll, and then he commanded him to
*write all the words* which he had heard from the mouth of God, and
which he had pronounced against Israel, and against Judah, and against
all other nations.

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span>We see here, in the first place, what is
the benefit of having the Scripture, even that what would otherwise
vanish away or escape the memory of man, may remain and be handed down
from one to another, and also that it may be read; for what is written
can be better weighed during leisure time. When one speaks only, every
one takes in something according to his capacity and his attention; but
as words from man’s mouth glide away, the utility of Scripture does
hence appear more evident; for when what is not immediately understood
is repeated, it brings more light, and then what one reads to-day he may
read tomorrow, and next year, and many years after. As then God saw that
he had been, as it were, beating the air when he had spoken by his
Prophet, his purpose was that those things which Jeremiah had in vain
spoken, should be written down. In this manner he, no doubt, intended to
condemn both the king and his counsellors, and also the whole people,
not only for their idleness, but also for their insensibility, even
because all his teaching had been without fruit, though Jeremiah had
labored much among them, and had been assiduous and faithful in the
discharge of his office as a teacher.

<span id="viii.i-p12"></span>We now perceive the design of God in
saying, *Take a volume* and *write in it;* and he says, *all the words
which I have spoken to thee* This was said in order that the Jews might
understand that Jeremiah did not bring forward his own fictions, but
faithfully delivered what he had heard from God’s mouth. He adds,
*against Israel and affainst Judah* For Jeremiah at the beginning had
prophesied against the ten tribes; but after the kingdom of Israel was
cut off, he performed his office only towards the remaining people, so
that his doctrine referred especially to the Jews. It is added, *against
all nations;* and this we shall presently see; and it hence appears that
his prophecies were not written according to the order of time, as I
have before reminded you, but that the volume was written without regard
to order. It was yet so far preserved that this book contains a summary
of all the doctrine taught by Jeremiah during the whole course of his
ministry. He says, *from the day in which he began to speak,* even *from
the days of Josiah,* he says, *to this day* And the Prophet had been
performing his duty as a teacher, not for ten, or twenty, or thirty, but
for forty years. It follows, —

<span id="viii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#003.md)<span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>**3**. It may be that the house of Judah
will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may
return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity
and their sin.

<span id="viii.ii-p3"></span>**3**. Si forte audiant domus Jehudah omne
malum quod ego cogito ad faciendum *(hoc est,* facere) ipsis, ut
revertantur quisque a via sua mala; et propitius sim iniquitati eorum et
peccato eorum.

<span id="viii.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.ii-p5"></span><span id="viii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p6"></span>Here God explains the object he had in
view, even to make another trial whether the Jews were healable, so that
the teaching of the Prophet might be conducive to their salvation. But
he uses the particle <span id="viii.ii-p6.1"></span>אולי *auli,* “it may
be,” which implies a doubt; because they had so often, and for so long a
time, and in such various ways, shewed themselves to be so obstinate
that hardly a hope could be entertained of their repentance. God,
however, shews that he was not wearied, provided there remained in them
still the smallest particle of religion. *It may be then,* he says,
*that the house of Judah will hear all the evil, etc.*

<span id="viii.ii-p7"></span>We have seen how the Prophet labored, not
only to terrify his own nation by threatenings, but also sweetly to
allure them to the service of God; but God speaks here of them as of
perverse men, who were almost intractable, according to what is said in
<span id="viii.ii-p7.1"></span>[Ps
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)<span id="viii.ii-p7.1"></span>,
that God would be severe towards the perverse; for God deals with men
according to their disposition. As the Jews then were unworthy that God
should, according to his gentleness, teach them as children, this only
remained for them, to repent under the influence of fear. *It may be,*
he says, that they will *bear all the evil,* etc. We now see why God
touches only on threatenings, for this alone remained for men so
obstinate.

<span id="viii.ii-p8"></span>He says, *The evil which I think to do,*
etc. God here transfers to himself what belongs to men; for he does not
think or deliberate with himself; but as we cannot comprehend his
incomprehensible counsel, he sometimes assumes the person of man; and
this is what is common in Scripture. But he says, that he *thinks* of
what he *pronounces* in his word; for as long as God exhorts men to
repent, he holds, as it were, his hand suspended, and allows an
opportunity to repent. He then says, that he is, as it were, in the
midst of his deliberations: as when one wants to know whether an
offender will submit, so God transforms himself, in a manner, into what
man is, when he says, *I think;* that is, let them know that vengeance
is not in vain denounced in my word; for I will perform whatever I now
threaten, except they repent.

<span id="viii.ii-p9"></span>He says, *That they may turn every one from
his evil way* This is to *hear,* previously mentioned, even when men
become seriously touched, so as to be displeased with their vices, and
to desire from the heart to surrender themselves to God. He joins a
promise, for without the hope of pardon it cannot be, that men will
repent, as it has been often said; but it must be repeated, because few
understand that faith cannot be separated from repentance; and a sinner
can never be induced to return truly to God, unless he entertains a hope
of pardon, for this is a main truth, according to what is said in <span
id="viii.ii-p9.1"></span>[Ps
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md)<span id="viii.ii-p9.1"></span>,

<span id="viii.ii-p10"></span>“With thee is mercy, that thou mayest be
feared.”

<span id="viii.ii-p11"></span>Then, according to what is commonly done,
the Prophet says, that if the Jews turned to God, he would be propitious
to them, as though he had said, that men would not be disappointed, if
they repent, because God would readily meet them, and be reconciled to
them: for this one thing alone, as I have said, is what can encourage us
to repent, that is, when we are convinced that God is ready to give us
pardon. He mentions *iniquity and sin.* The Prophet, no doubt, referred
to these two words, in order to shew that we ought by no means to
despair, though sins be heaped on sins. It follows —

<span id="viii.iii"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p1"></span><span id="viii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#004.md)<span id="viii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p2"></span>**4**. Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son
of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of
the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.

<span id="viii.iii-p3"></span>**4**. Et vocavit Jeremias Baruch fillium
Neriae; et scripsit Baruch ex ore Jeremiae cunctos sermones Jehovae,
quos loquutus est ad ipsum, in volumine libri.

<span id="viii.iii-p4"></span>**5**. And Jeremiah commanded Baruch,
saying, I *am* shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:

<span id="viii.iii-p5"></span>**5**. Et praecepit Jeremias ipsi Baruch,
dicendo, Ego detineor *(vel,* sum conclusus) non potero venire in domum
Jehovae *(hoc est,* in Templum:)

<span id="viii.iii-p6"></span>**6**. Therefore go thou, and read in the
roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in
the ears of the people, in the LORD’S house upon the fasting-day: and
also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of
their cities.

<span id="viii.iii-p7"></span>**6**. Tu autem vade, et lege in volumine
quod scripseris ex ore meo, sermones Jehovae in auribus populi, in domo
Jehovae, in die jejunii, atque etiam in auribus totius Jehudab, qui
venerint *(hoc est,* omnium Judaeorum qui venerint) ex urbibus suis, tu
leges ipsis.

<span id="viii.iii-p8"></span> 

<span id="viii.iii-p9"></span><span id="viii.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p10"></span>Here the Prophet declares that he
dictated to Baruch, a servant of God, whatever he had previously taught.
But there is no doubt but that God suggested to the Prophet at the time
what might have been erazed from his memory; for all the things which we
have some time ago said, do not always occur to us. Therefore the
greater part of so many words must have escaped the Prophet, had not God
dictated them again to him. Jeremiah then stood, as it were, between God
and Baruch; for God, by his Spirit, presided over and guided the mind
and tongue of the Prophet. Now the Prophet, the Spirit being his guide
and teacher, recited what God had commanded; and Baruch wrote down, and
then proclaimed the whole summary of what the Prophet had taught.

<span id="viii.iii-p11"></span>He therefore says, that he *called to him
Baruch the son of Neria,* who wrote from his mouth, and he wrote *all
the words of Jehovah* Jeremiah repeats again that nothing came from
himself. We hence see that he did not dictate, according to his own
will, what came to his mind, but that God suggested whatever he wished
to be written by Baruch. It is added, that he commanded Baruch to recite
in the Temple what he had written, because he himself was detained. Some
think that he was shut up in prison; and he used the same word before,
when he told us that he was cast into prison by Zedekiah. But as sacred
history does not say that he suffered any such thing under Jehoiakim, I
am inclined to think that he was prevented by God; I do not, however,
ascribe it to a divine oracle; for it might have happened either through
God’s command, or through some human impediments.  <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) If we believe the Prophet to have been
in prison, and that he might have gone out, he yet abstained; for the
more liberty was given him, the more bound he felt himself to continue
in prison, lest he should violate public authority. But the other
supposition is more probable, that he was detained by God’s hand.
However this may have been, he says that he could not go forth; and he
mentioned this, lest it should appear that he was only careful as to
himself, and that through fear of danger, he devolved this duty on
Baruch. He then shews that he did not shun his office, because it
exposed him to hatred, but that he was not at liberty to go forth.

<span id="viii.iii-p13"></span><span id="viii.iii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p14"></span>*Go thou,* then, he says, *and read in
the volume* The Prophet, in this case, was ready to incur any odium
which might be, for he did not bid Baruch to relate by memory what he
had heard from him, but ordered him to take the volume, and to read, as
we shall hereafter see, what he had written. The Prophet then did not,
in this instance, avoid danger, and put Baruch in his own place, but he
expressly told him to read from the volume: *What thou hast written,* he
*says,from my mouth,* and, *what Jehovah has spoken,* these things *read
thou to the people in* the Temple, on *a fasting day* This day was
chosen, first, because there was then a greater concourse of people,
according to what immediately follows, for he was to read these things
in the ears not only of the citizens, but also of the whole people; and
on fast-days they were wont, as it is well known, to come in great
numbers to the city for the purpose of sacrificing. It was then God’s
purpose that these threatenings should be proclaimed, not only to the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, but also to all other Jews, that the report of
them might spread to every part of the land. In the second place, such a
day was much more suitable to the message conveyed; for why was a fast
enjoined, except humbly to supplicate God’s mercy, and to deprecate his
wrath? As then this was the design of a fast, the Jews ought to have
been then, as it were, in a submissive state of mind, prepared calmly to
receive these threatenings, and to profit by them.

<span id="viii.iii-p15"></span>We then see that there were two reasons
why the Prophet, by God’s command, fixed on this day, — first, because
there was a larger number of people, — and, secondly, because a fast
ought to have rendered them teachable, so that they might more readily
submit to God, acknowledge their sins, and, being terrified, might also
flee to God’s mercy, and thus loathe themselves on account of their
sins. The rest tomorrow.

<span id="viii.iv"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.iv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we cease not
continually to provoke thine anger against us, we may at length return
to thee, and that every one may so examine his life, that being
prostrate under a sense of thy wrath, we may betake ourselves to the
only true remedy, even to implore thee, and to seek forgiveness; and do
thou also so graciously meet us, that we may in sure faith call on thee,
and, in the meantime, find really, by experience, that our prayers are
not in vain, until we shall at length have a perfect enjoyment of thy
mercy, in thy celestial kingdom. — Amen.

<span id="viii.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="viii.v"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Forty-Second

<span id="viii.vi"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p2"></span>**7**. It may be they will present their
supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil
way: for great *is* the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced
against this people.

<span id="viii.vi-p3"></span>**7**. Si forte cadat precatio ipsorum
coram facie Jehovae, et convertantur quisque a via sua mala; quia magna
est excandescentia et magna iracundia quam locutus est Jehova contra
populum hunc.

<span id="viii.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.vi-p5"></span><span id="viii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p6"></span>Jeremiah, after having dictated to the
scribe Baruch what he had before preached to the people, repeats what
the object was, which we have previously observed; for it was God’s will
to make the trial, whether the people could by any means be restored to
a sound mind. This had, indeed, been in vain attempted for a long time;
but God was yet willing to proceed to the utmost extent in his mercy.
Hence Jeremiah now declares the purpose for which he wished the book to
be read to the people. Nor is there a doubt but that Baruch had been
thus admonished, that he might exhort the people to repentance as it
were from the mouth of Jeremiah.

<span id="viii.vi-p7"></span>Now, there are two things mentioned as
necessary in order to obtain pardon, — prayer, and turning or
conversion. For if any one only in words seeks to be reconciled to God,
he will not succeed. Turning or conversion cannot be separated from
prayer. But then were a sinner to repent a thousand times, he would
still remain exposed to God’s judgment; for reconciliation, by which we
are absolved, does not depend on repentance, but on the gratuitous favor
of God; for God does not receive us into favor because he sees that we
are changed to a better mind, as though conversion were the cause of
pardon; but he embraces us according to his gratuitous mercy. This,
then, is the reason why Jeremiah joins together these two things —
prayer, and conversion or repentance; for as I have said, hypocrites
confess in words their sins and seek pardon, but it is with a feigned or
a double heart. Hence that prayer may be genuine, repentance must be
added, by which men shew that they loathe themselves. And then, ou the
other hand, it is not enough for us to turn or repent, except the sinner
flees to the mercy of God, for pardon flows from that fountain; for God,
as it has been said, does not forgive us for any merit in us, but
because it seemeth him good to bury our sins. The sum of the whole is,
that God would have the prophecies of Jeremiah to be recited before the
whole people, as they were conducive to their safety and salvation. The
manner is described, — that the people were humbly to pray and also
really to repent.

<span id="viii.vi-p8"></span>As to the expression, *It may be, a prayer
will fall,*  <span id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) we have elsewhere
explained its meaning. The Scripture speaks of prayer, that it rises and
that it falls. Both expressions are suitable, though to be understood in
a different way; for prayer cannot be rightly offered except man ascends
and falls. These two things seem contrary, but they well agree together;
nay, they cannot be separated. For in prayer two things are necessary —
faith and humility: by faith we rise up to God, and by humility we lie
prostrate on the ground. This is the reason why Scripture often says
that prayer ascends, for we cannot pray as we ought unless we raise
upwards our minds; and faith, sustained by promises, elevates us above
all the world. Thus then prayer is raised upwards by faith; but by
humility it falls down on the earth; for fear ought to be connected with
faith. And as faith in our hearts produces alacrity by confidence, so
also conscience casts us down and lays us prostrate. We now understand
the meaning of the expression.

<span id="viii.vi-p10"></span>He adds, *Because great is the wrath and
indignation which Jehovah hath pronounced,* or hath spoken, *against
this people.* By wrath and indignation we are to understand God’s
vengeance, the cause being put for the effect. But the Prophet
intimates, that except men are wholly blinded, and as it were estranged
in mind, they ought to be very deeply touched, when God sets before them
some dreadful judgment. When God chastises some slight fault, and when
he does not so very grievously threaten us, we ought to feel alarmed;
but when God shews his wrath to be so kindled that final ruin ought to
be dreaded, we must be stupid indeed, if such a threatening does not
terrify us. Then the Prophet says that there was no hope of relaxation,
for God had pronounced no light or common judgment on the people; but he
shews that he was prepared to destroy the whole nation, as the Jews had
deserved extreme punishment.

<span id="viii.vii"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p1"></span><span id="viii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#008.md)<span id="viii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p2"></span>**8**. And Baruch the son of Neriah did
according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the
book the words of the LORD in the LORD’S house.

<span id="viii.vii-p3"></span>**8**. Et fecit Baruch filius Neriae
secundum omnia quae praeceperat ei Jeremias Propheta, legendo in libro
sermones Jehovae in domo Jehovae.

<span id="viii.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.vii-p5"></span><span id="viii.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p6"></span>Here the promptitude of Baruch is
commended, for he did not disobey God’s Prophet, but willingly undertook
the office deputed to him. His office, as we have said, was not without
danger. As then his message was by no means popular, but on the contrary
very disagreeable, hence is seen the devotedness of Baruch. He made no
refusal, for he knew that this burden was laid on him for some purpose.
Jeremiah then says, that *he did as he had been commanded,* and *read*
in the Temple the *words of Jehovah*  <span
id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) He calls them a little farther on *the
words of Jeremiah,* but the same thing is meant; for as God is, as it
were, represented by his ministers, so he often transfers to them what
belongs peculiarly to himself. (<span id="viii.vii-p9.1"></span>[Rom.
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016.md), [Rom.
16:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025.md)<span id="viii.vii-p9.1"></span>;
<span id="viii.vii-p9.2"></span>[2Ti
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#008)<span id="viii.vii-p9.2"></span>.md)
That is called the doctrine of Jeremiah, which yet, properly speaking,
has no other author but God. So Paul called that Gospel, of which he was
the preacher and witness, his Gospel; and yet he himself had not devised
the Gospel, but had received it from Christ, and faithfully delivered it
as from his hand.

<span id="viii.vii-p10"></span>We ought, therefore, to notice this mode
of speaking, which occurs everywhere in Scripture, — the same thing is
ascribed to God and to his servants. Thus we find what may seem strange,
— the Apostles are said to forgive sins, they are spoken of as bringing
salvation; but the reason is, because they were ministers of God’s
grace, and exhorted men in Christ’s name to be reconciled to God. They
then absolved, because they were the testifiers of absolution. So also
the words which God dictated to his servant were called the words of
Jeremiah; yet, properly speaking, they were not the words of man, for
they did not proceed from a mortal man, but from the only true God. It
follows —

<span id="viii.viii"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.viii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#009.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p2"></span>**9**. And it came to pass in the fifth
year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month,
*that* they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in
Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto
Jerusalem.

<span id="viii.viii-p3"></span>**9**. Et fuit anno quinto Jehoiakim
filii Josiae regis Jehudah, mense nono, indixerunt jejunium coram Jehova
toti populo (qui erat, subaudiendum est) Jerosolymae, et toti populo qui
venerunt ex urbibus Jehudah Jerosolymam:

<span id="viii.viii-p4"></span>**10**. Then read Baruch in the book the
words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah
the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the
new gate of the LORD’S house, in the ears of all the people.

<span id="viii.viii-p5"></span>**10**. Et legit Baruch in libro sermones
Jeremiae in domo Jehovae (hoc est, in Templo) in cubiculo Gamarliae
filii Saphan scribae, in atrio superiori, in introitu (vel, ingressu)
portae novae domus Jehovae (portae novae Templi) in auribus totius
populi.

<span id="viii.viii-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.viii-p7"></span><span id="viii.viii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p8"></span>Here is added a fuller explanation; for
the Prophet relates nothing new, but according to what is common in
Hebrew he expresses at large what he had before briefly stated: for he
had said, that Baruch read in the Temple the words of God as he had been
commanded; but he now relates when and how this was done, even in *the
fifth year of Jehoiakim,* and when a *fast was proclaimed in the ninth
month*  <span id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) We now then see the
design of this repetition, even to point out more clearly the time. He
then says that the book was read and recited when a fast was proclaimed
in the fifth year of Jehoiakim. The Jews, no doubt, knew that some
grievous calamity was at hand, for this proclamation was extraordinary.
And we know that when some calamity was apprehended, they usually betook
themselves to this remedy, not that fasting in itself was pleasing to
God, but because it was a symbol of humiliation, and it also prepared
men for prayer. This custom did not creep in without reason, but God
designed thus to habituate his people to repentance. When, therefore,
God manifested some tokens of his displeasure, the Jews then thought it
necessary, not only to seek forgiveness, but also to add fasting to
their prayers, according to what we find in the second chapter of Joel
as well as in other places. It was then a solemn confession of sin and
guilt; for by fasting they acknowledged themselves to be exposed to
God’s judgment, and also by sackcloth and ashes; for they were wont to
throw aside their fine garments and to put on sackcloth, and also to
scatter ashes on their heads, or to lie on the ground: and these were
the filth as it were of the guilty: and in this state of debasement they
sought pardon of God, thus acknowledging in the first place their own
filthiness by these external symbols, and secondly, confessing before
God and angels that they were worthy of death, and that no hope remained
for them except God forgave them.

<span id="viii.viii-p12"></span>As, then, Jeremiah writes here that
there was a fast proclaimed, there is not the least doubt but that some
tokens of God’s vengeance then appeared. And though Jehoiakim had
provoked the King Nebuchadnezzar by refusing to pay tribute, yet the
idea prevailed always among the Jews that nothing happened except
through the just vengeance of God. As, then, they knew that they had to
do with God, they thought that it behoved them to pacify him.

<span id="viii.viii-p13"></span>He afterwards adds, that a *fast before
Jehovah was proclaimed;* not that it was meritorious, or that an
expiation would thereby be done, as the Papists imagine, who think that
they can redeem their sins by fastings, and hence they call them
satisfactions; but the Prophet says that the fast was proclaimed *before
Jehovah,* as an addition to prayer. As, then, it was a solemn meeting
for prayer, fasting was, as it were, a part added to it, that they might
by this external symbol more fully humble themselves before God, and at
the same time testify their repentance. And he says that it was
proclaimed to *all the people* who were at Jerusalem, and to the other
Jews who came from other cities to the Temple to pray. And we hence
conclude that fasting in itself is of no moment, but that it was an
evidence of repentance, and therefore added to prayer. And Christ,
having mentioned prayer, added fasting, (<span
id="viii.viii-p13.1"></span>[Mt
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#021.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p13.1"></span>) not that fasting ought not to be separated
from daily prayers; for we ought always to pray; but we are not to fast
morning and evening; nay, we pray when our table is prepared for us and
meat are set before us; and then when we dine and sup, we pray to God.
But this is to be understood of more serious prayers, when, as we have
said, God summons us, as it were, before his tribunal, and shews
manifest tokens of his displeasure. And for this reason also, Paul, in
<span id="viii.viii-p13.2"></span>[1Co
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#005.md)<span id="viii.viii-p13.2"></span>,
when bidding husbands to dwell with their wives, adds this,

<span id="viii.viii-p14"></span>“Except it may be for a time”

<span id="viii.viii-p15"></span> — for what purpose? even that they
might give themselves wholly to prayer and fasting. We hence see that
fasting was not an ordinary thing, but when required by some urgent
necessity.

<span id="viii.viii-p16"></span>Then, this also is to be noticed, that
the fast was proclaimed to the other Jews who had come to Jerusalem; for
why was it necessary for them to come to Jerusalem, except humbly to
supplicate God’s favor.

<span id="viii.viii-p17"></span><span id="viii.viii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p18"></span>He says that the *roll was then read in
the Temple, in the chamber of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan the scribe*
The chambers, as we have before said, were annexed to the court of the
priests; for the Levites were the guardians of the Temple; and every
priest also, while performing his duty, remained in the Temple. As to
Shaphan, he is called a scribe, not the king’s chancellor, who is
afterwards called by the same name; for I regard him as being an
actuary. For they called the scribes <span
id="viii.viii-p18.1"></span>ספרים, *sepharim;* but sometimes by this
name are meant the interpreters of the Law, and sometimes the actuaries,
whose office it was to collect the prophecies, or who were engaged in
collecting public acts. Then Gemariah, the son of Shaphan the scribe,
had his chamber in the Temple; and he says, in *the higher court* Hence
we conclude, according to what I have already said, that these chambers
were parts of the court. And he adds, *In the entrance of the new gate
of the Temple* Some think that this was the eastern gate, and that the
greatest concourse of people was usually there. We hence see that Baruch
boldly performed his duty in reading the roll, though the reading of it
must have greatly exasperated the minds of the whole people. It follows,
—

<span id="viii.ix"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p1"></span><span id="viii.ix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:11-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#011.md)<span
id="viii.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p2"></span>**11**. When Michaiah the son of Gemariah,
the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,

<span id="viii.ix-p3"></span>**11**. Et audivit Michas filius Gamariae
filii Saphan onmes sermones Jehovae de super libre (hoc est, ut
recitabantur ex libre)

<span id="viii.ix-p4"></span>**12**. Then he went down into the king’s
house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there,
*even* Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and
Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and
Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.

<span id="viii.ix-p5"></span>**12**. Et descendit in domum regis ad
cubiculum scribae; et ecce illic omnes principes sedentes (hoc est,
sedebant) Elisama scriba, et Dalaiah filius Semaiah, et Elnathan filius
Achobor, et Gamarias filius Saphan, et Zedechias filius Chananiae, et
omnes proceres;

<span id="viii.ix-p6"></span>**13**. Then Michaiah declared unto them
all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears
of the people.

<span id="viii.ix-p7"></span>**13**. Et nuntiavit (indicavit) ipsis
Michas omnes sermones quos audierat cum legeret Baruch in libre (hoc
est, recitaret ex libre) in auribus populi.

<span id="viii.ix-p8"></span> 

<span id="viii.ix-p9"></span><span id="viii.ix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p10"></span>It is not known with what design this
Michaiah came to the princes and the king’s counsellors, he may have
been an informer, who intended to create ill-will to the Prophet, and to
ingratiate himself with the princes, as courtiers usually do. If this
was the case, we may learn from this example, that not all who hear are
so teachable and ready to obey as to make proficiency in the knowledge
of good and holy doctrine: we see that many patiently hear and give some
evidence of docility, and yet cherish perverseness in their hearts, and
afterwards calumniate what they have heard. Such may have been the
character of Michaiah, spoken of here. But his case may have been
different, — that being filled with wonder, he conveyed to the king’s
counsellors what he deemed new and, as it were, incredible. I leave this
without offering an opinion, for we have nothing certain on the subject.

<span id="viii.ix-p11"></span>It is said that he came into *the king’s
palace,* where all the princes sat, and *into the chamber of the scribe*
It is probable that this scribe was the king’s *chancellor,* with whom
were all the princes of the court. Some he names, and then says, that
they were *all there,* and that Michaiah *read* to them the words which
he had heard from the mouth of Baruch when he read to the whole people.

<span id="viii.ix-p12"></span>Now it was not without the wonderful
purpose of God that the king at length came to know what had passed in
the Temple, in order that his perverseness against God might be
detected, as we shall hereafter see. This messenger, indeed, was the
means of bringing danger to Jeremiah as well as to his servant Baruch;
but the Lord protected them. However, the impiety and the obstinacy of
the king were discovered; for when they were all terrified, he despised
God and became enraged against his Prophet. He burnt the book, and
wished also to destroy its author. It now follows, —

<span id="viii.x"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p1"></span><span id="viii.x-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#014.md)<span id="viii.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p2"></span>**14**. Therefore all the princes sent
Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi,
unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read
in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took
the roll in his hand, and came unto them.

<span id="viii.x-p3"></span>**14**. Et miserunt omnes proceres ad
Baruch, Jehudi fillium Nathaniae, filii Selemiae, filii Cussi, dicendo,
Volumen in quo legisti in auribus populi sume in manum tuam, et veni. Et
sumpsit Baruch filius Neriae volumen in manum suam, et yenit ad ipsos.

<span id="viii.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.x-p5"></span><span id="viii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p6"></span>They ought indeed to have gone up
immediately into the Temple; but though they were not wholly
irreligious, yet they shewed some pride, as they commonly do who are
surrounded with splendor, being not disposed to humble themselves. We
see that all courtiers are so inflated with pride, that they think it a
disgrace to mingle with the common people. They wish some special honor
to be reserved for themselves. This was the reason that they did not go
up into the Temple that they might learn the message, but sent for
Baruch to come to them. Now it was this that prevented them from the
heart to repent.

<span id="viii.x-p7"></span>We shall indeed see that they were smitten
with fear, and filled with amazement; and we shall also see that they
brought the matter before the king, and yet wished to provide for the
safety of the Prophet and his servant; but they ought to have gone
farther, even to join the people in the Temple, and make a public
confession of their repentance. Why they did not we have explained:
pride, vanity, and ambition always accompany wealth and power.

<span id="viii.x-p8"></span>Baruch was then sent for, but in an
honorable manner; for they did not send an obscure man; and hence his
genealogy is given, and not only the name of his father is mentioned,
but that of his grandfather and of his great-grand-father; and hence we
conclude that he was a man of some eminence. They commanded him to come,
and it is added, that having taken the roll he *came to them;* by which
he manifested his firmness. His promptitude previously was commendable,
that he ventured to go forth to the Temple and publicly to recite what
tended to kindle the rage of the whole people. As in the beginning, he
promptly undertook the office deputed to him, so now he persevered in
the same course. He came to the princes; and he did not hide the roll,
though he might have been carrying with him his own death, but he boldly
went forth to them, for he knew that the whole business was under the
direction of God. It follows, —

<span id="viii.xi"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p1"></span><span id="viii.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#015.md)<span
id="viii.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p2"></span>**15**. And they said unto him, Sit down
now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read *it* in their ears.

<span id="viii.xi-p3"></span>**15**. Et dixerunt, sede agedum, et lege
ipsum (volumen) in auribus nostris; et legit Baruch in auribus ipsorum.

<span id="viii.xi-p4"></span>**16**. Now it came to pass, when they had
heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto
Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.

<span id="viii.xi-p5"></span>**16**. Et factum est cum audirent cunctos
sermones, expaverunt quisque ad propinquum suum, et dixerunt ipsi
Baruch,Indicando indicabimus Regi omnes hos sermones.

<span id="viii.xi-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xi-p7"></span><span id="viii.xi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p8"></span>We see that there was some regard for
religion in the princes, for they submitted to hear, and respectfully
received the Prophet’s servant. Had Jeremiah himself come, he would, no
doubt, have been received as God’s Prophet, as such honor was given to
his servant, that the princes ordered him to be seated, which was
certainly a favor. It hence appears that they were not profane despisers
of God. Then follows another thing, — that they were moved *with fear*
Then as to the king’s counsellors, we see that they were in such a state
of mind, that they readily listened to, and dreaded the threatenings of
God. But it was a fear that no doubt soon vanished; and what he says,
that *they feared each as to his neighbor,* was a sign of a change; for
he who fears as he ought, thinks of himself, and examines himself before
God; but when the mind wavers, eyery one looks to another. It was then a
sign of repentance not real and genuine, so to fear as to look to one
another, for they ought, each of them, to look to God, that they might
from an inward consciousness acknowledge their sins, and thus flee to
the true remedy.

<span id="viii.xi-p9"></span>It follows, that they *said, Declaring we
shall declare to the king, etc*. We hence learn, that their fear was
such, that they did not yet wish to offend the king. They then referred
the matter to him, being anxious to gratify him. This is the religion of
the court, even so to fear God as not to lose favor, but on the
contrary, so to perform one’s duty, as not to be liable to the charge of
not being sufficiently attentive and devoted to the king’s interest. In
short, the Prophet thus represents to us, as in a glass, the religion of
the king’s counsellors, and shews to us at the same time that their
minds were corrupted by ambition, and that ambition so prevailed, that
they paid more regard to a mortal king than to the only true King of
heaven.

<span id="viii.xii"></span>

<span id="viii.xii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.xii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou art
pleased to invite us daily to thyself, we may respond to thy call in the
spirit of meekness and obedience; and do thou also so seriously impress
our minds, that we may not only confess our sins, but also so loathe
ourselves on account of them, that we may without delay seek the true
remedy, and, relying on thy mercy, may so repent, that thy name may
hereafter be glorified in us, until we shall at length become partakers
of that glory, which thy Son has obtained for us by his own blood. —
Amen.

id="viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p2"></span>**17**. And they asked Baruch, saying,
Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?

<span id="viii.xiv-p3"></span>**17**. Baruch autem interrogarunt,
dicendo, Indica agedum nobis quomodo scripseris cunctos sermones istos
ex ore ejus?

<span id="viii.xiv-p4"></span>**18**. Then Baruch answered them, he
pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote *them*
with ink in the book.

<span id="viii.xiv-p5"></span>**18**. Et dixit illis Baruch, Ex ore suo
pronuntiavit mihi cunctos sermones istos, et ego scripsi super librum
cum atramento.

<span id="viii.xiv-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xiv-p7"></span><span id="viii.xiv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p8"></span>The king’s counsellors were, no doubt, so
astonished when they heard that these threatenings had been written as
the Prophet had dictated them, that they were agitated by different
thoughts, as the unbelieving are wont to be; and not receiving as they
ought to have done, the heavenly doctrine, they vacillated, and could
not pursue a uniform course. Such, then, was the uncertainty that
possessed the minds of the princes; for they could hardly believe that
these words had been delivered by memory, but had suspicion of some
trickery, as the unbelieving imagine many such things respecting God’s
servants; and they seem to act thus designedly, that they may obscure
God’s favor, which appears before their eyes. For this purpose, then,
they are said to *ask Baruch* how he took the *words from the mouth of
Jeremiah*  <span id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md)

<span id="viii.xiv-p10"></span><span id="viii.xiv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p11"></span>He simply answered, that Jeremiah had
*pronounced these words* to him. They might hence have concluded, that
Jeremiah had no roll laid before him, and that he had been not long
meditating on what he communicated to his scribe Baruch. And though he
seems to have said no more than what might satisfy the princes, yet the
purport of the whole is, that Jeremiah did not produce the roll from a
recess or his desk, but promptly gave utterance to what God’s Spirit
suggested to him. Their astonishment, then, must have increased, when
the king’s counsellors knew that these commands did not proceed from a
mortal man, but that, on the contrary, God spoke them by the mouth of
Jeremiah, and by the hand of Baruch. It follows, —

<span id="viii.xv"></span>

<span id="viii.xv-p1"></span><span id="viii.xv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#019.md)<span id="viii.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xv-p2"></span>**19**. Then said the princes unto Baruch,
Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.

<span id="viii.xv-p3"></span>**19**. Et dixerunt principes ipsi Baruch,
Vade et absconde to, tu et Jeremias, et vir nesciat *(hoc est,* nesciat
quisqaam) ubinam sitis.

<span id="viii.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xv-p5"></span><span id="viii.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xv-p6"></span>We see that these courtly princes changed,
when they perceived that it was indeed God’s hand, and yet they remained
in a state of insensibility. God often thus terrifies profane men, and
yet they return to their own indifference. They seemed, indeed, to be
for a moment awakened, and seriously to acknowledge God’s judgment; but
these thoughts presently vanished away. It thus happened, that they
allowed that God had spoken, but it was, as it were, to the deaf, for it
was in vain, as we shall shortly see.

<span id="viii.xv-p7"></span>Then the king’s counsellors derived no
benefit; but they were not cruel, for they wished the Prophet to be
hidden, lest the king should deal severely with him. We see many such
men at this day who are not influenced by divine truth. They nod,
indeed, as asses who move their ears; for they confess with their mouths
that what is propounded to them is true and right; but as I have said,
they either close their eyes, or at least do not attend, so as to know
that it is God who speaks. It appears that such were the king’s
counsellors, of whom the Spirit of God has declared what we shall
presently see. They then counselled Baruch to hide himself, and also
Jeremiah to do the same; for they saw that there was danger to them,
except they took themselves to flight. It afterwards follows, —

<span id="viii.xvi"></span>

<span id="viii.xvi-p1"></span><span id="viii.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#020.md)<span
id="viii.xvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvi-p2"></span>**20**. And they went in to the king into
the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the
scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.

<span id="viii.xvi-p3"></span>**20**. Et venerunt ad regem in atrium, et
volumen deposuerunt in cubiculo Elisamae scribae, et nuntiarunt in
auribus regis omnes sermones.

<span id="viii.xvi-p4"></span>**21**. So the king sent Jehudi to fetch
the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And
Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the
princes which stood beside the king.

<span id="viii.xvi-p5"></span>**21**. Et misit Rex Jehudi ad tollendum
volumen, et accepit ex cubiculo Elisama scribae, et legit illud Jehudi
in auribus regis et in auribus cunctorum principum, qui stabant a
conspectu regis.

<span id="viii.xvi-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xvi-p7"></span><span id="viii.xvi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvi-p8"></span>The Prophet now relates that the princes
went to the king, after having first deposited the roll with Elishama
the scribe; for as the king’s ears were tender, they were unwilling to
perform at once so odious an office. And thus they who are with kings,
and engage their attention, fascinate them with their flatteries; for
there is in courts no independence, for the greatest flatterer is the
highest in favor. As, then, all courtiers seek eagerly to find out how
they may please kings, so they carefully beware lest they should offend
them. This was the reason why the princes deposited the roll with
Elishama. We hence learn that their regard for God was small and frigid;
for if they believed that Jeremiah had dictated to his scribe what he
had received from the Spirit of God, the offending of the king ought not
certainly to have been deemed by them of so much moment. Why, then, did
they not venture immediately to bring forward the roll, and to exhort
the king to hear, except that adulation, as I have said, is always
timid. Hence then it was that they ventured not to shew the roll to the
king, but only told him that they had read some dreadful things, so that
the king did not find fault with them, as they had not too boldly
brought before him what he was unwilling to hear. This, then, is one
thing.

<span id="viii.xvi-p9"></span><span id="viii.xvi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvi-p10"></span>It now follows, that the king *sent
Jehudi to fetch the roll from the chamber of Elishama the scribe* In the
person of Jehoiakim we see how the unbelieving shun and seek God at the
same time, but with a confused mind, as they know not what they seek.
The king might have heedlessly despised what had been related to him,
for if he wished to be free from all trouble, why did he order the roll
to be brought to him, and a part of it to be read? We hence see that the
unbelieving, though they wish to go as far as possible from God, yet run
to him in a sort of blind manner; but this they do not of their own
accord; for God by his secret impulse draws them to himself, so as to
render them more inexcusable. Hence it comes, that curiosity leads many
to hear the truth, and some madly ask, what is the truth to them? like
wild beasts when they run against swords. Such was the disposition of
Jehoiakim, for he wished all the prophecies of Jeremiah to be buried;
and yet he could not restrain himself, but would know the substance or
some part of them. He therefore *sent Jehudi to fetch the roll*

<span id="viii.xvi-p11"></span>It is then added, that *Jehudi read the
roll before the king and before* his counsellors. Hence it was that his
impiety became more evident, as he was not moved by the predictions read
to him. He could not indeed endure the recitation, but after some
chapters had been finished, he became so enraged, as we shall see, that
he threw the roll into the fire and burnt it. It was, however, God’s
purpose to take away from the king as well as from his counsellors every
pretext, that they might not afterwards allege that they had fallen
through ignorance, for after the roll had been presented to them, it was
their own fault if they were not restored to that state of safety from
which they had fallen. He now adds —

<span id="viii.xvii"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#022.md)<span
id="viii.xvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p2"></span>**22**. Now the king sat in the
winterhouse in the ninth month: and *there was a fire* on the hearth
burning before him.

<span id="viii.xvii-p3"></span>**22**. Rex autem sedebat in domo
hyemali, mense nono; et focus coram facie ejus accensus *(vel,* ardebat)

<span id="viii.xvii-p4"></span>**23**. And it came to pass, *that* when
Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and
cast *it* into the fire that *was* on the hearth, until all the roll was
consumed in the fire that *was on* the hearth.

<span id="viii.xvii-p5"></span>**23**. Et factum *est,* cum legisset
Jehudi tres paginas et quatuor (*hoc* *est,* tres vel quatuor) scidit
cultello scribae *(vel,* graphio) et projecit in ignem qui crat in foco,
usque dum consumeret volumen totum super ignem qui erat in foco.

<span id="viii.xvii-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xvii-p7"></span><span id="viii.xvii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p8"></span>Here Jeremiah shews how little he had
effected; for the king not only cast aside but tore the roll into
pieces, and after having torn it, he wished its memory to perish, for he
cast it into the fire. This trial must have grievously affected the mind
of the Prophet; he had dictated that roll by God’s command; he saw now
that all his labor had been in vain. He might then have complained to
God that so much labor had been spent without fruit. For why had God
bidden the roll to be written, except for the purpose of leading the
king and his counsellors to repentance. As to the people, the Prophet
could not know whether it had answered the end for which he sent his
scribe Baruch to them, for no account is given as to the attention paid
by them. But Baruch was led to the king’s palace, so the minds of all
were kept in suspense: what was now the issue? The king burnt the roll.
There is no doubt then but that the mind of the Prophet was much
affected. But God thus exercises his servants when he bids them to speak
to the deaf or to bring light to the blind.

<span id="viii.xvii-p9"></span>Let us then learn simply to obey God,
though the labor he requires from us may seem to be useless. And hence
Paul rises above all the ingratitude of the world and says, that the
ministers of the Gospel are a sweet odor to God, whether for death or
for life, (<span id="viii.xvii-p9.1"></span>[2 Cor.
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016)<span id="viii.xvii-p9.1"></span>.md)
for though the greater part are rendered worse by hearing the Gospel,
yet the obedience rendered to God by ministers is acceptable to him, nor
is the event to be looked to. Jeremiah then saw that the king’s mind was
exasperated, but he did not on that account repent of his obedience, for
he knew that the event was to be left with God and to his will. The duty
of men is to execute whatever God commands, though no fruit may appear
to proceed from their labors. This then is one thing.

<span id="viii.xvii-p10"></span>Now as to the king, we see in him as in
a glass how monstrous is their blindness who are the slaves of Satan.
Surely the king, when God so thundered in his ears, ought to have been
terrified. He could not indeed treat the word with ridicule, but he
became enraged, and acted violently like a rabid wild beast, and vented
his rage against the roll itself! If he thought Jeremiah to have been
the author, why did he not disregard him as a man of no authority in
public affairs? for Jeremiah could not have lessened his character as a
king. There is then no doubt but that he perceived, though unwillingly,
that he had to do with God; why then did he become thus enraged? what
could he hope to gain by such madness towards God? But this, as I have
said, was that dreadful blindness which is found in all the reprobate,
whose minds the devil has fascinated; for on the one hand they perceive,
willing or unwilling, that God is present, and that they are in a manner
summoned to his tribunal; and on the other, as though they were
forgetful of God, they rage madly against him.

<span id="viii.xvii-p11"></span>It is then said of King Jehoiakim, that
while he was in his winter-house and sitting before the fire,  <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) when three or four pages had been
read, he cut the roll with an iron pen, or with the small knife of a
scribe. The word <span id="viii.xvii-p14.2"></span>תער *tor,* means
often a razor, but is to be taken here for the knife used by scribes,
*un canivet.* The king, in the first place, did not wait until Jehudi
finished the roll; after he had heard three or four leaves, or pages, as
we call them, he seized the roll and cut it; and in the second place,
being not content with this sacrilege he burnt the roll, as though he
could abolish God’s judgment together with the book. But we shall
hereafter see what he gained by this intemperate spirit in burning the
roll *until the whole was consumed in the fire* It now follows —

<span id="viii.xviii"></span>

<span id="viii.xviii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#024.md)<span
id="viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xviii-p2"></span>**24**. Yet they were not afraid, nor
rent their garments, *neither* the king, nor any of his servants that
heard all these words.

<span id="viii.xviii-p3"></span>**24**. Et non timuerunt et non
sciderunt vestes suas rex et cuncti servi ejus, cum audissent cunctos
sermones istos.

<span id="viii.xviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xviii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xviii-p6"></span>The Prophet now connects doctrine with
the narrative, for what we have hitherto seen would be frigid were no
instruction added. The Prophet then shews why he had related what we
have read of the king’s impious obstinacy. But there is more force in a
simple statement than if the Prophet in high-sounding words inveighed
against the king and his counsellors; for he speaks here as one
astonished; They *rent not,* he says, their garments, *nor feared* when
they heard threatenings so dreadful. And doubtless it may be justly
deemed as the most monstrous of things, that miserable men should with
such contempt disregard the threatenings of God, which yet they ought to
have dreaded no less than instant destruction. That mortals then should
not be moved when God fulminates by his threatenings against them, but
on the contrary become more hardened — this is an evidence of a
diabolical madness. It is hence not without reason that the Prophet
says, as one astonished, that neither the king nor his counsellors
*feared* nor *rent* their garments.

<span id="viii.xviii-p7"></span>Now, we are taught in this passage that
it is a sign of reprobation when we are not terrified when God threatens
and declares that he will become our judge, and when he brings forward
our sins, and also shews what we deserve. When, therefore, all those
things produce no effect on us, it is a sure sign of hopeless madness.
This is what the Prophet means when he says, *they feared not,* for his
object was to shew that all, as well as himself, ought to stand amazed,
that the king and his counsellors could thus fearlessly withstand the
threatenings of God.

<span id="viii.xviii-p8"></span>As to the *garments,* the sign is put
for the thing itself; and then a statement of a part is made for the
whole: in the first place, to rend the garments is of no great moment,
unless the heart be first rent, as Joel says in the second chapter; but
though hypocrites make a shew of repentance by fallacious signs, yet
when true and sincere repentance is treated of, the sign is put in the
place of the thing signified, as in this passage, they *rent not their
garments,* that is, they manifested no fear. And as the rending of
garments was usually done, he says that they rent not their garments,
when God by the mouth of Jeremiah and by the hand of Baruch fulminated
against them. There is, in the second place, a part stated for the
whole, because they were wont to put on sackcloth, and to sprinkle ashes
on their heads. There is here a mention made only of garments; but other
signs were also included.

<span id="viii.xviii-p9"></span>He says, *When they heard all these
words;* not that the king heard the whole volume, but three or four
chapters were sufficient to condenm him; for there is no doubt but that
he was abundantly convicted, and that he threw himself into such a rage
as to cut the roll and not to rend his garments, because he dreaded
God’s judgment. And there is a striking alliteration in the words <span
id="viii.xviii-p9.1"></span>קרע *koro,* to cut, and <span
id="viii.xviii-p9.2"></span>קרא *kora,* to read, the first ending with
<span id="viii.xviii-p9.3"></span>ע, oin, and the other with <span
id="viii.xviii-p9.4"></span>א, *aleph,.* He had previously said, that
when Jehudah read a part of the roll, the king cut it; the one read and
the other cut; and he says here, that the king did not cut (it is the
same word) or rend his garments. The king had before cut the roll and
torn it in pieces, when, on the contrary, he and the rest ought to have
cut or torn their garments, and were it lawful, even themselves, when
God terrified them with such dreadful threatenings. It follows —

<span id="viii.xix"></span>

<span id="viii.xix-p1"></span><span id="viii.xix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#025.md)<span id="viii.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xix-p2"></span>**25**. Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah
and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn
the roll: but he would not hear them.

<span id="viii.xix-p3"></span>**25**. Quinetiam Elnathan et Dalaia et
Gainaria, intercesserunt regi *(vel,* prohibuerunt regem, *vel*
rogarunt; *ham* ענפ *omnia hcec significat, occurrere, vel deprecari,
vel prohibere, et se interponere;* illi *ergo conati sunt regi
occurrere)* ne combureret volumen, et non audivit ipsos.

<span id="viii.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xix-p5"></span><span id="viii.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xix-p6"></span>The Prophet aggravates the wickedness of
the king by this circumstance, that three men opposed him, though they
thereby subjected themselves to great danger. They saw that the king was
carried away by the violence of his temper; and when he resisted God in
a manner so insolent, what would he not have dared to do to them? That
they notwithstanding hesitated not to intercede with him, was an
instance of great courage. But it hence appears, that as the king did
not attend to their counsel, his impiety was extreme.

<span id="viii.xix-p7"></span>The particle <span
id="viii.xix-p7.1"></span>וגם *ugam*, is to be rendered *nevertheless*
Many interpreters have not attended here to what is emphatical, and have
therefore perverted the meaning of the Prophet, or at least have
extenuated it so as not to represent faithfully the object of the
Prophet; for there is, as I have said, a very emphatic exaggeration in
the word *Nevertheless* And let us learn from this passage, that when
God draws us back from wicked designs, we are less excusable if we
persevere in executing what he clearly shews ought not to be done.
Conscience will indeed always be to us in the place of thousand
witnesses; and though no one be present as a witness or an adviser or a
monitor, yet we shall in vain try to escape before God by pretending
ignorance or mistake or want of thought: but when the Lord by the
instrumentality of men calls us back, so that we may not go on in evil
ways, if we are not persuaded to desist, then discovered more fully is
our incorrigible perverseness, according to what the Prophet intimates
here. In short, let us know that any one sins the more grievously, the
more means God employs to draw him back from his evil course.

<span id="viii.xix-p8"></span>Since, then, we see how obstinate
Jehoiakim was, there is no reason for us to wonder, that many at this
day go on presumptuously in their course, though God as it were checks
them, or at least sends men to restrain them. Let us, then, know that it
is an old evil, so that we may not be disturbed by such a presumptuous
contempt of the ungodly.

<span id="viii.xix-p9"></span>Let us also notice the example given here
of a bold admonition: for it is something like a miracle to find those
at this day in the courts of princes, who are bold enough to remonstrate
when there is much danger; for, as it has been before stated, every one
is ingenious in devising means to flatter; and as this is the best and
shortest way to elevation, all apply themselves assiduously to this art.
The Prophet had indeed said that the king and his counsellors did not
rend their garments, and yet he tells us now of three who openly
professed that they feared God: but when he spoke before of all the
princes, we must understand him as speaking of them as a body. Then the
three, mentioned now, must be excepted; nor is there a doubt but that
they incurred the displeasure of all the courtiers, as they had them
opposed to them, since they must have been ashamed of their own
negligence; but they dared to draw on themselves the displeasure both of
the king and of all the rest, for they saw that it was God’s cause. It
follows —

<span id="viii.xx"></span>

<span id="viii.xx-p1"></span><span id="viii.xx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#026.md)<span id="viii.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xx-p2"></span>**26**. But the king commanded Jerahmeel
the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the
son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe, and Jeremiah the prophet: but
the LORD hid them.

<span id="viii.xx-p3"></span>**26**. Et praecepit rex Jerameel filio
Hamelek *(vel,* regis, *sed existimant esse nomen proprium, et est
probabile)* et Seraiae filio Abdeel, et Selemiae filio Abdeel, ut
acciperent Baruch seribam et Jeremiam Prophetam; sed abscondit eos
Jehova.

<span id="viii.xx-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xx-p5"></span><span id="viii.xx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xx-p6"></span>Here is described the madness of the king,
which was so great, that he vented his rage against the Prophet and his
scribe; and he chose no doubt those whom he thought to be most ready to
obey him. He would have never taken such ministers as Elnathan or
Delaiah or Gemariah, for he knew how much they abhorred such a nefarious
deed; but he sent those whom he thought most adapted for such a service
as that of killing Jeremiah and Baruch.

<span id="viii.xx-p7"></span>It is not improperly conjectured from this
passage and a previous one, that Jeremiah was not detained in prison,
but that he had been restrained by God from proclaiming his prophecies
to the king and from reading thmn to the people. But as the word <span
id="viii.xx-p7.1"></span>עצור, *otsur,* is taken elsewhere for a captive
or one bound, we may indeed draw a different conclusion. However, I will
not contend on such a point. I have already explained what I most
approve, — that Jeremiah was prohibited by a secret revelation, as Paul
was forbidden to go to Bithynia. (<span id="viii.xx-p7.2"></span>[Ac
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#007)<span id="viii.xx-p7.2"></span>.md)
It is certainly not probable that he could escape from the king’s
prison, except it be said, that he was not so confined but that he
thought himself free to escape when he saw that it was God’s will, or
that though Jeremiah would not have departed from prison, he yet
privately escaped from the present rage of the king, because he was
forced.

<span id="viii.xx-p8"></span>However this may have been, we ought to
notice the words, that God *hid them* Jeremiah no doubt accepted the
counsel given to him, to take care of his life; he however now
acknowledges that he had been preserved by God’s kindness, as though he
had said, that though there may be many ways by which we may escape from
our present dangers, yet our life is in God’s hand, so that he hides and
conceals us; for we ourselves would run headlong unto death, were we not
covered by the shadow of his hand. But the rest to-morrow.

<span id="viii.xxi"></span>

<span id="viii.xxi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.xxi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou dost
daily invite us kindly to thyself, and dost also terrify us in order to
correct our tardiness and sloth, — O grant, that we may not obstinately
resist thee and thy word, but be so allured by thy condescension and
subdued by thy threatenings, that in real fear we may flee to thy mercy,
and never hope for any other remedy, except we obtain salvation through
being reconciled to thee, and that we may so seek thee in true penitence
and by true faith, that thou mayest come to our aid, and be propitious
to us through thine only-begotten Son our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="viii.xxii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and forty-Fourth

<span id="viii.xxiii"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:27-28](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#027.md)<span
id="viii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiii-p2"></span>**27**. Then the word of the LORD came
to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words
which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,

<span id="viii.xxiii-p3"></span>**27**. Et fuit sermo Jehovae ad
Jeremiam postquam combusserat rex librum et sermones quos scripserat
Baruch ex ore Jeremiae, dicendo,

<span id="viii.xxiii-p4"></span>**28**. Take thee again another roll,
and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which
Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p5"></span>**28**. Conversus accipe tibi volumen
aliud, et scribe in ipso cunctos sermones prioris, qui fuerunt in
volumine priori, et quod combussit Joiakim rex Jehudah.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxiii-p7"></span><span id="viii.xxiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiii-p8"></span>By these words the Prophet shews what
the ungodly gain by contending against God; for however hard and
refractory, they must necessarily be broken down by God’s power. This
happened to King Jehoiakim. We saw in yesterday’s Lecture how furious he
was when he cut and burned the volume, and also ordered the Prophet to
be slain. But it now follows, that *another volume* was written.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p9"></span>Now God deals in different ways with the
rebellious. For at one time he passes by or leaves timre, when he sees
that he spends in vain his labor in admonishing them. He then sends no
more his Prophets to reprove or threaten, but silently executes his
judgments. And for this reason it is said,

<span id="viii.xxiii-p10"></span>“My Spirit shall no more contend with
man, because he is flesh.” (<span id="viii.xxiii-p10.1"></span>[Ge
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003.md)<span
id="viii.xxiii-p10.1"></span>)

<span id="viii.xxiii-p11"></span>And similar examples everywhere occur,
that is, that when God saw that the prophetic doctrine was despised, he
raised his hand against the ungodly, and at the same time ceased to
speak to them. But here he purposed in a different way to break down the
violence of Jehoiakim, for he caused *another volume* to be *written* He
foolishly thought that God’s power was in a manner cut off, or
extinguished by fire, because the book was reduced to ashes. But God
shews that his word cannot be bound or restrained. Then he begins anew
to threaten, not because he hoped for any benefit from this repetition,
but because it was necessary to expose to ridicule the madness of the
king, who had so presumptuously dared to despise both God and his holy
Prophet.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p12"></span>The first thing then is, that the
Prophet was bidden to *write another* roll, after the King Jehoiakim
vented his rage against the roll read before him; and hence he carefully
repeats the words, *Take to thee another roll, and write in it the same
words which were in the first book;* as though he had said, “Let not a
syllable be omitted, but let that which I once proclaimed by thy mouth,
remain unchanged; and let thus all the ungodly know that thou hast
faithfully delivered what thou didst receive from my mouth.” It follows
—

<span id="viii.xxiv"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:29-30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#029.md)<span
id="viii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiv-p2"></span>**29**. And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim
king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying,
Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall
certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from
thence man and beast?

<span id="viii.xxiv-p3"></span>**29**. Et ad Joiakim regem Jehudah
dices, Sic dicit Jehova, Tu combussisti librum hunc, dicendo, Quare
scripsisti in ipso, dicendo, Veniendo veniet rex Babel (Babylonis) et
perdet ex ea hominem et animal *(vel,* bestiam?)

<span id="viii.xxiv-p4"></span>**30**. Therefore thus saith the LORD of
Jehoiakim king of Judah, He shall have none to sit upon the throne of
David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and
in the night to the frost.

<span id="viii.xxiv-p5"></span>**30**. Propterea sic dixit Jehova ad
Joiakim *(vel,* de Joiakim) regent Jehudah, Non erit ei qui succedat
super solium Davidis, et cadaver ejus projectum erit in aestum per diem
et in gelu per noctem.

<span id="viii.xxiv-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxiv-p7"></span><span id="viii.xxiv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiv-p8"></span>We now see what reward Jehoiakim brought
on himself, by his impiety and perverseness. But there are two clauses;
in the first, God reproves him for having insolently dared to impose
silence on the Prophet; and in the second, he adds a punishment.

<span id="viii.xxiv-p9"></span>*Thou shalt say to Jeholakim* We are to
take <span id="viii.xxiv-p9.1"></span>על *ol,* here for <span
id="viii.xxiv-p9.2"></span>אל, *al,* as it appears from the context; it
indeed properly means *concerning,* or *upon,* as in the next verse, God
thus speaks *of Jehoiakim.* But as the Prophet is here bidden in the
second person to address him, the other meaning, *to,* is better, even
that he was bidden to address the king, and to address him by name: Then
it is, “Thou shalt speak *to* Jehoiakim, the king of Judah.” The word
king, is mentioned not so much for honor’s sake, as to shew that he in
vain gloried in honor, or in a title of dignity; for as we have
elsewhere seen, the Prophet had been sent to reprove mountains and
hills, and not to spare kings or kingdoms. (<span
id="viii.xxiv-p9.3"></span>[Mic
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.xxiv-p9.3"></span>;
<span id="viii.xxiv-p9.4"></span>[Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010)<span id="viii.xxiv-p9.4"></span>.md)
It had then been said to him,

<span id="viii.xxiv-p10"></span>“I have set thee over nations and
kingdoms.”

<span id="viii.xxiv-p11"></span>As then Jehoiakim could not be so filled
with pride as to think that everything was lawful to him, God intimates
that there was no reason that royal splendor should dazzle his mind and
his senses, for he made no account of such masks, and that no elevation
in the world could intercept the course of prophetic truth. In a word,
Jeremiah is here encouraged to persevere, lest the high position of the
king should terrify him, or enervate his mind, so as not to declare
faithfully the commands of God.

<span id="viii.xxiv-p12"></span>A twofold admonition may be hence
gathered. The first belongs to kings, and to those who are great in
wealth or power on the earth; they are warned to submit reverently to
God’s word, and not to think themselves exempted from what is common to
all, or absolved, on account of their dignity, for God has no respect of
persons. The other admonition belongs to teachers, and that is, that
they are, with closed eyes, to do whatever God commands them, without
shewing any respect of persons; and thus they are to fear no offenses,
nor even the name of a king, nor a drawn sword, nor any dangers.

<span id="viii.xxiv-p13"></span>The crime is in the first place
mentioned, *Thou hast burnt the book, saying, Why hast thou written in
it, By coming come shall the king of Babylon, and shall destroy this
city* Here God shews what especially was the reason why Jehoiakim cast
the book into the fire, even because he could not endure the free
reproofs and the threatenings contained in it. When God spares
hypocrites, or does not touch their vices, they can bear prophetic
teaching; but when the sore is touched, immediately they become angry;
and this was the continual contest which God’s Prophets had with the
ungodly: for if they had flattered them and spoken smooth words to them,
if they had always promised something joyful and prosperous to the
ungodly, they would have been received with great favor and applause;
but the word of God was unpleasant and bitter; and it exasperated their
minds when they heard that God was displeased and angry with them.

<span id="viii.xxiv-p14"></span>This passage then ought to be carefully
noticed; for the Spirit of God points out, as by the finger, the
fountain of all contumacy, even because hypocrites wish to agree or to
make a covenant with God, that he should not deal severely with them,
and that his Prophets should only speak smoothly. But it is necessary
that God’s word should correspond with the nature of its author. For, as
God knows the heart, he penetrates into the inmost recesses; and so also
his word is a two-edged sword, and thus it pierces men even to the very
marrow, and discerns between the thoughts and the affections, as the
Apostle teaches us. (<span id="viii.xxiv-p14.1"></span>[Heb
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#012.md)<span
id="viii.xxiv-p14.1"></span>) Hence it is, that hypocrites become mad,
when God summons them to judgment. When any one handles gently a man
full of ulcers, there is no sign of uneasiness given; but when a surgeon
presses the ulcers, then he becomes irritated, and then also comes out
what was before hidden. Similar is the case with hypocrites; for as it
has been said, they do not clamor against God, nor even make any
complaints, when the simple truth is declared; but when they are urged
with reproofs and with threatenings, then their rage is kindled, then
they manifest in every way their virulence. And this is set forth here,
when the Prophet says, that the book was *burnt,* because it was
*written in it* that the king of Babylon would *come to destroy* or lay
waste the *land,* and to remove from it both *man and beast*

<span id="viii.xxiv-p15"></span>So we see that the prophecy of Micah
exasperated all the Jews, when he said that Jerusalem would be reduced
into heaps of stones. (<span id="viii.xxiv-p15.1"></span>[Mic
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#012.md)<span
id="viii.xxiv-p15.1"></span>)

<span id="viii.xxiv-p16"></span><span id="viii.xxiv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiv-p17"></span>But the Prophet immediately shows that
the ungodly in vain resist God, when they kick against the goad; they
must necessarily be torn in pieces by the stone with which they contend,
because their hardness cannot hinder God from executing his judgments.
It is therefore added, *Thus saith Jehovah of the king Jehoiakim, Be
shall have no one to succeed him on the throne of David* By saying, that
he should have no successor, he means that he should have none of his
own posterity; for though his son Jeconiah was made king in his stead,
yet as he reigned only for three months, this short time was not
counted. Then Jeremiah declares, by God’s cmnmand, that King Jehoiakim
should not have a legitimate successor, for his son Jeconiah was led
into exile at the end of three months; and Zedekiah was not counted as a
legitimate successor, because he was the uncle. And there is also no
doubt but that Nebuchadnezzar, from ill-will and hatred, set him on the
throne, for he thus raised him in order to degrade Jehoiakim and
Jeconiah.

<span id="viii.xxiv-p18"></span>We now then perceive in what sense God
threatened that there would be none to succeed King Jehoiakim; for it is
not simply said, “There shall be none to sit on the throne of David;”
but, “There shall be none to him,” <span id="viii.xxiv-p18.1"></span>לא
יהיה לו *la* *ieie lu,* that is, “There shall be none of his children,
or of his offspring, to succeed him on the throne of David.” For the
last king was Zedekiah, and he, as I have said, was the uncle; so that
the whole royal seed were cast off, for no one after this time ever
succeeded to the throne.

<span id="viii.xxiv-p19"></span>But it may be asked, How can this
prophecy agree with the promise, that the posterity of David should
continue as long as the sun and moon shone as faithful witnesses in the
heavens? (<span id="viii.xxiv-p19.1"></span>[Ps.
89:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#037.md),
[38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038)<span id="viii.xxiv-p19.1"></span>.md)
God had promised that the kingdom of David should be perpetual, and that
there would be some of his posterity to rule as long as the sun and moon
shone in the heavens; but what does our Prophet mean now, when he says,
that there shall not be a successor? This is, indeed, to be confined to
the posterity of Jehoiakim; but yet we must bear in mind what we have
seen elsewhere, and that is, that he speaks here of an interruption,
which is not inconsistent with perpetuity; for the perpetuity of the
kingdom, promised to David, was such, that it was to fall and to be
trodden under foot for a time, but that at length a stem from Jesse’s
root would rise, and that Christ, the only true and eternal David, would
so reign, that his kingdom should have no end. When, therefore, the
Prophets say, that there would be none to sit on David’s throne, they do
not mean this strictly, but they thus refer only to that temporary
punishment by which the throne was so overturned, that God at length
would, in his own time, restore it, according to what Amos says,

<span id="viii.xxiv-p20"></span>“For come shall the time when God shall
raise up the fallen tabernacle of David.”

<span id="viii.xxiv-p21"></span>We now perceive in what sense hath stood
firm the promise respecting the perpetuity of the kingdom, and that the
kingdom had yet ceased for a time, that is, until Christ came, on whose
head was placed the diadem, or the royal crown, as Ezekiel says. (<span
id="viii.xxiv-p21.1"></span>[Eze
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026.md)<span
id="viii.xxiv-p21.1"></span>) There is yet no doubt but this great
inconsistency was made an objection to Jeremiah:

<span id="viii.xxiv-p22"></span>“What! can it be that the throne of
David should be without a legitimate heir? Canst thou draw down the sun
and moon from the heavens?”

<span id="viii.xxiv-p23"></span>In like manner, when the Prophets spoke
of the destruction of Jerusalem, they said:

<span id="viii.xxiv-p24"></span>“What! Is it not said, ‘This is my rest
for ever, here will I dwell?’ (<span id="viii.xxiv-p24.1"></span>[Ps
83:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#014.md)<span
id="viii.xxiv-p24.1"></span>)

<span id="viii.xxiv-p25"></span>Can it be that God will be without his
habitation on earth, especially when he calls it his rest?” But the
answer to all this was not difficult, even that God remained faithful to
his promises, though his favor was, for a time, as it were, under a
cloud, so that the dreadful desolation both of the city and of the
kingdom might be an example to all.

<span id="viii.xxiv-p26"></span>There is no doubt, then, but that they
shewed to the Prophet that the kingdom would be hid, as though it were a
treasure concealed in the earth, and that still the time would come when
God would again choose both the city and the kingdom, and restore them
to their pristine dignity, as the Papists say, who boast in high terms
of everything said in Scripture respecting the perpetual preservation of
the Church:

<span id="viii.xxiv-p27"></span>“Christ promises to be with his people
to the end of the world, that he will be where two or three meet
together in his name, that the Church is the pillar and ground of the
truth.”  
(<span id="viii.xxiv-p27.2"></span>[Mt
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020.md)<span
id="viii.xxiv-p27.2"></span>; <span id="viii.xxiv-p27.3"></span>[1Ti
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md)<span
id="viii.xxiv-p27.3"></span>)

<span id="viii.xxiv-p28"></span>They heap together all these things, in
order to shew that God is in a manner tied and bound to them. But we can
easily dissipate these frivolous objections; for God does wonderfully
and invisibly preserve his Church in the world; and then the outward
face of the Church does not always appear, but it is sometimes hid, and
afterwards it emerges and recovers its own dignity, which, for a time,
might seem to have been extinguished. Hence we give now the same answer
to the Papists as the Prophets formerly did to the ancient people, —
that God is a faithful preserver of his Church, but not according to the
perception of the flesh, for the Church is in a wonderful manner
sustained by God, and not in a common way, or as they say, according to
the usual order of things.

<span id="viii.xxiv-p29"></span>He says that the *dead body of Jehoiakim
would be cast out, to* be exposed to *the cold in the night,* and *to
the heat in the day* This might seem unimportant, like what we threaten
children with, when we mention some phantoms to them; for what harm
could it have been to Jehoiakim to have his dead body exposed to the
cold in the night? for no injury or feeling of sorrow can happen to a
dead body, as a dead man as to his body can have no feeling. It seems
then that it is to little purpose that the Prophet says, that his dead
body would be exposed to the heat in the day, and to the cold at night.
But this is to be referred to the common law of nature, of which we have
spoken elsewhere; for it is a sad and disgraceful thing, nay, a horrid
spectacle, when we see men unburied; and the duty of burying the dead
has from the beginning been acknowledged, and burial is an evidence of a
future resurrection, as it has been before stated. When, therefore, the
body of man lies unburied, all men shun and dread the sight; and then
when the body gets rigid through cold, and becomes putrid through the
heat of the day, the indignity becomes still greater. God then intended
to set forth the degradation that awaited Jehoiakim, not that any hurt
could be done to him when his body was cast out, and not honored with a
burial, but that it would be an evidence of God’s vengeance, when a king
was thus cast out as an ass or a dog, according to what we have seen
elsewhere, “With the burial of an ass shall he be buried,” that is, he
will be deemed unworthy of common honor; for as it falls to the lot of
the lowest of men to find a pit where their bodies lie buried, it was a
rare and unusual proof of God’s vengeance, that a king should he exposed
as a prey to birds and wild beasts. We know what Jehu said of Jezebel,

<span id="viii.xxiv-p30"></span>“Let her be buried, for she is a king’s
daughter.”  
(<span id="viii.xxiv-p30.2"></span>[2Ki
9:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#034.md)<span
id="viii.xxiv-p30.2"></span>)

<span id="viii.xxiv-p31"></span>She was worthy to be torn to pieces a
hundred times. She had been cast out from a chamber, and the dogs licked
her blood; yet an enemy ordered her to be buried — and why? because she
was a king’s daughter, or descended from a royal family, (<span
id="viii.xxiv-p31.1"></span>[1Ki
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#023.md)<span
id="viii.xxiv-p31.1"></span>:) then, he said, let her be buried.

<span id="viii.xxiv-p32"></span>We now then understand the meaning of
the Prophet, or rather of the Holy Spirit, that it would be a remarkable
proof of God’s vengeance, when the body of King Jehoialdm should be
exposed at night to the cold, and in the day to the heat. This has also
happened sometimes to the saints, as we have before said; but it was a
temporal punishment common to the good and to the bad. We ought yet
always to consider it as God’s judgment. When a godly man is left
without burial, we must know that all things happen for good to God’s
children, according to what Paul says, whether it be life or death, it
is for their salvation. (<span id="viii.xxiv-p32.1"></span>[Ro
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028.md)<span
id="viii.xxiv-p32.1"></span>) But when God gives a remarkable proof of
his wrath against an ungodly man, our eyes ought to be opened; for it is
not right to be blind to the manifest judgments of God; for it is not in
vain that Paul reminds us that God’s judgment will come on the ungodly;
but he would have us carefully to consider how God punishes the
reprobate in life and in death and even after death. It follows —

<span id="viii.xxv"></span>

<span id="viii.xxv-p1"></span><span id="viii.xxv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#031.md)<span id="viii.xxv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxv-p2"></span>**31**. And I will punish him and his seed
and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and
upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the
evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.

<span id="viii.xxv-p3"></span>**31**. Et visitabo super eum et super
semen ejus, et super servos ejus iniquitatem eormn, et evenire faciam
illis (super eos, *ad verbum)* et super habitatores Jerusalem, et super
virum Jehudab omne malum quod pronuntiavi adversus cos, et non a
udierunt.

<span id="viii.xxv-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxv-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxv-p6"></span>Here a reason is given for what the former
verse contains; for if the Prophet had only said, that the dead body of
the king would remain unburied and cast out in dishonor to be exposed in
the night to the cold and in the day to the heat, the narrative would
not have produced the effect intended; but God shews here the cause,
which was this, that he had forewarned King Jehoiakim and all his
counsellors, (called here servants) and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and all the Jews universally: as then they had been in due time clearly
told what calamity was near at hand, and yet no one had repented, for
this so great an obstinacy God says now that he would take vengeance, *I
will visit him and his seed and the whole people for their iniquity* —
what was the iniquity? even that they had so grievously and in so many
ways provoked God, and had not returned to a sound mind, though reproved
by the Prophet, but had become more and more hardened.

<span id="viii.xxv-p7"></span>The extremity of their iniquity the
Prophet thus points out, because they *hearkened not* to the
threatenings, by which God had endeavored to rescue them from the coming
ruin: for there would have been some hope of deliverance, had they
deprecated God’s wrath; but as his threatenings had been despised, it
was, as I have said, an extreme iniquity. And we see elsewhere how much
God abominates this diabolical presumption of men,

<span id="viii.xxv-p8"></span>“I have called to sackcloth and ashes; but
ye have called to the harp and to joy, and have said, ‘Let us feast and
drink, for to-morrow we shall die:’ as I live, this iniquity shall not
be blotted out.”  
(<span id="viii.xxv-p8.2"></span>[Isa.
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013)<span id="viii.xxv-p8.2"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.xxv-p9"></span>God swore by himself, that this sin should
not be expiated, for the Jews repented not when he kindly invited them
to himself, and declared to them that they could not escape extreme
punishment. It is therefore no wonder that God in this place also
represents their obstinate wickedness as being the greatest, the Jews
having *not hearkened to* the reproofs conveyed to them by the mouth of
Jeremiah. It follows —

<span id="viii.xxvi"></span>

<span id="viii.xxvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
36:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#032.md)<span id="viii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxvi-p2"></span>**32**. Then took Jeremiah another roll,
and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein
from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim
king of Judah had burnt in the fire: and there were added besides unto
them many like words.

<span id="viii.xxvi-p3"></span>**32**. Et (tunc) Jeremias scripsit
volumen aliud, et dedit Baruch filio Neriae, qui scripsit in ipso ex ore
Jeremiae cunctos sermones libri, quem combusserat Joiakim rex Jehudah
igne, et adhuc additi sunt cum illis sermones multi similes illis.

<span id="viii.xxvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxvi-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxvi-p6"></span>Here the Prophet tells us that he
faithfully obeyed God in writing another volume; and his constancy in
this affair deserves no common praise; for he had lately fled in fear,
he knew that the king was his enemy, as he had already ordered him and
Baruch to be slain. As then he knew that the king burned with so much
rage and hatred, how came he to be so bold as to exasperate him still
more? But we see that the Prophets were not exempt from the influence of
fear, and were often anxious about their own safety; and yet they ever
preferred the duty imposed on them by God to their own life. The
Prophet, no doubt, trembled, but as he felt bound to obey God’s command,
he disregarded his own life, when he had to make the choice, whether to
refuse the burden laid on him, or to provide for his own safety. Thus
then he offered his own life as a sacrifice, though he was not free from
fear and other infirmities. This is one thing.

<span id="viii.xxvi-p7"></span>But Baruch, I doubt not, again proclaimed
these words; how was it then that the king abstained from cruelty? Had
his madness been by any means mitigated? It is certain that he did not
become changed, and that he did not through kindness spare God’s
servants; but God restrained his cruelty; for when it is not his will to
soften the hearts of the ungodly, he yet bridles their violence, so that
they either dare not, or cannot find the way, to execute with their
hands what they have intended in their minds, however much they may
strive to do so. I therefore consider that the King Jehoiakim was
restrained by the hidden power of God, so that he could not do any harm
to Jeremiah and his scribe Baruch; and that in the meantime the
magnanimity of the Prophet and also of his scribe remained invincible;
for it was God’s will to fight as it were hand to hand, with this
impious king, until he was ignominiously cast from his throne, which
happened, as we shall see, soon after.

<span id="viii.xxvii"></span>

<span id="viii.xxvii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.xxvii-p2"></span>Grant, Omnipotent God, that since thou
warnest us by so remarkable examples, that the ungodly by obstinately
resisting thee, do nothing but aggravate their own ruin, — O grant, that
we may receive with meek hearts the admonitions of thy Prophets, and
submit to thee, and be so humbled by thy threatenings and tremble at thy
word, that being touched with the feeling of true repentance, and
reconciled to thee by faith, we may find thee to be the best and the
kindest Father to obedient children, until we shall at length enjoy that
eternal inheritance which has been obtained for us by the blood of thine
only-begotten Son. — Amen.

id="viii.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p12"></span> Blaney’s suggestion is not improbable,
that the Prophet, having been before tried before the princes, (<span
id="viii.iii-p12.1"></span>[Jeremiah
26](../../../bib/kjv/jer026.htm#000)<span id="viii.iii-p12.1"></span>.md)
was put under some restraint, probably forbidden to enter the precincts
of the Temple. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[102](cc20007.htm#fr_101.md) <span
id="viii.vi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p9"></span> So the verb is rendered in the *Sept.* and
*Vulg.;* but “accepted” by the *Syr.* and *Targ.* Our version is a
paraphrase; to convey fully the meaning the word “humbly” ought to have
been introduced,” It may be, they will humbly present their
supplication,” etc. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_102"></span>[103](cc20007.htm#fr_102.md) <span
id="viii.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p7"></span> I render this verse as follows, —

<span id="viii.vii-p8"></span>**8.** And Baruch, the son of Neriah, did
according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, in order to
read in the book the words of Jehovah in the house of Jehovah.

<span id="viii.vii-p9"></span>What Jeremiah had commanded Baruch was to
take a roll and to write the words from his mouth: this Baruch did, and
for this purpose, that he might read the words (as the *Targum* has it)
in the Lord’s house. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_103"></span>[104](cc20007.htm#fr_103.md) <span
id="viii.viii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p9"></span> The latter part of the verse is
differently rendered in the *Sept., Syr.,* and the *Targ.,* and more
consistently with the Hebrew, —

<span id="viii.viii-p10"></span>— proclaim a fast before Jehovah did all
the people in Jerusalem, and all the people that came from the cities
into Jerusalem.

<span id="viii.viii-p11"></span>It was a fast that the people
proclaimed, and not the king, who was a very ungodly one. His conduct on
this occasion proved his great impiety. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_104"></span>[105](cc20007.htm#fr_104.md) <span
id="viii.xiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p9"></span> Some have made two questions here, — “How
didst thou write all these words? from his mouth?” The answer seems to
favor this construction; as usual in Scripture, the last question is
answered first, and then the first: Baruch said, “From his mouth he
pronounced to me all these words;” and then he adds, answering the first
question, “and I wrote on the book with ink.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[106](cc20007.htm#fr_105.md) <span
id="viii.xvii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p12"></span> There were no chimneys, and therefore
no “hearths” in the East. The word rendered “hearth” here means properly
a brasier, and <span id="viii.xvii-p12.1"></span>את before it is a
preposition. The verse may be thus rendered, —

<span id="viii.xvii-p13"></span>And the king was sitting in the
winter-house, in the ninth month, and at the brasier burning (or, which
was burning) before him.

<span id="viii.xvii-p14"></span>It is “a small altar, <span
id="viii.xvii-p14.1"></span>arula,” in the *Vulg.;* “fire” in the *Syr.*
and *Targ.;* but “hearth” in the *Sept.* — *Ed.*
