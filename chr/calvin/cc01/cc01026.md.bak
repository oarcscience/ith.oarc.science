<span id="xxvii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 21.

<span id="xxvii.i"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p1"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
21:1-34](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#001.md)<span id="xxvii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p2"></span>**1.** *And* the LORD visited Sarah as he
had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.

<span id="xxvii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Porro Jehova visitavit Sarah,
quemadmodum dixit: et fecit Jehova ipsi Sarah, quemadmodum loquutus
erat.

<span id="xxvii.i-p4"></span>**2.** For Sarah conceived, and bare
Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to
him.

<span id="xxvii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Itaque concepit et peperit Sarah
ipsi Abraham filium in senectute ejus, in tempore quod illi dixerat
Deus.

<span id="xxvii.i-p6"></span>**3.** And Abraham called the name of his
son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

<span id="xxvii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et vocavit Abraham nomen filii sui,
qui natus erat ei, quem peperit ei Sarah, Ishac.

<span id="xxvii.i-p8"></span>**4.** And Abraham circumcised his son
Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.

<span id="xxvii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et circumcidit Abraham Ishac filium
suum, filium octo dierum, quemadmodum praeceperat ei Deus.

<span id="xxvii.i-p10"></span>**5.** And Abraham was an hundred years
old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.

<span id="xxvii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Abraham autem erat centum annorum,
quando natus est ei Ishac filius suus.

<span id="xxvii.i-p12"></span>**6.** And Sarah said, God hath made me to
laugh, *so that* all that hear will laugh with me.

<span id="xxvii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et dixit Sarah, Risum fecit mihi
Deus: omnis qui audierit, ridebit mihi.

<span id="xxvii.i-p14"></span>**7.** And she said, Who would have said
unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have
born *him* a son in his old age.

<span id="xxvii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Et dixit, Quis nuntiasset Abrahae
lactare filios Sarah? quia peperi filium in senectute ejus.

<span id="xxvii.i-p16"></span>**8.** And the child grew, and was weaned:
and Abraham made a great feast the *same* day that Isaac was weaned.

<span id="xxvii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et crevit puer, et ablactatus est:
et fecit Abraham convivium magnum in die qua ablactatus est Ishac.

<span id="xxvii.i-p18"></span>**9.** And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the
Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.

<span id="xxvii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Et vidit Sarah filium Hagar
Aegyptiae, quem peperit ipsi Abraham, ridentem.

<span id="xxvii.i-p20"></span>**10.** Wherefore she said unto Abraham,
Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall
not be heir with my son, *even* with Isaac.

<span id="xxvii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Et dixit ad Abraham, Ejice
ancillam hanc et filium ejus: quia non haereditabit filius ancillae
hujus cum filio meo, cum Ishac.

<span id="xxvii.i-p22"></span>**11.** And the thing was very grievous in
Abraham’s sight because of his son.

<span id="xxvii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Et displicuit res valde in oculis
Abraham, propter filium suum.

<span id="xxvii.i-p24"></span>**12.** And God said unto Abraham, Let it
not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy
bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her
voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

<span id="xxvii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et dixit Deus ad Abraham, Ne
displiceat in oculis tuis super puero, et super ancilla tua: in omnibus
quae dixerit tibi Sarah, audi vocem ejus: quia in Ishac vocabitur tibi
semen.

<span id="xxvii.i-p26"></span>**13.** And also of the son of the
bondwoman will I make a nation, because he *is* thy seed.

<span id="xxvii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Et etiam filium ancillae in gentem
ponam, quia semen tuum est.

<span id="xxvii.i-p28"></span>**14.** And Abraham rose up early in the
morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave *it* unto
Hagar, putting *it* on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away:
and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

<span id="xxvii.i-p29"></span>**14.** Diluculo igitur surrexit Abraham,
et tulit panem, et utrem aquae, et dedit Hagar, et posuit super humerum
ejus, et puerum: et dimisit eam, et perrexit, et erravit in deserto
Beer-sebah.

<span id="xxvii.i-p30"></span>**15.** And the water was spent in the
bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.

<span id="xxvii.i-p31"></span>**15.** Et defecerunt aquae de utre, et
projecit puerum subter unam arborum.

<span id="xxvii.i-p32"></span>**16.** And she went, and sat her down
over against *him* a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said,
Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against *him* ,
and lift up her voice, and wept.

<span id="xxvii.i-p33"></span>**16.** Et abiit, et sedit e regione,
elongando se quantum est jactus arcus: quia dixit, Non videbo quando
morietur puer: et sedit e regione, et elevavit vocem suma, et flevit.

<span id="xxvii.i-p34"></span>**17.** And God heard the voice of the
lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto
her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of
the lad where he *is*

<span id="xxvii.i-p35"></span>**17.** Et audivit Deus vocem pueri, et
clamavit angelus Dei ad Hagar de coelis, et dixit ei, Quid tibi Hagar?
ne timeas: quia audivit Deus vocem pueri ex *loco* ubi est.

<span id="xxvii.i-p36"></span>**18.** Arise, lift up the lad, and hold
him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.

<span id="xxvii.i-p37"></span>**18.** Surge, tolle puerum, et tene manu
tua eum: quia in gentem magnam ponam eum.

<span id="xxvii.i-p38"></span>**19.** And God opened her eyes, and she
saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and
gave the lad drink.

<span id="xxvii.i-p39"></span>**19.** Tunc aperuit Deus oculos ejus, et
vidit puteum aquae, et perrexit et implevit utrem aqua, et potum dedit
puero.

<span id="xxvii.i-p40"></span>**20.** And God was with the lad; and he
grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.

<span id="xxvii.i-p41"></span>**20.** Et fuit Deus cum puero, et crevit,
habitavitque in deserto, et fuit jaculator sagittarius.

<span id="xxvii.i-p42"></span>**21.** And he dwelt in the wilderness of
Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

<span id="xxvii.i-p43"></span>**21.** Et habitavit in deserto Param, et
accepit ei mater ejus uxorem de terra Aegypti.

<span id="xxvii.i-p44"></span>**22.** And it came to pass at that time,
that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto
Abraham, saying, God *is* with thee in all that thou doest:

<span id="xxvii.i-p45"></span>**22.** Deinde fuit tempore illo, dixit
Abimelech et Phicol princeps exercitus ejus ad Abraham, dicendo, Deus
tecum est in omnibus qu ae tu facis:

<span id="xxvii.i-p46"></span>**23.** Now therefore swear unto me here
by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor
with my son’s son: *but* according to the kindness that I have done unto
thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast
sojourned.

<span id="xxvii.i-p47"></span>**23.** Nunc itaque jura mihi per Deum
hic, si mentitus fueris mihi,  <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md)
et filio meo, et nepoti meo: secundum misericordiam, quam feci tecum
facies mecum, et cum terra, in qua peregrinatus es.

<span id="xxvii.i-p49"></span>**24.** And Abraham said, I will swear.

<span id="xxvii.i-p50"></span>**24.** Et dixit Abraham, Ego jurabo.

<span id="xxvii.i-p51"></span>**25.** And Abraham reproved Abimelech
because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently
taken away.

<span id="xxvii.i-p52"></span>**25.** Et increpavit abraham ipsum
Abimelech propter puteum aquae, quem rapuerant servi Abimelech.

<span id="xxvii.i-p53"></span>**26.** And Abimelech said, I wot not who
hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I
*of it* , but to day.

<span id="xxvii.i-p54"></span>**26.** Et dixit Abimelech, Non novi quis
fecerit hoc, neque etiam tu indicasti mihi, neque etiam ego audivi
praeterquam hodie.

<span id="xxvii.i-p55"></span>**27.** And Abraham took sheep and oxen,
and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.

<span id="xxvii.i-p56"></span>**27.** Et accepit Abraham pecudes et
boves, et dedit ipsi Abimelech, et percusserunt ambo foedus.

<span id="xxvii.i-p57"></span>**28.** And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of
the flock by themselves.

<span id="xxvii.i-p58"></span>**28.** Et statuit Abraham septem agnas
pecorum seorsum.

<span id="xxvii.i-p59"></span>**29.** And Abimelech said unto Abraham,
What *mean* these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

<span id="xxvii.i-p60"></span>**29.** Et dixit Abimelech ad Abraham,
Quid sunt septem agnae istae, quos statuisti seorsum?

<span id="xxvii.i-p61"></span>**30.** And he said, For *these* ) seven
ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto
me, that I have digged this well.

<span id="xxvii.i-p62"></span>**30.** Et dixit, Quia septem agnas capies
e manu mea: ut sit mihi in testimonium, quod foderim puteum hunc.

<span id="xxvii.i-p63"></span>**31.** Wherefore he called that place
Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.

<span id="xxvii.i-p64"></span>**31.** Idcirco vocatus est locus ipse
Beer-sebah: quia ibi juraverant ambo.

<span id="xxvii.i-p65"></span>**32.** Thus they made a covenant at
Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his
host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.

<span id="xxvii.i-p66"></span>**32.** Percusserunt ergo foedus in
Beer-sebah: et surrexit Abimelech, et Phicol princeps exercitus ejus, et
reversi sunt in terram Pelisthim.

<span id="xxvii.i-p67"></span>**33.** And *Abraham* planted a grove in
Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting
God.

<span id="xxvii.i-p68"></span>**33.** Et plantavit nemus in Beer-sebah,
et invocavit ibi nomen Jehovae Dei saeculi.

<span id="xxvii.i-p69"></span>**34.** And Abraham sojourned in the
Philistines’ land many days.

<span id="xxvii.i-p70"></span>**34.** Et habitavit Abraham in terra
Pelisthim dies multos.

<span id="xxvii.i-p71"></span> 

<span id="xxvii.i-p72"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p72.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p73"></span>**1.** *And the Lord visited Sarah* . In
this chapters not only is the nativity of Isaac related, but because, in
his very birth, God has set before us a lively picture of his Church,
Moses also gives a particular account of this matter. And first, he says
that God visited Sarah, as he had promised. Because all offspring, flows
from the kindness of God, as it is in the psalm,

<span id="xxvii.i-p74"></span>‘The fruit of the womb is the gift of
God;’ (<span id="xxvii.i-p74.1"></span>[Ps
127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003.md)<span
id="xxvii.i-p74.1"></span>;)

<span id="xxvii.i-p75"></span>therefore the Lord is said, not without
reason, to visit those, to whom he gives children. For although the
foetus seems to be produced naturally, each from its own kind; there is
yet no fecundity in animals, except so far as the Lord puts forth his
own power, to fulfill what he has said, Increase and multiply. But in
the propagation of the human race, his special benediction is
conspicuous; and, therefore, the birth of every child is rightly deemed
the effect of divine visitation. But Moses, in this place, looks higher,
forasmuch as Isaac was born out of the accustomed course of nature.
 <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) Therefore Moses here commends
that secret and unwonted power of God, which is superior to the law of
nature; and not improperly, since it is of great consequence for us to
know that the gratuitous kindness of God reigned, as well in the origin,
as in the progress of the Church; and that the sons of God were not
otherwise born, than from his mere mercy. And this is the reason why he
did not make Abraham a father, till his body was nearly withered. It is
also to be noticed, that Moses declares the visitation which he
mentions, to be founded upon promise; ‘Jehovah visited Sarah, as he had
promised.’ In these words he annexes the effect to its cause, in order
that the special grace of God, of which an example is given in the birth
of Isaac, might be the more perceptible. If he had barely said, that the
Lord had respect unto Sarah, when she brought forth a son; some other
cause might have been sought for. None, however, can doubt, that the
promise, by which Isaac had been granted to his father Abraham, was
gratuitous; since the child was the fruit of that adoption, which can be
ascribed to nothing but the mere grace of God. Therefore, whoever wishes
rightly and prudently to reflect upon the work of God, in the birth of
Isaac, must necessarily begin with the promise. There is also great
emphasis in the repetition, “The Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.”
For he thus retains his readers, as by laying his hand upon them, that
they may pause in the consideration of so great a miracle. Meanwhile,
Moses commends the faithfulness of God; as if he had said he never feeds
men with empty promises, nor is he less true in granting what he has
promised, than he is liberal, and willing, in making the promise.

<span id="xxvii.i-p77"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p77.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p78"></span>**2.** *She bare Abraham a son* . This is
said according to the accustomed manner of speaking; because the woman
is neither the head of a family, nor brings forth properly for herself,
but for her husband. What follows, however, is more worthy of notice, In
his old age, at the set time, which God had predicted: for the old age
of Abraham does, not a little, illustrate the glory of the miracle. And
now Moses, for the third time, recalls us to the word of God, that the
constancy of his truth may always be present to our minds. And though
the time had been predicted, alike to Abraham and to his wife, yet this
honor is expressly attributed to the holy man; because the promise had
been especially given on his account. Both, however, are distinctly
mentioned in the context.

<span id="xxvii.i-p79"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p79.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p80"></span>**3.** *And Abraham called the name* .
Moses does not mean that Abraham was the inventor of the name; but that
he adhered to the name which before had been given by the angel. This
act of obedience, however, was worthy of commendation, since he not only
ratified the word of God, but also executed his office as God’s
minister. For, as a herald, he proclaimed to all, that which the angel
had committed to his trust.

<span id="xxvii.i-p81"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p81.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p82"></span>**4.** *And Abraham circumcised his son* .
Abraham pursued his uniform tenor of obedience, in not sparing his own
son. For, although it would be painful for him to wound the tender body
of the infant; yet, setting aside all human affection, he obeys the word
of God. And Moses records that he did as the Lord had commanded him;
because there is nothing of greater importance, than to take the pure
word of God for our rule, and not to be wise above what is lawful. This
submissive spirit is especially required, in reference to sacraments;
lest men should either invent any thing for themselves, or should
transfer those things which are commanded by the Lord, to any use they
please. We see, indeed, how inordinately the humours of men here
prevail; inasmuch as they have dared to devise innumerable sacraments.
And to go no further for an example, whereas God has delivered only two
sacraments to the Christian Church, the Papists boast that they have
seven. As if truly it were in their power to forge promises of
salvation, which they might sanction with signs imagined by themselves.
But it were superfluous to relate with how many figments the sacraments
have been polluted by them. This certainly is manifest, that there is
nothing about which they are less careful, than to observe what the Lord
has commanded.

<span id="xxvii.i-p83"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p83.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p84"></span>**5.** *And Abraham was an hundred years
old* . Moses again records the age of Abraham the better to excite the
minds of his readers to a consideration of the miracle. And although
mention is made only of Abraham, let us yet remember that he is, in this
place, set before us, not as a man of lust, but as the husband of Sarah,
who has obtained, through her, a lawful seed, in extreme old age, when
the strength of both had failed. For the power of God was chiefly
conspicuous in this, that when their marriage had been fruitless more
than sixty years, suddenly they obtain offspring  <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) . Sarah, truly, in order to make
amends for the doubt to which she had given way, now exultingly
proclaims the kindness of God, with becoming praises. And first, she
says, that God had given her occasion of joy; not of common joy, but of
such as should cause all men to congratulate her. Secondly, for the
purpose of amplification, she assumes the character of an astonished
inquirer, ‘Who would have told this to Abraham?’ Some explain the clause
in question, ‘will laugh at me,’ as if Sarah had said, with shame, that
she should be a proverb to the common people. But the former sense is
more suitable; namely, ‘Whosoever shall hear it, will laugh with me;’
that is, for the sake of congratulating me.

<span id="xxvii.i-p86"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p86.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p87"></span>**7.** *Who would have said unto Abraham,
that Sarah should have given children suck* ? I understand the future
tense to be here put for the subjunctive mood. And the meaning is, that
such a thing would never have entered into the mind of any one. Whence
she concludes, that God alone was the Author of it; and she now condemns
herself for ingratitude because she had been so slow in giving credit to
the angel who had told her of it. Now, since she speaks of children in
the plural number, the Jews, according to their custom, invent the
fable, that whereas a rumor was spread, that the child was
supposititious, a great number of infants were brought by the neighbors,
in order that Sarah, by suckling them, might prove herself a mother. As
if, truly, this might not easily be known, when they saw Isaac hanging
on her breast,  <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) and as if this
was not a more clear and distinct proof, that the milk, pressed out by
the fingers, flowed before their eyes. But the Jews are doubly foolish
and infatuated, as not perceiving, that this form of expression is of
exactly the same import, as if Sarah had called herself a nurse.
Meanwhile, it is to be observed, that Sarah joins the office of nurse
with that of mother; for the Lord does not in vain prepare nutriment for
children in their mothers’ bosoms, before they are born. But those on
whom he confers the honor of mothers, he, in this way, constitutes
nurses; and they who deem it a hardship to nourish their own offspring,
break, as far as they are able, the sacred bond of nature. If disease,
or anything of that kind, is the hindrance, they have a just excuse; but
for mothers voluntarily, and for their own pleasure, to avoid the
trouble of nursing, and thus to make themselves only half-mothers, is a
shameful corruption.

<span id="xxvii.i-p89"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p89.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p90"></span>**8.** *And the child grew, and was
weaned* . Moses now begins to relate the manner in which Ishmael was
rejected from the family of Abraham, in order that Isaac alone might
hold the place of the lawful son and heir. It seems, indeed, at first
sight, something frivolous, that Sarah, being angry about a mere
nothing, should have stirred up strife in the family. But Paul teaches,
that a sublime mystery is here proposed to us, concerning the perpetual
state of the Church. (<span id="xxvii.i-p90.1"></span>[Ga
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#021)<span id="xxvii.i-p90.1"></span>..md)
And, truly, if we attentively consider the persons mentioned, we shall
regard it as no trivial affair, that the father of all the faithful is
divinely commanded to eject his firstborn son; that Ishmael, although a
partaker of the same circumcision, becomes so transformed into a strange
nations as to be no more reckoned among the blessed seed; that, in
appearance, the body of the Church is so rent asunder, that only
one-half of it remains; that Sarah, in expelling the son of her handmaid
from the house, claims the entire inheritance for Isaac alone.
Wherefore, if due attention be applied in the reading of this history,
the very mystery of which Paul treats, spontaneously presents itself.

<span id="xxvii.i-p91"></span>*And Abraham made a great feast* . It is
asked, why he did not rather make it on the day of Isaac’s birth, or
circumcision? The subtile reasoning of Augustine, that the day of
Isaac’s weaning was celebrated, in order that we may learn, from his
example, no more to be children in understandings is too constrained.
What others say, has no greater consistency; namely, that Abraham took a
day which was not then in common use, in order that he might not imitate
the manners of the Gentiles. Indeed, it is very possible, that he may
also have celebrated the birthday of his son, with honor and joy. But
special mention is made of this feast, for another reason; namely, that
then, the mocking of Ishmael was discovered. For I do not assent to the
conjecture of those who think that a new history is here begun; and that
Sarah daily contended with this annoyance, until, at length, she purged
the house by the ejection of the impious mocker. It is indeed probable,
that, on other days also, Ishmael had been elated by similar petulance;
yet I do not doubt but Moses expressly declares that his contempt was
manifested towards Sarah, at that solemn assembly, and that from that
time, it was publicly proclaimed. Now Moses does not speak disparagingly
of the pleasures of that feast, but rather takes their lawfulness for
granted. For it is not his design to prohibit holy men from inviting
their friends, to a common participation of enjoyment, so that they,
jointly giving thanks to God, may feast with greater hilarity than
usual. Temperance and sobriety are indeed always to be observed; and
care must be taken, both that the provision itself be frugal, and the
guests moderate. I would only say, that God does not deal so austerely
with us, as not to allow us, sometimes, to entertain our friends
liberally; as when nuptials are to be celebrated, or when children are
born to us. Abraham, therefore, made a great feast, that is, an
extraordinary one; because he was not accustomed thus sumptuously to
furnish his table every day; yet this was an abundance which by no means
degenerated into luxury. Besides, while he was thus liberal in
entertaining his friends according to his power, he also had sufficient
for unknown guests, as we have seen before.

<span id="xxvii.i-p92"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p92.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p93"></span>**9.** *And Sarah saw the son of Hagar* .
As the verb to laugh has a twofold signification among the Latins, so
also the Hebrews use, both in a good and evil sense, the verb from which
the participle <span id="xxvii.i-p93.1"></span>קחצמ ( *metsachaik* ) is
derived. That it was not a childish and innoxious laughter, appears from
the indignation of Sarah. It was, therefore a malignant expression of
scorn, by which the forward youth manifested his contempt for his infant
brother. And it is to be observed, that the *epithet* which is here
applied to Ishmael, and the name *Isaac* , are both derived from the
same root. Isaac was, to his father and others, the occasion of holy and
lawful laughter; whence also, the name was divinely imposed upon him.
Ishmael turns the blessing of God, from which such joy flowed, into
ridicule. Therefore, as an impious mocker, he stands opposed to his
brother Isaac. Both (so to speak) are the sons of laughter: but in a
very different sense. Isaac brought laughter with him from his mother’s
womb, since he bore, — engraven upon him, — the certain token of God’s
grace. He therefore so exhilarates his father’s house, that joy breaks
forth in thanksgiving; but Ishmael, with canine and profane laughter,
attempts to destroy that holy joy of faith. And there is no doubt that
his manifest impiety against God, betrayed itself under this ridicule.
He had reached an age at which he could not, by any means be ignorant of
the promised favor, on account of which his father Abraham was
transported with so great joy: and yet — proudly confident in himself —
he insults, in the person of his brother, both God and his word, as well
as the faith of Abraham. Wherefore it was not without cause that Sarah
was so vehemently angry with him, that she commanded him to be driven
into exile. For nothing is more grievous to a holy mind, than to see the
grace of God exposed to ridicule. And this is the reason why Paul calls
his laughter persecution; saying,

<span id="xxvii.i-p94"></span>‘He who was after the flesh persecuted the
spiritual seed.’ (<span id="xxvii.i-p94.1"></span>[Ga
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#029)<span id="xxvii.i-p94.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xxvii.i-p95"></span>Was it with sword or violence? Nay, but
with the scorn of the virulent tongue, which does not injure the body,
but pierces into the very soul. Moses might indeed have aggravated his
crime by a multiplicity of words; but I think that he designedly spoke
thus concisely, in order to render the petulance with which Ishmael
ridicules the word of God the more detestable.

<span id="xxvii.i-p97"></span>**10.** *Cast out this bondwoman* . Not
only is Sarah exasperated against the transgressor, but she seems to act
more imperiously towards her husband than was becoming in a modest wife.
Peter shows, that when, on a previous occasion, she called Abraham lord,
she did not do so feignedly; since he proposes her, as an example of
voluntary subjection, to pious and chaste matrons. (<span
id="xxvii.i-p97.1"></span>[1Pe
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006)<span id="xxvii.i-p97.1"></span>..md)
But now, she not only usurps the government of the house, by calling her
husband to order, but commands him whom she ought to reverence, to be
obedient to her will. Here, although I do not deny that Sarah, being
moved by womanly feelings, exceeded the bounds of moderation, I yet do
not doubt, both that her tongue and mind were governed by a secret
impulse of the Spirit, and that this whole affair was directed by the
providence of God. Without controversy, she was the minister of great
and tremendous judgment. And Paul adduces this expression, not as a
futile reproach, which an enraged woman had poured forth, but as a
celestial oracle. But although she sustains a higher character than that
of a private woman, yet she does not take from her husband his power;
but makes him the lawful director of the ejection.

<span id="xxvii.i-p98"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p98.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p99"></span>**11.** *And the thing was very grievous
in Abraham’s sight* . Although Abraham had been already assured, by many
oracles, that the blessed seed should proceed from Isaac only; yet,
under the influence of paternal affection, he could not bear that
Ishmael should be cut off, for the purpose of causing the inheritance to
remain entire to him, to whom it had been divinely granted; and thus, by
mingling two races, he endeavored, as far as he was able, to confound
the distinction which God had made. It may truly seem absurd, that the
servant of God should thus be carried away by a blind impulse: but God
thus deprives him of judgment, not only to humble him, but also to
testify to all ages, that the dispensing of his grace depends upon his
own will alone. Moreover, in order that the holy man may bear, with
greater equanimity, the departure of his son, a double consolation is
promised him. For, first, God recalls to his memory the promise made
concerning Isaac; as if he would say, it is enough and more than enough,
that Isaac, in whom the spiritual benediction remains entire, is left.
He then promises that he will take care of Ishmael, though exiled from
his paternal home; and that a posterity shall arise from him which shall
constitute a whole nation. But I have explained above, on the
seventeenth chapter (<span id="xxvii.i-p99.1"></span>[Ge
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001)<span id="xxvii.i-p99.1"></span>,.md)
what is the meaning of the expression, ‘The seed shall be called in
Isaac.’ And Paul, (<span id="xxvii.i-p99.2"></span>[Ro
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#008)<span id="xxvii.i-p99.2"></span>,.md)
by way of interpretation, uses the word reckoned, or imputed.  <span
id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) And it is certain that, by this
method, the other son was cut off from the family of Abraham; so that he
should no more have a name among his posterity. For God, having severed
Ishmael, shows that the whole progeny of Abraham should flow from one
head. He promises also to Ishmael, that he shall be a nations but
estranged from the Church; so that the condition of the brothers shall,
in this respect, be different; that one is constituted the father of a
spiritual people, to the other is given a carnal seed. Whence Paul
justly infers, that not all who are the seed of Abraham are true and
genuine sons; but they only who are born of the Spirit. For as Isaac
himself became the legitimate son by a gratuitous promise, so the same
grace of God makes a difference among his descendants. But because we
have sufficiently treated of the various sons of Abraham on the
seventeenth chapter, the subject is now more sparingly alluded to.

<span id="xxvii.i-p101"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p101.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p102"></span>**12.** *In all that Sarah hath said unto
thee* . I have just said that although God used the ministry of Sarah in
so great a matter, it was yet possible that she might fail in her method
of acting. He now commands Abraham to hearken unto his wife, not because
he approves her disposition, but because he will have the work, of which
he is Himself the Author, accomplished. And he thus shows that his
designs are not to be subjected to any common rule, especially when the
salvation of the Church is concerned. For he purposely inverts the
accustomed order of nature, in order that he may prove himself to be the
Author and the Perfecter of Isaac’s vocation. But because I have before
declared, that this history is more profoundly considered by Paul, the
sum of it is here briefly to be collected. In the first place, he says,
that what is here read, was written allegorically: not that he wishes
all histories, indiscriminately to be tortured to an allegorical sense,
as Origin does; who by hunting everywhere for allegories, corrupts the
whole Scripture; and others, too eagerly emulating his example, have
extracted smoke out of light. And not only has the simplicity of
Scripture been vitiated, but the faith has been almost subverted, and
the door opened to many foolish dotings. The design of Paul was, to
raise the minds of the pious to consider the secret work of God, in this
history; as if he had said, What Moses relates concerning the house of
Abraham, belongs to the spiritual kingdom of Christ; since, certainly,
that house was a lively image of the Church. This, however, is the
allegorical similitude which Paul commends. Whereas two sons were born
to Abraham, the one by a handmaid, the other by a free woman; he infers,
that there are two kinds of persons born in the Church; the faithful,
whom God endues with the Spirit of adoption, that they may enjoy the
inheritance; and hypocritical disciples, who feign themselves to be what
they are not, and usurp, for a time, a name and place among the sons of
God. He therefore teaches, that there are certain who are conceived and
born in a servile manner; but others, as from a freeborn mother. He then
proceeds to say, that the sons of Hagar are they who are generated by
the servile doctrine of the Law; but that they who, having embraced, by
faith, gratuitous adoption, are born through the doctrine of the Gospel,
are the sons of the free woman. At length he descends to another
similitudes in which he compares Hagar with mount Sinai, but Sarah with
the heavenly Jerusalem. And although I here allude in few words to those
things which my readers will find copiously expounded by me, in the
fourth chapter to the Galatians <span id="xxvii.i-p102.1"></span>[Ga
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#001.md)<span id="xxvii.i-p102.1"></span>;
yet, in this short explanation, it is made perfectly clear what Paul
designs to teach. We know that the true sons of God are born of the
incorruptible seed of the word: but when the Spirit, which gives life to
the doctrine of the Law and the Prophets, is taken away, and the dead
letter alone remains, then that seed is so corrupted, that only
adulterous sons are born in a state of slavery; yet because they are
apparently born of the word of God, though corrupted, they are, in a
sense, the sons of God. Meanwhile, none are lawful heirs, except those
whom the Church brings forth into liberty, being conceived by the
incorruptible seed of the gospel. I have said, however, that in these
two persons is represented the perpetual condition of the Church. For
hypocrites not only mingle with the sons of God in the Church, but
despise them, and proudly appropriate to themselves all the rights and
honors of the Church. And as Ishmael, inflated with the vain title of
primogeniture, harassed his brother Isaac with his taunts; so these men,
relying on their own splendor, reproachfully assail and ridicule the
true faith of the simple: because, by arrogating all things to
themselves, they leave nothing to the grace of God. Hence we are
admonished, that none have a well-grounded confidence of salvation, but
they who, being called freely, regard the mercy of God as their whole
dignity. Again, the Spirit furnishes the consciences of the pious with
strong and effective weapons against the ferociousness of those who,
under a false pretext, boast that they are the Church. We see that it is
no new thing, for persons who are nothing but hypocrites to occupy the
chief place in the Church at God. Wherefore, while at this day, the
Papists proudly exult, there is no reason why we should be disturbed by
their empty and inflated boasts. As to their glorying in their long
succession, it just means as much as if Ishmael were proclaiming himself
the firstborn. It is, therefore necessary to discriminate between the
true and the hypocritical Church. Paul describes a mark, which they are
never able, with their cavils, to obliterate. For as large bottles are
broken with a slight blast; so by this single word, all their glory is
extinguished, ‘the sons of the handmaid shall not be eternal
inheritors.’ In the meantime their insolence is to be patiently borne,
so long as God shall loosen the rein to their tyranny. For the Apostles,
formerly, were oppressed by the Jewish hypocrites of their age, with the
same reproaches which these men now cast upon us. In the same way,
Ishmael triumphed over Isaac, as if he had obtained the victory.
Wherefore, we must not wonder, if our own age also has its Ishmaelites.
But lest such indignity should break our spirits, let this consolation
perpetually occur to us, that they who hold the preeminence in the
Church, will not always remain within it.

<span id="xxvii.i-p103"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p103.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p104"></span>**14.** *And Abraham rose up early* . How
painful was the wound, which the ejection of his firstborn son inflicted
upon the mind of the holy man, we may gather from the double consolation
with which God mitigated his grief: He sends his son into banishments
just as if he were tearing out his own bowels. But being accustomed to
obey God, he brings into subjection the paternal love, which he is not
able wholly to cast aside. This is the true test of faith and piety,
when the faithful are so far compelled to deny themselves, that they
even resign the very affections of their original nature, which are
neither evil nor vicious in themselves, to the will of God. There is no
doubt that, during the whole night, he had been tossed with various
cares; that he had a variety of internal conflicts, and endured severe
torments; yet he arose early in the morning, to hasten his separation
from his child; since he knew that it was the will of God.

<span id="xxvii.i-p105"></span>*And took bread, and a bottle of water* .
Moses intimates not only that Abraham committed his son to the care of
his mother, but that he relinquished his own paternal right over him;
for it was necessary for this son to be alienated, that he might not
afterwards be accounted the seed of Abraham. But with what a slender
provision does he endow his wife and her son? He places a flagon of
water and bread upon her shoulder. Why does he not, at least, load an
ass with a moderate supply of food? Why does he not add one of his
servants, of which his house contained plenty, as a companion? Truly
either God shut his eyes, that, what he would gladly have done, might
not come into his mind; or Abraham limited her provision, in order that
she might not go far from his house. For doubtless he would prefer to
have them near himself, for the purpose of rendering them such
assistance as they would need. Meanwhile, God designed that the
banishment of Ishmael should be thus severe and sorrowful; in order
that, by his example, he might strike terror into the proud, who, being
intoxicated with present gifts, trample under foot, in their
haughtiness, the very grace to which they are indebted for all things.
Therefore he brought the mother and child to a distressing issue. For
after they have wandered into the desert, the water fails; and the
mother departs from her son; which was a token of despair. Such was the
reward of the pride, by which they had been vainly inflated. It had been
their duty humbly to embrace the grace of God offered to all people, in
the person of Isaac: but they impiously spurned him whom God had exalted
to the highest honor. The knowledge of God’s gifts ought to have formed
their minds to modesty. And because nothing was more desirable for them,
than to retain some corner in Abraham’s house, they ought not to have
shrunk from any kind of subjection, for the sake of so great a benefit:
God now exacts from them the punishment, which they had deserved, by
their ingratitude.

<span id="xxvii.i-p106"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p106.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p107"></span>**17.** *God heard the voice of the lad*
. Moses had said before that Hagar wept: how is it then, that,
disregarding her tears, God only hears the voice of the *lad* ? If we
should say, that the mother did not deserve to receive a favorable
answer to her prayers; her son, certainly, was in no degree more worthy.
For, as to the supposition of some, that they both were brought to
repentance by this chastisement, it is but an uncertain conjecture. I
leave their repentance, of which I can see no sign, to the judgment of
God. The cry of the boy was heard, as I understand it, not because he
had prayed in faith; but because God, mindful of his own promise, was
inclined to have compassion upon them. For Moses does not say, that
their vows and sighs were directed towards heaven; it is rather to be
believed, that, in bewailing their miseries, they did not resort to
divine help. But God, in assisting them, had respect, not to what *they
desired* of him, but to what *he had promised* to Abraham concerning
Ishmael. In this sense Moses seems to say that the voice of the boy was
heard; namely, because he was the son of Abraham.

<span id="xxvii.i-p108"></span>*What aileth thee, Hagar?*  <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) The angel reproves the ingratitude of
Hagar; because, when reduced to the greatest straits, she does not
reflect on God’s former kindness towards her, in similar danger; so
that, as one who has found him to be a deliverer, she might again cast
herself upon his faithfulness. Nevertheless, the angel assures her that
a remedy is prepared for her sorrows if only she will seek it. Therefore
in the clause, What aileth thee?  <span
id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) is a reproof for having tormented
herself in vain, by confused lamentation. When he afterwards says, Fear
not, he invites and exhorts her to hope for mercy. But what, we may ask,
is the meaning of the expression, which he adds, where he is?  <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) It may seem that there is a suppressed
antithesis between the place where he now was, and the house of Abraham;
so that Hagar might conclude, that although she was wandering in the
desert as an exile from the sanctuary of God, yet she was not entirely
forsaken by God; since she had him for a Leader in her exile. Or else,
the phrase is emphatical; implying, that, though the boy is cast into
solitude, and counted as one forsaken, he nevertheless has God nigh unto
him. And thus the angel, to relieve the despair of the anxious mother,
commands her to return to the place where she had laid down her son. For
(as is usual in desperate circumstances) she had become stupefied
through grief; and would have lain as one lifeless, unless she had been
roused by the voice of the angel. We perceive, moreover, in this
example, how truly it is said, that when father and mother forsake us,
the Lord will take us up.

<span id="xxvii.i-p112"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p112.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p113"></span>**18.** *Arise lift up the lad* . In
order that she might have more courage to bring up her son, God confirms
to her what he had before often promised to Abraham. Indeed, nature
itself prescribes to mothers what they owe to their children; but, as I
have lately hinted, all the natural feelings of Hagar would have been
destroyed, unless God had revived her, by inspiring new confidence, to
address herself with fresh vigor to the fulfillment of her maternal
office. With respect to the fountain or “well,”  <span
id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) some think it suddenly sprung up. But
since Moses says, that the *eyes* of Hagar were opened, and not that the
*earth* was opened or dug up; I rather incline to the opinion, that,
having been previously astonished with grief, she did not discern what
was plainly before her eyes; but now, at length, after God has restored
her vision, she begins to see it. And it is worthy of especial notice,
that when God leaves us destitute of his superintendence, and takes away
his grace from us, we are as much deprived of all the aids which are
close at hand, as if they were removed to the greatest distance.
Therefore we must ask, not only that he would bestow upon us such things
as will be useful to us, but that he will also impart prudence to enable
us to use them; otherwise, it will be our lot to faint, with closed
eyes, in the midst of fountains.

<span id="xxvii.i-p115"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p115.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p116"></span>**20.** *And God was with the lad* .
There are many ways in which God is said to be present with men. He is
present with his elect, whom he governs by the special grace of his
Spirit; he is present also, sometimes, as it respects external life, not
only with his elect, but also with strangers, in granting them some
signal benediction: as Moses, in this place, commends the extraordinary
grace by which the Lord declares that his promise is not void, since he
pursues Ishmael with favor, because he was the son of Abraham. Hence,
however, this general doctrine is inferred; that it is to be entirely
ascribed to God that men grow up, that they enjoy the light and common
breath of heaven, and that the earth supplies them with food. Only it
must be remembered, the prosperity of Ishmael flowed from this cause,
that an earthly blessing was promised him for the sake of his father
Abraham. In saying, that Hagar took a wife for Ishmael, Moses has
respect to civil order; for since marriage forms a principal part of
human life, it is right that, in contracting it, children should be
subject to their parents, and should obey their counsel. This order,
which nature prescribes and dictates, was, as we see, observed by
Ishmael, a wild man in the barbarism of the desert; for he was subject
to his mother in marrying a wife. Whence we perceive, what a prodigious
monster was the Pope, when he dared to overthrow this sacred right of
nature. To this is also added the impudent boast of authorizing a wicked
contempt of parents, in honor of holy wedlock. Moreover the Egyptian
wife was a kind of prelude to the future dissension between the
Israelites and the Ishmaelites.

<span id="xxvii.i-p117"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p117.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p118"></span>**22.** *And it came to pass at that
time* . Moses relates, that this covenant was entered into between
Abraham and Abimelech, for the purpose of showing, that after various
agitations, some repose was, at length, granted to the holy man. He had
been constrained, as a wanderer, and without a fixed abode, to move his
tent from place to place, during sixty years. But although God would
have him to be a sojourner even unto death, yet, under king Abimelech,
he granted him a quiet habitation. And it is the design of Moses to
show, how it happened, that he occupied one place longer than he was
wont. The circumstance of time is to be noted; namely, soon after he had
dismissed his son. For it seems that his great trouble was immediately
followed by this consolation, not only that he might have some
relaxation from continued inconveniences, but that he might be the more
cheerful, and might the more quietly occupy himself in the education of
his little son Isaac. It is however certain, that the covenant was not,
in every respect, an occasion of joy to him; for he perceived that he
was tried by indirect methods, and that there were many persons in that
region, to whom he was disagreeable and hateful. The king, indeed openly
avowed his own suspicions of him: it was, however, the highest honor,
that the king of the place should go, of his own accord, to a stranger,
to enter into a covenant with him. Yet it may be asked, whether this
covenant was made on just and equal conditions, as is the custom among
allies? I certainly do not doubt, that Abraham freely paid due honor to
the king; nor is it probable that the king intended to detract anything
from his own dignity, in order to confer it upon Abraham. What, then,
did he do? Truly, while he allowed Abraham a free dwelling-place, he
would yet hold him bound to himself by an oath.

<span id="xxvii.i-p119"></span>*God is with thee in all that thou doest*
. He commences in friendly and bland terms; he does not accuse Abraham
nor complain that he had neglected any duty towards himself, but
declares that he earnestly desires his friendship; still the conclusion
is, that he wishes to be on his guard against him. It may then be asked,
Whence had he this suspicion, or fear, first of a stranger, and,
secondly, of an honest and moderate man? In the first place, we know
that the heathen are often anxious without cause, and are alarmed even
in seasons of quiet. Next, Abraham was a man deserving of reverence; the
number of servants in his house seemed like a little nation; and there
is no doubt, that his virtues would acquire for him great dignity; hence
it was, that Abimelech suspected his power. But whereas Abimelech had a
private consideration for himself in this matter; the Lord, who best
knows how to direct events, provided, in this way, for the repose of his
servant. We may, however, learn, from the example of Abraham, if, at any
time, the gifts of God excite the enmity of the men of this world
against us, to conduct ourselves with such moderation, that they may
find nothing amiss in us.

<span id="xxvii.i-p120"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p120.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p121"></span>**23.** *That thou wilt not deal falsely
with me*  <span id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) Literally it is, ‘If
thou shalt lie;’ for, among the Hebrews, a defective form of speech is
common in taking oaths, which is to be thus explained: ‘If thou shouldst
break the promise given to me, we call upon God to sit as Judge between
us, and to show himself the avenger of perjury.’ But ‘to lie,’ some here
take for dealing unjustly and fraudulently; others for failing in the
conditions of the covenant. I simply understand it as if it were said,
‘Thou shalt do nothing perfidiously with me or with my descendants.’
Abimelech also enumerates his own acts of kindness, the lore effectually
to exhort Abraham to exercise good faith; for, seeing he had been
humanely treated, Abimelech declares it would be an act of base
ingratitude if he did not, in return, endeavor to repay the benefits he
had received. The Hebrew word <span id="xxvii.i-p122.3"></span>דסח (
*chesed* ) signifies to deal gently or kindly with any one.  <span
id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md) For Abimelech did not come to implore
compassion of Abraham, but rather to assert his own royal authority, as
will appear from the context.

<span id="xxvii.i-p124"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p124.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p125"></span>**24.** *And Abraham said, I will swear*
. Although he had the stronger claim of right, he yet refuses nothing
which belonged to the duty of a good and moderate man. And truly, since
it is becoming in the sons of God to be freely ready for every duty;
nothing is more absurd, than for them to appear reluctant and morose,
when what is just is required of them. He did not refuse to swear,
because he knew it to be lawful, that covenants should be ratified
between men, in the sacred name of God. In short, we see Abraham
willingly submitting himself to the laws of his vocation.

<span id="xxvii.i-p126"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p126.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p127"></span>**25.** *And Abraham reproved Abimelech*
. This complaint seems to be unjust; for, if he had been injured, why
did he not resort to the ordinary remedy? He knew the king to be humane,
to have some seed of piety, and to have treated himself courteously and
honorably; why then does he doubt that he will prove the equitable
defender of his right? If, indeed, he had chosen rather to smother the
injury received, than to be troublesome to the king, why does he now
impute the fault to him, as if he had been guilty? Possibly, however,
Abraham might know that the injury had been done, through the excessive
forbearance of the king. We may assuredly infer, both from his manners
and his disposition, that he did not expostulate without cause; and
hence the moderation of the holy man is evident; because, when deprived
of the use of water, found by his own industry and labor, he does not
contend, as the greatness of the injury would have justified him in
doing; for this was just as if the inhabitants of the place had made an
attempt upon his life. But though he patiently bore so severe an injury,
yet when beyond expectation, the occasion of taking security is offered,
he guards himself from fixture aggression. We also see how severely the
Lord exercised Abraham, as soon as he appeared to be somewhat more at
ease, and had obtained a little alleviation. Certainly, it was not a
light trial, to be compelled to contend for water; and not for water
which was public property but for that of a well, which he himself had
digged.

<span id="xxvii.i-p128"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p128.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p129"></span> **27.** *And Abraham took sheep* . Hence
it appears that the covenant made, was not such as is usually entered
into between equals: for Abraham considers his own position, and in
token of subjection, offers a gift, from his flocks, to king Gerar; for,
what the Latins call paying tax or tribute, and what we call doing
homage, the Hebrews call offering gifts.  <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md) And truly Abraham does not wait till
something is forcibly, and with authority, extorted from him by the
king; but, by a voluntary giving of honor, anticipates him, whom he
knows to have dominion over the place. It is too well known, how great a
desire of exercising authority prevails among men. Hence, the greater
praise is due to the modesty of Abraham, who not only abstains from what
belongs to another man; but even offers, uncommanded, what, in his own
mind, he regards as due to another, in virtue of his office. A further
question however arises; since Abraham knew that the dominion over the
land had been divinely committed to him, whether it was lawful for him
to profess a subjection by which he acknowledged another as lord? But
the solution is easy, because the time of entering into possession had
not yet arrived; for he was lord, only in expectation, while, in fact,
he was a pilgrim. Wherefore, he acted rightly in purchasing a
habitation, till the time should come, when what had been promised to
him, should be given to his posterity. Thus, soon afterwards, as we
shall see, he paid a price for his wife’s sepulcher. In short, until he
should be placed, by the hand of God, in legitimate authority over the
land he did not scruple to treat with the inhabitants of the place, that
he might dwell among them by permission, or by the payment of a price.

<span id="xxvii.i-p131"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p131.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p132"></span>**28.** *And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs
of the flock by themselves* . Moses recites another chief point of the
covenant; namely, that Abraham made express provision for himself
respecting the well, that he should have free use of its water. And he
placed in the midst seven lambs, that the king being presented with the
honorary gift, might approve and ratify the digging of the well. For the
inhabitants might provoke a controversy, on the ground that it was not
lawful for a private man, and a stranger, to dig a well; but now, when
the public authority of the king intervened, Abraham’s peace was
consulted, that no one might disturb him. Many understand lambs here to
mean pieces of money coined in the form of lambs, but since mention has
previously been made of sheep and oxen, and Moses now immediately
subjoins that seven lambs are placed apart, it is absurd, in this
connection, to speak of money.

<span id="xxvii.i-p133"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p133.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p134"></span>**31.** *Wherefore he called that place
Beer-sheba* . Moses has once already called the place by this name, but
proleptically. Now, however, he declares when, and for what reason, the
name was given; namely, because there both he and Abimelech had sworn;
therefore I translate the term ‘the well of swearing.’ Others translate
it ‘the well of seven.’ But Moses plainly derives the word from
swearing; nor is it of any consequence that the pronunciation slightly
varies from grammatical correctness, which in proper names is not very
nicely observed. In fact, Moses does not restrict the etymology to the
*well* , but comprises the whole covenant. I do not, however, deny that
Moses might allude to the number *seven*  <span
id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md)

<span id="xxvii.i-p136"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p136.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p137"></span>**33.** *And Abraham planted a grove* .
It hence appears that more rest was granted to Abraham, after the
covenant was entered into, than he had hitherto enjoyed; for now he
begins to plant trees, which is a sign of a tranquil and fixed
habitation; for we never before read that he planted a single shrub.
Wherefore, we see how far his condition was improved because he was
permitted to lead (as I may say) a settled life. The assertion, that he
called on the name of the Lord, I thus interpret; he instituted anew the
solemn worship of God, in order to testify his gratitude. Therefore God,
after he had led his servant through continually winding paths, gave to
him some relaxation in his extreme old age. And he sometimes so deals
with his faithful people, that when they have been tossed by various
storms, he at length permits them to breathe freely. As it respects
calling upon God, we know that Abraham, wherever he went, never
neglected this religious duty. Nor was he deterred by dangers from
professing himself a worshipper of the true God; although, on this
account, he was hateful to his neighbors. But as his conveniences for
dwelling in the land increased, he became the more courageous in
professing the worship of God. And because he now lived more securely
under the protection of the king, he perhaps wished to bear open
testimony, that he received even this as from God. For the same reason,
the title of the everlasting God seems to be given, as if Abraham would
say, that he had not placed his confidence in an earthly kings and was
not engaging in any new covenant, by which he would be departing from
the everlasting God. The reason why Moses, by the figure *synecdoche* ,
gives to the worship of God the name of *invocation* , I have elsewhere
explained. Lastly, Abraham is here said to have sojourned in that land
in which he, nevertheless, had a settled abode; whence we learn, that
his mind was not so fixed upon this state of repose, as to prevent him
frown considering what he had before heard from the mouth of God, that
he with his posterity should be strangers till the expiration of four
hundred years.

both an oath and the number seven, room is left for this difference of
interpretation. Calvin seems, however, to allude to a notion not
uncommon among learned men, that as oaths were often made before seven
witnesses, which perhaps the seven lambs represented, Abraham might have
this number as well as the oath in his mind, when he called the well
Beer-sheba. — *Ed*
