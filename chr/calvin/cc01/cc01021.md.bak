<span id="xxii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 16.

<span id="xxii.i"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p1"></span><span id="xxii.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
16:1-16](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#001.md)<span id="xxii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no
children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name *was* Hagar.

<span id="xxii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Porro Sarai uxor Abram non pepererat
ei: erat autem ei ancilla Aegyptia, et nomen ejus Hagar.

<span id="xxii.i-p4"></span>**2.** And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold
now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto
my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram
hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

<span id="xxii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et dixit Sarai ad Abram, Ecce, nunc
conclusit me Jehova, ne parerem: ingredere nunc ad ancillam meam, si
forte aedificer ex ea: et paruit Abram voci Sarai.

<span id="xxii.i-p6"></span>**3.** And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her
maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of
Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.

<span id="xxii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et tulit Sarai uxor Abram, Hagar
Aegyptiam ancillam suam in fine decem annorum, quibus habitavit Abram in
terra Chenaan, et dedit eam Abram viro suo in uxorem.

<span id="xxii.i-p8"></span>**4.** And he went in unto Hagar, and she
conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was
despised in her eyes.

<span id="xxii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et ingressus est ad Hagar, et
concepit: et videns quod concepisset, despectui habuit dominam suam in
oculis suis.

<span id="xxii.i-p10"></span>**5.** And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong
*be* upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw
that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge
between me and thee.

<span id="xxii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Tunc dixit Sarai ad Abram, Injuria
mea super to: ego dedi ancillam meam in sinu tuo, et ubi vidit quod
concepisset, despectui sum in oculis ejus: judicet Jehova inter me et
to.

<span id="xxii.i-p12"></span>**6.** But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold,
thy maid *is* in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai
dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.

<span id="xxii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et dixit Abram ad Sarai, Ecce,
ancilla tua in manu tua, fac ei quod bonum est in oculis tuis: et
afflixit eam Sarai, et fugit a facie ejus.

<span id="xxii.i-p14"></span>**7.** And the angel of the LORD found her
by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to
Shur.

<span id="xxii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Et invenit eam Angelus Jehovae juxta
fontem aquae in deserto, juxta fontem in via Sur.

<span id="xxii.i-p16"></span>**8.** And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid,
whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from
the face of my mistress Sarai.

<span id="xxii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et dixit, Hagar ancilla Sarai, unde
venis, et quo vadis? Et dixit, A facie Sarai dominae meae ego fugio.

<span id="xxii.i-p18"></span>**9.** And the angel of the LORD said unto
her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

<span id="xxii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Et dixit ei Angelus Jehovae,
Revertere ad dominam tuam, et humilia to sub manibus ejus.

<span id="xxii.i-p20"></span>**10.** And the angel of the LORD said unto
her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered
for multitude.

<span id="xxii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Adhaec dixit ei Angelus Jehovae,
Multiplicando multiplicabo semen tuum, et non numerabitur prae
multitudine.

<span id="xxii.i-p22"></span>**11.** And the angel of the LORD said unto
her, Behold, thou *art* with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call
his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.

<span id="xxii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Praeterea dixit ei Angelus Jehovae,
Ecce, es praegnans, et paries filium, et vocabis nomen ejus Ismael: quia
audivit Jehova afflictionem tuam.

<span id="xxii.i-p24"></span>**12.** And he will be a wild man; his hand
*will be* against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he
shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.

<span id="xxii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et ipse erit ferus homo, manus ejus
in omnes, et manus omnium in eum: et coram omnibus fratribus suis
habitabit.

<span id="xxii.i-p26"></span>**13.** And she called the name of the LORD
that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here
looked after him that seeth me?

<span id="xxii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Et vocavit nomen Jehovae qui
loquebatur sibi, Tu Deus videns me: quia dixit, Nonne etiam hie vidi
post videntem me?

<span id="xxii.i-p28"></span>**14.** Wherefore the well was called
Beerlahairoi; behold, *it is* between Kadesh and Bered.

<span id="xxii.i-p29"></span>**14.** Idcirco vocavit puteum, Puteum
viventis videntis me. Ecce, *est* inter Cades et Bared.

<span id="xxii.i-p30"></span>**15.** And Hagar bare Abram a son: and
Abram called his son’s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.

<span id="xxii.i-p31"></span>**15.** Et peperit Hagar ipsi Abram filium:
et vocavit Abram nomen filii sui, quem peperit Hagar, Ismael.

<span id="xxii.i-p32"></span>**16.** And Abram *was* fourscore and six
years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.

<span id="xxii.i-p33"></span>**16.** Abram autem erat octoginta annorum
et sex annorum, quando peperit Hagar Ismael ipsi Abram.

<span id="xxii.i-p34"></span> 

<span id="xxii.i-p35"></span><span id="xxii.i-p35.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p36"></span>**1.** *Now* *Sarai* *,* *Abram’s* *wife* .
Moses here recites a new history, namely, that Sarai, through the
impatience of long delay, resorted to a method of obtaining seed by her
husband, at variance with the word of God. She saw that she was barren,
and had passed the age of bearing. And she inferred the necessity of a
new remedy, in order that Abram might obtain the promised blessing.
Moses expressly relates, that the design of marrying a second wife did
not originate with Abram himself, but with Sarai, to teach us that the
holy man was not impelled by lust to these nuptials; but that when he
was thinking of no such thing, he was induced to engage in them, by the
exhortation of his wife. It is, however, asked, whether Sarai
substituted her handmaid in her place, through the mere desire of having
offspring? So it seems to some; yet to me it is incredible, that the
pious matron should not have been cognizant of those promises, which had
been so often repeated to her husband. Yea, it ought to be fully taken
for granted, among all pious persons, that the mother of the people of
God, was a participator of the same grace with her husband. Sarai,
therefore, does not desire offspring (as is usual) from a merely natural
impulse; but she yields her conjugal rights to another, through a wish
to obtain that benediction, which she knew was divinely promised: not
that she makes a divorce from her husband, but assigns him another wife,
from whom he might receive children. And certainly if she had desired
offspring in the ordinary manner, it would rather have come into her
mind to do it by the adoption of a son, than by giving place to a second
wife. For we know the vehemence of female jealousy. Therefore, while
contemplating the promise, she becomes forgetful of her own right, and
thinks of nothing but the bringing forth of children to Abram. A
memorable example, from which no small profit accrues to us. For however
laudable was Sarai’s wish, as regards the end, or the scope to which it
tended; nevertheless, in the pursuit of it, she was guilty of no light
sin, by impatiently departing from the word of God, for the purpose of
enjoying the effect of that word. While she rejects upon her own
barrenness and old age, she begins to despair of offspring, unless Abram
should have children from some other quarter; in this there is already
some fault. Yet, however desperate the affair might be, still she ought
not to have attempted anything at variance with the will of God and the
legitimate order of nature. God designed that the human race should be
propagated by sacred marriage. Sarai perverts the law of marriage, by
defiling the conjugal bed, which was appointed only for two persons. Nor
is it an available excuse, that she wished Abram to have a concubine and
not a wife; since it ought to have been regarded as a settled point,
that the woman is joined to the man, ‘that they two should be one
flesh.’ And though polygamy had already prevailed among many; yet it was
never left to the will of man, to abrogate that divine law by which two
persons were mutually bound together. Nor was even Abram free from
fault, in following the foolish and preposterous counsel of his wife.
Therefore, as the precipitancy of Sarai was culpable, so the facility
with which Abram yielded to her wish was worthy of reprehension. The
faith of both of them was defective; not indeed with regard to the
substance of the promise, but with regard to the method in which they
proceeded;  <span id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md) since they hastened
to acquire the offspring which was to be expected from God, without
observing the legitimate ordinance of God. Whence also we are taught
that God does not in vain command his people to be quiet, and to wait
with patience, whenever he defers or suspends the accomplishment of
their wishes. For they who hasten before the time, not only anticipate
the providence of God, but being discontented with his word, precipitate
themselves beyond their proper bounds. But it seems that Sarai had
something further in view; for she not only wished that Abram should
become a father, but would fain acquire to herself maternal rights and
honors. I answer, since she knew that all nations were to be blessed in
the seed of Abram, it is no wonder that she should be unwilling to be
deprived of participation in his honor; lest she should be cut off, as a
putrid member, from the body which had received the blessing, and should
also become an alien from the promised salvation.

<span id="xxii.i-p38"></span>*Bare* *him* *no* *children* . This seems
added as an excuse. And truly Moses intimates that she did not seek help
from the womb of her maid, before necessity compelled her to do so. Her
own words also show, that she had patiently and modestly waited to see
what God would do, until hope was entirely cut off, when she says, that
she was restrained from bearing by the Lord. (<span
id="xxii.i-p38.1"></span>[Ge 16:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#002.md)<span
id="xxii.i-p38.1"></span>.) What fault then shall we find in her?
Surely, that she did not, as she ought, cast this care into the bosom of
God, without binding his power to the order of nature, or restraining it
to her own sense. And then, by neglecting to infer from the past what
would take place in future, she did not regard herself as in the hand of
God, who could again open the womb which he had closed.

<span id="xxii.i-p39"></span><span id="xxii.i-p39.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p40"></span>**2.** *That* *I* *may* *obtain* *children*
*by* *her*  <span id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) This is a Hebrew
phrase, which signifies to become a mother. Some however, expound the
word as simply meaning, *to have a son* . And certainly <span
id="xxii.i-p41.2"></span>ןב ( *ben* ,) which, among the Hebrews,
signifies son, corresponds with the verb here used.  <span
id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md) But since sons are so called
metaphorically as being the maintainers of the race, and thus building
up the family, therefore the primary signification of the word is to be
retained. But Sarai claims for herself by right of dominion, the child
which Hagar shall bring forth: because handmaids do not bring forth for
themselves, since they have not power over their own body. By first
speaking to her husband, she does not barely *allow* of a concubine, who
should be as a harlot; but *introduces* and *obtrudes* one. And hence it
appears, that when persons are wiser in their own eyes than they ought
to be, they easily fall into the snare of trying illicit means. The
desire of Sarai proceeds from the zeal of faith; but because it is not
so subjected to God as to wait his time, she immediately has recourse to
polygamy, which is nothing else than the corruption of lawful marriage.
Moreover, since Sarai, that holy woman, yet fanned in her husband the
same flame of impatience with which she burned, we may hence learn, how
diligently we ought to be on our guard, lest Satan should surprise us by
any secret fraud. For not only does he induce wicked and ungodly men
openly to oppose our faith; but sometimes, privately and by stealth, he
assails us through the medium of good and simple men, that he may
overcome us unawares. On every side, therefore, we must be on our guard
against his wiles; lest by any means he should undermine us.

<span id="xxii.i-p43"></span>*And* *Abram* *hearkened* *to* *the*
*voice* *of* *Sarai* . Truly the faith of Abram wavers, when he deviates
from the word of God, and suffers himself to be borne away by the
persuasion of his wife, to seek a remedy which was divinely prohibited.
He, however, retains the foundation, because he does not doubt that he
shall, at length, perceive that God is true. By which example we are
taught, that there is no reason why we should despond, if, at any time,
Satan should shake our faith; provided that the truth of God be not
overthrown in our hearts. Meanwhile, when we see Abram, who, through so
many years, had bravely contended like an invincible combatant, and had
surmounted so many obstacles, now yielding, in a single moment, to
temptation; who among us will not fear for himself in similar danger?
Therefore, although we may have stood long and firmly in the faith, we
must daily pray, that God would not lead us into temptation.

<span id="xxii.i-p44"></span><span id="xxii.i-p44.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p45"></span>**3.** *And* *gave* *her* *to* *her*
*husband* *Abram* *to* *be* *his* *wife* . Moses states what was the
design of Sarai; for neither did she intend to make her house a brothel,
nor to be the betrayer of her maid’s chastity, nor a pander for her
husband. Yet Hagar is improperly called a wife; because she was brought
into another person’s bed, against the law of God. Wherefore, let us
know that this connection was so far illicit, as to be something between
fornication and marriage. The same thing takes place with all those
inventions which are appended to the word of God. For with whatever fair
pretext they may be covered, there is an inherent corruption, which
degenerates from the purity of the word, and vitiates the whole.

<span id="xxii.i-p46"></span><span id="xxii.i-p46.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p47"></span>**4.** *Her* *mistress* *was* *despised*
*in* *her* *eyes* . Here Moses relates that the punishment of excessive
precipitancy quickly followed. The chief blame, indeed, rested with
Sarai; yet because Abram had proved himself too credulous, God chastises
both as they deserve. Sarai is grievously and bitterly tried, by the
proud contempt of her handmaid; Abram is harassed by unjust complaints;
thus we see that both pay the penalty of their levity, and that the
contrivance devised by Sarai, and too eagerly embraced by Abram, fails
of success. Meanwhile, in Hagar, an instance of ingratitude is set
before us; because she, having been treated with singular kindness and
honor, begins to hold her mistress in contempt. Since, however, this is
an exceedingly common disease of the mind, let the faithful accustom
themselves to the endurance of it; if, at any time, a return so unjust
be made to them, for their acts of kindness. But especially, let the
infirmity of Sarai move us thus to act, since she was unable to bear the
contempt of her maid.

<span id="xxii.i-p48"></span><span id="xxii.i-p48.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p49"></span>**5.** *My* *wrong* *be* *upon* *thee* .
This also was a part of her punishment, that Sarai was brought so low as
to forget herself for a while; and being vehemently excited, conducted
herself with so much weakness. Certainly, to the utmost of her power,
she had impelled her husband to act rashly; and now she petulantly
insults him, although innocent. For she adduces nothing for which Abram
was to be blamed. She reproaches him with the fact, that she had given
her maid into his bosom; and complains that she is condemned by this
maid, without having first ascertained, whether he intended to assist
the bad cause, by his countenance, or not. Thus blind is the assault of
anger; it rushes impetuously hither and thither; and condemns, without
inquiry, those who are entirely free from blame. If ever any woman was
of a meek and gentle spirit, Sarai excelled in that virtue. Whereas,
therefore, we see that her patience was violently shaken by a single
offense, let every one of us he so much the more resolved to govern his
own passions.

<span id="xxii.i-p50"></span>*The* *Lord* *judge* *between* *me* *and*
*thee* . She makes improper use of the name of God, and almost forgets
that due reverence, which is so strongly enforced on those who are
godly. She makes her appeal to the judgment of God. What else is this,
than to call down destruction on her own head? For if God had interposed
as judge, he must of necessity have executed punishment upon one or
other of them. But Abram had done no injury. It remains, therefore, that
she must have felt the vengeance of God, whose anger she had so rashly
imprecated upon herself, or her husband. Had Moses spoken this of any
heathen woman, it might have been passed over as a common thing. But
now, the Lord shows us, in the person of the mother of the faithful;
first, how vehement is the flame of anger, and to what lengths it will
hurry men; then, how greatly they are blinded who, in their own affairs,
are too indulgent to themselves; whence we should learn to suspect
ourselves, whenever our own concerns are treated of. Another thing also
is here chiefly worthy of remark; namely, that the best ordered families
are sometimes not free from contentions; nay, that this evil reaches
even to the Church of God; for we know that the family of Abram, which
was disturbed with strifes, was the living representation of the Church.
As to domestic broils, we know that the principal part of social life,
which God hallowed among men, is spent in marriage; and yet various
inconveniences intervene, which defile that good state, as with spots.
It behoves the faithful to prepare themselves to cut off these occasions
of trouble. For this end, it is of great importance to reflect on the
origin of the evil; for all the troubles men find in marriage, they
ought to impute to sin.

<span id="xxii.i-p51"></span><span id="xxii.i-p51.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p52"></span>**6.** *Behold* *,* *thy* *maid* *is* *in*
*thy* *hand* . The greatness of Abram’s humanity and modesty appears
from his answer. He does not quarrel with his wife; and though he has
the best cause, yet he does not pertinaciously defend it, but
voluntarily dismisses the wife who had been given him. In short, for the
sake of restoring peace, he does violence to his feelings, both as a
husband, and a father. For, in leaving Hagar to the will of her enraged
mistress, he does not treat her as his wife; he also, in a certain way,
undervalues that object of his hope which was conceived in her womb. And
it is not to be doubted that he was thus calm and placid in bearing the
vehemence of his wife; because, throughout her whole life, he had found
her to be obedient. Still it was a great excellence, to restrain his
temper under an indignity so great. It may, however, here be asked, how
it was that his care for the blessed seed had then vanished from his
mind? Hagar is great with child; he hopes that the seed through which
the salvation of the world was promised, is about to proceed from her.
Why then does he not set Sarai aside, and turn his love and desire still
more to Hagar? Truly we hence infer, that all human contrivances pass
away and vanish in smoke, as soon as any grievous temptation is
presented. Having taken a wife against the divine command, he thinks the
matter is succeeding well, when he sees her pregnant, and pleases
himself in foolish confidence; but when contention suddenly arises, he
is at his wit’s end, and rejects all hope, or, at least, forgets it. The
same thing must necessarily happen to us, as often as we attempt
anything contrary to the word of God. Our minds will fail at the very
first blast of temptation;  <span id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md)
since our only ground of stability is, to have the authority of God for
what we do. In the meantime, God purifies the faith of his servant from
its rust; for by mixing his own and his wife’s imagination with the word
of God, he, in a sense, had stifled his faith; wherefore, to restore its
brightness, that which was superfluous is cut of. God, by opposing
himself in this manner to our sinful designs, recalls us from our
stupidity to a sound mind. A simple promise had been given ‘I will bless
thy seed.’ Sarai’s gloss supervened,  <span
id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md) namely, that she could have no seed
but a supposititious one by Hagar: this mire of human imagination, with
which the promise had been defiled must be purged away, that Abram might
derive his knowledge from no other source, than the pure word of God.

<span id="xxii.i-p55"></span>*And* *Sarai* *dealt* *hardly* *with* *her*
 <span id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md) The word <span
id="xxii.i-p56.2"></span>הנע ( *anah* ,) which Moses uses, signifies to
afflict and to humble. I therefore explain it as being put for reducing
Hagar to submission. But it was difficult for an angry woman to keep
within bounds, in repressing the insolence of her maid. Wherefore, it is
possible that she became immoderately enraged against her; not so much
considering her own duty as revolving the means of being avenged for the
offenses committed. Since Moses brings no heavier charge, I confine
myself to what is certain; that Sarai made use of her proper authority
in restraining the insolence of her maid. And, doubtless, from the
event, we may form a judgments that Hagar was impelled to flee, not so
much by the cruelty of her mistress, as by her own contumacy. Her own
conscience accused her; and it is improbable that Sarai should have been
so greatly incensed, except by many, and, indeed atrocious offenses.
Therefore, the woman being of servile temper, and of indomitable
ferocity, chose rather to flee, than to return to favor, through the
humble acknowledgment of her fault.

<span id="xxii.i-p57"></span><span id="xxii.i-p57.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p58"></span>**7.** *And* *the* *angel* *of* *the*
*Lord* *found* *her* . We are here taught with what clemency the Lord
acts towards his own people, although they have deserved severe
punishment. As he had previously mitigated the punishment of Abram and
Sarai, so now he casts a paternal look upon Hagar, so that his favor is
extended to the whole family. He does not indeed altogether spare them,
lest he should cherish their vices; but he corrects them with gentle
remedies. It is indeed probable, that Hagar, in going to the desert of
Sur, meditated a return to her own country. Yet mention seems to be made
of the desert and the wilderness, to show that she, being miserably
afflicted, wandered from the presence of men, till the angel met her.
Although Moses does not describe the form of the vision, yet I do not
doubt, that it was clothed in a human body; in which, nevertheless,
manifest tokens of celestial glory were conspicuous.

<span id="xxii.i-p59"></span><span id="xxii.i-p59.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p60"></span>**8.** *And* *he* *said* *,* *Hagar* *,*
*Sarai’s* *maid* . By the use of this epithet, the angel declares, that
she still remained a servant, though she had escaped the hands of her
mistress; because liberty is not to be obtained by stealth, nor by
flight, but by manumission. Moreover, by this expression, God shows that
he approves of civil government, and that the violation of it is
inexcusable. The condition of servitude was then hard; and thanks are to
be given to the Lord, that this barbarity has been abolished; yet God
has declared from heaven his pleasure, that servants should bear the
yoke; as also by the mouth of Paul, he does not give servants their
freedom, nor deprive their masters of their use; but only commands them
to be kindly and liberally treated. (<span id="xxii.i-p60.1"></span>[Eph
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#005)<span id="xxii.i-p60.1"></span>..md)
It is to be inferred also, from the circumstance of the time, not only
that civil government is to be maintained, as matter of necessity, but
that lawful authorities are to be obeyed, for conscience’ sake. For
although the fugitive Hagar could no longer be compelled to obedience by
force, yet her condition was not changed in the sight of God. By the
same argument it is proved, that if masters at any time deal too hardly
with their servants, or if rulers treat their subjects with unjust
asperity, their rigour is still to be endured, nor is there just cause
for shaking off the yoke, although they may exercise their power too
imperiously. In short, whenever it comes into our mind to defraud any
one of his right, or to seek exemption from our proper calling, let the
voice of the angel sound in our ears, as if God would draw us back, by
putting his own hand upon us. They who have proudly and tyrannically
governed shall one day render their account to God; meanwhile, their
asperity is to be borne by their subjects, till God, whose prerogative
it is to raise the abject and to relieve the oppressed, shall give them
succor. If a comparison be made, the power of magistrates is far more
tolerable, than that ancient dominion was.  <span
id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md) The paternal authority is in its very
nature amiable, and worthy of regard. If the flight of Hagar was
prohibited by the command of God, much less will he bear with the
licentiousness of a people, who rebel against their prince; or with the
contumacy of children, who withdraw themselves from obedience to their
parents.

<span id="xxii.i-p62"></span>*Whence* *camest* *thou* *?* He does not
inquire, as concerning a doubtful matter, but knowing that no place for
subterfuge is left to Hagar, he peremptorily reproves her for her
flight; as if he had said, ‘Having deserted thy station, thou shalt
profit nothing by thy wandering, since thou canst not escape the hand of
God, which had placed thee there.’ It might also be, that he censured
her departure from that house, which was then the earthly sanctuary of
God. For she was not ignorant that God was there worshipped in a
peculiar manner. And although she indirectly charges her mistress with
cruelty, by saying that she had fled from her presence; still the angel,
to cut off all subterfuges, commands her to return and to humble
herself. By which words he first intimates, that the bond of subjection
is not dissolved either by the too austere, or by the impotent dominion
of rulers; he then retorts the blame of the evil upon Hagar herself,
because she had obstinately placed herself in opposition to her
mistress, and, forgetful of her own condition, had exalted herself more
insolently and boldly than became a handmaid. In short, as she is justly
punished for her faults, he commands her to seek a remedy by correcting
them. And truly, since nothing is better than, by obedience and
patience, to appease the severity of those who are in authority over us;
we must more especially labor to bend them to mildness by our
humiliation, when we have offended them by our pride.

<span id="xxii.i-p63"></span><span id="xxii.i-p63.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p64"></span>**10.** *I* *will* *multiply* *thy* *seed*
*exceedingly* For the purpose of mitigating the offense, and of
alleviating what was severe in the precept, by some consolation, he
promises a blessing in the child which she should bear. God might
indeed, by his own authority, have strictly enjoined what was right; but
in order that Hagar might the more cheerfully do what she knew to be her
duty, he allures her, as by blandishments, to obedience. And to this
point those promises tend, by which he invites us to voluntary
submission. For he would not draw us by servile methods, so that we
should obey his commands by constraint; and therefore he mingles mild
and paternal invitations with his commands, dealing with us liberally,
as with sons. That the angel here promises to do what is peculiar to God
alone, involves no absurdity, for it is sufficiently usual with God to
invest his ministers whom he sends with his own character, that the
authority of their word may appear the greater. I do not, however,
disapprove the opinion of most of the ancients; that Christ the Mediator
was always present in all the oracles, and that this is the cause why
the majesty of God is ascribed to angels.  <span
id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md) On which subject I have already
touched and shall have occasion to say more elsewhere.

<span id="xxii.i-p66"></span><span id="xxii.i-p66.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p67"></span>**11.** *And* *shalt* *bear* *a* *son* .
The angel explains what he had briefly said respecting her seed; namely,
that it should not be capable of being numbered on account of its
multitude; and he commences with Ishmael, who was to be its head and
origin. Although we shall afterwards see that he was a reprobate, yet an
honorable name is granted to him, to mark the temporal benefit of which
Ishmael became a partakers as being a son of Abram. For I thus explain
the passage, God intended that a monument of the paternal kindness, with
which he embraced the whole house of Abram, should endure to posterity.
For although the covenant of eternal life did not belong to Ishmael;
yet, that he might not be entirely without favor, God constituted him
the father of a great and famous people. And thus we see that, with
respect to this present life, the goodness of God extended itself to the
seed of Abram according to the flesh. But if God intended the name of
Ishmael (which signifies God will hear) to be a perpetual memorial of
his *temporal* benefits; he will by no means bear with our ingratitude,
if we do not celebrate his *celestial* and everlasting mercies, even
unto death.

<span id="xxii.i-p68"></span>*The* *Lord* *has* *heard* *thy*
*affliction* . We do not read that Hagar, in her difficulties, had
recourse to prayer; and we are rather left to conjecture, from the words
of Moses, that when she was stupefied by her sufferings, the angel came
of his own accord. It is therefore to be observed, that there are two
ways in which God looks down upon men, for the purpose of helping them;
either when they, as suppliants, implore his aid; or when he, even
unasked, succours them in their afflictions. He is indeed especially
said to hearken to them who, by prayers, invoke him as their Deliverer.
Yet, sometimes, when men lie mute, and because of their stupor, do not
direct their wishes to him, he is said to listen to their miseries. That
this latter mode of hearing was fulfilled towards Hagar, is probable,
because God freely met her wandering through the desert. Moreover,
because God frequently deprives unbelievers of his help, until they are
worn away with slow disease, or else suffers them to be suddenly
destroyed; let none of us give indulgence to our own sloth; but being
admonished by the sense of our evils, let us seek him without delay. In
the meantime, however, it is of no small avail to the confirmation of
our faith, that our prayers will never be despised by the Lord, seeing
that he anticipates even the slothful and the stupid, with his help; and
if he is present to those who seek him not, much more will he be
propitious to the pious desires of his own people.

<span id="xxii.i-p69"></span><span id="xxii.i-p69.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p70"></span>**12.** *And* *he* *will* *be* *a* *wild*
*man* . The angel declares what kind of person Ishmael will be. The
simple meaning is, (in my judgment,) that he will be a warlike man, and
so formidable to his enemies, that none shall injure him with impunity.
Some expound the word <span id="xxii.i-p70.1"></span>ארפ ( *pereh* ) to
mean a forester, and one addicted to the hunting of wild beasts. But the
explanation must not, it seems, be sought elsewhere than in the context;
for it follows immediately after, *‘His hand shall be against all men,
and the hand of all men against him.’* It is however asked, whether this
ought to be reckoned among benefits conferred by God, that he is to
preserve his rank in life by force of arms; seeing that nothing is, in
itself, more desirable than peace. The difficulty may be thus solved;
that Ishmael, although all his neighbors should make war upon him, and
should, on every side, conspire to destroy him; shall yet though alone,
be endued with sufficient power to repel all their attacks. I think,
however, that the angel, by no means, promises Ishmael complete favor,
but only that which is limited. Among our chief blessings, we must
desire to have peace with all men. Now, since this is denied to Ishmael,
that blessing which is next in order is granted to him; namely, that he
shall not be overcome by his enemies; but shall be brave and powerful to
resist their force. He does not, however, speak of Ishmael’s person, but
of his whole progeny; for what follows is not strictly suitable to one
man. Should this exposition be approved, no simple or unmixed blessing
is here promised; but only a tolerable or moderate condition; so that
Ishmael and his posterity might perceive that something was divinely
granted to them, for the sake of their father Abram. Therefore, it is,
by no means, to be reckoned among the benefits given by God, that he
shall have all around him as enemies, and shall resist them all by
violence: but this is added as a remedy and an alleviation of the evil;
that he, who would have many enemies, should be equal to bear up against
them.

<span id="xxii.i-p71"></span>*And* *he* *shall* *dwell* *in* *the*
*presence* *of* *all* *his* *brethren* . As this is properly applicable
only to a nation, we hence the more easily perceive, that they are
deceived who restrict the passage to the person of Ishmael. Again,
others understand, that the posterity of Ishmael was to have a fixed
habitation in the presence of their brethren, who would be unwilling to
allow it; as if it were said, that they should forcibly occupy the land
they inhabit, although their brethren might attempt to resist them.
Others adduce a contrary opinion; namely, that the Ishmaelites, though
living among a great number of enemies, should yet not be destitute of
friends and brethren. I approve, however, of neither opinion: for the
angel rather intimates, that this people should be separate from others;
as if he would say, ‘They shall not form a part or member of any one
nation; but shall be a complete body, having a distinct and special
name.’

<span id="xxii.i-p72"></span><span id="xxii.i-p72.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p73"></span>**13.** *And* *she* *called* *the* *name*
*of* *the* *Lord* . Moses, I have no doubt, implies that Hagar, after
she was admonished by the angel, changed her mind: and being thus
subdued, retook herself to prayer; unless, perhaps, here the confession
of the tongue, rather than change of mind, is denoted. I rather incline,
however, to the opinion, that Hagar, who had before been of a wild and
intractable temper, begins now at length to acknowledge the providence
of God. Moreover, as to that which some suppose; namely, that God is
called ‘the God of vision,  <span id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390.md)
because he appears and manifests himself to men, it is a forced
interpretation. Rather let us understand that Hagar, who before had
appeared to herself to be carried away by chance, through the desert;
now perceives and acknowledges that human affairs are under divine
government. And whoever is persuaded that he is looked upon by God, must
of necessity walk as in his sight.

<span id="xxii.i-p75"></span>*Have I also here seen after him that seeth
me* ?  <span id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md) Some translate this,
‘Have I not seen after the vision?’  <span
id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392.md) But it really is as I have rendered
it. Moreover, the obscurity of the sentence has procured for us various
interpretations. Some among the Hebrews say that Hagar was astonished at
the sight of the angel; because she thought that God was nowhere *seen*
but in the house of Abram. But this is frigid, and in this way the
ambition of the Jews often compels them to trifle; seeing that they
apply their whole study to boasting on the glory of their race. Others
so understand the passage, ‘Have I seen after my vision?’ that is, so
late, that during the vision I was blind?  <span
id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393.md) According to these interpreters, the
vision of Hagar was twofold: the former erroneous; since she perceived
nothing celestial in the angel; but the other true, after she had been
affected with a sense of the divine nature of the vision. To some it
seems that a negative answer is implied; as if she would say, I did not
see him departing; and then from his sudden disappearance, she collects
that he must have been an angel of God.

<span id="xxii.i-p79"></span>Also, on the second member of the sentence,
interpreters disagree. Jerome renders it, ‘the back parts of him that
seeth me:’  <span id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md) which many refer to
an obscure vision, so that the phrase is deemed metaphorical. For as we
do not plainly perceive men from behind; so they are said to see the
back parts of God, to whom he does not openly nor clearly manifest
himself; and this opinion is commonly received. Others think that Moses
used a different figure; for they take the seeing of the back parts of
God, for the sense of his anger; just as his face is said to shine upon
us, when he shows himself propitious and favorable. Therefore, according
to them, the sense is, ‘I thought that I had escaped, so that I should
no more be obnoxious to the rod or chastening of God; but here also I
perceive that he is angry with me.’ So far I have briefly related the
opinion of others.  <span id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md) And although
I have no intention to pause for the purpose of refuting each of these
expositions; I yet freely declare, that not one of these interpreters
has apprehended the meaning of Moses. I willingly accept what some
adduce, that Hagar wondered at the goodness of God, by whom she had been
regarded even in the desert: but this, though something, is not the
whole. In the first place, Hagar chides herself, because, as she had
before been too blind, she even now opened her eyes too slowly and
indolently to perceive God. For she aggravates the guilt of her torpor
by the circumstance both of place and time. She had frequently found, by
many proofs, that she was regarded by the Lord; yet becoming blind, she
had despised his providence, as if, with closed eyes, she had passed by
him when he presented himself before her. She now accuses herself for
not having more quickly awoke when the angel appeared. The consideration
of place is also of great weight,  <span
id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md) because God, who had always testified
that he was present with her in the house of Abram, now pursued her as a
fugitive, even into the desert. It implied, indeed, a base ingratitude
on her part, to be blind to the presence of God; so that even when she
knew he was looking upon her, she did not, in return, raise her eyes to
behold him. But it was a still more shameful blindness, that she, being
regarded by the Lord, although a wanderer and an exile, paying the just
penalty of her perverseness, still would not even acknowledge him as
present. We now see the point to which her self-reproach tends;
‘Hitherto I have not sought God, nor had respect to him, except by
constraint; whereas, he had before deigned to look down upon me: even
now in the desert, where being afflicted with evils, I ought immediately
to have roused myself, I have, according to my custom, been stupefied:
nor should I ever have raised my eyes towards heaven, unless I had first
been looked upon by the Lord.’

<span id="xxii.i-p83"></span><span id="xxii.i-p83.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p84"></span>**14.** *Wherefore the well was called*
 <span id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md) I subscribe to the opinion of
those who take the word <span id="xxii.i-p85.2"></span>ארקי ( *yekra* ,)
indefinitely, which is usual enough in the Hebrew language. In order
that the sense may be the clearer it is capable of being resolved into
the passive voice, that ‘the well was called.’  <span
id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md) Yet I think this common appellation
originated with Hagar, who, not content with one simple confession,
wished that the mercy of God should be attested in time to come; and
therefore she transmitted her testimony, as from hand to hand. Hence we
infer how useful it is, that they who do not freely humble themselves,
should be subdued by stripes. Hagar, who had always been wild and
rebellious, and who had, at length, entirely shaken off the yoke; now,
when the hardness of her heart was broken by afflictions, appears
altogether another person. She was not, however, reduced to order by
stripes only; but a celestial vision was also added, which thoroughly
arrested her. And the same thing is necessary for us; namely, that God,
while chastising us with his hand, should also bring us into a state of
submissive meekness by his Spirit. Some among the Hebrews say that the
name of the well was given to it, as being a testimony of a twofold
favor, because Ishmael was revived from death, and God had respect to
Hagar, his mother. But they foolishly mutilate things joined together:
for Hagar wished to testify that she had been favourably regarded by Him
who was the Living God, or the Author of life.

<span id="xxii.i-p87"></span><span id="xxii.i-p87.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p88"></span>**15.** *And Abram called* Hagar had been
commanded to give that name to her son; but Moses follows the order of
nature; because fathers, by the imposition of the name, declare the
power which they have over their sons. We may easily gather, that Hagar,
when she returned home, related the events which had occurred.
Therefore, Abram shows himself to be obedient and grateful to God:
because he both names his son according to the command of the angel, and
celebrates the goodness of God in having hearkened to the miseries of
Hagar.

Where stress is laid on the word here, as is done by Calvin, for the
