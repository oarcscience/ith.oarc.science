<span id="xvii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 11.

<span id="xvii.i"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p1"></span><span id="xvii.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
11:1-32](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001)<span id="xvii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And the whole earth was of one
language, and of one speech.

<span id="xvii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Erat autem universa terra labii
unius, et verborum eorundem.

<span id="xvii.i-p4"></span>**2.** And it came to pass, as they
journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar;
and they dwelt there.

<span id="xvii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et fuit, quum proficiscerentur ipsi
ab Oriente, invenerunt planitiem in terra Sinhar, et habitaverunt ibi.

<span id="xvii.i-p6"></span>**3.** And they said one to another, Go to,
let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for
stone, and slime had they for morter.

<span id="xvii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et dixerunt quisqui ad proximum suum,
Agite, laterificemus lateres, et coquamus ad coctionem: et fuit eis
later pro lapide, et bitumen fuit eis pro caemento.

<span id="xvii.i-p8"></span>**4.** And they said, Go to, let us build us
a city and a tower, whose top *may reach* unto heaven; and let us make
us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

<span id="xvii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et dixerunt, Agite, aedificemus nobis
urbem et turrim, cujus caput *pertingat usque* ad coelum, et faciamus
nobis nomen, ne forte dispergamur in superficiem universae terrae.

<span id="xvii.i-p10"></span>**5.** And the LORD came down to see the
city and the tower, which the children of men builded.

<span id="xvii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et descendit Jehova ut videret urbem
et turrim, quam aedificabant filii hominum.

<span id="xvii.i-p12"></span>**6.** And the LORD said, Behold, the
people *is* one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to
do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have
imagined to do.

<span id="xvii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et dixit Jehova, En, populus unus,
et labium unum *est* omnibus ipsis: et hoc *est* incipere eorum ut
faciant, et nunc non prohibebitur ab eis quod cogitaverunt ut facerent.

<span id="xvii.i-p14"></span>**7.** Go to, let us go down, and there
confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s
speech.

<span id="xvii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Agite, descendamus, et confundamus
ibi labium eorum, ut non audiant unusquisque labium proximi sui.

<span id="xvii.i-p16"></span>**8.** So the LORD scattered them abroad
from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build
the city.

<span id="xvii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et dispersit Jehova eos inde per
superficiem omnis terrae, et cessaverunt aedificare civitatem.

<span id="xvii.i-p18"></span>**9.** Therefore is the name of it called
Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the
earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of
all the earth.

<span id="xvii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Propterea vocavit nomen ejus Babel:
quia ibi confudit Jehova labium universae terrae, et inde dispersit eos
Jehova in superficiem universae terrae.

<span id="xvii.i-p20"></span>**10.** These *are* the generations of
Shem: Shem *was* an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years
after the flood:

<span id="xvii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Hae sunt generationes Sem. Sem
filius centum annorum genuit Arphachsad duobus annis post diluvium.

<span id="xvii.i-p22"></span>**11.** And Shem lived after he begat
Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.

<span id="xvii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Et vixit Sem, post quam genuit
Arphachsad, quingentos annos: et genuit filios et filias.

<span id="xvii.i-p24"></span>**12.** And Arphaxad lived five and thirty
years, and begat Salah:

<span id="xvii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et Arphachsad vixit quinque et
triginta annos, et genuit Selah.

<span id="xvii.i-p26"></span>**13.** And Arphaxad lived after he begat
Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.

<span id="xvii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Et vixit Arphachsad, postquam
genuit Selah, tres annos et quadringentos annos: et genuit filios et
filias.

<span id="xvii.i-p28"></span>**14.** And Salah lived thirty years, and
begat Eber:

<span id="xvii.i-p29"></span>**14.** Et Selah vixit triginta annos, et
genuit Eber.

<span id="xvii.i-p30"></span>**15.** And Salah lived after he begat Eber
four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.

<span id="xvii.i-p31"></span>**15.** Et vixit Selah, postquam genuit
Eber, tres annos et quadringentos annos: et genuit filios et filias.

<span id="xvii.i-p32"></span>**16.** And Eber lived four and thirty
years, and begat Peleg:

<span id="xvii.i-p33"></span>**16.** Et vixit Eber quatuor et triginta
annos, et genuit Peleg.

<span id="xvii.i-p34"></span>**17.** And Eber lived after he begat Peleg
four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.

<span id="xvii.i-p35"></span>**17.** Et vixit Eber, postquam genuit
Peleg, triginta annos et quadringentos annos: et genuit filios et
filias.

<span id="xvii.i-p36"></span>**18.** And Peleg lived thirty years, and
begat Reu:

<span id="xvii.i-p37"></span>**18.** Et vixit Peleg triginta annos, et
genuit Rehu.

<span id="xvii.i-p38"></span>**19.** And Peleg lived after he begat Reu
two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.

<span id="xvii.i-p39"></span>**19.** Et vixit Peleg, postquam genuit
Rehu, novem annos et ducentos annos: et genuit filios et filias.

<span id="xvii.i-p40"></span>**20.** And Reu lived two and thirty years,
and begat Serug:

<span id="xvii.i-p41"></span>**20.** Et vixit Rehu duos et triginta
annos, et genuit Serug.

<span id="xvii.i-p42"></span>**21.** And Reu lived after he begat Serug
two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.

<span id="xvii.i-p43"></span>**21.** Et vixit Rehu, postquam genuit
Serug, septem annos et ducentos annos: et genuit filios et filias.

<span id="xvii.i-p44"></span>**22.** And Serug lived thirty years, and
begat Nahor:

<span id="xvii.i-p45"></span>**22.** Et vixit Serug triginta annos, et
genuit Nachor.

<span id="xvii.i-p46"></span>**23.** And Serug lived after he begat
Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.

<span id="xvii.i-p47"></span>**23.** Et vixit Serug, postquam genuit
Nachor, ducentos annos: et genuit filios et filias.

<span id="xvii.i-p48"></span>**24.** And Nahor lived nine and twenty
years, and begat Terah:

<span id="xvii.i-p49"></span>**24.** Et vixit Nachor novem et viginti
annos, et genuit Thare.

<span id="xvii.i-p50"></span>**25.** And Nahor lived after he begat
Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.

<span id="xvii.i-p51"></span>**25.** Et vixit Nachor, postquam genuit
Thare, novemdecim annos et centum annos: et genuit filios et filias.

<span id="xvii.i-p52"></span>**26.** And Terah lived seventy years, and
begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

<span id="xvii.i-p53"></span>**26.** Et vixit Thare septuaginta annos,
et genuit Abram, Nachor, et Haran.

<span id="xvii.i-p54"></span>**27.** Now these *are* the generations of
Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

<span id="xvii.i-p55"></span>**27.** Et istae sunt generationes Thare.
Thare genuit Abram, Nachor, et Haran: et Haran genuit Lot.

<span id="xvii.i-p56"></span>**28.** And Haran died before his father
Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

<span id="xvii.i-p57"></span>**28.** Et mortuus est Haran coram Thare
patre suo in terra nativitatis suae, in Ur Chaldeae.

<span id="xvii.i-p58"></span>**29.** And Abram and Nahor took them
wives: the name of Abram’s wife *was* Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s
wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the
father of Iscah.

<span id="xvii.i-p59"></span>**29.** Et acceperunt Abram et Nachor
uxores: nomen uxoris Abram, Sarai: et nomen uxoris Nachor, Milchah,
filia Haran patris Milchah, et patris Ischah.

<span id="xvii.i-p60"></span>**30.** But Sarai was barren; she *had* no
child.

<span id="xvii.i-p61"></span>**30.** At fuit autem Sarai sterilis: nec
erat ei filius.

<span id="xvii.i-p62"></span>**31.** And Terah took Abram his son, and
Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his
son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,
to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt
there.

<span id="xvii.i-p63"></span>**31.** Tulit autem Thare Abram filium
suum, et Lot filium Haran, filium filii sui, et Sarai nurum suam, uxorem
Abram filii sui: et egressi sunt sum eis de Ur Chaldeae, ut pergerent in
terram Chenaan: et venerunt usque ad Charan, et habitaverunt ibi.

<span id="xvii.i-p64"></span>**32.** And the days of Terah were two
hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.

<span id="xvii.i-p65"></span>**32.** Et fuerunt dies Thare quinque et
ducenti anni: et mortuus est Thare in Charan.

<span id="xvii.i-p66"></span> 

<span id="xvii.i-p67"></span><span id="xvii.i-p67.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p68"></span>**1.** *And* *the* *whole* *earth* *was*
*of* *one* *language* . Whereas mention had before been made of Babylon
in a single word, Moses now more largely explains whence it derived its
name. For this is a truly memorable history, in which we may perceive
the greatness of men’s obstinacy against God, and the little profit they
receive from his judgments. And although at first sight the atrocity of
the evil does not appear; yet the punishment which follows it, testifies
how highly God was displeased with that which these men attempted. They
who conjecture that the tower was built with the intent that is should
prove a refuge and protections if, at any time, God should determine to
overwhelm the earth with a deluge, have no other guide, that I can see,
but the dream of their own brain. For the words of Moses signify no such
thing: nothing, indeed, is here noticed, except their mad ambitions and
proud contempt of God. ‘Let us build a tower (they say) whose top may
reach to heaven, and let us get ourselves a name.’ We see the design and
the aim of the undertaking. For whatsoever might happen, they wish to
have an immortal name on earth; and thus they build, as if in opposition
to the will of God. And doubtless ambition not only does injury to men,
but exalts itself even against God. To erect a citadel was not in itself
so great a crime; but to raise an eternal monument to themselves, which
might endure throughout all ages, was a proof of headstrong pride,
joined with contempt of God. And hence originated the fable of the
giants who, as the poets have feigned, heaped mountains upon mountains,
in order to drag down Jove from his celestial throne. This allegory is
not very remote from the impious counsel to which Moses alludes; for as
soon as mortals, forgetful of themselves; are inflated above measure, it
is certain that like the giants, they wage war with God. This they do
not openly profess, yet it cannot be otherwise than that every one who
transgresses his prescribed bounds, makes a direct attack upon God.

<span id="xvii.i-p69"></span>With respect to the time in which this
event happened, a fragment of Berosus is extant, (if, indeed, Berosus is
to be accounted the author of such trifles,) where, among other things,
a hundred and thirty years are reckoned from the deluge to the time when
they began to build the tower. This opinion, though deficient in
competent authority, has been preferred, by some, to that which commonly
obtained among the Jews, and which places about three hundred and forty
years between the deluge and the building of the tower. Nor is there
anything more plausible in what others relate; namely, that these
builders undertook the work, because men were even then dispersed far
and wide, and many colonies were already formed; whence they apprehended
that as their offspring was daily increasing, they must, in a short
time, migrate to a still greater distance. But to this argument we may
oppose the fact, that the peculiar blessing of God was to be traced in
this multiplication of mankind. Moreover, Moses seems to set aside all
controversy. For after he has mentioned Arphaxad as the third of the
sons of Shem, he then names Peleg, his great-grandson, in whose days the
languages were divided. But from a computation of the years which he
sets down, it plainly appears that one century only intervened. It is,
however, to be noted, that the languages are not said to have been
divided immediately after the birth of Peleg, and that no definite time
was ever specified.  <span id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320) It must,
indeed, have added greatly to the weight of Noah’s sufferings, when he
heard of this wicked counsel, which had been taken by his posterity. And
it is not to be doubted that he was wounded with the deepest grief, when
he beheld them, with devoted minds, rushing to their own destruction.
But the Lord thus exercised the holy man, even in extreme old age, to
teach us not to be discouraged by a continual succession of conflicts.
If any one should prefer the opinion commonly received among the Jews;
the division of the earth must be referred to the first transmigrations,
when men began to be distributed in various regions: but what has been
already recorded in the preceding chapter, respecting the monarchy of
Nimrod, is repugnant to this interpretation.  <span
id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321) Still a middle opinion may be
entertained; namely, that the confusion of tongues may perhaps have
happened in the extreme old age of Peleg. Now he lived nearly two
hundred and forty years; nor will it be absurd to suppose that the
empire founded by Nimrod endured two or three centuries. I certainly, —
as in a doubtful case, — freely admit that a longer space of time might
intervene between the deluge and the design of building the tower.
Moreover, when Moses says, ‘the earth was of one lip,’ he commends the
peculiar kindness of God, in having willed that the sacred bond of
society among men far separated from each other should be retained, by
their possessing a common language among themselves. And truly the
diversity of tongues is to be regarded as a prodigy. For since language
is the impress of the mind,  <span id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322) how
does it come to pass, that men, who are partakers of the same reason,
and who are born for social life, do not communicate with each other in
the same language? This defect, therefore, seeing that it is repugnant
to nature, Moses declares to be adventitious; and pronounces the
division of tongues to be a punishment, divinely inflicted upon men,
because they impiously conspired against God. Community of language
ought to have promoted among them consent in religion; but this
multitude of whom Moses speaks, after they had alienated themselves from
the pure worship of God, and the sacred assembly of the faithful,
coalesce to excite war against God. Therefore by the just vengeance of
God their tongues were divided.

<span id="xvii.i-p73"></span><span id="xvii.i-p73.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p74"></span>**2.** *They* *found* *a* *plain* *in*
*the* *land* *of* *Shinar* . It may be conjectured from these words,
that Moses speaks of Nimrod and of the people whom he had collected
around him. If, however, we grant that Nimrod was the chief leader in
the construction of so great a pile, for the purpose of erecting a
formidable monument of his tyranny: yet Moses expressly relates, that
the work was undertaken not by the counsel or the will of one man only,
but that all conspired together, so that the blame cannot be cast
exclusively upon one, nor even upon a few.

<span id="xvii.i-p75"></span><span id="xvii.i-p75.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p76"></span>**3.** *And* *they* *said* *one* *to*
*another*  <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323) That is, they
mutually exhorted each other; and not only did every man earnestly put
his own hand to the work, but impelled others also to the daring
attempt.

<span id="xvii.i-p78"></span>*Let* *us* *make* *brick* . Moses intimates
that they had not been induced to commence this work, on account of the
ease with which it could be accomplished nor on account of any other
advantages which presented themselves; he rather shows that they had
contended with great and arduous difficulties; by which means their
guilt became the more aggravated. For how is it that they harass and
wear themselves out in vain on a difficult and labourious enterprise,
unless that, like madmen, they rush impetuously against God? Difficulty
often deters us from necessary works; but these men, when they had
neither stones nor mortar, yet do not scruple to attempt the raising of
an edifice which may transcend the clouds. We are taught therefore, by
this example, to what length the lust of men will hurry them, when they
indulge their ambition. Even a profane poet is not silent on this
subject, —

<span id="xvii.i-p79"></span>*“Man, rashly daring, full of pride,  
Most covets what is most denied.”*  <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324) *  
And a little afterwards,* — *  
“Counts nothing arduous, and tries  
Insanely to possess the skies.”*  <span
id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325)

<span id="xvii.i-p84"></span><span id="xvii.i-p84.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p85"></span>**4.** *Whose* *top* *may* *reach* *unto*
*heaven* . This is an hyperbolical form of speech, in which they
boastingly extol the loftiness of the structure they are attempting to
raise. And to the same point belongs what they immediately subjoin, Let
us make us a name; for they intimate, that the work would be such as
should not only be looked upon by the beholders as a kind of miracle,
but should be celebrated everywhere to the utmost limits of the world.
This is the perpetual infatuation of the world; to neglect heaven, and
to seek immortality on earth, where every thing is fading and transient.
Therefore, their cares and pursuits tend to no other end than that of
acquiring for themselves a name on earth. David, in the forty ninth
psalm, deservedly holds up to ridicule this blind cupidity; and the
more, because experience (which is the teacher of the foolish) does not
restore posterity to a sound mind, though instructed by the example of
their ancestors; but the infatuation creeps on through all succeeding
ages. The saying of Juvenal is known, — ‘Death alone acknowledges how
insignificant are the bodies of men.’  <span
id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326) Yet even death does not correct our
pride, nor constrain us seriously to confess our miserable condition:
for often more pride is displayed in funerals than in nuptial pomp. By
such an example, however, we are admonished how fitting it is that we
should live and die humbly. And it is not the least important part of
true prudence, to have death before our eyes in the midst of life, for
the purpose of accustoming ourselves to moderation. For he who
vehemently desires to be great in the world, is first contumelious
towards men, and at length, his profane presumption breaks forth against
God himself; so that after the example of the giants, he fights against
heaven.

<span id="xvii.i-p88"></span>*Lest* *we* *be* *scattered* *abroad* .
Some interpreters translate the passage thus, ‘Before we are scattered:’
but the peculiarity of the language will not bear this explanation: for
the men are devising means to meet a danger which they believe to be
imminent; as if they would say, ‘It cannot be, that when our number
increases, this region should always hold all men; and therefore an
edifice must be erected by which their name shall be preserved in
perpetuity, although they should themselves be dispersed in different
regions.’ It is however asked, whence they derived the notion of their
future dispersion? Some conjecture that they were warned of it by Noah;
who, perceiving that the world had relapsed into its former crimes and
corruptions, foresaw, at the same time, by the prophetic spirit, some
terrible dispersion; and they think that the Babylonians, seeing they
could not directly resist God, endeavored, by indirect methods, to avert
the threatened judgment. Others suppose, that these men, by a secret
inspiration of the Spirit, uttered prophecies concerning their own
punishment, which they did not themselves understand. But these
expositions are constrained; nor is there any reason which requires us
to apply what they here say, to the curse which was inflicted upon them.
They knew that the earth was formed to be inhabited and would everywhere
supply its abundance for the sustenance of men; and the rapid
multiplication of mankind proved to them that it was not possible for
them long to remain shut up within their present narrow limits;
wherefore, to whatever other places it would be necessary for them to
migrate, they design this tower to remain as a witness of their origin.

<span id="xvii.i-p89"></span><span id="xvii.i-p89.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p90"></span>**5.** *And* *the* *Lord* *came* *down* .
The remaining part of the history now follows, in which Moses teaches us
with what ease the Lord could overturn their insane attempts, and
scatter abroad all their preparations. There is no doubt that they
strenuously set about what they had presumptuously devised. But Moses
first intimates that God, for a little while, seemed to take no notice
of them,  <span id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327) in order that suddenly
breaking off their work at its commencement, by the confusion of their
tongues, he might give the more decisive evidence of his judgment. For
he frequently bears with the wicked, to such an extent, that he not only
suffers them to contrive many nefarious things, as if he were
unconcerned, or were taking repose; but even further, their impious and
perverse designs with animating success, in order that he may at length
cast them down to a lower depth. The *descent* of God, which Moses here
records, is spoken of in reference to men rather than to God; who, as we
know, does not move from place to place. But he intimates that God
gradually and as with a tardy step, appeared in the character of an
Avenger. The Lord therefore descended that he might see; that is, he
evidently showed that he was not ignorant of the attempt which the
Babylonians were making.

<span id="xvii.i-p92"></span><span id="xvii.i-p92.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p93"></span>**6.** *Behold* *,* *the* *people* *is*
*one* . Some thus expound the words, that God complains of a wickedness
in men so refractory, that he excites himself by righteous grief to
execute vengeance; not that he is swayed by any passions,  <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328) but to teach us that he is not
negligent of human affairs, and that, as he watches for the salvation of
the faithful, so he is intent on observing the wickedness of the
ungodly; as it is said in <span id="xvii.i-p94.2"></span>[Ps
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016)<span id="xvii.i-p94.2"></span>,

<span id="xvii.i-p95"></span>“The face of the Lord is against them that
do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.”

<span id="xvii.i-p96"></span>Others think there is a comparison between
the less and the greater, no if it had been said, ‘They are hitherto few
and only use one language; what will they not dare, if, on account of
their multitude, they should become separated into various nations?’ But
there rather seems to me to be a suppressed irony, as if God would
propose to himself a difficult work in subduing their audacity: so that
the sense may be, ‘This people is compacted together in a firm
conspiracy, they communicate with each other in the same language, by
what method therefore can they be broken?’ Nevertheless, he ironically
smiles at their foolish and hasty confidence; because, while men are
calculating upon their own strength, there is nothing which they do not
arrogate to themselves.

<span id="xvii.i-p97"></span>*This* *they* *begin* *to* *do* . In saying
that they *begin* , he intimates that they make a diligent attempts
accompanied with violent fervor, in carrying on the work. Thus in the
way of concession, God declares, that supposing matters to be so
arranged, there would be no interruption of the building.

<span id="xvii.i-p98"></span><span id="xvii.i-p98.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p99"></span>**7.** *Go* *to* *,* *let* *us* *go* *down*
. We have said that Moses has represented the case to us by the figure
*hypotyposis* ,  <span id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329) that the
judgments of God may be the more clearly illustrated. For which reason,
he now introduces God as the speaker, who declares that the work which
they supposed could not be retarded, shall, without any difficulty, be
destroyed. The meaning of the words is of this kind, ‘I will not use
many instruments, I will only blow upon them, and they, through the
confusion of tongues, shall be contemptibly scattered. And as they,
having collected a numerous band, were contriving how they might reach
the clouds; so on the other hand, God summons his troops, by whose
interposition he may ward off their fury. It is, however, asked, what
troops he intends? The Jews think that he addresses himself to the
angels. But since no mention is made of the angels, and God places those
to whom he speaks in the same rank with himself, this exposition is
harsh, and deservedly rejected. This passage rather answers to the
former, which occurs in the account of man’s creation, when the Lord
said, “Let us make man after our image.” For God aptly and wisely
opposes his own eternal wisdom and power to this great multitude; as if
he had said, that he had no need of foreign auxiliaries, but possessed
within himself what would suffice for their destruction. Wherefore, this
passage is not improperly adduced in proof that Three Persons subsist in
One Essence of Deity. Moreover, this example of Divine vengeance belongs
to all ages: for men are always inflamed with the desire of daring to
attempt what is unlawful. And this history shows that God will ever be
adverse to such counsels and designs; so that we here behold, depicted
before our eyes what Solomon says:

<span id="xvii.i-p101"></span>‘There is no counsel, nor prudence, nor
strength against the Lord,’ (<span id="xvii.i-p101.1"></span>[Pr
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#030)<span
id="xvii.i-p101.1"></span>.)

<span id="xvii.i-p102"></span>Unless the blessing of God be present,
from which alone we may expect a prosperous issue, all that we attempt
will necessarily perish. Since, then, God declares that he is at
perpetual war with the unmeasured audacity of men; anything we undertake
without his approval will end miserably, even though all creatures above
and beneath should earnestly offer us their assistance. Now, although
the world bears this curse to the present day; yet, in the midst of
punishment, and of the most dreadful proofs of Divine anger against the
pride of men, the admirable goodness of God is rendered conspicuous,
because the nations hold mutual communication among themselves, though
in different languages; but especially because He has proclaimed one
gospel, in all languages, through the whole world, and has endued the
Apostles with the gift of tongues. Whence it has come to pass, that they
who before were miserably divided, have coalesced in the unity of the
faith. In this sense Isaiah says, that the language of Canaan should be
common to all under the reign of Christ, (<span
id="xvii.i-p102.1"></span>[Isa
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#018)<span
id="xvii.i-p102.1"></span>;) because, although their language may differ
in sound, they all speak the same thing, while they cry, Abba, Father.

<span id="xvii.i-p103"></span><span id="xvii.i-p103.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p104"></span>**8.** *So* *the* *Lord* *scattered*
*them* *abroad* . Men had already been spread abroad; and this ought not
to be regarded as a punishment, seeing it rather flowed from the
benediction and grace of God. But those whom the Lord had before
distributed with honor in various abodes, he now ignominiously scatters,
driving them hither and thither like the members of a lacerated body.
This, therefore, was not a simple dispersion for the replenishing of the
earth, that it might every where have cultivators and inhabitants; but a
violent rout, because the principal bond of conjunction between them
was, cut asunder.

<span id="xvii.i-p105"></span><span id="xvii.i-p105.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p106"></span>**9.** *Therefore* *is* *the* *name* *of*
*it* *called* *Babel* . Behold what they gained by their foolish
ambition to acquire a name! They hoped that an everlasting memorial of
their origin would be engraven on the tower; God not only frustrates
their vain expectation, but brands them with eternal disgrace, to render
them execrable to all posterity, on account of the great mischief
indicted on the human race, through their fault. They gain, indeed, a
name, but not each as they would have chosen: thus does God
opprobriously cast down the pride of those who usurp to themselves
honors to which they have no title. Here also is refuted the error of
those who deduce the origin of Babylon from Jupiter Belus.  <span

<span id="xvii.i-p108"></span><span id="xvii.i-p108.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p109"></span>**10.** *These* *are* *the* *generations*
*of* *Shem* . Concerning the progeny of Shem, Moses had said something
in the former chapter <span id="xvii.i-p109.1"></span>[Ge
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#001)<span id="xvii.i-p109.1"></span>:
but now he combines with the names of the men, the term of their several
lives, that we might not be ignorant of the age of the world. For unless
this brief description had been preserved, men at this day would not
have known how much time intervened between the deluge and the day in
which God made his covenant with Abraham. Moreover, it is to be
observed, that God reckons the years of the world from the progeny of
Shem, as a mark of honor: just as historians date their annals by the
names of kings or consuls. Nevertheless, he has granted this not so much
on account of the dignity and merits of the family of Shem, as on
account of his own gratuitous adoption; for (as we shall immediately
see) a great part of the posterity of Shem apostatized from the true
worship of God. For which reason, they deserved not only that God should
expunge them from his calendar, but should entirely take them out of the
world. But he too highly esteems that election of his, by which he
separated this family from all people, to suffer it to perish on account
of the sins of men. And therefore from the many sons of Shem he chooses
Arphaxad alone; and from the sons of Arphaxad, Selah alone; and from him
also, Eber alone; till he comes to Abram; the calling of whom ought to
be accounted the renovation of the Church. As it concerns the rest, it
is probable that before the century was completed, they fell into
impious superstitions. For when God brings it as a charge against the
Jews, that their fathers Terah and Nahor served strange gods, (<span
id="xvii.i-p109.2"></span>[Jos
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#002)<span id="xvii.i-p109.2"></span>,)
we must still remember, that the house of Shem, in which they were born,
was the peculiar sanctuary of God, where pure religion ought most to
have flourished; what then do we suppose, must have happened to others
who might seem, from the very first, to have been emancipated from this
service? Hence truly appears, not only the prodigious wickedness and
depravity, but also the inflexible hardness of the human mind. Noah and
his sons, who had been eye-witnesses of the deluge, were yet living: the
narration of that history ought to have inspired men with not less
terror than the visible appearance of God himself: from infancy they had
been imbued with those elements of religious instruction, which relate
to the manner in which God was to be worshipped, the reverence with
which his word was to be obeyed, and the severe vengeance which remains
for those who should violate the order prescribed by him: yet they could
not be restrained from being so corrupted by their vanity, that they
entirely apostatized. In the meantime, there is no doubt that holy Noah,
according to his extraordinary zeal and heroic fortitude, would contend
in every way for the maintenance of God’s glory: and that he sharply and
severely inveighed, yea, fulminated against the perfidious apostasy of
his descendants; and whereas all ought to have trembled at his very
look, they are yet moved by no chidings, however loud, from proceeding
in the course into which their own fury has hurried them. From this
mirror, rather than from the senseless flatteries of sophists, let us
learn how fruitful is the corruption of our nature. But if Noah and
Shem, and other such eminent teachers could not, by contending most
courageously, prevent the prevalence of impiety in the world; let us not
wonder, if at this day also, the unbridled lust of the world rushes to
impious and perverse modes of worship, against all the obstacles
interposed by sound doctrine, admonition, and threats. Here, however, we
must observe, in these holy men, how firm was the strength of their
faith, how indefatigable their patience, how persevering their
cultivation of piety; since they never gave way, on account of the many
occasions of offense with which they had to contend. Luther very
properly compares the incredible torments, by which they were
necessarily afflicted, to many martyrdoms. For such an alienation of
their descendants from God did not less affect their minds than if they
had seen their own bowels not only lacerated and torn, but cast into the
mire of Satan, and into hell itself. But while the world was thus filled
with ungodly men, God wonderfully retained a few under obedience to his
word, that he might preserve the Church from destruction. And although
we have said that the father and grandfather of Abraham were apostates,
and that, probably, the defection did not first begin with them; yet,
because the Church by the election of God, was included in that race,
and because God had some who worshipped him in purity, and who survived
even to the time of Abraham. Moses deduces a continuous line of descent,
and thus enroll them in the catalogue of saints. Whence we infer, (as I
have a little before observed,) in what high estimation God holds the
Church, which, though so small in numbers is yet preferred to the whole
world.

<span id="xvii.i-p110"></span>*Shem* *was* *an* *hundred* *years* *old*
. Since Moses has placed Arphaxad the third in order among the sons of
Shem, it is asked how this agrees with his having been born in the
second year after the deluge? The answer is easy. It cannot be exactly
ascertained, from the catalogues which Moses recites, at what time each
was born; because sometimes the priority of place is assigned to one,
who yet was posterior in the order of birth. Others answer, that there
is nothing absurd in supposing Moses to declare that, after the
completion of two years, a third son was born. But the solution I have
given is more genuine.

<span id="xvii.i-p111"></span><span id="xvii.i-p111.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p112"></span>**27.** *Terah* *begat* *Abram* . Here
also Abram is placed first among his brethren, not (as I suppose)
because he was the firstborn; but because Moses, intent on the scope of
his history, was not very careful in the arrangement of the sons of
Terah. It is also possible that he had other sons. For, the reason why
Moses speaks especially of them is obvious; namely, on account of Lot,
and of the wives of Isaac and Jacob. I will now briefly state why I
think Abram was not the first born. Moses shortly afterwards says, that
Haran died in his own country, before his father left Chaldea, and went
to Charran.  <span id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331) But Abram was
seventy-five years old when he departed from Charran to dwell in the
land of Canaan.  <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332) And this number
of seventy-five years is expressly given after the death of Terah. Now,
if we suppose that Abram was born in his father’s seventieth year, we
must also allow that we have lost sixty years of Terah’s age; which is
most absurd.  <span id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333) The conjecture of
Luther, that God buried that time in oblivion, in order to hide from us
the end of the world, in the first place is frivolous, and in the next,
may be refuted by solid and convincing arguments. Others violently wrest
the words to apply them to a former egress; and think that he lived
together with his father at Charran for sixty years; which is most
improbable. For to what end should they have protracted their stay so
long in the midst of their journey? But there is no need of labourious
discussion. Moses is silent respecting the age of Abraham when he left
his own country; but says, that in the seventy-fifth year of his age, he
came into the land of Canaan, when his father, having reached the two
hundredth and fifth year of his life, had died. Who will not hence infer
that he was born when his father had attained his one hundredth and
thirtieth year?  <span id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334) But he is named
first among those sons whom Terah is said to have begotten, when he
himself was seventy years old. I grant it; but this order of recital
does nothing towards proving the order of birth, as we have already
said. Nor, indeed, does Moses declare in what year of his life Terah
begat sons; but only that he had passed the above age before he begat
the three sons here mentioned. Therefore, the age of Abraham is to be
ascertained by another mode of computation, namely, from the fact that
Moses assigns to him the age of seventy-five when his father died, whose
life had reached to two hundred and five years. A firm and valid
argument is also deduced from the age of Sarai. It appears that she was
not more than ten years younger than Abraham. If she was the daughter of
his younger brother, she would necessarily have equalled her own father
in age.  <span id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335) They who raise an
objection, to the effect that she was the daughter-in-law, or only the
adopted daughter of Nahor, produce nothing beyond a sheer cavil.

<span id="xvii.i-p118"></span><span id="xvii.i-p118.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p119"></span>**28.** *And* *Haran* *died* . Haran is
said to have died before the face of his father; because he left his
father the survivor. It is also said that he died in his country, that
is, in Ur. The Jews turn the proper name into an appellative, and say
that he died in the *fire* . For, as they are bold in forging fables,
they pretend that he, with his brother Abram, were thrown by the
Chaldeans into the fire, because they shunned idolatry; but that Abram
escaped by the constancy of his faith. The twenty-fourth chapter of
Joshua (<span id="xvii.i-p119.1"></span>[Jos
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#001)<span id="xvii.i-p119.1"></span>,)
however, which I have cited above, openly declares, that this whole
family was not less infected with superstition than the country itself.
I confess, indeed, that the name Ur is derived from fire: names,
however, are wont to be assigned to cities, either from their situation,
or from some particular event. It is possible that they there cherished
the sacred fire, or that the splendor of the sun was more conspicuous
than in other places. Others will have it, that the city was so named,
because it was situated in a valley, for the Hebrews call valleys <span
id="xvii.i-p119.2"></span>םיורא ( *Uraim*  <span
id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336) ) But there is no reason why we should
be very anxious about such a matter: let it suffice, that Moses,
speaking of the country of Abram immediately afterwards declares it to
have been Ur of the Chaldeans.

<span id="xvii.i-p121"></span><span id="xvii.i-p121.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p122"></span>**30.** *But* *Sarai* *was* *barren* . Not
only does he say that Abram was without children, but he states the
reasons namely, the sterility of his wife; in order to show that it was
by nothing short of an extraordinary miracle that she afterwards bare
Isaac, as we shall declare more fully in its proper place. Thus was God
pleased to humble his servant; and we cannot doubt that Abram would
suffer severe pain through this privation. He sees the wicked springing
up everywhere, in great numbers, to cover the earth; he alone is
deprived of children. And although hitherto he was ignorant of his own
future vocation; yet God designed in his person, as in a mirror, to make
it evident, whence and in what manner his Church should arise; for at
that time it lay hid, as in a dry root under the earth.

<span id="xvii.i-p123"></span><span id="xvii.i-p123.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p124"></span>**31.** *And* *Terah* *took* *Abram* *his*
*son* . Here the next chapter ought to commence; because Moses begins to
treat of one of the principal subjects of his book; namely, the calling
of Abram. For he not only relates that Terah changed his country, but he
also explains the design and the end of his departure, that he left his
native soils and entered on his journey, in order to come to the land of
Canaan. Whence the inference is easily drawn, that he was not so much
the leader or author of the journey, as the companion of his son.

<span id="xvii.i-p125"></span>And it is no obstacle to this inference,
that Moses assigns the priority to Terah, as if Abram had departed under
his auspices and direction, rather than by the command of God: for this
is an honor conferred upon the father’s name. Nor do I doubt that Abram,
when he saw his father willingly obeying the calling of God, became in
return the more obedient to him. Therefore, it is ascribed to the
authority of the father, that he took his son with him. For, that Abram
had been called of God before he moved a foot from his native soil, will
presently appear too plain to be denied. We do not read that his father
had been called. It may therefore be conjectured, that the oracle of God
had been made known to Terah by the relation of his son. For the divine
command to Abram respecting his departure, did not prohibit him from
informing his father, that his only reason for leaving him was, that he
preferred the command of God to all human obligations. These two things,
indeed without controversy, we gather from the words of Moses; that
Abram was divinely called, before Terah left his own country: and that
Terah had no other design than that of coming into the land of Canaan;
that is, of joining his son as a voluntary companion. Therefore, I
conclude, that he had left his country a short time before his death.
For it is absurd to suppose, that when he departed from his own country,
to go directly to the land of Canaan, he should have remained sixty
years a stranger in a foreign land. It is more probable, that being an
old man worn out with years he was carried off by disease and weariness.
And yet it may be, that God held them a little while in suspense,
because Moses says he dwelt in Charran; but from what follows, it
appears that the delay was not long: since, in the seventy-fifth year of
his age, Abram departed thence; and he had gone thither already advanced
in age, and knowing that his wife was barren. Moreover, the town which
by the Hebrews is called Charran, is declared by all writers, with one
consent, to be Charran, situated in Mesopotamia; although Lucas,
poetically rather than truly, places it in Assyria. The place was
celebrated for the destruction of Crassus, and the overthrow of the
Roman army.  <span id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337)

<span id="xvii.i-p113"></span> There is evidently a mistake in the
original, as it appears in the Amsterdam edition of 1671, and in the

instead of Haran’s, thus, ‘<span id="xvii.i-p113.1"></span>Thare paulo

translation has kept the name, and made nonsense of the passage; but

<span id="xvii.i-p115"></span> Supposing Terah to be 70 years old at the
birth of Abram, and Abram 75 at the death of Terah; it would make Terah
145 years old when he died instead of 205, which is a loss of 60 years.
The inference, therefore, is that Abram was not the first-born of the
sons mentioned. See also Patrick’s Commentary, who says, that Terah “was
seventy years old before he had any children; and then had three sons
one after another, who are not set down in the order wherein they were
born. For Abraham’s being first named doth not prove him to have been
the eldest son of Terah, no more than Shem’s being first named among
Noah’s three sons proves him to have been the first-born. For there are
good reasons to prove that Abraham was born sixty years after Haran, who
was the eldest son; having two daughters married to his two brothers,
Nahor and Abraham; who seems to have been the youngest though named
first.” Le Clerc controverts this view, but it seems the most free from
objections. See, however, his Commentary on <span
