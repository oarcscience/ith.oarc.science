<span id="xxiv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 18.

<span id="xxiv.i"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p1"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
18:1-33](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001.md)<span id="xxiv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p2"></span>**1.** And the LORD appeared unto him in the
plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

<span id="xxiv.i-p3"></span>**1.** Deinde visus est illi Jehova in
Querceto Mamre, quum ipse sederet in ostio tabernaculi, quando
incalescebat dies.

<span id="xxiv.i-p4"></span>**2.** And he lift up his eyes and looked,
and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw *them* , he ran to meet
them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,

<span id="xxiv.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et elevavit oculos suos, et vidit, et
ecce tres virri stabant juxta eum: et vidit, et cucurrit in occursum
eorum ab ostio tabernaculi, et incurvavit se super terram.

<span id="xxiv.i-p6"></span>**3.** And said, My Lord, if now I have
found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

<span id="xxiv.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et dixit, Domine mi, si nunc inveni
gratiam in oculis tuis, ne nunc transeas a servo tuo.

<span id="xxiv.i-p8"></span>**4.** Let a little water, I pray you, be
fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

<span id="xxiv.i-p9"></span>**4.** Tollatur nunc parum aquae, et lavate
pedes vestros, et considite sub arbore.

<span id="xxiv.i-p10"></span>**5.** And I will fetch a morsel of bread,
and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore
are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

<span id="xxiv.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et capiam buccellam panis, et
fulcite cor vestrum, postea transibitis: quia idcirco transiistis ad
servum vestrum. Et dixerunt, Sicfacias quemadmodum loquutus es.

<span id="xxiv.i-p12"></span>**6.** And Abraham hastened into the tent
unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal,
knead *it* , and make cakes upon the hearth.

<span id="xxiv.i-p13"></span>**6.** Itaque festinavit Abraham ad
tabernaculum ad Sarah, et dixit, Festina, tria sata farinae similae
consperge, et fac subcinercios panes.

<span id="xxiv.i-p14"></span>**7.** And Abraham ran unto the herd, and
fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave *it* unto a young man; and he
hasted to dress it.

<span id="xxiv.i-p15"></span>**7.** Et ad boves cucurrit Abraham, et
tulit vitulum tenerum et bonum, et dedit puero, et festinavit ut paraet
eum.

<span id="xxiv.i-p16"></span>**8.** And he took butter, and milk, and
the calf which he had dressed, and set *it* before them; and he stood by
them under the tree, and they did eat.

<span id="xxiv.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et tulit butyrum, et lac, et vitulum
quem paraverat, et posuit ante eos: et ipse stabat juxta eos sub arbore,
et comederunt.

<span id="xxiv.i-p18"></span>**9.** And they said unto him, Where *is*
Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.

<span id="xxiv.i-p19"></span>**9.** Et dixerunt ad eum, Ubi est Sarah
uxor tua? Et dixit, Ecce, in tabernaculo.

<span id="xxiv.i-p20"></span>**10.** And he said, I will certainly
return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife
shall have a son. And Sarah heard *it* in the tent door, which *was*
behind him.

<span id="xxiv.i-p21"></span>**10.** Et dixit, Revertendo revertar ad to
secundum tempus vitae, et ecce, filius *erit* Sarah uxori tuae, Sarah
autem audiebat in ostio tabernaculi, quod erat post eum.

<span id="xxiv.i-p22"></span>**11.** Now Abraham and Sarah *were* old
*and* well stricken in age; *and* it ceased to be with Sarah after the
manner of women.

<span id="xxiv.i-p23"></span>**11.** Et Abraham et Sarah erant senes et
provectae aetatis, desieratque esse ipsi Sarah via secundum mulieres.

<span id="xxiv.i-p24"></span>**12.** Therefore Sarah laughed within
herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord
being old also?

<span id="xxiv.i-p25"></span>**12.** Risit ergo, Sarah intra sesse,
dicendo, Postquam senui, erit mihi voluptas? Et dominus meus senuit.

<span id="xxiv.i-p26"></span>**13.** And the LORD said unto Abraham,
Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child,
which am old?

<span id="xxiv.i-p27"></span>**13.** Et dixit Jehova ad Abraham, Utquid
risit Sarah dicendo, Num etiam vere pariam, et ego senui?

<span id="xxiv.i-p28"></span>**14.** Is any thing too hard for the LORD?
At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of
life, and Sarah shall have a son.

<span id="xxiv.i-p29"></span>**14.** Numquid abscondetur a Jehova
quicquam? ad tempus revertar ad to secundum tempus vitae, et ipse Sarah
erit filius.

<span id="xxiv.i-p30"></span>**15.** Then Sarah denied, saying, I
laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

<span id="xxiv.i-p31"></span>**15.** Et negavit Sarah, dicendo, Non
risi: quia timuit. Et dixit, Nequaquam, quia risisti.

<span id="xxiv.i-p32"></span>**16.** And the men rose up from thence,
and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the
way.

<span id="xxiv.i-p33"></span>**16.** Et surrexerunt inde viri, et
respexerunt contra faciem Sedom: et Abraham ibat cum eis, ut deduceret
eos.

<span id="xxiv.i-p34"></span>**17.** And the LORD said, Shall I hide
from Abraham that thing which I do;

<span id="xxiv.i-p35"></span>**17.** Tunc Jehova dixit, An ego celabo
Abraham quod ego facio?

<span id="xxiv.i-p36"></span>**18.** Seeing that Abraham shall surely
become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall
be blessed in him?

<span id="xxiv.i-p37"></span>**18.** Et Abraham erit in gentem magnum et
fortem, et benedicent sibi in eo omnes gentes terrae.

<span id="xxiv.i-p38"></span>**19.** For I know him, that he will
command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep
the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring
upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

<span id="xxiv.i-p39"></span>**19.** Quia novi eum: propterea praecipiet
filiis suis, et domui suae post se, et custodient viam Jehovae, ut
faciant justitiam et judicium, ut venire faciat Jehova super Abraham,
quod loquutus est super eum.

<span id="xxiv.i-p40"></span>**20.** And the LORD said, Because the cry
of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;

<span id="xxiv.i-p41"></span>**20.** Itaque dixit Jehova, Clamor Sedom
et Hamorah certe multiplicatus est, et peccatum eorum utique aggravatum
est valde.

<span id="xxiv.i-p42"></span>**21.** I will go down now, and see whether
they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto
me; and if not, I will know.

<span id="xxiv.i-p43"></span>**21.** Descendam nunc, et videbo an
secundum clamorem ejus, qui venit ad me, fecerint consummationem: et si
non, sciam.

<span id="xxiv.i-p44"></span>**22.** And the men turned their faces from
thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

<span id="xxiv.i-p45"></span>**22.** Et verterunt se inde viri, et
perrexerunt in Sedom: ipse vero Abraham adhuc stabat coram Jehova.

<span id="xxiv.i-p46"></span>**23.** And Abraham drew near, and said,
Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?

<span id="xxiv.i-p47"></span>**23.** Et accessit Abraham, et dixit,
Numquid etiam disperdes justum cum impio?

<span id="xxiv.i-p48"></span>**24.** Peradventure there be fifty
righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the
place for the fifty righteous that *are* therein?

<span id="xxiv.i-p49"></span>**24.** Si forte fuerint quinquaginta justi
intra civitatem numquid etiam disperdes, et non parces loco propter
quinquaginta justos, qui sunt intra eam?

<span id="xxiv.i-p50"></span>**25.** That be far from thee to do after
this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the
righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the
Judge of all the earth do right?

<span id="xxiv.i-p51"></span>**25.** Absit tibi ut facias secundum rem
hanc, ut mori facias justum cum impio, et sit justus sicut impius: absit
tibi, an qui judex est omnis terrae, non faciet judicium?

<span id="xxiv.i-p52"></span>**26.** And the LORD said, If I find in
Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place
for their sakes.

<span id="xxiv.i-p53"></span>**26.** Et dixit Jehova, Si invenero in
Sedom quinquaginta justos intra civitatem, parcam toti loco propter eos.

<span id="xxiv.i-p54"></span>**27.** And Abraham answered and said,
Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which *am but*
dust and ashes:

<span id="xxiv.i-p55"></span>**27.** Et repondit Abraham, et dixit,
Ecce, nunc coepi loqui ad Jehovam, et sum pulvis et cinis:

<span id="xxiv.i-p56"></span>**28.** Peradventure there shall lack five
of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for *lack of*
five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy
*it*

<span id="xxiv.i-p57"></span>**28.** Si forsitan defuerint de
quinquaginta justis quinque, numquid disperdes propter quinque totam
civitatem? Et dixit, Non disperdam, si invenero ibi quadraginta et
quinque.

<span id="xxiv.i-p58"></span>**29.** And he spake unto him yet again,
and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I
will not do *it* for forty’s sake.

<span id="xxiv.i-p59"></span>**29.** Et addidit adhuc ut loqueretur ad
eum, et dixit, Si forte inventi fuerint ibi quadraginta. Et dixit, Non
faciam propter quadraginta.

<span id="xxiv.i-p60"></span>**30.** And he said *unto him* , Oh let not
the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be
found there. And he said, I will not do *it* , if I find thirty there.

<span id="xxiv.i-p61"></span>**30.** Et dixit, Ne nunc sit ira Domino
meo, et loquar, Si forte inventi fuerint ibi triginta? Et dixit, Non
faciam, si invenero ibi triginta.

<span id="xxiv.i-p62"></span>**31.** And he said, Behold now, I have
taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty
found there. And he said, I will not destroy *it* for twenty’s sake.

<span id="xxiv.i-p63"></span>**31.** Et dixit, Ecce, nunc coepi loqui ad
Jehovam, Si forsitan inventi fuerint ibi viginti? Et dixit, Non
disperdam propter viginti.

<span id="xxiv.i-p64"></span>**32.** And he said, Oh let not the Lord be
angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be
found there. And he said, I will not destroy *it* for ten’s sake.

<span id="xxiv.i-p65"></span>**32.** Et dixit, Ne nunc sit ira Domino
meo, et loquar tantummodo semel, Si forsitan inventi fuerint ibi decem?
Et dixit, Non disperdam propter decem.

<span id="xxiv.i-p66"></span>**33.** And the LORD went his way, as soon
as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his
place.

<span id="xxiv.i-p67"></span>**33.** Et perrexit Jehova, quando finivit
loqui ad Abraham, et Abraham reversus est ad locum suum.

<span id="xxiv.i-p68"></span> 

<span id="xxiv.i-p69"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p69.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p70"></span>**1.** *And the Lord appeared unto him* It
is uncertain whether Moses says, that God afterwards appeared again unto
Abraham; or whether, reverting to the previous history, he here
introduces other circumstances, which he had not before mentioned. I
prefer, however, the former of these interpretations; namely, that God
confirmed the mind of his servant witha new vision; just as the faith of
the saints requires, at intervals, renewed assistance. It is also
possible that the promise was repeated for the sake of Sarah. What shall
we say, if in this manner, he chose to do honor to the greatness of his
grace? For the promise concerning Isaac, from whom, at length,
redemption and salvation should shine forth to the world, cannot be
extolled in terms adequate to its dignity. Whichever of these views be
taken, we perceive that there was sufficient reason why Isaac was again
promised. Concerning the word Mamre we have spoken in the thirteenth
chapter <span id="xxiv.i-p70.1"></span>[Ge
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#001.md)<span id="xxiv.i-p70.1"></span>.
Probably a grove of oaks was in that place, and Abraham dwelt there, on
account of the convenience of the situation.

<span id="xxiv.i-p71"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p71.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p72"></span>**2.** *And, lo, three men stood by him.*
Before Moses prceeds to his principal subject, he describes to us, the
hospitality of the holy man; and he calls the angels men, because, being
clothed with human bodies, they appeared to be nothing else than men.
And this was done designedly, in order that he, receiving them as men,
might give proof of his charity. For angels do not need those services
of ours, which are the true evidences of charity. Moreover, hospitality
holds the chief place among these services; because it is no common
virtue to assist strangers, from whom there is no hope of reward. For
men in general are wont, when they do favors to others, to look for a
return; but he who is kind to unknown guests and persons, proves himself
to be disinterestedly liberal. Wherefor the humanity of Abraham deserves
no slight praise; because he freely invites men who were to him unknown,
through whom he had no advantage, and from whom he had no hope of mutual
favors. What, therefore, was Abraham’s object? Truly, that he might
relieve the necessity of his guests. He sees them wearied with their
journey, and has no doubt that they are overcome by heat; he considers
that the time of day was becoming dangerous to travelers; and therefore
he wishes both to comfort, and to relieve persons thus oppressed. And
certainly, the sense of nature itself dictates, that the strangers are
to be especially assisted; unless blind self love rather impels us to
mercenary services. For none are more deserving of compassion and help
than those whom we see deprived of friends, and of domestic comforts.
And therefore the right of hospitality has been held most sacred among
all people, and no disgrace was ever more detestable than to be called
inhospitable. For it is a brutal cruelty, proudly to despise those who,
being destitute of ordinary, have recourse to our assistance. It is
however asked, whether Abraham was wont, thus to receive
indiscriminately all kinds of guests? I aanswer that, according to his
accustomed prudence, he made his distinction between his guests. And
truly, the invitation, which Moses here relates, has something uncommon.
Undoubtedly, the angels bore, in their countenance and manner, marks of
extraordinary dignity; so that Abraham would conclude them to be worthy
not only of meat and drink, but also of honor. They who think that he
was thus attentive to his office, because he had been taught, by his
fathers, that the angels often appeared in the world in human form,
reasons too philosophically. Even the authority of to Apostle is
contrary to this; for he denies that they were, at first, known to be
angels either by Abraham, or by Lot, since they thought they were
entertaining men. (<span id="xxiv.i-p72.1"></span>[Heb
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002)<span id="xxiv.i-p72.1"></span>.md)
This, then is to be maintained; that when he saw men of reverend aspect,
and having marks of singular excellence, advancing on their journey, he
saluted them with honor,and invited them to repose. But at that time,
there was greater honesty than is at present, to be found amid the
prevailing perfidy of mankind; so that the right of hospitality might be
exercised with less danger. Therefore, the great number of inns are
evidence of our depravity, and prove it to have arisen from our own
fault, that the principal duty of humanity has become obsolete among us.

<span id="xxiv.i-p73"></span>*And bowed himself toward the ground.* This
token of reverence was in common use with oriental nations. The mystery
which some of the ancient writers have endeavored to elicit from this
act; namely, that Abraham adored one out of the three, whom he saw, and,
therefore perceived by faith, that there are three persons in one God,
since it is frivolous, and obnoxious to ridicule and calumny, I am more
than content to omit. For we have before said, that the angels were so
received by the holy man, as by one who intended to discharge a duty
towards men. But the fact that God honored his benignity, and granted it
to him as a reward, that angels should be presented to him for guests,
was that he was not aware of, till they had made themselves known at the
conclusion of the meal. It was therefore a merely human and civil honor,
which he paid tem. As to his having saluted one in particular, it was
probably done becaus he excelled the other two. For we know that angels
often appeared with Christ their Head; here, therefore, among the three
angels, Moses points out one, asthe Chief of the embassy.

<span id="xxiv.i-p74"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p74.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p75"></span>**3.** *Pass not away, I pray thee, from
thy servant* In asking thus meekly, and even suppliantly, there is no
doubt that Abraham does it, moved by the reason which I have stated. For
if he had slaughtered calves for all kinds of travelers, his house would
soon have been emptied by his profuse expenditure. He, therefore, did
honor to their virtue and their excellent endowments, lest he should
pour contempt upon God. Thus, neither was he so liberal as to invite
wanderers, or other men of all kinds, who herd together; nor did
ambition induce him to deal thus bountifully with these three persons,
but rather his love and affection for those gifts of God, and those
virtues which appeared in them. As to his offering them simply a morsel
of bread, he makes light of an act of kindness which be was about to do,
not only for the sake of avoiding all boasting, but in order that they
might the more easily yield to his counsel and his entreaties, when they
were persuaded that they should not prove too burdensome and troublesome
to him. For modest persons do not willingly put others to expense or
trouble. The washing of feet, in that age, and in that region of the
world, was very common, perhaps, because persons traveled with naked
feet, under burning suns: and it was the great remedy for the
alleviation of weariness, to wash the feet parched with heat.

<span id="xxiv.i-p76"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p76.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p77"></span>**5.** *For therefore are ye come to your
servant* He does not mean that they had come designedly, or for the
express purpose of seeking to be entertained, as his guests; but he
intimates that their coming had occurred opportunely, as if he would
say, ‘You have not slipped into this place by chance; but have been led
hither by the design and the direction of God.’ He, therefore, refers it
to the providence of God, that they had come, so conveniently, to a
place where they might refresh themselves a little while, till the heat
of the sun should abate. Moreover, as it is certain that Abraham spoke
thus in sincerity of mind; let us after his examples conclude that,
whenever our brethren, who need our help, meet us, they are sent unto us
by God.

<span id="xxiv.i-p78"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p78.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p79"></span>**6.** *And Abraham hastened into the tent*
Abraham’s care in entertaining his guests is here recorded; and Moses,
at the same time, shows what a well-ordered house he had. In short, he
presents us, in a few words, with a beautiful picture of domestic
government. Abraham runs, partly, to command what he would have done;
and partly, to execute his own duty, as the master of the house. Sarah
keeps within the tent; not to indulge in sloth, but rather to take her
own part also, in the labor. The servants are all prompt to obey. Here
is the sweet concord of a well-conducted family; which could not have
thus suddenly arisen, unless each had, by long practice, been accustomed
to right discipline. A question, however; arises out of the assertion of
Moses, that the angels did eat. Some expound it, that they only appeared
as persons eating; which fancy enters their minds through the medium of
another error; since they imagine them to have been mere spectres, and
not endued with real bodies. But, in my judgment, the thing is far
otherwise. In the first place, this was no prophetical vision, in which
the images of absent things are brought before the eyes; but the angels
really came into the house of Abraham. Wherefore, I do not doubt that
God, — who created the whole world out of nothing, and who daily proves
himself to be a wonderful Artificer in forming creatures, — gave them
bodies, for a time, in which they might fulfill the office enjoined
them. And as they truly walked, spoke, and discharged other functions;
so I conclude, they did truly eat; not because they were hungry, but in
order to conceal themselves, until the proper time for making themselves
known. Yet as God speedily annihilated those bodies, which had been
created for a temporary use; so there will be no absurdity in saying,
that the food itself was destroyed, together with their bodies. But, as
it is profitable briefly to touch upon such questions; and, as religion
in no way forbids us to do so; there is on the other hand, nothing
better than that we should content ourselves with a sober solution of
them.

<span id="xxiv.i-p80"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p80.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p81"></span>**9.** *Where is Sarah?* Hitherto God
permitted Abraham to discharge an obvious duty. But, having given him
the opportunity of exercising charity, God now begins to manifest
himself in his angels. The reason why Moses introduces, at one time,
three speakers, while, at another, he ascribes speech to one only, is,
that the three together represent the person of one God. We must also
remember what I have lately adduced, that the principal place is given
to one; because Christ, who is the living image of the Father, often
appeared to the fathers under the form of an angel, while, at the same
time, he yet had angels, of whom he was the Head, for his attendants.
And as to their making inquiry respecting Sarah; we may hence infer,
that a son is again here promised to Abraham, because she had not been
present at the former oracle.

<span id="xxiv.i-p82"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p82.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p83"></span>**10.** *I will certainly return unto thee*
Jerome translates its ‘I will return, life attending me:’  <span
id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) as if God, speaking in the manner of
men, had said, ‘I will return if I live.’ But it would be absurd, that
God, who here so magnificently proclaims his power, should borrow from
man a form of speech which would suppose him to be mortal. What majesty,
I pray, would this remarkable oracle possess, which treats of the
eternal salvation of the world? That interpretation, therefore, can by
no means be approved, which entirely enervates the force and authority
of the promise. Literally it is, according to the time of life. Which
some expound of Sarah; as if the angel had said, Sarah shall survive to
that period. But it is more properly explained of the child; for God
promises that He will come, at the just and proper time of bringing
forth, that Sarah might become the mother of a living child.

<span id="xxiv.i-p85"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p85.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p86"></span>**11.** *Were old, and well stricken in
age* Moses inserts this verse to inform us that what the angel was
saying, justly appeared improbable to Sarah. For it is contrary to
nature that children should be promised to decrepit old men. A doubt,
however, may be entertained on this point, respecting Abraham: because
men are sometimes endued with strength to have children, even in extreme
old age: and especially in that period, such an occurrence was not
uncommon. But Moses here speaks comparatively: for since Abraham, during
the vigor of his life, had remained with his wife childless; it was
scarcely possible for him, now that his body was half dead, to have
children; he had indeed begotten Ishmael in his old age, which was
contrary to expectation. But that now, twelve years afterwards, it
should be possible to become a father, through his aged wife,  <span
id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md) was scarcely credible. Moses however
chiefly insists upon the case of Sarah; because the greatest impediment
was with her. It ceased, he says, to be with Sarah after the manner of
women.  <span id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md) With this expression, he
soberly speaks about the monthly stream of the women. At the same moment
with this, the possibility of conceiving ceases.

<span id="xxiv.i-p89"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p89.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p90"></span>**12.** *Therefore Sarah laughed within
herself* Abraham had laughed before, as appears in the preceding chapter
<span id="xxiv.i-p90.1"></span>[Ge
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#001.md)<span id="xxiv.i-p90.1"></span>:
but the laughter of both was, by no means, similar. For Sarah is not
transported with admiration and joy, on receiving the promise of God;
but foolishly sets her own age and that of her husband in opposition to
the word of God; that she may withhold confidence from God, when he
speaks. Yet she does not, avowedly, charge God with falsehood or vanity;
but because, having her mind fixed on the contemplation of the thing
proposed, she only weighs what might be accomplished by natural means,
without raising her thoughts to the consideration of the power of God,
and thus rashly casts discredit on God who speaks to her. Thus, as often
as we measure the promises and the works of God, by our own reason, and
by the laws of nature, we act reproachfully towards him, though we may
intend nothing of the sort. For we do not pay him his due honor, except
we regard every obstacle which presents itself in heaven and on earth,
as placed under subjection to his word. But although the incredulity of
Sarah is not to be excused; she, nevertheless, does not directly reject
the favor of God; but is only so kept back by shame and modesty, that
she does not altogether believe what she hears. Even her very words
declare the greatest modesty; ‘After we are grown old shall we give
ourselves up to lust?’ Wherefore, let us observe, that nothing was less
in Sarah’s mind, than to make God a liar. But herein consisted in this
alone, that, having fixed her thoughts too much on the accustomed order
of nature, she did not give glory to God, by expecting from him a
miracle which she was unable to conceive in her mind. We must here
notice the admonition which the Apostle gathers from this passage,
because Sarah here calls Abraham her *lord* . (<span
id="xxiv.i-p90.2"></span>[1Pe 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#006.md)<span
id="xxiv.i-p90.2"></span>.) For he exhorts women, after her example, to
be obedient and well-behaved towards their own husbands. Many women,
indeed, without difficulty, give their husbands this title, when yet
they do not scruple to bring them under rule, by their imperious pride:
but the Apostle takes it for granted that Sarah testifies, from her
heart, what she feels, respecting her husband: nor is it doubtful that
she gave proof, by actual services, of the modesty which she had
professed in words.

<span id="xxiv.i-p91"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p91.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p92"></span>**13.** *And the Lord said* . Because the
majesty of God had now been manifested in the angels, Moses expressly
mentions his Name. We have before declared, in what sense the name of
God is transferred to the angel; it is not, therefore, now necessary to
repeat it: except, as it is always important to remark, that the word of
the Lord is so precious to himself, that he would be regarded by us as
present, whenever he speaks through his ministers. Again, whenever he
manifested himself to the fathers, Christ was the Mediator between him
and them; who not only personates God in proclaiming his word, but is
also truly and essentially God. And because the laughter of Sarah had
not been detected by the eye of man, therefore Moses expressly declares
that she was reprehended by God. And to this point belong the following
circumstances, that the angel had his back turned to the tent, and that
Sarah laughed within herself, and not before others. The censure also
shows that the laughter of Sarah was joined with incredulity. For there
is no little weight in this sentence, ‘Can anything be wonderful with
God?’ But the angel chides Sarah, because she limited the power of God
within the bounds of her own sense. An antithesis is therefore implied
between the immense power of God, and the contracted measure which Sarah
imagined to herself, through her carnal reason. Some translate the word
<span id="xxiv.i-p92.1"></span>אלפ ( *pala* ,) *hidden* , as if the
angel meant that nothing was hidden from God: but the sense is
different; namely, that the power of God ought not to be estimated by
human reason.  <span id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) It is not
surprising, that in arduous affairs *we* fail, or that *we* succumb to
difficulties: but God’s way is far otherwise, for he looks down with
contempt, from above, upon those things which alarm us by their lofty
elevation. We now see what was the sin of Sarah; namely, that she did
wrong to God, by not acknowledging the greatness of his power. And
truly, we also attempt to rob God of his power, whenever we distrust his
word. At the first sight, Paul seems to give cold praise to the faith of
Abraham, in saying, that he did not consider his body, now dead, but
gave glory to God, because he was persuaded that he could fulfill what
he had promised. (<span id="xxiv.i-p93.1"></span>[Ro
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019)<span id="xxiv.i-p93.1"></span>..md)
But if we thoroughly investigate the source of distrust, we shall find
that the reason why we doubt of God’s promises is, because we sinfully
detract from his power. For as soon as any extraordinary difficulty
occurs, then, whatever God has promised, seems to us fabulous; yea, the
moment he speaks, the perverse thought insinuates itself, How will he
fulfill what he promises? Being bound down, and preoccupied by such
narrow thoughts, we exclude his power, the knowledge of which is better
to us than a thousand worlds. In short, he who does not expect more from
God than he is able to comprehend in the scanty measure of his own
reason, does him grievous wrong. Meanwhile, the *word* of the Lord ought
to be inseparably joined with his power; for nothing is more
preposterous, than to inquire what God *can* do, to the setting aside of
his *declared* will. In this way the Papists plunge themselves into a
profound labyrinth, when they dispute concerning the absolute power of
God. Therefore, unless we are willing to be involved in absurd dotings,
it is necessary that the word should precede us like a lamp; so that his
power and his will may be conjoined by an inseparable bond. This rule
the Apostle prescribes to us, when he says,

<span id="xxiv.i-p94"></span>‘Being certainly persuaded, that what he
has promised,  
he is able to perform,’ (<span id="xxiv.i-p94.2"></span>[Ro
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021)<span id="xxiv.i-p94.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xxiv.i-p95"></span>The angel again repeats the promise that he
would come ‘according to the time of life,’ that is, in the revolving of
the year, when the full time of bringing forth should have arrived.

<span id="xxiv.i-p96"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p96.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p97"></span>**15.** *Then Sarah denied* . Another sin
of Sarah’s was, that she endeavored to cover and hide her laughter by a
falsehood. Yet this excuse did not proceed from obstinate wickedness,
according to the manner in which hypocrites are wont to snatch at
subterfuges, so that they remain like themselves, even to the end.
Sarah’s feelings were of a different kind; for while she repents of her
own folly, she is yet so terrified, as to deny that she had done, what
she now perceives to be displeasing to God. Whence we infer, how great
is the corruption of our nature, which causes even the fear of God, —
the highest of all virtues, — to degenerate into a fault. Moreover, we
must observe whence that fear, of which Moses makes mention, suddenly
entered the mind of Sarah; namely, from the consideration that God had
detected her secret sin. We see, therefore, how the majesty of God, when
it is seriously felt by us, shakes us out of our insensibility. We are
more especially constrained to feel thus, when God ascends his tribunal,
and brings our sins to light.

<span id="xxiv.i-p98"></span>*Nay; but thou didst laugh* . The angel
does not contend in a multiplicity of words, but directly refutes her
false denial of the fact. We may hence learn, that we gain no advantage
by tergiversation, when the Lord reproves us, because he will
immediately dispatch our case with a single word. Therefore, we must
beware lest we imitate the petulance of those who mock God with false
pretences, and at length rush into gross contempt of Him. However he may
seem to leave us unnoticed for a time, yet he will fulminate against us
with that terrible voice, ‘It is not as you pretend.’ In short, it is
not enough that the judgment of God should be reverenced, unless we also
confess our sins ingenuously and without shifts or evasions. For a
double condemnation awaits those who, from a desire to escape the
judgment of God, retake themselves to the refuge of dissimulation. We
must, therefore bring a sincere confession, that, as persons openly
condemned, we may obtain pardon. But seeing that God was contented with
giving a friendly reprehension, and that he did not more severely punish
the double offense of Sarah; we hence perceive with what tender
indulgence he sometimes regards his own people. Zacharias was more
severely treated, who was struck dumb for nine months. (<span
id="xxiv.i-p98.1"></span>[Lu 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009.md)<span
id="xxiv.i-p98.1"></span>.) But it is not for us to prescribe a
perpetual law to God; who, as he generally binds his own people to
repentance by punishments, often sees it good to humble them
sufficiently, without inflicting any chastisement. In Sarah, truly, he
gives a singular instance of his compassion; because he freely forgives
her all, and still chooses that she should remain the mother of the
Church. In the meantime, we must observe, how much better it is that we
should be brought before him as guilty, and that like convicted persons
we should be silent, than that we should delight ourselves in sin, as a
great part of the world is accustomed to do.

<span id="xxiv.i-p99"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p99.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p100"></span>**16.** *And the men rose up from thence*
. Moses again calls those men, whom he had openly declared to be
*angels* . But he gives them the name from the form which they had
assumed. We are not, however, to suppose that they were surrounded with
human bodies, in the same manner in which Christ clothed himself in our
nature, together with our flesh; but God invested them with temporary
bodies, in which they might be visible to Abraham, and might speak
familiarly with him. Abraham is said to have brought them on the way;
not for the sake of performing an office of humanity, as when he had
received them at first, but in order to render due honor to the angels.
For frivolous is the opinion of some who imagine that they were believed
to be prophets, who had been banished, on account of the word. He well
knew that they were angels as we shall soon see more clearly. But he
follows those in the way, whom he did not dare to detain.

<span id="xxiv.i-p101"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p101.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p102"></span>**17.** *Shall I hide from Abraham?*
Seeing that God here takes counsel, as if concerning a doubtful matter,
he does it for the sake of men; for he had already determined what he
would do. But he designed, in this manner, to render Abraham more intent
upon the consideration of the causes of Sodom’s destruction. He adduces
two reasons why He wished to manifest his design to Abraham, before he
carried it into execution. The former is, that he had already granted
him a singularly honorable privilege; the second, that it would be
useful and fruitful in the instruction of posterity. Therefore, in this
expression, the scope and use of revelation is briefly noted.

<span id="xxiv.i-p103"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p103.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p104"></span>**18.** *Seeing that Abraham shall surely
become a great and mighty nation* . In Hebrew it is, ‘And being, he
shall be,’ etc. But the copulative ought to be resolved into the causal
adverb.  <span id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) For this is the reasons
to which we have already alluded, why God chose to inform his servant of
the terrible vengeance He was about to take upon the men of Sodom;
namely, that He had adorned him, above all others, with peculiar gifts.
For, in this way, God continues his acts of kindness towards the
faithful, yea, even increases them, and gradually heaps new favors upon
those before granted. And he daily deals with us in the same manner. For
what is the reason why he pours innumerable benefits upon us, in
constant succession, unless that, having once embraced us with paternal
love, he cannot deny himself? And, therefore, in a certain way, he
honors himself and his gifts in us. For what does he here commemorate,
except his own gratuitous gifts? Therefore, he traces the cause of his
beneficence to himself, and not to the merits of Abraham; for the
blessing of Abraham flowed from no other source than the Divine
Fountain. And we learn from the passage, what experience also teaches,
that it is the peculiar privilege of the Church, to know what the Divine
judgments mean, and what is their tendency. When God inflicts punishment
upon the wicked, he openly proves that he is indeed the Judge of the
world; but because all things seem to happen by chance, the Lord
illuminates his own children by his word, lest they should become blind,
with the unbelievers. So formerly, when he stretched forth his hand over
all regions of the world, he yet confined his sacred word within Judea;
that is, when he smote all nations with slaughter and with adversity, he
yet taught his only elect people, by his word through the prophets, that
he was the Author of these punishments; yea, he predicted beforehand
that they would take place; as it is written in Amos, (<span
id="xxiv.i-p105.3"></span>[Am 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#007.md)<span
id="xxiv.i-p105.3"></span>,)

<span id="xxiv.i-p106"></span>‘Shall there be anything which the Lord
will hide  
from his servants the prophets?’

<span id="xxiv.i-p107"></span>Let us therefore remember, that from the
time when God begins to be kind towards us, he is never weary, until, by
adding one favor to another, he completes our salvation. Then, after he
has once adopted us, and has shone into our minds by his word, he holds
the torch of the same word burning before our eyes, that we may, by
faith, consider those judgments and punishments of iniquity which the
impious carelessly neglect. Thus it becomes the faithful to be employed
in reflecting on the histories of all times, that they may always form
their judgment from the Scripture, of the various destructions which,
privately and publicly, have befallen the ungodly. But it is asked; was
it necessary that the destruction of Sodom should be explained to
Abraham, before it happened? I answer, since we are so dull in
considering the works of God, this revelation was by no means
superfluous. Although the Lord proclaims aloud that adversity is the rod
of his anger; scarcely any one hearkens to it, because, through the
depraved imaginations of our flesh, we ascribe the suffering to some
other cause. But the admonition, which precedes the event, does not
suffer us to be thus torpid, nor to imagine that fortune, or any thing
else which we may fancy, stands in the place of God’s word. Thus it
necessarily happened, in former times, that the people, although
iron-hearted, were more affected by these predictions than they would
have been had they been admonished by the prophets, after they had
received punishment. Wherefore, from them, it will be proper for us to
assume a general rule, in order that the judgments of God, which we
daily perceive, may not be unprofitable to us.

<span id="xxiv.i-p108"></span>The Lord declares to his servant Abraham
that Sodom was about to perish, while it was yet entire, and in the full
enjoyment of its pleasures. Hence no doubt remains, that it did not
perish by chance, but was subjected to divine punishment. Hence also,
when the cause of the punishment is thus declared beforehand, it will
necessarily far more effectually pierce and stimulate the minds of men.
We must afterwards come to the same conclusion, concerning other things;
for although God does not declare to us, what he is about to do, yet he
intends us to be eyewitnesses of his works and prudently to weigh their
causes, and not to be dazzled by a confused beholding of them, like
unbelievers, ‘who seeing, see not,’ and who pervert their true design.

<span id="xxiv.i-p109"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p109.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p110"></span>**19.** *For I know him, that he will
command his children* . The second reason why God chooses to make
Abraham a partaker of his counsel is, because he foresees that this
would not be done in vain, and without profit. And the simple meaning of
the passage is, that Abraham is admitted to the counsel of God, because
he would faithfully fulfill the office of a good householder, in
instructing his own family. Hence we infer, that Abraham was informed of
the destruction of Sodom, not for his own sake alone, but for the
benefit of his race. Which is carefully to be observed; for this
sentence is to the same effect, as if God, in the person of Abraham,
addressed all his posterity. And truly, God does not make known his will
to us, that the knowledge of it may perish with us; but that we may be
his witnesses to posterity and that they may deliver the knowledge
received through us, from hand to hand, (as we say,) to their
descendants. Wherefore, it is the duty of parents to apply themselves
diligently to the work of communicating what they have learned from the
Lord to their children. In this manner the truth of God is to be
propagated by us, so that no one may retain his knowledge for his own
private use; but that each may edify others, according to his own
calling, and to the measure of his faith. There is however no doubt,
that the gross ignorance which reigns in the world, is the just
punishment of men’s idleness. For whereas the greater part close their
eyes to the offered light of heavenly doctrine; yet there are those who
stifle it, by not taking care to transmit it to their children. The Lord
therefore righteously takes away the precious treasure of his word, to
punish the world for its sloth. The expression after him is also to be
noticed; by which we are taught that we must not only take care of our
families, to govern them duly, while we live; but that we must give
diligence, in order that the truth of God, which is eternal, may live
and flourish after our death; and that thus, when we are dead, a holy
course of living may survive and remain. Moreover, we hence infer, that
those narratives which serve to inspire terror, are useful to be known.
For our carnal security requires sharp stimulants whereby we may be
urged to the fear of God. And lest any one should suppose that this kind
of doctrine belongs only to strangers, the Lord specially appoints it
for the sons of Abraham, that is, for the household of the Church. For
those interpreters are infatuated and perverse, who contend that faith
is overturned if consciences are alarmed. For whereas nothing is more
contrary to faith than contempt and torpor; that doctrine best accords
with the preaching of grace, which so subdues men to the fear of God,
that they, being afflicted and famishing, may hasten unto Christ.

<span id="xxiv.i-p111"></span>*And they shall keep the way of the Lord*
. Moses intimates, in these words, that the judgment of God is proposed,
not only in order that they who, by negligence, please themselves in
their vices, may be taught to fear, and that being thus constrained,
they may sigh for the grace of Christ; but also to the end that the
faithful themselves, who are already endued with the fear of God, may
advance more and more in the pursuit of piety. For he wills that the
destruction of Sodom should be recorded, both that the wicked may be
drawn to God, by the fear of the same vengeance, and that they who have
already begun to worship God, may be better formed to true obedience.
Thus the Law avails, not only for the beginning of repentance, but also
for our continual progress. When Moses adds, to do justice and judgment,
he briefly shows the nature of the way of the Lord, which he had before
mentioned. This, however, is not a complete definition; but from the
duties of the Second Table, he briefly shows, by the figure *synecdoche*
, what God chiefly requires of us. And it is not unusual in Scripture,
to seek a description of a pious and holy life, from the Second Table of
the Law; not because charity is of more account than the worship of God,
but because they who live uprightly and innocently with their neighbors,
give evidence of their piety towards God. In the names of justice and
judgment he comprehends that equity, by which to every one is given what
is his own. If we would make a distinction, *justice* is the name given
to the rectitude and humanity which we cultivate with our brethren, when
we endeavor to do good to all, and when we abstain from all wrong,
fraud, and violence. But *judgment* is to stretch forth the hand to the
miserable and the oppressed, to vindicate righteous causes, and to guard
the weak from being unjustly injured. These are the lawful exercises in
which the Lord commands his people to be employed.

<span id="xxiv.i-p112"></span>*That the Lord may bring upon Abraham that
which he hath spoken of him* . Moses intimates that Abraham should
become possessed of the grace promised to him, if he instructed his
children in the fear of the Lord, and governed his household well. But
under the person of one man, a rule common to all the pious is
delivered: for they who are negligent in this part of their duty, cast
off or suppress, as much as in them lies, the grace of God. Therefore,
that the perpetual possession of the gifts of God may remain to us, and
survive to posterity, we must beware lest they be lost through our
neglect. Yet it would be false for any one hence to infer, that the
faithful could either cause or deserve, by their own diligence, that God
should fulfill those things which he has promised. For it is an
accustomed method of speaking in Scripture, to denote by the word *that*
the consequence rather than the cause. For although the grace of God
alone begins and completes our salvation; yet, since by obeying the call
of God, we fulfill our course, we are said, also in this manner, to
obtain the salvation promised by God.

<span id="xxiv.i-p113"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p113.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p114"></span>**20.** *The cry of Sodom* . The Lord here
begins more clearly to explain to Abraham his counsel concerning the
destruction of the five cities; although he only names Sodom and
Gomorrah, which were much more famous than the rest. But before he makes
mention of punishment, he brings forward their iniquities, to teach
Abraham that they justly deserved to be destroyed: otherwise the history
would not tend to instruction. But when we perceive that the anger of
God is provoked by the sin of man, we are inspired with a dread of
sinning. In saying that the “cry was great,”  <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) he indicates the grievousness of their
crimes, because, although the wicked may promise themselves impunity, by
concealing their evils, and although these evils may be silently and
quietly borne by men; yet their sin will necessarily sound aloud in the
ears of God. Therefore this phrase signifies, that all our deeds, even
those of which we think the memory to be buried, are presented before
the bar of God, and that they, even of themselves, demand vengeance,
although there should be none to accuse.

<span id="xxiv.i-p116"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p116.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p117"></span>**21.** *I will go down now* . Since this
was a signal example of the wrath of God, which He intends to be
celebrated through all ages, and to which he frequently refers in the
Scripture; therefore Moses diligently records those things which are
especially to be considered in divine judgments; just as, in this place,
he commends the moderation of God, who does not immediately fulminate
against the ungodly and pour out his vengeance upon them; but who, when
affairs were utterly desperate, at length executes the punishment which
had been long held suspended over them. And the Lord does not testify in
vain, that he proceeds to inflict punishment in a suitable and rightly
attempered order; because, whenever he chastises us, we are apt to think
that he acts towards us more severely than is just. Even when, with
astonishing forbearance, he waits for us, until we have come to the
utmost limit of impiety, and our wickedness has become too obstinate to
be spared any longer; still we complain of the excessive haste of his
rigour. Therefore he presents as in a conspicuous picture, his equity in
bearing with us, in order that we may know, that he never breaks forth
to inflict punishment, except on those who are mature in crime. Now, if,
on the other hand, we look at Sodom; there a horrible example of stupor
meets our eyes. For the men of Sodom go on, as if they had nothing to do
with God; their sense of good and evil being extinguished, they wallow
like cattle in every kind of filth; and just as if they should never
have to render an account of their conduct, they flatter themselves in
their vices. Since this disease too much prevails in all ages, and is at
present far too common, it is important to mark this circumstance, that
at the very time when the men of Sodom, having dismissed all fear of
God, were indulging themselves, and were promising themselves impunity,
however they might sin, God was taking counsel to destroy them, and was
moved, by the tumultuous cry of their iniquities, to descend to earth,
while they were buried in profound sleep. Wherefore, if God, at any
time, defers his judgments; let us not, therefore, think ourselves in a
better condition; but before the cry of our wickedness shall have
wearied his ears may we, aroused by His threats, quickly hasten to
appease Him. Since, however, such forbearance of God cannot be
comprehended by us, Moses introduces Him as speaking according to the
manner of men.

<span id="xxiv.i-p118"></span>*Whether they have done altogether
according to the cry of it.*  <span id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md)
The Hebrew noun <span id="xxiv.i-p119.3"></span>אלכ ( *cala* ,) which
Moses here uses, means the perfection, or the end of a thing, and also
its destruction. Therefore, Jerome turns it, ‘If they shall have
completed it in act.’ I have, indeed, no doubt but Moses intimates, that
God came down, in order to inquire whether or not their sins had risen
to the highest point: just as he before said, that the iniquities of the
Amorites were not yet full. The sum of the whole then is; the Lord was
about to see whether they were altogether desperate, as having
precipitated themselves into the lowest depths of evil; or whether they
were still in the midst of a course, from which it was possible for them
to be recalled to a sound mind; forasmuch as he was unwilling utterly to
destroy those cities, if, by any method, their wickedness was curable.
Others translate the passage, ‘If they have done this, their final
destruction is at hand: but if not, I will see how far they are to be
punished.’ But the former sense is most accordant with the context.

<span id="xxiv.i-p120"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p120.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p121"></span>**22.** *But Abraham stood yet before the
Lord* . Moses first declares that the men proceeded onwards, conveying
the impression, that having finished their discourse, they took leave of
Abraham, in order that he might return home. He then adds, that Abraham
stood before the Lord, as persons are wont to do, who, though dismissed,
do not immediately depart, because something still remains to be said or
done. Moses, when he makes mention of the journey, with propriety
attributes the name of men to the angels; but he does not, however, say,
that Abraham stood before *men* , but before the face of God; because,
although with his eyes, he beheld the appearance of men, he yet, by
faith, looked upon God. And his words sufficiently show, that he did not
speak as he would have done with a mortal man. Whence we infer, that we
act preposterously, if we allow the external symbols, by which God
represents himself, to retard or hinder us from going directly to Him.
By nature, truly, we are prone to this fault; but so much the more must
we strive, that, by the sense of faith, we may be borne upwards to God
himself, lest the external signs should keep us down to this world.
Moreover, Abraham approaches God, for the sake of showing reverence. For
he does not, in a contentious spirit, oppose God, as if he had a right
to intercede; he only suppliantly entreats: and every word shows the
great humility and modesty of the holy man. I confess, indeed, that at
times, holy men, carried away by carnal sense, have no self-government,
but that, indirectly at least, they murmur against God. Here, however,
Abraham addresses God with nothing but reverence, nor does anything fall
from him worthy of censure; yet we must notice the affection of mind by
which Abraham had been impelled to interpose his prayers on behalf of
the inhabitants of Sodom. Some suppose, that he was more anxious
concerning the safety of his nephew alone than for Sodom and the rest of
the cities; but that, being withheld by modesty, he would not request
one man expressly to be given to him, while he entirely neglected a
great people. But it is, by no means, probable that he made use of such
dissimulation. I certainly do not doubt, that he was so touched with a
common compassion towards the five cities that he drew near to God as
their intercessor. And if we weigh all things attentively, he had great
reasons for doing so. He had lately rescued them from the hand of their
enemies; he now suddenly hears that they are to be destroyed. He might
imagine that he had rashly engaged in that war; that his victory was
under a divine curse, as if he had taken arms against the will of God,
for unworthy and wicked men; and it was possible that he would be not a
little tormented by such thoughts. Besides, it was difficult to believe
them all to have been so ungrateful, that no remembrance of their recent
deliverance remained among them. But it was not lawful for him, by a
single word, to dispute with God, after having heard what He had
determined to do. For God alone best knows what men deserve, and with
what severity they ought to be treated. Why then does not Abraham
acquiesce? Why does he imagine to himself that there are some just
persons in Sodom, whom God has overlooked, and whom he hastens to
overwhelm in a common destruction with the rest? I answer, that the
sense of humanity by which Abraham was moved, was pleasing to God.
Firsts because, as was becoming, he leaves the entire cognizance of the
fact with God. Secondly, because he asks with sobriety and submission,
for the sole cause of obtaining consolation. There is no wonder that he
is terrified at the destruction of so great a multitude. He sees men
created after the image of God; he persuades himself that, in that
immense crowd, there were, at least, a few who were upright, or not
altogether unjust, and abandoned to wickedness. He therefore alleges
before God, what he thinks available to procure their forgiveness. He
may, however, be thought to have acted rashly, in requesting impunity to
the evil, for the sake of the good; for he desired God to spare the
place, if he should find fifty good men there. I answer, that the
prayers of Abraham did not extend so far as to ask God not to scourge
those cities, but only not to destroy them utterly; as if he had said ‘O
Lord, whatever punishment thou mayest inflict upon the guilty, wilt thou
not yet leave some dwelling place for the righteous? Why should that
region utterly perish, as long as a people shall remain, by whom it may
be inhabited?’ Abraham, therefore, does not desire that the wicked,
being mixed with the righteous, should escape the hand of God: but only
that God, in inflicting public punishment on a whole nation, should
nevertheless exempt the good who remained from destruction.

<span id="xxiv.i-p122"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p122.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p123"></span>**23.** *Wilt thou also destroy the
righteous with the wicked?* It is certain that when God chastises the
body of a people, he often involves the good and the reprobate in the
same punishment. So Daniel, Ezekiel, Ezra, and others like them, who
worshipped God in purity in their own country, were suddenly hurried
away into exile, as by a violent tempest: notwithstanding it had been
said

<span id="xxiv.i-p124"></span>‘The land vomiteth out her inhabitants,
because of their iniquities,’ (<span id="xxiv.i-p124.1"></span>[Le
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#025.md)<span
id="xxiv.i-p124.1"></span>.)

<span id="xxiv.i-p125"></span>But when God thus seems to be angry with
all in common, it behoves us to fix our eyes on the end, which shall
evidently discriminate the one from the other. For if the husband man
knows how to separate the grains of wheat in his barn, which with the
chaff are trodden under the feet of the oxen, or are struck out with the
flail; much better does God know how to gather together his faithful
people, — when he has chastised them for a time, — from among the
wicked, (who are like worthless refuse,) that they may not perish
together; yea, by the very event, he will, at length, prove that he
would not permit those whom he was healing by his chastisements to
perish. For, so far is he from hastening to destroy his people, when he
subjects them to temporal punishments, that he is rather administering
to them a medicine which shall procure their salvation. I do not however
doubt, that God had denounced the final destruction of Sodom; and in
this sense Abraham now takes exception, that it was by no means
consistent, that the same ruin should alike fall on the righteous and
the ungodly. There will, however, be no absurdity in saying, that
Abraham, having good hope of the repentance of the wicked, asked God to
spare them; because it often happens that God, out of regard to a few,
deals gently with a whole people. For we know, that public punishments
are mitigated, because the Lord looks upon his own with a benignant and
paternal eye. In the same sense the answer of God himself ought to be
understood, ‘If in the midst of Sodom I find fifty righteous, I will
spare the whole place for their sake.’ Yet God does not here bind
himself by a perpetual rule, so that it shall not be lawful for him, as
often as he sees good, to bring the wicked and the just together to
punishment. And, in order to show that he has free power of judging, he
does not always adhere to the same equable moderation in this respect.
He who would have spared Sodom on account of ten righteous persons,
refused to grant the same terms of pardon to Jerusalem. (<span
id="xxiv.i-p125.1"></span>[Mt
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#024.md)<span
id="xxiv.i-p125.1"></span>.) Let us know, therefore, that God does not
here lay himself under any necessity; but that he speaks thus, in order
to make it better known, that he does not, on light grounds, proceed to
the destruction of a city, of which no portion remained unpolluted.

<span id="xxiv.i-p126"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p126.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p127"></span>**25.** *Shall not the Judge of all the
earth do right?* He does not here teach God His duty, as if any one
should say to a judge, ‘See what thy office requires, what is worthy of
this place, what suits thy character;’ but he reasons from the nature of
God, that it is impossible for Him to intend anything unjust. I grant
that, in using the same form of speaking, the impious often murmur
against God, but Abraham does far otherwise. For although he wonders how
God should think of destroying Sodom, in which he was persuaded there
was a number of good men; he yet retains this principle, that it was
impossible for God, who is the Judge of the world, and by nature loves
equity yea, whose will is the law of justice and rectitude, should in
the least degree swerve from righteousness. He desires, however, to be
relieved from this difficulty with which he is perplexed. So, whenever
different temptations contend within our minds, and some appearance of
contradiction presents itself in the works of God, only let our
persuasion of His justice remain fixed, and we shall be permitted to
pour into His bosom the difficulties which torment us, in order that He
may loosen the knots which we cannot untie. Paul seems to have taken
from this place the answer with which he represses the blasphemy of
those who charge God with unrighteousness.

<span id="xxiv.i-p128"></span>‘Is God unrighteous? Far from it, for how
should there be unrighteousness with Him who judges the world?’  
(<span id="xxiv.i-p128.2"></span>[Rom.
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#006)<span id="xxiv.i-p128.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xxiv.i-p129"></span>This method of appeal would not always
avail among earthly judges; who are sometimes deceived by error, or
perverted by favor, or inflamed with hatred, or corrupted by gifts, or
misled by other means, to acts of injustice. But since God, to whom it
naturally belongs to judge the world, is liable to none of these evils,
it follows, that He can no more be drawn aside from equity, than he can
deny himself to be God.

<span id="xxiv.i-p130"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p130.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p131"></span>**27.** *Which am but dust and ashes* .
Abraham speaks thus for the sake of obtaining pardon. For what is mortal
man when compared with God? He therefore confesses that he is too bold,
in thus familiarly interrogating God; yet he desires that this favor may
be granted unto him, by the Divine indulgence. It is to be noted, that
the nearer Abraham approaches to God, the more fully sensible does he
become of the miserable and abject condition of men. For it is only the
brightness of the glory of God which covers with shame and thoroughly
humbles men, when stripped of their foolish and intoxicated
self-confidence. Whosoever, therefore, seems to himself to be something,
let him turn his eyes to God, and immediately he will acknowledge
himself to be nothing. Abraham, indeed was not forgetful that he
possessed a living soul; but he selects what was most contemptible, in
order to empty himself of all dignity. It may seem, however, that
Abraham does but sophistically trifle with God, when, diminishing
gradually from the number first asked, he proceeds to his sixth
interrogation. I answer, that this was rather to be considered as the
language of a perturbed mind. At first he anxiously labors for the men
of Sodom, wherefore he omits nothing which may serve to mitigate his
solicitude. And as the Lord repeatedly answers him so mildly, we know
that he had not been deemed importunate, nor troublesome. But if he was
kindly heard, when pleading for the inhabitants of Sodom, even to his
sixth petition; much more will the Lord hearken to the prayers which any
one may pour out for the Church and household of faith. Moreover, the
humanity of Abraham appears also in this, that although he knows Sodom
to be filled with vilest corruptions, he cannot bring his mind to think
that all are infected with the contagion of wickedness; but he rather
inclines to the equitable supposition, that, in so great a multitude,
some just persons may be concealed. For this is a horrible prodigy, that
the filth of iniquity should so pervade the whole body, as to allow no
member to remain pure. We are, however, taught by this example, how
tyrannically Satan proceeds when once the dominion of sin is
established. And certainly, seeing the propensity of men to sin, and the
facility for sinning are so great, it is not surprising that one should
be corrupted by another, till the contagion reached every individual.
For nothing is more dangerous than to live where the public license of
crime prevails; yea, there is no pestilence so destructive, as that
corruption of morals, which is opposed neither by laws nor judgments,
nor any other remedies. And although Moses, in the next chapter <span
id="xxiv.i-p131.1"></span>[Ge
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#001.md)<span id="xxiv.i-p131.1"></span>,
explains the most filthy crime which reigned in Sodom, we must
nevertheless remember what Ezekiel teaches (<span
id="xxiv.i-p131.2"></span>[Ezek.
16:48](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#048.md),
[49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049)<span id="xxiv.i-p131.2"></span>,.md)
that the men of Sodom did not fall at once into such execrable
wickedness; but that in the beginning, luxury from the fullness of bread
prevailed, and that, afterwards, pride and cruelty followed. At length,
when they were given up to a reprobate mind, they were also driven
headlong into brutal lusts. Therefore if we dread this extreme of
inordinate passion, let us cultivate temperance and frugality; and let
us always fear, lest a superfluity of food should impel us to luxury;
lest our minds should be infected with pride on account of our wealth,
and lest delicacies should tempt us to give the reins to our lusts.
