<span id="xi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 5.

<span id="xi.i"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p1"></span><span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
5:1-32](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#001.md)<span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p2"></span>**1.** This *is* the book of the generations
of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he
him;

<span id="xi.i-p3"></span>**1.** Iste est liber generationum Adam: in
die qua creavit Deus hominem, ad similitudinem Dei fecit illum.

<span id="xi.i-p4"></span>**2.** Male and female created he them; and
blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were
created.

<span id="xi.i-p5"></span>**2.** Masculum et foeminam creeavit eos, et
benedixit eis: et vocavit nomen eorum Hominem, in die qua creati sunt.

<span id="xi.i-p6"></span>**3.** And Adam lived an hundred and thirty
years, and begat *a son* in his own likeness, after his image; and
called his name Seth:

<span id="xi.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et vixit Adam triginta et centum annos:
et genuit ad similitudinem suam, ad imaginem suam *filium* , et vocavit
nomen ejus Seth.

<span id="xi.i-p8"></span>**4.** And the days of Adam after he had
begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:

<span id="xi.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et fuerunt dies Adam postquam genuit
Seth, octingenti anni: et genuit filios et filias.

<span id="xi.i-p10"></span>**5.** And all the days that Adam lived were

annos, et genuit Enos.

<span id="xi.i-p14"></span>**7.** And Seth lived after he begat Enos
eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:

septem annos et octingentos annos: et genuit filios et filias.

<span id="xi.i-p16"></span>**8.** And all the days of Seth were nine

quindecim annos et octingentos annos, et genuit filios et filias.

<span id="xi.i-p22"></span>**11.** And all the days of Enos were nine

quinque anni et nongenti anni: et mortuus est.

<span id="xi.i-p24"></span>**12.** And Cainan lived seventy years, and

Mahalaleel, quadraginta annos et octingentos annos: et genuit filios et
filias.

<span id="xi.i-p66"></span> 

<span id="xi.i-p67"></span><span id="xi.i-p67.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p68"></span>**1.** *This* *is* *the* *book* *of* *the*
*generations* *of* *Adam* . In this chapter Moses briefly recites the
length of time which had intervened between the creation of the world
and the deluge; and also slightly touches on some portion of the history
of that period. And although we do not comprehend the design of the
Spirit, in leaving unrecorded great and memorable events, it is,
nevertheless, our business to reflect on many things which are passed
over in silence. I entirely disapprove of those speculations which every
one frames for himself from light conjectures; nor will I furnish
readers with the occasion of indulging themselves in this respect; yet
it may, in some degree, be gathered from a naked and apparently dry
narration, what was the state of those times, as we shall see in the
proper places. The book, according to the Hebrew phrase, is taken for a
catalogue. The generations signify a continuous succession of a race, or
a continuous progeny. Further, the design with which this catalogue was
made, was, to inform us, that in the great, or rather, we might say,
prodigious multitude of men, there was always a number, though small,
who worshipped God; and that this number was wonderfully preserved by
celestial guardianship, lest the name of God should be entirely
obliterated, and the seed of the Church should fail.

<span id="xi.i-p69"></span>*In* *the* *day* *that* *God* *created* . He
does not restrict these “generations” to the day of the creation, but
only points out their commencement; and, at the same time, he
distinguishes between our first parents and the rest of mankind, because
God had brought them into life by a singular method, whereas others had
sprung from a previous stock, and had been born of parents.  <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) Moreover, Moses again repeats what he
had before stated that Adam was formed according to the image of God,
because the excellency and dignity of this favor could not be
sufficiently celebrated. It was already a great thing, that the
principal place among the creatures was given to man; but it is a
nobility far more exalted, that he should bear resemblance to his
Creator, as a son does to his father. It was not indeed possible for God
to act more liberally towards man, than by impressing his own glory upon
him, thus making him, as it were, a living image of the Divine wisdom
and justice. This also is of force in repelling the calumnies of the
wicked who would gladly transfer the blame of their wickedness to their
Maker, had it not been expressly declared, that man was formed by nature
a different being from that which he has now become, through the fault
of his own defection from God.

<span id="xi.i-p71"></span><span id="xi.i-p71.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p72"></span>**2.** *Male* *and* *female* *created* *he*
*them* . This clause commends the sacred bond of marriage, and the
inseparable union of the husband and the wife. For when Moses has
mentioned only one, he immediately afterwards includes *both* under
*one* name. And he assigns a common name indiscriminately to both, in
order that posterity might learn more sacredly to cherish this
connection between each other, when they saw that their first parents
were denominated as one person. The trifling inference of Jewish
writers, that married persons *only* are called Adam, (or man,) is
refuted by the history of the creation; nor truly did the Spirit, in
this place, mean anything else, than that after the appointment of
marriage, the husband and the wife were like one man. Moreover, he
records the blessing pronounced upon them, that we may observe in it the
wonderful kindness of God in continuing to grant it; yet let us know
that by the depravity and wickedness of men it was, in some degree,
interrupted.

<span id="xi.i-p73"></span><span id="xi.i-p73.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p74"></span>**3.** *And* *begat* *a* *son* *in* *his*
*own* *likeness* . We have lately said that Moses traces the offspring
of Adam only through the line of Seth, to propose for our consideration
the succession of the Church. In saying that Seth begat a son after his
own image, he refers in part to the first origin of our nature: at the
same time its corruption and pollution is to be noticed, which having
been contracted by Adam through the fall, has flowed down to all his
posterity. If he had remained upright, he would have transmitted to all
his children what he had received: but now we read that Seth, as well as
the rest, was defiled; because Adams who had fallen from his original
state, could beget none but such as were like himself. If any one should
object that Seth with his family had been elected by the special grace
of God: the answer is easy and obvious; namely, that a supernatural
remedy does not prevent carnal generation from participating in the
corruption of sin. Therefore, according to the flesh, Seth was born a
sinner; but afterwards he was renewed by the grace of the Spirit. This
sad instance of the holy patriarch furnishes us with ample occasion to
deplore our own wretchedness.

<span id="xi.i-p75"></span><span id="xi.i-p75.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p76"></span>**4.** *And* *the* *days* *of* *Adam* *after*
*he* *had* *begotten* *Seth* . In the number of years here recorded we
must especially consider the long period which the patriarchs lived
together. For through six successive ages, when the family of Seth had
grown into a great people, the voice of Adam might daily resound, in
order to renew the memory of the creation, the fall, and the punishment
of man; to testify of the hope of salvation which remained after
chastisement, and to recite the judgments of God, by which all might be
instructed. After his death his sons might indeed deliver, as from hand
to hand, what they had learned, to their descendants; but far more
efficacious would be the instruction from the mouth of him, who had been
himself the eyewitness of all these things. Yet so wonderful, and even
monstrous, was the general obstinacy, that not even the sounder part of
the human race could be retained in the obedience and the fear of God.

<span id="xi.i-p77"></span><span id="xi.i-p77.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p78"></span>**5.** *And* *he* *died* . This clause, which
records the death of each patriarch, is by no means superfluous. For it
warns us that death was not in vain denounced against men; and that we
are now exposed to the curse to which man was doomed, unless we obtain
deliverance elsewhere. In the meantime, we must reflect upon our
lamentable condition; namely, that the image of God being destroyed, or,
at least, obliterated in us, we scarcely retain the faint shadow of a
life, from which we are hastening to death. And it is useful, in a
picture of so many ages, to behold, at one glance, the continual course
and tenor of divine vengeance; because otherwise, we imagine that God is
in some way forgetful; and to nothing are we more prone than to dream of
immortality on earth, unless death is frequently brought before our
eyes.

<span id="xi.i-p79"></span><span id="xi.i-p79.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p80"></span>**22.** *And* *Enoch* *walked* *with* *God* .
Undoubtedly Enoch is honored with peculiar praise among the men of his
own age, when it is said that he walked with God. Yet both Seth and
Enoch, and Cainan, and Mahalaleel, and Jared, were then living, whose
piety was celebrated in the former part of the chapter.  <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) As that age could not be ruder or
barbarous, which had so many most excellent teachers; we hence infer,
that the probity of this holy man, whom the Holy Spirit exempted from
the common order, was rare and almost singular. Meanwhile, a method is
here pointed out of guarding against being carried away by the perverse
manners of those with whom we are conversant. For public custom is as a
violent tempest; both because we easily suffer ourselves to be led
hither and thither by the multitude, and because every one thinks what
is commonly received must be right and lawful; just as swine contract an
itching from each other; nor is there any contagion worse, and more
loathsome than that of evil examples. Hence we ought the more diligently
to notice the brief description of a holy life, contained in the words,
“Enoch walked with God.” Let those, then, who please, glory in living
according to the custom of others; yet the Spirit of God has established
a rule of living well and rightly, by which we depart from the examples
of men who do not form their life and manners according to the law of
God. For he who, pouring contempt upon the word of God, yields himself
up to the imitation of the world, must be regarded as living to the
devil. Moreover, (as I have just now hinted,) all the rest of the
patriarchs are not deprived of the praise of righteousness; but a
remarkable example is set before us in the person of one man, who stood
firmly in the season of most dreadful dissipation; in order that, if we
wish to live rightly and orderly, we may learn to regard God more than
men. For the language which Moses uses is of the same force as if he had
said, that Enoch, lest he should be drawn aside by the corruptions of
men, had respect to God alone; so that with a pure conscience, as under
his eyes, he might cultivate uprightness.

<span id="xi.i-p82"></span><span id="xi.i-p82.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p83"></span>**24.** *And* *he* *was* *not* *,* *for*
*God* *took* *him* . He must be shamelessly contentious, who will not
acknowledge that something extraordinary is here pointed out. All are,
indeed, taken out of the world by death; but Moses plainly declares that
Enoch was taken out of the world by an unusual mode, and was received by
the Lord in a miraculous manner. For <span id="xi.i-p83.1"></span>הקל (
*lakah* ) among the Hebrews signifies ‘to take to one’s self,’ as well
as simply to take. But, without insisting on the word, it suffices to
hold fast the thing itself; namely, that Enoch, in the middle period of
life, suddenly, and in an unexampled method, vanished from the sight of
men, because the Lord took him away, as we read was also done with
respect to Elijah. Since, in the translation of Enoch, an example of
immortality was exhibited; there is no doubt that God designed to
elevate the minds of his saints with certain faith before their death;
and to mitigate, by this consolation, the dread which they might
entertain of death, seeing they would know that a better life was
elsewhere laid up for them. It is, however, remarkable that Adam himself
was deprived of this support of faith and of comfort. For since that
terrible judgment of God, ‘Thou shalt die the death,’ was constantly
sounding in his ears, he very greatly needed some solace, in order that
he might in death have something else to reflect upon than curse and
destruction. But it was not till about one hundred and fifty years after
his death,  <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) that the translation
of Enoch took place, which was to be as a visible representation of a
blessed resurrection; by which, if Adam had been enlightened, he might
have girded himself with equanimity for his own departure. Yet, since
the Lord, in inflicting punishment, had moderated its rigour, and since
Adam himself had heard from his own mouth, what was sufficient to afford
him no slight alleviation; contented with this kind of remedy, it became
his duty patiently to bear, both the continual cross in this world, and
also the bitter and sorrowful termination of his life. But whereas
others were not taught in the same manner by a manifest oracle to hope
for victory over the serpent, there was, in the translation of Enoch, an
instruction for all the godly, that they should not keep their hope
confined within the boundaries of this mortal life. For Moses shows that
this translation was a proof of the Divine love towards Enoch, by
connecting it immediately with his pious and upright life. Nevertheless,
to be deprived of life is not in itself desirable. It follows,
therefore, that he was taken to a better abode; and that even when he
was a sojourner in the world, he was received into a heavenly country;
as the Apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, (<span
id="xi.i-p85.2"></span>[Heb 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#005.md)<span
id="xi.i-p85.2"></span>,) plainly teaches. Moreover, if it be inquired,
why Enoch was translated, and what is his present condition; I answer,
that his transition was by a peculiar privilege, such as that of other
men would have been, if they had remained in their first state.  <span
id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) For although it was necessary for him
to put off what was corruptible; yet was he exempt from that violent
separation, from which nature shrinks. In short, his translation was a
placid and joyful departure out of the world. Yet he was not received
into celestial glory, but only freed from the miseries of the present
life, until Christ should come, the first-fruits of those who shall rise
again. And since he was one of the members of the Church, it was
necessary that he should wait until they all shall go forth together, to
meet Christ, that the whole body may be united to its Head. Should any
one bring as an objection the saying of the Apostle,

<span id="xi.i-p87"></span>‘It is appointed unto all men once to die,’
(<span id="xi.i-p87.1"></span>[Heb
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027)<span id="xi.i-p87.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="xi.i-p88"></span>the solution is easy, namely, that death is
not always the separation of the soul from the body; but they are said
to die, who put off their corruptible nature: and such will be the death
of those who will be found surviving at the last day.

<span id="xi.i-p89"></span><span id="xi.i-p89.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p90"></span>**29.** *And* *he* *called* *his* *name*
*Noah* *,* *saying* *,* *This* *same* *shall* *comfort* *us*
*concerning* *our* *work* . In the Hebrew languages the etymology of the
verb <span id="xi.i-p90.1"></span>םחנ ( *nacham* ) does not correspond
with the noun <span id="xi.i-p90.2"></span>חונ ( *noach* ,) unless we
call the letter <span id="xi.i-p90.3"></span>ם ( *mem* ) superfluous; as
sometimes, in composition, certain letters are redundant. <span
id="xi.i-p90.4"></span>חונ *Noach* signifies to *give rest* , but <span
id="xi.i-p90.5"></span>םחנ *nacham* to *comfort* . The name Noah is
derived from the former verb. Wherefore, there is either the
transmutation of one letter into another, or only a bare *allusion* ,
when Lamech says, “This same shall comfort us concerning our work.”
 <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) But as to the point in hand,
there is no doubt that he promises to himself an alleviation, or solace,
of his labors. But it is asked, whence he had conceived such hope from a
son whose disposition he could not yet have discerned. The Jews do not
judge erroneously in declaring Lamech’s expression to be a prophecy; but
they are too gross in restricting to agriculture what is applicable to
all those miseries of human life which proceed from the curse of God,
and are the fruits of sin. I come, indeed, to this conclusion; that the
holy fathers anxiously sighed, when, being surrounded with so many evils
they were continually reminded of the first origin of all evils, and
regarded themselves as under the displeasure of God. Therefore in the
expression, the toil of our hands, there is the figure *synecdochee* ;
because under one kind of toil he comprises the whole miserable state
into which mankind had fallen. For they undoubtedly remembered what
Moses has related above, concerning the labourious, sad, and anxious
life to which Adam had been doomed: and since the wickedness of man was
daily increasing, no mitigation of the penalty could be hoped for,
unless the Lord should bring unexpected succor. It is probable that they
were very earnestly looking for the mercy of God; for their faith was
strong, and necessity urged them ardently to desire help. But that the
name was not rashly given to Noah, we may infer hence, that Moses
expressly notes it as a thing worthy to be remembered. Certainly some
meaning was couched under the names of other patriarchs; yet he passes
by the reason why they were so called, and only insists upon this name
of Noah. Therefore the contentious reader is not to be allowed hence to
pronounce a judgment, that there was something peculiar in Noah, which
did not suit others before him. I have, then, no doubt that Lamech hoped
for something rare and unwonted from his son; and that, too, by the
inspiration of the Spirit. Some suppose him to have been deceived,
inasmuch as he believed that Noah was the Christ; but they adduce no
rational conjecture in support of the opinion. It is more probable,
that, seeing something great was promised concerning his son, he did not
refrain from mixing his own imagination with the oracle; as holy men are
also sometimes wont to exceed the measure of revelation, and thus it
comes to pass, that they neither touch heaven nor earth.

<span id="xi.i-p92"></span><span id="xi.i-p92.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p93"></span>**32.** *And* *Noah* *was* *five* *hundred*
*years* *old* . Concerning the fathers whom Moses has hitherto
enumerated, it is not easy to conjecture whether each of them was the
first born of his family or not; for he only wished to follow the
continued succession of the Church. But God, to prevent men from being
elated by a vain confidence in the flesh, frequently chooses for himself
those who are posterior in the order of nature. I am, therefore,
uncertain whether Moses has recorded the catalogue of those whom God
preferred to others; or of those who, by right of primogeniture, held
the chief rank among their brethren; I am also uncertain how many sons
each had. With respect to Noah, it plainly appears that he had no more
than three sons; and this Moses purposely declares the more frequently,
that we may know that the whole of his family was preserved. But they,
in my opinion, err, who think that in this place the chastity of Noah is
proclaimed, because he led a single life through nearly five centuries.
For it is not said that he was unmarried till that time; nor even in
what year of his life he had begun to be a father. But, in simply
mentioning the time in which he was warned of the future deluge, Moses
also adds, that at the same time, or thereabouts, he was the father of
three sons; not that he already had them, but because they were born not
long afterwards. That he had, indeed, survived his five hundredth year
before Shem was born, will be evident from the eleventh chapter (<span
id="xi.i-p93.1"></span>[Ge 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md)<span
id="xi.i-p93.1"></span>); concerning the other two nothing is known with
certainty, except that Japheth was the younger.  <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) It is wonderful that from the time
when he had received the dreadful message respecting the destruction of
the human race, he was not prevented, by the greatness of his grief,
from intercourse with his wife; but it was necessary that some remains
should survive, because this family was destined for the restoration of
the second world. Although we do not read at what time his sons took
wives, I yet think it was done long before the deluge; but they were
unfruitful by the providence of God, who had determined to preserve only
eight souls.

<span id="xi.i-p70"></span> “<span id="xi.i-p70.1"></span>Il discerne
les premiers hommes d’avec les autres, aus quels Dieu a prolonge la vie
eu une facon singuliere: combien qu’ils ne fussent de si haute ne si
noble race.” — *French Trans*.  
It will be perceived that this translation differs materially in sense
from that given above; but, after the fullest consideration, the Editor
adheres to his own, as a more literal rendering of the original Latin,
and as being more in accordance with the reasoning of the Author. —

<span id="xi.i-p84"></span> Adam died at the age of 930.  
Enoch was born when Adam was 622,  
and was translated when he himself was 365.  
Age of the world, 987.

<span id="xi.i-p85"></span>So that Adam had been dead 57 years when
Enoch was translated. Whence it would appear that either the word “<span
id="xi.i-p85.1"></span>centum,” a hundred, had slipped by mistake from
Calvin’s pen; or which is more probably, that, though the two Latin
editions before the Editor, have the mistake, the more early ones were
free from it. For the French version and the Old English one are
correct. — *Ed*.

<span id="xi.i-p86"></span> “<span id="xi.i-p86.1"></span>S’ils fussent
demeurez en leur premier estat.” These words, in the French translation,
have no corresponding passage in the original, but are so obvious an
explanation of Calvin’s language, that they are here translated. — *Ed*.

id="xi.i-p91.1"></span>םחנ, No. III and also, sub voce <span
id="xi.i-p91.2"></span>חונ, as a proper name, where he derives the
latter word from the former, “<span id="xi.i-p91.3"></span>litera <span

<span id="xi.i-p94"></span> This inference, that Japheth was the younger
son, Calvin seems to have drawn from a translation of <span
id="xi.i-p94.1"></span>[Ge 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#021.md)<span
id="xi.i-p94.1"></span>, different from our own. In our version Shem is
there called “the brother of Japheth the elder.” But commentators are
generally agreed that the English version is right. It not only gives
the more natural sense of the original, but is confirmed by collateral
testimony. For it is clear that Noah began to have children in his five
hundredth year. Shem was one hundred years old two years after the
flood, and therefore was born when his father was five hundred and two
years old. Some one, then, of Noah’s sons must have been born before
this. Now we are told that Ham was the younger son, (<span
id="xi.i-p94.2"></span>[Ge 9:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#024.md)<span
id="xi.i-p94.2"></span>). Therefore Japheth must have been his
first-born. — See Patrick’s and Bush’s Commentaries, and Wells’
Geography of the Old Testament. — *Ed*.
