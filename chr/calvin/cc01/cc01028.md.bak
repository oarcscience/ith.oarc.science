<span id="xxix-p1"></span>CHAPTER 23.

<span id="xxix.i"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p1"></span><span id="xxix.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
23:1-20](../../../bib/kjv/gen023.htm#001.md)<span id="xxix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p2"></span>**1.** And Sarah was an hundred and seven
and twenty years old: *these were* the years of the life of Sarah.

<span id="xxix.i-p3"></span>**1.** Fuit autem vita Sarah centum anni et
viginti anni et septem anni: anni vitae Sarah.

<span id="xxix.i-p4"></span>**2.** And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the
same *is* Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for
Sarah, and to weep for her.

<span id="xxix.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et mortua Sarah in Cirjath — arbah:
ipsa est Hebron in terra Chenaan. Et venit Abraham ad plangendum super
Sarah, et ad lugendam eam.

<span id="xxix.i-p6"></span>**3.** And Abraham stood up from before his
dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,

<span id="xxix.i-p7"></span>**3.** Deinde surrexit Abraham a facie
mortui sui, et loquutus est ad filios Heth, dicendo,

<span id="xxix.i-p8"></span>**4.** I *am* a stranger and a sojourner
with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may
bury my dead out of my sight.

<span id="xxix.i-p9"></span>**4.** Peregrinus et advena sum vobiscum:
date mihi haereditatem sepulchri vobiscum: et sepeliam mortuum meum a
facie mea.

<span id="xxix.i-p10"></span>**5.** And the children of Heth answered
Abraham, saying unto him,

<span id="xxix.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et responderunt filii Heth ad
Abraham, dicendo ei,

<span id="xxix.i-p12"></span>**6.** Hear us, my lord: thou *art* a
mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead;
none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest
bury thy dead.

<span id="xxix.i-p13"></span>**6.** Audi nos, domine mi, Princeps Dei es
in medio nostri: in electis sepulchris nostris sepeli mortuum tuum: nemo
e nobis sepulchrum suum prohibebit a to, ne sepelias mortuum tuum.

<span id="xxix.i-p14"></span>**7.** And Abraham stood up, and bowed
himself to the people of the land, *even* to the children of Heth.

<span id="xxix.i-p15"></span>**7.** Tunc surrexit Abraham, et incurvavit
se populo terrae, filiis Heth.

<span id="xxix.i-p16"></span>**8.** And he communed with them, saying,
If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me,
and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,

<span id="xxix.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et loquutus est cum eis, dicendo, Si
est in animis vestris, ut sepeliam mortuum meum a facie mae, audite me,
et intercedite pro me apud Ephron filium Sohar:

<span id="xxix.i-p18"></span>**9.** That he may give me the cave of
Machpelah, which he hath, which *is* in the end of his field; for as
much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a
buryingplace amongst you.

<span id="xxix.i-p19"></span>**9.** Ut det mihi speluncam duplicem quae
est ei in fine agri sui: argento pleno det eam mihi in medio vestri in
haereditatem sepulchri.

<span id="xxix.i-p20"></span>**10.** And Ephron dwelt among the children
of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the
children of Heth, *even* of all that went in at the gate of his city,
saying,

<span id="xxix.i-p21"></span>**10.** Et Ephron habitabat in medio
filiorum Heth: et respondit Ephron Hitthaeus ad Abraham in auribus Heth,
in auribus omnium ingredientum portam civitatis suae, dicendo,

<span id="xxix.i-p22"></span>**11.** Nay, my lord, hear me: the field
give I thee, and the cave that *is* therein, I give it thee; in the
presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.

<span id="xxix.i-p23"></span>**11.** Non, domine mi, audi me, Agrum dedi
tibi, et speluncam, quae est in eo, tibi dedi eam in oculis filiorum
populi mei, dedi tibi: sepeli mortuum tuum.

<span id="xxix.i-p24"></span>**12.** And Abraham bowed down himself
before the people of the land.

<span id="xxix.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et incurvavit se Abraham coram
populi terrae:

<span id="xxix.i-p26"></span>**13.** And he spake unto Ephron in the
audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou *wilt give it* ,
I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take *it* of
me, and I will bury my dead there.

<span id="xxix.i-p27"></span>**13.** Et loquutus est ad Ephron in
auribus populi terrae, dicendo, Veruntamen si tu: utinam audias me: dabo
argentum agri, cape a me, et sepliam mortuum meum ibi.

<span id="xxix.i-p28"></span>**14.** And Ephron answered Abraham, saying
unto him,

<span id="xxix.i-p29"></span>**14.** Et respondit Ephron and Abraham,
dicendo ei,

<span id="xxix.i-p30"></span>**15.** My lord, hearken unto me: the land
*is worth* four hundred shekels of silver; what *is* that betwixt me and
thee? bury therefore thy dead.

<span id="xxix.i-p31"></span>**15.** Domine mi, audi me, terra
quadringentorum siclorum argenteorum est inter me et to, quid est? et
mortuum tuum sepeli.

<span id="xxix.i-p32"></span>**16.** And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron;
and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the
audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current
*money* with the merchant.

<span id="xxix.i-p33"></span>**16.** Et obedivit Abraham ipsi Ephron, et
appendit Abraham ipsi Ephron argentum quod loquutus fuerat in auribus
filiorum Heth, quadringentos siclos argenteos transeuntes per
mercatores.

<span id="xxix.i-p34"></span>**17.** And the field of Ephron, which
*was* in Machpelah, which *was* before Mamre, the field, and the cave
which *was* therein, and all the trees that *were* in the field, that
*were* in all the borders round about, were made sure

<span id="xxix.i-p35"></span>**17.** Et confirmatus est ager Ephron, qui
erat in spelunca duplici, qui erat coram Mamre: ager et spelunca, quae
erat in eo, et omnis arbor, quae erat in agro, quae erat in omni termino
ejus per circuitum:

<span id="xxix.i-p36"></span>**18.** Unto Abraham for a possession in
the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the
gate of his city.

<span id="xxix.i-p37"></span>**18.** Ipsi Abraham in possessionem, in
oculis filiorum Heth, omnium ingredientum portam civitatis ejus.

<span id="xxix.i-p38"></span>**19.** And after this, Abraham buried
Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the
same *is* Hebron in the land of Canaan.

<span id="xxix.i-p39"></span>**19.** Et postea sepelivit Abraham Sarah
uxorem suam in spelunca agri duplici coram Mamre: haec est Hebron in
terra Chenaan.

<span id="xxix.i-p40"></span>**20.** And the field, and the cave that
*is* therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a
buryingplace by the sons of Heth.

<span id="xxix.i-p41"></span>**20.** Et confirmatus est ager, et
spelunca que erat in eo, ipsi Abraham in haereditatem sepulchri a filiis
Heth.

<span id="xxix.i-p42"></span> 

<span id="xxix.i-p43"></span><span id="xxix.i-p43.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p44"></span>**1.** *And Sarah was an hundred and seven
and twenty years old*  <span id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md) It is
remarkable that Moses, who relates the death of Sarah in a single word,
uses so many in describing her burial: but we shall soon see that the
latter record is not superfluous. Why he so briefly alludes to her
death, I know not, except that he leaves more to be reflected upon by
his readers than he expresses. The holy fathers saw that they in common
with reprobates, were subject to death. Nevertheless, they were not
deterred, While painfully leading a life full of suffering, from
advancing with intrepidity towards the goal. Whence it follows, that
they, being animated by the hope of a better life, did not give way to
fatigue. Moses says that Sarah lived a hundred and twenty-seven years,
and since he repeats the word *years* after each of the numbers, the
Jews feign that this was done because she had been as beautiful in her
hundredth, as in her twentieth year, and as modest in the flower of her
age, as when she was seven years old. This is their custom; while they
wish to prove themselves skillful in doing honor to their nations they
invent frivolous trifles, which betray a shameful ignorance: as, for
instance, in this place, who would not say that they were entirely
ignorant of their own languages in which this kind of repetition is most
usual? The discussion of others also, on the word <span
id="xxix.i-p45.1"></span>םיח, ( *lives* ,) is without solidity. The
reason why the Hebrews use the word *lives* in the plural number, for
*life* , cannot be better explained, as it appears to me, than the
reason why the Latins express some things which are singular in plural
forms.  <span id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) I know that the life of
men is manifold, because, beyond merely vegetative life, and beyond the
sense which they have in common with brute animals, they are also endued
with mind and intelligence. This reasoning, therefore, is plausible
without being solid. There is more color of truth in the opinion of
those who think that the various events of human life are signified;
which life, since it has nothing stable, but is agitated by perpetual
vicissitudes, is rightly divided into many lives. I am, however,
contented to refer simply to the idiom of the language; the reason of
which is not always to be curiously investigated.

<span id="xxix.i-p47"></span><span id="xxix.i-p47.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p48"></span>**2.** *And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba* .
It appears from <span id="xxix.i-p48.1"></span>[Jos
15:54](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#054.md)<span id="xxix.i-p48.1"></span>,
that this was the more ancient name of the city, which afterwards began
to be called Hebron. But there is a difference of opinion respecting the
etymology. Some think the name is derived from the fact, that the city
consisted of four parts; as the Greeks call the city divided into three
orders, *Tripoli* , and a given region, *Decapolis* , from the ten
cities it contained. Others suppose that Arba is the name of a giant,
whom they believe to have been the king or the founder of the city.
Others again prefer the notion, that the name was given to the place
from *four*  <span id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) of the Fathers,
Adam, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were buried there with their wives.
I willingly suspend my judgment on a matter of uncertainty, and not very
necessary to be known. It more concerns the present history to inquire,
how it happened that Sarah died in a different place from that in which
Abraham dwelt. If any one should reply, that they had both changed their
abode, the words of Moses are opposed to that, for he says that Abraham
came to bury his dead. It is hence easily inferred, that he was not
present at her death; nor is it probable that they were separated,
merely by being in different tents; so that he might walk ten or twenty
paces for the sake of mourning, while a more important duty had been
neglected. For this reason, some suspect that he was on a journey at the
time. But to me it seems more likely that their abode was then at Heron,
or at least in the vale of Mamre, which adjoins the city. For, after a
little breathing time had been granted him he was soon compelled to
return to his accustomed wanderings. And although Moses does not say,
that Abraham had paid to his wife while yet alive, the due attentions of
a husband; I think that he omits it, as a thing indubitably certain, and
that he speaks particularly of the mourning, as a matter connected with
the care of sepulture. That they dwelt separately we shall afterwards
see: not as being in different regions, but because each inhabited
separate, though contiguous, tents. And this was no sign of dissension
or of strife, but is rather to be ascribed to the size of the family.
For as Abraham had much trouble in governing so large a herd of
servants; so his wife would have equal difficulty to retain her maids
under chaste and honest custody. Therefore the great number of domestics
which it was not safe to mingle together, compelled them to divide the
family.

<span id="xxix.i-p50"></span>But it may be asked, what end could it
answer to approach the body for the sake of mourning over it? Was not
the death of his wife sufficiently sad and bitter to call forth his
grief, without this additional means of excitement? It would have been
better to seek the alleviation of his sorrow, than to cherish and even
augment it, by indulgence. I answer; if Abraham came to his dead wife,
in order to produce excessive weeping, and to pierce his heart afresh
with new wounds, his example is not to be approved. But if he both
privately wept over the death of his wife, so far as humanity
prescribed, exercising self-government in doing it; and also voluntarily
mourned over the common curse of mankind; there is no fault in either of
these. For to feel no sadness at the contemplation of death, is rather
barbarism and stupor than fortitude of mind. Nevertheless, as Abraham
was a man, it might be, that his grief was excessive. And yet, what
Moses soon after subjoins, that he rose up from his dead, is spoken in
praise of his moderation; whence Ambrose prudently infers, that we are
taught by this example, how perversely they act, who occupy themselves
too much in mourning for the dead. Now, if Abraham at that time,
assigned a limit to his grief; and put a restraint on his feelings, when
the doctrine of the resurrection was yet obscure; they are without
excuse, who, at this day, give the reins to impatience, since the most
abundant consolation is supplied to us in the resurrection cf Christ.

<span id="xxix.i-p51"></span><span id="xxix.i-p51.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p52"></span>**3.** *And spake unto the sons of Heth* .
Moses is silent respecting the rite used by Abraham in the burial of the
body of his wife: but he proceeds, at great length, to recite the
purchasing of the sepulcher. For what reason he did this, we shall see
presently, when I shall briefly allude to the custom of burial. How
religiously this has been observed in all ages, and among all people, is
well known. Ceremonies have indeed been different, and men have
endeavored to outdo each other in various superstitions; meanwhile, to
bury the dead has been common to all. And this practice has not arisen
either from foolish curiosity, or from the desire of fruitless
consolation, or from superstition, but from the natural sense with which
God has imbued the minds of men; a sense he has never suffered to
perish, in order that men might be witnesses to themselves of a future
life. It is also incredible that they, who have disseminated certain
outrageous expressions in contempt of sepulture, could have spoken from
the heart. Truly it behaves us, with magnanimity, so far to disregard
the rites of sepulture, — as we would riches and honors, and the other
conveniences of life, — that we should bear with equanimity to be
deprived of them; yet it cannot be denied that religion carries along
with it the care of burial. And certainly (as I have said) it has been
divinely engraven on the minds of all people, from the beginning, that
they should bury the dead; whence also they have ever regarded
sepulchres as sacred. It has not, I confess, always entered into the
minds of heathens that *souls* survived death, and that the hope of a
resurrection remained even for their *bodies* ; nor have they been
accustomed to exercise themselves in a pious meditation of this kind,
whenever they had laid their dead in the grave; but this inconsideration
of theirs does not disprove the fact; that they had such a
representation of a future life placed before their eyes, as left them
inexcusable. Abraham however, seeing he has the hope of a resurrection
deeply fixed in his heart, sedulously cherished, as was meet, its
visible symbol. The importance he attached to it appears hence, that he
thought he should be guilty of pollution, if he mingled the body of his
wife with strangers after death. For he bought a cave, in order that he
might possess for himself and his family, a holy and pure sepulcher. He
did not desire to have a foot of earth whereon to fix his tent; he only
took care about his grave: and he especially wished to have his own
domestic tomb in that land, which had been promised him for an
inheritance, for the purpose of bearing testimony to posterity, that the
promise of God was not extinguished either by his own death, or by that
of his family; but that it then rather began to flourish; and that they
who were deprived of the light of the sun, and of the vital air, yet
always remained joint-partakers of the promised inheritance. For while
they themselves were silent and speechless, the sepulcher cried aloud,
that death formed no obstacle to their entering on the possession of it.
A thought like this could have had no place, unless Abraham by faith had
looked up to heaven. And when he calls the corpse of his wife *his dead*
; he intimates that death is a divorce of that kind, which still leaves
some remaining conjunction. Moreover, nothing but a future restoration
cherishes and preserves the law of mutant connection between the living
and the dead. But it is better briefly to examine each particular, in
its order.

<span id="xxix.i-p53"></span><span id="xxix.i-p53.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p54"></span>**4.** *I am a stranger and a sojourner
with you* . This introductory sentence tends to one or other of these
points; either that he may more easily gain what he desires by
suppliantly asking for it; or that he may remove all suspicion of
cupidity on his part. He therefore confesses, that, since he had only a
precarious abode among them, he could possess no sepulcher, unless by
their permission. And because, during life, they have permitted him to
dwell within their territory, it was the part of humanity, not to deny
him a sepulcher for his dead. If this sense be approved, then Abraham
both conciliates their favor to himself, by his humility, and in
declaring that the children of Heth had dealt kindly with him, he
stimulates them, by this praise, to proceed in the exercise of the same
liberality with which they had begun. The other sense, however, is not
incongruous; namely, that Abraham, to avert the odium which might attach
to him as a purchaser, declares that he desires the possession, not for
the advantage of the present life, not from ambition or avarice, but
only in order that his dead may not lie unburied; as if he had said, I
do not refuse to continue to live a stranger among you, as I have
hitherto done; I do not desire your possessions, in order that I may
have something of my own, which may enable me hereafter to contend for
equality with you; it is enough for me to have a place where we may be
buried.

<span id="xxix.i-p55"></span><span id="xxix.i-p55.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p56"></span>**6.** *Thou art a mighty prince among us*
 <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) The Hittites gratuitously offer
a burying-place to Abraham wherever he might please to choose one. They
testify that they do this, as a tribute to his virtues. We have before
seen, that the Hebrews give a divine title to anything which excels.
Therefore we are to understand by the expression, ‘a prince of God,’ a
person of great and singular excellency. And they properly signalize him
whom they reverence for his virtues, with this eulogium; thereby
testifying, that they ascribe to God alone, whatever virtues in men are
deserving of praise and reverence. Now some seed of piety manifests
itself in the Hittites, by thus doing honor to Abraham, whom they
acknowledge to be adorned with rare gifts of the Spirit of God. For
profane and brutal men tread under foot, with barbarous contempt, every
excellent gift of God, as swine do pearls. And yet we know with how many
vices those nations were defiled; how much greater then, and more
disgraceful is our ingratitude, if we give no honor to the image of God,
when it shines before our eyes? Abraham’s sanctity of manners procures
him such favor with the Hittites, that they do not envy his preeminence
among them; what excuse then is there for us, if we hold in less esteem
those virtues in which the majesty of God is conspicuous? Truly their
madness is diabolical, who not only despise the favors of God, but even
ferociously oppose them.

<span id="xxix.i-p58"></span><span id="xxix.i-p58.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p59"></span>**7.** *And Abraham stood up* . He declines
the favor offered by the Hittites, as, some suppose, with this design,
that he might not lay himself under obligation to them in so small a
matter. But he rather wished to show, in this way, that he would receive
no gratuitous possession from those inhabitants who were to be ejected
by the hand of Gods in order that he might succeed in their place: for
he always kept all his thoughts fixed on God, so that he far preferred
His bare promise, to present dominion over the land. Moses also commends
the modesty of the holy man, when he says that he ‘rose up to do
reverence to the people of the land.’  <span
id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) As to the use of the word signifying
‘to adore,’ it is simply taken for the reverence, which any one
declares, either by bowing the knee, or any other gesture of the body.
This may be paid to men, as well as to God, but for a different end; men
mutually either bend the knee, or bow the head, before each other, for
the sake of civil honor; but if the same thing be done to them, for the
sake of religion, it is profanation. For religion allows of no other
worship them that of the true God. And they childishly trifle who make a
pretext for their idolatry, in the words <span
id="xxix.i-p60.3"></span>*dulia* and <span
id="xxix.i-p60.4"></span>*latria*,  <span
id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) since the Scripture, in general terms,
forbids adoration to be transferred to men. But lest any one should be
surprised that Abraham acted so suppliantly, and so submissively, we
must be aware that it was done from common custom and use. For it is
well known that the Orientals were immoderate in their use of
ceremonies. If we compare the Greeks or Italians with ourselves, we are
more sparing in the use of them than they. But Aristotle, in speaking of
the Asiatics and other barbarians notes this fault, that they abound too
much in adorations. Wherefore we must not measure the honor which
Abraham paid to the princes of the land by our customs.

<span id="xxix.i-p62"></span><span id="xxix.i-p62.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p63"></span>**8.** *If it be in your mind* . Abraham
constitutes them his advocates with Ephron, to persuade him to sell the
double cave.  <span id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) Some suppose the
cave to have been so formed that one part was above, and the other
below. Let every one be at liberty to adopt what opinion he pleases; I,
however, rather suppose, that there was one entrance, but that within,
the cave was divided by a middle partition. It is more pertinent to
remarks that Abraham, by offering a full price, cultivated and
maintained equity. Where is there one to be found, who, in buying, and
in other business, does not eagerly pursue his own advantage at
another’s cost? For while the seller sets the price at twice the worth
of a thing, that he may extort as much as possible from the buyer, and
the buyers in return, by shuffling, attempts to reduce it to a low
price, there is no end of bargaining. And although avarice has specious
pretexts, it yet causes those who make contracts with each other, to
forget the claims of equity and justice. This also, finally deserves to
be noticed; that Abraham often declares that he was buying the field for
a place of sepulture. And Moses is the more minute in this matter, that
we may learn, with our father Abraham, to raise our minds to the hope of
the resurrection. He saw the half of himself taken away; but because he
was certain that his wife was not exiled from the kingdom of God, he
hides her dead body in the tomb, until he and she should be gathered
together.

<span id="xxix.i-p66"></span><span id="xxix.i-p66.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p67"></span>**11.** *Hear me* . Although Ephron
earnestly insisted upon giving the field freely to Abraham, the holy man
adheres to his purpose, and at length compels him, by his entreaties, to
sell the field. Ephron, in excusing himself, says that the price was too
small for Abraham to insist upon giving; yet he estimates it at four
hundred shekels. Now, since Josephus says that the shekel of the
sanctuary was worth four Attic drachms, if he is speaking of these, we
gather from the computation of Budaeus that the price of the field was
about two hundred and fifty pounds of French money; if we understand the
common shekel, it will be half that amount. Abraham was not so
scrupulous but that he would have received a greater gift, if there had
not been a sufficient reason to prevent him. He had been presented with
considerable gifts both by the king of Egypt and the king of Gerar, but
he observed this rule; that he would neither receive all *things* , nor
in all *places* , nor from all *persons* . And I have lately explained,
that he bought the field, in order that he might not possess a foot of
land, by the gift of any man.

<span id="xxix.i-p68"></span><span id="xxix.i-p68.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p69"></span>**16.** *And Abraham weighed to Ephron the
silver* . I know not what had come into Jerome’s mind, when he says,
that one letter was abstracted from Ephron’s name, after he had been
persuaded, by Abraham’s entreaties, to receive money for the field;
because, by the sale of the sepulcher, his virtue was maimed or
diminished: for, in fact, the name of Ephron is found written in the
very same manner, after that event, as before. Nor ought it to be
imputed to Ephron as a fault, that, being pressed, he took the lawful
price for his estate; when he had been prepared liberally to give it. If
there was any sin in the case, Abraham must bear the whole blame. But
who shall dare to condemn a just sale, in which, on both sides,
religion, good faith, and equity, are maintained? Abraham, it is argued,
bought the field for the sake of having a sepulcher. But ought Ephron on
that account to give it freely, and under the pretext of a sepulcher, to
be defrauded of his right? We see here, then, nothing but mere trifling.
The Canonists, however, — preposterous and infatuated as they are, —
rashly laying hold of the expressions of Jerome, have determined that it
is a prodigious sacrilege to sell sepulchres. Yet, in the meantime, all
the Papal sacrificers securely exercise this traffic: and while they
acknowledge the cemetery to be a common sepulcher, they suffer no grave
to be dug, unless the price be paid.

<span id="xxix.i-p70"></span>*Current money with the merchant* . Moses
speaks thus, because money is a medium of mutual communication between
men. It is principally employed in buying and selling merchandise.
Whereas Moses says, in the close of the chapter, that the field was
confirmed by the Hittites to Abraham for a possession; the sense is,
that the purchase was publicly attested; for although a private person
sold it, yet the people were present, and ratified the contract between
the two parties.
