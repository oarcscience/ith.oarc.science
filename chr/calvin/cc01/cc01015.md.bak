<span id="xvi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 10.

<span id="xvi.i"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p1"></span><span id="xvi.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
10:1-32](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#001.md)<span id="xvi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p2"></span>**1.** Now these *are* the generations of the
sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after
the flood.

<span id="xvi.i-p3"></span>**1.** Porro istae sunt generationes filiorum
Noah, Sem, Cham, et Jepheth: quibus nati sunt filii post diluvium.

<span id="xvi.i-p4"></span>**2.** The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog,
and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

<span id="xvi.i-p5"></span>**2.** Filii Jepheth, Gomer, et Magog, et
Madai, et Javan, et Thubal, et Mesech, et Thiras.

<span id="xvi.i-p6"></span>**3.** And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and
Riphath, and Togarmah.

<span id="xvi.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et filii Gomer, Ascenas, et Riphath,
et Thogarmah.

<span id="xvi.i-p8"></span>**4.** And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and
Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

<span id="xvi.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et filii Javan, Elisah, et Tharsis,
Chitthim, Dodanim.

<span id="xvi.i-p10"></span>**5.** By these were the isles of the
Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their
families, in their nations.

<span id="xvi.i-p11"></span>**5.** Ab istis separatae sunt insulae
Gentium secundum terras suas, singulae secundum linguam suam, secundum
familias suas, in gentibus suis.

<span id="xvi.i-p12"></span>**6.** And the sons of Ham; Cush, and
Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

<span id="xvi.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et filii Cham, Chus, et Misraim, et
Phut, et Chenaan.

<span id="xvi.i-p14"></span>**7.** And the sons of Cush; Seba, and

Sabthah, et Rahamah, et Sabtecha. Filii autem Rahamah, Seba, et Dedan.

<span id="xvi.i-p16"></span>**8.** And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be
a mighty one in the earth.

<span id="xvi.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et Chus genuit Nimrod: ipse coepit
esse potens in terra:

<span id="xvi.i-p18"></span>**9.** He was a mighty hunter before the
LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the
LORD.

<span id="xvi.i-p19"></span>**9.** Ipse fuit potens in venatione coram
Jehova: idcirco dicitur, Sicut Nimrod poteus venatione coram Jehova.

<span id="xvi.i-p20"></span>**10.** And the beginning of his kingdom was
Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

<span id="xvi.i-p21"></span>**10.** Et fuit principium regni illius
Babel, et Erech, et Achad, et Chalneh, in terra Sinhar.

<span id="xvi.i-p22"></span>**11.** Out of that land went forth Asshur,
and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

<span id="xvi.i-p23"></span>**11.** E terra illa egressus est Assur, et
aedificavit Nineven, et Rehoboth civitatem, et Chelah,

<span id="xvi.i-p24"></span>**12** . And Resen between Nineveh and
Calah: the same *is* a great city

<span id="xvi.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et Resen inter Nineven et inter
Chelah; ipsa est civitas magna.

<span id="xvi.i-p26"></span>**13.** And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim,
and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

<span id="xvi.i-p27"></span>**13.** Misraim autem genuit Ludim, et
Hanamim, et Lehabim, et Naphthuhim,

<span id="xvi.i-p28"></span>**14.** And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of
whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.

<span id="xvi.i-p29"></span>**14.** Et Pathrusim, et Casluhim, unde
egressi sunt Pelistim, et Chaphthorim.

<span id="xvi.i-p30"></span>**15.** And Canaan begat Sidon his
firstborn, and Heth,

<span id="xvi.i-p31"></span>**15.** Et Chenaan genuit Sidon primogenitum
suum, et Heth,

<span id="xvi.i-p32"></span>**16**. And the Jebusite, and the Amorite,
and the Girgasite,

<span id="xvi.i-p33"></span>**16.** Et Jebusi, et Emori, et Girgasi,

<span id="xvi.i-p34"></span>**17.** And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and
the Sinite,

<span id="xvi.i-p35"></span>**17.** Et Hivvi, et Arci, et Sini,

<span id="xvi.i-p36"></span>**18.** And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite,
and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites
spread abroad.

<span id="xvi.i-p37"></span>**18.** Et Arvadi, et Semari, et Hamathi: et
postea sparsae sunt familiae Chenaanaei.

<span id="xvi.i-p38"></span>**19.** And the border of the Canaanites was
from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto
Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

<span id="xvi.i-p39"></span>**19.** Et fuit terminus Chenaanaei a Sidon
ingrediente to Gerar usque ad Hazzah, donec ingrediaris Sedom et
Hamorah, et Admah, et Seboim, usque ad Lasah.

<span id="xvi.i-p40"></span>**20.** These *are* the sons of Ham, after
their families, after their tongues, in their countries, *and* in their
nations.

<span id="xvi.i-p41"></span>**20.** Isti filii Cham per familias suas,
per linguas suas, in terris suis, in gentibus suis.

<span id="xvi.i-p42"></span>**21.** Unto Shem also, the father of all
the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were
*children* born.

<span id="xvi.i-p43"></span>**21.** Ipsi quoque Sem soboles, etiam ipse
*fuit* pater omnium filiorum Eber, frater Jepheth major.

<span id="xvi.i-p44"></span>**22.** The children of Shem; Elam, and
Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.

<span id="xvi.i-p45"></span>**22.** Filii Sem, Helam, et Assur, et
Arphachsad, et Lud, et Aram.

<span id="xvi.i-p46"></span>**23.** And the children of Aram; Uz, and
Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

<span id="xvi.i-p47"></span>**23.** Et filii Aram, Hus, et Hul, et
Gether, et Mas.

<span id="xvi.i-p48"></span>**24.** And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah
begat Eber.

<span id="xvi.i-p49"></span>**24.** Et Arphachsad genuit Selah, et Selah
genuit Eber.

<span id="xvi.i-p50"></span>**25.** And unto Eber were born two sons:
the name of one *was* Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and
his brother’s name *was* Joktan.

<span id="xvi.i-p51"></span>**25.** Et ipsi Eber nati sunt duo filii:
nomen unius Peleg, quia in diebus ejus divisa est terra: et nomen
fratris ejus Joctan.

<span id="xvi.i-p52"></span>**26.** And Joktan begat Almodad, and
Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

<span id="xvi.i-p53"></span>**26.** Et Joctan genuit Almodad, et Seleph,
et Hasarmaveth, et Jarah,

<span id="xvi.i-p54"></span>**27.** And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

<span id="xvi.i-p55"></span>**27.** Et Hadoram, et Uzal, et Diclah,

<span id="xvi.i-p56"></span>**28.** And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

<span id="xvi.i-p57"></span>**28.** Et Hobal, et Abimael, et Seba,

<span id="xvi.i-p58"></span>**29.** And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab:
all these *were* the sons of Joktan.

<span id="xvi.i-p59"></span>**29.** Et Ophir, et Havilah, et Jobab:
omnes isti filii Joctan.

<span id="xvi.i-p60"></span>**30.** And their dwelling was from Mesha,
as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.

<span id="xvi.i-p61"></span>**30.** Et fuit habitatio eorum a Mesah,
donec ingrediaris Sephar, montem Orientis.

<span id="xvi.i-p62"></span>**31.** These *are* the sons of Shem, after
their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their
nations.

<span id="xvi.i-p63"></span>**31.** Isti filii Sem per familias suas,
per linguas suas, in terris suis, in gentibus suis.

<span id="xvi.i-p64"></span>**32.** These *are* the families of the sons
of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were
the nations divided in the earth after the flood.

<span id="xvi.i-p65"></span>**32.** Istae familiae filiorum Noah per
generationes suas in gentibus suis: et ab istis divisae sunt gentes in
terra post diluvium.

<span id="xvi.i-p66"></span> 

<span id="xvi.i-p67"></span><span id="xvi.i-p67.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p68"></span>**1.** *These* *are* *the* *generations* .
If any one pleases more accurately to examine the genealogies related by
Moses in this and the following chapter, I do not condemn his industry.
 <span id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md) And some interpreters have not
unsuccessfully applied their diligence and study to this point. Let them
enjoy, as far as I am concerned the reward of their labors. It shall,
however, suffice for me briefly to allude to those things which I deem
more useful to be noticed, and for the sake of which I suppose these
genealogies to have been written by Moses. First, in these bare names we
have still some fragment of the history of the world; and the next
chapter will show how many years intervened between the date of the
deluge and the time when God made his covenant with Abraham. This second
commencement of mankind is especially worthy to be known; and detestable
is the ingratitude of those, who, when they had heard, from their
fathers and grandfathers of the wonderful restoration of the world in so
short a time, yet voluntarily became forgetful of the grace and the
salvation of God. Even the memory of the deluge was by the greater part
entirely lost. Very few cared by what means or for what end they had
been preserved. Many ages afterwards, seeing that the wicked
forgetfulness of men had rendered them callous to the judgment and mercy
of God, the door was opened to the lies of Satan by whose artifice it
came to pass, that heathen poets scattered abroad futile and even
noxious fables, by which the truth respecting God’s works was
adulterated. The goodness of God, therefore, wonderfully triumphed over
the wickedness of men, in having granted a prolongation of life to
beings so ungrateful, brutal, and barbarous. Now, to captious men, (who
yet do not think it absurd to refuse to acknowledge a Creator of the
world,) such a sudden increase of mankind seems incredible, and
therefore they ridicule it as fabulous. I grant, indeed, that if we
choose to estimate what Moses relates by our own reason, it may be
regarded as a fable; but they act very perversely who do not attend to
the design of the Holy Spirit. For what else, I ask, did the Spirit
intend, than that the offspring of three men should be increased, not by
natural means, or in a common manner, but by the unwonted exercise of
the power of God, for the purpose of replenishing the earth far and
wide? They who regard this miracle of God as fabulous on account of its
magnitude, should much less believe that Noah and his sons, with their
wives, breathed in the waters, and that animals lived nearly a whole
year without sun and air. This then, is a gigantic madness,  <span
id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) to hold up to ridicule what is said
respecting the restoration of the human race: for there the admirable
power of God is displayed. How much better would it be, in the history
of these events, — which Noah saw with his own eyes, and not without
great admiration, — to behold God, to admire his power, to celebrate his
goodness, and to acknowledge his hand, not less filled with mysteries in
restoring, than in creating the world? We must, however, observe, that
in the three catalogues which Moses furnishes,  <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) all the heads of the families are not
enumerated; but those only, among the grandsons of Noah, are recorded,
who were the princes of nations. For as any one excelled among his
brethren, in talent, valor, industry, or other endowments, he obtained
for himself a name and power, so that others, resting under his shadow,
freely conceded to him the priority. Therefore, among the sons of
Japheth, of Ham, and of Shem, Moses enumerates those only who had been
celebrated, and by whose names the people were called. Moreover,
although no certain cause appears why Moses begins at Japheth, and
descends in the second place to Ham, yet it is probable that the first
place is given to the sons of Japheth, because they, having wandered
over many regions, and having even crossed the sea, had receded farther
from their country: and since these nations were less known to the Jews,
therefore he alludes to them briefly. He assigns the second place to the
sons of Ham, the knowledge of whom, on account of their vicinity, was
more familiar to the Jews. But since he had determined to weave the
history of the Church in one continuous narrative, he postpones the
progeny of Shem, from which the church flowed, to the last place.
Wherefore, the order in which they are mentioned is not that of dignity;
since Moses puts those first, whom he wished slightly to pass over, as
obscure. Besides, we must observe, that the children of this world are
exalted for a time, so that the whole earth seems as if it were made for
their benefit, but their glory being transient vanishes away; while the
Church, in an ignoble and despised condition, as if creeping on the
ground, is yet divinely preserved, until at length, in his own time, God
shall lift up her head. I have already declared that I leave to others
the scrupulous investigation of the names here mentioned. The reason of
certain of them is manifest from the Scripture, such as Cush, Mizraim,
Madai, Canaan, and the like: in respect to some others there are
probable conjectures; in others, the obscurity is too great to allow of
any certain conclusion; and those figments which interpreters adduce
are, in part, very much distorted and forced; in part, vapid, and
without any fair pretext. Undoubtedly it seems to be the part of a
frivolous curiosity to seek for certain and distinct nations in each of
these names.  <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) When Moses says,
that the islands of the Gentiles were divided by the sons of Japheth, we
understand that the regions beyond the sea were parted among them. For
Greece and Italy, and other continental lands, — as well as Rhodes and
Cyprus, — are called islands by the Hebrews, because the sea interposed.
Whence we infer that we are sprung from those nations.

<span id="xvi.i-p73"></span><span id="xvi.i-p73.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p74"></span>**8.** *And* *Cush* *begat* *Nimrod* . It is
certain that Cush was the prince of the Ethiopians. Moses relates the
singular history of his son Nimrod, because he began to be eminent in an
unusual degree. Moreover, I thus interpret the passage, that the
condition of men was at that time moderate; so that if some excelled
others, they yet did not on that account domineer, nor assume to
themselves royal power; but being content with a degree of dignity,
governed others by civil laws and had more of authority than power. For
Justin, from Trogus Pompeius, declares this to have been the most
ancient condition of the world. Now Moses says, that Nimrod, as if
forgetting that he was a man, took possession of a higher post of honor.
Noah was at that time yet living, and was certainly great and venerable
in the eyes of all. There were also other excellent men; but such was
their moderation, that they cultivated equality with their inferiors,
who yielded them a spontaneous rather than a forced reverence. The
ambition of Nimrod disturbed and broke through the boundaries of this
reverence. Moreover, since it sufficiently appears that, in this
sentence of Moses, the tyrant is branded with an eternal mark of infamy,
we may hence conclude, how highly pleasing to God is a mild
administration of affairs among men. And truly, whosoever remembers that
he is a man, will gladly cultivate the society of others. With respect
to the meaning of the terms, <span id="xvi.i-p74.1"></span>דיצ ( *tsaid*
,) properly signifies *hunting* , as the Hebrew grammarians state; yet
it is often taken for *food*  <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md)
But whether Moses says that he was robust in hunting, or in violently
seizing upon prey; he metaphorically intimates that he was a furious
man, and approximated to beasts rather than to men. The expression,
“Before the Lord,”  <span id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) seems to me
to declare that Nimrod attempted to raise himself above the order of
men; just as proud men become transported by a vain self-confidence,
that they may look down as from the clouds upon others.

<span id="xvi.i-p77"></span>*Wherefore* *it* *is* *said*  <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) Since the verb is in the future tense,
it may be thus explained, Nimrod was so mighty and imperious that it
would be proper to say of any powerful tyrant, that he is another
Nimrod. Yet the version of Jerome is satisfactory, that thence it became
a proverb concerning the powerful and the violent, that they were like
Nimrod.  <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) Nor do I doubt that God
intended the first author of tyranny to be transmitted to odium by every
tongue.

<span id="xvi.i-p80"></span><span id="xvi.i-p80.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p81"></span>**10.** *And* *the* *beginning* *of* *his*
*kingdom* *was* *Babel* . Moses here designates the seat of Nimrod’s
empire. He also declares that four cities were subject to him; it is
however uncertain whether he was the founder of them, or had thence
expelled their rightful lords. And although mention is elsewhere made of
Calneh,  <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md) yet Babylon was the
most celebrated of all. I do not however think that it was of such wide
extent, or of such magnificent structure, as the profane historians
relate. But since the region was among the first and most fruitful, it
is possible that the convenience of the situation would afterwards
invite others to enlarge the city. Wherefore Aristotle, in his
*Politics* , taking it out of the rank of cities, compares it to a
province. Hence it has arisen, that many declare it to have been the
work of Semiramis, by whom others say that it was not built but only
adorned and joined together by bridges. The land of Shinar is added as a
note of discrimination, because there was also another Babylon in Egypt,
which is now called Cairo.  <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) But
it is asked, how was Nimrod the tyrant of Babylon, when Moses in the
following chapter, <span id="xvi.i-p83.2"></span>[Ge
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001.md)<span id="xvi.i-p83.2"></span>
subjoins, that a tower was begun there, which obtained this name from
the confusion of tongues? Some suppose that a *hysteron* *proteron*
 <span id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) is here employed, and that what
Moses is afterwards about to relate concerning the building of the tower
was prior in the order of time. Moreover, they add, that because the
building of the tower was disastrously obstructed, their design was
changed to that of building a city. But I rather think there is a
*prolepsis* ; and that Moses called the city by the same name, which
afterwards was imposed by a more recent event. The reason of the
conjecture is that probably, at this time, the inhabitants of that
place, who had engaged in so vast a work, were numerous. It might also
happen, that Nimrod, solicitous about his own fame and power, inflamed
their insane desire by this pretext, that some famous monument should be
erected in which their everlasting memory might remain. Still, since it
is the custom of the Hebrews to prosecute more diffusely, afterwards,
what they had touched upon briefly, I do not entirely reject the former
opinion.  <span id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md)

<span id="xvi.i-p86"></span><span id="xvi.i-p86.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p87"></span>**11.** *Out* *of* *that* *land* *went*
*forth* *Asshur* . It is credible that Asshur was one of the posterity
of Shem. And the opinion has been commonly received, that he is here
mentioned, because, when he was dwelling, in the neighborhood of Nimrod,
he was violently expelled thence. In this manner, Moses would mark the
barbarous ferocity of Nimrod. And truly these are the accustomed fruits
of a greatness which does not keep within bounds; whence has arisen the
old proverb, ‘Great kingdoms are great robberies.’ It is indeed
necessary that some should preside over others; but where ambition, and
the desire of rising higher than is right, are rampant, they not only
draw with them the greatest and most numerous injuries, but also verge
closely upon the dissolution of human society. Yet I rather adopt the
opinion of those who say that Asshur is not, in this place, the name of
a man, but of a country which derived its appellation from him; and thus
the sense will be, that Nimrod, not content with his large and opulent
kingdom, gave the reins to his cupidity, and pushed the boundaries of
his empire even into Assyria, where he also built new cities.  <span
id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) The passage in Isaiah (<span
id="xvi.i-p88.1"></span>[Isa
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#013)<span id="xvi.i-p88.1"></span>.md)
is alone opposed to this opinion, where he says, ‘Behold the land of the
Chaldeans, the people was not, Asshur founded it when they inhabited the
deserts, and he reduced it to ruin.’  <span
id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md) For the prophet seems to say, that
cities were built by the Assyrians in Chaldea, whereas previously, its
inhabitants were wandering and scattered as in a desert. But it may be,
that the prophet speaks of other changes of these kingdoms, which
occurred afterwards. For, at the time in which the Assyrians maintained
the sovereignty, seeing that they flourished in unbounded wealth, it is
credible that Chaldea, which they had subjected to themselves was so
adorned and increased by a long peace, that it might seem to have been
founded by them. And we know, that when the Chaldeans, in their turn,
seized on the empire, Babylon was exalted on the ruins of Nineveh.

<span id="xvi.i-p92"></span><span id="xvi.i-p92.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p93"></span>**21.** *Unto* *Shem* *also* *,* *the*
*father* *of* *all* *the* *children* *of* *Eber* . Moses, being about to
speak of the sons of Shem, makes a brief introduction, which he had not
done in reference to the others. Nor was it without reason; for since
this was the race chosen by God, he wished to sever it from other
nations by some special mark. This also is the reason why he expressly
styles him the ‘father of the sons of Eber,’ and the elder brother of
Japheth.  <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) For the benediction of
Shem does not descend to all his grandchildren indiscriminately, but
remains in one family. And although the grandchildren themselves of Eber
declined from the true worship of God, so that the Lord might justly
have disinherited them; yet the benediction was not extinguished, but
only buried for a season, until Abraham was called, in honor of whom
this singular dignity is ascribed to the race and name of Eber. For the
same cause, mention is made of Japheth, in order that the promise may be
confirmed, ‘God shall speak gently unto Japheth, that he may dwell in
the tents of Shem.’ Shem is not here called the brother of Ham, inasmuch
as the latter was cut off from the fraternal order, and was debarred his
own right. Fraternity remained only between them and Japheth; because,
although they were separated, God had engaged that he would cause them
to return from this dissension into union. As it respects the name
*Eber* , they who deny it to be a proper name, but deduce it from the
word which signifies to *pass over* , are more than sufficiently refuted
by this passage alone.

<span id="xvi.i-p69"></span> For ample information on this interesting
subject, which the general plan of Calvin’s Commentary scarcely allowed
him fully to investigate, the reader cannot do better than consult Dr.
Wells’ Geography of the Old Testament, chap. 3 From certain expressiones
contained in the Mosaic account here given, of the first settlement of
nations after the flood, it is clear that the records of the chapter now
before us, have reference to the state of things after the confusion of
tongues at the building of the Tower of Babel, though the narration of
this event occurs in the chapter following; for the settlements are said
to be made “according to their languages.” But we know that before the
attempt to build the tower, the whole earth was of “one language and of
one speech;” and therefore the events here placed first, in the order of
narration, were subsequent in the order of time. It may be proper here
to observe, that according to the division of the earth into three great
portions, Europe, Asia, and Africa, speaking generally, Japheth was the
progenitor of the Europeans, Shem of the Asiatics, and Ham of the
Africans. Yet this line of demarcation is not intended to be accurately
drawn. The whole of Lesser Asia, for instance, falls within the province
of the sons of Japheth; and Arabia within that of the sons of Ham. —

the elder brother, from verse 2 to verse 6; the second, to the sons of
Ham, from verse 6 to verse 21; the third, to the sons of Shem, from 21
to the end. Shem, though generally named first as a mark of Divine
favor, is here placed last, because the subsequent history of Moses
principally concerns this race; as Calvin properly argues. — *Ed*.

<span id="xvi.i-p72"></span> Doubtless there is truth in these remarks
of Calvin. Yet he seems to carry his objection too far. For it is one of
the strongest possible confirmations of the truth of the Mosaic history,
that (notwithstanding some inevitable obscurity) there should be such a
mass of undeniable evidence still existing, that the world was really
divided in the manner here described. Far more nations than Calvin
supposed may, with the highest degree of probability, be traced upward
to the progenitors whose names are here recorded. See Wells’ Geography,
Mede’s Works, and Bishop Patrick’s Commentary. A list of the names, with
the supposed corresponding nations, is also given in the Commentary of
Professor Bush on this chapter. The following extract from
Hengstenberg’s ‘Egypt, and the Books of Moses,’ also bears upon this
point: — “It has often been asserted that the genealogical table in
<span id="xvi.i-p72.2"></span>[Genesis
10](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#000.md)<span id="xvi.i-p72.2"></span>.
cannot be from Moses: since so extended a knowledge of nations lies far
beyond the geographical horizon of the Mosaic age. This hypothesis must
now be considered as exploded. The new discoveries and investigations in
Egypt have shown that they maintained, even from the most ancient times,
a vigorous commerce with other nations, and sometimes with very distant
nations. ...But not merely, in general, do the investigations in
Egyptian antiquities favor the belief that Moses was the author of the
account in this tenth chapter of Genesis. On the Egyptian monuments,
those especially which represent the conquests of the ancient Pharaohs
over foreign nations, ... not a few names have been found which
correspond with those contained in the chapter before us.” The learned
author then proceeds to adduce instances in proof of his position, which
the reader may consult with advantage. — See Hengstenberg’s Egypt, and
the Books of Moses, chap. v2 p. 195 — *Ed*.

is as follows: —

<span id="xvi.i-p90"></span>“Behold the land of the Chaldeans;  
This people was of no account;  
(The Assyrian founded it for the inhabitants of the desert;  
They raised the watch-towers, they set up the palaces thereof;)  
This people hath reduced her to ruin.”

<span id="xvi.i-p91"></span>See also his note on this passage, which
accords with Calvin’s supposition, that the prophet referred to some
subsequent period of history. — *Ed*.

<span id="xvi.i-p94"></span> In the English translation it is, ‘The
brother of Japheth the elder.’ The balance of proof seems to lie in
favor of the English translation, and gives the seniority to Japheth.
Shem is supposed to be placed first, not on account of his age, but
because his was the chosen seed. — *Ed*.
