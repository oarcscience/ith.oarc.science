<span id="iv"></span>

<span id="iv-p1"></span>An Epigram upon the Translation

<span id="iv-p2"></span>of

<span id="iv-p3"></span>M. Calvin’s Commentary

<span id="iv-p4"></span>upon the Prophecy of Isaiah.

<span id="iv-p5"></span>Thrice happy (England) if thou knewest thy
bliss,  
Since Christ’s eternal Gospel in thee shined  
Thou art. His beetle-blind that sees not this,  
Brutishly ingrate that with a thankful mind  
Doth not acknowledge Gods great Grace herein,  
And learn thereby for to forsake his sin.

<span id="iv-p6"></span>God’s word hath long in thee been soundly
taught,  
The sound thereof hath rung throughout the Land,  
And many a Soul by Fishers net been caught,  
Which erst lay thrall in Satan’s cruel band:  
This favour great by none can be expressed,  
But such as have it felt in their own breast.

<span id="iv-p7"></span>Thy native sons in thine own bowels bred,  
Like faithful Shepherds have done worthily,  
And thee with store of heavenly Manna fed,  
Forcing the Wolves to leave their cruelty,  
To slink aside, and hide themselves in holes,  
In caves and dells, like pur-blind Backs and Moles.

<span id="iv-p8"></span>Tyndall, Frith, Philpot, father Latimer,  
The Gospel preached by word, by life, by death:  
Ivel, Fox, Reynolds, Fulk, and Whitaker  
To second them have spent their vital breath.  
In hot pursuit of that great Romish Bore,  
Who spoiled quite this English vine before.

<span id="iv-p9"></span>I spare to speak of Deerings silver voice,  
Of Greenhams zeal, of Perkins labours sound,  
Of hundreds more of Zion-builders choice,  
The like whereof can scarce elsewhere be found:  
Such ground-work they of Gods truth here have placed  
As never shall by Hels whole force be razt.

<span id="iv-p10"></span>Besides all these, of Sorrel Lights the
chief,  
Beza, and Vrinus, many other more,  
Martyr, Musculus, for thy more relief  
Are seen in English weed abroad to go  
From place to place in every Shire and Torwne,  
To teach the Truth and throw all Errors down.

<span id="iv-p11"></span>And here presented is unto thy sight  
The Royal Prophet Esaias Evangel:  
For so me thinks I may it terme aright,  
That Prince of holy Prophets doth so well,  
So likely Christ’s whole history presage,  
As if h’ had lived in that same very Age.

<span id="iv-p12"></span>Whose Oracles great Calvin doth unfold  
In thine own native Tongue for thy Souls health.  
Here maist thou gather precious Stones and Gold,  
And store up heaps of Heavenly lasting wealth;

<span id="iv-p13"></span>Here maist thou find with very little Pain  
Which would’st not lose for thousand Worlds again.  
Here maist thou see the black-mouthed Atheists  
Confounded quite by Demonstration clear;  
The cunning Papist put unto his shifts,  
And made in his right Colours to appear;  
Here’s Christ, his Truth, and Life, thee set before,  
Heavens Gates set open wide: what would’st thou more?

<span id="iv-p14"></span>By Francnis Hering, Doctor in Physic.
