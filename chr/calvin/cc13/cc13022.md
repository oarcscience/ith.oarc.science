<span id="xxiii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 16

<span id="xxiii.i"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p1"></span>Isaiah Chapter 16:1-14

<span id="xxiii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the
land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of
Zion.

<span id="xxiii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Mittite agnum dominatori terrae de
petra deserti ad montem filiae Sion.

<span id="xxiii.i-p4"></span>**2.** For it shall be, *that* as a
wandering bird cast out of the nest, *so* the daughters of Moab shall be
at the fords of Arnon.

<span id="xxiii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Erit autem sicut avis emissa,
recedens e nido: ita erunt filiae Moab ad transitus Arnon.

<span id="xxiii.i-p6"></span>**3.** Take counsel, execute judgment; make
thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noon-day; hide the outcasts;
bewray not him that wandereth.

<span id="xxiii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Cogite consilium, facite judicium;
pone sicut noctem umbram tuam in medio meridiei; absconde expulsos,
profugum ne prodas.

<span id="xxiii.i-p8"></span>**4.** Let mine outcasts dwell with thee,
Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the
extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are
consumed out of the land.

<span id="xxiii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Peregrinentur apud te ejecti mei.
Moab, sis illis latibulum a facie vastatoris; quoniam cessavit emunctor,
finitus est vastator, consumptus est conculcator e terra.

<span id="xxiii.i-p10"></span>**5.** And in mercy shall the throne be
established; and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of
David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.

<span id="xxiii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et praeparabitur in misericordia
solium, sedebitque super ipsum in firmitate, in tabernaculo David qui
judicet, et quaerat judicium, et acceleret justitiam.

<span id="xxiii.i-p12"></span>**6.** We have heard of the pride of Moab,
(he *is* very proud,) *even* of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his
wrath: *but* his lies *shall* not *be* so.

<span id="xxiii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Audivimus superbiam Moab (superbus
est valde) superbiam ejus, et arrogantiam ejus, et insolentiam (*vel,
indignationem*) ejus. Sed non rata erunt mendacia ejus.

<span id="xxiii.i-p14"></span>**7.** Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab,
every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye
mourn; surely *they are* stricken.

<span id="xxiii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Propterea ululabit Moab ad Moab,
totus ululabit, propter fundamenta Kir-hareseth; gemetis tantum
percussi.

<span id="xxiii.i-p16"></span>**8.** For the fields of Heshbon languish,
*and* the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the
principal plants thereof; they are come *even* unto Jazer, they wandered
*through* the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone
over the sea:

<span id="xxiii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Quoniam vites Hesbon excisae sunt,
vitis Sibma. Domini gentium conculcarunt eximias ejus propagines (*vel,
palmites*) quae usque ad Iazer pervenerant; erraverant usque ad
desertum, nobiles ejus plantae prostratae sunt, quae transibant mare.

<span id="xxiii.i-p18"></span>**9.** Therefore I will bewail with the
weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O
Heshbon, and Elealeh; for the shouting for thy summer-fruits, and for
thy harvest, is fallen.

<span id="xxiii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Propterea flebo in fletu Iazer
vitis Sibma; inebriabo te lachrymis meis Hesbon et Eleale; quoniam super
collectionem tuam, et super messem tuam irruet (*vel, cadet*) canticum.

<span id="xxiii.i-p20"></span>**10.** And gladness is taken away, and
joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no
singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out
no wine in *their* presses; I have made *their vintage*-shouting to
cease.

<span id="xxiii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Sublatum est gaudium et exultatio
ab agro fertili; in vineis non exultabitur, nec jubilabitur. Vinum in
torcularibus non calcabit calcator, canticum quiescere feci.

<span id="xxiii.i-p22"></span>**11.** Wherefore my bowels shall sound
like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-haresh.

<span id="xxiii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Propterea viscera mea super Moab
quasi cithara sonabunt, et interiora mea super Kir-hareseth.

<span id="xxiii.i-p24"></span>**12.** And it shall come to pass, when it
is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his
sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.

<span id="xxiii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et erit cum apparuerit fatigatum
esse Moab super excelsa, tunc veniet ad sanctuarium precandi causa; nec
proficiet.

<span id="xxiii.i-p26"></span>**13.** This *is* the word that the Lord
hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.

<span id="xxiii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Hoc est verbum quod protulit
Iehova super Moab ab hoc tempore.

<span id="xxiii.i-p28"></span>**14.** But now the Lord hath spoken,
saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory
of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the
remnant *shall be* very small *and* feeble.

<span id="xxiii.i-p29"></span>**14.** Nunc, inquam, locutus est Iehova,
dicens, Tres anni, quasi anni mercenarii; et tunc in ignominiam vertetur
gloria Moab, in tota multitudine ejus, quamvis multa; et reliquiae ejus
paucae, exiguae, et invalidae.

<span id="xxiii.i-p30"></span> 

<span id="xxiii.i-p31"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p31.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p32"></span>**1.** *Send ye a lamb.* Here the Prophet
scoffs at the Moabites for not acknowledging God at the proper time, but
recklessly waiting for the stroke of his hand, till they were completely
destroyed. It is, therefore, a condemnation of late repentance, when men
cannot be brought to obedience by any warnings, and continue in
obstinate opposition to God. Where the disease is incurable, an
exhortation of this kind is appropriate; and this ought to be carefully
observed, for both Jews and Christians misinterpret this passage.

<span id="xxiii.i-p33"></span>Jerome explains it as referring to Christ,
because he drew his birth from the Moabites, (<span
id="xxiii.i-p33.1"></span>[Ru 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#004.md)<span
id="xxiii.i-p33.1"></span>; <span id="xxiii.i-p33.2"></span>[Mt
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#005)<span id="xxiii.i-p33.2"></span>,.md)
from whom Ruth was descended; and that opinion has been adopted by
almost all Christians; as if the Prophet had said, “O Lord, though a
judgment so severe as this awaits the Moabites, still thou wilt not
utterly destroy them; for they will send thee *a Lamb, the ruler of the
world.”* But that interpretation, being destitute of plausibility, need
not be refuted.

<span id="xxiii.i-p34"></span>On the other hand, the Jews think that
these words were spoken because, while the Jews were in a depressed
condition, the Moabites ceased to pay the tribute which they owed them,
but that, after having prophesied about the restoration of the kingdom
of Judah, Isaiah likewise added an exhortation to remind them to
acknowledge their king. They even go so far as to say that it serves the
purpose of a royal edict, taking them to task for their disloyalty,
“Send the tribute which you owe.” But we nowhere read that the Moabites
were subjects or tributaries to the Jews, and there is no probability in
the conjecture. Nor does the passage which they quote (<span
id="xxiii.i-p34.1"></span>[2 Kings
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#006)<span id="xxiii.i-p34.1"></span>.md)
give them any support; for that passage relates to *the king of Israel*,
and expressly mentions *Ahab* and *Samaria*, who cherished, as we are
aware, the utmost hatred against the Jews.

<span id="xxiii.i-p35"></span>I therefore adhere to the interpretation
which I first noticed, as the true and natural interpretation; for the
design of the Prophet is to condemn the Moabites for not having repented
in due season, and to tell them that they will now in vain do what they
might easily have done formerly, and with great advantage to themselves.
We ought, therefore, to view it as spoken ironically, (<span
id="xxiii.i-p35.1"></span>εἰρωνικῶς,) *Send*; as if he had said that
there is no hope of pardon, that they will *send* in vain. When the
wicked are warned, they indolently disregard all exhortation; when they
are punished, they gaze around them with distressful looks, seeking
assistance in every direction, and trying every method of relief, but
unsuccessfully, for they gain no advantage. Isaiah, therefore,
reproaches them for obstinacy and rebellion, and shows that there will
be no time for repentance, when they meet with the destruction which
they deserve.

<span id="xxiii.i-p36"></span>*To the ruler of the world.* The opinion
of the Jews, that this denotes Hezekiah, is at variance with all reason;
for <span id="xxiii.i-p36.1"></span>ארץ (*eretz*) does not here denote a
particular country, but rather the whole *world*, of which he speaks in
general terms. The appellation *Ruler* must therefore be viewed as
referring to God himself. By *a* *lamb*, he means what was to be offered
in sacrifice; for even the Gentiles acknowledged that they worshipped
God when they offered sacrifices.

<span id="xxiii.i-p37"></span>*From the rock*  <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) *of the desert.* He gives the name of
*the rock of the desert* to the city, which is supposed to have been the
chief city of the Moabites;  <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md)
though it is possible that he intended to include the whole of the
country, and thus a part will be taken for the whole.

<span id="xxiii.i-p61"></span>*To the mountain of the daughter of Zion;*
that is, to God’s authorized temple, in which sacrifices were offered
according to the injunction of the Law. (<span
id="xxiii.i-p61.1"></span>[Deut. 12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#007.md)<span id="xxiii.i-p61.1"></span>;
<span id="xxiii.i-p61.2"></span>[2Ch
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2007.htm#012)<span id="xxiii.i-p61.2"></span>..md)
This is a remarkable passage against obstinate men, who set aside all
instruction, and fearlessly despise God, till they are visited by his
judgments.

<span id="xxiii.i-p62"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p62.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p63"></span>**2.** *It shall be as a bird let loose.*
 <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) The Prophet now shows what he
meant by the former mockery, that the Moabites ought not at that time to
think of *sending* sacrifices, because they will not be able to provide
for their safety in any other way than by leaving their native country.
By the metaphor of *birds* he describes the terror with which they shall
be struck, so that they will flee even at the rustling of a leaf. He
threatens that the Moabites, who had abused their tranquillity, shall
have a trembling and wearisome flight.

<span id="xxiii.i-p65"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p65.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p66"></span>**3.** *Assemble a council.*  <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) He proceeds with the same subject; for
if we wish rightly to understand this passage, we must set before our
minds the dreadful ruin of the Moabites. Their crimes are brought to
remembrance, that all may see more clearly how deservedly they are
punished. When everything was in their power, they freely indulged in
licentiousness, and would not listen to any reproofs; but now, when they
are deprived of everything, they groan, and seek remedies which are
nowhere to be found. The Lord deals with the reprobate in such a manner
that, in order to leave them without excuse, he bestows upon them, and
places in their hands, everything that they need; but when, through
their wicked passion, they have abused and turned everything to a wicked
purpose, he deprives them of all aid and support, and utterly destroys
them.

<span id="xxiii.i-p68"></span>*Execute judgment.* While the Moabites
enjoyed prosperity, they cared little about what was good and right;
while it was in their power to rule, and to have their kingdom
established, in a just manner, they abused their power for the purpose
of tyranny. Now that they were stripped of all authority, and were
exiles and fugitives, Isaiah ironically advises them to *assemble
councils* and *execute* *judgments*, which they had formerly overturned
through fraud and injustice. Isaiah has in view that time when all power
and authority was taken out of the hands of the Moabites. The upbraiding
is similar to that with which the Lord addresses Adam, (<span
id="xxiii.i-p68.1"></span>[Ge
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022)<span id="xxiii.i-p68.1"></span>,.md)
*Behold, Adam* *is become as one of us*, ridiculing him with the biting
taunt, that he was not satisfied with his exalted attainments, and
wished to rival God himself.

<span id="xxiii.i-p69"></span>In like manner, the Moabites, not
satisfied with their ornaments and wealth, wretchedly harassed and
plundered the Israelites and Jews, and formed wicked plans against them.
Having abused the excellent gift of God, they therefore deserved to have
this reproof addressed to them, which is equally applicable to all the
reprobate, who proudly vaunt in prosperity and barbarously abuse it for
harassing the godly. Seeing that they basely pollute those things which
the Lord had set apart to their proper use, it is right that they should
be deprived of them and reduced to the lowest poverty. We have instances
of this every day. How comes it that those who were raised to the
highest rank of honor fall down headlong, but because the Lord punishes
their tyrannical rule and their crimes? The Lord also ridicules their
upbraiding and reproachful language, their wailings, and even their
complaints; as when they exclaim, “O that I had the wealth which I once
enjoyed! O that I were restored to my former condition!” For then
repentance will be too late.

<span id="xxiii.i-p70"></span>*Make thy shadow.* The Moabites might, as
I have already hinted, have given some relief to the wretched Jews, when
they were harassed by the Assyrians; or, at least, if they had had a
spark of humanity, they ought to have protected the fugitives; but, on
the contrary, they persecuted them, and added to the weight of their
afflictions, which were already oppressive. It was highly proper that
the Moabites should be the subjects of that cruelty which they had
exercised towards others; that, when they had been driven from their
dwellings, and were exiles and wanderers, they should nowhere find any
solace, any *shadow* to shelter them from the heat; for why should they
enjoy the consolations which they had barbarously refused to others?

<span id="xxiii.i-p71"></span>*As the night in the midst of noon-day.*
 <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) By *noon-day* is here meant the
most scorching heat. This metaphor is frequently employed in Scripture,
that the Lord was *like a cloud at noon, and like a pillar* *of fire by
night*; for he once was so in the wilderness. (<span
id="xxiii.i-p72.1"></span>[Exod.
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#022.md)<span id="xxiii.i-p72.1"></span>;
<span id="xxiii.i-p72.2"></span>[Nu
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#014.md)<span id="xxiii.i-p72.2"></span>;
<span id="xxiii.i-p72.3"></span>[De
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#033)<span id="xxiii.i-p72.3"></span>..md)
This mode of expression, being customary, was retained by the Prophets,
though they did not relate the history.

<span id="xxiii.i-p73"></span>*Hide the banished.* He means the Jews,
whom the Assyrians persecuted and harassed, and whom the Moabites at the
same time treated cruelly. It was their duty to shelter and relieve the
fugitives, and especially those who fled to them for protection; but
seeing that they drove them out, it was proper that they should be
driven out in the same manner, and deprived of all assistance and
support; for it is a righteous sentence which the Lord pronounces, when
he enjoins that *the same measure* *which every one metes shall be
measured to him again*. (<span id="xxiii.i-p73.1"></span>[Deut.
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#019.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#021.md)<span id="xxiii.i-p73.1"></span>;
<span id="xxiii.i-p73.2"></span>[Mt
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002)<span id="xxiii.i-p73.2"></span>..md)
Now the Prophet calls on the Moabites to acknowledge their sins, so as
to confess that they are justly punished for their cruelty. Yet he
rather has the Jews in his eye, in order to inform them that God does
not disregard their afflictions, for they are told that he will be their
avenger.

<span id="xxiii.i-p74"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p74.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p75"></span>**4.** *Let mine outcasts dwell with thee,
Moab.* The Prophet addresses the *Moabites*, as if he were humbly
beseeching them in the name of the people at large. “You are neighbors,
related to us by blood; receive and assist those who are in distress:
and if you do not choose to assist, at least do them no harm.” God, who
usually undertakes the cause of his people, is represented by the
Prophet as if he performed the part of a suppliant. It is certain, that
the Moabites did not at all act in this manner towards the Jews, but, on
the contrary, that they joined their efforts with the enemies of the
Jews to do them injury. But, as I said a little before, the Prophet sets
before our eyes that justice which even nature demands, that the cruel
violation of it may be the more abhorred.

<span id="xxiii.i-p76"></span>This passage ought to be carefully
observed; for God shows how great is the care which he takes of his
people, since the injuries done to them affect him in the same manner as
if they had been done to himself; as he declares by Zechariah, that
*whenever they are touched, the apple of* *his eye is touched*. (<span
id="xxiii.i-p76.1"></span>[Zec
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008)<span id="xxiii.i-p76.1"></span>..md)
He *hears the groaning*, (<span id="xxiii.i-p76.2"></span>[Ps
102:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#020.md)<span
id="xxiii.i-p76.2"></span>,) and observes the tears, of wretched men who
call upon him; (<span id="xxiii.i-p76.3"></span>[Ps.
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#005.md), [Ps.
38:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#009)<span id="xxiii.i-p76.3"></span>;.md)
and though this be not always visible to us, yet in due season he shows
that he has heard them.

<span id="xxiii.i-p77"></span>Let us therefore learn from this passage
to be kind and dutiful to fugitives and exiles, and especially to
believers, who are banished for their confession of the word. No duty
can be more pleasing or acceptable to God; and, on the other hand,
nothing is more hateful or abominable in his sight than barbarity and
cruelty. If we wish to obtain any alleviation of our calamities, let us
be kind and compassionate, and not refuse assistance to the needy.

<span id="xxiii.i-p78"></span>Blessed, says he, is he that judgeth
wisely about the poor and needy; the Lord will deliver him in the evil
day.  
(<span id="xxiii.i-p78.2"></span>[Ps
41:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa041.htm#001)<span id="xxiii.i-p78.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xxiii.i-p79"></span>On the other hand,

<span id="xxiii.i-p80"></span>he shall have judgment without mercy who
hath showed no mercy. (<span id="xxiii.i-p80.1"></span>[Jas
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013)<span id="xxiii.i-p80.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xxiii.i-p81"></span>When God calls them *his banished*, this
may without impropriety be viewed as referring to punishment, as if he
said, that by a just judgment they were *banished* from the land of
Canaan, (<span id="xxiii.i-p81.1"></span>[De
28:64](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064.md)<span
id="xxiii.i-p81.1"></span>,) as he had so often threatened against them.
Yet undoubtedly he likewise means, that they continue to be under his
defense and protection, because, though they are banished and driven out
of their native country, still he acknowledges them to be his people.
That calamity which the Jews endured might be regarded as an evidence
that they were cast off; but the Lord acknowledges them to be *his
children*, though he chastises them severely. Hence we obtain a doctrine
full of consolation, that we are reckoned in the number of his children,
though sharp and heavy strokes are inflicted upon us.

<span id="xxiii.i-p82"></span>*For the extortioner hath ceased.*  <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) He now directs his discourse to the
Jews, and proceeds to comfort them, as he had done formerly, by showing
that, when their enemies shall be removed from the midst of them, the
banishment or ruin of their enemies will also relieve their own
calamities and distresses. Yet the former statements related chiefly to
the Jews, though the Prophet expressly addressed the Moabites. But at
that time he only threatened vengeance on enemies, while here he more
clearly promises consolation to his people; as if he had said, “Thou
thoughtest, O Moab, that my people were utterly ruined: but I will
restrain the enemies, and put an end to that affliction. Thou shalt
therefore perish; but my people shall at length be delivered from those
dreadful calamities.”

<span id="xxiii.i-p84"></span>Perhaps it will rather be thought that
there is a change of the tenses; and thus the particle <span
id="xxiii.i-p84.1"></span>כי, (*ki*,) which we have rendered *For*, will
signify *Until*;  <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) and this
clause will be read in immediate connection with the former part of the
sentence. *Let my banished dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a place of
concealment from the face of the destroyer, until the extortioner shall
have ceased*. But as that might be thought to be a forced
interpretation, I have chosen to abide by the natural meaning.

<span id="xxiii.i-p86"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p86.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p87"></span>**5.** *And the throne shall be prepared
in mercy.*  <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) The Jews explain the
whole of this verse as referring to Hezekiah; but this is altogether
inappropriate, for the Prophet speaks of a more important restoration of
the Church, and the Moabites had not been punished during the
flourishing condition of Hezekiah’s reign; and the blessing of God again
began to burst forth on the Jews. It is as if it had been said “All the
enemies of the chosen people maliciously contrive the ruin of that
kingdom, which God promised *should be established for ever*.” (<span
id="xxiii.i-p88.1"></span>[2Sa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013)<span id="xxiii.i-p88.1"></span>..md)
That the godly may not give way to despondency amidst the unhappy
confusion, they are reminded of the perpetuity of the kingdom, of which
they had been assured by a well-known prediction.

<span id="xxiii.i-p89"></span>It cannot therefore be explained as
referring to any other than to Christ, though I acknowledge that
Hezekiah was a type of Christ, as David and the rest of his successors
also were. But they conduct us to Christ, who alone is the protector and
leader of his people, (<span id="xxiii.i-p89.1"></span>[Joh
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md)<span
id="xxiii.i-p89.1"></span>,) and who has *gathered the remnant that was
scattered abroad*. (<span id="xxiii.i-p89.2"></span>[Joh
11:52](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#052.md)<span
id="xxiii.i-p89.2"></span>.) For this reason he sends back the godly to
Christ, as if he had said, “You know what God you worship. He has
declared that he will watch over your safety, so that under his
protection you will always continue to be safe and uninjured; and if you
shall at any time meet with reverses, he has promised to you a Redeemer,
under whom you shall enjoy renewed and steadfast prosperity. Though for
a time you may weep, yet the protector of the Church will come, and will
restore you to a flourishing state of freedom. You ought, therefore,
with your whole heart, to rely on the expectation of him; even when you
see the Church to be in a confused and wretched condition.”

<span id="xxiii.i-p90"></span>This ought to be carefully observed; for
all other consolations are transitory and fading, if we do not refer all
of them to Christ. Let our eyes therefore be fixed on him, if we wish to
be happy and prosperous; for he has promised that we shall be happy even
amidst the cross, (<span id="xxiii.i-p90.1"></span>[Matt.
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011)<span id="xxiii.i-p90.1"></span>,.md)
that agony and torments will open up the way to a blessed life, (<span
id="xxiii.i-p90.2"></span>[2Co
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#017)<span id="xxiii.i-p90.2"></span>,.md)
and that all the afflictions which we shall suffer will add to the
amount of our happiness. (<span id="xxiii.i-p90.3"></span>[Ro

<span id="xxiii.i-p91"></span>*In mercy.* Isaiah shows that this does
not take place through the agency of men, but by the kindness of God,
who is the builder of this *throne*; and therefore we ought to
acknowledge that it is owing to his undeserved goodness that this sacred
*throne* is established among us. The Prophet expressly confirms this by
saying, that the cause of it must not be sought anywhere else than in
the absolute *mercy* of God. Nor can any other cause be found; for God
could not be induced by any excellence of character, or by merits, (of
which there certainly were none,) to set up again the throne which had
fallen down through the fault and through the crimes of the people; but
when he saw that those whom he had adopted were ruined, he wished to
give a proof of his infinite goodness. Now, if God build this throne, by
whom shall it be overturned? Will wicked men be stronger than he?

<span id="xxiii.i-p92"></span>*And he will sit upon it in the tabernacle
of David.* Almost every word here is emphatic, so that this verse
deserves to be continually pondered. I do not object to the opinion that
the word *tabernacle* contains an allusion to this effect, that he was
but an ordinary man before he was *called to sit on a throne*. (<span
id="xxiii.i-p92.1"></span>[1 Sam.
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012.md)<span id="xxiii.i-p92.1"></span>;
<span id="xxiii.i-p92.2"></span>[2Sa
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#008)<span id="xxiii.i-p92.2"></span>..md)
The Prophet intended to draw a picture of the Church, which has no
resemblance to the thrones of kings and of princes, and does not shine
with gold or precious stones. Though he has held out the spiritual
kingdom of Christ under a mean and despicable shape, yet at the same
time he shows that that kingdom will be seen on earth and amongst men.
If he had only said that *the throne* of Christ will be erected, we
might have asked, Will his *throne* be in heaven, or also on earth? But
now when he says, *in the tabernacle of David*, he shows that Christ
reigns not only among angels but also among men, lest we should think
that, in order to seek him, we must enter into heaven. Wicked men
ridicule what we preach about the kingdom of Christ, as if it were some
phantom of our own imagination. They wish to see it with their eyes, and
to have the evidence of their senses; but we ought not to conceive of it
as at all carnal, but to be satisfied with his arm and with his power.

<span id="xxiii.i-p93"></span>*In steadfastness.* <span
id="xxiii.i-p93.1"></span>אמת (*emeth*) denotes not only *truth* but
every kind of *certainty*. The Prophet means that the kingdom of Christ
will be firm and steadfast, as Daniel also declared. (<span
id="xxiii.i-p93.2"></span>[Dan. 2:44](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md),
[Dan. 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md)<span
id="xxiii.i-p93.2"></span>.) The Evangelist also says, *Of his kingdom
there* *shall be no end*. (<span id="xxiii.i-p93.3"></span>[Lu
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#033)<span id="xxiii.i-p93.3"></span>..md)
In this respect it is distinguished from the ordinary condition of
kingdoms, which, even when they are founded on great and enormous
wealth, crumble down or even fall by their own weight, so that they have
no more permanency than vanishing pictures. But Isaiah declares, that
the kingdom of Christ, though it frequently totter, will be supported by
the hand of God, and therefore will last for ever. These proofs ought to
fortify us against temptations which arise, whenever the kingdom of
Christ is attacked by enemies so numerous and powerful that we might be
ready to think that it will quickly be destroyed. Whatever weapons the
world may employ, and though hell itself should vomit out flames of
fire, we must abide by this promise.

<span id="xxiii.i-p94"></span>*Who shall judge.* I understand <span
id="xxiii.i-p94.1"></span>שפת (*shophet*) to mean *Governor*, as if he
had said, “There will be one who shall *govern*.” Often do we see a
magnificent throne when there is no one to sit on it, and it frequently
happens that kings are either idols or cattle, without judgment or skill
or wisdom. But here he says, that one will sit who shall discharge the
office of a good *governor*; and this is added in order to assure us
that Christ will be our protector.

<span id="xxiii.i-p95"></span>*And seek judgment and hasten
righteousness.* The *judgment* and the *righteousness* which are
ascribed to him, are nothing else than the protection under which he
receives us, and which he will not allow to be infringed; for he will
not allow wicked men who injure us to pass unpunished, while we
patiently and calmly commit ourselves to his protection. By the word
*hasten* he shows that he will quickly and speedily avenge our cause.
This must be viewed as a rebuke to our impatience, for we never think
that his assistance comes soon enough. But when we are hurried along by
the violence of passion, let us remember that this arises from not
submitting to his providence; for although according to the judgment of
our flesh he delays, still he regulates his judgment in the best manner
by the seasons which are well known to him. Let us therefore submit to
his will.

<span id="xxiii.i-p96"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p96.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p97"></span>**6.** *We have heard of the pride of
Moab.* The Prophet added this statement by way of anticipation. It might
be thought that men could not believe what he had promised about
restoring the *throne* of the king and destroying the Moabites, who at
that time were in a flourishing state of riches, and were defended by
strong fortresses, and who, puffed up with the prosperity which they now
enjoyed, were exceedingly *proud*. Besides, their haughtiness, with
which they scorned the unhappy Jews, was a disagreeable and powerful
weapon for discouraging or shaking their minds. To provide against this
temptation, he relates that their boasting was well known, but that
their *pride* would not prevent God from overthrowing them; because no
array of armed forces, no treasures of riches, no multitude of men, can
withstand God. Isaiah speaks of it as a thing extensively known, that
the Moabites are puffed up in such a manner that they dread nothing; as
is commonly the case with those who are well supplied with riches and
troops, that they idly exalt themselves above God and men. But whatever
may be their arrogance, the Lord will easily restrain it.

<span id="xxiii.i-p98"></span>*His insolence.*  <span
id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) The Hebrew word <span
id="xxiii.i-p99.1"></span>עברה (*gnebrah*) most frequently signifies
*indignation*; but the connection in which it stands appears to call for
something more definite. This noun is derived from the verb <span
id="xxiii.i-p99.2"></span>עבר, (*gnabar*,) to *pass* or *go beyond*,
answering to the Latin word <span id="xxiii.i-p99.3"></span>*excessus*;
and therefore I have thought it better to translate it *insolence*. In a
parallel passage, after the words *pride* and *arrogance* comes the
phrase *haughtiness of* *heart*. (<span id="xxiii.i-p99.4"></span>[Jer
48:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#029.md)<span
id="xxiii.i-p99.4"></span>.) Both Isaiah and Jeremiah, I have no doubt,
mean that the Moabites, in consequence of their stubborn and disdainful
behavior, and their sumptuous mode of living, were so cruel, that they
kindled into wrath on the most trivial occasions, and rose fiercely
against others. This vice is always accompanied by haughtiness of mind;
for *pride* is followed by disdain and contempt of others, and they who
claim more than is due to them easily kindle into rage, and become
furious for the smallest offense. In short, they can bear nothing, and
are not only passionate, but likewise outrageous. They would wish that
all should yield to them, and that they should yield to none. If all do
not yield at their bidding, they think that injustice is done to them.
This passionate temper is easily betrayed by proud men. On the other
hand, the humble possess kindness accompanied by corresponding modesty,
and easily forgive any one who has injured them.

<span id="xxiii.i-p100"></span>*His lies.* The Hebrew word <span
id="xxiii.i-p100.1"></span>בדים (*baddim*) denotes either *a mans
limbs*, or *the branches of a tree*, and sometimes it is put for
*divination*. Accordingly, the Greek translators  <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) render it <span
id="xxiii.i-p101.1"></span>μαντεἰα, *divination*, and it has that
signification in other passages. Some think that it is here used
metaphorically for *children*; others translate it either *discourses*
or *thoughts*; and others render it *strength* or *sinews*. But in my
opinion it is rather put for *vain boasting*; for this word often
denotes *falsehood*, and we shall soon see how well this signification
applies to the present passage.

<span id="xxiii.i-p102"></span>There is quite as much difference in the
interpretation of the word <span id="xxiii.i-p102.1"></span>כן (*ken*,)
*so*. The greater part suppose it to mean that “the lies are not right,”
or that “the discourses are not right,” and others, that “the lies are
not true;” and as to the substance of the matter, I am almost of their
opinion. I have no doubt that the meaning of the Prophet is, that Moab
foolishly utters his vain boastings, for he will not accomplish what he
imagines. As to the words, the meaning of them is obtained with greater
certainty from <span id="xxiii.i-p102.2"></span>[Jer
48:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#030.md)<span
id="xxiii.i-p102.2"></span>. After the same words which are here
employed by Isaiah, he immediately adds, for the sake of explaining
them, <span id="xxiii.i-p102.3"></span>לא כן, (*lo ken*,) *Not so*;
 <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) *his lies shall not so effect
it.* As if he had said, “What is determined in their hearts shall fail
of accomplishment.” Yet I do not think, that in the former clause the
particle <span id="xxiii.i-p103.1"></span>כן (*ken*) denotes comparison,
but rather confirmation, so to speak, but negatively; for he declares
that there will be no firmness or stability in his counsels, that *his*
*divinations* or *lies will not take effect*. Proud men settle
everything as if everything were in their power, and were not subject to
the providence of God. “Such *arrogance*,” says Isaiah, shall be brought
down, and all that they promise, as to their own strength, shall vanish
away. This reminds us that pride is highly displeasing to God, and that
the more men are puffed up with their riches, they are the nearer to
destruction.

<span id="xxiii.i-p104"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p104.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p105"></span>**7.** *Therefore shall Moab howl to
Moab.*  <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) He declares more plainly
what has been already said, that this *pride*, and the cruelty which
springs from it, will be the cause of their destruction. Since the Lord
*resisteth the proud*, (<span id="xxiii.i-p106.1"></span>[Jas
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md)<span id="xxiii.i-p106.1"></span>;
<span id="xxiii.i-p106.2"></span>[1Pe
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005)<span id="xxiii.i-p106.2"></span>,.md)
it is impossible but that he will lay low this haughtiness, by which the
Church is basely and shamefully trampled under foot; and, according to
this example, the end of all proud men must be mournful. When he adds,
*Moab to Moab*, he means that there will be what may be called a
melancholy concert among them, in which they shall mutually complain of
their calamities and bewail their distresses among themselves. Others
render it, *on* *account of Moab*, but this is a feeble interpretation;
for immediately afterwards it follows that the *howling* will be
universal, or that it will be throughout the whole of the people.

<span id="xxiii.i-p107"></span>*On account of the foundations of
Kir-hareseth.* It is sufficiently evident that this was a chief and
royal city; but some consider it to be a proper name, and others to be
an appellative. There can be no doubt that the etymology of the word was
derived from its being constructed of earthen materials. It is also
possible that it received this name on account of the nature of the
walls, which were built of bricks. It was a distinguished city in that
country. He names *the foundations* rather than the city itself, because
it was to be completely thrown down; as if he had said, “You shall not
mourn the plundering of the city or the destruction of the buildings,
but its entire overthrow; for no part of it shall be left.”

<span id="xxiii.i-p108"></span>*You will groan, being only smitten.*
 <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) Some translate <span
id="xxiii.i-p109.1"></span>נכאים (*nechaim*) *lame*; but I prefer to
take it as meaning *smitten*. The particle <span
id="xxiii.i-p109.2"></span>אך, (*ach*,) which is here prefixed to it,
sometimes means *certainly* or *truly*; and sometimes it is put for
*but* or *notwithstanding*. Those who explain it affirmatively suppose
the meaning to be this, *You will groan, being truly smitten*; that is,
“It will not be necessary for you to hire men to pretend mourning in
your name, as is usually done in funerals, but you will mourn in
earnest.” But I prefer to take <span id="xxiii.i-p109.3"></span>אך
(*ach*) as meaning *only*; that is, “All who shall be left will be
wounded; not one shall be safe.” By this mode of expression he describes
the utter destruction of that city, and intimates that those who are
left will lament not only the distresses of others, but also their own.
They, too, will be wounded. And if such severe punishments are inflicted
on the *proud*, let us learn to submit ourselves with humility and
modesty, and willingly to *humble* *ourselves under the mighty hand of
God*. (<span id="xxiii.i-p109.4"></span>[1Pe
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006)<span id="xxiii.i-p109.4"></span>..md)

<span id="xxiii.i-p110"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p110.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p111"></span>**8.** *For the vines of Heshbon have
been cut down.*  <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) Here the
Prophet describes allegorically the desolation of the whole country.
There is reason to believe that it abounded in the choicest *vines*,
 <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) as may readily be inferred from
this and the parallel passage. (<span id="xxiii.i-p113.1"></span>[Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md)<span
id="xxiii.i-p113.1"></span>.) When Prophets threaten destruction to
countries, they usually delineate their more remarkable features. For
instance, were we to speak of Picardy, we certainly would say nothing
about *vines*, as if we had been speaking about Orleans or Burgundy.
Now, the cities mentioned by the Prophet were the chief cities of Moab.

<span id="xxiii.i-p114"></span>*The lords of the nations have trodden
down his choicest shoots* or *branches.*  <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) The Prophet says that *the most
valuable branches* of their vineyards were torn out by *the lords of the
nations*, that is, by the conquerors, who, having subdued the nations in
war, held extensive dominion.

<span id="xxiii.i-p116"></span>*Which reached even to Jazer.*  <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) This serves to point out the extent of
the devastation; for this city was situated on the confines of the land
of the Moabites; as if he had said, “Not only shall a part of the
vineyards be cut down, but the whole country shall be wasted far and
wide.” Some refer this to the enemies themselves; but I would rather
supply the relative <span id="xxiii.i-p117.1"></span>אשר, (*asher*,)
*which*, and refer it to *the vines, which* were so extensive that they
*reached even to Jazer*. Thus the meaning will be, “Though these
vineyards *reached even to Jazer*, and covered a very large tract of
country, yet thence *to the wilderness* they will all be trodden down by
*the lords of* *the nations*.” This agrees best with the scope of the
passage; for it is immediately added that the vineyards *reached to the
wilderness*, and even *to the sea*; by which he means that the country
was exceedingly fertile, and especially that it abounded in *vines*. He
says that they *crossed the sea*,  <span
id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) because, when the soil is productive,
it is customary to protect by mounds what is contiguous to the sea, in
order to extend the cultivation, and to oppose the violence of the waves
by posts of wood and embankments, in order to obtain a large extent of
available soil.

<span id="xxiii.i-p119"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p119.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p120"></span>**9.** *Therefore I will bewail.* The
Prophet here takes upon him the character of another person, as we have
formerly remarked; for in the name of the Moabites he laments and
groans. It is undoubtedly true that believers always shudder at the
judgments of God, and cannot lay aside the feelings of human nature, so
as not to commiserate the destruction of the wicked. Yet he does not
describe his own feelings; but his intention is to give additional
weight to his instruction, that no one may entertain a doubt as to the
accomplishment. He therefore represents in the person of a Moabite, as
on a stage, the mourning and grief which shall be felt by all after that
calamity, in order to hold out to the Jews a confirmation of this
promise, which otherwise might have been thought to be incredible.

<span id="xxiii.i-p121"></span>*Because on thy summer-fruits and on thy
harvest a shouting shall break forth,* or *shall fall.*  <span
id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) This last clause of the verse is
variously explained by commentators. <span
id="xxiii.i-p122.1"></span>נפל, (*naphal*,) signifies to *fall*, or to
*burst forth*. Those who translate it, *to burst* *forth*, consider the
word <span id="xxiii.i-p122.2"></span>הידד, (*hedad*,) *shouting*, to
refer to the enemies themselves; as if he had said, “*The shouting* of
enemies *bursts forth on thy harvest;”* so that there is an implied
contrast between this *shouting* and the *joy* of which he will
afterwards speak. Others explain it to mean, that *the shoutings will be
laid;* that is, “there shall be no more *shouting*, and no longer shall
the glad and merry voices of the reapers be heard, cheering themselves
after the harvest.” But I would rather refer it to the *shouting* of
enemies; and on this point I follow a most faithful interpreter of this
passage, the Prophet Jeremiah, who says that *the* *spoiler bursts
forth*, (<span id="xxiii.i-p122.3"></span>[Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md)<span
id="xxiii.i-p122.3"></span>,) where Isaiah speaks of the *shouting* of
the enemy; as if he had said, “When thou shalt make preparations for
gathering in thy harvest and thy vintage, the enemies will *rush* in,
and, instead of joy and cheerful song, their *shouting* shall be heard,
which shall drive thee far away.”

<span id="xxiii.i-p123"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p123.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p124"></span>**10.** *Joy is taken away.* He confirms,
by different words, what he has now said, that the whole country shall
be desolate and forsaken, so that there shall never again be in it a
harvest or a vintage. When he threatens that God will cause the
vine-dressers to cease to sing, he refers to an ancient custom; for when
they gathered the vintage, they usually testified their joy both by
dancing and by singing. Hence these words of Virgil, *The exhausted
vine-dresser now addresses by song his* *farthest rows*  <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) In like manner, the sailors, when they
approach the harbour, raise their shout of joy, (<span
id="xxiii.i-p125.1"></span>κἐλευσμα,) because, having finished their
toils, and escaped dangers, they see that they have hope of obtaining
some leisure or refreshment. It is as if the Prophet had said, “When the
produce of the harvest shall be taken away, nothing will be left to them
but to lament their poverty.”

<span id="xxiii.i-p126"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p126.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p127"></span>**11.** *Therefore my bowels shall sound
like a harp for Moab.* Assuming the character of a Moabite, the Prophet
again describes excessive lamentation, proceeding from grief so intense
that even the bowels make a distressing noise; for by the sign he
intended to point out the reality. We have formerly explained the object
of those lively descriptions, which is, to bring the events, as it were,
before our eyes, and to lead us to entertain stronger hopes of those
things which appear to go beyond all belief. By again naming
*Kir-Hareseth*, the chief city, and thus taking a part for the whole, he
describes the destruction of the whole country.

<span id="xxiii.i-p128"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p128.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p129"></span>**12.** *And it shall be.* He again
returns to that statement which he formerly noticed, namely, that
idolaters in their affliction betake themselves to their idols, hoping
to obtain some relief from them. Yet it means somewhat more; for while
idolaters have their ordinary temples and places of worship, if any
uncommon calamity befalls them, they go to another temple more sacred
than the rest, expecting that there they will be more abundantly favored
with the presence of their god. In like manner, the Papists of the
present day, when they are reduced to any uncommon danger, (for this
fault has existed in all ages,) think that they will more readily obtain
their wish by running to St. Claude, or to Mary of Loretto, or to any
other celebrated idol, than if they assembled in some neighboring
church. They resolve that their extraordinary prayers shall be offered
up in a church which is at a great distance. It is in this sense that
the Prophet applies the term *Sanctuary* to that which was most highly
celebrated among the Moabites, and says that they will go to it, but
without any advantage. Now it is evident from sacred history that their
most celebrated temple was dedicated to *Chemosh*. (<span
id="xxiii.i-p129.1"></span>[1Ki
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#007.md)<span
id="xxiii.i-p129.1"></span>.)

<span id="xxiii.i-p130"></span>*And shall not profit by it.*  <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) The phrase <span
id="xxiii.i-p131.1"></span>לא יוכל, (*lo* *yuchal*,) *they shall not be
able*, is explained by some to mean, that they shall at length be so
completely worn out that they will not have sufficient strength to go to
the temple. But I think it better to render it thus, *he shall not
profit by it*; for he shuts out the Moabites from all hope of safety, by
saying that they will find no protection even in their gods.

<span id="xxiii.i-p132"></span>*When it is seen.* The word <span
id="xxiii.i-p132.1"></span>נראה, (*nirah*,) *seen*, is emphatic. It
means that idolaters are not guided by reason, but rather by the
impressions made on their senses, like brute beasts: for as the beasts
judge by feeling, smelling, and seeing, so idolaters have no other guide
than the judgment of the flesh. Accordingly, if any one shall show that
they are doing wrong, he will gain nothing by it. Though they have often
known by experience that they gain nothing by so many laborious
exertions, they will not desist from them, but will contrive new methods
and introduce new modes of worship, hoping that God will approve of
them. If they succeed according to their wish, they ascribe everything
to their superstitions, and become more obstinate. If they perceive that
they have derived no advantage, they reject their contrivances, condemn
the superstitious worship, and curse their gods. In short, they rely
altogether on the events, and do not judge of anything either by reason
or by the word of God. The consequence is, that, as they are guided by
what befalls them, they are continually changing their plans. But the
Prophet appears to mean somewhat more, namely, that when their folly, in
having hitherto labored to no purpose, shall have been openly manifested
and exposed, the Moabites will come into the temple of Chemosh, rather
through shame than in the exercise of judgment.

<span id="xxiii.i-p133"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p133.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p134"></span>**13.** *This is the word.* This
concluding sentence is the ratification of the prophecy. It means that
he has pronounced the decree of God himself, and that he has brought
nothing forward that did not proceed from the Lord, and thus, laying
aside the person of a man, he introduces God speaking in this manner.

<span id="xxiii.i-p135"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p135.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p136"></span>**14.** *Three years.* The time is fixed,
not only for the sake of certainty, but likewise that believers may not
become faint through longer delay. He alludes to agreements among men,
in which it is customary to fix the time agreed on, which the parties
are not at liberty to transgress. This is especially the case in the
labors of *hirelings*, from whom Scripture frequently draws a comparison
in this respect, that they earnestly long for the appointed day when
they shall receive their reward; for they groan, as it were, under the
burden, and grievously dislike their daily toils. (<span
id="xxiii.i-p136.2"></span>[Job 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001.md),
[Job 14:6](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#006.md), [Isa.
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#016.md)<span
id="xxiii.i-p136.2"></span>.) In this way the Lord says, that he fixes a
day for the Moabites, in which they shall not escape from the entire
destruction of their power.

<span id="xxiii.i-p137"></span>*With all his multitude.* He expressly
mentions a *multitude*, because their number was great, and because they
boasted of it, and thought that they were invincible. When he adds, that
*the remnant shall be feeble,* he means that there will be so great a
change, that they will have no resemblance to their former condition;
for nothing will be left but a sad and shocking sight.

The capital of Idumea, and one of the most remarkable cities of the
ancient world. For more than a thousand years this city remained unknown
and unvisited, till Burckhardt discovered it in 1812. It was afterwards
visited, with some difficulty, by Messrs. Legh, Banks, Captains Irby and
Mangles, as well as by M. Linant and M. Laborde.” Those who have not
access to the details of those enterprizing researches, or who wish to
see it ably stated and argued, that “the present condition of *Petra*
furnishes a remarkable fulfillment of Scripture prophecy,” will do well
to read the article Petra in Dr. Eadie’s *Biblical* *Cyclopaedia*, from
which the above extracts are taken; an article which draws largely both
from the narratives of travelers and from the inspired writers, and
compresses within moderate limits a large amount of information. — *Ed*

<span id="xxiii.i-p40"></span> FT242 *As a wandering bird*. — Eng. Ver.

<span id="xxiii.i-p41"></span> FT243 *Take* (Heb. *Bring*) *counsel*. —
Eng. Ver.

<span id="xxiii.i-p42"></span> FT244 “Make a shadow for thee *at noon*,
to throw darkness over thee, *as in the night*, that by means of it thou
mayest be concealed from the face of thy enemies.” — *Jarchi*

<span id="xxiii.i-p43"></span> FT245 *For the extortioner* (Heb.
*wringer*) *is at an end*. — Eng. Ver.

<span id="xxiii.i-p44"></span> FT246 *Until the extortioner* <span
id="xxiii.i-p44.1"></span>כי (*ki*) answers here to the Latin adverb,
<span id="xxiii.i-p44.2"></span>*usquedum*. — *Tayl. Concord*. quoted by
Stock.

<span id="xxiii.i-p45"></span> FT247 *And in mercy shall the throne be
established*,(or, *prepared*.) — Eng. Ver.

<span id="xxiii.i-p46"></span> FT248 *His wrath*. — Eng. Ver. In the
author’s version of this chapter, the rendering is, *his insolence*; but
in his margin he puts *indignation*. Lowth and Stock make it *his
anger*. — *Ed*

<span id="xxiii.i-p47"></span> FT249 The rendering of the Septuagint is,
<span id="xxiii.i-p47.1"></span>οὐχ οὕτως ἡ μαντεία σου,<span
id="xxiii.i-p47.2"></span> οὐχ οὕτως *Not so thy divination, not so*. —
*Ed*

<span id="xxiii.i-p48"></span> FT250 <span id="xxiii.i-p48.1"></span>לא
כן (*lo ken*,) <span id="xxiii.i-p48.2"></span>*non rectum*, the
frivolous predictions of his diviners, on which no wise man would place
dependence. — *Rosenmuller*

<span id="xxiii.i-p49"></span> FT251 *Therefore shall Moab howl for
Moab*. — Eng. Ver.

<span id="xxiii.i-p50"></span> FT252 *Shall ye mourn*, (or, *mutter*,)
*surely* they are *stricken* — Eng. Ver. *Moan even ye who* yourselves
*are smitten*. — *Stock*

<span id="xxiii.i-p51"></span> FT253 *For the fields of Heshbon
languish*. — Eng. Ver.

<span id="xxiii.i-p52"></span> FT254 “It ought to be known that Heshbon
was a place of *fields*, and Sibmah was a place of vineyards. If you
object, that all these cities were on the other side of Jordan, and at
what time therefore did they fall under the hand (or power) of the
Moabites? we reply. When Sennacherib carried the Reubenites and Gadites
into captivity, the Moabites, who were their neighbors, came and dwelt
in those cities.” — *Jarchi*

<span id="xxiii.i-p53"></span> FT255 *The lords of the heathen have
trodden down the principal plants* *thereof*. — Eng. Ver.

<span id="xxiii.i-p54"></span> FT256 *They are come even unto Jazer*. —
Eng. Ver.

<span id="xxiii.i-p55"></span> FT257 “*The lake of Jazer*, as Jeremiah
explains it, <span id="xxiii.i-p55.1"></span>[Jer
48:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#032.md)<span id="xxiii.i-p55.1"></span>.
The plantations of this vine spread onward to the banks, and seemed to
overhang the whole breadth of the lake.” — *Rosenmuller*

<span id="xxiii.i-p56"></span> FT258 *For the shouting for thy
summer-fruits and for thy harvest is* *fallen*. (Or, *the alarm is
fallen upon thy summer-fruits and* *upon thy harvest*. — Eng. Ver.

<span id="xxiii.i-p57"></span> FT259 <span id="xxiii.i-p57.1"></span>Jam
canit extremos effoetus vinitor antes. — *Virg. Georg*. 2:417.

<span id="xxiii.i-p58"></span> FT260 *But he shall not prevail*. — Eng.
Ver.
