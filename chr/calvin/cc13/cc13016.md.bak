<span id="xvii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 10

<span id="xvii.i"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p1"></span>Isaiah Chapter 10:1-34

<span id="xvii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Woe unto them that decree unrighteous
decrees, and that write grievousness *which* they have prescribed;

<span id="xvii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Vae decernentibus decreta iniqua, et
qui dictantes dictant injuriam,

<span id="xvii.i-p4"></span>**2.** To turn aside the needy from
judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that
widows may be their prey, and *that* they may rob the fatherless!

<span id="xvii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Ut arceant pauperes a judicio, et
eripiant jus pauperibus populi mei, viduas spolient, et pupillos
praedentur.

<span id="xvii.i-p6"></span>**3.** And what will ye do in the day of
visitation, and in the desolation *which* shall come from far? to whom
will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?

<span id="xvii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et quid facietis in die visitationis?
Et cum desolatio venerit e longinquo, ad quem confugietis auxilii causa,
et ubi deponetis (*vel, munietis*) gloriam vestram?

<span id="xvii.i-p8"></span>**4.** Without me they shall bow down under
the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his
anger is not turned away, but his hand *is* stretched out still.

<span id="xvii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Nisi (*vel, sine me*) corruent inter
vinctos, et inter occisos cadent. In hoc toto non erit aversus furor
ejus, et adhuc manus ejus extenta.

<span id="xvii.i-p10"></span>**5.** O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger,
and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.

<span id="xvii.i-p11"></span>**5.** O Assur virga furoris mei, et
baculus ipse in manu eorum ira mea.

<span id="xvii.i-p12"></span>**6.** I will send him against an
hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him
a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them
down like the mire of the streets.

<span id="xvii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Ad gentem simulatricem mittam eum,
et contra populum indignationis meae praecipiam ei, ut praedetur
praedam; ut rapiat spolia, et ponat eum in conculcationem, quasi lutum
platearum.

<span id="xvii.i-p14"></span>**7.** Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither
doth his heart think so; but *it is* in his heart to destroy and cut off
nations not a few.

<span id="xvii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Atqui ipse non sic arbitrabitur, nec
cor ejus sic cogitabit; quia in corde ejus erit ad extirpandum et
succidendum gentes non paucas.

<span id="xvii.i-p16"></span>**8.** For he saith, *Are* not my princes
altogether kings?

<span id="xvii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Dicet enim, Annon Principes mei
pariter Reges?

<span id="xvii.i-p18"></span>**9.** *Is* not Calno as Carchemish? *is*
not Hamath as Arpad? *is* not Samaria as Damascus?

<span id="xvii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Annon, ut Carchemis, sic Calno?
annon Hamath, sicut Arphad? annon Samaria ut Damascus?

<span id="xvii.i-p20"></span>**10.** As my hand hath found the kingdoms
of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of
Samaria;

<span id="xvii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Sicut invenit manus mea regnum
idolorum, cum simulachra eorum sint prae Ierusalem et Samaria.

<span id="xvii.i-p22"></span>**11.** Shall I not, as I have done unto
Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?

<span id="xvii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Annon sicut feci Samariae et idolis
ejus, ita faciam Ierusalem et idolis ejus?

<span id="xvii.i-p24"></span>**12.** Wherefore it shall come to pass,
*that*, when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and
on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of
Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

<span id="xvii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Sed accidet, Cum perfecerit Dominus
totum opus suum in monte Sion et Ierusalem, visitabo super fructum
magnificentiae cordis regis Assur, et super gloriam altitudinis oculorum
ejus.

<span id="xvii.i-p26"></span>**13.** For he saith, By the strength of my
hand I have done *it*, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have
removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I
have put down the inhabitants like a valiant *man*

<span id="xvii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Quia dixit: In fortitudine manus
meae feci, et in sapientia mea; quia perspicax fui; et ideo abstuli
terminos populorum, et recondita eorum diripui, et detraxi tanquam
fortis sedentes.

<span id="xvii.i-p28"></span>**14.** And my hand hath found, as a nest,
the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs *that are* left,
have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing,
or opened the mouth, or peeped.

<span id="xvii.i-p29"></span>**14.** Et invenit quasi nidum manus mea
opes populorum; et ut colliguntur ova derelicta, sic ego universam
terram collegi; nec fuit qui abigeret ala, et aperiret os, et sibilaret.

<span id="xvii.i-p30"></span>**15.** Shall the axe boast itself against
him that heweth therewith? *or* shall the saw magnify itself against him
that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake *itself* against them that
lift it up, *or* as if the staff should lift up *itself, as if it were*
no wood.

<span id="xvii.i-p31"></span>**15.** An gloriabitur securis adversus
secantem ipsa? An magnificabitur serra adversus eum qui ipsum agitat?
quasi elevatio virgae contra elevantem ipsam, quasi elevationes baculi,
non ligni.

<span id="xvii.i-p32"></span>**16.** Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord
of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall
kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.

<span id="xvii.i-p33"></span>**16.** Propterea mittet Dominator Dominus
exercituum in pingues ejus maciem, et subtus gloriam ejus succendet
incendium, quasi incendium ignis.

<span id="xvii.i-p34"></span>**17.** And the light of Israel shall be
for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour
his thorns and his briers in one day;

<span id="xvii.i-p35"></span>**17.** Et erit lux Israel in ignem, et
Sanctus ejus in flammam; comburetque et devorabit vepres ejus et spinas
die uno.

<span id="xvii.i-p36"></span>**18.** And shall consume the glory of his
forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be
as when a standard-bearer fainteth.

<span id="xvii.i-p37"></span>**18.** Gloriam sylvae ejus, et frugiferi
campi ejus, ab anima usque ad carnem consumet; et erit quasi dissolutio
signiferi.

<span id="xvii.i-p38"></span>**19.** And the rest of the trees of his
forest shall be few, that a child may write them.

<span id="xvii.i-p39"></span>**19.** Et reliquiae ligni sylvae ejus ad
numerum erunt, ut puer eas numeret.

<span id="xvii.i-p40"></span>**20.** And it shall come to pass in that
day, *that* the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house
of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall
stay upon the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

<span id="xvii.i-p41"></span>**20.** Erit in die illo. Non adjicient
amplius reliquiae Israel, et superstites e domo Iacob inniti percussori
suo; nam innitentur super Iehovam sanctum Israel, in veritate.

<span id="xvii.i-p42"></span>**21.** The remnant shall return, *even*
the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.

<span id="xvii.i-p43"></span>**21.** Reliquiae revertentur, reliquiae
Iacob ad Deum fortem.

<span id="xvii.i-p44"></span>**22.** For though thy people Israel be as
the sand of the sea, *yet* a remnant of them shall return: the
consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.

<span id="xvii.i-p45"></span>**22.** Nam si fuerit populus tuus Israel
instar arenae maris, reliquiae ejus revertentur. Consumptio decreta
inundans justitiam, (*vel, justitia.*)

<span id="xvii.i-p46"></span>**23.** For the Lord God of hosts shall
make a consumption, even determined, in themidst of all the land.

<span id="xvii.i-p47"></span>**23.** Quia consumptionem et finitionem
Dominus Iehova exercituum facit in medio totius terrae.

<span id="xvii.i-p48"></span>**24.** Therefore thus said the Lord God of
hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian:
he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against
thee, after the manner of Egypt.

<span id="xvii.i-p49"></span>**24.** Propterea sic dicit Iehova
exercituum: Ne timeas, popule mi, incolae Sion, ab Assur. In virga
percutiet te, et baculum suum levabit contra te in via AEgypti.

<span id="xvii.i-p50"></span>**25.** For yet a very little while, and
the indignation shall cease, and mine anger, in their destruction.

<span id="xvii.i-p51"></span>**25.** Sed adhuc paululum, et consumabitur
(*vel, consumetur*) furor et indignatio mea, in abolitione eorum.

<span id="xvii.i-p52"></span>**26.** And the Lord of hosts shall stir up
a scourge for him, according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of
Oreb: and *as* his rod *was* upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after
the manner of Egypt.

<span id="xvii.i-p53"></span>**26.** Et excitabit Iehova exercituum
contra eum flagellum, secundum caedem Madian in rupe Oreb; et virga ejus
super mare, levabitque eam in via AEgypti.

<span id="xvii.i-p54"></span>**27.** And it shall come to pass in that
day, *that* his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and
his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of
the annointing.

<span id="xvii.i-p55"></span>**27.** Et accidet in die illa, ut
auferatur onus ejus ab humero tuo, et jugum ejus a cervice tua; et
dissipabitur jugum a facie unctionis.

<span id="xvii.i-p56"></span>**28.** He is come to Aiath, he is passed
to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:

<span id="xvii.i-p57"></span>**28.** Venit in Aiath, transiit in Migron,
in Michmas reponet vasa tua.

<span id="xvii.i-p58"></span>**29.** They are gone over the passage:
they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of
Saul is fled.

<span id="xvii.i-p59"></span>**29.** Transierunt vadum, in Gaeba
pernoctaverunt hospitio; territa est Rama; Gibaea Saulis fugit.

<span id="xvii.i-p60"></span>**30.** Lift up thy voice, O daughter of
Gallim; cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.

<span id="xvii.i-p61"></span>**30.** Hinni voce tua filia Gallim, fac
audire Laisam paupercula Anathoth.

<span id="xvii.i-p62"></span>**31.** Madmenah is removed; the
inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.

<span id="xvii.i-p63"></span>**31.** Mota est Madmena; incolae Gebim
collegerunt se.

<span id="xvii.i-p64"></span>**32.** As yet shall he remain at Nob that
day: he shall shake his hand *against* the mount of the daughter of
Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

<span id="xvii.i-p65"></span>**32.** Adhuc dies: cum in Nob
interquiescet, agitabit manum suam versus montem filiae Sion, collem
Ierusalem.

<span id="xvii.i-p66"></span>**33.** Behold, the Lord, the Lord of
hosts, shall lop the bough with terror; and the high ones of stature
*shall be* hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.

<span id="xvii.i-p67"></span>**33.** Ecce, Dominus Iehova exercituum
amputabit ramum cum terrore, (*vel, potenter,*) et procerae staturae
excidentur, et sublimia humiliabunter.

<span id="xvii.i-p68"></span>**34.** And he shall cut down the thickets
of the forests with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

<span id="xvii.i-p69"></span>**34.** Et resecabit condensa sylvae ferro,
et Libanus violenter cadet.

<span id="xvii.i-p70"></span> 

<span id="xvii.i-p71"></span><span id="xvii.i-p71.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p72"></span>**1.** *Woe to them that decree.* He now
attacks the people more closely, as he did in the first and second
chapters, to make them feel that they are justly afflicted; for men
never acknowledge that they are justly punished till they have been
manifestly convicted and constrained. Though they were sufficiently
convicted by former proofs, still he found it necessary to come to
particulars, that by means of them their hypocrisy might be exposed; for
men are so brazen-faced as to think that any excuse shields them, and
openly to accuse God. When they had become so shameless, it was
impossible for him to rebuke them too sharply, or to carry his
accusations beyond proper limits, so as to shut their mouths, whether
they would or not.

<span id="xvii.i-p73"></span><span id="xvii.i-p73.1"></span>עמל
(*gnamal*) and <span id="xvii.i-p73.2"></span>און (*aven*) are often
joined together in Scripture, as in <span id="xvii.i-p73.3"></span>[Ps
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014.md)<span id="xvii.i-p73.3"></span>
<span id="xvii.i-p73.4"></span>און signifies *vanity* and *iniquity*,
but the latter meaning agrees better with this passage. <span
id="xvii.i-p73.5"></span>עמל, (*gnamal*,) on the other hand, denotes
vexation, and often the very cause of the vexation, that is, the
oppression inflicted by the stronger on the weaker, when they abuse
their authority and power. Having formerly shown that the wickedness
originated from the governors themselves, (<span
id="xvii.i-p73.6"></span>[Isa. 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#023)<span id="xvii.i-p73.6"></span>,.md)
he places them in the first rank, that they may undergo the punishment
of the crimes which they had occasioned. This ought to be carefully
observed, for they who are elevated to the highest rank imagine that
they are exempted from the ordinary lot of other men, and that they are
not bound to give account to God; and therefore he threatens that they
will have this privilege, that they will be the first that are punished.

<span id="xvii.i-p74"></span>Some think that two classes are here
described, and draw a distinction between <span
id="xvii.i-p74.1"></span>חקקים, (*chokekim*,) *those who decree*, and
<span id="xvii.i-p74.2"></span>מכתבים, (*mechattebim*,) *those who
write*  <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) But I do not approve of
this, for he attacks generally, and without distinction, princes and
magistrates, who oppressed the people by unjust and tyrannical decrees,
in such a manner that they approached to absolute robbery; and therefore
he includes every class of magistrates and governors.

<span id="xvii.i-p76"></span><span id="xvii.i-p76.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p77"></span>**2.** *To keep back.*  <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) Others render it, *to cause them to
turn* *aside*; but the true meaning is, *to keep back the poor from*
*judgment*, or make them lose their cause. This is the iniquity and
oppression which he had mentioned in the former verse, that *the poor
are deprived of their rights*, and are robbed for the sake of the rich,
and go away mocked from the judgment-seat, while everything is laid open
to plunder. He chiefly mentions *the poor*, because for the most part
they are destitute of help and assistance. While magistrates and judges
ought to have assisted them more than others, they allow themselves
greater liberty, and indulge more contemptuously in oppressing them.
Those who have wealth, or friends, or favor, are less liable to be
oppressed; for they have arms in their hands to defend, and even to
revenge themselves. But the Lord says that he takes peculiar care of the
poor, (<span id="xvii.i-p78.1"></span>[Exod.
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#023.md), [Deut.
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#009.md), [Deut.
24:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015)<span id="xvii.i-p78.1"></span>,.md)
though they are commonly despised; and that he takes such care of them
that he does not allow oppression inflicted on them to pass unpunished;
for it is not without good ground that he calls himself the protector
and defender of such persons. (<span id="xvii.i-p78.2"></span>[Ps
68:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#005)<span id="xvii.i-p78.2"></span>..md)
From this consideration, therefore, the poor and weak ought to derive
consolation, and more calmly to endure distresses and afflictions,
because they learn that God takes care of them, and will not permit any
injustice done to them to pass unpunished. The powerful and wealthy are
at the same time warned not to take it as an incentive to sin that they
have not been punished; for though no avenger be now seen, still the
Lord will avenge, and will undertake the cause of those whom they
imagined to be destitute of all assistance.

<span id="xvii.i-p79"></span><span id="xvii.i-p79.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p80"></span>**3.** *And what will you do?* Here the
Prophet severely threatens princes, who were careless and indolent
amidst their distresses, as men intoxicated by prosperity are wont to
despise haughtily every danger. He therefore warns them that, though God
delay, still he has fixed a time for judgment, and already it is close
at hand. In consequence of having vanquished the neighboring nations in
war, and fortified themselves by an alliance with a very powerful
nation, they had no longer any fear; and therefore he expressly declares
that their calamity will *come from* *afar*

<span id="xvii.i-p81"></span>*In the day of visitation.* By *visitation*
is here meant *judgment*, for God *visits* us in two ways, that is, in
mercy and in judgment. In both ways he reveals himself and his power to
us, both when, in compassion on us, he rescues us from dangers, and when
he punishes those who are ungodly and who despise the word. Both kinds
of *visitation* have the same object in view, for we do not see the Lord
but in his works; and we think that he is absent unless he give us a
token of his presence. This *visitation*, therefore, the Scripture
accommodates to our capacity; for when we are pressed down by
afflictions, and when the ungodly freely give themselves up to
wickedness, we suppose that God is at a great distance, and takes no
interest in our affairs.

<span id="xvii.i-p82"></span>Accordingly, *visitation* must here be
understood to mean the *judgment* by which God, in opposition to the
waywardness and insolence of the ungodly, will bring them back like
deserters. But if the judgments of God be so dreadful in this life, how
dreadful will he be when he shall come at last to judge the world! All
the instances of punishment that now produce fear or terror, are nothing
more than preparations for that final vengeance with which he will
thunder against the reprobate, and many things which he appears to pass
by, he purposely reserves and delays till that last day. And if the
ungodly are not able to bear these chastisements, how much less will
they be capable of enduring his glorious and inconceivable majesty, when
he shall ascend that awful tribunal, before which the angels themselves
tremble!

<span id="xvii.i-p83"></span>*And when the desolation shall come from
afar.* When he says *from afar*, it is proper to observe that we must
not allow the prosperity which we now enjoy to bereave us of our senses;
for they who carelessly sleep amidst their vices, and by this wicked
indifference call in question the power of God, will quickly feel that
in a moment, whenever he pleases, he can shake heaven and earth from
east to west.

<span id="xvii.i-p84"></span>*To whom will you flee?* He declares that
it is in vain for them to rely on their resources, for, in opposition to
the hand of God, they will be fruitless and of no avail whatever. At the
same time he likewise shows that this will be a most righteous reward;
for when they are cruel towards others, they will justly be made to feel
that they have now no help either from God or from men.

<span id="xvii.i-p85"></span>They will have judgment without mercy who
have showed no mercy. (<span id="xvii.i-p85.1"></span>[Jas
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013)<span id="xvii.i-p85.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xvii.i-p86"></span>This applies especially to the judges, who
ought to have been a protection to the whole people; for they have been
appointed for the purpose of defending the poor and wretched. But if
they shall neglect and betray, and even plunder them, it is right that
they should be made to feel, by their own destitute condition, how
greatly this cruelty offends God.

<span id="xvii.i-p87"></span>*Where will you deposit your glory?* This
is understood by commentators to mean that they will be thrown down from
their high rank. They suppose it to be an ironical and contemptuous
question put by the Prophet, “What will become of that illustrious rank
of which the nobles cruelly and foolishly vaunt, whenever God spares
them for a little?” But as this was a forced rendering, I rather think
that Isaiah asks, “Where will they find a safe hiding-place in which
they may *deposit their glory*?” Thus I consider the meaning to be, *to
leave*,  <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) for the sake of being
preserved; and the two clauses correspond to each other, *To whom will
you flee*? and, “Where will you find a refuge for your glory in order to
preserve it?” But perhaps a preference will be given to a different
view, which I have noted in the margin;  <span
id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) for the verb <span
id="xvii.i-p89.1"></span>עזב (*gnazab*) signifies also to *strengthen*.
Again, if God thus devotes to destruction princes who are thrown down
from an elevated position, what will become of the lowest? No one,
therefore, has any reason to flatter himself; for we shall all be *like
stubble* when the wrath of the Lord has been kindled against us. (<span
id="xvii.i-p89.2"></span>[Ps
83:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#013)<span id="xvii.i-p89.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xvii.i-p90"></span><span id="xvii.i-p90.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p91"></span>**4.** *If they shall not fall down.* As
the meaning of the particle <span id="xvii.i-p91.1"></span>בלתי
(*bilti*) is ambiguous, various interpretations of it have been given by
commentators. Some take it in an exclusive sense, as in many other
passages of Scripture; as if he had said, *Only he shall* *fall down
among the bound and slain*; that is, because all will be condemned and
given up either to captivity or to death. Others render it, *Without me
they shall fall*. If this rendering be preferred, the Prophet shows that
the cause of their destruction is, that they have revolted from God; and
unquestionably the cause of all our distresses is, to forsake the
fountain of life and of salvation, and of all blessings. In this manner
he sharply reproves the madness of the ungodly, who vaunt of having been
forsaken by God, as if nothing were more desirable or pleasant than to
withdraw to the greatest distance from him; and thus it will be an
ironical reproof, that their calamity will arise from no other source
than from the absence of God, in whom, without any good ground, they had
rejoiced.

<span id="xvii.i-p92"></span>Others consider it to be an elliptical
expression, that they will have no hiding-place but by throwing
themselves down under the captives and the slain. It might also be a
form of an oath, *If they shall not*;  <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) and the meaning would be highly
appropriate, that God swears in wrath that he will spare none of them,
but will abandon some to captivity, and will deliver up others to be put
to death. In a word, this declaration shows what are the consequences
that await all those who, after having been warned by the word of God,
do not repent. From what immediately follows, we learn that a dreadful
and alarming destruction is threatened; for he repeats what he had
already said frequently, that *the wrath of the Lord is not yet
apparent,* that he will find out more frightful punishments for avenging
himself. This teaches us that nothing is more truly desirable than to be
moved by a sincere feeling of repentance, and to acknowledge our fault,
that we may obtain pardon from the Lord.

<span id="xvii.i-p94"></span><span id="xvii.i-p94.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p95"></span>**5.** *O Assyrian.* What now follows
relates to the threatening of punishment, but at the same time mingles
some consolation for alleviating the distresses of the godly. Indeed,
the greater part of the discourse is occupied with this doctrine, that
all the afflictions which shall be brought upon them by the *Assyrians*
are a temporary scourge inflicted by God, but that unbelievers, after
having too freely indulged themselves, will at length be brought to
submission. <span id="xvii.i-p95.1"></span>הוי (*hoi*) is sometimes an
interjection expressive of lamentation, *Ah!* Sometimes it denotes
addressing, *O!* Sometimes it means, as the old translator rendered it,
*Wo to*. But here it cannot be explained in any other way than that God
calls the *Assyrians*, or assumes the character of one who sighs,
because he is compelled to inflict punishment on his people by means of
the *Assyrians*

<span id="xvii.i-p96"></span>But when I more closely examine the whole
matter, I rather come to this opinion, that here the Lord calls on the
*Assyrians*, as if he armed them by his authority to carry on war. He
had formerly said that they would come; but hypocrites are so careless
that they are never moved by the fear of God, till his scourges are not
only seen but felt. This is the reason why he now addresses them,
*Come*; as if a judge called an officer and ordered him to put a
malefactor in chains, or delivered him to the hangman to inflict capital
punishment upon him. Thus the Lord calls the Assyrians to execute his
vengeance by their hands.

<span id="xvii.i-p97"></span>*And the staff in their hand is mine
indignation.* This may be viewed as referring to the *Assyrian*, and may
be explained so as to be a repetition of the same statement, with a
slight change of the words. But I distinguish between them in this
manner, that the *Assyrians* are called *the rod of God’s indignation*;
and next, that the swords and weapons with which they are furnished are
nothing else than *God’s* *anger*; as if the Prophet had said, that God,
according to his pleasure, made use of the Assyrians in the same manner
as swords for the execution of *his anger*; and further, that although
they bear swords, still there will be no reason to be afraid of them,
except so far as the wrath of God shall be displayed against the Jews.

<span id="xvii.i-p98"></span>The general meaning is, “All the strength
which the enemy shall possess proceeds from the wrath of God, and they
are moved by his secret impulse to destroy the people, for otherwise he
would not move a finger.” God declares that *the staff* which is carried
*in their hand* is his *anger*, in order to inform the Jews that the
blind attacks of the enemies are regulated by a heavenly providence. The
phrase <span id="xvii.i-p98.1"></span>בידם (*beyadam*)  <span
id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) is rendered by some, *in place of
them*, or, *into* *their country*; but I do not approve of this, and it
is too far-fetched. In a word, the Lord calls the Assyrians, as the
ministers of his wrath, to punish the sins of his people by their hand,
and declares that everything that is in their hand is *his wrath*

<span id="xvii.i-p100"></span>This doctrine has two objects in view;
first, to terrify the ungodly, and to inform them that not in vain does
the Lord threaten their destruction; next, he points out the reason why
he punishes them. This was of the greatest importance for shaking off
the sluggishness of the ungodly, who laughed to scorn all the discourses
and threatenings of the Prophet. Secondly, this doctrine was of great
importance when the people themselves began to be afflicted by the
Assyrians; for then they actually saw that what the Prophets had
foretold was not without foundation, and that these things did not
happen by chance.

<span id="xvii.i-p101"></span>It will be objected, Why does he
afterwards call *the staff* his *anger*, since he formerly said that the
Assyrian is *the rod of his* *indignation*; for he ought rather to have
spoken thus: “The Assyrian is my wrath, and the staff which he carries
is the staff of my indignation.” But we need not solicitously detain
ourselves with the words, when we understand the Prophet’s meaning. He
calls men *the staff of his anger*, because he uses them like a *staff*.
He calls men’s weapons *the wrath of God*, because they are not
regulated by their own choice, but are proofs of the wrath of God. The
Prophet therefore spoke appropriately, that we might not think that the
wicked rush forward, without control, wherever their lawless passions
lead them; but, on the contrary, that a bridle restrains and keeps them
back from doing anything without the will of God.

<span id="xvii.i-p102"></span>Hence we ought to learn that the Lord acts
even by the hand of the wicked. But here we must think and speak
soberly; for it is proper to make a wise and judicious distinction
between the work of God and the work of men. There are three ways in
which God acts by men. First, *all of us move and exist by him*. (<span
id="xvii.i-p102.1"></span>[Ac
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028.md)<span
id="xvii.i-p102.1"></span>.) Hence it follows that all actions proceed
from his power. Secondly, in a peculiar manner he impells and directs
the wicked according as he thinks fit; and although nothing is farther
from their thoughts, still he makes use of their agency that they may
kill and destroy one another, or that by their hand he may chastise his
people. Of this method the Prophet speaks in this passage. Thirdly, when
he guides by his Spirit of sanctification, which is peculiar to the
elect. Whether, therefore, we are attacked by tyrants or robbers, or any
other person, or foreign nations rise up against us, let us always
plainly see the hand of God amidst the greatest agitation and confusion,
and let us not suppose that anything happens by chance.

<span id="xvii.i-p103"></span><span id="xvii.i-p103.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p104"></span>**6.** *To a hypocritical nation.* He
proceeds with the former statement, by which he called *the Assyrian the
rod of God’s indignation*; for as the father does not in vain take up
the *rod*, but has this object in view, to chastise his son, so he
declares that the Lord’s *rod* has no uncertain destination, but is
appointed for the chastisement of the unthankful and wicked. He calls it
a *hypocritical* or wicked nation, because it has no uprightness or
sincerity. Uprightness is contrasted with hypocritical conduct, because
uprightness is the chief of all the virtues; and in like manner
hypocrisy is the mother of all the vices. It is therefore no light
accusation which he brings against the Israelites; but he charges them
with what is most of all to be abhorred, and therefore immediately
afterwards he calls them *the people of his indignation*, as he
elsewhere calls the Edomites *the people of his curse*. (<span
id="xvii.i-p104.1"></span>[Isa
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005)<span id="xvii.i-p104.1"></span>..md)
Though he means that he is displeased with the Jews, yet the Hebrew
phraseology is much more emphatic; for it conveys the idea that the
reason why this nation is devoted to destruction is, that nothing is to
be found in it but grounds of anger. Indeed, God is never angry with us
unless we have provoked him by our sins; but when wickedness has come to
its greatest height, his indignation is kindled, and cannot be appeased.
Thus he cuts off the hope of reconciliation from hypocrites and wicked
men, who ceased not continually to add sin to sin.

<span id="xvii.i-p105"></span>*I will command him to take the spoil and
to take the prey.* He says that he has given a loose rein to the
fierceness of enemies, that they may indulge without control in every
kind of violence and injustice. Now, this must not be understood as if
the Assyrians had a *command* from God by which they could excuse
themselves. There are two ways in which God *commands*; by his secret
decree, of which men are not conscious; and by his law, in which he
demands from us voluntary obedience. This must be carefully observed,
that we may reply to fanatics, who argue in an irreligious manner about
the decree of God, when they wish to excuse their own wickedness and
that of others. It is of importance, I say, to make a judicious
distinction between these two ways of *commanding*. When the Lord
reveals his will in the law, I must not ascend to his secret decree,
which he intended should not be known to me, but must yield implicit
obedience.

<span id="xvii.i-p106"></span>Now, if any one allege that he obeys God,
when he complies with his sinful passions, he is guilty of falsehood, by
vainly attempting to involve God in the guilt of his crimes, to which he
knows that he is led by the failings of his own heart; for on this point
no other witness or judge is needed but a man’s own conscience. God does
indeed make use of the agency of a wicked man, but the man has no such
intention. It is therefore accidental, so far as relates to men, that he
acts by the wicked and reprobate; for they neither know that they serve
God, nor wish to do so. Accordingly if they seize on this pretext, it is
easy to prove that, when they yield obedience to their own sinful
passion, they are at the greatest possible distance from obeying God.
They have the will of God declared in his law, so that it is in vain for
them to seek it anywhere else. So far as they are concerned, they do not
perform the work of God, but the work of the devil; for they serve their
own lusts. (<span id="xvii.i-p106.1"></span>[Eph
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002)<span id="xvii.i-p106.1"></span>..md)
Nothing certainly was farther from the intention of the Assyrians than
to give their services to God, but they were hurried along by their lust
and ambition and covetousness. Yet the Lord directed their exertions and
plans to an object which was totally different, and which was unknown to
themselves.

<span id="xvii.i-p107"></span>This passage may be thus summed up. “It
will be an uncommon and extraordinary instance of God’s vengeance, when
the Assyrians shall attack them with unrestrained liberty of action; for
they will be sent by God, not to treat them with gentleness and
moderation, but to plunder them in the manner of an invading army.” He
likewise adds, *to tread them down*. Nothing can go beyond this, for it
means that the vanquished are not spared, but that every possible
species of abuse has been heaped upon then.

<span id="xvii.i-p108"></span><span id="xvii.i-p108.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p109"></span>**7.** *Yet he will not think so.*  <span
id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) When wicked men vomit out their rage,
they disturb weak minds, as if it were not in the power of God to
restrain their pride and fury. The Prophet therefore steps forth
beforehand to meet them, and exhorts believers, whatever may be the
excess to which wicked men indulge their insolence, still to feel that
they are justly chastised by a secret judgment of God. He shows, as we
lately noticed, that nothing will be farther from the intention of the
Assyrians than to give their services to God, and to be the ministers of
his wrath; but we must also consider what is their own motive of action.

<span id="xvii.i-p112"></span>Many would be ready to object, “Why dost
thou, being God’s herald, threaten us with the Assyrian; as if that
savage beast would submit to execute the commandments of God?” He
therefore replies, that God works with such amazing skill that he brings
men to yield obedience to him, even without their knowledge or will.
“Although,” says he, “their attempts and plans are totally different,
yet this will not prevent God from performing and carrying into
execution, by means of them, whatever he has decreed.”

<span id="xvii.i-p113"></span>Many might likewise object, that it was a
strange subversion of order, that God should place the elect people in
subjection to the heathen nations; and that it was not just, however
much the Jews had sinned, that their condition should be worse than that
of those robbers who, on account of their wickedness and crimes,
deserved the severest punishment. The Prophet therefore threatens that
the Assyrians also will have their turn, and in due time will receive
just punishment; and yet that it is not unreasonable that they should
distress, plunder, devour, and slay other nations, because their own
reward is reserved for them. Besides, the Prophet soothes the grief of
the godly, and alleviates their solicitude and uneasiness, by declaring
that God restrains the presumption of wicked men from carrying into
effect whatever they think fit. He therefore shows that, however madly
wicked men may rage, God mitigates his own judgments from heaven, so as
to provide for the salvation of his Church. And thus, though the
Assyrian, like a wild beast, may be eager to seize his prey, he bids
them lift up their eyes to God, whose decree is far removed beyond the
reach of that blind fury.

<span id="xvii.i-p114"></span><span id="xvii.i-p114.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p115"></span>**8.** *For he will say.* He explains the
reason why the Assyrian will not think that he is the *rod* of God. It
is because, being blinded by pride, he acknowledges no authority
superior to his own; for it is impossible for those who rely on their
own superiority, and claim ability to do this or that, to submit to the
providence of God. The authority which we ought justly to ascribe to God
is, to believe that we cannot move even the smallest finger without his
permission. On the other hand, whoever imagines that he can do anything,
however small, assumes to himself, with blasphemous pride, the power of
God.

<span id="xvii.i-p116"></span>*Are not my princes altogether kings?* The
Prophet here gives a lively picture of the presumption of a heathen king
in boasting that he had everything in his power. This is especially the
case with eminent *Princes* who, abounding in wealth, resources, and
power, are blinded in such a manner as hardly to know that they are men.
The opportunities of learning this are too abundant; for what *Prince*
is there at the present day, who knows or remembers that he is a man,
and liable to the ordinary calamities of life? Their minds are so
entirely intoxicated and deranged, that they believe that whatever they
have undertaken they will at once accomplish, and will surmount every
obstacle.

<span id="xvii.i-p117"></span><span id="xvii.i-p117.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p118"></span>**9.** *Is not Calno as Carchemish?* Here
he mentions by name certain cities, though others think that they were
countries; but it is more probable that they were cities, or some
fortified places. “Shall it not happen,” says he, “to those places which
I have not yet subdued as it has happened to others that opposed me?” He
therefore compares *Calno*, *Arpad*, and *Samaria*, which he afterwards
subdued, to *Carchemish*, *Hamath*, and *Damascus*, which he had
formerly subdued, and says that those will not be stronger than these.
Thus wicked men are wont to boast and talk proudly of their former
actions, so as to imagine that they will break through every
obstruction, and that nothing can stand in the way of their plans and
exertions, and even think that they will accomplish everything without
the will or knowledge of God.

<span id="xvii.i-p119"></span>When we read this history, let us learn
that we ought not to be proud of having been strong, or of having
succeeded to our wish; for he who hath exalted us will be able to cast
us down. And if he reproves the Assyrian for that haughtiness, how much
more ought they to be reproved who ascribe to themselves the praise of
righteousness and holiness, as if they could be regenerated by their own
power; for it cannot be doubted that they rob God of his honor, and
claim for themselves what belongs to him!

<span id="xvii.i-p120"></span><span id="xvii.i-p120.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p121"></span>**10.** *As my hand hath found the
kingdoms of the idols.* The Assyrian now breaks out into far more
outrageous language; for not only does he insult men, but he insults God
himself, and even the very gods whom he worshipped. He boasts that the
gods, whose protection the other nations enjoyed, could not prevent him
from subduing them; and that the God of Israel, in whom Jerusalem and
Samaria trusted, would not prevent him any more than they. Wicked men
are so proud that they attribute to their own strength the victories
which they achieve, and do not hesitate to exalt themselves against God
and all that is worshipped. They allege, indeed, that they pay homage to
the objects of their own worship, that is, to the idols which they have
contrived for themselves, and bow before them, and offer sacrifices to
them, by which they give some indication that they ascribe their
victories to the gods; but afterwards, as Habakkuk says of
Nebuchadnezzar,

<span id="xvii.i-p122"></span>they burn incense to their own net, and
sacrifice to their drag, (<span id="xvii.i-p122.1"></span>[Hab
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#016)<span id="xvii.i-p122.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="xvii.i-p123"></span>that is, by boasting of their exploits,
wisdom, sagacity, and perseverance. Their hypocrisy is exposed, and
their secret thoughts, which lay concealed under those folds of
hypocrisy, are revealed, when they immediately claim for themselves what
they appeared to ascribe to the objects of their worship. We need not
wonder, therefore, that Sennacherib exalted himself against all that is
worshipped, for that is the result of ungodliness.

<span id="xvii.i-p124"></span>There are two ways in which his blasphemy
is expressed. First, he exalts himself above God, and thinks that he
will be stronger than God; and, secondly, he makes no distinction
between God and the false gods. He sufficiently displayed his
ungodliness, when he exalted himself alone even above idols; for
although they are nothing but idols, yet as their worshippers ascribe to
them some power and divinity, if they scoff at idols, they show that
they despise every object of worship; for they treat idols with the same
contempt as if they had had to do with God himself. Their own conscience
testifies, therefore, that they carry on war against God, and they have
no excuse arising from ignorance; for they think that God dwells in
graven images. If that tyrant despised Apollo or Jupiter, he undoubtedly
despised them, not as idols, but as having in them something divine. The
second blasphemy of the tyrant was, that he placed the living God on the
same level with the false gods of the heathen, and dared to scoff at him
as well as at the others, and to ridicule the confidence of Israel, as
if no greater power belonged to God than to idols.

<span id="xvii.i-p125"></span><span id="xvii.i-p125.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p126"></span>**12.** *But it shall come to pass.*
Hitherto the Prophet had explained what would be the pride of the
Assyrian, after having obtained a victory over Israel; but now he
foretells what will happen to the Assyrian himself, and what will be the
purpose of God against him. Wicked men do everything in the same manner
as if God were not in heaven, and could not frustrate their designs.
What else is the meaning of those haughty words, *My hand hath found the
kingdoms of the idols*, than this, that he thought that he would
vanquish all the gods? But God opposes his designs, and, after having
made use of his agency, punishes himself also.

<span id="xvii.i-p127"></span>This verse contains two clauses. First, he
declares that God will punish a wicked king. Secondly, he suggests that
the time is not yet come, in order to encourage believers to the
exercise of patience. He foretells that the time which God regards as
fit for doing it will be, when he shall have chastised the sins of his
Church; in the same manner as if the master of a house were to settle
the disturbances of his own family. The object which he has in view is,
that believers may not give way to despondency, when they behold a
wicked tyrant in such a state of exultation, and may not abandon the
hope of salvation, as if it were impossible to restrain him.

<span id="xvii.i-p128"></span>*I will visit upon the fruit of the stout
heart of the king of Assyria.*  <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md)
God promises, in a word, that after having permitted the Assyrian to
plume himself beyond measure, he will in his turn be an avenger; for it
belongs to him to repress the pride of the flesh, which is connected
with sacrilege. Accordingly, the preposition <span
id="xvii.i-p129.1"></span>על (*gnal*)  <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) is emphatic, as if it declared that
the Assyrian will not be protected by his loftiness from undergoing
punishment. *Fruit* is here taken in a metaphorical sense, for wicked
men think that they are happy and prosperous when they swell with pride,
as if they gathered some *fruit*. He places in the foreground *the
heart*, which is the seat of pride, and which, when it swells with
haughtiness, pours out fierceness and cruelty. Afterwards, he adds *the
eyes*, by which the inward feelings of the heart are manifested, and
which, by being lifted up, are the heralds of secret vice. To whatever
extent the Assyrian, in his pride, may elevate himself, God testifies
that he has in his own power the means of suddenly changing his glory
into dishonor and reproach. Accordingly, he includes contempt, scorn,
disdain, and haughty looks, indicative of excessive confidence, which
are usually beheld in proud men.

<span id="xvii.i-p131"></span>*I will visit.* He introduces God as
speaking, because that which God utters with his own mouth is more
impressive, (<span id="xvii.i-p131.1"></span>ἐμφατικώτερον,) than if he
spoke by the mouth of the Prophet. Hence draw a general doctrine. God
cannot endure the arrogance of proud men, without suppressing it; for he
wages incessant war with the haughty and disdainful. (<span
id="xvii.i-p131.2"></span>[Pr
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md)<span id="xvii.i-p131.2"></span>;
<span id="xvii.i-p131.3"></span>[Jas
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#006.md)<span id="xvii.i-p131.3"></span>;
<span id="xvii.i-p131.4"></span>[1Pe
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#005)<span id="xvii.i-p131.4"></span>..md)

<span id="xvii.i-p132"></span>*When the Lord shall have finished his
whole work.* Observe how, in order to repress immoderate haste, the
Prophet added this by way of limitation; for as soon as we see a proud
man, we wonder that the Lord endures him. Isaiah here shows that God
endures that proud tyrant, whatever may be the insolence with which he
vaunts and exalts himself, because he chose to make use of his agency,
and that the seasonable time for the Lord’s destruction of the wicked is
not always at hand, but that we ought to wait patiently for it. When he
shall have chastised the kingdom of Judah, as if he were bringing the
members of the family into a state of submission, he will not be slow or
sluggish in punishing a foreign enemy; as a father commonly throws away
or breaks the rod with which he chastised his son.

<span id="xvii.i-p133"></span>*His whole work on Mount Zion and on
Jerusalem.* By a figure of speech in which a part is taken for the
whole, (<span id="xvii.i-p133.1"></span>συνεκδοχικῶς,) *Mount Zion* is
here put for the Church, and *Jerusalem* is employed in the same sense,
in order that by means of the Temple and the royal city, as the head, he
might describe the whole body, and by means of the most important part
might describe the whole kingdom. He calls it *the whole work*, because
through our foolish haste we would draw away God from his *work*, though
it were only begun. More especially, our wrath against wicked men rages
so strongly, that it is difficult to restrain our impatience, if God do
not instantly comply with our wish in punishing them. To mitigate this
fervor, he bids them allow full and ample time for God’s fatherly
chastisements.

<span id="xvii.i-p134"></span>*The whole work* denotes a proper measure.
This is a useful and highly consolatory doctrine; for we see wicked men,
in a wonderfully arrogant and seemingly triumphant manner, mocking God,
and uttering reproaches and slanders against his doctrine, so that
hardly any words can express their insolence. If the Lord would comply
with our wish, he would immediately hasten to subdue and destroy them.
But he wishes first to humble his Church by means of them.

<span id="xvii.i-p135"></span>*On Mount Zion and on Jerusalem.* He does
not now speak of Syrians or Egyptians, but of the Jews, of *Zion*, of
the Temple and the habitation which he was pleased to consecrate to
himself. Thus, at the present day, there are various diseases of the
Church, which the Lord determines to heal and remove. He has indeed
begun to do so; but we are mistaken if we think that the *work* is
finished; and he will not cease till he has subdued us, so that we may
be moved by the true fear of him, and may submit to his yoke with
becoming modesty and gentleness. We need not wonder, therefore, that he
gives a loose rein to tyrants, and hitherto permits them to rage against
the Church. But the consolation is at hand. When he shall have made use
of their agency in chastising the Church, *he will visit* their pride
and arrogance. And we need not wonder if God, by striking his elect
first of all, expresses in this manner his peculiar regard for their
salvation. *Judgment must* therefore *begin at the house of God*, and
must afterwards extend to those who are without, who will endure
chastisements still more severe.

<span id="xvii.i-p136"></span><span id="xvii.i-p136.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p137"></span>**13.** *For he hath said, By the strength
of my hand I have done it.* The Prophet again repeats the highly
blasphemous words which the Assyrian uttered; for he ascribes to his
*power* and *wisdom* all the victories which he obtained. By *strength
of hand* he means vast armies collected out of various nations. Yet at
the same time he boasts of being a warlike king, as those blusterers are
wont to claim the praise of everything that was done under their
direction, though they were enjoying the luxury and ease of a retired
life. Afterwards he boasts that he was *cautious* and *wary*, to use an
ordinary phrase of our own, (<span id="xvii.i-p137.1"></span>*J’ay este
bien entendu et expert*,) *I was very skillful and clever*. But there
can be no doubt whatever that he bestows this honorable appellation on
the tricks and dishonest cunning by which he had gained advantage over
his neighbors. For what are the stratagems of kings and princes? To
disturb the peace by indirect methods, to invent pretences for quarrels,
to sow the seeds of discord, and, in a word, by their artifices to level
all distinctions.

<span id="xvii.i-p138"></span>*I have removed the boundaries of the
nations.* This means, “I have extended the boundaries of my dominion,
and have added other countries to my territories, so as to *remove their
boundary* and limit.” Just as if we were to say that the King of France
*removed the boundaries* of Brittany, Burgundy, Aquitaine, Provence, and
other countries, when he united them to his own kingdom. He likewise
adds, “that nothing was so secret or concealed as not to become his
prey;” as if he had said that by his sagacity he drew the neighboring
countries into his nets, fished their treasures, and brought into his
possession all that lay concealed.

<span id="xvii.i-p139"></span><span id="xvii.i-p139.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p140"></span>**14.** *And my hand hath found as a
nest.* He adds, that it cost him no trouble to vanquish kings and amass
their wealth; and he illustrates this by a comparison. As if one were to
seek *a nest and find one* deserted by the birds, and consequently to
take the eggs without difficulty; for if the parent birds were sitting
on the eggs, having an instinctive desire to protect their *nest*, they
would either fly at the robber, and attack him with their bill, or by
loud and unpleasant noises endeavor to drive him away. But this tyrant
boasts that there was no one who ventured so much as *to open the mouth*
against him, and therefore that he had no difficulty in bringing all the
kingdoms under his dominion. Accordingly, he lays claim to all these
things, and attributes them to his wisdom, and makes no acknowledgment
of the providence of God. These boastful pretensions the Prophet has
purposely related as coming from the despot’s own mouth, in order to
show that they were so many bellows to kindle the judgment of God; for
among men this haughtiness could not be endured, and how would not God
restrain it?

<span id="xvii.i-p141"></span><span id="xvii.i-p141.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p142"></span>**15.** *Shall the axe boast?* He now
ridicules more strongly the mad effrontery of the Assyrians in imagining
that he could create mountains of gold; for he tells us that the case is
the same as if *an axe* or *a hammer* should despise the hand which sets
them in motion, and should be proud of their activity, though it is
manifest that they have no power of their own to move. But before
explaining the subject more fully, I shall touch briefly on the words.

<span id="xvii.i-p143"></span>*Like the rising up of a rod against him
that raiseth it.*  <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) This second
class of the verse is somewhat obscure. The matter is plain enough, but
in the form of expression there is some ambiguity, in consequence of
which commentators greatly differ. Yet, when I examine the matter
closely, the rendering which I have given appears to flow more naturally
than the others. “What is this? If a staff rise against the hand of him
that raiseth it, and forget that it is wood, what a shocking exhibition
will it be!” For it is not uncommon that the particle <span
id="xvii.i-p144.2"></span>את, (*eth*) which is the sign of the
accusative, should mean *against*; and the copulative <span
id="xvii.i-p144.3"></span>ו (*vau*) is often superfluous. We shall thus
have a meaning which is not ambiguous, and which agrees with the words
of the Prophet. He formerly reproached the Assyrian for ascribing to his
schemes and his army the victories which he had gained. He now says,
that in this manner he boasts against God, just as if *an axe*,
reckoning as nothing the hand of him that cuts, claimed the praise of a
workman, or a staff, as if it were not dead wood and without any
strength of its own, rose up against him that wielded it.

<span id="xvii.i-p145"></span>Hence we learn that men rise up against
God, whenever they ascribe to themselves more than is proper, and that
in such cases they war not with men but with God himself. Away, then,
with those proud and blasphemous expressions, “By my power and wisdom
and perseverance I have done and contrived and accomplished these
things;”

<span id="xvii.i-p146"></span>for the Lord is a jealous God, (<span

<span id="xvii.i-p148"></span>We must attend to those comparisons by
which he likens men to instruments; and we must not view it as referring
to the universal providence by which all creatures are governed, as some
do, who acknowledge that all the creatures are moved by God, because
they cannot deny it, but add, that each of them is driven according to
its nature, as the sun, the moon, the heavens, and such like. Thus they
imagine that man is driven hither and thither by his own choice and by
free-will; because God does nothing more than continue that power which
he once bestowed at the beginning. Their false explanation amounts to
this, that the whole machinery of the world is upheld by the hand of
God, but that his providence is not interposed to regulate particular
movements. Thus they ascribe to God the rain and the fair weather
because he is the Author of nature, but contend that, strictly speaking,
God commands nothing, that the rain is produced by vapours, and that
fair weather also is produced by its natural causes. But this confused
direction, which they leave to God, is hardly the thousandth part of
that government which he claims for himself. Justly therefore, does
Isaiah show that God presides over individual acts, as they call them,
so as to move men, like rods, in whatever way he pleases, to guide their
plans, to direct their efforts; and, in a word, to regulate their
determinations, in order to inform us that everything depends on his
providence, and not on the caprice of wicked men.

<span id="xvii.i-p149"></span>It is objected, that it would be absurd to
call men *axes* and *swords*, so as to take away from them will and
judgment, and everything that distinguishes them from inanimate
creatures, and to make them, not men, but stocks and stones. But the
answer is at hand. Though God compares men to stones, it does not follow
that they resemble them in all respects. No one thing is exactly like
another, but they agree in some points; for as a staff cannot move
itself in any direction, and yet is fit for inflicting blows, so wicked
men have something which belongs to them by nature, and yet they cannot
be moved hither and thither, without being directed by the providence
and secret decree of God. This fitness of things, if we may so call it,
is no reason why the action should not be ascribed entirely to God
alone.

<span id="xvii.i-p150"></span>But the question about the will of man is
unseasonably introduced on the present occasion. If God controls the
purposes of men, and turns their thoughts and exertions to whatever
purpose he pleases, men do not therefore cease to form plans and to
engage in this or the other undertaking. We must not suppose that there
is a violent compulsion, as if God dragged them against their will; but
in a wonderful and inconceivable manner he regulates all the movements
of men, so that they still have the exercise of their will.

<span id="xvii.i-p151"></span>In this passage Isaiah chiefly shows that
all the efforts of men are fruitless, if God do not grant them success;
and therefore that the Assyrian, even if he had attempted everything,
would not have succeeded, if the Lord had not bestowed the victories;
and, consequently, that he had no reason for laying claim to the praise
of those things in which his success was owing solely to God. This is
confirmed by another metaphor, that the lifting up of a staff proceeds
from the will of him who moves it, and not from the nature of the wood.
 <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md)

<span id="xvii.i-p153"></span><span id="xvii.i-p153.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p154"></span>**16.** *Therefore shall the Lord, the
Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness.* He proceeds with the
former doctrine, declaring that the Lord will show to the Assyrian how
undeservedly he exalts himself, and will throw down his arrogance, in
which he foolishly takes delight. As he trusted in his wealth and his
forces, Isaiah declares that the Lord will take them away; and he does
so under the metaphor of *fatness* and *leanness*. By the word *fatness*
he means both riches and warlike power, in which he placed too much
confidence; as if he had said, “Everything *fat* and *rich* that he
possesses, the Lord will make the whole of it *lean*.” It is not
uncommon to compare prosperity to *fatness*; for as horses which are too
*fat* become refractory, so as to throw the rider or kick when any one
comes near them, so among men abundance produces fierceness of
disposition, which is subdued by *leanness*

<span id="xvii.i-p155"></span>*And under his glory he shall kindle a
burning.* There is great beauty in the comparison, that *a fire will be
laid under his glory*; for it means, that the greater the splendor of
his prosperity, so much the more abundant will be the fuel for the
conflagration. Yet it likewise shows that he will be utterly reduced to
nothing; as if one were to cut down a tree from the roots, or overturn a
house from the foundation. If nothing more than the branches of a tree
be cut down, it quickly sprouts again; or if the roof of a house be
consumed by fire, the other parts of it remain uninjured. He therefore
leaves him nothing, but asserts that he will be brought down by utter
destruction.

<span id="xvii.i-p156"></span>*As the burning of a fire.*  <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) The particle *as*, which points out
the comparison, does not mean that the language is metaphorical, but
rather that the burning will be such as to consume utterly the glory of
the Assyrian.

<span id="xvii.i-p158"></span><span id="xvii.i-p158.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p159"></span>**17.** *And the light of Israel shall be
for a fire.* There is an elegant allusion to that burning by which he
threatened that he would consume the Assyrians. In *fire* there are two
things, light and heat. As the Lord consumes the enemies by his heat, so
he enlightens the godly by his light. It is very customary that God is
sometimes called *a* *devouring fire*, (<span
id="xvii.i-p159.1"></span>[Deut. 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md),
[Deut. 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#003.md), [Heb.
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029.md)<span
id="xvii.i-p159.1"></span>,) and sometimes, in a different point of
view, he is called *light*, (<span id="xvii.i-p159.2"></span>[Isa
60:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#020.md)<span id="xvii.i-p159.2"></span>;
<span id="xvii.i-p159.3"></span>[Mic
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008)<span id="xvii.i-p159.3"></span>,.md)
because his power produces contrary effects on the godly and the
ungodly. When he shines on the godly, he imparts life and nourishment to
them, but he consumes and destroys the ungodly. In a word, while he
threatens destruction to the Assyrians, he likewise brings comfort to
the godly; and he does so in two ways, first, because they will see that
God revenges the injuries which they have received, and, secondly, that
they will be cheered by his light, and will thus receive a new life.

<span id="xvii.i-p160"></span>*And his Holy One for a flame.* What that
*light* is he states plainly, and without a metaphor, when he adds, *his
Holy One,* so that it is unnecessary to make a more lengthened
exposition. The meaning is, that he determines to protect that people
which he hath chosen, and which he hath separated from the rest of the
nations to be a peculiar people to himself.

<span id="xvii.i-p161"></span>*And it shall devour its thorns and briers
in one day.* He now shows that the favor of God, which shines in Israel,
will be like a fire to consume enemies. *In one day* means, that he will
burn them with a sudden and unexpected conflagration. It denotes an
uncommon and dreadful burning, which usually overtakes the wicked
suddenly, when they think that all is well with them, and that danger is
at a great distance. He next shows that, whatever defences they may put
forth, they will be like *tow*, which, as soon as it is set on fire,
will instantly be consumed.

<span id="xvii.i-p162"></span><span id="xvii.i-p162.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p163"></span>**18.** *And shall consume the glory of
his forest.* He goes on with the same comparison of a *burning*, and
declares that the fire will consume both the highest and the lowest, and
will leave nothing uninjured. It is possible that a fire might destroy
the higher parts of a building, and might leave the lower parts
unaffected.

<span id="xvii.i-p164"></span>*And of his fruitful field.* I do not
think that <span id="xvii.i-p164.1"></span>כרמל (*Carmel*) is here a
proper name, but rather an appellative, denoting a rich and fertile
soil; for to say that *Carmel* was held as belonging to the dominion of
the king of Assyria, would have been inadmissible. The meaning therefore
is, that not only will destruction overtake his *forests*, but the corn
will be consumed by the same fire; for it will not only range over the
heights, but will penetrate into the lowest places.

<span id="xvii.i-p165"></span>*From the soul even to the flesh.* This
comparison is taken from man. As man consists of a *body* and a *soul*,
so each part of him is liable to separate diseases. It frequently
happens that, when the *soul* is healthy, the *body* is diseased; and
often the reverse takes place; but when both are unhealthy at the same
time, the case is most dangerous. By this comparison, therefore, he
threatens that the Assyrians will have nothing safe or sound, but that
they will be devoted to utter destruction, because they will perish from
*the flesh* even to the *soul*; not that *souls* are mortal, but because
the vengeance of God will fall upon them also. This is truly dreadful;
for the design of chastisements is,

<span id="xvii.i-p166"></span>that the spirit may be saved, though the
flesh be destroyed,  
(<span id="xvii.i-p166.2"></span>[1Co
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005)<span id="xvii.i-p166.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="xvii.i-p167"></span>but when *the* *spirit* also is involved
in the destruction, what can be said or imagined that is more miserable?
The flame only scorches the godly, but does not consume them as it
consumes the ungodly, in whom it finds nothing but fuel fit for burning.

<span id="xvii.i-p168"></span>*And it shall be as the fainting of a
standard-bearer.* There is an allusion in the words of the Prophet,
which cannot be conveyed in another language. The meaning is the same as
in the other comparisons, that there will be utter destruction, like the
complete rout of an army when the standard has been taken. When the
ensigns have been taken, it is commonly followed by a great slaughter;
and when historians describe a fearful carnage, they tell us that the
ensigns were taken. He does not threaten these things against the
Assyrians on their own account, that they may receive advantage from the
warning or may be led to repentance, but to yield consolation to the
godly, that they may not think that the Assyrians will pass unpunished
when they raged so fiercely against the people of God, or entertain
fears either that the Lord has forgotten his promise, or that he cannot
frustrate their designs. If the Prophet had not put them on their guard,
many scruples of this kind might have arisen in their minds.

<span id="xvii.i-p169"></span><span id="xvii.i-p169.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p170"></span>**19.** *And the remnant of the trees of
his forest shall be a number.*  <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md)
When he adds that *the remnant of them will be a number*, he employs a
Hebrew idiom to express that *they will be few*; and thus he only
confirms the former statement, that the devastation produced, after the
calamity which God will bring on the Assyrians, will be so great that
there will be no difficulty in counting them.

<span id="xvii.i-p172"></span>*That a child may number them.* He goes so
far as to say, that they will be so few that those who are left of them
may be counted even by *a child*; for *children* have difficulty in
counting as far as three or four. Accordingly, the kingdom of the
Assyrians was formerly like some vast *forest*; but when *the trees*
have been hewn and thrown down, those which are left are few, and
scattered at great distances from each other.

<span id="xvii.i-p173"></span><span id="xvii.i-p173.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p174"></span>**20** *It shall be in that day.*
Returning now to the elect people, he describes the result of the
chastisement which was at hand. As it is painful and disagreeable to us
to endure calamities and afflictions, and as we refuse them so far as
lies in our power, the Lord points out to us the result of them, that we
may be taught to consider the design of them, and may thus bear more
patiently: as if he had said, “You would wish that the Assyrians were
driven to a great distance from you, and that you could live in comfort
and safety. But consider, that this chastisement is as necessary as
medicine would be for curing your diseases; for you do not acknowledge
the power of God, and you withdraw your confidence from him to give it
to wicked men. It is truly wretched to place the hope of salvation in
enemies, and to rely on those who aim at nothing but your destruction.”
In like manner, Israel relied sometimes on the Assyrians and sometimes
on the Egyptians.

<span id="xvii.i-p175"></span>*But shall stay upon the Lord* We ought
not to despise this compensation made for the diminished numbers of the
people, that the small portion which survived the calamity learned to
place their hope in God. Hence we see more clearly how necessary it was
that God should chastise Israel. The mitigation which he holds out, that
still a remnant is left, among whom the true worship of God is
maintained, is fitted to yield very high consolation.

<span id="xvii.i-p176"></span>*In truth.* This phrase is not
superfluous; for until the Lord had afflicted them, all wished to be
accounted the children of Abraham — all made profession of the faith,
and indiscriminately worshipped God; but it was mere pretense. Isaiah
therefore reproves this hypocrisy, and says that their hope will
afterwards be true and sincere when they shall have been cleansed from
impostures; for although they very haughtily boasted of their confidence
in God, still they continued to place their confidence in the assistance
of the Assyrians. Consequently, when they shall be chastised by their
hand, they will learn to trust in God alone, and will withdraw their
heart from the assistance of men. Hence infer that we cannot place our
confidence in God unless we altogether withhold our heart from
creatures; for we ought to rely on God alone in such a manner as not to
think it a hardship to renounce all other grounds of confidence. Where
this perfect confidence does not exist, there is no room for *truth*;
for *the heart is divided and double*. (<span
id="xvii.i-p176.1"></span>[Ps
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#002)<span id="xvii.i-p176.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xvii.i-p177"></span><span id="xvii.i-p177.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p178"></span>**21.** *A remnant shall return.* This is
a confirmation of the former statement. Yet in the words <span
id="xvii.i-p178.1"></span>שאר ישוב, (*Shear Yashub*,) *a* *remnant shall
return*, there appears to be an allusion to that passage in which
Isaiah’s son was called *Shear-jashub*. (<span
id="xvii.i-p178.2"></span>[Isa
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#003)<span id="xvii.i-p178.2"></span>..md)
In our observations on it, we stated that this peculiar name was given
him in reference to the event, that it might be regarded as a pledge of
the future deliverance concerning which his father prophesied. It was
necessary that the Jews should be confirmed in various ways, that they
might be convinced that the Lord would at length bring them back. This
is also the design of what he immediately adds —

<span id="xvii.i-p179"></span>*To the mighty God;* that is, to him whom
the people, after having returned from their former apostasy, will
acknowledge to be the guardian of their salvation. This attribute,
*mighty*, is ascribed to God for the sake of the occasion on which the
words were used. He might have thought it sufficient to have expressed
*power* by the name <span id="xvii.i-p179.1"></span>אל, (*El*,) *God*,
which also signifies *mighty*; but he chose likewise to add to it <span
id="xvii.i-p179.2"></span>גבור, (*gibbor*,) that is, *strong* or
*mighty*, in order to excite the people to greater confidence. How was
it possible for the people to betake themselves to the Assyrians and
Egyptians, but because they did not think that God was sufficient for
them? This is the source of all evils, when we are not fully convinced
that in God is everything that can be desired for our salvation.

<span id="xvii.i-p180"></span><span id="xvii.i-p180.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p181"></span>**22.** *For though thy people be.* He
casts down hypocrites from foolish confidence; for they reckoned it
enough to be the descendants of holy Abraham according to the flesh,
and, therefore, on the sole ground of their birth, they wished to be
accounted holy. Yet he exhorts the godly to patience, that they may
learn to await calmly that calamity and diminution of their number,
lest, when it took place, it should be unexpected, and give them
uneasiness. He therefore comforts them, that they may not be grieved at
so great desolation; for the Lord will at least collect *a remnant* of
it.

<span id="xvii.i-p182"></span>*The consumption decreed.* <span
id="xvii.i-p182.1"></span>כלה (*chalah*) means *to finish*, and it means
also *to consume*. The latter is more appropriate. He calls this
diminution of the people a *consumption*, and one that is *completed*;
for he employs exaggerated language, the import of which is, that they
were not far from utter extermination, there being very few that were
saved.

<span id="xvii.i-p183"></span>The word *Israel* may be taken either in
the genitive case, *of* *Israel*, or in the vocative case, *O Israel*,
 <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) so that in this way he
addresses the patriarch Jacob, or all the godly under his name. But it
is of little importance, for the meaning is the same, in whichsoever of
these ways it be taken; and therefore it may be read in the genitive
case, *of Israel*. Yet I am more inclined to view it as a proper name,
to denote the true, and not the spurious Israelite. The bold address to
the patriarch has a striking effect; for God, addressing a dead man,
declares to the living that what he had formerly promised, (<span
id="xvii.i-p184.1"></span>[Gen. 13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016.md),
[Gen. 22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017.md)<span
id="xvii.i-p184.1"></span>,) that the posterity of Abraham would be
*like* *the sand of the sea*, did not apply to a promiscuous multitude,
which had apostatized from godliness, but that there would be a kind of
interruption in a corrupt nation, till shortly afterwards it should be
renewed.

<span id="xvii.i-p185"></span>*Overflowing with righteousness,* or
*overflowing righteousness.*  <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md)
Another consolation is added, that this very small company *will
overflow righteousness*. When we see the Church distressed by such heavy
calamities, that we think that it cannot be far from destruction, we are
in danger of giving way to despondency, and of entertaining doubts about
the mercy of God. Those whose minds are impressed with just views of the
judgment of God, feel that this is the severest of all temptations. It
was therefore necessary that godly minds should be fortified against it,
that they might soothe their grief by pondering the benefit which would
result from this calamity. The benefit was, that *righteousness would
overflow* the whole world like a river; and he had formerly noticed
this, when he said (<span id="xvii.i-p186.1"></span>[Isa
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#020)<span id="xvii.i-p186.1"></span>.md)
that *the remnant* *would trust in God in truth*

<span id="xvii.i-p187"></span>The word *righteousness* is explained in
various ways. Some refer it to the preaching of the gospel, because by
means of it, as Paul says,

<span id="xvii.i-p188"></span>the righteousness of God is revealed from
faith to faith, (<span id="xvii.i-p188.1"></span>[Ro
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017)<span id="xvii.i-p188.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="xvii.i-p189"></span>and by the agency of the Apostles, who
were a small remnant of the Jews, it spread over the whole world. (<span
id="xvii.i-p189.1"></span>[Mr
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015.md)<span
id="xvii.i-p189.1"></span>.) Others choose rather to view it as meaning
that that *consumption* was an evidence and proof of the *righteousness*
of God in inflicting punishments so severe on his own people. But I
prefer a more general exposition of it, namely, “This *consumption* will
be sufficient to fill the whole world with *righteousness*. The
*remnant* which shall survive it, though small, will be sufficient to
cause such rivers of *righteousness* to flow, that the whole world shall
be *overflowed* by them.”

<span id="xvii.i-p190"></span><span id="xvii.i-p190.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p191"></span>**23.** *For the Lord God of hosts shall
make a consumption.* This repetition again wounds the self-complacency
of those who proudly despised God. It was almost incredible that the
Jews, to whom so many promises had been given, and with whom God had
made *an everlasting* *covenant*, should perish, as it were, in an
instant; and it appeared to be even inconsistent with the unchangeable
nature of God. The Prophet therefore declares that *the Lord* is the
author of this *consumption*, in order to repress the pride of wicked
men, who, relying on their present prosperity, thought that they were
beyond all danger, and, swelling with that confidence, ridiculed all
threats and warnings. “God,” says he, “will reduce your land to a
desert, so that in the very midst it will be desolate, and will resemble
a wilderness.”

<span id="xvii.i-p192"></span>*In the midst of all the land.* By *the
midst of the land* he means its very heart, that is, its most fortified
and best defended places. Some think that the word <span
id="xvii.i-p192.2"></span>נהרצה (*neheratzah*) is an adjective,
*determined*; but for my part I view it as a substantive,
*consummation*;  <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) and in this
sense it is used by Daniel and in other passages. (<span
id="xvii.i-p193.1"></span>[Da
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027)<span id="xvii.i-p193.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xvii.i-p194"></span>Paul quotes this passage, (<span
id="xvii.i-p194.1"></span>[Ro
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#028)<span id="xvii.i-p194.1"></span>,.md)
but in somewhat different words from what the Prophet uses; for he
follows the ordinary translation which at that time was generally used.
Though Paul wrote correctly and faithfully, and in accordance with the
Prophet’s real meaning, yet the words which he quotes from the Greek
translation have led many to depart from what the Prophet actually
meant. The Greek translator having used the word <span
id="xvii.i-p194.2"></span>λόγος, (*logos*,) that is, *a discourse*, many
have entered into discussions about the Gospel, and have said that it
denotes the repeal of the law, because it puts an end to ceremonies and
figures, and therefore that it is a short and concise *discourse*, by
which we are freed from the burden of the law under which the people
groaned. But that has nothing to do with the Prophet’s meaning; for here
he says that the *consumption* is a *diminution*, by which the people
will be almost ruined. Paul’s design is not different, and the Greek
translators meant nothing else; for by <span
id="xvii.i-p194.3"></span>λόγος (*logos*) they meant what is expressed
by the Hebrew word <span id="xvii.i-p194.4"></span>דבר, (*dabar*.)
Though the Prophet does not make use of the word <span
id="xvii.i-p194.5"></span>דבר, (*dabar*,) yet the word which he uses
means *a thing consumed*, that is, *consumption*, and the meaning of
both words is the same. In short, Paul there repeats (<span
id="xvii.i-p194.6"></span>[Ro
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#028)<span id="xvii.i-p194.6"></span>.md)
what Isaiah had said in this passage about the future *consumption* of
the people, and shows that this prediction was chiefly fulfilled in his
own time, when the Jews were cut off from the kingdom of God on account
of their ingratitude, and but *a small remnant* (<span
id="xvii.i-p194.7"></span>[Isa. 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md),
[Isa. 10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md)<span
id="xvii.i-p194.7"></span>) was preserved.

<span id="xvii.i-p195"></span><span id="xvii.i-p195.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p196"></span>**24.** *Therefore, thus saith the Lord
Jehovah of hosts.* He goes on with the same consolation, which belongs
to the godly alone, who at that time, undoubtedly, were few in number. A
great number of persons gloried in the name of God, and wished to be
accounted his people; but there were few who actually performed what
they professed in words; and, therefore, he does not address all without
reserve, but only those who needed consolation. The kingdom having been
destroyed, they might entertain fears about themselves and their
affairs, and might judge of their own condition from that of others, and
therefore it was necessary to comfort them. This distinction ought to be
observed, for otherwise it would be inconsistent to address to the same
persons statements so different.

<span id="xvii.i-p197"></span>*And shall lift up his staff against thee
in the way of Egypt*  <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) He adds a
ground of consolation, namely, that that calamity will be nothing else
than *the lifting up of a rod* to chastise, but not to destroy them. The
preposition <span id="xvii.i-p198.1"></span>ב (*beth*) denotes
resemblance. <span id="xvii.i-p198.2"></span>דרך (*derech*) means *a
pattern*, and therefore I render it, *after the pattern of Egypt*. As if
he had said, “Though the Assyrian be cruel, and in many ways aim at thy
destruction, yet he shall only wound, he shall not slay thee.” He
therefore mentioned the pattern of the Egyptian bondage, which was
indeed very wretched, but yet was not deadly. (<span
id="xvii.i-p198.3"></span>[Exod. 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo001.htm#014.md),
[Exod. 12:51](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#051.md)<span
id="xvii.i-p198.3"></span>.) It is customary with the Prophets, amidst
perplexity or disorder, to remind the people to contemplate that
deliverance by which God miraculously rescued them from the hands of
Pharaoh, who was a most cruel tyrant. The meaning therefore is, “As the
Lord was at that time victorious, and destroyed the Egyptians who had
leagued for your destruction, so now he will quickly vanquish the
Assyrians.”

<span id="xvii.i-p199"></span>Others render it, *in the way of Egypt*,
because the Assyrians made war against the Jews on account of the
Egyptians. But that exposition cannot be admitted; and if we carefully
examine the matter, it will be found that there is none more appropriate
than that which I have proposed, and which is also approved by the most
learned commentators. There are two clauses which form a contrast; the
oppression which the Egyptians laid upon them, and the calamity which
should be inflicted soon afterwards by the Assyrians. “As the oppression
of the Egyptians was not deadly, so neither will the oppression of the
Assyrians be. You have had experience of my strength and power against
Pharaoh, and so will you find it on Sennacherib.” If we did not explain
the clauses in this way, they would not agree with each other.

<span id="xvii.i-p200"></span><span id="xvii.i-p200.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p201"></span>**25.** *But yet a little while.* He means
not only the siege of Jerusalem, when Sennacherib surrounded it with a
numerous army, (<span id="xvii.i-p201.1"></span>[2Ki
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017.md)<span
id="xvii.i-p201.1"></span>,) but likewise the rest of the calamities,
when Jerusalem was overthrown, (<span id="xvii.i-p201.2"></span>[2Ki
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#004)<span id="xvii.i-p201.2"></span>,.md)
the Temple razed, and the inhabitants taken prisoners; for against those
dreadful calamities it was necessary that the godly should be fortified
by these promises. This ought to be carefully observed; for if we
neglect it, as other commentators do, we shall not be able to see how
the statements agree. Accordingly, the captivity of the people might be
called a *consumption*; for Babylon was like a grave, and banishment was
like death. But when the danger was immediate and urgent, and
Sennacherib attacked them with his army, and various straits were felt
by them in that siege, this consolation was needful; for Judea seemed to
be utterly ruined, and to outward appearance no hope of safety was left.

<span id="xvii.i-p202"></span>*My fury and indignation shall be spent.*
 <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) The consolation corresponds to
this state of things. “The Lord will spare thee. For a time, indeed, he
will delay, and will keep his assistance as it were concealed; but he
will at length rescue thee, and will revenge thy enemies whom he has
determined utterly to destroy.” If it be thought better to interpret
<span id="xvii.i-p203.1"></span>כלה (*chalah*) as meaning to *consume*
or *spend*, then he says that *he spends his anger*, in the same way
that we speak of *spending* years and our whole life; that is, “I will
cherish my anger until I completely destroy the Assyrians.” But the word
*finish* brings out the meaning more fully; as if he had said, “until I
have discharged all my anger.” This is the destruction which he also
threatens elsewhere (<span id="xvii.i-p203.2"></span>[Isa
52:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#001)<span id="xvii.i-p203.2"></span>.md)
to the *uncircumcised*; for when the hope of mercy has been taken away,
he executes his judgment against the ungodly.

<span id="xvii.i-p204"></span><span id="xvii.i-p204.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p205"></span>**26.** *And the LORD of hosts will stir
up a scourge for him.* Here Isaiah makes use of the word *scourge*, and
not *rod*, meaning that the Lord will treat the enemies much more
harshly and severely than they had treated the Jews. He threatens them
with extermination, and makes it more evident by two examples; first,
that of the Midianites, (<span id="xvii.i-p205.1"></span>[Jud
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#025)<span id="xvii.i-p205.1"></span>,.md)
who were cut off by a dreadful slaughter in the valley of *Oreb*, which
was so named from their leader, and, secondly, that of the Egyptians,
whom the Lord, when they pursued after his people, sank in the Red Sea.
(<span id="xvii.i-p205.2"></span>[Exod.
14:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#027.md),
[28](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#028)<span id="xvii.i-p205.2"></span>..md)
In the former passage, he refers to a narrative which was somewhat more
recent, and in the latter to one that was more ancient.

<span id="xvii.i-p206"></span>Hence we infer that the Lord hath
displayed his power in defending his Church, in order that, when our
affairs are in the most desperate state, we may remain steadfastly in
the faith, and, relying on his grace, we still may cherish a pleasing
hope. By means and in ways that are unexpected he often delivers his
Church, as he did by the hands of Gideon and Moses. We ought always,
therefore, to call to remembrance those benefits, that we may be excited
more and more to confidence and perseverance.

<span id="xvii.i-p207"></span>Hence we ought also to infer that all the
afflictions which we endure are the Lord’s rods with which he chastises
us; and yet he does not permit Satan or his agents to inflict deadly
chastisements upon us. On the other hand, an awful destruction awaits
our enemies, as we see in the Midianites and Egyptians. It is therefore
no small consolation that, when we compare our condition with theirs, we
see them, for a time indeed, in all the madness of joy and of wickedness
insulting the children of God, but at the same time learn what a
dreadful sentence has been pronounced against them; for they are devoted
to deadly and everlasting destruction.

<span id="xvii.i-p208"></span><span id="xvii.i-p208.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p209"></span>**27.** *And it shall come to pass in that
day.* It is uncertain whether he now speaks of the deliverance which
took place under Zerubbabel, (<span id="xvii.i-p209.1"></span>[2 Chr.
36:22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#023.md)<span id="xvii.i-p209.1"></span>;
<span id="xvii.i-p209.2"></span>[Ezr
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/ezr001.htm#002)<span id="xvii.i-p209.2"></span>,.md)
or of that wonderful overthrow of Sennacherib, (<span
id="xvii.i-p209.3"></span>[2Ki
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md)<span
id="xvii.i-p209.3"></span>,) when he besieged Jerusalem with a huge
army. This latter opinion is almost universally preferred; and indeed it
appears to be supported by what follows, for immediately afterwards he
gives a description of the country, and enumerates the chief places
through which Sennacherib should conduct his army, till he arrived at
Jerusalem itself, so that there appeared to be nothing at all to hinder
him from taking possession of the city. With this opinion I partly
agree, but I extend the prediction farther.

<span id="xvii.i-p210"></span>Isaiah intends to comfort the godly who
were involved in the present distress. It might be thought that the
promise failed, and that the calamities which immediately followed were
utterly at variance with it. For instance, if the Lord promise to give
me food for next year, and yet leave me altogether destitute of it, what
faith can I have in a promise so distant, if the Lord do not rescue me
from the present distress? Thus, the Lord’s promise, in which he had
said that he would deliver his people from Babylon, and would
continually assist them, may be thought to have failed, when it was
exposed to the jaws of that huge wild beast. With the view of meeting
this objection, the Prophet includes both promises, that the Lord will
be the guardian of his people, till at length he deliver them from
death. Some limit it to the slaughter (<span
id="xvii.i-p210.1"></span>[2Ki
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035)<span id="xvii.i-p210.1"></span>.md)
of Sennacherib’s army; but as Isaiah promises *the* *loosing*, or
*breaking of the yoke*, I have no doubt that he describes deliverance
from captivity. Yet he confirms the promise, that God will not only
rescue them from Babylon, but will also aid them against the besieging
army of the tyrant, whom he will not suffer to go beyond what has been
threatened.

<span id="xvii.i-p211"></span>*That his burden shall be taken away from
off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck,* He describes that
tyranny in two ways, in order to illustrate more fully how great was the
blessing of deliverance. If it be thought best to refer it to
Sennacherib, he had not laid on the Jews so grievous a yoke. The people
paid only some tribute, as we learn from sacred history. (<span
id="xvii.i-p211.1"></span>[2Ki
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#033.md)<span id="xvii.i-p211.1"></span>;
<span id="xvii.i-p211.2"></span>[2Ch
36:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#003)<span id="xvii.i-p211.2"></span>..md)
Why then has he employed two names in describing this tyranny? It may be
pleaded that he had in his eye the approaching danger; for that tyrant,
like a huge beast of prey, had devoured the whole of Judea by his
voraciousness, and had oppressed them to such an extent, that it
appeared to be almost impossible that his *yoke* could ever be taken
off. But I have already explained the view which I prefer, that he
describes the uninterrupted course of the favor of God down to the time
of redemption.

<span id="xvii.i-p212"></span>*And the yoke shall be destroyed from the
face of the anointing.*  <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) The
phrase, *the face of the anointing*, is explained by some to mean the
*fatness* with which *the yoke* is besmeared. But that interpretation is
too farfetched. Others more correctly view <span
id="xvii.i-p213.1"></span>שמן (*shamen*) as bearing its ordinary
signification, and as denoting *anointing* or *oil*. He again reminds
them of Christ, and shows that through his kindness they will be
delivered from that tyranny. *Anointing* is the name given to that
kingdom which the Lord had set apart for himself, and which he therefore
wished to keep unspotted and undiminished. When the Prophets intend to
applaud the majesty of that kingdom, they speak of the *anointing* which
the Lord had bestowed on it as a distinguishing mark, because it was a
type of Christ. (<span id="xvii.i-p213.2"></span>[Ps.
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md), [Ps.
89:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#020.md), [Isa.
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md), [Dan.
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)<span id="xvii.i-p213.2"></span>..md)
Though God established the rest of the kingdoms, still they were in some
respects profane; this ranked above them as holy and sacred, because the
Lord reigned over Judea in a peculiar manner, and because under this
figure of a kingdom he held up Christ to their view. For this reason,
also, it was promised to Solomon that his throne would be everlasting.
(<span id="xvii.i-p213.3"></span>[2 Sam.
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013.md), [1 Chr.
22:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1022.htm#010.md), [Ps.

<span id="xvii.i-p213.5"></span>[Psalm
89:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#005)<span id="xvii.i-p213.5"></span>..md)
As to the interpretation given by some, that <span
id="xvii.i-p213.6"></span>שמן (*shamen*) denotes the king himself, not
only is it too farfetched, but it conveys no solid instruction.

<span id="xvii.i-p214"></span>The Prophet therefore points out the means
of overthrowing that tyranny; for it appeared as if there were no reason
to believe that the yoke of so powerful a tyrant would be broken. He
shows that this will arise from the heavenly anointing of that kingdom,
that all may perceive that this benefit depends on the power of Christ,
and not on the ability of man or on chance.

<span id="xvii.i-p215"></span><span id="xvii.i-p215.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p216"></span>**28.** *He is come to Aiath.* The siege
of the holy city being now at hand, Isaiah sets before their eyes the
whole of Sennacherib’s march, that the hearts of the godly, by long and
careful study of it, may remain steadfast. This delineation was
powerfully calculated to allay their fears, when godly men saw that the
Assyrians did not move a step but by the appointment of God; for by the
mouth of the Prophet he had given a lively description of the whole of
that march.  <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) It is unnecessary
to spend much time in explaining the relative position of the places
here named, for it is enough if we understand that Sennacherib marched
through those places of which the Jews had been informed.

<span id="xvii.i-p218"></span>*At Michmash he will lay up his baggage*.
The words which we render, *He will lay up his baggage* or *armor*, are
translated by some, *He hath made a muster*; for <span
id="xvii.i-p218.1"></span>פקד (*pakad*) signifies also to *number*. I do
not dislike this interpretation, but prefer the former; for I understand
the Prophet to mean that the Assyrian *will lay up his armor*, that is,
the provisions, and the rest of the implements of war, *in Michmash*. It
is the custom of warriors not to lead forward an army without providing
the means of support, which they *lay up* in a safe and convenient
place, that the army may be supplied out of it with all that is needful.
Under the word *baggage* or *arms*, he includes not only *darts* and
*swords*, but all the supplies and provisions of war. The meaning of the
word <span id="xvii.i-p218.2"></span>כלי (*cheli*) is extensive, and
includes every kind of implements, and thus resembles the word (<span
id="xvii.i-p218.3"></span>*vasa*) which denotes *vessels* in the Latin
language.

<span id="xvii.i-p219"></span><span id="xvii.i-p219.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p220"></span>**29.** *They have crossed the ford.*
 <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) Some understand by this the
passage of the Jordan, but I do not know if it could be *crossed* by a
*ford* in that quarter.  <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) He
describes how great will be the terror when they hear of the approach of
the Assyrian, that the whole country will be struck with terror and
alarm, so that the Assyrian will subdue it without any difficulty. When
such dread has seized their hearts, they will freely surrender at the
first attack of the enemy, so that the conquerors will be allowed to
ravage at their pleasure. He passes from the singular to the plural
number, because he speaks sometimes of the king and sometimes of the
whole army.

<span id="xvii.i-p223"></span>*Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.*
He mentions *Ramah* in preference to the rest, because it was the
nearest town; and he describes the flight of the inhabitants of some
towns, as if the mere report had terrified them to such a degree that
they gave up their country into the enemy’s hand. After having spoken of
so great dismay, he adds. —

<span id="xvii.i-p224"></span><span id="xvii.i-p224.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p225"></span>**30.** *Neigh,*  <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) *O daughter of Gallim.* By the word
*neigh* he denotes the howling and cries which will be heard at a
distance. It is very common, in the Hebrew language, to call cities
*daughters*. He says that the howling will be so great that it will be
heard even by the neighboring cities; for at *Laish* will be heard the
groanings which will be uttered in *Anathoth*

<span id="xvii.i-p227"></span><span id="xvii.i-p227.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p228"></span>**31.** *Madmenah is removed.* In
exaggerated language he describes that city to have been shaken to such
a degree, as if it had been *removed* to another place. This relates to
the disorderly movements of a people in flight; as if he had said that
the inhabitants of that city were thrown into as great a commotion as if
the city had been razed to its foundations.

<span id="xvii.i-p229"></span>*The inhabitants of Gebim have gathered
themselves.* This may be explained to mean that they are so terrified
that they crowd together in a body. Others understand by it, that they
rush out in a disorderly manner, as if there were not room for a free
passage.

<span id="xvii.i-p230"></span><span id="xvii.i-p230.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p231"></span>**32.** *Yet a day.*  <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) Some interpret this, that the Assyrian
will yet remain *one day in Nob*, which was a village contiguous to
Jerusalem, as Jerome and others declare. But I rather agree with those
who think that it means, that he will have a great part of the day
before him when he halts there, in order to make preparations for
besieging Jerusalem on the following day. He intends to describe the
rapid march of the Assyrian, and how near Jerusalem was to utter
destruction; as if he had said, that he had but a small part of the
journey to perform, and that before *the day* was ended, he would arrive
at that city.

<span id="xvii.i-p233"></span>*He shall shake the hand.* This
contributes still more to show their terror; for Sennacherib, having
conquered the whole country, will threaten Jerusalem, as if he could
storm it by the slightest expression of his will.

<span id="xvii.i-p234"></span>*Against the mountain of the daughter of
Zion.* By a figure of speech, in which a part is taken for the whole,
(<span id="xvii.i-p234.1"></span>συνεκδοχικῶς,) he includes the whole
city under the name of *the mountain*, because that part was higher, and
commanded a view of the other quarters of the city. From this confidence
of the tyrant, he shows that Jerusalem was not far from utter
destruction; for the whole country, and even the city, was struck with
such terror that none ventured to oppose him. By these details,
therefore, the Prophet intended to give a more impressive view of the
kindness of God, that it ought to be ascribed to the extraordinary favor
and goodness of God, and not to human aid, of which there was none, that
Jerusalem was preserved, as if a sheep had been rescued from the jaws of
a lion.

<span id="xvii.i-p235"></span>*Behold, the Lord Jehovah of hosts.*
Almost all explain this passage as referring to the Assyrians. (<span
id="xvii.i-p235.1"></span>[2Ki
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035.md)<span
id="xvii.i-p235.1"></span>.) They think that the Prophet threatens
against them that slaughter with which the Lord destroyed them, after
that they had besieged Jerusalem. As if he had spoken in this manner:
The Assyrian will indeed be elated with such pride, that as soon as he
has seen Jerusalem, he will think that it is in his power. All being
struck with such dismay at his approach, that some shall flee and others
shall freely surrender themselves, he will imagine that all are subdued
under him; but the Lord will quickly reverse his condition, and *lop off
those lofty branches*

<span id="xvii.i-p236"></span>But for my own part, when I examine
closely the whole passage, and especially what he adds soon afterwards
about *Lebanon*, and the consolation which immediately follows, I think
that this passage ought to be referred to the Jews themselves. Isaiah
therefore proceeds, in my opinion, to threaten the calamities which
awaited the people. As if he had said, “Not only will he come to *Nob*,
but he will spread devastation far and wide over the whole country.
Everything in it that is excellent and lofty, he will completely waste
and destroy, in the same manner as if one should cut off branches from a
tree or cut down a tree from the root.”

<span id="xvii.i-p237"></span>This interpretation is confirmed by the
following chapter, in which the Prophet offers consolation against that
calamity; for the consolation agrees with this verse, and is added as an
appropriate remedy for soothing grief. Nor do I attach any importance to
the division of the chapter, which is often very absurd, and which
perplexes the whole of the Prophet’s meaning. I think, therefore, that
we ought to connect that consolation with these verses, as if there had
been no such division.

<span id="xvii.i-p238"></span><span id="xvii.i-p238.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p239"></span>**34.** *And he will cut down the thick
places of the forest with iron.* There is no difficulty in explaining
this metaphor, for it is plain enough that by tall and high trees is
denoted all that is powerful, excellent, or lofty. Thus he foretells the
destruction and ruin of Judea, which he compares to the *cutting down of
a forest*; by which he means that there is nothing so valuable that the
enemies will not destroy it, till they have stripped the whole land of
its ornaments.

<span id="xvii.i-p240"></span>*And Lebanon will fall violently.* He
mentions *Lebanon*, because that mountain, as we all know, was highly
celebrated for fruitful and highly valuable trees. Now, if he had been
speaking of the Assyrians, it would not have been appropriate to
introduce the destruction of *Lebanon*. Hence we infer that the Prophet,
in this passage, again threatens the Jews; and this agrees well with the
introduction of the discourse, for it begins with a word which calls
attention, *Behold.*
