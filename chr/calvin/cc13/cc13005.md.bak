*Calvin's Commentaries, Vol. 13: Isaiah, Part I*, tr. by John King,
\[1847-50\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="vi"></span>

<span id="vi-p1"></span>TO HIS SERENE HIGHNESS,

<span id="vi-p2"></span>EDWARD SIXTH, KING OF ENGLAND, etc.

<span id="vi-p3"></span>A TRULY CHRISTIAN PRINCE.

<span id="vi-p4"></span>JOHN CALVIN.

<span id="vi-p5"></span>Though I acknowledge that this Commentary has
been faithfully and skillfully compiled from my Lectures, yet, as it was
drawn up by another person, I was at first afraid, most illustrious
King, that if it should appear in public bearing your name on the
Dedication, I might be thought not to have acted properly towards your
Majesty. But this doubt was removed chiefly by one consideration, that
as a Prophet who was of royal descent, and a most noble ambassador of
Christ, the supreme King, is highly appropriate to your rank, so the
labor which I had bestowed on the explanation of his Prophecies would be
accepted and valued by your Majesty. His experience made him acquainted
with five kings exceedingly unlike each other in their dispositions, to
whom in uninterrupted succession he officiated as a teacher; and it is
unnecessary to inform you which of these you should chiefly select for
imitation, or to exhort you to that which you show that you are already
sufficiently willing to do.

<span id="vi-p6"></span>Uzziah and Jotham were favorable to him, though
they were not so courageous as they ought to have been in maintaining
the worship of God. His chief contest was with Ahaz, not indeed as an
open enemy, but as a cunning hypocrite full of fraud and dissimulation.
The servants of God cannot have a more dangerous class of enemies. His
successor, Hezekiah, not only treated the holy man with reverence, but
modestly submitted to his doctrine like one of the common people, and,
what is still more, endured patiently severe reproof when it was found
necessary. Manasseh, who was the last of them, and whom a strongly
supported Jewish tradition represents as having been his son-in-law,
subjected him to a frightful kind of torture, and wickedly put him to
death. But at the very time when he received assistance from those who
were not bad kings, and even during the reign of Hezekiah himself, who
was so valiant a supporter of godliness, he never ceased to be harassed
by sharp and troublesome disputes, and to undergo severe conflicts, so
hard and uncommon is it for men to assent to sound doctrine; and not
only so, but they who resolve to discharge the prophetical office
honestly and faithfully must carry on a continual war with the world.
The more earnestly ought godly kings to labor to aid the servants of God
by their countenance, that they may not be distressed beyond measure by
the insolence of the ungodly.

<span id="vi-p7"></span>But as this virtue is excellent and truly
heroic, so, if you search the history of all ages from the beginning of
the world, it has been uncommon, and there have been very few by whom it
was cultivated. Many have indolently and carelessly, as if it had been a
matter with which they had no concern, allowed the truth of God to be
crushed without making any resistance. But the greater part have been
openly hostile, and have opposed it with violence and rage; and would
that they who at the present day profess to be Christians were as
earnest in upholding the doctrine of salvation as they are haughty in
boasting of the name!

<span id="vi-p8"></span>Not to mention others, it may justly be regarded
as no ordinary consolation amidst the present distresses of the Church,
that God has raised you up and endowed you with such excellent abilities
and dispositions for defending the cause of godliness, and that you so
diligently render that obedience to God in this matter which you know
that he accepts and approves. For although the affairs of the kingdom
are hitherto conducted by your counsellors, and although your Majesty’s
most illustrious uncle, the Duke of Sommerset, and many others, have
religion so much at heart, that they labor diligently, as they ought to
do, in establishing it; yet in your own exceptions you go so far beyond
them all as to make it very manifest that they receive no small
excitement from the zeal which they observe in you. Not only are you
celebrated for possessing a noble disposition, and some seeds of
virtues, (which at so early an age is usually thought to be remarkable,)
but for a maturity of those virtues far beyond your years, which would
be singularly admired, as well as praised, at a very advanced age. Your
piety especially is so highly applauded, that the Prophet Isaiah, I am
fully convinced, will have one that will regard him with as much
reverence, now that he is dead, as Hezekiah did when he was alive.

<span id="vi-p9"></span>As to the advantage which you will derive from
the work, it is better that you learn that from your own perusal, and I
have made some observations on that subject in the Preface. There is
only one point on which I have resolved to say a few words to your
Majesty. After having proclaimed God’s just complaints against an
ungrateful people, and threatened against the Jews such punishment as
their base apostasy and inveterate rebellion deserved, that the time was
at hand when they should be brought into a state of frightful
desolation, the Prophet next speaks of a new and amazing restoration of
the Church, and promises that henceforth God will secure that, in spite
of enemies, it shall always be in a happy and flourishing condition.

<span id="vi-p10"></span>Such gladness and prosperity was tasted by
those who, after their return from the captivity in Babylon, having set
up their altars for sacrifices, could form the expectation of higher
blessings than those which they at that time enjoyed; just as we, by
beholding the dawn, are led to expect that the rising of the sun will
soon follow. But when, in the brightness of his Gospel, Christ, the Sun
of Righteousness, arose, all that had been so eloquently described by
the revelations of the Prophet was far exceeded by the event. Within a
short time the knowledge of the true God was spread almost throughout
the whole world. Pure religion, which formerly lay despised in Judea, as
in a dark corner, was circulated through all nations and provinces, and
began to be honored in such a manner, that innumerable tongues, in
harmony of faith, called on God.

<span id="vi-p11"></span>Having collected churches in various places,
the Son of God erected his royal throne in a conspicuous situation,
where it might be beheld from the rising to the setting of the sun. The
churches, endowed with extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, not only
obtained prodigious communications of the divine goodness, but were
themselves striking exhibitions of astonishing power, which even the
blind could perceive. And although the Son of God reigned under the
Cross, yet, amidst the arduous conflicts of persecutions, his glory
shone brighter, and his triumphs were more splendid than if the Church
had enjoyed undisturbed prosperity. At length, the haughty loftiness of
the Roman empire, yielding submission to Christ, became a distinguished
ornament of the house of God.

<span id="vi-p12"></span>But the continuance of this prosperity was
prevented by the malice and ingratitude of men; and thus the Spouse of
Christ, deprived of so costly a robe, degraded from so high a rank, and
stripped of such gorgeous raiment, was afterwards reduced to an
unsightly and wretched condition. Some remains, indeed, God preserved,
as it were in places of concealment; but, as to the external beauty of
the Church, nothing but desolation, confusion, and dispersion, was to be
seen for many centuries. And we see how, at this very day, the Roman
Antichrist, far and wide usurping and tyrannizing over the sanctuary of
God, tears, crushes, and tramples under his feet all that belonged to
God. For since the purity of doctrine is there corrupted by monstrous
errors, since shocking murder has come into the room of lawful
government, since the sacraments are in part debased by gross
corruptions, and in part exposed to disgraceful sale, what but
melancholy ruin is left of the true and natural beauty of the spiritual
building?

<span id="vi-p13"></span>Yet in our age, contrary to the expectation of
all, the Lord hath again begun to *raise up that which was fallen*,
(<span id="vi-p13.1"></span>[Am
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011)<span id="vi-p13.1"></span>,.md) that
there might at least be left among us an outline of the true temple, in
which God should be worshipped with purity, and according to the
requirements of the Gospel. Some inconsiderable persons, taken from the
common people, have been selected by him as his architects, to promote
this work by pure doctrine. It is, indeed, an arduous and extensive
work, though Satan should give us no annoyance. But now that he employs
every expedient for breaking down the Church, as soon as any portion of
it has been erected, what wonder is it if we have great and sorrowful
toil, and make small and feeble progress?

<span id="vi-p14"></span>Accordingly, the haughty tyrants scorn us, as
if, in our endeavors to overthrow the tyranny of the Roman See, we were
laboring to overturn Olympus. Those clever and ingenious men (as they
imagine themselves to be) indulge in ridiculing our perseverance, in
laboring hard to restore the condition of the Church, as if anything
fixed or permanent could be obtained. They imagine that they have so
solid a foundation, and are so well defended on all sides, that it would
be as difficult to destroy Popery as to mingle heaven and earth. But the
opinions of those men are somewhat various. The refractoriness of the
world being too great to admit of being placed under any restraint, they
hold that we labor in vain when we seek to correct vices, and to promote
a pure and faithful administration of the Church.

<span id="vi-p15"></span>The witticism of Erasmus is well known. “Whom
does Capito expect to be his tenth successor?” He could not deny that
Wolfgang Capito was a holy man, and labored with the purest motives to
reform the Church; but being convinced that it is idle for the ministers
of Christ to struggle to correct the wickedness of the world as if they
were endeavoring to cause the rivers to run in a contrary direction,
Erasmus, imitating the custom of lazy philosophers, represented all of
us, in the person of one man, as chargeable with inconsiderate zeal. But
on both sides they are greatly mistaken in not considering that, when we
repair the ruins of the Church, we give our labors to the Lord, in
obedience to his laws and injunctions, and yet the restoration of the
Church is his own work. Nor is it without good reason that this is
taught in every part of Scripture, and that it is so earnestly enforced
by the Prophet Isaiah. Remembering this doctrine, therefore, and relying
on the assistance of God, let us not hesitate to undertake a work which
is far beyond our own strength, and let no obstacle turn aside or
discourage us, so as to abandon our undertaking.

<span id="vi-p16"></span>And here I expressly call upon you, most
excellent King, or rather, God himself addresses you by the mouth of his
servant Isaiah, charging you to proceed, to the utmost of your ability
and power, in carrying forward the restoration of the Church, which has
been so successfully begun in your kingdom. First, you daily read and
hear that this duty is enjoined on you in the kingdom over which you
rule. More especially Isaiah, as I have said, calls *Kings the
nursing-fathers of the Church*, (<span id="vi-p16.1"></span>[Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023)<span id="vi-p16.1"></span>,.md) and
does not permit them to withhold that assistance which her afflicted
condition demands. Nor ought your mind to be slightly affected by the
consideration, that the Prophet pronounces a woe on all kings and
nations who refuse to give her their support. Next, your Majesty sees
plainly what is urgently demanded by the times. Though you may not have
great success in your labors, yet, knowing that this worship is
acceptable to God, and is a sacrifice of most delightful savor, you
ought not to be turned aside from your purpose by any event, however
calamitous. Seeing, therefore, that God exhorts you to be courageous,
and at the same time promises success, why should you not cheerfully
obey him when he calls?

<span id="vi-p17"></span>In another passage Isaiah says, *Prepare the
way, prepare the way for my people*. (<span id="vi-p17.1"></span>[Isa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010)<span id="vi-p17.1"></span>..md) It
is well known how hopeless was the return of the captives to their
native country. Nor did this event take place at that time; but the
Prophet, beholding by the Spirit what posterity some time afterwards
would actually enjoy, lest any of the godly should be disheartened by so
sad a spectacle, meets them beforehand with the assurance that there
would be no kind of obstructions so powerful and formidable that God
would not break through them to deliver his Church. Not less do we need
at this day to be cheered by consolation.

<span id="vi-p18"></span>It is of high importance, most noble King, that
you should be stimulated to activity by the consideration of the duty
enjoined on you; for Isaiah exhorts all kings and magistrates, in the
person of Cyrus, to stretch forth their hand to the Church, when in
distress, to restore her to her former condition. Yet there is this
difference between your condition and that of Cyrus, that he who was a
stranger to the Lord’s flock never was expressly taught freely and
willingly to come forward and undertake to be a defender of the Church;
but to you, to whom the Lord has not only given adoption, but has
likewise assigned a distinguished place among his sons, the Prophet may
be said to stretch out his hand and call you to this office. So much the
more boldly and resolutely ought you, noble King, to proceed in this
course.

<span id="vi-p19"></span>The matter is, as I have said, full of great
difficulties; and still greater are the annoyances by which it is
attended, and the dangers in which it is involved; for Satan never
ceases to employ innumerable expedients, if in any way he may succeed in
subverting or destroying the holy temple of God; and sometimes God
intends to make trial of our steadfastness by such attacks. But if you
lay it down as a settled principle, that there is nothing which you and
your most excellent Council have hitherto undertaken, or are now
performing, for restoring the condition of the Church, which is not
supported by the authority of God, you will unquestionably feel how
wonderfully he accomplishes all those things which he gives in charge to
his servants. From this happy result England will derive inestimable
advantage; and we, too, will congratulate you on your prosperity, and
that of your whole kingdom. Meanwhile, I shall aid those holy exertions
by my prayers, as it is my duty to do, since I have nothing better to
offer you.

<span id="vi-p20"></span>Farewell, most illustrious King! may the Lord
prosper and preserve your Majesty for a long period, aid and guide you
by his Holy Spirit, and bless you in all things! — Amen.

<span id="vi-p21"></span>Geneva, 25*th December*, 1550.
