<span id="xv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 8

<span id="xv.i"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p1"></span>Isaiah Chapter 8:1-22

<span id="xv.i-p2"></span>**1.** Moreover, the Lord said unto me, Take
thee a great roll, and write in it with a man’s pen concerning
Mahar-shalal-hash-baz.

<span id="xv.i-p3"></span>**1.** Et dixit Iehova ad me: Sume tibi
volumen grande, et scribi in eo stylo vulgari, (*vel, hominis:*)
Accelera ad diripiendum, festina ad praedam.

<span id="xv.i-p4"></span>**2.** And I took unto me faithful witnesses
to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

<span id="xv.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et adhibui mihi testes fideles, Uriam
sacerdotem, et Zachariam filium Iebarachiae.

<span id="xv.i-p6"></span>**3.** And I went unto the prophetess; and she
conceived, and bare a son: then said the Lord to me, Call his name
Mahar-shalal-hash-baz:

<span id="xv.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et accessi ad prophetissam, quae
concepit, et peperit filium. Dixitque mihi Iehova: Voca nomen ejus,
Accelera ad diripiendum; festina ad praedam.

<span id="xv.i-p8"></span>**4.** For before the child shall have
knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus, and
the spoil of Samaria, shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

<span id="xv.i-p9"></span>**4.** Sane antequam sciat puer clamare, Pater
mi et mater mea, tolletur substantia Damasci, et spolia Samariae, coram
Rege Assyriae.

<span id="xv.i-p10"></span>**5.** The Lord spake also unto me again,
saying,

<span id="xv.i-p11"></span>**5.** Rursus loquutus est mecum Iehova,
iterum dicens:

<span id="xv.i-p12"></span>**6.** Forasmuch as this people refuseth the
waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s
son;

<span id="xv.i-p13"></span>**6.** Quandoquidem rejecit populus iste
aquas Siloe, quae fluunt cum silentio, et gaudium fuit illi ad Rezin, et
filium Romeliae.

<span id="xv.i-p14"></span>**7.** Now therefore, behold, the Lord
bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, *even*
the king of Assyria, and all his glory; and he shall come up over all
his channels, and go over all his banks.

<span id="xv.i-p15"></span>**7.** Ideo, ecce Dominus adducit super eos
aquas fluvii, violentas et magnas: nempe Regem Assyriae et omne robur
ejus; ascendetque super omnes rivos, et transibit super omnes ripas
ejus.

<span id="xv.i-p16"></span>**8.** And he shall pass through Judah; he
shall overflow and go over; he shall reach *even* to the neck: and the
stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O
Immanuel.

<span id="xv.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et trajiciens in Iudam inundabit, et
transibit, pertinget usque ad collum. Et implebit extensio alarum ejus
latitudinem terrae tuae, O Immanuel.

<span id="xv.i-p18"></span>**9.** Associate yourselves, O ye people, and
ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries:
gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and
ye shall be broken in pieces.

<span id="xv.i-p19"></span>**9.** Consociate vos populi, et
confringemini; auribus percipite quotquot e longinqua terra estis.
Accingite vos, et confringemini; accingite, inquam, vos, et
confringemini.

<span id="xv.i-p20"></span>**10.** Take counsel together, and it shall
come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God *is*
with us.

<span id="xv.i-p21"></span>**10.** Consultate consilium, et dissolvetur;
decernite decretum, et non stabit; quia nobiscum Deus. (*Hebraice,
Immanuel.*)

<span id="xv.i-p22"></span>**11.** For the Lord spake thus to me with a
strong hand, and instructed me, that I should not walk in the way of
this people, saying,

<span id="xv.i-p23"></span>**11.** Nam sic dixit mihi Iehova, tanquam
apprehensione (*vel, roboratione*) manus; et erudivit me, ne irem per
viam populi hujus, dicens:

<span id="xv.i-p24"></span>**12.** Say ye not, A confederacy, to all
*them to* whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye
their fear, nor be afraid.

<span id="xv.i-p25"></span>**12.** Ne dicatis, Conspiratio, in
quibuscunque populus iste dicit, Conspiratio, neque timorem eorum
timueritis, aut formidaveritis.

<span id="xv.i-p26"></span>**13.** Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself;
and *let* him *be* your fear, and *let* him *be* your dread.

<span id="xv.i-p27"></span>**13.** Iehovam exercituum ipsum
sanctificate; et sit ipse timor vester; et idem sit pavor vester.

<span id="xv.i-p28"></span>**14.** And he shall be for a sanctuary; but
for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence, to both the houses
of Israel; for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<span id="xv.i-p29"></span>**14.** Tum ipse erit in sanctuarium; in
lapidem offendiculi; et in petram ruinae, duabus domibus Israel; in
laqueum, et tendiculum incolae Ierusalem.

<span id="xv.i-p30"></span>**15.** And many among them shall stumble,
and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.

<span id="xv.i-p31"></span>**15.** Et impingent multi inter eos; ideoque
corruent, et conterentur, irretientur, et capientur.

<span id="xv.i-p32"></span>**16.** Bind up the testimony, seal the law
among my disciples.

<span id="xv.i-p33"></span>**16.** Liga contestationem; obsigna legem
inter discipulos meos.

<span id="xv.i-p34"></span>**17.** And I will wait upon the Lord, that
hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

<span id="xv.i-p35"></span>**17.** Itaque expectabo Iehovam, qui
abscondit faciem suam a domo Iacob, et praestolabor eum.

<span id="xv.i-p36"></span>**18.** Behold, I and the children whom the
Lord hath given me, *are* for signs and for wonders in Israel from the
Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.

<span id="xv.i-p37"></span>**18.** Ecce ego et pueri, quos dedit mihi
Iehova, in signa et prodigia in Israel; a Iehova exercituum, qui habitat
in monte Sion.

<span id="xv.i-p38"></span>**19.** And when they shall say unto you,
Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep
and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living
to the dead?

<span id="xv.i-p39"></span>**19.** Quod si dixerint vobis, Sciscitamini
a pythonicis et divinis, qui mussitant et demurmurant; annon populus
Deum suum consulet, a vivis ad mortuos?

<span id="xv.i-p40"></span>**20.** To the law and to the testimony: if
they speak not according to this word, *it is* because *there is* no
light in them.

<span id="xv.i-p41"></span>**20.** Ad legem et testimonium. Si non
loquuti fuerint secundum verbum hoc, ideo nempe quod nihil est lucis.

<span id="xv.i-p42"></span>**21.** And they shall pass through it hardly
bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that, when they shall be
hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God,
and look upward.

<span id="xv.i-p43"></span>**21.** Tum per hanc terram transibunt
oppressi et famelici. Et accidet ut cum esurierint, irritentur, ac
maledicant regi suo, Deo suo, attollentes sursum faciem.

<span id="xv.i-p44"></span>**22.** And they shall look unto the earth;
and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and *they shall be*
driven to darkness.

<span id="xv.i-p45"></span>**22.** Et quum spectaverit ad terram, ecce
tribulatio et tenebrae, caligo, angustia, et ad obscuritatem impulsus.

<span id="xv.i-p46"></span> 

<span id="xv.i-p47"></span><span id="xv.i-p47.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p48"></span>**1.** *And Jehovah said to me.*  <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) This prophecy contains nothing new,
but is a confirmation of the preceding one, in which Isaiah predicted
the approaching desolation of the kingdom of Israel and Syria. He had
foretold that both countries would be deprived of their kings, before
the children who should soon afterwards be born could distinguish
between good and evil, that is, before they were grown up. (<span
id="xv.i-p49.1"></span>[Isa 7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016.md)<span
id="xv.i-p49.1"></span>.) But because the wicked are not terrified by
any threatenings, it was therefore necessary that this prediction should
be repeated and demonstrated by some outward sign.

<span id="xv.i-p50"></span>First, in order more effectually to arouse
the nation, God commands that this prophecy be made publicly known by
writing, that it may be understood by all. We have formerly said,  <span
id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) that it was the custom of the
Prophets, after having been enjoined to deliver any message to the
people, to sum up in a few words the substance of what they had said,
and to affix it to the gates of the temple; as may be learned from <span
id="xv.i-p51.2"></span>[Hab 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#002.md)<span
id="xv.i-p51.2"></span>; for if that passage be compared with the
present, the matter will be sufficiently obvious. But here something
peculiar is expressed; for God does not merely command him to *write*
the prophecy, but demands *a great and large roll*, in order that it may
be read at a distance. The smaller the writing is, it is the more
obscure, and can with greater difficulty be read. To the same purpose is
what immediately follows, *with the pen of a common man*,  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) for <span id="xv.i-p52.1"></span>אנש
(*enosh*) denotes any man of ordinary rank; and the meaning is, that not
even the most ignorant and uneducated persons may be unable to read the
writing.

<span id="xv.i-p53"></span>*Make speed to spoil, hasten to the prey.*
 <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) This concise brevity is more
emphatic than if he had made a long discourse; for any one could carry
home four words, and perceive in them the swiftness of the wrath of God,
and be truly and deeply affected by the judgment of God, as if it had
been pointed out with the finger. In short, God determined that he
should not waste words, because there was no time for controversy, but
that he should represent the matter by an outward sign. The Prophets
having so frequently, and without any good effect, threatened vengeance,
he gave a striking exhibition of it by an example, that it might make a
deeper impression on their minds, and be engraven on their memory. As
often as these words <span id="xv.i-p54.6"></span>מהר שלל הש בז
(*Maher-shalal-hash-baz*) were mentioned, they would recall to their
remembrance the destruction of Israel and Syria, and would make them
more certain of it.

<span id="xv.i-p55"></span>Isaiah having prophesied about the coming of
Christ in the former chapter, (<span id="xv.i-p55.1"></span>[Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)<span id="xv.i-p55.1"></span>,.md)
many improperly explain this also as relating to the same subject, that,
endued with heavenly power, he came to spoil *the prince of this world*,
(<span id="xv.i-p55.2"></span>[Joh
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#031)<span id="xv.i-p55.2"></span>,.md)
and therefore *hastened to the prey.* This ingenuity is pleasing enough,
but cannot at all harmonize with the text; for the true and natural view
of the context shows that in this passage the Prophet brings forward
nothing that is new, but supports what he had formerly said.

<span id="xv.i-p56"></span><span id="xv.i-p56.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p57"></span>**2.** *And I took into me witnesses.* The
noun <span id="xv.i-p57.1"></span>עדים, (*gnedim*,) and the verb <span
id="xv.i-p57.2"></span>אעיד, (*agnid*,) which the Prophet employs, are
derived from the same root, and the allusion is elegant, as if we were
to say, “I have called-to-witness witnesses.”  <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) As this was a matter of great
importance, he therefore *took to himself witnesses*, as is usually done
on important occasions.

<span id="xv.i-p59"></span>*Faithful witnesses.* He calls them
*faithful*, that is, true and worthy of credit; and yet one of them was
an ungodly and worthless apostate, who, wishing to flatter his king,
erected an altar resembling the altar at Damascus, and openly defended
ungodliness and unlawful modes of worship. Some commentators, I am
aware, are of opinion that it was a different person; but a careful
examination of the circumstances will convince any one, that this was
the same *Urijah*, of whom the sacred history declares that he was
slavishly devoted to the ungodliness and lawless desires of the king.
(<span id="xv.i-p59.1"></span>[2Ki
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#011)<span id="xv.i-p59.1"></span>..md)
As to those who think that it was a different person, because Isaiah
here calls this man *faithful*, such an argument carries little weight;
for the Prophet did not look at the man, but at the office which he
held, and which rendered him a fit person for bearing testimony.
Accordingly, he does not mean that he was a good and excellent man, but
that his office gave him such influence that nobody could reject him,
and that his testimony was, as they say, free from every objection.

<span id="xv.i-p60"></span>*Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of
Jeberechiah.* I think that this prophecy was affixed to the gates of the
temple, *Uriah and Zechariah* having been *taken* to be *witnesses*; for
he does not speak of a vision, but of a command of God, which he
actually obeyed, in order that these words, like a common proverb, might
be repeated by every person.

<span id="xv.i-p61"></span><span id="xv.i-p61.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p62"></span>**3.** *And I approached to the prophetess.*
What follows happened to the Prophet, I have no doubt, by a vision, for
the purpose of sealing the former prediction. The vision given to Isaiah
was, that he had a child by his wife, and was enjoined to give him this
name. There would, indeed, be no absurdity in admitting that the Prophet
actually had a son by his wife, and gave him this name; and I shall not
eagerly dispute with any one who is of that opinion. But as it is not
probable that this name was given to any man, and as there is no
evidence to prove it, I am more disposed to think that this was a vision
exhibited to the Prophet, in order to confirm the former prediction. He
calls his wife a *prophetess*, not in the same sense in which the wives
of kings, for the sake of showing them respect, are called queens, but
because in this vision she sustained a public character.  <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md)

<span id="xv.i-p64"></span><span id="xv.i-p64.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p65"></span>**4.** *Truly before the child have knowledge
to cry.* This is an interpretation both of the dark saying and of the
vision which was added to it; for although God did not intend to speak
in direct language, still it was proper that obscurity should be
removed. I interpret <span id="xv.i-p65.1"></span>הנער, (*hannagnar*,)
*the child*, to mean not the Prophet’s son, but rather all who should be
born soon afterwards. He declares that, before they are grown up, the
two kings of Israel and Samaria  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md)
will be destroyed.

<span id="xv.i-p67"></span>*Before the face of the king of Assyria.*
That is, at the disposal, or at the will, *of the king of Assyria*;
alluding perhaps to an ancient custom of carrying the spoils of the
enemies *before* the chariot of those who received a public triumph. In
like manner shall the spoils of Samaria and Damascus be carried *before
the king of Assyria.*

<span id="xv.i-p68"></span>This makes it still more evident that the
Prophet intended nothing else than to foretell the desolation of the
kingdom of Israel and of Syria. He does this for the purpose of
comforting the godly, and likewise of holding up to scorn the foolish
dread of the wicked king, who could not endure that the Lord should
assist him; for he rejected not only the promises, but likewise the sign
which was offered. In consequence of this, the Prophet goes farther and
farther in reproving his wickedness, and that of the whole nation. “Thou
dost, indeed, believe nothing, but the Lord will assist his own; and
thou shalt quickly see sudden and unexpected changes, by which the Lord
will deliver his people.” And yet these words were spoken not so much to
the king as to godly men; and hence we ought to infer that the servants
of God do not always speak so as to be believed by their hearers; for
Isaiah here addresses wicked men, in whom he produces no conviction.
Why, then, does he speak to them? To convict them more and more of their
unbelief, and to reprove them for it; and next, to render the goodness
of God more manifest: for who would not have thought that such
aggravated wickedness would entirely shut the door against the mercy of
God? And yet the Lord, by his goodness, rises superior to the wickedness
both of the king and of the people. The object of the Prophet therefore
is, to reprove the ungodly for their rebelliousness, and at the same
time show that God is always like himself.

<span id="xv.i-p69"></span><span id="xv.i-p69.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p70"></span>**6.** *Because this people hath despised
(or, disdained*  <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123) .md) *the waters
of Shiloah* That Ahaz may not slumber in unfounded expectation, the
Prophet all at once breaks off his discourse about the general safety of
the godly, and next threatens punishment on unbelievers. Some think that
he speaks against those who wished for revolutions; as it frequently
happens that the multitude are not satisfied with their present
condition, and desire to have a new king. Those who are diseased often
expect that, by a change of place, they will be in better health. So
perverse is the will of men, that when matters do not go to their wish,
they look for a change of their condition, snatch at it eagerly, and
hope to obtain from it some relief.

<span id="xv.i-p72"></span>But I think that the Prophet’s meaning is
more extensive, and does not apply to those only who desired a change;
but that the discourse is general, and includes all ranks; for impiety
and contempt of God almost universally prevailed, and he does not speak
of a few persons, or of a particular party, but of the great body of the
nation. I confess, indeed, that he excepts a few persons, servants of
God, who will afterwards be mentioned; but that does not prevent the
remonstrances of Isaiah from being directed against the whole nation;
for since almost all were corrupted, he justly reproves them all. The
offense is, that the people, distrusting their own weakness, sought
increased wealth and increased forces. He says, therefore, that they
*despised the waters of Shiloah*, because the Jews *despised* and
*disdained* their condition.

<span id="xv.i-p73"></span>*And their joy was to Rezin and Remaliah’s
son.*  <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) Some render it with
*Rezin*, but the preposition *to* expresses more fully the perverse
desire. He means that the Jews, perceiving that they had not strong
fortresses, looked in another direction, and longed for the wealth of
the kingdom of Israel. Beholding their small number and their poverty,
they trembled, and placed no confidence in God, but only in outward
assistance, and thought that they would be perfectly safe, if they had
as powerful a king as the Israelites had. Thus they *rejoiced in* the
riches of others, and in longing for them.

<span id="xv.i-p75"></span><span id="xv.i-p75.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p76"></span>**7.** *Therefore, behold.* He speaks in the
present tense, that all may attend more closely: *Behold, the* Lord
*bringeth violent waters*. We must attend to the metaphors which the
Prophet employs, for the style is much more elegant than if it had been
naked and unadorned. “It is as if he had said, Because the people are
not satisfied with their condition, and desire the riches of others, I
will show them what it is to have a powerful king.” For instance, if a
small nation, whose king was mean and little esteemed, had powerful
neighbors over whom an illustrious king reigned, and said, “How
delightful would it be to serve that prosperous king, to be the subjects
of the emperor, or of the kings of France; for their power is
irresistible!” would not God justly punish such an unlawful desire? The
more powerful that kings are, the more grievously do they oppress their
people; there is nothing which they will not attempt, they do everything
according to their caprice. Besides, they know no limit to their power,
and in proportion to their strength they indulge with less restraint.
The Lord reproves that mad desire of the Jews, in not being satisfied
with their condition, and in looking, not to the Lord, but to the
resources of powerful kings; and this reproof is far more graceful under
these metaphors than if he had spoken in plain and direct language.

<span id="xv.i-p77"></span>*Shiloah,* as Jerome tells us, was a small
fountain, from which flowed a little river that ran gently through the
midst of Jerusalem. That narrow river yielding them little protection,
they therefore distrusted it, and desired to have those great rivers by
which cities are usually defended and greatly enriched; for there is
nothing by which a country is more enlarged or more rapidly enriched,
than by those large and navigable rivers, which render it easy to import
and export merchandise of every description. He therefore compares
Euphrates, which was the most celebrated river in all the East, to
*Shiloah*, and pursues the same metaphor, meaning by those rapid waters
of the river the Assyrians, who would destroy the whole of Judea, and
would waste it like a deluge. (<span id="xv.i-p77.1"></span>[2 Kings
18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017)<span id="xv.i-p77.1"></span>..md) “I
will show,” saith the Lord, “what it is to desire those rapid and
violent waters.”

<span id="xv.i-p78"></span>*And he shall come up.* This passage ought to
be carefully observed; for we all have a distrust that may be called
natural to us, so that, when we see ourselves deprived of human
assistance, we lose courage. Whatever God may promise, we cannot at all
recover ourselves, but keep our eyes fixed on our nakedness, and sit
like bewildered persons in our fear; and therefore we ought to seek a
cure for this fault. *Shiloah*, therefore, that is, the calling or lot
which God has assigned to us accompanied by a promise, though we do not
see it with our eyes, ought to be our defense, and we should prefer it
to the highest power of all the kings in the world. For if we rely on
human aid, and place our strength in large forces and abundance of
wealth, we must look for the punishment which is here threatened by the
Prophet.

<span id="xv.i-p79"></span>The sacred history assures us that these
things were fulfilled, so that any one who shall read the history will
not need a lengthened exposition of this passage; for the Assyrians,
whom the Jews called to their assistance, destroyed them. This was the
just punishment of their distrust; and we see in it a striking instance
of the wicked greediness of men, who cannot be satisfied with the
promise and assistance of God.

<span id="xv.i-p80"></span>From this destruction of the Jews let us
learn to attend to our own interests. The Church is almost always in
such a condition as to be destitute of human aid, lest, if we were too
largely furnished, we should be dazzled by our wealth and resources, and
forget our God. We ought to be so well satisfied and so highly delighted
with our weakness as to depend wholly on God. The small and gentle
waters should be more highly valued by us than the large and rapid
rivers of all the nations, and we ought not to envy the great power of
the ungodly. Such is the import of what is written in the Psalms:

<span id="xv.i-p81"></span>“The streams of the river shall make glad the
city of God, the sanctuary of the tabernacle of the Most High. God is in
the midst of her; God will help her before the dawn. Let the heathen
rage, let the kingdoms be moved, and let the earth melt when the sound
is uttered. Jehovah of armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our
fortress.” (<span id="xv.i-p81.1"></span>[Ps
46:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004)<span id="xv.i-p81.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xv.i-p82"></span>If it be objected that we ought not to reject
human aid, the answer is easy. The Prophet does not condemn human aid,
but he condemns that wicked fear by which we are thrown into distrust,
and tremble, so that no promise of God can keep us within reasonable
bounds. Now, we ought to render to God this honor, that though all
things else should fail, we shall be satisfied with him alone, and shall
be convinced that he is at hand. And in that case it matters little
whether we have or have not outward assistance; if we have it, we are at
liberty to use it; if we have it not, let us bear the want of it with
patience, and let God alone suffice us for all that we need; for he will
be able to execute his promises, since he has no need of any outward
aid. Only let us trust entirely to his power and defense.

<span id="xv.i-p83"></span><span id="xv.i-p83.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p84"></span>**8.** *And crossing over into Judah* The
verb <span id="xv.i-p84.1"></span>חלפ, (*chalaph*,) which sometimes
signifies *to pass through*, here means to *attack* and *cut off*: that
is, it will not only water Judea, but will overflow it, so as utterly to
drown it; for it will spread far and wide on every part. He adds —

<span id="xv.i-p85"></span>*Even to the neck.* The comparison is taken
from a man who, entering a river, dips into it gradually, till the water
reaches *to the neck*. In this manner shall Judea be overflowed by that
rapid river, that is, by the Assyrian, till he be plunged up *to the
neck*. He means Jerusalem, which was the metropolis of the country; and
when the Assyrian came to it, Judea was at no great distance from
destruction.

<span id="xv.i-p86"></span>*The breadth of thy land.* That is, in all
directions; for he pursues his metaphor in his prophecy, and shows how
violent the Assyrian will be, and enlarges the representation of his
strength and violence by the same comparison; that is, by comparing him
to an impetuous river, which bursting through its barriers and
overflowing its banks, spreads far and wide, and overturns and destroys
everything by its violence. He proceeds in his discourse against the
Jews, as he had begun to do in the two former verses; for, having
foretold the destruction of the Israelites and Syrians, he likewise
threatens that the Jews, in their turn, shall be punished for their
unbelief.

<span id="xv.i-p87"></span>To understand this better, Isaiah’s highly
beautiful and closely connected discourse must be examined. First, he
turned aside to address others; for Ahaz was unworthy of being
addressed. *The Lord will give* *you a sign*; which was declared in the
former chapter. Next, he adds the manner of preserving Jerusalem, by the
sudden changes which should take place in Syria and Samaria. This was
confirmed, in the beginning of this chapter, both by a commandment and
by a vision. He now comes to the Jews themselves, that they may not hope
to escape without being punished, or be too highly elated by the
destruction of their enemies; for he declares that for them also a
reward is prepared, and that they, too, will be punished for their
wickedness and treachery, because they despised the Lord, and would not
rest satisfied with his promises, and signs, and acts of kindness
largely and bountifully offered.

<span id="xv.i-p88"></span>*O Immanuel.* It may be asked, Why does the
Prophet direct his discourse to Christ, instead of simply calling the
land “God’s holy land?” For there can be no doubt that by the name
*Immanuel* he means Christ. It might be thought that this expression was
used in order to express the disgrace more strongly; for, since Judea
not only was set apart to God, but in the person of the Mediator had God
as the guardian of its safety, it was disgraceful that it should be
destroyed by a heathen king. But I rather think that the Prophet added
this name, in order to hold out to good men some remnant of hope, and to
comfort them in so great a calamity; for, when the country was wasted
and cruelly torn, they might have lost courage. He therefore means, that
that desolation would not prevent the coming of the Redeemer, of whom he
had formerly spoken. As if he had said, “Nevertheless, the land shall be
thine, O Immanuel; in it shalt thou have thy residence and abode.” This
was, therefore, added instead of a consolation, in order to intimate
that the land, though torn and wasted, belongs to God and not to men.
The sudden change too a direct address (<span
id="xv.i-p88.1"></span>ἀποστροφὴ) is emphatic; for in this way the
Prophet solemnly declares his belief in redemption, that the Lord may
set a limit to the frightful calamities.

<span id="xv.i-p89"></span><span id="xv.i-p89.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p90"></span>**9.** *Associate yourselves.* The verb <span
id="xv.i-p90.1"></span>רעו, (*rognu*,) whether it be derived from <span
id="xv.i-p90.2"></span>רוע (*ruang*) or from <span
id="xv.i-p90.3"></span>רעה, (*ragnah*,) signifies *to bruise*. But as
<span id="xv.i-p90.4"></span>רעה (*ragnah*) signifies *to* *associate*,
some prefer taking it in this sense, which certainly agrees better with
the scope and argument of the Prophet. Some render it, *Bruise ye*, that
is, *bruise* the kingdom of Judah, or, *bruise* the Assyrians; but this
appears to be unnatural or far-fetched. That it describes the plans and
undertakings by which they endeavored to crush the Church of God, is
evident from its being immediately added, and a second time repeated, by
the Prophet, *Gird you*, that is, “Form a plan.” The word *associate*,
therefore, is the most suitable, unless, perhaps, it be thought
preferable to take the verb <span id="xv.i-p90.5"></span>רעו (*rognu*)
metaphorically; and I willingly favor that opinion, so as to make it
mean *to heap up*  <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) ; for those
things which are *bruised* must of necessity be violently pressed and
squeezed together. He therefore means not only *gathering together*, but
likewise *pressing closely together*; as if he had said, “Draw close to
one another, as if you were a dense mass.” This meaning agrees
beautifully, I think, with the scope of this passage; for to the same
purpose is what he immediately adds, “Arm yourselves, *Gird you*.”

<span id="xv.i-p92"></span>The Prophet rises into confidence after
having mentioned *Immanuel*, that is, God, who would assist his people;
and at the same time cherishes increased hope in opposition to enemies,
that though it might be thought that they had gained their object when
they had depopulated the country, still the Lord would be victorious,
and would preserve his people against the cruelty of their enemies.
Withdrawing his mind, therefore, from the sight of that calamity, he
turns to Christ, and, by contemplating him, acquires such courage that
he ventures to taunt his enemies as if he had vanquished them. We must
view the Prophet as on a watch-tower, from which he beholds the
distressed condition of the people, and the victorious Assyrians proudly
exulting over them. Refreshed by the name and the sight of Christ, he
forgets all his distresses, as if he had suffered nothing; and, freed
from all his wretchedness, rises against the enemies whom the Lord would
immediately destroy. This ought to be carefully observed; that, as we
have still to contend against the same temptations amidst those
afflictions which the Church endures, and by the weight of which it is
almost overwhelmed, we may direct our eyes to Christ, by the sight of
whom we shall be able to triumph over Satan and over enemies of every
description.

<span id="xv.i-p93"></span>*Ye peoples.*  <span
id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) Why does he call them <span
id="xv.i-p94.1"></span>עמים, (*gnammim*,) *peoples*, when it was the
Assyrian only that would lay waste Judea? I reply, the army of the
Assyrian was composed of various *peoples*; for he had subdued not only
the Chaldeans, but many other *peoples*; and, accordingly, that monarchy
consisted of various nations. Yet the Prophet might refer to the
Israelites, the Syrians, and the Egyptians, and to all others who were
enemies of the Church of God; for he does not speak of one stroke
inflicted on the Church, but of the incessant contests which the chosen
people had continually to endure. But in order to understand this
better, we must join with it the following verse, at the end of which we
find the words *for Immanuel,* that is, *for God is with* *us*; for this
is the security for our deliverance. Let men league together, and
contrive, and form plans and determinations, they will not be able to
accomplish anything;

<span id="xv.i-p95"></span>for there is no counsel against the Lord,
(<span id="xv.i-p95.1"></span>[Pr
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#030)<span id="xv.i-p95.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="xv.i-p96"></span>and therefore we must begin with this
foundation, if we wish to stand firm.

<span id="xv.i-p97"></span>But we must ascertain if all men have a right
to glory on that ground, for wicked men also boast that *God is with
them*, and in his name do not scruple to grow insolent and haughty; but
their glorying is idle and unfounded. Now, the valor of the godly rests
on the word of God, and proceeds from true faith; and if this dwells in
our minds, we may triumph over all our enemies; as Paul also teaches,
when he encourages the godly by this doctrine,

<span id="xv.i-p98"></span>If God be for us, who shall be against us?  
(<span id="xv.i-p98.2"></span>[Ro
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#031)<span id="xv.i-p98.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xv.i-p99"></span>First, then, we ought to make sure that *God
is with* *us*, which cannot be unless we embrace the promises by faith;
and if we have faith, we do not glory in vain. As to his addressing a
nation so distant, to whom that word could not reach, the reason is
obvious, that the efficacy of the word might be made known to
unbelievers, and that they might know that he would restrain the
Assyrians with all their warlike accoutrements, though they were at a
great distance; as if he had said, “You do indeed despise God, but it
will be easy for him to keep you at a distance, and to repress all your
rage.”

<span id="xv.i-p100"></span>*Gird yourselves.* This is not a superfluous
repetition; for it is far more difficult to expect the assistance of God
a second time, when we have once been delivered, than to embrace the
promise of one single deliverance. Besides, although the first attacks
of enemies do not so greatly alarm us, yet when we see them hardened in
their malice, their obstinacy reduces us to weakness. We have experience
of this every day; for if any danger threatens us, we may expect
assistance from the Lord; but if we are again in danger, we give way;
and so great is our ingratitude, that we scarcely think that God will
help us a second time. In consequence of this, we faint if we are
frequently brought into danger, and do not consider that God is never
wearied by doing us good, and by continually assisting us.

<span id="xv.i-p101"></span>Isaiah, therefore, intended to oppose this
frailty of men, that when armed foes had once and again attacked us, we
may stand firm. If, after being vanquished or weakened, they again
muster their forces, and do not cease to annoy us, let us not be
discouraged; for to-morrow, and the next day, and as often as they
league together, God will be able to frustrate and destroy them. Hence,
also, we are reminded of our condition, that we may be always prepared
for enduring additional conflicts, and may not think that we have done
all that was required from us, when we have once resisted; for Satan is
unwearied in his efforts, and continually labors to accomplish our
destruction; he animates his soldiers, and inflames them with new
eagerness. But although the contests must be often maintained, we are
certain of victory, and therefore we ought to fight boldly, and to
remain constantly on the field.

<span id="xv.i-p102"></span><span id="xv.i-p102.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p103"></span>**10.** *Take counsel.* After having spoken
of the forces of the enemies, he now comes to their *counsels*; as if he
had said, “Although the enemies may abound not only in armor and in
strength, but, in *counsel* and wisdom, still they will accomplish
nothing.” And this warning was very necessary; for it often happens that
we despise enemies, though powerful and well armed, because they want
*counsel*, and are guided by blind violence rather than by reason. He
therefore forewarns them that the craftiness of the enemies, and all the
arts by which they endeavor to gain advantage over the people of God,
will in the end be unsuccessful; and, therefore, that they will
accomplish nothing, though they be in want of nothing, and though they
may have a great abundance of everything, of forces, and *counsels*, and
crafty designs. He adds —

<span id="xv.i-p104"></span>*Speak the word.* To make the meaning more
clear, I have rendered it *decree a decree*. This relates to their
insolence, or it is the conclusion of the consultation; for after
deliberation a *decree* usually follows. He declares that all these
things will vanish into smoke. It is, therefore, sufficiently evident
what the Prophet means, and to what purpose this passage ought to be
applied; for it may be regarded as a shield by which we can drive away
all the terrors of enemies, whether they excel, on the one hand, in
forces, wealth, power, influence, and rank; or, on the other, in wisdom,
counsel, craftiness, sagacity, and invention, or, in a word, in
insolence. For we are well armed and very powerful, if *God is with us*;
and, therefore, all the contrivances or decrees of adversaries will
immediately vanish away.

<span id="xv.i-p105"></span>*For God is with us.* <span
id="xv.i-p105.1"></span>כי עמנו אל, (*ki Immanu-el*;) literally, *for
Immanuel*. We have already explained the force of this argument.  <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) For my own part, I have no doubt that
he alludes to the name which he formerly gave to Christ; for although he
means that God assists his people, yet as the majesty of God is not of
itself sufficient to support us, he contemplates God himself in the
person of the Mediator, in whom alone he has promised to assist us.

<span id="xv.i-p107"></span><span id="xv.i-p107.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p108"></span>**11.** *For thus Jehovah spake to me.* Here
the Prophet contends against another kind of temptations, that is,
against the unbelief of the people; and in order to make that more
manifest, it ought to be observed that there were two remarkable
temptations, the one external, and the other internal. The external
temptation came from professed enemies, such as from the Assyrian; and
when the people saw his plundering and cruelty, they thought that all
was over with them, because he had brought them almost to utter ruin.
The other temptation was internal; for that sacred people, which boasted
of having been chosen by God, relied on the assistance of man rather
than of God. Now, this was a most dangerous temptation; for it appeared
as if that nation, by its unbelief, refused admission to the promises of
God, which were daily offered, and which were continually sounded in
their ears. And what could the Prophet think, amidst so great
perplexity, but that the destruction of this wicked people, which did
not cease wickedly to reject the grace of God, was close at hand? The
Lord, therefore, determined that both the Prophet and his disciples
should be armed against a temptation of this kind.

<span id="xv.i-p109"></span>*As if by taking hold of my hand.*  <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) This is a beautiful metaphor, which
the commentators, I think, have not understood. He alludes to fathers or
teachers, who, when their words have not sufficient effect, seize the
hand of their children or scholars, and hold them so as to compel them
to obey. Thus the servants of the Lord are sometimes disposed to throw
everything away, because they think that they are laboring to no
purpose; but the Lord *lays* as it were, *his hand* on them, and holds
them fast, that they may go forward in the discharge of their duty. This
is well understood to be very necessary, and is actually experienced by
all who faithfully serve the Lord; for no temptation is more severe than
when they in whom faith ought to dwell revolt; and, in a word, when
faith appears to be banished from the world.

<span id="xv.i-p111"></span>This *taking hold of the hand* is,
therefore, highly necessary, because not only are we fickle and liable
to unsteadiness, but we are also by nature too much inclined to what is
evil, though no one entice us. But if the force of custom be added, we
are scarcely master of ourselves. Undoubtedly, we would every moment be
driven up and down, were it not that we are held by the powerful
government of God, and fix the anchor of constancy in firm ground. Every
one of us ought to meditate earnestly on this thought; for though we may
be convinced, yet when it comes to the trial we fail, and look at men
rather than God. We should, therefore, attend more carefully to this
doctrine, and pray to God to hold us, not only by his word but by
*laying his hand* on us.

<span id="xv.i-p112"></span>Besides, it ought to be observed that we are
exceedingly disposed to wicked imitation. When we see bad examples, we
are drawn to them with great force, and take the example for a law; for
when others go before us, we think that we have a right to act in the
same manner, and especially when it is not only one or a few persons who
have led the way, but the custom has become universal. What is in itself
manifestly wrong is concealed by the plausible cloak of public opinion;
and not only so, but all are carried, as it were, by the violence of a
whirlwind, to adopt an established custom, as if the will of the people
had the force of a law to authorize their corruptions. This has not been
the fault of a single age, but at the present day it abounds as much or
even more than before; for it is an evil deeply seated in all by the
corruption of nature, to reckon a prevailing error as a law. Hence arise
the superstitions of all ages, and those which at the present day exist
in Popery, the origin of which, if it be investigated, will be found to
be nothing else than that some persons have drawn others into the same
error; and thus almost all have been foolishly caught by the snares of
Satan, and the general agreement of men is still the chief foundation of
those superstitions. All defend themselves by this weapon. “We are not
alone,” say they; “we follow an immense multitude.”

<span id="xv.i-p113"></span><span id="xv.i-p113.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p114"></span>**12.** *Say not, a conspiracy.* First, we
must consider what was the condition of that people, for they saw that
they were not provided with numerous forces, and were not able to
contend in battle against such powerful enemies. They longed for outward
assistance, and eagerly desired to obtain it, for they thought that they
were utterly ruined if they did not obtain the assistance of others. In
this sense I understand the word *conspiracy*, that they thought it
necessary to have the assistance of allies. The word *conspiracy* being
employed by the Hebrews in different acceptations, and sometimes
denoting a *bond*, I take it in a good sense. But some take it in a bad
sense: “Behold thy enemies, the king of Israel and the king of Syria,
have *conspired* together.” But I rather agree with those who apply it
to the league and friendship which many unbelievers were desirous to
contract with the Assyrian. The Lord therefore admonishes Isaiah not to
regard the counsels of wicked men, though the whole of the people should
vie with each other in attending to them.

<span id="xv.i-p115"></span>*Neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.*
There may also be a twofold meaning; for some read it separately, as if
in this second clause the Prophet condemned in general terms the wicked
customs of the people. But these two clauses ought rather to be joined
together. “Let it not distress you, if your countrymen in the present
day plot about unlawful confederacies, and do not consent to them.” Now,
though the Prophet belonged to the number of those who needed to be
admonished not foolishly to dissuade others from following by faith, yet
the plural number, *say ye not*, shows that all the godly were taught in
his person.

<span id="xv.i-p116"></span>*Their fear.* Hence we perceive what is the
source of those wavering *counsels* by which men are agitated; it is,
because their minds are overwhelmed by *terror*, so that they are
violently hurried along without any moderation. He describes the cause
of all this, why the Jews so eagerly desired to have the Assyrians for
allies. It was because they were terrified beyond measure, and did not
expect to be preserved in any other way, and because their blind *fear*
did not permit them to look to the assistance of the Lord. This was the
reason why they so eagerly desired a league. The same cause of fear was
alleged both against the godly and against the ungodly; but all did not
fear in the same manner, for the godly composed their minds, because
they knew that God took care of their preservation, and, armed by the
promise of God, cheered their hearts whenever they mentioned the name of
*Immanuel*. But the ungodly, overcome by terror, thought of nothing but
the assistance of the Assyrians, did not consider that there is help in
God, and did not betake themselves to him. The Lord certainly does not
forbid the godly to *fear*, for they cannot avoid that; but he bids them
overcome that excessive terror by which the ungodly are swallowed up.
Let us not, therefore, by their example, gaze around in every direction,
and rush headlong to seek unlawful aid; and especially we must beware
lest *fear* take away our judgment. There is but one remedy for this
evil, to restrain ourselves by the word of God, from which proceeds real
tranquillity of mind. Comparing the condition of that people with our
own, let us learn to betake ourselves to *the name of God*, which will
be to us an impregnable fortress. (<span id="xv.i-p116.1"></span>[Pr
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#010)<span id="xv.i-p116.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xv.i-p117"></span>That the Lord did not speak to the Prophet
alone, is also evident from the words being in the plural number, <span
id="xv.i-p117.1"></span>לא תיראו, (*lo thireu*,) *fear ye not*. Peter
also has drawn from it a general doctrine, (<span
id="xv.i-p117.2"></span>[1Pe 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#014.md)<span
id="xv.i-p117.2"></span>,) warning us not to *fear* with the *fear* of
the ungodly, but to place all our confidence in God, and to keep our
eyes continually fixed on him, that we may remain steadfast, though
heaven and earth should be mingled. If that warning of Peter was ever
necessary, it is especially so in the present day, for we see all things
tossed up and down and mingled in frightful confusion. That we may not
be disturbed, the Lord withdraws us from beholding men, that we may, by
attending to his word, keep our position firmly. Peter, indeed,
understands this *fear* passively, while Isaiah understands it actively;
for Peter exhorts believers to perseverance, so as not to waver on
account of the threats and terrors of the ungodly; but Isaiah condemns
the *trembling*, which induced the Jews to seek heathen alliances. But
as it was not the intention of Peter to explain this passage, or even to
quote the exact words, and as he meant only to allude to that statement,
we need not wonder at this diversity.

<span id="xv.i-p118"></span><span id="xv.i-p118.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p119"></span>**13.** *Sanctify Jehovah of hosts himself.*
We have said that the reason why dangers lead to immoderate alarm is,
that wretched men do not raise their eyes and minds to heaven. The
Prophet now, therefore, proposes a suitable remedy for allaying terrors,
that they who dread the evils which threaten them may learn to give to
God the honor due to him. To *sanctify the God of armies* means to exalt
his power highly; so as to remember that he holds the government of the
world, and that the beginning and the end of good and evil actions are
at his disposal. Hence it follows that, in some respects, God is robbed
of his holiness, when we do not immediately betake ourselves to him in
cases of perplexity. This mode of expression, therefore, is highly
emphatic; for it shows us that no higher affront can be offered to God
than to give way to *fear*, as if he were not exalted above all
creatures, so as to control all events. On the other hand, when we rely
on his aid, and, through victorious steadfastness of faith, despise
dangers, then do we actually ascribe to him lawful government; for if we
are not convinced that innumerable methods, though unknown to us, are in
his power for our deliverance, we conceive of him as a dead idol.

<span id="xv.i-p120"></span>*And let him be your fear, and let him be
your dread.* He properly adds, that *God himself* should be the *fear*
and the *dread* of the people, in order to inform them that there awaits
them a just and lawful reward of their crimes and of their contempt of
God, when they thus in wretchedness and alarm tremble at dangers. Though
he speaks not only of *fear* but of *dread*, yet he does not mean that
the Jews should be filled with horror at the name of God, so as to
desire to flee from him, but merely demands from them reverence for God,
and uses both words in order to express continuance. He therefore means
that they will be free and exempted from solicitude of mind, if a
sincere fear of God be deeply engraven on their hearts, and never pass
away from them; and indeed every person who freely devotes himself to
God, and undertakes to fear him alone, so as to lay this restraint on
himself, will find that no haven is more safe than his protection. But
as the ungodly do not cease to provoke his anger by shameless
transgression, he harasses their minds by continual uneasiness, and thus
inflicts the most appropriate revenge for their careless indifference.

<span id="xv.i-p121"></span><span id="xv.i-p121.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p122"></span>**14.** *And he shall be for a sanctuary.*
He promises that the true worshippers of God will enjoy tranquillity of
mind, because the Lord, covering them, as it were, under his wings, will
quickly dispel all their fears. There is an allusion to the word
*sanctify* which he had lately used; for the word <span
id="xv.i-p122.1"></span>מקדש, (*mikdash*,) which means sometimes *a*
*sanctuary*, and sometimes *a place of refuge*, is derived from the same
root.  <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) The meaning therefore is,
that God demands nothing for which he does not offer mutual recompense,
because every one that *sanctifies* him will undoubtedly find him to be
*a place of refuge*. Now, although in this sanctification there is a
mutual relation between us and God, yet there is a difference, for we
*sanctify* him by ascribing all praise and glory to him, and by relying
entirely upon him; but he *sanctifies* us, by guarding and preserving us
from all evils. As there were few who believed and relied on his
promises, the Prophet wished that the godly should be fortified against
this kind of temptation; for there was a danger lest they should be
carried away by such bad examples as by a kind of tempest.

<span id="xv.i-p124"></span>The Prophet therefore meant, “The Lord will
be your best and most faithful guardian. Though others stumble against
him, yet be not you terrified; remain steadfastly in your calling.” And
here a contrast is implied, though not expressed; for a *sanctuary* may
be said to be a citadel situated in a lofty position, and a bulwark for
defending and guarding the godly, but for destroying and overwhelming
the ungodly, because they rashly stumble against it. We shall afterwards
see more clearly how this was fulfilled, partly during the reign of
Hezekiah, and partly at the time of the captivity into Babylon; and yet
at the same time Christ was prefigured, who was to be not a place of
refuge, but rather *a stone of stumbling* to the Israelites. Isaiah
forewarns them of this *stumbling*, that the godly may be aware of it.

<span id="xv.i-p125"></span>*To the two houses of Israel.* The Jews
ignorantly and improperly tear asunder this verse, instead of dividing
it. “God will be,” say they, “partly a *sanctuary* and partly a *stone
of stumbling*; as if by the two families he distinguished between the
godly and the unbelievers. On the contrary, he enjoins believers, though
nearly the whole multitude of both kingdoms should dissuade them from
obedience to God, not to be discouraged, but to disregard everything
else, and break through all opposition. The Prophet might have simply
said, *he will* *be for an offense to Israel*; but he intended to
express more, for he includes the whole nation, and declares that God
will be their destruction. The nation was divided into two kingdoms,
Ephraim and Judah; and, therefore, he mentioned both. There were,
indeed, some exceptions, but he speaks here of the whole body.

<span id="xv.i-p126"></span>This is a remarkable passage and cannot be
sufficiently called to remembrance, especially at the present time, when
we see the state of religion throughout the whole Christian world
brought nearly to ruin. Many boast that they are Christians who are
strongly alienated from God, and to whom Christ is a *stone of
stumbling*. The papists insolently and proudly boast of his name, though
they profane the whole of his worship by superstitions, and bring upon
it dishonor and reproach. Among those to whom a purer worship of God has
been restored, there are very few who embrace the Gospel of God with
sincere regard. Wherever we turn our eyes, very sore temptations meet us
in every direction; and, therefore, we ought to remember this highly
useful instruction, that it is no new thing, if a great multitude of
persons, and almost all who boast that they belong to the Church,
*stumble against* God. Yet let us constantly adhere to him, however
small may be our numbers.

<span id="xv.i-p127"></span>*For a snare to the inhabitant of
Jerusalem.* This is the second circumstance introduced for heightening
the picture; for, after having mentioned the two kingdoms, he names the
metropolis itself. Although the whole country was crippled, yet it
seemed that the Lord kept his abode there. He therefore means that God
became *a snare*, not only to the common people who were scattered
throughout the fields and villages, but to the nobles themselves, and to
the priests who dwelt in *Jerusalem*, who dwelt in that holy habitation
in which God intended that the remembrance of his name should be chiefly
preserved. That was testified also by David, that *those builders* whom
the Lord appointed *rejected the chief corner-stone*. (<span
id="xv.i-p127.1"></span>[Ps
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022)<span id="xv.i-p127.1"></span>..md)
Christ quotes this passage against the Jews, and shows that it applies
to himself. (<span id="xv.i-p127.2"></span>[Mt
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md)<span id="xv.i-p127.2"></span>;
<span id="xv.i-p127.3"></span>[Mr
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010)<span id="xv.i-p127.3"></span>..md)
This happened, indeed, in the time of Isaiah, but still more in the time
of Christ; for ungodliness and rebellion gradually increased till they
came to a height. Accordingly, both the highest and the lowest, who
always had obstinately disobeyed God, at that time broke out against him
still more with unrestrained indulgence, and therefore their destruction
also reached its height; for they were altogether rejected by God, whose
Son they had refused. Hence also we infer the eternal divinity of
Christ, for Paul shows that it is God of whom the Prophet here speaks.

9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033)<span id="xv.i-p127.4"></span>..md)
Now, he speaks not of a pretended God, but of that God by whom heaven
and earth were created, and who revealed himself to Moses. (<span
id="xv.i-p127.5"></span>[Ex 3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006.md)<span
id="xv.i-p127.5"></span>.) It is, therefore, the same God by whom the
Church has been always governed.

<span id="xv.i-p128"></span><span id="xv.i-p128.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p129"></span>**15.** *And many among them shall stumble.*
He goes on to threaten the ungodly, as he had formerly begun, and
declares that those who refuse to trust in God will not escape without
being punished. The threatening runs thus: “when they have *stumbled*,
they will then *fall*, and afterwards they will *be bruised*.” This
agrees with the former metaphor, in which he compared God to a stone.
Christ has alluded to that metaphor, including both clauses.

<span id="xv.i-p130"></span>“He who shall fall on this stone will be
broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will bruise him.”  
(<span id="xv.i-p130.2"></span>[Mt
21:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044)<span id="xv.i-p130.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xv.i-p131"></span>*And shall be snared and taken.* This agrees
with the latter metaphor, in which he compared God to a *snare* and
*gin*. Let not the ungodly, therefore, imagine that they are stronger or
wiser than God; for they will find that he excels them in strength and
wisdom, and that to their destruction. They must, therefore, unavoidably
be ruined; for either they will be utterly *bruised*, or they will be
*snared* in such a manner, that they can never extricate themselves.

<span id="xv.i-p132"></span>This threatening also regards the godly,
that they may not hesitate to withdraw from holding fellowship with the
multitude, and that they may not resolutely disregard the sinfulness of
revolt. Now, this does not strictly belong to God, but is rather, as we
would say, accidental; for it belongs to God to receive men into his
favor, and to give them a firm security for their salvation. That was
more clearly manifested in Christ, and is still manifested; and,
therefore, Peter reminds us that, though many unbelievers *stumble*,
this is no reason why their *stumbling* should obstruct the progress of
our faith; for Christ is notwithstanding *a chosen and precious stone*.
(<span id="xv.i-p132.1"></span>[1Pe
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004)<span id="xv.i-p132.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xv.i-p133"></span><span id="xv.i-p133.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p134"></span>**16.** *Bind up the testimony.* The Lord
now turns his discourse to the Prophet, and encourages him, while he
must contend against apostates and rebels, to discharge his office with
boldness and perseverance. This was highly necessary, for Isaiah had met
with great obstinacy in the people; so that if he had only looked at
their present condition, that is, at the unbelief of the people, and his
fruitless and unsuccessful exertions, he must have altogether given way.
On this account the Lord determined to confirm and *seal* his calling,
not only on his account, but for the sake of all who should obey his
doctrine; and if very few persons believed the words of the Prophet,
still the Lord testifies that his doctrine has been sealed to them, and
that, therefore, neither must he desist from his office of teaching, nor
must they cease to yield the obedience of faith.

<span id="xv.i-p135"></span>*Seal the law.* He compares the doctrine of
the word to a *sealed* letter, which may indeed be felt and handled by
many persons, but yet is read and understood by few, that is, by those
to whom it is sent and addressed. Thus the word of God is received by
few, that is, by the elect, though it is held out indiscriminately to
all. The word is therefore *sealed* to those who derive no advantage
from it, and is *sealed* in such a manner that the Lord unseals and
opens it to his own people by the Spirit. Some derive the verb <span
id="xv.i-p135.1"></span>צור (*tzor*) from <span
id="xv.i-p135.2"></span>נצר, (*natzar*,) and translate it *keep*. But
though this does not greatly affect the general meaning, still the
superiority of the rendering which I have followed  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) may be proved from the other verb
*seal*; for the custom in ancient times was, first, to tie a thread
around a letter, and then to *seal* it.

<span id="xv.i-p137"></span>We draw from it this highly useful doctrine,
namely, that teachers and ministers of the word ought constantly to
persevere in discharging their office, though it may seem that all men
revolt, and give no evidence of anything but obstinacy and rebellion;
for the Lord will reserve for himself some disciples, by whom his letter
will be read with advantage, though it be closed to others. The Prophet
afterwards employs the same metaphor, when he says, that *the word is
like a closed book*, (<span id="xv.i-p137.1"></span>[Isa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011)<span id="xv.i-p137.1"></span>;.md)
but there he only mentions wicked men, and here he mentions disciples,
to whom the doctrine of the word is not without advantage.

<span id="xv.i-p138"></span>It may be objected, Was it then the duty of
the Prophet to disregard the people, and to withdraw and shut himself up
with the disciples, among whom some good effect was produced? I reply,
this was not the Prophet’s meaning; for it was the will of the Lord that
Isaiah should appear in public, and cry aloud, and reveal his will to
all. But as he spoke to the deaf, and might be discouraged by seeing no
evidence of the fruit of his labors, the Lord determined to excite and
encourage him to go forward, even when matters were in a desperate
condition, and, satisfied with his disciples, though their number was
small, to become every day more and more courageous.

<span id="xv.i-p139"></span><span id="xv.i-p139.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p140"></span>**17.** *Therefore I will wait for the
Lord.*  <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) I have chosen to render
the particle <span id="xv.i-p141.1"></span>ו (*vau*) by *therefore*; for
the Prophet recovers himself, after having received from the Lord the
consolation which we have just now seen. “Seeing that the Lord is
pleased to have disciples to whom his doctrine is sealed, *I will wait
for him*, though *he hath hid his face from Jacob*, that is, hath
rejected and cast off his people.” This is a remarkable passage, and, by
meditating continually on it, we must be greatly encouraged; for though
it may seem as if the whole world had revolted, still we ought boldly to
persevere; and even though God *hath hid his face* from his people, and
they who professed his name have been cast off, still we ought to *wait
for him* with unshaken hope. This is the only remedy that is left to us.

<span id="xv.i-p142"></span>The word *wait* is exceedingly emphatic; as
if he had said, “Still I will not turn aside from God, I will persevere
in faith.” He increases the force of it by adding, *I will look for
him*; for the occurrence of any offense is wont to make our faith waver
and faint, and it is most grievously shaken when we see that we are
deprived of allies, and that there are open enemies who boldly take to
themselves the name of the Church. Offenses commonly turn us aside from
God, and perplex us in such a manner that we call in question the truth
of the word. This consolation is therefore highly necessary, whether the
Church is oppressed by outward calamities, or thrown into confusion by
the treachery of the multitude.

<span id="xv.i-p143"></span><span id="xv.i-p143.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p144"></span>**18.** *Behold, I.* Here the Prophet not
only testifies that he will wait patiently, but also gives an evidence
of courage, by appearing in public along with the disciples whom he had
gained to God, and who still remained. As if he had said, “Though others
may withdraw, yet I am ready to obey thee, and I bring along with me
those whom thou hast been pleased to preserve in a wonderful manner
through my agency.” He therefore declares by these words his unshaken
courage, and promises that he will persevere in faith and obedience to
the Lord, though all should revolt.

<span id="xv.i-p145"></span>*And the children.* By *children* are meant
the various classes of servants, agreeably to the ordinary custom of the
Hebrew, and also of the Latin language.  <span
id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) He speaks of the disciples whom he had
formerly mentioned. Hence we see what is demanded from those who wish to
be reckoned among the true disciples of the Lord. It is, to declare with
Isaiah that they are submissive and ready to hear, and that, as soon as
the Lord has spoken, they will yield immediate obedience. Now, teachers
ought to bring disciples with them, and not merely to send them before;
they ought, I say, to go before them, and by their example to point out
the way, as was formerly explained,  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) (<span id="xv.i-p147.2"></span>[Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003)<span id="xv.i-p147.2"></span>;.md)
otherwise they will have no authority in teaching. The apostle to the
Hebrews applies this passage to Christ, (<span
id="xv.i-p147.3"></span>[Heb 2:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#013.md)<span
id="xv.i-p147.3"></span>,) and draws from it an instruction which ought
to be a very powerful excitement to us, that considering ourselves to be
followers not only of Isaiah, but of Christ himself, as our leader and
instructor, we may press forward with greater alacrity.

<span id="xv.i-p148"></span>*Whom the* Lord *hath given me.* By this the
Prophet shows to whom our faith ought to be ascribed. It is to God, and
to his undeserved election; for Isaiah taught publicly, admonished every
person, and invited all without exception to come to God; but his
doctrine is of advantage to those only who have been given to him by
God. By *given* he means those whom God drew by an inward and secret
operation of his Spirit, when the sound of the external voice fell on
the ears of the multitude without producing any good effect. In like
manner Christ declares that the elect were *given to him by the Father*.
(<span id="xv.i-p148.1"></span>[Joh
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#006)<span id="xv.i-p148.1"></span>..md)
Thus we see that readiness to believe does not depend on the will of
men; but that some of the multitude believe, because, as Luke tells us,
*they had been foreordained*. (<span id="xv.i-p148.2"></span>[Ac
13:48](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#048)<span id="xv.i-p148.2"></span>..md)
Now, *whom he foreordained he likewise calls*, (<span
id="xv.i-p148.3"></span>[Ro 8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030.md)<span
id="xv.i-p148.3"></span>,) and efficaciously seals in them the proof of
their adoption, that they may become obedient and submissive. Such,
therefore, is the *giving* of which Isaiah now speaks. This applies
strictly to Christ, to whom the Father presents and gives disciples, as
it is said in the Gospel by John,

<span id="xv.i-p149"></span>No man cometh to me, unless the Father hath
drawn him.  
(<span id="xv.i-p149.2"></span>[Joh
6:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#044)<span id="xv.i-p149.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xv.i-p150"></span>Hence it follows, that he is also appointed
to be our guardian, to preserve us under his protection to the end.
(<span id="xv.i-p150.1"></span>[Joh
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#028)<span id="xv.i-p150.1"></span>..md)
Wherefore he saith,

<span id="xv.i-p151"></span>not one of those whom the Father hath given
to me shall perish. (<span id="xv.i-p151.1"></span>[Joh
17:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#012)<span id="xv.i-p151.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xv.i-p152"></span>*For signs and wonders.* Some consider this
passage to refer to miracles, but that is inapplicable, for the meaning
is totally different, namely, that all the godly will be regarded not
only with hatred, but even with abhorrence, as if they had been
monsters; and that not only by strangers or by professed enemies, but
even by *Israel*. We have experience of this at the present day; for
papists look upon us with greater abhorrence than they look upon
Mahometans or Jews, or even dogs or monsters. Though this is exceedingly
base, we need not greatly wonder at it; for it was necessary that this
prophecy should even now be fulfilled. It was experienced by Isaiah from
his countrymen, and has been experienced by all others who have followed
his doctrine.

<span id="xv.i-p153"></span>Nor is it only in papists that we discover
it, but in those who wish to be regarded as very closely connected with
the Church, the greater part of whom either view us with strong dislike,
or ridicule us, or, in a word, hold us to be monsters, because we are so
anxious, and give ourselves so much uneasiness, about the salvation of
the Church, the honor of God, and eternal life; and because we do not
scruple to undergo so many dangers, such hatred, censure, reproach,
banishment, poverty, hunger, nakedness, and, in a word, death itself.
These things appear monstrous to them; for when they are so careful to
protect their skin, how could they have a relish for the highest
blessings? But that we may not be disturbed by their reproaches, we must
arm ourselves with this exhortation of the Prophet.

<span id="xv.i-p154"></span>*From the* Lord *of hosts.* To show how
trifling and worthless is the conspiracy of the wicked multitude, he
contrasts the *God of armies* with the pride of the whole world, and
raises a lofty defiance; as if he had said, that he cared not though he
were universally abhorred by men, because he knew that God was on his
side.

<span id="xv.i-p155"></span>*Who dwelleth in Mount Zion.* The addition
of these words carries great weight; for although the people abounded in
every kind of crimes and enormities, still they boasted that they were
devoted to God, and, abusing his promises, condemned the true servants
of God who reproved them. On the other hand, the Prophets, in order to
shake off their false confidence and pride, declared that they were the
servants of the only and true God, whom the people falsely boasted of
worshipping *in Mount* *Zion*. God had not chosen it for his habitation
as if, because he was bound to the spot, he would accept of false and
spurious worship, but he wished to be sought and worshipped according to
the rule of his word.

<span id="xv.i-p156"></span>Accordingly, when Isaiah claims for himself
God *who dwelleth in Mount Zion*, he sharply reproves hypocrites,
because through false boasting they indulge in foolish pride whenever
they say, *The temple* *of the Lord*, (<span
id="xv.i-p156.1"></span>[Jer 7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004.md)<span
id="xv.i-p156.1"></span>,) for it was rather an idol in which they
boasted contrary to the word. Though they snatched at the promises, yet
they falsely tortured them against the true servants of God, as the
papists at the present day are wont to torture them against us. The
Prophets, therefore, distinguish God by this title, in order to tear the
mask from hypocrites, who were accustomed to quote the mere name of *the
temple* in opposition to the plain word of God. For this reason Isaiah
now says, “Take us, if you choose, for monsters, yet God acknowledges us
to be his own; and you cannot detest us without at the same time
abhorring the God of Abraham and David, whose servants we are.”

<span id="xv.i-p157"></span><span id="xv.i-p157.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p158"></span>**19.** *And when they shall say to you.*
Isaiah continues the former subject, which is, that all the godly should
not only use the authority of God as a shield, but should fortify
themselves with it as a brazen wall, to contend against all ungodliness.
He therefore entreats them to resist courageously if any one shall tempt
them to superstition and unlawful modes of worship. The plural number is
employed by him in order to signify that it was a vice which pervaded
all ranks, and which abounded everywhere; as if he had said, “I see what
will happen; you will be placed in great danger; for your countrymen
will endeavor to draw you away from the true God; for, being themselves
ungodly, they will wish you to resemble them.” At the same time he shows
how wickedly they had departed from God’s law and covenant, by
shamelessly pushing forward diviners and soothsayers whose name ought to
have been held by them in abhorrence.

<span id="xv.i-p159"></span>*Should not a people ask counsel of their
God?* Some read these words in connection with what goes before,
applying them to the ungodly, as if this were a pretense which they
abused in order to deceive the simple; because there is no nation that
has not oracles and revelations, but every nation *consults its gods*,
or, in place of them, magicians and soothsayers. But what I reckon to be
the more correct view is, that Isaiah advises his disciples to give this
answer if they shall happen to be tempted to wicked modes of worship.
Still the meaning is not fully cleared up; for this passage is commonly
expounded as if it were a comparison drawn from the less to the greater.
“What! seeing that the Gentiles consult their gods, and yet these gods
are false, shall we not more highly esteem him whom we know to be the
true God, and who hath revealed himself to us by so many proofs? What a
shame will it be if their idols are more highly valued by the Gentiles
than God is by us!”

<span id="xv.i-p160"></span>But I interpret this as referring to the
Jews themselves, who were called by way of eminence (<span
id="xv.i-p160.1"></span>κατ ᾿ ἐξοχὴν) *the people*, because God had
adopted them. Nor is it of any importance that the Prophet employs the
plural form <span id="xv.i-p160.2"></span>אלהיו,  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134) (*elohaiv*;.md) for <span
id="xv.i-p161.6"></span>אלהים (*elohim*) is used as in the singular
number. This is a shield by which all the superstitions which come
imperceptibly upon us ought to be repelled. While some ponder and
hesitate whether or not it be proper to consult diviners, let us have
this answer in readiness, that God alone ought to be consulted. The
Prophet alludes to that passage in Deuteronomy in which the Lord forbade
them to go to magicians and soothsayers; and lest they should excuse
themselves on the pretense that every nation had its interpreters or
fortune-tellers, added, that they would not cease to have a *Prophet*,
or be deprived of necessary instruction (<span
id="xv.i-p161.7"></span>[De
18:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010.md)<span
id="xv.i-p161.7"></span>.) It was therefore the will of the Lord that
they should depend entirely on his word, and should learn from it alone
whatever was useful for them to know, and should render obedience to
him.

<span id="xv.i-p162"></span>*From the living to the dead.* The
preposition <span id="xv.i-p162.1"></span>בעד (*begnad*) is variously
rendered: frequently it is translated *for*; and in that case the
meaning will be, “Shall *the dead* be consulted *for* the business of
*the living*?” But as that meaning is forced, it would perhaps be better
to explain it thus: “The Lord desires to be our teacher, and for that
purpose hath appointed prophets, that we may learn from them his will,
for a prophet is the mouth of the Lord. It is therefore unlawful to go
*to the dead*, who have not been appointed for that end; for God did not
intend to make use of *the dead* for instructing us.”

<span id="xv.i-p163"></span>But when I examine the whole matter more
closely, I choose rather to consider <span id="xv.i-p163.1"></span>בעד
(*begnad*) to mean *from*, that is, *from the living to the dead*; as if
he had said, “One God is sufficient for us for *the living and the
dead*. If you search through heaven, earth, and hell, you will find that
one God is sufficient for us.” This is, I think, the best sense, and
flows naturally. Accordingly, the Prophet arms the godly against the
schemes and contrivances of wicked men by whom they might otherwise have
been tempted to revolt, with the exhortation to be satisfied with God
alone as their teacher, and not to offer him such an insult as to
disregard his instruction and seek other teachers, but to cast away
everything else, and depend on his truth alone, which immediately
afterwards he again repeats and confirms.

<span id="xv.i-p164"></span><span id="xv.i-p164.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p165"></span>**20.** *To the law and testimony.* There
are indeed various ways of explaining this passage. Some think that it
is the form of an oath, as if the Prophet were swearing *by the law*
that they were apostates, and would entice others to a similar apostasy.
But I take a different view of it, which is, that he directs our
attention *to the law and the testimony*; for the preposition <span
id="xv.i-p165.1"></span>ל, (*lamed*,) *to*, plainly shows that this is
the meaning. Now, *the testimony* is joined with the *law*, not as if it
were different, but for the sake of explanation, “*to the law*,” which
contains *the testimony* or *declaration* of the will of God toward us.
In short, we ought to take the word *testimony* as describing a quality,
in order to inform us what advantage we derive from *the law*; namely,
that God reveals himself to us in *the law*, and declares what is that
relation to us which he chooses to hold, and lays down what he demands
from us, and in short everything necessary to be known.

<span id="xv.i-p166"></span>It is therefore a very high commendation of
*the law* that it contains the doctrine of salvation, and the rule of a
good and happy life. For this reason also he justly forbids us to turn
aside from it in the smallest degree; as if he should say, “Forsake all
the superstitions on which they are so madly bent; for they are not
satisfied with having God alone, and call to their aid innumerable
inventions.” In this manner also Christ speaks,

<span id="xv.i-p167"></span>They have Moses and the prophets, let them
hear them, (<span id="xv.i-p167.1"></span>[Lu
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#029)<span id="xv.i-p167.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="xv.i-p168"></span>for though Abraham is there brought forward
as the speaker, still it is a permanent oracle which is uttered by the
mouth of God. We are therefore enjoined to *hear the law and the
prophets,* that we may not be under the influence of eager curiosity, or
seek to learn anything from *the dead*. If *the law and the prophets*
had not been sufficient, the Lord would not have refused to allow us
other assistance.

<span id="xv.i-p169"></span>Hence we learn that everything which is
added to the word must be condemned and rejected. It is the will of the
Lord that we shall depend wholly on his word, and that our knowledge
shall be confined within its limits; and therefore, if we lend our ears
to others, we take a liberty which he has forbidden, and offer to him a
gross insult. Everything that is introduced by men on their own
authority will be nothing else than a corruption of the word; and
consequently, if we wish to obey God, we must reject all other
instructors. He likewise warns us that, if we abide by *the law* of the
Lord, we shall be protected against superstitions and wicked modes of
worship; for, as Paul calls

<span id="xv.i-p170"></span>the word of God is the sword of the
Spirit,  
(<span id="xv.i-p170.2"></span>[Eph
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017)<span id="xv.i-p170.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="xv.i-p171"></span>so by the word, Satan and all his
contrivances are put to flight. We ought therefore to flee to him
whenever we shall be attacked by enemies, that, being armed with it, we
may contend valiantly, and at length put them to flight.

<span id="xv.i-p172"></span>*If they shall not speak.* I do not relate
all the expositions of this passage, for that would be too tedious; and
I consider the true exposition to be so well supported that it will
easily refute all others. It is usually explained to mean that wicked
men trifle with their inventions, and expose their impostures to sale,
*because there is no* *light in them*; that is, because they have not
ordinary understanding. For my own part, I consider this to be a reason
for encouraging believers to perseverance; that if wicked men depart
from the true doctrine, they will evince nothing else than their own
blindness and darkness. We ought to despise their folly, that it may not
be an obstruction to us; as Christ also teaches us that we should boldly
set aside such persons, so as not to be in any degree affected by their
blindness or obstinacy. “*They are blind*,” says he, “*and leaders of
the blind*. Do you wish of your own accord to perish with them?” (<span
id="xv.i-p172.1"></span>[Mt 15:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#014.md)<span
id="xv.i-p172.1"></span>.)

<span id="xv.i-p173"></span>The Prophet therefore enjoins us to ascribe
to the word such high authority, that we shall venture boldly to despise
the whole world, if the word be opposed by them; for if even angels
should do this, we might condemn them also by the authority of the word.

<span id="xv.i-p174"></span>If an angel from heaven, says Paul, preach
anything else, let him be accursed. (<span id="xv.i-p174.1"></span>[Gal.
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#009)<span id="xv.i-p174.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xv.i-p175"></span>How much more boldly, therefore, shall we
condemn men who set themselves in opposition to God? The mode of
expression is emphatic, *If they shall not speak according to this
word*. He brings an accusation of blindness against every man who does
not instantly and without dispute adopt this sentiment, that we ought
not to be wise beyond *the law* of God.

<span id="xv.i-p176"></span><span id="xv.i-p176.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p177"></span>**21.** *Then they shall pass through that
land.* Not to permit believers to be ensnared by the common errors, he
adds how dreadful is the punishment which awaits the ungodly when they
have revolted from God, and have labored to induce others to join in the
same revolt. The passage is somewhat obscure; but the obscurity arises
from the want of proper attention in examining the words. The verb <span
id="xv.i-p177.1"></span>עבר (*gnabar*) is emphatic; for by *passing
through* he means that *uncertainty* in which men wander up and down,
and are not able to find a resting-place, or any permanent abode. To the
indefinite verb we must supply a noun, *The Jews shall pass*. By the
pronoun <span id="xv.i-p177.2"></span>בה, (*bahh*,) *in it*,  <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) he means Judea, which the Lord had
preferred to all other countries; and therefore it is easily understood,
though the Prophet does not express it. As if he had said, “I promised
indeed that that country would be the perpetual inheritance of my
people, (<span id="xv.i-p178.1"></span>[Gen.
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015.md), [Gen.
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#008)<span id="xv.i-p178.1"></span>;.md)
but they shall lead a wandering and restless life, as is the case with
those who, driven from their habitations, and afflicted with hunger and
pestilence and every kind of calamities, seek, but nowhere find, a
better condition and abode.” These words are therefore contrasted with
the extraordinary kindness of God, which is so frequently mentioned by
Moses, namely, that they will have a fixed residence in Judea; for here
he threatens that they will be stragglers and wanderers, not in their
own, but in a foreign country; so that, wherever they come, they will be
attacked and hunted down by innumerable vexations.

<span id="xv.i-p179"></span>*When they shall be hungry.* The Prophet
appears to point out the conversion of the Jews, as if he had said,
“When they have been weighed down by afflictions they will at length
repent;” and undoubtedly this is the remedy by which the Lord generally
cures the disease of obstinacy. Yet if any one suppose that the word
*hunger* describes the indignation and roaring of the wicked without
repentance, it may be stated that it includes not only hunger and
thirst, but, by a figure of speech in which a part is taken for the
whole, (<span id="xv.i-p179.1"></span>συνεκδοχικῶς,) every other kind of
calamity.

<span id="xv.i-p180"></span>*They shall fret themselves.*  <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) They will begin to be displeased with
themselves, and to loathe all the supports on which they had formerly
relied; and this is the beginning of repentance; for in prosperity we
flatter ourselves, but in sore adversity we loathe everything that is
around us. But if it be thought preferable to refer it to the reprobate,
this word denotes the bitterness, which is so far from leading them to
humility that it rather aggravates their rage.

<span id="xv.i-p182"></span>*And curse their king and their God.* By
*King* some suppose that he means *God*. In this sense Zephaniah used
the word <span id="xv.i-p182.1"></span>מלכם (*malcham*), that is, *their
King*. (<span id="xv.i-p182.2"></span>[Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005)<span id="xv.i-p182.2"></span>..md)
But here I draw a distinction between *King* and *God*; for wicked men
are first blinded by a false confidence in idols, and afterwards they
place their defense in earthly things. When the Jews had a *king*, they
were proud of his glory and power; and when Isaiah preached, wicked men
enraged *the king* against him, and even aroused the whole of the nation
to follow *the king* as their standard-bearer. Since, therefore, their
false boasting had been partly in the idols and partly in *the king*, he
threatens that they will be afflicted with so many calamities, that they
will be constrained to abhor both *their gods and the king*. And this is
the beginning of repentance, to loathe and drive far from us everything
that kept us back or led us away from God.

<span id="xv.i-p183"></span>*And look upward*. He describes the
trembling and agitation of mind by which wretched men are tormented
until they have learned steadfastly to look up. There is, indeed, some
proficiency, as I lately hinted, when, in consequence of having been
taught by afflictions and chastisements, we throw away our indifference
and endeavor to find out remedies. But we must advance farther. Fixing
our eye on God alone we must not gaze on all sides, or through
fickleness be *tossed to and* *fro*. (<span id="xv.i-p183.1"></span>[Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)<span id="xv.i-p183.1"></span>..md)
However that may be, Isaiah threatens the utter destruction of the Jews;
for so thoroughly were they hardened, that their rebellion could not be
subdued by a light and moderate chastisement from the hand of God. Yet
it might be taken in a good sense, that the Jews will at length raise
their eyes to heaven; but in that case we must read separately what
follows: —

<span id="xv.i-p184"></span><span id="xv.i-p184.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p185"></span>**22.** *And when they shall look to the
earth.* The meaning will then be, that the Jews will be converted to
God, because they will be deprived of every assistance on *the earth*,
and will see nothing but frightful calamities, to whatever side they
turn their eyes.

<span id="xv.i-p186"></span>*Behold, trouble and darkness.* These words
are partly figurative and partly literal; for by *dimness* and
*darkness* he means nothing else than adversity, according to the custom
of Scripture. But he adds, *driven to darkness*. This aggravates the
calamity to an amazing degree; for if one who is in *darkness* be
*driven* or *pushed* *forward*, he is far more in danger of stumbling
than before. Thus he intimates, that to a heavy calamity another still
heavier will be added, that they may be more completely ruined; for he
means nothing else than that the judgments of God will be so dreadful,
and the punishments so severe, that, whether they will or not, they
shall be constrained to look up to heaven.

<span id="xv.i-p54"></span> Our translators have not translated these

“To the next word <span id="xv.i-p54.1"></span>מהר, (*maher*,) the

<span id="xv.i-p58"></span> The Latin language afforded to our Author an
exceedingly successful imitation of the Hebrew phrase, “<span
id="xv.i-p58.1"></span>*Contestatus sum testes*.” It is readily
acknowledged that the turn of expression adopted by the translator is
much less felicitous; but it is hoped that it will aid the judgment,
though it may fail to gratify the taste, of the English reader. — *Ed*.
