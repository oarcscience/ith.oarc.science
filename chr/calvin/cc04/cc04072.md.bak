<span id="iii.iv.vi-p3"></span>**22.** Moreover, the LORD spake unto
Moses, saying,

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p4"></span>**22.** Loquutus est etiam Jehova ad
Mosen, dicendo:

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p5"></span>**23.** Take thou also unto thee
principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred *shekels,* and of sweet
cinnamon half so much, *even* two hundred and fifty *shekels,* and of
sweet calamus two hundred and fifty *shekels,*

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p6"></span>**23.** Tu sume tibi aromata optima:
myrrhae fluidae ad quingentos siclos, cinnamomi aromatici dimidium
ipsius, ducentos et quinquaginta: et calami atomatici ducentos et
quinquaginta:

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p7"></span>**24.** And of cassia five hundred
*shekels,* after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil-olive an hin:

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p8"></span>**24.** Casiae vero quingentos siclos,
pondere sanctuarii: et olei olivae hin:

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p9"></span>**25.** And thou shalt make it an oil of
holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it
shall be an holy anointing oil.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p10"></span>**25.** Et facies ex ea oleum unctionis
sanctitatis, unguentum unguenti, opus unguentarii; oleum unctionis
sanctitatis erit.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p11"></span>**26.** And thou shalt anoint the
tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p12"></span>**26.** Unges eo tabernaculum
conventionis, et arcam testimonii,

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p13"></span>**27.** And the table and all his
vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p14"></span>**27.** Et mensam onmiaque vasa ipsius,
et candelabrum omniaque vasa ipsius, et altare suffimenti:

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p15"></span>**28.** And the altar of burnt offering
with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p16"></span>**28.** Altare quoque holocausti et
omnia vasa ipsius, et concham et basin ejus.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p17"></span>**29.** And thou shalt sanctify them,
that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p18"></span>**29.** Ita sanctificabis ea, erunt
sanctitas sanctitatum: quicquid tetigerit ea, sanctificabitur.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p19"></span>**30.** And thou shalt anoint Aaron and
his sons, and consecrate them, that *they* may minister unto me in the
priest’s office.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p20"></span>**30.** Aharon praeterea et filios ejus
unges, et sanctificabis eos, ut sacerdotio fungantur mihi.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p21"></span>**31.** And thou shalt speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me
throughout your generations.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p22"></span>**31.** Ad filios autem Israel loqueris,
dicendo, Oleum unctionis sanctitatis erit hoc mihi per generationes
vestras.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p23"></span>**32.** Upon man’s flesh shall it not be
poured; neither shall ye make *any other* like it, after the composition
of it: it *is* holy, *and* it shall be holy unto you.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p24"></span>**32.** Super carnem hominis non ungent:
neque compositioni ejus facietis similes: sanctum est, sanctum erit
vobis.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p25"></span>**33.** Whosoever compoundeth *any* like
it, or whosoever putteth *any* of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut
off from his people.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p26"></span>**33.** Quisquis confecerit unguentum
simile, et qui posuerit ex eo super extraneum, succidetur e populis
suis.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p27"></span> 

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p28"></span><span id="iii.iv.vi-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p29"></span>**23.** *Take thou also unto thee
principal spices.* Although the oil here treated of was not only
destined for the anointing of the priests, but also of the tabernacle,
the ark of the covenant, the altars, and all the vessels, yet no fitter
place occurs for discussing the sacred unction, than by connecting it
with the priesthood, on which it depends. First of all its composition
is described, exquisite both in expensiveness and odor; that by its very
excellence and costliness the Israelites may learn that no ordinary
thing is represented by it; for we have already often seen that there
had been set before this rude people a splendor in sacred symbols, which
might affect their external senses, so as to uplift them as it were by
steps to the knowledge of spiritual things. We must now see why the
priest as well as all the vessels and the other parts of the tabernacle
had need of anointing. I conclude that without controversy this oil
mixed with precious perfumes was a type of the Holy Spirit; for the
metaphor of anointing is everywhere met with, when the prophets would
commend the power, the effects, and the gifts of the Spirit. Nor is
there any doubt but that God, by anointing kings, testified that He
would endow them with the spirit of prudence, fortitude, clemency, and
justice. Hence it is easily gathered that the tabernacle was sprinkled
with oil, that the Israelites might learn that all the exercises of
piety profited nothing without the secret operation of the Spirit. Nay,
something more was shewn forth, viz., that the efficacy and grace of the
Spirit existed and reigned in the truth of the shadows itself; and that
whatever good was derived from them was applied by the gift of the same
Spirit for the use of believers. In the altar, reconciliation was to be
sought, that God might be propitious to them; but, as the Apostle
testifies, the sacrifice of Christ’s death would not otherwise have been
efficacious to appease God, if He had not suffered by the Spirit, (<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p29.1"></span>[Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p29.1"></span>;) and how does its fruit now reach us,
except because the same Spirit washes our souls with the blood, which
once was shed, as Peter teaches us? (<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p29.2"></span>[1Pe
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p29.2"></span>.) Who now consecrates our prayers but the
Spirit, who dictates the groans which cannot be uttered; and by whom we
cry, Abba, Father? (<span id="iii.iv.vi-p29.3"></span>[Rom.
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p29.3"></span>.) Nay, whence comes the faith which admits
us to a participation in the benefits of Christ, but from the same
Spirit?

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p30"></span>But we were especially to consider the
anointing of the priest, who was sanctified by the Spirit of God for the
performance of his office; thus, as Isaiah, in the person of Jesus
Christ, declares that he was anointed with the spirit of prophecy,
(<span id="iii.iv.vi-p30.1"></span>[Isa
61:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p30.1"></span>;) and David affirms the same of the royal
spirit, (<span id="iii.iv.vi-p30.2"></span>[Ps
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p30.2"></span>;) so Daniel is our best interpreter and
witness how the sacerdotal unction was at length manifested (in Him
 <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180) .md), for when he says that the
time, when by the death of Christ the prophecy shall be sealed up, was
determined upon “to anoint the holy of holies,” he plainly reminds us
that the spiritual pattern, which answers to the visible sanctuary, is
in Christ; so that believers may really feel that these shadows were not
mere empty things. (<span id="iii.iv.vi-p31.1"></span>[Da
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p31.1"></span>.) We now perceive why Aaron was anointed,
viz., because Christ was consecrated by the Holy Spirit to be the
Mediator between God and man; and why the tabernacle and its vessels
were sprinkled with the same oil, viz., because we are only made
partakers of the holiness of Christ by the gift and operation of the
Spirit.  <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) Some translate it in
the masculine gender, where of the vessels it is said, “*whatsoever*
toucheth them shall be holy;” <span id="iii.iv.vi-p32.2"></span>[Ex
30:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#029.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p32.2"></span>: as if they were not to be touched by any
but the priests; but it appears to me to be rather spoken for another
reason, viz., that they may embue the oblations with their own sanctity.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p33"></span><span id="iii.iv.vi-p33.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p34"></span>**25.** *And thou shalt take it an oil
of holy ointment.* Although the genitive is put in the place of an
epithet, as if Moses had said “a holy oil;” yet it is so called from its
effect, because without it nothing is accounted pure. And assuredly the
Spirit of God sanctifies ourselves and all that is ours, because without
Him we are unholy, and all that belongs to us corrupt. He enjoins the
use of the ceremony throughout all the generations of the ancient
people, <span id="iii.iv.vi-p34.1"></span>[Ex
30:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#031.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p34.1"></span>. In these words there is an implied
contrast with the new Church, which wants no shadows since the
manifestation of the substance; and justly does the only begotten Son of
God possess the name of Christ, since by His coming He has abolished
these figures. And Simeon, when he took Him in his arms, and called Him
“the Lord’s Christ,”  <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) taught
that the external use of the legal oil had ceased. So much the sillier
is the superstition of the Papacy, when in imitation of the Jews it
anoints its priests, and altars, and other toys:  <span
id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) as if they desired to bury Christ
again with their ointments; wherefore let us hold this invention in
detestation as blasphemous, because it overthrows the limits prescribed
by God.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p38"></span>In order that the Jews may hold this
mystery in just reverence, he forbids similar ointment to be made. We
know that ointments were then among the luxuries of a fine banquet; but
it is accounted profanation if they make use of this kind; and we must
mark the reason, that what is holy, may be holy unto them, <span
id="iii.iv.vi-p38.1"></span>[Ex
30:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#032.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p38.1"></span>, *i.e.,* that they may reverently observe
what is peculiarly devoted to their salvation. For although the sacred
things divinely instituted always retain their nature, and cannot be
either corrupted or made void by our vices, yet may we by our
filthiness, by our impure use or neglect of them, pollute them as far as
in us lies.
