19:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#012)<span
id="iv.ii.i-p17.2"></span>.** *And ye shall not swear by my name
falsely.* Although Moses is treating of the duties of the Second Table,
and had previously forbidden men to deal fraudulently with their
neighbors, he still adds this sentence by way of confirmation. It may,
however, be inferred from the second clause of the verse that He
directly had regard to the glory of God when he says, “*Thou* shalt not
profane the name of thy God.” For raging greediness after gain causes
the avaricious and rapacious man not only to defraud men, but to become
insolent to God Himself. Moses, therefore, although he is professedly
condemning the falsehood and deceit whereby our neighbors are injured,
at the same time takes occasion to introduce the declaration that we
must beware lest, whilst covetousness impels us to do wrong, injury
should be done not only to men but to God Himself also. The word used
here, however, is not <span id="iv.ii.i-p17.3"></span>שוא, *shau,* as
before, but <span id="iv.ii.i-p17.4"></span>שקר, *sheker,* which
properly signifies deceitfulness; and therefore I have said that it
enjoins us to beware lest any one by his perjury should do any injury to
his neighbor; nevertheless, that this prohibition has direct reference
to the Third Commandment, since Moses especially insists on this point,
that God’s name is profaned by perjury, and thus he not only inculcates
integrity, but also has regard to religion, that God’s majesty may not
be violated. The expression is worthy of notice, “Thou shalt not
*pollute* the name of God,” because God, who is eternal and immutable
truth, cannot be more grossly insulted than by being summoned as a
witness to falsehood, which is assuredly a shameful and wicked
pollution. This was not regarded by the heathen, who, although they
pretended to reverence God’s name in their oaths, yet made no scruple of
deceiving, if he whom they had promised deserved it. Thyestes in the
poet says, “I never have pledged my faith, nor do I pledge it to any
faithless person;”  <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309) since his
brother was a villain, he considered that he lay under no valid
obligation to him. This is as if God’s majesty were dependent upon men’s
deservings, so that it was allowable to call Him to witness whilst we
deal deceitfully. Let this, then, be our firm conclusion, that in our
oaths God is first to be regarded, whose holy name is more precious than
a hundred worlds.
