<span id="iii.iii.xii-p3"></span>**23.** Thou shalt also make a table
*of* shittim wood: two cubits *shall be* the length thereof, and a cubit
the breadth thereof, and a cubit and half the height thereof.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p4"></span>**23.** Facies quoque mensam ex lignis
sittim: duorum cubitorum erit longitudo ejus, et cubiti latitudo ejus,
cubiti vero et dimidii alitudo ejus.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p5"></span>**24.** And thou shalt overlay it with
pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p6"></span>**24.** Et teges eam auro puro,
faciesque ei coronam auream in circuitu.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p7"></span>**25.** And thou shalt make unto it a
border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden
crown to the border thereof round about.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p8"></span>**25.** Facies quoque ei clausuram
latam quatuor digitos in circuitu: faciesque coronam auream clausurae
illi in circuitu.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p9"></span>**26.** And thou shalt make for it four
rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that *are* on the
four feet thereof.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p10"></span>**26.** Facies insuper ei quatuor
annulos aureos, quos pones in quatuor angulis qui sunt in quatuor
pedibus ejus.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p11"></span>**27.** Over against the border shall
the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p12"></span>**27.** E regione illius clausurae
erunt annuli per quos trajicientur vectes ad portandum mensam:

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p13"></span>**28.** And thou shalt make the staves
*of* shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be
borne with them.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p14"></span>**28.** Faciesque vectes illos e
lignis sittim: et operies eos auro, et feretur illis mensa.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p15"></span>**29.** And thou shalt make the dishes
thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to
cover withal: *of* pure gold shalt thou make them.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p16"></span>**29.** Facies etiam scutellas ejus,
et cochlearia ejus, et opercula ejus, et crateres ejus quibus libabitur:
ex auro mundo facies ca.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p17"></span>**30.** And thou shalt set upon the
table shewbread before me alway.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p18"></span>**30.** Et pones super mensam illam
panem facierum coram me jugiter.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p21"></span>**23.** *Thou shalt also make a
table.* The sentiment of a certain ancient bishop  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) is deservedly praised, who, when he
sold the sacred vessels in the time of a famine, to relieve the distress
of the poor, thus excused himself to the Church: “Our God, who does not
eat or drink, has no need of patens and chalices;” and yet this seems
little in accordance with this His command, that bread should be offered
to Him. I answer, that if, under that pretext, the bishop had stripped
the sacred table of its ornaments under the Law*,* he would have spoken
unseasonably, what, under the Gospel, he spoke piously and wisely;
because at the coming of Christ the shadows of the Law ceased. But God
would then have the loaves, which were offered to Him, deposited among
the golden dishes and censers, and spoons placed with them, not that He
had need of meat and drink, but that He might prescribe the duty of
temperance to His people, by deigning to have His table among them; for,
when they ate of the same wheat, of which the sacred loaves were made,
they were reminded by that symbol that their meat and drink was to be
taken, as if they sat before God, and were His guests. Finally, they
were taught that the food, by which man’s life is sustained, is in a
manner sacred to God; that thus they might be contented with simple and
sober food, and might not profane the things which were dedicated to His
service. Although, therefore, this offering might appear to be gross and
rude, yet it had a just object, *i.e.,* that believers might acknowledge
that God presided over their tables, because the loaves were presented
in the temple before God in the name of all the people. The same was the
intention of the first-fruits, in which the produce of the whole year
was consecrated; that even in their feasts they might cherish a
recollection of God, who fed them as a father does his children. They
are called “the bread of faces”  <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md)
by Moses, because they always appeared before God, in which sense the
Greeks called them the bread <span
id="iii.iii.xii-p23.1"></span>προθέσεως, because they were always in His
presence; for it was not permitted them to remove the precious offering,
until others were substituted in their place. I now pass over many
points, because what I now omit will soon have to be treated of.

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p22"></span> This was Acacius, bishop of Amida,
who sold the treasures of the Church for the redemption of 7000 Persian
slaves, who were perishing by famine in the hands of some Roman
soldiers. *Vide* Socrates, lib. 7-121, quoted in Bingham, book 5-100;
6-6 <span id="iii.iii.xii-p22.1"></span>̔Ο Θεός ἡμῶν ὔτε δίσκων ὄυτε
ποτηρίων χρὠβει· οὔτε γὰρ ἐσθίει, ὔτε πίνει, ἐπεὶ μὴ προσδεής ἐστιν,
seem to be the words referred to by *C*

<span id="iii.iii.xii-p23"></span> *A.V., shew-bread. “*In Hebrew called
bread of faces or presence; because they were to be set before the face,
or in the presence of God continually. The Hebrew doctors give also
another reason, because every cake was made square, and so had as it
were many faces.” — Ainsworth, *in loco.*
