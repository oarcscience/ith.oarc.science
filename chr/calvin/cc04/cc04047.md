<span id="iii.iii.iv-p3"></span>**22.** Neither shalt thou set thee up
*any* image; which the LORD thy God hateth.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p4"></span>**22.** Non eriges tibi statuam: quod
odio habet Jehova Deus tuus.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p6"></span><span id="iii.iii.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p7"></span>**22.** *Neither shalt thou set thee
up.* Hence also it more clearly appears what is the meaning and tendency
of the Second Commandment. God elsewhere commands,  <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99) (as we have seen,) that statues  <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100) should be erected on the borders of
the land, on which the sum of the Law should be inscribed. At first
sight this prohibition seems to be contradictory; and indeed it would be
so, unless you understand “statue” to be a false image of God, in which
men set Him before them in bodily form; and, therefore, it is added,
that He hates such statues. But I have preferred translating  <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101) the relative in the neuter gender,
that the sentence might be fuller; *i.e.,* that the erecting of statues
is an abomination to the Lord; because in this way His glory is
dishonored, when He is transfigured into a body, or when anything
corporeal is mixed with His spiritual nature.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[101](cc04047.htm#fr_100) <span
id="iii.iii.iv-p8.3"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p9"></span> *A.V,* image. *Margin,* statue, or
pillar.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[102](cc04047.htm#fr_101) <span
id="iii.iii.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p10"></span> *C* makes the relative refer, not to
the image set up, but to the act of setting it up. So also *V.* and
Dathe, though the relative is plural with them.
