<span id="iii.iii.xi-p37"></span>**5.** *Take ye from among you an
offering.* I have introduced a passage from chapter 35, wherein Moses
again requires what he had before prescribed; but he goes more into
detail, and treats at greater length of the parts of the tabernacle. In
the former passage he employed a verb, where he here uses a noun,
“willing or voluntary of heart.” There is, however, no ambiguity in the
meaning; since in both places God requires a cheerful zeal, so that they
may not only contribute abundantly, but willingly. He will afterwards
use a different form of expression, viz., that *they* did their duty,
whose heart roused, or stirred them up, so as to distinguish them from
the indifferent and slow. — 5:21.

<span id="iii.iii.xi-p38"></span><span id="iii.iii.xi-p38.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.xi-p39"></span>**10.** *And every wise-hearted among
you.* Thus he denominates the artificers, who excelled in shrewdness of
intellect, and so, after having commanded them severally of their
private means to supply the materials, he now exhorts others to
contribute their industry for shaping and joining them together. He then
briefly enumerates the parts of the Tabernacle, a longer explanation of
which will be seen in chapter 26. This is, therefore, a kind of epitome
of all those things, of which he before spoke more in full, since it was
necessary to spur them on afresh to the performance of what they had
been clearly instructed in. For we know that instruction is very often
coldly received without the addition of exhortations. It might indeed
seem strange,  <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) how so much
wealth could be possessed by a miserably pillaged people, and long
driven to servile work; unless it may be inferred from the abundance
which is here described, that they were incredibly enriched at their
departure from Egypt by the booty which God gave them. The kingdom of
Egypt was very wealthy; and its people, as we know, had always been
devoted to pleasures and luxuries. What, then, they had accumulated by
their rapacity in many years, flowed away from them by the secret
influence of God, when they were suddenly made prodigal. But, just as He
had blinded the Egyptians, that they should profusely give all they had,
so He now directed the minds and hearts of His people, that, mindful of
so great a benefit, they should willingly expend, at His command, what
they had obtained of His mere grace.

<span id="iii.iii.xi-p40"></span> "Particular stress is laid on the
contrast, which the condition of the Israelitish nation at that time
presents to the splendor and speedy completion of the tent. That tent
was certainly splendid, but, in point of fact, exceedingly simple in its
construction. If we compare it with the monuments of Egyptian
architecture, its relative simplicity must strike us in a much greater
degree. As to the materials that were required for it, it admits of
proof that the Israelites might well have been possessed of them at that
time. The wilderness even might supply them with many of these things.
With respect to other things, the metals, precious stones, etc, we must
keep in view the condition of a people that had just come out of Egypt.
History describes that country as having mercantile transactions with
Asia, even from the earliest times. The people had acquired property, in
part at least, in Egypt; the description in <span
id="iii.iii.xi-p40.2"></span>[Ex
32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#000.md)<span id="iii.iii.xi-p40.2"></span>,
leaves us no doubt as to the possessions, and even wealth, that they had
gained there. They had not gone out of Egypt empty-handed, but richly
provided with silver and gold, <span id="iii.iii.xi-p40.3"></span>[Ex
