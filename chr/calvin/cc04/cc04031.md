<span id="ii.x.vi-p7"></span>**18.** *Thou shalt not suffer a witch to
live.* In these passages the punishment of those is appointed who should
in any respect violate the worship of God. We have lately seen how
severely God avenged apostasy from the faith; but now He touches upon
certain particular points when religion is not professedly forsaken, but
some corruption is introduced, whereby its purity is affected. The first
passage denounces capital punishment upon witches; by which name Moses
means enchantresses, or sorceresses, who devote themselves to magic
arts, either to injure persons by their fascinations, or to seek
revelations from the devil; such as she was whom Saul consulted,
although she might be called by a different name  <span
id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) Since such illusions carry with them a
wicked renunciation of God, no wonder that He would have them punished
with death. But since this pestilent crime would be no more tolerable in
a man than a woman, it has been probably supposed that the law was
directed against women, because their sex is more disposed to
superstition. Certainly the same enactment is made respecting males in
<span id="ii.x.vi-p8.6"></span>[De
18:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001.md)<span id="ii.x.vi-p8.6"></span>,
 <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) only the punishment is not there
denounced, but God merely prohibits any of the people from being an
enchanter or a witch. Now it is clear that all the kinds which are there
recited, are here included under one; so that God would condemn to
capital punishment all augurs, and magicians, and consulters with
familiar spirits, and necromancers and followers of magic arts, as well
as enchanters. And this will appear more plainly from the second and
third passages, in which God declares that He “will set. His face
against all, that shall turn after such as have familiar spirits, and
after wizards,” so as to cut them off from His people; and then commands
that they should be destroyed by stoning. Wherefore, since it is not
just that men should escape with impunity, when the infirmity of women
is not spared, nor that dissimilar sentences should be pronounced in
similar cases, the same punishment which was decreed against witches and
enchantresses, is now extended to either sex, and to all magical
superstitions. In the words also “that turneth to go a whoring,” the
atrocity of the crime is again expressed, the similitude being taken
from immodest women, who seek with wandering glances for the indulgence
of their lust. Moses, therefore, signifies that, as soon as we begin to
cast our eyes this way and that, and do not keep them fixed on God alone
so as to be content with Him, that sacred union  <span
id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md) is violated wherein He has bound us to
Himself.
