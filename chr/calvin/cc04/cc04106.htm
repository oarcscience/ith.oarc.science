<p><a name="iii.ix.iii-p37"></A><b>16.</b> <i>And in the fourteenth day.</i> It is true that the instruction here given has some connection with the feast of the passover, but since the sacrifices are avowedly treated of, and no mention is made of its other observances, except in this place, I have connected it with the 				continual sacrifice, as its concomitant or part. Moses cursorily refers, indeed, to what we have already seen, <i>i.e., </i>that the people should abstain from leaven for seven days, and eat unleavened bread; but he afterwards descends to the main point of which he here proposed to treat, viz., that the people should slay two bullocks as a burnt-offering, a ram, and seven lambs, together with a goat for a sin-offering; and that this sacrifice should be 				repeated through the whole week. In order, then, that the reverence paid to the passover should be increased, this extraordinary sacrifice was added to the continual one, partly that they might thus be more and more stimulated to devote themselves to God; partly that they might acknowledge how familiarly He had embraced them with His favor, inasmuch as He took these offerings from their flocks and herds, and required the sacred feast to be prepared for Him out of their cellars and granaries 				also; partly, too, that professing themselves to be worthy of eternal death, they should fly to Him to ask for pardon, and at the same time should understand that there was but one way of reconciliation, <i>i.e., </i>when God should be propitiated by sacrifice.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.ix.iii-p38"></A><a name="iii.ix.iii-p38.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.ix.iii-p39"></A><b>26.</b> <i>Also in the day of thefirst-fruits.</i> Moses delivers the same commandment as to another festival, viz., that on which they offered their first-fruits. Then, also, he instructs them, the continual sacrifice was to be increased by the addition of two bullocks, one ram, seven 				lambs, a goat for a sin-offering, together with the <i>minha </i>and a libation, with the object, of which I have already spoken. A perplexing difficulty here arises, because in <a name="iii.ix.iii-p39.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#000">Leviticus 23</a><a name="iii.ix.iii-p39.1"></A>, one bullock is mentioned instead of two, and, on the contrary, two rams instead of one.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">238</FONT></A>
 				 Some think that an option was left to the priests in this matter; but when I consider how precisely God&#8217;s commands were given in everything, I question whether such an alternative was left to their discretion. The notion that God had once been content with a single bullock, as some think, because they were not abundant in the desert, appears to me a subterfuge. I confess I do not know how to get out of this difficulty, unless perhaps we say, that inasmuch as 				sufficiently exact provision had been made, in all other particulars, that nothing should be done without reason, in this respect only they were reminded that God in Himself cares not for greater or less victims. Nor does any reverence prevent us from saying that, as it sometimes happens in minor matters, a wrong number may have crept in from the carelessness of scribes;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">239</FONT></A>
 				 and this is probably the most natural solution. The more correct reading, in my opinion, is, that they should offer two bullocks and one ram; but since it is elsewhere explained why God appointed this day, he only briefly recites here: &#8220;When they bring the <i>fainha </i>with the first-fruits."</p>
