<span id="v.iii.iii-p3"></span>**12.** And the LORD spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="v.iii.iii-p4"></span>**12.** Dixit praeterea Jehova ad Mosen,
dicendo:

<span id="v.iii.iii-p5"></span>**13.** Speak thou also unto the children
of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it *is a* sign
between me and you throughout your generations; that *ye* may know that
I *am* the LORD that doth sanctify you.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p6"></span>**13.** Et tu alloquere filios Israel,
dicendo: Veruntamen Sabbatha mea custodietis: qnia signum eat inter me
et vos in generationibus vestris, ut sciatis quod sum Jehova
sanctiffcans vos.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p7"></span>**14.** Ye shall keep the sabbath
therefore; for it *is* holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall
surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth *any* work therein, that
soul shall be cut off from among his people.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p8"></span>**14.** Custodietis igitur Sabbathum,
quia sanctitus est vobis: quisquis profanaverit illud moriendo morietur:
quia omnis faciens in eo opus, excidetur anima ipsa e medio populorum
suorum.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p9"></span>**15.** Six days may work be done; but in
the seventh *is* the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth
*any* work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p10"></span>**15.** Sex diebus fiet opus: at die
septimo Sabbathum cessationis est, sanctitas Jehovae: quicunque fecerit
opus die Sabbathi, moriendo morietur.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p11"></span>**16.** Wherefore the children of Israel
shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their
generations, *for* a perpetual covenant.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p12"></span>**16.** Observabunt itaque filii Israel
Sabbathum, observando ipsum in generationibus suis, pactum est
perpetuum.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p13"></span>**17.** It *is* a sign between me and
the children of Israel for ever: for *in* six days the LORD made heaven
and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p14"></span>**17.** Inter me et filios Israel signum
est in perpetuum: quia sex diebus fecit Jehova coelos et terrain, die
autem septimo cessavit et requievit.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p15"></span> 

<span id="v.iii.iii-p16"></span><span id="v.iii.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii.iii-p17"></span>**13.** *Speak thou also unto the
children of Israel.* He inculcates the same things as before, with the
addition of a few words, such as “for it is holiness unto you;”  <span
id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) by which expression he exhorts them to
observe this rite as most sacred and inviolable, since by its neglect
religion would fall  <span id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) And
therefore he denounces capital punishment against any who should work on
that day. Hence, again, we gather the dignity and excellency of the
mystery, when God deemed an apparently light transgression of it worthy
of death. Still this was an act of by no means excusable contempt, to
overthrow professedly, as it were, what God would have to be a mark of
distinction between His people and heathen nations. The passages which
follow have the same tendency, which it would have been superfluous to
repeat, unless because the people were thus reminded that it was a
matter of the utmost importance. By prohibiting them from lighting a
fire, He anticipates all the glosses which they would have been ready
enough to invent; for they would have alleged that if the pot had been
put on the fire the day before, the Sabbath would not have been violated
by lighting the fire. What, then, would have been more allowable than
anything else God excludes, viz., that they should not employ themselves
in the preparation of their food, or undertake any other earthly work,
however venial. When He calls it a “perpetual” or eternal “covenant,”
the Jews rest on it as a ground of their obstinacy, and wantonly rave
against Christ as a covenant-breaker, because He abrogated the Sabbath.
I will not contend with them as to the word <span
id="v.iii.iii-p19.2"></span>גולם, *gnolam,* which sometimes means a long
time, and not perpetuity: I will simply insist on the thing itself.
Whatever was spoken of under the Law as eternal, I maintain to have had
reference to the new state of things which came to pass at the coming of
Christ; and thus the eternity of the Law must not be extended beyond the
fullness of time, when the truth of its shadows was manifested, and
God’s covenant assumed a different form. If the Jews cry out that what
is perpetual, and what is temporary, are contraries to each other, we
must deny it in various respects, since assuredly what was peculiar to
the Law could not continue to exist beyond the day of Jesus Christ.
Besides, the Sabbath, although its external observation is not now in
use, still remains eternal in its reality, like circumcision. Thus the
stability of both was best confirmed by their abrogation; since, if God
now required the same of Christians, it would be putting a veil over the
death and resurrection of His Son; and hence the more carefully the Jews
persevere in the keeping the festival, the more do they derogate from
its sanctity. But they calumniate us falsely, as if we disregarded the
Sabbath; because there is nothing which more completely confirms its
reality and substance than the abolition of its external use. To this
point also may my readers apply what I have written on <span
id="v.iii.iii-p19.3"></span>[Genesis
17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#000.md)<span id="v.iii.iii-p19.3"></span>,
 <span id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) lest I should weary them in
vain by my prolixity; and again, in treating of the sacrifices, I have
adverted to some things which relate to the same doctrine. When, in
<span id="v.iii.iii-p20.2"></span>[Exodus
34](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#000.md)<span id="v.iii.iii-p20.2"></span>,
God especially commands them to rest “in earing-time and harvest,”
 <span id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) it is not as if He would let
loose the rein for the rest of the year; but He rather draws it tighter,
since no necessity must interrupt this sacred observance. Else it might
have seemed a just pretext, if, on account of continued rains, or other
ungenial weather, ploughing should be difficult, husbandmen were to be
released from the obligation of the law, lest their resting should have
produced sterility. The same opinion might have prevailed as to the
ingathering of the harvest, lest it should have been spoilt on the
ground. God, however, allows of no dispensation; but the Sabbath is to
be observed, though at the risk of general loss.

<span id="v.iii.iii-p21"></span> We must beware of being misled by what
is a very common misapprehension, not without the authority of some of
our English Dictionary-writers, as if *“*earing-time” were the time of
gathering the *ears* of corn, instead of a derivative from the Saxon
“erian,” cognate with and equivalent to the Latin “<span
id="v.iii.iii-p21.1"></span>arare,” to plough. See *C.’s* Latin, “<span
id="v.iii.iii-p21.2"></span>*in* *aratione."*
