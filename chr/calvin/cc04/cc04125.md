id="iii.x.xvii-p26.2"></span>.** *When a bullock or a sheep.* God
forbids the young to be taken from the womb to the altar, not only
because this bad example was likely to be transferred from the
sacrifices to the ordinary food, but also because the offering would
have been a fraudulent one. We have seen that the sacrifices were called
the bread of God, in order that men should be more liberal with respect
to them, and not offer meagre victims; but to kill a young animal fresh
from the womb would have been a sign of contempt; although regard was
also had to humanity, lest, by eating of such sacrifices, they should
grow accustomed to cruelty. The eighth day is appointed, on which the
lawfulness of the offering should commence. I am afraid that the reason
which some assign for this is too subtle, viz., that an animal is made
perfect in seven days, because God completed the work of creation in
seven days. Besides, on this ground the seventh day would be the fittest
for sacrifice, because in six days God completed all His work, and the
seventh was hallowed for His service It is enough for me that regard was
had to maturity of age, just as in the case of circumcision.  <span

<span id="iii.x.xvii-p28"></span><span id="iii.x.xvii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xvii-p29"></span>**28.** *And whether it be a cow or
ewe.* Though cruelty was indeed condemned in this precept, still I make
no doubt but that Moses speaks primarily of the sacrifices. I confess
the word <span id="iii.x.xvii-p29.1"></span>שחט, *shachat,* which he
uses, is a general one; but since throughout the chapter he is
professedly treating of the sacrifices, and in connection with these
words adds the conclusion respecting the hallowing of His holy name,
<span id="iii.x.xvii-p29.2"></span>[Le
22:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#032)<span
id="iii.x.xvii-p29.2"></span>, the context requires that we should
consider it to be an inculcation of purity in God’s service. If any
prefer to extend it further, I will not contest the point; and thus this
sentence will be a supplement to the Sixth Commandment. I have, however,
followed what appears most probable, and the reader of sound judgment
will, I hope, agree with me. Meanwhile, I confess that all barbarity and
cruelty was thus prohibited in the sacrifices, and in them the rule was
laid down, that men should not be cruel in reference to their daily
food. It is a sight by no means pleasant to gentle minds to see the dam
killed together with her young; and, if it were a common custom, men
would easily grow callous as to blood-shedding in general. God would
therefore not have the exercises of religion disconnected from the
duties of humanity; and the tendency of the precept is, that God’s altar
should not be a Cyclopean slaughter-house.
