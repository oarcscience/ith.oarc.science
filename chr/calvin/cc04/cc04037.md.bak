<span id="ii.x.xii-p3"></span>**1.** And the LORD spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="ii.x.xii-p4"></span>**1.** Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen,
dicendo:

<span id="ii.x.xii-p5"></span>**2.** Make thee two trumpets of silver;
of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the
calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p6"></span>**2.** Fac tibi duas tubas argenteas:
opere ductili facies illas: quae sint tibi ad convocationem coetus, et
ad castra movenda.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p7"></span>**3.** And when they shall blow with them,
all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p8"></span>**3.** Quum clangent illis, congregabuntur
ad te omnes coetus ad ostium tabernaculi testimonii.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p9"></span>**4.** And if they blow *but* with one
*trumpet,* then the princes, *which are* heads of the thousands of
Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p10"></span>**4.** Si vero una clanxerint,
congregabuntur ad te principes, capita millium Israelis.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p11"></span>**5.** When ye blow an alarm, then the
camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p12"></span>**5.** Si vero clanxeritis cum
jubilatione, proficiscentur castra eorum qui castrametantur ad Orientem.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p13"></span>**6.** When ye blow an alarm the second
time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their
journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p14"></span>**6.** Quum autem clanxeritis cum
jubilatione secundo, tum proficiscentur castra eorum qui castrametantur
ad meridiem; cum jubilatione clangent in profectionibus suis.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p15"></span>**7.** But when the congregation is to be
gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p16"></span>**7.** Quando vero congregabitis coetum,
clangetis, sed absque jubila.tione.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p17"></span>**8.** And the sons of Aaron, the
priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an
ordinance for ever throughout your generations.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p18"></span>**8.** Filii autem Aharon sacerdotes
clangent tubis illis, eruntque vobis in statutum perpetuum per aetates
vestras.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p19"></span>**9.** And if you go to war in your land
against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with
the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and
ye shall be saved from your enemies.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p20"></span>**9.** Et quando venietis ad praelium in
terra vestra contra hostem vestrum qui vos affliget, cum jubilatione
clangetis tubis illis: et recordatio vestri erit coram Jehova Deo
vestro, ut servemini ab hostibus vestris.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p21"></span>**10.** Also in the day of your gladness,
and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall
blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the
sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a
memorial before your God: I *am* the LORD your God.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p22"></span>**10.** Die quoque laetitiae vestrae, et
in solennitatibus vestris, et in principiis mensium vestrorum clangetis
tubis illis super holocausta, et super sacrificia prosperitatum
vestrarum, ut sint vobis in recordationem coram Deo vestro: ego Jehova
Deus vester.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p24"></span><span id="ii.x.xii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.x.xii-p25"></span>**2** *Make thee two trumpets of silver.*
This passage respecting the silver trumpets, which gave the
gathering-signal, so that the people should always be attentive to the
voice and will of God, is properly annexed to the First Commandment. For
God would have the Israelites set in motion by their sound,
whithersoever they were to go, so that they should not dare to commence
anything either in war or in peace, except under His guidance and
auspices, as it were. But their use was threefold, viz., to gather the
people or the rulers to public assemblies; to arm them against their
enemies; and, thirdly, to announce the sacrifices and festivals. It
might seem absurd, and somewhat indecorous, to appoint the priests to be
trumpeters, since there was no splendor or dignity in this office; but
God would in this way awaken greater reverence in the minds of the
people, that the authority of the priests should precede all their
actions. For this office, to which they were appointed, was no servile
one, as that they should blow the trumpets at the command of others; but
rather did God thus set them over public affairs, that the people might
not tumultuously call their assemblies in the blindness and
precipitation of passion, but rather that modesty, gravity, and
moderation should be observed in them. We know how often in earthly
affairs God is not regarded, but counsels are confidently discussed
without reference to His word. He testified, therefore, by this
employment of the priests, that all assemblies, except those in which He
should preside, were accursed. Profane nations also had their
ceremonies, such as auguries, supplications, soothsayings, victims,
 <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) because natural reason dictated
that nothing could be engaged in successfully without Divine assistance;
but God would have His people bound to Him in another way, so that, when
called by the sound of the sacred trumpets as by a voice from heaven,
they should assemble to holy and pious deliberations. The circumstance
of the place also has the same object. The door of the Tabernacle was to
them, as if they placed themselves in the sight; of God. We will speak
of the word<span id="ii.x.xii-p26.2"></span>מועד *, mogned*  <span
id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) elsewhere. Although it signifies an
appointed time, or place, and also an assembly of the people, I prefer
translating it *convention,* because God there in a solemn manner, as if
before His sacred tribunal, called the people to witness, or, according
to appointment, proceeded to make a covenant with them.

<span id="ii.x.xii-p28"></span>He was also unwilling that wars should be
undertaken precipitately, or with the desire of vengeance, but that the
priests should perform the office of heralds, (*feciales,*) in order
that he might be the originator of them himself. But it was honorable
for the priests to be the proclaimers of the festivals, and to cite the
people to the sanctuary. Now, since we understand the intention of the
Legislator, let us briefly touch upon the words. We have said that the
priests, when they sounded, were, as it were, the organs or interpreters
of God, that the Israelites might depend upon His voice and commandment.
If the princes or heads of thousands only were to be called, they
sounded only once; if it was a convocation of the whole people, they
doubled the sound. A similar distinction was observed in war, that a
different signal should be given, according as the camps of either side
were to advance. Some use the fictitious word *taratantara,*  <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) in place of what I have translated “with
jubilation:” it is probable that it was a louder and more protracted
sound, but blown with intervals. We must, however, observe the promise,
which is inserted, that the Israelites “should be remembered before the
Lord,” that He should put their enemies to flight; not as if the safety
or deliverance of the people was attached to the trumpets, but because
they did not go to the battle except in reliance on God’s aid. For the
reality itself is conjoined with the external symbol, viz., that they
should fight under God, should follow Him as their Leader, and should
account all their strength to be in His grace. And that all the saints
were guided by this rule appears from <span
id="ii.x.xii-p29.3"></span>[Ps
20:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa020.htm#007.md)<span id="ii.x.xii-p29.3"></span>,
—

<span id="ii.x.xii-p30"></span>"Some trust in chariots, and some in
horses; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God:"

<span id="ii.x.xii-p31"></span>and again, “There is no king saved by the
multitude of an host; a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that
hope in his mercy.” (<span id="ii.x.xii-p31.1"></span>[Ps
33:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.x.xii-p31.1"></span>)

<span id="ii.x.xii-p32"></span><span id="ii.x.xii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="ii.x.xii-p33"></span>**10.** *Also in the day of your
gladness.* This was as if God should make it manifest that He approved
of no festivals, and that no sacrifices pleased Him, except His command
should go before them; for it was not lawful for the people to choose
this or that day, but the authority for prescribing them was in the
hands of the ministers of sacred things. And, indeed, God Himself had
appointed the New-moons (*Neomenias, vel novilunia*) and the other
solemnities; but, lest any change should occur, since men are ever
daring in their innovations, He would have their lawful observation
sanctioned by the sound of the trumpets; as if, by the mouth of the
priests, He Himself published the holy assemblies. The sacrifices, which
others have translated “of your peace-offerings,”  <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) I translate, and not without reason, “of
your prosperities.” For this is what <span
id="ii.x.xii-p34.4"></span>שלמיכם, *shalmecem,* properly means; and it
was the name they gave to their supplications and testimonies of
thanksgiving, when they had been delivered from some great danger, or
were visited by some extraordinary blessing from God. But Moses says
that the trumpets were to be “for a memorial before their God;” because
when they should have assembled at His command, He would look upon them,
and honor them with His paternal favor.
