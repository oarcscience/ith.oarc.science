saying,

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p4"></span>**1.** Loquutus est deinde Jehova ad
Mosen, dicendo:

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p5"></span>**2.** Take Aaron and his sons with him,
and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin
offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p6"></span>**2.** Tolle Aharon et filios ejus cure
illo, et vestes, et oleum unctionis, et juvencum sacrificii pro peccato:
et duos arietes, et canistrum azymorum.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p7"></span>**3.** And gather thou all the
congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p8"></span>**3.** Atque omnem coetum congrega ad
ostium tabernaculi conventionis.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p11"></span>**1.** *And the Lord spake.* It is well
known that in conjunction with the sacrifices there was an offering,
which they call *minha,* but we shall elsewhere see that this was also
used separately; for it was lawful without a victim to offer either
plain meal, or cakes, or wafers seasoned with oil. Therefore, besides
the sacrifice of consecration, of which Moses has already treated, this
second offering is required from the priest, that he should present at
his inauguration a cake fried in a pan, and cut in pieces. The reason of
this appears to have been, that he might thence become the legitimate
minister of all the people, and might duly offer in the name of others,
when he had done what was right for himself. But a distinction is drawn
between the demand upon the priest and that, upon the people, viz., that
it should be “wholly burnt;” the reason for which, since it will be
explained elsewhere, it will be now sufficient to advert to in a single
word. The fact was that God was unwilling that the priests should
indulge themselves in vain ostentation, which might have been easily the
case, if the oblation had been preserved for their use, like the *minha*
of the people which remained in their hands.
