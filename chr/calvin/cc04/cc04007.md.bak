<span id="ii.ii.i-p3"></span>**1.** And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="ii.ii.i-p4"></span>**1.** Et loquuntus est Jehova ad Mosen,
dicendo:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p5"></span>**2.** This shall be the law of the leper
in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p6"></span>**2.** Hace erit lex leprosi die pugationis
suae, *nempe* adducetur ad sacerdtem.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p7"></span>**3.** And the priest shall go forth out of
the camp: and the priest shall look, and, behold, *if* the plague of
leprosy be healed in the leper;

<span id="ii.ii.i-p8"></span>**3.** Et egredietur sacerdos foras extra
castra, dg inspiciet sacerdos: et su sanata fuerit lepra a leproso;

<span id="ii.ii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Then shall the priest command to
take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive *and* clean, and
cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p10"></span>**4.** Tunc praecipiet scerdos ut
tollantur ei qui mundatur dae aves vivae, mundae, et lignum cedrinum, et
coccus vermiculi, et hyssopus.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p11"></span>**5.** And the priest shall command that
one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p12"></span>**5.** Et praecipiet sacerdos ut mactetur
avis una super vas fictile super aquas vivas.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p13"></span>**6.** As for the living bird, he shall
take it, and the cedar-wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall
dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird *that was* killed
over the running water:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p14"></span>**6.** Avem vivam tollet, et lignum
cedrinum, et cuccum vermiculi, et hyssopum: et tinget illa, et avem
vivam in sanguine avis mactatae super aquas vivas.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p15"></span>**7.** And he shall sprinkle upon him that
is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him
clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p16"></span>**7.** Et sparget super eum qui mundatur a
lepra septem vicibus, mundabitque emu: et emitet avem vivam in
superficiem agri.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p17"></span>**8.** And he that is to be cleansed shall
wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water,
that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and
shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p18"></span>**8.** Et lavabit qui emundatur vestimenta
sua, et radet omnem ilum suum, lavabitque se aqua, et mundus erit:
postea ingredietur castra, habitabitque extra tabernaculum suum septem
diebus.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p19"></span>**9.** But it shall be on the seventh day,
that he shall shave all his hair off his head, and his beard and his
eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his
cloathes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p20"></span>**9.** Die autem septimo radet omnem pilum
suum, caput suum, et barbam suam, et supercilia oculorum suorum, atque
omnem reliquum pilum summ radet: lavbit quoque vestimenta sua, postquam
laverit carnem suam aqua, et purificabit se.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p21"></span>**10.** And on the eighth day he shall
take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb of the first year
without blemish, and three tenth-deals of fine flour *for* a meat
offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p22"></span>**10.** Die autem octavo tallet duos agnos
immaculatos, et agnam unam anniculam immaculatam, et tres decimas
mixturae minha mixta oleao, et sextarium unum olei.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p23"></span>**11.** And the priest that maketh *him*
clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things,
before the Lord, *at* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p24"></span>**11.** Statuetque sacerdos qui mundat
virum mundandum, et illa coram Jehova ad ostium tabernaculi
conventionis.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p25"></span>**12.** And the priest shall take one
he-lamb, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and
wave them *for* a wave offering before the Lord:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p26"></span>**12.** Tolletque sacerdos agnum unum quem
offert in sacrificium pro delicto, et sextarium olei, et agitabit ea
agitatione coram Jehova.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p27"></span>**13.** And he shall slay the lamb in the
place where he shall kill the sin-offering and the burnt offering, in
the holy place: for as the sin-offering *is* the priest’s, *so is* the
trespass offering: it *is* most holy:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p28"></span>**13.** Mactabitque agmnu in loco in quo
mactare solet oblationem pro peccato, et holocaustum *nempe* in loco
sanctitatis: quia sicut hostia pro peccato, *ita* oblatio pro delicto,
est sacerdotis, sanctitas sanctitatum est.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p29"></span>**14.** And the priest shall take *some*
of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put *it*
upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon
the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p30"></span>**14.** Accipietque sacerdos de sanguine
oblationis pro delicto, et ponet super tenerum auris mundandi dextrae,
et super pollicem manus ejus dextrae, et super pollicem pedis ejus
dextri.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p31"></span>**15.** And the priest shall take *some*
of the log of oil, and pour *it* into the palm of his own left hand:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p32"></span>**15.** Accipiet praeterea sacerdos de
sextario olei, et fundet in manum suam sinistram.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p33"></span>**16.** And the priest shall dip his right
finger in the oil that *is* in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the
oil with his finger seven times before the Lord:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p34"></span>**16.** Tingetque ipse digitum suum
dextrum in oleum quod est in manu sua sinistra, spargetque de oleo
digito suo septem vicibus coram Jehova.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p35"></span>**17.** And of the rest of the oil that
*is* in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of
him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and
upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass
offering:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p36"></span>**17.** De residuo vero olei quod in manu
sua ponet sacerdos super tenerum auris mundandi dextrae, et super
pollicem manus ejus dextrae, et super pollicem pedis ejus dextri, ultra
sanguinem oblationis pro delicto.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p37"></span>**18.** And the remnant of the oil that
*is* in the priest’s hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to
be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the
Lord.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p38"></span>**18.** Quod autem superest de oleo quod
est in manu ejus, ponet super caput mundandi: expiabitque eum sacerdos
coram Jehova.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p39"></span>**19.** And the priest shall offer the sin
offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his
uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p40"></span>**19.** Faciet item sacerdos oblationem
pro peccato, emundabitque mundandum ab immunditia sua, et postea
mactabit holocaustum.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p41"></span>**20.** And the priest shall offer the
burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest
shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p42"></span>**20.** Et ascendere faciet sacerdos
holocaustum et minham super altare expiabitque eum sacerdos, et mundus
erit.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p43"></span>**21.** And if he *be* poor, and cannot
get so much; then he shall take one lamb *for* a trespass offering to be
waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth-deal of fine flour
mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;

<span id="ii.ii.i-p44"></span>**21.** Si autem pauper fuerit, et manus
ejus non possit assequi, tum accipiet agnum unum in hostiam pro delicto
in elevationem ad expiandum illum, et decimam partem similae unam
permistam oleo pro minha, sextariumque olei.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p45"></span>**22.** And two turtledoves, or two young
pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering,
and the other a burnt offering.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p46"></span>**22.** Duos praeterea turtures, aut duos
filios columbae, quodcunque apprehendere poterit manus ejus: eritque
unus in hostiam pro pecccato, et alter pro holocausto.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p47"></span>**23.** And he shall bring them on the
eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation, before the Lord.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p48"></span>**23.** Afferetque ea octavo die
purificationis suae ad sacerdotem, ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis
coram Jehova.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p49"></span>**24.** And the priest shall take the lamb
of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave
them *for* a wave offering before the Lord:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p50"></span>**24.** Suscipietque sacerdos agnum
oblationis pro delicto, et sextarium olei, atque agitabit ea sacerdos
elevationem coram Jehova.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p51"></span>**25.** And he shall kill the lamb of the
trespass offering, and the priest shall take *some* of the blood of the
trespass offering, and put *it* upon the tip of the right ear of him
that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon
the great toe of his right foot:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p52"></span>**25.** Mactabitque agnum oblationis pro
delicto, ac tollet sacerdos de sanguine oblationis pro delicto, ponetque
super tenerum auris mundandi dextrin, et super pollicem manus ejus
dextrae, et super pollicem pedis ejus dextri.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p53"></span>**26.** And the priest shall pour of the
oil into the palm of his own left hand:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p54"></span>**26.** De oleo quoque fundet sacerdos in
manum suam sinistram.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p55"></span>**27.** And the priest shall sprinkle with
his right finger *some* of the oil that *is* in his left hand seven
times before the Lord:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p56"></span>**27.** Spargetque sacerdos digito suo
dextro de oleo quod est in manu sua sinistra septem vicibus coram
Jehova.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p57"></span>**28.** And the priest shall put of the
oil that *is* in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is
to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great
toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass
offering:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p58"></span>**28.** Ponet quoque sacerdos de oleo quod
est in manu sua super tenerum auris emundandi dextrae, et super pollicem
manus ejus dextrae, et super pollicem pedis ejus dextri, in loco
sanguinis oblationis pro delicto.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p59"></span>**29.** And the rest of the oil that *is*
in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be
cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the Lord.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p60"></span>**29.** Quod autem superest de oleo quod
est in manu sacerdotis, ponet super caput emundandi ad emun-dandum illum
coram Jehova.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p61"></span>**30.** And he shall offer the one of the
turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get;

<span id="ii.ii.i-p62"></span>**30.** Faciet item unum de turturibus,
vel ex pullis columbarum, ex iis quae apprehenderit manus ejus.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p63"></span>**31.** *Even* such as he is able to get,
the one *for* a sin offering, and the other. *for* a burnt offering,
with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him
that is to be cleansed before the Lord.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p64"></span>**31.** Quod *inquam* apprehenderit manus
ejus, faciet unum pro peccato, et alterum in holocaustum cum minha,
emundabitque sacerdos mundaudum coram Jehova.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p65"></span>**32.** This *is* the law *of him* in whom
*is* the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get *that which
pertaineth* to his cleansing.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p66"></span>**32.** Ita est lex ejus in quo fuerat
plaga leprae, cujus manus non poterat apprehendere mundationem sui.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p67"></span>**33.** And the Lord spake unto Moses and
unto Aaron, saying,

<span id="ii.ii.i-p68"></span>**33.** Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen et
Aharon, dicendo:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p69"></span>**34.** When ye be come into the land of
Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of
leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;

<span id="ii.ii.i-p70"></span>**34.** Quum ingressi fueritis terram
Chanaan, quam ego do vobis in possessionem, et posuero plagam leprae in
domo terrae possessionis vestrae:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p71"></span>**35.** And he that owneth the house shall
come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me *there is* as it were
a plague in the house:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p72"></span>**35.** Veniet ille cujus erit domus,
renuuntiabitque sacerdoti, dicendo,. Tanquam plaga *leprae* visa est
mihi in domo.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p73"></span>**36.** Then the priest shall command that
they empty the house, before the priest go *into it* to see the plague,
that all that *is* in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the
priest shall go in to see the house:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p74"></span>**36.** Tunc praecipiet sacerdos, et
expurgabunt domum antequam ingrediatur sacerdos, ut dispiciat plagam, ne
polluatur quicquam quod sit in ea domo: et postea ingredietur sacerdos
ad contemplandam domum

<span id="ii.ii.i-p75"></span>**37.** And he shall look on the plague,
and, behold, *if* the plague *be* in the walls of the house with hollow
strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight *are* lower than the wall;

<span id="ii.ii.i-p76"></span>**37.** Tunc considerabit plagam ipsam: et
siquidem in plaga quae est in parietibus domus, fuerint nigredines,
flavedines, vel rubedines: et aspectus eorum fuerit depressior reliquo
pariete:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p77"></span>**38.** Then the priest shall go out of
the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p78"></span>**38.** Egredietur sacerdos e domo ad
ostium domus, et claudet domum septem diebus.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p79"></span>**39.** And the priest shall come again
the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, *if* the plague be spread
in the walls of the house;

<span id="ii.ii.i-p80"></span>**39.** Postea revertetur sacerdos die
septimo, et contemplabitur: et siquidem creverit plaga in parietibus
domus,

<span id="ii.ii.i-p81"></span>**40.** Then the priest shall command that
they take away the stones in which the plague *is,* and they shall cast
them into an unclean place without the city:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p82"></span>**40.** Tunc praecipiet sacerdos, et
eruent lapides in quibus fuerit plaga illa, projicientque illos extra
civitatem in locum immundum:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p83"></span>**41.** And he shall cause the house to be
scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they
scrape off without the city into an unclean place:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p84"></span>**41.** Domum autem radere jubebit
intrinsecus per circuitum, et effundent pulveremquem abraserint extra
civitatem in locum immundum.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p85"></span>**42.** And they shall take other stones,
and put *them* in the place of those stones; and he shall take other
morter, and shall plaister the house.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p86"></span>**42.** Et accipient lapides altos quos
reponent loco lapidum illorum, et latum aliud capient, et complanabunt
domum.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p87"></span>**43.** And if the plague come again, and
break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and
after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;

<span id="ii.ii.i-p88"></span>**43.** Quod si reversa fuerit plaga, et
effloreat in illa domo postquam erui fecit lapides, et abradi domum, et
posteaquam obducta fuit:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p89"></span>**44.** Then the priest shall come and
look, and, behold, *if* the plague be spread in the house, it *is* a
fretting leprosy in the house: it *is* unclean.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p90"></span>**44.** Tunc ingredietur sacerdos, et
considerabit: et siquidem creverit plaga in domo, lepra corrodens est
ipsa in domo, immunda est.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p91"></span>**45.** And he shall break down the house,
the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the
house; and he shall carry *them* forth out of the city into an unclean
place.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p92"></span>**45.** Destruetque domum, et lapides
ejus, et ligna ejus, atque universum lutum domus, educetque extra
civitatem in locum immundum.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p93"></span>**46.** Moreover he that goeth into the
house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p94"></span>**46.** Qui autem ingressus fuerit domum
illam omnibus diebus quibus jusserit earn claudi, immundus erit usque ad
vesperam.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p95"></span>**47.** And he that lieth in the house
shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his
clothes.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p96"></span>**47.** Et qui dormierit in ea domo,
lavabit vestimenta sua: quique comederit in domo, lavabit vestimenta
sua.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p97"></span>**48.** And if the priest shall come in,
and look *upon it,* and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the
house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce
the house clean, because the plague is healed.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p98"></span>**48.** Si autem ingrediendo ingressus
fuerit sacerdos: contemplatusque viderit non crevisse plagam in ipsa
domo, postquam ipsa obducta fuit: mundam judicabit sacerdos domum, quia
sanata sit plaga illa.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p99"></span>**49.** And he shall take to cleanse the
house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p100"></span>**49.** Tollet itaque ad purificandam
domum duos passeres, et lignum cedrinum, et coccum vermiculi, ct
hyssopum.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p101"></span>**50.** And he shall kill the one of the
birds in an earthen vessel over running water:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p102"></span>**50.** Mactabitque passerera unum super
vas fictile, super aquas vivas.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p103"></span>**51.** And he shall take the cedar wood,
and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in
the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the
house seven times:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p104"></span>**51.** Capietque lignum cedrinum, et
hyssopum, et coccum vermiculi, et passerem vivum, et tinget illa in
sanguine passeris mactati, et in aqua vivente: aspergetque domum septem
vicibus.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p105"></span>**52.** And he shall cleanse the house
with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the
living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the
scarlet:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p106"></span>**52.** Purificabitque domum illam
sanguine passeris, et aqua viva, et passere vivo, lignoque cedrino, et
hyssopo, et cocco vermiculi.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p107"></span>**53.** But he shall let go the living
bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the
house: and it shall be clean.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p108"></span>**53.** Postea dimittet passerem vivum
extra civitatem super faciem agri, purgabitque domum, et munda erit.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p109"></span>**54.** This *is* the law for all manner
of plague of leprosy, and scall,

<span id="ii.ii.i-p110"></span>**54.** Ista est lex omnis plagae leprae,
et maculae nigrae,

<span id="ii.ii.i-p111"></span>**55.** And for the leprosy of a garment,
and of a house,

<span id="ii.ii.i-p112"></span>**55.** Et leprae vestis, et domus,

<span id="ii.ii.i-p113"></span>**56.** And for a rising, and for a scab,
and for a bright spot:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p114"></span>**56.** Et tumoris, et scabiei, et
candentis maculae:

<span id="ii.ii.i-p115"></span>**57.** To teach when *it is* unclean,
and when *it is* clean: this *is* the law of leprosy.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p116"></span>**57.** Ad docendum quid agendum, quo die
immundus et quo die mundus declarandus est.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p117"></span> 

<span id="ii.ii.i-p118"></span><span id="ii.ii.i-p118.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.i-p119"></span>**2** *This shall be the law of the
leper.* Moses now treats of the manner in which those who were cured of
leprosy were to be cleansed and restored. Thus far he had shewn whom the
priest was to admit into the holy congregation, and account to be clean;
he now prescribes the rite of expiation, whereby the people might learn
how greatly God abominates the uncleanness, which He commands to be
purified by a solemn propitiation; and also that he who is healed may
acknowledge that he is rescued from death by God’s special blessing, and
may in future be more diligent in seeking to be pure. For there were two
parts in the sacrifice here demanded-purification and thanksgiving. But
we must ever keep in view the object which I have stated in the last
chapter, that the Israelites were instructed by this ceremony to serve
God in chastity and purity, and to keep far away from those defilements,
whereby religion would be profaned. Since, then, leprosy was a kind of
pollution, God was unwilling that those who were cured of it should be
received into the holy congregation,  <span
id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) except after the offering of a sacrifice;
as if the priest reconciled them after excommunication. It will now be
well to discuss the points which are worthy of consideration. The office
of cleansing is imposed on the priest; yet he is at the same time
forbidden to cleanse any except those who were already pure and clean.
In this, on the one hand, God claims for Himself the honor of the cure,
lest men should assume it; and also establishes the discipline which He
would have to reign in His Church. To make the matter clearer, it
belongs to God only to forgive sins; what, then, remains to man, except
to be the witness and herald of the grace which He confers? God’s
minister can, therefore, absolve none whom God has not before absolved.
In sum, absolution is not in the power or will of man: the minister only
sustains an inferior part, to endorse God’s judgment, or rather to
proclaim God’s sentence. Hence that remarkable expression of Isaiah,
“I*,* even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions, *O* *Israel,
and none but me.*”  <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) (<span
id="ii.ii.i-p121.1"></span>[Isa
43:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.ii.i-p121.1"></span>.) In which sense, too, God everywhere
promises by the prophets that the people shall be clean, when He shall
have cleansed them. Meanwhile, however, this does not prevent those who
are called to the office of teaching from purging the uncleanness of the
people in a certain peculiar way. For, since faith alone purifies the
heart, in so far as it receives the testimony which God proffers by the
mouth of man, the minister who testifies that we are reconciled to God,
is justly reckoned to take away our pollution. This expiation is still
in force, though the ceremony has long ceased to be in use. But, since
the spiritual healing, which we receive by faith, proceeds from the mere
grace of God, the ministry of man does not at all detract from His
glory. Let us, then, remember that these two things are perfectly
consistent with each other, that God is the sole author of our purity;
and yet that the method, which He uses for our justification, must not
on that account be neglected. And this is properly referred to
discipline, that whosoever has been once cast out of the holy
congregation by public authority, must not be received again except upon
professing penitence and a new life. We must observe, too, that this
jurisdiction was given to the priests not only on the ground that they
represented Christ, but also in respect to the ministry, which we have
in common with them.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p122"></span><span id="ii.ii.i-p122.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.i-p123"></span>**3** *And the priest shall go forth.*
This is the examination, which was more fully treated of in the last
chapter, without which it was not lawful to receive him who had been
once rejected. The priest’s command, which is mentioned immediately
afterwards, I refer to the Levites, some one of whom probably
accompanied the priest to prepare the sacrifice, that thus the priests
might only discharge the principal duty. The sum of the rite respecting
the two birds tends to this, that the cleansing from leprosy was a kind
of resurrection Two birds were placed before their eyes; the liberty of
one was purchased by the blood of the other; because the former was not
let go until it had been first dipped in the blood and the water; and
thus the matter of sprinkling was prepared for the man’s purification.
The sevenfold repetition was intended to impress more deeply on men’s
memories a continual meditation on God’s grace; for we know that by this
number perfection is often expressed in Scripture. With the same object,
he who had been cured shaved his hair, and washed in water. Yet he did
not return home on the first day, but on the eighth. Meantime, on the
seventh day he shaved his beard, and his eyebrows, and all the hair of
his head; he washed himself and his garments, and then proceeded to the
sacrifice. So difficult is it to accustom men to a serious
acknowledgment of the two points, to hold their vice in detestation, and
worthily to estimate the grace of God whereby they are delivered.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p124"></span><span id="ii.ii.i-p124.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.i-p125"></span>**10.** *And on the eighth.* As infants
on the eighth day after they were cleansed from the uncleanness which
they had brought from the womb, were grafted into the Church, and made
members of it; so now the eighth day is prescribed for the restoration
of those who, in the cure that they have received, are as it were born
again; for they are accounted dead whom the leprosy had banished from
the holy congregation. A sacrifice is therefore appointed which may
renew the circumcision that had been in some measure effaced. Now, the
meaning of all the things here mentioned is not clear to myself, and I
would not have my readers too curious respecting them. Some may be
probably accounted for; the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and
the great toe of the right foot, were sprinkled with the blood of the
offering, because the leper was restored to the ordinary habits and
customs of life, so as to have freedom of walk and action, and free
conversational intercourse; for in the ear there is a mutual
correspondence between speaking and hearing. The head is anointed, or
cleansed with the oil, that nothing impure should remain in his whole
body  <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) God spare the poor and lowly,
and does not compel them to offer the two lambs, lest they should be
burdened beyond their means; whence it appears, that sacrifices are not
estimated according to their intrinsic value, but according to the pious
feeling which disposes each on liberally to offer in proportion to what
is given him.

<span id="ii.ii.i-p127"></span><span id="ii.ii.i-p127.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii.i-p128"></span>**34.** *When ye be come into the land.*
Another sort of leprosy is here treated of, as to which we may not
unreasonably rejoice that it is now unknown to us. But, as God had
honored that people with extraordinary privileges, so it was consistent
that their ingratitude should be punished by more severe penalties, if
they defiled the gifts in which they excelled. It is not to be wondered
at, therefore, that punishments were inflicted upon them, which it fills
us with surprise and horror to hear of. It was a sad sight to behold the
leprosy invading the human body; but there was something portentous to
perceive it affecting their houses also, and driving out the owners and
their families; for if they wittingly and voluntarily remained there,
the contagion spread to themselves and all their furniture. But, since
God marked with public ignominy those whose houses were struck with
leprosy, He commands them to confess their guilt, and not only when the
evil had made much advance, but when any suspicion of it had begun to
exist. It appears, too, from the Law, that some were but lightly
chastised: for, if after the priest’s inspection, in seven days the
plague did not increase on the scraped walls, the possessor returned to
his house. God punished others more severely, and it was necessary that
the building should be utterly destroyed, because the pollution was
incurable. But, although these were tokens of God’s wrath, yet,
inexpiating the uncleanness, He exercised His people in the study of
purity; for it was just as if He drove away from approaching His
sanctuary those who came from an unclean house. The sense, then, was
that. they should each of them diligently endeavor to keep their houses
pure, and chaste, and free from every stain. But if, through God’s
mercy, the plague ceased, a sacrifice of thanksgiving was to be offered,
as for the human beings (who had been healed.) The next chapter, in
which general pollutions and their purifications are not treated of, but
only one kind of pollution is glanced at, which has reference to fleshly
lust, would perhaps be suitably introduced under the Seventh
Commandment; but it will presently appear from the context that it must
be brought under this head.
