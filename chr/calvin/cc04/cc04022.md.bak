14:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu014.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.viii.i-p19.2"></span>.** *Ye shall not eat of any thing that
dieth of itself.* The eating of any carcase, or of flesh torn by wild
beasts, is reckoned among the causes of defilement; but we must
understand it to be the carcase of an animal which has died of hunger or
disease, for, from the nature of its death, it contracted impurity,
although in itself it were otherwise pure. The end of the precept is
gathered from the reason which is immediately subjoined, “for thou art a
holy people unto the Lord thy God,” and from the ablution which is
prescribed in the passage from Leviticus. The same thing is, secondly,
enjoined respecting flesh that has been torn, as before with regard to
the carcase, for the deformity of its laceration is counted as
uncleanness. The holiness of the people is again referred to, that they
may more diligently beware of defilements. Hence it follows that those
were contaminated who should eat of torn flesh. Therefore, in the third
passage, he confirms it that the Jews were to abstain, and were
prohibited from the eating of a carcase or the flesh of an animal torn
by beasts, lest they should pollute themselves. Nor is it an objection
that the eating of carrion and of blood are here prohibited in
conjunction with each other; for we know that Moses does not always
arrange his precepts in order, but promiscuously adduces such as
appertain to different classes. Therefore, I have thought it well to
separate these two prohibitions which have distinct objects, and whose
dissimilarity manifestly appears from the difference of their
punishment. He who shall have eaten blood shall be cut off from the
people; whereas he who shall have eaten carrion, shall wash himself and
be unclean till the evening. A question might again arise respecting
torn or lacerated flesh; but it seems in my judgment to be plain enough
from the context, that flesh torn by beasts is counted amongst unclean
meats; for the reason of the law is expressed, viz., because those who
were chosen to be a holy people should keep themselves pure and
incorrupt. Nor would God command that meat intended for man should be
thrown to dogs, unless it were infected with a contagion, which would
pollute His holy ones. As to the command, in the first passage, to give
it to a stranger, or to sell it to an alien, that he might eat it, it
does not appear reasonable, since that would be to supply the materials
for sin, as though one should offer a sword to a madman, or transfer
illicit goods to others. But the solution of this difficulty is easy:
for the Gentiles were permitted to eat indifferently of all sorts of
food, since no distinctions were placed between them; but the
prohibition of certain meats was a mark of separation between them and
the elect people of God. A more difficult question arises from a kind of
contradiction, because Moses in another passage binds both the stranger
and the home-born by the same law, and declares them to be alike unclean
if they shall have tasted of carrion. But we must bear in mind that he
sometimes calls those strangers who, although born of heathen parents,
had embraced the Law. Circumcision, therefore, connected them with God,
just as if they had derived their origin from Abraham; whilst there were
other strangers, whom uncircumcision separated from the children of
Abraham as profane and excomnmnicate. The sum is, that whosoever allege
God’s name, and boast themselves to be His people, are called to
cultivate holiness, and to keep themselves pure from every stain.
