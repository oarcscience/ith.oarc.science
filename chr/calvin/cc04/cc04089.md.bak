<span id="iii.vi.i-p8"></span><span id="iii.vi.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.i-p9"></span>**9.** *And every offering.* Thus far I
have brought together the passages, in which Moses treats of the office
of the priests, and have briefly expounded them, I will now begin to
treat of their rights, *i.e.,* of the honor which God invested them
with, that He might have them ready and cheerful in their obedience.
Here, however, Moses lightly touches upon what he more fully sets forth
in other passages, as we shall presently see, viz., He assigns to the
priests all the holy oblations, the various kinds of which He afterwards
enumerates. Now, there were three principal grounds for this law; —
*First,* Lest what had been already dedicated to God should be profaned
by its promiscuous use; for, that the sacrifices might retain their
proper dignity, it was necessary to distinguish the sacred from ordinary
meats. *Secondly,* A vainglorious excess in respect to the ceremonies
was restrained; for if after the victims were killed all the flesh had
been returned to the owners, a desire of ostentation  <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) would have grown up amongst foolish
men, the rich would have come emulously to gain applause, and when they
had feasted magnificently, they would have exposed the rest for sale.
Thus would they have abused their false pretense of worshipping God to
the acquirement of favor towards themselves. The *third* ground is that
which Paul touches upon, viz., that it is just that the ministers of the
altar should live by the altar, (<span id="iii.vi.i-p10.2"></span>[1Co
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.vi.i-p10.2"></span>;) for though it is an unworthy thing that
the servants of God should be attracted by their hire, yet was God
unwilling that the priests, when they had freely bestowed their labor on
the worship of the sanctuary, should suffer from hunger, lest their
alacrity might thus be repressed. For if they desired to execute their
office properly, it was necessary that they should attend altogether to
spiritual things, and abandon the care of their domestic affairs. If any
should object that these were incentives to avarice, and that an
excellent and profitable calling was set before the priests, the reply
is easy: whatever came to their share, since it was restricted to their
own eating, could not have been excessive in quantity; for they were not
allowed to sell any, nor even to give it away to others, as we have
already seen, and as will hereafter be repeated. Thus then the foul
dishonesty of those, who taunt Moses as if he had enriched the priests
by the spoils of the people, is abundantly reftired; for if there were
any whose interests he would have desired to consult, surely his own
sons would have been preferred to all; yet to them there is no reference
here. Nay, whatever he grants to the priests, he takes away from his own
sons and their posterity; as if he purposely deprived them of advantages
which were not otherwise unlawful. In a word, the dignity of holy things
was alone consulted, without any endeavor being made to enrich the
priests.
