<span id="ii.x.x-p3"></span>**14.** When thou art come unto the land
which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt
dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the
nations that *are* about me;

<span id="ii.x.x-p4"></span>**14.** Quum ingressus fueris terrain quam
Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi, et possederis eam, et habitaveris in ea*,* ac
dixeris, Constituam super me regem sicut omnes gentes quae sunt per
circuitus meos.

<span id="ii.x.x-p5"></span>**15.** Thou shalt in any wise set *him*
king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: *one* from among thy
brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger
over thee, which *is* not thy brother.

<span id="ii.x.x-p6"></span>**15.** Constituendo constitues super te
regem quem elegerit Jehova Deus tuus: e medio fratrum tuorum constitues
super te regem: non poteris constituere super te virum alienigenam, qui
non sit frater tuus.

<span id="ii.x.x-p7"></span>**16.** But he shall not multiply horses to
himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he
should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye
shall henceforth return no more that way.

<span id="ii.x.x-p8"></span>**16.** Verum non multiplicabit sibi equos,
neque reducet populum in Aegyptum ad multiplicandos equos: quum Jehova
dixerit vobis, Non adjicietis reverti per hanc viam amplius.

<span id="ii.x.x-p9"></span>**17.** Neither shall he multiply wives to
himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply
to himself silver and gold.

<span id="ii.x.x-p10"></span>**17.** Neque multiplicabit sibi uxores,
neque avertetur cor ejus, neque plurimum argentum et aurum sibi
cumulabit.

<span id="ii.x.x-p11"></span>**18.** And it shall be*,* when he sitteth
upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shalt write him a copy of this
law in a book out of *that which is* before the priests the Levites:

<span id="ii.x.x-p12"></span>**18.** Verum quum sederit super solium
regni sui, tunc describet sibi exemplar legis hujus in volumine; a
conspectu sacerdotum et Levitarum.

<span id="ii.x.x-p13"></span>**19.** And it shalt be with him, and he
shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear
the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes,
to do them:

<span id="ii.x.x-p14"></span>**19.** Eritque apud eum, et leget in eo
cunctis diebus vitae suae: ut scilicet discat timere Jehovam Deum suum:
et observare omnia verba legis hujus, atque statuta haec, ut faciat ea.

<span id="ii.x.x-p15"></span>**20.** That his heart be not lifted up
above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment,
*to* the right hand, or *to* the left: to the end that he may prolong
*his* days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.

<span id="ii.x.x-p16"></span>**20.** Ne elevetur cor ejus super fratres
ipsius, neque declinet a praecepto ad dextram aut ad sinistram, ut
proroget dies in regno suo: ipsc et filii ejus in medio Israelis.

<span id="ii.x.x-p19"></span>**14.** *When thou art come unto the land.*
In this passage God sets forth the merits of that sacerdotal kingdom, of
which mention is made elsewhere; for, since the splendor of the royal
name might dazzle their eyes, so that they should forget that God
retained the sovereignty over them, they are thus early admonished how
unjust it would be if the majesty of God should be diminished by the
rule of a mortal man. In sum, the power of kings is here put beneath
that of God; and kings themselves are consecrated unto obedience to Him,
lest the people should ever turn to ungodliness, whatever change of
government might take place. But although under the judges religion was
often subverted, yet it was not without a cause that a special law was
enacted with respect to kings, because nothing is more likely than that
earthly pomps should draw men away from piety. Now we understand the
design of God in this matter, let us proceed to examine its several
parts. He passes over (as I have said) all the intermediate time until
the beginning of the kingdom, because this new state of things brought
with it an increase of danger: for as long as the judges were in power,
their different form of government separated the Jews from heathen
nations. All the surrounding neighbors were subject to kings; and God
always retained the preeminence, whilst He raised up judges from amongst
the people; but when they began to choose kings for themselves, they
were so mixed up with the Gentiles, that it was easy for them to fall
into other corruptions. For the very similarity (of their governments)
united them more closely; wherefore, it is expressly said, When thou
shalt set a king over thee “like as all the nations that are about”
thee. For God signifies that the example of the nations would be an evil
snare to them, that they should desire to have a king, and thus their
condition would in future be identical, though by divine decree it had
been distinct. In short, their rebellion is here indirectly condemned,
when God foretells that they would wantonly shake off their yoke; as
indeed actually took place, when they rejected Samuel, and tumultuously
required a king. On which point God elsewhere complains that He was
despised. But the question arises, how these two things can be
reconciled, that kings should reign over them from the lust or foolish
desire of the people, and yet that the kingdom was the chief glory of
the people, a special pledge of God’s favor, and consequently of their
welfare and full felicity. The prophecy of Jacob is well known,

<span id="ii.x.x-p20"></span>"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, —
until Shiloh come.” (<span id="ii.x.x-p20.1"></span>[Ge
49:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010)<span id="ii.x.x-p20.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.x.x-p21"></span>Whence it appears that a king was promised
to the children of Abraham as an inestimable blessing. Why, then, does
not God declare Himself its author? I reply that, although it was God’s
design from the beginning to set up David as a type of Christ, yet,
because their unseemly haste disturbed the order of things, the
commencement of the kingdom is ascribed to the people’s fault, when they
were impelled by their perverse emulation to wish to be like the
Gentiles. God appears then to have designedly censured their wilfulness,
as if He had said, “Although by appointing a king, you approach more
nearly to the Gentiles, beware lest your perverse desire should
altogether turn you away from true religion.

<span id="ii.x.x-p22"></span><span id="ii.x.x-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ii.x.x-p23"></span>**15.** *Thou shalt in any wise set him
king over thee.* First of all, God maintains His own supremacy in the
appointment of a king, and does not consign the matter to the people’s
own suffrages; that thus He may chastise their audacity in demanding a
king in accordance with a hasty impulse. Secondly, He commands that he
should be taken from the people themselves, and excludes foreigners,
because, if they had been admitted, a door was opened to apostasy; for
each would have tried to force upon them his native gods, and true
religion would have been persecuted by the force and threatenings of the
royal power. Behold why God would not suffer a king to be sought
elsewhere but from the bosom of His Church; in order that he might
cherish and maintain that pure worship which he had imbibed from his
childhood.

<span id="ii.x.x-p24"></span><span id="ii.x.x-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.x.x-p25"></span>**16** *But he shall not multiply horses.*
The royal power is here circumscribed within certain limits, lest it
should exalt itself too much in reliance on the glory of its dignity,
 <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) For we know how insatiable are the
desires of kings, inasmuch as they imagine that all things are lawful to
them. Therefore, although the royal dignity may be splendid, God would
not have it to be the pretext of unrestrained power, but restricts and
limits it to legal bounds.  <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) <span
id="ii.x.x-p27.3"></span>רק, *rak*, is an adversative particle which
some construe *only;* almost with the same meaning, because this
exception was added to restrain the passions of their kings. The first
prohibition is, that he should not collect for himself a multitude of
horses; but, since it is twice repeated, we must consider why it is so.
Many thus translate it, “He shall not multiply horses, nor cause the
people to return to Egypt, to multiply horses;” but this manner of
speaking is harsh and obscure. Now, since the particle <span
id="ii.x.x-p27.4"></span>למען *lemagnan,* signifies “for the sake of
(*propter*)*,* it may be properly translated to the letter, “for the
sake of multiplying *horses,*” (*propter multiplicare, vel propter ad
multiplicandum.*) I have no doubt, then, but that God condemns an
immoderate number of horses from the consequences which might ensue;
because it might excite the minds of the kings rashly to undertake
expeditions against the Egyptians. This, therefore, I consider to be the
genuine meaning, that the king should not provide himself with horses in
too great numbers, lest, when he was in possession of many horses, he
should lead his army into Egypt. Thus, amongst other evils which might
arise from a multitude of horses, Moses mentions this, that the king’s
mind will be puffed up with pride, so as to invade Egypt with an army of
horse. Now, the question is, why God forbade His people to return by
that way? Some explain it, that the horses would be brought contrary to
God’s command, who had forbidden them to trade (with that people;)
 <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) but this does not seem
appropriate. Others think that the people were prohibited from passing
the desert, lest in their curiosity they should be ungrateful to God;
but this, too, is far-farfetched. To me it seems probable, that this
journey was prohibited them, in order that, being mindful of their
deliverance, they should be content with their own boundaries. They had
been rescued from a thousand deaths: if they had voluntarily gone
thither to provoke an adversary, their confidence would have been a sign
of their despising and forgetting God’s grace. Therefore, in order that
the recollection of their redemption should be deeply impressed upon
their minds, God would have the honor put upon His miracles, that they
should avoid those regions like the abysses of death. Unless perhaps
this reason may be preferred, that a handle for those wicked alliances
was cut off, which we see were audaciously contracted, because the kings
of Israel gloried in the abundance of their cavalry. But the former
explanation is most suitable. This law, however, was not obeyed by their
best kings; and hence it appears that the wilfulness and pride of their
kings could scarcely be repressed by any restraints.

<span id="ii.x.x-p29"></span><span id="ii.x.x-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ii.x.x-p30"></span>**17** *Neither shall he multiply wives to
himself.* Polygamy at that time had generally prevailed, so that the
very humblest of the people violated the marriage vow with impunity; and
therefore it was necessary that the kings should be bound with closer
restrictions, lest by their example they should give greater countenance
to incontinency. And thus their ignorance is easily refuted who conclude
that what was specially interdicted to the kings was permitted to
private individuals, whereas the law of chastity was imposed upon the
former, because without this remedy there would be no bounds to their
lasciviousness. Besides, the people would have been subjected to great
expense on their account*,* since such is the ambition of women, that
they would all have desired to receive royal treatment, and would have
even vied with each other in finery, as actually came to pass. David
transgressed this law, and in some degree excusably on account of his
repudiation by Michal; still it appears that lust had more power over
him than the continency prescribed by God. What follows is so connected
by some as if it were the reason of the foregoing sentence, in this way,
“that kings were not to multiply wives to themselves, lest their heart
should turn away from what was right,” as was the case with Solomon;
for, from being too devoted to his wives, and being deceived by the
snares of women, he fell into idolatry. And assuredly it can scarcely
fail to happen, that when many wives beset a man, they must render his
mind effeminate, and stifle in him all his manly good sense. Yet I
prefer taking the clause separately, that kings must beware lest the
splendor of their dignity should affect the soundness of their judgment,
for nothing is more difficult than for one in great power to continue
disposed to temperance. Therefore God does not in vain enjoin that they
should constantly persevere in their duty, and not lose their
understanding. Moreover, He forbids kings to heap up treasures, because
it cannot be done without rapine and violent exactions; whilst, at the
same time, wealth encourages them audaciously to undertake unjust wars,
incites them to gross dissipation, and at length hurries them forward to
tyrannical excesses. First, therefore, God would have kings beware, lest
in their pursuit of riches they should exhaust the blood of the people,
and lest they should lavish their ill-gotten money in superfluous
expenses, and be extravagant with what belongs to others; and lastly,
lest they should be tempted by the pride of wealth to attempt unlawful
things.

<span id="ii.x.x-p31"></span><span id="ii.x.x-p31.1"></span>

<span id="ii.x.x-p32"></span>**18.** *And it shall be, when he sitteth
upon the throne.* It would not be enough to correct their errors unless
kings were also instructed in the fear of God, and properly taught their
duty; now, therefore, a system of discipline is added, whereby it was
profitable for them to be grounded in the study of religion and justice,
viz., that they should take the Law from the priests and Levites, which
was to be the rule of all their actions. Because the demonstrative
pronoun is used,  <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) some think that
only the book of Deuteronomy is referred to, but without good reason. I
make no doubt but that the whole sum of doctrine is included, which is
delivered both here and in Exodus and Leviticus. But although it was
without exception to be common to all, yet in order that kings might be
more assiduously attentive in reading it, God would have a copy
peculiarly dedicated to their use by the priests and Levites, and given
into their hands in a solemn ceremony; that kings might know that they
required greater wisdom and counsel for ruling the people than private
persons. When, therefore, the priests and Levites presented them with
this book, it was as if God deposited this treasure with the king. He
then enjoins that they should exercise themselves in the doctrine of the
Law through the whole course of their lives, because kings are usually
supplied with books only out of ostentation and pomp, and when they have
tasted of what is taught in them, straightway grow tired and cease to
read them. Finally, the object of their reading is subjoined: first of
all, in general, that they may learn to fear God and keep His statutes;
and, secondly, lest, being lifted up with pride and vanity, they should
despise and oppress their brethren. And the word *brethren* is used
designedly, lest they should imagine that the law of brotherhood was
abolished, because they were set over the whole people; but rather that
they should study to cherish all as members (of themselves.) Again, it
is afterwards repeated, lest they should “turn aside to the right hand
or the left;” because, when men have much liberty of action, their lusts
can never be sufficiently restrained. But, lest it should be grievous to
them to be thus reduced to order, finally God reminds them that this
moderation would be useful to them, for that they thus would prolong
their reigns; whereas the tyranny of kings is often their destruction;
as the Lacedemonian king replied, when his wife was annoyed that the
Ephori were appointed to restrain him, “that he should indeed leave less
power to his children, but that it would be the more lasting.  <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) But, here a long succession is promised
by God’s favor, if they were willing to guide themselves aright.
