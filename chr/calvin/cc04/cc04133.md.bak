<span id="iii.xi.vi-p5"></span>**18.** How he met thee by the way, and
smote the hindmost of thee, *even* all *that were* feeble behind thee,
when thou *wast* faint and weary; and he feared not God.

<span id="iii.xi.vi-p6"></span>**18.** Quod tibi occurrerit in via, et
te in cauda agminis aggressus sit, omnium debilium post to, quum esses
lassus et fatigatus, et non timuerit Deum.

<span id="iii.xi.vi-p7"></span>**19.** Therefore it shall be, when the
LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in
the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee *for* an inheritance to
possess it, *that* thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from
under heaven; thou shalt not forget *it.*

<span id="iii.xi.vi-p8"></span>**19.** Erit ergo quum dederit requiem
Jehova Deus tuus tibi ab omnibus inimicis tuis per circuitum, in terra
quam Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi in haereditatem ut possideas eam, delebis
memoriam Amalec de sub coelo, ne obliviscaris.

<span id="iii.xi.vi-p11"></span>**17.** *Remember what Amalek did unto
thee.* We have elsewhere seen how the Amalekites were the first who made
a hostile attack upon the people, and endeavored to interrupt their
journey; and Moses also related the sentence of God against them, the
execution of which he now enjoins upon the people. God then swore that
there should be perpetual war against them throughout all ages; and,
that His threatening might not be frustrated, He appoints His people to
take vengeance upon their great cruelty and impiety. For when the
Israelites were inflicting no injury nor loss upon them, it was an act
of injustice to make war upon peaceful persons proceeding, without doing
any wrong, to another land. But humanity was still more grossly violated
by them, inasmuch as they did not spare their own kindred, and thus cast
away the feelings of nature. It is plain from <span
id="iii.xi.vi-p11.1"></span>[Ge
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.xi.vi-p11.1"></span>, that the Amalekites were the descendants
of Esau; and hence it follows that they were both sprung from the same
ancestor, Isaac. It is true that this command seems but little in
accordance with religion, that the people should retaliate an injury
done to them. I reply, that they are not stimulated to vindictive
feelings in these words, but that they are commanded to punish the sins
of Amalek with the same severity as those of the other nations. God
appears, indeed, to influence them by private motives when He recounts
the cruelty shewn by the Amalekites; but we must judge of the intention
of the Legislator with reference to His nature, for we know that no
angry or hateful passions can be approved by God; and hence it is easy
to conclude that the command was such as the people might obey with
well-regulated zeal. The first origin of the crime is specified, viz.,
because they “feared not God,” for this must not be taken in its
ordinary meaning, but as expressing that they rebelled against God as it
were deliberately. For the promise given to Abraham and Isaac could not
be unknown to them; but, since Esau, the founder of their race, had
fallen from the right of primogeniture, it came to pass that they
attempted to bring God’s covenant to nought out of wicked and
sacrilegious jealousy; and this is the reason why He unites them with
the reprobate nations unto the same destruction. The word <span
id="iii.xi.vi-p11.2"></span>זנב, *zineb,* which means to crop the tail,
is equivalent to making an attack on the rear, where the baggage and
invalids are wont to be placed.  <span id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md)

assailli le peuple comme en trahison;” whence it follows that the
Amalekites assailed the people treacherously.
