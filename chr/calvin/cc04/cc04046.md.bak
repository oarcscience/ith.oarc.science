<span id="iii.iii.iii-p3"></span>**16.** Take heed to yourselves, that
your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and
worship them;

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p4"></span>**16.** Cavete *ergo* vobis ne
seducatur cor vestrum, et recedatis, colatisque deos alienos, et vos
incurvetis coram eis.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p5"></span>**17.** And *then* the LORD’S wrath be
kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain,
and that the land yield not her fruit; and *lest* ye perish quickly from
off the good land which the LORD giveth you.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p6"></span>**17.** Unde excandescat ira Jehovae in
vos, et claudat coelos ne sit pluvia, ac ne det terra fructum suum:
pere-atisque celeriter e terra bona quam Jehova dat vobis.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p8"></span><span id="iii.iii.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p9"></span>**16** *Take heed to yourselves.* By
often inculcating the same thing, viz., that they should diligently take
heed, he indirectly arraigns man’s proneness to superstition; and this
too is again expressed in the words, “that your heart be not deceived;”
for by them he signifies, that unless they take diligent heed to
themselves, nothing will be more easy than for them to fall into the
snares of Satan. Wherefore the impudence of the Papists is the less
excusable, who intoxicate their own and others’ minds with security,
when God constantly exhorts them to solicitude. Let us learn, then, that
since many impostures and deceits besiege us on every side, we shall in
the vanity of our nature be liable immediately to fall into them, unless
we carefully guard ourselves. By the expression “turn aside,” he implies
what has been before said, that whosoever declines to corrupted worship,
impiously falls away from the true God. Unbelievers but little think so,
for with them it is a light transgression to exceed in this respect; and
they would wilfully blind the eyes of God with their inventions
(*commentis*)*,* nay, there is nothing too silly for them to desire to
be approved of, and sanctioned by God. But if it be objected that
obedience is better than sacrifice*,* they shield themselves under the
cover of their good intention, as if God were not at liberty to
repudiate what they foolishly obtrude upon Him. At any rate, they so
pertinaciously indulge themselves in their inconsiderate zeal, that they
will hardly acknowledge the slightest fault in it. But, on the other
side, God declares that all are apostates who do not confine themselves
to the simplicity of the Law. A threat is again added, that God will
avenge the violation of His worship, and will curse their land, until He
shall destroy them by dearth and famine; and, finally, He pronounces
that they shall perish off that land which God had promised them to the
end that He might be there purely worshipped.
