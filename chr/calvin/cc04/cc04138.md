20:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.i.i-p7.2"></span>.**
*Thou shalt not take the name.* There is a manifest *synecdoche* in this
Commandment; for in order that God may procure for His name its due
reverence, He forbids its being taken in vain, especially in oaths.
Whence we infer on the other hand an affirmative commandment, that every
oath should be a testimony of true piety, whereby the majesty of God
Himself should obtain its proper glory. Moreover, it is clear that not
only when we swear by God, His name is to be reverently honored, but
whenever mention of it is made. Thus in these words He maintains His
holiness not only in His word, but also in His works, against all
profane contempt of it. We shall soon see that to swear by God’s name is
a species or part of religious worship, and this is manifest too from
the words of <span id="iv.i.i-p7.3"></span>[Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md)<span id="iv.i.i-p7.3"></span>;
for when he predicts that all nations shall devote themselves to pure
religion, he thus speaks, “As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall
bow to me, and every tongue shall swear by me.”  <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) Now, if the bowing of the knees be a
token of adoration, this swearing which is connected with it is
equivalent to an acknowledgment that He is God. Since, then, reason
dictates that the *species* is put for the *genus,* we must see what is
to be understood by God’s *name,* and by the adverb <span
id="iv.i.i-p8.3"></span>לשוא*, leshav.* It is silly and childish to
restrict this to the name Jehovah,  <span
id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) as if God’s majesty were confined to
letters or syllables; but, whereas His essence is invisible, His name is
set before us as an image, in so far as God manifests Himself to us, and
is distinctly made known to us by His own marks, just as men are each by
his own name. On this ground Christ teaches that God’s name is
comprehended in the heavens, the earth, the temple, the altar, (<span
id="iv.i.i-p9.2"></span>[Mt 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#034.md)<span
id="iv.i.i-p9.2"></span>,) because His glory is conspicuous in them.
Consequently, God’s name is profaned whenever any detraction is made
from His supreme wisdom, infinite power, justice, truth, clemency, and
rectitude. If a shorter definition be preferred, let us say that His
name is what Paul calls <span id="iv.i.i-p9.3"></span>τὸ γνωστόν*,
“*that which may be known” of Him. (<span id="iv.i.i-p9.4"></span>[Ro
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019)<span id="iv.i.i-p9.4"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.i.i-p10"></span>God’s name, then, is taken in vain, not
only when any one abuses it by perjury, but when it is lightly and
disrespectfully adduced in proof of frivolous and trifling matters: I
speak with respect to oaths. In this, however, man’s ingratitude is very
gross, that when God grants them His name, as if at their entreaty, to
put an end to their strifes and to be a pledge of their truth, still it
flies promiscuously from their mouths not without manifest disrespect.
God will again condemn perjury in the Fifth Commandment of the Second
Table, viz., in so far as it offends against and violates charity by
injuring our neighbors. The aim and object of this Commandment is
different, *i.e.,* that the honor due to God may be unsullied; that we
should only speak of Him religiously; that becoming veneration of Him
should be maintained among us. The word <span
id="iv.i.i-p10.1"></span>לשוא, *leshau,* might indeed be translated “for
falsehood,” and in this sense we shall see it used elsewhere; but since
it often is equivalent to <span id="iv.i.i-p10.2"></span>חנם*, chinam,*
which means gratuitously, or in vain, this exposition seems to be most
appropriate. In this, too, fuller and richer instruction is contained,
viz., that men should not drag in His name in light matters, as in sport
or derision of Him, which cannot be done without insulting and profaning
it. And thus the holiness of God’s name, which preserves us in His fear
and in true piety, is contrasted with the particle <span
id="iv.i.i-p10.3"></span>לשוא, *leshau.* But since nothing is more
difficult than to restrain men’s licentiousness in this respect, and to
excuse or at least diminish the sin, the slipperiness of the tongue is
pleaded, its punishment is here denounced: that if God’s name is rashly
exposed to reproach or contempt, He will avenge it. The more hardened,
therefore, in their licentiousness they may be, the less will be their
impunity; so far is depraved habit from diminishing the guilt.
