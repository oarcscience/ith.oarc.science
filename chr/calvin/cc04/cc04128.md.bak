<span id="iii.xi.i-p10"></span>**2.** Ye shall utterly destroy all the

upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:

<span id="iii.xi.i-p11"></span>**2.** Destruendo destruetis omnia loca

id="iii.xi.i-p31.2"></span>[Exodus
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.xi.i-p31.2"></span>.** *Thou shalt utterly overthrow them.* I
allow indeed that these supplements would partly agree with, and be
applicable to, the First Commandment; but since express mention is
everywhere made in them of idols, this place seems to be better suited
to them. After Moses has taught what was necessary to be observed, he
adds a political law about breaking down altars and overthrowing images,
in order that the people may take the more diligent heed. These
passages, however, differ from the foregoing; for in condemning thus far
the superstitions which are vicious in themselves, God prescribed what
He would have observed even to the end of the world. He now confirms
that instruction by temporary enactments, that He may keep His ancient
people up to their duty. For we have now-a-days no scruples in retaining
the temples, which have been polluted by idols, and applying them to a
better use; since we are not bound by what was added consequently (<span
id="iii.xi.i-p31.3"></span>*propter consequentiam*), as they say, to the
Law. I admit indeed that whatever tends to foster superstition should be
removed, provided we are not too rigorously superstitious in insisting
peremptorily on what is in itself indifferent. The sum amounts to this,
that to shew more clearly how greatly God detests idolatry, He would
have the memory of all those things abolished which had once been
dedicated to idols. The *second* passage more fully unfolds what Moses
had briefly adverted to in the first; for under the word “image,” he
included all those tokens of idolatry which he afterwards enumerates,
and of which he commands the whole land to be so cleared that no relics
of them should remain. From the words, when ye have come into the land
“to possess it,” Augustin  <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md)
sensibly infers, that there is no command for private individuals to
destroy the instruments of idolatry; but that the people are armed and
furnished with this authority to take the charge of regulating the
public interests, when they have obtained possession of the land. The
*third* passage is more brief, only enumerating three kinds; the
*fourth* adds “graven images,” (<span
id="iii.xi.i-p32.5"></span>*sculptilia*.) The *fifth* omits the groves,
and puts in their place images or representations made of molten
materials; and here we must observe what we have before adverted to,
that the name of statue (<span id="iii.xi.i-p32.6"></span>*statuoe*) is
sometimes taken in a good sense; and therefore the Jews think that what
was permitted to the fathers before the Law is now forbidden. To us,
however, it seems more probable, that the statues now condemned are not
such as Jacob erected only as a monument, but such as they pretended to
be a likeness of God. Some translate the word “titles,”  <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) others “pictures,” with what propriety
I leave to the judgment of my readers. He adds “*image,*”  <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) a word which, though not in itself
sinful, is still deservedly rejected in connection with the worship of
God. Man is the image of God; for Moses uses this same word, when
relating the creation of man. But to represent God by any figure, before
which He is worshipped, is nothing less than to corrupt His glory, and
so to metamorphose Him. By speaking of molten images, he admits neither
sculptures nor pictures; but since they are generally cast in the
precious metals, the people were expressly to beware of keeping gods of
gold or silver for ornament.
