<span id="iii.xi.ii-p7"></span>**21.** *Thou shalt not plant thee.* It
is plain from the end of this verse that it is part of the Second
Commandment. We know  <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) that
amongst the heathen nations groves were sacred, so that with them no
religious object would receive due reverence, except under the shade of
trees. Wherefore lest conformity with this general custom should vitiate
the pure worship of God, this distinction was made; and this then is the
intent of the prohibition, that the Jews should fly from all strange
rites, lest by too closely approaching the Gentiles, they should
introduce a sinful medley. But how necessary this prohibition was,
appears from their eager imitation (of the heathen), of which mention is
constantly made in the sacred history. For there was scarcely any period
in which they abstained from “high places.” Nor is it without reason
that Isaiah and Jeremiah reprove them for “playing the harlot under
every green tree.” (<span id="iii.xi.ii-p8.6"></span>[Isa
