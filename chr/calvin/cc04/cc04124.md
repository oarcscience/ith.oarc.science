<span id="iii.x.xvi-p3"></span>**18.** Thou shalt not bring the hire of
a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for
any vow: for even both these *are* abomination unto the LORD thy God.

<span id="iii.x.xvi-p4"></span>**18.** Non offeres mercedem meretricis,
nec pretium canis in domum Jehovae Dei tui, pro quocunque voto: quia
abominatio Jehovae Dei tui utrumque est.

<span id="iii.x.xvi-p7"></span>**18.** *Thou shalt not bring the hire.*
This command has an affinity to the foregoing, for God, rejecting
whatever is acquired by illicit and filthy traffic, teaches us that the
utmost chastity is to be observed in sacred things; nor does He only
refuse the hire of a whore, but also the price of a dog, lest the
sanctity of the altar should be polluted by any impure oblation. Still
the dog seems to be rejected in comparison with other animals out of
contempt; for it was just as wrong to kill a pig as a dog, yet might the
price of a pig be offered. The dog, therefore, is rejected not only as
an unclean animal, but also as vile and contemptible. In sum, God would
impress upon them the reverence due to His temple and altar.
