<span id="iii.vi.iv-p3"></span>**8.** But if the man have no kinsman to
recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the
LORD, *even* to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an
atonement shall be made for him.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p4"></span>**8.** Si non fuerit viro redhibitor cui
restituat delictum, delictum restituetur Jehovae, sacerdotis erit,
procter arietem expiationum quo expiebit eum.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p7"></span>**8** *But if the man have no kinsman.*
This passage, which I have inserted from chapter 5 is connected  <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) indeed with another subject, and yet,
because it directly refers to the right of the priests, it was necessary
to remove it to this place, especially since it expresses that kind of
sacrifice which Moses has lately adverted to, *i.e.,* when they expiated
the crime of theft. God did not indeed desire that the priests should be
enriched by others’ losses, nor that thieves should go free, if they
offered what they had stolen to the priests; but, if there were no one
to whom they could restore it, He would have their houses delivered from
(the proceeds of) their sin; and with very good reason, since otherwise
the very gross offender would have never hesitated to plunder the goods
of a dead man, if he were without heirs. First, therefore, He commanded
their property to be restored to the lawful owners; and, if they were
dead, He substituted their kinsmen, who are called <span
id="iii.vi.iv-p8.3"></span>גאלים, *goelim,* on account of the right of
redemption, which God granted in the Law to relatives, as we shall see
elsewhere; and because he who was next of kin was commanded to marry the
widow of one who had left no seed. It was therefore a very uncommon
thing that a person who had defrauded another had to recompense the loss
to the priest; for in most cases some successor to the dead man would be
found.

indeed on the subject of theft which is treated more at length. — *Fr*.
