<span id="v.v.iv-p3"></span>**1.** Observe the month of Abib, and keep
the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD
thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.

<span id="v.v.iv-p4"></span>**1.** Observa mensem Abib, et fac Pesah
Jehovae Deo tuo: quia mense Abib eduxit to Jehova Deus tuus ex Aegypto
nocte.

<span id="v.v.iv-p5"></span>**2.** Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the
passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place
which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.

<span id="v.v.iv-p6"></span>2 Et sacrificabis Pesah Jehovae Deo tuo de
pecudibus et bobus, in loco quem elegerit Jehova ut habitare faciat
nomen suum ibi.

<span id="v.v.iv-p7"></span>**5.** Thou mayest not sacrifice the
passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:

<span id="v.v.iv-p8"></span>**5.** Non poteris sacrificare Pesah in
aliqua e portis tuis quas Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi.

<span id="v.v.iv-p9"></span>**6.** But at the place which the LORD thy
God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the
passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou
camest forth out of Egypt.

<span id="v.v.iv-p10"></span>**6.** Sed in loco quem elegerit Jehova
Deus tuus ut habitare faciat nomen suum ibi: sacrificabis Pesah ad
vesperam, occumbente sole, tempore quo egressus es ex Aegypto.

<span id="v.v.iv-p11"></span>**7.** And thou shalt roast and eat *it* in
the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in
the morning, and go unto thy tents.

<span id="v.v.iv-p12"></span>**7.** Assabis autem ac comedes in loco
quem elegerit Jehova Deus tuus, postea mane conversus reverteris in
tabernacula tua.

<span id="v.v.iv-p13"></span>**8.** Six days thou shalt eat unleavened
bread: and on the seventh day *shall be* a solemn assembly to the LORD
thy God: thou shalt do no work *therein.*

<span id="v.v.iv-p14"></span>**8.** Sex diebus comedes infermentata, die
autem septimo erit solennitas Jehovae Deo tuo: non facies opus ullum.

<span id="v.v.iv-p15"></span>**9.** Seven weeks shalt thou number unto
thee: begin to number the seven weeks from *such time as* thou beginnest
*to put* the sickle to the corn.

<span id="v.v.iv-p16"></span>**9.** Septem hebdomadas numerabis tibi, ex
quo ceperit falx esse in segete, incipies numerare septem hebdomadas.

<span id="v.v.iv-p17"></span>**10.** And thou shalt keep the feast of
weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of
thine hand, which thou shalt give *unto the LORD thy God,* according as
the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:

<span id="v.v.iv-p18"></span>**10.** Postea celebrabis solennitatem
hebdomadum Jehovae Deo tuo pro facultate spontaneae marius tuae quod
dabis pront benedixerit tibi Jehova Deus tuus.

<span id="v.v.iv-p19"></span>**11.** And thou shalt rejoice before the
LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant,
and thy maidservant, and the Levite that *is* within thy gates, and the
stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that *are* among you, in
the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.

<span id="v.v.iv-p20"></span>**11.** Et laetaberis coram Jehova Deo tuo,
tu et filius tuus et filia tua, et servus tuns et ancilla tua, et Levita
qui est intra portas tuas, et peregrinus, et pupillus, et vidua, qui
fuerint in medio tui, in loco quem elegerit Jehova Deus tuus ut habitare
faciat nomen suum ibi.

<span id="v.v.iv-p21"></span>**12.** And thou shalt remember that thou
wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.

<span id="v.v.iv-p22"></span>**12.** Et recordaberis quod servus fueris
in Aegypto, propterea custodies ac facies statuta haec.

<span id="v.v.iv-p23"></span>**13.** Thou shalt observe the feast of
tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and
thy wine:

<span id="v.v.iv-p24"></span>**13.** Solennitatem tabernaculorum facies
septem diebus, quum collegeris tu de area tua, et de torculari tuo.

<span id="v.v.iv-p25"></span>**14.** And thou shalt rejoice in thy
feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy
maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the
widow, that *are* within thy gates.

<span id="v.v.iv-p26"></span>**14.** Et laetaberis in solennitate tua,
tu et filius tuus et filia tua, et servus tuus et ancilla tua, et
Levita, et peregrinus, et pupillus, et vidua, qui habitaverint intra
portas tuas.

<span id="v.v.iv-p27"></span>**15.** Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn
feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose:
because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in
all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

<span id="v.v.iv-p28"></span>**15.** Septem diebus solennitatem
celebrabis Jehovae Deo tuo in loco quem elegerit Jehova: quum
benedixerit tibi Jehova Deus tuus in cunctis frugibus this, et in omni
opere manuum tuarum, et eris tantummodo laetus.

<span id="v.v.iv-p29"></span>**16.** Three times in a year shall all thy
males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose;
in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the
feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:

<span id="v.v.iv-p30"></span>**16.** Tribus vicibus quotannis
conspicietur omnis masculus tuus coram Jehova Deo tuo, in loco quem
elegerit, in solennitate inferment atorum, et in solennitate hebdomadum,
et in solennitate tabernaculorum, neque quisquam conspicietur coram
Jehova vacuus.

<span id="v.v.iv-p31"></span>**17.** Every man *shall give* as he is
able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given
thee.

<span id="v.v.iv-p32"></span>**17.** Quisque secundum donum manus suae,
secundum benedictionem Jehovae Dei tui quam dedit tibi.

<span id="v.v.iv-p33"></span> 

<span id="v.v.iv-p34"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p34.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p35"></span>**1.** *Observe the month Abib.* For what
purpose God instituted the Passover, has already been shewn in the
exposition of the First Commandment; for since it was a symbol of
redemption, and in that ceremony the people exercised themselves in the
pure worship of the One God, so as to acknowledge Him to be their only
Father, and to distinguish Him from all idols, I thought that the actual
slaying of the lamb should be introduced amongst the Supplements to the
First Commandment. It only remains for us to speak here of what relates
to the Sabbath. This then was the first solemn day, on which God would
have His people rest and go up to Jerusalem, forsaking all their
business. But mention is here made not only of the Paschal Lamb, but He
also commands sheep and oxen to be slain in the place which He should
choose. In these words He signifies that on that day a holy convocation
was to be held; which is soon after more clearly expressed, for I have
already given the two intermediate verses in the institution of the
Passover itself, He therefore prohibits their slaying the Passover apart
in their own cities, but would have them all meet in the same sanctuary.
It has been elsewhere said that one altar was prescribed for them, as if
God would gather them under one banner for the preservation of concord
and the unity of the faith. What is added respecting the solemnity of
the seventh day is very appropriate to this place.

<span id="v.v.iv-p36"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p36.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p37"></span>**9.** *Seven weeks shalt thou number.* It
must be observed that the Passover fell in a part of the year when the
harvests were beginning to ripen; and consequently the first-fruits, of
which I treated under the First Commandment, were then offered. Seven
weeks afterwards they celebrated another feast-day, which was called
Pentecost, *i.e.,* the fiftieth, by the Greeks. There was just this
number of days between the departure of the people and the publication
of the Law. Another offering of first-fruits was then made, in which
each one, according to his ability, and in proportion to the produce of
the year, consecrated a gift to God of the harvested fruits. In order
that they might be more ready and cheerful in their liberality, God’s
blessing is set before them, as if Moses had commanded the people to
testify their gratitude; since whatever springs from the earth, is the
mere bounty of God Himself.

<span id="v.v.iv-p38"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p38.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p39"></span>**11.** *And thou shalt require.* On
another ground he exhorts and excites them to willingness, because the
service of God brings this rejoicing; for there is nothing which ought
more to stimulate us to obedience, that when we know that God rather
consults our good than seeks to obtain any advantage from us. Ungodly
men, indeed, rejoice also, nay, they are wanton and intemperate in their
joy; but since that joy is not only transient, but their laughter is
turned into weeping and gnashing of teeth, it is not without cause that
Moses here magnifies it as a peculiar blessing, to rejoice before God;
as if a father should invite his children to delight themselves together
with him. But by this external exercise, believers were reminded that
there is no real or desirable joy, unless in reference to God. And
surely, however the wicked may exult in their pleasures, and abandon
themselves to gratifcations, still, since tranquillity of conscience,
which alone brings true rejoicing, is wanting to them, they do not enjoy
the merriment into which they plunge themselves. Finally, Moses
amplifies by a comparison the good which they enjoyed in the service of
God, when he says, “And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in
Egypt;” for that their present condition might be more pleasant to them,
he heightened its sweetness by the recollection of their most miserable
captivity. I have here neglected Cicero’s  <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) very subtle distinction between the
words *gaudium* and *laetitia,* for unless I take both of them in a good
sense, I could not translate the Hebrew words, whereby God would express
how indulgently He deals with His children. Meanwhile, this passage
contains an exhortation to render thanks to God our deliverer.

<span id="v.v.iv-p41"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p41.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p42"></span>**13.** *Thou shalt observe the feast of
tabernacles.* Its first day was called the day of In-gathering, (<span
id="v.v.iv-p42.1"></span>*collectionum*,) because the produce of the
whole year was then stored in their granaries  <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md) and provision cellars. Since,
therefore, they then rested from their rural labors, it was a convenient
time of year for the celebration of the festivals; for in order that
they might more willingly go up to Jerusalem, it was arranged by God,
that it should be done with but little expense and sacrifice of their
domestic interests. Where our translation is, “When Jehovah shall have
blessed thee,” it stands literally, “Because he shall bless thee,”
 <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) but the sense is nearly the
same; for Moses assures them that, provided they devote their minds
diligently and faithfully to the service of God, they shall never want
grounds for rejoicing, since He will never interrupt the flow of His
blessing. The end, therefore, of the fifteenth verse, is not a mere
command, but also a promise; as if he had said, that, if they were not
ungrateful, there was no fear but that God would continually supply new
cause for gladness; and these two clauses are to be taken in connection,
“God will bless thee, and, therefore, thou shalt only rejoice;” for in
this passage I willingly interpret thus  <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) the particle <span
id="v.v.iv-p46.2"></span>אך, *ak.* It is indeed absurd to take it
*adversatively.* It will not, therefore, be improper to explain it
*exclusively,* as if he said, that, there should be no sorrow or
anxiety, which should hinder them from the performance of their pious
duty; those who render it “*surely,”* approach also to this meaning.

<span id="v.v.iv-p47"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p47.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p48"></span>**16.** *Three times in a year.* We have
previously said that although the other feast-days were not to be
neglected, still, because God would make some allowance for the
infirmity of His people, the necessity of going up to Jerusalem five
times a year was not imposed upon them. Again, because only half of the
seventh month contained three feast-days, i.e., from the first to the
fifteenth, for the same reason it is only required of the males that
they should leave their houses and celebrate the sacred convocations;
for thus the females are spared, to whom traveling is not so convenient.
Besides, through the fecundity promised them by God, they were almost
always either pregnant or nursing. It is also certain that the boys and
young men were excepted under the age of twenty, since God includes
under the term males only those who were comprised in the census. If any
object that in God’s spiritual worship there is no difference between
males and females; the reply is easy, that the fathers of families
presented themselves there in the names of their wives and children: so
that the profession was extended to the other sex, and to those of
tender age. To this David seems to allude, when he says:  <span
id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md)

<span id="v.v.iv-p50"></span>"Thy people shall come with voluntary
offerings in the day of thy assembly, in the beauties of holiness,”
(<span id="v.v.iv-p50.1"></span>[Ps
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003)<span id="v.v.iv-p50.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="v.v.iv-p51"></span>for, speaking of the free-will-offerings of
the people, he seeks an example of it, after the manner of the prophets,
from the legal worship. Lest the Jews should object that there was
danger of hostile invasion, if the land should be stripped of its
defenses by the gathering together of all the men into one place, God
anticipates this doubt in <span id="v.v.iv-p51.1"></span>[Exodus
34](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#000.md)<span id="v.v.iv-p51.1"></span>,
promising that He will provide that no one shall desire to assail their
forsaken homes; for to this the sentence refers: “*I will cast out the
nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders, so that no man shall
desire thy land*,” <span id="v.v.iv-p51.2"></span>[Ex
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#024.md)<span id="v.v.iv-p51.2"></span>
Whence also we gather, that God’s worship was not entirely established
until all the neighboring nations were subdued, and He had placed His
sanctuary in Mount Zion. Not that it was allowable for the people to
omit the feast-days before that time; but that experience itself might
teach them that God was wroth with them, whilst He deprived them of this
special blessing; for fear and alarm arose only from their own fault.
But let believers collect from hence the useful doctrine that, whenever
they are following God, they will be safe under His protection, since it
is in His power to repel the assaults of enemies, and everything that
can harm them.

<span id="v.v.iv-p52"></span>*And they shall not appear before the Lord
empty,*  <span id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) I know not how it could
have entered the minds of some to suppose that God here promised that
all should be rich who should present themselves three times (a year)
before His sanctuary: whereas it is plain from the words of Moses that
He requires from every one some gift in token of their gratitude. And
perhaps  <span id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) what historians relate
respecting the Persians, that none should dare to address the king
without a gift, was a more ancient custom, and common to other nations.
God would indeed have a gift presented Him by each individual, as a
symbol or earnest of their subjection; and, although this legal rite has
ceased, yet its substance is to be retained, viz., that those only are
true servants of God who do not boastfully make a mere empty profession,
but effectually testify that they acknowledge Him as their King.
