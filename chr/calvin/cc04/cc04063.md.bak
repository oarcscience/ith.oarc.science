<span id="iii.iii.xx-p3"></span>**1.** And thou shalt make an altar to
burn incense upon: *of* shittim wood shalt thou make it.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p4"></span>**1.** Facies et altare suffimenti
suffitus, ex lignis Sittim facies illud.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p5"></span>**2.** A cubit *shall be* the length
thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; four-square shall it be: and
two cubits *shall be* the height thereof; the horns thereof *shall be*
of the same.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p6"></span>**2.** Cubitus longitudo ejus, et
cubitus latitudo ejus, quadratum erit: et duo cubiti altitudo ejus: ex
ipso cornua ejus.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p7"></span>**3.** And thou shalt overlay it with
pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the
horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p8"></span>**3.** Teges illud auto puro, tectum
ejus vel parietes ejus per circuitum, et cornua ejus: faciesque ei
coronam auream per circuitum.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p9"></span>**4.** And two golden rings shalt thou
make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the
two sides of it shalt thou make *it*; and they shall be for places for
the staves to bear it withal.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p10"></span>**4.** Duos etiam annulos aureos facies
ei infra coronam ejus, in duobus angulis ejus, in utroque latere ejus:
et per illos trajicientur vectes ad illud cum ipsis portandum.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p11"></span>**5.** And thou shalt make the staves
*of* shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p12"></span>**5.** Facies autem vectes illos ex

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p13"></span>**6.** And thou shalt put it before the
vail that *is* by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that
*is* over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p14"></span>**6.** Et pones illud ante velum, quod
erit juxta aream testimonii, ante propitiatorium, quod erit super
testimonium, ubi conveniam tecum.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p15"></span>**7.** And Aaron shall burn thereon
sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn
incense upon it.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p16"></span>**7.** Et adolebit super illud Aharon

illum.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p17"></span>**8.** And when Aaron lighteth the
lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before
the LORD throughout your generations.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p18"></span>**8.** Et quando accendet Aharon
lucernas inter duas vesperas, adolebit suffitum illum jugiter coram
Jehova in generationibus vestris.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p19"></span>**9.** Ye shall offer no strange
incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall
ye pour drink offering thereon.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p20"></span>**9.** Non offeretis super illud
suffitum alium, neque holocaustum, neque minha: sed nec libamen
libabitis super illud.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p21"></span>**10.** And Aaron shall make an
atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin
offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it
throughout your generations: it *is* most holy unto the LORD.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p22"></span>**10.** Et expiabit Aharon super cornua
ejus semel in anno sanguine oblationis pro peccato expiationum: semel in
anno expiabit super illud in generationibus vestris. Sanctitas
sanctitatum est Jehovae.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p23"></span> 

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p24"></span><span id="iii.iii.xx-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p25"></span>**1.** *And thou shalt make an altar.*
God now issues His commands respecting the altar of burnt incense,
whereby the people were assured that the odor of the worship under the
Law was sweet to Him. This ceremony indeed also prevailed among the
Gentiles; whence there is frequent mention made by heathen authors of
incense-burning; but what its object was they knew not themselves, nor
did they care to reflect upon its proper intention, since they conceived
themselves to have done all that was required of them, by the bare sign
itself. In this way, however, God would encourage His believing people,
by giving them to know that the worship which they offered at this
command sent up to him a sweet savor. Meanwhile He admonished them
diligently to beware lest any uncleanness should profane their
sacrifices, but that they should come cleansed and pure into His sight.
And David applies this type specially to prayer, when he says:

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p26"></span>"Let my prayer be set forth before thee
as incense.”  
(<span id="iii.iii.xx-p26.2"></span>[Ps
131:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xx-p26.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p27"></span>Therefore, as the other altar of which
we have been hearing, was devoted to the victims for the purpose of
propitiating God, so also this altar perfumed the sacrifices with the
odor of its incense, that they might be acceptable to God. Hence it was
placed near the ark of the testimony, though with the vail between, that
its savor might ascend directly to God without any let or hindrance.
There is no ambiguity in the words, except that some think there is a
repetition where it is said, “every morning,” and “between the two
evens;”  <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) others suppose that
there are two separate oblations, and this latter view is the more
probable, *i.e.,* that the incense was offered morning and evening. He
afterwards forbids either the altar itself to be transferred to other
uses, or any other kind of incense to be burnt upon it; of this he will
speak elsewhere.

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p29"></span><span id="iii.iii.xx-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.xx-p30"></span>**10.** *And Aaron shall make an
atonement.* We should observe here the correspondence between the two
altars; for, as the Israelites were admonished that the sacrifices would
not please God, unless all uncleanness were wiped away by pure and holy
prayers, so also the altar of incense was purified by the sprinkling of
blood, that they might learn that their prayers obtained acceptance
through sacrifices. Although this was only done once a year, yet it was
daily to be called to mind, in order that they might offer the death of
Christ by faith and prayer,  <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) and
yet might know that their prayers had no sweet savor, unless in so far
as they were sprinkled with the blood of atonement.
