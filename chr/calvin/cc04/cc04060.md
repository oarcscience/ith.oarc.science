<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p3"></span>**1.** And thou shalt make an altar
ofshittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall
be foursquare: and the height thereof *shall be* three cubits.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p4"></span>**1.** Facies etiam altare e lignis
sittim: quinque cubitorum exit longitudo: et quinque cubitorum latitudo:
quadrature erit altare: et trium cubitorum altitudo ejus.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p5"></span>**2.** And thou shalt make the horns
of it upon the four corners thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and
thou shalt overlay it with brass.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p6"></span>**2.** Huic facies cornua in quatuor
angulis ejus: ex ipso erunt cornua ejus, tegesque illud aere.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p7"></span>**3.** And thou shalt make his pans to
receive his ashes, and his shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks,
and his firepans: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make *of* brass.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p8"></span>**3.** Facies deinde lebetes ejus: ad
repurgandum cinerem ejus, et scopas (*vel, forcipes*) ejus, et crateras
ejus, et fuscinulas ejus, et receptacula ejus: omnia vasa ejus facies ex
aere.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p9"></span>**4.** And thou shalt make for it a
grate of network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen
rings in the four corners thereof.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p10"></span>**4.** Facies etiam illi craticulam
opere craticulato aeream, et ad rete quatuor annulos, in quatuor
extremitatibus ejus.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p11"></span>**5.** And thou shalt put it under
the compass of the altar beneath, that the net may be even to the midst
of the altar.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p12"></span>**5.** Ponesque illud sub ambitu
altaris inferne, et erit rete illud usque ad medium altaris.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p13"></span>**6.** And thou shalt make staves for
the altar, staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with brass.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p14"></span>**6.** Facies praeterea vectes alta

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p15"></span>**7.** And the staves shall be put
into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar,
to bear it.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p16"></span>**7.** Et inserentur vectes ejus in
illos annulos: et erunt vectes in utroque latere altaris, dum portabitur
illud.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p17"></span>**8.** Hollow with boards shalt thou
make it: as it was shewed thee in the mount, so shall they make *it.*

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p18"></span>**8.** Cavum tabulis facies illud:
quemadmodum ostendi tibi in monte, sic facient.

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p19"></span> 

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p20"></span><span id="iii.iii.xvii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.xvii-p21"></span>**1.** *And thou shalt make an
altar.* The altar of whole burnt-offerings (*holocaustorum*) is here
described, which, however, it was called by *synecdoche,* for not only
entire victims were burnt there, but also parts of them only, as we
shall see in Leviticus. The burnt-offerings received their name from
their *ascending,*  <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146) whereby the
Israelites were reminded that they had need to be purified, that they
might ascend to God; and at the same time were instructed that whatever
corruption there might be in the flesh did not prevent the sacrifices
from being acceptable and of a sweet savor to God. It is clear that from
the first beginning of the human race there were burnt-sacrifices,
suggested by the secret inspiration of God’s Spirit, since there was no
written Law; nor can we doubt but that by this symbol they were taught
that the flesh must be burnt by the Spirit, in order that men may duly
offer themselves to God; and thus they acknowledged, under this type,
that the flesh of Christ must receive this from the divine power, so as
to become a perfect victim for the propitiation of God; thus, as the
Apostle testifies, he offered himself through the Spirit. (<span
id="iii.iii.xvii-p22.2"></span>[Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014)<span
id="iii.iii.xvii-p22.2"></span>.) But fuller mention of this subject
will be made elsewhere. The altar was so constructed that the sacrifices
might be cast upon a grate placed within it, and thus they were covered
by its external surface. The ashes were received into a pan, so that
they should not fall about upon the ground and be trodden under foot,
but that reverence might be inculcated even towards the very remnants of
their holy things.  <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147) That the
victims were bound to the four horns, which stood out from the four
corners, is plain from the words of <span
id="iii.iii.xvii-p23.2"></span>[Ps
118:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#027)<span
id="iii.iii.xvii-p23.2"></span>, “Bind the sacrifice with cords, even
unto the horns of the altar.” And this also is the beginning of a proper
offering of spiritual sacrifices, that all the lusts of the flesh should
be subdued, and held captive as it were unto the obedience of God.
Wherefore even Christ, although in Him there was nothing which was not
duly regulated, was nevertheless bound, in order to prove His obedience;
as He had said, “Not as I will, but as thou wilt.” (<span
id="iii.iii.xvii-p23.3"></span>[Mt
26:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039)<span
id="iii.iii.xvii-p23.3"></span>.) The altar was carried on staves, to
obviate the necessity of having more than one; else there would have
been danger of their being compelled, by the very difficulty of carrying
it, to leave it behind after it was made, if they were setting about a
long journey; and this would have been the seed or ground of
superstition, whilst no other could be built which was not spurious.
