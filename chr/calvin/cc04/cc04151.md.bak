*Remember the Sabbath-day.* The object of this Commandment is that
believers should exercise themselves in the worship of God; for we know
how prone men are to fall into indifference, unless they have some props
to lean on or some stimulants to arouse them in maintaining their care
and zeal for religion. Under the Second Commandment we have already
indeed made some remarks on the outward profession of piety, and under
the First also brief mention has been made of some festivals, inasmuch
as in the passover and the offering of the first-fruits the people
devoted themselves to God, as if by a solemn repetition of the covenant.
Many also of the ceremonies which we have explained had an affinity to
the Sabbath. Yet it is not without good cause that God has appointed a
special place to the Sabbath as well as to the other festivals; and
although there is a connection between the observance of the Sabbath and
the tabernacle with its sacrifices, and the priesthood itself, still it
was advisedly done that the festivals should be separately appointed,
that by their aid the people might be the more encouraged to maintain
the unity of the faith and to preserve the harmony of the Church.
Meanwhile, the mutual connection between the sanctuary and the Sabbath
is evident from what has been already said. God indeed would have it to
be a notable symbol of distinction between the Jews and heathen nations.
Whence, too, the devil, in order to asperse pure and holy religion with
infamy, has often traduced the Jewish Sabbath through froward tongues.
But the better to shew what there is peculiar in this Commandment, and
what is its difference from the First, we must remember the spiritual
substance of the type; for not only did God prescribe certain days for
the holding of assemblies, in which the people might give attention to
sacrifices, prayers, and the celebration of His praise; but He placed
before their eyes as the perfection of sanctity that they should all
cease from their works. Surely God has no delight in idleness and sloth,
and therefore there was no importance in the simple cessation of the
labors of their hands and feet; nay, it would have been a childish
superstition to rest with no other view than to occupy their repose in
the service of God.  <span id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md) Wherefore,
lest we should make any mistake in the meaning of this Commandment, it
is well to remember its analogy and conformity with the thing it
signifies; *i.e.,* that the Jews might know that their lives could not
be approved by God unless, by ceasing from their own works, they should
divest themselves of their reason, counsels, and all the feelings and
affections of the flesh. For they were not forbidden without exception
from the performance of every work, since they were required both to
circumcise their children, and to bring the victims into the court, and
to offer them in sacrifice on that day; but they were only called away
from their own works, that, as if dead to themselves and to the world,
they might wholly devote themselves to God. Wherefore, since God
declares elsewhere by Moses, and again by Ezekiel, that the Sabbath is a
sign between Him and the Jews that He sanctifies them, (<span
id="v.ii.i-p14.2"></span>[Eze
31:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze031.htm#013.md)<span id="v.ii.i-p14.2"></span>;
<span id="v.ii.i-p14.3"></span>[Eze
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#012)<span id="v.ii.i-p14.3"></span>,.md)
we must see what is the sum of this sanctification, viz., the death of
the flesh, when men deny themselves and renounce their earthly nature,
so that they may be ruled and guided by the Spirit of God.

<span id="v.ii.i-p15"></span>Although this is sufficiently plain, still
it will be worth while to confirm it by further statements. And first of
all, that this was a ceremonial precept, Paul clearly teaches, calling
it a shadow of these things, the body of which is only Christ. (<span
id="v.ii.i-p15.1"></span>[Col
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#017)<span id="v.ii.i-p15.1"></span>..md)
But if the outward rest was nothing but a ceremony, the substance of
which must be sought in Christ, it now remains to be considered how
Christ actually exhibited what was then prefigured; and this the same
Apostle declares, when he states that “our old man is crucified with
Christ,” and that we are buried with Him, that His resurrection may be
to us newness of life. (<span id="v.ii.i-p15.2"></span>[Ro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)<span id="v.ii.i-p15.2"></span>..md)
It is to be gathered without doubt from many passages, that the keeping
of the Sabbath was a serious matter, since God inculcates no other
commandment more frequently, nor more strictly requires obedience to
any; and again, when He complains that He is despised, and that the Jews
have fallen into extreme ungodliness, He simply says that His “Sabbaths
are polluted,” as if religion principally consisted in their observance.
(<span id="v.ii.i-p15.3"></span>[Jer
17:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#024.md)<span id="v.ii.i-p15.3"></span>;
<span id="v.ii.i-p15.4"></span>[Ezek.
20:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#021.md), [Ezek.
22:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#008.md), [Ezek.
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#038)<span id="v.ii.i-p15.4"></span>..md)
Moreover, if there had not been some peculiar excellency in the Sabbath,
 <span id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329.md) it might have appeared to be an
act of atrocious injustice to command a man to be put to death for
cutting wood upon it. (<span id="v.ii.i-p16.2"></span>[Nu
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/num015.htm#032)<span id="v.ii.i-p16.2"></span>..md)
Wherefore it must be concluded that the substance of the Sabbath, which
Paul declares to be in Christ, must have been no ordinary good thing.
Nor does its excellency require much eulogium, since spiritual rest is
nothing else than the truly desirable and blessed death of man, which
contains in it the life of God, even as Paul glories that he is as it
were dead, because Christ liveth in him. (<span
id="v.ii.i-p16.3"></span>[Ga 2:20](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020.md)<span
id="v.ii.i-p16.3"></span>.) The Apostle in the epistle to the Hebrews
argues more subtilely, that true rest is brought to us by the Gospel,
and that it is rejected by unbelievers, (<span
id="v.ii.i-p16.4"></span>[Heb 4:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#003.md)<span
id="v.ii.i-p16.4"></span>;) for although he mixes up some allegorical
matter with it, he still retains the genuine reason of the Commandment,
viz., that we should rest from our works “even as God from His.” (<span
id="v.ii.i-p16.5"></span>[Heb
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#010)<span id="v.ii.i-p16.5"></span>..md)
On this ground Isaiah, when he reproves the hypocrites for insisting
only on the external ceremony of rest, accuses them of “finding their
own pleasure” on the Sabbath, (<span id="v.ii.i-p16.6"></span>[Isa
58:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#013)<span id="v.ii.i-p16.6"></span>;.md)
as much as to say, that the legitimate use of the Sabbath must be
supposed to be self-renunciation, since he is in fact accounted to cease
from his works who is not led by his own will nor indulges his own
wishes, but who suffers himself to be directed by the Spirit of God. And
this emptying out of self must proceed so far that the Sabbath is
violated even by good works, so long as we regard them as our own; for
rightly does Augustin remark in the last chapter of the 22d book, *De
Civitate Dei,*  <span id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330.md) — *“*For even
our good works themselves, since they are understood to be rather His
than ours, are thus imputed to us for the attaining of that Sabbath,
when we *are still and see that He is God;*  <span
id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md) for, if we attribute them to
ourselves, they will be servile, whereas we are told as to the Sabbath,
*Thou shalt not do any servile work in it."*

<span id="v.ii.i-p19"></span>Next it is asked, why God rather assigned
every *seventh day* to the Sabbath rather than the *sixth* or *tenth.*
Because the number seven often represents perfection in Scripture, some
have thought that believers were thus reminded that they must strive
after perfect holiness with all their might, and not devote themselves
to God by halves only. Others elicit a different meaning from it,
although not a contrary one, that believers were taught that although
they might be sanctified and laboring in all sincerity to cease from
their own life, still some remainders of the flesh would continue in
them, and therefore that through the whole course of their life they
must aspire to that holiness which no mortal attains. I do not, however,
doubt but that God created the world in six days and rested on the
seventh, that He might give a manifestation of the perfect excellency of
His works, and thus, proposing Himself as the model for our imitation,
He signifies that He calls His own people to the true goal of felicity.
Although a promise is included in this Commandment, yet will we observe
upon it separately, and as if by the way. He promises indeed that as He
blessed the seventh day and set it apart, so He will bless believers to
sanctify them. But the main point is the command, and the recital of the
blessing is equivalent to an exhortation to obedience, since otherwise
it would be inappropriately placed here amongst the Commandments of the
Law. When I said that the ordinance of rest was a type of a spiritual
and far higher mystery, and hence that this Commandment must be
accounted ceremonial, I must not be supposed to mean that it had no
other different objects also. And certainly God took the seventh day for
His own and hallowed it, when the creation of the world was finished,
that He might keep His servants altogether free from every care, for the
consideration of the beauty, excellence, and fitness of His works. There
is indeed no moment which should be allowed to pass in which we are not
attentive to the consideration of the wisdom, power, goodness, and
justice of God in His admirable creation and government of the world;
but, since our minds are fickle, and apt therefore to be forgetful or
distracted, God, in His indulgence providing against our infirmities,
separates one day from the rest, and commands that it should be free
from all earthly business and cares, so that nothing may stand in the
way of that holy occupation. On this ground He did not merely wish that
people should rest at home, but that they should meet in the sanctuary,
there to engage themselves in prayer and sacrifices, and to make
progress in religious knowledge through the interpretation of the Law.
In this respect we have an equal necessity for the Sabbath with the
ancient people, so that on one day we may be free, and thus the better
prepared to learn and to testify our faith. A third object of the
Sabbath is also stated by Moses, but an accidental one as it were, viz.,
that it may be a day of relaxation for servants. Since this pertains to
the rule of charity, it has not properly any place in the First Table,
and is therefore added by Moses as an extrinsic advantage, as will be
seen a little further on.

<span id="v.ii.i-p20"></span>**8.** *Remember the Sabbath-day.* The word
*keep* is used in Deuteronomy with the same meaning. Hence we infer that
it is no trifling matter here in question, since God enforces the
sanctity of the Sabbath by these two words, and exhorts the Jews to its
scrupulous observance, thus condemning carelessness about it as a
transgression. Moreover, when He says, “Six days shalt thou labor,” He
indirectly reproves their ingratitude, if it should be irksome and
disagreeable to them, to devote one day out of the seven to God, when He
in His generosity gives up six to themselves. For he does not, as some
have foolishly thought, make a demand here for six days’ labor; but by
His very kindness entices them to obedience, since He only claims a
seventh part (of their time) for Himself — as if He had said, Since you
cannot be instant in seeking me with all your affection and attention,
at any rate give up to me some little undistracted time. Therefore, He
says, “all thy work,” whereby He signifies that they have plenty of
time, exclusive of the Sabbath, for all their business.

<span id="v.ii.i-p21"></span><span id="v.ii.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.i-p22"></span>**10.** *Thou shalt not do any work.* That
is, whatever could have been finished yesterday, or postponed till
to-morrow. (For instance,  <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332) .md) it
was not lawful for judges to give a hearing to two litigants; but if any
one had violently assaulted his neighbor, it was allowable to prevent
the injury, and to give relief to the unoffending person; because the
necessity of the case admitted of no delay. It was not lawful to cook
food for your guests; but if an ox or an ass had fallen into a pit it
was to be taken out, because aid would have been too late on the morrow.
For this reason Christ. declares that “the Sabbath was made for man, and
not man for the Sabbath,” (<span id="v.ii.i-p23.1"></span>[Mr
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/mar002.htm#027)<span id="v.ii.i-p23.1"></span>,.md)
since God does not require more than was useful or necessary for keeping
the people in the exercise of piety. Thus it would have been wicked to
send out an ox to pasture; but if an ox that tossed had got out, it was
right to bring it back to its stall, lest it should kill or injure those
whom it met.

<span id="v.ii.i-p24"></span>*Thy man-servant and thy maid-servant.*
Although it is added in Deuteronomy that God had respect to equity, when
He commands a relaxation from labor to be given to the men and
maid-servants, and the Israelites are called upon to remember that they
were once servants, that they may be more disposed to act humanely,
still we must bear in mind what I have stated, that the direct object
here was the honoring of the One God. We know that the whole race of
Abraham were consecrated to God, and that their servants were a kind of
adjunct to them, so that they were circumcised in common with
themselves. And assuredly it is very absurd that a man should encourage
a profane contempt of God in the family over which he presides, and in
which he would be recognised as master. The case of “strangers” was
different, who were obliged to rest on the Sabbath, although they
remained uncircumcised; for he does not only refer to the foreigners,
who had subscribed to the Law, but also to the uncircumcised. If any
should object that they were improperly made partakers of the sacred
sign whereby God had bound His elect people to Himself, the reply is
easy, that this was not done for their sakes, but lest anything opposed
to the Sabbath should happen beneath the eyes of the Israelites; as we
may understand more clearly from the case of the oxen and asses. Surely
God would never have required spiritual service of brute animals; yet He
ordained their repose as a lesson, so that wherever the Israelites
turned their eyes, they might be incited to the observation of the
Sabbath. Nor can we wonder at this, when in the general mournings which
were appointed for the deprecation of God’s wrath, a fast was imposed
upon the brutes, that wretched men being admonished by the sight, might
feel the burden of their guilt the more, and by their voluntary
serf-accusation might prevent the judgment of God, and might be
seriously dissatisfied with themselves on account of those sins, whose
punishment they saw to be imposed to a certain degree upon innocent
animals. Besides, if the very least liberty had been conceded to them,
they would have done many things to evade the Law in their days of rest,
by employing strangers and the cattle in their work.

<span id="v.ii.i-p25"></span><span id="v.ii.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.i-p26"></span>**11.** *For in six days the Lord made.*
From this passage it may be probably conjectured that the hallowing of
the Sabbath was prior to the Law; and undoubtedly what Moses has before
narrated, that they were forbidden to gather the manna on the seventh
day, seems to have had its origin from a well-known and received custom;
whilst it is not credible that the Observance of the Sabbath was
omitted, when God revealed the rite of sacrifice to the holy (Fathers.
 <span id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333) .md) But what in the depravity of
human nature was altogether extinct among heathen nations, and almost
obsolete with the race of Abraham, God renewed in His Law: that the
Sabbath should be honored by holy and inviolable observance; and this
the impure dogs  <span id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) accounted to be
amongst the disgraces of the Jewish nation.
