<span id="ii.i.iii-p2"></span><span id="ii.i.iii-p2.1"></span>[Leviticus

id="ii.i.iii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i.iii-p3"></span>**1.** And the Lord spake untoMoses and
Aaron, saying,

<span id="ii.i.iii-p4"></span>**1.** Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen et
Aharon, dicendo:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p5"></span>**2.** When a man shall have in the skin
of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of
his flesh *like* the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto
Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p6"></span>**2.** Homo quum fuerit in cute carnis
ejus tumor, vel scabies, vel alba macula, et in cute carnis ejus fuerit
plaga leprae, ducetur ad Aharon sacerdotem, vel ad unum e filiis ejus
sacerdotibus.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p7"></span>**3.** And the priest shall look on the
plague in the skin of the flesh: and *when* the hair in the plague is
turned white, and the plague in sight *be* deeper than the skin of his
flesh, it *is* a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him,
and pronounce him unclean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p8"></span>**3.** Tune videbit sacerdos plagam in
cute carnis: quod si pilus in plaga versus fuerit in albedinem, et
superficies plagae profundior fuerit cute carnis ejus, plaga leprae est,
et postquam viderit eum sacerdos judicabit illum contaminatum, (*vel,*
contaminabit illum.)

<span id="ii.i.iii-p9"></span>**4.** If the bright spot *be* white in
the skin of his flesh, and in sight *be* not deeper than the skin, and
the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up *him
that hath* the plague seven days:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p10"></span>**4.** Quod si macula alba fuerit in cute
carnis ejus, et profundior non fuerit aspectus ejus cute, nec pilus ejus
versus fuerit in albedinem, includet sacerdos plagam septem diebus.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p11"></span>**5.** And the priest shall look on him
the seventh day: and, behold, *if* the plague in his sight be at a stay,
*and* the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him
up seven days more:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p12"></span>**5.** Posted videbit eum sacerdos die
septimo et si plaga fuerit aequalis coram oculis ejus, nee creverit
plaga in cute, includet eum sacerdos septem diebus secundo.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p13"></span>**6.** And the priest shall look on him
again the seventh day: and, behold,*if* the plague *be* somewhat dark,
*and* the prague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him
clean: it *is but* a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p14"></span>**6.** Tune inspiciet sacerdos ipsum die
septimo itcrum, et si subnigra futerit plaga, (*vel,* obscurius
contracta,) nec creverit plaga in cute, tune mundum declarabit (*vel,*
mundabit) eum sacerdos: scabies est: et lavabit vir vestimenta sua, et
mundus erit.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p15"></span>**7.** But if the scab spread much abroad
in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his
cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p16"></span>**7.** Quod si crescendo creverit scabies
in cute postquam ostensus fuerit sacerdoti in purgatione ejus,
inspi-cietur secundo a sacerdote.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p17"></span>**8.** And *if* the priest see that,
behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce
him unclean: it *is* a leprosy.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p18"></span>**8.** Ubi autem viderit sacerdos;
crescere scabiem in cute, immundum judicabit cum sacerdos, lepra est
judicabit cum sacerdos, lepra est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p19"></span>**9.** When the plague of leprosy is in a
man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p20"></span>**9.** Quoties plaga lepre fuerit in
homine adducetur ad sacerdotem;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p21"></span>**10.** And the priest shall see *him:*
and, behold, *if* the rising *be* white in the skin, and it have turned
the hair white, and *there be* quick raw flesh in the rising;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p22"></span>**10.** Et aspiciet sacerdos, et si tumor
albus fuerit in cute, et mutaverit pilum in albedinem, et ailmentum
carnis vivae in tumore,

<span id="ii.i.iii-p23"></span>**11.** It *is* an old leprosy in the
skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall
not shut him up: for he *is* unclean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p24"></span>**11.** Lepra inveterate, est in cute
carnis ejus: ideoque contaminabit eum sacerdos, quia immundus est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p25"></span>**12.** And if a leprosy break out abroad
in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of *him that hath* the
plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p26"></span>**12.** Sin germinando germinaverit lepra
in cute, et operuerit lepra totam cutem plagae, a capite ejus, et totum
aspectuum oculorum sacerdotis:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p27"></span>**13.** Then the priest shall consider:
and, behold, *if* the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall
pronounce *him* clean *that hath* the plague: it is all turned white: he
*is* clean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p28"></span>**13.** Tunc inspiciet sacerdos, et si
operuerit lepra totam carnem ejus, tunc mundam judicabit plagam: ubi
tota versa est in albedinem, munda est, (*vel,* mundus.)

<span id="ii.i.iii-p29"></span>**14.** But when raw flesh appeareth in
him, he shall be unclean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p30"></span>**14.** Quo autem die visa fuerit in co
cato viva, immundus erit.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p31"></span>**15.** And the priest shall see the raw
flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: *for* the raw flesh *is*
unclean: it *is* a leprosy.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p32"></span>**15.** Et ubi viderit sacerdos carnem
vivam, immundum judicabit ipsum, caro viva immunda *est,* lepra est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p33"></span>**16.** Or if the raw flesh turn again,
and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p34"></span>**16.** Vel si reversa fuerit caro viva,
et conversa in albedinem, tunc veniet ad sacerdotem:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p35"></span>**17.** And the priest shall see him:
and, behold, *if* the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall
pronounce *him* clean *that hath* the plague: he *is* clean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p36"></span>**17.** Et inspiciet sacerdos: et si
versa fuerit plaga in albedinem, mundam judicabit sacerdos plagam illam:
munda est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p37"></span>**18.** The flesh also, in which, *even*
in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,

<span id="ii.i.iii-p38"></span>**18.** Et si fuerit in cute carnis
alicujus ulcus, (*vel,* pustula ardens,) et illud sanatum fuerit.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p39"></span>**19.** And in the place of the boil
there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish,
and it be shewed to the priest;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p40"></span>**19.** Et extiterit in loeo ulceris
tumor albus, aut macula alba subrufa, ostendetur sacerdoti:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p41"></span>**20.** And if, when the priest seeth it,
behold, it *be* in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be
turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it *is* a plague
of leprosy broken out of the boil.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p42"></span>**20.** Et quum inspexerit sacerdos, si
pilus profundior fuerit cute, et pilus conversus fuerit in albedinem,
contaminabit eum sacerdos: quia plaga leprae est ex ulcere germinans.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p43"></span>**21.** But if the priest look on it,
and, behold, *there be* no white hairs therein, and *if* it *be* not
lower than the skin, but *be* somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut
him up seven days:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p44"></span>**21.** Et si viderit cam sacerdos, et
non fuerit in ea pilus albus, nec fuerit profundior cute, sed fuerit
subobscura, tunc includet eum sacerdos septem diebus.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p45"></span>**22.** And if it spread much abroad in
the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it *is a* plague.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p46"></span>**22.** Si vero crescendo creverit per
cutem, immundum judicabit eum sacerdos: plaga est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p47"></span>**23.** But if the bright spot stay in
his place, *and* spread not, it *is* a burning boil; and the priest
shall pronounce him clean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p48"></span>**23.** Si vero suo loco constiterit
macula alba, nec ereverit, adustio ulceris est: mundum (*vel,* mundam)
judicabit eum sacerdos.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p49"></span>**24.** Or if there be *any* flesh, in
the skin whereof *there is* a hot burning, and the quick *flesh* that
burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p50"></span>**24.** Quum fuerit caro in cujus cute
erit adustio ignis, et in viva carne adustionis macula alba subrufa, vel
alba.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p51"></span>**25.** Then the priest shall look upon
it: and, behold, *if* the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and
it *be in* sight deeper than the skin, it *is* a leprosy broken out of
the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it *is*
the plague of leprosy.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p52"></span>**25.** Inspiciet eum sacerdos: et, si
versus fuerit pilus in albedinem in macula illa, et superficies ejus
fuerit profundior cute, lepra est in adustione germinans: ideo immundam
judicabit eam sacerdos, plaga leprae est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p53"></span>**26.** But if the priest look on it,
and, behold, *there be* no white hair in the bright spot, and it *be* no
lower than the *other* skin, but *be* somewhat dark; then the priest
shall shut him up seven days:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p54"></span>**26.** Quod si inspexerit eam sacerdos,
et non fuerit in macula pilus albus, nec profundior cute, sed fuerit
subnigra, includet eum sacerdos septem diebus.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p55"></span>**27.** And the priest shall look upon
him the seventh day: *and* if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then
the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it *is* the plague of leprosy.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p56"></span>**27.** Postea inspiciet eum sacerdos die
septimo: et si crescendo creverit in cute, immundam judicabit eam
sacerdos, plaga leprae est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p57"></span>**28.** And if the bright spot stay in
his place, *and* spread not in the skin, but it *be* somewhat dark; it
*is a* rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean:
for it *is* an inflammation of the burning.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p58"></span>**28.** Quod si in loco suo steterit
macula, nec creverit per cutem, et eadem fuerit contracta, (*vel,*
subnigra,) tumor adustionis est: ideoque mundum judicabit eum sacerdos:
quia ardor exustionis est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p59"></span>**29.** If a man or woman have a plague
upon the head or the beard;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p60"></span>**29.** Si viro aut mulieri exorta fuerit
plga in capite, aut in barba.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p61"></span>**30.** Then the priest shall see the
plague: and, behold, if it *be* in sight deeper than the skin; *and
there be* in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him
unclean: it *is* a dry scall, *even* a leprosy upon the head or beard.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p62"></span>**30.** Tune inspiciet sacerdos plugam:
et si superficies ejus profundior erit cute, et fuerit in ea pilus
flavus et tenuis, immundum judicabit sa-cerdos: macula nigra est, lepra
capitis aut barbae est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p63"></span>**31.** And if the priest look on the
plague of the scall, and, behold, it *be* not in sight deeper than the
skin, and *that there is* no black hair in it; then the priest shall
shut up *him that hath* the plague of the scall seven days:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p64"></span>**31.** Si autem inspexerit sacerdos
plagam maculae nigrae, et superficies ejus non fuerit profundior cute,
nee pilus niger in ea, includet sacerdos plagam maculae nigrae septem
diebus.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p65"></span>**32.** And in the seventh day the priest
shall look on the plague: and, behold, *if* the scull spread not, and
there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall *be* not in sight deeper
than the skin;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p66"></span>**32.** Et quum inspexerit sacerdos die
septima, si non creverit macula illa nigra, nec in ea fuerit pilus, et
aspectus maculae nigrae non fuerit profundior cute:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p67"></span>**33.** He shall be shaven, but the scall
shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up *him that hath* the
scall seven days more:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p68"></span>**33.** Tune radetur, sed maculam nigram
non radet, includetque sacerdos maeulam nigram septem diebus secundo.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p69"></span>**34.** And in the seventh day the priest
shall look on the scall: and, behold, *if* the scall be not spread in
the skin, nor *be* in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall
pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p70"></span>**34.** Postea, inspiciet sacerdos
maculam nigram die septima: et, si non creverit macula nigra in cute,
nee superfides cjus profundior fuerit cute, mundum judicabit eum
sacerdos: lavabitque vestimenta sua, et mundus erit.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p71"></span>**35.** But if the scall spread much in
the skin after his cleansing;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p72"></span>**35.** Si autem crescendo creverit
macula per cutera post purificationem suam,

<span id="ii.i.iii-p73"></span>**36.** Then the priest shall look on
him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall
not seek for yellow hair; he *is* unclean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p74"></span>**36.** Tune inspiciet cam sacerdos: et,
si creverit macula illa in cute, non requiret ad examen sacerdos pilum
flavum: immundus est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p75"></span>**37.** But if the scall be in his sight
at a stay, and *that* there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is
healed, he *is* clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p76"></span>**37.** Quod si in oculis ejus
constiterit macula, et pilus niger fuerit in ea, sanata est macula illa,
mundus est, et mundum judicabit eum sacer-dos.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p77"></span>**38.** If a man also or a woman have in
the skin of their flesh bright spots, *even* white bright spots;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p78"></span>**38.** Quum in cute *carnis* viri aut
mulieris fuerint maculae, maculm *inquam* albae.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p79"></span>**39.** Then the priest shall look: and,
behold, *if* the bright spots in the skin of their flesh *be* darkish
white; it *is* a freckled spot *that* groweth in the skin; he *is*
clean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p80"></span>**39.** Inspiciet sacerdos, et, si in
cute carnis corum fuerint maculae albae, subnigrae (*vel,* contractae,)
macula alba est quod floret in cute, mundus est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p81"></span>**40.** And the man whose hair is fallen
off his head, he *is* bald; *yet is* he clean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p82"></span>**40.** Vir quum depilatum fuerit caput
ejus, calvus est, mundus est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p83"></span>**41.** And he that hath his hair fallen
off from the part of his head toward his face, he *is* forehead bald:
*yet is* he clean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p84"></span>**41.** Quod si ex parte faciei suae
caput habuerit depilatum, recalvaster est, mundus est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p85"></span>**42.** And if there be in the bald head,
or bald forehead, a white reddish sore, it *is* a leprosy sprung up in
his bald head, or his bald forehead.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p86"></span>**42.** Quod si in calvitio ejus aut
parte depilata fuerit plaga alba, subrufa, lepra germinans est in
calvitie, vel parte ejus depilata.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p87"></span>**43.** Then the priest shall look upon
it: and, behold, *if* the rising of the sore *be* white reddish in his
bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin
of the flesh;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p88"></span>**43.** Aspiciet ergo eum sacerdos: et,
si tumor plagae albus, rufus in calvitio ejus aut parte depilata, sicut
species leprae in cute carnis,

<span id="ii.i.iii-p89"></span>**44.** He is a leprous man, he *is*
unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague *is*
in his head.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p90"></span>**44.** Vir leprosus est, immundus est:
contaminando contaminabit illum sacerdos: in capite ejus est plaga ejus.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p91"></span>**45.** And the leper in whom the plague
*is,* his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a
covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p92"></span>**45.** Leprosi autem in quo fuerit plaga
illa, vestimenta erunt scissa, et caput ejus nudum, et pilum labri
operiet, et Immundus, immundus sum clamabit.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p93"></span>**46.** All the days wherein the plague
*shall be* in him he shall be defiled; he *is* unclean: he shall dwell
alone; without the camp *shall* his habitation *be.*

<span id="ii.i.iii-p94"></span>**46.** Cunctis diebus quibus fuerit
plaga in *eo,* contaminabitur, immudus est: seorsum habitabit: extra
castra mansio ejus erit.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p95"></span>**47.** The garment also that the plague
of leprosy is in, *whether it be* a woollen garment, or a linen garment;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p96"></span>**47.** Si in veste fnerit plaga leprae,
in veste lanea, aut in veste linea,

<span id="ii.i.iii-p97"></span>**48.** Whether *it be* in the warp, or
woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made
of skin;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p98"></span>**48.** Aut in stamine, aut in subtegmine
ex lino, aut ex lana, aut in pelle, aut in quovis opere pelliceo:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p99"></span>**49.** And if the plague be greenish or
reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the
woof, or in any thing of skin; it *is* a plague of leprosy, and shall be
shewed unto the priest:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p100"></span>**49.** Et fuerit plaga illa viridis aut
rufa in veste, aut in stamine, vel in subtegmine, vel in quovis opere
pelliceo, plaga leprae est, ostendetur sacerdoti.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p101"></span>**50.** And the priest shall look upon
the plague, and shut up *it that hath* the plague seven days:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p102"></span>**50.** Et inspiciet saccMos plagam,
includetque plagam illam septera diebus.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p103"></span>**51.** And he shall look on the plague
on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in
the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, *or* in any work that is made of
skin; the plague *is* a fretting leprosy; it *is* unclean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p104"></span>**51.** Postea inspiciet plagam illam
die septimo: si creverlt plaga illa per vestera, vel per subtegmen, vel
pellem in omni opere pelliceo, lepra corodentis plagae est, immunda est.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p105"></span>**52.** He shall therefore burn that
garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of
skin, wherein the plague is: for it *is* a fretting leprosy; it shall be
burnt in the fire.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p106"></span>**52.** Comburetque vestem, vel stamen,
vel subtegmen ex lana, vel ex lino, vel quodvis opus pelliceum in quo
fuerit plaga illa: quia lepra corrodens est, igni comburetur.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p107"></span>**53.** And if the priest shall look,
and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the
warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;

<span id="ii.i.iii-p108"></span>**53.** Quod si, ubi inspexerit
sacerdos, ecce non creverit plaga illa in veste, vel in stamine, vel in
subtegmine, vel in quovis opere pelliceo.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p109"></span>**54.** Then the priest shall command
that they wash *the thing* wherein the plague *is,* and he shall shut it
up seven days more:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p110"></span>**54.** Tune praecipiet sacerdos, et
lavabunt id in quo est plaga: et recludet illud septem diebus secundo.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p111"></span>**55.** And the priest shall look on the
plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, *if* the plague have not
changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it *is* unclean; thou
shalt burn it in the fire; it *is* fret inward, *whether* it *be* bare
within or without.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p112"></span>**55.** Inspiciet vero sacerdos,
postquam lotum fuerit, plagam illam: et, si non mutaverit plaga illa
colorem suum, nee plaga creverit, immunda est, igni combures illud:
corrosio est in calvitio ejus vel in parte ejus depilata.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p113"></span>**56.** And if the priest look, and,
behold, the plague *be* somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he
shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the
warp, or out of the woof:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p114"></span>**56.** Quod si dum inspexerit sacerdos,
ecce, subobscura fuerit plaga postquam lota fuit, abscindet eam e veste,
vel epelle, vel e stamine, vel e subtegmine

<span id="ii.i.iii-p115"></span>**57.** And if it appear still in the
garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it
*is* a spreading *plague*: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague *is*
with fire.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p116"></span>**57.** Quod si comspecta fureit ultra
in veste, vel in stamine, vel in subtegmine, vel in quovis opere
pelliceo lepra germinans est, igni combures illud in quo fuerit,
lavabitur secundo, et mundum erit.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p117"></span>**58.** And the garment, either warp or
woof, or whatsoever thing of skin *it be*, which thou shalt wash, if the
plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time,
and shall be clean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p118"></span>**58.** Vestis autem, sive stamen, sive,
sbtegment, aut quodivis opus pelliceum quod laveris, si recesserit ab
eis plagra, lavabitur secundo, et mundum erit.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p119"></span>**59.** This *is* the law of the plague
of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or
woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it
unclean.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p123"></span>**2.** *When a man shall have in the
skin.* Since every eruption was not the leprosy, and did not render a
man unclean, when God appoints the priests to be the judges, He
distinguishes by certain marks a common eruption from the leprosy; and
then subjoins the difference between the various kinds of leprosy. For
the disease was not always incurable; but, only when the blood was
altogether corrupted, so that the skin itself had become hardened by its
corrosion, or swollen by its diseased state. This, then, must be
observed in the first place, that the Greek and Latin word *lepra,* and
the Hebrew <span id="ii.i.iii-p123.2"></span>צרעת *tzaragmath,* extend
further than to the incurable disease, which medical men call
*elephantiasis*  <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) both on account of
the hardness of the skin, and also its mottled color; not, however, that
there is an entire agreement between the thickness of the man’s skin and
that of an elephant, but because this disease produces insensibility of
the skin. This the Greeks call <span id="ii.i.iii-p124.2"></span>Ψώρα,
and if it be not a kind of leprosy, it is nearly allied to it. Thus we
see that there was a distinction between the *scab* and leprosy; just as
now-a-days, if it were necessary to judge respecting the itch, (which is
commonly called the disease of St. Menanus,  <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) the marks must be observed, which
distinguish it from leprosy. But, as to the various kinds of leprosy, I
confess that I am not a physician, so as to discuss them accurately, and
I purposely abstain from close inquiry about them, because I am
persuaded that the disease here treated of affected the Israelites in an
extraordinary manner, which we are now unacquainted with; for what do we
now know of a leprous house? Indeed it is probable that, since heathen
writers knew that the Jewish people suffered from this disease, they
laid hold of it as the ground of their falsehood, that all the
descendants of Abraham were infected with the itch, and were driven away
from Egypt, lest others should catch it from them. That  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) this was an ancient calumny appears from
Josephus, both in the ninth book of his Antiquities, and in his Treatise
against Apion; and it is repeated both by C. Tacitus and Justin. Yet I
make no doubt that the *Egyptians,* a very proud nation, in order to
efface the memory of their own disgrace, and of the vengeance inflicted
upon them by God, invented this lie, and thus grossly turned against
this innocent people what had happened to themselves, when they were
smitten with boils and blains. But we shall see hereafter, amongst God’s
curses, that He chastised His people with the same plagues as He had
inflicted on the Egyptians:

<span id="ii.i.iii-p127"></span>"The Lord will smite thee with the botch
of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab,” etc. (<span
id="ii.i.iii-p127.1"></span>[De
28:27](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027.md)<span
id="ii.i.iii-p127.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.i.iii-p128"></span>Whence it may be probably inferred, that
God avenged the crimes of His ancient people with special judgments,
which are now unknown to us; just as afterwards new diseases arose, from
which those in old times were free. At any rate, Josephus, by clear and
solid arguments, exposes the absurdity of this accusation, that Moses
was driven from Egypt with a crowd of exiles, lest they should infect
the country with their disease; because, if they had been universally
affected with this malady, he never would have imposed such severe laws
for separating the lepers from general society.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p129"></span>God first commands that, whenever a
suspicion of leprosy arose, the man was to present himself to the
priest; if any symptom of leprosy appeared, He commands him to be shut
up for a period of seven days, until it should appear from the progress
of the disease that it was incurable leprosy. That God should have
appointed the priests to be judges, and those, too, only of the highest
order, is a proof that His spiritual service was rather regarded than
mere bodily health. If any shall inquire whether leprosy is not a
contagious disease, and whether it be not therefore expedient that all
who were affected by it should be removed from intercourse with others,
I admit, indeed, that such is the case, but I deny that this was the
main object in view. For, in process of time, physicians would have been
better able to decide by their art and skill: whereas God enjoined this
decision upon the priests alone, and gave them the rule whereby they
were to judge. Nor did He appoint the Levites indiscriminately, but only
the sons of Aaron, who were the highest order, in order that the
authority of the decision might be greater. It was, then, by a gross
error, or rather impudence, that the Papal priests (*sacrifici*) assumed
to themselves this jurisdiction. It was (they say) the office of the
chief priests under the Law to distinguish between the kinds of leprosy;
and, therefore, the same right is transferred to the bishops. But they
carry the mockery still further: the official  <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) the bishop’s representative, sits as the
legitimate judge; he calls in physicians and surgeons, from whose
answers he pronounces what he confesses he is ignorant of himself.
Behold how cleverly they accommodate a legal rite to our times! The
mockery, however, is still more disgusting, when in another sense they
extend to the whole tribe of priests what they have said to belong
solely to the bishops; for, since the sin under which all labor is a
spiritual leprosy, they thence infer that all are excluded from the
congregation of the faithful until they shall have been purged and
received by absolution, which they hold to be the common office of all
the priests. They afterwards add, that judgment cannot be pronounced
till the cause is heard, and so conclude that confession is necessary.
But, if they choose to have recourse to subtleties, reason would rather
conduct us to the opposite conclusion; for God did not desire the
priests to take cognizance of a hidden disease, but only after the
manifest symptoms had appeared: hence it will follow, that it is
preposterous to bring secret sins to judgment, and that wretched men are
dragged to their confession contrary to all law and justice. But,
setting aside all these absurdities, an analogy must be observed between
us and God’s ancient people. He of old forbade the external uncleanness
of the flesh to be tolerated in His people. By Christ’s coming, the
typical. figure has ceased; but we are taught that all uncleanness,
whereby the purity of His services is defiled, is not to be cherished,
or borne with amongst us. And surely excommunication answers to this
ceremony; since by it the Church is purified, lest corruptions should
everywhere assail it, if wicked and guilty persons occupied a place in
it promiscuously with the good. The command of God that, whilst the
disease was obscure and questionable, the infected person should be shut
up for seven days, recommends moderation to us, lest any, who is still
curable, should be condemned before his time. In fact, this medium is to
be observed, that the judge should not be too remiss and hasty in
pardoning, and still that he should temper severity by justice; and
especially that he should not be too precipitate in his judgment. What
we translate “shall pronounce him clean, or unclean,” is in Hebrew,
“shall clean, or unclean him;” thus the dignity of the judgment is more
fully established, as though it had proceeded from God Himself; and
assuredly no medical skill could declare on the seventh day a leprosy to
be incurable, respecting which there was doubt so short a time before,
unless God should in some special manner discover the uncleanness, and
guide the eyes of the priests by His Spirit.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p132"></span>**29** *If a man or woman.* What is here
spoken of is not the baldness which so often occurs in old age; but that
loss of hair, which is the consequence of leprosy, is distinguished from
any other, the cause of which may be some indisposition, and which yet
does not pollute a man. But, inasmuch as some kinds of baldness do not
so greatly differ at first sight from leprosy, — such, for instance, as
*ophiasis* and *alopecia*  <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) — it is
therefore necessary to distinguish them.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p136"></span><span id="ii.i.iii-p136.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i.iii-p137"></span>**44.** *He is a leprous man, he is
unclean.* In the first part of the verse he says that the leprous man
must be counted unclean; but, in the latter part, he commands the priest
to give sentence against this uncleanness, lest it should be carried
into the congregation. On this ground he says, “*his* plague is upon his
head,” which is as much as to say, that he is sentenced to just
ignominy, for Moses takes it for granted that God holds up to public
infamy whomsoever He smites with leprosy, and thence reminds them that
they justly and deservedly bear this punishment.

<span id="ii.i.iii-p138"></span>The two following verses contain the
form in which the sentence is executed, viz., that the man should wear a
rent in his garment, which is to be the mark of his disgrace, that he
should walk with his head bare, and with his mouth covered, (for this I
take to be the meaning of the covering of his lip;) and besides this,
that he is to be the proclaimer of his own pollution; finally, that he
must dwell without the camp, as if banished from communication with men.
Moses here  <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) refers to the existing
state of the people, as long as they sojourned in the desert; for after
they began to inhabit the land, the lepers were driven out of the towns
and villages to dwell by themselves. I know not whether the opinion of
some is a sound one, that they were enjoined to cover the mouth or lip,
lest by the infection of their breath they should injure others. My own
view is rather, that because they were civilly dead, they also bore the
symbol of death in having the face covered — as their separation
deprived them of the ordinary life of men. Where we translate “shall
cry, Unclean, unclean,” some, taking the verb, <span
id="ii.i.iii-p139.2"></span>יקרא *yikra,*  <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) indefinitely, construe it passively, “shall
be called,:” and I admit that in many passages it has the same force as
if it were in the plural number. But, because the repetition of the word
“unclean” is emphatic, it is probable that the word is not to be taken
simply for “to call,” (*vocare*;) and therefore, I rather incline to the
opinion that, by the command of the Law, they warned all with their own
mouth not to approach them, lest any one should incautiously pollute
himself by touching them; although their uncleanness was perhaps
proclaimed publicly, so that all might mutually exhort each other to
beware And Jeremiah seems to allude to this passage, where, speaking
 <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) of the defilements of the city, he
says that all men cried

<span id="ii.i.iii-p142"></span>"Unclean; fly ye, fly ye.” (<span
id="ii.i.iii-p142.1"></span>[La
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.i.iii-p142.1"></span>)

<span id="ii.i.iii-p143"></span><span id="ii.i.iii-p143.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i.iii-p144"></span>**58.** *And the garment.* This kind of
disease, God, in his infinite clemency, has willed to be unknown to us.
He has indeed subjected woolen garments and furs to the ravages of the
moth, and vessels of various kinds to rust, and other corruptions; in
fact, has surrounded the human race with rottenness, in order that
everywhere our eyes should light on the punishment of sin; but what the
leprosy of garments may be, is unknown. But its expiation under the Law
admonished his ancient people that the must carefully beware of even
external uncleanness, so as to cleanse themselves “from all filthiness
of the flesh and spirit.” It has appeared to me sufficient to touch upon
the sum of the matter, because it would be almost superfluous labor to
insist upon the words, although I should be unwilling to condemn the
diligence of those who examine these points also; but it is not my
purpose to perform the office of the grammarian.
