<span id="iii.x.v-p2"></span>leviticus 4:1-35

<span id="iii.x.v-p3"></span>**1.** And the LORD spakeunto Moses,
saying,

<span id="iii.x.v-p4"></span>**1.** Alloquutus est praeterea Jehova
Mosen, dicendo:

<span id="iii.x.v-p5"></span>**2.** Speak unto the children of Israel,
saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the
commandments of the LORD *concerning things* which ought not to be done,
and shall do against any of them:

<span id="iii.x.v-p6"></span>**2.** Loquere ad filius Israel, dicendo,
Anima quum peccaverit per errorem ab omnibus praeceptis Jehovae qusa non
sunt facienda, feceritque quidpiam de uno ex illis:

<span id="iii.x.v-p7"></span>**3.** If the priest that is anointed do
sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin,
which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for
a sin offering.

<span id="iii.x.v-p8"></span>**3.** Si sacerdos unctus peccaverit
secundum delictum populi, offeret sacrificium pro peccato suo quod
peccavit, juvencum vitulum immaculatum Jehovae pro peccato.

<span id="iii.x.v-p9"></span>**4.** And he shall bring the bullock unto
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and
shall lay his hand upon the bullock’s head, and kill the bullock before
the LORD.

<span id="iii.x.v-p10"></span>**4.** Adducetque juvencum ilum ad ostium
tabernaculi conventionis in conspectu Jehovae, et admovebit manum suare
super caput juvenci, mactabitque juvencum in conspectu Jehovah.

<span id="iii.x.v-p11"></span>**5.** And the priest that is anointed
shall take of the bullock’s blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the
congregation:

<span id="iii.x.v-p12"></span>**5.** Accipietque sacerdos unctus de
sanguine juvenci, et inferet eum in tabernaculum conventionis.

<span id="iii.x.v-p13"></span>**6.** And the priest shall dip his finger
in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD,
before the vail of the sanctuary.

<span id="iii.x.v-p14"></span>**6.** Dein sacerdos tinget digitum suum
in sanguine, aspergetque de sanguine illo septem vicibus coram Jehova:

<span id="iii.x.v-p15"></span>**7.** And the priest shall put *some* of
the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD,
which *is* in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the
blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering,
which *is at* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

<span id="iii.x.v-p16"></span>**7.** Ponetque sacerdos de sanguine isto
super cornua altaris suffimenti aromataci coram Jehova, quod est in
tabernaculo conventionis: totum autem sanguinem reliquum juvenci
effundet ad basin altaris holocausti quod est ad ostium tabernaculi
conventionis.

<span id="iii.x.v-p17"></span>**8.** And he shall take off from it all
the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the
inwards, and all the fat that *is* upon the inwards,

<span id="iii.x.v-p18"></span>**8.** Totum praeterea adipem juvenci
oblati pro peccato tollet ab eo: nempe adipem operientem intestina, et
totum adipem qui est super ca.

<span id="iii.x.v-p19"></span>**9.** And the two kidneys, and the fat
that *is* upon them, which *is* by the flanks, and the caul above the
liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,

<span id="iii.x.v-p20"></span>**9.** Duos quoque renes, et adipem qui
est super eos, et qui est super ilia, et fibram quae est super *jecur,*
cum renibus auferet:

<span id="iii.x.v-p21"></span>**10.** As it was taken off from the
bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn
them upon the altar of the burnt offering.

<span id="iii.x.v-p22"></span>**10.** Quemadmodum tollitur a bove
sacrificii prosperitatum: adolebitque ea sacerdos super altare
holocausti.

<span id="iii.x.v-p23"></span>**11.** And the skin of the bullock, and
all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and
his dung,

<span id="iii.x.v-p24"></span>**11.** Pellem praeterea juvenci, et omnem
carnem ejus, cum capite ejus, et cruribus, et intestina ejus, et timum
ejus.

<span id="iii.x.v-p25"></span>**12.** Even the whole bullock shall he
carry forth without the camp unto clean place, where the ashes are
poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are
poured out shall he be burnt.

<span id="iii.x.v-p26"></span>**12.** Educetque totum juveneum extra
castra ad locum mundum, ad locum ubi effundetur cinis: et comburet eum
super ligna igni: in loco inquam ubi effunditur cinis, comburetur.

<span id="iii.x.v-p27"></span>**13.** And if the whole congregation of
Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the
assembly, and they have done *somewhat against* any of the commandments
of the LORD *concerning things* which should not be done, and are
guilty;

<span id="iii.x.v-p28"></span>**13.** Quod si tota synagoga Israel
erraverit, et latuerit res in oculis congregationis, et fecerit unum ab
omnibus praeceptis Jehovae qum non sunt facienda, et deliquerit:

<span id="iii.x.v-p29"></span>**14.** When the sin, which they have
sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young
bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernale of the
congregation.

<span id="iii.x.v-p30"></span>**14.** Notum autem fuerit peccatum quod
peceaverunt: tune offeret congregatio juvencum filium bovis in
sacrificium pro peccato, adducetque ilium ante tabernaculum
conventionis,

<span id="iii.x.v-p31"></span>**15.** And the elders of the congregation
shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and
the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.

<span id="iii.x.v-p32"></span>**15.** Ponentque seniores synagogae
marius suas super caput juvenci coram Jehova: tune mactabit juvencum
coram Jehova.

<span id="iii.x.v-p33"></span>**16.** And the priest that is anointed
shall bring of the bullock’s blood to the tabernacle of the
congregation:

<span id="iii.x.v-p34"></span>**16.** Inferetque sacerdos unctus de
sanguine juvenci in tabernaculum conventionis.

<span id="iii.x.v-p35"></span>**17.** And the priest shall dip his
finger *in some* of the blood, and sprinkle *it* seven times before the
LORD, *even* before the vail.

<span id="iii.x.v-p36"></span>**17.** Et intinget sacerdos digitum suum
in ipso sanguine, aspergetque septem vicibus coram Jehova ante velum.

<span id="iii.x.v-p37"></span>**18.** And he shall put *some* of the
blood upon the horns of the altar which *is* before the LORD, that *is*
in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood
at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which *is at* the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation.

<span id="iii.x.v-p38"></span>**18.** De sanguine quoque illo ponet
super cornua altaris, quod est coram Jehova, quod est inquam in
tabernaculo conventionis, posthaec totum sanguinem reliquum effundet ad
basin altaris holocausti quod est ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis.

<span id="iii.x.v-p39"></span>**19.** And he shall take all his fat from
him, and burn *it* upon the altar.

<span id="iii.x.v-p40"></span>**19.** Totum autem adipem ejus tollet ab
eo, et adolebit super altare.

<span id="iii.x.v-p41"></span>**20.** And he shall do with the bullock
as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this:
and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be
forgiven them.

<span id="iii.x.v-p42"></span>**20.** Juvenco vero faciet quemadmodum
fecit juvenco oblato pro peccato, sic faciet ei: atque expiabit eos
sacerdos, et remittetur eis.

<span id="iii.x.v-p43"></span>**21.** And he shall carry forth the
bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock:
it *is* a sin offering for the congregation.

<span id="iii.x.v-p44"></span>**21.** Deinde juvencum educet extra
castra, et comburet eum quemadmodum combussit juvencum priorem: oblatio
pro peccato congregationis est.

<span id="iii.x.v-p45"></span>**22.** When a ruler hath sinned, and done
*somewhat* through ignorance *against* any of the commandments of the
LORD his God *concerning things* which should not be done, and is
guilty;

<span id="iii.x.v-p46"></span>**22.** Si princeps peccaverit, feceritque
unum ab omnibus praeceptis Jehovae Dei sui quae non sunt facienda, et id
fecerit per errorem, et deliquerit:

<span id="iii.x.v-p47"></span>**23.** Or if his sin, wherein he hath
sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the
goats, a male without blemish:

<span id="iii.x.v-p48"></span>**23.** Si innotuerit ei peccatum suum
quod peccavit: tunc offeret oblationem suam hircum caprarum masculum
immaculatum.

<span id="iii.x.v-p49"></span>**24.** And he shall lay his hand upon the
head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt
offering before the LORD: it *is* a sin offering.

<span id="iii.x.v-p50"></span>**24.** Ponetque manum suam super caput
hirci, et mactabit eum in loco in quo mactari solet holocaustum coram
Jehova: oblatio pro peccato est.

<span id="iii.x.v-p51"></span>**25.** And the priest shall take of the
blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put *it* upon the horns
of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the
bottom of the altar of burnt offering.

<span id="iii.x.v-p52"></span>**25.** Tolletque sacerdos de sanguine
oblationis pro peccato digito suo, et ponet super corrina altaris
holocausti: reliquum autem sanguinem ejus effundet ad basin altaris
holocausti.

<span id="iii.x.v-p53"></span>**26.** And he shall burn all his fat upon
the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the
priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it
shall be forgiven him.

<span id="iii.x.v-p54"></span>**26.** Totum vero adipem ejus adolebit
super altare, sicut adipem sacrificii prosperitatum: et ita expiabit
ilium sacerdos a peccato ejus, et remittetur ei.

<span id="iii.x.v-p55"></span>**27.** And if any one of the common
people sin through ignorance, while he doeth *somewhat against* any of
the commandments of the LORD *concerning things* which ought not to be
done, and be guilty;

<span id="iii.x.v-p56"></span>**27.** Quod si anima aliqua peccaverit
per errorem de populo terrae, faciendo unum a praeceptis Jehova quae non
sunt facienda, et deliquerit:

<span id="iii.x.v-p57"></span>**28.** Or if his sin, which he hath
sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid
of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath
sinned.

<span id="iii.x.v-p58"></span>**28.** Si innotuerit ei peccatum suum
quod peccavit: afferet oblationem suam capellam caprarum immaculatam
foeminam pro peccato suo quod peccavit.

<span id="iii.x.v-p59"></span>**29.** And he shall lay his hand upon the
head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the
burnt offering.

<span id="iii.x.v-p60"></span>**29.** Admovebitque manum suam super
caput oblationis pro peccato, et mactabit oblationem illam pro peccato
in loco holocausti.

<span id="iii.x.v-p61"></span>**30.** And the priest shall take of the
blood thereof with his finger, and put *it* upon the horns of the altar
of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the
bottom of the altar.

<span id="iii.x.v-p62"></span>**30.** Dein tollet sacerdos de sanguine
ejus digito suo, ponetque super cornua altaris holocausti: totum vero
reliquum sanguinem ejus effundet ad basin altaris.

<span id="iii.x.v-p63"></span>**31.** And he shall take away all the fat
thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace
offerings; and the priest shall burn *it* upon the altar for a sweet
savour unto the LORD; and the priest shalt make an atonement for him,
and it shall be forgiven him.

<span id="iii.x.v-p64"></span>**31.** Totum praeterea adipem ejus
auferet, quemadmodum ablatus fuit adeps a sacrificio prosperitatum:
adolebitque sacerdos super altare in odorem quietis Jehovae: atque ita
expiabit eum sacerdos, et remittetur ei.

<span id="iii.x.v-p65"></span>**32.** And if he bring a lamb for a sin
offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.

<span id="iii.x.v-p66"></span>**32.** Quod si pecudem obtulerit
oblationem suam pro peccato, foeminam immaculatam afferet.

<span id="iii.x.v-p67"></span>**33.** And he shall lay his hand upon the
head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place
where they kill the burnt offering.

<span id="iii.x.v-p68"></span>**33.** Ponetque manum suam super caput
illius oblationis pro peccato, et mactabit illam pro sacrificio peccati,
in loco in quo mactare solet holocaustum.

<span id="iii.x.v-p69"></span>**34.** And the priest shall take of the
blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put *it* upon the horns
of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof
at the bottom of the altar:

<span id="iii.x.v-p70"></span>**34.** Deinde accipiet sacerdos de
sanguine oblationis pro peccato digito suo, ponetque super cornua
altaris holocausti: totum vero reliquum sangninem ejus effundet ad basin
altaris.

<span id="iii.x.v-p71"></span>**35.** And he shall take away all the fat
thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the
peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar,
according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest
shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall
be forgiven him.

<span id="iii.x.v-p72"></span>**35.** Totum praeterea adipem qius
auferet, quemadmodum auferri solet adeps agni a sacrificio
prosperitatum: adolebitque illa sacerdos super altare in oblationem
ignitam Jehovae: atque expiabit eum sacerdos a peccato suo quod
peccavit, et remittetur el.

<span id="iii.x.v-p73"></span> 

<span id="iii.x.v-p74"></span><span id="iii.x.v-p74.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.v-p75"></span>After Moses had treated of the offerings
and other sacrifices, which were testimonies of gratitude and exercises
of piety, he now descends to the sin-offering (<span
id="iii.x.v-p75.1"></span>*expiationem*) which held the chief place
amongst the sacrifices, inasmuch as, without reconciliation, there could
never be any intercourse between men and God; for since He deservedly
abominates the whole human race on account of the corruption of our
nature, and because we all continually provoke His wrath, the whole hope
of salvation must needs be founded on the remedies provided for
propitiating Him. This principle, being established, we must remember
that Moses will henceforth speak of the expiatory sacrifices which
propitiate God to men by the removal of their guilt. He here shews how
God is to be appeased, where a man shall have sinned through ignorance
or inconsiderateness; wherein too a distinction is laid down between
different persons, since one kind of victim is required of a king,
another of the priests, and another of ordinary persons; whilst regard
is had to the poor, that they may not be burdened by so great an expense
as the rich. But, since it will appear from the context that all kinds
of ignorance are not here included, we must see what the word <span
id="iii.x.v-p75.2"></span>שגגה, *shegagah,*  <span
id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) means, which I have preferred
rendering error rather than ignorance; for Moses does not refer to those
transgressions into which we are ensnared, when we are led astray by the
appearance of rectitude, so as to think ourselves without blame; but to
those of which we take no heed, and whereby our minds are not pricked;
or to those sudden falls, wherein the infirmity of the flesh so stifles
the reason and the judgment as to blind the sinner. It is of such that
Paul speaks when he bids us

<span id="iii.x.v-p77"></span>"restore in the spirit of meekness those
who  
are overtaken in a fault,” (<span id="iii.x.v-p77.2"></span>[Ga
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001)<span id="iii.x.v-p77.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="iii.x.v-p78"></span>for he does not mean those who are
deceived by their good intentions (as they call it,) or rather by their
foolish opinion, so as to be unconscious of their sin; but those who
fall through the infirmity of their flesh, and whom Satan catches
unawares in his snares; or who, at any rate, do not perceive the evil
they have done, so as immediately to apply the remedy. This will be more
clearly understood from <span id="iii.x.v-p78.1"></span>[Ps.
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#013.md)<span id="iii.x.v-p78.1"></span>,
where David, having asked pardon for his errors, seeks to be kept free
from presumptuous sins.  <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) The
antithesis between <span id="iii.x.v-p79.3"></span>שגיאות, *shegioth,*
 <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) and <span
id="iii.x.v-p80.6"></span>זדים, *zedim,* shews that those transgressions
are called errors, in which there is no criminal pride against God. “If
a soul shall sin — *from all* the commandments,”  <span
id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) is a harsh expression; and therefore
some refer it to sins of omission, but I interpret it more simply, “If
he sin by turning away from the commandments,” or “if he commit any
thing opposed (*alienum*)*to* the commandments."

<span id="iii.x.v-p82"></span><span id="iii.x.v-p82.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.v-p83"></span>**3.** *If the priest that is anointed.*
He now distinguishes between different persons, and begins with the high
priest, who alone bore the high distinction of the holy unction, unless
it be thought better to apply it to the whole supreme class.  <span
id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) It is probable, however, that it only
refers to one. The more illustrious was his dignity, the more diligently
and zealously ought his life to be confirmed to the model of holiness;
and therefore the infirmity which was more tolerable in others, was more
exceedingly reprehensible in him. This is the reason why it was required
that he should atone for himself with a greater victim. But this in some
measure related to all the Levites, inasmuch as they were chosen to be
of the sacred class; and it now extends to all the ministers and pastors
of the Church, not that they should ransom themselves by the sacrifice
of a calf, but that they should diligently beware of every sin, and be
more intent in their endeavors after holiness. The clause “according to
the sin of the people,” might be also rendered “*unto* the sin,” etc.,
as though Moses had said that the priest through sin corrupted the
people by his bad example; for, since his life is the rule of holiness
and righteousness, so his faults give occasion to the errors of others.
The sense, however, that I have followed is simpler, *i.e.,* that though
the transgression of the priest may be an ordinary one, yet in
consideration of his office it becomes more weighty, and deserving of
greater punishment.

<span id="iii.x.v-p85"></span><span id="iii.x.v-p85.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.v-p86"></span>**5.** *And the priest that is anointed
shall take.* It is well known that what is here prescribed as to the
sprinkling of blood, and its pouring out, as well as to the burning of
the fat and the kidneys, is the same as in the other sacrifices; and the
comparison in the 10th verse sufficiently proves that, the ordinary
forms were observed in other particulars. But inasmuch as it might seem
absurd that the priest, who was himself guilty, should come before God
to perform the office of reconciliation, it was necessary to prescribe
the details more accurately, to obviate all doubt. Although, therefore,
he was unworthy to approach God, yet, since the law of the priesthood
was inviolable, he was admitted to the discharge of his duties; for it
was not lawful that more mediators should be appointed. In order, then,
that more reverence should be paid to the rites of the Law, and that men
should seek after no other way of reconciliation, God extended His grace
to the fault of the priest. The blood was sprinkled before the Lord,
that the people might learn that through the sight of the sacrifice sins
were hidden and buried, so as to come no more into remembrance before
God; but the rest of the blood was poured before the altar, because it
was holy, and therefore ought by no means to be cast elsewhere like
anything profane.

<span id="iii.x.v-p87"></span><span id="iii.x.v-p87.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.v-p88"></span>**13.** *And if the whole congregation.*
The very same sacrifice which was enjoined on the priest is required of
the people; since he who went into the sanctuary in the name of all to
present all the tribes before God, represented the whole body. It seems
indeed that the kind of ignorance here spoken of is different from the
former kind; since it was said “if the thing be hid;” yet I think that
these infirmities are comprised, in which it often happens that men are
blinded for a time.  <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) For many do
not search into themselves, and therefore slumber in their sins; whereas
if they honestly examined their doings, their conscience would
straightway smite them. It might, then, happen that the whole people
should fail to be aware of their sin, whilst dealing with themselves too
gently and indulgently. The meaning therefore is, that although no sense
of sin should at first arouse them to repentance, yet, if afterwards
they should be awakened so as to begin to acknowledge their crime, God
must be propitiated by sacrifices; for otherwise the people might make a
cloak for themselves of their error.

<span id="iii.x.v-p90"></span><span id="iii.x.v-p90.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.v-p91"></span>**22.** *When a ruler hath sinned.* A
peculiar atonement is also appointed for the transgression of the
rulers; and, although he speaks of the ruler in the singular number, yet
inasmuch as the law was not yet enacted that one individual should bear
rule, he undoubtedly designates the heads and governors generally,
because they who bear rule do more injury by their bad example than
private persons. If, then, any of the judges or governors had sinned
through error, he might indeed be set free by a lesser victim than the
priest or the whole people, yet there was individually this difference
between them, that they were to offer she-goats or lambs, and the ruler
a he-goat; and the object of this was that those in authority should
more carefully keep themselves pure from every transgression, whereas
otherwise they are wont to indulge themselves more freely, as if their
rank and dignity allowed them greater license. Where we have given as
our translation, “If (the sin) shall have become known,” (<span
id="iii.x.v-p91.1"></span>*si innotuerit,*) translators are not agreed.
 <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) The word used is properly a
disjunctive particle *Or*;  <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) but
it is sometimes used for the conditional particle, as we shall see in
the next chapter. Those who retain the primary and genuine meaning of
the word do violence to the signification of the last word of the
foregoing verse, and translate it, “shall have offended” instead of
“shall have felt that he has offended;” but since it appears from many
passages that <span id="iii.x.v-p93.10"></span>או, *o*, is equivalent to
<span id="iii.x.v-p93.11"></span>אם*, im,* there is no need of wresting
the words to an improper sense. The word <span
id="iii.x.v-p93.12"></span>הודע, *hodang,* which they render
transitively “to make known,” may fitly bear my translation, unless this
is preferred, “if he shall have known,” (*si* *cognoverit*) The words
which Moses continually repeats, “the priest shall make an atonement for
him, and his; iniquity shall be forgiven him,” some coldly restrict to
external and civil cleansing, as if Moses only removed his condemnation
before men; but God rather offers pardon to sinners, and assures them
that He will be favorable to them, lest fear or doubt should prevent
them from freely calling upon Him. And assuredly those who do not
acknowledge that the legal rites were sacraments, are not acquainted
with the very rudiments of the faith. Now to all sacraments, at any rate
to the common sacraments of the Church, a spiritual promise is annexed:
it follows, therefore, that pardon was truly promised to the fathers,
who reconciled themselves to God by the offering of sacrifices, not
because the slaying of beasts expiated sins, but because it was a
certain and infallible symbol, in which pious minds might acquiesce, so
as to dare to come before God with tranquil confidence. In sum, as now
in baptism sins are sacramentally washed away, so under the Law also the
sacrifices were means of expiation, though in a different way; since
baptism sets Christ before us as if He were present, whilst under the
Law He was only obscurely typified. Figuratively indeed what applies to
Christ only is transferred to the signs, for in Him alone was manifested
to us the fulfillment of all spiritual blessings, and He at length
blotted out sins by His one and perpetual sacrifice; but since the
question here is not as to the value of the legal ceremonies in
themselves, let it suffice that they truly testified of the grace of
God, of which they were the types; and so let not that profane
imagination be listened to, that the sacrifices only politically and as
far as regarded men absolved those by whom they were offered from guilt
and condemnation.

<span id="iii.x.v-p76"></span> *S.M.* says the word means, “a sin into
which the perplexed mind has been driven under the impulse of some
passion, through thoughtlessness, imprudence, or error, when inattentive
to the dictates of reason and of the Spirit.” — *W*.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[257](cc04113.htm#fr_256.md) <span
id="iii.x.v-p78.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.v-p79"></span> “<span id="iii.x.v-p79.1"></span>A
superbiis.” — *Lat. “*<span id="iii.x.v-p79.2"></span>De ses fiertes, et
rebellions.” — *Fr*.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[258](cc04113.htm#fr_257.md) <span
id="iii.x.v-p79.4"></span>

<span id="iii.x.v-p80"></span> Lexicographers make no distinction
between the approximate roots <span id="iii.x.v-p80.1"></span>שגג and
<span id="iii.x.v-p80.2"></span>שגה. Hence <span
id="iii.x.v-p80.3"></span>שגיאות, is regarded as meaning the same as the
word used in <span id="iii.x.v-p80.4"></span>[Le
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#002.md)<span id="iii.x.v-p80.4"></span>.
By <span id="iii.x.v-p80.5"></span>זדים, are understood sins committed
with a high hand and rebellious spirit. — *W.*

<span id="fn_258"></span>[259](cc04113.htm#fr_258.md) <span
id="iii.x.v-p80.7"></span>

<span id="iii.x.v-p81"></span> *A. V.,* “against any of the
commandments.” Ainsworth’s version is, “A soule, when it shall sin
through ignorance of all the commandments,” etc.; and his Gloss. “*of*
*all,* understand, *by doing any one of all the commandments.* So Moses
himself explaineth it in the words here following, and in <span
id="iii.x.v-p81.1"></span>[Lev. 4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#013.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#027.md)<span id="iii.x.v-p81.1"></span>."

<span id="fn_259"></span>[260](cc04113.htm#fr_259.md) <span
id="iii.x.v-p83.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.v-p84"></span> “<span id="iii.x.v-p84.1"></span>Sur
toute la maison d’Aaron.” — *Fr.*

<span id="fn_260"></span>[261](cc04113.htm#fr_260.md) <span
id="iii.x.v-p88.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.v-p89"></span> “<span id="iii.x.v-p89.1"></span>D’estre
comme estourdis pour un temps, et n’y voir goutte;” are, as it were,
stupified for a time, and cannot see a wink. — *Fr*.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[262](cc04113.htm#fr_261.md) <span
id="iii.x.v-p91.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.v-p92"></span> Instead of this and the following
sentences, the *Fr.* says, “<span id="iii.x.v-p92.1"></span>Les
expositeurs font bien ici quelques difficultez literales, mais pource
que la deduction ne serviroit rien a ceux, qui ne sont point lettrez, je
les passe.” Commentators certainly make some literal difficulties here,
but since the statement of them would be useless to the unlearned, I
pass them by.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[263](cc04113.htm#fr_262.md) <span
id="iii.x.v-p92.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.v-p93"></span> <span id="iii.x.v-p93.1"></span>או*, Or.*
Noldius, in his Concord. particularum, cites instances, such as <span
id="iii.x.v-p93.2"></span>[1Sa
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1020.htm#010.md)<span id="iii.x.v-p93.2"></span>,
in which this conjunction is equivalent to *If.* <span
id="iii.x.v-p93.3"></span>אשם is that last word of <span
id="iii.x.v-p93.4"></span>[Le
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lev004.htm#022.md)<span id="iii.x.v-p93.4"></span>
which *S.M.* has rendered <span id="iii.x.v-p93.5"></span>*deliquerit;*
but *A. V.* more happily, *is guilty,* <span
id="iii.x.v-p93.6"></span>הודע, says *S.M.,* is here used for <span
id="iii.x.v-p93.7"></span>נודע, the niphal of <span
id="iii.x.v-p93.8"></span>ידע, but it is simpler to regard it as a not
unusual variation of <span id="iii.x.v-p93.9"></span>הורע, the hophal,
strictly meaning, *caused to become known.* — *W.*
