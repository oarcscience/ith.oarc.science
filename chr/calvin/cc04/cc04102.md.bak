<span id="iii.viii.i-p2"></span>We now come to the third part of the
external service of God, which will bring us to the end of our
exposition of the Second Commandment. We have, then, now to treat of the
sacred oblations, the first place amongst which I have thought it best
to give to the loaves, which had their peculiar table opposite the
candlestick on the north side, as we saw in the construction of the
Tabernacle; for although the mention of them will recur elsewhere, yet,
since they were offered separately, and placed before the Ark of the
Covenant, as it were in God’s sight, they must not be treated of apart
from the sacrifices. I have already explained that this was no ordinary
symbol of God’s favor, when He descended familiarly to them, as if He
were their messmate. They were called “the bread of faces,”  <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) because they were placed before the
eyes of God; and thus He made known His special favor, as if coming to
banquet with them. Nor can it be doubted but that He commanded them to
be twelve in number, with reference to the twelve tribes, as if He would
admit to His table the food offered by each of them. The “two tenths”
make the fifth part of the *epah.* And it is plaia indeed that this rite
was thus accurately prescribed by God, lest diversity in so serious a
matter might gradually give birth to many corruptions. In the word
“tenths,” He seems to allude to the tax which He had imposed on the
people, that thus the holiness of the loaves might be enhanced. But why
He required two “tenths” rather than one I know not, nor do I think it
any use more curiously to inquire. I refer to the frankincense the
words, “that it may be on the bread for a memorial:” as if it were said
that the bread, seasoned by the smell of the incense, would renew the
memory of the children of Israel, so that they should be of sweet savor
before God. Others translate it “a monument” instead of “for a
memorial,” but with the same meaning. But although some think that the
bread itself is called a memorial, it is more applicable to the
frankincense; for it is afterwards added, that the incense should be at
the same time a burnt sacrifice, viz., because in it the bread was, as
it were, offered in burnt sacrifice.
