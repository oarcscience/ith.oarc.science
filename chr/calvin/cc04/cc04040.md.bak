<span id="iii.i.i-p3"></span>**4.** Thou shalt not make unto thee any
graven image, or any likeness *of* *anything* that *is* in heaven above,
or that *is* in the earth beneath, or that *is* in the water under the
earth:

<span id="iii.i.i-p4"></span>**4.** Non facies tibi sculptlie, neque
ullam imaginem eorum quae sunt in coelo sursum, neque eorum qae in terra
deorsum, neque eorum quae in aquis sunt subter terram.

<span id="iii.i.i-p5"></span>**5.** Thou shalt not bow down thyself to
them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God *am* a jealous God,
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third
and fourth *generation* of them that hate me;

<span id="iii.i.i-p6"></span>**5.** Non adorabis ea, neque coles ea, ego
enim Jehova Deus tuus, Deus zelotes, visitans iniquitatem patrum super
filios, in tertiam et quartam generationem in his qui me oderunt:

<span id="iii.i.i-p7"></span>**6.** And shewing mercy unto thousands of
them that love me, and keep my commandments.

<span id="iii.i.i-p8"></span>**6.** Et faciens misericordiam: in mille
diligentibus me, et custodientibus praecepta mea.

<span id="iii.i.i-p9"></span> 

<span id="iii.i.i-p10"></span><span id="iii.i.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.i.i-p11"></span>**4.** *Thou shalt not make unto thee any
graven image.* In the First Commandment, after He had taught who was the
true God, He commanded that He alone should e worshipped; and now He
defines what is His Legitimate Worship. Now, since these are two
distinct things, we conclude that the commandments are also distinct, in
which different things are treated of. The former indeed precedes in
order, viz., that believers are to be contented with one God; but it
would not be sufficient for us to be instructed to worship him alone,
unless we also knew the manner in which He would be worshipped. The sum
is, that the worship of God must be spiritual, in order that it may
correspond with His nature. For although Moses only speaks of idolatry,
yet there is no doubt but that by *synecdoche,* as in all the rest of
the Law, he condemns all fictitious services which men in their
ingenuity have invented. For hence have arisen the carnal mixtures
whereby God’s worship has been profaned, that they estimate Him
according to their own reason, and thus in a manner metamorphose Him. It
is necessary, then, to remember what God is, lest we should form any
gross or earthly ideas respecting Him. The words simply express that it
is wrong  <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) for men to seek the
presence of God in any visible image, because He cannot be represented
to our eyes. The command that they should not make any likeness, either
of any thing which is in heaven, or in the earth, or in the waters under
the earth, is derived from the evil custom which had everywhere
prevailed; for, since superstition is never uniform, but is drawn aside
in various directions, some thought that God was represented under the
form of fishes, others under that of birds, others in that of brutes;
and history especially recounts by what shameless delusions Egypt was
led astray. And hence too the vanity of men is declared, since,
whithersoever they turn their eyes, they everywhere lay hold of the
materials of error, notwithstanding that God’s glory shines on every
side, and whatever is seen above or below, invites us to the true God.

<span id="iii.i.i-p13"></span>Since, therefore, men are thus deluded, so
as to frame for themselves the materials of error from all things they
behold, Moses now elevates them above the whole fabric and elements of
the world; for by the things that are “in heaven above,” he designates
not only the birds, but the sun, and the moon, and all the stars also;
as will soon be seen. He declares, then, that a true image of God is not
to be found in all the world; and hence that His glory is defiled, and
His truth corrupted by the lie, whenever He is set before our eyes in a
visible form. Now we must remark, that there are two parts in the
Commandment — the *first* forbids the erection of a graven image, or any
likeness; the *second* prohibits the transferring of the worship which
God claims for Himself alone, to any of these phantoms or delusive
shows. Therefore, to devise any image of God, is in itself impious;
because by this corruption His Majesty is adulterated, and He is figured
to be other than He is. There is no need of refuting the foolish fancy
of some, that all sculptures and pictures are here condemned by Moses,
for he had no other object than to rescue God’s glory from all the
imaginations which tend to corrupt it. And assuredly it is a most gross
indecency to make God like a stock or a stone. Some expound the words,
“Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven image, which thou mayest
adore;”  <span id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) as if it were allowable to
make a visible image of God, provided it be not adored; but the
expositions which will follow will easily refute their error. Meanwhile,
I do not deny that these things are to be taken connectedly, since
superstitious worship is hardly ever separated from the preceding error;
for as soon as any one has permitted himself to devise an image of God,
he immediately falls into false worship. And surely whosoever reverently
and soberly feels and thinks about God Himself, is far from this
absurdity; nor does any desire or presumption to metamorphose God ever
creep in, except when coarse and carnal imaginations occupy our minds.
Hence it comes to pass, that those, who frame for themselves gods of
corruptible materials, superstitiously adore the work of their own
hands. I will then readily allow these two things, which are
inseparable, to be joined together; only let us recollect that God is
insulted, not only when His worship is transferred to idols, but when we
try to represent Him by any outward similitude.
