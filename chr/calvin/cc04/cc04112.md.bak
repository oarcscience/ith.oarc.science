omnem sanguinem non comedetis.

<span id="iii.x.iv-p37"></span> 

<span id="iii.x.iv-p38"></span><span id="iii.x.iv-p38.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.iv-p39"></span>**1.** *And if his oblation be a
sacrifice.* He now proceeds to a different class, viz., to the
sacrifices, which were testimonies of gratitude in celebration of God’s
blessings; part of which was burnt with fire, part was claimed by the
priests, and the rest remained to the offerers themselves. As to the
word <span id="iii.x.iv-p39.2"></span>שלמים, *shelomim,* I have briefly
given my opinion elsewhere;  <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) the
common translation of it is certainly unsuitable, “the sacrifices of
peace-offerings:” and the statement of others is far-fetched, that they
are called “sacrifices of perfections,” because it was unlawful for the
unclean to touch them. Since, however, the Hebrews include in the word
“peace,” safety, and all good success, I have thought that its plural
number might aptly be translated “prosperities:” on which account, David
calls the libation which used to be made in this sacrifice, “the cup of
salvations:” (<span id="iii.x.iv-p40.4"></span>[Ps
116:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.x.iv-p40.4"></span>,) nor do I doubt but that by this outward
sign he designates thanksgiving. I admit indeed that this sacrifice was
not only offered in acknowledgment of gratitude, but also when they
sought of God peace and good success; yet still the epithet will always
admirably suit it, because they confessed by it that God was the author
of all good things, so as to attribute all their prosperity to Him.
First, however, he commands all the sacrifices to be brought to the
tabernacle, which is what he means by “the face of God;”  <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) else would altars have been everywhere
erected in their cities and villages, and by this license God’s service
would have been mangled, and religion undermined. Wherefore, in order to
keep the people in the unity of the faith, he bids them all be content
with a single altar. But He would be worshipped and honored in that
place, which He had dedicated to Himself, lest they should be scattered
abroad after strange gods; and then He prescribes the mode of offering,
whether the victim were of the herd or the flock. That such exact
injunctions should be given as to trifles, might seem to be an
unnecessary particularity, and even a superfluous repetition, inasmuch
as the same thing is often inculcated, in precisely similar words: if it
were not that this earnestness reminded the people that something higher
was enwrapped in the ceremonies, whilst it restrained them from allowing
themselves wantonly to add or change the smallest point. This very
scrupulous observance, then, ought to have led them by the hand, as it
were, to the things signified; so that under the external image the
spiritual truth might meet their eyes; secondly, it ought to have held
them bound, as it were, to the word of God, lest they should do anything
in sacred matters from the dictates of their own reason. But now, since
the use of sacrifices has ceased, we are *first* taught that God’s
blessings are profaned, unless we diligently exercise ourselves in
manifesting our religion, as His infinite and constant liberality
towards us deserves; *secondly,* that unless our devotion is unmixed and
paid to Him alone, we impiously defraud Him of His right; *thirdly,*
that as we pray in Christ’s name, so our vows are to be paid, and our
thanksgivings to be rendered, through His hand; *and fourthly,* that
God’s loving-kindness is not to be celebrated in a negligent or
perfunctory manner, but that we must labor to do so, as in a matter of
the utmost importance, with no common zeal and attention.

<span id="iii.x.iv-p42"></span><span id="iii.x.iv-p42.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.iv-p43"></span>**16.** *And the priest shall burn them.*
He justly assigns to the priest the main duties of sacrificing, *i.e.,*
to sprinkle the blood, and to cast the fat into the fire, since he alone
was competent to make atonement. Moreover, although there is a harsh
metaphor contained in the word “food,” yet it admirably expresses what
the Holy Spirit would teach, that the legal service pleased God, just as
the food which we eat is pleasing to us; whilst it at the same time
marks God’s familiar communion with His people, as if He sat at the same
table with them. It is indeed sure that God, who breathes life into all,
and borrows nothing from any, does not want food; but His incomparable
kindness could not be better shewn forth, than by deigning to make
Himself, as it were, the messmate of His worshippers. In the same figure
of speech the ingratitude of the people is reproved by Malachi, when he
says,

<span id="iii.x.iv-p44"></span>"The table of the Lord is polluted, and
the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible,” (<span
id="iii.x.iv-p44.1"></span>[Mal
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.x.iv-p44.1"></span>;)

<span id="iii.x.iv-p45"></span>not because God delighted in the fat of
fed beasts, or in bread; but because it was a gross and intolerable act
of impiety to neglect this extraordinary pledge of His grace. This
similitude, however, ought to be referred to the truth it represents,
viz., that the exercise of faith, and the proofs of our piety, are no
less pleasing to God than as if He should be feasted delicately and
sumptuously; wherefore we ought to take the greater care not to defraud
Him of the things He takes delight in. It is not very clear to me why
God claims for Himself the fat in all the sacrifices, and commands it to
be burnt, unless that in this way He might accustom His servants to
temperance. We have already seen that the fat is certainly accounted the
most delicate part, where Moses applies this word to corn and wine; and
this also is plain from <span id="iii.x.iv-p45.2"></span>[Ps
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#005.md)<span id="iii.x.iv-p45.2"></span>,
“My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness.” And when God
declares (<span id="iii.x.iv-p45.3"></span>[Isa
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.x.iv-p45.3"></span>,) that He does not desire “the fat,” He
signifies that He does not require for His own sake the choicest part of
animals, but that the Israelites might remember that they should partake
soberly of all their food, as if they had consecrated the best and
first-fruits of it. If any one desire a more distinct exposition of
this, the offering of the fat taught them to pay more honor to the
service of God; and secondly, it instructed them in abstinence. The
allegories, suited only to tickle men’s ears, must be sought from
others.  <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) Isychius, after having
pretended that the fat represented spiritual affections, soon afterwards
metamorphoses it into gross appetites. Others suppose that Christ was
designed by it. Others understand by it that the grossness or fatness of
our flesh must be refined by the fire of the Spirit, that it may be
mortified unto God. This simple meaning satisfies me, that, when the Law
permitted them to eat the sacred meats, an exception was added, which
left the best portion in God’s hands; secondly, that the part which
might have been most attractive to the greedy, was consumed in the fire
as a restraint upon their gluttony. The eating of blood is here
prohibited, as also elsewhere, because it was consecrated to God in
order to make expiation; but there was another and higher reason why it
was forbidden, of which mention was made in <span
id="iii.x.iv-p46.4"></span>[Genesis
9](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#000.md)<span id="iii.x.iv-p46.4"></span>,
and which must be again handled in our exposition of the Sixth
Commandment.

<span id="iii.x.iv-p46"></span> Abundance of these may be found
collected by Lorinus. Bonar says, “Observe that all these portions of
the animal are the richest; and also deep-seated, near the heart. In an
offering of thanks and fellowship, nothing was more appropriate than to
enjoin that the pieces presented should be those seated *deep within.”*
