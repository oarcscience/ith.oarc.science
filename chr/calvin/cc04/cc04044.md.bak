id="iii.iii.i-p24.2"></span>[Exodus
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iii.i-p24.2"></span>.** *Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.*
When he calls graven things, statues, and pictures, by the name of gods,
he shews the object and sum of the Second Commandment, viz., that God is
insulted when He is clothed in a corporeal image. Moreover, the name of
God is transferred to idols, according to common parlance, and the
corrupt opinion of the Gentiles; not that unbelievers thought that the
Deity was included in the corruptible material, but because they
imagined that it was nearer to them, if some earthly symbol of its
presence were standing before their eyes. In this sense, they called the
images of the gods their gods; because they thought they could not
ascend to the heights in which the Deity dwelt, unless they mounted by
these earthly aids. There is no doubt but that he comprehends by
*synecdoche,* all kinds of images, when he forbids the making of molten
gods; because metal is no more abominated by God than wood, or stone, or
any other material, out of which idols are usually made; but, inasmuch
as the insane zeal of superstition is the more inflamed by the value of
the material or the beauty of the workmanship, Moses especially
condemned molten gods. All question on this point is removed by the
fourth passage here cited, wherein the Israelites are forbidden to make
gods of silver or gold, viz., because idolaters indulge themselves more
fully in their worship of very precious idols, by the external splendor
of which all their senses are ravished. To the same effect is the third
passage, in which mention is not, only made of graven images, but there
is also added the name of a statue  <span id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md)
or figured stone; for, although some expound these words as referring to
a pavement, yet I have no doubt but that all monuments are included in
them, wherein foolish men think that they have God in some measure
visible, and therefore that they express all sculptures and pictures by
which the spiritual worship of God is corrupted. For the object of Moses
is to restrain the rashness of men, lest they should travesty God’s
glory by their imaginations; for another clause is immediately added, “I
am the Lord your *God,*” in which God reminds them that He is despoiled
of His due honor, whenever men devise anything earthly or carnal
respecting Him. The word <span id="iii.iii.i-p25.2"></span>מצבה,  <span
id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) *matsebah,* is sometimes used in a good
sense; whence it follows, that no other statues are here condemned,
except those which are erected as representations of God. The same also
is the case as to the polished stone,  <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) viz., when it receives a consecration,
which may attract men’s minds to regard it in a religious light, so as
to worship God in the stone. But both in the second and third passages,
Moses teaches men that as soon as they imagine anything gross or
terrestrial in the deity, they altogether depart from the true God. And
this is also expressed in the word <span
id="iii.iii.i-p27.5"></span>אלילים, *elilim,* which embraces in it
statues, stones, and graven images, as well as molten gods. Some think
that this word is compounded of <span id="iii.iii.i-p27.6"></span>אל*,*
*al*  <span id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) the negative particle, and
<span id="iii.iii.i-p28.3"></span>אל, *el,* God. Others translate it “a
thing of nought;” the Greeks and Latins have rendered it *“*idols.” It
is plain, that the false representations, which travesty God, are so
called to mark them with disgrace and ignominy. But, since the
superstitious cease not to gloss over their errors with cavils, God is
not content with this opprobrious name, but adds others also, respecting
which their pretext was more specious; that we may know that whatsoever
withdraws us from His spiritual service, or whatsoever men introduce
alien from His nature, is repudiated by Him. In the fourth passage, the
*antithesis* must be noted, which will presently be explained more
fully, viz., when God forbids them to make gods of corruptible
materials, since He has “spoken from heaven;” in which words He
signifies that all are doing wrong, who, when they ought to look up to
heaven, tie down their own minds as well as Him to earthly elements.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p25"></span> *A.V.* “a standing image.” *Margin,
“pillar:”* or “image of stone.” *Margin, “*figured stone, *Heb.* a stone
of picture."

<span id="fn_89"></span>[90](cc04044.htm#fr_89.md) <span

<span id="iii.iii.i-p26"></span> The same word occurs in <span

[22](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#022.md)<span id="iii.iii.i-p26.2"></span>,
where the *AV*. has *pillar,* and where the narrative shews that no
idolatry was meant. — *W*.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[91](cc04044.htm#fr_90.md) <span

*C polished. S.M., figured. AV, image of stone,* and in. the margin,
*figured, stone. V,* <span id="iii.iii.i-p27.2"></span>*insignem. S.M*
quotes Rabbinical interpreters, who explain the root <span
id="iii.iii.i-p27.3"></span>שכה as meaning to imagine; and the noun as
somewhat painted, or fashioned after an imagination. The root does not
occur in Hebrew, but is preserved in Arabic, where it means to form an
obscure resemblance. Hence in Simon’s Lexicon, the words <span
id="iii.iii.i-p27.4"></span>אבן משכית, are interpreted as meaning such a
stone as an Egyptian obelisk, with its hieroglyphics. — *W.*

<span id="fn_91"></span>[92](cc04044.htm#fr_91.md) <span
id="iii.iii.i-p27.7"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.i-p28"></span> So *S.M.* says “Some think this word
compounded of <span id="iii.iii.i-p28.1"></span>אל, *not,* and <span
id="iii.iii.i-p28.2"></span>אל, *God,* as much as to say, those who are
not gods; but others interpret it to mean an empty thing, and that which
profiteth not.” Lexicographers observe that the same word occurs in
Syriac, in which language it means *weak* either in body or mind, and is
therefore a fit epithet for designating idols. — *W*
