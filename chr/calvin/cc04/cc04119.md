<span id="iii.x.xi-p2"></span><span id="iii.x.xi-p2.1"></span>[Leviticus
7:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#001)<span id="iii.x.xi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xi-p3"></span>**1.** Likewise this *is* the law of the
trespass offering: it *is* most holy.

<span id="iii.x.xi-p4"></span>**1.** Ista autem est lex hostiae pro
delicto: sanctificatio sanctificationum est.

<span id="iii.x.xi-p5"></span>**2.** In the place where they kill the
burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood
thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.

<span id="iii.x.xi-p6"></span>**2.** Quo in loco mactabunt hostiam
holocausti, mactabunt hostiam pro delicto, et sanguinem ejus sparget
super altare per circuitum.

<span id="iii.x.xi-p7"></span>**3.** And he shall offer of it all the
fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,

<span id="iii.x.xi-p8"></span>**3.** Totum vero adipem ejus offeret ex
ea, caudam, et adipem operientem intestina.

<span id="iii.x.xi-p9"></span>**4.** And the two kidneys, and the fat
that *is* on them, which *is* by the flanks, and the caul *that is*
above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:

<span id="iii.x.xi-p10"></span>**4.** Duos quoque renes, et adipem qui
est super illos qui est prope ilia, et fibram super jecur, cum renibus
removebit.

<span id="iii.x.xi-p11"></span>**5.** And the priest shall burn them
upon the altar *for* an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it *is* a
trespass offering.

<span id="iii.x.xi-p12"></span>**5.** Adolebitque illa sacerdos super
altare oblationem ignitam Jehovae: oblatio pro delicto est.

<span id="iii.x.xi-p13"></span> 

<span id="iii.x.xi-p14"></span><span id="iii.x.xi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xi-p15"></span>**1.** *Likewise this is the law.* I have
just confessed that I do not sufficiently understand how these two
words, <span id="iii.x.xi-p15.1"></span>חטאה, *chateah,* and <span
id="iii.x.xi-p15.2"></span>אשם*, asham,* differ from each other; and I
have therefore followed the sense which is commonly received, and called
them the sin and the trespass-offering, (*hostiam pro peccato vel pro
delicto.*) Although in this second kind of offering he commands the same
ceremony to be observed as in the former one, yet he mentions some
things which he had before omitted, such as the sprinkling of blood
around the altar, the offering of the fat, kidneys, etc., which had not
been before expressed. The sum amounts to this, that they were to
sacrifice in the same manner, and with the same rites for sin as for
trespass, and make not the smallest alteration in the rule laid down for
them.
