<span id="ii.vi.ii-p20"></span>**<span
id="ii.vi.ii-p20.2"></span>[Deuteronomy
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#009)<span
id="ii.vi.ii-p20.2"></span>.** *Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard.* These
four precepts, which all condemn strange medleys, I doubt not to be
supplements of the First Commandment; and the reason, which is subjoined
in Deuteronomy, directs us to this, where God declares that the produce
of the seed and of the vineyard is polluted, if there be divers
mixtures. Whence it appears that nothing else is demanded but that they
should cultivate purity. The word indeed, which Moses uses, means to
“*sanctify,*” <span id="ii.vi.ii-p20.3"></span>קדש *kadesh;* but, by
*antiphrasis,* it is taken for to “*contaminate.*” To the same effect is
what follows, that they should not plough with an ox and an ass
together; for this diversity is forbidden on no other account, but
because men contract some defilement as soon as they depart from
simplicity. Yet, if any one thinks otherwise, I shall not strongly
contend with him. It might indeed be objected, that when God forbids
animals to be used promiscuously, so that those of different kinds
should not be mixed together, He has regard to chastity,  <span
id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29) and that, by forbidding the fields to be
sown with divers seeds, and garments to be woven of divers materials, He
would prevent frauds. But the more simple explanation is, that the
people were thus retained in purity, lest they should accustom
themselves to corrupt habits, and lest they should bring in strange
rites from various quarters, or seek, with depraved curiosity, for
mixtures which might at length invade the worship of God. For if animals
of different species are joined together, the integrity of nature is
corrupted, and an adulterine offspring is produced, which degenerates
from the institution of God; but, if various kinds of seed should be
mixed together, or if a garment should be woven of linen and wool, there
would be no danger of deception or fraud in so manifest a matter. It is
probable, therefore, that the end which, as I have said, was proposed by
God was, that, by cultivating natural and simple habits all their life
through, they should keep themselves pure and uncorrupted from every
strange vice. On this account Scripture compares strange doctrines to
leaven, since by their additions or curtailings they corrupt the pure
word of God. (<span id="ii.vi.ii-p21.3"></span>[Mt
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#011)<span
id="ii.vi.ii-p21.3"></span>.) And this was by no means a useless
discipline; when, in trifles, and almost things of nought, the rein was
applied to them, so that they should not decline from purity in the very
least degree. It was a small matter to interweave a thin thread with a
thicker one, and perchance such a process would have been profitable for
their general advantage; in some fields, too, a better crop is grown, if
the seed is compounded of pure wheat, and some other sort of grain
(*siligine*)*,* as also the union of the horse and ass has been approved
of, since thus mules are produced. But God would not allow these things
amongst His ancient people, lest, sinking by degrees to greater license,
they should at length addict themselves to the practice and customs of
the heathen. He therefore uses this preface: “Ye shall keep my
statutes,” (<span id="ii.vi.ii-p21.4"></span>[Le
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#019)<span
id="ii.vi.ii-p21.4"></span>;) from whence we gather that the people were
surrounded with fixed barriers, lest they should defile themselves with
foreign vices, and imitate the nations, from which they had been
separated. Wherefore this is the sum, that they should abide in God’s
statutes.
