<span id="iii.ix.iii-p3"></span>**16.** And in the fourteenth day of the
first month *is* the passover of the LORD.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p4"></span>**16.** Mense autem primo decima quarta
die mensis, Pesah est Jehovae.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p5"></span>**17.** And in the fifteenth day of this
month *is* the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p6"></span>**17.** Et in decimo quinto die mensis
hujus solennitas: septem diebus panis infermentatorum comedetur.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p7"></span>**18.** In the first day *shall be* an
holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work *therein*:

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p8"></span>**18.** Die primo convocatio sancta
erit: omne servile non facietis.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p9"></span>**19.** But ye shall offer a sacrifice
made by fire *for* a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks,
and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you
without blemish:

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p10"></span>**19.** Offeretis autem oblationem
ignitam, et holocaustum Jehovae juvencos fihos bovis duos, et arietem
unum, et septem agnos anniculos: immaculati erunt vobis.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p11"></span>**20.** And their meat offering *shall
be of* flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a
bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p12"></span>**20.** Et minha eorum erit simila
permixta oleo, tres decimae in singulos juvencos, et duas decimas in
singulos arietes facietis.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p13"></span>**21.** A several tenth deal shalt thou
offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p14"></span>**21.** Singulas decimas facies in
agnos singulos in septem agnis.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p15"></span>**22.** And one goat *for* a sin
offering, to make an atonement for you.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p16"></span>**22.** Et hircum in sacrificium pro
peccato unum, ad expiandum vos.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p17"></span>**23.** Ye shall offer these beside the
burnt offering in the morning, which *is* for a continual burnt
offering.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p18"></span>**23.** Praeter holocaustum matutinum:
quod est holocaustum juge, facietis ista.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p19"></span>**24.** After this manner ye shall
offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made
by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the
continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p20"></span>**24.** Secundum haec facietis singulis
diebus septem dierum, panem oblationis ignitae odoris quietis Jehovae:
ultra holocaustum juge fiet, et libamen ejus.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p21"></span>**25.** And on the seventh day ye shall
have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p22"></span>**25.** Septimo autem die convocatio
sancta erit vobis: omne opus servile non facietis.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p23"></span>**26.** Also in the day of the
firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your
weeks *be out,* ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no
servile work:

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p24"></span>**26.** Porro die primitiarum quando
offeretis minham novato Jehovae in hebdomadibus vestris, convocatio
sancta erit vobis: omne opus servile non facietis.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p25"></span>**27.** But ye shall offer the burnt
offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram,
seven lambs of the first year;

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p26"></span>**27.** Et offeretis holocaustum in
odorem quietis Jehovah: juvencos filios bovis duos, arietem unum, et
septem agnos anniculos.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p27"></span>**28.** And their meat offering of
flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth
deals unto one ram,

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p28"></span>**28.** Et oblationem eorum similam
permixtam oleo, tres decimas in singulos juvencos, duas decimas per
arietes singulos.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p29"></span>**29.** A several tenth deal unto one
lamb, throughout the seven lambs;

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p30"></span>**29.** Singulas decimas per agnos
singulos, septem agnis.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p31"></span>**30.** *And* one kid of the goats, to
make an atonement for you.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p32"></span>**30.** Hircum caprarum unum ad
expiandum vos.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p33"></span>**31.** Ye shall offer *them* beside
the burnt offering, and his meat offering, (they shall be unto you
without blemish) and their drink offerings.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p34"></span>**31.** Praeter holocaustum juge et
minham ejus facietis: immaculati erunt vobis et libamina eorum.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p35"></span> 

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p36"></span><span id="iii.ix.iii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p37"></span>**16.** *And in the fourteenth day.* It
is true that the instruction here given has some connection with the
feast of the passover, but since the sacrifices are avowedly treated of,
and no mention is made of its other observances, except in this place, I
have connected it with the continual sacrifice, as its concomitant or
part. Moses cursorily refers, indeed, to what we have already seen,
*i.e.,* that the people should abstain from leaven for seven days, and
eat unleavened bread; but he afterwards descends to the main point of
which he here proposed to treat, viz., that the people should slay two
bullocks as a burnt-offering, a ram, and seven lambs, together with a
goat for a sin-offering; and that this sacrifice should be repeated
through the whole week. In order, then, that the reverence paid to the
passover should be increased, this extraordinary sacrifice was added to
the continual one, partly that they might thus be more and more
stimulated to devote themselves to God; partly that they might
acknowledge how familiarly He had embraced them with His favor, inasmuch
as He took these offerings from their flocks and herds, and required the
sacred feast to be prepared for Him out of their cellars and granaries
also; partly, too, that professing themselves to be worthy of eternal
death, they should fly to Him to ask for pardon, and at the same time
should understand that there was but one way of reconciliation, *i.e.,*
when God should be propitiated by sacrifice.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p38"></span><span id="iii.ix.iii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p39"></span>**26.** *Also in the day of
thefirst-fruits.* Moses delivers the same commandment as to another
festival, viz., that on which they offered their first-fruits. Then,
also, he instructs them, the continual sacrifice was to be increased by
the addition of two bullocks, one ram, seven lambs, a goat for a
sin-offering, together with the *minha* and a libation, with the object,
of which I have already spoken. A perplexing difficulty here arises,
because in <span id="iii.ix.iii-p39.1"></span>[Leviticus
23](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#000.md)<span id="iii.ix.iii-p39.1"></span>,
one bullock is mentioned instead of two, and, on the contrary, two rams
instead of one.  <span id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) Some think that
an option was left to the priests in this matter; but when I consider
how precisely God’s commands were given in everything, I question
whether such an alternative was left to their discretion. The notion
that God had once been content with a single bullock, as some think,
because they were not abundant in the desert, appears to me a
subterfuge. I confess I do not know how to get out of this difficulty,
unless perhaps we say, that inasmuch as sufficiently exact provision had
been made, in all other particulars, that nothing should be done without
reason, in this respect only they were reminded that God in Himself
cares not for greater or less victims. Nor does any reverence prevent us
from saying that, as it sometimes happens in minor matters, a wrong
number may have crept in from the carelessness of scribes;  <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) and this is probably the most natural
solution. The more correct reading, in my opinion, is, that they should
offer two bullocks and one ram; but since it is elsewhere explained why
God appointed this day, he only briefly recites here: “When they bring
the *fainha* with the first-fruits."

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p40"></span> “Josephus and Maimonides understand
that they were distinct sacrifices. Aben-Ezra and others think that it
was left to the priest which he would offer.” — Brightwell on the
Pentateuch, *in loco*.

<span id="iii.ix.iii-p41"></span> The conjecture of *C.* receives no
support from the modern collections of various readings; for though the
number *two* is wanting in one of Kennicott’s *MSS.,* the word for
bullocks is in the plural in that same *MS.;* and the two most ancient
versions, viz., the *LXX.* and the *Syriac* agree with the received text
both here and in <span id="iii.ix.iii-p41.1"></span>[Le
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#008.md)<span
