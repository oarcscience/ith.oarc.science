<span id="ii.vii.ii-p3"></span>**1.** And the LORD spake unto Moses and
to Aaron, saying unto them,

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p4"></span>**1.** Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen et
Aharon, dicendo ad eos:

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p5"></span>**2.** Speak unto the children of Israel,
saying, These *are* the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts
that *are* on the earth.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p6"></span>**2.** Loquimini ad filios Israel,
dicendo, Haec sunt animalia quae comedetis ex omnibus animalibus quae
sunt super terram:

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p7"></span>**3.** Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and
is clovenfooted, *and* cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye
eat.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p8"></span>**3.** Omne dividens ungulam et findens
fissuram ungularum, et ruminans inter animalia, illud come-detis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p9"></span>**4.** Nevertheless these shall ye not
eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: *as* the
camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he *is*
unclean unto you.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p10"></span>**4.** Veruntamen hoc non comedetis ex
his quae ruminant, et ex his quae dividunt ungulam, camelum, quia
ruminat, et ungulam ipse non divi-dit: immundus erit vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p11"></span>**5.** And the coney, because he cheweth
the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he *is* unclean unto you.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p12"></span>**5.** Et cuniculum: quia ruminat, et
ungulam non dividit, immundus erit vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p13"></span>**6.** And the hare, because he cheweth
the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he *is* unclean unto you.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p14"></span>**6.** Et leporem: quia ruminat, et
ungulam non dividit, imnmndus erit vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p15"></span>**7.** And the swine, though he divide
the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he *is*
unclean to you.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p16"></span>**7.** Suem quoque: quia dividit
ungulam, et findit fissuram ungulae, ipse vero non ruminat, immundus
erit vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p17"></span>**8.** Of their flesh shall ye not eat,
and their carcase shall ye not touch; they *are* unclean to you.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p18"></span>**8.** De carne eorum non comedetis,
neque cadaver eorum tangetis: immunda erunt vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p19"></span>**9.** These shall ye eat of all that
*are* in the waters: Whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in
the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p20"></span>**9.** Hoe autem comedetis ex omnibus
quae sunt in aquis: onmia quibus sunt pinnae et squamae in aquis maris,
et in fluminibus, illa comedetis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p21"></span>**10.** And all that have not fins and
scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters,
and of any living thing which *is* in the waters, they *shall be* an
abomination unto you:

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p22"></span>**10.** Omnia vero quibus non sunt
pinnae et squamae in mari, et in fluminibus, tam de omni reptili
aquatili, quam de omni anima vivente quae est in aquis: abominatio erunt
vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p23"></span>**11.** They shall be even an
abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have
their carcases in abomination.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p24"></span>**11.** Abominatio, inquam, erunt vobis:
de carne eorum non comedetis, et cadaver eorum abomina-bimini.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p25"></span>**12.** Whatsoever hath no fins nor
scales in the waters, that *shall be* an abomination unto you.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p26"></span>**12.** Quicquid non habet pinnas et
squamas in aquis, abominatio erit vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p27"></span>**13.** And these *are they which* ye
shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they
*are* an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p28"></span>**13.** Haec autem abominabimini ex
volatilibus, (non comedetur: quia abominatio sunt:) aquilam, et

after his kind;

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p30"></span>**14.** Et vulturem, et milvum secundum
speciem suam.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p31"></span>**15.** Every raven after his kind;

suam.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p33"></span>**16.** And the owl, and the night hawk,
and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,

noctuam, et larum: et accipitrem secundum speciem suam.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p35"></span>**17.** And the little owl, and the
cormorant, and the great owl,

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p36"></span>**17.** Et nycticoracem, et mergulum, et
ibin,

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p37"></span>**18.** And the swan, and the pelican,
and the gier-eagle,

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p38"></span>**18.** Et porphyrionem, et pellicanum,
et cygnum,

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p39"></span>**19.** And the stork, the heron after
her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.

speciem suam, et upupam, et vespertilionem.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p41"></span>**20.** All fowls that creep, going upon
*all* four, *shall be* an abomination unto you.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p42"></span>**20.** Omne reptile alatum ambulans
super quatuor pedes, abominatio erit vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p43"></span>**21.** Yet these may ye eat of every
flying creeping thing that goeth upon *all* four, which have legs above
their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p44"></span>**21.** Veruntamen hoc comedetis ex omni
reptili alato quod gradietur super quatuor pedes, cui sunt crura super
pedes suos, quibus saliant super terram.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p45"></span>**22.** *Even* these of them ye may eat;
the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the
beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p46"></span>**22.** Haec ex illis comedetis,
locustam juxta speciem suam, et attacum juxta speciem suam, et
ophiomacum secundum speciem suam, et bruchum secundum speciem suam.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p47"></span>**23.** But all *other* flying creeping
things, which have four feet, *shall be* an abomination unto you.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p48"></span>**23.** Omne autem reliquum reptile
alatum cui sunt quatuor pedes, abominatio erit vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p49"></span>**24.** And for these ye shall be
unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until
the even.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p50"></span>**24.** Et his polluetis vos: quicunque
tetigerit cadaver eorum, immundus erit usque ad vesperam

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p51"></span>**25.** And whosoever beareth *ought* of
the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the
even.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p52"></span>**25.** Et quicunque portaverit
cadavera, lavabit vestimenta sua, et immundus erit usque advesperam.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p53"></span>**26.** *The carcases* of every beast
which divideth the hoof, and *is* not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud,
*are* unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p54"></span>**26.** Omne animal quod dividit
ungulam, et fissuram non findit., et non ruminat, immunda erunt vobis:
quicunque tetigerit ea, immundus erit.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p55"></span>**27.** And whatsoever goeth upon his
paws, among all manner of beasts that go on *all* four, those *are*
unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until
the even.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p56"></span>**27.** Et quicquid graditur super volas
suas inter omnes feras quae gradiuntur super quatuor pedes, immunda
erunt vobis: quicunque tetigerit cadavera eorum, immundus erit usque ad
vesperam.

of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they
*are* unclean unto you.

eorum, lavabit vestimenta, immundusque erit usque ad vesperam: immunda
erunt vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p59"></span>**29.** These also *shall be* unclean
unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the
weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p60"></span>**29.** Et haec vobis immunda erunt
inter reptilia quae reptant super terram, mustella, et mus, et rubeta
secundum speciem suam.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p61"></span>**30.** And the ferret, and the
chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p62"></span>**30.** Et mygale, et chameleon, et
stellio, et lacerta, et talpa.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p63"></span>**31.** These *are* unclean to you among
all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be
unclean until the even.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p64"></span>**31.** Ista immunda sunt vobis inter
omnia reptilia: quicunque tetigerit illa postquam mortua fuerit,
im-mundus erit usqne ad vesperam.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p65"></span>**32.** And upon whatsoever *any* of
them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether *it
be* any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoeve*r*
vessel *it be,* wherein *any* work is done, it must be put into water,
and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p66"></span>**32.** Et omne super quod tetigerit
aliquid ex eis postquam mortua fuerint, immudum erit, tam vas lineum
quam vestis, aut pellis, aut saccus: omne vas in quo fieri solet opus,
in aquam mittetur, et immundum erit usque ad vesperam, et mundabitur.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p67"></span>**33.** And every earthen vessel,
whereinto *an.y* of them falleth, whatsoever *is* in it shall be
unclean; and ye shall break it.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p68"></span>**33.** Omne praeterea vas testaceum
intra quod occiderit aliquid ex eis, quicquid erit in illo immundum
erit, et ipsum confringetis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p69"></span>**34.** Of all meat which may be eaten,
*that* on which *such* water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that
may be drunk in every *such* vessel shall be unclean.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p70"></span>**34.** Omnis cibus qui comeditur, super
quem venerit aqua, immundus erit, et omnis potus qui potatur in omni
vase impuro, imnmndus erit.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p71"></span>**35.** And every *thing* whereupon *any
part* of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; *whether it be* oven,
or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: *for* they *are* unclean,
and shall be unclean unto you.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p72"></span>**35.** Et omne super quo ceciderit
quicquam de cadavere eorum, imundum erit: clibanus et chytro-podes
diruentur, immunda sunt, et immunda erunt vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p73"></span>**36.** Nevertheless a fountain or pit,
*wherein there is* plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which
toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p74"></span>**36.** Veruntamen fons et cisterna
congregationis aquarum erit munda: at quod tetigerit cadaver eorum,
immundum erit.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p75"></span>**37.** And if *any part* of their
carcase fall upon any sowing-seed which is to be sown, it *shall be*
clean.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p76"></span>**37.** Praeterea si ceciderit quicquam
de cadavere eorum super aliquod semen satum, quod seminabi-tur, mundum
erit.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p77"></span>**38.** But if *any* water be put upon
the seed, and *any part* of their carcase fall thereon, it *shall be*
unclean unto you.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p78"></span>**38.** At quum fusa fuerit aqua super
semen, et ceciderit quicquam de cadavere eorum super illud, immundum
erit vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p79"></span>**39.** And if any beast of which ye may
eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until
the even.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p80"></span>**39.** Quum autem mortuum fuerit
aliquod animal quod sit vobis in cibum, qui tetigerit cadaver ejus,
immundus erit usque ad vesperam.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p81"></span>**40.** And he that eateth of the
carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he
also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be
unclean until the even.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p82"></span>**40.** Et qui comederit de cadavere
ejus, lavabit vestimenta sua, immundusque erit usque ad vesperam: is
quoque qui extulerit cadaver, lavabit vestimenta sua, atque immundus
erit usque ad vesperam.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p83"></span>**41.** And every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth *shall be* an abomination; it shall not be
eaten.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p84"></span>**41.** Et omne reptile reptans super
terram, abominatio est, non comedetur.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p85"></span>**42.** Whatsoever goeth upon the belly,
and whatsoever goeth upon *all* four, or whatsoever hath more feet among
all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat;
for they *are* an abomination.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p86"></span>**42.** Quicquid item graditur super
pectus, et quicquid incedit super quatuor aut plures pedes inter omnia
reptilia quae reptant super terram, non comedetis: quia abominatio sunt.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p87"></span>**43.** Ye shall not make yourselves
abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make
yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p88"></span>**43.** Ne impuras reddatis animas
vestras in omni reptili quod reptat, nec polluatis vos in eis, neque
coinquinetis vos per ea.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p89"></span>**44.** For I *am* the LORD your God: ye
shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I *am*
holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping
thing that creepeth upon the earth.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p90"></span>**44.** Quia ego Jehova Deus vester,
sanctificate ergo vos, et estote sancti, quia sanctus sum: et ne
polluatis animas vestras per aliqua reptilia quae reptant super terram.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p91"></span>**45.** For I *am* the LORD that
bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall
therefore be holy, for I *am* holy.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p92"></span>**45.** Ego enim sum Jehova, qui eduxi
vos e terra AEgypti, ut essem vobis in Deum, et essetis sancti, quia
sanctus sum.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p93"></span>**46.** This *is* the law of the beasts,
and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters,
and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p94"></span>**46.** Haec est lex animalium
terrestrium, et volatilium, atque omnium animalium viventium qae
reptant, et omnium animantium reptantium super terram.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p95"></span>**47.** To make a difference between the
unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the
beast that may not be eaten.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p96"></span>**47.** Ad distinguendum inter im-mundum
et mundum, et inter bes-tias qum comedi possunt, et bestias qum comedi
non possunt.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p97"></span> 

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p98"></span><span id="ii.vii.ii-p98.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p99"></span>**2.** *These are the beasts which ye
shall eat.* The holy fathers, before the birth of Moses, knew what
animals were unclean; of which fact Noah afforded a manifest proof,
when, by God’s command, he took into the ark seven pairs of the clean
animals, and offered of them his sacrifice of thanksgiving to God.
Certainly he could not have obeyed the command of God, unless he had
either been taught by secret inspiration, or unless this tradition had
descended to him from his forefathers. But there is nothing absurd in
the notion that God, desiring to confirm the traditional distinction,
appointed certain marks of difference whereby its observation might be
more scrupulously attended to, and lest any transgression of it should
creep in through ignorance. For God also consecrated the Sabbath to
Himself from the creation of the world, and desired it to be observed by
the people before the promulgation of the Law; and yet afterwards the
peculiar holiness of the day was more distinctly expressed. Besides, the
clean animals are here distinguished from the unclean, by name as well
as by signs. The proper names, which are recited, are of little service
to us now-a-days; because many species which are common in the East, are
unknown elsewhere; and it was therefore easy for Jews  <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) who were born and had lived in distant
countries, to fall into error about them; whilst, on the other hand, the
more bold they are in their conjectures, the less are they to be
trusted. As to many of them, I acknowledge that there is no ambiguity,
especially as to the tame animals, or those that are to be found
everywhere, or that have plain descriptions of them given in the Bible.
A positive knowledge then is only to be sought from the signs which are
here laid down; viz., that the animals which have cloven hoofs, and
which ruminate, are clean: and that those are unclean in which either of
these two things is wanting; that either sea or river fish, which have
fins and scales, are clean. No such distinction as to birds is given,
but only the unclean are named, which it was sinful to eat. Lastly,
mention is made of reptiles. As to details, if there be anything worthy
of observation, the place to consider them will be further on; let us
now remember, in general, what I have before touched upon, viz., that
whilst the Gentiles might eat every kind of food, many were forbidden to
the Jews, in order that they might learn in their very food to cultivate
purity; and this was the object of their separation from ordinary
customs. Hence it arose that they use the word <span
id="ii.vii.ii-p100.2"></span>חלל, *chalal*  <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) both for “to make common,” and to
“contaminate;” and the word*,* <span id="ii.vii.ii-p101.6"></span>חול,
*chol,* signifies “polluted*,*” because it is opposed to anything holy
or set apart. It is true, indeed, that the Gentiles, by natural
instinct, have regarded with the utmost horror the eating of some of the
animals which are here forbidden; still, God would surround His people
with barriers, which must separate them from their neighbors.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p102"></span>Those who imagine that God here had
regard to their health, as if discharging the office of a Physician,
pervert by their vain speculation the whole force and utility of this
law. I allow, indeed, that the meats which God permits to be eaten are
wholesome, and best adapted for food; but, both from the preface, — in
which God admonished them that holiness was to be cultivated by the
people whom He had chosen, — as also from the (subsequent) abolition of
this law, it is sufficiently plain that this distinction of meats was a
part of that elementary instruction  <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) under which God kept His ancient people.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p104"></span>"Let no man therefore judge you (says
Paul) in meat or in drink, which are a shadow of things to come; but the
body is of Christ.” (<span id="ii.vii.ii-p104.1"></span>[Col
2:16-17](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.vii.ii-p104.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p105"></span>By which expressions he means, that
what was spiritual had been shadowed forth in the external rite of
abstaining from meats. To the same effect he elsewhere says, (<span
id="ii.vii.ii-p105.1"></span>[Ro
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.vii.ii-p105.1"></span>) that he knows and is persuaded,  <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) that in the Lord Jesus Christ there is
nothing unclean; viz., because Christ by his death has redeemed His
people from slavish subjection. Hence it follows, that the prohibition
of meats must be counted among the ceremonies, which were exercises in
the worship of God. But here a question arises, how it is reconcilable
that, even from the days of Noah, certain animals were unclean, and yet
that all without exception were allowed to be eaten? I cannot agree with
some in thinking that the distinction originally made by God grew
obsolete by degrees; for God, in excepting the eating of blood only,
makes a grant of whatsoever moves upon the earth as the food of the
posterity of Noah. I therefore restrict to the sacrifices that
uncleanness, with the knowledge of which the hearts of the Patriarchs
were then inspired, nor do I doubt but that it was as lawful for
Abraham, as well as for them, to eat swine’s flesh as the flesh of oxen.
Afterwards, when God imposed the yoke of the Law to repress the
licentiousness of the people, He somewhat curtailed this general
permission, not because He repented of His liberality; but because it
was useful to compel in this way to obedience these almost rude and
uncivilized people. But, since before the Law the condition of the
saints was the same as our own, it must be remembered, as I said before,
that, agreeably to the dictates of nature, they spontaneously avoided
certain foods, just as at present no one will hunt wolves or lions for
food, nor desire to eat serpents and other venomous animals. But the
object of this ordinance was different, viz., lest they who were God’s
sacred and peculiar people, should freely and promiscuously communicate
with the Gentiles.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p107"></span><span id="ii.vii.ii-p107.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p108"></span>**3** *Whatsoever parteth the hoof.*
Whilst I fear that but little confidence can be placed in the
allegories, in which many have taken delight; so I do not find any fault
with, nor even refuse that which has been handed down from the ancients,
 <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) viz., that by the cleaving of the
hoof is signified prudence in distinguishing the mysteries of Scripture,
and by the chewing of the cud serious meditation on its heavenly
doctrines; although I cannot approve of the subtlety  <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) which they add, viz., that those “rightly
divide the word” who have known how to elicit mystical senses from its
letter; because hence it has come to pass that they have allowed
themselves in all sorts of imaginations. I therefore embrace the more
simple notion, that they who only have a taste for the carnal sense, do
not divide the hoof; for, as Paul says, only “he that is spiritual
discerneth all things.” (<span id="ii.vii.ii-p110.2"></span>[1Co
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.vii.ii-p110.2"></span>*, margin.*) The chewing of the cud ought
to follow, duly to prepare and digest the spiritual food; for many gulp
down Scripture without profit, because they neither sincerely desire to
profit by it, nor seek to refresh their souls by it, as their
nourishment; but satisfied with the empty delights of knowledge, make no
efforts to conform their life to it. In the first clause, then, brutal
stupidity is condemned; in the other, the ambition and levity of curious
men.  <span id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) God, indeed, set before
Peter, in the vision, unclean animals as images and figures of the
Gentiles, (<span id="ii.vii.ii-p111.2"></span>[Ac
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.vii.ii-p111.2"></span>;) and therefore it is lawful, by probable
analogy, to transfer to men what is said about the animals. But why God
should have appointed the cloven hoof and rumination as signs, is no
more clear to me than why He should have forbidden their eating swine’s
flesh; unless, perchance, because the solid hoof is a sign of wildness;
whilst the animals which do not ruminate feed for the most part on filth
and excrement. We know that on this point there was much contention
immediately after the promulgation of the Gospel, because some of the
Jews, in their excessive devotion to the Law, and considering that the
distinction of meats was not to be reckoned among the, ceremonial
enactments, desired that the new Church should be bound by the same
trammels as had been imposed upon the ancient people. At length, by the
decree of the Apostles, permission was given to the Gentiles to eat all
kinds of meat, except only blood and things strangled, and that only for
a time, for the sake of avoiding offense, since the Jews would not
otherwise have been propitiated. Now, after what God Himself had
ordained respecting the distinction of meats had been abrogated, it was
an act of diabolical audacity to oblige men’s consciences by human laws,
and to prevent them from enjoying the liberty obtained by Christ.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p112"></span>Another question remains, how God
should pronounce anything which He has created to be unclean; for, if an
animal be rejected on account of its uncleanness, part of the reproach
redounds to the Author Himself. Besides, this rejection seems also to be
opposed to the first declaration of God, when, considering all things
which He had made, He acknowledged them to be “very good.” The solution
is, that no animal was ever unclean in itself; but that this merely
refers to its use. Thus in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
there was naturally neither fault nor harm, so that it should infect man
by its pollution, yet he contracted death from it on account of God’s
prohibition. Wherefore, also, in this passage, God does not condemn His
work in the animals, but, as to their being eaten, He would have them
accounted unclean, that the people may abominate that which is forbidden
them. In a word, it is only transgression which defiles: for the animals
have never changed their nature; but it was in God’s power to determine
what He would have to be lawful or unlawful. Thus another objection is
removed. Christ declares that

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p113"></span>"not that which goeth into the mouth
defileth a man ” *  
*(<span id="ii.vii.ii-p113.2"></span>[Mt
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.vii.ii-p113.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p114"></span>If any one should thence infer that
harmless animals are improperly condemned, we must reply that they are
not accounted unclean in themselves, but that the prohibition had a
different object. For that doctrine was always true, that

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p115"></span>"the kingdom of God is not meat and
drink,”  
(<span id="ii.vii.ii-p115.2"></span>[Ro
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.vii.ii-p115.2"></span>;)

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p116"></span>but, when God forbade the Israelites to
eat this or that kind of food, they were admonished by this ceremonial
precept how abominable is the inward corruption of the heart. But by
such elementary teaching they were prepared and led onwards to spiritual
doctrine, that they might know that nothing defiles a man except what
comes out of his mouth. Now-a-days the condition of believers is
different. for liberty is obtained for them, since Christ, having
abrogated the Law, has nailed

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p117"></span>"the handwriting of ordinances to his
cross.”  
(<span id="ii.vii.ii-p117.2"></span>[Col
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.vii.ii-p117.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p118"></span><span id="ii.vii.ii-p118.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p119"></span>**4** *Nevertheless these shall ye not
eat of.* He more clearly expresses what he had previously glanced at,
viz., that an animal, although it may ruminate, shall not be clean
unless it also cleaves the hoof; and, on the other hand, that the cloven
hoof will not be sufficient unless combined with rumination. In these
words Moses taught that partial and imperfect purity must not be
obtruded upon God. If any choose to think that rumination is the symbol
of internal purity, and the cloven hoof of external, his opinion will be
a probable one. Since this distinction has occurred to my mind, although
I have no taste for subtle speculations, I have thought it well to
mention it, yet leaving it free for any one to accept it or not.
Meanwhile we must hold it as certain, as I have lately said, that God
demands perfect cleanliness, undefiled by any admixture. But the
prohibition was most onerous to the Jews with respect to swine’s flesh,
because it is very well adapted for food, not only as being a pleasant
accompaniment of other meats, but because the working-classes are fed
upon it at a smaller cost. In this point, therefore, the religion of the
Jewish people was especially proved. For, when the soldiers of Antiochus
desired to force the people to an entire renunciation of the Law, they
only urged them to eat swine’s flesh  <span
id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) And hence the famous witticism of
Augustus, “I would rather be Herod’s pig than his son;”  <span
id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) because, whilst he abstained from pork,
he was the murderer of his children. But, in order that the Jews might
observe this prohibition more strictly, the very touch was also
forbidden them; so that it was not only wicked to taste swine’s flesh,
but even to touch it with their hands after the animal was killed. The
same rule did not apply to beef or mutton; for it is necessary to handle
the meat which is appointed for our food.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p122"></span><span id="ii.vii.ii-p122.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p123"></span>**9** *These shall ye eat of all that
are in the waters.* Here, also, some who know little of religion,
plausibly contend that God is acting the physician’s part, and
distinguishing wholesome from unwholesome food. But although their
opinion is sufficiently refuted by medical men themselves, yet, even if
I should admit what they desire, they reason badly. For the purpose of
God was other than to provide for the people’s health; and, because He
had to do with a rude people, He chose common marks, being admonished by
which they might gradually ascend to higher things. It would be useless
to follow the allegories which Isychius has invented  <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) and I would willingly bury in oblivion
these triflings, except that many have such a leaning to subtleties,
that sober views would scarcely please them, until the folly of these
allegories shall have been convicted. I will say nothing of the scales
and fins. If at first sight any should approve of what he says as to the
names of the fish being omitted, because the Church seeks not. a name
upon earth, and that the Church is signified by the fish, — let them
consider whether it is consistent that the Church should only exist in
the water; and, again, that the birds, which are nearer heaven, should
be excluded from this honor; thirdly, that the clean animals should be
rejected, as if they did not belong to the Church; lastly, that those
who by their contagion pollute the Church should be counted amongst the
elect, whose names are written in heaven; for certainly many of the fish
are unclean. Those who will not acquiesce in these perspicuous reasons,
I will allow to wander in their labyrinth. This simple view will satisfy
the moderate and teachable, that the fish are not named, because the
greater part of them were unknown to the Jews, whose country did not
produce many of the river-fish, since it scarcely had any river besides
the Jordan, whilst the sea-fish only visited the neighboring shores.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p125"></span><span id="ii.vii.ii-p125.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p126"></span>**13.** *And these are they which ye
shall have in abomination.* The species of birds and reptiles which are
forbidden, are such as common feeling almost naturally repudiates. And
assuredly God dealt with great indulgence towards His people, so as not
to weigh them down with too heavy burdens. But because man’s greediness
sometimes delights in monstrous food, He desired even in minor matters
to put the rein upon them, lest they should rush with heathen nations
into intemperance, whereby they would be polluted. For there was danger
lest, by devouring filthy animals, they should harden themselves to join
in various other corruptions. Another law is added, that they should not
only abstain from eating these unclean animals, but, if any such should
be killed, that they should not defile themselves by touching its
carcase; nay, that if any vessels should have come in contact with them,
those made of earth should be broken, and others should be washed. It
seems to be a trifling matter to enjoin, that if a mouse should have
been drowned in a vessel of water, the vessel itself should be unclean;
and the strictness appears excessive, that the Jews should be commanded,
 <span id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) if any such animal had fallen into
a vessel of wine, and had died there, not only to pour away the wine,
but also to destroy the vessel; and if it had been smothered in an oven,
or had lain in the hearth, to break down both of them; as if spiritual
infection reached even to things without life. But we must always
consider the intention of God: from whence we shall learn that He was
not so severe and exacting in unimportant things as to tie His people to
the observation of (superfluous)  <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md)
matters; but that these were acts of discipline whereby He might
accustom them to study purity, which is so generally neglected and
omitted among men. Now-a-days, also, we are commanded by the mouth of
Paul,

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p129"></span>"whether we eat, or drink, or
whatsoever we do, to do all to the glory of God,” (<span
id="ii.vii.ii-p129.1"></span>[1Co
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.vii.ii-p129.1"></span>;)

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p130"></span>but in this respect we differ from the
ancient people, that, being delivered from childish rudiments, we are
directed only to what is spiritual, viz., that meat and drink are
supplied to us by God, that we may serve in purity the Author of our
life. But it was necessary to stimulate the Jews in various ways that
they might be more attentive to this object; whilst God commanded them
to keep their houses free from all uncleanness, and to be diligent in
watching over the purity of their water, and all their vessels; that He
might constantly set before their eyes how diligently He would have them
to labor after true cleanliness; as follows in the end of the chapter.

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p131"></span><span id="ii.vii.ii-p131.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii.ii-p132"></span>**43** *Ye shall not make yourselves
abominable.* He does not invite them to take care of their health, nor
warn them of the danger of contracting’ diseases, but bids them beware
of defiling themselves. And a clearer explanation is subjoined, “For I
am the Lord your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves; for I am
holy.” Lest they should imagine that the main part of religion was
contained in external ceremonies, they were to consider the nature of
God; for, inasmuch as He is a Spirit, He would be worshipped only
spiritually. Thus holiness is only connected instrumentally with the
distinction of meats; since their abstinence had no other object than
that they should consecrate themselves to God. Therefore the
superstition of the Jews was inexcusable, when they satisfied themselves
with trifling observances;  <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) as if
one should learn the letters of the alphabet without applying them to
their use, and reading what is written. From their example we perceive
how eagerly men lay hold of everything they can to sustain them in their
hypocrisy, for they not only wrested to their earthly notions the things
which were profitable in the pursuit of true integrity of heart; but,
not content, with this, they heaped to themselves many supererogatory
rites;  <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) hence the water of
expiation, or lustration always in use, even when they were unconscious
of any pollution: hence their anxious labor in washing cups and
platters, that it might readily appear how constantly the perversity of
man abuses what God has appointed for the best of reasons.
