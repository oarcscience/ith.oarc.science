<span id="iii.v.i-p3"></span>**1.** And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak
unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none
be defiled for the dead among his people:

<span id="iii.v.i-p4"></span>**1.** Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Alloquere
sacerdotes filios Aharon, et dicito eis, Super animam non contaminabit
se quisquam vestrum it, populis suis:

<span id="iii.v.i-p5"></span>**2.** But for his kin that is near unto
him, *that is,* for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and
for his daughter, and for his brother,

<span id="iii.v.i-p6"></span>**2.** Sed super propinquo suo, propinquo
sibi, nempe super matre sua, et super patre suo, et super filio suo, et
super filia sua, et superfratre suo.,

<span id="iii.v.i-p7"></span>**3.** And for his sister a virgin, that is
nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

<span id="iii.v.i-p8"></span>**3.** Et super sorore sua virgine
propinqua sibi, quae non fuerit viro: super ea contaminabit se.

<span id="iii.v.i-p9"></span>**4.** *But* he shall not defile himself,
*being* a chief man among his people, to profane himself.

<span id="iii.v.i-p10"></span>**4.** Non contaminabit se in principe in
populis suis, ut polluat sese.

<span id="iii.v.i-p11"></span>**5.** They shall not make baldness upon
their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor
make any cuttings in their flesh.

<span id="iii.v.i-p12"></span>**5.** Non decalvabunt calvitium in capitc
suo, et extremitatem barbae suse non radent, et in carne sua non
incident ullam incisuram.

<span id="iii.v.i-p13"></span>**6.** They shall be holy unto their God,
and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD
made by fire, *and* the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore
they shall be holy.

<span id="iii.v.i-p14"></span>**6.** Sancti erunt Dco suo, neque
polluent nomen Dei sui: quia oblationes ignitas Jehovoe, et panem Dei
tui offerunt, proinde erunt sancti.

<span id="iii.v.i-p15"></span>**10.** And *he that is* the high priest
among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and
that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head,
nor rend his clothes;

<span id="iii.v.i-p16"></span>**10.** Sacerdos autem praecipuus inter
fratres suos super cujus caput fusum fuerit oleum unctionis, et
consecraverit manum suam ut induat vestes, caput suum non discooperiet,
et vestes suas non scindet.

<span id="iii.v.i-p17"></span>**11.** Neither shall he go in to any dead
body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;

<span id="iii.v.i-p18"></span>**11.** Et ad omnes animas mortui non
ingredietur, ne super patre quidem suo, ant matre sua, contaminabit se.

<span id="iii.v.i-p19"></span>**12.** Neither shall he go out of the
sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the
anointing oil of his God *is* upon him: I *am* the LORD.

<span id="iii.v.i-p20"></span>**12.** Et de sanctuario non ingredietur,
neque polluet sanctuarium Dei sui: quia corona olei unctionis Dei sui
est super eum. Ego Jehova.

<span id="iii.v.i-p21"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.i-p22"></span><span id="iii.v.i-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i-p23"></span>**7.** *They shall not take a wife.* The
third kind of purity is in marriage itself, that the priests’ home may
be chaste and free from all dishonor. At this time also God commands by
the mouth of Paul, that pastors should be chosen, who rule well their
own houses, whose wives are chaste and modest, and their children
well-behaved. (<span id="iii.v.i-p23.1"></span>[1Ti
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#002.md)<span id="iii.v.i-p23.1"></span>;
<span id="iii.v.i-p23.2"></span>Titus 1:6.) The same cause for this
existed under the Law, lest those appointed for the government of the
Church should be despised and looked down upon on account of their
domestic vices. But God most especially had regard to the priesthood of
Christ, that it should not be exposed to contempt. It was indeed
permitted that men should marry with impunity a woman divorced from her
husband; though in the sight of God such an union was unlawful. No law
forbade private individuals from marrying a deflowered woman; but what
was permitted to the multitude God condemned in the priests, in order to
withdraw them from every mark of infamy. And this reason is also
expressed when he says that He would have the priests holy, because He
has chosen them for Himself; for if the people had not reverenced them,
all religion would have been contemptible. Therefore that their dignity
might be preserved, He commands them to take diligent heed not to expose
themselves to ignominy. Finally, still more highly to commend reverence
to their holy office, He reminds them that it related to the welfare of
the whole people: “I the Lord (He says) do sanctify him,” <span
id="iii.v.i-p23.3"></span>[Le
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#015.md)<span id="iii.v.i-p23.3"></span>.
In these words He intimates that the grace of adoption, whereby they
were chosen as His heritage, was based on the priesthood.

<span id="iii.v.i-p24"></span><span id="iii.v.i-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i-p25"></span>**13.** *And he shall take a wife in her
virginity.* More is required in the high priest, viz., that he should
not marry a widow, nor a woman of any other tribe than his own. A
question may indeed arise as to the latter clause, whether the plural
word ought to be restricted to one tribe,  <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) whereas it is elsewhere applied to
all. But, if we examine it more closely, it is plain that “his peoples”
is equivalent to “of his people,” (*populares.*) But nothing peculiar
will be here required of the priest, if his wife is to be taken only
from the children of Abraham. I admit that the chief priests married
wives of Other tribes, as Elizabeth, sprung of the tribe of Judah,
married Zacharias; but, since the high priest is here distinguished from
all others, I do not see how it would follow that a law or privilege
referring to him should be observed by the whole posterity of Aaron. On
this point, however, I will not contend, if any one thing is otherwise.
But assuredly, since he presented the brightest type of Christ, it was
right that superior and more perfect holiness should be beheld in him.
 <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) For this was the tendency of
the restriction, that his wife, not having known another man, should
manifest the modesty worthy of her station and quality of sacred honor.
If any should object that the marriage of, an old priest with a young
girl was ridiculous and somewhat indecorous, as well as liable to many
inconveniences; I answer, that special regulations should be so
expounded as not to interfere with general principles. If a decrepit old
man falls in love with a young girl, it is a base and shameful lust;
besides he will defraud her if he marries her. Hence, too, will jealousy
and wretched anxiety arise; or, by foolishly and dotingly seeking to
preserve his wife’s love, he will cast away all regard for gravity. When
God forbade the high priest to marry any but a virgin, he did not wish
to violate this rule, which is dictated by nature and reason; but,
regard being had to age, He desired that modesty and propriety should be
maintained in the marriage, so that, if the priest were of advanced
years, he should marry a virgin not too far from his own age: but, if he
were failing and now but little fitted for marriage on account of his
old age, the law that he should marry a virgin was rather an exhortation
to celibacy, than that he should expose himself to many troubles and to
general ridicule.

<span id="iii.v.i-p28"></span><span id="iii.v.i-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i-p29"></span>**9.** *And the daughter of any priest.*
The moderation and chastity (required in the priest  <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190) .md) is extended also to his daughter;
and by *synecdoche* all that relates to good discipline is comprised
under a single head; viz., that his children should be educated in the
study of virtue, and in decent and pure morality. A heavy punishment is
denounced against a priest’s daughter if she should play the harlot,
because sacrilege would be combined with her disgraceful licentiousness.
But it is no light crime to violate God’s sanctuary; and, if the priest
had tolerated such an iniquity in his daughter, he would have been no
severe avenger of the same turpitude in strangers; nay, he would not
have been at liberty to punish crimes, unless he made a beginning in his
own house.
