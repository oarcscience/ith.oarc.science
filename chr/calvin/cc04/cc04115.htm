<p><a name="iii.x.vii-p31"></A><b>1.</b> <i>And if a soul sin.</i> The three kinds of offense, to which Moses refers in the beginning of the chapter, seem to differ much from each other; for the first, when a person concealed a matter which he knew, could not arise from error, yet I include this concealment of which he 				treats under the head of error, by supposing it to have been when a person should be induced by shame or fear to connive at any crime or offense respecting which he might be interrogated, and so, without any design of perjuring himself, but by blinding himself, should withhold what he would have said, if he had duly examined the matter. Yet these words must be more narrowly discussed, respecting the meaning of which men are not well agreed. Some think that the word <a name="iii.x.vii-p31.1"></A>&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">266</FONT></A>
 				 <i>alah, </i>is put for &#8220;execration,&#8221; as though it were said, if any shall have heard a misdoing or detestable crime worthy of execration; yet their gloss is contradicted by what immediately follows, &#8220;Whether he hath seen or known it.&#8221; Others indeed interpret it to mean an oath, yet improperly confine it to perjury, as if Moses stated that he was guilty who had heard a man perjuring himself, and had not opposed him, but 				had rather covered the perjury by his own connivance or silence. I rather subscribe, then, to their opinion who expound it as meaning &#8220;adjuration;&#8221; for the words will thus combine very well, &#8220;If any one, being summoned as a witness, shall have heard the voice of adjuration, whereby he shall be required in God&#8217;s name to answer truly as to the matter proposed, and from favor, or good nature, or any other false pretext, as if he were enveloped in a cloud of error, shall conceal what, if he had 				paid diligent attention, he well knew, he shall be guilty.&#8221; We must then here render the disjunctive particle as the conditional. Literally it is, &#8220;If any shall have heard the voice of adjuration, and (is) himself a witness.&#8221; But wherefore should he say, &#8220;if he hath been a witness,&#8221; and then add, &#8220;or have known it,&#8221; as if he referred to different things? What I have said squares very well, that a person becomes himself guilty, who, when summoned as a witness, does not answer to a matter of 				which he is cognizant. Now, what does hearing the voice of adjuration mean, unless you understand that he is adjured by the mouth of a judge? We must observe, too, that the three kinds of sin which are first enumerated have a connection with each other, since they speak of sinners who are infected by the uncleanness of others; for, after Moses had commanded generally that offenses committed in 				error should be expiated, he now adds what had not been stated explicitly enough, that those also required atonement who had been polluted by the defilements of others. Thus this first will accord very well with the other two, <i>i.e., </i>that if any should make himself an accomplice in the offense of another, by indirect perjury, he should be unclean until he had offered a propitiation; for this is what the expression &#8220;bear his iniquity&#8221; conveys; as 				if Moses had said that he contracts guilt who shall have concealed a crime, respecting which he had been interrogated as a witness.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.x.vii-p33"></A><a name="iii.x.vii-p33.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.x.vii-p34"></A><b>2.</b> <i>Or if a soul touch any unclean thing.</i> This precept seems not only to be superfluous but also absurd; for Moses had already shewn sufficiently how uncleanness contracted by touching a dead body, or any other unclean thing, was to be purged, and had prescribed an easy and inexpensive mode of purification. This repetition appears, therefore, to be useless. But to impose a heavier punishment on an offense which is extenuated by the pretext of error, than where there is no 				allusion to error, is unjust. But we must remember that not only is the uncleanness itself here punished, but; the inadvertence, from whence it arose that he who was polluted omitted the purification. For it may be that those who thus lie torpid in their sins pollute for a season the service of God. No wonder, then, that a heavier punishment is inflicted, where error, springing from supine and gross security, begets still more sins, that thus believers may be aroused to greater vigilance. Let 				the reader, therefore, recollect that the offense which is now adverted to did not consist in the mere touching of a dead body, but in the thoughtlessness itself; for if all would diligently meditate on the Law of God, forgetfulness would not so easily steal over them, whereby the distinction between right and wrong is lost. The same is the reason for the following ordinance, where Moses subjects to the same punishment any one who shall have touched an unclean or defiled man: thus the very 				contact of a woman at a particular period produces pollution.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.x.vii-p35"></A><a name="iii.x.vii-p35.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.x.vii-p36"></A><b>4.</b> <i>Or if a soul shall swear.</i> The Gulf is also ascribed to error and ignorance, when a person does inconsiderately what he has promised not to do; for the oath is not in that case violated, which would be criminal;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">267</FONT></A>
 				 but in this very carelessness there is enough of wrong, because sound religion would renew the recollection of the vow. Consequently, where no anxiety (to fulfill it) is shewn, there is no serious desire to do so. But this commandment was necessary, because it might often happen that men who had pledged their faith in a vow, and had broken it in thoughtlessness, would deem themselves released from every, and would in future give themselves up to indulgence, 				whereas they who arrive at such a pitch of licentiousness, harden themselves more and more, until at length they throw off all reverence for God. God would therefore have vows kept faithfully, lest those who despised them should thus rush into impiety. If then any one had thoughtlessly broken faith, he is commanded to make atonement to God; not on account of his levity, as some think, as if he had rashly promised what he might not, but on 				account of his neglect, because he had not given diligence to remember the vow at the proper time. Now if the Papists stupidly wrest this text after their custom, in order to establish the obligation of all kinds of vows, their confutation is easy; viz., that God requires this stedfastness only with respect to lawful vows duly made. We have already understood from the teaching of Moses, what is the rule of pious vow-making; whence we gather, that those which profane God&#8217;s name are by no means 				to be kept; for if we set out with doing wrong, obstinacy in it is doubly wicked. In this passage, therefore, &#8220;to do evil&#8221; is not to perform any improper action, but to undertake something which would otherwise be disagreeable and burdensome to the flesh; such as to diminish domestic expenditure, or to deprive one&#8217;s self of luxuries, or to determine upon abstinence from something which would gratify or profit us.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="iii.x.vii-p38"></A><a name="iii.x.vii-p38.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iii.x.vii-p39"></A><b>6.</b> <i>And he shall bring his trespass-offering.</i> He proceeds with what we have already been considering, as to the removal of guilt by sacrifice; but he begins to make a distinction between the poor and the rich, which distinction applies also to what has gone before; hence it 				appears that the order is not exactly observed by Moses, since the cases which he inserts seem to interrupt the thread of his discourse; yet the fact remains clear, that whosoever have fallen through error are unclean until they have offered an atonement. But what had been before omitted is here inserted, that the poor and needy are not to be pressed beyond the extent of their means; nay, the different grades of offering are appointed, so that he to whom it was not convenient to offer two 				turtle-doves, or pigeons, might be quit for a small measure of flour. Hence we infer that God&#8217;s only design was to shew the one true means of reconciliation to the people, that they might have recourse to the Mediator and His sacrifice; for the poor are here commanded to offer either two turtle-doves, or a small quantity of meal, which would propitiate God towards them, just as much as would the victim required of the rich. The citation,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">268</FONT></A>
 				 however, which our interpreters make from the poet is a lame one; viz., &#8220;Whoever shall have brought integrity of mind into the temples, makes a sacrifice of corn;&#8221; since this blind man did not see what was the object of sacrifices, and thus despised all kinds of propitiations, as if purity and innocency alone recommended men to God. We must remember, then, that the victims of themselves were of no importance, and yet that the ancient people were exercised in these 				ceremonies, to teach them that God can only be appeased by the payment of a ransom.</p>
