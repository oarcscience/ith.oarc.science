30:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#034.md)<span

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p2"></span>**34.** And the LORD said unto Moses,
Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; *these*
sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like
*weight*:

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p3"></span>**34.** Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen,
Accipe tibi aromata, stacten, et onychen, et galbanum, aromata, et thus
purum: ut pondus ponderi respondeat.

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p4"></span>**35.** And thou shalt make it a
perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered
together, pure *and* holy:

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p5"></span>**35.** Et facies ex eo suffimentum
aromaticum, opus aromatarii, mistum, purum et sanctum.

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p6"></span>**36.** And thou shalt beat *some* of
it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of
the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most
holy.

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p7"></span>**36.** Et contundes ex eo comminuendo:
ponesque ex eo coram testimonio in tabernaculo conventionis, in quo
conveniam tecum: sanctitas sanctitatum erit vobis.

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p8"></span>**37.** And *as for* the perfume which
thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the
composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p9"></span>**37.** Suffimentum quod facies
secundum compositionem ejus non facietis vobis: sanctitas tibi erit
Jehovae.

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p10"></span>**38.** Whosoever shall make like unto
that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p11"></span>**38.** Quisquis fecerit simile ad
adolendum ilhd, excidetur e populis suis.

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p12"></span> 

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p13"></span><span id="iii.iii.xxi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.xxi-p14"></span>**34.** *Take unto thee sweet spices.*
This oblation might have been noticed with the others, yet, since it
merely describes the composition of the incense, which is connected with
the altar of incense, and in fact is but an appendage to it, I have seen
no reason why I should separate them. Let the curious subtilely discuss,
if they please, the ingredients themselves; it is enough for me that
they were chosen at God’s will to make a very sweet smell. For I know
not whether it is likely, as some suppose, that galbanum  <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) is of a strong and disagreeable savor,
and, since they only offer this conjecture in an unknown matter, they
deserve little credit. My conviction is that it was sweet, which the
words of Moses himself a little further on confirm, where he denounces
the penalty of death upon those who should use such perfume for their
private gratification; for this prohibition would have been absurd,
unless its odor had been very agreeable. Besides, the analogy between
the sign and the thing signified would not have held good, unless its
sweet savor had testified that God is greatly pleased with the prayers
of His people. Moreover, in order that the sacred symbol might be the
more reverenced, it was not allowable to transfer this mixture to
private use; for since men are rude and earthly-minded, there is nothing
they are more prone to than to mix up heavenly things with those of
earth. Therefore, to elevate their minds the more, it was necessary that
the incense, in which there was a special holiness due to God alone,
should be set apart from common use.
