and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may
rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

<span id="v.iii.ii-p4"></span>**12.** Sex diebus facies opera tua: die
autem septimo quiesces, ut quiescat bos tuus, et asinus tuus, et
respiret filius ancillae tuae, et peregrinus.

In this passage the incidental use of the Sabbath is again referred to,
although it is no inherent part of its original institution, viz., that
by its means the family also and the cattle shall be benefited. There is
no impropriety in reckoning this amongst the other blessings which
enhance the value of the Sabbath, although it is a portion of the Second
Table. And we know that this rude people required to be attracted by
every possible means to present cheerfully to God the worship due to
Him. The sum therefore is, that they were thus to testify not only their
*piety* towards God, but also their kindness towards their servants. I
have already shewn that their authority as masters was to be exercised
in moderation by them, if they were mindful of their former condition:,
since they also had been servants in Egypt. If any one should suppose
that the argument does not hold good, because; they were oppressed by
cruel and dreadful tyranny, the reply is easy, that so much the better
could they determine from their own feelings how detestable and
intolerable a thing cruelty is.
