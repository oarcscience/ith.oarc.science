coles eos, neque facies secundum opera eorum.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p7"></span>**24.** *Thou shalt not bow down to their
gods.* Moses repeats what had been before said, that the worship of God
must *be* separated from all the superstitions of the Gentiles; for this
error has been everywhere rife, that unbelievers would rather draw down
God to themselves on earth, than ascend above to seek for Him. And in
this sense we have said that idols are called gods; because it is
impossible but that he who would represent God by wood and stone, should
associate Him with corruptible matter. Experience also teaches us, that
all the wicked are so attached to their idols, that they gain nothing by
their subterfuge, when they allege that this is a necessary help to
their ignorance. The following clause, “nor do after their works,”
sufficiently proves that all corrupt worship is comprehended under the
term idolatry.
