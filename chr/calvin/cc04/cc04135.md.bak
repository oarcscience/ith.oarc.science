transgressing his covenant,

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p4"></span>**2.** Si inventus fuerit in medio tui,
in una portarum tuarum, quas Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi, vir sire mulier
qui fecerit malum in oculis Jehovae Dei tui, ad transgrediendum pactum
ejus:

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p5"></span>**3.** And hath gone and served other

of heaven, which I have not commanded;

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p6"></span>**3.** Iveritque et coluerit deos

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p7"></span>**4.** And it be told thee, and thou
hast heard *of it,* and enquired diligently, and, behold, *it be* true,
*and* the thing certain, *that* such abomination is wrought in Israel:

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p8"></span>**4.** Et nuntiatum fuerit tibi,
audierisque: tune probe inquires: et ecce, si verus et certus fuerit
sermo, et facta fuerit abominatio haec in Israel:

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p9"></span>**5.** Then shalt thou bring forth that
man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy
gates, *even* that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones,
till they die.

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p10"></span>**5.** Educes virum illum, aut

virum, aut mulierem, et obrues cos lapidibus donec moriantur.

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p11"></span>**7.** The hands of the witnesses
shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of
all the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p12"></span>**7.** Marius testium primo erit in
eum ad occidendum ipsum, et manus populi postea: exterminabisque malum e
medio tui.

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p15"></span>**2.** *If there be found among you.*
The same punishment is here decreed against idolaters, to which
apostates had been before condemned; and thus either transgression is
declared a capital crime. Hence we gather that it is accounted before
God no less weighty a sin to violate His worship by gross and impure
superstitions, than openly and professedly to fall away from religion
altogether. Thus in <span id="iii.xi.viii-p15.1"></span>[Eze
20:39](../../../bib/kjv/eze020.htm#039.md)<span
id="iii.xi.viii-p15.1"></span>, He bids farewell to the Jews, and as it
were emancipates them, that they may go every one after his idols, when
they are no longer contented with Him alone. Whilst God, however, is so
rigid an exactor of punishment, He would not have judgment pronounced
precipitately. These are tokens of severity, that a woman as well as a
man is to be slain; that the whole people should unite in stoning them;
that the evil should be removed from the midst of the land, lest the
abomination should continue unpunished. On the other hand moderation is
to be observed, since diligent inquiry is to be made, nor is sentence to
be pronounced unless the matter is fully proved; and again, that the
trial may be lawful, the accusation of one man is not to convict the
accused. God therefore would not have the judges, under pretext of zeal,
shed blood inconsiderately; but only, after mature inquiry, the criminal
was to be punished in proportion to his transgression. By *synecdoche*
he speaks of their cities under the name of “gates,” and alludes to the
land having been “given” them, that they might not shew their want of
gratitude to God by profaning it. He marks too the heinous nature of the
offense, by calling it the “transgressing of God’s covenant;” as much as
to say that all who go aside unto idols are covenant-breakers. For the
thief, and the fornicator, and the drunkard, and such like transgress
the Law indeed, but still are not placed in this category. In fine, it
is not simple impiety which is here punished, but the perfidy whereby
true religion is forsaken, after men have devoted themselves to God, and
professed themselves to be of the number of His people. The repetition
of the words “that man or that woman,” more fully confirms what I have
said, viz., that although the weakness of the female sex may extenuate
their guilt, yet must they not be pardoned in such a case as this, where
God’s worship is directly violated. Although mention is only made of the
sun, and moon, and stars, the same thing applies to images also; nay,
inasmuch as it is baser to transfer God’s honor to dead stones or
stocks, than to those constellations in which something divine shines
forth, so much more detestable are they who plunge themselves into such
stupidity.

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p16"></span><span id="iii.xi.viii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p17"></span>**4.** *Then three shalt inquire*
 <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) *diligently.* Although this
moderation here refers only to the present matter, yet should it always
be maintained in judicial proceedings, lest innocent persons should be
treated with undue severity. Again, we must remember what I have said
elsewhere, that judges are here not only restrained from precipitate
condemnation, but also stimulated to beware of passing over, in idleness
or negligence, anything that was necessary to be known. For they often
fail in their duty, because they wilfully connive at guilt; and thus
that which would be manifest if they would be at the pains to make more
diligent inquiry, does not come to light. God, then, would not have them
slumber nor take no notice of sinister reports, but rather inquire
diligently as to things which may have come to their cars, so that no
crime may remain unpunished. The same is the case as to witnesses; for
whilst it would be unjust to pronounce sentence on the testimony of one
man, still, if two or three will not suffice, there would be no end to
litigation. Fitly, then, has God prescribed to judges both that they
shall not be rashly credulous, and yet that they shall be content with
the lawful number of witnesses; but this point will be more largely
treated of elsewhere in commenting both on the Sixth and Ninth
Commandments.

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p19"></span><span id="iii.xi.viii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.viii-p20"></span>**7.** *The hands of the witnesses
shall be first.* It was not without reason that God would have criminals
put to death by the hand of those by whose testimony they were
condemned. The ancient people did not employ public executioners, that
there might be more solemnity, modesty, and reverence in the infliction
of punishments. This office he peculiarly enjoins upon the witnesses,
because the tongue of many is too hasty, not to say worse of it, so that
they do not hesitate to stab people verbally, when they would not dare
to lay a finger upon them. This, then, was an excellent remedy for the
repression of light accusations, not to admit the testimony of any,
whose hand was not prepared to execute the sentence. Stoning was indeed
a sad and horrible kind of punishment; but it is probable that God made
choice of it because it required the application of many hands. If
hanging had not been in use, God would have commanded in vain that the
corpse of a man who had been hanged should be taken down from the tree
before sunset. (<span id="iii.xi.viii-p20.1"></span>[De
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023.md)<span
id="iii.xi.viii-p20.1"></span>.) There were, therefore, other kinds of
capital punishment; but when the land was to be purged, as by a
propitiation, by the death of the sinner, he was to be stoned by the
hands of the whole people, since it would have been cruel for him to be
slain by a lingering death, which would have been the case if they had
stoned him one after another. The reason why the people were commanded
to cast the stones with one consent was, that they might give proof of
their zeal, and manifest their great indignation that God’s worship had
been violated.
