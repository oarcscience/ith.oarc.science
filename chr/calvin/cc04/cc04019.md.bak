<span id="ii.vii.i-p3"></span>**25.** Ye shall therefore put difference
between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean:
and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by
any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have
separated from you as unclean.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p4"></span>**25.** Vos quoque discrimen facite inter
animal mundum et immundum, et inter avem immundam et mundam, et ne
abominabiles reddatis animas vestras in animalibus et volatilibus, atque
in omni quod reptat in terra: quae separavi vobis ad im-munditiam.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p5"></span>**26.** And ye shall be holy unto me: for
I the LORD *am* holy, and have severed you from *other* people, that ye
should be mine.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p6"></span>**26.** Eritis autem sancti mihi: quia
sanctus sum ego Jehova, et separavi vosa populis, ut essetis mei.

findens fissuram duarum ungularum, ruminans inter animalia, illud
comedetis.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p18"></span>**7.** Nevertheless these ye shall not
eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof;
*as* the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but
divide not the hoof; *therefore* they *are* unclean unto you.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p19"></span>**7.** Veruntamen hoe non comedetis ex
ruminantibus et ex findentibus ungulam divisam, camelum, et leporem, et
cuniculum: quia ruminant, et ungulam non dividunt, immunda sunt vobis.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p20"></span>**8.** And the swine, because it divideth
the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it *is* unclean unto you: ye shall
not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p21"></span>**8.** Et porcum, quia findit ungulam, et
non ruminat, immundus est vobis: de carne eorum non comedetis, et
cadavera eorum non contingetis.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p22"></span>**9.** These ye shall eat of all that
*are* in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:

in aqua, quicquid habet pinnulam et squamam, comedetis.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p24"></span>**10.** And whatsoever hath not fins and
scales ye may not eat; it *is* unclean unto you.

shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

<span id="ii.vii.i-p29"></span>**12.** Hae autem sunt ex quibus non
comedetis, aquila, et gryphus, et haliaeetus,

<span id="ii.vii.i-p30"></span>**13.** And the glede, and the kite, and
the vulture after his kind,

owl, and the swan,

<span id="ii.vii.i-p42"></span>**19.** And every creeping thing that
flieth *is* unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.

<span id="ii.vii.i-p43"></span>**19.** Et omne reptile alatum immundum
est vobis, non comedetur.

20:25](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.vii.i-p48.2"></span>.** *Ye shall therefore put difference.* I
have no doubt but that this sentence depends on the end of the foregoing
verse; for although that verse contains a reason to deter them from
incest, of which he had been speaking, still it refers also to the
doctrine before us, and stands in the shape of preface to it. In a word,
it connects two things, for God here briefly declares His will, not only
with respect to unlawful and improper intercourse, but also why He
forbids His people to eat of unclean animals. Therefore He says, “I am
the Lord your God, which have separated you from *other* people.” Whence
it follows, that for no other reason were they prohibited from eating
those animals, except that they thence may learn to take more diligent
heed, and to withdraw themselves far from all the pollutions of the
Gentiles. He had before recommended purity by various symbols, and now
extends it even to the very animals. And this reason must be carefully
marked, that the distinction between meats is propounded to them in
order that they may study purity. For there would be something unmeaning
in what is here said, if we did not know that this interdiction was
imposed with this object, that they should not mix themselves
promiscuously with the Gentiles. Therefore it is again repeated, that
they were severed, that they might be God’s inheritance; and hence it is
inferred, that holiness was to be cultivated by them, that they might
conform themselves to the example of their God. Now it cannot be
questioned, that the distinction of meats which is prescribed, is a
supplement to the First Commandment, wherein the rule for worshipping
God duly and purely is laid down; and thus religion is rescued from all
admixtures of superstition.
