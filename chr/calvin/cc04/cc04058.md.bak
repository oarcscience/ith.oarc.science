<span id="iii.iii.xv-p3"></span>**1.** And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="iii.iii.xv-p4"></span>**1.** Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen,
dicendo:

<span id="iii.iii.xv-p5"></span>**2.** Speak unto Aaron, and say unto
him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over
against the candlestick.

<span id="iii.iii.xv-p6"></span>**2.** Loquere ad Aharon, et dicas illi,
Quando accendes lucernam, contra faciem candelabri lucebunt septem
lucernae.

<span id="iii.iii.xv-p7"></span>**3.** And Aaron did so: he lighted the
lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.

<span id="iii.iii.xv-p8"></span>**3.** Fecitque ita Aharon: contra
faciem candelabri accendit lucernas ejus, quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova
ipsi Mosi.

<span id="iii.iii.xv-p9"></span>**4.** And this work of the candlestick
*was of* beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof,
*was* beaten work: according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed
Moses, so he made the candlestick.

<span id="iii.iii.xv-p10"></span>**4.** Et hoc est opus candelabri,
ductile aureum usque ad hastile suum, usque ad flores suos ductile erat,
juxta exemplar quod ostenderat Jehova ipsi Mosi, sic fecit candelabrum.

<span id="iii.iii.xv-p11"></span> 

<span id="iii.iii.xv-p12"></span><span id="iii.iii.xv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.xv-p13"></span>**2** *When thou lightest the lamps.*
This precept, like many others, is not inserted in its proper place.
Moses again declares what was the use of the candlestick, and how the
lamps should be arranged, so that their light might be spread through
the sanctuary, and that the brightness of the gold might shine over
against them; for this was the reason why God would have the lamps
lighted *against the face of,* or opposite to, the candlestick, that the
very stand of the light might retain its beauty. Moreover, it is
expressly stated that Aaron obeyed God’s command, as if in no despicable
matter, as he had received it from Moses. To this also refers what
immediately follows, that it was made “according unto the pattern” which
Moses had seen in the mount; and this was, as I have before explained
it, that God is the Father of lights, who illuminates His Church by His
Spirit, that it may not wander in darkness; and so, whilst darkness
covers the whole earth, He is as an everlasting light to believers
instead of the sun and moon, as says <span
