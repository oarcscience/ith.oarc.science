<span id="iii.vii.iii-p3"></span>**22.** Thou shalt truly tithe all the
increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p4"></span>**22.** Decimando decimabis omnem
proventum seminis tui, quod egressum fuerit ex agro annuatim.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p5"></span>**27.** And the Levite that *is* within
thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor
inheritance with thee.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p6"></span>**27.** Levitam autem qui intra portas
tuas habitaverit non derelinques: quia non est ei pars et haereditas
tecum.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p7"></span>**28.** At the end of three years thou
shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and
shalt lay *it* up within thy gates:

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p8"></span>**28.** Tertio autem anno proferes
omnes decimas proventus tui anno ipso, et repones intra portas tuas.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p9"></span>**29.** And the Levite, (because he
hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the
fatherless, and the widow, which *are* within thy gates, shall come, and
shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all
the work of thine hand which thou doest.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p10"></span>**29.** Venietque Levita (quia non est
ei portio et haereditas tecum,) et peregrinus, et pupillus, atque vidua,
qui sunt intra portas: et comedent, et saturabuntur, ut benedicat tibi
Jehova Deus tuus in omni opere manus tuae quod feceris.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p13"></span>**22.** *Thou shalt truly tithe.* He
repeats in general terms the law before enacted, whereby he claims for
God the tithe of all the fruit. He does not, however, immediately
declare to whom they are to be paid, but inserts some provisions
respecting other offerings, which I have elsewhere explained. But when,
soon afterwards, in verse 27, he recommends the Levites to them, he
shews what is the proper use to which they are to be applied. He
signifies that it would be cruel to defraud the Levites of them,  <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216) and that they would be wicked and
unjust if they were grudgingly to pay them the tithes, which were theirs
by hereditary right, since their tribe possessed no inheritance in land.

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p15"></span><span id="iii.vii.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.iii-p16"></span>**28.** *At the end of three years.*
Those are mistaken, in my opinion, who think that another kind of tithe
is here referred to. It is rather a correction or interpretation of the
Law, lest the priests and Levites alone should consume all the tithes,
without applying a part to the relief of the poor, of strangers, and
widows. In order to make this clearer, we must first observe, that not
every third year is here prescribed,  <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217) but that the years are counted from
the Sabbatical year; for we shall elsewhere see that on every seventh
year the land was to rest, so that there was no sowing nor reaping.
After two harvests, therefore, the tithes of the third year were not the
entire property of the Levites, but were shared also by the poor, the
orphans, and widows, and strangers. This may easily be seen by
calculating the years; for otherwise the third year would have often
fallen on the Sabbatical one, in which all agriculture was at a
stand-still. Now, this was a most equitable arrangement, that the
priests and Levites having been well provided for during two years,
should admit their poor brethren and strangers to a share. Some part was
thus withdrawn from their abundance, lest they should give themselves up
to luxurious habits; and thus it was brought about that not more than a
twelfth portion every *year* should remain to them. In sum, there was
one peculiar year in every seven in which the Levites did not alone
receive the tithes for their own proper use, but shared them with the
orphans, and widows, and strangers, and the rest of the poor. “They
shall eat (He says) and be satisfied,” who would otherwise have to
suffer hunger, “that the Lord may bless thee,” (verse 29;) by which
promise He encourages them to be liberal.
