<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p25"></span>**12.** And the remnant that remaineth
of the curtains of the tent, the half-curtain that remaineth, shall hang
over the backside of the tabernacle.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p27"></span>**13.** And a cubit on the one side,
and a cubit on the other side, of that which remaineth in the length of
the curtains of the tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p53"></span>**26.** And thou shalt make bars *of*
shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,

latere tabernaculi altero: et quinque vectes tabulis pro latere
tabernaeuli, pro latere *inquam vergente* ad occi- dentem.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p57"></span>**28.** And the middle bar in the
midst of the boards shall reach from end to end.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p58"></span>**28.** Vectis autem medius per medium
tabularum transibit ab extremo ad extremum.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p59"></span>**29.** And thou shalt overlay the
boards with gold, and make their rings *of* gold *for* places for the
bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p60"></span>**29.** Tabulas vero teges auro, atque
annulos earum facies ex auro, per quos trajicientur vectes,
coope-riesque vectes ipso auro.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p61"></span>**30.** And thou shalt rear up the
tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was shewed thee in the
mount.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p62"></span>**30.** Et ita eriges tabernaculum
secundum dispositionem ejus, quae tibi ostensa est in monte.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p63"></span>**31.** And thou shalt make a vail
*of* blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning
work: with cherubims shall it be made:

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p64"></span>**31.** Facies et velum ex hyacintho,
et purpura, et vermiculo cocci, et bysso retorta, opere phrygionico
facies illud cum figuris cherubin.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p65"></span>**32.** And thou shalt hang it upon
four pillars of shittim *wood* overlaid with gold: their hooks *shall be
of* gold, upon the four sockets of silver.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p66"></span>**32.** Et pones illud super quatuor
columnas sittim obductas auro (un-cini earum aurei) super quatuor bases
argenteas.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p67"></span>**33.** And thou shalt hang up the
vail under the taches, that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail
the ark of the testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the
holy *place* and the most holy.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p68"></span>**33.** Ponesque velum sub uncinis, et
introduces illuc intra velum arcam testimonii, dividetque velum illud
vobis inter sanctum et sanctum sanctorum.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p69"></span>**34.** And thou shalt put the mercy
seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy *place.*

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p70"></span>**34.** Pones insuper propitiatorium
super arcata testimonii in sancto sanctorum.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p71"></span>**35.** And thou shalt set the table
without the vail, and the candlestick over against the table on the side
of the tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on the
north side.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p72"></span>**35.** Pones quoque mensam illam
extra velum, et candelabrum e regione mensae in latere tabernaculi ad
meridiem, et mensam pones in latere aquilonis.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p73"></span>**36.** And thou shalt make an hanging
for the door of the tent, *of* blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
twined linen, wrought with needlework.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p74"></span>**36.** Et facies velum ad ostium
tabernaculi ex hyacintho, et purpura, et vermiculo cocci, et bysso
retorta opere acupictoris.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p75"></span>**37.** And thou shalt make for the
hanging five pillars of shittim *wood,* and overlay them with gold,
*and* their hooks *shall be of* gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets
of brass for them.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p76"></span>**37.** Velo autem facies quinque
columnas ex sittim, quas teges auro, et uncini earum aurei, fundesque
els quinque bases aereas.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p77"></span> 

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p78"></span><span id="iii.iii.xvi-p78.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p79"></span>**1.** *Moreover, thou shalt make the
tabernacle.* In the whole construction of the tabernacle we must
remember what we have already seen, that the Israelites were instructed
by external figures how precious a thing is the worship of God, and
therefore that they must diligently beware lest it should be polluted by
any meanness. For all this richness and magnificence of ornament was the
very contrast to meanness. They were also reminded that, if they would
be accounted pure worshippers of God, they must avoid all uncleanness,
for the tabernacle was the type of the Church. Thus it is certain that
by its external ornaments the excellency of spiritual gifts was
designated. On this ground Isaiah, discoursing of the perfect glory of
the Church as it would be under the reign of Christ, says,

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p80"></span>"I will lay thy stones with fair
colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires; and I will make thy
windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of
pleasant stones,”  
(<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p80.2"></span>[Isa.
54:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p80.2"></span>;)

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p81"></span>by which words he plainly signifies
that the Church would be adorned with heavenly beauty, since all kinds
of graces shone forth in her But the chief excellency of her adornment
must be referred to the instruction which renews us into the image of
God. Thus David, when he celebrates the beauty of God’s house, assigns
this honor chiefly to the exercises of faith and piety:

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p82"></span>"One thing have I desired of the
Lord,” he says, “that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house
of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord,
and to inquire in his temple.” (<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p82.1"></span>[Ps
27:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p82.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p83"></span>Was this that he might feed his eyes
with empty pictures, with its costly materials, and with the exquisite
workmanship of it? Assuredly he does not speak of gazing inquisitively
at it, but thus alludes to its visible workmanship, that with the
spiritual eyes of faith he may consider the glory more excellent than
the whole world, which was there represented. Nor indeed did anything
magnificent appear in the tabernacle to delight men’s eyes, but rather
was all its richness and excellence covered up with goats’ hair and
paltry leather, in order that believers beneath that hidden beauty might
reflect on something higher than the carnal sense.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p84"></span>It will suffice to have given these
general hints; I now descend to particulars, in which let not my readers
expect of me any conceits which may gratify their ears, since nothing is
better than to contain ourselves within the limits of edification; and
it would be puerile to make a collection of the *minutiae* wherewith
some philosophize; since it was by no means the intention of God to
include mysteries in every hook and loop; and even although no part were
without a mystical meaning, which no one in his senses will admit, it is
better to confess our ignorance than to indulge ourselves in frivolous
conjectures. Of this sobriety, too, the author of the Epistle to the
Hebrews is a fit master for us, who, although he professedly shews the
analogy between the shadows of the Law and the truth manifested in
Christ, yet sparingly touches upon some main points, and by this
moderation restrains us from too curious disquisitions and deep
speculations. In the first place, curtains are made of twilled linen,
and blue, purple, and scarlet, which, when coupled together, made an
inclosure of forty cubits; for they were ten in number, and the breadth
of each was four cubits. By “cunning work,” commentators are agreed that
embroidery is meant, especially when God commands that cherubim should
be made in them. But some translate the word cherubim by the general
name of *pictures,*  <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) which,
although it is not grammatically incorrect, yet, since we have before
seen that angels were designated by this word, it; is more probable that
figures of angels were everywhere scattered over them; for, when the
majesty of God is represented to the life by <span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p85.2"></span>[Da
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p85.2"></span>, “ten thousand times ten thousand” are
said to stand around His judgment-seat, Ridiculous is it of the Papists
 <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) to infer from hence that
churches would be empty and unsightly unless they are adorned with
images; for in order that the similitude should hold good, they must
needs hide their images under a triple covering, lest the people should
be able to see them; and then, how would they be “the books of the
unlearned” (*idiotarum*)*,* as they call them?  <span
id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md)

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p88"></span>Now, since the seraphim, of which
Isaiah makes mention, (<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p88.1"></span>[Isa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p88.1"></span>,) signify the same as the cherubim, and
are said “with twain of their wings to cover their faces, and with twain
their feet,” their images must be veiled, in order to correspond with
them. Besides, it is preposterous, as I have said, forcibly to transfer
these rudiments, which God delivered only to His ancient; people, to the
fullness of time, when the Church has grown up and has passed out of its
childhood. But how far the Jews were from worshipping the cherubim, the
heathen poets bear them witness; for Juvenal, speaking of them, said,

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p89"></span>"<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p89.1"></span>Qui puras nubes, et coeli numen adorant;”
 <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md)

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p92"></span>and God extorted these words from an
impure and licentious man, that all might know that the Law of Moses
lifted his disciples to things above. A threefold covering is then
described, the inner one of goats’ hair, another of rams’ skins dyed
red, and the outer one of badgers’ skins; a wooden frame is then added,
to strengthen the tabernacle within by its firmness, since otherwise the
curtains would have got out of place at the slightest motion. The boards
were of shittim-wood, overlaid with gold, either only gilt or covered
with gold plates; each of them was supported by two silver bases,  <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) like feet, and they were joined
together by bars, passed through rings of gold. In this space the whole
tabernacle was contained, which then was distinguished into the outer
sanctuary and the Holy of holies. Besides these there was the court in
which the people were to stand, because it was not lawful for them to
enter the sanctuary, to which the priests alone had access, and they
only when clean. Thus David, after having exclaimed, “How amiable are
thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts,” immediately adds, “My soul longeth,
yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord;” and again, “for a day in
thy courts is better than a thousand,” (<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p93.1"></span>[Ps.
84:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p93.1"></span>;) and again, “Worship the Lord in his
holy *court.”*  <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) (<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p94.4"></span>[Ps
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p94.4"></span>.) But on so plain a matter there is no
need of the abundant proofs which he furnishes. The disposition of the
tabernacle is said again, in <span id="iii.iii.xvi-p94.5"></span>[Ex
26:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p94.5"></span>, to have been shewn in the mount, that
the people should not rest their attention on the visible tabernacle,
but with the understanding of faith should penetrate to heaven, and
direct their minds to the spiritual pattern, the shadows and types of
which they beheld. Neither here must we philosophize too curiously. The
allegory will please the ears of many, that by the two bases are meant
the Old and New Testament, or the two natures of Christ, because
believers rest on these two supports. But with no less probability we
might say, that two bases were placed beneath each of the boards; either
because godliness hath the promise of this life and of that which is to
come; or because we must resist on both sides the temptations which
assail us from the right and from the left; or because faith must not
limp nor turn to the right or left: thus there would be no bounds to
trifling. They allegorically explain that the covering of the tabernacle
was made of rams’ skins,  <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md)
because the Church is protected by the blood of Christ, who is the
spotless lamb; but I ask, what do the badgers’ skins, which were above,
mean? Why was the covering of goats’ hair put below? Wherefore, sobriety
is our best course.

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p96"></span><span id="iii.iii.xvi-p96.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p97"></span>**31.** *And thou shalt make a vail.*
The inner shrine or recess was covered by one vail; the sanctuary was
divided from the court by another. By both the people were admonished
how reverently God’s majesty must be regarded, and with what seriousness
holy things are to be engaged in, so that they might not approach God’s
presence without fear, nor boldly break in upon the mysteries of things
sacred. But by the vail the obscurity of the shadows of the Law was
principally denoted, that the Israelites might know that the time of
full revelation had not yet come, but that the spiritual worship of God
was as yet enshrouded in a vail; and thus might extend their faith to
their promised Messiah, at whose coming the truth would be discovered
and laid bare. Wherefore, when Christ rose again from the dead, “the
vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom,” (<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p97.1"></span>[Mt
27:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#051.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p97.1"></span>;) and an end was put to the ceremonies of
the Law, because God then presented Himself in His living and express
image, and the perfect reality of all the ceremonies was manifested.
Now, therefore, in the light of the gospel, we behold “face to face,”
what was then shewn afar off to the ancient people under coverings.
(<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p97.2"></span>[2Co
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p97.2"></span>.) Yet, although there is now no vail to
prevent us from openly and familiarly looking upon Christ, let us learn
from this figure that the manifestation of God in the flesh is a hidden
and incomprehensible mystery. (<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p97.3"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p97.3"></span>.) It is not without reason that Christ
Himself compares His body to the temple, because the fullness of the
Godhead dwells in it. (<span id="iii.iii.xvi-p97.4"></span>[Joh
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p97.4"></span>.) Let us then know assuredly that the
Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father, (<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p97.5"></span>[Joh
17:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xvi-p97.5"></span>;) but if it be asked in what manner, this
