<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p5"></span>**32.** And six branches shall come

*them* after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p22"></span>**40.** Vide autem ut facias juxta
similitudinem suam, quae tibi ostensa est in monte.

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p23"></span> 

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p24"></span><span id="iii.iii.xiii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p25"></span>**31.** *And thou shalt make a
candlestick.* God would have seven bright lamps burning day and night in
the Tabernacle: *first,* that the people might know that they were
directed by God Himself as to how they were to worship Him aright, and
that a light was set before their eyes which might disperse all the
darkness of error; and, *secondly,* lest they should obscure the very
worship of God with their gross inventions, but that, intent on the
instruction of the Law, they might with a pure and enlightened mind seek
after God in all the ceremonies. Let us, therefore, remark a distinction
here set forth between the rule of true religion and the superstitions
of the Gentiles; because the Gentiles were carried away by their foolish
and blind devotions, as they call them, into circuitous and erring ways,
so that nothing was straight in them; for unless we have divine teaching
to enlighten us, our own reason will beget nothing but mere vanity. But
it was not enough for the Israelites that the right way should be
pointed out, unless their eyes were open to direct them, since men
sometimes are blind in the very midst of light. And this occurred to
themselves not only when they went astray into strange and adulterous
worships, for though they held fast the external form of the Law, they
were, nevertheless, degenerate; and religion was corrupted among them by
foul superstitions, when, in obedience to their carnal reason, they
conceived that religion consisted in ceremonies. For when God is not
worshipped spiritually according to His nature, this is to travesty Him.
Hence there was so much security in the hypocrites, that they proudly
despised all the reproofs of the Prophets, nay, that they broke out into
open fury whenever their empty pomps were condemned. But the
candlestick, shining with its seven lights, reminded the people that, in
their worship of God, they should look attentively to the light of
heavenly doctrine.

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p26"></span>But, for the understanding of this
type, the vision of Zechariah will be no slight assistance to us, since
the truth of this symbol is there set forth. (<span
id="iii.iii.xiii-p26.1"></span>[Zec
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xiii-p26.1"></span>.) God there promises that the power of
His Spirit will alone avail, and more than avail, for the preservation
of His Church, although it may be destitute of all other aid. To awaken
confidence in this, He represents the same image of a candlestick which
is here described, with the addition of some other circumstances,
whereby He reminds us that the shining lights were no vain show like
stage plays*,* but that in the candlestick was represented what
believers would really experience to take place. But, that the
comparison may be made clearer, we must say a little respecting this
passage. The material of the candlestick is pure gold, whereby the
excellency of the thing signified is denoted. But, when we have spoken
somewhat of its form, the application of Zechariah’s prophecy will be
more manifest. Some parts of it were merely for ornament, that its
dignity might be increased by its very appearance, such as the flowers
and the balls or knops; others for use*,* as the bowls or receptacles,
to prevent the sacred oil from falling on the ground. The lamps were
placed at the top, that the Israelites might know that men are
surrounded with darkness on earth, if God did not enlighten His Church
from on high, and that by day and by night. Thus Isaiah, describing the
kingdom of Christ, in which the reality of this sign was at length
exhibited, says, — “Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory
shall be seen upon thee.” And again,

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p27"></span>"Thy sun shall no more go down;
neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be thy
everlasting light.”  
(<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p27.2"></span>[Isa
60:2-20](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xiii-p27.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p28"></span>Now, since God is called the Father
of lights, the grace of illumination resides in the Spirit; and since a
variety of gifts are distributed by the Spirit, there were seven lamps
which visibly represented what Paul says, —

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p29"></span>"The manifestation of the Spirit is
given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit
the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by
the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another
prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of
tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh
that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he
will.” (<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p29.1"></span>[1Co
12:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xiii-p29.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p30"></span>Some, however, have gratuitously
invented a mystery in the number seven, whence the common notion  <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) among the Papists about the sevenfold
grace of the Spirit, which is refuted both by the above-cited passage of
St. Paul and the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, where a greater number of
gifts are enumerated. I suppose rather that perfection is denoted by the
seven lamps according to the ordinary and acknowledged use (of the
figure); as if God thus declared that nothing would be wanting for the
full enlightenment of believers, who should seek it from its one and
only source; secondly, that the Spirit presides over all religious rites
when He shines forth to the Church in His gifts. Now, the Prophet,
(<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p31.3"></span>[Zec
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xiii-p31.3"></span>,) desiring to teach that what had been
shewn forth in this visible symbol would be fulfilled in the restoration
of the Church, adds to the lamps seven pipes and two olive-trees, from
whence oil would continually flow, so that there was no fear of want or
failure. Thus he signifies that God is possessed of a manifold abundance
of blessings for the enrichment of the Church; and so that the virtue
which flows down from heaven is sufficient for its preservation,
according to what is added in connection,

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p32"></span>"Not by might, nor by power, but by
my Spirit,  
saith the Lord of hosts.” (<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p32.2"></span>[Zec
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xiii-p32.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p33"></span>For although God uses the ministry of
men and earthly means at His discretion for the protection and
maintenance of the Church, yet He would have, as is just, all the praise
ascribed to Himself; whilst He would also have believers to be contented
under His guardianship, and not to be discouraged although they should
find no ground of confidence in the world.

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p34"></span><span id="iii.iii.xiii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p35"></span>**40** *And look that thou make
them.* He again inculcates, what we have already seen, that Moses should
take care that all things were exactly modeled according to the original
or pattern seen in the mount. But it is certain that it is not any mere
vision which is here in question, but that the external ornaments of the
sanctuary have *reference* to their spiritual object, as is plain from
the explanation of Stephen and the Apostle. Wherefore we need not wonder
that Zechariah should say that God would make manifest, and that by
certain proof, under the reign of Christ, that it was no empty spectacle
which God had set before His people under the Law.

<span id="iii.iii.xiii-p31"></span> The seven gifts of the Holy Ghost
are represented in Roman Catholic Catechisms to be, — 1. Wisdom; 2.
Understanding; 3. Counsel; 4. Fortitude; 5. Knowledge; 6. Godliness; 7.
The fear of the Lord: founded, of course, on <span

11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iii.xiii-p31.1"></span>. *Augustin* says, Sermo 8, (Edit. Ben.,
tom. 5, p. 46,) speaking of the Holy Spirit, “<span
id="iii.iii.xiii-p31.2"></span>Ipse requiescit super humilem et quietum,
tanquam in Sabbato suo. Ad hoc *septenarius numerus etiam Sancto
Spiritui deputatur,* hoc Scripturae nostrae satis indicant. Viderint
meliora meliores, et majora majores; et de isto septenario numero
subtilius aliquid et divinius aliquid dicant et explicent: ego tamen,
quod in presenti sat est, illud video, illud vos ad videndum commemoro,
septenariam istam rationem inveniri proprie Sancto Spiritui deputatam;
quia; septimo die sonat sanctificatio,” etc.
