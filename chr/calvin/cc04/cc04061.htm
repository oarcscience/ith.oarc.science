<p><a name="iii.iii.xviii-p27"></A><b>9.</b> <i>And thou shalt make the court.</i> There were two courts divided from the sanctuary, one for the priests, the other common to the whole people. To the first chambers were annexed, in which the Levites dwelt, who were the keepers of the tabernacle; and thus sometimes the 				courts are spoken of in the plural number, and especially in the Psalms, (<a name="iii.iii.xviii-p27.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa064.htm#004">Ps. 64:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#002">Ps. 84:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa092.htm#013">Ps. 92:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#008">Ps. 96:8</a><a name="iii.iii.xviii-p27.1"></A>.) It is the court of the people which is here referred to, where they consecrated the victims, offered their prayers, and were reconciled to God. In this manner the condition of mankind was shewn to the 				Israelites, by their being forbidden to enter the Temple, whilst at the same time they were reminded that men, although unworthy outcasts, are received by God, if only they seek Him simply, and with due humility, mindful of their own unworthiness. Hence the consolation in which David gloried,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">149</FONT></A>
 				 &#8220;I had rather dwell in the courts of the Lord, than in the splendid tents of the ungodly.&#8221; The court was formed by four curtains, two of which, on the north and south sides, were 100 cubits long, and supported by 20 pillars, whose bases were of brass, and their capitals   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">150</FONT></A>
 				 and fillets of silver; on the east and west, each curtain was 50 cubits long, supported by 10 pillars. The length spoken of is not from the ground upwards, but from their opposite corners: for the court was twice as long as it was broad, as is said in <a name="iii.iii.xviii-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#018">Ex 27:18</a><a name="iii.iii.xviii-p29.1"></A>. There<b> 				</b>would be an appearance of contradiction in the fact that Moses afterwards speaks of two sides, and assigns fifteen cubits to each, if he did not immediately go on to mention the hanging or curtain, which covered the gate of the court, and which he sets at twenty cubits. Thus the measure will be correct, and the passage will be quite accordant; for, after he has said in <a name="iii.iii.xviii-p29.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo027.htm#013">Ex 27:13</a><a name="iii.iii.xviii-p29.2"></A> that the curtain on the east side should consist of fifty cubits, he adds in explanation that there were two curtains at the sides of the door, and a third between them to cover the door, making up in all the fifty cubits. But the door was covered by the hanging, that the Israelites might reflect in themselves, whenever they went into the sanctuary, that it was no profane or common (<i>promiscuum</i>) place; but if they came thither in purity and chastity, they might be assuredly persuaded that they were safe under the protection of God. Finally also the majesty of holy things was shewn them in this type, in order that they might reverently approach the worship of God; and they were reminded of their own unworthiness, that they might humble themselves the more before God, and that fear might 				beget penitence, whilst moderation in the desire of knowledge was recommended to them, that they might not be unduly inquisitive. The religion of the Gentiles also had its secret shrines with the same object, but for very different causes; for it was a brutal religion, for which veneration was sought by darkness, and the disguise of ignorance; whereas God, whilst He retained His people in modesty and simplicity, at the same time set before them the Law, from which they might learn whatever it 				was right and useful for them to know.</p>
