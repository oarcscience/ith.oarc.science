<span id="iii.x.ii-p3"></span>**1.** And the LORD called unto Moses, and
spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

<span id="iii.x.ii-p4"></span>**1.** Vocavit autem Mosen, et loquutus
est Jehova cum eo e tabernaculo conventionis, dicendo:

<span id="iii.x.ii-p5"></span>**2.** Speak unto the children of Israel,
and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye
shall bring your offering of the cattle, *even* of the herd, and of the
flock.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p6"></span>**2.** Loquere ad filios Israel, et dic
illis, Homo quum offeret ex vobis oblationem Jehovae: ex animalibus, ex
bobus, et ex pecudibus offeretis oblationem.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p7"></span>**3.** If his offering *be* a burnt
sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall
offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation before the LORD.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p8"></span>**3.** Si holocaustum oblatio ejus fuerit
ex bobus, masculum immaculatum offeret: ad ostium tabernaculi
conventionis offeret eum pro animi proposito in conspectu Jehovae.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p9"></span>**4.** And he shall put his hand upon the
head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make
atonement for him.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p10"></span>**4.** Et admovebit manum suam super
caput holocausti: et accepturm erit pro ipso ad eum expiandum.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p11"></span>**5.** And he shall kill the bullock
before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood,
and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that *is by* the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p12"></span>**5.** Mactabit autem juveneum in
conspectu Jehovae, et offerent filii Aharon sacerdotes sanguinem, ae
spargent illum in circiutu super altare quod erit ad ostium tabernaculi
conventionis.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p13"></span>**6.** And be shall flay the burnt
offering, and cut it into his pieces.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p14"></span>**6.** Et excoriabit holocaustum,
concidetque in frusta sua.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p15"></span>**7.** And the sons of Aaron the priest
shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:

<span id="iii.x.ii-p16"></span>**7.** Ponentque filii Aharon sacerdotis
ignem super altare, et disponent ligna super ignem.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p17"></span>**8.** And the priests, Aaron’s sons,
shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that
*is* on the fire which *is* upon the altar:

<span id="iii.x.ii-p18"></span>**8.** Posthaec disponent filii Aharon
sacerdotes frusta, caput, et adipem, super ligna superimposita igni qui
est super altare.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p19"></span>**9.** But his inwards and his legs shall
he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, *to be* a
burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the
LORD.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p20"></span>**9.** Intestina autem ejus et crura
lavabit aqua, et adolebit sacerdos omnia super altare: holocaustum est
oblatio ignita odoris quietis Jehovae.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p21"></span>**10.** And if his offering *be* of the
flocks, *namely,* of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice;
he shall bring it a male without blemish.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p22"></span>**10.** Quod si de pecudibus fuerit
oblatio ejus, de ovibus, vel de capris in holocaustum, masculum
immaculatum offeret eum:

<span id="iii.x.ii-p23"></span>**11.** And he shall kill it on the side
of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons,
shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p24"></span>**11.** Mactabitque illud ad latus
altaris ad aquilonem in conspectu Jehovae: spargentque filii Aharon
sacerdotes sanguinem ejus super altare in circiutu.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p25"></span>**12.** And he shall cut it into his
pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in
order on the wood that *is* on the fire which *is* upon the altar:

<span id="iii.x.ii-p26"></span>**12.** Et concidet eum in frusta sun, et
caput ejus, et adipem ejus: ordinabitque ea sacerdos super ligna
superposita igni qui est super altare.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p27"></span>**13.** But he shall wash the inwards and
the legs with water: and the priests shall bring *it* all, and burn *it*
upon the altar: it *is* a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of
a sweet savour unto the LORD.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p28"></span>**13.** Et intestina et crura lavabit
aqua, efferetque sacerdos onmia, adolebitque super altare: holocaustum
est, oblatio ignita odoris quietis Jehovae.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p29"></span>**14.** And if the burnt sacrifice for
his offering to the LORD *be* of fowls, then he shall bring his offering
of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p30"></span>**14.** Si autem de avibus fuerit
holocaustum, oblatio ipsius Jehovae, tum offeret de turturibus aut de
columbis oblationem suam.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p31"></span>**15.** And the priest shall bring it
unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn *it* on the altar; and
the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:

<span id="iii.x.ii-p32"></span>**15.** Et offeret illam sacerdos super
altare, et ungue secabit caput ipsius: et adolebit super altare,
exprimeturque sanguis ejus super parietem altaris.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p33"></span>**16.** And he shall pluck away his crop
with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the
place of the ashes:

<span id="iii.x.ii-p34"></span>**16.** Et removebit vesiculam ejus cum
pluma ipsius: projicietque illam prope altare ad orientem ad locum
cineris.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p35"></span>**17.** And he shall cleave it with the
wings thereof, *but* shall not divide *it* asunder: and the priest shall
burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that *is* upon the fire: it *is* a
burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the
LORD.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p36"></span>**17.** Et findet illam cum alis suis,
neque dividet, adolebitque eam sacerdos super altare, super ligna qum
fuerint super igne: holocaustum est oblatio ignita odoris quietis
Jehovae.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p37"></span> 

<span id="iii.x.ii-p38"></span><span id="iii.x.ii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.ii-p39"></span>**1.** *And the Lord called unto Moses.*
In these seven chapters Moses will treat generally of the sacrifices.
But since we read of many things here, the use of which has passed away,
and others, the grounds of which I do not understand, I intend to
content myself with a brief summary, from whence, however, the reader
may fully perceive that whatever has been left to us relative to the
legal sacrifices is even now profitable, provided we are not too
curious. Let those who choose to hunt for allegories receive the praise
they covet; my object is only to profit my readers, and it will suffice
briefly to sum up what I think useful to be known. Although in this
chapter burnt-offerings only are treated of, yet the rule which is laid
down respecting them has a more extensive application, since Moses
teaches what animals God would have offered to Him, so as that they may
be acceptable, and also by whom and with what ceremonies they are to be
offered. He enumerates three kinds, of the herd, of the flocks, and of
fowls; for the case of the red heifer, from which the ashes of atonement
were made, was different and peculiar; and here the question is as to
the ordinary sacrifices, by which private individuals used either to
atone for their sins or to testify their piety. He commands, therefore,
that the cattle as well as the lambs and kids should be males, and also
perfect and free from all blemish. We see, then, that only clean animals
were chosen for the sacrifices, and again that all clean animals did not
please God, but only domestic ones, such as allow themselves to be
directed by the hand and will of men. For, though deer and roes are
sometimes tamed, yet God did not admit them to His altar. This, then,
was the first rule of obedience, that men should not offer promiscuously
this or that victim, but bulls or bull-calves of their herds, and male
lambs or kids of their flocks. Freedom from blemish is required for two
reasons; for, since the sacrifices were types of Christ, it behooved
that in all of them should be represented that complete perfection of
His whereby His heavenly Father was to be propitiated; and, secondly,
the Israelites were reminded that all uncleanness was repudiated by God
lest his service should be polluted by their impurity. But whilst God
exhorted them to study true sincerity, so he abundantly taught them that
unless they directed their faith to Christ, whatsoever came from them
would be rejected; for neither would the purity of a brute animal have
satisfied Him if it had not represented something better. In the second
place, it is prescribed that whosoever presented a burnt-offering should
lay his hand on its head, after he had come near the door of the
tabernacle. This ceremony was not only a sign of consecration, but also
of its being an atonement,  <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md)
since it was substituted for the man, as is expressed in the words of
Moses, “And it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.”
(<span id="iii.x.ii-p40.3"></span>[Le
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/lev001.htm#004)<span id="iii.x.ii-p40.3"></span>..md)
There is not, then, the least doubt but that they transferred their
guilt and whatever penalties they had deserved to the victims, in order
that they might be reconciled to God. Now, since this promise could not
have been at all delusive, it must be concluded that in the ancient
sacrifices there was a price of satisfaction which should release them
from guilt and blame in the judgment of God; yet still not as though
these brute animals availed in themselves unto expiation, except in so
far as they were testimonies of the grace to be manifested by Christ.
Thus the ancients were reconciled to God in a sacramental manner by the
victims, just as we are now cleansed through baptism. Hence it follows
that these symbols were useful only as they were exercises unto faith
and repentance, so that the sinner might learn to fear God’s wrath, and
to seek pardon in Christ.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p41"></span><span id="iii.x.ii-p41.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.ii-p42"></span>**5.** *And he shall kill the bullock.*
The ceremony of killing is subjoined, viz., that the priest should
prepare the victim itself, and pour its blood upon the altar, for it was
not allowable for a private person to kill the victim with his own
hands, but what the priest did in their name was transferred to them.
 <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) But this is worth remarking,
that although they brought the pledge of reconciliation from their home,
yet that the ministers of expiation were to be sought elsewhere, since
no one was competent for so illustrious an office, save he who was
graced by the holy unction of God. It was, therefore, plainly manifested
that all mortals are unworthy of coming near God to propitiate Him, and
that the hands of all are in a manner polluted or profane except those
which God himself has purged. For the honor of sacrificing came from
nowhere else but from the grace of the Spirit, of which the external
anointing was a pledge. We now understand how it was that individuals
offered sacrifices to God, and yet that the priest alone performed this
office. The altar was sprinkled with the blood, that the people might
know that the blood poured from the victim did not fall on the ground,
but was consecrated to God, and breathed, as it were, a sweet savor;
just as now the blood of Christ appears before His face. I pass by the
rest, since it does not seem worth while to enlarge on the third kind of
offering, *i.e.,* of the birds. Yet we must recollect that thus far
Moses only speaks of the burnt-offerings, whose flesh was burned; for
this was not the case with all, as we shall see hereafter. Although,
then, it is twice said that “the priests shall lay the parts, the head
and the fat,” etc., we must not understand it as if he only commanded
the fat and the head to be burned, but that nothing was to be left the
skin. Some think that <span id="iii.x.ii-p43.2"></span>פדר *pheder,*
 <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) is a dissevered head, nor do I
reject their opinion, provided we do not exclude the fat. Whatever was
filthy in the victim, God would have to be washed, that it might not
contaminate it. The question now arises why it was burned either wholly
or partially. My own opinion is, that by the fire the efficacy of the
Spirit is represented, on which all the profit of the sacrifices
depends; for unless Christ had suffered in the Spirit, He would not have
been a propitiatory sacrifice. Fire, then, was as the condiment which
gave their true savor to the sacrifices, because the blood of Christ was
to be consecrated by the Spirit, that it might cleanse us from all the
stains of our sins. This God would have more fully represented in the
burnt-offerings, yet no victim was offered of which some part was not
consumed by fire.

<span id="iii.x.ii-p43"></span> “It is interesting to notice here, (says
Bonar, in *loco,*) that Outram, Witzius, and others, seem to have proved
that in patriarchal ages every man might offer his own sacrifice. The
patriarchal ages were taught that every man must take Christ for himself
personally. In the Mosaic economy, however, this is altered; there is
another truth to be shewn forth. Any one (<span

id="iii.x.ii-p43.1"></span>) might kill the animal — any common Levite,
or even the offerer himself — for there may be many executioners of
God’s wrath. Earth and hell were used in executing the Father’s purpose
toward the Prince of Life. But there is only one appointed way for
dispensing mercy, and therefore only priests must engage in that act
that signified the bestowal of pardon.” He appears, however, to be
singular in his opinion that any but a Levite might kill the victim.
