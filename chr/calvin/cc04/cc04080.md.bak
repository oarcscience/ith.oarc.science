<span id="iii.v.iii-p3"></span>**1.** And the LORD spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="iii.v.iii-p4"></span>**1.** Loquutus est insuper Jehova ad
Mosen, dicendo:

<span id="iii.v.iii-p5"></span>**2.** Speak unto Aaron and to his sons,
that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of
Israel, and that they profane not my holy name *in those things* which
they hallow unto me: I *am* the LORD.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p6"></span>**2.** Loquere ad Aharon, et filios ejus
ut separent sese a sanctificationibus filiorum Israel et ne polluant
nomen sanctitatis mese in his quae ipsi sanctificant mihi: ego Jehova.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p7"></span>**3.** Say unto them, Whosoever *he be*
of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy
things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his
uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I
*am* the LORD.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p8"></span>**3.** Dic illis, in generationibus
vestris omnis vir qui accesserit ex omni semine vestro ad
sanctificationes quae sanctificaverint filii Israel Jehovae, et
immunditia sua fuerit super ipsum, excidetur anima ipsius a facie mea:
ego Jehova.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p9"></span>**4.** What man soever of the seed of
Aaron *is* a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the
holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing *that is*
unclean *by* the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;

<span id="iii.v.iii-p10"></span>**4.** Quicunque e semine Aharon fuerit
leprosus, vel seminifluus, de sanctificationibus non comedet donec
mundet se: et qui tedgerit immundum super morticinio, ant virex quo
egreditur effusio seminis,

<span id="iii.v.iii-p11"></span>**5.** Or whosoever toucheth any
creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may
take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;

<span id="iii.v.iii-p12"></span>**5.** Ant vir qui tetigerit quodcunque
reptile per quod immundus erit, ant hominem propter quem immundus erit,
secundum omnem immunditiam eius:

<span id="iii.v.iii-p13"></span>**6.** The soul which hath touched any
such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things,
unless he wash his flesh with water.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p14"></span>**6.** Anima inquam quae tetigerit
illum, immunda erit usque ad vesperam: et non comedet de
sanctificationibus nisi laverit carnem suam aqua.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p15"></span>**7.** And when the sun is down, he
shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it
*is* his food.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p16"></span>**7.** Quum autem occubuerit sol, turn
erit mundus, et postea comedet de sanctificationibus: quia cibus ejus
est.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p17"></span>**8.** That which dieth of itself, or is
torn *with beasts,* he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I *am*
the LORD.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p18"></span>**8.** Cadaver et rapture non comedet,
et polluat se in eo: ego Jehova.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p19"></span>**9.** They shall therefore keep mine
ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane
it: I the LORD do sanctify them.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p20"></span>**9.** Et custodiant custodiam meam, et
ne portent peccatum propter illud, et moriantur propter illud, quum
polluerint illam: ego Jehova sanctificans eos.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p21"></span>**10.** There shall no stranger eat *of*
the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall
not eat *of* the holy thing.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p22"></span>**10.** Omnis autem alienigena non
comedet sanctificationem: inquilinus sacerdotis, et mercenarius non
comedet sanctificationem.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p23"></span>**11.** But if the priest buy *any* soul
with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house:
they shall eat of his meat.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p24"></span>**11.** Quod si sacerdos emerit hominem
emptione argenti sui: ipsc comedet ex ea, et vernaculus ejus: illi
comedent de cibo ejus.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p25"></span>**12.** If the priest’s daughter also be
*married* unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy
things.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p26"></span>**12.** Filia autem sacerdotis quum
fuerit viro alieno: ipsa de oblatione sanctificationum non comedet.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p27"></span>**13.** But if the priest’s daughter be
a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her
father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s meat: but
there shall no stranger eat thereof.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p28"></span>**13.** Filia vero sacerdotis quum
fuerit vidua, ant repudiata, et semen non erit el, et reversa fuerit ad
domran parris sui, sicut in pueritia sua, de eibo patris eomedet: onmis
autem alienigena non comedet ex co.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p29"></span>**14.** And if a man eat of the holy
thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth *part* thereof unto it,
and shall give *it* unto the priest with the holy thing.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p30"></span>**14.** Quod si aliquis comederit
sanctificationem per imprudentiam, addet quintam partem ejus, et dabit
sacerdoti eum sanctificatione.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p31"></span>**15.** And they shall not profane the
holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

<span id="iii.v.iii-p32"></span>**15.** Et non contaminabunt
sanctificationes filiorum Israel, quas obtulerint Jehovae.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p33"></span>**16.** Or suffer them to bear the
iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do
sanctify them.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p34"></span>**16.** Neque portare facient cos
iniquitatem delicti, dum comederint sanctificationes eorum: ego enim
Jehova sanctificans eos.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p35"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.iii-p36"></span><span id="iii.v.iii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iii-p37"></span>**1.** *And the Lord spake unto Moses.*
Moses here treats of the accidents whereby pollution is contracted,
although a man may be by nature pure and sound. If any labored under
natural defects, Moses prohibited them from exercising the sacerdotal
office; now, if any extrinsic pollution may have affected a priest, he
commands him to abstain from his duties until he shall have been
purified. He had already commanded that any unclean person should be
separated from the people lest their contagion should infect others; it
may therefore seem superfluous to prescribe to the priests what had been
universally enjoined. But since men placed in any position of honor are
apt to abuse God’s favor as a pretext for sin, lest the sacerdotal
dignity might be used as a covering for the indulgence or excuse of
scandals, it was necessary to enact an express law, that the priests
should not plead their privilege to eat in their uncleanness of the
sacrifices which none but the clean might offer. And that their
sacrilege might be the more detestable, he denounces death against any
who should intrude their pollutions into the sacrifices; for it was
necessary to arouse by the fear of punishment, and as it were to drive
by violence to their duty those who would not have been otherwise
restrained by any religious feeling from making God’s service
contemptible. He then enumerates the particular kinds of pollution of
which we have before spoken. Whence it appears, that the priests were
brought into discipline by this law, lest they should think themselves
more free than the rest of the people, thus might indulge themselves in
security; and this is afterwards more clearly expressed where God
admonishes them to “keep his ordinance,”  <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) (<span id="iii.v.iii-p38.2"></span>[Le
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.v.iii-p38.2"></span>:) *i.e.,* diligently to observe whatever He
commanded; and the greater dignity He had honored them with, that the
greater should be their study to persevere in the exercises of piety;
for he shews them that so far from their sacerdotal rights conducing to
the alleviation of their sin, they were more strongly bound by them to
keep the Law.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p39"></span><span id="iii.v.iii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iii-p40"></span>**10** *There shall no stranger.* It was
also necessary to add this, that the majesty of sacred things might not
be impaired; for if it had been promiscuously permitted to all to eat of
the sacred bread and the other oblations, the people would have
straightway inferred that they differed not from ordinary food. And
unless the avarice of the priests had been thus anticipated,  <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) an unworthy trade would have
prevailed; for banquets would have been see up for sale, and the
priest’s house would have been a kind of provision-market. The
prohibition, therefore, that the meats offered in sacrifice should be
eaten by strangers, was not made so much with reference to them as to
the priests, who would have else driven a profitable trade with the
offerings, or, by gratifying their guests, would not have hesitated to
bring disrepute on the whole service of God. The Law consequently
prohibits that either a sojourner, or a hired servant, should eat of
them; and only gives this permission to their slaves, and those who were
incorporated into their families. Moreover, He counts the priests’
daughters who had married into another tribe as aliens. The sum has this
tendency, that whatsoever depends on the service of God should obtain
its due reverence; nor could this be the case, if what was offered in
the temple were not distinguished from common food. Inasmuch as they
were human beings, they were allowed to subsist in the ordinary manner;
yet was this distinction necessary, which might savor of the sanctity of
Christ. This was the cleanness of the priests as regarded food.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p42"></span><span id="iii.v.iii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iii-p43"></span>**14.** *And if a man eat of the holy
thing unwittingly.* A question may here arise, why God would have
satisfaction made to the priests, if any one should have eaten of the
offerings; for they deserved punishment rather than reward, if they had
suffered sacred things to be brought into contempt by their promiscuous
use. But the error of those is here dealt with, who had not reserved for
the priests their lawful share. A portion, as we shall see, was assigned
by God, which they were to set aside before they tasted any part of the
victim; those, therefore, who had sinned by inadvertency, are commanded
by Him to expiate their fault, to restore so much to the priest, and to
add a fifth part. And this was done with the object of which we have
spoken, lest, if the things offered to God were exposed to common use,
religion should be brought into contempt. What follows afterwards, “and
they shall not profane the holy things,” I interpret as addressed to the
priests themselves; for this sentence is connected with the previous
one, in which the injunctions were directed to the priests alone; and
this is further confirmed by the next verse, which declares that the
whole people would be accomplices in the sin of the priests if they
should have polluted the sacred oblations. For thus I take the words,
“that they should not suffer *the people* to bear the iniquity,” or the
punishment of the transgression, if the unclean should have touched
things offered to God. For as the priest is the mediator of
reconciliation to propitiate God towards men, so his impiety is a common
iniquity, which brings guilt upon all. The translation which some give,
“that they should not lade themselves,”  <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) is further from the sense, and
altogether wrested. Finally, God again declares that in proportion to
the greatness of the honor which He had put upon them, would be the
heaviness and inexcusableness of the crime, if they acted unworthily of
their calling.
