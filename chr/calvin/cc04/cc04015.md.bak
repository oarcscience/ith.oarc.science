<span id="ii.vi.i-p3"></span>**9.** When the host goeth forth against
thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing.

<span id="ii.vi.i-p4"></span>**9.** Quum egressus fueris in exercitu
contra hostes tuos, cave ab omni re mala.

<span id="ii.vi.i-p5"></span>**10.** If there be among you any man, that
is not clean by reason uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then
shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

<span id="ii.vi.i-p6"></span>**10.** Si fuerit in te quispiam non of
mundus casu nocturno, egredietur extra castra, nec ingredietur in medium
castrorum

<span id="ii.vi.i-p7"></span>**11.** But it shall be, when evening
cometh on, he shall wash *himself* with water: and when the sun is down,
he shall come into the camp *again.*

<span id="ii.vi.i-p8"></span>**11.** quum autem aspexerit vesperum,
lavabit se aqua: et quum occubuerit sol, ingredietur castra.

<span id="ii.vi.i-p9"></span>**12.** Thou shalt have a place also
without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:

<span id="ii.vi.i-p10"></span>**12.** Locus etiam erit tibi extra
castra, egredierisque illuc foras.

<span id="ii.vi.i-p11"></span>**13.** And thou shalt have a paddle upon
thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou
shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh
from thee:

<span id="ii.vi.i-p12"></span>**13.** Paxillus item erit tibi inter vasa
tua, et quando desidebis extra, fodies ipso, et conversus operies
excrementa tua.

<span id="ii.vi.i-p13"></span>**14.** For the LORD thy God walketh in
the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies
before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean
thing in thee, and turn away from thee.

<span id="ii.vi.i-p14"></span>**14.** Jehova enim Deus ambulat per
medium castrorum tuorum, ut eripiat te, et tradat inimicos tuos coram
te. Sit igitur in castris tuis sanctitas, ne videat in te turpitudinem
aliquam, et avertatur abs te.

<span id="ii.vi.i-p16"></span><span id="ii.vi.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i-p17"></span>**9.** *When the host goeth forth.* What
he had taught with respect to the preservation of purity at home, and in
time of peace, he now extends to times of war also, so that they might
keep themselves clean from all defilement even in the midst of the clang
of arms. We know how greatly laws are disregarded during war, when all
things are under the control of violence rather than reason; and we know
that much license is wont to be given to soldiers, which would be by no
means tolerated in peace. God would remedy this evil by requiring the
Israelites to aim at the same purity in war as in peace; for this is a
special law which forbids their being dissolute and unruly in war-time,
as He has before condemned all impurity in general, as if He had said,
that under no pretext would they be excusable, if they neglect the duty
of cultivating habits of purity. For He does not command them to be
cautious in the army and in the camp, as if they might sin with impunity
when at home, but admonishes them that God would by no means excuse them
although they should allege the necessity of war. Much more would the
crime be aggravated, if they should pollute themselves in peace and when
their minds were calm. Whence we gather that it is vain to catch at
empty excuses for the violation of God’s commands in any respect; for,
however difficult the performance of duty may be, still God never
resigns His rights. Now, if war, which seems to dispense with laws, does
not excuse crime, much greater, as I have said, shall their guilt be
accounted, who in a tranquil condition of life are licentiously carried
away by sin.

<span id="ii.vi.i-p18"></span><span id="ii.vi.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i-p19"></span>**10.** *If there be among you.* He
enumerates two kinds of pollution, whereby the Israelites may know what
is meant by their keeping from the “wicked thing.” First, He pronounces
to be unclean, and casts out of the camp those who may have had a filthy
dream, until they shall have washed themselves in the evening. Secondly,
He forbids them to defile the camp with what passes from the bowels; and
not only this, but, even when they have gone outside the camp, He
commands them to bury their excrement beneath the earth, lest any
filthiness should appear. Yet it is probable that, by *synecdoche,*
everything is referred to which rendered men unclean and polluted. But
Moses, speaking as to soldiers, considered it sufficient to tell them
briefly, that although they might be occupied with war, cleanliness must
still be attended to. By “what chanceth at night*,*” all are agreed in
understanding a flow of semen; from whence we infer how greatly impurity
defiles a man, since uncleanness is contracted even from foul dreams. As
to the second part, some desire to appear quick and clever by attacking
Moses, because he has introduced among the precepts of holiness, that
none should relieve his bowels in the camp. Forsooth, they say, the
smell might offend the nostrils of God! But their silly petulance is
easily rebutted; for God would by such rudiments keep His ancient people
in the way of duty, lest liberty even in the most trifling things should
lead them onwards to audacity. If they had been permitted to defile
every part of the camp, the people would presently have been hardened
against filthiness of every sort. Thus they were held back by this rein,
that they might more earnestly apply their minds to spiritual integrity.
They also are mistaken who suppose that this was a sanitary precaution,
lest the smell should produce diseases, and be injurious to their bodily
health. For Moses plainly declares that he not only had regard to what
was wholesome, or even to what was decent in the eyes of men; but rather
that he would accustom the people to abhor uncleanness, and to keep
themselves pure and unpolluted — for he adds, that God presided in the
camp, to protect them from the power and assaults of their enemies; and
that they should fear, lest, if they should contaminate the camp, He
would be offended with their filthiness and forsake them. The sum is,
that when they have need of God’s assistance, and are engaged in war
against their enemies, the pursuit of holiness must not be omitted or
neglected even in the midst of arms.
