altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up
*any* iron *tool* upon them.

LORD thy God of whole stones; and thou shalt offer burnt offerings
thereon unto the LORD thy God:

altare Jehovae Dei tui: et offeres super illud holocausta Jehovae Deo

<span id="iii.iii.ix-p11"></span>**5** *And there shalt thou build an
altar.* At their first entrance into the land, God commands that a
sacrifice of thanksgiving should be offered to Him; and this Joshua
performed, as is related in <span id="iii.iii.ix-p11.1"></span>[Jos
8:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/jos008.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.iii.ix-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.ix-p12"></span>"Then Joshua built an altar unto the
Lord God of Israel in Mount Ebal;  
as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel,  
an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron."

<span id="iii.iii.ix-p13"></span>First of all, then, this testimony of
their gratitude is required, that the children of Israel, as soon as
they have begun to set foot in the land of Canaan, might celebrate the
praises of the Lord; secondly, he forbids all artificial work, because,
if the altar had been permanent, it would have been an occasion of
superstition, and this exceptional instance would have been more
regarded than the perpetual Law of God. Hence the nine tribes and half
were so greatly wroth against the two tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half
Manasseh, on account of the altar which was built on the bank of Jordan,
(<span id="iii.iii.ix-p13.1"></span>[Joshua
22](../../../bib/kjv/jos022.htm#000.md)<span
id="iii.iii.ix-p13.1"></span>,) insomuch that they determined utterly to
destroy their brethren, until they had cleared themselves by alleging
that they had only built it as a memorial of their brotherly union, and
not for sacrifice. Assuredly they were good expounders of the Law who
accounted it an inexpiable crime, that an altar should be left for
posterity, to withdraw the people from the one sanctuary, and thus to
destroy the unity of faith.
