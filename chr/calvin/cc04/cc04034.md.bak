This law specially refers to the keeping of the Passover. God had before
forbidden the use of leaven; and He now enacts the punishment to be
inflicted, if any should neglect the prohibition, and mingle leaven with
the Paschal feast. But it is not without reason that we have postponed
to this place what Moses has joined together with the institution of the
Passover; for the plan proposed by us demands that the political laws,
which sanction God’s worship by the denunciation of punishments, should
occupy their peculiar place. From the punishment it appears that,
although it may be in itself a trifling matter to abstain from leaven,
(as Paul teaches that “bodily exercise profiteth little,” <span
id="ii.x.ix-p9.1"></span>[1Ti 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.x.ix-p9.1"></span>,) yet, inasmuch as in this ceremony the
redemption of the people was kept in memory, it was a very gross crime
not to observe whatever God had prescribed, for we must estimate the
importance of the rites of the law from their object.  <span
