### 74. *Concerning the King of* <span class="small">MEDYÂM</span>

   The king of <span class="small">MEDYÂM</span> was of the seed of
<span class="small">SHEM</span>. For of the seed of <span
class="small">ISAAC</span> was <span class="small">ESAU</span>, who went
forth from his mother's womb with <span class="small">JACOB</span>
clinging to the sole of his foot; and <span class="small">JACOB</span>
carried away the right of the firstborn from <span
class="small">ESAU</span> for the sake of a mess of pottage. And the
name of <span class="small">ESAU'S</span> kingdom was called, according
to his name of contempt, "<span class="small">EDOM</span>", for the
interpretation of "<span class="small">EDOM</span>" is "lentiles"; and
because of this the seed of <span class="small">ESAU</span> were called
"<span class="small">EDOMITES</span>". For through the greed of his
belly he forsook and lost the right of the firstborn of the seed of
<span class="small">SHEM</span>. For unless the soul be restrained by
temperance, it will bring down into a net the whole of the lust of the
belly which is of the body. For the body is greedy, but temperance
restraineth the soul, and therefore <span class="small">PAUL</span>
said, "That which the soul doth not wish the body wisheth; and that
which the body doth not wish the soul wisheth, and each contendeth
against the other."<span id="page_126_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_126_note_1) If a man willeth a
thing, and his soul bandeth itself with the desire of his body he
becometh like the Devil; but if he restraineth his body, and his soul
bandeth itself with his desire he becometh like <span
class="small">CHRIST</span>. For the Apostles say that <span
class="small">CHRIST</span> is the Head of every man who travelleth upon
the straight road. And our Lord said unto His disciples, "Walk in the
Spirit, and perform ye not the lust of your bodies."<span
id="page_126_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_126_note_2) And <span
id="page_127">p. 127</span> when they heard this they forsook all the
lust of the flesh, and they said unto our Lord, "Behold now, we have
forsaken everything and followed Thee; what is our reward?" And our
Saviour said unto them, "Ye have made your bodies like unto those of the
angels, and shall do mighty deeds even as do I. And behold, I have given
you authority to raise the dead, and I have given you power to heal the
sick, and ye shall trample upon all the power of the Enemy. And at My
second coming ye shall judge and shall put to shame the Twelve Tribes of
<span class="small">ISRAEL</span>, because they have not believed on Me,
and have treated My glory with contempt. And as for those who believe in
Me, ye shall magnify them and shall make them to rejoice with you in My
kingdom."<span id="page_127_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_127_note_1)
