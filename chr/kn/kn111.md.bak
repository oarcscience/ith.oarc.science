### 111. *Concerning His Ascension and His Second Coming*

   Thus all the Prophets and many of the early Fathers prophesied
concerning His Ascension and His Second Coming to judge the living and
the dead.

   And <span class="small">DAVID</span> said concerning His
Resurrection, "He hath gone up into the heights. Thou hast made captive
captivity, and hast given grace to the children of men."<span
id="page_216_fr_9"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">9</span></sup>](#page_216_note_9.md) And he also said, Having
gone forth, I will <span id="page_217">p. 217</span> come back, and I
will return from the abyss of the sea."<span
id="page_217_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_217_note_1.md) And again he said, "Sing
ye unto God Who hath gone up into the heavens, the heavens which are
opposite the morning."<span id="page_217_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_217_note_2.md)

   Thus <span class="small">AMOS</span> the Prophet prophesied and said,
"The Messiah, Who made the time of the morning, hath come and is exalted
from the earth into the heights: and His Name is God Who ruleth all
things."<span id="page_217_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_217_note_3.md)

   Thus prophesied <span class="small">DAVID</span> the Prophet and
said, "Thou art exalted, O Lord, by Thy might, and we will praise and
hymn Thy strength."<span id="page_217_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_217_note_4.md)

   Thus prophesied <span class="small">ZECHARIAH</span> the Prophet and
said, "His foot standeth on the Mount of Olives to the east of <span
class="small">JERUSALEM</span>. And He rideth upon the Cherubim, and He
flieth upon the wing of the winds."<span
id="page_217_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_217_note_5.md)

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> said, "Open ye the gates of the
princes, and let the doors which were from the creation be opened, and
the King of glory shall come! Who is this King of glory? God, the mighty
and strong One, God, the mighty One in battle." And he also made known
and said, "Open ye the gates of princes, and let the doors which were
from the creation be opened, and the King of glory shall come! Who is
this King of glory? The Lord God of Hosts is this King."<span
id="page_217_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_217_note_6.md)

   And again concerning His coming—He shall judge the living and the
dead—He to Whom belongeth glory for ever and ever. Amen.

   Thus <span class="small">ZECHARIAH</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "That day the Lord my God shall come, and all His saints with
Him."<span id="page_217_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_217_note_7.md)

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "God spake once, and this according \[to what\] I have heard:
Compassion belongeth unto God. And Thine, O Lord, <span id="page_218">p.
218</span> is the power, for Thou wilt reward every man according to his
work."<span id="page_218_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_218_note_1.md)

   Thus spake <span class="small">DANIEL</span> the Prophet and said, "I
saw in my vision by night, and behold, there came \[one\] like unto the
Son of man to the Ancient of Days, and there were given unto him
dominion, and glory, and sovereignty, and all the nations and peoples
and countries shall serve Him, and His dominion shall have no end for
ever and ever. Amen."<span id="page_218_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_218_note_2.md)

   And all the Prophets prophesied, and nothing that hath happened hath
been without the prophecy of the Prophets. And they have declared
everything that hath happened, and what shall happen, what hath been
done and what shall be done, and that which belongeth to the times of
old and that which belongeth to the latter days up to His Second Coming.
And this they have done not only by what they have prophesied and
declared, but together with their prophecies they have given
manifestations of Him in their bodies. And there was a famine in the
land of <span class="small">CANAAN</span>, and our father <span
class="small">ABRAHAM</span> went down to <span
class="small">EGYPT</span>, and came back with much riches and honour
without blemish. And in like manner our Redeemer went down and delivered
the Church, the Assembly of the Nations, and He went up \[again\],
having gotten honour and praise.
