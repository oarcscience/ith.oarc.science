### 43. *How the men of the Army of* <span class="small">ISRAEL</span> *received* \[*their*\] *orders*

   And the city rejoiced because the King had made his son King, and had
appointed him King from his own territory to that of another. But the
city sorrowed also because the King had commanded that they should give
their children who were called "firstborn". And those who were on the
right hand should sit in the same way as their fathers sat with King
<span class="small">SOLOMON</span>, even so should they sit at the right
hand of his son <span class="small">DAVID</span>, the King of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>; and those who were on the left hand
should sit as their fathers sat with King <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span>, even so should they sit on the left hand
of his son <span class="small">DAVID</span>, the King of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>; and their rank should be like that of
their fathers, and their names should be like those of their fathers.
And each should be according to his ordinance, and each according to his
greatness, and each according to his position of authority, and each
according to his wages, and each according to his rank; in this wise
shall they be. As <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> did to his nobles
so shall <span class="small">DAVID</span> do to his nobles; and as <span
id="page_62">p. 62</span> <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> ordained
for his governors so shall <span class="small">DAVID</span> order the
direction of his house.

   And the names of those who were appointed to be sent away were
these:—

   <span class="small">’AZÂRYÂS</span> (<span
class="small">AZARIAH</span>), the son of <span
class="small">ZÂDÔK</span>, the priest, who was the high priest.  
   <span class="small">’ÊLYÂS</span>, the son of <span
class="small">’ARNÎ</span> the Archdeacon; now the father of <span
class="small">’ARNÎ</span> was the Archdeacon of <span
class="small">NATHAN</span> the prophet.  
   <span class="small">’ADRÂM</span>, the son of <span
class="small">’ARDĔRÔNES</span>, leader of the peoples.  
   <span class="small">FANḲÊRÂ</span>, the son of <span
class="small">SÔBÂ</span>, scribe of the oxen.  
   <span class="small">’AKÔNḤÊL</span>, the son of <span
class="small">TÔFÊL</span>, the youth.  
   <span class="small">SÂMNĔYÂS</span>, the son of <span
class="small">’AKÎTÂLAM</span>, the recorder.  
   <span class="small">FIḲÂRÔS</span>, the son of <span
class="small">NĔYÂ</span>, commander of the armed men, that is to say,
chief of the troops.  
   <span class="small">LÊWÂNDÔS</span>, the son of <span
class="small">’AKÎRÊ</span>, commander of the recruits (?).  
   <span class="small">FÂḲÛTÊN</span>, the son of <span
class="small">’ADRÂY</span>, commander on the sea.  
   <span class="small">MÂTÂN</span>, the son of <span
class="small">BENYÂS</span>, chief of the house.  
   <span class="small">AD‛ARAZ</span>, the son of <span
class="small">KÎRÊM</span>, servant of decorations.  
   <span class="small">DALAKĔM</span>, the son of <span
class="small">MÂTRÊM</span>, chief of the horse-soldiers.  
   <span class="small">’ADARYÔS</span>, the son of <span
class="small">NÊDRÔS</span>, chief of the foot-soldiers.  
   <span class="small">’AWSTĔRÂN</span>, the son of <span
class="small">YÔDÂD</span>, bearer of the "glory".  
   <span class="small">’ASTAR’AYÔN</span>, the son of <span
class="small">’ASÂ</span>, messenger of the palace (?).  
   <span class="small">ÎMÎ</span>, the son of <span
class="small">MATÂTYÂS</span>, commander of the host (?)  
   <span class="small">MÂKRÎ</span>, the son of <span
class="small">’ABÎSÂ</span>, judge of the palace.  
   <span class="small">’ABÎS</span>, the son of <span
class="small">KÂRYÔS</span>, assessor of taxes (tithes ?).  
   <span class="small">LÎK WENDEYÔS</span>, the son of <span
class="small">NÊLENTEYÔS</span>, judge of assembly.  
   <span class="small">KÂRMÎ</span>, the son of <span
class="small">ḤAḌNĔYÂS</span>, chief of the royal workmen.  
   <span class="small">SERÂNYÂS</span>, the son of <span
class="small">’AKÂZ’ÊL</span>, administrator of the King's house.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

   These are all those who were given to <span
class="small">DAVID</span>, king of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>,
the son of <span class="small">SOLOMON</span>, King of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>. And <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> also
gave him horses, and chariots, and riding-camels, and mules, and wagons
for carrying loads, and gold, and silver, and splendid apparel, and
byssus, and purple, and gems, and pearls and precious stones; and he
gave his son everything that would be wished for in the country of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>.

   And then they made ready to set out, and \[though\] there was great
joy with the nobles of the King of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>,
there was sadness with the nobles of the King of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>, because through the firstborn son of <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span>, King of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>,
that is to say, the King of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, the
firstborn sons of the nobles of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span> were
given to rule over the country of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>
with the son of <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> the King. Then they
assembled together and wept, together with their fathers, and their
mothers, and their relations, and their kinsfolk, and their peoples, and
their countrymen. And they cursed the King secretly and reviled him
because he had seized their sons against their will. But unto the King
they said, "Because of this thou hast done well. Thy wisdom is so good
that the kingdom of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>, by the Will of
God and by thy wisdom, extendeth to the country of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>. And God will gather together the other
kingdoms \[of the world\] into thy hand, for thou hast a right mind
towards God, and thou wishest that they shall serve the God of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>, and that idols may be destroyed out of the
world."

   And they praised him and said unto him, "Now know we that God spake
concerning thee to our father <span class="small">ABRAHAM</span> \[when
He said\], 'In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.'"
And they made their faces to appear happy, and they jested before him,
and they praised him exceedingly (i.e., fulsomely) because of his
wisdom. And when they said these things unto him, he understood them in
\[his\] wisdom, and bore with them <span id="page_64">p. 64</span>
patiently; now God beareth with us patiently knowing well all our sins.
And the whole earth, and the heavens, and the ends of the world, and the
sea, and the dry land, are the kingdom of God. He judgeth. And He hath
given the earth to the king to be subject unto him, that he may judge
(or, rule), as He doth, those who do evil so that he may requite them
with evil, and those who do good so that he may reward them with good.
For the Spirit of God resteth in the heart of the king, and His hands
are in his mind, and His knowledge is in his understanding.
