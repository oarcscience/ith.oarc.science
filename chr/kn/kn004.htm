And because of this envy <SMALL>CAIN</SMALL> killed <SMALL>ABEL</SMALL>. Thus fratricide was first created through <SMALL>SATAN'S</SMALL> envy of the children of <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL>. And having killed his brother, <SMALL>CAIN</SMALL> fell into a state of trembling and horrible fright, and he was repulsed by his father and his Lord. And [then] <SMALL>SETH</SMALL> was born, and <SMALL>ADAM</SMALL>
