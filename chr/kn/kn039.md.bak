### 39. *How they made the Son of* <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> *King*

   And they made ready the ointment of the oil of kingship, and the
sounds of the large horn, and the small horn, and the flute and the
pipes, and the harp and the drum filled the air; and the city resounded
with cries of joy and gladness. And they brought the young man into the
Holy of Holies, and he laid hold upon the horns of the altar, and
sovereignty was given unto him by the mouth of <span
class="small">ZADOK</span> the priest, and by the mouth of <span
class="small">JOAS</span> (<span class="small">BENAIAH</span>) the
priest, the commander of the army of King <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span>, and he anointed him with the holy oil of
the ointment of kingship. And he went out from the house of the Lord,
and they called his name <span class="small">DAVID</span>, for the name
of a king came to him by the law. And they made him to ride upon the
mule of King <span class="small">SOLOMON</span>, and they led him round
about the city, and said, "We have appointed thee from this moment"; and
then they cried out to him, "Bâḥ \[Long\] live the royal father!" And
there were some who said, "It is meet and right that thy dominion of
<span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> shall be from the River of <span
class="small">EGYPT</span> to the west of the sun (i.e., to the setting
sun); blessed be thy seed upon the earth!—and from <span
class="small">SHOA</span> to the east of <span
class="small">INDIA</span>, for thou wilt please \[the people of these
lands\]. And the Lord God of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span> shall be
unto thee a guide, and the Tabernacle of the Law of God shall be with
all that thou lookest upon. And all thine enemies and foes shall be
overthrown before thee, and completion and finish shall be <span
id="page_54">p. 54</span> unto thee and unto thy seed after thee; thou
shalt judge many nations and none shall judge thee." And again his
father blessed him and said unto him, "The blessing of heaven and earth
shall be thy blessing," and all the congregation of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> said, "Amen." And his father also said unto
<span class="small">ZADOK</span> the priest, "Make him to know and tell
him concerning the judgment and decree of God which he shall observe
there" \[in <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>\].
