### 106. *A Prophecy concerning the Coming of* <span class="small">CHRIST</span>

   And now hearken how each one of them hath prophesied concerning Him,
\[for the narrative\] is pleasant to hear. <span
class="small">ISAIAH</span> the Prophet prophesied concerning His coming
and said, "A Son is born unto us. A Child is given unto us. Dominion is
written upon His shoulder. He is God, strong in rule, King, great
Counsellor is His name."<span id="page_201_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_201_note_1.md) Now the meaning of this
is manifest: the Son of God is born, Whose sovereignty was written down
before the world was, and He is wiser than anyone else: \[this is what\]
he saith unto thee. And again <span class="small">ISAIAH</span>
prophesied and said, "Behold My servant Whom I have chosen, on Whom is
the delight of My soul, and the nations shall put their confidence in
Him."<span id="page_201_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_201_note_2.md) And these words give us
to understand that <span class="small">CHRIST</span> is the Spirit of
God, the Word of the Father Who put on our flesh and was born for us:
and the peoples of <span class="small">RÔMÊ</span> and <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> and all other nations have believed in
Him. And he spake unto the people of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>,
and again he prophesied, saying, "Many shall follow after Thee with
their loins girded up, and their backs bound with fetters, and they
shall pray to Thee and worship Thee, for thou art God, and we have not
recognized Thee."<span id="page_201_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_201_note_3.md) Now this he spake
concerning the martyrs, and those who became monks in the desert and
solitary monks, whose hearts were fettered with His commandment, and who
prayed to Him, meaning that reward was meet for both the martyrs and the
solitary monks. "And we did not recognize Thee": <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> made itself blind, and crucified Him, and
refused to walk in His righteousness. And again <span
class="small">ISAIAH</span> prophesied and said, "God shall come, and
the heathen shall put their trust in Him and shall know Him";<span
id="page_201_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_201_note_4.md) this meaneth that <span
class="small">CHRIST</span> shall come, and the <span
class="small">JEWS</span> shall reject Him, but the heathen shall
believe <span id="page_202">p. 202</span> in Him. And again he
prophesied and said, "Be strong ye weak hands and tired knees, and
rejoice ye hearts that are cast down, for God hath come, Who shall
requite our debt, and save us. And He shall open the eyes of the blind,
and He shall make the ears of the deaf to hear, and the feet that are
lame shall run, and the tongues of the dumb shall speak."<span
id="page_202_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_202_note_1.md) These words are spoken
in respect of those who err in worshipping idols, and those who are dead
in sin, and those whose hearts are darkened, and of you who do not know
that God created you. Rejoice ye this day: He hath come Who will redeem
the sin of <span class="small">ADAM</span>, and make <span
class="small">ADAM'S</span> debt His own. He was crucified being
sinless. He hath killed Death by means of His own death, and the blind
see, and the lame walk, and the deaf hear, and the dumb speak
unhaltingly, and besides all these things the dead are raised. This is
the meaning of this prophecy.

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "God shall come in visible form, and our God will not keep
silence."<span id="page_202_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_202_note_2.md)

   Thus <span class="small">JEREMIAH</span> prophesied and said, "God
shall come down upon the earth, and shall walk about with men like
us."<span id="page_202_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span

   Thus Ezekiel the Prophet prophesied and said, "I your God will come,
and I will walk about among them, and they shall know Me that I am their
God."<span id="page_202_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> prophesied and said, "Blessed
is He Who cometh in the name of God: we have blessed you in the Name of

"The heavenly <span class="small">EMMANUEL</span> shall come and shall
deliver the work which He hath fashioned with His own hand from the hand

   Thus his father <span class="small">DAVID</span> prophesied and said,
"He shall come down like the dew upon wool, and like the drop which

rising of the sun to the setting thereof shall My Name be praised among

in the heavens and in the earth, in the sea and in the abysses. And to
Him be praise for ever and ever! Amen.
