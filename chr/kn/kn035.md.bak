### 35. *How King* <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> *sent to his son the commander of his army*

   And <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> the King sent the commander of
his army, on whose hand he was wont to lean, with gifts and meat and
drink to entertain that traveller. And the commander set out with a
great number of wagons, and he came to <span class="small">BAYNA
LEḤKEM</span>, and embraced him, and gave him everything that <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> the King had sent unto him. And he said
unto him, "Make haste and come with me, for the heart of the King is
burnt up as with fire with the love of thee. Peradventure he will find
out for himself whether thou art his own son or his brother; for in
thine appearance and in thy conversation (or, manner) thou art in no way
different from him. And now, rise up quickly, for my lord the King said
unto me, 'Haste and bring him hither to me in honour, and comfort, and
with suitable service, and in joy and gladness.'" And the young man
answered and said unto him, "I thank God, the Lord of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>, that I have found grace with my lord the
King without having seen his face; his word hath rejoiced me. And now I
will put my trust in the Lord of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span> that
He will show me the King, and will bring me back safely to my mother the
Queen, and to my country <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>."

   And <span class="small">JOAS</span> (?), the son of <span
class="small">YÔDÂḤÊ</span>,<span id="page_43_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_43_note_1.md) the commander of the army
of King <span class="small">SOLOMON</span>, answered and said unto <span
class="small">BAYNA LEḤKEM</span>, "My lord, this is a very small
matter, and thou wilt find far greater joy and pleasure with my lord the
King. And as concerning what thou sayest, 'my mother' and 'my country',
<span class="small">SOLOMON</span> the King is better than thy mother,
and this our country is better than thy country. And as for thy country,
we have heard that it is a land of cold and cloud, and <span
id="page_44">p. 44</span> a country of glare and burning heat, and a
region of snow and ice. And when the sons of <span
class="small">NOAH</span>, <span class="small">SHEM</span>, and <span
class="small">HAM</span>, and <span class="small">JAPHET</span>, divided
the world among them, they looked on thy country with wisdom and saw
that, although it was spacious and broad, it was a land of whirlwind and
burning heat, and \[therefore\] gave it to <span
class="small">CANAAN</span>, the son of <span class="small">HAM</span>,
as a portion for himself and his seed for ever. But the land that is
ours is the land of inheritance (i.e., the promised land), which God
hath given unto us according to the oath that He swore to our fathers, a
land flowing with milk and honey, where sustenance is \[ours\] without
anxiety, a land that yieldeth fruit of every kind in its season without
exhausting labour, a land which God keepeth watch over continually from
one year to the beginning of the revolution of the next. All this is
thine, and we are thine, and we will be thine heirs, and thou shalt
dwell in our country, for thou art the seed of <span
class="small">DAVID</span>, the lord of my lord, and unto thee belongeth
this throne of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>."

   And the headmen of the merchant <span class="small">TÂMRÎN</span>
answered and said unto <span class="small">BENAIAH</span>, "Our country
is the better. The air (i.e., climate) of our country is good, for it is
without burning heat and fire, and the water of our country is good, and
sweet, and floweth in rivers, moreover the tops of our mountains run
with water. And we do not do as ye do in your country, that is to say,
dig very deep wells \[in search of\] water, and we do not die through
the heat of the sun; but even at noonday we hunt wild animals, namely,
the wild buffaloes, and gazelles, and birds, and small animals. And in
the winter God taketh heed unto us from \[one\] year to the beginning of
the course of the next. And in the springtime the people eat what they
have trodden with the foot as \[in\] the land of <span
class="small">EGYPT</span>, and as for our trees they produce good crops
of fruit, and the wheat, and the barley, and all our fruits, and cattle
are good <span id="page_45">p. 45</span> and wonderful. But there is one
thing that ye have wherein ye are better than we are, namely wisdom, and
because of it we are journeying to you."

   And <span class="small">JOAS</span> (read <span
class="small">BENAIAH</span>), the commander of the army of King <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span>, answered \[saying\], "What is better than
wisdom? For wisdom hath founded the earth, and made strong the heavens,
and fettered the waves of the sea so that it might not cover the earth.
However, rise up and let us go to my lord, for his heart is greatly
moved by love for thee, and he hath sent me to bring thee \[to him\]
with all the speed possible."

   And the son of the Queen rose up, and arrayed <span
class="small">JOAS</span> (<span class="small">BENAIAH</span>), the son
of <span class="small">YÔDÂḤÊ</span>, and the fifty men who were in his
retinue, in gorgeous raiment, and they rose up to go to <span
class="small">JERUSALEM</span> to <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> the
King. And when they came nigh unto the place where the horses were
exercised and trained, <span class="small">JOAS</span> (<span
class="small">BENAIAH</span>), the son of <span
class="small">YÔDÂḤÊ</span>, went on in front, and came to the place
where <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> was, and he told him that \[the
son of the Queen\] was well-favoured in his appearance, and that his
voice was pleasant, and that he resembled him in form, and that his
whole bearing was exceedingly noble. And the King said unto him, "Where
is he? Did I not send thee forth to bring him as quickly as possible?"
And <span class="small">JOAS</span> (<span class="small">BENAIAH</span>)
said unto him, "He is here, I will bring him quickly." And <span
class="small">JOAS</span> (<span class="small">BENAIAH</span>) went and
said unto the young man, "Rise up, O my master, and come"; and making
<span class="small">BAYNA LEḤKEM</span> to go quickly he brought him to
the King's Gate. And when all the soldiers saw him they made obeisance
unto him, and they said, "Behold, King <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> hath gone forth from his abode." And when
the men who were inside came forth, they marvelled, and they went back
to their places, and again they saw the King upon his throne; and
wondering they went forth again and looked at the young man, and they
were incapable of speaking and of saying anything. And when <span
class="small">JOAS</span> (<span class="small">BENAIAH</span>), the son
of <span id="page_46">p. 46</span> <span class="small">YÔDÂḤÊ</span>,
came in again to announce to the King the arrival of the young man,
there was none standing before the King, but all <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> had thronged outside to see him.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_43">p. 43</span>

<span id="page_43_note_1"></span>[1](#page_43_fr_1.md) There is a mistake
here. The author had in his mind Joab, the captain of David's host.
Several of the MSS. have the reading "Benyâs", i.e., Benaiah, the son of
Jehoiada (see 1 Kings ii. 35), who was put in Joab's room.
