### 70. *How* <span class="small">REHOBOAM</span> *reigned*

   Then <span class="small">ZADOK</span> the priest took <span
class="small">REHOBOAM</span> and made him king, and he anointed him and
performed for him whatsoever the Law demanded. And <span
class="small">REHOBOAM</span> laid a tablet of wood upon the Tabernacle,
and he found it with the name of his father <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> \[written upon\] it, and then they set him
upon the king's mule, and said unto him, "All hail! Long live the royal
father!" and the city resounded with cries, and the trumpet was blown.
And before <span class="small">REHOBOAM</span> could return to his
father <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> died. And they laid <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> in the tomb of his father <span
class="small">DAVID</span>, and they mourned for him with great
mourning, for there was not found his like in wisdom in those days.

   And when seven days had passed <span class="small">REHOBOAM</span>
made the mourning for his father to cease. And the people of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> gathered themselves together to <span
class="small">REHOBOAM</span>, and they said unto him, "Lighten for us
\[our\] labour, for thy father made it very heavy in the hewing of wood,
and in the dressing of stone, and in making wagons for bringing down
cedarwood." And <span class="small">REHOBOAM</span> took counsel with
the councillors and the elders of the house of the king, and they said
unto him, "Answer them graciously. For at this present thou art like a
young animal and thy loins are not able to bear the yoke. And now, speak
unto them graciously, and say unto them, 'I will do for you everything
ye wish.' And when thy hand hath gotten power over them thou <span
id="page_118">p. 118</span> canst do with thy people what thou wishest."
And <span class="small">REHOBOAM</span> drove out the elders and brought
in the foolish young men who had been brought up with him. And he took
counsel with them, and told them of the message which the house of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> had sent to him and what the elders of the
house of the king had counselled him to do. And those foolish young men
said unto him, "An aged man giveth the counsel of an aged man, and the
elder giveth the counsel of an elder, and a man stricken in years giveth
the counsel of the man who is stricken in years, and a young man like
thyself giveth the counsel which appertaineth to youth. As for these men
who are stricken in years, their loins are as tender as those of a young
animal that cannot walk. And as concerning this matter of which thou
speakest, who can dispute the command of our Lord the King?" And one of
them leaped up into the air before <span class="small">REHOBOAM</span>,
and another drew his sword, and another brandished his spear, and
another seized his bow and quiver. And when they had made an end of
their playing they counselled him, saying, "O our lord, may we be with
thee, and thou with us! Now thy father in wisdom gave us, the sons of
men of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span> who are learned in the art of
war, to grow up with thee that thy kingdom might be strong after him. O
our lord, show not a timid face to those men, lest they think that thou
art weak and art not able to make war against them and against thine
enemies. For if they see in us an attitude of weakness in word and in
deed, we shall be held in contempt by them, and they will not give us
gifts, or presents, or slaves, or tribute, and thy kingdom will be
destroyed. But address them with bold words, and speak unto them
haughtily, saying, 'In respect of my father ye say in wood and in stone,
but I will make you to serve me with chains of iron and with
scorpion-whips. For my thin flank shall be stronger than the thickest
part of my father's body, and my counsel is greater than the counsel
<span id="page_119">p. 119</span> of my father who begot me. None shall
diminish for you the labour and the forced service, nay it shall be
increased for you in every particular. And if ye will not do my command,
I will make your cattle my plunder, and your children shall be captives,
and my knife of slaughter shall consume you. And I will seize your
cities and your fields, and your plantations, and your wells, and your
gardens, and your lands, and your fruit (or, crops), and I will bind
your honourable ones in chains of iron, and your riches shall
\[provide\] food for my servants, and your women shall be for the
adornment of the house of my nobles. And I will not alter this my
decision, and will not diminish it, and I will neither make it to be a
lie nor to have no effect; and I will carry it out quickly, and will
write it down for ever. For the whole of this land was given to <span
class="small">DAVID</span> my grandfather for his kingdom, and to my
father <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> after him. And \[God\] hath
given it to me after my fathers as to them, and I will make you to serve
me as ye served them; and now take counsel and obey me.'"

   And thus also did <span class="small">REHOBOAM</span> speak unto the
elders of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>. And the people all rose up
together in their full number, and they said, "Get back to \[your\]
house\[s\], O <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>. Have we none else whom
we can make king save in the house of <span class="small">JUDAH</span>
and in the house of <span class="small">BENJAMIN</span>? We will reject
their houses and the men of both of them, and we will make as our king
and governor the man whom we wish for and in whom our soul delighteth."
And they took up their weapons of war, and fled in a body, and came to
the city of <span class="small">SAMARIA</span> of <span
class="small">BÊTH ÊFRÂTÂ</span>, where they took counsel and were
gathered together in a body. And the house of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> cast lots among themselves so that they
might make king the man whom they chose from the house of the father of
the man wherein the lot fell. And the lot fell on the house of <span
class="small">EPHRAIM</span>, on the son of <span
class="small">NÂBÂT</span>, and they <span id="page_120">p. 120</span>
chose a man from the house of his father, and made <span
class="small">JEROBOAM</span> king. And thus was the kingdom separated
from <span class="small">REHOBOAM</span>, the son of <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span>, and there were left to it only the house
of <span class="small">BENJAMIN</span> and the house of <span
class="small">JUDAH</span> his father.

   And the word which God spake unto <span class="small">DAVID</span>
His servant was not made a lie, "Of the fruit of thy body I will make to
sit upon thy throne";<span id="page_120_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_120_note_1.md) and again He said,
"Ordained like the moon for ever";<span
id="page_120_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_120_note_2.md) and again He said, "God
sware unto <span class="small">DAVID</span> truly and will not
repent."<span id="page_120_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_120_note_3.md) He Who reigned on the
throne of <span class="small">DAVID</span> His father was <span
class="small">JESUS CHRIST</span>, his kinsman in the flesh by a virgin,
Who sat upon the throne of His Godhead; and upon earth He granted to
reign upon His throne the King of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>,
<span class="small">SOLOMON'S</span> firstborn. To <span
class="small">REHOBOAM</span> God gave only two stems (or, roots); and
the King of <span class="small">RÔMÊ</span> is the youngest son of <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span>. And God did this in order that foolish
people might not call us <span class="small">JEWS</span>, because of
<span class="small">SOLOMON</span> and because of <span
class="small">REHOBOAM</span> his son—now God knoweth the heart—and He
did this that they might not imagine such a thing. They called <span
class="small">REHOBOAM</span> "King of <span
class="small">JUDAH</span>", and they called the King of <span
class="small">SAMARIA</span> "King of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>". And of the generations of <span
class="small">REHOBOAM</span>, from <span class="small">REHOBOAM</span>
to <span class="small">’ÎYÂḲÊM</span> (<span
class="small">JOACHIM</span>) were forty-one generations. And there were
born to <span class="small">MALKÎ</span> two children, <span
class="small">LEVI</span> and <span class="small">SHEM</span>, the
begetter of <span class="small">HÔNÂSÊ</span>. And <span
class="small">HÔNÂSÊ</span> begat <span class="small">ḲALÂMYÔS</span>,
and <span class="small">ḲALÂMYÔS</span> begat <span
class="small">JOACHIM</span>, and <span class="small">JOACHIM</span>
begat <span class="small">MARY</span>, the daughter of <span
class="small">DAVID</span>. And again <span class="small">’ÎLÎ</span>
begat <span class="small">MALKÎ</span>, and <span
class="small">MALKÎ</span> begat <span class="small">MÂTÎ</span>, and
<span class="small">MÂTÎ</span> begat <span class="small">’ÊLÎ</span>
and <span class="small">JACOB</span>, and <span
class="small">ḤANNA</span>, the wife of <span
class="small">JOACHIM</span>. And <span class="small">’ÊLÎ</span> took a
wife and died without children. And <span class="small">JACOB</span>
took to wife <span class="small">YÔḤADÂ</span>, the wife of <span
class="small">’ÊLÎ</span>, and he begat by her <span
class="small">JOSEPH</span> the carpenter, who was the betrothed of
<span class="small">MARY</span>. And <span class="small">JOSEPH</span>
was the son of <span class="small">JACOB</span> in the flesh and the son
of <span class="small">’ÊLÎ</span> according to the <span
id="page_121">p. 121</span> Law; now God had commanded <span
class="small">MOSES</span> that the <span
class="small">ISRAELITES</span> were to marry their kinsfolk, each in
the house of his fathers, and that they were not to marry alien women.
