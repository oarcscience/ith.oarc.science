### 75. *Concerning the King of* <span class="small">BABYLON</span>

   Now the King of <span class="small">BABYLON</span> is of the seed of
<span class="small">SHEM</span>, and we will show you clearly that the
King of <span class="small">BABYLON</span> is of the seed of <span
class="small">SHEM</span>. It came to pass in days of old that there
lived in the kingdom of <span class="small">MANASSEH</span>, the King of
<span class="small">ISRAEL</span>, a certain man whose name was <span
class="small">KARMÎN</span>, and he was a fearer of God, and he gave
many alms and oblations to the poor of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>. And when he made offerings to the house of
God, he did so with sincerity, and his tithe he gave twofold; and he was
good in all his ways, and there was no evil whatsoever before him. And
<span class="small">SATAN</span>, the enemy of all good, became envious
of him, for he saw that his course of life was good. And that man was
exceedingly rich in camels and horses, and flocks of sheep, and herds of
cattle, and gold and silver, and fine apparel, and he used to feed the
mule of the king in <span class="small">’ARMÂTÊM</span>, a city of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>. Now his native place was the country of
<span class="small">JUDAH</span>, his fathers' portion, but because of
\[his\] love for wealth he departed into <span
class="small">’ARMÂTÊM</span> to dwell there, and <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> allowed him to settle <span id="page_128">p.
128</span> there because of his riches; for he was exceedingly rich and
had many possessions, and the governors \[of <span
class="small">JUDAH</span>\] were afraid of him.
