### 105. *Concerning the belief of* <span class="small">ABRAHAM</span>

   And thou dost not understand that they were justified by faith—<span
class="small">ABRAHAM</span>, and <span class="small">DAVID</span> and
all the Prophets, one after the other, who prophesied concerning the
coming of the Son of God. And <span class="small">ABRAHAM</span> said,
"Wilt Thou in my days, O Lord, cast Thy word upon the ground?" And God
said unto him, "By no means. His time hath not yet come, but I will shew
thee a similitude of His coming. Get thee over the <span
class="small">JORDAN</span>, and dip thyself in the water as thou goest
over, and arrive at the city of <span class="small">SÂLÊM</span>, where
thou shalt meet <span class="small">MELCHIZEDEK</span>, and I will
command him to show thee the sign and similitude of Him." And <span
class="small">ABRAHAM</span> did this and he found <span
class="small">MELCHIZEDEK</span>, and he gave him the mystery of the
bread and wine,<span id="page_200_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_200_note_2) that same which is
celebrated in our Passover for our salvation through our Lord <span
class="small">JESUS CHRIST</span>. This was the desire and the joy of
<span class="small">ABRAHAM</span> as he went round the altar which
<span class="small">MELCHIZEDEK</span> had made, carrying branch and
palm on the day of the Sabbath. See how he rejoiced in his belief, and
see how he was justified by his belief, O blind <span
class="small">JEW</span>, who though having eyes seest not, and having
ears hearest not, even as the Prophet <span class="small">ISAIAH</span>
saith concerning you, "Their eyes are blind, and their hearts are
covered with darkness, so that they may not understand and God may not
show compassion unto them."<span id="page_200_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_200_note_3)
