### 101. *Concerning Him that existeth in Everything and Everywhere*

   And again God said unto <span class="small">MOSES</span>: "Make for
Me an open space before the courtyard of the Tabernacle; no man who is
impure sexually and unclean shall come there, and no one who is not
pure. For I am there, and not only there, but in every place like
thereunto where My Name is invoked in purity. I was with <span
class="small">DANIEL</span> in the den \[of lions\], and I was with
<span class="small">JONAH</span> in the belly of the great fish, and I
was with <span class="small">JOSEPH</span> in the pit, and I was with
<span class="small">JEREMIAH</span> in the well \[fed from\] the lake. I
stand under the deepest deep so that the mountains may not sink down
under the waters; and I am under the waters so that they may not sink
down upon the fire, and sulphur; I stand under the fire and sulphur so
that they may not sink down upon the winds and the rust. I am under the
winds and the rusty fog so that they may not sink down under the
darkness. And I stand under the deepest darkness and under the abysses,
and every created thing supporteth itself on Me, and everything which I
have created cometh to Me as a place of refuge.

   "I am above the earth, and I am at the ends of the world, and I am
Master of everything. I am in the air, My place of abode, and I am above
the chariot of the Cherubim, and I am praised everlastingly by all the
angels and by holy men. And I am above the heights of heaven, and I fill
everything. I am above the Seven Heavens. I see everything, and I test
everything, and there is nothing that is hidden from Me. I am in every
place, and there is no other god besides Me, neither in the heaven above
nor in the earth beneath; there is none like unto Me, saith God; My hand
hath laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand hath made
strong the heavens; I and My Son and the Holy Spirit."
