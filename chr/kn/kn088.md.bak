### 88. *How he himself related to his mother how they made him King*

   "And when these had become silent there rose up the priest who gave
us the Commandments, with the fear of God, and he shed tears whilst our
bodies quaked and our tears flowed down. God is indeed, without
falsehood, in our hearts, and He dwelleth in His commandment. And His
commandment is uttered, and it removeth itself not from those who love
Him and who keep His commandment, and He is with them continually. And
now, hearken to the judgment and laws which the elders and the sons of
the mighty men of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span> brought, which they
wrote before King <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> and have given unto
us, so that we may not turn aside either to the right hand or to the
left from what they have commanded us. And also they told us and made us
to understand that we bear death and life, and that we are like unto a
man who hath fire in his left hand and water in his right, and who can
put his hand into <span id="page_151">p. 151</span> whichever he
pleaseth. For punishment and life are written therein; for those who
have done evil, punishment, and for those who have done good, life."

   And <span class="small">’ÊLMĔYÂS</span> and <span
class="small">AZARIAH</span> brought forth that writing which was
written before God and before the King of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>, and they read it before <span
class="small">MÂKĔDÂ</span> and before the great men of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>. And when they heard these words all those
who were round about, both small and great, bowed down and made
obeisance, and they glorified God Who had made them hear these words and
had given them this commandment, so that they might perform the justice
and judgment of God. And moreover, He made them members of His house,
for <span class="small">ZION</span> was among them, and she is the
habitation of the glory of God, and she delivered them from all evil,
and blessed the fruit of their lands, and multiplied their sheep and
cattle, and blessed their wells of water, and blessed their labours, and
the fruit of their gardens, and made their children to grow up, and
protected their aged men, and became the foreguard and rearguard
wheresoever they dwelt, and vanquished their enemies wheresoever they
went. And all the people of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>
rejoiced.

   And the Queen said unto her son, "My son, God hath given unto thee
the right, walk thou therein and withdraw not thyself from it, neither
to the right hand nor the left. And love thou the Lord thy God, for He
is merciful unto the simple-minded. For His way is known from His
commandment, and His goodness is comprehended through the guidance of
His word."

   Then she turned towards <span class="small">’ÊLMĔYÂS</span> and <span
class="small">AZARIAH</span> and all the mighty men of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> \[saying\], "Do ye protect him and teach him
the path of the kingdom of God, and the honour of our Lady <span
class="small">ZION</span>. And whatsoever our Lady loveth not let us not
do. Tell us \[this\] truly and carefully for ever and from generation to
generation, so that she may not be wroth with us, if we do not <span
id="page_152">p. 152</span> perform her service well, so that God may
dwell with us. And thou, my son, hearken unto the word of thy fathers,
and walk in their counsel. And let not drink make thee foolish, nor
women, nor pride of apparel, nor the bridles and trappings of horses,
nor the sight of the weapons of war of those who are at the head or at
the rear. But let thy confidence be in God and in <span
class="small">ZION</span>, the Tabernacle of the Law of God, thy
Creator, so that thou mayest vanquish thine enemy, and so that thy seed
upon the earth may multiply, and so that thy foes and adversaries, near
and far, may be overthrown."

   And those sons of mighty men answered and said with one voice, "O our
Lady, we are with you always, and we will remember the lord, the King.
Behold, what is written and the performance thereof shall take place if
the God of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span> shall be unto him a helper,
and if he hearkeneth to the word of his mother; and we will inform him
about the path of doing good works. For there is no one to be found in
these days as wise as thyself, except our lord the King. Thou hast drawn
us hither as thy servants with our Lady, the heavenly <span
class="small">ZION</span>, the Tabernacle of the Law of the Lord our God
just as a man draweth a camel that is loaded with valuable possessions
with a little piece of thin, tough cord fastened over his nose. And now,
reject us not and treat us not as strange people, but make us like unto
thy slaves who wash thy feet, for whether we die or whether we live we
are with thee; we have no longer any hope in the country of our birth,
but only in thee and in our Lady the heavenly <span
class="small">ZION</span>, the habitation of the glory of God."
