And they brought the young man into the Holy of Holies, and he laid hold upon the horns of the altar, and sovereignty was given unto him by the mouth of <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> the priest, and by the mouth of <SMALL>JOAS</SMALL> (<SMALL>BENAIAH</SMALL>) the priest, the commander of the army of King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL>, and he anointed him with the holy oil of the ointment of kingship.

And his father also said unto <SMALL>ZADOK</SMALL> the priest, "Make him to know and tell him concerning the judgment and decree of God which he shall observe there" [in <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>].</P>
