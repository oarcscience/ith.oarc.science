### 79. *Concerning the King of* <span class="small">AMALEK</span>

   And it came to pass that when the elder daughter of <span
class="small">LOT</span> had brought forth her son, she said unto the
younger daughter, "Come now, let us make our father drink wine, so that
thou also mayest company with him that, peradventure, thou mayest get
offspring." And again they prepared wine, and again they spoke to him
the words of foolishness, and said unto him, "Drink wine, O our father,
so that thy heart may be comforted"; and he, the simple man, drank and
became drunk. And again, when he had drunk and his mind was clouded with
wine, the younger daughter came and lay with him, and again he did not
know of her lying with him, or of her rising up from him. And she also
conceived and gave birth to a son, and she called his name "<span
class="small">AMMON</span>", and he is the father of the <span
class="small">AMALEKITES</span>. <span id="page_137">p. 137</span>
Behold now, it is clear that the King of <span
class="small">AMALEK</span> is of the seed of <span
class="small">SHEM</span>.
