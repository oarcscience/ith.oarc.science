### 104. *More concerning the Ark and the Talk of the Wicked*

   And as concerning the Ark: God saved <span class="small">NOAH</span>
in the Ark. And God held converse with <span
class="small">ABRAHAM</span> in the wood of <span
class="small">MANBAR</span>,<span id="page_196_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_196_note_3.md) that is to say the wood
that cannot be destroyed; and He saved <span class="small">ISAAC</span>
by means of the ram which was caught in the thicket<span
id="page_196_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_196_note_4.md); and He made <span
class="small">JACOB</span> rich by means of three rods of woods which he
laid in running water<span id="page_196_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_196_note_5.md); and through the top of
his staff <span class="small">JACOB</span> was blessed.<span
id="page_196_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_196_note_6.md) And He said unto <span
class="small">MOSES</span>, "Make a tabernacle of wood which cannot be
destroyed, in the similitude of <span class="small">ZION</span>, the
Tabernacle of the Covenant." And when <span class="small">DAVID</span>
took it from the city of <span class="small">SAMARIA</span>, he placed
the Tabernacle of the Law in a new Tabernacle, and rejoiced before
it.<span id="page_196_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_196_note_7.md) For from the beginning
God had made the Tabernacle the means of salvation, <span
id="page_197">p. 197</span> and very many signs and wonders were
performed through it by its form and similitude. Hearken ye now unto me,
and I will show you plainly how God had ordained salvation through the
wood of His Cross, in the Tabernacle of His Law, from the beginning to
the end.

   Salvation came unto <span class="small">ADAM</span> through the wood.
For <span class="small">ADAM'S</span> first transgression came through
the wood, and from the beginning God ordained salvation for him through
the wood. For God Himself is the Creator and Giver of life and death,
and everything is performed by His Word, and He created everything, and
He maketh righteous him that serveth Him in purity in His pure
Tabernacle of the Law. For it is called "mercy-seat", and it is also
called "place of refuge", and it is also called "altar", and it is also
called "place of forgiveness of sins", and it is called "salvation", and
it is called "gate of life", and it is called "glorification", and it is
called "city of refuge", and it is called "ship", and it is called
"haven of salvation", and it is called "house of prayer", and it is
called "place of forgiveness of sins for him that prayeth in purity in
it", so that \[men\] may pray therein in purity and not defile their
bodies. God loveth the pure, for He is the habitation for the pure.
Those who come into His habitation, and are accepted in the holy
Tabernacle, and who pray unto Him with all their hearts, He will hear
and will save in the day of their tribulation, and He will fulfil their
desire. For He hath made the holy Tabernacle to be a similitude of His
throne. But there are some among those whom ye have brought unto us who
are like unto us Christians, but who have not abandoned the sin which
their father the Devil hath made to spring up in them. And he said,
"Thus it is right that we should pray in <span
class="small">ZION</span>, the Tabernacle of the Law of God; she was at
the first and is even now. The similitude thereof and the fruit thereof
are the Mother of the Redeemer, <span id="page_198">p. 198</span> <span
class="small">MARY</span>; it is right that we should worship her, for
in her name is blessed the Tabernacle of the Law of God. And it is right
that we should worship <span class="small">MICHAEL</span> and <span
class="small">GABRIEL</span>."

   And the Archbishop <span class="small">CYRIL</span> answered and said
unto them: And if he hath said this unto them, we also will say unto
them: What did our Lord <span class="small">JESUS CHRIST</span> say when
He was teaching those who believed in Him? One came from outside and
said unto Him, "Behold them, Thy father and Thy mother outside seeking
Thee." And <span class="small">CHRIST</span> the Lover of men answered
and, stretching out His hand towards those whom He was teaching, said,
without making any distinction or difference between man and woman,
"Behold them, My father, and My mother, and My brother. Whosoever hath
heard My word and hath done the Will of My Father, that same is My
father, and My mother, and My sister."<span
id="page_198_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_198_note_1.md) O thou blind-hearted
<span class="small">JEW</span>, canst thou not see His mercy and His
love for men when He spake thus? He neither separated nor made a
distinction, but He said unto them, "My brother." For He loveth those
who love Him and keep His commandment, especially the martyrs, who for
His sake delivered themselves over to death, though they knew the
bitterness of death; and the solitary monks who keep the commandment of
God, and love Him with all their hearts, and He loveth them. And their
graves which are built, that is to say, the martyriums, and the churches
which are built in their names, and the tabernacles which the Bishops
consecrate in their names; every one is holy in the house of the
Sanctuary of God. And the man who prayeth in their names God heareth.
And those who pray in purity, without uncleanness and blemish, and in
humility and sincerity in a tabernacle which hath been
consecrated—whether it be in the name of a martyr, or in the name of an
angel, or in the name\[s\] <span id="page_199">p. 199</span> of the
righteous, or in the name of a virgin, or in the name of holy women—if
it be consecrated, the Holy Spirit cometh down upon them and changeth
the wood so that it becometh a spiritual being. In this wise God
transformed the rod of <span class="small">MOSES</span> by His word, and
it became a thing of life and made <span class="small">MOSES</span> fear
his Lord. And in like manner <span class="small">JOSEPH</span>
worshipped the top of the rod of <span class="small">JACOB</span> when
he was before him; none forced him, but through the belief of his father
he worshipped the top of his rod. And this which <span
class="small">MOSES</span> wrote is a prophecy for the last days, so
that we may know that tabernacles in the name\[s\] of martyrs and
righteous men are holy, namely, when he saw him he worshipped the top of
his rod.

   And I will also declare unto you what is written concerning the pride
of <span class="small">PHARAOH</span>. <span class="small">MOSES</span>
did as God commanded him, and turned his rod into a serpent; and <span
class="small">PHARAOH</span> commanded the magicians, the sorcerers, to
do the same with their rods. And they made their rods into three
serpents which, by means of magic, wriggled before <span
class="small">MOSES</span> and <span class="small">AARON</span>, and
before <span class="small">PHARAOH</span> and the nobles of <span
class="small">EGYPT</span>. And the rod of <span
class="small">MOSES</span> swallowed up the rods of the magicians, for
these deceivers had worked magic for the sight of the eyes of men. Now
that which happeneth through the word of God overcometh every \[kind
of\] magic that can be wrought. And no one can find him to be evil, for
it is the Holy Spirit Who guideth and directeth him that believeth with
an upright heart without negligence. Even as <span
class="small">PAUL</span> saith, "By believing the fathers of olden time
were saved."<span id="page_199_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_199_note_1.md) He wished to make known
each by his name from <span class="small">ADAM</span>, and <span
class="small">NOAH</span>, and <span class="small">ABRAHAM</span>, to
<span class="small">RAHAB</span> the harlot who received the spies. And
thou, O blind <span class="small">JEW</span>, canst thou not understand
from what thou readest in the Law, that is to say, the <span
class="small">TÔRÂH</span> wherein thou believest, that inasmuch as thou
canst not perform <span id="page_200">p. 200</span> its commandments
thou art cursed thereby? For when He saith, "All those who walk therein,
if they do not keep what is written therein, accursed shall they be," He
saith it to thee. But us, who believe in <span
class="small">CHRIST</span>, the Son of God, the grace of God hath
chosen, saying, "He who believeth and is baptized shall be saved."<span
id="page_200_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
