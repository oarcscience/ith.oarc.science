### 66. *Concerning the prophecy of* <span class="small">CHRIST</span>

   Now, according to the interpretation of prophecy, the name <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> signifieth in the secret speech "<span
class="small">CHRIST</span>". And as <span class="small">SOLOMON</span>
built the house of God, so <span class="small">CHRIST</span> raised up
His Body and made it into the Church. And when He said unto the <span
class="small">JEWS</span>, "Throw down this house, and in three days I
will build it up \[again\],"<span id="page_105_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_105_note_2.md) He spake to them of the
house of His Body. And as <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> multiplied
wives from alien peoples because of their beauty and winsomeness, and
desires \[arose\] in him in his feigning love \[for them\], so <span
class="small">CHRIST</span> gathered together from alien peoples those
who had not the Law, but who believed on Him. And there was no
uncircumcised man to Him, and no pagan; and there was no slave, and no
<span class="small">JEW</span>, and no servant and no free man;<span
id="page_105_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_105_note_3.md) but He gathered them all
into His heavenly kingdom by His Flesh and Blood. And in the Song of
Songs <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> himself sang and said, "There
are sixty mighty men round about the bed of <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span>, all of them trained in war and holding
swords, each man with his sword upon his thigh."<span
id="page_105_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_105_note_4.md) The number sixty
indicateth the number of the righteous Patriarchs, and the Prophets, and
the Apostles, and the Martyrs, and the Believers, and the Saints, and
the Monks who have resisted the evil thought and the war of <span
class="small">SATAN</span>. And the word "sword" is, being interpreted,
the word of the Scriptures. The word of the Lord cutteth like a straight
sharp razor, and in like manner the Scriptures cut from men's hearts the
danger caused by lying dreams by <span id="page_106">p. 106</span>
night. And the words "bed of <span class="small">SOLOMON</span>" are,
being interpreted, the Church of <span class="small">CHRIST</span>.

   And again <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> sang, saying, "King
<span class="small">SOLOMON</span> hath made a litter for himself,"<span
id="page_106_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_106_note_1.md) and these words are to
be interpreted that <span class="small">CHRIST</span> hath put on our
body. The name <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> in the language of the
<span class="small">HEBREWS</span> is, being interpreted, "<span
class="small">CHRIST</span>". And the foolish <span
class="small">JEWS</span> imagine that the words of <span
class="small">DAVID</span>, "The Lord said unto me, 'Thou art my son and
I this day have begotten thee,'"<span
id="page_106_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_106_note_2.md) were spoken concerning
<span class="small">SOLOMON</span> his son. "O God, give Thy judgment to
the king, and Thy righteousness to the son of the king, so that he may
judge thy people with righteousness and thy needy ones with justice. And
he shall live and they shall give him of the gold of <span
class="small">ARABIA</span>, and shall pray for him continually, and
shall follow him \[with good words\], and he shall be a support for the
whole earth on the tops of the mountains, and his fruit shall be greater
than the cedar, and he shall flourish in the city like the grass of the
earth, and his name shall be blessed for ever, and his name shall be
before the sun. I have brought thee forth from the belly before the
Morning Star. God hath sworn, and He will not repent, thou art His
priest for ever, after the appointment of <span
class="small">MELCHIZEDEK</span>."<span
id="page_106_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_106_note_3.md)

   And concerning this prophecy and others like thereunto, which <span
class="small">DAVID</span> prophesied concerning <span
class="small">CHRIST</span>, the foolish <span
class="small">JEWS</span>, who are blind of heart, say that what <span
class="small">DAVID</span> said in the beginning of his book was spoken
concerning his son <span class="small">SOLOMON</span>; this do the <span
class="small">JEWS</span> say, and they make <span
class="small">CHRIST</span> to be <span class="small">SOLOMON</span>
because of the similarity of name, and the wisdom, and because He was
the Son of <span class="small">DAVID</span> in the flesh. And although
those who came after <span class="small">DAVID</span> and <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span>, namely <span class="small">ELIJAH</span>
and <span class="small">ELISHA</span>, knew this, they ascribed <span
class="small">SOLOMON'S</span> sin to him in the Book of <span
class="small">KINGS</span> in order that they might put to <span
id="page_107">p. 107</span> shame the <span class="small">JEWS</span>,
who are blinded in heart and the enemies of righteousness. And <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> the King, the son of <span
class="small">DAVID</span> the King and Prophet, was himself also King
and Prophet, and he prophesied many similitudes concerning <span
class="small">CHRIST</span> and concerning the Church, and he wrote four
books of prophecy, and is numbered with <span
class="small">ABRAHAM</span>, <span class="small">ISAAC</span>, and
<span class="small">JACOB</span>, and <span class="small">DAVID</span>
his father in the kingdom of the heavens.
