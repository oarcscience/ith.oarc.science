*The Kebra Nagast*, by E.A. Wallis Budge, \[1932\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

### 51. *How he said unto* <span class="small">ZADOK</span> *the Priest, "Go and bring the Covering* (*or, Clothing*) *which is upon it* (*i.e.,* <span class="small">ZION</span>)*"*

   And he said unto <span class="small">ZADOK</span> the priest, "Go,
bring that covering which is upon <span class="small">ZION</span>, and
take thee this covering which is better than that, and lay it over the
two \[coverings\] which are below it." (Now this covering was made of
threads of the finest gold wirework twisted together and hammered out
into a pattern, and they were not woven like the threads of purple.)
"And the five mice<span id="page_75_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_75_note_2.md) which were given to <span
class="small">ZION</span>, and the ten<span
id="page_75_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_75_note_3.md) figures of their shame
(i.e., the emerods) which the nobles of the <span
class="small">PHILISTINES</span> made for their redemption—now on the
fringes are figures of gold that came forth from the land of <span
class="small">ḲÂDÊS</span>, which <span class="small">MOSES</span> in
<span class="small">SINAI</span> commanded should be made (or, worked)
in the fringe of the apparel of <span class="small">AARON</span> his
brother—gather \[all these\] together in the covering of <span
class="small">ZION</span> and give \[them\] to my son <span
class="small">DAVID</span>. For his mother said in \[her\] message by
<span class="small">TÂMRÎN</span> her servant, 'Give us some of the
fringe of the covering of <span class="small">ZION</span>, so that we
may worship it, we and those who are in subjection unto us and all our
kingdom.' And now, give it to him, and say unto him, 'Take \[and\]
worship this covering of <span class="small">ZION</span>, for thy mother
sent a message concerning this, and hath said unto thee thyself, 'Give
us some of the fringe of its covering, which we can worship, so that we
may not, like the heathen, worship another \[god\].' And <span
class="small">ZION</span>, the Tabernacle of the Law of God, shall be
unto thee a guide wheresoever thou art. <span id="page_76">p. 76</span>
But it must remain with us perpetually, although we have not paid it all
the honour which is its due; and you, although it be not with you, must
honour it, and revere it according to what is due to it and what is
meet. For God said unto <span class="small">ELI</span> by the mouth of
<span class="small">SAMUEL</span> the Prophet, 'I wished you to remain,
thou and thy father's house, to offer up incense to the Tabernacle of My
Law, and to dwell before Me for ever, but now I have repented. I will
turn My face away from thee because thou hast treated My offerings with
contempt, and hast preferred thy sons to Me. And now, him that honoureth
Me I will honour, and him that esteemeth Me lightly I will esteem
lightly; and I will destroy all thy seed.'<span
id="page_76_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_76_note_1.md) This He said because the
<span class="small">LEVITES</span> had esteemed Him lightly. And say
unto him: Take this covering of <span class="small">ZION</span>, and
this votive gift shall be in the place of it, and place it in thy
sanctuary. And when thou takest an oath and makest another to take an
oath, swear thou and make him to swear by it, so that thou dost not make
mention of the names of other gods of the heathen. And when thou
sacrificest let thy face be towards us, and sacrifice to <span
class="small">JERUSALEM</span> and the holy <span
class="small">ZION</span>; and when thou prayest let thy face be towards
<span class="small">JERUSALEM</span>, and pray towards us."
