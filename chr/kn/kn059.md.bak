### 59. *How the King Questioned an Egyptian, the Servant of* <span class="small">PHARAOH</span>

   And <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> left that place, and he met a
noble of the nobles of <span class="small">EGYPT</span>, whom King <span
class="small">PHARAOH</span> had sent unto him with a gift; and there
was an abundance of treasures with him, and he came and made obeisance
to the King. And <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> the King made haste
to question him, even before he had presented his gift and embassy, and
said unto him, "Hast thou seen men of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> fleeing by this road?" And the ambassador
of <span class="small">PHARAOH</span> answered and said unto the King,
"O King, live for ever! My lord, King <span
class="small">PHARAOH</span>, sent me unto thee from <span
class="small">ALEXANDRIA</span>. And behold, I will inform thee how I
have come. Having set out from <span class="small">ALEXANDRIA</span> I
came to <span class="small">KÂHĔRÂ</span> (<span
class="small">CAIRO</span>), the city of the King, and on my arrival
these men of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> of whom thou speakest
arrived there also. They reached there after a passage of three days on
the <span class="small">TAKKAZÎ</span>, the river of <span
class="small">EGYPT</span>, and they were blowing flutes, and they
travelled on wagons like the host of the heavenly beings. And those who
saw them said concerning them, 'These, having once been creatures of
earth, have <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> become beings of heaven.'
Who then is wiser than <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> the King of
<span class="small">JUDAH</span>? But he never travelled in this wise in
a wagon of the winds. And those who were in the cities and towns were
witnesses that, when these men came into the land of <span
class="small">EGYPT</span>, our gods and the gods of the King fell down,
and were dashed in pieces, and the towers of the idols were likewise
broken into fragments. And they asked the priests of the gods, the
diviners of <span class="small">EGYPT</span>, the reason why our gods
had fallen down, and they said unto us, 'The Tabernacle of the God of
<span class="small">ISRAEL</span>, which came down from heaven, is with
them, and will abide in their country for ever.' And it was because of
this that, when they came into the land of <span
class="small">EGYPT</span>, our gods were broken into fragments. And
thou, O King, whose wisdom hath no counterpart under the heavens, why
hast thou given away the Tabernacle of the Law of the Lord thy God,
which thy fathers kept pure for thee? For, according to what we hear,
that Tabernacle used to deliver you out of the hand of your enemies, and
the spirit of prophecy, which was therein, used to hold converse with
you, and the God of heaven used to dwell in it in His Holy Spirit, and
ye are called men of the house of God. Why have ye given your glory to
another?" And <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> answered in wisdom and
said, "How was he (i.e., <span class="small">DAVID</span>) able to carry
away our Lady, for she is with us?"
