### 73. *Concerning the first judgment of* <span class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span>*, King of* <span class="small">RÔMÊ</span>

   And <span class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span> said unto them, "Hearken ye to
the judgment which I will declare unto you. If the sheep have destroyed
all the shoots from the root of the vine, then they all belong to thee.
And if they have eaten the leaves of the branches, and the blossoms of
the grapes, take the sheep, shear their wool, and \[take also\] the
young of those which have not yet brought forth. But the sheep which
have already brought forth young for the first time leave to the owner
of the sheep." And all those who heard the judgment which he pronounced
marvelled, and <span class="small">BALṬÂSÂR</span> said, "Verily, this
judgment is a judgment of the people of the God of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>. Henceforward judge him that hath a case at
law, wage war with him that would wage war, rule him that would be
ruled, keep alive him that should be kept alive, and pass the judgment
that ought to be passed according as men would be judged, and take this
city to thyself and to thy seed after thee." And all the men of the city
of <span class="small">RÔMÊ</span> were well pleased, and they made
<span class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span> king over them, and they rejoiced in
him with a great joy; for it happened thus by their will and by the Will
of God. And \[then\] a fever seized <span class="small">BALṬÂSÂR</span>,
<span id="page_126">p. 126</span> and thereupon he sent <span
class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span> to the war, and into everything that he
wished, whilst he himself remained in the city; and after this <span
class="small">BALṬÂSÂR</span> died, and <span
class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span> directed the kingdom. And the city of <span
class="small">RÔMÊ</span> became the possession of <span
class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span> and of his generations after him, for by
the Will of God the whole of the kingdom of the world was given to the
seed of <span class="small">SHEM</span>, and slavery to the seed of
<span class="small">HAM</span>, and the handicrafts to the seed of <span
class="small">JAPHET</span>.
