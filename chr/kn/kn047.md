*The Kebra Nagast*, by E.A. Wallis Budge, \[1932\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

### 47. *Concerning the offering of* <span class="small">AZÂRYÂS</span> (<span class="small">AZARIAH</span>) *and the King*

   And <span class="small">YÔ‛ÂS</span> (<span
class="small">BENAIAH</span>), the son of <span
class="small">YÔDÂḤÊ</span>, went and told King <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span>, and the King rejoiced over it and
commanded them to make ready the altar of offering so that his son might
sacrifice. And he brought and gave unto him that which he had vowed to
God, one hundred bulls, one hundred oxen, ten thousand sheep, ten
thousand goats, and ten of every kind of animal that may be eaten, and
ten of every kind of clean bird, so that he might offer libations and
sacrifices to the God of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>; and twenty
silver *sâḥal* of fine white flour, each weighing twelve shekels, and
forty baskets of bread. All these things did <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> the King give unto his son <span
class="small">DAVID</span>. And again <span class="small">DAVID</span>
sent a message saying, "Let <span class="small">AZÂRYÂS</span> the
priest offer up sacrifice on my behalf"; and <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> <span id="page_71">p. 71</span> said unto
him, "Do that which thou wishest." And <span
class="small">AZÂRYÂS</span> rejoiced because of this thing, and he went
and brought from his father's flock an ox whereon never yoke had been
laid, and four yearlings of the goats and four clean yearlings of the
sheep. And the king went to offer up sacrifice, and the priests made
themselves ready, and the poor folk were gathered together, and the
birds of the heavens rejoiced, and they were all united in their great
gladness that day. And <span class="small">AZÂRYÂS</span> mingled \[his
offerings\] with the offerings of the king, and he made an offering with
his vessels, even as the Angel of God had commanded him to do by night.
And then, after they had offered up their sacrifices, they went back to
their houses and slept.
