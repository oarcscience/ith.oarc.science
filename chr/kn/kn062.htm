<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">62. <I>Concerning the answer which </I><SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL><I> made to them</I></H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> the King answered and said unto them, "Hearken ye unto me and to what I shall say unto you. Supposing He had taken me away whilst I was carrying <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>&#8212;what is impossible to God? And supposing He had taken you away whilst ye were carrying her&#8212;what is impossible to God? And supposing He were to make them to inherit our city, and destroy us&#8212;what is impossible to God? For everything is His, and none can gainsay His Will, and there is none who can transgress His command in heaven above or on earth below. He is the King Whose kingdom shall never, never pass away, Amen. But now let us go and kneel in the House of God."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the elders of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> together with their King went into the House of God, and they entered the Holy of Holies, and they made supplication, and prostrated themselves, and ascribed blessing to God. And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> wept in the habitation of the heavenly <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, the Tabernacle of the Law of God, and they all wept with him, and after a little while they held their peace. And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> answered and said unto them, "Cease ye, so that the uncircumcised people may not boast themselves over us, and may not say unto us, 'Their glory is taken away, and God hath forsaken them.' Reveal ye not anything else to alien folk. Let us set up these boards, which are lying here nailed together, and let us cover them over with gold, and let us decorate them after

the manner of our Lady <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, and let us lay the Book of the Law inside it. <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> the free that is in the heavens above us, which <SMALL>JACOB</SMALL> our father saw, is with us, and below it is the Gate of Heaven, this <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL> on the earth. If we do the Will of God and His good pleasure, God will be with us, and will deliver us out of the hand of our enemy, and out of the hand of all those who hate us; God's Will, and not our will, be done, and God's good pleasure, and not our good pleasure, be done. Through this He hath made us sorrowful. Henceforward His wrath will cool in respect of us, and He will not abandon us to our enemies, and He will not remove His mercy far from us, and He will remember the covenant with our fathers <SMALL>ABRAHAM</SMALL>, and <SMALL>ISAAC</SMALL>, and <SMALL>JACOB</SMALL>. He will not make His word to be a lie, and will not break His covenant so that our fathers' seed shall be destroyed."</P>
