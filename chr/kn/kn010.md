### 10. *Concerning* <span class="small">ZION</span>

   "And I swear by Myself and by <span class="small">ZION</span>, the
Tabernacle of My covenant, which I have created for a mercy seat and for
the salvation of men, and in the latter days I will make it to come down
to thy seed, that I will have pleasure in the offerings of thy children
upon earth, and the Tabernacle of My covenant shall be with them for
ever. And when a cloud hath appeared \[in the sky\], so that they may
not fear and may not imagine that a Flood \[is coming\] I will make to
come down from My habitation of <span class="small">ZION</span> the Bow
of My Covenant, that is to say, the rainbow, which shall the Tabernacle
of My Law. And it shall come to pass that, when their sins multiply, and
I am wishful to be wroth with them, I will remember the Tabernacle of My
Covenant, and I will set the rainbow \[in the sky\], and I will put away
Mine anger and will send My compassion. And I will not forget My word,
and that which hath gone forth from My mouth I will not overlook. Though
heaven and earth pass away My word shall not pass away."<span

   And the Archbishops who were there answered and said to the blessed
<span class="small">GREGORY</span>, "Behold now, we understand clearly
that before every created thing, even the angels, and before the heavens
and the earth, and before the pillars of heaven, and the abysses of the
sea, He created the Tabernacle of the Covenant, and this which is in
heaven goeth about upon the earth."
