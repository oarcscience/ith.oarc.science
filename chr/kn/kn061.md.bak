### 61. *How* <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> *Returned to* <span class="small">JERUSALEM</span>

   And then <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> came back to the city of
<span class="small">JERUSALEM</span>, and he wept there with the elders
of <span class="small">JERUSALEM</span> a great weeping in the house of
God. And after this the King and <span class="small">ZADOK</span> the
priest embraced each other, and they wept bitterly in the habitation of
<span class="small">ZION</span>, and they remained silent for a long
time. And the elders rose up and spake unto the King, saying, "Be not
thou sorrowful concerning this thing, O our Lord, for we know, from
first to last, that without the Will of God <span
class="small">ZION</span> will not dwell \[in any place\], and that
nothing happeneth without the Will of God. And as concerning <span
class="small">ZION</span> in olden time, in the days of <span
class="small">ELI</span> the priest, before our <span id="page_96">p.
96</span> fathers had asked for a king, the <span
class="small">PHILISTINES</span> carried <span class="small">ZION</span>
away captive into \[their\] camp—God having neglected <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> in the battle, and its priests <span
class="small">’AFNÎ</span> (<span class="small">HOPHNI</span>) and <span
class="small">PÎNÂḤAS</span> (<span class="small">PHINEHAS</span>)
having fallen by the edge of the sword. And the <span
class="small">PHILISTINES</span> carried away the Tabernacle of the Law
of God, and brought it into their city, and set it in the house of their
god <span class="small">DAGON</span>. And <span
class="small">DAGON</span> was broken to pieces and destroyed, and
became like dust, and their land became a desert through mice, and they
ate up all the fruit of their land, and their persons became sores and
boils. And they gathered together their priests, and magicians, and
star-gazers, and they entreated them and said unto them, 'How can we
relieve ourselves of these sores and the tribulation which have come
upon us, and upon our country?' And those magicians meditated and
withdrew themselves to be alone, and they brought their magical
instruments, and pondered, and considered, and planned how they could
relieve them from tribulation of their city and their persons. And they
discovered that this punishment had come upon them and their city
because of <span class="small">ZION</span>. And they went to their kings
and their governors, and they said unto them, 'All these things have
befallen you through the heavenly <span class="small">ZION</span>, the
Tabernacle of the Law of God. And now, know ye how ye will take her back
into her city, and her country, and her house. And we must by no means
send her away empty, but must give her an offering, so that she may
forgive you your sins, and do away your tribulation when she hath
returned to her city. And if ye will not send her to her city, no good
will come of making her to live with you, but ye shall continue to be
punished until ye are destroyed.'

   "And their kings and governors said unto their priests, 'What gift
now say ye that we ought to give her, and how shall we send her back?
Find out, and tell us what we must do.' And the priests of the <span
class="small">PHILISTINES</span> took counsel together again, and they
said unto their kings and <span id="page_97">p. 97</span> governors,
'Make for her according to the heads of your houses, sixty figures of
mice in gold, since mice have destroyed your land, and sixty figures of
the member of a man, since your own persons have suffered from sores and
boils on your members.'<span id="page_97_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_97_note_1.md) And the <span
class="small">PHILISTINES</span> made as they commanded them one hundred
and twenty offerings of gold, and gave them to <span
class="small">ZION</span>. And again they said unto the priests, 'How
shall we send her away? And whom do ye say shall set her in her city?'
And again the magicians of the <span class="small">PHILISTINES</span>
said unto them, 'Let them bring two she-camels<span
id="page_97_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_97_note_2.md) that brought forth their
firstborn at the same time, and let them attach a wagon<span
id="page_97_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_97_note_3.md) to them—and they must
keep back their young ones and shut them up in the house—and they must
yoke the two she-camels together, and then set them free and let them go
where they will. And if they march straight for <span
class="small">JERUSALEM</span> we shall know that peradventure God hath
had compassion on our land; but if they wander about, and go hither and
thither, and wish to turn back to the place whence they started, then we
shall know that God is \[still\] wroth with us, and that He will not
remove His punishment until He hath blotted out ourselves and our city.'

   "And the <span class="small">PHILISTINES</span> did as the priests
commanded their governors, and they sent away <span
class="small">ZION</span>, and prostrated themselves before her. And
those camels made their way straight to the country of <span
class="small">JUDAH</span>, and they came to the threshing floor and the
house of thy kinsfolk received them. And those who did not receive them
were the men of the house of <span class="small">DÂN</span>, and they
did not do homage to <span class="small">ZION</span>, for they regarded
her in anger as their destroyed (?) God. And they cut up the pieces of
wood of the wagon, and they made those camels to be sacrifices, and
<span class="small">ZION</span> returned to her place. And whilst <span
class="small">ZION</span> was in \[her\] house <span
class="small">SAMUEL</span> the Prophet ministered <span id="page_98">p.
98</span> unto her, and vision and prophecy were revealed unto him, and
he pleased God in all his actions, and he ruled <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> for forty-eight years.

   "And after him our people entreated God to give them a king like the
nations that were round about them. And <span
class="small">SAMUEL</span> the Prophet anointed <span
class="small">SAUL</span> king, and he reigned forty years. And he was
of the tribe of <span class="small">BENJAMIN</span>, which was the
youngest branch of the peoples of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>. And
<span class="small">SAMUEL</span> the Prophet also anointed thy father
<span class="small">DAVID</span>. And when the <span
class="small">PHILISTINES</span> fought with <span
class="small">SAUL</span> the King, <span class="small">SAUL</span> was
conquered and died with \[<span class="small">YÔ</span>\]<span
class="small">NÂTHÂN</span> his son. And those of his sons who were left
wished to carry away <span class="small">ZION</span>, when they knew
that their father and their brother were dead. And then when they wished
to hide her and to transfer her to the Valley of <span
class="small">GÊLÂBÛḤÊ</span> (<span class="small">GILBOA</span>) in
order that thy father <span class="small">DAVID</span> might not carry
them off, she would not let them carry her away until thy father came
and carried her away from their city, but not with offerings, and not
with incense and burnt offerings. For it was impossible to carry <span
class="small">ZION</span> away unless she wished it and God wished it.
And again, when thy father reigned rightly over <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> he took her from the city of <span
class="small">SAMARIA</span> and brought her here to <span
class="small">JERUSALEM</span>, dancing on his feet before her, and
clapping his hands because of joy for her; for she was taken by him that
she might come to the city of <span class="small">DAVID</span> thy
father. And as for that which thou sayest concerning the going of <span
class="small">ZION</span> to their city, to the country of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, if God willed it and she herself willed
it, there is no one who could prevent her; for of her own will she went,
and of her own will she will return if God pleaseth. And if she doth not
return it will be God's good pleasure. And as for us, if God hath willed
it <span class="small">JERUSALEM</span> shall remain to us wherein thou
hast built for us a house of God. And now, let not thine heart be sad,
but comfort thou thyself with what we have said unto thee. And the
wisdom, which the Lord God of <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> hath given thee, hath sprouted from thee.
For wisdom is a strange thing. As a lamp is not the sun, and as vinegar
and aloes are neither profitable nor useful additions to honey, even so
the words of fools are not beneficial to the wise man. And as smoke is
to the eye, and unripe fruit to the tooth, even so the words of fools
are not beneficial to the wise."
