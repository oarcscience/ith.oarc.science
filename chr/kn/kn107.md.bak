### 107. *Concerning His entrance into* <span class="small">JERUSALEM</span> *in Glory*

   And the Prophets have prophesied concerning His glorious entry into
<span class="small">JERUSALEM</span>, and <span
class="small">ISAIAH</span> the Prophet said, "Shine thou, shine thou,
<span class="small">JERUSALEM</span>, thy light hath come and the glory
of God hath risen upon thee."<span id="page_209_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_209_note_1.md)

   Thus the Prophet <span class="small">ZECHARIAH</span> prophesied and
said, "Rejoice, rejoice, daughter of <span class="small">ZION</span>,
and let <span class="small">JERUSALEM</span> shout for joy."<span
id="page_209_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_209_note_2.md)

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> prophesied and said, "Out of
the mouth of children and babes Thou hast prepared praise because of the
enemy, so that Thou mightest overthrow the enemy and the avenger."<span
id="page_209_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_209_note_3.md)

   Thus <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> prophesied and said, "The
children are taught by God, and the peoples rejoice within thee."<span
id="page_209_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_209_note_4.md)

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> his father prophesied and said,
"Blow ye the horn in <span class="small">ZION</span>, on the day of the
new moon, on the appointed day of our festival, for it is an ordinance
for <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>."<span
id="page_209_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_209_note_5.md)

   Thus <span class="small">EZRA</span> the Scribe prophesied and said,
"Get ye out, make ye a festival in gladness, and say unto the daughter
of <span class="small">ZION</span>, Rejoice thou, behold thy King hath
come."<span id="page_209_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_209_note_6.md)

   Thus <span class="small">ISAIAH</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "Rejoice thou, <span class="small">JERUSALEM</span>, rejoice thou.
Behold, thy King hath come riding upon an ass. His reward is with Him,
and His work is before His face."<span
id="page_209_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_209_note_7.md)

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "Blessed is He who cometh in the name of the Lord."<span
id="page_209_fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">8</span></sup>](#page_209_note_8.md)

   Thus <span class="small">JACOB</span> the son of <span
class="small">ISAAC</span> prophesied and said, "<span
class="small">JUDAH</span>, thy brethren have praised thee. Thine hand
is upon the back of thine enemy, and the children of thy mother shall
worship thee. And the dominion <span id="page_210">p. 210</span> shall
not diminish from <span class="small">JUDAH</span>, and the government
shall not depart from his kin, until he shall find Him Who hath been
waited for, and Who is the Hope of the nations."<span
id="page_210_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_210_note_1.md) And he also prophesied
and said, "His teeth are white as with snow, and His eyes are glad as
with wine, and He shall wash His apparel in wine and His tunic in the
blood of clusters of grapes."<span id="page_210_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_210_note_2.md) And again he prophesied,
saying, "<span class="small">JUDAH</span> is a lion's whelp; thou hast
lain down, and thou hast slept; no one shall wake him up except him that
hunteth until he findeth him; rise up from thy strong place."<span
id="page_210_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_210_note_3.md) And again <span
class="small">JACOB</span> blessed his son <span
class="small">JUDAH</span>, and said unto him, "There is a King who
shall go forth from thee and shall wash His apparel in wine, and
glorious is the place of rest of the Beloved"; now, by "Beloved" <span
class="small">CHRIST</span> is meant, and by "Messiah" <span
class="small">CHRIST</span> is meant, and <span
class="small">JESUS</span> meaneth "Saviour of the people". Now the
Prophets mention <span class="small">CHRIST</span> under a secret name
and they call Him "the Beloved".

   And <span class="small">ISAIAH</span> spake concerning His Ascension
in his prophecy, saying, "On that day the Beloved shall come down from
heaven, and shall choose for Himself twelve Apostles."<span
id="page_210_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_210_note_4.md) And again he said, "I
have seen the ascension of the beloved Son to the seventh heaven, and
the Angels and the Archangels receiving Him, He being very much higher
than they."

   And <span class="small">DAVID</span> said, "The beloved is like the
son of the unicorn";<span id="page_210_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_210_note_5.md) and again he said, "And
thine only one from the horns of the unicorn."<span
id="page_210_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_210_note_6.md) And again he said, "Let
my horn be exalted like that of the unicorn."<span
id="page_210_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_210_note_7.md) "Horns" meaneth the
kingdoms of the world; and "unicorn" meaneth He Who is over His kingdom
Whom no one can resist, for He is the governor of <span id="page_211">p.
211</span> kings; He destroyeth whom He will and He setteth up him whom
He will. Even as <span class="small">DAVID</span> saith, "I will make
thee to rejoice more than those who are mighty through their
horns,"<span id="page_211_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_211_note_1.md) which meaneth, "Thou art
nobler than the noble kings, and thou dost rejoice."

   And <span class="small">HABAKKUK</span> prophesied, saying, "Horns
are in his hands,<span id="page_211_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_211_note_2.md) and he hath placed the
beloved in the strength of his power," which meaneth, "The palms of the
hand, wherein the life of all is held, of the holder of the dominion of
kings, are pierced with nails, which <span class="small">CHRIST</span>,
the beloved, hath endured in the strength of His might."
