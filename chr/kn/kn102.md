### 102. *Concerning the Beginning*

   As <span class="small">DAVID</span> prophesied by the mouth of the
Holy Spirit, saying, "With Thee was the headship on the day of
might."<span id="page_191_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_191_note_1.md) Now what do these words,
"day of might" mean? Is it not the day whereon <span
class="small">CHRIST</span>, the Word of the Father, created heaven and
earth? For <span class="small">MOSES</span> saith in the beginning of
the Book, "In the beginning God made the heavens and the earth."<span
id="page_191_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_191_note_2.md) Understand then "In the
beginning" meaneth "in <span class="small">CHRIST</span>"; the
interpretation of "beginning" is <span class="small">CHRIST</span>.
<span class="small">JOHN</span> the Apostle, the son of <span
class="small">ZEBEDEE</span>, saith concerning <span
class="small">CHRIST</span>, "This is the first (or, beginning) Whom we
have heard and seen, Whom we have known, and Whom our hands have
felt."<span id="page_191_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_191_note_3.md) And we will relate unto
you how we have a portion with Him, and ye who believe our words shall
have a portion with us. And <span class="small">LUKE</span> the disciple
saith in the Acts of the Apostles, "In the beginning we make speech
concerning everything,"<span id="page_191_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_191_note_4.md) and this that he saith
\[sheweth\] that <span class="small">CHRIST</span> was the redemption of
all, and we believe in Him. And <span class="small">MARK</span> the
Evangelist in the beginning of his Book wrote, saying, "The beginning of
the Gospel is <span class="small">JESUS CHRIST</span>, the Son of
God"<span id="page_191_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_191_note_5.md); and these words mean
that <span class="small">CHRIST</span> was the glad tidings for the
Prophets and the Apostles, and that we all have participated in His
grace. And again <span class="small">JOHN</span> the Evangelist wrote,
saying, "In the beginning was the Word, and that Word was with God"; and
in another place his word showeth \[this\] plainly, and he saith, "And
likewise in the beginning was God the Word."<span
id="page_191_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_191_note_6.md) And now observe that
that Word of the Father is <span class="small">CHRIST</span>, whereby He
made the heavens and the earth and every created thing. It is He Who
created, and without Him nothing that came came into being, <span
id="page_192">p. 192</span> nothing whatsoever: "He spake, and they came
into being; He commanded, and they were created."<span
id="page_192_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_192_note_1.md) And the third glorious
thing, hearken \[to it\]: "Through the breath of His mouth He created
all their host."<span id="page_192_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_192_note_2.md) This maketh manifest the
Holy Spirit, Who is clearly referred to.

   And what shall we say? Let us weep for them. Woe be unto the <span
class="small">JEWS</span> and unto the pagans (<span
class="small">’ARAMÎ</span>) who have wandered from the truth and have
refused to submit to the love of God, with which in His goodness He hath
loved man. For after <span class="small">ADAM</span> was rejected
through his sin He saved him by the greatness of His mercy, being
crucified on the wood of the Cross, His hands being pierced with nails.
With His palm stretched out in humility, and His head bowed on one side,
for our sakes He, to Whom suffering was unfitting, suffered in the
everlasting majesty of His Godhead. He died that He might destroy death;
He suffered exhaustion that He might give strength to the wearied being
of dust; athirst He drank vinegar, He was crowned with a crown of
thorns; He feared not and was not ashamed of the contumely and hatred
and spitting of the polluted <span class="small">JEWS</span>. He
suffered beating, He was buffeted with fists, He was pierced, He was
transfixed with nails, He was reviled and mocked, being God and the King
of Death, and the Bestower of glory, and because of this He endured
patiently all disgrace. Wearied and miserable, they made Him sad when
they rejected Him and hated Him; but strong and glorious, what could
sadden Him when they brought false charges against Him? For He Himself
knew His Godhead, and He knew His glory, and He knew Himself. And there
was none who knew Him, for He was the Creator of everything. And if they
had known Him they would not have crucified the Lord of praise (or,
glory). And He said in His mercy, "Forgive them, Father, for they <span
id="page_193">p. 193</span> know not what they do."<span
id="page_193_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_193_note_1.md) They likened their
Creator to something that had been created, and they slew a sojourner
who did not belong to mortal creatures, and He was not a thing that had
been made with the hand. But He Himself was the Maker, and He Himself
was the Creator, Light of Light, God of God, Son of the Father, <span
class="small">JESUS CHRIST</span>.

   He was the Refuge, He was the Feeder, He was the Director; He, Whose
domain was above what is on high, and above everything, abased Himself.
Even as <span class="small">ISAIAH</span>, the man of keen words among
the Prophets, saith, "He was a humble man, and His appearance was
rejected, like a root He hid Himself in parched ground, He came in the
flesh, a being of the earth, \[though He was\] the Sustainer of the
universe and the Saviour of the universe."<span
id="page_193_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_193_note_2.md) And <span
class="small">DAVID</span> ascribeth beauty to Him, saying, "On Thy
beauty<span id="page_193_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_193_note_3.md) and in Thy goodliness of
form." And again he saith, "His form is more goodly than that of the
children of men." And again he saith, "Graciousness is poured forth from
Thy lips." And again he saith, "Direct aright with prosperity, and reign
through righteousness, and justice, and sincerity."<span
id="page_193_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_193_note_4.md) And again he saith
concerning the <span class="small">JEWS</span>, the enemies of the
truth, "Thine arrows are sharp and strong in the hearts of the haters of
the King";<span id="page_193_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_193_note_5.md) "it is right that they
should transfix their hearts," He saith "unto those who did not wish Me
to be King, and they shall be brought before Me and pierced" \[with
spears\]. And again <span class="small">ISAIAH</span> saith concerning
the <span class="small">JEWS</span>, "I have sought for them and found
them not; I have called unto them and they have not answered Me; I have
loved them and they have hated Me."<span
id="page_193_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_193_note_6.md) And again <span
class="small">DAVID</span> saith, "They returned unto me evil for good,
and they hated me in return for my love for them."<span
id="page_193_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_193_note_7.md) And again <span
id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span class="small">ISAIAH</span> saith,
"With their lips they profess love for Me, but in their hearts they keep
afar from Me, and their worshipping of Me is an empty thing."<span
id="page_194_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_194_note_1.md) And as <span
class="small">MOSES</span> saith, "They have moved Me to wrath with
their gods, and I will move them to jealousy with that which is not a
nation, for they are a people whose counsel is destroyed."<span
id="page_194_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_194_note_2.md)

   And those who said, "We have no Law," unto them hath the Law been
given, for God is the Giver of the Law unto every one. And God rewarded
the <span class="small">JEWS</span> according to their wickedness, and
He treated the <span class="small">GENTILES</span> according to their
simplicity. For He is merciful and compassionate to those who call upon
Him and who take refuge in Him, and who purify themselves from all
uncleanness in the Church and in the Tabernacle of the Law of God; and
He loveth those who weep and repent even as <span
class="small">STEPHEN</span>, \[one\] of the Seventy Disciples
saith.<span id="page_194_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_194_note_3.md) Now among the Seventy
Disciples there were seven who were chosen for service with the Twelve
Apostles, to perform service with <span class="small">SÎLÂS</span>, and
<span class="small">BARNABAS</span>, and <span class="small">MARK</span>
and <span class="small">LUKE</span> and <span class="small">PAUL</span>.
And this <span class="small">STEPHEN</span> spake unto the <span
class="small">JEWS</span> whilst he was standing up to martyrdom and the
<span class="small">JEWS</span> were killing him, and said unto them as
he showed them their folly in not having kept the commandment of God,
"Ye have not kept the <span class="small">TÔRÂH</span> according to the
ordinance of the angels, as ye received it." And it saith in the Acts
\[of the Apostles\], "When they heard this they went mad with anger and
gnashed their teeth."<span id="page_194_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_194_note_4.md) Now hearken ye unto me.
In his saying "Ye have not kept the <span class="small">TÔRÂH</span>
according to the order of the angels," \[we have\] a form and a \[fore\]
shadowing of what is in the heavens, that is to say, the heavenly and
free <span class="small">JERUSALEM</span>, the habitation of the Most
High, whereof the situation and construction are incomprehensible to
mortal heart. And in it is the <span id="page_195">p. 195</span> throne
of the Most High, which is surrounded with fire, and four beasts bear it
in their place, which is the sixth heaven. And a throne goeth up to the
seventh heaven, the habitation of the Father, and there dwelleth He Who
is with His Father and the Holy Spirit, Who vivifieth everything. And
the Tabernacle of the Church is a similitude of the <span
class="small">JERUSALEM</span> which is in the heavens, and the Church
of the <span class="small">GENTILES</span> is a similitude of the <span
class="small">JERUSALEM</span> which is in the heavens.
