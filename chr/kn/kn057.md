### 57. *Concerning the Fall of* <span class="small">ZADOK</span> *the Priest*

   And when <span class="small">ZADOK</span> saw this he fell forward on
his face flat upon the ground, and his spirit was poured out over him,
for he was terrified; and he became like a dead man. And when he tarried
in coming out <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> sent to him <span
class="small">ÎYÔAS</span> (<span class="small">BENAIAH</span>), the son
of <span class="small">YÔDÂḤÊ</span>, and he found <span
class="small">ZADOK</span> like one dead. And he lifted up the head of
<span class="small">ZADOK</span>, and felt his heart and his nose to
find out whether there was any sign of breath being in him; and he
fanned him, and lifted him up, and rubbed him and laid him out upon the
table. And he rose up and looked at the place where <span
class="small">ZION</span> had been set, and he found her not, and he
fell down upon the ground. And he cast dust upon his head, and \[then\]
rose up and went out and wailed at the doors of the house of God; and
the sound of his cries was heard as far as the King's house. And the
King rose up and commanded the crier to go round, and the soldiers to
blow the trumpets, so that the people might go forth and pursue the men
of the land of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, and if they overtook
them they were to seize his son and bring him back with <span
class="small">ZION</span>, and slay the \[other\] men with the sword.
For with his mouth he spake and said, "As the Lord God of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> liveth, they are men of death and not of
life; for verily they deserve death because they have robbed the house
of the sanctuary of God, and have desired to pollute the habitation of
His Name in a land wherein there is not the Law."
