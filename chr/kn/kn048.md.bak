### 48. *How they carried away* <span class="small">ZION</span>

   And behold, the Angel of the Lord appeared again to <span
class="small">AZÂRYÂS</span> and he stood up above him like a pillar of
fire, and he filled the house with his light. And he raised up <span
class="small">AZÂRYÂS</span> and said unto him, "Stand up, be strong,
and rouse up thy brother <span class="small">ÊLMĔYÂS</span>, and <span
class="small">’ABĔSÂ</span>, and <span class="small">MÂKARÎ</span>, and
take the pieces of wood and I will open for thee the doors of the
sanctuary. And take thou the Tabernacle of the Law of God, and thou
shalt carry it without trouble and discomfort. And I, inasmuch as I have
been commanded by God to be with it for ever, will be thy guide when
thou shalt carry it away."

   And <span class="small">AZÂRYÂS</span> rose up straightway, and woke
up the three men his brethren, and they took the pieces of wood, and
went into the house of God—now they found all the doors open, both those
that were outside and those that were inside—to the actual place where
<span class="small">AZÂRYÂS</span> found <span
class="small">ZION</span>, the Tabernacle of the Law of God; and it was
taken away by them forthwith, in the twinkling of an eye, the Angel of
the Lord being present and directing. And had it not been that <span
id="page_72">p. 72</span> God willed it <span class="small">ZION</span>
could not have been taken away forthwith. And the four of them carried
<span class="small">ZION</span> away, and they brought it into the house
of <span class="small">AZÂRYÂS</span>, and they went back into the house
of God, and they set the pieces of wood on the place where <span
class="small">ZION</span> had been, and they covered them over with the
covering of <span class="small">ZION</span>, and they shut the doors,
and went back to their houses. And they took lamps and set them in the
place where \[<span class="small">ZION</span>\] was hidden, and they
sacrificed the sheep thereto, and burned offerings of incense thereto,
and they spread purple cloths over it and set it in a secret place for
seven days and seven nights.
