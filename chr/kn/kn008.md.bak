### 8. *Concerning the Flood*

   And this thing was evil before God, and He destroyed them with the
water of the Flood, which was colder than ice. He opened the doors of
heaven, and the cataracts of the Flood poured down; and He opened the
fountains that were under the earth, and the fountains of the Flood
appeared on the earth. And the sinners were blotted out, for they reaped
the fruit of their punishment. And with them perished all beasts and
creeping things, for they were all created for the gratification of
<span class="small">ADAM</span>, and for his glory, some <span
id="page_6">p. 6</span> to provide him with food, and some for his
pleasure, and some for the names to the glorification of his Creator so
that he might know them, even as <span class="small">DAVID</span> saith,
"And Thou hast set everything under his feet";<span
id="page_6_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_6_note_1.md) for his sake they were
created, and for his sake they were destroyed, with the exception of
Eight Souls, and seven of every kind of clean beasts and creeping
things, and two of every kind of unclean beast and creeping thing.
