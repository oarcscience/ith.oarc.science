<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we ordain even as did they. We know well what the Apostles who were before us spake. We the Three Hundred and Eighteen have maintained and laid down the orthodox faith, our Lord <SMALL>JESUS CHRIST</SMALL> being with us. And He hath directed us what we should teach, and how we should fashion the faith.</P>

<P ALIGN="center"><BIG><B>[<I>The Narrative of </I><SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL><I> and the Queen of </I><SMALL>SHEBA</SMALL><I> continued</I>]</B></BIG></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> sent a message unto the Queen, saying, "Now that thou hast come here why wilt thou go away without seeing the administration of the kingdom, and how the meal[s] for the chosen ones of the kingdom are eaten after the manner of the righteous, and how the people are driven away after the manner of sinners? From [the sight of] it thou wouldst acquire wisdom. Follow me now and seat thyself in my splendour in the tent, and I will complete thy instruction, and thou shalt learn the administration of my kingdom; for thou hast loved wisdom, and she shall dwell with thee until thine end and for ever." Now a prophecy maketh itself apparent in [this] speech.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Queen sent a second message, saying, "From being a fool, I have become wise by following thy wisdom, and from being a thing rejected by the God of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, I have become a chosen woman because of this faith which is in my heart; and henceforth I will worship no other god except Him. And as concerning that which thou sayest, that thou wishest to increase in me wisdom and honour, I will come according to thy desire." And <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> rejoiced because of this [message], and he arrayed his chosen ones [in splendid apparel], and he added a double supply to his table, and he had all the arrangements concerning the management of his house carefully ordered, and the house of King <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> was made ready [for guests] daily. And he made it ready with very great pomp, in joy, and in peace, in wisdom, and in tenderness, with all humility and lowliness; and then he ordered the royal table according to the law of the kingdom.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Queen came and passed into a place set apart in splendour and glory, and she sat down immediately behind him where she could see and learn and know

everything. And she marvelled exceedingly at what she saw, and at what she heard, and she praised the God of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> in her heart; and she was struck with wonder at the splendour of the royal palace which she saw. For she could see, though no one could see her, even as <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> had arranged in wisdom for her. He had beautified the place where she was seated, and had spread over it purple hangings, and laid down carpets, and decorated it with <I>misk&acirc;t</I> (moschus), and marbles, and precious stones, and he burned aromatic powders, and sprinkled oil of myrrh and cassia round about, and scattered frankincense and costly incense in all directions. And when they brought her into this abode, the odour thereof was very pleasing to her, and even before she ate the dainty meats therein she was satisfied with the smell of them. And with wise intent <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> sent to her meats which would make her thirsty, and drinks that were mingled with vinegar, and fish and dishes made with pepper. And this he did and he gave them to the Queen to eat. And the royal meal had come to an end three times and seven times,<A NAME="page_33_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_33_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> and the administrators, and the counsellors, and the young men and the servants had departed, and the King rose up and he went to the Queen, and he said unto her&#8212;now they were alone together&#8212;"Take thou thine ease here for love's sake until daybreak." And she said unto him, "Swear to me by thy God, the God of <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, that thou wilt not take me by force. For if I, who according to the law of men am a maiden, be seduced, I should travel on my journey [back] in sorrow, and affliction, and tribulation."</P>
