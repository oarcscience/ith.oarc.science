### 72. *Concerning the King of* <span class="small">RÔMÊ</span> (<span class="small">CONSTANTINOPLE</span>)

   And we will begin to tell you what we have heard, and what we have
found written, and what we have seen concerning the King of <span
class="small">RÔMÊ</span>. The kingdom of <span
class="small">RÔMÊ</span> was the portion and dominion of <span
class="small">JAPHET</span>, the son of <span class="small">NOAH</span>.
And sitting down they made twelve great cities, and <span
class="small">DARIUS</span> built the greatest cities of their kingdoms:
<span class="small">’ANṬÔKYÂ</span> (<span
class="small">ANTIOCH</span>), <span class="small">DÎRESYÂ</span> (<span
class="small">TYRE</span> ?), and <span class="small">BÂRTONYÂ</span>
(<span class="small">PARTHIA</span> ?), and RÂMYÂ (<span
class="small">ROMA</span> ?), and those who reigned dwelt there; and
King <span class="small">CONSTANTINE</span> built <span
class="small">CONSTANTINOPLE</span> after his own name. Now the sign of
the Cross having appeared to him during the battle in the form of stars
cut in the heavens, he was delivered out of the hands of his enemy; and
from that time <span id="page_122">p. 122</span> onwards the Kings of
<span class="small">RÔMÊ</span> made their habitation there. And that
<span class="small">DARIUS</span> had many descendants; and from <span
class="small">DARIUS</span> to the days of <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> were eighteen generations. And of his seed
was born a man whose name was <span class="small">ZANBARÊS</span>, and
he made in wisdom a drawing of the astrolabe, and placed stars therein,
and \[he made also\] a balance (i.e., clock) for the sun. And be
\[fore\]saw what would come after, and that the kingdom would not remain
to the children of <span class="small">JAPHET</span>, but would depart
to the seed of <span class="small">DAVID</span>, of the tribe of <span
class="small">SHEM</span>. And when he thus saw, he sent a message to
<span class="small">DAVID</span> the King, saying, "Take my daughter for
thy son"; and <span class="small">DAVID</span> the King took her and
gave her to <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> his son, and <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> begat a son by her and called his name
"<span class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span>". And <span
class="small">ZANBARÊS</span> died before \[this\] and <span
class="small">BALṬASÔR</span>, who was of his kinsmen, became king. And
he lacked male offspring to reign after him upon his throne, and he was
jealous lest the children of his father should reign after him. And he
sent a written message to <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> the King,
saying, "Hail to the greatness of thy kingdom, and to thine honourable
wisdom! And now, give me thy son, whom I will make king over the city of
<span class="small">RÔMÊ</span>. For I have not been able to beget male
children, but only three daughters. And I will give him whichever of my
daughters he pleaseth, and I will give him my throne, and he shall be
king, he and his seed after him in the city of <span
class="small">RÔMÊ</span> for ever."

   And when King <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> had read this
letter, he meditated, saying, "If I keep back my son he will send to the
King of the East, who will give him his son, and that which I have
planned will be made void; therefore I will give him my son." And he
took counsel with his counsellors of the house of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>, and he said unto them, "We have already
given our son and our children to the country of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, and <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>
hath a kingdom there. And now, so that we may have a third kingdom,
<span id="page_123">p. 123</span> the country of <span
class="small">RÔMÊ</span>, I will send thither <span
class="small">’ADRÂMÎS</span> my youngest son. Hold ye not it against me
as an evil thing that formerly I took away your sons, for it is a
pleasing thing to God that the men of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> have learned His Name, and have become His
people. In like manner, the men of <span class="small">RÔMÊ</span>, if
we give them our children, will become the people of God, and unto us
moreover shall be given the name of 'People of God', being spoken of
thus and called thus: The people of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>
have taken the kingdom of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> and the
kingdom of <span class="small">RÔMÊ</span>. Give ye your youngest sons
as before \[ye gave the eldest\], and let those of middle age stay in
our city."

   And they rose up, and took counsel, and returned, and said unto him,
"We will speak this matter unto the King, and he shall do his will." And
he said unto them, "Make me hear what ye would say." And they said unto
him, "Thou hast already taken the eldest of our houses, and now take the
youngest of their children." And he was pleased with this counsel, and
he did for them as they wished. And he set forward <span
class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span> his son, who took some of the nobles of the
lower grades of the house of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>, and the
lot fell upon him in the name of his father <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span>; and they gave him a priest of the tribe of
the <span class="small">LEVITES</span> whose name was <span
class="small">’AKÎMÎḤÊL</span>, and they set <span
class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span> upon the king's mule, and cried out to him,
"Hail! \[Long\] live the royal father!" And all the people said, "It is
right and proper." And they anointed him with the oil of kingship, and
commanded him to keep all the laws of the kingdom, and they made him to
swear that he would worship no other god except the God of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>. And they blessed him as they had blessed
<span class="small">DAVID</span> his brother, and admonished <span
class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span> even as they had admonished <span
class="small">DAVID</span>, and they accompanied him on his way as far
as the sea coast.

   And <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> the King wrote and sent a
letter, saying, "Peace be to <span class="small">BALṬASÔR</span>, the
King of <span class="small">RÔMÊ</span>! <span id="page_124">p.
124</span> Take my son <span class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span>, and give him
thy daughter, and make him king in the city of <span
class="small">RÔMÊ</span>. Thou didst wish for a king of the seed of
<span class="small">DAVID</span> my father, and I have done thy will.
And I have sent unto thee his nobles, fourteen on his right hand and
fourteen on his left, who shall keep the Law with him and be subject
unto thee according to thy will."

   And they arrived there with the ambassadors of the King of <span
class="small">RÔMÊ</span>, together with much splendour and all the
equipment that was requisite for the country of <span
class="small">RÔMÊ</span>. And they came to the city of <span
class="small">RÔMÊ</span>, to <span class="small">BALṬÂSÂR</span> the
King, and they repeated all that <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> had
sent them to say, and delivered over to him his son. And <span
class="small">BALṬÂSÂR</span> rejoiced exceedingly, and gave him his
eldest daughter, whose name was <span class="small">’ADLÔNYÂ</span>; and
he made a great marriage feast according to the greatness of his
kingdom, and established him over all his city of <span
class="small">RÔMÊ</span>. And he blessed him, for he was noble in
stature, and his wisdom was marvellous, and he was exceedingly mighty in
his strength.

   And one day <span class="small">BALṬÂSÂR</span> wished to test his
knowledge in the trying of cases, a man, the possessor of a vineyard,
having come to him and appealed to him, saying, "My lord, <span
class="small">’ARSÂNÎ</span>, the son of <span
class="small">YÔDÂD</span>, hath transgressed thy word, and hath laid
waste my vineyard with his sheep. And behold, I have seized his sheep
and they are in my house; what decision wilt thou come to in respect of
me?" And the owner of the sheep came to the King and made an appeal to
him, saying, "Give me back my sheep, for he hath carried them off
because they went into his vineyard." And the King said unto them, "Go
ye and argue your case before your King <span
class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span>, and whatsoever he shall say unto you that
do." And they went and argued their case before him. And <span
class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span> asked him, saying, "How much of the
vineyard have the sheep eaten? The leaves, or the tendrils, or the young
grapes, or the shoots by the roots?" <span id="page_125">p. 125</span>
And the owner of the vineyard answered and said unto him, "They have
eaten the tendrils and the branches that had grapes upon them, and there
is nothing left of the vines except the twigs by the root." And <span
class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span> asked the owner of the sheep, saying, "Is
this true?" And the owner of the sheep answered and said unto him, "My
lord, they ate \[only\] the tendrils with leaves on them." And <span
class="small">’ADRÂMÎ</span> answered and said, "This man saith that
they ate the grapes: is this true?" And the owner of the sheep answered
and said, "No, my lord, but they ate the blossoms before they had formed
into grapes."
