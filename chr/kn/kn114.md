### 114. *Concerning the return of* <span class="small">ZION</span>

   And the Tabernacle of the Law of God, the Holy <span
class="small">ZION</span>, shall remain here until that day when our
Lord shall dwell on Mount <span class="small">ZION</span>; and <span
class="small">ZION</span> shall come and shall appear unto all prepared,
with three seals—even as <span class="small">MOSES</span> gave her—as it
saith in the Old Law and in the New, "At the testimony of two or three
\[witnesses\] everything shall stand."<span
id="page_223_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_223_note_2.md) And then, saith <span
class="small">ISAIAH</span> the Prophet, "The dead shall be raised up,
and those who are in the graves shall live, for the dew which \[cometh\]
from Thee is their life."<span id="page_223_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_223_note_3.md) And when the dead are
raised up, His mercy whereby He watereth the earth shall cease; they
shall stand up before Him with the works which they have done. And <span
class="small">ENOCH</span> and <span class="small">ELIAS</span> shall
come, being alive, so that they may testify, and <span
class="small">MOSES</span> and <span class="small">AARON</span> from the
dead shall live with everyone. And they shall open the things that
fetter her (i.e., <span class="small">ZION</span>), and they shall make
to be seen the <span class="small">JEWS</span>, the <span
id="page_224">p. 224</span> crucifiers, and they shall punish them and
chide them because of all that they have done in perverting the Word of
God. And the <span class="small">JEWS</span> shall see what He wrote for
them with His hand—the Words of His Commandment, and the manna wherewith
He fed them without toil \[on their part\], and the measure thereof; the
<span class="small">GÔMÔR</span>, and the spiritual <span
class="small">ZION</span>, which came down for their salvation, and the
rod of <span class="small">AARON</span>, which blossomed after the
manner of <span class="small">MARY</span>.
