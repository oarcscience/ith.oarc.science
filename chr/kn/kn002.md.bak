### 2. *Concerning the Greatness of Kings*

   Come then, let us go back, and let us consider, and let us begin \[to
state\] which of the kings of the earth, from the first even unto the
last, in respect of the Law and the Ordinances and honour and greatness,
we should magnify or decry.

   <span class="small">GREGORY</span>, the worker of wonders and
miracles,<span id="page_2_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_2_note_3.md) who was cast into a cave
because of \[his\] love for the martyrdom of <span
class="small">CHRIST</span> and suffered tribulation for fifteen years,
said, "When I was in the pit I pondered over this matter, and over the
folly of the Kings of <span class="small">ARMENIA</span>, and I said, In
so far as I can conceive it, \[in\] what doth the greatness of kings
\[consist\]? Is it in the multitude of soldiers, or in the splendour of
worldly possessions, or in extent of rule over cities and towns? This
was my thought each time of my prayer, and my thought <span
id="page_3">p. 3</span> stirred me again and again to meditate upon the
greatness of kings. And now I will begin."

### Footnotes

<span id="page_2_note_3"></span>[3](#page_2_fr_3.md) The Gregory here
referred to is not Thaumaturgus, but the "Illuminator", i.e., Gregor
Lusavoritch, who flourished in the first quarter of the fourth century.
