*The Kebra Nagast*, by E.A. Wallis Budge, \[1932\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

### 31. *Concerning the sign which* <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> *gave the Queen*

   And the Queen rejoiced, and she went forth in order to depart, and
the King set her on her way with great pomp and ceremony. And <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> took her aside so that they might be alone
together, and he took off the ring that was upon his little finger, and
he gave it to the Queen, and said unto her, "Take \[this\] so that thou
mayest not forget me. And if it happen that I obtain seed from thee,
this ring shall be unto it a sign; and if it be a man child he shall
come to me; and the peace of God be with thee! Whilst I was sleeping
with thee I saw many visions in a dream, \[and it seemed\] as if a sun
had risen upon <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>, but it snatched itself
away and flew off and lighted up the country of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>; peradventure that country shall be
blessed through thee; God knoweth. And as for thee, observe what I have
told thee, so that thou mayest worship God with all thy heart and
perform His Will. For He punisheth those who are arrogant, and He
showeth compassion upon those who are humble, and He removeth the
thrones of the mighty, and He maketh to be honoured those who are needy.
For death and life are from Him, and riches and poverty are bestowed by
His Will. For everything is His, and none can oppose His command and His
judgment in the heavens, or in the earth, or in the sea, or in the
abysses. And may God be with thee! Go in peace." And they separated from
each other.
