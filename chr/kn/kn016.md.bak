### 16. *Concerning* <span class="small">RÔBÊL</span> (<span class="small">REUBEN</span>)

   And after him, <span class="small">JACOB'S</span> firstborn son
transgressed the commandment of God, and the kingdom departed from him
and from his seed, because he had defiled his father's wife;<span
id="page_12_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_12_note_1.md) now it is not right to
transgress the law which God hath commanded. And his father cursed him,
and God was wroth with him, and he became the least among his brethren,
and his children became leprous and scabby; and although he was the
firstborn son \[of <span class="small">JACOB</span>\] the kingdom was
rent from him.<span id="page_12_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_12_note_2.md) And his younger brother
reigned, and he was called <span class="small">JUDAH</span> because of
this.<span id="page_12_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_12_note_3.md) And his seed was blessed,
and his kingdom flourished, and his sons were blessed. And after him
<span class="small">FÂRÊS</span> (<span class="small">PHAREZ</span>) his
son reigned. And he died and <span class="small">’ISÂRÔM</span> (<span
class="small">HEZRON</span>) his son reigned. And after him his son
<span class="small">’ORNI</span> (<span class="small">OREN</span><span
id="page_12_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_12_note_4) ?.md) reigned, and after him
<span class="small">ARÂM</span> (<span class="small">ARAM</span><span
id="page_12_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_12_note_5).md) his son reigned, and
after him <span class="small">AMÎNÂDÂB</span> his son reigned, and after
him <span class="small">NÂSÔN</span> (<span
class="small">NAASSON</span>) his son reigned, and after him <span
class="small">SÂLÂ</span> (<span class="small">SALMON</span> ?) his son
reigned, and after him <span class="small">BÂ‛OS</span> (<span
class="small">BOAZ</span>) his son reigned, and after him <span
class="small">’IYÛBÊD</span> (<span class="small">OBED</span>) his son
reigned, and after him <span class="small">Ĕ’SÊY</span> (<span
class="small">JESSE</span>) his son reigned. And this is what I say
\[concerning\] the kingdom: The blessing of the father \[was\] on the
son, <span id="page_13">p. 13</span> so that it (i.e., the kingdom) was
blessed with prosperity. And as for the kingship over <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>, after the death of <span
class="small">JESSE</span> <span class="small">DAVID</span> reigned in
righteousness, and in integrity, and in graciousness.
