### 11. *The Unanimous Declaration of the Three Hundred and Eighteen Orthodox Fathers*

   And they answered and said unto him, "Yea, verily the Tabernacle of
the Covenant was the first thing to be created by Him, and there is no
lie in thy word; it is true, and correct, and righteous, and
unalterable. He created <span class="small">ZION</span> before
everything else to be the habitation of His glory, and the plan of His
Covenant was that which He said, 'I will put on the flesh of <span
class="small">ADAM</span>, which is of the dust, and I will appear unto
all those whom I have created with My hand and with My voice.' And if it
had been that the heavenly <span class="small">ZION</span> had not come
down, and if He had not put on the flesh of <span
class="small">ADAM</span>, then God the Word would not have appeared,
and our salvation would not have taken place. The testimony (or proof)
is in the similitude; the heavenly <span class="small">ZION</span> is to
be regarded as the similitude of the Mother of the Redeemer, <span
class="small">MARY</span>. For in the <span class="small">ZION</span>
which is builded there are deposited the Ten Words of the Law which were
written by His hands, and He Himself, the Creator, dwelt in the womb of
<span class="small">MARY</span>, and through Him everything came into
being."
