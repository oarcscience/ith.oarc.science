<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">117. <I>Concerning the King of </I><SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL><I> and the King of </I><SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL></H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the King of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL>, and the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, and the Archbishop of <SMALL>ALEXANDRIA</SMALL>&#8212;now the men of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL> were orthodox&#8212;were informed that they were to destroy them. And they were to rise up to fight, to make war upon the enemies of God, the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL>, and to destroy them, the King of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc; &#8217;&Ecirc;NY&Acirc;</SMALL>, and the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA PIN&#7716;AS</SMALL> (<SMALL>PHINEHAS</SMALL>); and they were to lay waste their lands, and to build churches there, and they were to cut to pieces <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> at the end of this Cycle in

twelve cycles of the moon. Then the kingdom of the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> shall be made an end of and the Kingdom of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> shall be constituted until the advent of the False Messiah. And those two kings, <SMALL>JUSTINUS</SMALL> the King of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL> and <SMALL>K&Acirc;L&Ecirc;B</SMALL> the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, met together in <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>. And their Archbishop was to make ready offerings and they were to make offerings, and they were to establish the Faith in love, and they were to give each other gifts and the salutation of peace, and they were to divide between them the earth from the half of <SMALL>JERUSALEM</SMALL>, even as we have already said at the beginning of this book. And for love's sake they were to have jointly the royal title [of King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>]. They were to be mingled with <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> their fathers. The one whom in faith they chose by lot to be named from the Kings of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL> was to be called "King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>", and the King of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL> likewise was to bear the name of "King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>", and he was to have part in the lot whereby he should be named with <SMALL>DAVID</SMALL> and <SMALL>SOLOMON</SMALL> their fathers, after the manner of the Four Evangelists. And the fourth the one whom they were to choose each in his own country. . .</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus after they had become united in a common bond, and had established the right faith they were to determine that the <SMALL>JEWS</SMALL> were no longer to live, and each of them was to leave his son there; and the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> was to leave there his firstborn son whose name was <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL>, and was to return to his own country in joy. And when he came to his royal house, he was to give abundant thanks unto God, and to offer up his body as an offering of praise to his God. And God shall accept him gladly, for he shall not defile his body after he hath returned, but he shall go into a monastery in purity of heart. And he shall make king his youngest son, whose name is <SMALL>GABRA MAS&#7730;AL</SMALL>, and he himself shall shut himself up [in a monastery]. And when one hath told this to the King of <SMALL>N&Acirc;GR&Acirc;N</SMALL>, the son of <SMALL>K&Acirc;L&Ecirc;B</SMALL>,



<A NAME="page_227"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 227</FONT></A>

he shall come in order to reign over <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, and <SMALL>GABRA MAS&#7730;AL</SMALL> shall make his armies to rise up, and he shall journey in a chariot, and they shall meet together at the narrow end of the Sea of <SMALL>L&Icirc;B&Acirc;</SMALL>, and shall fight together. And on the same night the two of them shall pray from sunset until the dawn, when the fight waxeth strong upon them. And when they have cried out to Him with tears God will look upon the prayer of both of them, and the penitent prayer of their father, and will say, "This one is the elder and he hath stood up to perform the will of his father, and that one, the younger, hath loved his father, and hath prayed to God [for him]." And God will say to <SMALL>GABRA MAS&#7730;AL</SMALL>, "Choose thou between the chariot and <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>," and He will cause him to take <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, and he shall reign openly upon the throne of his father. And God will make <SMALL>ISRAEL</SMALL> to choose the chariot, and he shall reign secretly and he shall not be visible, and He will send him to all those who have transgressed the commandment of God. And no one shall build houses, and they shall live in tents, and none shall suffer fatigue in labouring, and none shall suffer thirst on the journey. And their days shall be double of those of [ordinary] men, and they shall use bows and arrows, and shall shoot at and pierce him that God hateth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus hath God made for the King of <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL> more glory, and grace, and majesty than for all the other kings of the earth because of the greatness of <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>, the Tabernacle of the Law of God, the heavenly <SMALL>ZION</SMALL>. And may God make us to perform His spiritual good pleasure, and deliver us from His wrath, and make us to share His kingdom. Amen.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they answered and said unto him, "Verily, thou hast spoken well, for thus was it revealed unto thee by the help of the Holy Spirit. Thou hast told us everything which hath taken place, and thou art in agreement with the book of <SMALL>DAM&Ocirc;T&Icirc;Y&Ocirc;S</SMALL> (<SMALL>DOMITIUS</SMALL>) of <SMALL>R&Ocirc;M&Ecirc;</SMALL>. And



<A NAME="page_228"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 228</FONT></A>

thou hast prophesied also what shall happen to the two cities, the brides of <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL>, the Churches <SMALL>NEST&Acirc;SY&Acirc;</SMALL> and <SMALL>&#8217;AR&#7730;&Acirc;DY&Acirc;</SMALL>, and <SMALL>M&Acirc;R&Ecirc;N&Acirc;</SMALL>, and <SMALL>ETHIOPIA</SMALL>, the great cities of God, wherein pure sacrifices and offerings shall be offered up at all times.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May God show us His grace! The blessing of all the saints and martyrs [be with us] for ever and ever! Amen. <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> is our King, and in <SMALL>CHRIST</SMALL> is our life for ever and ever. Amen. And Amen."</P>
