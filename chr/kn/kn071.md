### 71. *Concerning* <span class="small">MARY</span>*, the daughter of* <span class="small">DAVID</span>

   And from this it is evident that <span class="small">MARY</span> was
the daughter of <span class="small">DAVID</span>, and that <span
class="small">JOSEPH</span> was the son of <span
class="small">DAVID</span>. Therefore was <span
class="small">MARY</span> betrothed to <span class="small">JOSEPH</span>
her kinsman, as it is said in the Gospel, "O <span
class="small">JOSEPH</span>, son of <span class="small">DAVID</span>,
fear thou not to take to wife <span class="small">MARY</span> thy
betrothed, for that which is to be born of her is of the Holy Spirit,
the Word of God."<span id="page_121_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_121_note_1.md) And there was born of
her God, the Word, Light of Light, God of God, Son of the Father, Who
came and delivered His creation; from the hand of <span
class="small">SHEÔL</span>, and from <span class="small">SATAN</span>,
and from death He hath delivered all of us who have believed in Him, He
hath drawn us to His Father and hath raised us up into heaven His throne
to become His heirs; for He is a lover of man, and unto Him praise
belongeth for ever. Amen.
