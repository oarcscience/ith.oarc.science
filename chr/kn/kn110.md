### 110. *Concerning His Resurrection*

   And the prophet <span class="small">DAVID</span> also prophesied,
concerning His Resurrection and said, "I will arise, saith the Lord,
<span id="page_216">p. 216</span> and I will make salvation and manifest
it openly."<span id="page_216_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_216_note_1.md) And again he saith,
"Rise up, O Lord, and judge the earth, for Thou shalt inherit among the
nations."<span id="page_216_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_216_note_2.md) And he also prophesied
and said, "Rise up, O Lord, help us, and deliver us for Thy Name's
sake."<span id="page_216_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_216_note_3.md) And again he said, "Let
God arise and let His enemies be scattered, and let His enemies flee
from before His face."<span id="page_216_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_216_note_4.md) And he also prophesied
and said, "God hath risen up like one who hath woke up from sleep, and
like a mighty man who hath left \[his\] wine."<span
id="page_216_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_216_note_5.md)

   Thus <span class="small">ISAIAH</span> the prophet prophesied and
said, "He will remove sickness from his soul, for he hath not committed
sin, and falsehood hath not been found in his mouth. And to him that
hath served righteousness and good will he show light and he will
justify him; and he shall do away the sins of many, for he hath not
committed sin, and falsehood is not found in his mouth."<span
id="page_216_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_216_note_6.md)

   Thus prophesied <span class="small">DAVID</span> the Prophet and
said, "For My soul shall not be left in hell."<span
id="page_216_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_216_note_7.md)

   Thus <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> his son prophesied and said,
"The Sun of righteousness shall arise, and shall travel towards the
right, and shall return into His place."<span
id="page_216_fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
