### 12. *Concerning* <span class="small">CANAAN</span><span id="page_8_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_8_note_1)

   Now, it was <span class="small">CANAAN</span> who rent the kingdom
from the children of <span class="small">SHEM</span>, and he
transgressed the oath which his father <span class="small">NOAH</span>
had made them to swear. And the sons of <span
class="small">CANAAN</span> were seven mighty men, and he took seven
mighty cities from the land of <span class="small">SHEM</span>, and set
his sons over them; and likewise he also made his own portion double.
And in later days God took vengeance upon the sons of <span
class="small">CANAAN</span>, and made the sons of <span
class="small">SHEM</span> to inherit their country. These are the
nations whom they inherited: the <span class="small">CANAANITES</span>,
the <span class="small">PERIZZITES</span>, the <span
class="small">HIVITES</span>, the <span class="small">HITTITES</span>,
the <span class="small">AMORITES</span>, the <span
class="small">JEBUSITES</span>, and <span id="page_9">p. 9</span> the
<span class="small">GIRGASITES</span>; these are they whom <span
class="small">CANAAN</span> seized by force from the seed of <span
class="small">SHEM</span>. For it was not right for him to invade
\[his\] kingdom, and to falsify the oath, and because of this they
ceased to be, and their memorial perished, through transgressing
\[God's\] command, and worshipping idols, and bowing down to those who
were not gods.

   And after the death of <span class="small">SHEM</span> <span
class="small">ARPHAXAD</span> reigned, and after the death of <span
class="small">ARPHAXAD</span> <span class="small">ḲÂYNÂN</span><span
id="page_9_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_9_note_1) (<span
class="small">CAINAN</span>) reigned, and after the death of <span
class="small">ḲÂYNÂN</span> <span class="small">SÂLÂ</span> (<span
class="small">SALAH</span>) reigned, and after him <span
class="small">EBER</span> reigned, and after him <span
class="small">PÂLÊḲ</span> (<span class="small">PELEG</span>) reigned,
and after him <span class="small">RÂGÂW</span> (<span
class="small">REU</span>) reigned, and after him <span
class="small">SÊRÔḤ</span> (<span class="small">SERUG</span>) reigned,
and after him <span class="small">NÂKHÔR</span> (<span
class="small">NAHOR</span>) reigned, and after him <span
class="small">TÂRÂ</span> (<span class="small">TERAH</span>) reigned.
And these are they who made magical images, and they went to the tombs
of their fathers and made an image (or, picture) of gold, and silver,
and brass, and a devil used to hold converse with them out of each of
the images of their fathers, and say unto them, "O my son So-and-so,
offer up unto me as a sacrifice the son whom thou lovest." And they
slaughtered their sons and their daughters to the devils, and they
poured out innocent blood to filthy devils.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_8">p. 8</span>

<span id="page_8_note_1"></span>[1](#page_8_fr_1) The son of Ham
(Genesis x. 6).

<span id="footnotes_page_9">p. 9</span>

<span id="page_9_note_1"></span>[1](#page_9_fr_1) There is some
confusion here; Cainan was the son of Enos (Gen. v. 9).
