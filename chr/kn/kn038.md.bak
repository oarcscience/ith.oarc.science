### 38. *How the King planned to send away his son with the children of the nobles*

   And then <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> the King went back into
his house, and he caused to be gathered together his councillors, and
his officers, and the elders of his kingdom, and he said unto them, "I
am not able to make this young man consent \[to dwell here\]. And now,
hearken ye unto me and to what I shall say unto you. Come, let us make
him king of the country of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, together
with your children; ye sit on my right hand and on my left hand, and in
like manner the eldest of your children shall sit on his right hand and
on his left hand. Come, O ye councillors and officers, let us give
\[him\] your firstborn children, and we shall have two kingdoms; I will
rule here with you, and our children shall reign there. And I put my
trust in God that a third time He will give me seed, and that a third
king will be to me. Now <span class="small">BALṬÂSÔR</span>, the King of
<span class="small">RÔM</span>, wisheth that I would give <span
id="page_52">p. 52</span> my son to his daughter, and to make him with
his daughter king over the whole country of <span
class="small">RÔM</span>. For besides her he hath no other child, and he
hath sworn that he will only make king a man who is of the seed of <span
class="small">DAVID</span> my father. And if we rule there we shall be
three kings. And <span class="small">REHOBOAM</span> shall reign here
over <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>. For thus saith the prophecy of
<span class="small">DAVID</span> my father: 'The seed of <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> shall become three heads of kingdoms upon
the earth.' And we will send unto them priests, and we will ordain laws
for them, and they shall worship and serve the God of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> under the three royal heads. And God shall
be praised by the race of His people <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>,
and be exalted in all the earth, even as my father wrote in his Book,
saying, 'Tell the nations that God is king';<span
id="page_52_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_52_note_1.md) and again he said,
'Announce to the peoples His work, praise Him and sing ye unto Him'; and
again he saith, 'Praise God with a new song. His praise is in the
congregation of the righteous, <span class="small">ISRAEL</span> shall
rejoice in his Creator.'<span id="page_52_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_52_note_2.md) Unto us belongeth the
glory of sovereignty and we will praise our Creator. And the nations who
serve idols shall look upon us, and they shall fear us, and make us
kings over them, and they shall praise God and fear Him. And now, come
ye, let us make this young man king, and let us send him away with your
children, ye who possess wealth and position. According to the position
and wealth that ye have here shall your children \[rule\] there. And
they shall see the ordering of royalty, and we will establish them
according to our law, and we will direct them and give them commands and
send them away to reign there."

   And the priests, and the officers, and the councillors answered and
said unto him, "Do thou send thy firstborn, and we will send our
children also according to thy wish. Who can resist the commandment of
God and the king? They are the servants of thee and of thy <span
id="page_53">p. 53</span> seed as thou hast proclaimed. If thou wishest,
thou canst sell them and their mothers to be slaves; it is not for us to
transgress thy command and the command of the Lord thy God." And then
they made ready to do for them (i.e., their children) what it was right
to do, and to send them into the country of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, so that they might reign there and dwell
there for ever, they and their seed from generation to generation.
