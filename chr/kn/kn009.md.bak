### 9. *Concerning the Covenant of* <span class="small">NOAH</span>

   And then <span class="small">NOAH</span> the righteous man died, and
<span class="small">SHEM</span> reigned in wisdom and righteousness, for
he was blessed by <span class="small">NOAH</span>, saying, "Be God to
thy brother." And to <span class="small">HAM</span> he said, "Be servant
to thy brother." And he said unto <span class="small">JAPHET</span>, "Be
thou servant to <span class="small">SHEM</span> my heir, and be thou
subject unto him."<span id="page_6_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_6_note_2.md) And again, after the
Flood, the Devil, our Enemy, did not cease from his hostility against
the children of <span class="small">NOAH</span>, but stirred up <span
class="small">CANAAN</span>, the son of <span class="small">HAM</span>,
and he became the violent tyrant (or usurper) who rent the kingdom from
the children of <span class="small">SHEM</span>. Now they had divided
the earth among them, and <span class="small">NOAH</span> had made them
swear by the Name of his God that they would not encroach on each
other's boundaries, and would not eat the beast that had died of itself
or had been rent \[by wild animals\], and that they would not cultivate
harlotry against the law, lest God should again become angry with them
and punish them with a Flood. And as for <span
class="small">NOAH</span>, he humbled himself, and offered up sacrifice,
and he cried out, and groaned, and wept. And God held converse with
<span class="small">NOAH</span>, who said \[unto Him\], "If Thou wilt
destroy the earth a second time with a Flood, blot Thou me out with
those who are to perish." And God said unto him, "I will make a covenant
with thee that thou shalt tell thy children they shall not eat <span
id="page_7">p. 7</span> the beast that hath died of itself or that hath
been torn by wild beasts, and they shall not cultivate harlotry against
the law; and I, on My part, \[covenant\] that I will not destroy the
earth a second time with a Flood, and that I will give unto thy children
Winter and Summer, Seedtime and Harvest, Autumn and Spring.<span
