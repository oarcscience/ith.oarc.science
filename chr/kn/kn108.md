### 108. *Concerning the wickedness of the iniquitous* <span class="small">JEWS</span>

   And the Prophets prophesied concerning the wickedness of the <span
class="small">JEWS</span>. And <span class="small">DAVID</span> said
concerning it, "The man of violence hunteth iniquity to destroy
himself."<span id="page_211_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_211_note_3) And again he saith, "His
sorrow shall return upon his head, and his iniquity upon his forehead"
(or, skull).<span id="page_211_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_211_note_4)

   Thus <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> his son prophesied and said,
"The foolish man and the man of iniquity travel by paths that are not
straight. He winketh with the eye, and tappeth with the foot, and he
giveth a sign by movements of the fingers and motion of the lips, and
his perverted heart meditateth evil at all times; a man who is like this
will make to come tumult and murder, and the shedding of blood through
double-dealing, and he shall not escape the judgement."<span
id="page_211_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_211_note_5)

   And <span class="small">DAVID</span> his father prophesied and said,
"They brought forth against me the word of error; he who sleepeth shall
he not awake? Shall then the man of my peace (i.e., my friend), whom I
trusted, who ate my food, lift up his foot against me?"<span
id="page_211_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_211_note_6)

   Thus <span class="small">ISAIAH</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "Woe <span id="page_212">p. 212</span> be unto the man of iniquity
who bringeth wrath."<span id="page_212_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_212_note_1) And again he said, "Let
them remove the sinner so that he may not see the glory of God."<span
id="page_212_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_212_note_2)

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "The sinner speaketh what will condemn him, and there is no fear
of God before his eyes."<span id="page_212_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_212_note_3)

   Thus <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> his son prophesied and said,
"The man of iniquity bringeth tumult to the city; and he willingly
maketh to come destruction, and beating, and calamity which cannot be
healed, for he rejoiceth in everything which God hateth."<span
id="page_212_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_212_note_4)

   Thus prophesied <span class="small">MOSES</span> the Prophet and
said, "God wisheth not to forgive him but rather to increase vengeance
upon him; and He will make punishments to rest upon him, and the curse
which is written in this book shall come upon him; and his name shall be
blotted out from under heaven."<span
id="page_212_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_212_note_5)

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "His heart is ready for slaughter; he preferreth cursing and it
shall come to him; he refuseth blessing and it shall be far from
him."<span id="page_212_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_212_note_6)

   Thus <span class="small">JEREMIAH</span> the Prophet prophesied
concerning him and said, "The man of iniquity shall be destroyed because
of the love of money, and he looketh upon darkness because of his
fraud."<span id="page_212_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_212_note_7)

   Thus <span class="small">JOB</span> prophesied and said concerning
him, "His Creator will destroy his fair work, and his root shall dry up
under him, and his flower shall be beaten down upon him, and his
memorial shall be blotted out from the earth, and his name shall be cast
far away, and men shall remove him into the darkness so that he may not
see the light, and the house of the man of iniquity shall be blotted
out."<span id="page_212_fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">8</span></sup>](#page_212_note_8)

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

   Thus <span class="small">HOSEA</span> prophesied and said concerning
him, "Hearken unto me, O children of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>,
for there is no righteousness, and no mercy, and no fear of God in his
heart, but falsehood, and theft, and murder, and fornication."<span
id="page_213_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_213_note_1)

   And <span class="small">DAVID</span> the Prophet prophesied and said,
"<span class="small">SATAN</span> standeth at his right hand"; and again
he said, "Let another take his office."<span
id="page_213_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_213_note_2)

   And <span class="small">MOSES</span> cursed in the Law and said,
"Cursed be every one who taketh bribes to slay innocent blood; and all
the people said, Amen. And Amen."<span
id="page_213_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_213_note_3)

   Thus <span class="small">HABAKKUK</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "The governor maketh \[men\] wise concerning this perversion of
the Law, and no right judgement cometh forth; for the sinner corrupteth
the righteous man, and therefore a perverted judgement cometh
forth."<span id="page_213_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_213_note_4)

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "The sinner seeth and becometh wrathful, and he gnasheth with his
teeth and is dissolved."<span id="page_213_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_213_note_5)

   Thus <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> his son prophesied and said,
"A false balance is a hateful thing to God."<span
id="page_213_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_213_note_6)

   Thus <span class="small">JEREMIAH</span> prophesied and said
concerning <span class="small">JUDAH</span>, "My hire is ready (or,
weighed) for me—thirty \[pieces of\] silver."<span
id="page_213_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_213_note_7)
