Textual Heritage

### 7. *Concerning* <span class="small">NOAH</span>

   Now <span class="small">NOAH</span> was a righteous man. He feared
God, and kept the righteousness and the Law which his fathers had
declared unto him—now <span class="small">NOAH</span> was the tenth
generation from <span class="small">ADAM</span>—and he kept in
remembrance and did what was good, and he preserved his body from
fornication, and he admonished his children, bidding them not to mingle
with the children of <span class="small">CAIN</span>, the arrogant
tyrant, the divider of the kingdom, \[who\] walked in the counsel of the
Devil, who maketh evil to flourish. And he taught them everything that
God hated—pride, boastfulness of speech, self-adulation, calumniation,
false accusation, and the swearing of false oaths. And besides these
things, in the wickedness of their uncleanness, which was unlawful and
against rule, man wrought pollution with man, and woman worked with
woman the abominable thing.
