### 87. *How the nobles* (*or governors*) *of* <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> *took the oath*

   And the Queen said unto her nobles: "Speak ye now, and swear ye by
the heavenly <span class="small">ZION</span> that ye will not make women
queens or set them upon the throne of the kingdom of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, and that no one except the male seed of
<span class="small">DAVID</span>, the son of <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span> the King, shall ever reign over <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, and that ye will never make women
queens." And all the nobles of the king's house swore, and the
governors, and the councillors, and the administrators.

   And she made <span class="small">ÊLMĔYÂS</span> and <span
class="small">’AZÂRYÂS</span> (<span class="small">AZARIAH</span>) the
chief of the priests and the chief of the deacons, and they made the
kingdom anew, and the sons of the mighty men of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> performed the Law, together with their King
<span class="small">DAVID</span>, in the Tabernacle of Witness, and the
kingdom was made anew. And the hearts of the people shone at the sight
of <span class="small">ZION</span>, the Tabernacle of the Law of God,
and the people of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> cast aside their
idols, and they worshipped their Creator, the God Who had made them. And
the men of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> forsook their works, and
loved the righteousness and justice that God loveth. They forsook their
former fornications, and chose purity in the camp that was in the sight
of the heavenly <span class="small">ZION</span>. They forsook divination
and magic, and chose repentance and tears for God's sake. They forsook
augury by means of birds and the use of omens, and they returned to
hearken unto God and to make sacrifice unto Him. They <span
id="page_148">p. 148</span> forsook the pleasures of the gods who were
devils, and chose the service and praise of God. The daughters of <span
class="small">JERUSALEM</span> suffered disgrace, and the daughters of
<span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> were held in honour; the daughter of
<span class="small">JUDAH</span> was sad, whilst the daughter of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> rejoiced; the mountains of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> rejoiced, and the mountains of <span
class="small">LEBANON</span> mourned. The people of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> were chosen \[from\] among idols and
graven images, and the people of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span> were
rejected. The daughters of <span class="small">ZION</span> were
rejected, and the daughters of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> were
honoured; the old men of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span> became
objects of contempt, and the old men of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> were honoured. For God accepted the
peoples who had been cast away and rejected <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>, for <span class="small">ZION</span> was
taken away from them and she came into the country of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>. For wheresoever God is pleased for her to
dwell, there is her habitation, and where He is not pleased that she
should dwell she dwelleth not; He is her founder, and Maker, and
Builder, the Good God in the temple of His holiness, the habitation of
His glory, with His Son and the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.

   And <span class="small">MÂKĔDÂ</span>, the Queen of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, gave the kingdom to her son <span
class="small">DAVID</span>, the son of <span
class="small">SOLOMON</span>, the King of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>, and she said unto him, "Take \[the
kingdom\]. I have given \[it\] unto thee. I have made King him whom God
hath made King, and I have chosen him whom God hath chosen as the keeper
of His Pavilion. I am well pleased with him whom God hath been Pleased
to make the envoy of the Tabernacle of His Covenant and His Law. I have
magnified him whom God hath magnified \[as\] the director of His widows,
and I have honoured him whom God hath honoured \[as\] the giver of food
to orphans."

   And the King rose up and girded up his apparel, and he bowed low
before his mother, and said unto her, "Thou art the Queen, O my Lady,
and I will serve thee in every thing which thou commandest me, <span
id="page_149">p. 149</span> whether it be to death or whether it be to
life. Wheresoever thou sendest me I will be sent, and wheresoever thou
orderest me to be there will I be, and whatsoever thou commandest me to
do that will I do. For thou are the head and I am the foot, and thou art
the Lady and I am thy slave; everything shall be performed according to
thy order, and none shall transgress thy commandment, and I will do
everything that thou wishest. But pray for me that the God of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span> may deliver me from His wrath. For He will
be wroth—according to what they tell us—if we do not make our hearts
right to do His Will, and if we do not readily observe all His commands
in respect to <span class="small">ZION</span>, the habitation of the
glory of God. For the Angel of His host is with us, who directed us and
brought us hither, and he shall neither depart from us nor forsake us.

   "And now, hearken unto me, O my Lady. If I and those who are after me
behave rightly and do His Will, God shall dwell with us, and shall
preserve us from all evil and from the hand of our enemy. But if we do
not keep our hearts right with Him He will be wroth with us, and will
turn away His face from us, and will punish us, and our enemies will
plunder us, and fear and trembling shall come to us from the place
whence we expect them not, and they will rise up against us, and will
overcome us in war, and will destroy us. On the other hand, if we do the
Will of God, and do what is right in respect of <span
class="small">ZION</span>, we shall become chosen men, and no one shall
have the power to treat us evilly in the mountain of His holiness whilst
His habitation is with us.

   "And behold, we have brought with us the whole Law of the kingdom and
the commandment of God, which <span class="small">ZADOK</span> the high
priest declared unto us when he anointed me with the oil of sovereignty
in the house of the sanctuary of God, the horn of oil, which is the
unguent of priesthood and royalty, being in his hand. <span
id="page_150">p. 150</span> And he did unto us that which was written in
the Law, and we were anointed; <span class="small">AZARIAH</span> to the
priesthood and I to the kingdom, and <span
class="small">’ALMĔYÂS</span>, the mouth of God, keeper of the Law, that
is to say, keeper of <span class="small">ZION</span>, and the Ear of the
King in every path of righteousness. And they commanded me that I should
do nothing except under their advice, and they set us before the King
and before the elders of <span class="small">ISRAEL</span>, and all the
people heard whilst <span class="small">ZADOK</span> the priest was
giving us the commands. And the horns and the organs were blown, and the
sounds of their harps and musical instruments, and the noise of their
outcries which were made at that time were in the gates of <span
class="small">JERUSALEM</span>. But what shall I tell unto you, O ye who
were present there? It seemed to us that the earth quaked from her very
foundations, and that the heavens above our heads thundered, and the
heart trembled with the knees."
