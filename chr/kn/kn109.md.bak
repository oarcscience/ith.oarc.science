### 109. *Concerning His Crucifixion*

   And the Prophets also prophesied concerning the Crucifixion of <span
class="small">CHRIST</span>.

   Thus <span class="small">MOSES</span>, the servant of God, prophesied
and said, "Ye shall see your salvation crucified upon the wood, and
shall not believe."<span id="page_213_fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">8</span></sup>](#page_213_note_8.md)

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> prophesied and said, "Many dogs
have seized Me; and they drove nails through My hands and <span
id="page_214">p. 214</span> My feet; and they counted all My bones;
though they knew Me they despised Me; and they divided My garments among
themselves; and they cast lots for My apparel."<span
id="page_214_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_214_note_1.md)

   Thus <span class="small">ISAIAH</span> prophesied concerning the
Incarnation and Crucifixion of <span class="small">CHRIST</span>, and
said, "Who believeth our word, and to whom is the arm of the Lord
revealed? And we spake like a child before Him: and He is like a root in
parched ground, He hath no beauty and no form; and His form is more
rejected and abased than \[that of\] any man. He is a broken man and a
man of suffering; for He hath turned away His face, and they treat Him
with contempt and esteem Him as nothing."<span
id="page_214_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_214_note_2.md)

   Thus <span class="small">SOLOMON</span> prophesied and said, "Let us
kill the righteous man, for he is a burden unto us; he setteth himself
up against our works, he resisteth our intentions continually, and we
are an abomination unto him because of our sins."<span
id="page_214_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_214_note_3.md) And he continued,
saying, "My son, let not wicked men lead thee astray; if they say unto
thee, 'Come with us, be a partner with us, let us hide innocent blood
and take plunder from him; and let there be one purse common to us all':
withdraw thyself from their footsteps, for let it not be through thee
that the birds find the net."<span id="page_214_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_214_note_4.md)

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> prophesied and said, "They cast
gall into My meat, and they gave Me vinegar to drink to \[quench\] My
thirst."<span id="page_214_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_214_note_5.md)

   Thus prophesied <span class="small">ISAIAH</span> the Prophet and
said, "He hath taken our disease and carried our sickness, and by His
wound we are healed; and we saw Him suffering, and wounded in his pain;
and He opened not His mouth in His pain, and He came to be slaughtered;
like a lamb before his shearer He opened not His mouth in <span
id="page_215">p. 215</span> His suffering until they took away His life;
and they knew not His birth; through the sin of My people have I come
even unto death."<span id="page_215_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_215_note_1.md)

   Thus <span class="small">JEREMIAH</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "And they took the price of the honourable one thirty \[pieces
of\] silver, whom they had honoured among the children of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>. And God said unto me, Cast it into the
melting pot, and test it \[and see\] if it be pure; and they gave it for
the field of the potter; as God hath commanded me I will speak."<span
id="page_215_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_215_note_2.md)

   Thus <span class="small">ISAIAH</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "They counted Him with the sinners, and brought Him to
death."<span id="page_215_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_215_note_3.md)

   Thus <span class="small">DAVID</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "Those who hate Me wrongfully are many, and they have rewarded Me
with evil for good."<span id="page_215_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_215_note_4.md)

   Thus <span class="small">ZECHARIAH</span> the Prophet prophesied and
said, "And they shall look upon Him Whom they have crucified and
pierced."<span id="page_215_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_215_note_5.md)

   Now there are still very many passages which have been written and
many prophecies which might be mentioned concerning His coming, and His
Crucifixion, and His death, and His Resurrection, and His second coming
in glory. But we have only mentioned a few of the prophecies of the
prophets—we have mentioned one of each kind—so that ye may hear, and
believe, and understand, even as it is said in the Acts of the Apostles,
"By the Gospel Thou hast guided us, and by the Prophets Thou hast
comforted us; for the words of the Prophets make right the faith of
those who doubt."<span id="page_215_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
