### 4. *Concerning Envy*

   And when they had grown up together, <span class="small">SATAN</span>
had envy of him, and he cast this envy into the heart of <span
class="small">CAIN</span>, who was envious \[of <span
class="small">ABEL</span>\] first, because of the words of his father
<span class="small">ADAM</span>, who said, "He who hath the
good-tempered face shall be the heir of my kingdom"; and secondly,
because of his sister with the beautiful face, who was born with him and
who had been given unto <span class="small">ABEL</span>, even as God
commanded them to multiply and fill the earth—now the face of the sister
who had been born with <span class="small">ABEL</span> resembled that of
<span class="small">CAIN</span>, and their father had transferred them
(i.e., the two sisters) when giving them \[in marriage\];—and thirdly,
because when the two \[brothers\] offered up sacrifice, God accepted the
offering of <span class="small">ABEL</span> and rejected the offering of
<span class="small">CAIN</span>. And because of this envy <span
class="small">CAIN</span> killed <span class="small">ABEL</span>. Thus
fratricide was first created through <span class="small">SATAN'S</span>
envy of the children of <span class="small">ADAM</span>. And having
killed his brother, <span class="small">CAIN</span> fell into a state of
trembling and horrible fright, and he was repulsed by his father and his
Lord. And \[then\] <span class="small">SETH</span> was born, and <span
class="small">ADAM</span> <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> looked upon him
and said, "Now hath God shown compassion upon me, and He hath given unto
me the light of my face. In sorrowful remembrance I will console myself
(?) with him. The name of him that shall slay my heir shall be blotted
out, even to his ninth generation."
