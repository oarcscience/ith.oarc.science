### 6. *Concerning the Sin of* <span class="small">CAIN</span>

   And that accursed man <span class="small">CAIN</span>, the murderer
of his brother, multiplied evil, and his seed did likewise, and they
provoked God to wrath with their wickedness. They had not the fear of
God before their eyes, and they never kept in mind that He had created
them, and they never prayed to Him, and they never worshipped Him, and
they never called upon Him, and they never rendered service to Him in
fear; nay, they ate, and they drank, and they danced, and they played
upon stringed instruments, and sang lewd songs thereto, and they worked
uncleanness without law, without measure, and without rule. And the
wickedness of the children of <span class="small">CAIN</span>
multiplied, until at length in the greatness of their filthiness they
introduced the seed of <span id="page_5">p. 5</span> the ass into the
mare, and the mule came into being, which God had not commanded—even
like those who give their children who are believers unto those who deny
God, and their offspring become the seed of the filthy <span
class="small">GOMORRAITES</span>, one half of them being of good and one
half of them of evil seed. And as for those who do \[this\] wickedness,
their judgment is ready, and their error is lasting.
