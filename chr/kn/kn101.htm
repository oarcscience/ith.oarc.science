<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again God said unto <SMALL>MOSES</SMALL>: "Make for Me an open space before the courtyard of the Tabernacle; no man who is impure sexually and unclean shall come there, and no one who is not pure. For I am there, and not only there, but in every place like thereunto where My Name is invoked in purity. I was with <SMALL>DANIEL</SMALL> in the den [of lions], and I was with <SMALL>JONAH</SMALL> in the belly of the great fish, and I was with <SMALL>JOSEPH</SMALL> in the pit, and I was with <SMALL>JEREMIAH</SMALL> in the well [fed from] the lake. I stand under the deepest deep so that the mountains may not sink down under the waters; and I am under the waters so that they may not sink down upon the fire, and sulphur; I stand under the fire and sulphur so that they may not sink down upon the winds and the rust. I am under the winds and the rusty fog so that they may not sink down under the darkness. And I stand under the deepest darkness and under the abysses, and every created thing supporteth itself on Me, and everything which I have created cometh to Me as a place of refuge.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am above the earth, and I am at the ends of the world, and I am Master of everything. I am in the air, My place of abode, and I am above the chariot of the Cherubim, and I am praised everlastingly by all the angels and by holy men. And I am above the heights of heaven, and I fill everything. I am above the Seven Heavens. I see everything, and I test everything, and there is nothing that is hidden from Me. I am in every place, and there is no other god besides Me, neither in the heaven above nor in the earth beneath; there is none like unto Me, saith God; My hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand hath made strong the heavens; I and My Son and the Holy Spirit."</P>
