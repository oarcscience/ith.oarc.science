### 84. *Concerning the King of* <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> *and how he returned to his country*

   And the King of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> returned to his
country with great joy and gladness; and marching along with their
songs, and their pipes, and their wagons, like an army of heavenly
beings, the <span class="small">ETHIOPIANS</span> arrived from <span
id="page_145">p. 145</span> <span class="small">JERUSALEM</span> at the
city of <span class="small">WAḲÊRÔM</span> in a single day. And they
sent messengers in ships to announce \[their arrival\] to <span
class="small">MÂKĔDÂ</span>, the Queen of <span
class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, and to report to her how they had found
every good thing, and how her son had become king, and how they had
brought the heavenly <span class="small">ZION</span>. And she caused all
this glorious news to be spread abroad, and she made a herald to go
round about in all the country that was subject unto her, ordering the
people to meet her son and more particularly the heavenly <span
class="small">ZION</span>, the Tabernacle of the God of <span
class="small">ISRAEL</span>. And they blew horns before her, and all the
people of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span> rejoiced, from the least
to the greatest, men as well as women; and the soldiers rose up with her
to meet their King. And she came to the city of the Government, which is
the chief city of the kingdom of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>;
now in later times this \[city\] became the chief city of the Christians
of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>. And in it she caused to be
prepared perfumes innumerable from <span class="small">INDIA</span>, and
from <span class="small">BÂLTÊ</span> to <span
class="small">GÂLTÊT</span>, and from <span class="small">’ALSÂFU</span>
to <span class="small">’AZAZAT</span>, and had them brought together
there. And her son came by the <span class="small">’AZYÂBÂ</span> road
to <span class="small">WAḲÊRÔM</span>, and he came forth to <span
class="small">MASAS</span>, and ascended to <span
class="small">BÛR</span>, and arrived at the city of the Government, the
capital \[city\] of <span class="small">ETHIOPIA</span>, which the Queen
herself had built and called "<span class="small">DABRA MÂKĔDÂ</span>",
after her own name.
