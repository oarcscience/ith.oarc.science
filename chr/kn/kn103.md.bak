### 103. *Concerning the Horns of the Altar*

   Now, the Tabernacle symbolizeth the horns of the altar, where the
holy priests offer up sacrifice, whereon they place the *ṭarapîzâ*,
(i.e., table), the similitude of the grave wherein He (i.e., <span
class="small">CHRIST</span>) was buried in <span
class="small">GOLGOTHA</span>. And what is on the table, that is, the
offering, is a symbol of the firstling, that is to say, the Body of
<span class="small">EMMANUEL</span>, \[or\] "<span
class="small">’AKRÂṬÔS</span>", the "pure", the "unmixed", which our
Saviour took from <span class="small">MARY</span>, of the which He said
unto His holy Apostles, "Eat ye My Body<span
id="page_195_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_195_note_1.md); whosoever eateth not of
My Body hath no portion with Me, and no everlasting life. But he who
hath eaten My Body, even though he be dead, shall live for ever, \[for\]
he is associated with My Body and My Blood, and he hath become My heir,
and he shall say to My Father, 'Our Father which art in heaven,'" and
the Father shall answer him, saying "Thou art My Son," and the crown
(i.e., the covering), which is above the offering, is a similitude of
the stone with which the <span class="small">JEWS</span> sealed the
grave. And when the priest saith, "Send the Holy Spirit," the Holy
Spirit shall be sent, and the Body of our Lord shall be perfect (or,
complete). And when we have received we shall be participators in the
Body and Blood of our Lord and Redeemer <span class="small">JESUS
CHRIST</span>, the Son of the Living God, and the Holy Spirit,
henceforth and for ever. Speak <span id="page_196">p. 196</span> ye then
to one another so that the <span class="small">JEWS</span>, who are
blind in heart, and who are our enemies and the enemies of our Lord God,
may not boast themselves over us. And they say, "Your gods are many, and
ye worship wood" (i.e., the Cross), and they say, preaching openly the
word of <span class="small">ISAIAH</span> the Prophet, "Ye worship the
half of it, and with the other half ye cook the body and eat
\[it\]."<span id="page_196_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_196_note_1.md) Now <span
class="small">ISAIAH</span> speaketh thus in respect of those who
worship graven images and idols. And they say \[that we say\], "These
are our gods, and they have created us"; and that we talk to them and
worship them as the Lord our God. And these also are they whom the
devils lead into error in their wickedness, and <span
class="small">DAVID</span> saith, concerning them, "The gods of the
heathen are devils, but God hath created the heavens; truth and goodness
are before Him."<span id="page_196_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_196_note_2.md)
