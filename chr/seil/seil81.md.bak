## THE FOLLOWING NOTES HELP TO PERCEIVE AND UNDERSTAND SCRUPLES AND PERSUASIONS OF OUR ENEMY

**First Note**. The first: They commonly call a scruple what proceeds
from our own judgment and freedom: that is to say, when I freely decide
that that is sin which is not sin, as when it happens that after some
one has accidentally stepped on a cross of straw, he decides with his
own judgment that he has sinned.

This is properly an erroneous judgment and not a real scruple.

**Second Note**. The second: After I have stepped on that cross, or
after I have thought or said or done some other thing, there comes to me
a thought from without that I have sinned, and on the other hand it
appears to me that I have not sinned; still I feel disturbance in this;
that is to say, in as much as I doubt and in as much as I do not doubt.

That is a real scruple and temptation which the enemy sets.

**Third Note**. Third: The first scruple -- of the first note -- is much
to be abhorred, because it is all error; but the second -- of the second
note -- for some space of time is of no little profit to the soul which
is giving itself to spiritual exercises; <span
id="fr_38"></span>[39](seil83.htm#fn_38.md) rather in great manner it
purifies and cleanses such a soul, separating it much from all
appearance of sin: according to that saying of Gregory: "It belongs to
good minds to see a fault where there is no fault."

**Fourth Note**. The fourth: The enemy looks much if a soul is gross or
delicate, and if it is delicate, he tries to make it more delicate in
the extreme, to disturb and embarrass it more. For instance, if he sees
that a soul does not consent to either mortal sin or venial or any
appearance of deliberate sin, then the enemy, when he cannot make it
fall into a thing that appears sin, aims at making it make out sin where
there is not sin, as in a word or very small thought.

If the soul is gross, the enemy tries to make it more gross; for
instance, if before it made no account of venial sins, he will try to
have it make little account of mortal sins, and if before it made some
account, he will try to have it now make much less or none.

**Fifth Note**. The fifth: The soul which desires to benefit itself in
the spiritual life, ought always to proceed the contrary way to what the
enemy proceeds; that is to say, if the enemy wants to make the soul
gross, let it aim at making itself delicate. Likewise, if the enemy
tries to draw it out to extreme fineness, let the soul try to establish
itself in the mean, in order to quiet itself in everything.

**Sixth Note**. The sixth: When such good soul wants to speak or do
something within the Church, within the understanding of our Superiors,
and which should be for the glory of God our Lord, and there comes to
him a thought or temptation from without that he should neither say nor
do that thing -- bringing to him apparent reasons of vainglory or of
another thing, etc., -- then he ought to raise his understanding to his
Creator and Lord, and if he sees that it is His due service, or at the
least not contrary to it, he ought to act diametrically against such
temptation, according to St. Bernard, answering the same: "Neither for
thee did I begin, nor for thee will I stop."
