------------------------------------------------------------------------

### OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST OUR LORD OF HIS FIRST APPARITION

**First Point.** First: He appeared to the Virgin Mary. This, although
it is not said in Scripture, is included in saying that He appeared to
so many others, because Scripture supposes that we have
understanding, <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](seil83.htm#fn_30.md) as it is
written: "\`Are you also without understanding?"\`

### OF THE SECOND APPARITION

Mark, Chapter 16 \[9\].

**First Point.** First: Mary Magdalen, Mary, the mother of James, and
Salome come very <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](seil83.htm#fn_31.md) early to
the Sepulchre saying: "\`Who shall lift for us the stone from the door
of the Sepulchre?'"

**Second Point.** Second: They see the stone lifted, and the Angel, who
says: "\`You seek Jesus of Nazareth. He is already risen, He is not
here.'"

**Third Point.** Third: He appeared to Mary, who remained about the
Sepulchre after the others had gone.

### OF THE THIRD APPARITION

St. Matthew, last Chapter.

**First Point.** First: These Maries go from the Sepulchre with fear and
joy, wanting to announce to the Disciples the Resurrection of the Lord.

**Second Point.** Second: Christ our Lord appeared to them on the way,
saying to them: "Hail:" and they approached and threw themselves at His
feet and adored Him.

**Third Point.** Third: Jesus says to them: "\`Fear not! Go and tell My
brethren that they go into Galilee, for there they shall see Me.'"

### OF THE FOURTH APPARITION

Last Chapter of Luke \[12, 34\].

**First Point.** First: Having heard from the women that Christ was
risen, St. Peter went quickly to the Sepulchre.

**Second Point.** Second: Entering into the Sepulchre, he saw only the
cloths with which the Body of Christ our Lord had been covered, and
nothing else.

**Third Point.** Third: As St. Peter was thinking of these things,
Christ appeared to Him, and therefore the Apostles said: "\`Truly the
Lord has risen and appeared to Simon.'"

### OF THE FIFTH APPARITION

In the last Chapter of St. Luke.

**First Point.** First: He appeared to the Disciples who were going to
Emmaus, talking of Christ.

**Second Point.** Second: He reproves them, showing by the Scriptures
that Christ had to die and rise again: "\`O foolish and slow of heart to
believe all that the Prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that
Christ should suffer and so enter into His glory?"\`

**Third Point.** Third: At their prayer, He lingers there, and was with
them until, in giving them Communion, He disappeared. And they,
returning, told the Disciples how they had known Him in the Communion.

### OF THE SIXTH APPARITION

John, Chapter 20 \[19-24\].

**First Point.** First: The Disciples, except St. Thomas, were gathered
together for fear of the Jews.

**Second Point.** Second: Jesus appeared to them, the doors being shut,
and being in the midst of them, He says: "\`Peace be with you!'"

**Third Point.** Third: He gives them the Holy Ghost, saying to them:
"\`Receive ye the Holy Ghost: to those whose sins you shall forgive, to
them they shall be forgiven.'"

### THE SEVENTH APPARITION

John 20 \[24-30\].

**First Point.** First: St. Thomas, incredulous because he was absent
from the preceding apparition, says: "If I do not see Him, I will not
believe."

**Second Point.** Second: Jesus appears to them eight days from that,
the doors being shut, and says to St. Thomas: "\`Put here thy finger and
see the truth; and be not incredulous, but believing.'"

**Third Point.** Third: St. Thomas believed, saying: "\`My Lord and my
God!" Christ said to him: "\`Blessed are those who have not seen and
have believed.'"

### OF THE EIGHTH APPARITION

John, last Chapter \[1-24\].

**First Point.** First: Jesus appears to seven of His Disciples <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](seil83.htm#fn_32.md) who were fishing, and had taken
nothing all night; and spreading the net by His command, "They were not
able to draw it out for the multitude of the fishes."

**Second Point.** Second: By this miracle St. John knew Him and said to
St. Peter: "\`It is the Lord!'" He cast himself into the sea and came to
Christ.

**Third Point.** Third: He gave them to eat part of a fish roasted, and
a comb of honey, <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](seil83.htm#fn_33.md) and
recommended the sheep to St. Peter, having first examined him three
times on charity, and says to him: "\`Feed My sheep! \`"

is given to Me in heaven and on earth.'"

saying: "\`Go and teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of
the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.'"

He was seen by more than five hundred brethren together."

### OF THE ELEVENTH APPARITION

In the First Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 15 \[7\]. "Afterwards
He appeared to St. James."

### OF THE TWELFTH APPARITION

He appeared to Joseph of Arimathea, as is piously meditated and is read
in the lives of the Saints. <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](seil83.htm#fn_34.md)

### OF THE THIRTEENTH APPARITION

First Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 15 \[8\]. He appeared to St.
Paul after the Ascension. "\`Last of all, He appeared to me, as one born
out of due time.'"

them out and having taken His Body again, He appeared to the Disciples
many times, and dealt with them.
