### OF THE MYSTERIES DONE FROM THE HOUSE OF CAIPHAS TO THAT OF PILATE, INCLUSIVE

Matthew 26, Luke 23, Mark 15.

**First Point.** First: The whole multitude of the Jews <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](seil83.htm#fn_27.md) take Him to Pilate and accuse
Him before him, saying: "\`We have found that this man tried to ruin our
people and forbade to pay tribute to Caesar.'"

**Second Point.** Second: Pilate, after having examined Him once and
again, said: "\`I find no fault.'"

**Third Point.** Third: The robber Barabbas was preferred to Him. "They
all cried, saying: \`Give us not this man, but Barabbas!'"
