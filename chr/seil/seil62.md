### OF THE RESURRECTION OF LAZARUS

John, Chapter 11 \[1-46\].

**First Point.** First: Martha and Mary sent word to Christ our Lord of
the illness of Lazarus. Knowing it, He delayed for two days, that the
miracle might be more evident.

**Second Point.** Second: Before He raises him, He asks the one and the
other to believe, saying: "\`I am the resurrection and life; he who
believeth in Me, although he be dead, shall live.'"

**Third Point.** Third: He raises him, after having wept and prayed. And
the manner of raising him was by commanding: "\`Lazarus, come forth!'"
