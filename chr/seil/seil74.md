### OF THE MYSTERIES ON THE CROSS

John 19 \[25-37\].

**First Point.** First: He spoke seven words on the Cross: He prayed for
those who were crucifying Him; He pardoned the thief; He recommended St.
John to His Mother and His Mother to St. John; He said with a loud
voice: "\`I thirst,'" and they gave Him gall and vinegar; He said that
He was abandoned; He said: "It is consummated"; He said: "Father, into
Thy hands I commend My spirit!"

**Second Point.** Second: The sun was darkened, the stones broken, the
graves opened, the veil of the Temple was rent in two from above
below. <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](seil83.htm#fn_29.md)

**Third Point.** Third: They blaspheme Him, saying: "\`Thou wert He who
destroyest the Temple of God; come down from the Cross."\` His garments
were divided; His side, struck with the lance, sent forth water and
blood.
