## THE MYSTERIES OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST OUR LORD

**Note**. It is to be noted in all the following Mysteries, that all the
words which are inclosed in parentheses <span
id="fr_22"></span>[23](seil83.htm#fn_22.md) are from the Gospel itself and
not those which are outside.

And in each Mystery, for the most part, three Points will be found to
meditate and contemplate on with greater ease.

### OF THE ANNUNCIATION OF OUR LADY

St. Luke writes in the first Chapter \[26-39\].

**First Point**. The first Point is that the Angel St. Gabriel, saluting
Our Lady, announced to her the Conception of Christ our Lord. "The Angel
entering where Mary was, saluted her saying: \`Hail full of grace. Thou
shalt conceive in thy womb and shalt bring forth a son.'"

**Second Point**. The second, the Angel confirms what he said to Our
Lady, telling of the conception of St. John Baptist, saying to her:
"\`And behold thy cousin Elizabeth hath conceived a son in her old
age.'"

**Third Point**. The third, Our Lady answered the Angel: "\`Behold the
handmaid of the Lord: be it done to me according to thy word!'"
