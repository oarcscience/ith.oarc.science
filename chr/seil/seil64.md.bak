### PALM SUNDAY

Matthew, Chapter 21 \[1-12\].

**First Point.** First: The Lord sends for the ass and the foal, saying:
"Loose them and bring them to Me, and if any one shall say anything to
you, say ye that the Lord hath need of them, and forthwith he will let
them go."

**Second Point.** Second: He mounted upon the ass, which was covered
with the garments of the Apostles.

**Third Point.** Third: They went out to receive Him, strewing in the
way their garments and the branches of the trees, saying: "\`Save us,
Son of David, blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord: Save us
in the heights!'"
