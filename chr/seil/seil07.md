## FIRST WEEK

### PRINCIPLE AND FOUNDATION

Man is created to praise, reverence, and serve God our Lord, and by this
means to save his soul.

And the other things on the face of the earth are created for man and
that they may help him in prosecuting the end for which he is created.

From this it follows that man is to use them as much as they help him on
to his end, and ought to rid himself of them so far as they hinder him
as to it.

For this it is necessary to make ourselves indifferent to all created
things in all that is allowed to the choice of our free will and is not
prohibited to it; so that, on our part, we want not health rather than
sickness, riches rather than poverty, honor rather than dishonor, long
rather than short life, and so in all the rest; desiring and choosing
only what is most conducive for us to the end for which we are created.
