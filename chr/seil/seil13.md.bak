### THIRD EXERCISE

##### IT IS A REPETITION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND EXERCISE, MAKING THREE COLLOQUIES

After the Preparatory Prayer and two Preludes, it will be to repeat the
First and Second Exercise, marking and dwelling on the Points in which I
have felt greater consolation or desolation, or greater spiritual
feeling.

After this I will make three Colloquies in the following manner:

**First Colloquy**. The first Colloquy to Our Lady, that she may get me
grace from Her Son and Lord for three things: first, that I may feel an
interior knowledge of my sins, and hatred of them; second, that I may
feel the disorder of my actions, so that, hating them, I may correct
myself and put myself in order; third, to ask knowledge of the world, in
order that, hating it, I may put away from me worldly and vain things.

And with that a HAIL MARY.

**Second Colloquy**. The second: The same to the Son, begging Him to get
it for me from the Father.

And with that the SOUL OF CHRIST.

**Third Colloquy**. The third: The same to the Father, that the Eternal
Lord Himself may grant it to me.

And with that an OUR FATHER.
