### OF THE CIRCUMCISION

St. Luke writes in the second Chapter \[21\].

**First Point**. First: They circumcised the Child Jesus.

**Second Point**. Second: "His Name was called Jesus, which was called
by the Angel, before He was conceived in the womb."

**Third Point**. Third: They gave back the Child to His Mother, who had
compassion for the Blood which came from her Son.
