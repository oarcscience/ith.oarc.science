### OF THE THREE MAGI KINGS

St. Matthew writes in the second Chapter \[1-13\].

**First Point**. First: The three Magi Kings, guiding themselves by the
star, came to adore Jesus, saying: "\`We have seen His star in the East
and are come to adore Him.'"

**Second Point**. Second: They adored Him and offered gifts to Him.
"Falling down on the earth, they adored Him, and they offered Him gifts,
gold, frankincense and myrrh."

**Third Point**. Third: "They received answer while sleeping that they
should not return to Herod, and went back by another way to their
country."
