### OF HOW CHRIST WAS BAPTIZED

St. Matthew writes in the third Chapter \[13-17\].

**First Point**. First: Christ our Lord, after having taken leave of His
Blessed Mother, came from Nazareth to the River Jordan, where St. John
Baptist was.

**Second Point**. Second: St. John baptized Christ our Lord, and wanting
to excuse himself, thinking himself unworthy of baptizing Him, Christ
said to him: "Do this for the present, for so it is necessary that we
fulfill all justice.'"

**Third Point.** Third: "The Holy Spirit came and the voice of the
Father from heaven affirming: \`This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am
well pleased.'"
