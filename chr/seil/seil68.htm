<p> <b>First Point.</b> First: The Lord lets Himself be kissed by Judas and taken as a robber, to whom He said: "`You have come out as to a robber to apprehend Me with clubs and arms; when I was daily with you in the Temple teaching and you did not take Me."` And He saying: "`Whom seek ye?"` the enemies fell on the earth.
<p> <b>Second Point.</b> Second: St. Peter wounded a servant of the High Priest, and the meek Lord said to Peter: "`Return thy sword into its place,'" and He healed the wound of the servant.
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: Left by His Disciples, He is taken to Annas, where St. Peter, who had followed Him from afar, denied Him once, and a blow was given Christ by one saying to Him: "`Answerest Thou the High Priest so?"`
