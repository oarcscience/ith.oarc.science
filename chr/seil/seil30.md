### TO AMEND AND REFORM ONE'S OWN LIFE

##### AND STATE

It is to be noted that as to those who are settled in ecclesiastical
office or in matrimony -- whether they abound much or not in temporal
goods -- when they have no opportunity or have not a very prompt will to
make election about the things which fall under an election that can be
changed, it is very helpful, in place of making election, to give them a
form and way to amend and reform each his own life and state. That is,
putting his creation, life and state for the glory and praise of God our
Lord and the salvation of his own soul, to come and arrive at this end,
he ought to consider much and ponder through the Exercises and Ways of
Election, as has been explained, how large a house and household he
ought to keep, how he ought to rule and govern it, how he ought to teach
and instruct it by word and by example; likewise of his means, how much
he ought to take for his household and house; and how much to dispense
to the poor and to other pious objects, not wanting nor seeking any
other thing except in all and through all the greater praise and glory
of God our Lord.

For let each one think that he will benefit himself in all spiritual
things in proportion as he goes out of his self-love, will and interest.
