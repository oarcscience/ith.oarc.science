### OF THE BIRTH OF CHRIST OUR LORD

St. Luke speaks in the second Chapter \[1-15\].

**First Point**. First: Our Lady and her husband Joseph go from Nazareth
to Bethlehem. "Joseph went up from Galilee to Bethlehem, to acknowledge
subjection to Caesar, with Mary his spouse and wife, already with
child."

**Second Point**. Second: "She brought forth her first-born Son and
wrapped Him up with swaddling clothes and laid Him in the manger."

**Third Point**. Third: "There came a multitude of the heavenly army,
which said: \`Glory be to God in the heavens.'"
