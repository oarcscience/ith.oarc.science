*The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola*, \[1914\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## GENERAL NOTE

In the reproduction of the text in English:

1\. No change whatever is made in the wording. The proper corrections,
however, of the two unimportant slips in quotation have been indicated
in italics.

It may be remarked in passing that the text of Holy Scripture is not
seldom given in the Spiritual Exercises in wording somewhat different
from that of the Vulgate. Such divergences have not been noted in this
translation. It will be remembered that, when the book was written, the
Council of Trent had not yet put its seal on the Vulgate.

2\. The head lines and the rubrics have been kept as they stand in the
Manuscript. Where they were wanting, they have been supplied in italics.

3\. Abbreviations have been filled out.

4\. Wherever italics are used, the words in this character belong to the
translator and not to St. Ignatius.

5\. In the use of small and capital letters, and in the matter of
punctuation and the division into paragraphs the practice of the copyist
has usually not been followed. Various kinds of type, also, are used
independently of the Manuscript.

6\. As a matter of convenience, in citations from Holy Scripture, the
modern method by chapter and verse is substituted for that of the Mss.
chapter and letter. Besides, quotations are indicated by quotation marks
in place of the parentheses of the Mss. *Elder Mullan, S.J.*
