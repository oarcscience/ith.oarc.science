### THE FIFTH DAY

**Fifth Day**. Contemplation on the Departure of Christ our Lord from
Nazareth to the River Jordan, and how He was baptized (p. 140).

**First Note**. This Contemplation will be made once at midnight and a
second time in the morning, and two repetitions on it at the hour of
Mass and Vespers, and the five senses will be applied on it before
supper; in each of these five Exercises, putting first the usual
Preparatory Prayer and the three Preludes, as all this was explained in
the Contemplation of the Incarnation and of the Nativity; and finishing
with the three Colloquies of the three Pairs, or according to the note
which follows after the Pairs.

**Second Note**. The Particular Examen, after dinner and after supper,
will be made on the faults and negligences about the Exercises and
Additions of this day; and so in the days that follow.
