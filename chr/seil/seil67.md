### OF THE MYSTERIES DONE FROM THE SUPPER TO THE GARDEN, INCLUSIVE

Matthew, Chapter 26, and Mark, Chapter 14.

**First Point.** First: The Supper finished, and singing the hymn, the
Lord went to Mount Olivet with His Disciples, who were full of fear; and
leaving the eight in Gethsemani, He said: "\`Sit ye here till I go
yonder to pray.'"

**Second Point.** Second: Accompanied by St. Peter, St. James and St.
John, He prayed three times to the Lord, saying: "\`Father, if it be
possible, let this chalice pass from Me. Nevertheless, let not My will
be done, but Thine.'" And being in agony, He prayed the longer.

**Third Point.** Third: He came into such fear, that He said: "\`My soul
is sorrowful unto death,'" and He sweated blood so plentiful, that St.
Luke says: "His sweat was as drops of blood which were running on the
earth;" which supposes that the garments were already full of blood.
