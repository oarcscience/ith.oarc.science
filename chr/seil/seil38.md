### THIRD METHOD OF PRAYER

It will be by rhythm.

**Addition**. The Addition will be the same as in the First and Second
Methods of Prayer.

**Prayer**. The Preparatory Prayer will be as in the Second Method of
Prayer.

**Third Method of Prayer**. The Third Method of Prayer is that with each
breath in or out, one has to pray mentally, saying one word of the OUR
FATHER, or of another prayer which is being recited: so that only one
word be said between one breath and another, and while the time from one
breath to another lasts, let attention be given chiefly to the meaning
of such word, or to the person to whom he recites it, or to his own
baseness, or to the difference from such great height to his own so
great lowness. And in the same form and rule he will proceed on the
other words of the OUR FATHER; and the other prayers, that is to say,
the HAIL MARY, the SOUL OF CHRIST, the CREED, and the HAIL, HOLY QUEEN,
he will make as he is accustomed.

**First Rule**. The First Rule is, on the other day, or at another hour,
that he wants to pray, let him say the HAIL MARY in rhythm, and the
other prayers as he is accustomed; and so on, going through the others.

**Second Rule**. The second is that whoever wants to dwell more on the
prayer by rhythm, can say all the above-mentioned prayers or part of
them, keeping the same order of the breath by rhythm, as has been
explained.
