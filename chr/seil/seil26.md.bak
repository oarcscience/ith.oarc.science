### THE ELEVENTH DAY

**Eleventh Day**. On the raising of Lazarus (p. 149).

### THE TWELFTH DAY

**Twelfth Day**. On Palm Sunday (p. 151).

**First Note**. The first note is that in the Contemplations of this
Second Week, according to the time each one wants to spend, or according
as he gets profit, he can lengthen or shorten: if he lengthens, taking
the Mysteries of the Visitation of Our Lady to St. Elizabeth, the
Shepherds, the Circumcision of the Child Jesus, and the Three Kings, and
so of others; and if he shortens, he can even omit some of those which
are set down. Because this is to give an introduction and way to
contemplate better and more completely afterwards.

**Second Note**. The second: The matter of the Elections will be begun
from the Contemplation on Nazareth to the Jordan, taken inclusively,
which is the fifth day, as is explained in the following.

**Third Note**. The third: Before entering on the Elections, that a man
may get attachment to the true doctrine of Christ our Lord, it is very
helpful to consider and mark the following three Manners of Humility,
reflecting on them occasionally through all the day, and also making the
Colloquies, as will be said later.

**First Humility**. The first manner of Humility is necessary for
eternal salvation; namely, that I so lower and so humble myself, as much
as is possible to me, that in everything I obey the law of God, so that,
even if they made me lord of all the created things in this world, nor
for my own temporal life, I would not be in deliberation about breaking
a Commandment, whether Divine or human, which binds me under mortal sin.

**Second Humility**. The second is more perfect Humility than the first;
namely, if I find myself at such a stage that I do not want, and feel no
inclination to have, riches rather than poverty, to want honor rather
than dishonor, to desire a long rather than a short life -- the service
of God our Lord and the salvation of my soul being equal; and so not for
all creation, nor because they would take away my life, would I be in
deliberation about committing a venial sin.

**Third Humility**. The third is most perfect Humility; namely, when --
including the first and second, and the praise and glory of the Divine
Majesty being equal -- in order to imitate and be more actually like
Christ our Lord, I want and choose poverty with Christ poor rather than
riches, opprobrium with Christ replete with it rather than honors; and
to desire to be rated as worthless and a fool for Christ, Who first was
held as such, rather than wise or prudent in this world.

**Note**. So, it is very helpful for whoever desires to get this third
Humility, to make the three already mentioned Colloquies of THE PAIRS,
asking that Our Lord would be pleased to choose him to this third
greater and better Humility, in order more to imitate and serve Him, if
it be equal or greater service and praise to His Divine Majesty.
