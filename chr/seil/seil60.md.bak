### OF HOW CHRIST OUR LORD GAVE TO EAT FIVE THOUSAND MEN

St. Matthew writes in the fourteenth Chapter \[13-22\].

**First Point.** First: The Disciples, as it was getting late, ask
Christ to dismiss the multitude of men who were with Him.

**Second Point.** Second: Christ our Lord commands that they bring Him
bread, and commanded that they should be seated at the table, and
blessed and broke and gave the bread to His Disciples, and the Disciples
to the multitude.

**Third Point.** Third: "They did eat and were filled and there were
twelve baskets over."
