<p> <b>First Point</b>. First: Christ our Lord, after having taken leave of His Blessed Mother, came from Nazareth to the River Jordan, where St. John Baptist was.
<p> <b>Second Point</b>. Second: St. John baptized Christ our Lord, and wanting to excuse himself, thinking himself unworthy of baptizing Him, Christ said to him: "Do this for the present, for so it is necessary that we fulfill all justice.'"
<p> <b>Third Point.</b> Third: "The Holy Spirit came and the voice of the Father from heaven affirming: `This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased.'"
