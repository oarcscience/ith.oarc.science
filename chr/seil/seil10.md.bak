### GENERAL CONFESSION WITH COMMUNION

Whoever, of his own accord, wants to make a General Confession, will,
among many other advantages, find three in making it here.

**First**. The first: Though whoever goes to Confession every year is
not obliged to make a General Confession, by making it there is greater
profit and merit, because of the greater actual sorrow for all the sins
and wickedness of his whole life.

**Second**. The second: In the Spiritual Exercises, sins and their
malice are understood more intimately, than in the time when one was not
so giving himself to interior things. Gaining now more knowledge of and
sorrow for them, he will have greater profit and merit than he had
before.

**Third**. The third is: In consequence, having made a better Confession
and being better disposed, one finds himself in condition and prepared
to receive the Blessed Sacrament: the reception of which is an aid not
only not to fall into sin, but also to preserve the increase of grace.

This General Confession will be best made immediately after the
Exercises of the First Week.
