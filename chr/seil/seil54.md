### OF HOW CHRIST CAST OUT OF THE TEMPLE THOSE WHO WERE SELLING

St. John writes Chapter 2 \[13-18\].

**First Point.** First: With a whip made of cords, He cast out of the
Temple all those who were selling.

**Second Point.** Second: He turned over the tables and money of the
rich bankers who were in the Temple.

**Third Point.** Third: To the poor who sold doves, He mildly said:
"\`Take these things from here, and make not My house a house of
traffic.'"
