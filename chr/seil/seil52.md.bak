### OF THE CALL OF THE APOSTLES

**First Point.** First: it seems that <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](seil83.htm#fn_25.md) St. Peter and St. Andrew were
called three times: first, to some knowledge; this is clear from St.
John in the first Chapter: secondly, to follow Christ in some way with
the purpose of returning to possess what they had left, as St. Luke says
in the fifth Chapter: thirdly, to follow Christ our Lord forever, as St.
Matthew says in the fourth Chapter and St. Mark in the first.

**Second Point.** Second: He called Philip, as is in the first Chapter
of St. John, and Matthew as Matthew himself says in the ninth Chapter.

**Third Point.** Third: He called the other Apostles, of whose special
call the Gospel does not make mention.

And three other things also would be to be considered:

The first, how the Apostles were of uneducated and low condition;

The second, the dignity to which they were so sweetly called;

The third, the gifts and graces by which they were raised above all the
Fathers of the New and Old Testaments.
