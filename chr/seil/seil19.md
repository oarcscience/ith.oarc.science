### THE SECOND DAY

**Second Day**. For first and second Contemplation to take the
Presentation in the Temple (p. 137) and the Flight to Egypt as into
exile (p. 138), and on these two Contemplations will be made two
repetitions and the Application of the Five Senses to them, in the same
way as was done the preceding day.

**Note**. Sometimes, although the one who is exercising himself is
strong and disposed, it helps to make a change, from this second day up
to the fourth inclusively, in order better to find what he desires,
taking only one Contemplation at daybreak, and another at the hour of
Mass, and to repeat on them at the hour of Vespers and apply the senses
before supper.
