### OF HOW THE APOSTLES WERE SENT TO PREACH

St. Matthew writes in the tenth Chapter

**First Point.** First: Christ called His beloved Disciples and gave
them power to cast out the demons from human bodies and to cure all the
diseases.

**Second Point.** Second: He teaches them of prudence and patience:
"\`Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be ye therefore
wise as serpents and simple as doves.'"

**Third Point.** Third: He gives them the way to go. "\`Do not want to
possess gold nor silver: what you have freely received, freely give.'"
And He gave them matter to preach. "\`Going you shall preach, saying:
\`The Kingdom of Heaven has approached.'"
