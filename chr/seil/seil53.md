### OF THE FIRST MIRACLE PERFORMED AT THE MARRIAGE OF CANA, GALILEE

St. John writes Chapter 2 \[1-12\].

**First Point.** First: Christ our Lord was invited with His Disciples
to the marriage.

**Second Point.** Second: The Mother tells her Son of the failure of the
wine, saying: "\`They have no wine,'"and bade the servants:
"\`Whatsoever He shall say to you, do ye.'"

**Third Point.** Third: "He changed the water into wine and manifested
His glory, and His Disciples believed in Him."
