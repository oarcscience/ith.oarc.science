*The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola*, \[1914\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

## SPIRITUAL EXERCISES TO CONQUER ONESELF AND REGULATE ONE'S LIFE WITHOUT DETERMINING ONESELF THROUGH <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](seil83.htm#fn_3.md) ANY TENDENCY THAT IS DISORDERED

### PRESUPPOSITION

In order that both he who is giving the Spiritual Exercises, and he who
is receiving them, may more help and benefit themselves, let it be
presupposed that every good Christian is to be more ready to save his
neighbor's proposition than to condemn it. If he cannot save it, let him
inquire how he means it; and if he means it badly, let him correct him
with charity. If that is not enough, let him seek all the suitable means
to bring him to mean it well, and save himself.
