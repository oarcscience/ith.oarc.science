### OF THE SERMON WHICH CHRIST MADE ON THE MOUNT

St. Matthew writes in the fifth Chapter \[1-48\].

**First Point.** First: To His beloved Disciples He speaks apart about
the Eight Beatitudes: "\`Blessed the poor of spirit, the meek, the
merciful, those who weep, those who suffer hunger and thirst for
justice, the clean of heart, the peaceful, and those who suffer
persecution.'"

**Second Point.** Second: He exhorts them to use their talents well:
"\`So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works
and glorify your Father Who is in the heavens.'"

**Third Point.** Third: He shows Himself not a transgressor, but a
perfector of the law; explaining the precept of not killing, not
committing fornication, not being guilty of perjury, and of loving
enemies. "\`I say to you that you love your enemies and do good to them
that hate you.'"
