### OF THE FLIGHT TO EGYPT

St. Matthew writes in the second Chapter \[13-16\].

**First Point**. First: Herod wanted to kill the Child Jesus, and so
killed the Innocents, and before their death the Angel warned Joseph to
fly into Egypt: "\`Arise and take the Child and His Mother, and fly to
Egypt.'"

**Second Point**. Second: He departed for Egypt. "Who arising by night
departed to Egypt."

**Third Point**. Third: He was there until the death of Herod.
