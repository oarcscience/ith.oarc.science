### NOTES

Cap. I.—The introductory part in the recension of Bryennius is largely
taken from the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. From cap. i. to vi.
it is almost certain that the writer must have had the text of the
Sermon on the Mount in his possession, as the coincidences are too
numerous to allow it to be supposed that they are based on traditional
sayings. The Gospel of St. John does not seem to have been used, and St.
Mark is only quoted once, in cap. xii., where St. Mark xi. 9 is alluded
to. There are a few quotations from the Old Testament. In my own
reconstruction of the text I have prefixed the commencement of the
Epitome, as it gives the names of the twelve Apostles, and assigns the
maxims to their various authors. The substance of the teaching is nearly
the same in the two works as far as cap. vi. At cap. vii. the Didache of
the recension of Bryennius diverges from the Epitome, and directions
from the Clementine Liturgies for the administration of the Sacrament
are added. The resemblance to the Clementine Liturgy in the 7th book of
the Apostolic Constitutions cannot be disputed, the form for the
administration of the Communion being substantially the same, though
with a few differences of expression employed.

Cap. III. \#\#\#.—This passage is quoted by Clement of Alexandria,
Stromata, i. 319; he apparently supposed that it came from one of the
canonical books: \#\#\#. No other quotations from the Didache have been
found. Cap. VI. \#\#\#. St. Clement to the Corinthians, ii. 3: \#\#\#.

Cap. VI.—No book of the Old Testament is mentioned in cap. i.–vi. of the
Didache, but a number of passages are evidently

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

alluded to. The following seem to have been used: Exodus xx. 13,
Proverbs xii. 15-2S, iii. 34; Tobit iv. 15; Habakkuk ii. g; Psalm i. 3,
4; and allusions to the following books may be traced: Leviticus,
Deuteronomy, Isaiah, Zechariah, the Book of Wisdom (several times), and
the Book of Baruch. With regard to the New Testament, besides the
quotations from St. Matthew and St. Luke, which form the basis of the
doctrine of the Way of life, there are many allusions to the Epistles of
St. Paul, particularly the Epistles to the Romans and Galatians, and the
Epistles of St. Peter, St. James, and St. Jude, so that there can be
little reason to doubt that the author or compiler had a complete copy
of the canonical books of the New Testament in his hands, from which he
drew the substance of his teaching.

Cap. VII.—With regard to the liturgical fragment given in cap. vii.–x.,
it is necessary to remark that it does not harmonise with any of the
ancient liturgies, with the exception of that found in the Clementine
Constitutions. The whole body of the Eastern and Western Liturgies may
be divided into four classes—the Roman, the Gallic, that of Alexandria,
and that of Jerusalem. The Clementine Liturgy, as found in the Apostolic
Constitutions, differs entirely from these four, and does not seem ever
to have been used, the object for which it was composed being apparently
unknown. The form given in the Didache for the celebration of the
Communion belongs to the Clementine series, and does not resemble in any
way that contained in the four ancient liturgies; and though it is not
precisely the same as that found in the 7th book of the Apostolic
Constitutions, it evidently belongs to the same recension.

The form given for the administration of baptism does not seem to
correspond with any form that was ever actually employed in the
Primitive Church. The expression, "having first recited all these
things"—i.e., all the preceding part of the Didache—cannot he allowed to
represent correctly the primitive form of baptism, which was entirely
different, nothing resembling the commencement of the Didache having
been employed. The oldest form, after that used in the New Testament, is
found in Tertullian and Cyprian. <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md)
According to Tertullian, the person to be baptized

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

renounced publicly the Devil, his pomp and his angels, and was then
dipped three times into water in the names of the three Persons of the
Trinity; and according to Cyprian, at a period a little later, a formal
confession of faith was made: "Dost thou believe in eternal life and the
remission of sins?" &c. The Clementine form for the administration of
baptism is given at cap. xxxix.–xlv. of the 7th book of the Apostolic
Constitutions, and does not resemble that given in the Didache, being a
service of some length, containing a confession of faith and directions
for the details of the baptism, which included the anointing with oil,
and instructions for the consecration of the oil and water employed. The
reason why the form given in the Didache differs from the Clementine
Constitutions does not seem to be known, the editor for some cause
declining to give the Clementine form, which is followed in the form for
the administration of the Communion. The form given in cap. ix. for the
administration of the Eucharist agrees on the whole with that found in
the Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 25, 26, though there are a few
differences in the expressions employed, and in the Apostolic
Constitutions no form is given for the consecration of the cup. Neither
form resembles that found in the ancient liturgies, where the service is
of much greater length. The expression "Holy vine of David" does not
occur in any of the earlier liturgies, and together with the sentence,
"This broken bread scattered upon the mountains," seems to point to
Palestine as the source of the passage, which may probably be a fragment
of the ancient Liturgy of Antioch or Caesarea. Cf. Clement of
Alexandria, Quis. Div. Salv. 29, p. 952: \#\#\#

Cap. VIII.—The version of the Lord's Prayer given in the Didache agrees
on the whole with that in the Apostolic Constitutions, with the
following variations:—

Didache: \#\#\#.

Apostolic Constitutions: \#\#\#.

The occurrence of the Doxology in the version given by the Didache, and
also in that of the Apostolic Constitutions, which, though not precisely
the same as that found in St. Matthew, is

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

in both instances substantially the same, proves conclusively that it
must have been part of the original prayer as recorded by St. Matthew,
and not an addition, as some critics hold, from the Greek service books.
The following are the variations in St. Matthew and St. Luke from the
version of the Didache:—

St. Matthew vi. 9: \#\#\#.

St. Matthew: \#\#\#.

St. Luke: the Doxology is omitted.

Cap. XI.—The directions given for the reception of prophets and apostles
are not precisely parallel to the directions in the Apostolic
Constitutions, and in some respects are peculiar to the Didache, though
there is a general resemblance to cap. xxviii. of the Apostolic
Constitutions. As to the substance of them, they do not justify the
statement in the text that they are \#\#\# (according to the precept of
the Gospel), as nothing resembling them is found in the Gospels of St.
Matthew and St. Luke. They do not, further, harmonise with the passages
relating to Church offices in Clemens Romanus and Hermas and the other
early authorities, who make no mention of the order, of prophets and
apostles as still existing, so that it seems best to regard them as the
composition of the compiler of the Didache, who inserted them to convey
the impression that the work was written in the time of the apostles
themselves.

Cap. XIII.—The passage about the maintenance of the ministers of the
Church is parallel to cap. xxix. of the Apostolic Constitutions, and
from cap. xiv. of the Didache to the conclusion the two works are
substantially the same, as will be seen by comparing them with cap.
xxx.–xxxii. of Book vii. of the Apostolic Constitutions.
