### INTRODUCTION

<span class="smallcaps">An</span> addition was unexpectedly made to the
scanty remains of the Apostolic period when, about the year 1873,
Bryennius, now Bishop of Nicomedia, discovered in the library of the
Holy Sepulchre at Constantinople a manuscript of the eleventh century,
containing, besides other works, a complete text of the First and Second
Epistles of St. Clement to the Corinthians, which had only existed
previously in a mutilated state in the Codex Alexandrinus, and a lost
work called "The Didache, or Teaching of the Apostles," which, though
mentioned in Athanasius <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) and
Eusebius <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) among the Apocryphal books of
the New Testament, had not, since the time of Nicephorus in the ninth
century, been known or quoted. The publication of the text by Bryennius
soon led to the discovery that, although new as a work with the title of
"The Didache, or Teaching of the Apostles," it was already substantially
known, nearly the whole of it being contained in three works that had
already been published—"The Epistle of Barnabas," "The Apostolical
Constitutions," and a recently discovered treatise called "The Epitome
of the Holy Apostles." This, though it does not affect the genuineness
of the discovery, affects a good deal the importance that was supposed
to attach to the publication

<span id="page_iv">p. iv</span>

of a new theological treatise of the Apostolic period. An examination of
the text as published by Bryennius, printed at the end of the
introduction, with the passages not previously known marked with
brackets, will show that practically the whole of the treatise, with the
exception of a few of the directions given for the reception of apostles
and prophets, was already known, and had been in the hands of scholars
for some time; so that the chief importance of the discovery would seem
to be its enabling us to identify the passages in the "Epistle of
Barnabas" and the "Apostolic Constitutions," and to refer to their
proper period and source what had hitherto been doubtful.

What, then, was the source from which the various writers, whose work we
find in the "Epistle of Barnabas," "The Shepherd of Hermas," "The
Apostolic Constitutions," and "The Epitome of the Holy Apostles," drew
the doctrines and regulations which we find for the first time collected
in the "Didache" of Bryennius? And the answer would seem to be this:
There existed at a very remote period, most likely before the end of the
first century, a work handed down by oral tradition which was supposed
to embody the verbal teaching of the first Apostles. The expression
itself, διδαχὴ τῶν άποστόλων, "teaching of the Apostles," occurs in Acts
xi. 42, and the use of the word διδαχὴ for teaching or doctrine is
common in the New Testament, <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) so that
it would be the natural title for a collection of sayings or precepts

<span id="page_.v">p. .v</span>

which had been handed down by tradition as representing the verbal
teaching of the Apostles. We may suppose that this work, after existing
for a time in a traditional form, was embodied in writing, and used to
form part of the earliest Christian books, and consequently portions of
it appeared in "The Shepherd of Hermas" and the Epistle attributed to
Barnabas.

At a period a little later, the compiler of the "Apostolic
Constitutions" included this traditional work, which had already partly
appeared in writing, in his collection of precepts supposed to have been
given by the Apostles themselves, so that in the seventh book of the
"Apostolic Constitutions" we find the doctrine of the Duæ Viæ worked out
at length, with precepts for the administration of the Sacraments and
the appointment of Christian ministers. At a still later period the
editor of the "Epitome of the Holy Apostles" endeavoured to complete the
notion of a Didache of the Apostles by giving the names of the Apostles
themselves, and referring each precept to its author. These four forms
of the Apostolic teaching, or, at any rate, the first three of them,
were in the hands of the anonymous writer of the treatise known as "The
Didache of the Apostles," who compiled and abridged from them the work
that we now possess as the Didache, giving in a condensed form what had
previously existed in a number of other works, with a view to supplying
a manual of conduct, based on the actual teaching of the Apostles
themselves, and adding some formulæ, possibly belonging to an earlier
period than his own, for the administration of the Sacraments and the
appointment and maintenance of ministers and church officers.

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

But what, it may be asked, was the nature of this teaching, supposed to
have been handed down by tradition as having been delivered by the first
Apostles? The idea was that of the Duæ Viæ or two ways, a series of
ethical precepts as to what was to be avoided, and what was to be
followed in conduct, to which were added a few directions as to the
administration of the Sacraments, and the appointment of church
officers.

The notion of the two ways or modes of conduct laid before men is one of
great antiquity, occurring in Scripture as early as the Book of
Deuteronomy, xxvii. 4, where the Israelites are commanded, after they
had entered Palestine, to select the two mountains of Ebal and
Gerizim—Gerizim representing the path of obedience and Ebal that of
transgression, blessings being pronounced from the one and curses from
the other; and the command, we are told, was actually carried out by
Joshua after the Israelites had occupied Palestine. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) The same notion occurs in the prophecies of
Jeremiah xxi. 8: "Thus saith the Lord, Behold I set before you the way
of life and the way of death." It is also found in the classical writers
as early as Hesiod, and it appears in the fable called "The Choice of
Hercules," attributed to Prodicus the sophist. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md) The notion is that of two paths placed
before a person at the commencement of his career, the one narrow and
difficult but right, the other easy and pleasant but wrong. In this
shape it is found in the Canonical Gospels, cf. Matt. vii. 13, where the
εὐρύχωρος ὁδὸς and the τεθλιμμένη ὁδὸς are mentioned and

<span id="page_vii">p. vii</span>

contrasted. "Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to
destruction, and many there be which go in thereat; because strait is
the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be
that find it;" and this passage is most likely the real source of the
doctrine of the two ways found in the "Epistle of Barnabas," where we
read, "There are two ways of teaching and authority, one of light and
the other of darkness, and the difference is great between the two
ways." This idea of the two ways is expanded and worked out at some
length, first in the "Epistle of Barnabas," and afterwards in the
"Apostolic Constitutions " and the "Epitome of the Holy Apostles," and
for some reason the name of St. Peter came to be connected with it. Thus
it is stated by Athanasius in his remarks on the Canon—"There are also
other books, not canonical, but called by the fathers ecclesiastical,
such as the book called 'The Shepherd of Hermas' and that which is
called 'The Two Ways, or the Judgment of Peter;'" and the same work
seems to be mentioned by Eusebius with the title of "The Teachings of
the Apostles," διδαχὰι τῶν ἀποστόλων. Thus a new manual of ethics was
formed for the use of the Christian Church, based partly on the actual
teaching of Christ as found in the Gospels, partly on the application of
the ideas contained in it, which are arranged and enlarged so as to form
a complete manual of duty. To this was added, apparently on the same
authority, the oral tradition of the Apostolic teaching, directions for
the administration of the Sacraments and the appointment and maintenance
of ministers of religion. The work thus edited would supply a code of
Christian duty and discipline, based upon what was supposed to have

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

been said by the Apostles themselves, and supported by passages from the
Canonical Gospels, and as such would be what Athanasius calls it, not
canonical; or to be considered a book of the New Testament, but useful
to persons who had recently joined the Christian Church, and wished to
be instructed in the duties of a pious life. These books were, he says,
"The Wisdom of Solomon," "The Wisdom of Sirach," the Books of Esther,
Judith, and Tobit, the work called "The Teaching of the Apostles " and
the "Shepherd." We thus arrive at the complete nature of the work called
"The Didache, or Teaching of the Apostles," and find it to be in reality
a combination of two systems of teaching, perhaps of two treatises, the
Duæ Viæ or Judicium Petri, and the διδαχὰι τῶν ἀποστόλων or the
doctrines of the Apostles. From the first comes the doctrine of the two
paths; from the second, the directions for the administration of the
Sacraments and the appointment and maintenance of ministers of
religion. <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md)

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

It remains to trace chronologically the various sources from which the
Didache seems to have been compiled. The doctrine of the Two Ways is
first found in Christian literature at the conclusion of the Epistle of
Barnabas, which may date perhaps as early as 79 A.D., though the
majority of critics place it about the beginning of the second century.
"Let us pass on," he says, "to another method of knowledge and teaching.
There are two paths

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

of teaching and authority, that of light and that of darkness." The
passage which follows should be compared with the Didache of Bryennios,
i.—v.; the use of the word διδαχὴ, ἐπι ἑτέραν γνῶσιν καὶ διδαχήν, in the
introductory sentence should be noticed, as it apparently contains the
germ of the notion, afterwards expanded in the second century, of a
διδαχὴ or system of teaching inculcated by the early teachers of
Christianity.

The passages that follow are from c. xviii. to xx. of the Epistle of
Barnabas; they should be carefully compared with the Didache discovered
by Bryennios, as they contain the earliest statement of the doctrine of
the two ways, and represent, more closely perhaps than the later work,
the traditional teaching of the Apostles.

Next in order follows the Shepherd of Hermas, with a date not much later
than the Epistle of Barnabas, and certainly one of the oldest Christian
works outside the canon of the New Testament. Here we have again the
doctrine of the two ways, called here the ὀρθὴ and στρεβλὴ ὁδὸς, the
straight and the crooked path, and two angels are fancifully represented
as presiding over them. "Walk thou," says the author of the Shepherd,
"in the straight path, and avoid the crooked." The notion of duality in
conduct, of two lines of life laid before every one, one to be avoided,
and the other to be followed, is insisted upon in Hermas chiefly on
ethical grounds, and with little reference to Scripture, but more to the
δίκαιον and ἄδικον of the philosophic schools, and even an

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

allusion to the system of the Peripatetics might be traced in the use of
the terms δύναμις and ἐνέργεια. <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)

Long passage in Greek omitted…

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

…

Next follows the recently discovered work, which is best described as
the Duæ Viæ or Judicium Petri. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) It does
not seem to be quite complete, as though two ways are mentioned in c. I,
only the ὁδὸς ζωῆς is given in detail, the ὁδὸς θανάτου being omitted;
it concludes with directions for the appointment of church officers. It
is impossible to avoid noticing the similarity between the style of the
Epitome or Duæ Viæ and a well-known

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

fragment of Papias, <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) so that it might
almost be conjectured that a portion of the Λογῶν κυριακῶν ἐξήγησις of
Papias was contained in the Judicium Petri, which would thus carry the
source of the Teaching of the Apostles almost to the Apostolic period.
The text of Hilgenfeld has been given, who cites three manuscripts of
the work: Vindobonensis, Mosquensis, Ottobonianus. There is also a
Syriac version.

Long passage in Greek omitted…

<span id="page_xvii–xxiv">p. xvii–xxiv</span>

…

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

Next follows the seventh book of the "Apostolic Constitutions," composed
most likely about 250 A.D. In chapters i.–xxxii, is contained nearly the
whole of the Didache of Bryennius, only more complete in form,

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

and with the precepts worked out at length. There is no reference to any
previous treatise, but the doctrine of the Two Ways is given as one of
the Apostolic Doctrines; and is supplemented by directions for the
administration of the Sacraments and the appointment of church officers,
and a prediction of the end of the world follows.

This completes the series of works parallel with the Didache, and by
comparing them with the Constantinople manuscript it will be seen that
nearly every sentence in the Didache of Bryennius occurs in one or other
of the four works cited. So that the question arises whether the Didache
was the source from which the other writers drew their sentiments, or
whether it was not an epitome or collection made by an anonymous writer,
who selected what he considered to be the primitive doctrines of the
Apostles, omitting what he considered to be of later date or less
importance, and forming out of their teaching a short manual of duty.
The shortness of the treatise published by Bryennius seems to suggest
the latter view, which will make the work somewhat resemble the Syriac
version of Ignatius, which is now acknowledged to be an abridgment of
the Greek. <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md)

when it was published at Giessen by Bichell, and afterwards by
Hilgenfeld at Leipsic in 1866: it is referred to by Rufinus Aquitanus in
the following passage, 345-450 A.D.:—"Sciendum tamen est, quod et alii
libri sunt, qui non canonici, sed ecclesiastici a maioribus appellati
sunt: ut est Sapientia Salomonis et ilia, Sapientia quæ dicitur filii
Syrach, qui liber apud Latinos hoc ipso generali vocabulo Ecclesiasticus

some plausibility, that it is in reality a portion of the missing
Judicium Petri. If, however, the title of Epitome is preferred, it would
be a collection of precepts on the subject of the Two Paths, with St.
Peter as the chief speaker. The commencement should be compared with
that of the Epistle of Barnabas.

supposed that he had discovered the missing Διδαχὴ τῶν ἀποστόλων in some
Arabic fragments of the Apostolical Constitutions found by him in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford; but though he was right in his conjecture
that the two works coincided in part, none of his fragments are found in
the genuine Didache, being all taken from the first to the fourth book
of the Apostolical Constitutions, while the Didache is only found in the
seventh, book (Whiston, "Primitive Christianity Revived," p. 81); and
Grabe himself was mistaken (cf. Grabe, "An Essay upon two Arabic
Manuscripts ") in supposing that it was contained in the eighth book;
the fact that it was really contained in the seventh <span
id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span> book not having been known until the
discovery of the manuscript at Constantinople, all the previous
conjectures as to the nature and contents of the lost work having been
entirely incorrect.
