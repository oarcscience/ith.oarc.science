<span id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

### THE TEACHING OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES.

I. <span class="smallcaps">There</span> are two paths, one of life and
one of death, and the difference is great between the two paths.

Now the path of life is this—first, thou shalt love the God who made
thee, thy neighbour as thyself, and all things that thou wouldest not
should be done unto thee, do not thou unto another. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) And the doctrine of these maxims is as
follows. Bless them that curse you, and pray for your enemies. <span
id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md) Fast on behalf of those that persecute
you; for what thank is there if ye love them that love you? do not even
the Gentiles do the same But do ye love them that hate you, and ye will
not have an enemy. Abstain from fleshly and worldly lusts. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[3](#fn_12.md) If any one give thee a blow on thy right
cheek, turn unto him the other also, and thou shalt be perfect; if any
one compel thee to go a mile, go with him two; if a man take away thy
cloak, give him thy coat also; if a man take from thee what is thine,
ask not for it again, for neither art thou able to do so. <span
id="fr_13"></span>[4](#fn_13.md) Give to every one that asketh of thee, and
ask not again, for the Father wishes that from his own gifts there
should

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

be given to all. Blessed is he who giveth according to the commandment,
for he is free from guilt; but woe unto him that receiveth. For if a man
receive being in need, he shall be free from guilt; but he who receiveth
when not in need, shall pay a penalty as to why he received and for what
purpose; and when he is in tribulation he shall be examined concerning
the things that he bas done, and shall not depart thence until be has
paid the last farthing. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) For of a
truth it has been said on these matters, Let thy almsgiving abide in thy
hands until thou knowest to whom thou hast given.

II\. But the second commandment of the teaching is this. Thou shalt not
kill; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not corrupt youth; thou
shalt not commit fornication; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not use
soothsaying; thou shalt not practise sorcery; thou shalt not kill a
child by abortion, neither shalt thou slay it when born; thou shalt not
covet the goods of thy neighbour; thou shalt not commit perjury; thou
shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt not speak evil; thou shalt not
bear malice; thou shalt not be double-minded or double-tongued, for to
be double-tongued is the snare of death. Thy speech shall not be false
or empty, but concerned with action. Thou shalt not be covetous, or
rapacious, or hypocritical, or malicious, or proud; thou shalt not take
up an evil design against thy neighbour; thou shalt not hate any man,
but some thou shalt confute, concerning some thou shalt pray, and some
thou shalt love beyond thine own soul.

III\. My child, fly from everything that is evil, and from everything
that is like to it. Be not wrathful, for

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

wrath leadeth unto slaughter; be not jealous, or contentious, or
quarrelsome, for from all these things slaughter ensues. My child, be
not lustful, for lust leadeth unto fornication; be not a filthy talker;
be not a lifter up of the eye, for from all these things come
adulteries. My child, be not an observer of omens, since it leadeth to
idolatry, nor a user of spells, nor an astrologer, nor a travelling
purifier, nor wish to see these things, for from all these things
idolatry ariseth. My child, be not a liar, for lying leadeth unto theft;
be not covetous or conceited, for from all these things thefts arise. My
child, be not a murmurer, since it leadeth unto blasphemy; be not
self-willed or evil-minded, for from all these things blasphemies are
produced; but be thou meek, for the meek shall inherit the earth; <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) be thou long-suffering, and compassionate,
and harmless, and peaceable, and good, and fearing alway the words that
thou hast heard. Thou shalt not exalt thyself, neither shalt thou put
boldness into thy soul. Thy soul shall not be joined unto the lofty, but
thou shalt walk with the just and humble. Accept the things that happen
to thee as good, knowing that without God nothing happens.

IV\. My child, thou shalt remember both night and day him that speaketh
unto thee the Word of God; thou shalt honour him as thou dost the Lord,
for where the teaching of the Lord is given, there is the Lord; thou
shalt seek out day by day the favour of the saints, that thou mayest
rest in their words; thou shalt not desire schism, but shalt set at
peace them that contend; thou shalt judge righteously; thou shalt not
accept the

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

person of any one to convict him of transgression; thou shalt not doubt
whether a thing shall be or not. Be not a stretcher out of thy hand to
receive, and a drawer of it back in giving. If thou hast, give by means
of thy hands a redemption for thy sins. Thou shalt not doubt to give,
neither shalt thou murmur when giving; for thou shouldest know who is
the fair recompenser of the reward. Thou shalt not turn away from him
that is in need, but shalt share with thy brother in all things, and
shalt not say that things are thine own; for if ye are partners in what
is immortal, how much more in what is mortal? Thou shalt not remove
thine heart from thy son or from thy daughter, but from their youth
shalt teach them the fear of God. Thou shalt not command with bitterness
thy servant or thy handmaid, who hope in the same God as thyself, lest
they fear not in consequence the God who is over both; for he cometh not
to call with respect of persons, but those whom the Spirit hath
prepared. And do ye servants submit yourselves to your masters <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) with reverence and fear, as being the type
of God. Thou shalt hate all hypocrisy and everything that is not
pleasing to God; thou shalt not abandon the commandments of the Lord,
but shalt guard that which thou hast received, neither adding thereto
nor taking therefrom; thou shalt confess thy transgressions in the
church, and shalt not come unto prayer with an evil conscience. This is
the path of life.

V. But the path of death is this. First of all, it is evil and full of
cursing; there are found murders, adulteries, lusts, fornication,
thefts, idolatries, soothsaying,

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

sorceries, robberies, false witnessings, hypocrisies, double-mindedness,
craft, pride, malice, self-will, covetousness, filthy talking, jealousy,
audacity, arrogance; there are they who persecute the good—lovers of a
lie, not knowing the reward of righteousness, not cleaving to the good
nor to righteous judgment, watching not for the good but for the bad,
from whom meekness and patience are afar off, loving things that are
vain, following after recompense, having no compassion on the needy, nor
labouring for him that is in trouble, not knowing him that made them,
murderers of children, corrupters of the image of God, who turn away
from him that is in need, who oppress him that is in trouble, unjust
judges of the poor, erring in all things. From all these, children, may
ye be delivered.

VI\. See that no one make thee to err from this path of doctrine, since
he who doeth so teacheth thee apart from God. If thou art able to bear
the whole yoke of the Lord, thou wilt be perfect; but if thou art not
able, what thou art able, that do. But concerning meat, bear that which
thou art able to do. But keep with care from things sacrificed to idols,
for it is the worship of the infernal deities.

VII\. But concerning baptism, thus baptize ye: having first recited all
these precepts, baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Spirit, in running water; but if thou hast not running
water, baptize in some other water, and if thou canst not baptize in
cold, in warm water; but if thou hast neither, pour water three times on
the head, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit. But before the baptism, let him who baptizeth and he who

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

is baptized fast previously, and any others who may he able. And thou
shalt command him who is baptized to fast one or two days before.

VIII\. But as for your fasts, let them not be with the hypocrites, for
they fast on the second and fifth days of the week, but do ye fast on
the fourth and sixth days. Neither pray ye as the hypocrites, <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) but as the Lord hath commanded in his
Gospel so pray ye: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy
kingdom come. Thy will be done as in heaven so on earth. Give us this
day our daily bread. And forgive us our debt, as we also forgive our
debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil:
for thine is the power, and the glory, for ever. <span
id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md) Thrice a day pray ye in this fashion.

IX\. But concerning the Eucharist, after this fashion give ye thanks.
First, concerning the cup. We thank thee, our Father, for the holy vine,
David thy Son, which thou hast made known unto us through Jesus Christ
thy Son; to thee be the glory for ever. And concerning the broken bread.
We thank thee, our Father, for the life and knowledge which thou hast
made known unto us through Jesus thy Son; to thee be the glory for ever.
As this broken bread was once scattered on the mountains, and after it
had been brought together became one, so may thy Church be gathered
together from the ends of the earth unto thy kingdom; for thine is the
glory, and the power, through Jesus Christ, for ever. And let none eat
or drink of your Eucharist but such as have been baptized into the name
of the Lord, for of a truth the Lord hath

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

said concerning this, Give not that which is holy unto dogs. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)

X. But after it has been completed, so pray ye. We thank thee, holy
Father, for thy holy name, which thou hast caused to dwell in our
hearts, and for the knowledge and faith and immortality which thou hast
made known unto us through Jesus thy Son; to thee be the glory for ever.
Thou, Almighty Master, didst create all things for the sake of thy name,
and hast given both meat and drink for men to enjoy, that we might give
thanks unto thee, but to us thou hast given spiritual meat and drink,
and life everlasting, through thy Son. Above all, we thank thee that
thou art able to save; to thee be the glory for ever. Remember, Lord,
thy Church, to redeem it from every evil, and to perfect it in thy love,
and gather it together from the four winds, even that which has been
sanctified for thy kingdom which thou hast prepared for it; for thine is
the kingdom and the glory for ever. Let grace come, and let this world
pass away. Hosanna to the Son of David. <span
id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md) If any one is holy, let him come (to the
Eucharist); if any one is not, let him repent. Maranatha. Amen. But
charge the prophets to give thanks, so far as they are willing to do so.

XI\. Whosoever, therefore, shall come and teach you all these things
aforesaid, him do ye receive; but if the teacher himself turn and teach
another doctrine with a view to subvert you, hearken not to him; but if
he come to add to your righteousness, and the knowledge of the Lord,
receive him as the Lord. But concerning the apostles and prophets, thus
do ye according to the

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

doctrine of the Gospel. Let every apostle who cometh unto you be
received as the Lord. He will remain one day, and if it be necessary, a
second; but if he remain three days, he is a false prophet. And let the
apostle when departing take nothing but bread until he arrive at his
resting-place; but if he ask for money, he is a false prophet. And ye
shall not attempt or dispute with any prophet who speaketh in the
spirit; for every sin shall be forgiven, but this sin shall not be
forgiven. <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) But not every one who
speaketh in the spirit is a prophet, but he is so who hath the
disposition of the Lord; by their disposition they therefore shall be
known, the false prophet and the prophet. And every prophet who ordereth
in the spirit that a table shall be laid, shall not eat of it himself,
but if he do otherwise, he is a false prophet; and every prophet who
teacheth the truth, if he do not what he teacheth is a false prophet;
and every prophet who is approved and true, and ministering in the
visible mystery of the Church, but who teacheth not others to do the
things that he doth himself, shall not be judged of you, for with God
lieth his judgment, for in this manner also did the ancient prophets.
But whoever shall say in the spirit, Give me money, or things of that
kind, listen not to him; but if he tell you concerning others that are
in need that ye should give unto them, let no one judge him.

XII\. Let every one that cometh in the name of the Lord be received, but
afterwards ye shall examine him and know his character, for ye have
knowledge both of good and evil. If the person who cometh be a wayfarer,
assist him so far as ye are able; but he will not remain

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

with you more than two or three days, unless there be a necessity. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) But if he wish to settle with you, being a
craftsman, let him work, and so eat; but if he know not any craft,
provide ye according to your own discretion, that a Christian may not
live idle among you; but if he be not willing to do so, he is a
trafficker in Christ. From such keep aloof.

XIII\. But every true prophet who is willing to dwell among you is
worthy of his meat, likewise a true teacher is himself worthy of his
meat, even as is a labourer. Thou shalt, therefore, take the
first-fruits of every produce of the wine-press and threshing-floor, of
oxen and sheep, and shalt give it to the prophets, for they are your
chief priests; but if ye have not a prophet, give it unto the poor. If
thou makest a feast, take and give the first-fruits according to the
commandment; in like manner when thou openest a jar of wine or of oil,
take the first-fruits and give it to the prophets; take also the
first-fruits of money, of clothes, and of every possession, as it shall
seem good unto thee, and give it according to the commandment.

XIV\. But on the Lord's day, after that ye have assembled together,
break bread and give thanks, having in addition confessed your sins,
that your sacrifice may be pure. But let not any one who hath a quarrel
with his companion join with you, until they be reconciled, that your
sacrifice may not be polluted, for it is that which is spoken of by the
Lord. In every place and time offer unto me a pure sacrifice, for I am a
great King, saith the Lord, and my name is wonderful among the
Gentiles. <span id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md)

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

XV\. Elect, therefore, for yourselves bishops and deacons worthy of the
Lord, men who are meek and not covetous, and true and approved, for they
perform for you the service of prophets and teachers. Do not, therefore,
despise them, for they are those who are honoured among you, together
with the prophets and teachers. Rebuke one another, not in wrath, but
peaceably, as ye have commandment in the Gospel; and, but let no one
speak to any one who walketh disorderly with regard to his neighbour,
neither let him be heard by you until he repent. But your prayers and
your almsgivings and all your deeds so do, as ye have commandment in the
Gospel of our Lord. <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md)

Watch concerning your life; let not your lamps be quenched or your loins
be loosed, <span id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md) but be ye ready, for ye
know not the hour at which our Lord cometh. <span
id="fr_26"></span>[3](#fn_26.md) But be ye gathered together frequently,
seeking what is suitable for your souls; for the whole time of your
faith shall profit you not, unless ye be found perfect in the last time.
For in the last days false prophets and seducers shall be multiplied,
and the sheep shall be turned into wolves, and love shall be turned into
hate; and because iniquity aboundeth they shall hate each other, and
persecute each other, and deliver each other up; and then shall the
Deceiver of the world appear as the Son of God, and shall do signs and
wonders, and the earth shall be delivered into his hands; and he shall
do unlawful things, such as have never happened since the beginning of
the world. Then shall the creation of man come to the fiery trial of
proof, and many

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

shall be offended and shall perish; but they who remain in their faith
shall be saved by the rock of offence itself. And then shall appear the
signs of the truth; first the sign of the appearance in heaven, then the
sign of the sound of the trumpet; and thirdly, the resurrection of the
dead—not of all, but as it has been said, The Lord shall come and all
his saints with him; then shall the world behold the Lord coming on the
clouds of heaven. <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md)
