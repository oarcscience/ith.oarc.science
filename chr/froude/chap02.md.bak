## <span style="font-weight: 400">CONVICTION OF SIN. </span>

*THE Pilgrim's Progress* is the history of the struggle of human nature
to overcome temptation and shake off the bondage of sin, under the
convictions which prevailed among serious men in England in the
seventeenth century. The allegory is the life of its author cast in an
imaginative form. Every step in Christian's journey had been first
trodden by Bunyan himself; every pang of fear and shame, every spasm of
despair, every breath of hope and consolation, which is there described,
is but a reflexion as on a mirror from personal experience. It has
spoken to the hearts of all later generations of Englishmen because it
came from the heart; because it is the true record of the genuine
emotions of a human soul; and to such a record the emotions of other men
will respond, as one stringed instrument vibrates responsively to
another. The poet's power lies in creating sympathy; but he cannot,
however richly gifted, stir feelings which he has not himself known in
all their intensity.

    "Ut ridentibus arrident ita flentibus adflent  
    Human! vultus. Si vis me flere dolendum est  
    Primum ipsi tibi."

The religious history of man is essentially the same in all ages. It
takes its rise in the duality of his nature. He is an animal, and as an
animal he desires bodily pleasure and shrinks from bodily pain. As a
being capable of morality, he is conscious that for him there exists a
right and wrong. Something, whatever that something may be, binds him to
choose one and avoid the other. This is his religion, his religatio, his
obligation, in the sense in which the Romans, from whom we take it, used
the word; and obligation implies some superior power to which man owes
obedience. The conflict between his two dispositions agitates his heart
and perplexes his intellect. To do what the superior power requires of
him, he must thwart his inclinations. He dreads punishment, if he
neglects to do it. He invents methods by which he can indulge his
appetites, and finds a substitute by which he can propitiate his
invisible ruler or rulers. He offers sacrifices; he institutes
ceremonies and observances. This is the religion of the body, the
religion of fear. It is what we call superstition. In his nobler moods
he feels that this is but to evade the difficulty. He perceives that the
sacrifice required is the sacrifice of himself. It is not the penalty
for sin which he must fear, but the sin itself. He must conquer his own
lower nature. He must detach his heart from his pleasures, and he must
love good for its own sake, and because it is his only real good; and
this is spiritual religion or piety. Between these two forms of worship
of the unseen, the human race has swayed to and fro from the first
moment in which they learnt to discern between good and evil.
Superstition attracts, because it is indulgent to immorality by
providing means by which God can be pacified. But it carries its
antidote along with it, for it keeps alive the sense of God's existence;
and when it has produced its natural effects, when the believer rests in
his observances and lives practically as if there was no God at all, the
conscience again awakes. Sacrifices and ceremonies become detested as
idolatry, and religion becomes conviction of sin, a fiery determination
to fight with the whole soul against appetite, vanity, self-seeking, and
every mean propensity which the most sensitive alarm can detect. The
battle unhappily is attended with many vicissitudes. The victory, though
practically it may be won, is never wholly won. The struggle brings with
it every variety of emotion, alternations of humility and confidence,
despondency and hope. The essence of it is always the same--the effort
of the higher nature to overcome the lower. The form of it varies from
period to period, according to the conditions of the time, the
temperament of different people, the conception of the character of the
Supreme Power, which the state of knowledge enables men to form. It will
be found even when the puzzled intellect can see no light in Heaven at
all, in the stern and silent fulfilment of moral duty. It will appear as
enthusiasm; it will appear as asceticism; it will appear wherever there
is courage to sacrifice personal enjoyment for a cause believed to be
holy. We must all live. We must all, as we suppose, in one shape or
other, give account for our actions; and accounts of the conflict are
most individually interesting when it is an open wrestle with the enemy;
as we find in the penances and austerities of the Catholic saints, or
when the difficulties of belief are confessed and detailed, as in
David's Psalms, or in the Epistles of St. Paul. St. Paul, like the rest
of mankind, found a law in his members warring against the law which was
in his heart. The problem presented to him was how one was to be brought
into subjection to the other, and the solution was by "the putting on of
Christ." St. Paul's mind was charged with the ideas of Oriental and
Greek philosophy then prevalent in the Roman Empire. His hearers
understood him, because he spoke in the language of the prevailing
speculations. We who have not the clue cannot, perhaps, perfectly
understand him; but his words have been variously interpreted as human
intelligence has expanded, and have formed the basis of the two great
theologies which have been developed out of Christianity. The Christian
religion taught that evil could not be overcome by natural human
strength. The Son of God had come miraculously upon earth, had lived a
life of stainless purity, and had been offered as a sacrifice to redeem
men conditionally from the power of sin. The conditions, as English
Protestant theology understands them, are nowhere more completely
represented than in *The Pilgrim's Progress.* The Catholic theology,
rising as it did in the two centuries immediately following St. Paul,
approached, probably, nearer to what he really intended to say.

Catholic theology, as a system, is a development of Platonism. The
Platonists had discovered that the seat of moral evil was material
substance. In matter, and therefore in the human body, there was either
some inherent imperfection, or some ingrained perversity and antagonism
to good. The soul, so long as it was attached to the body, was
necessarily infected by it; and as human life on earth consisted in the
connection of soul and body, every single man was necessarily subject to
infirmity Catholic theology accepted the position and formulated an
escape from it. The evil in matter was a fact. It was explained by
Adam's sin. But there it was. The taint was inherited by all Adam's
posterity. The flesh of man was incurably vitiated, and if he was to be
saved, a new body must be prepared for him. This Christ had done.

That Christ's body was not as other men's bodies was proved after his
resurrection, when it showed itself independent of the limitations of
extended substance. In virtue of these mysterious properties, it became
the body of the Corporate Church, into which believers were admitted by
baptism. The natural body was not at once destroyed, but a new element
was introduced into it, by the power of which, assisted by penance, and
mortification, and the spiritual food of the Eucharist, the grosser
qualities were gradually subdued, and the corporeal system was changed.
Then body and spirit became alike pure together, and the saint became
capable of obedience, so perfect as not only to suffice for himself, but
to supply the wants of others. The corruptible put on incorruption. The
bodies of the saints worked miracles, and their flesh was found
unaffected by decay after hundreds of years.

This belief, so long as it was sincerely held, issued naturally in
characters of extreme beauty--of beauty so great as almost to
demonstrate its truth. The purpose of it, so far as it affected action,
was self-conquest. Those who try with their whole souls to conquer
themselves find the effort lightened by a conviction that they are
receiving supernatural assistance; and the form in which the Catholic
theory supposed the assistance to be given was at least perfectly
innocent. But it is in the nature of human speculations, though they may
have been entertained at first in entire good faith, to break down under
trial, if they are not in conformity with fact. Catholic theology
furnished Europe with a rule of faith and action which lasted 1500
years. For the last three centuries of that period it was changing from
a religion into a superstition, till, from being the world's guide, it
became its scandal. "The body of Christ" had become a kingdom of this
world, insulting its subjects by the effrontery of its ministers, the
insolence of its pretensions, the mountains of lies which it was
teaching as sacred truths. Luther spoke; and over half the Western world
the Catholic Church collapsed, and a new theory and Christianity had to
be constructed out of the fragments of it.

There was left behind a fixed belief in God and in the Bible as His
revealed word, in a future judgment, in the fall of man, in the
atonement made for sin by the death of Christ, and in the new life which
was made possible by His resurrection. The change was in the conception
of the method by which the atonement was imagined to be efficacious. The
material or sacramental view of it, though it lingered inconsistently in
the mind even of Luther himself, was substantially gone. New ideas
adopted in enthusiasm are necessarily extreme. The wrath of God was held
to be inseparably and eternally attached to every act of sin, however
infirm the sinner. That his nature could be changed, and that he could
be mystically strengthened by incorporation with Christ's body in the
Church, was contrary to experience, and was no longer credible. The
conscience of every man, in the Church or out of it, told him that he
was daily and hourly offending. God's law demanded a life of perfect
obedience, eternal death being the penalty of the lightest breach of it.
No human being was capable of such perfect obedience. He could not do
one single act which would endure so strict a scrutiny. All mankind were
thus included under sin. The Catholic Purgatory was swept away. It had
degenerated into a contrivance for feeding the priests with money, and
it implied that human nature could in itself be renovated by its own
sufferings. Thus nothing lay before the whole race except everlasting
reprobation. But the door of hope had been opened on the cross of
Christ. Christ had done what man could never do. He had fulfilled the
law perfectly. God was ready to accept Christ's perfect righteousness as
a substitute for the righteousness which man was required to present to
him, but could not. The conditions of acceptance were no longer
sacraments or outward acts, or lame and impotent efforts after a moral
life, but faith in what Christ had done; a complete self-abnegation, a
resigned consciousness of utter unworthiness, and an unreserved
acceptance of the mercy held out through the Atonement. It might have
been thought that since man was born so weak that it was impossible for
him to do what the law required, consideration would be had for his
infirmity; that it was even dangerous to attribute to the Almighty a
character so arbitrary as that He would exact an account from his
creatures which the creature's necessary inadequacy rendered him
incapable of meeting. But the impetuosity of the new theology would
listen to no such excuses. God was infinitely pure, and nothing impure
could stand in his sight. Man, so long as he rested on merit of his own,
must be for ever excluded from his presence. He must accept grace on the
terms on which it was held out to him; then, and then only, God would
extend his pity to him. He was no longer a child of wrath: he was God's
child. His infirmities remained, but they were constantly obliterated by
the merits of Christ. And he had strength given to him, partially, at
least, to overcome temptation, under which, but for that strength, he
would have fallen. Though nothing which he could do could deserve
reward, yet he received grace in proportion to the firmness of his
belief; and his efforts after obedience, imperfect though they might be,
were accepted for Christ's sake. A good life, or a constant effort after
a good life, was still the object which a man was bound to labour after.
Though giving no claim to pardon, still less for reward, it was the
necessary fruit of a sense of what Christ had done, and of love and
gratitude towards him. Good works were the test of saving faith; and if
there were no signs of them, the faith was barren: it was not real faith
at all.

This was the Puritan belief in England in the seventeenth century. The
reason starts at it, but all religion is paradoxical to reason. God
hates sin, yet sin exists. He is omnipotent, yet evil is not overcome.
The will of man is free, or there can be no guilt; yet the action of the
will, so far as experience can throw light on its operation, is as much
determined by antecedent causes as every other natural force. Prayer is
addressed to a Being assumed to be omniscient; who knows better what is
good for us than we can know; who sees our thoughts without requiring to
hear them in words; whose will is fixed and cannot be changed. Prayer,
therefore, in the eye of reason, is an impertinence. The Puritan
theology is not more open to objection on the ground of unreasonableness
than the Catholic theology, or any other which regards man as answerable
to God for his conduct. We must judge of a creed by its effects on
character, as we judge of the wholesomeness of food as it conduces to
bodily health. And the creed which swept like a wave through England at
that time, and recommended itself to the noblest and most powerful
intellects, produced also in those who accepted it a horror of sin, an
enthusiasm for justice, purity, and manliness, which can be paralleled
only in the first age of Christianity. Certainly there never was such a
theory to take man's conceit out of him. He was a miserable wretch, so
worthless at his best as to deserve everlasting perdition. If he was to
be saved at all, he could be saved only by the unmerited grace of God.
In himself he was a child of the devil; and hell, not in metaphor, but
in hard and palpable fact, inevitably waited for him. This belief, or
the affectation of this belief, continues to be professed, but without a
realisation of its tremendous meaning. The form of words is repeated by
multitudes who do not care to think what they are saying. Who can
measure the effect of such a conviction upon men who were in earnest
about their souls, who were assured that this account of their situation
was actually true, and on whom, therefore, it bore with increasing
weight in proportion to their sincerity?

With these few prefatory words, I now return to Bun-yan. He had begun to
go regularly to church, and by church he meant the Church of England.
The change in the constitution of it, even when it came, did not much
alter its practical character in the country districts. At El-stow, as
we have seen, there was still a high place; then was still a liturgy;
there was still a surplice. The Church of England is a compromise
between the old theology and the new. The Bishops have the apostolical
succession, but many of them disbelieve that they derive any virtue from
it. The clergyman is either a priest who can absolve men from sins, or
he is a minister, as in other Protestant communions. The sacraments are
either means of grace or mere outward signs. A Christian is either saved
by baptism or saved by faith, as he pleases to believe. In either case
he may be a member of the Church of England. The effect of such
uncertain utterances is to leave an impression that, in defining such
points closely, theologians are laying down lines of doctrines about
subjects of which they know nothing, that the real truth of religion
lies in what is common to the two theories, the obligation to lead a
moral life; and to this sensible view of their functions the bishops and
clergy had, in fact, gradually arrived in the last century, when the
revival of what is called earnestness, first in the form of
Evangelicalism, and then of Anglo-Catholicism, awoke again the old
controversies.

To a man of fervid temperament suddenly convinced of sin, incapable of
being satisfied with ambiguous answers to questions which mean life or
death to him, the Church of England has little to say. If he is quiet
and reasonable, he finds in it all that he desires. Enthusiastic ages
and enthusiastical temperaments demand something more complete and
consistent. The clergy under the Long Parliament caught partially the
tone of the prevailing spirit. The reading of the *Book of Sports* had
been interdicted, and from their pulpits they lectured their
congregations on the ungodliness of the Sabbath amusements. But the
congregations were slow to listen, and the sports went on.

One Sunday morning, when Bunyan was at church with his wife, a sermon
was delivered on this subject. It seemed to be especially addressed to
himself, and it much affected him. He shook off the impression, and
after dinner he went as usual to the green. He was on the point of
striking at a ball when the thought rushed across his mind, Wilt thou
leave thy sins and go to heaven, or have thy sins and go to hell? He
looked up. The reflection of his own emotion was before him in visible
form He imagined that he saw Christ himself looking down at him from the
sky. But he concluded that it was too late for him to repent. He was
past pardon. He was sure to be damned, and he might as well be damned
for many sins as for few. Sin, at all events, was pleasant, the only
pleasant thing that he knew; therefore he would take his fill of it. The
sin was the game, and nothing but the game. He continued to play, but
the Puritan sensitiveness had taken hold of him. An artificial offence
had become a real offence when his conscience was wounded by it. He was
reckless and desperate.

"This temptation of the devil," he says, "is more usual among poor
creatures than many are aware of. It continued with me about a month or
more; but one day, as I was standing at a neighbour's shop-window, and
there cursing and swearing after my wonted manner, there sat within the
woman of the house and heard me, who, though she was a loose and ungodly
wretch, protested that I swore and cursed at such a rate that she
trembled to hear me. I was able to spoil all the youths in a whole town.
At this reproof I was silenced and put to secret shame, and that too, as
I thought, before the God of heaven. I stood hanging down my head, and
wishing that I might be a little child, that my father might learn me to
speak without this wicked sin of swearing; for, thought I, I am so
accustomed to it that it is vain to think of a reformation."

These words have been sometimes taken as a reflection on Bunyan's own
father, as if he had not sufficiently checked the first symptoms of a
bad habit. If this was so, too much may be easily made of it. The
language in the homes of ignorant workmen is seldom select. They have
not a large vocabulary, and the words which they use do not mean what
they seem to mean. But so sharp and sudden remorse speaks remarkably for
Bunyan himself. At this time he could have been barely twenty years old,
and already he was quick to see when he was doing wrong, to be sorry for
it, and to wish that he could do better. Vain the effort seemed to him,
yet from that moment "he did leave off swearing, to his own great
wonder;" and he found "that he could speak better and more pleasantly
than he did before."

It lies in the nature of human advance on the road of improvement, that,
whatever be a man's occupation, be it handicraft, or art, or knowledge,
or moral conquest of self, at each forward step which he takes he grows
more conscious of his shortcomings. It is thus with his whole career,
and those who rise highest are least satisfied with themselves. Very
simply Bunyan tells the story of his progress. On his outward history,
on his business and his fortunes with it, he is totally silent. Worldly
interests were not worth mentioning. He is solely occupied with his
rescue from spiritual perdition. Soon after he had profited by the
woman's rebuke, he fell in "with a poor man that made profession of
religion and talked pleasantly of the Scriptures." Earnestness in such
matters was growing common among English labourers. Under his new
friend's example, Bunyan "betook him to the Bible, and began to take
great pleasure in reading it," but especially, as he admits frankly (and
most people's experience will have been the same), "the historical part;
for as for St. Paul's Epistles and Scriptures of that nature, he could
not away with them, being as yet ignorant of the corruption of his
nature, or of the want and worth of Jesus Christ to save him."

Not as yet understanding these mysteries, he set himself to reform his
life. He became strict with himself in word and deed. "He set the
Commandments before him for his way to heaven." "He thought if he could
but keep them pretty well he should have comfort." If now and then he
broke one of them, he suffered in conscience; he repented of his fault;
he made good resolutions for the future, and straggled to carry them out
"His neighbours took him to be a new man, and marvelled at the
alteration." Pleasure of any kind, even the most innocent, he considered
to be a snare to him, and he abandoned it. He had been fond of dancing,
but he gave it up. Music and singing he parted with, though it
distressed him to leave them. Of all amusements, that in which he had
most delighted had been in ringing the bells in Elstow church tower.
With his bells he could not part all at once. He would no longer ring
himself: but when his friends were enjoying themselves with the ropes,
he could not help going now and then to the tower door to look on and
listen; but he feared at last that the steeple might fall upon him and
kill him. We call such scruples in these days exaggerated and fantastic.
We are no longer in danger ourselves of suffering from similar emotions.
Whether we are the better for having got rid of them will be seen in the
future history of our race.

Notwithstanding his struggles and his sacrifices, Bunyan found that they
did not bring him the peace which he expected. A man can change his
outward conduct; but if he is in earnest, he comes in sight of other
features in himself which he cannot change so easily--the meannesses,
the paltrinesses, the selfishnesses which haunt him in spite of himself,
which start out upon him at moments the most unlooked for, which taint
the best of his actions and make him loathe and hate himself. Bunyan's
life was now, for so young a person, a model of correctness; but he had
no sooner brought his actions straight than he discovered that he was
admiring and approving of himself. No situation is more humiliating,
none brings with it a feeling of more entire hopelessness. "All this
while," he says, "I knew not Christ, nor grace, nor faith, nor hope; and
had I then died, my state had been most fearful. I was but a poor
painted hypocrite, going about to establish my own righteousness."

Like his own Pilgrim, he had the burden on his back of his conscious
unworthiness. How was he to be rid of it?

"One day, in a street in Bedford, as he was at work in his calling, he
fell in with three or four poor women sitting at a door in the sun
talking about the things of God." He was himself at that time "a brisk
talker" about the matters of religion, and he joined these women. Their
expressions were wholly unintelligible to him. "They were speaking of
the wretchedness of their own hearts, of their unbelief, of their
miserable state. They did contemn, slight, and abhor their own
righteousness as filthy and insufficient to do them any good. They spoke
of a new birth and of the work of God in their hearts, which comforted
and strengthened them against the temptations of the devil."

The language of the poor women has lost its old meaning. They
themselves, if they were alive, would not use it any longer. The
conventional phrases of Evangelical Christianity ring untrue in a modern
ear like a cracked bell. We have grown so accustomed to them as a cant,
that we can hardly believe that they ever stood for sincere convictions.
Yet these forms were once alive with the profoundest of all moral
truths--a truth not of a narrow theology, but which lies at the very
bottom of the well, at the fountain-head of human morality; namely, that
a man who would work out his salvation must cast out self, though he
rend his heart-strings in doing it; not love of self-indulgence only,
but self-applause, self-confidence, self-conceit and vanity, desire or
expectation of reward; self in all the subtle ingenuities with which it
winds about the soul. In one dialect or another, he must recognize that
he is himself a poor creature not worth thinking of, or he will not take
the first step towards excellence in any single thing which he
undertakes.

Bunyan left the women and went about his work, but their talk went with
him. "He was greatly affected." "He saw that he wanted the true tokens
of a godly man." He sought them out, and spoke with them again and
again. He could not stay away; and the more he went, the more he
questioned his condition.

"I found two things," he says, "at which I did some-limes marvel,
considering what a blind, ungodly wretch but just before I was; one, a
great softness and tenderness of heart, which caused me to fall under
the conviction of what, by Scripture, they asserted; the other, a great
bending of my mind to a continual meditating on it. My mind was now like
a horse-leech at the vein, still crying, Give, give; so fixed on
eternity and on the kingdom of heaven (though I knew but little), that
neither pleasure, nor profit, nor persuasion, nor threats could loosen
it or make it let go its hold. It is in very deed a certain truth; it
would have been then as difficult for me to have taken my mind from
heaven to earth, as I have found it often since to get it from earth to
heaven."

Ordinary persons who are conscious of trying to do right, who resist
temptations, are sorry when they slip, and determine to be more on their
guard for the future, are well contented with the condition which they
have reached. They are respectable; they are right-minded in common
things; they fulfil their every-day duties to their families and to
society with a sufficiency for which the world speaks well of them, as
indeed it ought to speak; and they themselves acquiesce in the world's
verdict. Any passionate agitation about the state of their souls they
consider unreal and affected. Such men may be amiable in private life,
good neighbours, and useful citizens; but be their talents what they
may, they could not write a *Pilgrim's Progress,* or ever reach the
Delectable Mountains, or even be conscious that such mountains exist.

Bunyan was on the threshold of the higher life. He knew that he was a
very poor creature. He longed to rise to something better. He was a mere
ignorant, untaught mechanic. He had not been to school with Aristotle
and Plato. He could not help himself, or lose himself in the
speculations of poets and philosophers. He had only the Bible, and,
studying the Bible, he found that the wonder-working power in man's
nature was Faith. Faith! What was it? What did it mean? Had he faith? He
was but "a poor sot," and yet he thought that he could not be wholly
without it. The Bible told him that if he had faith as a grain of
mustard-seed, he could work miracles. He did not understand Oriental
metaphors; here was a simple test which could be at once applied.

"One day," he writes, "as I was between Elstow and Bedford, the
temptation was hot upon me to try if I had faith by doing some miracle.
I must say to the puddles that were in the horse-pads, "be dry," and
truly at one time I was agoing to say so indeed. But just as I was about
to speak, the thought came into my mind: Go under yonder hedge first and
pray that God would make you able. But when I had concluded to pray,
this came hot upon me, that if I prayed and came again and tried to do
it, and yet did nothing notwithstanding, then be sure I had no faith,
but was a castaway, and lost. Nay, thought I, if it be so, I will never
try it yet, but will stay a little longer. Thus was I tossed between the
devil and my own ignorance, and so perplexed at some times that I could
not tell what to do."

Common-sense will call this disease, and will think impatiently that the
young tinker would have done better to attend to his business. But it
must be observed that Bunyan was attending to his business, toiling all
the while with grimed hands over his pots and kettles. No one ever
complained that the pots and kettles were ill-mended. It was merely
that, being simple-minded, he found in his Bible that, besides earning
his bread, he had to save or lose his soul. Having no other guide, he
took its words literally, and the directions puzzled him.

He grew more and more unhappy, more lowly in his own eyes--

"Wishing him like to those more rich in hope"--

like the women who were so far beyond him on the heavenly road. He was a
poet without knowing it, and his gifts only served to perplex him
further. His speculations assumed bodily forms which he supposed to be
actual visions. He saw his poor friends sitting on the sunny side of a
high mountain refreshing themselves in the warmth, while he was
shivering in frost, and snow, and mist. The mountain was surrounded by a
wall, through which he tried to pass, and searched long in vain for an
opening through it. At last he found one, very straight and narrow,
through which he struggled, after desperate efforts. "It showed him," he
said, "that none could enter into life but those who were in downright
earnest, and unless they left the wicked world behind them; for here was
only room for body and soul, but not for body and soul and sin." The
vision brought him no comfort, for it passed away, and left him still on
the wrong side: a little comfortable self-conceit would have set him at
rest. But, like all real men, Bunyan had the worst opinion of himself.
He looked at his Bible again. He found that he must be elected. Was he
elected? He could as little tell as whether he had faith. He knew that
he longed to be elected, but "the Scripture trampled on his desire;" for
it said, "It is not of him that willeth, or of him that run-neth, but of
God that sheweth mercy;" therefore, unless God had chosen him, his
labour was in vain. The devil saw his opportunity; the devil, among his
other attributes, must have possessed that of omnipresence; for whenever
any human soul was in straits, he was personally at hand to take
advantage of it.

"It may be that you are not elected," the tempter said to Bunyan. "It
may be so indeed," thought he. "Why, then," said Satan, "you had as good
leave off and strive no farther; for if, indeed, you should not be
elected and chosen of God, there is no talk of your being saved."

A comforting text suggested itself. "Look at the generations of old; did
any ever trust in the Lord and was confounded?" But these exact words,
unfortunately, were only to be found in the Apocrypha. And there was a
further distressing possibility, which has occurred to others besides
Bunyan. Perhaps the day of grace was passed. It came on him one day as
he walked in the country that perhaps those good people in Bedford were
all that the Lord would save in those parts, and that he came too late
for the blessing. True, Christ had said, "Compel them to come in, for
yet there is room." It might be "that when Christ spoke those words," He
was thinking of him --him among the rest that he had chosen, and had
mean to encourage him. But Bunyan was too simply modest to gather
comfort from such aspiring thoughts. He do sired to be converted, craved
for it, longed for it with all his heart and soul. "Could it have been
gotten for gold," he said, "what would I not have given for it! Had I
had a whole world it had all gone ten thousand times over for this, that
my soul might have been in a converted state. But, oh! I was made sick
by that saying of Christ: 'He called to Him whom He would, and they came
to Him.' I feared He would not call me."

Election, conversion, day of grace, coming to Christ, have been pawed
and fingered by unctuous hands for now two hundred years. The bloom is
gone from the flower. The plumage, once shining with hues direct from
heaven, is soiled and bedraggled. The most solemn of all realities have
been degraded into the passwords of technical theology. In Bunyan's day,
in camp and council chamber, in High Courts of Parliament, and among the
poor drudges in English villages, they were still radiant with spiritual
meaning. The dialect may alter; but if man is more than a brief floating
bubble on the eternal river of time; if there be really an immortal part
of him which need not perish; and if his business on earth is to save it

the mountain gate fly wide which leads to conquest of self. There is
still no passage there for "body and soul and sin."
