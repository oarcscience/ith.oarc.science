## <span style="font-weight: 400">"THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS."</span>

IF *The Holy War* is an unfit subject for allegorical treatment, *The
Pilgrim's Progress* is no less perfectly adapted for it. *The Holy War*
is a representation of the struggle of human nature with evil, and the
struggle is left undecided. *The Pilgrim's Progress* is a representation
of the efforts of a single soul after holiness, which has its natural
termination when the soul quits its mortal home and crosses the dark
river. Each one of us has his own life-battle to fight out, his own
sorrows and trials, his own failures or successes, and his own end. He
wins the game, or he loses it. The account is wound up, and the curtain
falls upon him. Here Bunyan had a material as excellent in itself as it
was exactly suited to his peculiar genius; and his treatment of the
subject from his own point of view--that of English Protestant
Christianity-- is unequalled, and never will be equalled. I may say
never, for in this world of change the point of view alters fast, and
never continues in one stay. As we are swept along the stream of time,
lights and shadows shift their places, mountain plateaus turn to sharp
peaks, mountain ranges dissolve into vapour. The river which has been
gliding deep and slow along the plain, leaps suddenly over a precipice
and plunges foaming down a sunless gorge.

In the midst of changing circumstances the central question remains the
same--What am I? what is this world, in which I appear and disappear
like a bubble? who made me? and what am I to do? Some answer or other
the mind of man demands and insists on receiving. Theologian or poet
offers, at long intervals, explanations which are accepted as credible
for a time. They wear out, and another follows, and then another.
Bunyan's answer has served average English men and women for two hundred
years, but no human being with Bunyan's intellect and Bunyan's sincerity
can again use similar language; and *The Pilgrim's Progress* is and will
remain unique of its kind--an imperishable monument of the form in which
the problem presented itself to a person of singular truthfulness,
simplicity, and piety, who, after many struggles, accepted the Puritan
creed as the adequate solution of it. It was composed exactly at the
time when it was possible for such a book to come into being--the close
of the period when the Puritan formula was a real belief, and was about
to change from a living principle into an intellectual opinion. So long
as a religion is fully alive, men do not talk about it or make
allegories about it. They assume its truth as out of reach of question,
and they simply obey its precepts as they obey the law of the land. It
becomes a subject of art and discourse only when men are unconsciously
ceasing to believe, and therefore the more vehemently think that they
believe, and repudiate with indignation the suggestion that doubt has
found its way into them. After this, religion no longer governs their
lives. It governs only the language in which they express themselves,
and they preserve it eagerly, in the shape of elaborate observances or
in the agreeable forms of art and literature.

*The Pilgrim's Progress* was written before *The Holy War,* while Bunyan
was still in prison at Bedford, and was but half conscious of the gifts
which he possessed. It was written for his own entertainment, and
therefore without the thought--so fatal in its effects and so hard to be
resisted--of what the world would say about it. It was written in
compulsory quiet, when he was comparatively unexcited by the effort of
perpetual preaching, and the shapes of things could present themselves
to him as they really were, undistorted by theological narrowness. It is
the same story which he has told of himself in *Grace Abounding,* thrown
out into an objective form.

He tells us himself, in a metrical introduction, the circumstances under
which it was composed:--

        "When at the first I took my pen in hand,  
        Thus for to write, I did not understand  
        That I at all should make a little book  
        In such a mode. Nay, I had undertook  
        To make another, which when almost done,  
        Before I was aware I this begun.

        "And thus it was: I writing of the way  
        And race of saints in this our Gospel day,  
        Fell suddenly into an Allegory  
        About the journey and the way to glory  
        In more than twenty things which I set down;  
        This done, I twenty more had in my crown,  
        And these again began to multiply,  
        Like sparks that from the coals of fire do fly.  
        Nay then, thought I, if that you breed so fast,  
        I'll put you by yourselves, lest you at last  
        Should prove *ad Infinitum,* and eat out  
        The book that I already am about.

*       * "Well, so I did; but yet I did not think  
        To show to all the world my pen and ink  
        In such a mode. I only thought to make,  
        I knew not what. Nor did I undertake  
        Merely to please my neighbours; no, not I.  
        I did it mine own self to gratify.

        "Neither did I but vacant seasons spend  
        In this my scribble; nor did I intend  
        But to divert myself in doing this  
        From worser thoughts which make me do amiss.  
        Thus I set pen to paper with delight,  
        And quickly had my thoughts in black and white;  
        For having now my method by the end,  
        Still as I pulled it came; and so I penned  
        It down: until at last it came to be  
        For length and breadth the bigness which you see.

        "Well, when I had thus put my ends together,  
        I showed them others, that I might see whether  
        They would condemn them or them justify.  
        And some said, Let them live; some, Let them die;  
        Some said, John, print it; others said, Not so;  
        Some said it might do good; others said, No.

        "Now was I in a strait, and did not see  
        Which was the best thing to be done by me.  
        At last I thought, since you are thus divided,  
        I print it will; and so the case decided."

The difference of opinion among Bunyan's friends is easily explicable.
The allegoric representation of religion to men profoundly convinced of
the truth of it might naturally seem light and fantastic, and the
breadth of the conception could not please the narrow sectarians who
knew no salvation beyond the lines of their peculiar formulas. The
Pilgrim, though in a Puritan dress, is a genuine man. His experience is
so truly human experience, that Christians of every persuasion can
identify themselves with him; and even those who regard Christianity
itself as but a natural outgrowth of the conscience and intellect, and
yet desire to live nobly and make the best of themselves, can recognise
familiar footprints in every step of Christian's journey. Thus *The
Pilgrim's Progress* is a book which, when once read, can never be
forgotten. We too, every one of us, are pilgrims on the same road, and
images and illustrations come back upon us from so faithful an
itinerary, as we encounter similar trials, and learn for ourselves the
accuracy with which Bunyan has described them. There is no occasion to
follow a story minutely which memory can so universally supply. I need
pause only at a few spots which are too charming to pass by.

How picturesque and vivid are the opening lines: "As I walked through
the wilderness of this world I lighted on a certain place where there
was a den,\[<a href="#foot1" id="text1">1</a>\] and I laid me down in
that place to sleep, and as I slept I dreamed a dream. I dreamed, and
behold I saw a man, a man clothed in rags, standing with his face from
his own home with a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back."

The man is Bunyan himself as we see him in *Grace Abounding.* His sins
are the burden upon his back. He reads his book and weeps and trembles.
He speaks of his fears to his friends and kindred. They think "some
frenzy distemper has got into his head." He meets a man in the fields
whose name is Evangelist. Evangelist tells him to flee from the City of
Destruction. He shows him the way by which he must go, and points to the
far-off light which will guide him to the wicket-gate. He sets off, and
his neighbours of course think him mad. The world always thinks men mad
who turn their backs upon it. Obstinate and Pliable (how well we know
them both!) follow to persuade him to return. Obstinate talks practical
common sense to him, and, as it has no effect, gives him up as a
fantastical fellow. Pliable thinks that there may be something in what
he says, and offers to go with him.

Before they can reach the wicket-gate they fall into a "miry slough."
Who does not know the miry slough too? When a man begins for the first
time to think seriously about himself, the first thing that *rises,*
before him is a consciousness of his miserable past life. Amendment
seems to be desperate. He thinks it is too late to change for any useful
purpose, and he sinks into despondency.

Pliable, finding the road disagreeable, has soon had enough of it. He
scrambles out of the slough "on the side which was nearest to his own
house" and goes home. Christian, struggling manfully, is lifted out "by
a man whose name was Help," and goes on upon his journey, but the burden
on his back weighs him down. He falls in with Mr. Worldly Wiseman, who
lives in the town of Carnal Policy. Mr. Worldly Wiseman, who looks like
a gentleman, advises him not to think about his sins. If he has done
wrong he must alter his life and do better for the future. He directs
him to a village called Morality, where he will find a gentleman well
known in those parts, who will take his burden off--Mr. Legality. Either
Mr. Legality will do it himself, or it can be done equally well by his
pretty young son, Mr. Civility.

Tbe way to a better life does not lie in a change of outward action, but
in a changed heart. Legality soon passes into civility, according to the
saying that vice loses half its evil when it loses its grossness. Bunyan
would have said that the poison was the more deadly from being
concealed. Christian, after a near escape, is set straight again. He is
admitted into the wicket-gate, and is directed how he is to go forward.
He asks if he may not lose his way. He is answered Yes, "There are many
ways (that) butt down on this, and they are crooked and wide. But thus
thou mayest know the right from the wrong, that only being straight and
narrow."

Good people often suppose that when a man is once "converted," as they
call it, and has entered on a religious life, he will find everything
made easy. He has turned to Christ, and in Christ he will find rest and
pleasantness. The path of duty is unfortunately not strewed with flowers
at all. The primrose road leads to the other place. As on all other
journeys, to persevere is the difficulty. The pilgrim's feet grow sorer
the longer he walks. His lower nature follows him like a shadow,
watching opportunities to trip him up, and ever appearing in some new
disguise. In the way of comfort he is allowed only certain
resting-places, quiet intervals of peace when temptation is absent, and
the mind can gather strength and encouragement from a sense of the
progress which it has made.

The first of these resting-places at which Christian arrives is the
"Interpreter's House." This means, I conceive, that he arrives at a
right understanding of the objects of human desire as they really are.
He learns to distinguish there between passion and patience, passion
which demands immediate gratification, and patience which can wait and
hope. He sees the action of grace on the heart, and sees the devil
labouring to put it out. He sees the man in the iron cage who was once a
flourishing professor, but had been tempted away by pleasure and had
sinned

against light. He hears a dream too--one of Bunyan's own early dreams,
but related as by another person. The Pilgrim himself was beyond the
reach of such uneasy visions. But it shows how profoundly the terrible
side of Christianity had seized on Bunyan's imagination, and how little
he was able to forget it.

"This night as I was in my sleep I dreamed, and behold the heavens grew
exceeding black; also it thundered and lightened in most fearful wise,
that it put me into an agony; so I looked up in my dream and saw the
clouds rack at an unusual rate, upon which I heard a great sound of a
trumpet, and saw also a man sit upon a cloud attended with the thousands
of heaven. They were all in a flaming fire, and the heaven also was in a
burning flame. I heard then a voice, saying, Arise ye dead and come to
judgment; and with that the rocks rent, the graves opened, and the dead
that were therein came forth. Some of them were exceeding glad and
looked upward; some sought to hide themselves under the mountains. Then
I saw the man that sate upon the cloud open the book and bid the world
draw near. Yet there was, by reason of a fierce flame that issued out
and came from before him, a convenient distance betwixt him and them, as
betwixt the judge and the prisoners at the bar. I heard it also
proclaimed to them that attended on the man that sate on the cloud,
Gather together the tares, the chaff, and the stubble, and cast them
into the burning lake. And with that the bottomless pit opened just
whereabouts I stood, out of the mouth of which there came in an abundant
manner smoke and coals of fire with hideous noises. It was also said to
the same persons, Gather the wheat into my garner. And with that I saw
many catched up and carried away into the clouds, but I was left behind.
I also sought to hide myself, but I could not, for the man that sate
upon the cloud still kept his eye upon me. My sins also came into my
mind, and my conscience did accuse me on every side. I thought the day
of judgment was come, and I was not ready for it."

The resting-time comes to an end. The Pilgrim gathers himself together,
and proceeds upon his way. He is not to be burdened for ever with the
sense of his sins. It fell from off his back at the sight of the cross.
Three shining ones appear and tell him that his sins are forgiven; they
take off his rags and provide him with a new suit.

He now encounters fellow-travellers; and the seriousness of the story is
relieved by adventures and humorous conversations. At the bottom of a
hill he finds three gentlemen asleep, "a little out of the way." These
were Simple, Sloth, and Presumption. He tries to rouse them, but does
not succeed. Presently two others are seen tumbling over the wall into
the Narrow Way. They are come from the land of Vain Glory, and are
called Formalist and Hypocrisy. Like the Pilgrim, they are bound for
Mount Zion; but the wicket-gate was "too far about," and they had come
by a short cut. "They had custom for it a thousand years and more; and
custom being of so long standing, would be admitted legal by any
impartial judge." Whether right or wrong, they insist that they are in
the way, and no more is to be said. But they are soon out of it again.
The hill is the hill Difficulty, and the road parts into three. Two go
round the bottom, as modern engineers would make them. The other rises
straight over the top. Formalist and Hypocrisy choose the easy ways, and
are heard of no more. Pilgrim climbs up, and after various accidents
comes to the second resting-place, the Palace Beautiful, built by the
Lord of the Hill to entertain strangers in. The recollections of Sir
Bevis, of Southampton, furnished Bunyan with his framework. Lions guard
the court. Fair ladies entertain him as if he had been a knight-errant
in quest of the Holy Grail. The ladies, of course, are all that they
ought to be: the Christian graces --Discretion, Prudence, Piety, and
Charity. He tells them his history. They ask him if he has brought none
of his old belongings with him. He answers Yes, but greatly against his
will: his inward and carnal cogitations, with which his countrymen, as
well as himself, were so much delighted. Only in golden hours they
seemed to leave him. Who cannot recognise the truth of this? Who has not
groaned over the follies and idiotcies that cling to us like the
doggerel verses that hang about our memories? The room in which he
sleeps is called Peace. In the morning he is shown the curiosities,
chiefly Scripture relics, in the palace. He is taken to the roof, from
which he sees far off the outlines of the Delectable Mountains. Next,
the ladies carry him to the armoury, and equip him for the dangers which
lie next before him. He is to go down into the Valley of Humiliation,
and pass thence through the Valley of the Shadow of Death.

Bunyan here shows the finest insight. To some pilgrims the Valley of
Humiliation was the pleasantest part of the journey. Mr. Feeblemind, in
the second part of the story, was happier there than anywhere. But
Christian is Bunyan himself; and Bunyan had a stiff, self-willed nature,
and had found his spirit the most stubborn part of him. Down here he
encounters Apollyon himself, "straddling quite over the whole breadth of
the way"--a more effective devil than the Diabolus of *The Holy War.* He
fights him for half a day, is sorely wounded in head, hand, and foot,
and has a near escape of being pressed to death.

Apollyon spreads his bat wings at last, and flies away; but there
remains the Valley of the Shadow of Death, the dark scene of lonely
horrors. Two men meet him on the borders of it. They tell him the valley
is full of spectres; and they warn him, if he values his life, to go
back. Well Bunyan knew these spectres, those dreary misgivings that he
was toiling after an illusion; that "good" and "evil" had no meaning
except on earth, and for man's convenience; and that he himself was but
a creature of a day, allowed a brief season of what is called existence,
and then to pass away and be as if he had never been. It speaks well for
Bunyan's honesty that this state of mind, which religious people
generally call wicked, is placed directly in his Pilgrim's path, and he
is compelled to pass through it. In the valley, close at the road-side,
there is a pit, which is one of the mouths of hell. A wicked spirit
whispers to him as he goes by. He imagines that the thought had
proceeded out of his own heart.

The sky clears when he is beyond the gorge. Outside it are the caves
where the two giants, Pope and Pagan, had lived in old times. Pagan had
been dead many a day. Pope was still living, "but he had grown so crazy
and stiff in his joints that he could now do little more than sit in his
cave's mouth, grinning at pilgrims as they went by, and biting his nails
because he could not come at them."

Here he overtakes Faithful, a true pilgrim like himself. Faithful had
met with trials; but his trials have not resembled Christian's.
Christian's difficulties, like Bunyan's own, had been all spiritual.
"The lusts of the flesh" seem to have had no attraction for him.
Faithful had been assailed by Wanton, and had been obliged to fly from
her. He had not fallen into the slough; but he had been beguiled by the
Old Adam, who offered him one of his daughters for a wife. In the Valley
of the Shadow of Death he had found sunshine all the way. Doubts about
the truth of religion had never troubled the simpler nature of the good
Faithful.

Mr. Talkative is the next character introduced, and is one of the best
figures which Bunyan has drawn; Mr. Talkative, with Scripture at his
fingers' ends, and perfect master of all doctrinal subtleties, ready "to
talk of things heavenly or things earthly, things moral or things
evangelical, things sacred or things profane, things past or things to
come, things foreign or things at home, things essential or things
circumstantial, provided that all be done to our profit."

This gentleman would have taken in Faithful, who was awed by such a rush
of volubility. Christian has seen him before, knows him well, and can
describe him. "He is the son of one Saywell. He dwelt in Prating Row. He
is for any company and for any talk. As he talks now with you, so will
he talk when on the ale-bench. The more drink he hath in his crown, the
more of these things he hath in his mouth. Religion hath no place in his
heart, or home, or conversation; all that he hath lieth in his tongue,
and his religion is to make a noise therewith." The elect, though they
have ceased to be of the world, are still in the world. They are still
part of the general community of mankind, and share, whether they like
it or not, in the ordinary activities of life. Faithful and Christian
have left the City of Destruction. They have shaken off from themselves
all liking for idle pleasures. They nevertheless find themselves in
their journey at Yanity Fair, "a fair set up by Beelzebub 5000 years
ago." Trade of all sorts went on at Vanity Fair, and people of all sorts
were collected there: cheats, fools, asses, knaves, and rogues. Some
were honest, many were dishonest; some lived peaceably and uprightly,
others robbed, murdered, seduced their neighbours' wives, or lied and
perjured themselves. Vanity Fair was European society as it existed in
the days of Charles II. Each nation was represented. There was British
Row, French Row, and Spanish Row. "The wares of Rome and her merchandise
were greatly promoted at the fair, only the English nation, with some
others, had taken a dislike to them." The pilgrims appear on the scene
as the Apostles appeared at Antioch and Rome, to tell the people that
there were things in the world of more consequence than money and
pleasure. The better sort listen. Public opinion in general calls them
fools and Bedlamites. The fair becomes excited, disturbances are feared,
and the authorities send to make inquiries. Authorities naturally
disapprove of novelties; and Christian and Faithful are arrested,
beaten, and put in the cage. Their friends insist that they have done no
harm, that they are innocent strangers teaching only what will make men
better instead of worse. A riot follows. The authorities determine to
make an example of them, and the result is the ever-memorable trial of
the two pilgrims. They are brought in irons before my Lord Hate-good,
charged with "disturbing the trade of the town, creating divisions, and
making converts to their opinions in contempt of the law of the Prince."

Faithful begins with an admission which would have made it difficult for
Hategood to let him off, for he says that the Prince they talked of,
being Beelzebub, the enemy of the Lord, he defied him and all his
angels. Three witnesses were then called: Envy, Superstition, and
Pick-thank.

Envy says that Faithful regards neither prince nor people, but does all
he can to possess men with disloyal notions, which he calls principles
of faith and holiness.

Superstition says that he knows little of him, but has heard him say
that "our religion is naught, and such by which no man can please God,
from which saying his Lordship well knows will follow that we are yet in
our sins, and finally shall be damned."

Pickthank deposes that he has heard Faithful rail on Beelzebub, and
speak contemptuously of his honourable friends my Lord Old Man, my Lord
Carnal Delight, my Lord Luxurious, my Lord Desire of Vain Glory, my Lord
Lechery, Sir Having Greedy, and the rest of the nobility, besides which
he has railed against his lordship on the bench himself, calling him an
ungodly villain.

The evidence was perfectly true, and the prisoner, when called on for
his defence, confirmed it. He says (avoiding the terms in which he was
said to rail, and the like) that "the Prince of the town, with all the
rabblement of his attendants by this gentleman named, are more fit for a
being in hell than in this town or country."

Lord Hategood has been supposed to have been drawn from one or other of
Charles II.'s judges, perhaps from either Twisden or Chester, who had
the conversation with Bunyan's wife. But it is difficult to see how
either one or the other could have acted otherwise than they did.
Faithful might be quite right. Hell might be, and probably was, the
proper place for Beelzebub, and for all persons holding authority under
him. But as a matter of fact, a form of society did for some purpose or
other exist, and had been permitted to exist for 5000 years, owning
Beelzebub's sovereignty. It must defend itself, or must cease to be, and
it could not be expected to make no effort at self-preservation.
Faithful had come to Vanity Fair to make a revolution--a revolution
extremely desirable, but one which it was unreasonable to expect the
constituted authorities to allow to go forward. It was not a case of
false witness. A prisoner who admits that he has taught the people that
their Prince ought to be in hell, and has called the judge an ungodly
villain, cannot complain if he is accused of preaching rebellion.

Lord Hategood charges the jury, and explains the law. "There was an Act
made," he says, "in the days of Pharaoh the Great, servant to our
Prince, that lest those of a contrary religion should multiply and grow
too strong for him, their males should be thrown into the river. There
was also an Act made in the days of Nebuchadnezzar the Great, that
whoever would not fall down and worship his golden image should be
thrown into a fiery furnace. There was also an Act made in the days of
Darius that whoso for some time called upon any God but him should be
cast into the lion's den. Now the substance of these laws this rebel
hath broken, not only in thought (which is not to be borne), but also in
word and deed, which must, therefore, be intolerable. For that of
Pharaoh, his law was made upon a supposition to prevent mischief, no
crime being yet apparent. For the second and third you see his
disputations against our religion, and for the treason he hath confessed
he deserveth to die the death."

"Then went the jury out, whose names were Mr. Blind-man, Mr. Nogood, Mr.
Malice, Mr. Lovelust, Mr. Liveloose, Mr. Heady, Mr. Highmind, Mr.
Enmity, Mr. Liar, Mr. Cruelty, Mr. Hatelight, and Mr. Implacable, who
every one gave in his private verdict against him among themselves, and
afterwards unanimously concluded to bring him in guilty before the
judge. And first, Mr. Blindman, the foreman, said: I see clearly that
this man is a heretic. Then said Mr. Nogood, Away with such a fellow
from the earth. Aye, said Mr. Malice, I hate the very looks of him. Then
said Mr. Lovelust, I could never endure him. Nor I, said Mr. Liveloose,
for he would always be condemning my way. Hang him, hang him, said Mr.
Heady. A sorry scrub, said Mr. Highmind. My heart riseth against him,
said Mr. Enmity. He is a rogue, said Mr. Liar. Hanging is too good for
him, said Mr. Cruelty. Let us despatch him out of the way, said Mr.
Hatelight. Then, said Mr. Implacable, might I have all the world given
me, I could not be reconciled to him; therefore, let us forthwith bring
him in guilty of death."

Abstract qualities of character were never clothed in more substantial
flesh and blood than these jurymen. Spenser's knights in the *Fairy
Queen* are mere shadows to them. Faithful was, of course, condemned,
scourged, buffeted, lanced in his feet with knives, stoned, stabbed, at
last burned, and spared the pain of travelling further on the narrow
road. A chariot and horses were waiting to bear him through the clouds,
the nearest way to the Celestial Gate. Christian, who it seems had been
remanded, contrives to escape. He is joined by Hopeful, a convert whom
he has made in the town, and they pursue their journey in company. A
second person is useful dramatically, and Hopeful takes Faithful's
place. Leaving Vanity Fair, they are again on the Pilgrim's road. There
they encounter Mr. Bye-ends. Bye-ends comes from the town of
Plain-Speech, where he has a large kindred, My Lord Turnabout, my Lord
Timeserver, Mr. Facing-both-ways, Mr. Two Tongues, the parson of the
parish. Bye-ends himself was married to a daughter of Lady Feignings.
Bunyan's invention in such things was inexhaustible.

They have more trials of the old kind with which Bunyan himself was so
familiar. They cross the River of Life and even drink at it, yet for all
this, and directly after, they stray into Bye-path Meadow. They lose
themselves in the grounds of Doubting Castle, and are seized upon by
Giant Despair--still a prey to doubt--still uncertain whether religion
be not a dream, even after they have fought with wild beasts in Vanity
Fair and have drunk of the water of life. Nowhere does Bunyan show
better how well he knew the heart of man. Christian even thinks of
killing himself in the dungeons of Doubting Castle. Hopeful cheers him
up; they break their prison, recover the road again, and arrive at the
Delectable Mountains in Emmanuel's own land. There it might be thought
the danger would be over, but it is not so. Even in Emmanuel's Land
there is a door in the side of a hill which is a byeway to hell, and
beyond Emmanuel's Land is the country of conceit, a new and special
temptation for those who think that they are near salvation. Here they
encounter "a brisk lad of the neighbourhood," needed soon after for a
particular purpose, who is a good liver, prays devoutly, fasts
regularly, pays tithes punctually, and hopes that everyone will get to
heaven by the religion which he professes, provided he fears God and
tries to do his duty. The name of this brisk lad is Ignorance. Leaving
him, they are caught in a net by Flatterer, and are smartly whipped by
"a shining one," who lets them out of it. False ideas and vanity lay
them open once more to their most dangerous enemy. They meet a man
coming toward them from the direction in which they are going. They tell
him that they are on the way to Mount Zion. He laughs scornfully, and
answers:--

"There is no such place as you dream of in all the world. When I was at
home in ray own country, I heard as you now affirm, and from hearing I
went out to see; and have been seeking this city these twenty years, but
I find no more of it than I did the first day I went out. I am going
back again, and will seek to refresh myself with. things which I then
cast away for hopes of that which I now see is not."

Still uncertainty--even on the verge of eternity-- strange, doubtless,
and reprehensible to Right Eeverend persons, who never "cast away"
anything; to whom a religious profession has been a highway to pleasure
and preferment, who live in the comfortable assurance that as it has
been in this life so it will be in the next. Only moral obliquity of the
worst kind could admit a doubt about so excellent a religion as this.
But Bunyan was not a Right Reverend. Christianity had brought him no
palaces and large revenues, and a place among the great of the land. If
Christianity was not true, his whole life was folly and illusion, and
the dread that it might be so clung to his belief like its shadow.

The way was still long. The pilgrims reach the Enchanted Ground, and are
drowsy and tired. Ignorance comes up with them again. He talks much
about himself. He tells them of the good motives that come into his mind
and comfort him as he walks. His heart tells him that he has left all
for God and heaven. His belief and his life agree together, and he is
humbly confident that his hopes are well-founded. When they speak to him
of Salvation by Faith and Conviction by Sin, he cannot understand what
they mean. As he leaves them they are reminded of one Temporary, "once a
forward man in religion." Temporary dwelt in Graceless, "a town two
miles from Honesty, next door to one Turnback." He "was going on
pilgrimage, but became acquainted with one Save Self, and was never more
heard of."

These figures all mean something. They correspond in part to Bunyan's
own recollection of his own trials. Partly he is indulging his humour by
describing others who were more astray than he was. It was over at last:
the pilgrims arrive at the land of Beulah, the beautiful sunset after
the storms were all past. Doubting Castle can be seen no more, and
between them and their last rest there remains only the deep river over
which there is no bridge, the river of Death. On the hill beyond the
waters glitter the towers and domes of the Celestial City; but through
the river they must first pass, and they find it deeper or shallower
according to the strength of their faith. They go through, Hopeful
feeling the bottom all along; Christian still in character, not without
some horror, and frightened by hobgoblins. On the other side they are
received by angels, and are carried to their final home, to live for
ever in the Prince's presence. Then follows the only passage which the
present writer reads with regret in this admirable book. It is given to
the self-righteous Ignorance, who, doubtless, had been provoking with
"his good motives that comforted him as he walked;" but Bunyan's zeal
might have been satisfied by inflicting a lighter chastisement upon him.
He comes up to the river: he crosses without the difficulties which
attended Christian and Hopeful. "It happened that there was then at the
place one Vain Hope, a Ferryman, that with his boat" (some viaticum or
priestly absolution) "helped him over." He ascends the hill, and
approaches the city, but no angels are in attendance, "neither did any
man meet him with the least encouragement." Above the gate there was the
verse written--"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may
have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the gate into
the city." Bunyan, who believed that no man could keep the commandments,
and had no right to anything but damnation, must have introduced the
words as if to mock the unhappy wretch who, after all, had tried to keep
the commandments as well as most people, and was seeking admittance,
with a conscience moderately at ease. "He was asked by the men that
looked over the gate--Whence come you, and what would you have?" He
answered, "I have eaten and drunk in the presence of the King, and he
has taught in our street." Then they asked him for his certificate, that
they might go in and show it to the king. So he fumbled in his bosom for
one, and found none. Then said they, "Have you none?" But the man
answered never a word. So they told the king; but he would not come down
to see him, but commanded the two shining ones that conducted Christian
and Hopeful to the city, to go out and take Ignorance and bind him hand
and foot, and have him away. Then they took him up and carried him
through the air to the door in the side of the hill, and put him in
there. "Then," so Bunyan ends, "I saw that there was a way to hell even
from the gates of heaven, as well as from the City of Destruction; so I
awoke, and behold it was a dream!"

Poor Ignorance! Hell--such a place as Bunyan imagined hell to be--was a
hard fate for a miserable mortal who had failed to comprehend the true
conditions of justification. We are not told that he was a vain boaster.
He could not have advanced so near to the door of heaven if he had not
been really a decent man, though vain and silly. Behold, it was a dream!
The dreams which come to us when sleep is deep on the soul may be sent
direct from some revealing power. When we are near waking, the
supernatural insight may be refracted through human theory.

Charity will hope that the vision of Ignorance cast bound into the mouth
of hell, when he was knocking at the gate of heaven, came through
Homer's ivory gate, and that Banyan here was a mistaken interpreter of
the spiritual tradition. The fierce inferences of Puritan theology are
no longer credible to us; yet nobler men than the Puritans are not to be
found in all English history. It will be well if the clearer sight which
enables us to detect their errors enables us also to recognise their
excellence.

The second part of *The Pilgrim's Progress,* like most second parts, is
but a feeble reverberation of the first. It is comforting, no doubt, to
know that Christian's wife and children were not left to their fate in
the City of Destruction. But Bunyan had given us all that he had to tell
about the journey, and we do not need a repetition of it. Of course
there are touches of genius. No writing of Bunyan's could be wholly
without it. But the rough simplicity is gone, and instead of it there is
a tone of sentiment which is almost mawkish. Giants, dragons, and
angelic champions carry us into a spurious fairy-land, where the
knight-errant is a preacher in disguise. Fair ladies and love matches,
however decorously chastened, suit ill with the sternness of the moral
conflict between the soul and sin. Christiana and her children are
tolerated for the pilgrim's sake to whom they belong. Had they appealed
to our interest on their own merits, we would have been contented to
wish them well through their difficulties, and to trouble ourselves no
further about them.
