LITTLE remains to be told of Bunyan's concluding years. No friends
preserved his letters. No diaries of his own survive to gratify
curiosity. Men truly eminent think too meanly of themselves or their
work to care much to be personally remembered. He lived for sixteen
years after his release from the gaol, and those years were spent in the
peaceful discharge of his congregational duties, in writing, in visiting
the scattered members of the Baptist communion, or in preaching in the
villages and woods. His outward circumstances were easy. He had a small
but well-provided house in Bedford, into which he collected rare and
valuable pieces of old furniture and plate, and other
articles--presents, probably, from those who admired him. He visited
London annually to preach in the Baptist churches. *The Pilgrim's
Progress* spread his fame over England, over Europe, and over the
American settlements. It was translated into many languages; and so
catholic was its spirit, that it was adapted with a few alterations for
the use even of the Catholics themselves. He abstained, as he had done
steadily throughout his life, from all interference with politics, and
the Government in turn never again meddled with him. He even received
offers of promotion to larger spheres of action, which might have
tempted a meaner nature. But he could never be induced to leave Bedford,
and there he quietly stayed through changes of ministry, Popish plots,
and Monmouth rebellions, while the terror of a restoration of Popery was
bringing on the Revolution--careless of kings and cabinets, and
confident that Giant Pope had lost his power for harm, and thenceforward
could only bite his nails at the passing pilgrims. Once only, after the
failure of the Exclusion Bill, he seems to have feared that violent
measures might again be tried against him. It is even said that he was
threatened with arrest, and it was on this occasion that he made over
his property to his wife. The policy of James II., however,
transparently treacherous though it was, for the time gave security to
the Nonconformist congregations; and in the years which immediately
preceded the final expulsion of the Stuarts, liberty of conscience was
under fewer restrictions than it had been in the most rigorous days of
the Reformation, or under the Long Parliament itself. Thus the anxiety
passed away, and Bunyan was left undisturbed to finish his earthly work.

He was happy in his family. His blind child, for whom he had been so
touchingly anxious, had died while he was in prison. His other children
lived and did well; and his brave companion, who had spoken so stoutly
for him to the judges, continued at his side. His health, it was said,
had suffered from his confinement; but the only serious illness which we
hear of was an attack of "sweating sickness," which came upon him in
1687, and from which he never thoroughly recovered. He was then
fifty-nine, and in the next year he died.

His end was characteristic. It was brought on by exposure when he was
engaged in an act of charity. A quarrel had broken out in a family at
Reading with which Bunyan had some acquaintance. A father had taken
offence at his son, and threatened to disinherit him. Bunyan undertook a
journey on horseback from Bedford to Reading in the hope of reconciling
them. He succeeded, but at the cost of his life. Returning by London, he
was overtaken on the road by a storm of rain, and was wetted through
before he could find shelter. The chill, falling on a constitution
already weakened by illness, brought on fever. He was able to reach the
house of Mr. Strudwick, one his London friends; but he never left his
bed afterwards. In ten days he was dead. The exact date is uncertain. It
was towards the end of August, 1688, between two and three months before
the landing of King William. He was buried in Mr. Strudwick's vault, in
the Dissenters' burying-ground at Bunhill Fields. His last words were,
"Take me, for I come to Thee."

So ended, at the age of sixty, a man who, if his importance may be
measured by the influence which he has exerted over succeeding
generations, must be counted among the most extraordinary persons whom
England has produced. It has been the fashion to dwell on the
disadvantages of his education, and to regret the carelessness of nature
which brought into existence a man of genius in a tinker's hut at
Elstow. Nature is less partial than she appears, and all situations in
life have their compensations along with them.

Circumstances, I should say, qualified Bunyan perfectly well for the
work which he had to do. If he had gone to school, as he said, with
Aristotle and Plato; if he had been broken in at a university and been
turned into a bishop; if he had been in any one of the learned
professions, he might easily have lost, or might have never known, the
secret of his powers. He was born to be the Poet-apostle of the English
middle classes, imperfectly educated like himself; and, being one of
themselves, he had the key of their thoughts and feelings in his own
heart. Like nine out of ten of his countrymen, he came into the world
with no fortune but his industry. He had to work with his hands for his
bread, and to advance by the side of his neighbours along the road of
common business. His knowledge was scanty, though of rare quality. He
knew his Bible probably by heart. He had studied history in Foxe's
*Martyrs,* but nowhere else that we can trace. The rest of his mental
furniture was gathered at first hand from his conscience, his life, and
his occupations. Thus, every idea which he received falling into a soil
naturally fertile, sprouted up fresh, vigorous, and original. He
confessed to have felt (as a man of his powers could hardly have failed
to feel) continued doubts about the Bible and the reality of the Divine
government. It has been well said that when we look into the world to
find the image of God, it is as if we were to stand before a
looking-glass, expecting to see ourselves reflected there, and to see
nothing. Education scarcely improves our perception in this respect; and
wider information, wider acquaintance with the thoughts of other men in
other ages and countries, might as easily have increased his
difficulties as have assisted him in overcoming them. He was not a man
who could have contented himself with compromises and half-convictions.
No force could have subdued him into a decent Anglican divine--a "Mr.
Two Tongues, parson of the parish." He was passionate and
thorough-going. The authority of conscience presented itself to him only
in the shape of religious obligation. Religion once shaken into a
"perhaps," would have had no existence to him; and it is easy to
conceive a university-bred Bunyan, an intellectual meteor, flaring
uselessly across the sky and disappearing in smoke and nothingness.

Powerful temperaments are necessarily intense. Bunyan, born a tinker,
had heard right and wrong preached to him in the name of the Christian
creed. He concluded after a struggle that Christianity was true, and on
that conviction he built himself up into what he was. It might have been
the same, perhaps, with Burns had he been born a century before. Given
Christianity as an unquestionably true account of the situation and
future prospects of man, the feature of it most appalling to the
imagination is that hell-fire--a torment exceeding the most horrible
which fancy can conceive, and extending into eternity-- awaits the
enormous majority of the human race. The dreadful probability seized
hold on the young Bunyan's mind. He shuddered at it when awake. In the
visions of the night it came before him in the tremendous details of the
dreadful reality. It became the governing thought in his nature.

Such a belief, if it does not drive a man to madness, will at least cure
him of trifling. It will clear his mind of false sentiment, take the
nonsense out of him, and enable him to resist vulgar temptation as
nothing else will. The danger is that the mind may not bear the strain,
that the belief itself may crack and leave nothing. Bunyan was hardly
tried, but in him the belief did not crack. It spread over his
character. It filled him first with terror; then with a loathing of sin,
which entailed so awful a penalty; then, as his personal fears were
allayed by the recognition of Christ, it turned to tenderness and pity.

There was no fanaticism in Bunyan; nothing harsh or savage. His natural
humour perhaps saved him. His few recorded sayings all refer to the one
central question; but healthy seriousness often best expresses itself in
playful quaintness. He was once going somewhere disguised as a waggoner.
He was overtaken by a constable who had a warrant to arrest him. The
constable asked him if he knew that devil of a fellow Bunyan. "Know
him!" Bunyan said. "You might call him a devil if you knew him as well
as I once did."

A Cambridge student was trying to show him what a divine thing reason
was--"reason, the chief glory of man, which distinguished him from a
beast," &c., &c.

Bunyan growled out: "Sin distinguishes man from beast. Is sin divine?"

He was extremely tolerant in his terms of Church membership. He offended
the stricter part of his congregation by refusing even to make infant
baptism a condition of exclusion. The only persons with whom he declined
to communicate were those whose lives were openly immoral. His chief
objection to the Church of England was the admission of the ungodly to
the Sacraments. He hated party titles and quarrels upon trifles. He
desired himself to be called a Christian or a Believer, or "any name
which was approved by the Holy Ghost." Divisions, he said, were to
Churches like wars to countries. Those who talked most about religion
cared least for it; and controversies about doubtful things, and things
of little moment, ate up all zeal for things which were practicable and
indisputable.

"In countenance," wrote a friend, "he appeared to be of a stern and
rough temper, but in his conversation mild and affable; not given to
loquacity or to much discourse in company unless some urgent occasion
required it; observing never to boast of himself or his parts, but
rather to seem low in his own eyes, and submit himself to the judgment
of others; abhorring lying and swearing; being just, in all that lay in
his power, to his word; not seeming to revenge injuries; loving to
reconcile differences and make friendships with all. He had a sharp,
quick eye, with an excellent discerning of persons, being of good
judgment and quick wit." "He was tall of stature, strong-boned, though
not corpulent, somewhat of a ruddy face, with sparkling eyes, wearing
his hair on his upper lip; his hair reddish, but in his later days time
had sprinkled it with grey; his nose well set, but not declining or
bending; his mouth moderate large, his forehead something high, and his
habit always plain and modest."

He was himself indifferent to advancement, and he did not seek it for
his family. A London merchant offered to take his son into his house.
"God," he said, "did not send me to advance my family, but to preach the
Gospel." He had no vanity--an exemption extremely rare in those who are
personally much before the public. The personal popularity was in fact
the part of his situation which he least liked. When he was to preach in
London, "if there was but one day's notice the meeting-house was crowded
to overflowing." Twelve hundred people would be found collected before
seven o'clock on a dark winter's morning to hear a lecture from him. In
Zoar Street, Southwark, his church was sometimes so crowded that he had
to be lifted to the pulpit stairs over the congregation's heads. It
pleased him, but he was on the watch against the pleasure of being
himself admired. A friend complimented him once, after service, on "the
sweet sermon" which he had delivered. "You need not remind me of that,"
he said. "The devil told me of it before I was out of the pulpit."

"Conviction of sin" has become a conventional phrase, shallow and
ineffective even in those who use it most sincerely. Yet moral evil is
still the cause of nine-tenths of the misery in the world, and it is not
easy to measure the value of a man who could prolong the conscious sense
of the deadly nature of it, even tinder the forms of a decomposing
theology. Times are changing. The intellectual current is bearing us we
know not where, and the course of the stream is in a direction which
leads us far from the conclusions in which Bunyan and the Puritans
established themselves; but the truths which are most essential for us
to know cannot be discerned by speculative arguments. Chemistry cannot
tell us why some food is wholesome and other food is poisonous. That
food is best for us which best nourishes the body into health and
strength; and a belief in a Supernatural Power which has given us a law
to live by, and to which we are responsible for our conduct, has alone,
of all the influences known to us, succeeded in ennobling and elevating
the character of man. The particular theories which men have formed
about it have often been wild and extravagant. Imagination, agitated by
fear or stimulated by pious enthusiasm, has peopled heaven with demigods
and saints--creations of fancy, human forms projected upon a mist and
magnified into celestial images. How much is true of all that men have
believed in past times and have now ceased to believe, how much has been
a too eager dream, no one now can tell. It may be that other foundations
may be laid hereafter for human conduct on which an edifice can be
raised no less fair and beautiful; but no signs of it are as yet
apparent.

So far as we yet know, morality rests upon a sense of obligation; and
obligation has no meaning except as implying a Divine command, without
which it would cense to be. Until "duty" can be presented to us in a
shape which will compel our recognition of it with equal or superior
force, the passing away of "the conviction of sin" can operate only to
obscure our aspirations after a high ideal of life and character. The
scientific theory may be correct, and it is possible that we may be
standing on the verge of the most momentous intellectual revolution
which has been experienced in the history of our race. It may be so, and
also it may not be so. It may be that the most important factors in the
scientific equation are beyond the reach of human intellect. However it
be, the meat which gives strength to the man is poison to the child; and
as yet we are still children, and are likely to remain children. "Every
relief from outward restraint," says one who was not given to
superstition, "if it be not attended with increased power of
self-command, is simply fatal." Men of intelligence, therefore, to whom
life is not a theory but a stern fact, conditioned round with endless
possibilities of wrong and suffering, though they may never again adopt
the letter of Bunyan's creed, will continue to see in conscience an
authority for which culture is no substitute; they will conclude that in
one form or other responsibility is not a fiction but a truth; and, so
long as this conviction lasts, *The Pilgrim's Progress* will still be
dear to all men of all creeds who share in it, even though it pleases
the "elect" modern philosophers to describe its author as a "Philistine
of genius."

**THE END.**
