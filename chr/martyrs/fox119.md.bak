# CHAPTER XIX

## An Account of the Life and Persecutions of John Bunyan

This great Puritan was born the same year that the Pilgrim Fathers
landed at Plymouth. His home was Elstow, near Bedford, in England. His
father was a tinker and he was brought up to the same trade. He was a
lively, likeable boy with a serious and almost morbid side to his
nature. All during his young manhood he was repenting for the vices of
his youth and yet he had never been either a drunkard or immoral. The
particular acts that troubled his conscience were dancing, ringing the
church bells, and playing cat. It was while playing the latter game one
day that "a voice did suddenly dart from Heaven into my soul, which
said, 'Wilt thou leave thy sins and go to Heaven, or have thy sins and
go to Hell?'" At about this time he overheard three or four poor women
in Bedford talking, as they sat at the door in the sun. "Their talk was
about the new birth, the work of God in the hearts. They were far above
my reach."

In his youth he was a member of the parliamentary army for a year. The
death of his comrade close beside him deepened his tendency to serious
thoughts, and there were times when he seemed almost insane in his zeal
and penitence. He was at one time quite assured that he had sinned the
unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost. While he was still a young man
he married a good woman who bought him a library of pious books which he
read with assiduity, thus confirming his earnestness and increasing his
love of religious controversies.

His conscience was still further awakened through the persecution of the
religious body of Baptists to whom he had joined himself. Before he was
thirty years old he had become a leading Baptist preacher.

Then came his turn for persecution. He was arrested for preaching
without license. "Before I went down to the justice, I begged of God
that His will be done; for I was not without hopes that my imprisonment
might be an awakening to the saints in the country. Only in that matter
did I commit the thing to God. And verily at my return I did meet my God
sweetly in the prison."

His hardships were genuine, on account of the wretched condition of the
prisons of those days. To this confinement was added the personal grief
of being parted from his young and second wife and four small children,
and particularly, his little blind daughter. While he was in jail he was
solaced by the two books which he had brought with him, the Bible and
Fox's "Book of Martyrs."

Although he wrote some of his early books during this long imprisonment,
it was not until his second and shorter one, three years after the
first, that he composed his immortal "Pilgrim's Progress," which was
published three years later. In an earlier tract he had thought briefly
of the similarity between human life and a pilgrimage, and he now worked
this theme out in fascinating detail, using the rural scenery of England
for his background, the splendid city of London for his Vanity Fair, and
the saints and villains of his own personal acquaintance for the finely
drawn characters of his allegory.

The "Pilgrim's Progress" is truly the rehearsal of Bunyan's own
spiritual experiences. He himself had been the 'man cloathed in Rags,
with his Face from his own House, a Book in his hand, and a great Burden
upon his Back.' After he had realized that Christ was his Righteousness,
and that this did not depend on "the good frame of his Heart"-or, as we
should say, on his feelings-"now did the Chains fall off my legs
indeed." His had been Doubting Castle and Sloughs of Despond, with much
of the Valley of Humiliation and the Shadow of Death. But, above all, it
is a book of Victory. Once when he was leaving the doors of the
courthouse where he himself had been defeated, he wrote: "As I was going
forth of the doors, I had much ado to bear saying to them, that I
carried the peace of God along with me." In his vision was ever the
Celestial City, with all its bells ringing. He had fought Apollyon
constantly, and often wounded, shamed and fallen, yet in the end "more
than conqueror through Him that loved us."

His book was at first received with much criticism from his Puritan
friends, who saw in it only an addition to the worldly literature of his
day, but there was not much then for Puritans to read, and it was not
long before it was devoutly laid beside their Bibles and perused with
gladness and with profit. It was perhaps two centuries later before
literary critics began to realize that this story, so full of human
reality and interest and so marvelously modeled upon the English of the
King James translation of the Bible, is one of the glories of English
literature. In his later years he wrote several other allegories, of
which of one of them, "The Holy War," it has been said that, "If the
'Pilgrim's Progress' had never been written it would be regarded as the
finest allegory in the language."

During the later years of his life, Bunyan remained in Bedford as a
venerated local pastor and preacher. He was also a favorite speaker in
the non-conformist pulpits of London. He became so national a leader and
teacher that he was frequently called "Bishop Bunyan."

In his helpful and unselfish personal life he was apostolic.

His last illness was due to exposure upon a journey in which he was
endeavoring to reconcile a father with his son. His end came on the
third of August, 1688. He was buried in Bunhill Fields, a church yard in
London.

There is no doubt but that the "Pilgrim's Progress" has been more
helpful than any other book but the Bible. It was timely, for they were
still burning martyrs in Vanity Fair while he was writing. It is
enduring, for while it tells little of living the Christian life in the
family and community, it does interpret that life so far as it is an
expression of the solitary soul, in homely language. Bunyan indeed
"showed how to build a princely throne on humble truth." He has been his
own Greatheart, dauntless guide to pilgrims, to many.
