# The Lord's Prayer in Latin:

PATER noster, qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum. Adveniat
regnum tuum. Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra. Panem
nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie, et dimitte nobis debita nostra sicut
et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris. Et ne nos inducas in tentationem,
sed libera nos a malo. Amen.

# The Lord's Prayer in English:

OUR Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass
against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Amen.
