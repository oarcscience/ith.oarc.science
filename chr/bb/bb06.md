OF DARKNESS.

   D<span class="small">ARKNESS</span> is a self-existent nature; and if
it had not had a nature, it would not have been reckoned among the seven
natures which were created in the beginning in silence. Others say that
darkness is not a self-existent nature, but that it is the shadow of
bodies.
