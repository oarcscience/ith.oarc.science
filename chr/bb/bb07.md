# CHAPTER VII<span id="page_12_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_12_note_2).

OF EFFUSED (CIRCUMAMBIENT) LIGHT.

   W<span class="small">HEN</span> the holy angels were created on the
evening of the first day, without voice, they understood not their
creation, but thought within themselves that they were self-existent
beings and not made. On the morning of the first day God said in an
audible and commanding voice, 'Let there be light<span
id="page_12_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_12_note_3),' and immediately the
effused light was created. When the angels saw the creation of light,
they knew of a certainty that He who had made light had created them.
And they shouted with a loud voice, and praised Him, and marvelled at
His creation of light, as the blessed teacher<span
id="page_12_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_12_note_4) saith, 'When the Creator
made that light, the angels marvelled thereat,' etc.; and as it is said
in Job, 'When I created the morning star, all my angels praised me<span
id="page_12_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_12_note_5).' Now by nature light has
no warmth.
