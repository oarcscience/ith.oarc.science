# CHAPTER XV<span id="page_19_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_19_note_5.md).

OF PARADISE.

   I<span class="small">N</span> the eastern part of the earth, on the
mountain of Eden, beyond the ocean, God planted Paradise, and adorned it
with fruit-bearing trees of all kinds, that it might be a dwelling-place
for Adam and his progeny, if they should keep His commandments. He made
to spring forth from it a great river, which was parted into four
heads<span id="page_19_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_19_note_6.md), to water Paradise and
the whole earth. The first river is Pîshôn, which compasseth the land of
<u>H</u>avîlâ, where there is gold and beryls and fair and precious
<span id="page_20">p. 20</span> stones. The second river is
Gi<u>h</u>ôn, that is, the Nile of Egypt. The third river is
De<u>k</u>lath (the Tigris), which travels through the land of Assyria
and Bêth-Zabdai<span id="page_20_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_20_note_1.md). The fourth river is
P<u>e</u>rath (the Euphrates), which flows through the middle of the
earth. Some teachers say that Paradise surrounds the whole earth like a
wall and a hedge beyond the ocean. Others say that it was placed upon
the mount of Eden, higher than every other mountain in the world by
fifteen cubits<span id="page_20_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_20_note_2.md). Others say that it was
placed between heaven and earth, below the firmament and above this
earth, and that God placed it there as a boundary for Adam between
heaven and earth, so that, if he kept His commands, He might lift him up
to heaven, but if he transgressed them, He might cast him down to this
earth. And as the land of heaven is better and more excellent than the
land of Paradise, so was the land of Paradise better and more glorious
and more excellent (than our earth); its trees were more beautiful, its
flowers more odoriferous, and its atmosphere more pure than ours,
through superiority of species and not by nature. God made Paradise
large enough to be the dwelling-place of Adam and of his posterity,
provided that they kept the divine commandments. Now it is the
dwelling-place of the souls of the righteous, and its keepers are Enoch
and Elijah; Elijah the unwedded, and Enoch the married man: that the
unwedded may not exalt themselves above the married, as if, forsooth,
Paradise were suitable for the unwedded only. The souls of sinners are
without Paradise, in a deep place called Eden. After the resurrection,
the souls of the righteous and the sinners will put on their bodies. The
righteous will enter into heaven, which will become the land of the
righteous; while the sinners will remain upon earth. The tree of good
and evil that was in Paradise did not by nature possess these properties
of good and evil like rational beings, but only through the deed which
was wrought by its means; like the 'well of contention<span
id="page_20_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_20_note_3.md),' and the 'heap <span
id="page_21">p. 21</span> of witness<span
id="page_21_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_21_note_1.md),' which did not possess
these properties naturally, but only through the deeds which were
wrought by their means. Adam and Eve were not stripped of the glory with
which they were clothed, nor did they die the death of sin, because they
desired and ate of the fruit of the fig-tree--for the fruit of the
fig-tree was not better than the fruit of any other tree--but because of
the transgression of the law, in that they were presumptuous and wished
to become gods. On account of this foolish and wicked and blasphemous
intention, chastisement and penalty overtook them.--Concerning the tree
of life which was planted in the middle of Paradise, some have said that
Paradise is the mind, that the tree of good and evil is the knowledge of
material things, and that the tree of life is the knowledge of divine
things, which were not profitable to the simple understanding of
Adam<span id="page_21_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_21_note_2.md). Others have said that
the tree of life is the kingdom of heaven and the joy of the world to
come; and others that the tree of life was a tree in very truth, which
was set in the middle of Paradise, but no man has ever found out what
its fruit or its flowers or its nature was like<span
