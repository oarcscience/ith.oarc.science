# CHAPTER III<span id="page_7_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_7_note_5.md).

OF EARTH, WATER, AIR, AND FIRE.

   T<span class="small">HE</span> earth was *tôh w<u>e</u>-bôh*<span
id="page_7_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_7_note_6.md), that is to say, it was
unarranged and unadorned, but plunged in the midst of the waters. The
waters were <span id="page_8">p. 8</span> above it, and above the waters
was air, and above the air was fire. The earth is by nature cold and
dry. Dry land appeared on the third day, when the trees and plants were
created; and the waters were separated therefrom on the second day, when
the firmament was made from them. Water is by nature cold and moist. As
touching the 'Spirit which was brooding upon the face of the waters<span
id="page_8_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_8_note_1.md),' some men have ignorantly
imagined it to have been the Holy Spirit<span
id="page_8_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_8_note_2.md), while others have more
correctly thought it to have been this air (of ours). Air is by nature
hot and moist. Fire was operating in the upper ether, above the
atmosphere; it possessed heat only, and was without luminosity until the
fourth day, when the luminaries were created: we shall mention it in the
chapter on the luminaries (chap. x). Fire is by nature hot and dry.

were blessed that they might be bringers forth.' See Bezold's
