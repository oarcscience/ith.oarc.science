# The Book of the Bee

### notes to the hypertext transcription

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The *Book of the Bee* is a Nestorian Christian sacred history. According
to Budge it was written ca. <span class="small">A.D.</span> 1222 by a
Syrian bishop named Solomon (Sh<u>e</u>lêmôn). There is very little
about the work itself in the Preface to this edition, it being concerned
primarily with the manuscript sources. In the Introduction to the *Book
of the Cave of Treasures*, Budge says that Solomon's object in writing
the *Book of the Bee* was to present "a full history of the Christian
Dispensation according to the Nestorians." ([p.
27](../bct/bct03.htm#page_27).md).

**Transcription standards and notes**: This edition was written
primarily for philologists, and the printed version contains the entire
text in Syriac, as well as extensive selections from Arabic
translations. There are also lengthy footnotes in Syriac, many words in
Arabic and Hebrew, and references to the pagination of the Syriac text
embedded in the English translation. Almost all of this apparatus has
been removed and is normally not noted. Where the existence of a Syriac
word is crucial to the understanding of a footnote, it has been noted
with the symbol \#\#\#, as I am incompetent to transcribe Syriac.

Underlines represent breve (short) markings over vowels, and dots under
consonants, \` and ´ represent right and left pointing apostrophes in
transcriptions of Semitic words.
