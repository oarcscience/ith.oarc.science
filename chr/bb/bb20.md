# CHAPTER XX<span id="page_30_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_30_note_3.md).

OF NOAH AND THE FLOOD<span id="page_30_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_30_note_4.md).

   W<span class="small">HEN</span> Noah was five hundred years old, he
took a wife from the daughters of Seth; and there were born to him three
sons, Shem, Ham and Japhet. And God saw Noah's uprightness and
integrity, while all men were corrupted and polluted by
lasciviousness<span id="page_30_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_30_note_5.md); and He determined to
remove the human race from this broad earth, and made this known to the
blessed Noah, and commanded him to make an ark for the saving of
himself, his sons, and the rest of the animals. Noah constructed this
ark during the space of one hundred years, and he made it in three
stories<span id="page_30_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_30_note_6.md), all with boards and
projecting ledges. Each board <span id="page_31">p. 31</span> was a
cubit long and a span broad. The length of the ark was three hundred
cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. Noah made
it of box wood, though some say of teak wood; and he pitched it within
and without. At the end of the six hundredth year, God commanded Noah,
with his wife, his sons and his daughters-in-law--eight souls--to go
into the ark<span id="page_31_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_31_note_1.md), and to take in with him
seven couples of every clean animal and fowl, and one couple of every
unclean animal, a male and a female. And he took bread and water in with
him according to his need: not an abundant supply, lest they might be
annoyed by the smell of the faeces, but they got food just sufficient to
preserve their lives. God forewarned the blessed Noah of what he was
about to do seven days beforehand, in case the people might remember
their sins and offer the sacrifice of repentance. But those rebels
mocked at him scoffingly, and thrust out their unclean lips at the sound
of the saw and the adze. After seven days God commanded Noah to shut the
door of the ark, and to plaster it over with bitumen<span
id="page_31_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_31_note_2.md). And the fountains of the
deeps were broken up from beneath, and a torrent of rain (fell) from
above, for forty days and forty nights, without cessation, until the
waters rose fifteen cubits above the highest mountains in the world. And
the waters bore up the ark, which travelled over them from east to west
and from north to south, and so inscribed the figure of the cross upon
the world; and it passed over the ocean, and came to this broad
earth<span id="page_31_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_31_note_3.md). So the rain was stayed,
and the winds blew, and the waters remained upon the earth without
diminishing one hundred and fifty days, besides those forty days; which,
from the time that Noah entered the ark and the flood began until the
waters began to diminish, make in all one hundred and ninety days, which
are six months <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> and ten days--even until
the twentieth day of the latter Teshrî. The waters began to diminish
from the latter Teshrî to the tenth month, on the first day of which the
tops of the mountains appeared, but until the time when the earth was
dry, and the dove found rest for the sole of her foot, was one hundred
days. The ark rested upon the top of mount <u>K</u>ardô<span
id="page_32_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_32_note_1.md). In the tenth month,
which is Sh<u>e</u>bâ<u>t</u><span id="page_32_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_32_note_2.md), Noah opened the door of
the ark, and sent a raven to bring him news of the earth. And it went
and found dead bodies, and it alighted upon them and returned not. For
this reason people have made a proverb about Noah's raven. Again he sent
forth a dove, but it found not a place whereon to alight, and returned
to the ark. After seven days he sent forth another dove, and it returned
to him in the evening carrying an olive leaf in its bill; and Noah knew
that the waters had subsided. Noah remained in the ark a full year, and
he came forth from it and offered up an offering of clean animals; and
God accepted his offering and promised him that He would never again
bring a flood upon the face of the earth, nor again destroy beasts and
men by a flood; and He gave him (as) a token the bow in the clouds, and
from that day the bow has appeared in the clouds; and He commanded him
to slay and eat the flesh of beasts and birds after he had poured out
their blood. The number of people who came forth from the ark was eight
souls, and they built the town of Th<u>e</u>mânôn<span
id="page_32_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_32_note_3.md) after the name of the
eight souls, and it is to-day the seat of a bishopric in the province of
<u>S</u>ûbâ<span id="page_32_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_32_note_4.md). Noah planted a vineyard,
and drank of its wine; and one day when he slumbered, and was sunk in
the deep sleep of drunkenness, his nakedness was uncovered within his
tent. When Ham his son saw him, he laughed at him and despised him, and
told his brethren Shem and <span id="page_33">p. 33</span> Japhet. But
Shem and Japhet took a cloak upon their shoulders, and walked backwards
with their faces turned away, and threw the cloak over their father and
covered him, and then they looked upon him. When Noah awoke and knew
what had been done to him by the two sets of his sons, he cursed Canaan
the son of Ham and said, 'Thou shalt be a servant to thy brethren;' but
he blessed Shem and Japhet. The reason why he cursed Canaan, who was not
as yet born nor had sinned, was because Ham had been saved with him in
the ark from the waters of the flood, and had with his father received
the divine blessing; and also because the arts of sin--I mean music and
dancing and all other hateful things--were about to be revived by his
posterity, for the art of music proceeded from the seed of Canaan<span
id="page_33_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_33_note_1.md). After the flood a son
was born to Noah, and he called his name Jôna<u>t</u>ôn<span
id="page_33_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_33_note_2.md); and he provided him with
gifts and sent him to the fire of the sun, to the east. Noah lived after
the flood three hundred and fifty years; the sum of his years was nine
hundred and fifty years; and he saw eighteen generations and families
before and after it. He died on the fourth day of the week, on the
second of Nîsân, at the second hour of the day; his son Shem embalmed
him, and his sons buried him, and mourned over him forty days.
