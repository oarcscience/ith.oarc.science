# CHAPTER XLV<span id="page_99_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_99_note_4.md).

OF THE RESURRECTION OF OUR LORD.

   S<span class="small">INCE</span> the history of our Lord's Passion
and Resurrection is recorded in the Gospel, there is no need to repeat
it (here). After our Lord rose from the dead, He appeared ten times.
First, to Mary Magdalene, as John the Evangelist records<span
id="page_99_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_99_note_5.md). Secondly, to the women
at the grave, as Matthew mentions<span
id="page_99_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_99_note_6.md). Thirdly, to Cleopas and
his companion, as Luke says<span id="page_99_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_99_note_7.md). The companion of
Cleopas, when they were going to Emmaus, was Luke the Evangelist.
Fourthly, to Simon Peter, as Luke says<span
id="page_99_fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">8</span></sup>](#page_99_note_8.md). Fifthly, to all the
disciples, except Thomas, on the evening of the first day of the week,
when he went in through the closed doors, as Luke and John say<span
id="page_99_fr_9"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">9</span></sup>](#page_99_note_9.md). Sixthly, eight days
after, to the disciples, and to Thomas with them, as John says<span
id="page_99_fr_10"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">10</span></sup>](#page_99_note_10.md). Seventhly, on the
mount, as <span id="page_100">p. 100</span> Matthew says<span
id="page_100_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_100_note_1.md). Eighthly, upon the sea
of Tiberias, as John says<span id="page_100_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_100_note_2.md). The reason that Simon
Peter did not recognise Him was because he had denied Him, and was
ashamed to look upon Him; but John, because of his frank intimacy with
our Lord, immediately that he saw Him, knew Him. Ninthly, when He was
taken up to heaven from the Mount of Olives, as Mark and Luke say<span
id="page_100_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_100_note_3.md). Tenthly, to the five
hundred at once, who had risen from the dead, as Paul says<span
id="page_100_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_100_note_4.md). After His Ascension, He
appeared to Paul on the way to Damascus, when He blinded his eyes<span
id="page_100_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_100_note_5.md); and also to Stephen,
the martyr and deacon, when he was stoned<span
id="page_100_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_100_note_6.md).
