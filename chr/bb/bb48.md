# CHAPTER XLVIII<span id="page_103_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_103_note_2.md).

OF THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES, AND OF THE PLACES OF EACH ONE OF THEM,
AND OF THEIR DEATHS<span id="page_103_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_103_note_3.md).

   N<span class="small">EXT</span> we write the excellent discourse
composed by Mâr Eusebius of Caesarea upon the places and families of the
holy apostles.

   Know then that the apostles were twelve and seventy. When the <span
id="page_104">p. 104</span> apostles had received the gift of the Holy
Spirit, on the day following they fasted this feast of the apostles
(which we keep)<span id="page_104_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_104_note_1.md); but the Malkâyê
(Melchites)<span id="page_104_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_104_note_2.md) say that the apostles
fasted eight days after. Their names are as follows.

   Simon, the chief of the apostles, was from Bethsaida, of the tribe of
Naphtali. He first preached in Antioch, and built there the first of all
churches, which was in the house of Cassianus, whose son he restored to
life. He remained there one year, and there the disciples were called
Christians. From thence he went to Rome, where he remained for
twenty-seven years; and in the three hundred and seventy-sixth year of
the Greeks, the wicked Nero crucified him head downwards.

   Andrew his brother preached in Scythia and Nicomedia and Achaia. He
built a church in Byzantium, and there he died and was buried.

   John the son of Zebedee (Zabhdai) was also from Bethsaida, of the
tribe of Zebulun. He first preached in Asia (Ephesus), and was
afterwards cast into exile in the island of Patmos by Tiberius Caesar.
He then went to Ephesus, and built in it a church. Three of his
disciples went with him: Ignatius, who was afterwards bishop of Antioch,
and who was thrown to the beasts in Rome; Polycarp, who was afterwards
bishop of Smyrna, and was crowned by fire; and John, to whom he
committed the priesthood and the bishopric after him. When John had
lived a long time, he died and was buried at Ephesus; and John, the
<span id="page_105">p. 105</span> disciple of the Evangelist, who became
bishop of Ephesus, buried him<span id="page_105_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_105_note_1.md); for he commanded them
that no one should know the place of his burial. The graves of both of
them are in Ephesus; the hidden one of the Evangelist, and the other of
his disciple John, the author of the Revelation; he said that everything
he had written down, he had heard from John the Evangelist.

   James, the brother of John, preached in his city Bethsaida, and built
a church there. Herod Agrippas slew him with the sword one year after
the Ascension of our Lord. He was laid in Â<u>k</u>âr, a city of
Marmârî<u>k</u>â<span id="page_105_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_105_note_2.md).

   Philip also was from Bethsaida, of the tribe of Asher. He preached in
Phrygia, Pamphylia and Pisidia; he built a church in Pisidia, and died
and was buried there. He lived twenty-seven years as an apostle<span
id="page_105_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_105_note_3.md).

   Thomas was from Jerusalem, of the tribe of Judah. He taught the
Parthians, Medes and Indians<span id="page_105_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_105_note_4.md); and because he baptised
the daughter of the king of the Indians, he stabbed him with a spear and
he died<span id="page_105_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_105_note_5.md). <u>H</u>abbân the
merchant brought his body, and laid it in Edessa, the blessed city of
Christ our Lord<span id="page_105_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_105_note_6.md). Others say that he was
buried in Ma<u>h</u>lûph, a city in the land of the Indians<span
id="page_105_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_105_note_7.md).

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

   Matthew the Evangelist was from Nazareth, of the tribe of Issachar.
He preached in Palestine, Tyre and Sidon, and went as far as
Gabbûlâ<span id="page_106_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_106_note_1.md). He died and was buried
in Antioch, a city of Pisidia<span id="page_106_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_106_note_2.md).

   Bartholomew was from Endor, of the tribe of Issachar. He preached in
inner Armenia, Ardeshîr<span id="page_106_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_106_note_3.md), <u>Ket</u>arbôl<span
id="page_106_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_106_note_4.md), Radbîn, and Prûharmân.
After he had lived thirty years as an apostle, Hûrs<u>t</u>î<span
id="page_106_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_106_note_6.md) the king of the
Armenians crucified him, and he was buried in the church which he built
in Armenia.

   Jude, the son of James, who was surnamed Thaddaeus (Taddai), who is
also Lebbaeus (Lebbai), was from Jerusalem, of the tribe of Judah. He
preached in Laodicea and in Antaradus and Arwâd<span
id="page_106_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_106_note_7.md). He was stoned in Arwâd,
and died and was buried there<span id="page_106_fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">8</span></sup>](#page_106_note_8.md).

   Simon Zelôtes was from Galilee, of the tribe of Ephraim. He preached
in Sh<u>e</u>mêshât (Samosâta), Pârîn (Perrhê), Zeugma, <u>H</u>âlâb
(Aleppo), Mabbôg (Manbig), and Kenneshrîn (<u>K</u>innesrîn). He built a
church in Kyrrhos, and died and was buried there<span
id="page_106_fr_9"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">9</span></sup>](#page_106_note_9.md).

   James, the son of Alphaeus (<u>H</u>alphai), was from the Jordan, of
the tribe of Manasseh. He preached in Tadmor (Palmyra), Kirkêsion <span
id="page_107">p. 107</span> (<u>K</u>ir<u>k</u>îsiyâ), and Callinîcos
(ar-Ra<u>kk</u>ah), and came to Ba<u>t</u>nân of Serûg (Sarûg), where he
built a church, and died and was buried there<span
id="page_107_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_107_note_1.md).

   Judas Iscariot, the betrayer, was from the town of
S<u>e</u>kharyû<u>t</u> of the tribe of Gad, though some say that he was
of the tribe of Dan. He was like unto the serpent that acts deceitfully
towards its master, because like a serpent, he dealt craftily with his
Lord. Matthias, of the tribe of Reuben, came in in his stead. He
preached in Hellas, and in Sicily, where he built a church, and died and
was buried in it<span id="page_107_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_107_note_2.md).

   While James the brother of our Lord was teaching the Jews in
Jerusalem, they cast him down from a pinnacle of the temple; and while
his life was yet in him, a fuller of cloth smote him upon the head with
a club and beat it in; and afterwards they stoned him with stones<span
id="page_107_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_107_note_3.md).

   John the Baptist was of the tribe of Levi. Herod the tetrarch slew
him, and his body was laid in Sebastia.

   Ananias (<u>H</u>ananyâ) the disciple of the Baptist taught in
Damascus and Arbêl<span id="page_107_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_107_note_4.md). He was slain by Pôl,
the general of the army of Aretas<span
id="page_107_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_107_note_5.md), and was laid in the
church which he built at Arbêl (Irbil).

   Paul of Tarsus was a Pharisee by sect, of the tribe of Ephraim<span
id="page_107_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_107_note_6.md). When he had been
baptised by Ananias, he wrought many miracles, and taught great cities,
and bore and suffered dangers not a few for the name of Christ.
Afterwards he went to Peter at Rome. When they divided the world between
them, and the heathen fell to Paul's lot, and the Jewish nation to
Peter, and they had turned<span id="page_107_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_107_note_7.md) many to the truth of
Christ, Nero commanded that they should both die a cruel death. Then
Simon asked to be crucified head downwards, that he might kiss that part
of the cross where the heels <span id="page_108">p. 108</span> of his
Master had been. As they were going forth to be slain, they gave the
laying on of hands of the priesthood to their disciples, Peter to Mark,
and Paul to Luke. When Peter had been crucified, and Paul slain,
together with many of those who had become their disciples, Mark and
Luke went forth by night, and brought their bodies into the city. Now
Paul's head was lost among the slain, and could not be found. Some time
after, when a shepherd was passing by the spot where the slain were
buried, he found Paul's head, and took it upon the top of his staff, and
laid it by his sheep-fold. At night he saw a fire blazing over it, and
he went in (to the city) and informed the holy bishop Xystus (Sixtus)
and the clergy of the church; and they all recognised that it was Paul's
head. Xystus said to them, 'Let us watch and pray the whole night, and
let us bring out the body and lay the head at its feet; and if it joins
again to its neck, it will be certain that it is Paul's.' And when they
had done so, the whole body was restored, and the head was joined to its
neck as if the vertebrae had never been severed; and those who saw it
were amazed and glorified God. From his call to the end of his life was
thirty-five years; he went about in every place for thirty-one years;
for two years he was in prison at Caesarea, and for two years at Rome.
He was martyred in the thirty-sixth year after the Passion of our Lord,
and was laid with great honour in the magnificent royal catacombs in
Rome. They celebrate every year the day of his commemoration on the
twenty-ninth of the month of Tammûz<span
id="page_108_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_108_note_1.md).

   Luke the physician and Evangelist was first of all a disciple of
Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha, and was afterwards baptised by
Philip in the city of Beroea<span id="page_108_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_108_note_2.md). He was crowned with the
sword by <u>H</u>ôros<span id="page_108_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_108_note_3), the judge (or governor.md)
of the emperor Tiberius, while he was preaching in Alexandria, and was
buried there.

   Mark the Evangelist preached in Rome, and died and was buried
there<span id="page_108_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_108_note_4.md). Some say that he was
the son of Simon Peter's wife, others <span id="page_109">p. 109</span>
that he was the Son of Simon; and Rhoda was his sister. He was first
called John, but the Apostles changed his name and called him Mark, that
there might not be two Evangelists of one name.

   Addai was from Paneas, and he preached in Edessa and in Mesopotamia
in the days of Abgar the king; and he built a church in Edessa. After
Abgar died, Herod<span id="page_109_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_109_note_1.md) Abgar's son slew him in
the fortress of Aggêl<span id="page_109_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_109_note_2.md). His body was afterwards
taken and carried to Rome; but some say that he was laid in Edessa.

   Aggai his disciple was first of all a maker of silks for Abgar, and
became a disciple. After Abgar's death, his son reigned, and he required
of Aggai to weave silks for him; and when he consented not, saying, 'I
cannot forsake teaching and preaching to return to weaving,' he smote
him with a club upon his legs and brake them, and he died<span
id="page_109_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_109_note_3.md).

   Thaddaeus (Taddai) came after him at Edessa, and Herod, the son of
Abgar, slew him also; he was buried at Edessa.

id="page_109_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span

says that when the crucifiers knew that Nicodemus had become a
Christian, they seized his property and slew him; and that his brother
Gamaliel buried him in K<u>e</u>phar Gamlâ. It then gives the following
account of Gamaliel. Gamaliel was a friend of the crucifying Jews, but
was afterwards baptised together with his son: he lived for twenty years
after this. When <span id="footnotes_page_110"></span>p. 110 they died,
they were buried by the side of Nicodemus in K<u>e</u>phar Gamlâ, where
Stephen was buried. Many years after (about <span
class="small">A.D.</span> 415), God revealed their place of burial to
one of the saints (Lucian), and they sought for the remains of the
bodies by digging, and found them; and there they built a church. Foll.
