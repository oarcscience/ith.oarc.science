# THE BOOK OF THE BEE.

   T<span class="small">RUSTING</span> in the power of our Lord Jesus
Christ, we begin to write this book of gleanings called 'The Bee,' which
was composed by the saint of God, Mâr Solomon, metropolitan of
P<u>e</u>rath-Maishân<span id="page_1_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_1_note_1.md), that is Bassorah
(al-Ba<u>s</u>rah), one of His companions. O Lord, in Thy mercy help me.
Amen.

FIRST, THE APOLOGY.

   'The children ought not to lay up treasures for the parents, but the
parents for the spiritual children,' saith the blessed Paul<span
id="page_1_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_1_note_2.md); therefore we are bound to
repay thee the debt of love, O beloved brother and staff of our old age,
saint of God, Mâr Narses<span id="page_1_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_1_note_3.md), bishop of Khônî-Shâbôr
Bêth-Wâzi<u>k</u><span id="page_1_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_1_note_4.md). We remember thy
solicitude for us, and thy zeal for our service, which thou didst fulfil
with fervent love and Christ-like humility. And when we had loving
meetings with each other from time to time, thou wert wont to ask
questions and to make enquiries about the various things which God hath
wrought in His dispensation in this material world, and also as to the
things that He is about to do in the world of light. But since we were
afflicted with the Mosaic defect of hesitancy of speech, we were unable
to inform thee fully concerning the profitable <span id="page_2">p.
2</span> matters about which, as was right, thou didst enquire; and for
this reason we were prevented from profitable discourse upon the holy
Books. Since, then, God has willed and ruled our separation from each
other, and the sign of old age, which is the messenger of death, hath
appeared in us, and we have grown old and come into years, it has seemed
good to us, with the reed for a tongue and with ink for lips, to inform
thee briefly concerning God's dispensation in the two worlds. And,
behold, we have gleaned and collected and gathered together chapters and
sections relating to this whole universe from the garden of the divine
Books and from the crumbs of the Fathers and the Doctors, having laid
down as the foundation of our building the beginning of the creation of
this world, and concluding with the consummation of the world to come.
We have called this book the 'Book of the Bee,' because we have gathered
of the blossoms of the two Testaments and of the flowers of the holy
Books, and have placed them therein for thy benefit. As the common bee
with gauzy wings flies about, and flutters over and lights upon flowers
of various colours, and upon blossoms of divers odours, selecting and
gathering from all of them the materials which are useful for the
construction of her handiwork; and having first of all collected the
materials from the flowers, carries them upon her thighs, and bringing
them to her dwelling, lays a foundation for her building with a base of
wax; then gathering in her mouth some of the heavenly dew which is upon
the blossoms of spring, brings it and blows it into these cells; and
weaves the comb and honey for the use of men and her own nourishment: in
like manner have we, the infirm, hewn the stones of corporeal words from
the rocks of the Scriptures which are in the Old Testament, and have
laid them down as a foundation for the edifice of the spiritual law. And
as the bee carries the waxen substance upon her thighs because of its
insipidity and tastelessness, and brings the honey in her mouth because
of its sweetness and value; so also have we laid down the corporeal law
by way of substratum and foundation, and the spiritual law for a roof
and ceiling to the edifice of the spiritual tower. And as the expert
gardener and orchard-keeper goes round among the gardens, and seeking
out the finest sorts of fruits takes from them slips and shoots, and
plants them in his own field; so also have we gone into the garden of
the divine Books, and have culled therefrom <span id="page_3">p.
3</span> branches and shoots, and have planted them in the ground of
this book for thy consolation and benefit. When thou, O brother, art
recreating thyself among these plants, those which appear and which thou
dost consider to be insipid and tasteless, leave for thy companions, for
they may be more suitable to others (than to thee); but, upon those
which are sweet, and which sweeten the palate of thy understanding, do
thou feed and satisfy thy hunger. If, however, owing to their fewness,
they do not fill thee, seek in succession for their roots, and from
thence shall thy want be satisfied. Know also, O brother, that where
there is true love, there is no fear<span
id="page_3_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_3_note_1.md); and where there is
freedom of speech, there is no dread; and we should not dare to be so
rash as to enter upon these subjects, which are beyond the capacity of
our simple understanding, unless we relied upon thy immaculate love;
because, in the words of one of the inspired<span
id="page_3_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_3_note_2.md), 'When thou findest honey,
eat (only) so much as is sufficient for thee, lest, when thou art sated,
thou vomit it<span id="page_3_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_3_note_3.md)'; that is to say, do not
enquire (too closely) into the divine words.

Bêth-Wâzî<u>k</u>, was a town on the little Zâb, close to its junction
with the Tigris, in the diocese of <u>T</u>îrhân. Bêth-Wâzî<u>k</u> is
also written Bêth-Wâzîg, and has been altered by the Arabs into
*al-Bawâzîg* or *al-Bawâzîj*. See Hoffmann, *Auszüge aus syrischen Akten
persischer Märtyrer*, pp. 189 and 296. It has, of course, nothing
whatever to do with Gundê-Shâbôr, or *Jundai-Shâbûr*, with which it has
sometimes been confounded.
