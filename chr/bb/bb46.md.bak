# CHAPTER XLVI<span id="page_100_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_100_note_7.md).

OF THE ASCENSION OF OUR LORD TO HEAVEN.

   A<span class="small">FTER</span> our Redeemer had risen from the
grave, and had gone about in the world forty days, He appeared to His
disciples ten times, and ate and drank with them by the side of the Sea
of Tiberias. At this point the heathen say to us, that if our Lord
really ate and drank after His resurrection, there will certainly be
eating and drinking after (our) resurrection; but if He did not really
eat and drink, then all the actions of Christ are mere phantasms. To
these we make answer, that this world is a world of need for food;
therefore He ate and drank, that it might not be thought He was a
phantom; and because many who have risen from the dead have eaten and
drunk in (this) world until they departed and died, as, for example, the
dead (child) whom Elisha raised, and the dead whom our Lord raised. Our
Lord did not eat after His resurrection because He needed food, but only
to make certain His humanity: for, behold<span
id="page_100_fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">8</span></sup>](#page_100_note_8.md), He once remained in the
desert forty days <span id="page_101">p. 101</span> without food, and
was not injured by hunger. Some say that after His resurrection our Lord
ate food like unto that which the angels ate in the house of Abraham,
and that the food was dissipated and consumed by the Divine Power, just
as fire licks up oil without any of it entering into its substance. Our
Lord remained upon the earth forty days, even as He had fasted forty
days, and as Elijah fasted forty days, and as Moses fasted forty days at
two several times, and as the rain continued for forty days during the
flood, and as God admonished the Ninevites for forty days, and as the
spies remained (absent) for forty days, and as the children of Israel
wandered about in the wilderness for forty years, and like the child
whose fashioning in the womb is completed in forty days. After forty
days, our Lord took up His disciples to the Mount of Olives, and laid
His hand upon them, and blessed them, and commanded them concerning the
preaching and teaching of the nations. And it came to pass that while He
was blessing them, He was separated from them, and went up to heaven;
and they worshipped Him. And there appeared to them angels, encouraging
them and saying, 'This Jesus, who has been taken up from you to heaven,
is about to come again even as ye have seen Him go up to heaven.' Then
they returned to that upper chamber where they were, and stayed there
ten days, until they received the Holy Spirit in the form of tongues of
fire. Simon Peter said to his fellow-disciples, 'It is right for us to
put some one in the place of Judas to complete the number of twelve;'
and they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered
with the eleven apostles<span id="page_101_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_101_note_1.md).

   As concerning the manner in which our Lord entered heaven without
cleaving it, some say that He went in as He did through the closed
doors; and as He came forth from the virgin womb, and Mary's virginity
returned to its former state; and like the sweat from the body; and as
water is taken up by the roots of the olive and other trees, and reaches
in the twinkling of an eye the leaves, flowers and fruits, as if through
certain ducts, without holes or channels being pierced in them. Thus by
an infinite and ineffable miracle our Lord entered into heaven without
cleaving it. And if the bodies of us who are accustomed <span
id="page_102">p. 102</span> to drink water and wine pour out sweat
without our flesh being rent or our skin pierced, how very much easier
is it for the Divine Power to go in through closed doors and within the
firmament of heaven without rending or cleaving it?

   <span id="page_102_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_102_note_1.md)As regards the upper
chamber in which our Lord held His Passover, some say that it belonged
to Lazarus, and others to Simon the Cyrenian, and others to Joseph the
senator; but Joshua the son of Nun, the Catholicus<span
id="page_102_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_102_note_2.md), says that it belonged
to Nicodemus. The apostles remained in the upper chamber ten days after
the Ascension, being constant in fasting and prayer, and expecting the
Spirit, the Comforter, which our Lord Jesus Christ promised them.

Christ, in the middle of which (fol. 178 *b*) is a Syriac passage in
which the names of Athanasius and Gregory are mentioned. The view there
maintained is that Christ is God and man in the unity of one Person.
