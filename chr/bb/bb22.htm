<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The children of Shem</I>. The people of Shem are twenty and seven families. Elam, from whom sprang the Elamites; Asshur, from whom sprang the Assyrians (&Acirc;th&ocirc;r&acirc;y&ecirc;); Arphaxar<A NAME="page_36_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_36_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A>, from whom sprang the Persians; and Lud (L&ocirc;d) and Aram, from whom sprang the Arameans, the Damascenes, and the <U>H</U>arranites. Now the father of all the children of Eber was Arphaxar. Sh&acirc;l&acirc;<U>h</U> begat Eber (Ab&acirc;r), and to Eber were born two sons; the name of the one of whom was Peleg (P&acirc;l&acirc;g), because in his days the earth was divided. From this it is known that the Syriac language remained with Eber, because, when the languages were confounded and the earth was divided, he was born, and was called Peleg by the Syriac word which existed in his time. After Peleg, Jo<U>k</U><U>t</U>&acirc;n (Ya<U>k</U><U>t</U>&acirc;n) was born, from whom sprang the thirteen nations who dwelt beside one another and kept the Syriac language. And their dwelling was from M<U>e</U>nashsh&ecirc; (or Mansh&acirc;) of mount Sepharva&iuml;m<A NAME="page_36_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_36_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A>, by the side of the land of Canaan, and towards the east, beginning at Aram and Damascus, and coming to Baish&acirc;n [Maish&acirc;n ?] and Elam, and their border (was) Assyria, and the east, and Persia to the south, and the Great Sea<A NAME="page_36_fr_5"></A><A HREF="#page_36_note_5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A>. Now the Hebrew has Maish&acirc;n instead of M<U>e</U>nashsh&ecirc; (or Mansh&acirc;), in the verse, 'The children of Jo<U>k</U><U>t</U>&acirc;n dwelt from Maish&acirc;n to Sepharva&iuml;m<A NAME="page_36_fr_6"></A><A HREF="#page_36_note_6"><SUP><SMALL>6</SMALL></SUP></A>.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The children of Ham</I>. The people of Ham are thirty and six families, besides the Philistines and Cappadocians. Cush, from whom sprang the Cushites; Mi<U>s</U>raim, from whom sprang the Mi<U>s</U>r&acirc;y&ecirc; (or Egyptians); Phut (or P&ocirc;<U>t</U>), from whom sprang the P&ocirc;<U>t</U>&acirc;y&ecirc;; Canaan, from whom sprang the Canaanites; the seven kings whom Joshua the son of Nun destroyed<A NAME="page_37_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_37_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>; the children of `&Ocirc;b&acirc;r<A NAME="page_37_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_37_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A>, Sheb&acirc; and <U>H</U>av&icirc;l&acirc;, from whom sprang the Indians, the Amorites, the Samr&acirc;y&ecirc;, the Me<U>t</U>r&acirc;y&ecirc;, and all the dwellers of the south. And of Cush was born Nimrod, who was the first king after the flood. The beginning of his kingdom was Babel (Babylon), which he built, and in which he reigned; and then, after the division of tongues, he built the following cities: &Acirc;r&acirc;ch (Erech), which is Orh&acirc;i (Edessa), &Acirc;ch&acirc;r (Accad), which is Ni<U>s</U>&icirc;bis, and Caly&acirc; (Calneh), which is Ctesiphon<A NAME="page_37_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_37_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A>. The land of Babel he called the land of Shinar<A NAME="page_37_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_37_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A>, because in it were the languages confounded<A NAME="page_37_fr_5"></A><A HREF="#page_37_note_5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A>, for 'Shinar' in the Hebrew language is interpreted 'division.' From that land the Assyrian went forth and built Nineveh and the town of Reh&ocirc;b&ocirc;th, which is the town of Arb&ecirc;l (Irbil). It is said that Belus, the son of Nimrod, was the first to depart from Babel and to come to Assyria; and after Belus, his son Ninus built Nineveh, and called it after his name, and Arb&ecirc;l and C&acirc;l&acirc;<U>h</U>, which is <U>H</U>e<U>t</U>r&ecirc; (<U>H</U>a<U>t</U>r&acirc;)<A NAME="page_37_fr_6"></A><A HREF="#page_37_note_6"><SUP><SMALL>6</SMALL></SUP></A>, and Resen, which is R&ecirc;sh-`ain&acirc; (R&acirc;s`ain). Mi<U>s</U>raim begat Ludim, from

whom sprang the L&ocirc;d&acirc;y&ecirc;; La`b&icirc;m, from whom sprang the L&ucirc;b&acirc;y&ecirc;; Lahb&icirc;m, from whom sprang the Tebt&acirc;y&ecirc;; Yaphtu<U>h</U>&icirc;m, Pathrus&icirc;m, and Casluh&icirc;m, from whom went forth the Philistines, the Gedr&acirc;y&ecirc; (Gadarenes), and the people of Sodom. Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, from whom sprang the <U>S</U>&ocirc;r&acirc;y&ecirc; (Tyrians) and Sidonians, ten nations who dwelt by the side of Israel, from the sea (i.e. the Mediterranean) to the Euphrates; the <U>K</U>&icirc;sh&acirc;y&ecirc;, the <U>K</U>enr&acirc;y&ecirc; (or <U>K</U>&icirc;r&acirc;y&ecirc;), and the A<U>k</U>d<U>e</U>m&ocirc;n&acirc;y&ecirc; (or <U>K</U>adm&ocirc;n&acirc;y&ecirc;), who were between the children of Esau and Amn&acirc; of Ireth<A NAME="page_38_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_38_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>. The children of Lot are children of Ham<A NAME="page_38_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_38_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The children of Japhet</I>. The people of Japhet are fifteen families. Gomer, from whom sprang the G&ecirc;&ocirc;th&acirc;y&ecirc; (G&ocirc;th&acirc;y&ecirc;, Goths ?); Magog, from whom sprang the Galatians; M&acirc;d&acirc;i, from whom sprang the Medes; Javan, from whom sprang the Yaun&acirc;y&ecirc; (Greeks); T&ucirc;b&icirc;l (Tubal), from whom sprang the Baith&ocirc;n&acirc;y&ecirc; (Bithynians); Meshech, from whom sprang the M&ucirc;s&acirc;y&ecirc; (Mysians); T&icirc;ras, from whom sprang the Tharn<U>e</U><U>k</U>&acirc;y&ecirc; (or Thr&ecirc;<U>k</U>&acirc;y&ecirc;, Thracians), the Ansh<U>k</U>l&acirc;y&ecirc; (or As<U>k</U>l&acirc;y&ecirc;), and the Achshkl&acirc;y&ecirc;. The children of Gomer: Ashk<U>e</U>naz, from whom sprang the Armenians; Danphar, from whom sprang the Cappadocians; Togarmah, from whom sprang the As&acirc;y&ecirc; (Asians) and the &Icirc;saur&acirc;y&ecirc; (Isaurians). The sons of Javan: Elisha, that is Halles (Hellas); Tarsh&icirc;sh, Cilicia, Cyprus, K&acirc;th&icirc;m (Kitt&icirc;m), Doranim<A NAME="page_38_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_38_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A>, and the Macedonians; and from these they were divided among the islands of the nations. These are the families of the children of Noah, and from them were the nations divided on the earth after the flood; they are seventy and two families, and according to the families, so are the languages.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_37_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_37_fr_1">1</A> Perhaps Solomon means the 'five kings of the Amorites,' <A HREF="../../bib/kjv/jos.htm#10:5">Josh. x. 5</A>; or else he refers to the 'seven nations,' <A HREF="../../bib/kjv/deu.htm#7:1">Deut. vii. 1</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_37_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_37_fr_2">2</A> According to <A HREF="../../bib/kjv/gen.htm#10:7">Gen. x. 7</A>, we should read Cush.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_37_note_3"></A><A HREF="#page_37_fr_3">3</A> See <A HREF="../../bib/kjv/gen.htm#10:10">Gen. x. 10</A>. Solomon's ideas as to what is meant by Erech, Accad, and Calneh are, of course, utterly erroneous. Erech is the ruins of War<U>k</U>&acirc;, on the left bank of the lower Euphrates, S.E. of Babylon; Accad is a name for Upper Babylonia, as opposed to Sumir or Lower Babylonia; Calneh has not yet been identified. See also Schrader, <I>The Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament</I>, p. 78.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_37_note_4"></A><A HREF="#page_37_fr_4">4</A> Some Assyriologists consider the biblical Shinar to be the same as Sumir or Lower Babylonia. See Lenormant, <I>&Eacute;tudes Accad</I>. ii. 3, p. 70.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_37_note_5"></A><A HREF="#page_37_fr_5">5</A> It is certain that the name Babel or Babylon has no connection with the Heb. &#64315;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500; {Hebrew: <I>B&acirc;LaL</I>} or &#64315;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#64315;&#1461;&#1500; {Hebrew: <I>BaLaBeL</I>}; in the cuneiform inscriptions <I>b&acirc;b-ilu</I> means 'Gate of God,' and is the Semitic equivalent of the Akkadian <I>ka-dingirra-ki</I>.</P>
