# CHAPTER XXXV<span id="page_78_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_78_note_1.md).

OF THE ANNUNCIATION BY GABRIEL TO MARY OF THE CONCEPTION OF OUR LORD.

   A<span class="small">T</span> the ninth hour of the first day of the
week, on the twenty-fifth of the month of Adar,--though some say on the
first day of the month of Nisan, which is correct,--in the three hundred
and seventh year of Alexander the son of Philip, or of Nectanebus<span
id="page_78_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_78_note_2.md), the Macedonian, six
months after Elizabeth's conception of John, the archangel Gabriel
appeared to Mary and said to her, 'Peace be to thee, O full of grace!
our Lord is with thee, O blessed among women!' As for her, when she saw
(him), she was terrified at his words, and was thinking what this
salutation was. The angel said to her, 'Fear not Mary, for thou hast
found grace with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive and bear a son,
and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel, which is interpreted, "our God is
with us." This (child) shall be great, and shall be called the Son of
the Highest.' Mary said to the angel, 'Behold, I am the handmaid of the
Lord; let it be to me according to thy word.' And the angel went away
from her. In those days Mary arose, and went to Elizabeth het cousin,
and she went in and saluted Elizabeth. And it came to pass that when
Elizabeth heard Mary's salutation, the babe leaped in her womb, and John
in Elizabeth's womb bowed down to our Lord in Mary's womb, as a servant
to his master. Mary remained with Elizabeth about three months, and then
returned to her house. After the lapse of six months, Joseph saw that
Mary had conceived, and he was troubled in his mind, and said, 'What
answer shall I give to the high priest in respect of this trial which
has befallen me?' And because he relied upon the purity of his spouse,
he fell into perplexity <span id="page_79">p. 79</span> and doubt, and
said to her, 'Whence hast thou this? and who has beguiled thee, O
perfect dove? Wast thou not brought up with the pure virgins and
venerable matrons in the temple of the Lord?' And she wept, saying, 'As
the Lord God liveth, I have never known man nor had connexion with any
one;' but she did not speak to him of the angel and the cause of her
conception. Then Joseph meditated within himself and said, 'If I reveal
this matter before men, I fear lest it may be from God; and if I keep it
back and hide it, I fear the rebuke and penalty of the law.' For the
Jews did not approach their wives until they made a feast to the high
priest, and then they took them. And Joseph thought that he would put
her away secretly; and while he was pondering these things in his heart,
the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, and said, 'Joseph, son
of David, fear not to take Mary thy wife; for that which is born in her
is of the Holy Spirit.' He spake well when he said 'in her,' and not 'of
her.'

   And the priests heard of Mary's conception, and they made an
accusation against Joseph, as if deceit had been found in him. Joseph
said, 'As the Lord liveth, I know not the cause of her conception;' and
Mary likewise swore this. There was a custom among the Jews that, when
any one of them was accused with an accusation, they made him drink 'the
water of trial<span id="page_79_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_79_note_1.md);' if he were innocent, he
was not hurt, but if he were guilty, his belly swelled, and his body
became swollen, and the mark of chastisement appeared in him. When they
had made Mary and Joseph drink of the water of trial, and they were not
hurt, the high priest commanded Joseph to guard her diligently until
they saw the end of this matter<span
