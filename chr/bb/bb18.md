# CHAPTER XVIII<span id="page_24_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_24_note_3.md).

OF ADAM'S KNOWING EVE.

   W<span class="small">HEN</span> Adam and Eve went forth from
Paradise, they were both virgins. After thirty years Adam knew Eve his
wife, and she conceived <span id="page_25">p. 25</span> and brought
forth Cain together with his sister <u>Ke</u>lêmath at one birth<span
id="page_25_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_25_note_1.md). And after thirty years
Eve conceived and brought forth Abel and L<u>e</u>bôdâ his sister at one
birth. And when they arrived at the age for marriage, Adam wished and
intended to give Abel's sister to Cain and <span id="page_26">p.
26</span> Cain's sister to Abel; but Cain desired his own sister more
than Abel's<span id="page_26_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_26_note_1.md). Both (i.e.
<u>Ke</u>lêmath and L<u>e</u>bôdâ) were his sisters, but because of
their birth at one time I have called them thus. Now Cain's sister was
exceedingly beautiful. The two brothers made an offering to God because
of this matter. Abel, because he was a shepherd, offered up of the fat
firstlings of his flock in great love, with a pure heart and a sincere
mind. Cain, because he was a husbandman, made an offering of some of the
refuse of the fruits of his husbandry with reluctance. He made an
offering of ears of wheat that were smitten by blight; but some say of
straw only. And the divine fire came down from heaven and consumed the
offering of Abel, and it was accepted; while the offering of Cain was
rejected. And Cain was angry with God, and envied his brother; and he
persuaded his brother to come out into the plain, and slew him. Some say
that he smashed his head with stones, and killed him; and others say
that Satan appeared to him in the form of wild beasts that fight with
one another and slay each other. At any rate, he killed him, whether
this way or that way. Then God said to Cain, 'Where is Abel thy
brother?' Cain said, 'Am I forsooth my brother's keeper?' God said,
'Behold, the sound of the cry of thy brother Abel's blood has come unto
me;' and God cursed Cain, and made him a wanderer and a fugitive all the
days of his life. From the day in which the blood of Abel was shed upon
the ground, it did not <span id="page_27">p. 27</span> again receive the
blood of any animal until Noah came forth from the ark. Adam and Eve
mourned for Abel one hundred years. In the two hundred and thirtieth
year<span id="page_27_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_27_note_1.md), Seth, the beautiful, was
born in the likeness of Adam; and Adam and Eve were consoled by him,
Cain and his descendants went down and dwelt in the plain, while Adam
and his children, that is the sons of Seth, dwelt upon the top of the
Mount of Eden, And the sons of Seth went down and saw the beauty of the
daughters of Cain, and lay with them<span
id="page_27_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_27_note_2.md); and the earth was
corrupted and polluted with lasciviousness<span
id="page_27_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_27_note_3.md); and Adam and Eve heard
of it and <span id="page_28">p. 28</span> mourned. Now Adam lived nine
hundred and thirty years<span id="page_28_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_28_note_1.md). Some say that in the
days of Seth the knowledge of books went forth in the earth; but the
Church does not accept this. When Seth was two hundred and fifty years
old<span id="page_28_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_28_note_2.md), he begat Enos; and Seth
lived nine hundred and thirteen years<span
id="page_28_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_28_note_3.md), and he died. Enos was
two hundred and ninety years<span id="page_28_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_28_note_4.md) old when he begat Cainan;
and Enos first called upon the name of the Lord. Some say that he first
composed books upon the course of the stars and the signs of the
Zodiac<span id="page_28_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_28_note_5.md). Enos lived nine hundred
and five years. Cainan was a hundred and forty<span
id="page_28_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_28_note_6.md) years old when he begat
Mahalaleel; and he lived nine hundred and ten years. Mahalaleel was one
hundred and sixty-five<span id="page_28_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_28_note_7.md) years old when he begat
Jared; and he lived eight hundred and ninety-five years<span
id="page_28_fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">8</span></sup>](#page_28_note_8.md). Jared was one hundred
and sixty-two years old when he begat Enoch; and he lived nine hundred
and sixty-two years. Enoch was one hundred and sixty-five<span
id="page_28_fr_9"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">9</span></sup>](#page_28_note_9.md) years old when he begat
Methuselah; and when he was three hundred and sixty-five years old, God
removed him to the generation of life, that is to Paradise. Methuselah
was one hundred <span id="page_29">p. 29</span> and eighty-seven years
old when he begat Lamech; and he lived nine hundred and sixty-nine
years. Lamech was a hundred and eighty-two years old when he begat Noah;
and he lived seven hundred and seventy-seven years<span

Oxford MS.

<span id="page_25_note_1"></span>[1](#page_25_fr_1.md) The 'Cave of
Treasures' relates the story of Cain's birth and the dispute of the
brothers thus: 'When Adam wished to know Eve his wife, he took from the
skirts of Paradise gold, myrrh, and frankincense, and put them in a
cave: and he blessed it and sanctified it that it might be the house of
prayer of himself and of his sons, and he called it the "Cave of
Treasures." And Adam and Eve came down from that holy mountain to its
skirts below; and there Adam knew Eve his wife. Some say that Adam knew
Eve thirty years after they had gone forth from Paradise. And she
conceived and bare Cain and L<u>e</u>bôdâ his sister with him; and again
she conceived and bare Abel and <u>Ke</u>lêmath his sister with him.
When the youths had grown up, Adam said to Eve, "Let Cain take to wife
<u>Ke</u>lêmath who was born with Abel, and let Abel take L<u>e</u>bôdâ
who was born with Cain." But Cain said to Eve his mother, "I will take
to wife my own sister, and let Abel take his;" for L<u>e</u>bôdâ was
beautiful. When Adam heard these words, he was very grieved, and said,
"It is a transgression <span id="footnotes_page_26"></span>p. 26 of the
law that thou shouldst take to wife thy sister who was born with thee.
But take ye of the fruit of the trees and the young of the flocks, and
go ye up to the top of this holy mountain, and enter into the Cave of
Treasures, and offer up your offerings there, and pray before God, and
then be united unto your wives." And it came to pass that when Adam the
first priest, and Cain and Abel his sons, were going up to the top of
the mountain, Satan suggested to Cain to slay Abel his brother for the
sake of L<u>e</u>bôdâ, and because his offering was rejected and not
accepted before God, while that of Abel was accepted. And Cain increased
his envy against Abel his brother; and when they came down to the plain,
Cain stood up against Abel his brother and slew him by a wound from a
flint stone.' See Bezold, *Die Schatzhöhle*, p. 8; Brit. Mus. Add.
25,875, [fol. 7 *b*, col. 2](../bct/bct04.htm#fol_7b2.md) to fol. 8 *a*,

<span id="page_27_note_3"></span>[3](#page_27_fr_3.md) 'And the sons of
Seth had intercourse with the daughters of Cain; and they conceived by
them and brought forth mighty men, the sons of heroes, like towers,
Hence early writers have erred and written, "The angels came down from
heaven, and had intercourse with mankind, and from them were born mighty
men of renown," But this is not true; they have said this because they
did not understand, Now see, my brother readers, and know that this is
neither in the nature of spiritual beings, nor in the nature of the
impure and evil-doing demons who love adultery; for there are no males
nor females among them, nor has there been even one added to their
number since they fell. If the devils were able to have intercourse with
women, they would not leave one single virgin undefiled in the whole
human race.' See Bezold, *Die Schatzhöhle*, p. 18; and Brit. Mus. Add.
25,875, [fol. 14 *b*, col. 2](../bct/bct05.htm#fol_14b2.md). <span
id="footnotes_page_28"></span>p. 28 'Seth became a leader to the
children of his people, and he ruled them in purity and holiness. And
because of their purity they received this name, which is better than
all names, that they should be called the children of God . . . . . . .
. . and they went up in place of that band of demons which fell from
heaven, to praise and glorify on the skirts of Paradise.' See Bezold,
