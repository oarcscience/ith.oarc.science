# CHAPTER XXXIX<span id="page_84_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_84_note_1.md).

OF THE COMING OF THE MAGI FROM PERSIA.

   W<span class="small">HEN</span> Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judah,
and the star appeared to the Magi in the east, twelve Persian kings took
offerings--gold and myrrh and frankincense--and came to worship Him.
Their names are these: Zarwândâd the son of Artabân<span
id="page_84_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_84_note_2.md), and Hôrmîzdâd the son of
Sî<u>t</u>ârû<u>k</u> (San<u>t</u>arô<u>k</u>), Gûshnâsâph (Gushnasp)
the son of Gûndaphar, and Arshakh the son of Mîhârô<u>k</u>; these four
brought gold. Zarwândâd the son of Warzwâd, Îryâhô the son of Kesrô
(Khosrau), Ar<u>t</u>a<u>h</u>shisht the son of <u>H</u>olîtî,
Ashtôn\`âbôdan the son of Shîshrôn; these four brought myrrh.
Mêhârô<u>k</u> the son of <u>H</u>ûhâm, A<u>h</u>shîresh the son of
<span id="page_85">p. 85</span> Ha<u>s</u>bân, <u>S</u>ardâlâ<u>h</u>
the son of Baladân, Merôdâch the son of Beldarân; these four brought
frankincense. Some say that the offerings which the Magi brought and
offered to our Lord had been laid in the Cave of Treasures by Adam<span
id="page_85_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_85_note_1.md); and Adam commanded Seth
to hand them down from one to another until our Lord rose, and they
brought (them), and offered (them) to Him. But this is not received by
the Church. When the Magi came to Jerusalem, the whole city was moved;
and Herod the king heard it and was moved. And he gathered together the
chief priests and the scribes of the people, and enquired about the
place in which Christ should be born; and they told him, in Bethlehem of
Judah, for so it is written in the prophet<span
id="page_85_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_85_note_2.md). Then Herod called the
Magi, and flattered them, and commanded them to seek out the Child
diligently, and when they had found Him to tell Herod, that he also
might go and worship Him. When the Magi went forth from Herod, and
journeyed along the road, the star rose again suddenly, and guided them
until it came and stood over (the place) where the Child was. And when
they entered the cave, and saw the Child with Mary His mother, they
straightway fell down and worshipped Him, and opened their treasures,
and offered unto Him offerings, gold and myrrh and frankincense. Gold
for His kingship, and myrrh for His burial, and frankincense for His
Godhead. And it was revealed to them in a dream that they should not
return to Herod, and they went to their land by another way. Some say
that the Magi took some of our Lord's swaddling bands with them as a
blessed thing<span id="page_85_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_85_note_3.md).

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

   Then Longinus the sage wrote to Augustus Caesar and said to him,
'Magians, kings of Persia, have come and entered thy kingdom, and have
offered offerings to a child who is born in Judah; but who he is, and
whose son he is, is not known to us.' Augustus Caesar wrote to Longinus,
saying, 'Thou hast acted wisely in that thou hast made known to us
(these things) and hast not hidden (them) from us.' He wrote also to
Herod, and asked him to let him know the story of the Child. When Herod
had made enquiries about the Child, and saw that he had been mocked by
the Magi, he was wroth, and sent and slew all the children in Bethlehem
and its borders, from two years old and downwards, according to the time
which he had enquired of the Magi. The number of the children whom he
slew was two thousand, but some say one thousand eight hundred. When
John<span id="page_86_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_86_note_1.md) the son of Zechariah was
sought for, his father took him and brought him before the altar; and he
laid his hand upon him, and bestowed on him the priesthood, and then
brought him out into the wilderness. When they could not find John, they
slew Zechariah his father between the steps<span
id="page_86_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_86_note_2.md) and the altar. They say
that from the day when Zechariah was slain his blood bubbled up until
Titus the son of Vespasian came and slew three hundred myriads of
Jerusalem, and then the flow of blood ceased<span
id="page_86_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_86_note_3.md). The father of the child
Nathaniel also took him, and wrapped him round, and laid him under a
fig-tree; and he was saved from slaughter. Hence our Lord said to
Nathaniel, 'Before Philip called thee, I saw thee, when thou wast under
the fig-tree.'

of the Virgin Mary, given in the notes, is as follows: 'And Mary took
one of the swaddling bands of Jesus, and gave it to the Persian Magi,
and they received it from her in faith as a sublime gift . . . . . .
They held a Magian feast, and made a huge fire, and cast the swaddling
band into the fire, which they worshipped; and the swaddling band became
like fire, and quenched that fire. Then they brought it out from the
fire when it was like snow, even purer than at first. And they took it
and kissed it and laid it upon their eyes, saying, "Verily without doubt
this is the God of gods, for the fire of our god was not able to burn it
or injure it." And they took it with faith and great honour.'
