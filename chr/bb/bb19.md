# CHAPTER XIX<span id="page_29_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_29_note_2).

OF THE INVENTION OF THE INSTRUMENTS FOR WORKING IN IRON<span
id="page_29_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_29_note_3).

   S<span class="small">OME</span> say that Cainan<span
id="page_29_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_29_note_4) and Tubal-cain, who were
of the family of Cain, were the first who invented the three tools of
the art of working in iron, the anvil, hammer and tongs. The art of
working in iron is the mother and begetter of all arts; as the head is
to the body, so is it to all other crafts. And as all the limbs of the
body cease to perform their functions if the head is taken away from it,
so also all other arts would cease if the art of working in iron were to
come to an end. In the days of Tubal and Tubal-cain, the sons of Lamech
the blind, Satan entered and dwelt in them, and they constructed all
kinds of musical instruments, harps and pipes. Some say that spirits
used to go into the reeds and disturb them, and that the sound from them
was like the sound of singing and pipes<span
id="page_29_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_29_note_5); and men constructed all
kinds of musical instruments. Now this blind Lamech was a hunter, and
could shoot <span id="page_30">p. 30</span> straight with a bow; his son
used to take him by the hand, and guide him to places where there was
game, and when he heard the movement of an animal, he shot an arrow at
it, and brought it down. One day, when shooting an arrow at an animal,
he smote Cain the murderer, the son of Adam, and slew him<span

and made all kinds of music: Jubal made flutes and cithers and pipes,
and the devils entered into them and dwelt in them; and when they blew
into them, the devils sang inside the flutes, and made a noise from
within them. And Tubal-cain made cymbals and rattles and hand drums.'
