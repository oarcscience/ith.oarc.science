# CHAPTER LV<span id="page_129_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_129_note_3.md).

OF THE COMING OF THE ANTICHRIST, THE SON OF PERDITION.

   I<span class="small">N</span> a week and half a week<span
id="page_129_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_129_note_4.md) after the destruction of
these wretches shall the son of destruction appear. He shall be
conceived in Chorazin, born in Bethsaida, and reared in Capernaum.
Chorazin shall exult because he was conceived in her, Bethsaida because
he was born in her, and Capernaum because he was brought up in her; for
this reason our Lord proclaimed Woe to these three (cities) in the
Gospel<span id="page_129_fr_5"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">5</span></sup>](#page_129_note_5.md). As soon as the son of
perdition is revealed, the king of the Greeks will go up and stand upon
Golgotha, where our Lord was crucified; and he will set the royal crown
upon the top of the holy Cross, upon which our Lord was <span
id="page_130">p. 130</span> crucified; and he will stretch out his two
hands to heaven; and will deliver over the kingdom to God the Father.
The holy Cross will be taken up to heaven, and the royal crown with it;
and the king will die immediately. The king who shall deliver over the
kingdom to God will be descended from the seed of Kûshath the daughter
of Pîl, the king of the Ethiopians; for Armelaus (Romulus) the king of
the Greeks took Kûshath to wife, and the seed of the Ethiopians was
mingled with that of the Greeks. From this seed shall a king arise who
shall deliver the kingdom over to God, as the blessed David has said,
'Cush will deliver the power to God<span
id="page_130_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_130_note_1.md).' When the Cross is
raised up to heaven, straightway shall every head and every ruler and
all powers be brought to nought, and God will withdraw His providential
care from the earth. The heavens will be prevented from letting fall
rain, and the earth from producing germs and plants; and the earth shall
remain like iron through drought, and the heavens like brass. Then will
the son of perdition appear, of the seed and of the tribe of Dan; and he
will shew deluding phantasms, and lead astray the world, for the simple
will see the lepers cleansed, the blind with their eyes opened, the
paralytic walking, the devils cast out, the sun when he looks upon it
becoming black, the moon when he commands it becoming changed, the trees
putting forth fruit from their branches, and the earth making roots to
grow. He will shew deluding phantasms (of this kind), but he will not be
able to raise the dead. He will go into Jerusalem and will sit upon a
throne in the temple saying, 'I am the Christ;' and he will be borne
aloft by legions of devils like a king and a lawgiver, naming himself
God, and saying, 'I am the fulfilment of the types and the parables.' He
will put an end to prayers and offerings, as if at his appearance
prayers are to be abolished and men will not need sacrifices and
offerings along with him. He becomes a man incarnate by a married woman
of the tribe of Dan. When this son of destruction becomes a man, he will
be made a dwelling-place for devils, and all Satanic workings will be
perfected in him. There will be gathered together with him all the
devils and all the hosts of the Indians; and before all the Indians and
before all men will the mad Jewish nation believe in him, saying, 'This
is the <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> Christ, the expectation of the
world.' The time of the error of the Antichrist will last two years and
a half, but others say three years and six months. And when every one is
standing in despair, then will Elijah (Elias) come from Paradise, and
convict the deceiver, and turn the heart of the fathers to the children
and the heart of the children to the fathers; and he will encourage and
strengthen the hearts of the believers.
