# CHAPTER XLIX.

THE NAMES OF THE APOSTLES IN ORDER<span
id="page_113_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_113_note_3.md).

   T<span class="small">HE</span> names of the twelve. Simon Peter;
Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John his brother; Philip;
Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus;
Labbaeus, who was surnamed Thaddaeus; Simon the Cananite; Judas

   The names of the seventy<span id="page_113_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_113_note_4.md). James, the son of
Joseph; Simon the son of Cleopas; Cleopas his father; Joses; Simon;

id="page_113_fr_6"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">6</span></sup>](#page_113_note_6), who is (mentioned.md) in
the Acts (of the Apostles); Rufus<span
id="page_113_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_113_note_7.md); Alexander; Simon the

Cyrenian; another Judah, who is mentioned in the Acts (of the Apostles);
Judah, who is called Simon; Eurion (Orion) the splay-footed; Thôrus (?);
Thorîsus (?); Zabdon; Zakron. These are the seven<span
id="page_114_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_114_note_1.md) who were chosen with
Stephen: Philip the Evangelist, who had three<span
id="page_114_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_114_note_2.md) daughters that used to
prophesy; Stephen; Prochorus; Nicanor; Timon; Parmenas; Nicolaus<span
id="page_114_fr_3"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">3</span></sup>](#page_114_note_3.md), the Antiochian
proselyte; Andronicus<span id="page_114_fr_4"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">4</span></sup>](#page_114_note_4.md) the Greek; Titus;
Timothy.

   These are the five who were with Peter in Rome: Hermas;
Plîg<u>t</u>â; Patrobas; Asyncritus; Hermas.

   These are the six<span id="page_114_fr_7"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">7</span></sup>](#page_114_note_7.md) who came with Peter to
Cornelius: Criscus<span id="page_114_fr_8"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">8</span></sup>](#page_114_note_8) (Crescens.md); Milichus;
Kîrî<u>t</u>ôn (Crito); Simon; Gaius, who received Paul; Abrazon (?);
Apollos.

   These are the twelve who were rejected from among the seventy, as
Judas Iscariot was from among the twelve, because they absolutely denied
our Lord's divinity at the instigation of Cerinthus. Of these Luke said,
'They went out from us, but they were not of us<span
id="page_114_fr_10"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">10</span></sup>](#page_114_note_10.md);' and Paul called them
'false apostles and deceitful workers<span
id="page_114_fr_11"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">11</span></sup>](#page_114_note_11.md).' Simon; Levi;
Bar-<u>K</u>ubbâ; Cleon; Hymenaeus; Candarus<span
id="page_114_fr_12"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">12</span></sup>](#page_114_note_12); Clithon (?.md); Demas;
Narcissus; Slîkîspus (?); Thaddaeus; Mârûthâ. In their stead there came
in these: Luke the physician; Apollos the elect; Ampelius; Urbanus;
Stachys; Popillius (or Publius)<span
id="page_114_fr_13"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">13</span></sup>](#page_114_note_13.md); Aristobulus; Stephen
(not the Corinthian); Herodion the son of Narcissus; Olympas; Mark the
Evangelist; Addai; Aggai; Mâr Mâri.

   It is said that each one of the twelve and of the seventy wrote a
Gospel; but in order that there might be no contention and that the
<span id="page_115">p. 115</span> number of 'Acts' might not be
multiplied, the apostles adopted a plan and chose two of the seventy,
Luke and Mark, and two of the twelve, Matthew and John.
