## The Book of the Giants

### By W. B. HENNING

 

{[skip to translations](#page_60.md)}

ISAAC DE BEAUSOBRE, the Huguenot author of one of the best books ever
written on Manichæism (*Histoire critique de Manichée et du
Manicheïsme*, Amsterdam, 1734, 1739), was the one to make the only sound
suggestions on the sources used by Mani for the compilation of his *Book
of the Giants:* the *Book of Enoch*, and the *Γραφὴ τω̑ν Γιγάντων* which
Kenan, a great-grandson of Noah, discovered lying in a field (vol. i,
429, n. 6). The latter work has been identified by Alfaric (*Les
Écritures Manichéennes*, ii, 32) with a book whose contents are briefly
indicated in the *Decretum Gelasianum*, p. 54, ll. 298-9 (ed.
Dobschütz): *Liber de Ogia*<span
id="page_52_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_52_note_1.md) *nomine gigante qui post
diluvium cum dracone ab hereticis pugnasse perhibetur apocryphus*. Of
the *Book of Enoch*, which was composed in the Hebrew language in the
second century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, only an Ethiopic
version, a few Greek fragments, and some excerpts made by the Byzantine
chronographer Georgius Syncellus survive.<span
id="page_52_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_52_note_2.md) Mani, who could hardly
read the Hebrew, must have used an Aramaic edition based directly on the
Hebrew text (see below, *Šhmyz’d*). He quotes mainly from the first
part, which Georgius S. (p. 45, Fl.-R.) calls "the first book of Enoch
on the Egrēgoroi", but shows himself acquainted also with the subsequent
chapters.<span id="page_52_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_52_note_3.md)

   It is noteworthy that Mani, who was brought up and spent most of his
life in a province of the Persian empire, and whose mother belonged to a
famous Parthian family,<span
id="page_52_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_52_note_4.md) did not make any use of
the Iranian mythological tradition. There can no longer be any doubt
that the Iranian names of *Sām*, *Narīmān*, etc., that appear in the
Persian and Sogdian versions of the *Book of the Giants*, did not figure
in the original edition, written by Mani in the Syriac language.<span
id="page_52_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_52_note_5.md) His disciples, who, it is
well known, were in the habit of <span id="page_53">p. 53</span>
translating every word of a text (including the names of months,
deities, etc.), seen fit also to "translate" the names of the giants.
Thus *Sām* is merely the translation of *Ohya*. However, they kept some
of the original names (e.g. *Šhmyz’d*), and adapted some others (e.g.
*Wrwgd’d*).<span id="page_53_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_53_note_1.md)

   The story of the fallen angels and their giant sons needed little
adaptation to be fitted into Mani's system. Of course, the heavenly
origin of the *B’nē-hā-Elōhīm*<span
id="page_53_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_53_note_2.md) of Genesis vi, 2, 4, the
*’Εγρήγοροι*, of the *Book of Enoch*, did not square with Mani's
conviction that no evil could come from good. Therefore he transformed
them into "demons", namely those demons that when the world was being
constructed had been imprisoned in the skies under the supervision of
the *Rex Honoris*. They rebelled and were recaptured, but two hundred of
them escaped to the earth. Mani also used the term *’Εγρήγοροι*
(preserved in Coptic, see texts L, M, P, S), or rather *‘yr* in Aramaic
(once in a Middle Persian fragment, text D), but in Eastern sources they
are mostly referred to as "demons" (Pers. *dyw’n*, Parth. *dyw’n* in T
6, Sogd. *δywt* in G, H 17, K 7, *cytyt* in E, *δywt ZY ykšyšt* in H.
16).

   The puzzling clause of Genesis vi, 4: "The Nephilim were on the earth
those days," was interpreted by Mani in this fashion: "when the
Egrēgoroi descended, the animals, or proto-animals, were already in
existence." Mani confused *nəfīlīm* with *nefäl* (*näfäl*) = *ἔκτρωμα*:
see Nöldeke, *ZDMG*., 43 (1889), 536, who rightly referred to the
formula of abjuration (*P.Gr.*, i, 1461) where the giants and the
"abortions" are mentioned in one breath. In Manichæan parlance,
"abortion" (cf. also MPers. *’bg’ng*, Sogd. *pš’q*) is synonymous with
"animal".

   We are therefore left with the *Gibbōrīm*, understood by Mani<span
id="page_53_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_53_note_3.md) as "giants". He probably
used the equivalent Syriac word, *gabbārē* (*gnbr’*), which his
disciples translated as *γίγαντες*, *al-ǰabābirah* in Arabic, MPers. and
Parthian *k’w’n*, Sogd. *kwyšt* = *kawišt* (Sing. *qwy*, *kw’y* =
*kawi*); cf. *Sb.P.A.W.*, 1934, 30. In Sasanian times the words derived
from the Avestan *Kavi* were generally understood as "giant"; see
Benveniste, *MO*., xxvi, 214, and Polotsky in *Mir.Man.*, iii, 901. Thus
MPers. Parth. *k’w* is freely used in Manichæan texts, e.g. of the
Father of Light (M 40), of solar deities, of leading Manichæans (both in
*Mir.Man.*, iii), also of the First Man and Ahriman<span
id="page_53_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_53_note_4.md) with reference to the
First Battle (which therefore could have been described as a
*γιγαντομαχία*).<span id="page_53_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_53_note_5.md)
<span id="page_54">p. 54</span> However, the word *k’w* is applied only
to men and such beings as are imagined anthropomorphous. Where one would
translate *γίγας* as *monster*, the Iranian equivalent is *mzn*,
*Mazan*. Thus the *γίγας τη̑ς θαλάσσης* (*Kephalaia*, 113 and notes),
whose breathing operations are responsible for ebb and flow (cf. also
Beruni, *India*, 203, 10-11), is called *Mzn ‘y* (*z*)*rhyg*<span
id="page_54_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_54_note_1.md) in Middle Persian (M 99, V
22-3). Accordingly, MPers. *mzn* (adj.<span
id="page_54_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_54_note_2) and noun.md) and the related
words, Pahl. *mā̆zan*, *māzanīg*, Sogd. *mzny’n δyw*, Av.
*māzainya-*,<span id="page_54_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_54_note_3.md) should
be rendered as "monster", or "gigantic, monstrous".

   The Egrēgoroi and their giant progeny are fought and vanquished by
four archangels: Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, and Istrael (*Enoch*, 10, 1;
or: Uriel, or: Fanuel). In the *Book of the Giants* they are called "the
four angels". They are frequently invoked by name in Manichæan prayers
(e.g. M 4 d 19, f 6; M 20), as *Rwp’yl*, *Myx’yl*, *Gbr’yl*, and *Sr’yl*
( = Istrael).

   There were no details about individual feats of the giants in the
*Book of Enoch*. Mani filled the gap with the help of the
above-mentioned *Liber de Ogia nomine gigante*. This *Ogias* has been
identified with *Og of Bashan*,<span
id="page_54_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_54_note_4.md) who according to late
sources lived five thousand years and managed to survive the Deluge,
thanks to his giant size.<span
id="page_54_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_54_note_5.md) But possibly stories that
primarily appertained to *Ogias* were transferred to the better known
*Og*, owing to the resemblance of their names. The name of *Ogias* is
*’why’* (*’wḥy’*) = *Ohyā̆* (*Oḥyā̆*) in the Manichæan fragments, and this
spelling is presumably more correct than that of *Ogias*. *Og* (*‘wg*)
indubitably would appear as *’wg* (or: *‘wg*). Since Mani took *’why’*
from an Aramaic text, the ending of *Ogias* cannot be regarded as a
Greek addition.

   Ogias fought with a *draco*, and so did Ohya; his enemy was the
Leviathan (text N). Ohya and his brother Ahya were the sons of *Šhmyz’d*
(text H), i.e. *Στμιαζα̑ς*, the chief of the Egrēgoroi in the *Book of
Enoch*; hence, *Στμιαζα̑ς* is transcription of *šhm-* (or *šḥm* ?). In
the Persian edition of the *Kawān* Ohya and Ahya are "translated" as
*Sām* and *Narīmān*, but the original names are kept in one passage (A
60). The translator did well to choose Sām-Krsāsp, both with regard to
Ogias' longevity (Sām is one of the "Immortals") and to his fight with
the dragon (Sām is a famous dragon-killer). In the Sogdian <span
id="page_55">p. 55</span> fragments the name of Sām is spelt *S’hm* =
*Sāhm*, as it is often in Pahlavi (*S’hm*<span
id="page_55_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_55_note_1) beside *S’m*.md); Ṭabari has
*Shm*,<span id="page_55_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_55_note_2.md) cf.
Christensen, *Kayanides*, p. 130. Sāhm's brother is *Pāt-Sāhm*. This
name may have been invented by the Sogdian translator in order to keep
the names of the brothers resembling each other. Narīmān was evidently
not known in Sogdiana as a brother of Sām. According to the *Book of the
Giants*, the main preoccupation of Sām-Sāhm was his quarrel the giant
*Māhawai*,<span id="page_55_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_55_note_3.md) the son of
*Virōgdād*, who was one of the twenty ers of the Egrēgoroi.

   *The Book of the Giants* was published in not less than six or seven
languages. From the original Syriac the Greek and Middle Persian
versions were made. The Sogdian edition was probably derived from the
Middle Persian, the Uygur from the Sogdian. There is no trace of a
Parthian text.<span id="page_55_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_55_note_4.md) The
book may have existed in Coptic. The presence of names such as Sām and
Narīmān in the Arabic version proves that it had been translated from
the Middle Persian. To the few surviving fragments (texts A-G) I have
added two excerpts, the more important of which (H) probably derives
from a Syriac epitome of the book. Naturally, Manichæan authors quoted
the book frequently, but there is only one direct citation by a
non-Manichæan writer (text O). With the exception of text O, all the
passages referring to the *Book of the Giants* (texts J-T) go back to
Syriac writings (apparently). They are, therefore, to be treated as
quotations from the Syriac edition. E.g. the Parthian text N is not the
product of a Parthian writer who might have employed a Parthian version
of the book, but was translated from a Syriac treatise whose author
cited the Syriac text.

   In their journey across Central Asia the stories of the *Book of the
Giants* were influenced by local traditions. Thus, the translation of
Ohya as Sām had in its train the introduction of myths appertaining to
that Iranian hero; this explains the "immortality" of Sā(h)m according
to text I. The country of *Aryān-Vēžan* = *Airyana Vaēǰah*, in text G
(26), is a similar innovation.<span
id="page_55_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_55_note_5.md) The "Kögmän mountains" in
text B may reflect the "Mount Hermon". The progeny of the fallen angels
was confined in thirty-six towns (text S). Owing to the introduction of
the Mount Sumeru, this number was changed <span id="page_56">p.
56</span> (in Sogdiana) to *thirty-two* (text G, 22): "the heaven of
Indra . . . is situated between the four peaks (cf. G 21) of the Meru,
and consists of *thirty-two* cities of devas" (Eitel, *Handb. Chinese
Buddhism*, 148, on *Trayastriṃśat*).

*A. Middle-Persian*

   M 101, *a* to *n*, and M 911, fifteen fragments of a book, throughout
small pieces from the centre of the pages. It has proved impossible, so
far, to re-establish the original order of the pages. On purely
technical grounds (size of the fragments, appearance of the margins,
relative position of tears, stains, etc.), I at first assumed the
following sequence: l-j-k-g-i-c-e-b-h-f-a-d-m-M 911-n. Being unable to
estimate the cogency of these technical reasons now, because of the
absence of any photographic material, I have decided to change the order
of the first six fragments in the following way: c-j-l-k-g-i, in view of
their contents.<span id="page_56_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_56_note_2.md)
Unfortunately we do not know in what order Mani had told the story of
the giants. The task of finding the original order is made still more
difficult by the fact that besides the *Kawān* the book contained one or
two more treatises, namely: (1) Parables referring to the Hearers, and
possibly (2) a discourse on the Five Elements (here (1) = lines 160 to
the end, and (2) = lines 112-159). The only fragments that undoubtedly
belonged to the *Kawān* are c-j-l-k-g-i, while the position of the
fragments e-b-h is particularly doubtful. It must be borne in mind that
whole folios may be missing between apparently successive pages. In
order to enable the reader to judge for himself, all the fragments
(including the parables) are published here. The text is based on a copy
I made nearly ten years ago (referred to in the notes as: Copy); a
revision is not possible under the present circumstances.

*Kamsarakan-k‘* (mentioned often in the Armenian history of the fourth
century) who claimed descent from the royal house of the Arsacids. This
is clear from the Chinese-Manichæan text that preceded the *Fragment
Pelliot*, now printed in the Taishô Tripiṭaka as No. 2141a, vol. 54, p.
1280A, but hitherto untranslated: "He was born in the country of Sulin (
= Babylonia), in the royal abode of *B‘uât-tiei* ( = *Patī-g*), by his
wife *Muân-i̯äm* ( = *Maryam*) of the family of *Ki̯əm-sât-g‘i̯ɒn* ( =
*Kamsar*(*a*)*gān*)." The name Κάρασσα in the Byzantine formula of
abjuration (Migne, *Patr. Gr.*, i, 1468) may be corrupted from
*Kamsar-*. Thus there is a grain of truth in the assertion in the *K.
al-Fihrist*, 327, 31, that Mani's mother had belonged to the Arsacid
house; ibid., *Maryam* (ed, *marmaryam*) is given as one of her
names.—It is not proposed to discuss the origin of Mani's father here.

refers neither to the Manich. "First Battle", nor to Mani's *Book of the
Giants*, as Cumont, *Rech.*, i, 3; ii, 160 sq., erroneously states.
Cumont goes so far as to say that in the quoted passage Alexander had
given a summary of Mani's work, and Benveniste, *MO*., xxvi, 213, has
repeated this statement. In fact, Alexander says that experts in Greek
mythology might quote, from <span id="footnotes_page_54">p. 54</span>
the Greek poets, the *Greek γιγαντομαχία*, as a *parallel* to the
Manich. doctrine of the rising by the Hyle against God. In ch. 25 (p.
37, 13 sqq.) Alexander explains that such poetical fables about giants
could not be regarded as a satisfactory parallel, because they were
myths and meant to be understood as allegories. He then (37, 17) quotes
the story of *Genesis* vi, 2-4, which he provides with an allegorical
explanation. But he ascribes it to the *History of the Jews* without
even mentioning the *Book of the Giants*. This shows conclusively that
he had no knowledge of Mani's book.

decide whether this fragment should be placed at the end or at the
beginning of the book. The 400,000 Righteous may have perished when the
Egrēgoroi descended to the earth. The "choosing of beautiful women",
etc., strongly suggests the misbehaviour of the Egrēgoroi on their
arrival upon the earth. The hard labour imposed on the Mesenians and
other nations may be due to the insatiable needs of their giant progeny
(*Enoch*, 7, 2 sqq.). On the other hand, "fire, naphtha, and brimstone"
are only mentioned as the weapons with which the archangels overcame the
Egrēgoroi, after a prolonged and heavy fight (Text G, 38), and the
400,000 Righteous may well have been the innocent non-combatant victims
of this battle which may have had a demoralizing effect even upon the
*electae*. To clear up the debris the archangels would naturally
commandeer the men. We do not know whether Mani believed Enoch to have
been moved out of sight (*ἐλήμφθη Enoch*, 12, 1) before the Egrēgoroi
appeared, or before they were punished.

the same manuscript ("T i"), not however belonging to the *Kawān*, show
that there were three columns to a page; hence, the correct order of the
columns is: BCDEFA. Perhaps this text, too, is not a fragment of the
*Kawān*.\]

<span id="footnotes_page_67">p. 67</span>

<span id="page_67_note_1"></span>[1](#page_67_fr_1.md) *murzīdan* is
"persecute, harass", not "show pity" as hitherto translated (*S* 9;
*Mir.Man.*, ii; *W.-L.*, ii, 556, r 6).

<span id="page_67_note_2"></span>[2](#page_67_fr_2.md) *ghwd* (*Mir.Man.*,
ii), *ghwdg’n* (*Mir.Man.*, i), *ghwyn-* (*ZII*., ix, 183, 27): the
derivation of these words from *vi* + *hū* by Schaeder, *Sb.P.A.W.*,
1935, 492, n. 3, is based on the translation I had given; this
translation, however, was based on nothing but this selfsame etymology.

<span id="footnotes_page_68">p. 68</span>

<span id="page_68_note_1"></span>[1](#page_68_fr_1.md) This passage in
particular seems to show that the text is a fragment of the *Kawān*.
There are two groups of sinners here: one is (apparently) to be
transferred from a preliminary fire-prison to the permanent hell at the
end of the world ( = the Egrēgoroi), the other consists of the
*κίβδηλοι* ( = Giants). The digression on their final fate in the great
conflagration, under the eyes of the self-satisfied Righteous (cf.
*Šābuhragān*, *M* 470 *V*), is well in keeping with Mani's discursive
style.

<span id="page_68_note_2"></span>[2](#page_68_fr_2.md) *w’y-* (different
from Parth. *w’y-* "to lead") = "to fly" or "to hunt" ? Cf. *w’ywg*
"hunter" (*BBB*., where the translation should be changed), *Air. Wb.*
1356, 1407.

<span id="page_68_note_3"></span>[3](#page_68_fr_3.md) My pupil I.
Gershevitch thinks *prβ’r* should be derived from *prβyr-*. It is true
that "explanation, announcement" fits most passages better than
"chariot"! Hence, Mahāyāna rendered as "the great announcement" ?

<span id="footnotes_page_69">p. 69</span>

<span id="page_69_note_3"></span>[3](#page_69_fr_3.md) *Enoch*, 17,1: *ὅταν
θέλωσιν φαίνονται ὡσεὶ ἄνθρωποι. pts’δ*, cf. Skt. *praticchanda-*.

<span id="page_69_note_4"></span>[4](#page_69_fr_4.md) viz. the human
associates of the demons, esp. the "daughters of men".

<span id="page_69_note_5"></span>[5](#page_69_fr_5.md) viz. the giants and
their children ? Or merely the children of the giants ? See below, *S*.
to Syncellus (*apud Fl.-R.*, p. 25) there were three generations: (1)
the giants, (2) the Nephīlīm, their sons, and (3) the Eliud, their
grandsons. In the *Book of Enoch* the giants are killed, or rather
incited to kill each other, before the Egrēgoroi are punished (ch. 10).
Their spirits shall roam the world, until the day of judgement, as
*πνεύματα πονηρά* (15,8-16,1).

<span id="page_69_note_6"></span>[6](#page_69_fr_6.md) This passage shows
that the Sogdian text had been translated from either Middle-Persian or
Parthian (MPers. *ky myhryzd ’c nwx ’wyš’n r’y wyn’rd bwd*, Parthian *ky
w’d jywndg ’c nwx hwyn wsn’d wyr’št bwd*).

<span id="page_69_note_7"></span>[7](#page_69_fr_7.md) *’nδyk* probably =
skill, art, ability (differently, *BBB*., p. 105).

<span id="page_69_note_8"></span>[8](#page_69_fr_8.md) See above, A 97.

<span id="page_69_note_9"></span>[9](#page_69_fr_9.md) Fairly cursive,
difficult to read.

<span id="page_69_note_10"></span>[10](#page_69_fr_10.md) Probably by

<span id="page_70_note_3"></span>[3](#page_70_fr_3.md) See above, G 28-9,
and below, text M. According to *Enoch*, ch. 8, the fallen angels
imparted to mankind unholy arts and undesirable knowledge, e.g.
astrology, cosmetics, soothsaying, metallurgy, production of weapons,
even the art of writing (ch. 69, 9).

<span id="footnotes_page_71">p. 71</span>

<span id="page_71_note_2"></span>[2](#page_71_fr_2.md) Presumably the
stellar demons.

<span id="page_71_note_3"></span>[3](#page_71_fr_3.md) Cf. *JRAS*. 1942,
232 n. 6.

<span id="page_71_note_4"></span>[4](#page_71_fr_4.md) If Mani's famous
*Ertenk* was indeed a picture-book, this *Vifrās* may well have been the
explanatory text published together with it; cf. Polotsky's suggestion,
*Man. Hom.*, 18, n. 1, on Mani's *εἰκών* (but see *BBB*., pp. 9 sq.).
There is no reason for "identifying" the *Ertenk* with Mani's
*Evangelion* (Schaeder, *Gnomon*, 9, 347). The fragments of the *Vifrās*
(M 35, M 186, M 205, M 258, M 740, T ii K, T iii D 278) will be
published at some other opportunity.

<span id="footnotes_page_72">p. 72</span>

<span id="page_72_note_1"></span>[1](#page_72_fr_1.md) The point is that A
eats or kills B, after B had finished C. A man killed his brother over
the treaaure, but was killed by a third party, etc. The Great Fire will
devour the bodily fire which had swallowed the "exterior fire". Hence,
Ohya killed Leviathan, but was killed by Raphael.

<span id="page_72_note_2"></span>[2](#page_72_fr_2.md) St. Wikander,
*Vayu*, i \[1941\], 166, quotes my article on Enoch, and my paper in
*ZDMG*., 1936, p. 4, and remarks that *eigentuemlicherweise* I had
forgotten Al-Ghaḍanfar's notice on Sām and Narīmān. Less careless
readers will find Ghaḍanfar's notice quoted *in extenso* on the page
cited by Wikander.

<span id="footnotes_page_73">p. 73</span>

<span id="page_73_note_1"></span>[1](#page_73_fr_1.md) See above, A 98.

<span id="page_73_note_2"></span>[2](#page_73_fr_2.md) Cf. above. A 105
sqq.

<span id="page_73_note_3"></span>[3](#page_73_fr_3.md) Presumably the
number of years supposed to have passed from the time of Enoch to the
beginning of the reign of Vištāsp. The date for Enoch was probably
calculated with the help of the Jewish world-era, or the mundane era of
Alexandria (beginning 5493 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), or by
counting backwards from the Deluge. Taking 3237 <span
class="small">B.C.</span> (but 3251 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
according to the Coptic chronology) as the date of the Deluge (see S. H.
Taqizadeh, *BSOS*., X, 122, under *c*), and adding 669 ( = from Enoch's
death to the Deluge according to the Hebrew Genesis), and subtracting
the number in our fragment, 3,28\[8 ?\], from 3,237 + 669 = 3,906, the
resulting date, 618 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, agrees perfectly
with the traditional Zoroastrian date for the beginning of Vištāsp's
reign (258 + 30 years before Alexander's conquest of Persia, 330 B.C.;
cf. Taqizadeh, ibid., 127 sq.). From this one may infer that the famous
date for Zoroaster: "258 years before Alexander" was known to Mani
(Nyberg, *Rel. Alt. Iran*, 32 sqq., thinks it was invented towards the
beginning of the fifth century).

<span id="page_73_note_4"></span>[4](#page_73_fr_4.md) The name is possibly
to be restored in *Türk. Man.*, iii, p. 39, No. 22, R 5, where
*wy.t’δlp* was read by LeCoq.

<span id="page_73_note_5"></span>[5](#page_73_fr_5.md) In quoting this text
in *ZDMG*., 90, p. 5, I took *wyjn* for what it seemed to be, viz.
*Vēžan*. But as the appearance of *Bēžan* in connection with Vištāspa is
incomprehensible, I have now restored \[*’ry’*\]*n-wyjn*, see above, G
26.

<span id="footnotes_page_74">p. 74</span>

<span id="page_74_note_1"></span>[1](#page_74_fr_1.md) For the spelling,
cf. *kwdws apud* Theodore bar Kōnay.

<span id="page_74_note_2"></span>[2](#page_74_fr_2.md) *’mwst* = *amwast* =
believer, faithful (not "sad" !), from *hmwd-*, Arm. *havat-*.

<span id="page_74_note_4"></span>[4](#page_74_fr_4.md) Hardly "food" or
"banquet" ? Cf. Parth. *’wxrn*, etc. Also Budd. Sogd. *’wγr-* (*’wγ’r-*)
Impf. *w’γr-*, Inf. *’wγ’wrt*, etc.) "to abandon" (*SCE*., 562; *Dhuta*,
41; P2, 97, 219; P 7, 82; etc., appears to be of no use here.

*ǰehāniyān*.

<span id="page_74_note_6"></span>[6](#page_74_fr_6.md) Cf. *Vd*., ii, 20 ?
But the Manich. fragment appears to describe the election of Yima to the
sovereignty over the world.

n. 4.

<span id="page_74_note_8"></span>[8](#page_74_fr_8.md) *šyrn’m* is a
*karmadhāraya*, = acclamation(s), cheering, cf. e.g. *Rustam frg.* (P
13, 5) *prw RBkw šyrn’m* "with loud cheers"; it should not be confused
with the *bahuvrīhi šyrn’m’k* "well-reputed, famous" (e.g. Reichelt, ii,
68, 9; *šyrn’m’y*, ibid., 61, 2, cf. *BBB*., 91, on *a* 11). But
*šyrn’m* is also "(good) fame", see e.g. *V.J.*, 156, 168, 1139.
