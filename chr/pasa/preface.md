## PREFACE

<span class="smallcaps">the </span><span style="font-size:11.5pt;
color:black">delivery of these lectures was one of the last pieces of
work that Neville Figgis was allowed to carry through. He prepared them
for the press, leaving them in the form of lectures and preserving here
and there the impress which the anxiety of war-crisis made upon them. In
that form, therefore, they are published now. In place of the final
revision which his failing health prevented him from making, another
hand has tried unskilfully to supply what he would have done with skill,
in order to carry out his wishes and make his last complete piece of
work accessible to a wider public than those who heard the lectures
delivered.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"></span>
