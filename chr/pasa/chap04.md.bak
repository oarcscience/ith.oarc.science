## THE CHURCH

WHAT then is S. Augustine's view of the place of the Church in relation
to civil society? This is part of the topic of the last lecture. Only
to-day we look at the matter from a different angle. Here too, a
*caveat* must be entered. We must beware of treating anything said of
the *Civitas Dei* as though it could be applied to the existing
ecclesiastical system. Much of it can. Yet the *Civitas Dei* in its
strict sense is not the Visible Church. It is the *communio sanctorum,*
the body of the elect, many of whom are to be found in pre-Christian
times or in heathen peoples--while from this body many among the
baptised will be excluded.\[<a href="#foot01" id="text01">1</a>\] This
*communio sanctorum* is the true recipient of the promises to David and
of the gifts of eternal peace and beatitude, those promises which
Augustine sets forth with moving eloquence in Book XX. The Visible
Militant Church is never more than a part of either--nor does it ever
attain. Its peace and beatitude are in hope. It is always *in via.* It
is but the symbolic and inadequate representative of the *Civitas
Dei,*but it uses the peace provided by the earthly
State.\[<a href="#foot02" id="text02">2</a>\] Still we must beware of
laying too much stress on this. Reuter overstrains it. Augustine, it
appears to be proved, is the first of the fathers to declare that the
Church is the Kingdom of God on earth. The most important of the
passages is that in XX. 9. There Augustine is arguing for the
identification of the Church with the millennial kingdom (as against the
Chiliasts) and for the rulers of the Church sitting on thrones. He says
explicitly:

'Ergo ecclesia et nunc est regnum Christi regnumque caelorum.'
\[<a href="#foot03" id="text03">3</a>\]

Other passages also state this identification of the Church with the
*Civitas Dei.* Reuter will have it that all these are to be understood
of the Church only as *communio
sanctorum*.\[<a href="#foot04" id="text04">4</a>\] Therefore we must
rule out every inference that might be drawn from the application of the
idea of the Kingdom to the actual Church Militant. This interpretation
cannot be proved. There is little doubt, from the context, that
Augustine was thinking, as Scholz and Seidel say, of the Church as a
visible, comprehensible body, hierarchically organised.

Dr. Cunningham's Hulsean Lectures afford us an instance of the opposite
view (p. 116).

'For S. Austin the Kingdom of God was not a mere hope, but a present
reality; not a mere name for a divine idea, but an institution, duly
organised among men, subsisting from one generation to another; closely
inter-connected with earthly rule, with definite guidance to give, and a
definite part to take, in all the affairs of actual life. To him the
Kingdom of God was an actual Polity, just as the Roman Empire was a
Polity too; it was "visible" in just the same way in the earthly State,
for it was a real institution with a definite organisation, with a
recognised constitution, with a code of laws and means of enforcing
them, with property for its uses and officers to direct it.'

Here then are the two opposing views. I take another Point. Both Reuter
and Troeltsch argue that while Augustine accepted the authority of the
Church and had no wish to change it--they were the presuppositions of
his life as a Christian--yet he meant little by them:

that his emphasis upon predestination makes against any high view of
ecclesiastical order. Repeatedly in his writings, *e.g.* in the 'De
Catechizandis Rudibus,' Augustine lays stress on the fact that the elect
will include men of all nations and every age. At the beginning of the
'De Civitate' he declares that the *Civitas Dei* began with the
beginning of the world. Reuter (who is a Protestant) goes so far as to
say, that of all early Catholic writers hardly any is so little
hierarchically minded as Augustine. It is true that Augustine takes
little interest in hierarchical topics. Never, so far as I know, does he
develop the theory of the episcopate in the way in which S. Cyprian did.
When he thinks of the Church, it is of the whole body of the faithful.
It is the bigness of it that appeals to him, and to which he appeals.
Whatever his views in favour of small States, in regard to the Church he
is imperialist enough; he is opposed to all particularism. It is to this
sense of universality, rather than to that of the episcopate, that he
appeals. Still, it is of the Church as an organised body, hierarchically
governed, that he thinks in his controversy with the Donatists. His
strong views of the predestination of individuals no more upset his
scheme of a visible Church than did those of Calvin. Calvin threw over
the ancient system, and rejected both the Papacy and the Episcopacy; but
no less strongly than S. Augustine did he hold to a doctrine of a
Visible Church and its authority. So did the Jansenists. It seems little
short of ridiculous to deny that the notion of the Church loomed large
to Augustine's imagination, much larger than it did to that of Origen
and the earlier apologists; or that, along with the doctrine of original
sin, it was the pivot of his
system.\[<a href="#foot05" id="text05">5</a>\] It had been to the
Catholic Church that he had been converted after trying many
experiments.

Rightly has it been pointed out by
Schmidt\[<a href="#foot06" id="text06">6</a>\] and
Weinand\[<a href="#foot07" id="text07">7</a>\] that it was the Donatist
schism that aroused the Church as a society to full self-consciousness.
All the earlier heresies concerned high doctrine. Certain statements
about our Lord or the Trinity were, or were alleged to be, false. In
opposition to them, the Church is primarily a teacher. But the Donatists
were not heretics in the ordinary sense. Or rather their heresy was on
the topic of the Church. Augustine was faced with (*a*) a doctrine of
the sacraments which reduced religion to personal influence and is, in
our modern phrase, radically Protestant; and (*b*) with the claim of the
Donatist schism to be the true Church of Africa. Against these claims he
was forced to develop the idea of the Church as being something more
than a company of believers, as the sphere of God's work, the *Civitas
Dei*; and of the sacraments as God's work done by human agents, the
character of whom no more affected their validity than does that of an
officer in the army the validity of his orders. Further, the Church as a
universal world-wide polity is opposed to all particularist, nationalist
tendencies. In the early years of the fifth century it looked as though
Donatism was to be the national religion of Africa. This contest was a
conflict between Catholicity in its very idea, and conceptions which
were its antithesis.

These ideas of S. Augustine need not have been new. It is not their
novelty which makes the difference, but the emphasis with which they are
stressed. Further, the term *Civitas Dei* is itself significant. This is
not new. It can be seen in the New Testament, in Hebrews, and the
Apocalypse. The vogue given to these words now caused more and more
assimilation of the Church to a State. All the qualifications were left
out of account. This process led to a political habit of treating the
Church. By the mere use of the terms *civitas* and *regnum* in a work of
such momentous influence, Augustine prepared the way for the later
development of the doctrine that the Church is a *societas perfecta,*
and must have the powers necessary to any self-sufficing community. The
conception of the Church as a social entity wielding governing powers
owes much to S. Augustine. He did much to strengthen the Church as an
imperial force.

If we take two nineteenth-century writers, one in the East and one in
the West, who thought much about the Church, Khomiakoff and Newman, what
a wide gulf there is between them! Newman's sermons, in the volume of
the famous fifteen on the Church as an imperial power, show how far the
West has gone in this political way of thinking about the Church.
Augustine may be said to have been one of the great forces which began
this development. Meanwhile the East remained as it had been, preserving
the view that the laity form a real part of the organisation.

Ritschl thought that Augustine's emphasis on the Church was the
necessary corollary of the doctrine of original sin--the setting up of
the society of grace. I cannot see this. Grace might be conceived as
acting merely on the individual; and all importance be denied to the
Church. Some even have based such a doctrine on S. Augustine.

But he did think that the Church, the Visible Church, recruited by
baptism, nourished by sacraments, governed by bishops, was the one true
family of God ; and that Christianity meant belonging to that family.
The actual expression *extra ecclesiam nulla salus* is not his. But the
principle he definitely states. When you add to this the view that the
Church was the *regnum Dei,* and that the millennial kingdom of Christ
was exercised by the rulers of the Church, you can see how much was
latent in S. Augustine of the political aspect of Christianity.

More momentous is Augustine's treatment of the Church as the apocalyptic
kingdom. This doctrine he develops against the Chiliasts, scouting their
notion of an earthly physical reign of our Lord visible on earth. The
opposing party was important at that time, and some alternative
interpretation of the biblical passages was needed. Augustine seems to
have taken the doctrine from Tyconius. This Tyconius was a Donatist with
whom Augustine stood on friendly terms. Moreover, he had quarrelled with
those of the more extreme tendencies. Augustine indeed wonders why he
did not become a Catholic. In the 'Rules of Tyconius' we have found (as
I said earlier) Augustine's doctrine of the two Cities, and the
conception of the bipartite character of the City of God, *i.e.*
consisting of the elect and the foredoomed. Above all, Augustine's
interpretation of the Apocalypse is found to be derived from Tyconius,
who wrote a treatise on the Apocalypse, which now has been lost, but has
been partly restored by conjecture.

The point of this exposition is that the millennial kingdom is already
in existence. It is a reign, therefore, that does not involve the
physical presence of Christ. In other words, the Second Coming is the
Church. The First Resurrection has already taken place in the conversion
of sinners and in their baptism. It is a spiritual act, not a physical
resurrection. In his interpretation of Scripture Augustine oscillates
between extreme literalism and a remarkable freedom. The martyrs are
those who reign with Christ. The thrones belong to the rulers of the
Church. This kingdom has been in existence ever since Christianity
spread beyond Judaea. It has nothing to do with the peace of the Church
and the cessation of persecution, still less with the legal
establishment of Christianity. Neither persecution nor any other earthly
act affects this.

The ground for rejecting Chiliasm is that it postulates an absence of
earthly trials in this life--a thing which Augustine declares to be no
less impossible for saints than anyone else: and for that reason the
promises that there shall be no more sorrow nor crying can apply only to
the Church Triumphant. Now this argument cuts two ways. If the Church be
the Kingdom of God, it may, it is held, justify claims to paramount
supremacy, and lead to a great Church-State. A more natural
interpretation points the other way. If Christ has been reigning on
earth, through the Church, ever since the days of Antioch, then he was
reigning all through the period of persecution. Therefore for the Church
to exercise any political supremacy, or even secure any recognition of
its existence, are shown to be things indifferent. The royalty of the
Church, 'the peculiar people, the holy nation, the royal priesthood,'
the power on earth of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, is of the
same nature as that of which Christ spoke when He answered Pilate's
satirical question--'Art thou a King then 'with' My Kingdom is not of
this world.' The Kingdom of God cometh not by observation, and its
authority is in the souls of men, not in any outward political
structure. It was regal in her days of security, regal when she was a
distinct society in the second century, regal when she was assailed by
the whole might of Rome under Diocletian, regal when having conquered by
stooping she enjoyed a guaranteed security, regal when under Julian that
security was threatened once more, or when under Arians, like
Constantius or Valens, it was undermined from within, regal no more and
no less than it had been previously now that after the laws of Gratian
and Theodosius she had become not merely tolerated but established, not
merely established but the exclusive official religion of the Empire.

The Church is a kingdom not of this world. Augustine goes out of his way
to say that kings and princes cannot make the City of God, which comes
by the calling of souls. Once more it must be said that Augustine was
not thinking how to build Jerusalem in Afric's bright and sunny land,
but how to wean men from 'crying "peace, peace" when there was no
peace,' from seeking in any earthly refuge that abiding home which
remaineth for the people of God. Richard Baxter's great book, 'The
Saints' Everlasting Rest,' reflects the aim and many of the ideas of S.
Augustine or the famous poem of Bernard of Murles, from which is taken
the hymn 'Jerusalem the Golden.' This non-political interpretation of
the symbolic kingdom is seen to be that which is in accordance with the
mind of S. Augustine, if we take the book as a whole. It is what he
meant to mean; whether it is always what his words did mean, is another
question.

But evidence that tells on the other side is not to be neglected. First,
it is obviously possible to put a clericalist interpretation upon the
passages about justice. Next, it must be remembered that he speaks of
the good that has been done to the Church by Christian kings. In reply
to Petilian he says that he does not give unreserved trust to the State,
but makes use of it. He admits the change which had come over the Empire
since Constantine. He says that, since ruling is the *métier* of
princes, they, if they come over to the Church, must forward her
interests by laws in her favour. In other places he speaks of the duty
of the civil governor to do what the Church requires in her interests.
Now one commentator thinks that all this amounts to not much less than
the comparison of Church and State to sun and moon, which was first
found, I think, in Hildebrand,\[<a href="#foot08" id="text08">8</a>\]
and became so dear to the Middle Ages. But I confess that I can see
nothing here that in any sense approaches to the doctrine of the two
swords, or even to the famous argument of Gelasius.

The Church was not yet in a condition even of parity with the civil
power. Augustine does not think of the civil and ecclesiastical
authorities as two co-ordinate Powers occupied in governing. Even in
dream he had not the great vision of mediæval imagination, the one
commonwealth of Catholic Christians, with its twin heads of Pope and
Emperor; though he does say that there is one *respublica* of all
Christians. It is doubtful whether he hoped to convert the heathen by
force, though he asks the Donatists whether they did not agree with him
in approving the imperial laws against heathen sacrifice. Augustine
appeals to the unity of the Church, the *Civitas Dei* alike in morals
and thought and sets this against the intellectual and moral anarchy of
the terrene State; yet he is not at that moment thinking of an imperial
Christ-state, but pointing to actual phenomena as a modern Roman
Catholic in England or the United States might do. Yet it is not
doubtful that it was possible in later times, and indeed natural, to
press all this into the service of the hierarchical organisation of the
world.

Most of Augustine's writing is not in the tone of a ruling Church, but
rather of a body officially predominant, though everywhere attacked. His
attitude to Count Boniface is not like that of the mediæval popes.

It is the other world with which he is concerned. He might have called
his book 'The Gospel of the Resurrection.' The 'De Civitate Dei' is
chargeable with whatever plaints can be made against a tendency to
other-world lines. The strongest passage on this point is not to be
found there, but in the 'De Bono Conjugali.' Answering the objection
that if his views were correct, and if enough people became converted to
the celibate life, the world could not go on being peopled, for no
children would be born, he replies: 'That would be a blessing. It would
mean that the number of the elect would be filled up, and the kingdom of
God accomplished'--in the language of our Burial Service. This
presumably alludes to the theory that the world need only go on until
the number of elect required to fill up the vacancies caused by the
falling of the angels had been made up. That was the object of the
creation--to fill up the gaps in heaven. The rest do not matter. God
would not keep the factory of the world running for the sake of the
waste-products. You may fairly urge against S. Augustine the kind of
reproaches that figure in the Pagan's Lament in Swinburne's poem:

        'Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean, and the world has  
            grown grey with Thy breath;  
        We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the kisses  
            of death.'

But it is a different charge to make him 'the only begetter' of the
Bull,

Unam sanctam.

That is not to deny that there are weighty considerations in favour of
such a view. Were there not, we could never have such strong words as
those of Kattenbusch, who speaks of him as the Father of the Papacy.
Geirke holds that the logical development of the Augustinian doctrine
involves the complete subjection of the State to the
Church.\[<a href="#foot09" id="text09">9</a>\] Similar are the views of
Dorner, Schmidt, Eicken and many
more.\[<a href="#foot10" id="text10">10</a>\] Their views are stronger
evidence of what Augustine meant, than is the constant use that was made
of him by mediæval thinkers. The mediæval habit of taking tags as
text-proofs, apart from the general purpose of the writer, discounts
their value as evidence. Besides this there was an immediate polemical
interest at stake.

For this purpose we must go further. The 'De Civitate Dei' needs for its
interpretation the writings against the Donatists. In that conflict
Augustine was led to accept the assistance of the civil power. So far as
I can make out, he was never very happy about this proceeding, and felt
that it needed apology. Partly, this feeling was due to the fact that
his action indicated a definite change of mind. In early days, and in
regard to the controversy with the Manichæans, Augustine had forgone all
such things, and argued in favour of freedom of opinion. This was a
change, and one which he had to explain. So far as the Donatists were
concerned, he had an easy task. From them indeed any objection to the
employment of force was little short of an impertinence. They had
themselves appealed to the civil power. Only when the appeal was
rejected had they turned round and cried 'hands off' to the State.
Besides the violence of the Circumcellions, if not precisely authorised,
was largely used by them. Much of what was done on the side of the
Church was only an attempt often ineffectual, to secure that the peace
should be kept. This attempt had been largely frustrated through the
intimacy between Optatus and the Count Gildo.

Augustine did not confine his defence to these limits. He produced a
definite argument in favour of force in religious matters. Most of it he
bases on the verse 'Compel them to come in.' He does not want opinion
forced. He thinks that penalty is useful, because it makes a man
reflect, and often give up his view as erroneous. It is, in fact,
educational, and, in his view, precisely similar to the use of the rod.
It is persecution for the soul's good. Augustine's conception of the
office of the State is largely that of an educator.

Out of this acceptance of persecution it is easy to develop a theory of
civil domination. The State is to use force. That is its duty. It is to
extend the province of the Kingdom of God on earth. Remember, it is not,
as it was later on, conceived as being the 'secular arm' of the Church.
If the civil Governor is to persecute heresy, who is to advise him? He
cannot do so on his own motion. Obviously, the Church, organised through
its governors, will advise him. The moment you accept persecution as a
policy, you tend to a religious tyranny. The State may still be
conceived as having self-identity of its own--as it was in the
Presbyterian doctrine of the two kingdoms. But if it be bound to take
orders from the Church in regard to religious matters, it will not be
long before there will be a claim to direct the State in regard to any
policy that may have a religious, or a moral, or an ecclesiastical
bearing. How much will be left out?

Add to this the inferences that may be drawn from justice (as Augustine
defines it) as being needful to a perfect commonwealth. If the only true
commonwealth be that in which Christ is King, and if that is to mean
that the worship of God in Christ is not merely to be allowed, but to be
enjoined by law, then you must have a theocratic State. It depends
merely on what form of organisation the Church has, as to who shall have
the last word. In a democratic system you might have the whole body of
the faithful. In a hierarchical Church you might have either a General
Assembly as in Scotland, or a General Council of bishops--or the Pope.
As we saw last time, that notion of justice is not at all S. Augustine's
own doctrine of the State. But it was sufficiently near it for men to
take it apart from the rest; and, together with other indications, to
make it serve the ends of the clericalism of the later Middle Ages.

Even more is this true with regard to the conception of the Church as
the apocalyptic kingdom. If the Church be, here and now, in enjoyment of
its millennial glory, then the largest terms of supremacy that can be
brought out of the Apocalypse may be interpreted literally. Its earthly
head will be King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

All these elements together--(*a*) the doctrine of a religion using the
force of a *compelle intrare,* which must give to the Church some claim
to dictate what shall be persecuted as heresy; (*b*) the doctrine of
justice as necessary to a State, together with S. Augustine's glosses,
leading to a control of all law for spiritual ends; (*c*) the doctrine
of the Church as a polity, as the millennial Kingdom of Christ, implying
a reigning authority-- will tend to develop a state of mind which will
picture the *Civitas Dei* as a christianised Church-State, from which
unbelievers are excluded, and which would claim, directly or indirectly,
the supreme power in that State for the leaders of the hierarchy. If we
add to this the effects of the Church's long continuance in a
concentration upon earthly activities, the development of vast
administrative machinery, the fact that she became to the conquering
barbarians the symbol and the source of all culture, we are well on our
way to such a conception of church-power as was represented by Innocent
III.

'Daran sind in der Lehre von der obersten Auctorität der Kirche die
Ideen nachzuweisen, auf Grund deren der römische Primat sich über den
Episkopat erhob und die Stellvertretung Gottes in sich zu concentriren
unternahm. Ist auch Augustin kein absichtlicher Urheber dieser
Entwickelung, so war sie doch durch seine Ansicht, dass die Kirche die
*Civitas Dei* sei, veranlasst. Und diesen Primat an Gottes Statt haben
ja die mittelaltrigen Vertreter desselben in Praxis und Theorie an einem
Verhältniss zwischen Kirche und Staat durchzu-führen gesucht, dessen
Bestimmung direkt von den Grundsätzen Augustin's abstammt, und, wie die
Gegenwart bestätigt, dogmatischen Werth hat, also auch in der
Dogmengeschichte vorgetragen werden muss.'

'In der konsequenten Ausgestaltung, die sie durch Augustinus erfuhr,
erkannte diese Theorie ausschliesslich den unmittelbar von Gott
gestifteten und geleiteten Verband der universellen und einheitlichen
Kirche, den " Staat dessen König Christus ist," als Ausdruck der
sittlichen Weltordnung an. Sie liess daher den weltlichen Staat mit
alien seinen Gliederungen und Einrichtungen nur gelten insofern derselbe
sich dem in der Kirche realisirten göttlichen Staat, als dienender
Bestandtheil ein- und unterordnete. Sie postulirte den Christlichen
Staat und verstand unter dem Christlichen Staat einen Staat, welcher
ausschliesslich in der Kirche die Quelle und das Ziel seiner Existenz
erblickte.'

'Mit einem Worte, nur der der Kirche dienende Staat, welcher die wahre
Gottesverehrung schützt, entspricht seinem Begriff, und vermag in seiner
Sphäre etwas Erspriessliches zu leisten. Dass der Staat ein eigenes in
sich werthvolles Princip, eine göttliche Idee seinerseits vertrete,
erkennt Augustin nicht. Seine Ansicht vom Staate ist nicht weit von dem
Satze entfernt, dass er der Mond sei, welcher von der Sonne seinen Glanz
empfange.'
