## THE 'DE CIVITATE DEI' IN THE MIDDLE AGES

SO far we have been trying to find out what S. Augustine meant to
himself. In these two closing lectures I want to consider what later
ages have made of him. This is not easy. Students, and students alone,
have sufficient data for a judgment concerning the practical influence
of a book. Yet that often makes them bad judges. Living among books they
are apt to over-estimate their significance. They may attribute to a
book results which are due to many other causes. If we mean by the
influence of the 'De Civitate Dei' that it caused people to think or to
do things which, except for it they would not have thought or done, the
problem of estimating that influence is hard to solve. As a rule no
single cause is adequate, but many causes combine to produce a practical
result of any historical importance. Commonly a book, however
influential, is never more than a secondary cause. Rousseau did not
produce the French Revolution, however highly you rate his influence.
That was the consequence of forces that had been active for a long time.
Rousseau may have lit the match--set fire to the powder magazine. He did
not make the powder.

So with the 'De Civitate Dei.' Vast is its influence; still we must
beware of the negative proposition, that if it had not been written, the
course of mediæval history would have been materially different. It
might have been. But it would be hard to prove this.

There is another way in which the problem is difficult--a way in which
the problem about the influence of Voltaire or Rousseau is not
difficult. Literally immeasurable has been the influence of S. Augustine
in moulding the mind of Western Europe. So deeply has it entered into
our life, that it is not possible to say where his influence begins and
where it ends. For the mediæval world he summed up so much of their
heritage from the ancient world--he was so large a conduit-pipe--that it
is hard to say where the stream did not penetrate. His characteristic
theological doctrine is so universal and of such immense import in the
West, that it is easy to over-estimate it in comparison with others.

The problem of Augustine's political or semi-political influence is a
little easier. It is more sharply defined. Yet even here it is hard to
disentangle the threads: or to be sure that what we see at work is the
mind of S. Augustine, and not other causes. Add to this the additional
difficulty which is created by the mediæval habit of citing names and
stock quotations merely to fortify itself, perhaps too with little
acquaintance with a writer's mind.

Perhaps it is safer to say that we are examining the prevalence of
certain ideals, of which S. Augustine was, or was believed to be, the
exponent; and that therefore presumably had to do with their prevalence.
Even Troeltsch, who is all for treating S. Augustine as above everything
an ancient, admits his importance for the future--as being the founder
of the first great *Kultur-Ethik* of Christendom. To-day I shall try and
estimate his influence in the Middle Ages, and in the last lecture I
shall deal with later times. All that can be attempted is to take
certain characteristic illustrations from the earlier, the middle and
the later period.

Einhard was the biographer and son-in-law of Charlemagne. I see no
objection to calling him that--we need not be haunted by Freeman's
ghost. In his personal description he tells us that Charlemagne was fond
of reading, and more especially was devoted to the books of S.
Augustine's 'De Civitate Dei.' We cannot treat this statement as being
without significance. Doubtless Charles felt that the portrait of a
Christian prince drawn in the Fifth Book and known as 'The Mirror of
Princes,' was the portrait of the kind of prince he would like to be
('De Civitate,' V. 24):

'*The State and Truth of a Christian Emperor's Felicity.--* For we
Christians do not say that Christian Emperors are happy because they
have a long reign, or die leaving their sons in quiet possession of
their empires, or have been ever victorious, or powerful against all
their opposers. These are but gifts and solaces of this laborious,
joyless life; idolaters and such as belong not to God (as these Emperors
do) may enjoy them; because God in His mercy will not have these that
know Him to believe that such things are the best goods He gives. But
happy they are (say we) if they reign justly, free from being puffed up
with the glossing exaltations of their attendance or the cringes of
their subjects; if they know themselves to be but men, and remember
that; if they make their power their trumpeter, to divulge the true
adoration of God's majesty; if they love, fear and honour Him; if they
long most for that empire where they need not fear to have partners; if
they be slack to avenge, quick to forgive; if they use correction for
the public good, and not for private hate; if their pardons promise not
liberty of offending, but indeed only hope of reformation; if they
counterpoise their enforced acts of severity with the like weight of
bounty and clemency; if their lusts be the lesser, because they have the
larger licence; if they desire to rule their own effects, rather than
others' estates; and if they do all things, not for glory, but for
charity, and with all, and before all, give God the due sacrifice of
prayer for their imperfections; such Christian emperors we call happy,
here in hope, and hereafter when the time we look for comes, indeed.'

We may go further. Charles would not think of himself as head of a
*Civitas terrena.* He need not. He aimed at a realm in which Christ was
King, in which the true God was worshipped, and none other; a
common-wealth inspired by justice in the strict sense, including all the
theological implications of S. Augustine. That is to say, the realm of
'imperial Charlemagne' was a Christian Empire, the City of God on earth.
Certainly Charles did not draw from this any doctrine of the political
power of the Pope--rather he deduced the rights of imperial oversight.
We may be sure that he would not classify his realm under the second
definition of the commonwealth, from which justice and religion are
excluded. How could he? He had baptised the Saxons at the point of the
sword, and had summoned the Council of Frankfort. Proud as he may have
been at being the successor of Augustus, he would regard himself yet
more proudly as the successor of Constantine and Theodosius. Now
Augustine (however you interpret him) never identified the *Civitas Dei*
with any earthly State. But he had prepared the way for other people to
do this.

The Holy Roman Empire, as it developed, declared by its first title its
claim to be the *Civitas Dei* on earth-- *i.e.* a true Catholic
Commonwealth with two swords in all governing departments, the secular
and the spiritual. Augustine could say *Omnium Christianorum una
respublica est* (XXV. 1).

Charlemagne, and still more the great Otto, would feel that they were
undertaking to realise that maxim in actual life. That is the meaning of
the imperial claim to be 'Lord of the World.' Lord Bryce declares that
'it is hardly too much to say that the Holy Roman Empire was built upon
the foundation of the "De Civitate Dei."' This statement goes too far,
if by it we understand anything that S. Augustine intended. Further, it
underrates the other-worldly character of S. Augustine's own conception
of the *Civitas Dei.* But it is no whit short of the truth, if we adopt
that interpretation of the 'De Civitate Dei,' and of the chapters upon
justice as essential to a true republic, which I discussed in Lecture
III. Remember too, that this--the notion of the 'great State' of the
Middle Ages as the *Civitas Dei*--has nothing to do with the question
whether Augustine taught a doctrine of hierarchical domination or no. It
is equally compatible with Caesaro-papism. The conception of the Holy
Roman Empire as of the one Commonwealth of God could claim to realise
the Augustinian ideal merely by its doctrine of the ecclesiastical
position of the Emperor, who is a sacred person, Canon of S. Peter's,
advocate and protector of the Church. What is capital for our purpose is
the point which Lord Bryce emphasises, the religious character of the
Holy Roman Empire. It is not the religious character of one section (the
Church so-called) set over against the other. It is the whole people, as
it is the whole of life, which is gathered into one great unity. To
quote in substance from one authority, Engelbert of
Admont,\[<a href="#foot01" id="text01">1</a>\] who will come again into
question later on:

'"There is one and one only Commonwealth of the whole Christian people.
Therefore there must necessarily be one and one only king and prince of
that Commonwealth, ordained and constituted for the expansion and
defence of that Faith and people." On which grounds Augustine concludes
that outside the Church there never was nor ever could be a true Empire,
although there have been Emperors, *qualitercunque et secundum quid, non
simpliciter,* who were outside the Catholic Faith and Church.'

The grandiose conception of organised human life, which was expressed in
the Holy Roman Empire, was the origin of the attempts of theorists to
secure a harmony. The Church and the State might serve as names for the
two great departments, ecclesiastical and civil. In that way the word
Church came to acquire one of its meanings--one which has never quite
gone from it--as the equivalent of the clergy. But it is the Christian
world as a whole, 'the whole body of Christian people throughout the
world,' that is the entire Church, and makes up the entire Commonwealth.
So much so that towards the close of the Middle Ages one great and
revolutionary scholastic, William of Ockham, could go further even than
S. Augustine's phrase about all Christians making one commonwealth, and
boldly declare that all men are one society. 'Omnes homines sunt unum
corpus et unum collegium.' As one writer put it, the *regnum,* the
*sacerdotium,* the *studium--*the State, the Church, the
University--were the rulers of the Commonwealth. This point is one which
it is important to make clear before we proceed to the various
controversies between the two sets of officers, civil and spiritual.
Whether you take the Imperialist or the Papalist view, as to which of
these is to have the last word, whether you are Erastian or clericalist,
you are equally within the limits and the circle of ideas of the 'De
Civitate Dei,' as it was interpreted to mean a great Church-State.
Modern Erastianism is a bastard growth. It has nothing to do with the
pure milk of the word dispersed by Thomas Lüber, who said that he was
considering only a State in which one religion and one only was
tolerated, and that the true one. But I must not linger over this. In
earlier papers on 'Erastus' on the 'Respublica Christiana' I have tried
to work it out in detail.\[<a href="#foot02" id="text02">2</a>\]

Let us pass to some later illustrations. The concordant government of
the world by Pope and Emperor was an ideal. In practice there was a
struggle for preponderance. The Papacy had sunk to its lowest in the
tenth century. From that degradation the Saxon Emperors rescued it. The
friendship between Otto the Third and Pope Sylvester II (Gerbert) did
for moment realise the ideal. They write ecstatically to one another:
'Nostrum, nostrum est imperium Romanum.' Once more the Papacy drooped.
The Franconian kings began to lift it from the dust. After the Synod of
Sutri in 1046 and the deposition of Pope Gregory VI at the bidding of
Henry III, the Cluniac revival spread through Western Europe, and its
greatest representative assumed the tiara as Gregory VII. The conflict
that had long been preparing now broke forth. After a brief space of
amity with the weak and vicious Henry IV, Gregory launched the
excommunication, and the long war began. Nowadays we are bidden not to
call it the Investiture Controversy, though that is no bad name for the
first phase, which ended with the Concordat of Worms in 1122. Here more
than anywhere can we trace the influence of S. Augustine. Dr. Mirbt has
examined all the literature.\[<a href="#foot03" id="text03">3</a>\] In
an interesting tractate he has shown how on every kind of topic S.
Augustine's authority was invoked. In the 'Libelli de Lite,' which make
up three volumes of the 'Monu-menta Germaniae Historica,' we have an
ample pamphlet literature. Augustine is used as an authority by both
sides. It should be said that it is doubtful how far many of the
disputants had read the 'De Civitate Dei.' Mirbt has made it clear that
in this as in other matters they used collections of passages. One such
collection is known. Probably there were
others.\[<a href="#foot04" id="text04">4</a>\]

The use of Augustine by both sides is evidence to justify what I said
earlier, that the question of the influence of the ideal of the 'De
Civitate Dei ' is irrelevant to the topic of its clericalist or regalist
interpretation. Obviously Augustine can be made use of by clericalists.
But when we remember that the Empire is regarded as the Commonwealth of
which Christ is King, and that it is by no means certain whether
Augustine could set Pope above King in any political sense, we need not
be surprised that some of Hildebrand's adversaries made as much play
with Augustine's name as did his supporters. One treatise among many,
the 'De Unitate Ecclesiae,'\[<a href="#foot05" id="text05">5</a>\]
written after the death of Gregory VII, we may take as an illustration.
It is strongly imperialist. A passionate appeal for unity alike in
Church and Empire, it is an argument in favour of the anti-pope. With
arguments drawn from the maxim *remota justitia quid regna nisi magna
latrocinia,* the Hildebrandine party is condemned for the deposition of
Henry IV. (The writer appears to separate *ecclesia* from *regnum.* That
may be because he takes *ecclesia* in the narrow sense as equivalent to
the clergy.) Many and long are the citations from the 'De Civitate Dei.'
The writer quotes the 'Mirror of Princes' at length, and shows that he
has no doubt about the relevancy of the book to the controversy.

In Hildebrand himself we find but little use of S. Augustine. One of his
earlier letters shows that he was imbued with a conception of the
relations of Pope and Emperor, which could preserve the unity of the
ancient ideal. The most famous letter of all points the other way.
Hildebrand revives what had fallen into disuse--the non-Christian way of
treating the secular State. The famous
letter\[<a href="#foot06" id="text06">6</a>\] (it is really a tract) to
Hermann of Metz is akin to Augustine's account of the lust of power, as
being one of the chief contributary causes to the growth of the *terrene
state.* Hackneyed as is the quotation, it is needful here:

'Who,' he asks, 'is ignorant that kings and princes had their origin in
those who, ignorant of God and covering themselves with pride, violence
and perfidy, in fact nearly every crime, under the inspiration of the
devil, the prince of this world, claimed to rule over their peers,
*i.e.* men, in blind lust and intolerable arrogance.'

It is hard to suppose that Gregory was ignorant of the 'De Civitate
Dei,' though the only passage from Augustine's writings which he quotes
in this letter is from the 'De Doctrina Christiana.'

Another passage is even more noteworthy:

'It would really be more fitting to speak of good Christians as Kings,
than to call bad princes so. The former in seeking the glory of God rule
themselves. The latter seeking their own lusts are enemies to themselves
and tyrants to others. The former are the body of that true King,
Christ; the latter are the body of their father the devil.'

This suggests Tyconius.

Hildebrand, thinking of rulers in an ascending feudal hierarchy, could
not make any special exception for royalty, and was justified by the
facts of the eleventh century. Much that he said was due to his thinking
of phenomena which were before his eyes. Yet in these two passages there
is a very distinctive mark, as of the two cities. Also it is one of the
rare mediæval passages which speak of civil government as equivalent to
nothing better than the *civitas terrena*; though even here it is not
civil government itself, but the actual personal wickedness of kings and
princes that is condemned. Moreover, even the letter which was called
out by the stress of the collision with Henry IV did not represent
Gregory's whole mind. In an earlier letter he had spoken in the usual
way of two coordinate and fraternal powers. In his letters to William I
and other kings he seemed ready enough to adopt a high view of secular
authority, provided that it is always duly subordinate to the
spiritual.\[<a href="#foot07" id="text07">7</a>\]

On the whole the controversial literature of the day witnesses to the
enormous dependence on S. Augustine; and this dependence is greater in
some of the other writers than it is in Hildebrand himself.

Let us pass from this to a different atmosphere, less clouded with
controversy. The 'Concordia Discordantium Canorum' or 'Decretum' of
Gratian (1139), although it is printed foremost in the 'Corpus Juris
Canonici,' is not an authoritative work. Unlike the 'Decretale' of
Gregory IX a century later, or the 'Sext' of Boniface VIII, it is not
definitely promulgated law--though it must be remembered that even these
decretals are in the Bulls which promulgated them, merely addressed to
the University of Bologna, and not promulgated to the judges in the
Courts Christian. Gratian's work is like the 'Institutes' of
Coke--immense in influence but not official. It gives no legal authority
to any text in it. Yet its importance is little less than if it were
official. Anyhow it is evidence of the way in which the legal mind of
that day looked at these matters. In this book we are in a different
atmosphere. If you take the conflict between Popes and Emperors as a
whole, what establishes itself is the influence of S. Augustine upon
both sides, owing to the universal belief in the Empire as a Christian
commonwealth, the embodiment of true justice, *i.e.* to the general
repudiation of the second or minimising definition (Augustine's own) of
a *respublica.* 'The mediæval Church was a State' is a common saying.
Yet more true is it to say that the mediæval State was a Church--at
least in ideal; for the ideal was the Holy Empire with its twin heads,
the smaller semi-national states being altogether on a lower level, like
duchies.

The 'Decretum' of Gratian is concerned not so much with the ideal of a
Catholic Commonwealth, as with the supremacy of the ecclesiastical
element over the civil. Gratian's work is more than what it seems-- a
compilation, more even than a law book. It is designed to make law by
declaring it; it is a politico-ecclesiastical pamphlet, and mirrors the
life and thought of the day. Its fundamental thesis, the subordination
of civil to ecclesiastical authority, is stated at the outset. In
Distinction X Gratian lays down in his own words that the constitutions
of princes do not prevail over ecclesiastical constitutions; that the
tribunals of kings are subject to the sacerdotal power. This statement
might conceivably be explained to refer only to matters of spiritual
import, and in emergency could be so explained. But Gratian meant more
than that. His object was to make a law book for the Church that should
be parallel with the 'Corpus Juris Civilis.' His work was executed at
Bologna, the home of the great Romanist revival: it emanated from the
chair which Professor Galante holds to-day. If the Pope were truly
sovereign, the halting references to spiritual authority in the civil
law--even those conditioned by the maxim that the Emperor was the source
of all law--might have something set over against them. Justinian might
begin his code with the title 'De Summa Trinitate et Fide Catholica.'
That would have been enough, and more than enough, to satisfy S.
Augustine. But Justinian himself had asserted an imperial supremacy in
theological controversies which the Church in the West would not admit.

Here, however, we are concerned with nothing but S. Augustine's
political influence. Of the citations which make up the 'Decretum,' 530
come from his writings. Only about a dozen are out of the 'De Civitate
Dei.' Many of them are of no importance. Some are of incalculable
import. Comparatively little use may be made of the 'De Civitate Dei';
but this lack is more than made up by the quotations from the treatises
against the Donatists. In vulgar journalese, the author has 'gutted '
the anti-Donatist treatises of S. Augustine (c. xxiii. q. iv. 37-44).
The section dealing with persecution is largely made up from them.
Skilful but not unfair use is made of S. Augustine's concessions. We
have, it is true, no right to say that Augustine would have approved the
capital punishment of heretics or of the mediæval inquisition (which was
later than Gratian). But, as we saw, Augustine admitted the use of
compulsion, and argued that the only reason why it was not employed by
the early Christians was their numerical weakness. Another passage often
thought to be an anticipation of the original contract occurs in the
'Confessions,' and is given by Augustine from Cicero, *Generale pactum
humanae societatis obedire regibus.* It is S. Augustine again (in his
sermon on the Centurion's son) who is cited in justification of lawful
war (c. xxiii. i. 2) together with three other passages. The 'Decretum'
of Gratian is one of the most important elements in the construction of
mediæval society. The use it makes of Augustine's maxims in all
political and semi-political matters is decisive as to his influence.

After this it may seem needless to allude to a merely literary effort.
The 'Chronicon' of Otto of Freisingen, the historian of Frederic
Barbarossa, was mentioned in its place in discussing S. Augustine's
philosophy of history. It is an interesting illustration of the twelfth
century. Otto sets himself deliberately to relate the history of the
world on the line of the 'De Civitate Dei' with the help of Augustine
and Orosius. The most interesting pieces are the prologues. In that
prefixed to Book III there is a balanced and reflective estimate of the
'Praeparatio Evangelica,' as afforded by the universal empire of Rome.
The prologue to Book IV contains a moderate statement of the imperialist
position. There are two powers in the Church. Otto never puts out the
idea of two distinct societies of Church and State, as was done in later
times. It is with him (as always in the Middle Ages) a question of the
balance of two powers in the same society. Christ desired the two swords
to be in the hands of two different representatives: He uses the 'render
to Cæsar' to support the rights of the crown, and quotes the pertinent
passage of S. Augustine addressed to the Donatists in which he laid down
that property can be rightly possessed only by human law at the bidding
of kings, who are of divine appointment. Kings he holds to reign by the
ordination of God and the election of the people, and Constantine with
the approval of the Church

ecclesiae juste regalia contulisse.

In the prologue to Book V he admits that the two cities have coalesced
into one--the Church, with its content of tares and wheat.

'Henceforward, since not merely every nation, but the princes also with
few exceptions, became Catholics, I seem to myself to have composed the
history no longer of two cities, but almost entirely of one--*i.e.*
which I call the Church. For I should not, as before, speak of these two
cities, as two (since the elect and the reprobate are now in one home),
but strictly as one, but of a mixed sort as grain together with chaff.'

In the prologue to Book VI, after lamenting the arrogance of the
hierarchy who seek to strike the kingdom with that sword, which they
only hold through the favour of kings, he goes on to say that he must
not be taken as intending to separate the Empire from the Church, since
in the Church of God the two functions, the sacerdotal and the regal,
are known to exist; and he refers to his previous statement, that the
history now relates to one society only. In the prologue to Book VIII he
once more repeats his acknowledgment to S. Augustine, This last book is
occupied with discussion of the last things, like the later books of the
'De Civitate Dei.' Following S. Augustine, Otto definitely rejects the
Chiliastic doctrine, that our Lord will return for a terrestrial
millennium and reign visibly in any sense in which He is not now
reigning. This work alone is evidence of the way in which the great
Christian Commonwealth can be regarded alike as Empire and Church, and
is thought of as

Civitas Dei.

Let us go forward a century. In S. Thomas Aquinas the mediæval world has
its most authoritative statement, just as Dante gave it its imaginative
symbol The ordered intelligence of S. Thomas was different in the
extreme from the highly emotional and stormy intellect of S. Augustine.
In the writings of S. Thomas we have a minutely articulated system of
mediæval thought as it had come to be in the day of the supreme
achievements of the Papacy. Born ten years after the death of Innocent
III, S. Thomas lived through most of the latter phases of the
Hohenstauffen struggle, more especially the Council of Lyons and the
despotism of the 'stupor mundi et immutator mirabilis ' Frederic II. We
do well to take him as the central point for the understanding of
mediæval thought.

S. Thomas's system of politics is expressed in several places. First
there is the commentary on Aristotle's 'Politics.' With that we are not
concerned in this connection. There is the not inconsiderable discussion
of fundamentals in politics in the 'Summa Theologica,' ii. 2, qq.
90-109, and also in certain other passages of the same work anent
heretics, and so forth. Lastly we have the little treatise 'De Regimine
Principum.' Of this only the first book and four chapters of the second
are written by S. Thomas. The rest is by Ptolemy of Lucca.

S. Thomas has been called the first Whig. His discussion of forms of
government follows on Aristotle's. Of all that I make abstraction
to-day. When you study him in detail you see that he develops his system
in dependence on three main authorities--Scripture, Aristotle, and
Augustine. I do not know how many times S. Augustine is cited in the
'Summa,' but I should suppose it must be quoted thousands of times. In
the parts which deal with politics, we find a great deal of dependence
upon him. We do not hear of the doctrine of the two cities, for the
obvious reason that it was no longer held to fit, now that the kingdom
of this world had become the kingdom of our God and His Christ: and the
other use of the terms (that maintained by Otto), to denote merely the
elect and the reprobate, does not, strictly speaking, concern politics.

S. Thomas quotes most from S. Augustine's 'De Libero Arbitrio,' but we
have important arguments drawn from the 'De Civitate Dei.' He makes much
use of that definition--the Ciceronian--which makes justice the essence
of a State. In the passage which justifies war (ii. 2, q. 40, 1) no
fewer than eight passages are adduced. Further on, in article 3, he
argues, from Augustine's words in the ' De Civitate Dei,' that
stratagems in warfare are legitimate. S. Thomas discusses whether it be
right to carry the doctrine of the Christianity of the State so far as
to make vice equivalent to crime. This he decides in the negative. He
was too wise to want a Puritan tyranny. He does this on grounds derived
entirely from S. Augustine. At the same time he disclaims any idea of
treating Augustine as an infallible guide. On the treatment of heretics
he bases his argument for persecution upon three passages of S.
Augustine. Like Augustine also he condemns compulsion of the heathen. He
even goes so far as to say that a Christian governor would be right to
tolerate heathen ceremonies. A heretic or schismatic is an erring and
rebellious child, and is therefore to be corrected. Quite other is the
case of the Jew or the Pagan. His treatment of neighbours' lives and
property is in line with S. Augustine, especially the remarkable
passages in which he defends the social and industrial legislation of
the Mosaic system, on the ground that it is all based on the idea of
fellowship.

Further evidence is to be found in the 'De Regimine Principum.' In
treatment and manner it is unlike S. Augustine. But we find more than
one reference to the 'De Civitate Dei,' especially the reproduction of
the Mirror of Princes. Even more relevant is the argument from ends. The
true end and reward of a godly prince must be beyond this life. We have
arguments much the same as those of S. Augustine, only applied rather to
the prince than the *respublica.* In I, 14 there is a long and elaborate
argument to show that the end of a well-governed commonwealth must be
virtuous life, which leads to the fruition of God. Since the lord of the
ultimate end must obviously direct those who are concerned only with
subordinate ends, the Roman pontiff must have the ultimate authority
over Christian kings, just as among the ancient Gauls the Druids held
the control.

It is interesting, and for our purpose not impertinent, to go on with
the book and consider the later parts written by Ptolemy of Lucca. They
are fair evidence of the mediæval ideals and were written not much
later. Here we have a direct and continuous dependence on the 'De
Civitate Dei.' It is not merely a question of the influence of ideas,
but of the following of the book. References to it are numerous. Many
arguments are drawn from it. S. Augustine is the writer's acknowledged
authority for the claim that the Romans were entrusted with the dominion
of the world as a reward for their virtue; and Christians are bidden to
imitate this self-sacrifice. From S. Augustine is cited the
interpretation of the words about the image and superscription of Cæsar;
that the image of Cæsar was (as it were) the image of God. Ptolemy
accepts Augustine's account of the difference between despotic and
properly political power, arguing that the former would never have been
known but for sin. The writer seems to have had the aim of harmonising
Aristotle and Augustine. We need not follow him in his description of
the Empire or in his criticism of ancient constitutions. All that we
need observe is this, that in this book, which is a moderate but
definite expression of the hierarchical theory of the State, we have
ample evidence that the influence of S. Augustine was not merely an
universally pervading force in the Middle Ages, but was consciously
adopted and felt.

Towards the close of the Middle Ages we can still trace the direct
influence of S. Augustine in political thought. One writer (I think a
Frenchman) arguing in favour of national States, at a time when the
imperial authority was no more than a name, at least in France, makes
free use of the passage in the 'De Civitate Dei' which maintains the
value of a multitude of small societies.

Dante's 'De Monarchia' is the best known, as it is the most impressive,
of the accounts of the Holy Roman Empire. It is, as you know,
Ghibelline, *i.e.* Imperialist, and is designed to show that the Emperor
holds his sceptre by grace of God immediately, not mediately through the
Pope. The claim was not new. Henry IV made it against Hildebrand. So
also did the Hohenstauffen. Dante's grandiose conception is still that
of the mediæval unity--a great world Church-State. I do not think that
the book as a whole can be said to depend on S. Augustine. But it is
hardly possible not to suspect that the second book did owe much to the
'De Civitate Dei.' In that book Dante proves that the Empire of the
world was given to the Romans for all time, as a reward of virtue. It is
noticeable that Dante quotes the 'De Civitate Dei' once.

Very interesting is the book ' On the Origin and Progress of the Roman
Empire,' from which a quotation has already been made. It is by
Engelbert, Abbot of Admont, in
Austria.\[<a href="#foot08" id="text08">8</a>\] The writer founds his
argument to a large extent on the 'De Civitate Dei.' Most of the book is
little more than a comment on this. It was written at the time (1310) of
the last strictly mediæval revival of the Empire under Henry of
Luxemburg, and after the final defeat of the Hohenstauffen, *i.e.* about
the same time as Dante's book. The writer had to face the existing
conditions, with the *de facto* independence of France. Therefore he
takes into account S. Augustine's view that the world would fare better
under a number of independent communities, joined in one bond of harmony
and respecting each other. This he counters in the following argument
Such, he says, is the mutual jealousy between nations that no such
harmony is to be looked for. The only chance of peace is for the world
to become one State. The argument has reference mainly to Catholic
Christendom in the West. One remarkable passage takes into account the
existence of non-Christian States. They, he says, are equally bound by
national law and must recognise the principle of justice which is *suum
cuique tribuere.* In other words the principle at the bottom of
international amity is seen to be the maxim to love one another, which
is supposed to govern the human race. This is not far from the maxim of
William of Ockham, which was a little later, that all men compose one
society. What for our purpose is most noteworthy is the author's view,
that Christianity has now become the law of the greater part of the
world, and a Christian Empire is therefore the ideal.

One most interesting passage is of prophetic import. Arguing, as
Engelbert did, in favour of the imperial ideal at a time when the most
progressive States of Europe had freed themselves and the national
monarchies were being consolidated, he declares that the unity of the
Holy Roman Empire is two-fold, both secular and ecclesiastical, and that
if the nations withdraw themselves from recognition of the Emperor, it
will not be long before they throw off allegiance to the Pope.

Even more prophetic are the writings of Wyclif. Wyclif is enormously
dependent on S. Augustine. He develops that other side in Augustine's
conception of the Church which was at times conveniently ignored by the
clericalists--that which insists on its primary application to the elect
and no one else. He does this with conscious use of S. Augustine. This
leads straight to the doctrine of the Invisible Church.

Finally, he uses S. Augustine to support his radical Erastianism. From
him he develops the doctrine that the clergy must always be subordinate
to the civil power, for royalty represents the fatherhood of God and the
priesthood the sonship. He cites S. Augustine in regard to the image and
superscription of Cæsar. Wyclif was the most thoroughgoing Erastian who
ever lived. He wrote after Marsilius of Padua, and was probably
influenced by the 'Defensor Pacis' with its programme of democratic
Erastianism. Most of Wyclif's works are a plea for the disendowment of
the Church. The 'De Dominio Civili' is not mainly a treatise on
politics, as its name might seem to imply. It is concerned with
property, and especially with corporate property. Wyclif wants the
Church to be disendowed. Then, he says, the lords, having more lands,
will have less motive to oppress the poor. In the 'Speculum Militantis
Ecclesiae' he treats of the Church as equivalent to the commonwealth,
and declares that it consists of the lords, the clergy and the labouring
classes!\[<a href="#foot09" id="text09">9</a>\] His doctrine of dominion
founded on grace is intended to argue that property has duties as well
as rights, *i.e.* that the right of private property is not absolute.
That indeed was the view of S. Thomas and S. Augustine. It was the Roman
pagan conception of absolute property that triumphed at the close of the
Middle Ages. This idea, which is the foundation of modern capitalism,
led at the time to further attempts to depress the peasants into
slavery. It has been fraught with a thousand evils, from which even now
the world is slowly and with many struggles trying to recover. The
'reception,' as it is called, of Roman Law in 1495 in Germany may be
taken as the date when the Middle Ages came to an end and the Roman
ideas of property had conquered the West.

The great mediæval unity was always largely an ideal. Still it was the
ideal. It was a unity of religion, of government, of economics, of
morals, of social life and of outward culture. This unity, if not
determined by S. Augustine, owed much to his influence. It was not the
direct or intended result of his writing. He spoke, indeed, of things
not being so bad as people thought, of a possible revival of the Roman
power. For this he has been blamed. It is said he showed lack of
prescience. But was it so? The actual Roman Empire lasted in the West
for more than half a century after S. Augustine's death. Then came the
Ostrogothic kingdom of Theodoric. That too vanished. Justinian's
conquest is not to be ignored. Why should it be?

Augustine did not foresee the Holy Roman Empire of the German people, or
the cry of Gerbert to Otto III, '*Nostrum, nostrum est imperium
Romanum'* Yet such a phrase may be held to have justified his words. For
it was the Roman ideal that stood for peace and culture in those
troublous times.

Easier is it to trace this influence in the doctrine of the whole world
as the *Civitas Dei,* connecting this with S. Augustine's undoubted
belief in the unity and universal mission of the Church, and his
assimilation of it to a society.

Easier still is it to trace his influence in the otherworldly reference
which lay behind all mediæval developments, in the growth of Western
monasticism with its characteristic qualities, with the widespread
acceptance of his principle of property.

Some would trace to S. Augustine the whole development of the Papal
power. This was hardly a legitimate development, but not at all
impossible.

Clearly we cannot understand the Middle Ages on this political and
social side without Augustine. He it is who helped much to make the
Western world compact.
