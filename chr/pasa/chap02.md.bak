## THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY

HAD S. Augustine a philosophy of history? If so, what is it, and what is
its value? These are the questions to which I seek the answer to-day.
Here is a paragraph pertinent enough from Archdeacon Cunningham's
Hulsean Lectures on 'S. Austin and his Place in the History of Christian
Thought' (p. 114).

'He sets before us a philosophy of history--the continuous evolution of
the Divine Purpose in human society: he contrasts the earthly polities
which change and pass with the eternal City of God which is being
manifested in the world: he shows how these two are intermingled,
interacting now, but how different they are in their real nature: one is
of the earth, centred only in earthly things, while the other, because
it has its chief regard fixed on that which is Eternal, gives us the
best rule for the things of time. The earthly city, which aimed only at
earthly prosperity, failed to attain even that, while the Heavenly City,
aiming at an Eternal Reality, supplies the best conditions for earthly
good as well. It is in the hope of the final triumph of the City of God
that the course of the world becomes intelligible, for then we may see
that the rise and fall of earthly empires, the glories of ancient
civilisation, the sufferings of men in their ruin, have not been
unmeaning or in vain; for they have served to prepare for the coming of
the kingdom of God.

'Thus it is that for S. Austin, faith in the Holy Catholic Church serves
to render history intelligible. This faith was the key of knowledge, for
it gave the first philosophy of history worthy the name. . . .

'If we examine it more carefully even now we shall be amply rewarded. We
may find new reasons to admire S Austin--the discrimination he
occasionally displays in the use of evidence, the marvellous power of
combining many isolated facts into a connected system, even though here
and there he puts forward opinions which are hard to reconcile with his
general position. But we may find greater merits than these: we may turn
from the grandest modern account of the evolution of human
progress--turn from Hegel himself--to St. Austin and feel that the
historical system of the ancient father is more perfect and complete;
inasmuch as he had a clearer conception of the beginning, and a more
definite perception of the final end towards which the whole Creation
moves.'

Stronger praise can be found. An Italian scholar, Professor Billed,
wrote a book on Vico and S. Augustine. The object was to show that
Augustine was the true originator in the field of the philosophy of
history, that Vico but followed in his steps, although by some he is
regarded as a pioneer. Dr. Reinkens in his inaugural address as Rector
of the University of Breslau develops the theme of S. Augustine's
philosophy of history in reference to modern life. He seeks to show that
his system is an account of the progress of the world to a rational
freedom. This is one side.\[<a href="#foot01" id="text01">1</a>\]

Some modern interpreters of S. Augustine set little store by his
philosophy of history. H. Schmidt declares that he reduces history to a
nullity. Others speak as though the few remarks he made on the topic are
not worth considering.\[<a href="#foot02" id="text02">2</a>\] They point
out how meagre is his picture of the course of the terrene state, how he
overlooks almost all history, except Assyria and Rome-- just glancing at
Greece and Egypt. True, Augustine mentions the common interpretation of
the four monarchies in Daniel, implying that the Church is the fifth.
Still there is no consistent effort to take the student through the
revolutions of human affairs, and to justify the ways of God to man in
the rise and fall of kingdoms such, for instance, as we see in Bossuet's
'Discours sur l'histoire universelle.' To that we may retort that this
discourse was implicit in the 'De Civitate Dei.'

What is certain is that S. Augustine was a man historically minded. He
set out (he was compelled by the purpose of his apologetic) to be a
spectator of all time and all created being. No one who takes the
Incarnation seriously can avoid some kind of philosophy of history. That
event--if a fact--testifies at once to the importance of human life on
earth, and shows its centre. Doubts of Christianity at this moment are
largely due to the difficulty felt by many in making the events in
Palestine the pivot of human history. The religion of the Incarnation
cannot be mere theology-- a system of notions developed from certain
metaphysical propositions--nor can it be mere ethics, a code of laws on
a theistic basis. It has to do with a life on earth, in which Christians
hold that in the fulness of time-- *i.e.* at the due moment in
history--the eternal reality at the heart of things became self-revealed
and self-limited in a living earthly person. The issue of this was the
fulfilment of the Jewish theocracy in the Christian Church. Augustine
moreover approached Christianity emphatically by way of the Church. No
one who did that could ignore the problems which it involved. Take a
definite historical fact as your centre, take an actual visible society
as the special sphere of God's operation, a society which has a past and
must have a future on earth; and then you are compelled to some
philosophy of history. You cannot, like a sheer Platonist--and Augustine
shows leanings that way--treat as of no account the whole development in
time and space, as though this world were the dreams of the Absolute in
a fit of absence of mind; and then it is the object of the enlightened
by some mystical process to get away from those dreams into the reality
of day, where there is no change, no growth and no personality. That was
the ideal of many. Augustine at one time had it. At times, even as a
Christian, he uses expressions which show how greatly Plato and Plotinus
contributed to his mental composition. On the whole, his belief in the
Church and his sense of immediate reality were too great. A man who does
not give way to the temptation of a doctrinaire's system pure and
simple, but has so much regard to the actual as S. Augustine, is bound
to rest unsatisfied without some philosophy giving history a meaning.
Nowadays many seem to think it will be all the same if we leave out the
facts, content to breathe the atmosphere created by a former belief in
them, and hold that the Christian has to do solely with certain
principles.

If the facts of Christ's life on earth be treated as of little account,
Christian faith will become either a set of dogmatic propositions,
metaphysically grounded, coupled with a not too well-grounded ethical
code, inelastic and impracticable, or else a name for certain states of
sentimental brooding or elation. Against this danger Augustine fought,
as we do now. His sense of Christianity being embedded in fact governs
his apologetic, and that despite his love of dialectic, and his
acquaintance with current philosophy.

The Dean of Wells in his Commentary on the 'Epistle to the Ephesians'
has shown how S. Paul saw in the Incarnation a philosophy of history. So
did S. Athanasius.

S. Augustine does but draw this out. By the fifth century the Church had
become a great human institution. It was not the preacher of an
*Interims Ethik,* but an important part of the world historical process.
That was true, whatever you thought about the Church. It was but natural
that a mind like S. Augustine's, sensitive to every prevailing current,
should try to look at all history as a great drama, of which the supreme
crises are in Eden and Calvary. This much, however, we must concede at
the outside to the minimisers. Augustine did not set out to compose a
philosophy of history. His purpose was not to comprehend history, but to
defend the Catholic Church. Even Hegel was moved by something more than
a disinterested concern for the student who is trying to gather up the
threads of fact. He wanted to show how his own philosophy of the
Absolute could be brought into line with the development of mankind.
History proved to Hegel an illustration of the doctrines of the Logic.
Incidentally he wanted to justify the Prussian State, in which, as we
know, with his lack of humour, he contrived to discern the
self-presentation of the Absolute Idea.

However it may be with Hegel, the philosophy of history arose directly
out of the method of Augustine's apologetic. It is not individualist.
Augustine does not proceed on the method, too often deemed adequate, of
taking separate points and arguing from them, in order to affect
individual conversions. That is not his object. His purpose is this--to
justify the Christians' God against the attacks made upon Him, to remove
from the Church the charge of having brought about the ruin of
civilisation. Over against the shattered world-order, great in its ruin,
he sets another order even greater. He shows that the security and
justice and freedom, which pious Romans believed to be guaranteed by the
Roman Empire, were not guaranteed, that they never could be guaranteed
on earth, that they are a treasure not of the body but of the soul. 'Not
dear city of Cecrops, but dear city of God,' the cry of the great Stoic
Emperor, has the gist of the whole. The Stoic lived in independence of
temporal vicissitude, without help from beyond. 'The Christian belongs
to the city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is God.' 'I'm
but a stranger here--Heaven is my home.' Over against Rome, the eternal
city, Augustine puts Jerusalem the Golden. This he does not do *in
abstracto.* He takes the two ideas incarnate in two societies. One
modern commentator, Scholz, well describes the book as 'Faith and
Unbelief, as shown in world-history.' Even if this be not a philosophy
of history, strictly so called, it is at least a justification of the
Church, historically conceived. This is evident in the opening
paragraph. ('De Civitate,' I. 1.)

'That most glorious society and celestial city of God's faithful, which
is partly seated in the course of these declining times, wherein "he
that liveth by faith" is a pilgrim amongst the wicked; and partly in
that solid estate of eternity, which as yet the other part doth
patiently expect, until "righteousness be turned to judgment"; being
then by the proper excellence to obtain the last victory, and be crowned
in perfection of peace, have I undertaken to defend in this work: which
I intend unto you (my dearest Marcellinus) as being your due by my
promise, and exhibit it against all those that prefer their false gods
before this city's founder. The work is great and difficult, but God the
Master of all difficulties is our helper. For I know well what strong
arguments are required to make the proud know the virtue of humility, by
which (not being enhanced by human glory, but endowed with divine grace)
it surmounts all earthly loftiness, which totters through the one
transitory instability. For the King, the builder of this city, whereof
we are now to discourse, hath opened his mind to his people in the
Divine Law thus: "God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
humble." Now this which is indeed only God's, the swelling pride of an
ambitious mind affecteth also, and loves to hear this as parcel of his
praise.

"*Parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos.*"

"To spare the lowly, and strike down the proud."

Wherefore touching the temporal city (which longing after domination,
though it hold all the other nations under it, yet in itself is
overruled by the one lust after sovereignty) We may not omit to speak
whatsoever the quality of our proposed subject shall require or permit.'

These two cities and societies are vague enough, and ill-defined in
thought and imagination. Still, however much or little Augustine meant
by contemplating all created history as the conflict of two opposed
societies, he meant more than some writers such as Reuter and Troeltsch
would seem to admit. Clearly, this scheme affords a framework under
which the whole of history can be subsumed. You may say that the plan is
imperfectly executed. Many people have thought that even of Hegel's
explicit 'Philosophy of History.' It did not require the late war to
make it seem an odd performance to try and classify all history as a
progress towards freedom, and to find that freedom for ever embodied in
the Prussian Absolutism.

Faults of construction we may admit. The picture of the two cities was
vague. At times Augustine forgets all about it. It seems strange that
after stating his object he should go off into an elaborate attack on
the morals of popular idolatry. Yet when we think it out, we can see
some relevance to the main theme. Augustine would, I suppose, have
agreed that these earlier books demonstrate the inadequacy of the
*Civitas terrena* as an ideal. Still it is well to be warned. The reader
must put up with a great deal of irrelevance and with the amplification
of all sorts of things which have no obvious bearing on the main point.
The passage from Vives cited in the last lecture illustrates this (p.
16).

Two presuppositions of any philosophy of history are in the mind of S.
Augustine throughout. (1) The unity of the human race, involving, as its
corollary, the doctrine of (2) the essential sociability of man. The
*Civitas Dei,he* says, can mean nothing less than the social life of the
children of God. That one principle alone, according to Scholz, is a
contribution of high value to world-history.
\[<a href="#foot03" id="text03">3</a>\] Even better than Aristotle did
S. Augustine understand that true history begins only with a form of
society. Also he emphasises the unity of the human race which is derived
by its descent from Adam. This idea lies behind his doctrine of original
sin.

The strong sense of providential government of the world which Augustine
shares with Vico may be thought to be also essential to the philosophy
of history. This view, however, may be
doubted.\[<a href="#foot04" id="text04">4</a>\] One who was an atheist
or a pure agnostic, *e.g.* Comte, might still have a philosophy of
history, provided that he held the two maxims stated above, without any
reference to God.

Augustine's conception, which was avowedly derived from the Republic of
Plato, that you can best judge of a nation by the analogy of an
individual, helped him in some ways. In other it was a drawback. Alike
in Plato and S. Augustine such a view may lead to a conception of morals
which permits the extremities of persecution. All evil clericalism goes
back to Plato.

The 'De Civitate Dei' then is sketchy and incomplete. If we are to
justify it as a philosophy of history, in spite of this, we must go
further. Augustine's philosophy of history is a philosophy of the
time-process as a whole. That is why he is able--as Scholz (p. 138)
complains-- to treat world-history as an episode. History according to
S. Augustine is not merely terrestrial. It is the whole course of social
happenings in time, in relation to a timeless Deity. No one could be
more profoundly imbued than was S. Augustine with the doctrine of the
timeless reality of God. On that ground he felt the more need of
relating this to the world of successive events. Hence his book involves
a philosophy of creation and a theodicy, no less than an account of the
'education of the human race.' It is history, as a whole, history from
the creation of light until the Last Judgment, that is the justification
of God. Only on that tremendous canvas can he paint a picture that shall
outmatch the gloomy Velasquez-like portrait of the world as set up for
men's imagination by the sack of Rome. On this view much that seems at
first sight irrelevant falls into place. Augustine begins, he must
begin, with the Creation. The universe was not created in Time. Time and
the world are coeval. They are the chosen achievement of God--the divine
symphony which not even sin can rob of its beauty.

        'God Himself is the best poet  
        And the real is His song.'

Augustine's strong æsthetic tendency, his worship of beauty, comes out
in the doctrine that history is in truth a heavenly song--that, in some
way or other, the evil in it is overruled by the beauty of the whole--
just as discords are resolved by a skilful composer

'Why rushed the discords in, but that harmony might be prized,'
Augustine says in his interesting letter to Marcellinus ('Epist.,' 138):

'God is the unchangeable Governor as He is the unchangeable Creator of
mutable things, ordering all events in His providence until the beauty
of the completed course of time, the component parts of which are the
dispensations adapted to each successive age, shall be finished, like
the grand melody of some ineffably rare master of song.'

He lifts creation, before the beginning of earth; the first important
event, the true beginning of the two societies, is the sin of Satan. The
pride of Lucifer typifies all evil doing; it began among the angels that
dichotomy into the two societies which is to last for ever, and as its
counterpart set moving the course of redemption.

Augustine seems to have held the view that men are created to fill the
gaps in the celestial choir caused by the exclusion of the fallen
angels; that the elect are to fill up that number and no more. The
devil's first sin was an act of freedom of will like that of Adam. God
did not cause it, for evil is negative. It cannot be created. It is the
choice of the lower, instead of fidelity to the essential nature of a
spiritual being. The nature of all things, even of the devil, is good.
It is the will, not the nature, that goes wrong.

We need not follow S. Augustine into the account of the Fall. It is
familiar enough. Once more must be emphasised the immense import, in
regard to the philosophy of history, of S. Augustine's strong doctrine
of original sin. He can compare the whole course of human history to a
single individual, and can parallel their several stages. It is true
that the comparison is vague; he gives different classifications in
different places. In the 'De Catechizandis Rudibus' there are six.
Freedom for the race, which was all enclosed in the loins of Adam, was
lost in the strict sense by the Fall. Men still have a choice, but only
between different kinds of sinful acts. Some are worse than others and
will meet with worse torments. Manifold is the hierarchy of hell. With
the Fall begins the human part of the *Civitas tenena.* Yet the coming
redemption always holds some. The two societies not only now, but in all
ages, have been intermingled. The heavenly city goes back through Shem
to Seth; the earthly to Cain. The Hebrew development is treated as the
main embodiment of the *Civitas Dei.* The *Civitas tenena* develops
through Assyria and Rome, though I am not sure that Augustine ever
absolutely identifies even the old Roman Empire with the

Civitas tenena.

The *Civitas Dei* began long ago; but in its fulness it came with the
spread of the Gospel. There will be a mystical thousand years of the
reign of Christ. This is to be followed by the bitterest of all
persecutions; and the devil will once again be loosed. After this the
establishment of the final goal of the two cities is easy. The goal of
the *Civitas Dei* is the *pax œterna,* and the

visio dei.

Dr. Reinkens argued that the end which the citizens of the heavenly city
will reach is true freedom. Hence he can parallel S. Augustine with
Hegel, making them both teach that the history of the world is the
record of the progress towards rational freedom. I cannot but think that
Reinkens is here misled by the wish to make out a historical parallel.
It is peace, not freedom, that is the goal. Augustine doubtless thought
that freedom *(non posse peccare)* would only be reached hereafter and
would be reached then. But that is not to the purpose. The sack of Rome
had been the greatest dramatic violation of the *Pax Romana.* The sense
of security had suffered a shock only to be likened to that which we
feel now. As compensation for this lost earthly peace Augustine gives a
new security--the peace that passes understanding. He does not promise a
new earthly security under the ægis of the Church. On the contrary he
agrees that neither religion nor piety can guarantee earthly security,
although both are in the hands of God, who gives power, sometimes to the
bad in order to teach humility to the good, and sometimes by way of
reward to those relatively virtuous. The only genuine security must be
that which is beyond the changes and chances of this mortal life. That
is the 'saints' everlasting rest'--to be won in the heavenly Jerusalem,
the happy home, when the triumph is eternal and warfare is accomplished.
Save in figure it does not attach to that partial representative of the
*Civitas Dei* which we see here and now in the Church Militant. That is
no more free from perilous conjuncture than is the secular state.

Clearly the conception of redemption through the sacrifice of the Cross,
made effective by a visible and sacramental Church, set over against the
worldly society, affords some kind of philosophy of history. It runs as
a thread through the whole complicated pattern of created being. This it
could hardly do if religion were purely individual. The paramount
significance of the Church, viewed as the depository and dispenser of
grace, is of the essence of this historical philosophy. True, it may be
argued, and has been argued, that the predestinarianism of S. Augustine
makes the other way, and reduces all to individualism. Augustine is not
always consistent. The two conceptions of the sacramental visible Church
and the *communio sanctorum* cross one another in a way that is often
perplexing. But this difficulty is not decisive. No one is secure of
salvation by baptism or even by communion. But they are conditions *sine
qua non.* Witness Augustine's views on the condition of unbaptised
infants. One of his grounds of controversy with Julius of Eclanum was,
that the latter was willing to except infants unbaptised from the full
penalty--to assign them to a sort of lower court.

The sketch of world-history is the weakest thing in the book. All,
however, goes to emphasise his main thesis. History is a unity. No one
before or since taught more plainly the solidarity of man. That renegade
Englishman, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, in a book once overpraised even
in England, condemned all notions of humanity. He said that there was no
human race, only races--and preached a new Teutonic Christianity. Now we
see this in its first flush of hot-gospelling.' The Foundations of the
Nineteenth Century' gives a reinterpretation in the interests of
*Deutschland über Alles.* All is based on a doctrine of the fundamental
inequality of races. It is the direct contrary of the doctrine of the
'De Civitate Dei' and Augustine's frequent assertions that

proximus homini est omnis homo.

This unity of history is so set forth as to be a theodicy. Augustine
thought that the doctrine of original sin, with its accompaniment of
arbitrary election, could be reconciled with Divine Justice. All men are
*ipso jure* damned. The few who are saved may rejoice. Those who suffer
the last penalty have nothing of which to complain. They go where they
naturally belong. Those who escape have no merit, not even a turning of
the will, for that is the work of irresistible grace. Certainly this
justification may not seem to us satisfactory. Later theories,
especially that of Molina, went far away from this. But the point here
is that Augustine gave a view of the whole and claimed to justify the
ways of God to men.

Also, history is seen as the education of mankind. Augustine was the
product of the university and an academic teacher. Strongly imbued as he
was with his own sense of experience, he was hardly likely to undervalue
the progressive education of mankind in the arts. So distinctly sociable
a being could not really despise the social arts. Like all men he was
tempted at times to think his own course worthless for what it left out.
But that thought is hardly permanent. In the background of his
consciousness he was always aware of the possession of culture. Still
with his conversion to Christianity and even the earlier conversion to
Platonism, the other-worldly doctrine creeps in. All the goods of human
life have only a relative value. No earthly good has excellence save,
and in so far, as it leads us on. The topic of world-flight is strong in
S. Augustine in all his later writings. It is plausible to argue that of
this book it is the main theme.

Can that be? Whether he liked it or not--and I rather think he
did--Augustine must have known himself to be one of the best educated
men of the day. Like a modern Etonian condemning the public schools, yet
all the while conscious that they have made him a little different from
those who were not there--this attitude, whether social or scientific or
religious, has always in it an element of pose. The pessimistic view of
all worldly activities is clear enough in the 'De Civitate Dei.' But it
is counteracted by that other conception under which he views history as
a work of art; in that sublime sense of human power and the beauty of
things which was cited in the last lecture. Nobody who felt that, could
treat the sights and sounds of earth, the outward beauty of things or
even the course and revolutions of family and national life, as a thing
of no account. A famous story of S. Bernard relates how he passed by the
lake of Geneva and was unaware. S. Augustine has pictured for ever the
scene at Ostia, in which took place the conversation with his mother, to
which all the ten books of the 'Confessions' are the prologue.

Scholz argues that Augustine's theory of predestination takes all
meaning out of history; since everything is preknown, how can there be
any real development? Augustine is aware of this difficulty and tries to
meet it. \[It is, by the way, a difficulty not confined to this
doctrine, but to any view which gives history as a whole a meaning. If
the world moves to a predetermined end, the real end is in the beginning
and it is only an unwinding of a clock.\] In the argument against
Fatalism Augustine tries to meet this. He denies that the Divine
fore-knowledge does away with freedom. Here he was right. Whether the
same can be said of the effects of his doctrine of irresistible grace is
another matter. It must be conceded that, to S. Augustine, history is
the sphere of the revelation under transitory and earthly symbols of the
Eternal and Changeless Being. All changes, individual and social, are
guided to their appointed end by a Providence, which though infinitely
patient is also infinitely powerful. That does not eviscerate history of
meaning. Any teleological view of human life is open to the same
objection. Augustine's view of the way in which grace changes the human
will may or may not be tenable, but it is not determinist. Besides, not
only does Augustine make God free. Calvin did that. He makes man free by
nature. He never taught that the first sin of Adam was predetermined, or
that of Satan. Luther and Calvin did. Moral evil came into the world by
the wrong use of a will free from the outset. That is the thesis which
he is ever laying down against the Manichæan doctrine. After the one
evil act the will is dominated by concupiscence, and that in every
member of the race. All that it does has the nature of sin. But even
then its acts are not necessitated; a man can choose between ambition
and self-indulgence, between the pride of heroism and the meanness of
cowardice. Even the doctrine of irresistible grace is not mere fatalism.
It does not make world-history the blind working out of a formula--like
the obedience of a curve to its equation. His emphasis on miracles, and
the positive arguments which he gives for them, form an evidence of
this. God's world will move to its end. That is certain. Yet it moves
through the reality of concrete and actual persons and societies set in
a world of time and space. History is a real, not a phenomenal thing. It
is a drama, not a cinema show. He can appeal to history elsewhere
(*Episi.* cxxxvii. 'Ad Volusianum') as serving in its order as an
argument for the truth of the Gospel.

'What man might not be moved to faith in the doctrine of Christ by such
a remarkable chain of events from the beginning and by the manner in
which the epochs of the world are linked together, so that our faith in
regard to present things is assisted by what happened in the past, and
the record of earlier and ancient things is attested by later and more
recent events.'

If we look before and after on this doctrine, we find certain other
points to note. The doctrine of the two cities is not original. Indeed
the Apocalypse of S. John might well have suggested it. It is almost
certain that Augustine took it from Tyconius, the Donatist whom he
respected so greatly. In the edition of the 'Rules of Tyconius' by
Professor Burkitt we can read all about the two societies, the one of
God and the other of the devil. \[<a href="#foot05" id="text05">5</a>\]

To Tyconius also is due the interpretation of the millennial kingdom, as
exhibited by the Church. Nor does Augustine state his doctrine for the
first time in the 'De Civitate Dei.' We find it fairly well developed in
the earlier treatise, 'De Catechizandis Rudibus,' and the division of
human life into six ages. The main outline is all there. It was reserved
for this work to treat it with a vast sweep of imaginative vision, so as
to embrace all created existence and to found thereon an enduring
apologetic.

Later on Otto of Freising attempted to write a history of the world on
the framework laid down by S. Augustine, concluding in precisely the
same way with the Last Things. More famous is the work of Bossuet. His
'Discours sur l'histoire universelle' is what it professes to be, an
attempt to see history in the light of the Incarnation. He takes it down
to Charlemagne and had intended to take it further. The book is not an
adaptation of S. Augustine's work. It is primarily historical, just as
the former is primarily apologetic. It is far more detailed and better
constructed. But like that of S. Augustine, Bossuet's aim was partly
practical, and he boasted of a conversation with du Gouet which enabled
him to put the argument from the destruction of Jerusalem in a
convincing way. Bossuet treats more satisfactorily the course both of
profane and sacred history, ending with the establishment of the
definitely Catholic Empire in the West. This book, one of its author's
greatest, owes much to S. Augustine. M. Hardy wrote a volume, showing
how close was this dependence. That is in some degree true of all
Bossuet's work. Even Jansenism was hardly more deeply soaked in S.
Augustine than was Bossuet, who rarely preaches a sermon without an
allusion to him.

Vice's 'Nuova Scienzia' proves a problem. What was the influence of the
' De Civitate Dei' in this-- one of the most original and epoch-making
books of modern times? Dr. Billeri in 'Giovanni-Battista Vico e S.
Agostino' claims the mastery and originality all for S. Augustine, and
boldly transfers to him any honour given to Vico. This treatment is
extravagant. The purpose of the two writers is different. Augustine, it
cannot be too often repeated, is an apologist. Vico is above all an
enquirer. He wants to get a generalised scheme of historical
development, and to destroy what may be called the academic
superstition. His attitude towards the earlier ages of classical history
is curiously like that of Nietzsche. Above all he is anxious to rescue
Homer from the imputation of being a teacher of philosophy and morals in
the later sense, and to disabuse the reader of the notion that the
virtues honoured in the heroic age were those of a settled and peaceful
age, with the golden rule, at least in words, for its motto. He is
anxious to show that the original development of men started from pure
anarchism, with the patriarch ruling his family, as in the case of
Polyphemus, through a ruthless aristocracy to a popular government and
thence to monarchy (as, *e.g.* Rome), owing to the dissensions and
unwillingness of men to work together and submit to law.

With a strong belief in original sin, he claims that God as the author
of nature makes men's vices, lust, cruelty and ambition work together
for good, so as to establish a stable and law-abiding society. This is a
universal law all over the world. Feudalism in some form or other is the
beginning of government, and monarchy comes at the close. Thus Vico is
certainly at variance with writers like Filmer who treat monarchy as
original, no less than he is with believers in democracy. It is a scheme
entirely different from S. Augustine's --so different that at first
sight one is disinclined to see any parallel. But we notice *(a)* his
strong belief in the providential ordering of human affairs, *(b)* his
making original sin the beginning of all profane history, *(c)* his
reiterated assertion of the natural *sociability of man* as the eternal
law of his being, *(d)* his repeated references to the 'De Civitate Dei'
and his use of it, further, for his even more repeated use of ' Varro'
(whose work we have not in the original). We may compare Vico's belief
in Providence with S. Augustine's famous passage on the distribution of
kingdoms. Only Vico goes more deeply, for he has the modern scientific
spirit and its love of comparative method.

Augustine is mainly concerned with the Church, Vico with the world. It
is hard to say how far Vico was prompted by S. Augustine or whether he
intended consciously to counter his book. Probably the truer view is
that S. Augustine appealed to him by the sweep of his thought and by his
vision of world-history; but that, so far as the main idea is concerned,
Augustine ranked mainly as one writer among the many whom he cited.
\[<a href="#foot06" id="text06">6</a>\]

What Professor Flint says in his history of the ' Philosophy of History'
is worth citing:

'It must have strongly confirmed Vico in some of his most fundamental
convictions--in the belief of Providence in history, of order and law in
human affairs, of particular passions and interests being rendered by
supreme reason subservient to general ends, of the analogy of the growth
of the individual to that of the race, of the futility of Epicurean
chance and the Stoic fate, as principles of historical explanation. But
his theory of history is by no means a simple continuation of that of
Augustine; on the contrary, the differences between them are as profound
as their resemblances. Vico does not, like Augustine, look upon history
in relation to predestination, the fall, redemption, and the end of the
world, but as a manifestation of human nature and of fixed laws. He
conceives of Providence very distinctly from St. Augustine.'

Both the 'De Civitate Dei' and the 'Scienzia Nuova' are great books;
both suffer from a good deal of bad arrangement. Both are things to be
felt rather than learned. In different ways both have had enormous
influence on thought. But one is not the child of the other. They are
complementary, not contrary.

Notes to Lecture II

\[<a href="#text01" id="foot01">1</a>\] Reinkens, *Die
Geschichtsphilosophie des Heiligen Augustinus* (Schaffhausen, 1866),
inaugural address as Rector of Breslau University, p. 36.

'Die ganze Verfassung und das ganze Gesetzbuch des himmlischen Staates
ist in Einem Wort enthalten, und dies Wort heisst: *Freiheit.* Denn die
Macht des freien Willens ist in dem Menschen dann wie bei den guten
Engeln bis zu dem Grade für das Gute in seiner göttlichen Rangordnung
gesteigert, dass ihm eine Abweichung von der Ordnung der Liebe nicht
mehr möglich ist, ebenso wenig wie ein Rückfall aus dem verklärten
Zustand in den unverklärten. Ein Nöthigen in die Ordnung der Liebe durch
äussere Gesetze und Befehle unter Androhung von Strafen ist undenkbar in
dem Gottesstaate; in seinem ewigen Sabbate existirt auch der Begriff des
knechtischen Dienstes nicht mehr. Gott selbst trägt die Krone; aber die
Bürger des himmlischen Staates sind von Ihm mitgekrönt: sie herrschen
mit Ihm, in dem sie Ihm huldigen, und da sie Ihm loben, empfangen sie
Ehre, und die Geehrten erkennen ohne Ueberhebung, dass sie der Ehre
würdig sind, und Niemand raubt und Niemand neidet sie ihnen. So wird es
sein am Ende ohne Ende; denn welches andere Endziel hatten wir, als zu
gelangen in das Reich ohne Ende?'

\[<a href="#text02" id="foot02">2</a>\] H. Schmidt's two articles are to
be found in the *Jahrbücher für Deutsche Theologie* (Gotha, 1861); *Des
Augustinus Lehre von der Kirche,* vi. 197-255; and *Origenes und
Augustin als Apologeten,* vii. 237-281 and viii. 261-325.

\[<a href="#text03" id="foot03">3</a>\] H. Scholz, *Glaube und Unglaube
in der Weltgeschichte,* p. 47. 'Wenn es richtig ist dass
Geschichtsphilosophie und Soziologie zusammengehören, so ist Augustin
der erste gewesen, der diesen Zusammenhang innerlich erfasst und wirksam
ausgesprochen hat. Zwar hat schon Aristoteles den Menschen als ζωον
πολιτικόν gewürdigt, aber nur um den Staat daraus abzuleiten. . .
Augustin hat den Fortschritt zur Geschichte gemacht, und die Möglichkeit
des geschicht-lichen Lebens auf den geselligen Zusammenschluss der
Individuen gegründet. Er hat erkannt, dass es Geschichte nur da gibt und
dass Geschichte erst da beginnt, wo Menschen sind, die sich zu
geordnetem Mit- und Aufeinander wirken verbinden. Er hat diesen
Zusammenhang nicht nur geahnt, sondern deutlich ausgesprochen: unde Dei
civitas . . . vel inchoaretur exortu vel progrederetur excursu vel
adprehenderet debitos fines, si non esset socialis vita sanctorum? (xix.
5). Es ist nicht zuviel, wenn mann behauptet, dass Augustin sich durch
diesen einen Satz ein bleibendes Verdienst um die Philosophic der
Geschichte erworben hat; denn solange es eine Philosophic der Geschichte
gibt, wird sie mit diesem Satz beginnen und insofern immer auf Augustin
als ihren geistigen Vater zurückblicken dürfen.'

\[<a href="#text04" id="foot04">4</a>\] *Cf.* the following passages.
There are many more:

\(a\) De Civ. Dei, v. i.--' Divina providentia regna constituuntur
humana.'

\(b\) Ibid. v. ii.--' Sed nee exigui et contemptibilis animantis
viscera, nee avis pennulam, nee herbae flosculum, nee arboris folium
sine suarum partium convenientia et quadam veluti pace dereliquit; nullo
modo est credendus regna hominum, eorumque dominationes et servitutes a
suis providentiae legibus alienas esse voluisse.'

\(c\) Ibid. iv. 33.--' Deus igitur ille felicitatis auctor et dator,
quia solus est verus Deus, ipse dat regna terrena et bonis et malis.
Neque hoc temere et quasi fortuitu, quia Deus est, non fortuna, sed pro
rerum ordine ac temporum occulto nobis, notissimo sibi, cui tamen ordini
temporum non subditus servit, sed eum ipse tanquam dominus regit
moderatorque disponit. Felicitatem vero non dat nisi bonis. Hanc enim
possunt et non habere et habere servientes, possunt et non habere et
habere regnantes ; quae tamen plena in ea vita erit, ubi nemo jam
serviet. Et ideo regna terrena et bonis ab illo dantur et malis ne eius
cultores adhuc in provectu animi parvuli haec ab eo munera quasi magnum
aliquid concupiscant. Et hoc est sacramentum Veteris Testamenti, ubi
occultum erat novum, quod illic promissa et dona terrena sunt,
intelligentibus et tune spiritalibus quamvis nondum in manifestatione
praedicantibus, et quae illis temporalibus rebus significaretur
aeternitas, et in quibus Dei donis esset vera felicitas.'

\[<a href="#text05" id="foot05">5</a>\] *The Rules of Tyconius,* edited
by F. C. Burkitt. This should be read to see how close is the parallel.
Augustine knew this book and made a lengthy summary of it in the third
book of *De Doctrina Christiana.* Scholz, *Glaube und Unglaube in der
Weltgeschichte,* has much in detail about the dependence of S. Augustine
on Tyconius. The topic has been worked out by Hahn, *Tyconius Studien,*
in Bonwetsch und Seeberg, *Studien;* see vi. 2, also Haussleiter, *Prot.
Real-Encyclopädie,* xx. 851-5.

\[<a href="#text06" id="foot06">6</a>\] Nourisson, *Philosophie de S.
Augustin,* ii. 173. 'Sa conception d'une républic éternelle et
naturelle, la meilleure possible dans chacune de ses espéces et ordonnée
par la Providence divine, n'est qu'une application ou une transformation
savante de l'idée mère de la Cité de Dieu.'
