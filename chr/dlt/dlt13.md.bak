### CHAPTER XI.

### THE CHRISTIAN ADAPTATION OF JEWISH TEACHING.

ALTHOUGH, as we have seen in the preceding chapter, there are some
important points of contrast between the Gospel teaching and that of its
antecedents, nevertheless, as has already been pointed out, the former
is in many respects identical with the latter, so that it is true to say
that in many fundamental points the Gospel teaching concerning the
Second Advent is to be found in pre-Christian Jewish writings. These
points, which have been dealt with in earlier chapters, were: the
*signs* of the Second Coming, the actual Advent, the Judgement upon the
Wicked, the Reward of the Righteous, some other points of subsidiary
importance, and the characteristics and Personality of the Son of Man,
namely His pre-existence before the creation of the world, His universal
Kingdom, His Kingship, and His character of Judge.

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

\[paragraph continues\] All this teaching, which we have been accustomed
to regard as specifically Christian, we find already fully developed,
not only in pre-Christian times, but for the most part in literature
which is not regarded as being on the same level with the Old Testament
Scriptures.

The question naturally arises, and presses for an answer: Is the Gospel
teaching merely an adaptation of what was taught in certain unorthodox
Jewish circles--for the *Book of Enoch*, for example, was never accepted
as Scripture by the orthodox Pharisaic party? Or, if this is not so,
what is one to say in view of the incontrovertible fact that a
pre-Christian book, such as the one just mentioned, has, in many vital
particulars, the identical teaching on the subject of the Second Advent
as that of the Gospels? It is obvious that a great deal turns upon the
answer to this question. There are not wanting those who maintain that
the whole of the Gospel teaching concerning the Second Advent is to be
taken in an allegorical, not in a literal sense; they would say that the
struggles of conscience are the signs of the Advent, and that the
spiritual entrance of Christ into our hearts is the real Second Coming;
that when we are punished

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

for our sins it is Christ's judgement upon us, and that peace of mind
and the consciousness of doing what is right is Christ's reward of the
just. That is to say, they regard the whole account as mystic allegory.
They point out, further, that just as the Jews were mistaken in their
conceptions concerning the promised Messiah, and just as the early
Christians, including the Apostles themselves, were mistaken in their
expectation of the almost immediate reappearance of Christ, so, too,
Christians of to-day are mistaken in believing that Christ will actually
come again in glory with ten thousands of His angels. And they turn to
us and say: "After all, your Gospel teaching on this subject is only the
repetition of some erroneous Jewish notions, applied to Jesus
Christ--erroneous Jewish notions found to a large extent in a book, to
enhance the importance of which the author pretended was written by
Enoch, the man of whom it was said that, 'he walked with God; and he was
not; for God took him.'" How are we to answer statements of this kind?
Merely to accuse those who make them of irreligion, blasphemy, or the
like, is unscientific, unwise, and unchristian; the days in which a
simple iteration of the faith was deemed sufficient

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

are gone; we must give the reason of the hope that is in us; we must at
least try and satisfy *ourselves*, even if we cannot satisfy others. And
how is the average Christian going to answer to *himself* the objections
which have just been pointed out, objections which the sceptical
attitude of our age with regard to all belief urges with ever greater
insistency? Certainly it is no easy matter; we are under the additional
disadvantage of having to acknowledge that we can neither prove that our
belief is right, nor that the objections of others are wrong; short of
the actual coming to pass of the Second Advent, it is impossible to
prove that the prophecies regarding it, contained in the Gospels or
elsewhere, are true. Nevertheless, there are two prime considerations
which, though far from constituting anything in the nature of a proof,
do show the precariousness of the position taken up by those who reject
as untenable the Gospel teaching concerning the Second Coming of Christ.

 

§i. It will be remembered that in a previous chapter great stress was
laid upon two concurrent ideas which our Lord connects with the title of
"The Son of Man"; His own words, which were quoted, showed that His

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

use of that title connected it at one time with humiliation and
suffering, at another with glory and majesty; and that when used with
the latter it was almost always in connection with the Second Coming. It
was, further, pointed out that in the words, "Behoved it not the Christ
to suffer these things, and to enter into His glory," our Lord summed up
two great prophecies concerning the Messiah in the past, viz., the
conception of the "Suffering Servant," in *The Book of Isaiah*, and the
conception of "The Son of Man" in His glory, in *The Book of the
Similitudes of Enoch*. <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md) Let us think
of this for a little.

The picture of the "Servant of the Lord," with its most sublime
description in Isa. liii., depicts, as we know, the ministering aspect
of our Blessed Lord's life here on earth in a way which has bound
thinking Christians with a holy fascination ever since the Resurrection
of our Saviour; the reason of this has been not only the exquisite
beauty and heart-moving pathos of the thoughts expressed, but the
positively astounding accuracy of the prophecy as fulfilled in our Lord.
A convinced sceptic, though one who possessed the historic sense, on
having read the fifty-third

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

chapter of Isaiah and then the life of our Lord, and being asked what he
thought about it all, replied: "It looks as though the life were lived
in order to fulfil the prophecy!" The answer was characteristic, but
profoundly significant. Let only these few points of correspondence be
recalled:--*He was despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with grief* (Isa. liii. 3); *And they smote his head with a
reed, and did spit upon him . . . and they led him out to crucify him*
(Matt. xv. 17, 20);--"despised and rejected!" And in His own words the
Man of Sorrows cries: *My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death*
(Mark xiv. 34). Again, *He was wounded for our transgressions, he was
bruised for our iniquities . . . with his stripes we are healed; all we
like sheep have gone astray . . . and the Lord hath laid on him the
iniquity of us all* (Isa. liii. 5, 6); the fact that words like these
were so alien to the Jewish conception of atonement makes it all the
more wonderful when we read them in the light of such sayings as these:
*This cup is the new covenant in my blood, even that which is poured out
for you* (Luke xxii. 20); *I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd
layeth down his life for the sheep* (John x. 11). Once more; the
sentence:

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *He was cut of out of the land of the living*
(Isa. liii. 8) was impossible for the prophet's contemporaries to
comprehend fully, for the words contained a truth which could only be
properly understood in the light of fuller revelation; but the
evangelists must have realised how true they were, when they recorded:
*There they crucified him* (Matt. xxvii. 35; Mark xv. 25; Luke xxiii.
33; John xix. 18). It would not be difficult to show how that almost the
whole of this wonderful chapter is a prophecy concerning "The Son of
Man" as the *Man of Sorrows*. This is acknowledged on all hands, so that
it will not be necessary to emphasise it further. The reason, however,
for which attention is drawn to this fact now is that our Lord Himself
accepts the prophecy as applying to Him; quite apart from its fulfilment
in His life and work, which we can see for ourselves, is *His*
acceptation of it; this is clear, apart from many other quotations that
could be given, from His words: *Behoved it not the Christ to suffer
these things?* For it goes on to say: *And beginning from Moses and from
all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the
things concerning himself* (Luke xxiv. 27). This means, therefore, that
as

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

regards that aspect of His teaching about the Son of Man which depicts
Him as humiliated and despised He acknowledges the truth, the absolute
truth, of what had been foretold. Is this not an *a priori* argument in
favour of the fact that the prophecy concerning the *other* aspect of
the Son of Man is also true? Let us enumerate the points in their
logical sequence. The title "The Son of Man" in the Gospels is only used
by our Lord; His teaching concerning "The Son of Man" consists of two
parts which are apparently contradictory, and may be described by the
two words: Humiliation, Glory. There are prophecies concerning each; in
the former case the prophecy is seen to have been literally fulfilled in
the life, suffering, and death of "The Son of Man"; but apart from this
Christ corroborates the truth of what was prophesied, and confesses that
it applied to Him. That is to say, the first part of His teaching
concerning "The Son of Man" was proved to be true both in prophecy and
fulfilment. The conclusion, therefore, is a fair one when it is
contended that this fact justifies the presumption that the second part
of the teaching is true also. It is not possible to separate the two
elements in the teaching concerning "The

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Son of Man," which our Lord so frequently
emphasises; and, therefore, if one element has been historically proved
to have been correct, there is an *a priori* probability that the second
also will in the future be shown to have been correct.

It will have been noticed that the argument used is what might be termed
"forensic," and is not one that would necessarily be asked for by
believers with an unquestioning faith; but our sympathy has, so far,
been with the large and growing numbers of those who find it very
difficult to accept the New Testament teaching concerning the Second
Advent; and the argument used, if carefully considered, must at least
show the *precariousness* of declining to accept our Lord's words about
His Second Coming. In our Law Courts the testimony of even the humblest
witness is enhanced in value if he is known to have borne true testimony
before. How much more, therefore, must this be so when Jesus Christ
bears witness concerning Himself. It may, of course, be objected that
much of what we read in the Eschatology of the Gospels does not belong
to the original teaching of Christ, but has been put into His mouth by
the compilers of the sources from which the Gospels

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

were written; but a study of the eschatological passages in the Gospels
and the teaching of our Lord on the subject shows that they constitute
such a large portion of the whole material of the synoptic accounts that
to regard them *in toto* as unoriginal, and therefore to deny their
authenticity, is quite out of the question. Even were it granted that in
some particulars words have been put into the mouth of Christ which He
never uttered, this would not be of much use from the objector's point
of view; *for the fact is that the Gospels are saturated with
eschatological teaching*. Nor could we well expect it to be otherwise,
for while it is undoubtedly true that Christ's teaching is full of
guidance for life on this earth, yet the main importance of this life,
according to that teaching, lies in the fact that it is merely
preparatory for the world to come. The point of view of all the Gospel
teaching is other-worldly, everything looks to the world to come,
everything is subordinated to the thought of the Hereafter. How, then,
should it be possible to eliminate the eschatological teaching of
Christ, or any considerable part of it, from the Gospels? Is it always
sufficiently realised how many of the parables are eschatological

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

in character? It is not too much to say that the facts of the case
compel us to see that the eschatological teaching in the Gospels is, in
the main, Christ's; if it were not so the Gospels might as well never
have been written.

§ii. But there is another consideration; a deeper one, and more
difficult to follow; and neither believers nor doubters can afford to
ignore it.

We know--or at all events we claim to know, owing to the fuller
revelation that we have received from God--that Absolute Truth and the
Godhead are inseparable. Our Lord, when standing before Pilate, said:
*Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice*; <span
id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md) and to Pilate's answer: *What is Truth?*
no reply was returned; He who had said: *I am the Truth* was standing
before Pilate. Absolute Truth and the Godhead are inseparable. For this
reason we find that some of the most cherished truths of Christianity
are already adumbrated prior to the time of Christ; and if the Godhead
and Truth must be in evidence at all times, it is what must be demanded
when we find Truth irrepressible. Unquestionably it is the fact, that
Truth will often be clothed in

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

fantastic garb; but that is due to human fancy, not to anything that is
wanting in Truth itself. If God is eternal, and if Truth is eternal,
those things that are true must from their nature manifest themselves
according to man's capacity for grasping the Truth. For this reason
man's belief in a Creator, with all that that word implies for us, is
inherent in Human Nature: also, man's yearning for a Redeemer is
inherent in Human Nature. These facts are indisputable, as the study of
the beliefs of primitive man prove. <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92.md)
If now--and this is the point that we have been aiming for--we find
certain fundamental truths of Christianity in existence before the time
of Christ, we have every justification for believing that since they
belong to Truth, they belong also to *the nature of things*. Let an
instance be given: The Incarnation generally, and in particular the
Virgin Birth. Here is an instance of Virgin Birth--a pre-Christian
instance: "It is said that one day the Virgin Ocrisia, a slave-woman of
Queen Tanaquil, was offering, as usual, cakes and libations on the royal
hearth, when a flame shot out towards her from the fire. Taking

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

this for a sign that her handmaiden was to be the mother of a more than
mortal son, the wise Queen Tanaquil bade the girl array herself as a
bride and lie down beside the hearth. Her orders were obeyed: Ocrisia
conceived by the god or spirit of the fire, and in due time brought
forth Tullus Servius, the future King of Rome, who was thus born a
slave, being the reputed son of a slave mother and a divine father, the
fire god." <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) The *clothing* of the
truth is folly; but that does not detract from the fact of the
conception of the possibility of Virgin Birth being a true conception.

The belief in human gods, and divine men, is so universal among all
races of the world, whether civilised or uncivilised, that it is
unnecessary to give any examples; <span id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94.md)
but the existence of such beliefs shows that the conception of
Incarnation lies in the nature of things.

In view of such things as these the alternative, of course, is as to
whether Christianity has merely adapted heathen beliefs, or whether, as
we have been trying to point out, Absolute Truth must assert itself, and
that therefore

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

these pre-Christian examples are merely adumbrations of truths which men
in those times were incapable of understanding in their essential,
spiritual meaning.

For Christians to whom the Truth has been revealed there can scarcely be
any doubt about the matter. If there is anything in the Incarnation and
the Virgin Birth which partakes of the nature of Absolute Truth, then
they belong to *the nature of things*, a high, mysterious,
super-sensuous "nature," but still belonging to the things that are. And
therefore men have formed conceptions based upon these truths, just in
the same way in which they formed their conceptions concerning the
existence of God; that which is in the nature of things will and *must*
find expression in one form or another in all ages, though the
expression and form will necessarily vary according to man's varying
capacity for apprehending Truth.

And now, after this necessary digression, to return once more, and quite
briefly, to our main subject. Upon the analogy of what has just been
said, we must regard, at all events in its essence, the pre-Christian
teaching of the Second Advent as containing elements of Absolute Truth;
for if we are justified, as we

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

believe we are, in worshipping Jesus Christ as the Son of God, and in
regarding His teaching as expressing in its essence Absolute Truth, then
we must see in his words regarding the Second Advent no merely an
adaptation of earlier teaching, but rather *the reiteration of Truth*.
Or, to put it still more plainly, we set ourselves the question: What is
one to say in view of the incontrovertible fact that a pre-Christian
book has, in many vital particulars, the identical teaching on the
Second Coming of Christ as that of the Gospels? The reply is that,
inasmuch as that which partakes of the nature of Absolute Truth *must*
assert itself--though it may be in very diverse garb--therefore in some
form or another it will appear and press itself to the fore, at
different periods of the world's history; so, as the teaching of the
Second Coming, or, shall we say, of the Final Appearance on earth of The
Son of Man, is in its essence Truth, therefore, in common with other
truths, it pressed itself into the minds of receptive seers and became
part of the world's common stock of accumulated Truth. At what
particular time in the world's history men became cognisant of this
particular item of Absolute Truth is really immaterial, since

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

it must always have been in existence; but it received for us the final
seal when Christ proclaimed that it *was* true.

Of course, it may be that we are entirely wrong; it may be that the
whole pre-Christian teaching about this Second Coming is nothing more
than speculative dreaming; it may be that words have been put into the
mouth of Christ which He never uttered; or it may be, as some maintain
nowadays, that Christ was mistaken in common with earlier Jewish
teachers. All these things *may* be; but the point here insisted upon is
that this great subject, in which so much is involved, cannot be
dismissed of hand in such a manner; there are too many elements that
demand consideration in connection with it; it contains too much that is
confessedly true, its intrinsic probability (as will be seen in a
moment) is too great, than that it should be cast aside as incredible,
at any rate by men who have the scientific sense. For what in its
deepest signification is the *raison d’être* of the Second Coming? It is
this: The final overthrow of Evil, and the Supremacy of Spirit; would
anybody in their senses be prepared to deny that, at least, the best
part of Humanity yearns for these things? Why, this, in the

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

last instance, is the burden of every philosophical system that has ever
been evolved; it is the goal of all things; it is that which every man
and woman who has ever thought sufficiently about the subject is
convinced must sooner or later come to pass. Who would acquiesce in the
eternal existence of the principle of Evil? Who does not see that the
spirit is greater than that which is merely material? Who would not
welcome the final supremacy of spirit? What Christian does not *expect*
this?

And this is what *in its essence* the Second Coming means; it must
assuredly be apparent that this partakes of the nature of Absolute
Truth. Or should objection be taken to the details which we read of in
the accounts of the Second Coming? Enmities among men, plagues, wars,
cataclysms and other cosmic disturbances? Alas, we know too well that
most of these things are always prevalent among men, and if the *virus*
of iniquity should work with more concentrated force on the eve of its
final annihilation, there would really be nothing insurmountably
incredible in that. As to the cosmic disturbances, it is still possible
to see a moral significance in them. Nor need the language regarding the

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

presence of angelic hosts, and the *rôle* assigned to them, be looked
upon as entirely figurative. The moon being turned to blood, and the
stars dropping from heaven, etc.--these elements are, likely enough,
Oriental imagery; but *they* are not the things that trouble men's
belief regarding the Second Coming. We must look to the larger issues,
the permanent principles that are involved, the abiding element of
Absolute Truth which the teaching concerning the Second Coming contains.

If this is done, then, it is maintained, that although we cannot in the
nature of things *prove* the truth of Christ's teaching on the subject,
nevertheless, as we have tried to show, the intrinsic probability of its
truth makes it precarious to disbelieve in the doctrine of the Second
Advent.

In so far as there has been Christian adaptation of Jewish teaching in
this matter, it has been because the latter contained elements of
Absolute Truth. *Think not that I came to destroy the Law, or the
Prophets: I came not to destroy, but to, fulfil*.
