### CHAPTER VIII.

### THE COMING OF THE MESSIAH, THE SON OF MAN.

WE have dealt hitherto almost exclusively with pre-Christian teaching;
but we proceed now a step further, and in examining the subject of the
Advent of the "Son of Man," we shall, while starting from the Old
Testament and Apocalyptic literature, be here mainly occupied with the
Gospel teaching. The consideration of the history of the title "the Son
of Man" affords a natural transition from Jewish to Christian
Eschatology; and while it is far from our intention to study
exhaustively the history of this title, some little detail will,
nevertheless, be necessary.

We must first of all deal with the seventh chapter of the book of
Daniel; <span id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md)' in verses 13, 14 of this
chapter we read as follows:

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there
came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came
even unto the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him. And
there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the
peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an
everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that
which shall not be destroyed*.

Here it is to be noted that this one who is "like unto a son of man"
comes "*with* the clouds of heaven"; it is no fanciful distinction when
one points out the difference between coming *upon* the clouds, and
coming *with* the clouds; the former is only used of God Almighty
(*e.g.*, Isa. xxi. 1; Psalm civ. 3). There is, therefore, some reason in
the writer's mind for using the expression *with* the clouds, instead of
*upon* the clouds. And the reason is not far to seek; the meaning of the
vision is that the future world-ruler is to be not from the earth, but
from Heaven; that is to say, the coming rule or kingdom is to be
divinely appointed, and it is to be a *human* rule, hence the expression
"a son of man"; and here again it is very important to notice that the
phrase "a son of man" is widely

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

different from "The Son of Man"; the former, "a son of man," is merely
the Aramaic way of expressing a "human being"; and the point of the
vision is that it declares that the ruler in this coming kingdom, though
sent by God (and in that sense from Heaven), is a human being. In the
vision the contrast is brought out between the beasts arising out of the
sea, who are symbolic of the world-powers that have been, and the one
who is like unto a son of man, *i.e.*, who is symbolic of the future
ruler of the kingdom to come. But it is an earthly kingdom; and from the
twenty-seventh verse of this chapter it is plain that this one who is
like unto a son of man symbolises the Israelite nation: *And the
kingdom, and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the
whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most
High; his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall
serve and obey him* (see, too, verses 18-22). Thus, while the title "Son
of Man" is originally derived from this passage in the book of Daniel,
it does not there denote anything more than that he to whom it is
applied is a *human being*.

The next step in the history of the title "Son of Man" is its
consideration in that

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

portion of *Ethiopic Book of Enoch* called the *Similitudes*, *i.e.*,
chaps. xxxvii.--lxx.; these belong approximately, as we have already
seen, to 94-64 B.C.

In the first place, the "Son of Man" is here spoken of as existing
before the beginning of the world: "At that hour that Son of Man was
named before the Lord of Spirits, and his name before the Ancient of
Days. Before the sun and the signs (of the Zodiac) were created, before
the stars of Heaven were made his name was uttered before the Lord of
Spirits. <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md) He shall be a staff for the
righteous and for the holy ones, that they may rest on him and not fall;
he shall be the light of the Gentiles, <span
id="fr_66"></span>[2](#fn_66.md) and the hope of those who are sad at
heart. <span id="fr_67"></span>[3](#fn_67.md) . . . For this reason hath he
been chosen and hidden before Him (*i.e.*, God) before the world was
created, and unto eternity (he shall be) before Him. And the wisdom of
the Lord of Spirits hath revealed him to the holy and righteous . . ."
(xlviii. 2-7). To this belief in the pre-existence of the "Son of Man"
before the creation of the world must be added the conception of his
Kingdom,

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

which is to be a universal one; he is described as, in a very real
sense, the king of kings; for example, in the *Similitudes* lxii. 3f.,
we read: "And there will stand up in that day all the kings and the
mighty, and the exalted, and those who hold the earth, and they will see
and recognise him as he sits on the throne of his glory. . . . And the
kings and the mighty and all who possess the earth will glorify and
bless and extol him who rules over all--who was hidden . . ." (verses
2-9, *cf.* xlv. 4-5). The idea of this universal dominion is further
emphasised by the fact that the Son of Man is described as sitting upon
the throne of God Almighty: "And the Chosen One shall sit upon My throne
in those days, and all the secrets of wisdom will come forth from the
thoughts of his mouth; for the Lord of Spirits hath given it to him, and
hath glorified him." <span id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68.md) One other
point, which is of especial importance for our present purpose, is that
this Son of Man is described as coming to judge the world: "He (the Son
of Man) sat himself upon the throne of his glory, and the sum of
judgement was committed unto him, the Son of Man, and he caused the
sinners and they that have led the world

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

astray to disappear from the face of the earth and to be destroyed; with
chains shall they be bound, and they shall be imprisoned in the place
where they shall be gathered together (a place of) destruction" (lxix.
27, 28; lxii. 3-5). That this throne is God's throne is clear from li.
3; "And the Chosen One will in those days sit upon My throne. . . ." How
exactly these thoughts are reflected in the Gospels will already have
been realised, but it may be well to illustrate this very briefly. The
pre-existence of the Son of Man is taught in the Gospels, for example,
in John xvii. 24: *Father, that which thou hast given me, I will that,
where I am, they also may be with me; that they may behold my glory,
which thou hast given me; for thou lovedst me before the foundation of
the world* (*cf.* John xvii. 5). The universality of His kingdom as
taught in the Gospels is seen, for example, in Matt. xxviii. 18, 19:
*And Jesus came unto them and spake unto them, saying, All authority
hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth. Go ye therefore, and
make disciples of all nations*. . . Further, for the thought of the Son
of Man sitting upon the throne of God, one recalls such words as those
contained in Matt. xxv. 31: *But when the Son of Man shall come in* 

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

*his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne
of his glory* (*cf.* Matt. xix. 28); especially when one reads this in
connection with such a passage as John xvii. 5: *And now, O Father,
glorify me with thy own self with the glory which I had with thee before
the world was*. And, lastly, for the truth that the Son of Man will come
to judge, see John v. 22: *For neither doth the Father judge any man,
but he hath given all judgement unto the Son*; John v. 27: *And he gave
him authority to execute judgement, because he is the Son of Man*; John
v. 30: *My judgement is righteous*.

It will be seen, on comparing the conception of the "Son of Man" in the
book of Daniel with that contained in this section of *Eth. Enoch*
(*i.e.*, the *Similitudes*), that there is a vital difference between
the two; for in the former the "Son of Man" appears as the type or
symbol of the nation of Israel; his *human* personality is emphasised;
while in the latter he is presented as a *supernatural* person.
Moreover, in the former the indefiniteness of the phrase "like unto a
son of man," is very different from the distinct "the Son of Man" in the
latter. Very important is the fact, therefore, that in the *Similitudes*
of Enoch we meet for the *first* 

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

*time* with the title "The Son of Man." That is to say that, roughly
speaking, eighty years before the birth of Christ, we have a
presentation of a personality, called the "Son of Man," who is believed
to have existed before the creation of world, whose kingdom is to be a
universal one, who sits upon the throne of God, and who is described as
coming to be the Judge of the world.

That in both the book of Daniel and in the *Similitudes* of Enoch the
title, "The Son of Man," is used in reference to the Messiah does not
require formal proof; it is only necessary to read the passages in
question in order to see that the fact is obvious; the Messiah and "The
Son of Man" are identical. <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md)

Now we have next to consider the title of "The Son of Man" in the
Gospels. The first point to notice, and it is a highly significant one,
is that this title is never used excepting by our Lord Himself; an
exception, the solitary one that exists, is seen in John xii. 34, where
the multitude use it; but even here it is clear that they are only
quoting words which Christ had used concerning Himself: *The multitude
therefore answered him*,

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *We have heard out of the law that Christ
abideth for ever: and how sagest thou, The Son of Man must be lifted up?
Who is this Son of Man?* The only time in which it is used in the New
Testament outside the Gospels is in Acts vii. 56, where St. Stephen
says: *Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on
the right hand of God*; but these words, spoken before the Sanhedrin,
are in reality a quotation of words of similar import which our Lord
Himself had used before the same assembly: <span
id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70.md) *But from henceforth shall the Son of Man
be seated at the right hand of the power of God* (Luke xxii. 69); so
that in this case, too, the title is only used in a quotation of our
Lord's own words concerning Himself. <span id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_71.md)

Next, we must see in what connection our Lord uses the title; and here
we shall have to notice that there are two entirely different sets of
ideas which He uses in connection with it. This is very striking, and at
first, not altogether easy to understand. Firstly, our Lord uses the
title "Son of Man" in regard

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

to Himself in such a manner as to make it appear as though it were a
term of humiliation; this will be clear in recalling such words as
these: *The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests;
but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head* (Matt. viii. 20; Luke
ix. 58); *The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold,
a gluttonous man, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners*
(Matt. xi. 19; Luke vii. 34); speaking against the Son of Man is
forgiven, not so if the Holy Spirit is spoken against (Matt. xii. 32;
Luke xii. 10); the *suffering* of the Son of Man is referred to by
Christ in a number of passages (Matt. xvii. 12; Mark viii. 13; Luke ix.
22; John 14, etc.); so, too, His betrayal; and Christ says that, *The
Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give
his life a ransom for many* (Matt. xx. 28; Mark x. 45). All these
passages speak of the "Son of Man" in connection with suffering and
humiliation; and if the Gospels contained only passages like those just
referred to, when speaking of the "Son of Man," we should be wholly
justified in regarding the title "Son of Man" as indicating our Lord's
human nature in contrast to passages which speak of Him as

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

the "Son of God," as laying stress on His Divine Nature. But there are a
considerably larger number of passages in which the title is used in
connection with the ideas of glory, honour, and majesty. To give but a
few examples: The Son of Man is able to forgive sins (Matt. ix. 6,
etc.); He is Lord of the Sabbath (Mark ii. 28, etc.); it is He Who sows
the good seed, in the parable of the wheat and tares (Matt, xiii.
24-30); but above all, and this is exceedingly important, almost always
when Christ speaks of His *Second Coming* He uses the title of the Son
of Man, this more than thirty times in the Gospels; and among these
passages it is very interesting to notice how frequently the thought of
His coming *to judge the world* is either prominent or understood
without being actually expressed. Only one or two examples of this need
be cited: *For the Son of Man shall come in the glory of his Father with
his angels; and then shall he render unto every man according to his
deeds* (Matt. xvi. 27, 28); *And then shall he send forth the angels,
and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the
uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven* (Mark xiii.
27); *For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of* 

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

*him shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory,
and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels* (Luke xi. 26); and
just one other striking passage: *But when the Son of Man shall come in
his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne
of his glory; and before him shall be gathered all the nations; and he
shall separate them one front another, as the shepherd separateth the
sheep from the goats* (Matt. xxv. 31, 32). The judgement-scene that
follows will be familiar, and need not be further dealt with here.

The following table, which contains all the passages of the Gospels in
which the title "The Son of Man" is used, will fully illustrate what has
just been said.

Passages in which the title "The Son of Man" is used in connection with
the ideas of *suffering and humiliation*:--

birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his
head. (*Cf.* Luke ix. 58.)

Behold a gluttonous man, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and
sinners (*Cf.* Luke vii. 34.)

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

Matt. xii. 32: And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man,
it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy
Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in that
which is to come. (*Cf.* Mark iii. 28-31; Luke xii. 10.)

of the whale; so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in
the heart of the earth. (*Cf.* Luke xi. 30-32.)

Matt. xvi. 13: . . . He asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that
the Son of Man is? (*Cf.* Mark viii. 27; Luke ix. 18; the context in
each case points to the idea of the Suffering Christ.)

Matt. xvii. 12, 13:. . . But I say unto you that Elijah is come already,
and they knew him not, but did unto him whatsoever they listed. Even so
shall the Son of Man also suffer of them. (Mark ix. 12, 13.)

Galilee, saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands
of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

John iii. 13, 14, 15: And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he that
descended out of heaven, even the Son of Man \[which is in
Heaven\]. <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72.md) And as Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up;
that whosoever believeth in him may have eternal life.

John viii. 28: Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of
Man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself,
but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

John xii. 34: The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of
the law that the Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou, The Son
of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?

Passages in which the title "The Son of Man" is used in connection with
the ideas of *power*, *glory*, and *honour*:--

Matt. ix. 6: But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on
earth to forgive sins (then saith he to the sick of the palsy), Arise,
and take up thy bed, and go into thy house. (Mark ii. 10, 11; Luke v.
24.)

Matt. x. 23: Verily, I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone through the

the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and

shaken; and then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven; and
then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son
of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he
shall send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they
shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of
heaven to the other. (Mark xiii. 24-27.)

Matt. xxiv. 37-44: And as were the days of Noah, so shall be the coming
of the Son of Man. For as in those days which were before the flood they
were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day
that Noah entered into the ark, and they knew not until the flood came,
and took them all away; so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man
Therefore be ye also ready; for in an hour that ye

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

think not the Son of Man cometh. (Luke xii. 40; xvii. 26-37.)

Matt. xxv. 31-33: But when the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and
all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory,
and before him shall be gathered all the nations; and he shall separate
them one from another, as a shepherd separateth the sheep from the
goats; and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on
the left. (*Cf.* Luke xxi. 27, 28, 36.)

angels. (Luke ix. 26; *cf.* xii. 8.)

Luke xviii. 8: Howbeit when the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith
on the earth?

Luke xix. 10: For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was
lost.

John i. 51: And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye
shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and
descending upon the Son of Man. (*Cf.* John vi. 62.)

John vi. 27: Work not for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat
which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of Man shall give unto
you; for him the Father, even God, hath sealed. (*Cf.* John vi. 53.)

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

John xii. 23, 24: And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come,
that the Son of Man should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by
itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit. (*Cf.* John xiii.
31.)

 

These facts regarding Our Lord's use of the title The Son of Man" in
regard to Himself present us, therefore, with a problem which is well
worth pondering. The intimate connection between humiliation and glory,
between the Sufferer and the Judge, which the title "The Son of Man"
connotes in the mouth of our Lord, must obviously be intentional, a
great truth must underlie the whole thing--the question is, Can we
fathom it? Nothing can be clearer than that it utterly puzzled the
disciples; but it is also certain that we are to-day in a better
position to unravel the problem than can have been the case with the
disciples.

We shall find ourselves assisted more than half-way by recalling the
words of our Lord, after His Resurrection, to the two disciples whom He
met on the way to Emmaus; He said unto them: *O foolish men, and slow of
heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Behoved it not
the Christ to suffer* 

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

*these things, and to enter into his glory? And beginning from Moses and
from all the prophets he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the
things concerning himself*. (Luke xxiv. 25-27.) What must strike one
here, first of all, is that our Lord refers to the past; He says, almost
in so many words, that there is really nothing new, nothing to be
surprised at, in all that had happened, because it was the fulfilment
and realisation of what the prophets had spoken of long ago. It is
certain, therefore, that for a solution of the problem before us we must
look to the past; and in the words just quoted--"Behoved it not the
Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?"--the two
great thoughts concerning the Messiah in the past are summed up. The
first is to be found in the book of Isaiah, the second in the book of
Enoch. Does it offend some to hear this? "What is this book of Enoch,"
some will say, "that is thus coupled with the book of Isaiah? How can a
book that does not even belong to the *Apocrypha* (let alone the
canonical Scriptures) be mentioned side by side with that which stands
first among the Old Testament books?" Some people have put the question
in another way: "How comes it that the book which

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

contains the most wonderful account of the Son of Man from the point of
view of His majesty and glory, which describes the Advent of the Son of
Man in terms practically identical with those of the Gospels--how comes
it that such a book was never admitted into the Old Testament Canon? No
doubt the Pharisees and the Scribes could have told us. Be that as it
may, of this fact there can be no doubt: that as the book of Isaiah
foretells the Gospel story of the Suffering Messiah in a way that no
other book does, so does the book of Enoch describe the Gospel account
of the coming of the Son of Man in His glory in a way that no other book
does. When, therefore, we find that in the Gospels the Son of Man
appears, on the one hand, as humiliated, the object of scorn, and the
Sufferer, and, on the other hand, as the glorious King and Judge, it
means that the prophecies of both the book of Isaiah and the book of
Enoch find their fulfilment in Christ, the Son of Man, and Christ, the
Son of God. *Behoved it not the Christ to suffer these things and to
enter into His glory?--His visage was so marred more than any man; and
his form more than the sons of men* (Isa. liii. 14); there we get the
connection

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

with the expression "son of man," but it is purely human. Again, *He was
despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows and acquainted with
grief* (Isa. liii. 3); *he was wounded for our transgressions, he was
bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him;
and with his stripes we are healed . . . the Lord hath laid on him the
iniquity of us all* (verses 5, 6). And the other seer said: "The Son of
Man sat himself upon the throne of his glory, and the sum of judgement
was committed unto him" (Eth. Enoch lix. 27); "And there will stand up
in that day all the kings and the mighty, the exalted, and they that
possess the land; they shall see and know him when he sits upon the
throne of his glory, and righteous judgement shall there be in his
presence, and no lie shall be spoken before him" (*Eth. Enoch* lii.
3). <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md)

As in days of old, so now: "We believe that Thou shalt come to be our
Judge"; but as in days of old, so now: "We pray Thee, therefore, help
Thy servants, whom Thou halt redeemed with Thy precious blood," Our
redemption is through His suffering; but the Judge comes in glory.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

The problem connected with the title of "The Son of Man" in the Gospels
may thus be explained by saying that Christ teaches the doctrine of His
Human and Divine nature by accepting the prophecies which had gone
before concerning the Son of Man, and regarding them as applying to
Himself; and His use of the title may therefore be said to sum up
diverse and apparently contradictory ideas which had long been in
existence, but which, as was inevitable, men had very inadequately
understood.

Apocalyptic literature.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_64"></span>[147:1](dlt10.htm#fr_64.md) The phrase "son of man"
which occurs frequently in the book of Ezekiel, is merely a mode of
address, and has nothing to do with the present subject.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[150:1](dlt10.htm#fr_65.md) *Cf.* further Kautzsch,
*Die Apokryphen und Pseudepigraphen des AT*. I. 264, note.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[150:2](dlt10.htm#fr_66.md) See Isa. xlii. 6; xlix.
6; John viii. 12.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[150:3](dlt10.htm#fr_67.md) *Cf.* Matt. xi. 28.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[151:1](dlt10.htm#fr_68.md) See John xvii. 1, 5.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[154:1](dlt10.htm#fr_69.md) For a very valuable
contribution to the history of the title Son of Man in pre-Christian
literature, see Dalman, *Die Worte Jesu*, pp. 191-219.

Worte Jesu*, p. 206.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[155:2](dlt10.htm#fr_71.md) The phrase which occurs
in Rev. i. 13, xiv. 14, is used in the same sense as in the book of
Ezekiel; while in Heb. ii. 6 it refers only to one who is of the human
race; *i.e.*, in the one case it is a mode of address, in the other a
way of describing one born of a woman.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[160:1](dlt10.htm#fr_72.md) The words in square
brackets are not well attested.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[167:1](dlt10.htm#fr_73.md) These are only a very
few of the appropriate passages which could he cited.
