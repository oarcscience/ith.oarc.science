### Nineteenth Century

The Austrian monarch desired that the new pontiff (Pius VII) should come
to Vienna but Pius, flanked and fortified by his friend Consalvi, was
determined he should take possession of his rightful capital, which at
this time was garrisoned by the soldiery of the King of Naples and under
the command of Sir John Acton, a Catholic Englishman.

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The pope arrived
in Rome during the hot summer of 1800 and as usual the citizens were
profuse with their cheers and noisy acclamations. They thought this new
sovereign a fine-looking fellow. He was handsome and did not look his
sixty years. He had a reputation for generosity and tolerance and it
seemed as though a happy reign might be commencing. A treaty was made
with the Neapolitans and quickly the pontiff set about putting the
affairs of his small territory in order although at the same time an
anxious eye was turned to the North; for once again Bonaparte,
audaciously dragging his cannon across the Alps, had defeated the
Austrians, this time at Marengo. What would be the outcome of these
continual French victories? Would there be a vaster and more terrible
persecution of the Church? The pious trembled and all men wondered.
Happily the answer was not long in coming. Bonaparte became First
Consul, the supreme director of the French destiny, and in surveying his
position his keen vision detected the plain fact that the structure of a
tranquil and successful State is incomplete without religion. "I am
aware that in no State," he said to the amazement of the Parisians, "can
a man be truly virtuous and upright unless he knows whence he comes and
whither he is going. Unaided reason cannot tell us these things. Without
religion, we grope in the dark. But the Catholic faith throws a clear
light upon the origin and the destiny of human beings."

The astonishment of Paris at the words of its Master can be readily
imagined. The streets, the cafés, the salons, were agog, for this was
the city which so recently had spawned the crimes and the obscenities of
the Terror. Its churches still carried the stains of defilement and
plunder and the great and ribald feasts which had celebrated the triumph
of Reason over Superstition were a

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

close memory even to the youngest citizens. The Voltairian tradition set
the conduct and moulded the standards of its schools, and did not the
God haters of the world regard the city by the Seine as their capital?
Now had come the shock. The Church was to return. The Mass was to go on.
And it was the command of a man who was supreme, whose will could not be
thwarted.

The new attitude was not a simple matter of faith. By now the grand
ambitions held the Corsican, and Charlemagne's majestic pattern gave the
size to his dreams. Superb strategist and soldier that he was he knew
the value of the weapons at his disposal. And that was the meaning of
the papacy to him, a weapon at his disposal, an instrument to be used
when and how he pleased. "Catholicism kept the pope in being for me," he
declared later, "and in view of my grip upon Italy, I continued to hope
that sooner or later I should be able to bend him to my will. What
immense influence I should then wield! What a means to have at my
disposal in my dealings with Europe!"

No time was to be lost. The whole affair, plan and execution, was
conducted with the usual speed of a Bonaparte campaign. The invitation
was sent to Rome, a Legate hurried back and then it was Consalvi who
came. He was ushered to the great man's presence by the limping apostate
bishop Talleyrand, and there was much rattling of drums and clanging of
arms by the Guards. Bonaparte had surrounded himself with a glittering
array of uniformed councillors and functionaries and it was thus,
already an Emperor in manner and bearing, that he received the cardinal.
This man who had intimidated all Europe had made elaborate preparations
to impress his scarlet-clad guest but as Emil Ludwig remarks of the
occasion: "The shrewdest of worldly sages can find his master in the
Vatican. When the consul wishes to browbeat him, the prince

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

of the Church smilingly stands his ground. What a spectacle for
Talleyrand, who looks on in silence!"

After the first meeting an agreement gradually took shape and the grand
attempt to achieve harmony between the Church and the Bonaparte regime
resulted in the Concordat of 1802. Concessions had to be made by the
Holy See but much was also gained. The seals were affixed and the
signatures inscribed and a great ceremony of thanksgiving was arranged
to be held in Notre Dame. The First Consul ordered his court, for it was
that already, to attend. "We are going to Mass today," he said to his
brother with a chuckle. "What will Paris say to that!"

Discord with the Holy See was not long in developing. It could not be
otherwise with such a man, who insisted on being the Dictator in all
things and who would not admit that the authority or office of any man
or institution could counter his will. There were violations of the
recent concordat and encroachments of privilege and protests. But before
the final rupture the Pope, at the earnest behest of the warrior, came
to Paris to officiate at the coronation service; for Napoleon now wished
to wear the Imperial title. In Rome there had been a spirited discussion
amongst the members of the Sacred College as to whether the invitation
should be accepted or not and when, in the interests of peace, it was
decided he should go several cardinals registered vigorous protests.

"*Tu es Petrus*" sung a large and superbly trained choir as the Pope
went to his throne in the Cathedral of Notre Dame. A splendid sight of
massed brilliance met his eye and outside the tall walls of the great
edifice a light snowfall touched the usually grimy gargoyles with a
glistening whiteness. An ocean of densely packed citizens darkened the
boulevards and impatiently fidgeted and grumbled as they waited to
glimpse Napoleon and his Josephine.

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Pope, the
Ambassadors, the high functionaries of State, they waited and fidgeted
too and it was a part of the proud Corsican's plan that they should do
so. Everything was as he wished and timed to his plan; but it had very
nearly not been so for soon after his arrival in Paris the pontiff,
rather bewildered and half convinced already that he was being duped,
had heard from Josephine herself that her marriage was invalid and that
she had not been married by a priest. Pius listened gravely and saw that
here was his chance to escape further indignity. He could not be
expected to preside at the Coronation of such a pair.

So the Pope voiced his objection and waited the fury but from that man
whose actions were so unpredictable there was merely a shrug and smile.
The matter could easily be rectified. Candles were lit in the palace
chapel. The Emperor's uncle, Cardinal Fesch, was summoned and a marriage
enacted. The Coronation itself followed an elaborate plan and one bold
piece of the glittering scheme was to startle the world. The solemn
moment had come when the Emperor was to receive the Crown but instead of
bending his knee before the Pope the audacious creature seized the
anointed circlet and turning to the congregation and standing erect
placed it firmly on his head. He had crowned himself. There was a murmur
and excitement even amongst his puppets and all eyes turned to the
Pontiff who said nothing and whose sad eyes showed no surprise. There
was no movement or protest from his throne. Silent and pale and aloof
his was the role of an onlooker of a masquerade but there came the time
when he had to give the kiss of peace. "*Vivat Imperator in Eternum*,"
he said softly as he followed the ritual and his blessing was a gesture
of compassion. In a loud voice the Emperor recited the oath of his
office, swearing to protect

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

the State and respect Religion. But there was little hope in the heart
of the Pope.

His apprehensions were soon fulfilled for next year Napoleon had a
request to make and a story to tell of his brother, Jerome, later to be
King of Westphalia, whom he had put in a ship to acquire the benefits of
discipline and to learn the art of sextant and sail. Midshipman Jerome
had crossed the seas and landing at Baltimore had immediately struck his
flag to a local Miss Patterson. There was a quick marriage, there were
hopes of a family, and when the Emperor heard of the alliance there was
anger and trouble. He had loftier plans for his kin and the bride was
not allowed to land in France. Once ashore her husband, set to
calculation by his brother's bright promises, was ungallantly content
that the separation should be permanent. The next step was to have the
Pope dissolve the union by declaring it invalid; but Pius, after a
careful scrutiny of the facts, was of the opinion that the marriage was
indisputably correct and in a polite but firm epistle so informed the
Emperor.

The breach was to widen still further when Pius refused to cooperate in
Napoleon's Continental System, which aimed to close all European ports
to English ships and trade. This was too much opposition for the despot
who had already written "Your Holiness is sovereign of Rome, but I am
its Emperor. All my enemies must be yours." In the bivouac on the
outskirts of Vienna it was decided to annex the Papal States. The maps
were consulted and the instructions given. The bugles sounded, troops
marched to a schedule arranged by undeniable genius, and on the sixth of
July, 1809, the Pope was informed by a French general that his dominion
had been taken and that he was no longer free. It was as simple as that.
Soldiers rushed him to a carriage, he was whirled

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

away from Rome and conveyed to Savona in a manner painful to his age and
health. The long way was made easier by the inhabitants of the
countryside who tendered impromptu demonstrations of respect and
devotion. But to these spontaneous displays the illustrious captive had
but one message. *Peace*. There must be no bloodshed over his fate or
person, that was his chief concern, and it was his victory.

There now commenced an ingenious campaign to bend the will of the Pope
and to win him to the wishes of the Emperor. Continually it was
emphasized that the measures taken against him had been levelled at his
status as a temporal sovereign and then only because emergency had so
demanded. Naught but reverence would ever be accorded the true Holy
Father was the Imperial promise. An annuity of two million francs was
settled upon him and a great show of respect to his rank and person was
made by all in attendance, although no deference in speech or manner
could disguise the fact that they were guards and he a prisoner. From
the waking hours until the depths of the night there was always a
persuasive voice ready to extol the Emperor's wisdom, to tell of his
incomparable martial abilities, and to dwell on the great benefits that
would gladden the world if Pope and Emperor would work together. This
kind of propaganda was ceaseless but perhaps the most dangerous aspect
of the papal captivity was his ignorance of what was happening in Rome.
He was shut off from his counsellors and from his documents and any
information that came to him was passed through the censor and flavored
by the filter of his captor's opinion. Some prelates and churchmen were
allowed to see him but they were all creatures of the Regime and to a
man they pleaded the cause and talents of their master.

Twenty-seven French bishoprics were now vacant and

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

the ecclesiastical henchmen of Napoleon strenuously endeavored to
receive from Pius his approval of the Imperial nominees and thus assure
them of canonical investiture. But the old man remained firm in his
refusal. Napoleon then convened a National Council and ordered the
attending bishops to pass a resolution which would pronounce the papal
approval unnecessary; but there were demurs and resistance to the
proposal and because of unconcealed indignation and opposition some
wearers of the mitre were arrested. It was not the way of the Emperor to
let matters rest at such a stage. The churchmen were ordered to meet
again and this time it was proposed that a metropolitan or senior bishop
of a province could bestow *in the name of the Pope* canonical
investiture after a see had been vacant for six months. The assemblage
passed the measure but only on condition that it be approved by the
Pope. Eight prelates of Napoleon's choosing waited on Pius and begged
him in the interests of the Church in France to give his endorsement.
Long and persistent persuasion had its effect this time and finally,
after making a few changes, the Pope, now a very ill man, succumbed to
the entreaties and gave his seal. But the proud and impatient nature of
the Dictator was not satisfied. The victory was neither clear cut nor
quick enough for him. And with his talent for sensing the thoughts and
sympathies of the people he was conscious of a growing distaste on all
sides at the treatment accorded the pontiff. He determined to settle the
affair himself and he ordered that the Pope be brought to Fontainbleau.

But by the time the ailing old man arrived the exigencies of war
demanded the Emperor should be with the Army. This time the march was to
Moscow and the tragedy of that vain campaign with its long and
corpse-strewn retreat was soon to startle the world. But the terrible
energies

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

of its author were not yet stemmed nor had his ambitions dwindled. A new
army must be trained. New battles must be fought. The Empire must and
should survive. And while a fresh crop of lads were hurriedly bent to
martial ways and more cannon beaten into shape the Emperor came to
Fontainbleau to achieve a victory of a different kind. A great lethargy,
the inevitable penalty of a long illness combined with the toll of age
and despair, enveloped the Pope at this time and it was with but little
interest or spirit of any kind that he received his visitor.

Napoleon made a great display of devotion and respect, talked in excited
tones of the glory of a united Christendom, swore that his sword was at
the service of the papacy. At first the old man heard these things
without emotion or understanding but gradually the more extravagant
phrases seemed to penetrate his torpor. A faint spark lit his weary eyes
when the Emperor artfully talked of peace between State and Church, a
peace that would be translated everywhere. The magnetic voice went on,
painting in pleasing words great schemes of justice and charity and
there came the time when a document appeared before the pontiff and a
pen was held to his trembling fingers. His signature was traced while
the jubilant voice of the Dictator filled the room with majestic
promises. Napoleon could well afford to rejoice for by that tremulous
scrawl Pius VII had agreed the papacy should henceforth be resident in
France and that the Papal States should remain the property of his
captors.

But it was a victory too preposterous ever to achieve the status of
fact. Many of the restrictions surrounding the person of the pontiff
were now removed and fortunately he was permitted to receive his
cardinals. They emerged from their various places of detention with
melancholy

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

faces and lost no time in telling him what he had done. A great anguish
was his reaction to their woeful recital and the pangs of this emotion
imbued him with the fire of a new spirit of opposition. Quickly the
Emperor was informed that the papal signature was withdrawn and that an
agreement made under such dubious conditions must be considered null and
void. The reply to the pronouncement was awaited with calmness but also
with apprehension. Tempestuous measures were certainly to be expected
but they were never realized, for fortune was forsaking the Corsican on
all sides now, and there were more desperate and bloodier combats to
engage his energies and presence. Calamity was clouding his every
horizon and his genius was being challenged as never before. There was
no purpose to be gained in keeping the Pope a prisoner any longer and in
fact the presence of so august a captive in his territories might make
circumstances even more adverse. Gloomily he decided to allow Pius to
return to Rome and in his letter to Prince Eugene telling him of the
decision, he pathetically clings to the pompous magnanimity and dignity
of his fast ebbing power. "I have given orders," he wrote, "that the
Pope be sent to the Austrian outposts by way of Piacenza and Parma. I
have made known to the Pope that, having asked, as Bishop of Rome, that
he return to his diocese, I have permitted him to do so. Be careful,
then not to pledge yourself to anything relative to the Pope, either as
to recognizing him or as to not recognizing him."

After nearly five years of absence the Pope entered Rome and both he and
the cardinals received a tremendous welcome. There were many things to
do and the tangled reins of government and administration had to be
gathered in order; but there could be little stability to any
enterprises of a civic or national character until it

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

was certain that the era of Napoleon had definitely ended. His
abdication had been proclaimed and he had gone to little Elba,
apparently resigned to the emptiness of the title which he had been
allowed to retain. But who could be confident that the proud and
restless spirit was really broken? There were rumors and conjectures and
within ten months the world was electrified but hardly surprised by the
news that the Emperor was making another grasp at glory. The restored
Bourbon monarch, Louis XVIII, ensconced in the Tuileries, was handed a
sealed dispatch. He read it and calmly said, "Napoleon Bonaparte has
disembarked on the coast of Provence!" His calmness was admirable but it
soon vanished along with his royal person and once again it was Napoleon
who occupied the Tuileries. A splendid and happy moment it was for the
great soldier but it was only a moment, fleeting and brief. His destiny
was not to be revealed in the halls of palaces but on the battlefield.
This time the baton pointed at Waterloo and this time he was to hear the
cry that he had boasted no man would ever hear. "*The Guard is
breaking!*" Those proud veterans did break and there was rout and
massacre and Waterloo was over. Napoleon's day was over too, utterly and
inexorably, and there remained for him only the bitter and dismal end at
St. Helena.

All Europe rejoiced and prepared for the comforts of long denied
tranquillity as an English frigate carried the forlorn and beaten
Emperor south to the lonely island. But much havoc had been done and
many boundaries had been changed and these things demanded immediate
adjustment and reparation. Could there be a complete return to the
*status quo* of yesterday? The men who were given this complicated
problem were a shrewd and brilliant company. There was Metternich of the
Austrian Empire. There was Hardenburg of Prussia. Nesselrode represented

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

the idealistic Czar of Russia, Alexander I, when that monarch did not
act for himself, and the wily Talleyrand served the new French sovereign
with the same glib fidelity he had given to Napoleon. England had the
ability of Castlereagh and the reputation of the Duke of Wellington to
serve her interest and there were men of equal wit to speak for the
smaller nations. Representing the Holy See in the long and complicated
negotiations was the long standing friend of the Pope the Cardinal
Consalvi, and all things considered, he did well. Except for Avignon
which remained under the French flag and a small strip of land retained
by Austria, the Papal States were restored to their pre-Napoleonic size.

The rapid changing of fortune had brought Pope Pius better health and an
increased vigour and well it was for there was much for him to do both
within and without his frontiers. One of his first deeds was an act of
long awaited justice. By formal announcement the Suppression of the
Society of Jesus was revoked. Separate Concordats were made with the
various nations and each of these processes demanded long discussion and
study. The national Colleges in Rome were restored and the Congregations
were set in full motion again. Institutions and laws which had been
established by the Napoleonic regime and which had proven successful
were wisely retained and with superb charity it was the Pope who gave a
gracious and dignified asylum to the mother of the Corsican and to other
members of his family. He bore no malice towards Napoleon and in fact
pleaded with the British Government that gentler treatment should be
given the famous prisoner. He bore no malice and proved his forgiveness
but he never forgot the dark days of his own captivity. When he died at
the age of eighty-four during the late summer of 1823 his last words,
ejaculated in the

accents of the final agony, were *Savona!* *Fontainbleau!* 

The great and significant changes in society which were taking shape
during the American and French Revolutions were a disturbing factor in
the thoughts of this generation. Men, whether they were aristocrat or
peasant, merchant or intellectual, when gathered for discussion were
usually sharply divided into two opinions. Either sympathy for the new
ideas as in some form or a determined rejection of liberalism under any
guise. So it was with the Cardinals when they met in the Sistine Chapel
to select a successor to Pius, and it was the conservatives who were in
the majority. After three weeks their candidate, the Cardinal Severoli,
was about to be declared pontiff, but a veto from the Austrian monarch
prevented his elevation. Acting quickly before another such missive
could be received he and his party produced the necessary ballots in
favor of Annibale della Genga, the Cardinal-Vicar of Rome, who was
genuinely horrified at the swift swing of circumstances which thrust the
honor to him. He protested his inadequacy and pleaded his ill-health
with tears but to no avail. He was made Pope and with reluctance and
apprehension he took the name of <span class="smallcaps">Leo</span> XII.

There was cause for his honestly expressed lack of confidence, for his
health was indeed bad and while he was a good man his record as prelate
and diplomat was devoid of outstanding achievement or success in any
form. He was one of those correct characters who all their lives eschew
gaiety of any kind: even in adolescence they adopt the more sombre moods
of their seniors and studiously avoid the light hearted joys, however
innocent, of their comrades. At sixty-three, his age at his election, he
seemed much more ancient, and in place of the alert and progressive
Consalvi, he installed an eighty-year-old

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

crony as the Secretary of State. The two dour and sickly old men held
conference and decided that the best way to fight the evils of
liberalism would be the imposition of austerity and severity. The most
stringent and extraordinary regulations were put into effect and spies
were set to report their observance. The sale of wine was restricted in
the Papal States and a great gloom descended upon the traditionally
festive taverns of Rome. The strictness of the Pope even disapproved of
the realism of historic works of art and much to the general
[indignation](errata.htm#9.md) he caused some of the ancient ornaments to
be removed from the public gaze and in others ordered a covering to be
put over the anatomical portions he deemed offensive. An intense
unpopularity was of course the result of such harsh tactics but Leo XII
cared little for the opinion of his subjects as long as he was convinced
duty was being followed.

Unrest and dissatisfaction became prevalent throughout his domain and
membership rapidly increased in the forbidden secret societies whose
aims were revolutionary in character even though anarchy might be the
sinister cost. He expired, this unloved Pope, in the sixth year of his
reign because of clumsy surgery and this time the liberal cardinals
succeeded in winning the tiara for their candidate, the popular
Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati, Francis-Xavier Castiglione. The new pope
had enjoyed the favor of Pius VII and in his honor he chose to be called
<span class="smallcaps">Pius</span> VIII. He was popular and with his
accession a more gentle and sensible application of the laws was
immediately perceptible, but he was also seventy years old and his
health was no better than that of his predecessor. Most of his problems
and decisions were therefore passed to the jurisdiction of his Secretary
of State. The Holy See, so desperately in need of a vigorous and
energetic leadership, had once again been failed by the cardinals.

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

The happiest news of this reign, and certainly not of the Pope's making,
was the Catholic Emancipation Act of Great Britain which brought a newer
and wider freedom in the practice of their religion to the Catholics of
that kingdom who hitherto had been harassed by unjust legal
restrictions. Less gratifying and significant of the current mood
everywhere was the report from France that once again the forces of
Revolution had triumphed in that country and although the disorder was
less bloody than before, the *legitimist* king, Charles X, was replaced
by a *constitutional* monarch, Louis Philippe. This news was
encouragement to radicals in the Papal States and through the
well-organized activities of their secret societies a violent campaign
of noisy objection and resistance to legitimate authority now began.
There were open skirmishes with the police. There were loud demands for
a united Italy and a new form of government, and of course there were
the usual cries and promises of Liberty and Equality. In 1830, Pius VIII
died. But even though the poison and violence of rebellion seethed on
their every side it took the cardinals seven weeks before they could
name a successor to Pius VIII. He was a cardinal but not yet a bishop
and he was from the ranks of the ancient congregation known as
Camaldolese monks. His name as a cardinal and a monk was Dom Mauro
Cappellari and as pontiff, <span class="smallcaps">Gregory</span> XVI.
He was sixty-three years of age and had been a successful abbot and
canonist. He had won considerable renown as a scholar and theologian but
proportionate distinction was not to be his as a pope. The situation to
greet him was alarming and the future was a promise of even worse.
Active revolution broke out as he took his throne and he was forced to
accept the help of Austria. Regiments came and steel was bared until
there was a semblance of order; but the parade of a foreign soldiery

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

within a state is no healthy antidote for trouble and faces remained
sullen and conspirators continued to meet and plot. The obnoxious
doctrines of the extremists found audiences of increased size because
there were undoubtedly some reasons for grievances amongst the people.
They were exasperated at being ruled by the priesthood in all things,
for in the papal territories few laymen held important offices or were
allowed to sit in the grand councils. Rule of the most absolute type
prevailed although almost every other nation had seen fit to make
concessions of some form to the advancing spirit, diluted and perverted
though it might be, of what was called democracy. The Pope, who once had
written a work entitled *The triumph of the Church against the Assaults
of Innovators*, and the old men around him refused to bow in any way to
the popular and prevailing trend. It was their opinion that chaos and
confusion would result in changing the methods of yesterday and modern
tendencies were regarded with horror as having been born of the violence
of the French Terror and the irreligious teachings of Voltaire.

But this was a time when the bulk of the people everywhere considered
the idea of parliaments and such bodies from the ecstatic viewpoint of
idealism. Romans of a later generation might cheer lustily at the
appearance of a Dictator but in the second quarter of the XIX Century
the same precincts had echoed just as loudly with enthusiastic shouts
for the liberal way. The Pope, while wishing to be charitable,
resolutely set his face against Liberalism with the result that revolt
flared for a second time and again the Austrians, fearful of a general
insurrection, marched to the rescue. This ready assistance alarmed the
French who suspected the Austrian garrisons might be in

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Italy for other
purposes than suppressing rebellion. So they too despatched regiments to
the papal property of Ancona and neither power withdrew until several
years later.

Prince von Metternich, the great Austrian statesman, convinced Pope
Gregory that many of his troubles could be rectified by the appointment
of a new Secretary of State and thus the stern and haughty Cardinal
Lambruschini was given the position. His remedy for social unrest was
severity and so matters grew worse instead of better in the temporal
territories of the Church. It must not be thought that the struggle for
wider political freedom was confined to laymen alone. Many a churchman
was sympathetic to the new ideas and the journal *Avenir*, edited by the
brilliant and enterprising Abbé de Lamennais, earned the particular
disapproval of the Pope because of the support it gave liberalism and in
fact it resulted in the encyclical *Mirari vos* which was a hearty
condemnation of the new trend. It would seem indeed that Gregory XVI had
little use for anything of the coming age and that his appreciation in
all things was confined to the past. Under his patronage scholarship was
given impetus in Rome but his doctors and students must survey only what
had been. He founded a rich museum which exhibited the ancient Etruscan
and Egyptian glories, but with thunder in his voice he forbade the
building of a railroad within his domain.

But while there might be trouble in Rome and discontent in Italy and
change throughout Europe the great machinery of Church organization,
lubricated by devotion and fueled by the fires of faith, continued to
function smoothly and progressively. A new hierarchy on a new continent
was being established in Australia and vicariates were springing into
existence throughout the wide areas of the South Seas. The Mass was
being sung

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

by missionaries in the distant corners of most of the dimly known
places, China, Tibet, Africa. The trudge of the persevering priest, the
glitter of his upraised chalice, was known in all these lands, and in
both South and North America the ancient faith, long established, was
flourishing with mounting energy and assured permanency.

Death came to Gregory XVI on the first day of June, 1846, and a
fortnight later the cardinals met with the knowledge that the grave
conditions of the time demanded a speedy election. And yet, to their own
surprise and not quite according to plans of the various parties, there
was a pope within the next forty-eight hours. This was because the
Austrian faction had pressed immediately and heavily for their
candidate, the stern ex-Secretary of State, Cardinal Lambruschini, and
in a quick move to thwart the unpopular design the other cardinals,
actually not yet fixed on their own choice, cast their ballots for the
cardinal Bishop of Imola not thinking that a decisive majority would be
forthcoming. But the result was a heavy majority in his favor and though
the Viennese court made haste to send a veto it was too late. By the
time it arrived the name of the new Pope, <span
class="smallcaps">Pius</span> IX, had been recorded and proclaimed.

In most ways the new pontiff differed from his predecessors. He was much
younger, being only fifty-four, and he had travelled extensively, even
to South America where he had served on the staff of the Delegate to
Chile. He had enjoyed a distinguished career as a diplomat and as an
administrative prelate and he had made no mistakes. His family was proud
of its quarterings and in his youth it was intended he should wear the
impressive uniform of the Noble Guard; but ill-health killed these hopes
and later had come a vocation and the cassock. His full name was
Giovanni-Maria Mastai-Ferretti and he was a man of

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

imposing and handsome presence who was not alarmed at the new order and
as a sovereign was willing to negotiate and indeed quite anxious to make
concessions to liberalism. Only thirty days after his installation he
was given the salutes and plaudits of a popular ruler as a series of
wise actions made for the public good will. A general amnesty was
proclaimed for all political exiles and prisoners of whom there were
about two thousand from the previous reign. It was announced that
railroads, noisy symbols of progress, would be permitted within the
papal territories and that henceforth there would be few or no
restrictions to prevent the publication of newspapers. A layman, Count
de Rossi, was made Prime Minister. Plans were put in motion to have
representative non-clerics form a Government Council and other laymen
were given posts hitherto occupied by churchmen. But while there were
easy cheers on the Roman streets for these measures they failed to win
the favor of the more dangerous and stubborn of the plotters who were
firmly resolved not to make peace with any wearer of the tiara. It was
their idea that the temporal power must be vested in secular hands, and
circumstances were so shaping that this objective seemed not
unobtainable: for revolution was flaring again in those countries which
were bound to the Papal States by geography and treaty. In Paris there
was high excitement in the streets, the bourgeois Louis Philippe hastily
abandoned his sceptre, and soon the Second Republic, from which was to
emerge the unimpressive figure of another claimant to the Imperial
title, Louis Napoleon, nephew of the great warrior, was in existence.
The contagion of change spread to Austria and the Emperor Ferdinand
raced from the throne accompanied by his minister, the haughty
Metternich. Later the young Francis Joseph was given the crown and order
was restored but

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

meanwhile there were gunfire and cries for liberty in all directions.
The Hungarians rose in revolt but lost their strength because of fierce
dissension between Magyar and Slay. The Milanese and Venetians took to
arms and were aided by the King of Sardinia who, like the rulers of
Tuscany and Naples, had been forced to grant his people a constitution
amidst tumult and clamor.

The Papal States did not remain exempt from the prevailing fever. Pius
met the mood with an offer of constitutional government but he refused
to sanction war against Austria and this refusal provided the alert
insurrectionists with a weapon to destroy his popularity. The inciters
and rumor-mongers went to work and from obscure corners the whisper of
"traitor" grew to hysterical shouts and accusations outside the
Quirinal. The Prime Minister, Count Rossi, was assassinated, the Pope's
secretary shot by his side, and in the uncertain darkness of an autumn
night Pope Pius IX was forced to flee his city. He went to Gaeta and
there was given the protection of the King of Naples whilst great
disorder and confusion prevailed in Rome. Pius appealed for assistance
to the Catholic nations and in Paris the shrewd Louis Napoleon, as yet
wearing only the title of President, reacted favorably, not so much from
motives of charity or pity, but because he saw that in occupying the
Papal States with French troops he would gain strategic advantage
against Austria. So French soldiers invaded Italy and were engaged by
the Army of Garibaldi who had some success until reinforcements arrived
from France. Rome was besieged and won and Garibaldi retreated while the
other leader of the Italian nationalists, Mazzini, fled to Switzerland.
A triumphant flourish of French trumpets declared the Roman Republic to
be at an end and the Pope was invited to return. He displayed no great
haste in doing so

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

and, disillusioned by the results of his overtures and concessions to
the liberals, he put, for the time being, the affairs of his temporal
government in the hands of three cardinals who gained notoriety as the
"Red Triumvirate." These three were of a breed and viewpoint which would
have earned the approval of the stern Leo XII. They acted swiftly and
with little mercy and soon the courts were filled and the gaols crowded.
The Pope made Cardinal Antonelli his Secretary of State and this man,
the last cardinal not to be a priest—for he was only possessed of
deacon's orders—proved as severe as his three colleagues. Indeed his
ruthlessness and domineering character quickly earned him a high
unpopularity with both clergy and laity.

The Pope turned to his ecclesiastical tasks and found much to do. The
Catholics of England, who up to this time like a missionary province
were under the care of vicars apostolic, were given back their bishops.
Westminster was created the Metropolitan See, twelve suffragan dioceses
were designated, and thus the dignity of the hierarchy, the hierarchy
which was so illustriously studded with the names of martyrs and saints
and scholars, was restored. John Patrick Wiseman was made a cardinal and
became Archbishop of Westminster. There was great rejoicing in Catholic
circles but a howl of protest and alarm was heard from that unfortunate
element of the English population which scents a sinister purpose every
time the name of their country is inscribed by the papal pen. "I agree
with you," Lord John Russell wrote from Downing Street to the Anglican
Bishop of Durham, "in considering the late aggression of the Pope upon
our Protestantism as insolent and insidious . . ." A member of the Upper
House of Parliament declared that war should be made upon the Pope and
from his pulpit an Anglican

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

clergyman stated: "I would make it a capital offence to administer the
Confession in this country. Transportation would not satisfy me. Death
alone would prevent the evil. This is my sober conviction."

Despite such sentiments a great revival of the old religion was taking
place in the island kingdom. The hierarchy was restored in 1850 and
during the year following among the large number of converts there were
no fewer than thirty-three Anglican ministers, including Edward Manning
who was to be the successor of Cardinal Wiseman. The hierarchy was also
re-established in Holland and once again to the sweet thunder of the
ancient chant an Archbishop stepped to his throne in the historic see of
Utrecht. In every direction Pius IX showed how seriously he regarded his
title as Father of the Universal Church. Great efforts were made to win
the loyalty of the Eastern schismatics and success of this kind was had
at Goa. In Jerusalem the Latin Patriarchate was re-established and the
long fidelity of the Irish was acknowledged by the bestowal of the Red
Hat upon the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Cullen, the first time that an
Irish prelate was so honored. The New World was not ignored or neglected
and in the United States alone, despite the ravages of a terrible civil
war in which brother fought against brother and religion proved no
better cement than the ties of blood, there was the erection of
forty-six new dioceses or vicariates, and a North American College was
approved for Rome. A few years later Archbishop McCloskey of New York
was raised to the scarlet and before this event full and comprehensive
concordats had been made with the Central and South American nations.
New treaties were also made with Spain and Portugal and Austria,
although there were fresh anxieties and long vexations to the Catholic
interest in Germany and Switzerland

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

and in Russian-dominated Poland which required delicate negotiation and
manipulation. All these things and many more, so different and so full
of detail and problem, received the attention and the direction of the
Pope during the thirty-two years of his pontificate, but they dwindled
to littleness in comparison with the importance of two great dogmatic
pronouncements which were made in this reign. After profound
consultation with hundreds of theologians and wise men of the Church he
provided another beacon to light the way for the faithful amidst the
storms of cynicism and rejection and doubt which were characterizing his
era. Just before the Christmas of 1854 the doctrine of the Immaculate
Conception was defined as an article of Catholic belief and in the
majestic confines of St. Peter's an audience of over two hundred bishops
and many other dignitaries heard the solemn words. "We declare,
pronounce, and define that the doctrine which holds that the most
Blessed Virgin Mary was, in the first instant of her conception, by a
singular grace and privilege of Almighty God, in virtue of the merits of
Christ Jesus, the Saviour of the human race, preserved free from all
stain of original sin, is revealed by God, and on that account is to be
firmly and constantly believed by the faithful."

Fourteen years later Pope Pius was to summon a General Council of the
Vatican, an event which demanded and received immense preparation and
care. Such a call had not been heard in the Church for three centuries
and when the Fathers, at one time to number nearly eight hundred
prelates, did assemble it was with the painful knowledge that the
temporal power of the papacy had again suffered a severe setback. After
the return of the Pope to Rome from his flight to Gaeta the security of
his State had depended upon the presence of French troops but eventually
Count

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cavour, the
Piedmontese premier, whose ambition it was to mould Italy into one
nation under a constitutional and monarchical form of government, had
struck a bargain with Napoleon III. A Franco-Italian war against Austria
followed in which the latter power was vanquished. Then the spoils were
shared and, regardless of mutual accusations of treachery amongst the
allies, Nice and Savoy went to France and four-fifths of the Papal
domains were annexed to Sardinia while the protests of the Pope were
lost in the clamor of the new Italian nationalism and patriotism. All
that remained to the pontiff now was one province and his temporal rule
of the small strip of land was only guaranteed by a French garrison
which the French Emperor had the grace to leave in Rome. Once indeed
these troops were withdrawn and immediately an army, under the command
of the audacious Garibaldi, attacked Rome. It was beaten off and the
Frenchmen, because of Catholic sympathy in France, were then returned.

On the eighth day of December, 1869, the Twentieth General Council
gathered in the Basilica of St. Peter. It was the largest-attended synod
in the history of the Church and an almost complete unanimity was to
mark its decisions although in the preliminary discussions there were
periods of hot dispute and bitter words. There were important matters of
doctrine and faith and discipline to be discussed but the main subject,
the thing that was on all lips and in all thoughts, was the proposed
definition of Papal Infallibility. Violent controversy raged both within
and without the Council over this question and the newspapers of the
world became filled with the noise of the argument. The Pope kept aloof
from the debate and so too, surprisingly enough, did most of the
national rulers who, although there was powerful influence to provoke
their intervention, preferred to follow the example of Bismarck who
wisely declared that the

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

affairs of the Council were affairs of religion alone and that there
would be no interference, diplomatic or otherwise, from him. An
aggressive leader of the non-Infallibilists was another German and one
of the Church's most learned historians, Dr. Döllinger of Munich, and
because of his fierce opinions he chose the road of schism rather than
bow to the will of the majority. It is difficult to understand his
attitude. Sincere Catholics had always accepted the dogmatic
pronouncements of a pope without question and such obedience was
acknowledgement of infallibility. But now that it was proposed to make
it a formal article of faith the very meaning of the word itself became
confused and was challenged. *Infallibility* was mistaken for
*impeccability* and it vas erroneously assumed and widely believed that
if the definition were adopted infallibility would be claimed for the
conduct and actions of the Pope at all times. Nothing could be clearer
than the graceful prose of Cardinal Manning's translation. "We teach and
define that it is a dogma divinely revealed: That the Roman Pontiff when
he speaks 'ex cathedra,' that is, when in discharge of his office of
Pastor and Doctor of all Christians, by virtue of his supreme Apostolic
authority, he defines a doctrine regarding faith or morals to be held by
the Universal Church, by the divine assistance promised to him in
blessed Peter, is possessed of that infallibility with which the divine
Redeemer willed that His Church should be endowed for defining doctrine
regarding faith or morals: and that therefore such definitions of the
Roman Pontiff are irreformable of themselves and not from the consent of
the Church."

There existed a party of prelates who while not doubting the truth of
Infallibility were of the opinion that the time was inopportune to
declare the definition and because of this fifty-five bishops remained
absent on the day of the final vote, which was July 18th, 1870. Five
hundred and

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

thirty-five of their brethren did attend and of this number five hundred
and thirty-three voted their favor and only two, Bishop Riccio of Sicily
and Bishop Fitzgerald of Little Rock in the U.S.A., gave the answer of
objection, *non-placet*. But after the doctrine of Infallibility had
been officially promulgated the two bishops along with their absent
colleagues withdrew their dissent and with admirable and prompt docility
made submission of obedience and agreement.

In all corners of the world the decision of the Council had been awaited
with eagerness but now another excitement, the explosion of cannon,
intervened to occupy the popular attention. For on the day following the
promulgation Napoleon III chose at last to challenge the growing
military strength of Germany. War was declared and the armies marched;
and finally, after the terrible meeting at Sedan, Napoleon glumly
offered his sword in the traditional gesture of defeat and surrender.
Defeat in Paris was no less a disaster in Rome for the French garrison
was hurriedly evacuated and the city became destitute of defence except
for a small corps of brave but inadequate volunteers and guards. King
Victor Emmanuel II of the new kingdom of Italy sent an envoy to Pius who
begged that the pontiff should bow to the inevitable, but he steadfastly
refused to make terms and a few months later, after but a brief display
of resistance on the part of the Papal troops, the Italian army took
possession of Rome. Much to their dismay Pius had ordered his soldiery
to put down their arms and as the invaders entered the city he addressed
some diplomats who had come to his side, anxious for his safety. He was
serenely unafraid. "I have written to the King," he told them calmly, "I
do not know whether my letter has reached him. But, whether it has or
not, I have now no hope of touching his heart, or of arresting his
ungracious proceedings . . . Bixio,

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

the notorious Bixio, is here at our doors, supported by the Italian
army. He is now a Royal General. Years ago, when he was a simple
Republican, he made promise, that should he ever get within the walls of
Rome, he would throw me in the Tiber . . . Only yesterday I received a
communication from the young gentlemen of the American College, begging,
I should say demanding, permission to arm themselves and to constitute
themselves the defenders of my person. Though there are few in Rome in
whose hands I should feel more secure than in the hands of these young
Americans, I declined their generous offer with thanks . . . I would be
glad, gentlemen, to say that I rely upon you and upon the countries you
have the honor to represent. . . But times are changed. The poor old
Pope has now no one on earth upon whom he can rely. Relief must come
from heaven."

There was a deep and solemn silence after this pathetic speech for the
diplomats knew well that the pontiff had spoken truly. No help could be
expected from the Governments they represented. As though reading their
thoughts the Pope suddenly spoke again: "Still, gentlemen, remember the
Catholic Church is immortal!"

No objection to the seizure of Rome came from any of the nations save a
solitary protest from the small and distant Republic of Ecuador. The
Italian Government, in a legislation known as the Law of Guarantees,
promised to safeguard the independence of the Holy See and to give
extra-territorial privileges to such premises as the Vatican Palace and
the Basilica and to provide an annual payment to the pontiff of three
and a quarter million lire but he ignored all such overtures and refused
to countenance or accept in any way the usurpation of his temporal
power. He retired in full dignity to the confines of the Vatican Palace
and its gardens and remained there, a voluntary prisoner, until his
death some eight years later and it was

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

an example which was followed by his successors until the signing of the
Lateran Treaty in 1929. But though Pius chose to be a prisoner he was no
hermit nor did idleness eat his time. Great numbers of pilgrims came
yearly to present their professions of respect and devotion and to his
end he was occupied with administrative duties and problems.

Further trouble came to sadden his remaining days when Germany was
disturbed by the struggle between Church and State which was known as
the *Kulturkampf* movement. Prince Bismarck was imbued with the fear
that the strength and influence of Catholicism within his country
constituted a menace to that Teutonic unity which was his dream, so a
highly organized attack to obliterate the influence of the Church was
commenced. Antagonistic Protestant officials were appointed to supervise
Catholic ecclesiastical and educational affairs. The Jesuits and then
many of the other religious Orders were expelled and laws were made to
regulate the training of the clergy and to limit the powers of the
episcopacy. Severe restrictions of different varieties but all with the
one purpose, the crushing of the Church, were imposed and enforced but
it was all in vain. Their sees and parishes might become vacant, their
bishops and priests could be slandered and sent to exile or prison, but
German Catholics remained true to pledge of baptism and faith. The
inglorious campaign of their Government was a failure and eventually
Bismarck was convinced of his mistake; but such news never came to
gladden the heart of Pius for by this time he had been carried to his
grave. And even during this last sad journey, which by request of the
Italian Government was made under cover of the night darkness, his name
and dignity were not spared insult and humiliation. Gangs of ruffians,
hired by those whose interest it was that there should be no
demonstrations of papal popularity, accompanied

the mourners and intruded upon their sorrow with jeers and threats to
hurl the corpse into the Tiber. Their ferocious promises were not
fulfilled and Pope Pius IX was honorably buried amidst the echoes of
sincere lamentations in the church of San Lorenzo, outside the Walls. He
had lived eighty-six years and his pontificate of thirty-two years was
the longest on the long roll.

One of the many burdens carried by the successor of St. Peter is the
fact that the many centuries have accumulated a legacy of significant
and traditional ceremonial which haunt every major and most of his minor
acts. Even when death approaches there are prescribed rites and, no
matter how great his agony or torture, witnesses within sight of his
deathbed; and when finally his spirit leaves his frame there is again no
escape from the rules of the tradition. That high official who is called
the Camerlengo (or Chamberlain) of the Church has to verify the death of
the Pontiff according to an historic formula, for this, in addition to
supervising the property and revenues of the Holy See and managing the
convention of a Conclave, is one of his traditional duties. He advances
to the corpse and addresses the dead man three times, calling him by his
baptismal name, and three times also he taps him gently on the forehead
with a silver hammer. Then, after the sad and solemn silence, he makes
the official announcement that the pontiff is dead. The prelate who so
officiated over the remains of Pius IX was a thin and pale faced
cardinal of aristocratic and ascetic appearance named Vincenzo
Gioacchino Pecci. The next time it would be his head that would receive
the touch of the silver hammer for a few days later a conclave of
sixty-one cardinals, after three quick sessions of voting, chose him to
be Pope.

He took the name of <span class="smallcaps">Leo</span> XIII and one of
his first gestures was a display of initiative and independence: to show

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

that he was of the same mind as his predecessor towards the Italian
Government he broke with tradition and instead of giving his first
blessing, *Urbi et Orbi*, to the City and the World, from the outside of
St. Peter's, the famous words were uttered from the inner loggia. That
friendly relations were never to be restored with the Italian Government
during his reign was not due to any stubborn hostility or sullen
resentment on the part of Leo XIII. He was not that kind of man. It is
true he adhered to the policy he had inherited, remained within the
Vatican, and at certain times forbade Catholics to participate in the
municipal and parliamentary elections; but he also let it be known that
agreement was not impossible. It was the continued anti-papal actions of
various Italian officials which prevented any formation of a reasonable
and tranquil arrangement. There were anti-clerical legislations and even
the Pope's seclusion within the Vatican was at times violated by the
noise of coarse demonstrations, celebrating the end of the temporal
power of the papacy, which were permitted and indeed encouraged by the
secular authority.

Because of his vigorous championship of the rights of the working man
Leo XIII was to be called the Socialist Pontiff in an age when the
majority of society scented anarchy in any attempt to foster social
justice. Yet he was no product of the oppressed but was from the
nobility. His father was Count Ludovico Pecci and his mother was born of
an ancient and illustrious line. From his early years the young Pecci
had seemed marked for the great things. At the age of eight along with
his elder brother, he was entrusted for education to the Jesuits, first
at Viterbo and then at the Roman College, and at both places he
displayed an astonishing aptitude for scholarship, taking honors in all
subjects. Experience in government came to him early, for after his
reception into the priesthood Rome saw fit, after

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

a brief apprenticeship, to employ him as an administrator in the
provinces. He gained both distinction and popularity in this role and
then, in his early thirties, he was made an Archbishop and despatched to
Belgium as Nuncio, a highly important diplomatic assignment, for the
King of that country, Leopold of Coburg and uncle of Queen Victoria of
England, was considered to be one of the most astute of Europe's
sovereigns. The youthful Nuncio remained in Belgium for three years and
then was called back to Italy and given the ancient See of Perugia which
he occupied with distinction and grace for the following thirty-two
years. During this period he established all manner of charitable
institutions and colleges and hospitals but he seldom ventured to Rome
for, although he possessed the favor of Pius IX, the Papal Secretary of
State, Cardinal Antonelli, held little liking for him. But after the
death of Antonelli the Pope summoned him and soon he was given the
important office of Camerlengo.

With the donning of the tiara this man, who was destitute of temporal
power, found himself involved in the great struggle with Bismarck who
already had declared he would "never follow the road to Canossa" and
that the Church in Germany would be forced to his terms. Leo inherited
the problems of the *Kulturkampf* and he dealt with them not only with
courage and principle but with a masterful and tactful diplomacy which
amounted to genius and which attracted the attention and admiration of
the chancelleries of Europe. A passive resistance on the part of the
Catholics in Germany was the answer to Bismarck's schemes and he
countered with ruthless methods. Hundreds of priests were imprisoned and
so too were the bishops and archbishops, but the principle of "Render
unto Caesar" was given a rigid obedience. The Catholics of Germany would
suffer no intrusion upon their spiritual rights but neither would they

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

offer disloyalty to the State. "We appeal to Your Majesty's magnanimity
in the hope of obtaining a restoration of peace and repose of conscience
for a great number of your subjects," wrote the Pope to Emperor Wilhelm,
"and the Catholic subjects of your Majesty will never fail to show
themselves, as the faith which they profess ordains that they should do,
with the most conscientious devotion, respectful and faithful towards
your Majesty . . ." The royal hand was guided by Prince Bismarck in
reply. "The cordial words of Your Holiness leads me to hope that you
will be disposed to put in operation the powerful influence that the
constitution of your Church gives you over its ministers, in order that
those among them who have refused to follow the example of the
population confided to their care may submit themselves to the laws of
the country which they inhabit."

Leo answered courteously but suddenly another element intervened to
change the policy of the German Government. A small anti-monarchial
party, wild and radical and atheistic, was growing within the country
and two attempts were made to assassinate the Emperor. He escaped and
his answer to congratulations upon doing so was significant. "This only
shows," he said, "how we must take care that the people shall not lose
their religious scruples." A great number of Catholic clergy were either
in exile or gaol at this time but soon Bismarck was telling Parliament:
"It is the part of a brave man to fight when the conditions demand it,
but no real statesman desires to make combat a permanent institution."
It was an admission of defeat and gradually the laws against the
Catholics were relaxed. Diplomatic relations were resumed between the
Holy See and Berlin, and the German Prince Imperial paid a cordial visit
to the Pope. Then to astonish the world came a request from the German
Government, petitioning Leo to act as arbitrator in a

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

dispute with Spain over the possession of the Caroline Islands. It was a
return to the ancient respect and a gracious and splendid acknowledgment
of papal impartiality and Leo did not fail the trust. He refused to
arbitrate but he would mediate and his scheme of settlement, an example
of justice, was accepted cheerfully and with gratitude by both States.

A crisis also confronted the Church in France where the Government was
markedly anti-clerical and where all those in opposition to the
Republic, the Monarchist and Conservative elements, persisted in
identifying their political activities with the interests of the Church.
Leo, with his splendid detachment from prejudice, perceived that such a
state of affairs was wrong. Continental Republicanism, particularly in
France, had hitherto been antagonistic to the Church: but that was in
the past and the present, and the Pope, with far seeing vision, was
thinking of the future. He summoned and conferred with his friend
Cardinal Lavigerie, and shortly afterwards this prelate, who was the
influential Archbishop of Algiers, upon welcoming a group of French
naval officers to his See, made a speech in which it was emphasized that
the Catholics of France should resign themselves to the existing
Government. His declaration excited all France and threw the
conservatives into consternation. One bishop wrote to the Papal
Secretary of State, at this time the capable Cardinal Rampolla, asking
for definition and guidance. Which form of rule did the papacy endorse?
Republic or Monarchy? The reply came quickly and to the effect that the
Church "whose mission is divine, and embraces all times and places" was
against no system of government and that the Vatican was aloof from the
struggles of dynastic and political factions. Later, in 1892, the Pope
addressed an Encyclical to the French people in which the same principle
was reiterated. "The Catholic,

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

like every other citizen, has full liberty to prefer one form of
government to another, where none of those political or social forms is
opposed by its very nature to the teachings of sound reason or maxims of
Christian doctrine." But, explained the Pope, "Governments must change.
No one can consider any form of civil government as so definite that it
must remain for ever immutable. In societies purely human, all history
shows that time works great changes in their political institutions.
These changes may modify partly or totally the form of government; these
changes often come as the result of a violent crisis to which succeeds
anarchy and the breaking up of laws. In such conditions a social
necessity is imposed on a nation. It must without delay provide for its
own security. That social necessity justifies the creation and the
existence of new governments whatever form they take, if these new
governments are necessary to public order, all public order being
impossible without some recognized form of government. . . In practice
the character of the laws depends more on the character of the men in
power, than on the mere form of that power. The laws will be good or
bad, according as the lawmakers have minds inspired by good or bad
principles, and allow themselves to be guided by political prudence, or
by partisan passion."

A representative of the *Petit Journal* of Paris was received by Leo
who, unlike many contemporary sovereigns and statesmen, well realized
the power and the wide audience accorded the Press in a modern world.
The journalist was told: "My conviction is that all French citizens
ought to re-unite on constitutional grounds. Each one, of course, can
keep his personal preferences, but when it comes to political action,
there is only the government which France has given herself. The
Republic is a form of Government as legitimate as any other. . . The
United States, in the republican

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

form of government, despite the dangers of a liberty almost boundless,
grow greater and greater every day, and the Catholic Church has
developed itself there without having any struggles to sustain against
the State . . ." With the same clarity further instruction and advice
came in a later Encyclical: "Accept the Republic, that is to say, the
power constituted and existing amongst you; respect it, and be submitted
to it, as representing the power that comes from God. All political
history furnishes, without cessation, examples of unexpected changes in
form of government. These changes are far from being always legitimate
in their origin. It would be vain to expect that it should be so.
Nevertheless, the supreme advantage of the common welfare and of public
tranquillity imposes on us the acceptance of those new governments
established *de facto* in place of former governments, which *de facto*
are no more."

Leo XIII might be a sovereign without cannon or fleets but the impact of
his influence was felt everywhere. In Africa an infamous commerce was
being renewed. The savage crack of the slave driver's whip was becoming
louder and more audacious and the pitiful processions, the
self-propelled freight, fettered and handcuffed, of the desert caravans,
were becoming longer and commoner. The misunderstanding and jealousy
which had marked the relations of the European powers in their intrusion
and exploitation of Africa's wide regions and fabulous riches had
resulted in a stimulation of the slave trade which was conducted by
Arabs but which was protected by profit-sharing scoundrels of all races
and creeds. The suspicion with which each nation regarded the activities
of a rival power on the so-called Dark Continent prevented any effective
action against the vile traffic and so it flourished without hindrance
and with increasing boldness. In Brazil slavery, although under far more
humane conditions, existed also, and to the

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

hierarchy of that country the Pope sent instructions, exhorting them to
work for *immediate* abolition rather than the gradual process of
liberation which had been suggested in other quarters. To the credit of
the Brazilians, the Pope's suggestion was adopted very quickly.
Meanwhile, acting with his friend Cardinal Lavigerie, Leo embarked upon
a campaign to break the abominable power of the Arab traders. "Since
Africa," he said, "is the principal theatre of this traffic . . . we
recommend to all missionaries . . . to consecrate their strength, and
even their lives, to that sublime work of redemption. We recommend them
also to ransom as many slaves as it may be possible for them to do. . ."
A gift of 300,000 francs accompanied these words while Cardinal
Lavigerie preached a crusade throughout all Europe and the nations
bestirred themselves to a Conference on the subject. In England, which
had produced such champions of human liberty as Wilberforce and
Clarkson, a great movement was already under way and publicly the Pope
complimented the country "which had so well and for so long a time
proved her interest in the cause of negroes." The slave traffic was
gradually abolished but the lot of the negroes was to remain hard and
unjust in many countries. With the vision that he exhibited in all
matters, Leo foresaw and deplored such conditions and in an attempt to
change them he stressed the age old fact that color and racial
prejudices were no part of Catholic dogma and he urged that vocations
should be encouraged amongst the liberated slaves and their sons and
that they should be given every facility to train for the priesthood.

As the years of his pontificate mounted the justice and philanthropy of
Leo XIII was universally acknowledged and the result was an enormous
popularity. Many of the old prejudices and antagonisms, hitherto
existing in the Protestant countries, were lessened. In him the Uniate
Catholics

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

of the East found an intelligent and zealous patron and as a consequence
there was a great revival of religion and scholarship in their ranks.
The non-Catholics of the East were impressed by a spirit of cooperation
and understanding which was neither clumsy nor presumptuous and which
did much to efface long-standing feuds and enmities. During his reign
two hundred and forty-eight episcopal or metropolitan sees and
forty-eight vicariates were established and a new respect was given the
Nuncios and Apostolic Delegates whom he sent to the capitals of the
world. In England the stream of conversions which had begun in the
previous reign continued and High Church circles, in which the first
Viscount Halifax was a predominant figure, were stirred by hopes and
agitation for a return to Rome. Leo acknowledged and encouraged such
aims by a special letter, *Ad Anglos*, in which he stated: "The time
cannot be far distant when We must appear to render an account of Our
stewardship to the Prince of Pastors, and how happy, how blessed should
We be if We could bring to Him some fruit, some realization of these,
Our wishes. . . Difficulties there may be for us all to face, but these
are not of a nature which should delay. . . No doubt the many changes
that have come about, and time itself, have caused the existing
divisions to take deeper root. But is that a reason to give up all hope
of remedy, reconciliation, and peace?" The appeal caused no anger in
England even amongst those who were always on guard against the devices
of "Papistry," for it was patently no haughty summons or subtle
enticement but merely a sincere and gently worded prayer. But despite
such a tolerant reception and despite the strong yearnings of the High
Churchmen the time had not yet arrived for the Return and this was made
plain by the Archbishop of Canterbury who in a letter to his clergy
displayed no resentment

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

but nevertheless was firmly of the opinion that as yet there was no
chance of a practical agreement.

Strong differences existed within the Church of England regarding ritual
and rite. In some parishes the, sight of candlesticks on an altar was
sufficient to incite irate cries of "Popery" but other churches were
ornamented with the Stations of the Cross, and in such premises the
Confessional functioned and a fully vested clergy, to the swing of
thurible and drift of incense, followed the forms of the old practice.
Amongst Anglicans of this liking there were often qualms, invoked by the
memory of Cranmer and Cromwell, as to the sacramental powers of their
clergy. Cleavage with the Holy See does not necessarily mean invalidity
of clerical orders and Rome acknowledges that the Apostolic succession
is carried on by the schismatic Churches of the East. Leo XIII appointed
a commission to examine the complicated and delicate question as to
whether the succession was possessed by the Church of England. After a
dispassionate and thorough scrutiny the commission gave judgment that
the sacred continuity had been broken during the reign of Queen
Elizabeth. The adverse decision, even if not accepted by many whom it
concerned, was received peacefully enough in England and so too was the
establishment of hierarchies in Scotland and Wales. A few years earlier
the latter procedure in England had been greeted by excessive alarm and
storm but now, thanks to the charm and graceful diplomacy of Leo XIII,
there was but little objection and between Queen Victoria, who was
supposed to have shown great anger when Pius IX named an Archbishop of
Westminster, and the Pope there were nought but messages of esteem and
good wishes.

This amity was regarded with little enthusiasm in unhappy Ireland where
a long suffering tenantry was showing signs of organized revolt against
an intolerable system

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

which amongst other evils permitted absentee and uncaring landlords to
put their affairs in the hands of agents whose methods were often
terribly brutal and notoriously unscrupulous. An organization known as
the Land League was formed to combat unjust conditions. Its leaders were
promptly gaoled by the English but to the amazement and indignation of
Irish Nationalism the Land League Plan of campaign was also condemned by
the Vatican as being illegal opposition to constituted authority and
thus contrary to the principles of social law. To many it seemed as
though the influence of Whitehall had formed the opinions of the Pope's
advisers and for a time there was excitement and extravagant talk among
a minority of rebellious spirits. But the cloud passed by. Dr. Walsh, a
cleric noted for his courageous efforts to secure justice for the Irish
peasant, was appointed Archbishop of Dublin, and the papal blessing went
to gladden the nuptials of a Land League leader who had suffered
imprisonment. These, and many similar acts, soon convinced the most
ardent of Irish Nationalists that the Vatican had not fallen victim to
English guile. The strength of Irish Catholicism was proven again, and
the sturdy faith that had endured for nigh on fifteen centuries, the
faith that was the pride and glory of a race, flowed on with unabated
strength and undimmed lustre.

Leo XIII was keenly aware of the rapid growth of Catholicism in the
United States and his interest and observance of the affairs of the
Republic was unflagging and thorough. Upon despatching the young
ex-Rector of the American College, Bishop, later to be Cardinal,
O'Connell, to his new See he advised him that: "There is no room today
in the bishop's chair for a mere mystic. The bishop of today, in America
in particular, must be a man of high and keen intellectual vision,
thoroughly in touch with conditions that affect the public and spiritual
welfare of his

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

diocese and his nation. . . He must be a man of action. That is his
particular duty as a bishop . . ." When it was proposed to Leo that a
Catholic University be founded in Washington his approval came quickly
for, in addition to his other talents, he was a scholar and a patron of
scholars. Indeed his enthusiasm and direction brought revival of
Scholasticism and in a special Bull he urged that the philosophy of St.
Thomas Aquinas be stressed in the schools. With his consent for the
erection of the institution in Washington went the wise admonition that
it should be: "directed by American intelligence, and if, for the
moment, you have to ask for your faculties the help of foreign
professors, it must be done with the intention of developing the
national talent, and training professors capable of forming, by degrees,
native faculties worthy of the name that is borne by your university."
Between the hierarchy of the United States and the Pope there always
existed an extraordinary sympathy and understanding, and the dangers
that so easily could have been products of the phenomenally rapid spread
of the Church in the wide expanses of the young Republic never
materialized. Once indeed, a French author in writing of the activities
of the zealous founder of the Paulist Order, Father Hecker, penned a
picture in which Rome detected a theological concept which could be
construed as error and innovation. A letter went to the American
episcopate and promptly there was returned a model reply of filial
agreement and assurance. Orthodoxy was in no danger in the United
States. The Pope had bestowed the red hat upon the popular and
distinguished Archbishop of Baltimore, Cardinal Gibbons, and this
prelate was given earnest attention when he vigorously upheld the rights
of the "Knights of Labour" which was in reality a trades union and not,
as its high flown title had led some churchmen of lesser perception

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

to believe, a secret society of the continental type, dominated by
anarchistic aims.

Of all the triumphs, and there were many, which gave fame to the memory
of Leo XIII, the greatest was achieved in the field of sociology. For he
was, in advance of his generation, acutely aware of the hardships and
injustices inflicted upon the working man by the capitalistic system.
Always a protector of human dignity he deplored the humiliating serfdom
which had grown with the industrial age, the base system in which labor
was just a commodity to be bought cheaply, used and abused until
exhaustion, and then discarded abruptly, the ignoble system in which the
employer was all powerful and his laborer without voice or right. It is
the passing of time which either dissipates or endorses a claim to
greatness and as the years go by it is significant that the
pronouncements of Leo XIII on social justice loom with increasing
importance. Not only did he lament and protest against the condition of
his day, but he foresaw the dangers that such evils were forming for the
future. In his famous encyclical, Rerum Novarum, *On the condition of
the Working Classes*, he offered a plan which while it received
attention and applause was not given practical support. The established
system was too firmly established for an immediate change. Trial of the
proposed plan meant smaller profits, the risk of being overwhelmed by
competitors. It was all very well for the Pope to be idealistic and talk
of justice but in the world of cold fact who wished to think of future
and problematical troubles at the cost of smaller dividends? So reasoned
those who had it within their power to give trial to the papal ideas.

Leo XIII was considered to be an old man when he was elected for he
could already count sixty-eight years to his life, but he ruled until he
was ninety-four and to the end he was active in thought and constant in
achievement. His

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

encyclicals and pronouncements form the lengthiest series in the long
story of the papacy and always they were clear and easily understood by
the humblest of his flock. Typical of the force and simplicity of his
prose is his explanation of the Church's objection to divorce: "Because
of divorce, the nuptial contract becomes subject to fickle whim;
affection is weakened; pernicious incentives are given to conjugal
infidelity; the care and education of offspring are harmed; easy
opportunity is afforded for the breaking up of homes; the seeds of
discord are sown among families; the dignity of woman is lessened and
brought down and she runs the risk of being deserted after she has
served her husband as an instrument of pleasure. And since it is true
that for the ruination of the family and the undermining of the State
nothing is so powerful as the corruption of morals, it is easy to see
that divorce is of the greatest harm to the prosperity of families and
of State."

He wrote continuously and even when the final weakness came he called
for pen and paper and composed a Latin sonnet on the death that was
surely approaching. His illness lasted two weeks and then, on July 30th,
1903, after receiving the Sacraments he died with serenity. As he
expired there arose a spontaneous chorus of mourning and tribute from a
world which already was aware of the prestige and lustre he had brought
to his office.
