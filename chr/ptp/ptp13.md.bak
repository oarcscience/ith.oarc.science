### Thirteenth Century

The new pope was <span class="smallcaps">Innocent</span> III, who had
been Cardinal Lothair Conti, a nephew of Clement III. He was but
thirty-six and had written a book On the Contempt of the World. He was
vigorous and able, good and clever, a right man at a most critical
period for the coming of the XIIIth century was a time when the feudal
structure, so indispensable, apparently, to the framework of the Church,
was weakening before the formations of nationalism. The temporal power
of the papacy was negligible and there was a growing disrespect for its
spiritual mission. The writings of Aristotle had been rediscovered and,
with all the errors accumulated by centuries of Persian, Armenian, and
Arabian translators as yet unpurged, were being avidly studied, though
not quite understood, by scholars throughout Europe. St. Thomas Aquinas,
the great interpreter of Plato's student, had not yet appeared and error
and doubt were in profusion. Men were seeking logic and reason in all
things, groping even at the stars to find by astronomy an astrological
rule for life. With the learned engaged in such practices it was small
wonder that necromancy

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

flourished and charlatans abounded. There were the grave errors of
fanatics, too. Preaching a religious revolt and wandering from town to
town were bands of misguided zealots who, shocked by the state of the
world and in particular by the loose living of certain rich prelates,
refused to believe that sacramental powers could be invested in unfit
hands.

The horizon was not entirely dark. There was now no all-powerful
Barbarossa seeking to dominate the papacy and in fact the son of Henry,
Frederick, was committed by the widow Constance to the guardianship of
the pontiff. Perhaps it was but the obvious anxious gesture of a worried
mother to ensure a consecrated crown for her son but it was an act that
also made Innocent, as regent, the ruler of Sicily. It was a gift, an
opportunity, which was not dissipated. As suzerain of Sicily he was able
by treaty and by alliance to ensure the independence of the Papal States
and thus to remove the menace of German domination. He soon became the
real ruler of Italy and his influence came to be felt at every court in
Europe. There was disagreement in Germany between the electoral princes
as to who should take the Imperial mantle, Otto of Brunswick or Duke
Philip of Swabia. The Pope unhesitatingly declared in favor of Otto and
named him Emperor whereupon the princes complained that the pontiff was
interfering with their electoral privileges. His answer was that while
it was true theirs was the right to elect a king it was his duty, as
Pope, to judge upon the fitness of any candidate to the title of Emperor
of the Holy Roman Empire. "Princely power," he said, "is exercised over
earthly things, priestly power over heavenly things. One rules the body,
the other governs the soul. Hence, the priesthood is as much superior to
royalty as the soul is to the body."

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

Eventually Otto received his crown in Rome and soon after, with base
ingratitude, violated his oath and attempted to follow the anti-papal
policies of the previous Emperors. He was promptly excommunicated by
Innocent and deposed by the German Princes. Innocent followed the same
lofty program as Gregory VII. He demanded and received universal
allegiance, the papal dignity grew and no monarch could escape, if the
occasion demanded, from the sting of his ire or the lash of his
chastisement. The scandals of princes were no longer protected by the
complacency of private chaplains, for few courts were exempt from the
cold scrutiny of this strong Pope. The kingdoms of Philip Augustus of
France and Alphonse IV of Leon were placed under the dreaded penalty of
interdict until their rulers conformed with the marriage laws of the
Church. To the adulterous French king he wrote: "The Holy See cannot
leave persecuted women without defence; the dignity of a king does not
dispense you from your duties as a Christian." He curbed the invalid
venturings of the English King John when that notorious ruler schemed
against the appointment of Cardinal Langton to the See of Canterbury.
His judgment as arbitrator was accepted in the selection of the rulers
of Hungary, Poland, and Norway. He united the Kings of Castile, Aragon,
and Navarre in a crusade which led to the defeat of the Moors in Spain;
but unfortunately another crusade, the Fourth Crusade to the Holy Land,
which he sponsored in 1202, did not have the same success. The
expedition set out with the same laudable objective which inspired all
such campaigns but because of the usual bad leadership plus the
connivings of the wily Venetians, who had other purposes than the
liberation of the Holy Places, the cavalcade was diverted to
Constantinople instead of the Saracen strongholds. The Christianity of
the City did not

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

save it from the greed and cruelty that was now unleashed. The Byzantine
Emperor was murdered, the Patriarch evicted, altars profaned and
churches looted! "The Latins," Innocent wrote angrily to one of his
Cardinals, "have given an example only of perversity and works of
darkness. No wonder the Greeks regard them as dogs. These soldiers of
Christ are drenched in blood."

Violence might be deplored but it was the habit of the time. That is the
only excuse that can be advanced for the great massacres which in the
name of the true religion took place in the south of France where large
sections of the population were falling under the influence of
Albigensianism, a heretical doctrine which taught amongst other errors
that there could be no resurrection of the body and that the sacraments,
including that of marriage, were sinful. More Christian methods to
combat such evils were utilized by the good friar St. Dominic, founder
of the great Order which carries his name. Another similarly minded
saint of this period, whose simple but burning piety and great goodness
resulted in the founding of an Order, is St. Francis of Assisi. Once
again holy men, pledged to the service of God in its most austere form,
were on the march, begging from the rich and giving to the poor, nursing
the sick and chiding the wicked, fearlessly preaching against the
vicious profligacies and gross laxities of those in high places. In
1215, one year before he died, Innocent assembled the Fourth Oecumenical
Council of the Lateran. For eighteen months he had prepared the event
and an immense gathering of prelates justified his hopes. Seventy-one
patriarchs and archbishops, four hundred and twelve bishops, and nine
hundred abbots and priors came to Rome and from their discussions
seventy canons were promulgated. Here was pronounced that famous law
which imposed upon all Catholics the obligation

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

of annual confession and communion and here was given the doctrinal
definition of transubstantiation.

Innocent's successor, <span class="smallcaps">Honorius</span> III, was
elected by "compromise." Two cardinals, with the consent of their
colleagues, made the decision at Perugia just two days after the death
of Innocent and their choice rested upon the cardinal-priest of SS John
and Paul, Cencio Savelli. He was an old man, well over eighty, and to be
his opponent in the apparently endless struggle that surrounded the
temporal claims of the papacy was a prince just emerging from
adolescence, Frederick II. With the acquisition of maturity the
erstwhile papal ward was developing the traits so tenacious to the
Barbarossa blood, the same driving impulses which had governed his
father and grandfather. He was a handsome youth, tall, blue-eyed,
well-formed and possessed of a rare intelligence. Unfortunately,
however, the ceaseless flattering attendant to his station and an
abundance of evil influences had perverted his natural faculties and had
resulted in a spirit of cynicism and scepticism which were reflected in
his every act. He lived more like an Eastern potentate than a Christian
king and his court became a scene of Arabic splendor and luxury
including the maintenance of a large harem. "One day," says the
historian Bonnefon, "he had a man thrust into a barrel which was then
hermetically sealed, in order to prove that when the victim should at
length be suffocated and the lid removed, no such thing as a soul would
wing its way to heaven."

Honorius, continuing then along the same path as Innocent, put the seal
of his approval upon St. Dominic's Friars Preacher and a few years later
bestowed the same favor upon the Friars Minor of St. Francis. In
Palestine the rule of the Carmelite Friars also received papal
confirmation and in that same country, with hopes no less

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

than those of his predecessor, the Pope yearned to set free the Holy
Places. He preached a crusade but his words seemed only to breed a base
deception on the part of Frederick for, realizing that with the Pope's
support his plans to dominate all Italy would be the easier, the
perfidious prince promised solemnly that if he were consecrated Emperor
he would form and lead a crusade. The Pope accepted the bargain and in
1220 put the diadem upon the royal head. The following year was supposed
to witness the despatch of the promised expedition against the Saracen
but neither that year nor any other before his death, in 1227, was
Honorius to have his wishes fulfilled.

The next pope was, at his election, almost as old as Honorius had been
but he was far more vigorous and displayed rapidity in decision and
action. He was Cardinal Ugolino Conti, a kinsman of Innocent III, and a
staunch friend to the newly formed Franciscans. With the tiara he became
<span class="smallcaps">Gregory</span> IX and one of his first acts was
to excommunicate Frederick. It could not have been otherwise for typical
of the Emperor's temper was his statement: "That the world has been
deceived by three impostors: Jesus Christ, Moses and Mahomet; that two
of these died in honor; the third, Jesus Christ, was hanged on a tree;
that those are fools who aver that God, the omnipotent
[Creator](errata.htm#6.md) of the world, was born of a virgin; and that man
ought to believe nothing but what he can understand and prove by
reason!"

Yet, blasphemer though he was, the sceptical prince gained success where
a nobler knighthood failed. He did not lead a crusade but nevertheless
he made peace with the Saracens and added King of Jerusalem to his
title. Not by force of arms but because of his adept diplomacy a treaty
with the Sultan of Egypt was made and the Holy Places were once again
opened to the devout. Mahommedans

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

living in the vicinity were to remain subjects of their Sultan and
allowed free practice of their own religion. After this feat and laden
with easy promises Frederick, seeking to dominate by wile, negotiated an
uneasy peace with Pope Gregory. It did not endure. It could not for,
like the policy of his forbears, his unwavering design was to suppress
the power of the papacy. His easy promises were soon broken and he
embarked upon a savage and clever campaign to divorce the allegiance of
Christian princes from the pope. While his couriers intrigued in near
and distant courts other agents proclaimed that the Church should be
reformed and returned to primitive austerity. In Rome, always so fertile
in plots, he fomented trouble amongst the factions and throughout Italy
any noble intrepid enough to support the pontiff became a target for his
anger. He declared no pope had the power to excommunicate him and in
1240 when the alarmed Gregory sought to convene a General Council of the
Church the Imperial troops intercepted over a hundred English and French
prelates and held them prisoner. This was an outrage that the King of
France, regardless of a treaty with Frederick, could not ignore and
because of his strong representations the churchmen were released.

Gregory died soon after this incident. Like many of his predecessors he
had not neglected, despite struggles with rulers, the ecclesiastical
province of his stewardship. He sought to heighten the standard of
learning amongst the clergy and in his time authoritative decisions were
made on questions of discipline. The years between 1225 and 1240 saw the
establishment of the Inquisition and the association with that
institution of the Dominicans.

A sinister reputation has grown to surround their efforts and
particularly in Spain (some two or three centuries later) were there to
be dark tales of cruelty and torture;

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

but in Spain the civil power intruded strongly upon Church
administration. As to this first institution by Gregory IX, it is to be
noted that the Emperor Frederick II had already made heresy punishable
by burning. Why did so irreligious a man as Frederick II decree that
heretics should die by fire? Not in the interests of religion certainly.
The answer seems to lie in the special nature of the heretics against
which Emperor and Pope alike were striving. We have already seen some of
the doctrines of the Albigensians (or Catharists). Their teachings,
especially on the sinfulness of procreation, were liable to destroy the
social order and it was in the defense of the social order that
Frederick moved against them. It is possible, though not certain, that
the Pope established the Inquisition as a check to Frederick and an
assertion of the Church's right to decide who was or was not a heretic.
What is quite certain is that both rulers and populace acted against the
Catharists before the Church herself. As to the Church courts thus set
up, there were, of course, abuses, but has there ever been any
organization devised by man which has not seen error? The Inquisition
was actually a system of ecclesiastical courts inaugurated to detect
heresy. Once detected, and persisting in his error, a heretic was
delivered to the civil courts for punishment. Heresy was regarded in the
same manner as high treason might be regarded in modern times and in
those days torture and death were sentences common to many crimes.
Leniency in criminal codes is of very modern origin. The days of Botany
Bay are not far distant. The gallows and the gibbet had heavy trade and
for slight cause in the England of a century and a half ago.

The Cardinals had difficulties in the selection of a new pope. They were
twelve in number. Two were prisoners of Frederick and the other ten made
their decisions under

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

the "protection" of the Orsini family. Two months elapsed before a
choice was announced. It was the Cardinal Godfrey Castiglione, an aged
Cistercian monk, and he chose to be called <span
class="smallcaps">Celestine</span> IV; but before he could be enthroned
he died. Two years passed before his successor was named for there was
deadlock and coercion, confusion and intrigue. Most of the Cardinals, in
order to preserve some degree of independence, had retreated to Anagni.
There they refused to make a decision until Frederick released those
Cardinals whom he held captive and ordered his troops from the Roman
vicinity. Finally, because of the efforts of King Louis of France,
Frederick agreed to their terms and soon after, on June 25, 1243,
Cardinal Sinibaldo Freschi was elected and named <span
class="smallcaps">Innocent</span> IV. He was a Genoese nobleman and had
been a friend of the Emperor which was perhaps a factor to influence the
Cardinals, so weary of the seemingly perpetual struggle, in making their
choice. If so, they were doomed to disappointment. "My friendship with a
cardinal is possible," the Emperor is reputed to have said, "with a
pope, never." It is understandable why the two should have been friends.
The new pope was no gentle cleric with a yielding nature. He was as
ruthless, when occasion demanded, as his new adversary and as harsh in
his terms. Negotiations were begun between the two soon after the papal
election. Frederick was quick to make his usual promises, with a great
display of obeisance and deference but at the same time moving his
troops in such a manner as to make the Pope his prisoner. Innocent was
too alert for the manoeuvres to succeed. Dressed as a knight he escaped
from Rome to Genoa where after a favorable reception from the people of
that port he embarked for France.

These were strange times, patterned violently with tragedy and crime but
with saintliness too, for it was the

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

age that produced St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Dominic, St. Francis and the
rest of a great company, this age that saw the most depraved of
criminals, often as not wearing a mitre or crown, exercising their
villainies in all directions. Anarchy was collapsing the Empire and was
threatening the Church. Heresies in every land were rampant and the Pope
was forced from his own city. Genghis Khan was on the march and his
Mongols having conquered most of Asia, had driven deep into Europe. Rich
abbots defied richer bishops while barefooted monks preached and prayed
and fasted and gave hospitality to all who came to their doors. It was a
miserable era in many ways yet not without glory. High chivalry, founded
on Christian ideals, was practiced even though the most abominable
cruelties were countenanced. These were the days indeed when the Vicar
of Christ and the inheritors of Charlemagne's crown sorely needed each
other's support but they were antagonists and fought and conspired while
the entire fabric of Europe was rent with strife.

At Lyons Innocent convened a General Council where not only was
excommunication levelled against the Emperor but with solemn ceremonial
a sentence of deposition was pronounced. At this gathering a new
Crusade, the Sixth, was also called, for Frederick's insecure treaty
with the Sultan of Egypt had been broken and Jerusalem was once again
held by the Mahommedans. The only monarch to heed the call was the good
French king, Louis IX. He departed for the Holy Land during the summer
of 1248 but the campaign, lasting six years, was doomed to failure and
Louis suffered the shame not only of defeat but of capture. Eventually,
he was released at the cost of a huge ransom. Meanwhile, without his
active assistance, Innocent, although secure at Lyons, was forced to
employ every resource in order to obtain finances for his fight against

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

the Emperor. Special tithes were levied and loud were the protests
against them. In England the Bishop of Lincoln wrote a burning letter on
the subject; for English bishops were being forced to pay as much as
£40,000 upon succeeding to their Sees.

As has been seen death to either a Pope or an Emperor sometimes brought
a shifting of sorts in the long drama of their relationship, if not a
complete end to the bitter struggle. The time came for Frederick to die
and he succumbed to fever at Fiorento just before the Christmas of 1250.
He who had been so avowedly sceptical turned to his religion eagerly
when the end came, making his final confession and receiving absolution
through the ministrations of the Archbishop of Palermo. He begged that
his son Conrad IV should succeed him with papal approval; but the Pope
who had pronounced a sentence of deposition against him refused now to
recognize his son as rightful heir to the diadem and gave his
recognition and support to the claims of Count William of Holland. At
the same time Innocent proposed that Charles of Anjou, brother of his
benefactor, King Louis, should occupy the kingdom of Sicily. If this
plan succeeded the Papal States would no longer be faced with the danger
of a united power surrounding them.

But Charles of Anjou refused as did the brother of Henry III of England,
and in a somewhat desperate move Innocent then offered the bait to
Conrad's brother, Manfred, an illegitimate son of Frederick who was of a
nature not content to accept the limitations of his birth. The high
drama took another turn with the death of Conrad who left as heir his
infant son, Conradin, and who on his deathbed made a bold diplomatic
gesture in naming Innocent, [rejecter](errata.htm#7.md) of his claims, as
guardian of his son. Out of the tangle wrought by this latest
circumstance loomed one

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

clear fact. Innocent, without any princes’ support, was suddenly, as
Regent, the temporal lord of Sicily as well as the Papal States. It was
a situation not accepted gracefully by his erstwhile candidate, Manfred.
A quarrel was born and Manfred turned to those Saracens who had been his
father's friends. His appeals were not rejected and an able army was
soon pledged to his cause. It was an army which roundly defeated the
papal troops and before the resourceful Innocent, who would never accept
defeat, could turn the tide of fortune, death suddenly came to him at
Naples on the 7th December, 1254. Charges of nepotism, cruelty,
treachery, and unscrupulousness have been levelled against his memory.
Nevertheless, his record as a pope must be recognized as that of an able
and determined administrator. Occupied though he was with his wars
against temporal encroachments his vigor was also reflected in
missionary fields. In his time, as one of his biographers writes: "The
Holy See had survived one of the most terrible crises it had ever faced,
thanks to the sangfroid, the decision and incomparable tenacity of this
great pope." In an age when papal authority was being questioned in
every quarter he brought it strength by his clear definition of canon
law, his courageous decisions, and his indomitable will to enforce those
decisions.

The lot of the papacy was not so fortunate under the uncertain guidance
of his successor who also was his kinsman, Cardinal Rinaldo Conti, <span
class="smallcaps">Alexander</span> IV. The election was held at Naples
and controlled by the Conti family yet the new pope was no evil
conspirator nor is there evidence to believe he had other than distaste
for his new role. He had been a good cleric, a friend of the
Franciscans, and able enough in the rule of a diocese. But it was not
enough, for with all Christendom suddenly made his responsibility, his
energies, his initiative seemed to

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

disappear. In a vain effort to follow the policies of Innocent he hawked
the Sicilian crown to the English Edmund of Lancaster. The price was to
be the assumption of the debts of the Papal States and an army was to be
provided to carry on the fight against Manfred, who was gaining victory
after victory. The bargain was made but the months, even years, passed
and no help came from England for in truth that island kingdom was too
occupied with internal affairs to permit of adventurings in distant
lands. And England's king had been the only ruler even to listen
sympathetically to the Pope's plight. All others were too busy with
their own miserable quarrels. In vain Pope Alexander pleaded and begged
and threatened while Manfred possessed all Italy, crowning himself, in
1258, King of Sicily and Palermo and laughing, as had his father, at the
anathema that came from the despairing Pope. Even the satisfaction of
voicing the sentence from Rome was denied the unhappy Alexander for
there, without a strong hand to control them, the factions were at war
again and the pontiff had been forced to flee to Viterbo where he died
on May 25, 1261.

There were only eight cardinals to decide as to who should be the next
pope yet it took them three months before a decision was made and it is
probable the time would have been even longer had not the Patriarch of
Jerusalem come to Viterbo, the scene of the conclave. His manifest
ability was a solution to the deadlock and so Jacques Pantaleon, son of
a French cobbler, became Pope <span class="smallcaps">Urban</span> IV.
To erase that condition which had, in a manner, been responsible for his
own election he promptly named fourteen new cardinals. Most of them were
French and thus sown were those seeds of discord which were to cause so
much trouble in the future. Urban was never to occupy Rome but,
resembling Innocent IV in his determination,

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

he established a court at Orvieto and from there behind the remnants of
a defeated army he directed steady opposition to Manfred. With England
still unable to help, the Sicilian crown was once again offered to
Charles of Anjou. Manfred countered by having himself elected Patrician
of Rome but other factions in that unruly city had paid the same honor,
so dubious now, to the French prince. The resultant confusion and
violence made even the papal retreat at Orvieto insecure and Urban went
to Perugia. Again it must be emphasized that even in the midst of
personal dangers and struggles a pope did not neglect that large
province which was his ecclesiastical interest. His envoys were not only
busy at the courts of Christendom but also in the abbeys and in the
palaces of distant prelates. A truce, after much negotiation, was made
with Michael Palaeologus, the Byzantine Emperor who had driven the Latin
dynasty from Constantinople and in the year the Pope died, 1264, he
instituted, for the whole Church, the feast of Corpus Christi.

Four months passed before the cardinals could agree and again it was a
Frenchman who won their choice. He was Guy de Gros, <span
class="smallcaps">Clement</span> IV, a cardinal of noble birth who at
the time of his election could count but ten years as a cleric. He had
been a married layman, a father of two daughters, and had sought the
ecclesiastical life only after the death of his wife. Despite the fact
of parenthood and in an age when nepotism was the rule rather than the
exception Clement never, either before or after his acceptance of the
tiara, allowed his family to sway favor or judgment in the execution of
his office. He was not unequipped for the great position and, brief
though his career as a churchman had been, it shone with achievement. He
had been the Archbishop of the great See of Narbonne and had acted as
the papal legate to England.

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When a layman he
had been an adviser to the French King but neither the wisdom
accumulated by his long experience as an accomplished administrator nor
the stern piety that was his sincere vocation was able to bring success
or harmony to his pontificate. He dreamed of inaugurating a Crusade and
negotiated with the kings of England and France for this purpose but his
end was to come before they were brought to action. No aid could be
expected from Germany for that region was chaotic with a general and
seemingly endless anarchy. War still despoiled Italy with Charles of
Anjou gradually emerging as the victor and revealing himself to be a
tyrant of no mean scope with each new success. At the battle of
Benevento, February, 1266, he defeated and killed his rival Manfred and
furthered his triumphs by crushing a revolt which was led by the young
Conradin. The Pope had recognized Charles as King of Sicily and as
Senator of Rome but his support seems to have borne little influence
when against his wishes and spirited objections Conradin, not yet
seventeen years old, who had been taken prisoner, was put to death. The
Pope lamented the evil deed but it was done; and so perished the
grandson of Frederick II, the last of the Hohenstaufen, the bewildered
scion of a haughty dynasty which had thought an Empire its property for
evermore, the final heir of that proud House which had promised to
subjugate the papacy but which was to achieve naught save quick
extinction, stained by murder.

Clement never occupied Rome and for the most part his three years as
pope were spent at Perugia although at the time of his death, on the
29th November, 1268, he was in residence at Viterbo. There were only
fifteen cardinals to select his successor but not for three years was
one chosen. This interregnum, one of the longest vacancies

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

recorded in the story of the Roman See, was due to the intense rivalry
between the French and Italian cardinals. It was finally agreed that the
selection should be made by "compromise" and so, as in the case of
Honorius III, a small number of cardinals was entrusted with the
decisive powers. Their favor, guided, it is said, by the influence of
the great Franciscan cardinal, St. Bonaventure, fell to the archdeacon
of Liege, Theobald Visconti who was at this time in Palestine, serving
as Papal legate with the Crusaders. On receiving the news Visconti
hurriedly received the orders of priesthood which he had not previously
held and journeyed on to Viterbo and then to Rome. There he was
consecrated on the 27th March, 1272, and there he was proclaimed Pope
<span class="smallcaps">Gregory</span> X. The task he set himself was
herculean for he proposed to resuscitate the Empire, to bring the
Byzantines back to the papal fold, to free Palestine, and to pacify
Rome. Four days after his installation he gave notice that in two years'
time a general council of the Church would be convened at Lyons. Thus
prelates and canonists both near and far had ample time for preparation
and travel.

With princes Gregory seemed to have the fortunate touch. Even the
difficult Charles of Anjou appeared to have no wish other than to please
him and sought the ceremonial privilege of holding the Pope's stirrup
when he mounted and the honor of serving his masses. His arbitration was
welcomed in the selection of the candidates for the Imperial honor and
his judgment gave the diadem to Rudolf, Count of Hapsburg. Thus the
Great Interregnum was ended and the Holy Roman Empire once again had a
recognized leader, albeit his power was far less than those former
wearers of the purple who had been so formidable in both their
animosities and friendships to the papacy. With the Greek emperor
Michael VIII Palaeologus,

<span class="small">Boniface VIII. Reigned from 1294 to 1303.</span>

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gregory's
negotiations were blessed with equal good fortune. The Byzantines sorely
needed protection from the Turks and to get it were apparently willing
to shed their prejudices against the Holy See. At least this was the
will of their Emperor who, after silencing the patriarch Joseph I by
imprisoning him in a secluded monastery, dispatched more agreeable
churchmen to represent him at Lyons. Over fifteen hundred prelates came
to form the Council and before them the Byzantine envoys professed
submission and with elaborate ceremony the schism of the East was
pronounced to be at an end. But ceremony born of political expediency is
a poor foundation for matters involving faith and within eight years the
frail union was ended and the schism was in being once again.

St. Bonaventure played a leading part at the gathering where amongst the
measures adopted—not without protest from some prelates—it was resolved
that a tax consisting of a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues for the
next ten years should be imposed to finance the Holy War. In order to
prevent long and dangerous vacancies of the Holy See rules were
formulated, such as the drastic curtailment of food after three days,
with a view to hastening the decision of cardinals in conclave. Other
decrees were aimed to control new religious orders and it was at this
Council that Avignon was given to the papacy in return for the forfeit
of certain rights in Provence. The result of Gregory's wide interests
and zeal was inevitable. His strength became overtaxed and instead of
resting after the Council he journeyed to Lausanne where he made treaty
with the new Emperor, Rudolf. From there he went to Milan and then to
Drezzo when suddenly an illness overwhelmed him and so weakened was his
condition because of overwork that he succumbed immediately. Thus passed
an able pope. Three great contemporary champions of the church, St.

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Louis, St. Thomas,
and St. Bonaventure, had preceded him to the grave and there seemed
nobody of similar stature on the horizon. Who then was to perpetuate the
ideals and precepts of medieval Christianity, that thing which had
eclipsed the greatness of the Roman Empire? And which now, by the
relentless process called progress, was undeniably, despite the vastness
of its structure and the glory of its ideals, faced with decline.

The legislation governing conclaves which Gregory had sponsored resulted
in a new pope very quickly. <span class="smallcaps">Innocent</span> V,
formerly known as Peter of Tarentaise, was a Frenchman and a Dominican
scholar of great repute who, in addition to his learning, had experience
as an administrator for he had been both Archbishop of Lyons and
Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia. On the assumption of his office his energies
were immediately occupied by efforts at peacemaking, efforts that were
directed to the realms of both religion and politics. He saw that the
unity of the Greeks and the Latins as proclaimed at Lyons was on a
precarious basis and he set out to try and strengthen the frail union.
Charles of Anjou did not welcome the pretensions of the new Emperor,
Rudolf of Hapsburg, and a quarrel seemed likely in that direction which
Innocent resolved to prevent. He was only fifty years old but suddenly
death, caused by a rapid fever, halted his activities after a
pontificate of only five months. Brief though his term had been that of
his successor, the Italian Cardinal Ottobuono Fieschi, <span
class="smallcaps">Pope Adrian</span> V, was even briefer for this pope
only survived his election by five weeks. He resided and died at Viterbo
and the most important feature of his reign was the fact that,
attributing his own ill health to hardships suffered whilst in conclave,
he suspended those regulations which had been made at Lyons and which
had been formulated to prevent time-wasting deadlock.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

Deadlock then was at the next conclave but after a month it was broken
because of the ugly mood of the townspeople of Viterbo who, rioting
outside the quarters of the congregated cardinals, made it emphatically
known that they were resolved there should be no long vacancy again.
Neither a Frenchman nor an Italian was chosen this time although there
was little doubt that the new pope, <span class="smallcaps">John</span>
XXI was supported by the Italian faction. He was a native of Portugal
and had been both friend and physician to Gregory X whom he had
accompanied to the Council of Lyons. He seems to have been an able man
of many parts for in addition to his skill in the science of medicine he
was a philosophical author of repute and as a churchman he had been
Archbishop of Braga and later cardinal-priest of Frascati. He was in his
middle fifties when elected and possessing splendid health and vigor he
energetically embarked upon a programme which was modeled upon the wide
policies of his patron, Gregory X. His representatives left for
Constantinople in an effort to stimulate and strengthen the supposed
union of the Eastern and Latin chuches, while others of his legates
worked strenuously to keep a state of peace between the Emperor Rudolf
and the still truculent Charles of Anjou. In England Edward I was
reminded that certain taxes promised to the papacy had been in arrears
for over fifty years and at Viterbo envoys from the Khan of Tartary
received sympathetic attention. Because of this visit, Franciscan
missionaries were soon after sent to China and Persia. The country of
the pope's birth, Portugal, also felt his influence with the improvement
of certain ecclesiastical conditions. Because of his magnificent health
and because of his great energy it was thought on all sides that the
reign of Pope John would be both long and fruitful but only eight months
after his installation he died of injuries received

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

when scaffolding collapsed in the library of the papal palace which he
was rebuilding at Viterbo.

For six months the Cardinals deliberated before the name of the Cardinal
Gaetano Orsini, a member of the powerful Roman family, was given. This
was a distinct rebuff to Charles of Anjou who was seeking the tiara for
a candidate of his liking and patronage. The new pope was called <span
class="smallcaps">Nicholas</span> III and although his career, under
eight pontiffs, as a high ranking cleric had been without reproach it
was now sullied by frank and unrestrained nepotism as to the Orsini
brood went a steady flow of rich benefices, high offices, and special
privileges. Of the six cardinals he created three were of his family and
the weak explanation was that he desired to clean Rome of all alien
influences. Highly apprehensive of the French he tried strenuously to
combat the intrigues of Charles of Anjou and from that ruler was taken
the dignity of the Roman Senatorship whilst to Charles’ enemy, the
Emperor Rudolf, who extravagantly made fervent confirmation of all
former Imperial promises and grants to the Holy See, went special
expressions and tokens of approval.

The affection Nicholas held for Rome had one advantage: for while
workmen swarmed busily, making repairs and additions to the Lateran and
Vatican palaces, the papal purse was opened still further to finance a
programme which brought wide beauty and ornament to the entire city.
Outside this sphere however his plans had little success and when he
died of apoplexy at Viterbo during the summer of 1280 the alert Charles
of Anjou was on hand, determined this time that his will should sway the
opinions of the conclave. His machinations succeeded but not with ease
for again six months of dispute and deadlock passed before a pope was
made. He was Simon de Brion and he took the name of <span
class="smallcaps">Martin</span> IV (actually he

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

was but the second Martin but chose to be called the fourth to avoid
confusion with the Popes Marinus). He was a Frenchman and a
cardinal-priest and was without any doubt under the complete domination
of the now triumphant Charles to whom victory brought neither temperance
in judgment nor moderation in action. Once again this prince gave to
himself the titular glory of being called Senator of Rome although the
city was too dangerous a residence either for himself or for his pope
who was installed at Orvieto where he awaited such directions as he
received with quick obedience and smooth docility. As the previous
pontiff had given to his family, so now the favours were poured, without
stint or discretion, to the French. And punishments, under the same
solemn authority, were delivered against all who dared to oppose the
whims of King Charles. Excommunication was the quick lot of the Eastern
Emperor for the alleged violation of those convenient promises made at
the Council of Lyons; and similar sentences came flood-like but unheeded
when in Sicily there was a revolt against the tyranny of the French and
when, after a bloody massacre of the intruders by the dangerous tempered
Sicilians, they proclaimed the rightful monarch to be, not Charles, but
Peter of Aragon, son-in-law of Manfred. Before he could fully cope with
these circumstances Charles died on January 7, 1285 and the pope
followed him a few months later. During their last days and whilst
calamity was in Sicily all pretence of the Eastern Church's being in
communion with the Latin was completely dissipated by the new Emperor of
the East, Andronicus II, who upon succeeding to his throne broke all
former pacts with Rome and restored those Byzantine prelates, including
the Patriarch of Constantinople, who had been ousted by Michael.

Pope Martin had died on the 25th of March 1285 and

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

within a week the cardinals, gathered in hasty conclave at Perugia,
selected a Roman, Giacomo Savelli, Cardinal deacon and papal prefect of
Tuscany, to be his successor. No great deeds could have been expected of
him by his electors for he was five years beyond the normal span and so
infirm that he was forced to celebrate mass sitting down. <span
class="smallcaps">Honorius</span> IV was the style he chose and leaving
Perugia after his election he was able to take up residence in Rome. His
reign lasted two years and during that time he proved to be a notable
patron of the Mendicant Orders and the universities, particularly that
of Paris which was his Alma Mater and where he caused to be established
the teaching of Oriental languages so as to make easier the relations of
the Church with the Eastern peoples.

The next pope was an Italian also but not until six wasteful months of
dispute after the death of Honorius was his name announced. He was <span
class="smallcaps">Nicholas</span> IV and while of humble origin was
General of the Franciscans and had been known as the Cardinal Jerome
Masci of Ascoli. In the sphere of missionary and educational activities
his endeavours met with success. The universities of Montpelier, Lisbon,
and Gratz in Styria were founded in his reign and in Pekin Franciscan
fathers threw open the doors of their chapel and displayed the solemn
pageantry of the Mass and its mysteries to the wondering natives. In
other fields however Pope Nicholas had not the same happy success. He
was closely, too closely, associated with the Colonna family and faction
and perhaps it was they, possessed and driven by the familiar Roman
appetite, who influenced his actions in the fields of diplomacy. Two of
them he had created cardinals, another was made Count of the Romagna,
and a fourth became Roman Senator. With the approval of these friends
the papal endorsement was given to Charles, the son of the late Charles
of Anjou,

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

as Sicilian monarch but in reality it was James of Aragon who was to
hold that unstable throne. The Pope opposed the nominee of the Emperor
Rudolph for the crown of Hungary and put forward his own candidate but
the fierce-willed Hungarians would have none of either and selected
their own ruler, Prince Andrew, who was so invested and from then on
clung staunchly to his throne.

In vain Nicholas threatened punishment. The papal displeasure seemed to
mean little to the temporal ruler now, and if further proof was needed
of waning authority and influence there came the news of the fall of
Acre, a final and complete Saracen victory in the Holy Land. Despite the
desperate efforts of the pontiff no new crusade was undertaken. He tried
to outfit a fleet and muster an army but except for some interest in
England the princes of Christendom remained lethargic to his entreaties
and Palestine was forced to remain Mohammedan property until six
centuries later. The year following this calamitous event witnessed the
death of Nicholas on April 4th, 1292, but not until two years and three
months had passed was there another pope. The most vigorous action was
needed to unify Christendom but the response of the cardinals was an
unsavoury and disgraceful exhibition of procrastination and intrigue.
The scene of the Conclave shifted from Rome to Perugia and as the first
year of vacancy passed, then the second, it appeared that the
quarrelsome and often base schemes of the jealous and obstinate prelates
would never be guided by high purpose or be cemented with unanimity.

One of the older cardinals, an Orsini, finally proposed the measure
which was adopted to end the disagreeable situation. It was his idea
that the electoral gaze should be directed beyond the College of
Cardinals and someone be found who was free from the prejudices of
factions or the

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

favour of princes. The suggestion was received by his colleagues with
approval and when the name of Peter of Morone was advanced the applause
continued for Peter of Morone was an eighty-year-old peasant-born hermit
renowned for virtue and piety. He had started his monastic life as a
Benedictine but in time had sought an even more austere existence by
forming a community known as the Benedictine Celestines on Monte Morone.
To this place three cardinals deputized by their comrades journeyed and
made known their decision. The consternation which replaced the usual
placidity of the monastery can well be imagined. Peter was terrified and
retreating to his cell tearfully set forth that his age, his
infirmities, his ignorance of the world, could not allow of acceptance.
But the cardinals were firm and their suave arguments made so solemn and
awesome by the authority of the Conclave overwhelmed the protestations
of the trembling monk and eventually convinced him that a refusal of
their entreaties would be a rejection of Divine Will. Thus convinced
that the new role was a duty of his vocation he ventured forth from the
walls which had been the boundaries of his world for so long and was
led, the centre of a noisy and triumphant assemblage, to Aguila. Here he
was crowned and given the name of <span
class="smallcaps">Celestine</span> V.

Once again there was a pope and he was truly good and pious and humble
but unfortunately these simple virtues do not in themselves constitute
that talent which is demanded in a leader. Celestine was not only
innocent of wickedness but he was also ignorant of its forms and
devices. Truly Christian, he was willing to accept any man for the
values he professed and for what he seemed to be. When Charles II of
Naples, who was as astute and ambitious as his late parent, held the
papal stirrup and was sweetly submissive with the downcast eyes of a
true

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

penitent the Pope was enchanted. Thinking he had found a true friend,
wise in the art of government and high of principle, he accepted with
sighs of gratitude and relief the advice of the wily monarch. Royal
wishes soon became papal proclamations and under such auspices twelve
new cardinals were made (with the French outnumbering the Italians).
Favours and benefices were lavished upon those who, held the King's good
will and who in the presence of the pontiff were suitably correct in the
outward forms of devotion. Under such conditions the papal court became
a place of mockery and tragic mummery and when realization came to the
startled pontiff he retreated to a cell, hastily improvised in the papal
palace, where he sought a solution to his troubles by fasting, prayer,
and mortification. Then, after consulting canonists, he announced he
would abdicate "because of my lowliness, my desire for a more perfect
life, my great age and infirmities, my inexperience and ignorance of the
world's affairs." (He was one of the six pontiffs who have ended their
reigns by resignation. The others were Marcellinus, Liberius, Benedict
IX, Gregory VI, and Gregory XII.)
