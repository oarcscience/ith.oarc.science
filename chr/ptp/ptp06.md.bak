### Sixth Century

Peace enveloped the Holy See with accession of its next

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

occupant, <span class="smallcaps">Hormisdas</span>, in 514. A Roman
aristocrat of great personal charm and blessed with the better
diplomatic traits he won back many schismatic bishops to the Church
without sacrificing the policies of his predecessors. While keeping good
terms with King Theodoric he sent embassies to the Byzantine Emperor
Anastasius who, while friendly, remained obdurately steadfast to the
heretical party. But with Anastasius’ successor, Justin, the pope won
success and on the Holy Thursday of the year 519 a reunion, temporary
though it proved to be, of the Roman and Greek Churches was celebrated
with joy and pomp.

Not so serene was the lot of the next pontiff, <span
class="smallcaps">John</span>, a Tuscan, upon whom fell the ire of
Theodoric. The new peace between Rome and Constantinople had alarmed
that hitherto tolerant monarch and he received with anger the
information that Justin was forcibly depriving of their civil rights
those of his subjects who still remained staunch to their Arian beliefs.
Theodoric, an Arian himself, called upon Pope John and told him he
expected the same tolerance shown to his fellow believers in the East as
he had exhibited to his Catholic subjects in the West. It was a
dangerous situation for the Pope and he undertook to solve it by
journeying to Constantinople, the first of his rank ever to do so, and
conferring with Justin. He received a magnificent welcome and the
tumultuous crowds of the Eastern metropolis had the wonder of witnessing
their Emperor bow his proud and purple-clad person before the pontiff,
humbly beseeching the honor of being crowned by the consecrated hands.
The news of this triumphant reception of John by the persecutor of his
co-religionists was conveyed back to Italy and only served to infuriate
King Theodoric the more. Meanwhile John had conscientiously employed his
influence successfully to stay the measures of oppression levelled
against the Arians; but it

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

was too much to expect that he, head of the Catholic Church, would plead
that the large numbers of those former Arians, converted it was true by
the Emperor's forceful actions, should revert to their former state of
heresy.

With the echoes of Imperial homage still fresh in his memory John on his
return to Rome was seized by Theodoric's officers and incarcerated.
Being old and infirm he was unable to survive such adversity and so he
soon perished in imprisonment. Nor was he the sole victim of the royal
injustice. Also arrested were two greatly respected men of Rome, the
philosopher Boethius and his aged relative, Symmachus. Theodoric who for
so long had withstood the temptations of despotism had finally succumbed
to those excesses of suspicion and uncertainty which lead to tyranny.
Jealously he watched over the machinations of the next papal election
and there can be no doubt his powerful influence carried weight in the
choice of that gathering. The pontiff announced was <span
class="smallcaps">Felix</span> IV who was consecrated Bishop of Rome on
the 12th July, 526. The royal favor he had enjoyed as a candidate for
the papal honors this pope now employed to the benefit of the Church
without sacrificing the dignities or the responsibilities of his office.

When Theodoric died his successors, the minor Athalaric and his regent
mother, maintained the same amicable relations between Prince and
Pontiff and it was undoubtedly because of this friendship that a Royal
Edict was issued confirming the rights and privileges of ecclesiastical
courts. Under this law such courts were to be the sole judges of
clerical conduct, even when an erring churchman violated the ordinary
civil or criminal codes. Pope Felix seems to have feared a dominance of
the Church by the Byzantine party and in order that such an event should
not happen he, when aware death was approaching, conferred his own

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

pallium on the age-bent shoulders of his friend the Archdeacon Boniface
with a proclamation that here was his successor. Threats of
excommunication against anyone who would dare to oppose his wishes were
delivered with his pronouncement, and after his death in the latter part
of 530 <span class="smallcaps">Boniface</span> II took office. Here was
the first pontiff of Germanic ancestry and his character and record,
both as pope and priest, are that of a pious and charitable man. But the
unprecedented method of his ascension to the papal rank found no favor
with many of the Roman clergy who promptly met and pronounced one of
their own number, Dioscorus, to be the real pope. What threatened to be
a stubborn deadlock was solved, only twenty-two days later, by the death
of the contender Dioscorus whereupon Boniface convened a synod which
after deliberating on the validity of his claims delivered an assurance
of their immediate and future obedience. Soon after he called together a
second synod and proposed, and his proposal was accepted, that a
constitution be formed which would give him also the right to select a
successor. But the dangerous resolution was not destined for
fulfillment. This was an age when the shame of simony was not uncommon
and that the elevation to the supreme office of the Church should depend
upon, and be subjected to, the weaknesses of any one man was abhorrent
to the people. Such a storm of protest greeted the announcement that a
third synod was hastily assembled and the constitution which he had so
enthusiastically sponsored was burned publicly by the Pope himself. And
when he died the man he had named, one Vigilius, was not elected as his
successor. Instead, <span class="smallcaps">John</span> II, a priest of
St. Clement's Basilica, was installed on the 22nd July 533. The first
pope to change his name on accession he ruled for only two years but the
next two pontiffs were to have reigns of even scantier duration. <span
class="smallcaps">Agapitus</span>, succeeding

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> John, became the
second pope to visit Constantinople and like the first his journey was
because of a request from the King of Italy.

Justinian I now wore the Imperial diadem of the East and with the
glories of the past to inspire his considerable abilities he had set out
to restore the Empire. The defeat of the Persians, the conquest of the
Vandals in Africa, the ousting of the Gothic rulers of Italy, the
re-arrangement and clarification of Roman Law, and a prodigious
patronage of the arts were all part of a vast scheme which occupied his
energies and followed his high ambitions for a reign that was to endure
more than three decades. When his troops were menacing Italy the Gothic
King Theodehad besought the Pope, in the interests of peace, to
intercede with him.

The Pope, escorted by five bishops and a suitable retinue, set out for
Constantinople where he was received with all the niceties of Imperial
courtesy. He made his plea but Justinian was not to be dissuaded from
his dreams of a united Empire. However, the failure of this mission did
not prevent the pontifical visit from achieving other important results.
Owing to the powerful influence of the Empress Theodora, a woman of
resolute purposes and dubious antecedents, a heretical bishop, Anthimos,
had invalidly assumed the title and privileges of the Byzantine
Patriarchate; a position which he occupied with little grace and no
popularity. On representations from the disturbed clergy Agapitus
ordered Anthimos to quit the patriarchal seat; whereupon the Empress,
enraged at this affront to her protégé and to her will, and skillfully
uniting the weapons of her position, cunning, and sex, persuaded her
husband that Imperial commands and privileges were being rejected and
denied by the pope. Thus incited to anger Justinian threatened

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agapitus with
banishment but the pontiff received his words with sadness and refusal
to be awed by them.

"I came," he said, "to gaze upon a Christian Emperor Justinian. In his
place I find a Diocletian whose threats, however, terrify me not." Such
courage from an aged and unarmed man cooled Justinian's wrath and
excited his admiration. He made a thorough investigation of the
patriarchal pretender and finally agreed he be deposed. And while his
defeated consort brooded sullenly, a dangerous mood for such a
determined female, great rejoicing was manifested by the clergy and
populace as Agapitus then consecrated to the Byzantine See a rightful
occupant. But he did not live to see his triumph acclaimed in Rome. He
died on the 22nd of April, 536, and his remains were conveyed back to
the Eternal City where they were interred amidst scenes of veneration
and sorrow. Elected then was <span class="smallcaps">Silverius</span>,
the son of Pope Hormisdas (who had been married before accepting the
higher orders of the priesthood; a practice still permitted in the Greek
Orthodox Church and in some of the Eastern rites in communion with the
Holy See. Thus the same strange occurrence, the son of a pope achieving
the same high rank as his father, could happen in modern times).

Silverius was elected and installed but the staunch fact was not an
obstacle sufficiently important to deter the schemes of the Empress
Theodora. Acutely aware that she had been successfully opposed by one
pope, she was now inexorably determined to have a creature of her choice
occupy the august station. Accompanying Agapitus to Constantinople had
been the deacon Vigilius, the same whom Pope Boniface II had proclaimed
as his successor. That ill-received announcement had left a dangerous
echo in his memory and the Empress found in him a willing and eager
participator in her plans. He promised to give recognition

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

to the heresy she favored, the Monophysite and to restore her ousted
favourite to the honors of the Byzantine Patriarchate if she aided him
to procure the tenancy of the Holy See. But what of the already elected
Pope? The solution was simple and shameful. Justinian's armies had,
under the brilliant leadership of Belisarius, successfully driven back
the Goths and were now occupying Rome. Theodora's agents, with a display
of forged letters, accused Pope Silverius of treasonably communicating
with the Goths and by the commands of the Byzantine commander he was
divested of the insignia of his exalted rank, thrust into rough garb of
a monk, and exiled as a prisoner to an island where he soon perished.
After an "election" conducted under the formidable and certainly not
disinterested protection of Belisarius, <span
class="smallcaps">Vigilius</span> was finally enthroned, while at
Constantinople Theodora enjoyed the stimulating tonic of triumph.

But her satisfaction was not destined for permanence. Vigilius, on his
ascension to the papal rank, absolved himself of his promises to his
benefactress and revealed that his policies were to be as orthodox as
had been those of his predecessors. His pontificate, so irregularly
gained, was never to bring him tranquillity and, in 544, he entered upon
a serious disagreement with Justinian. The Emperor, not content with his
many other activities, now saw fit to exercise his talents in the field
of theology, a formidable pastime for one who so quickly could settle
debate or emphasize opinion by a gesture to his soldiery. The bishops
and clergy close to his court had readily subscribed to an edict issued
by him which condemned the "Three Chapters" and by which he hoped to
make peace with the Monophysites. The "Three Chapters" were the
teachings of Theodore of Mopsuestia; the writings of Theodoret of Cyrus
in favour of Nestorius and against St. Cyril and the

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Synod of Ephesus;
and the letter of Ibas of Edessa to the Persian Bishop Maris.
Undoubtedly there was heresy in the "Three Chapters" but endorsement by
Vigilius of this condemnation might have seemed to mean his repudiation
of the Council of Chalcedon—for Chalcedon had reinstated two of the
authors in question when they had repudiated the Nestorian heresy.
Besides all this was an encroachment by the Emperor and thus by the
secular power on the prerogatives and duties of the Church. Vigilius
demurred and hesitated but not so the Emperor. His soldiers seized the
Pope and carried him to Constantinople where for seven years he was
detained. These seven years are an unhappy story of his vacillations,
his oppositions, and sometimes his submissions, to the Emperor who
finally released him. But by this time the unfortunate pope was an old
and broken man. He died before reaching Rome.

<span class="smallcaps">Pelagius</span>, the next pope, suffered the
sharpness of unpopularity during the first years of his jurisdiction
because of the conciliatory attitude he adopted in negotiating with
Justinian. But soon an abundance of good works and his energetic talents
in preventing and healing schisms served to dispel antagonism. The
savage conflict between the Goths and Justinian's troops had devastated
Italy and the neglect of the harvests and the spoliation of towns had
reduced the people to the direst depths of poverty. Pelagius, who came
of a rich and noble Roman family, not only donated his entire personal
fortune but performed other great feats of charity and well-merited was
the title he bore when he died in 560: "Father of the poor and of his
country."

Five months elapsed before his successor, <span
class="smallcaps">John</span> III, could be consecrated. It took that
time—and by now significantly there is no question about it—to receive
the Emperor's confirmation and approval. Though this pope's reign lasted

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

thirteen years little is known of it. Turbulent and war-torn was the
period and the part played by the pontiff is best described on an
inscription which still existed in the XV Century: "In the midst of
straits he knew how to be bountiful, and feared not to be crushed amidst
a tumbling world." Nearly a year went by before the Imperial
confirmation arrived to sanction the installation of <span
class="smallcaps">Benedict</span> I and again it is the chaos of war,
the ravaging of the Lombards, which obliterates the details of a
pontificate that did not last five years. <span
class="smallcaps">Pelagius</span> II, a Goth, was then elected
and—typical of the initiative he was always to display—he did not wait
for Imperial confirmation. The effective blockade of Rome by the
Lombards was a reason sufficient in his opinion to dispense with this
irksome assumption of a right that the Emperor did not have; and after
but a semblance of waiting he was consecrated and installed. The
responsibility of temporal affairs as pertaining to the countryside
surrounding Rome was now being forced upon the papacy. Appalling
conditions bred by the marauding military finally induced Pelagius to
appeal not only to Constantinople but to the Franks. To the Bishop of
Auxerre he wrote: "We believe that it has been brought about by a
special dispensation of Divine Providence, that the Frankish Princes
should prefer the orthodox faith, like the Roman Emperors, in order that
they may help this city, whence it took its rise. Persuade them with all
earnestness to keep from any alliance with our most unspeakable enemies,
the Lombards." To Constantinople he sent an able ecclesiastic, the
deacon Gregory, who finally persuaded the Emperor, now Maurice, to
answer the Pope's pleas with the despatch of a relief expedition. The
many tasks involving the defense and well being of temporal Rome were
not the only occupations of Pelagius II. He strove to preserve and
improve [hierarchal](errata.htm#1.md) harmony and when certain bishops
threatened

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

to recede into one of the innumerable schisms of the period he wrote
that they were doing so "for the sake of superfluous question"; a
statement which, seen from the perspective of centuries, seems very true
indeed.

Pestilence is a familiar aftermath of war and there was no exception to
this sad rule when a temporary truce was finally made with the Lombards.
As though to complete the depredations of the enemy a terrible plague
descended upon Rome and perishing amidst the resultant horrors was the
pontiff. The name of his successor is illustrious. Elected at a time
when famine stalked the streets of Rome and when deathcarts, rumbling to
their dreaded tasks, were the only traffic of those broad avenues. <span
class="smallcaps">Gregory the Great</span> was destined to become one of
the great popes and the Father of the Medieval Church. His ability
combined with the fact of his patrician birth had secured for him the
post of Prefect of Rome at the age of thirty. This honor he renounced
and donating his estates to the monasteries he entered upon the austere
life of a simple monk, following the rule of St. Benedict. But his
talents were far too well known to permit of his being, as he wished,
forgotten by the world. In the grievous times of 579 Pope Pelagius II
ordered him from his seclusion, ordained him one of the Seven Deacons of
Rome, and despatched him as his Nuncio to the Byzantine Court; a
position he occupied with brilliance and, amidst the luxuries and
artifices of that exotic assemblage, considerable personal distaste.
Much more to his liking was his appointment on his return to Rome, as
Abbot of St. Andrew's monastery. Here, under the fostering of his
enthusiasm and knowledge, the monks acquired great fame for their piety,
learning, and munificent charities. During this time he became imbued
with a zeal to go to Britain and there assist in converting the Angles
but

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

when he commenced the missionary journey his path was blocked by the
protesting citizens.

Such a man, already so popular, was inevitably marked for the papacy
and, after the death of Pelagius II, he was elected as Pope amidst the
unanimous acclamation of clergy and people. Dreading to take the high
office and loath to leave the peace of the cloisters he wrote to the
Emperor a letter of eloquent entreaty, beseeching him to withhold the
official confirmation. But this measure failed; and finally he was
seized by the people, conveyed to the Basilica of St. Peter's, and
consecrated Pope. Once in office he not only rapidly fulfilled but soon
exceeded the high expectations of his admirers. Banishing idlers and
perquisite-holding laymen from the papal court he formed a highly
efficient administrative body of hard working clerics, most of whom were
monks. The papal estates, known as "St. Peter's Patrimony" and now
constituting an area of some fifteen hundred square miles, were
regulated so as to become a highly productive source of charity. To
protect the peoples and revenues of these lands he was forced to the
wielding of temporal power and the paternal significance of his title
became splendidly realized when, unafraid of Imperial displeasure and
exasperated with the dilatory methods of the Byzantine authorities, he
sued for separate peace or, as the occasion demanded, made bold
resistance against the Lombards. This man, who so earnestly had desired
the contemplative peace of a monk's life, was, by circumstance and
responsibility, thrust to the position of a sovereign prince, to become
a ruler of cities and provinces, a master of troops and fleets.
"Gregory's exercise of his power was one of the great moments in the
world's history" wrote one historian. "All over the Christian world he
had taught men to look to the Pope as one who could make peace and ensue
it." Nor was he ever to cease being

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

the exemplary ecclesiastic either in private conduct or in the execution
of his office. In an age when titles were a Serious measure of a man's
rank and pretensions, he chose for himself, and founded for his
successors, the great phrase "*servus servorum Dei*" ("servant of the
servants of God"). The Church of today carries the mark of his genius in
her liturgy, music, and discipline. And his story is made all the
brighter by reason of the ill-health he suffered throughout his
pontificate which ended, to the sorrow of his people, on the 12th of
March, 604.
