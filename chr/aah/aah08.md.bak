### LETTER VI

#### Abelard to Heloise

<span class="margnote">Abelard is firm</span>WRITE no more to me,
Heloise, write no more to me; ’tis time to end communications which make
our penances of nought avail. We retired from the world to purify
ourselves, and, by a conduct directly contrary to Christian morality, we
became odious to Jesus Christ. Let us no more deceive ourselves with
remembrance of our past pleasures; we but make our lives troubled and
spoil the sweets of solitude. Let us make good use of our austerities
and no longer preserve the memories of our crimes amongst the severities
of penance. Let a mortification of body and mind, a strict fasting,
continual solitude, profound and holy meditations, and a sincere love of
God succeed our former irregularities.

Let us try to carry religious perfection to its farthest point. It is
beautiful to find Christian minds so disengaged from earth, from the
creatures and themselves, that they seem to act independently of those
bodies they are joined to, and to use them as their slaves. We can never
raise ourselves to too great heights when God is our object. Be our
efforts ever so great they will always come short of attaining that
exalted Divinity which even our apprehension cannot reach. Let us act
for God's glory independent of the creatures or ourselves, paying no
regard to

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="margnote">The Master and Father</span>our own desires or
the opinions of others. Were we in this temper of mind, Heloise, I would
willingly make my abode at the Paraclete, and by my earnest care for the
house I have founded draw a thousand blessings on it. I would instruct
it by my words and animate it by my example: I would watch over the
lives of my Sisters, and would command nothing but what I myself would
perform: I would direct you to pray, meditate, labour, and keep vows of
silence; and I would myself pray, labour, meditate, and be silent.

And when I spoke it should be to lift you up when you should fall, to
strengthen you in your weaknesses, to enlighten you in that darkness and
obscurity which might at any time surprise you. I would comfort you
under the severities used by persons of great virtue: I would moderate
the vivacity of your zeal and piety and give your virtue an even
temperament: I would point out those duties you ought to perform, and
satisfy those doubts which through the weakness of your reason might
arise. I would be your master and father, and by a marvellous talent I
would become lively or slow, gentle or severe, according to the
different characters of those I should guide in the painful path to
Christian perfection.

But whither does my vain imagination carry me! Ah, Heloise, how far are
we from such a happy temper? Your heart still burns with that fatal fire
you cannot extinguish, and mine is full of trouble and unrest. Think
not, Heloise, that I here enjoy a perfect peace; I will for the last
time open my heart to you;--I am not yet disengaged from you, and though
I fight against my

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<span class="margnote">He cannot achieve content</span>excessive
tenderness for you, in spite of all my endeavours I remain but too
sensible of your sorrows and long to share in them. Your letters have
indeed moved me; I could not read with indifference characters written
by that dear hand! I sigh and weep, and all my reason is scarce
sufficient to conceal my weakness from my pupils. This, unhappy Heloise,
is the miserable condition of Abelard. The world, which is generally
wrong in its notions, thinks I am at peace, and imagining that I loved
you only for the gratification of the senses, have now forgot you. What
a mistake is this! People indeed were not wrong in saying that when we
separated it was shame and grief that made me abandon the world. It was
not, as you know, a sincere repentance for having offended God which
inspired me with a design for retiring. However, I consider our
misfortunes as a secret design of Providence to punish our sins; and
only look upon Fulbert as the instrument of divine vengeance. Grace drew
me into an asylum where I might yet have remained if the rage of my
enemies would have permitted; I have endured all their persecutions, not
doubting that God Himself raised them up in order to purify me.

When He saw me perfectly obedient to His Holy Will, He permitted that I
should justify my doctrine; I made its purity public, and showed in the
end that my faith was not only orthodox, but also perfectly clear from
all suspicion of novelty.

I should be happy if I had none to fear but my enemies, and no other
hindrance to my salvation but their calumny. But, Heloise, *you* 

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

<span class="margnote">He exhorts her to strive </span>make me tremble,
your letters declare to me that you are enslaved to human love, and yet,
if you cannot conquer it, you cannot be saved; and what part would you
have me play in this trial? Would you have me stifle the inspirations of
the Holy Ghost? Shall I, to soothe you, dry up those tears which the
Evil Spirit makes you shed--shall this be the fruit of my meditations?
No, let us be more firm in our resolutions; we have not retired save to
lament our sins and to gain heaven; let us then resign ourselves to God
with all our heart.

I know everything is difficult in the beginning; but it is glorious to
courageously start a great action, and glory increases proportionately
as the difficulties are more considerable. We ought on this account to
surmount bravely all obstacles which might hinder us in the practice of
Christian virtue. In a monastery men are proved as gold in a furnace. No
one can continue long there unless he bear worthily the yoke of the
Lord.

Attempt to break those shameful chains which bind you to the flesh, and
if by the assistance of grace you are so happy as to accomplish this, I
entreat you to think of me in your prayers. Endeavour with all your
strength to be the pattern of a perfect Christian; it is difficult, I
confess, but not impossible; and I expect this beautiful triumph from
your teachable disposition. If your first efforts prove weak do not give
way to despair, for that would be cowardice; besides, I would have you
know that you must necessarily take great pains, for you strive to
conquer a terrible enemy, to extinguish a raging fire, to reduce

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

<span class="margnote">Temptations in the cloister </span>to subjection
your dearest affections. You have to fight against your own desires, so
be not pressed down with the weight of your corrupt nature. You have to
do with a cunning adversary who will use all means to seduce you; be
always upon your guard. While we live we are exposed to temptations;
this made a great saint say, 'The life of man is one long temptation':
the devil, who never sleeps, walks continually around us in order to
surprise us on some unguarded side, and enters into our soul in order to
destroy it.

However perfect anyone may be, yet he may fall into temptations, and
perhaps into such as may be useful. Nor is it wonderful that man should
never be exempt from them, because he always hath in himself their
source; scarce are we delivered from one temptation when another attacks
us. Such is the lot of the posterity of Adam, that they should always
have something to suffer, because they have forfeited their primitive
happiness. We vainly flatter ourselves that we shall conquer temptations
by flying; if we join not patience and humility we shall torment
ourselves to no purpose. We shall more certainly compass our end by
imploring God's assistance than by using any means of our own.

Be constant, Heloise, and trust in God; then you shall fall into few
temptations: when they come stifle them at their birth--let them not
take root in your heart. 'Apply remedies to a disease,' said an ancient,
'at the beginning, for when it hath gained strength medicines are of no
avail': temptations have their degrees, they are at first mere thoughts
and do not appear dangerous;

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

<span class="margnote">Dispraise of the world</span>the imagination
receives them without any fears; the pleasure grows; we dwell upon it,
and at last we yield to it.

Do you now, Heloise, applaud my design of making you walk in the steps
of the saints? Do my words give you any relish for penitence? Have you
not remorse for your wanderings, and do you not wish you could, like
Magdalen, wash our Saviour's feet with your tears? If you have not yet
these ardent aspirations, pray that you may be inspired by them. I shall
never cease to recommend you in my prayers and to beseech God to assist
you in your design of dying holily. You have quitted the world, and what
object was worthy to detain you there? Lift up your eyes always to Him
to whom the rest of your days are consecrated. Life upon this earth is
misery; the very necessities to which our bodies are subject here are
matters of affliction to a saint. 'Lord,' said the royal prophet,
'deliver me from my necessities.' Many are wretched who do not know they
are; and yet they are more wretched who know their misery and yet cannot
hate the corruption of the age. What fools are men to engage themselves
to earthly things! They will be undeceived one day, and will know too
late how much they have been to blame in loving such false good. Truly
pious persons are not thus mistaken; they are freed from all sensual
pleasures and raise their desires to Heaven.

Begin, Heloise; put your design into action without delay; you have yet
time enough to work out your salvation. Love Christ, and despise
yourself for His sake; He will possess your heart

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

<span class="margnote">The duties of a ruler</span>and be the sole
object of your sighs and tears; seek for no comfort but in Him. If you
do not free yourself from me, you will fall with me; but if you leave me
and cleave to Him, you will be steadfast and safe. If you force the Lord
to forsake you, you will fall into trouble; but if you are faithful to
Him you shall find joy. Magdalen wept, thinking that Jesus had forsaken
her, but Martha said, 'See, the Lord calls you.' Be diligent in your
duty, obey faithfully the calls of grace, and Jesus will be with you.
Attend, Heloise, to some instructions I have to give you: you are at the
head of a society, and you know there is a difference between those who
lead a private life and those who are charged with the conduct of
others: the first need only labour for their own sanctification, and in
their round of duties are not obliged to practise all the virtues in
such an apparent manner: but those who have the charge of others
entrusted to them ought by their example to encourage their followers to
do all the good of which they are capable. I beseech you to remember
this truth, and so to follow it that your whole life may be a perfect
model of that of a religious recluse.

God heartily desires our salvation, and has made all the means of it
easy to us. In the Old Testament He has written in the tables of law
what He requires of us, that we might not be bewildered in seeking after
His will. In the New Testament He has written the law of grace to the
intent that it might ever be present in our hearts; so, knowing the
weakness and incapacity of our nature, He has given us grace to perform
His will. And, as if

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

<span class="margnote">The death of a saint</span>this were not enough,
He has raised up at all times, in all states of the Church, men who by
their exemplary life can excite others to their duty. To effect this He
has chosen persons of every age, sex and condition. Strive now to unite
in yourself all the virtues of these different examples. Have the purity
of virgins, the austerity of anchorites, the zeal of pastors and
bishops, and the constancy of martyrs. Be exact in the course of your
whole life to fulfil the duties of a holy and enlightened superior, and
then death, which is commonly considered as terrible, will appear agree-
able to you.

'The death of His saints,' says the prophet, 'is precious in the sight
of the Lord.' Nor is it difficult to discover why their death should
have this advantage over that of sinners. I have remarked three things
which might have given the prophet an occasion of speaking thus:--First,
their resignation to the will of God; second, the continuation of their
good works; and lastly, the triumph they gain over the devil.

A saint who has accustomed himself to submit to the will of God yields
to death without reluctance. He waits with joy (says Dr. Gregory) for
the Judge who is to reward him; he fears not to quit this miserable
mortal life in order to begin an immortal happy one. It is not so with
the sinner, says the same Father; he fears, and with reason, he trembles
at the approach of the least sickness; death is terrible to him because
he dreads the presence of the offended Judge; and having so often abused
the means of grace he sees no way to avoid the punishment of his sins.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<span class="margnote">The Cross of Christ</span>The saints have also
this advantage over sinners, that having become familiar with works of
piety of during their life they exercise them without trouble, and
having gained new strength against the devil every time they overcame
him, they will find themselves in a condition at the hour of death to
obtain that victory on which depends all eternity, and the blessed union
of their souls with their Creator.

I hope, Heloise, that after having deplored the irregularities of your
past life, you will 'die the death of the righteous.' Ah, how few there
are who make this end! And why? It is because there are so few who love
the Cross of Christ. Everyone wishes to be saved, but few will use those
means which religion prescribes. Yet can we be saved by nothing but the
Cross: why then refuse to bear it? Hath not our Saviour bore it before
us, and died for us, to the end that we might also bear it and desire to
die also? All the saints have suffered affliction, and our Saviour
himself did not pass one hour of His life without some sorrow. Hope not
therefore to be exempt from suffering: the Cross, Heloise, is always at
hand, take care that you do not receive it with regret, for by so doing
you will make it more heavy and you will he oppressed by it to no
profit. On the contrary, if you bear it with willing courage, all your
sufferings will create in you a holy confidence whereby you will find
comfort in God. Hear our Saviour who says, 'My child, renounce yourself,
take up your Cross and follow Me. Oh, Heloise, do you doubt? Is not your
soul ravished at so saving a command? Are you insensible to

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

<span class="margnote">The fear of hell</span>words so full of kindness?
Beware, Heloise, of refusing a Husband who demands you, and who is more
to be feared than any earthly lover. Provoked at your contempt and
ingratitude, He will turn His love into anger and make you feel His
vengeance. How will you sustain His presence when you shall stand before
His tribunal? He will reproach you for having despised His grace, He
will represent to you His sufferings for you. What answer can you make?
He will then be implacable: He will say to you, 'Go, proud creature, and
dwell in everlasting flames. I separated you from the world to purify
you in solitude and you did not second my design. I endeavoured to save
you and you wilfully destroyed yourself; go, wretch, and take the
portion of the reprobates.'

Oh, Heloise, prevent these terrible words, and avoid, by a holy life,
the punishment prepared for sinners. I dare not give you a description
of those dreadful torments which are the consequences of a career of
guilt. I am filled with horror when they offer themselves to my
imagination. And yet, Heloise, I can conceive nothing which can reach
the tortures of the damned; the fire which we see upon this earth is but
the shadow of that which burns them; and without enumerating their
endless pains, the loss of God which they feel increases all their
torments. Can anyone sin who is persuaded of this? My God! can we dare
to offend Thee? Though the riches of Thy mercy could not engage us to
love Thee, the dread of being thrown into such an abyss of misery should
restrain us from doing anything which might displease Thee.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

<span class="margnote">The hope of heaven </span>I question not,
Heloise, but you will hereafter apply yourself in good earnest to the
business of your salvation; this ought to be your whole concern. Banish
me, therefore, for ever from your heart--it is the best advice I can
give you, for the remembrance of a person we have loved guiltily cannot
but be hurtful, whatever advances we may have made in the way of virtue.
When you have extirpated your unhappy inclination towards me, the
practice of every virtue will become easy; and when at last your life is
conformable to that of Christ, death will be desirable to you. Your soul
will joyfully leave this body, and direct its flight to heaven. Then you
will appear with confidence before your Saviour; you will not read your
reprobation written in the judgment book, but you will hear your Saviour
say, Come, partake of My glory, and enjoy the eternal reward I have
appointed for those virtues you have practised.

Farewell, Heloise, this is the last advice of your dear Abelard; for the
last time let me persuade you to follow the rules of the Gospel. Heaven
grant that your heart, once so sensible of my love, may now yield to be
directed by my zeal. May the idea of your loving Abelard, always present
to your mind, be now changed into the image of Abelard truly penitent;
and may you shed as many tears for your salvation as you have done for
our misfortunes.
