### LETTER V

#### Heloise to Abelard

<span class="margnote">The inconstancy of Heloise</span>DEAR
ABELARD,--YOU expect, perhaps, that I should accuse you of negligence.
You have not answered my last letter, and thanks to Heaven, in the
condition I am now in it is a relief to me that you show so much
insensibility for the passion which I betrayed. At last, Abelard, you
have lost Heloise for ever. Notwithstanding all the oaths I made to
think of nothing but you, and to be entertained by nothing but you, I
have banished you from my thoughts, I have forgot you. Thou charming
idea of a lover I once adored, thou wilt be no more my happiness! Dear
image of Abelard! thou wilt no longer follow me, no longer shall I
remember thee. O celebrity and merit of that man who, in spite of  his
enemies, is the wonder of the age! O enchanting pleasures to which
Heloise resigned herself--you, you have been my tormentors! I confess my
inconstancy, Abelard, without a blush; let my infidelity teach the world
that there is no depending on the promises of women--we are all subject
to change. This troubles you, Abelard; this news without surprises you;
you never imagined Heloise could be inconstant. She was prejudiced by
such a strong inclination towards you that you cannot conceive how Time
could alter it. But be undeceived, I am going to disclose

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

<span class="margnote">Divine Love conquers</span>to you my falseness,
though, instead of reproaching me, I persuade myself you will shed tears
of joy. When I tell you what Rival hath ravished my heart from you, you
will praise my inconstancy, and pray this Rival to fix it. By this you
will know that ’tis God alone that takes Heloise from you. Yes, my dear
Abelard, He gives my mind that tranquillity which a vivid remembrance of
our misfortunes formerly forbade. Just Heaven! what other rival could
take me from you? Could you imagine it possible for a mere human to blot
you from my heart? Could you think me guilty of sacrificing the virtuous
and learned Abelard to any other but God? No, I believe you have done me
justice on this point. I doubt not you are eager to learn what means God
used to accomplish so great an end? I will tell you, that you may wonder
at the secret ways of Providence. Some few days after you sent me your
last letter I fell dangerously ill; the physicians gave me over, and I
expected certain death. Then it was that my passion, which always before
seemed innocent, grew criminal in my eyes. My memory represented
faithfully to me all the past actions of my life, and I confess to you
pain for our love was the only pain I felt. Death, which till then I had
only viewed from a distance, now presented itself to me as it appears to
sinners. I began to dread the wrath of God now I was near experiencing
it, and I repented that I had not better used the means of Grace. Those
tender letters I wrote to you, those fond conversations I have had with
you, give me as much pain now as they had formerly

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

<span class="margnote">She is repentant</span>given pleasure. 'Ah,
miserable Heloise!' I said, 'if it is a crime to give oneself up to such
transports, and if, after this life is ended, punishment certainly
follows them, why didst thou not resist such dangerous temptations?
Think on the tortures prepared for thee, consider with terror the store
of torments, and recollect, at the same time, those pleasures which thy
deluded soul thought so entrancing. Ah! dost thou not despair for having
rioted in such false pleasures?' In short, Abelard, imagine all the
remorse of mind I suffered, and you will not be astonished at my change.

Solitude is insupportable to the uneasy mind; its troubles increase in
the midst of silence, and retirement heightens them. Since I have been
shut up in these walls I have done nothing but weep our misfortunes.
This cloister has resounded with my cries, and, like a wretch condemned
to eternal slavery, I have worn out my days with grief. Instead of
fulfilling God's merciful design towards me I have offended against Him;
I have looked upon this sacred refuge as a frightful prison, and have
borne with unwillingness the yoke of the Lord. Instead of purifying
myself with a life of penitence I have confirmed my condemnation. What a
fatal mistake! But, Abelard, I have torn off the bandage which blinded
me, and, if I dare rely upon my own feelings, I have now made myself
worthy of your esteem, You are to me no more the loving Abelard who
constantly sought private conversations with me by deceiving the
vigilance of our observers. Our misfortunes gave

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

<span class="margnote">Further struggles</span>you a horror of vice, and
you instantly consecrated the rest of your days to virtue, and seemed to
submit willingly to the necessity. I indeed, more tender than you, and
more sensible to pleasure, bore misfortune with extreme impatience, and
you have heard my exclaimings against your enemies. You have seen my
resentment in my late letters; it was this, doubtless, which deprived me
of the esteem of my Abelard. You were alarmed at my repinings, and, if
the truth be told, despaired of my salvation. You could not foresee that
Heloise would conquer so reigning a passion; but you were mistaken,
Abelard, my weakness, when supported by grace, has not hindered me from
winning a complete victory. Restore me, then, to your esteem; your own
piety should solicit you to this.

But what secret trouble rises in my soul--what unthought-of emotion now
rises to oppose the resolution I have formed to sigh no more for
Abelard? Just Heaven! have I not triumphed over my love? Unhappy
Heloise! as long as thou drawest a breath it is decreed thou must love
Abelard. Weep, unfortunate wretch, for thou never hadst a more just
occasion. I ought to die of grief; grace had overtaken me and I had
promised to be faithful to it, but now am I perjured once more, and even
grace is sacrificed to Abelard. This sacrilege fills up the measure of
my iniquity. After this how can I hope that God will open to me the
treasure of His mercy, for I have tired out His forgiveness. I began to
offend Him from the first moment I saw Abelard; an unhappy sympathy
engaged us both in a guilty

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

<span class="margnote">She demands a letter</span>love, and God raised
us up an enemy to separate us. I lament the misfortune which lighted
upon us and I adore the cause. Ah! I ought rather to regard this
misfortune as the gift of Heaven, which disapproved of our engagement
and parted us, and I ought to apply myself to extirpate my passion. How
much better it were to forget entirely the object of it than to preserve
a memory so fatal to my peace and salvation? Great God! shall Abelard
possess my thoughts for ever? Can I never free myself from the chains of
love? But perhaps I am unreasonably afraid; virtue directs all my acts
and they are all subject to grace. Therefore fear not, Abelard; I have
no longer those sentiments which being described in my letters have
occasioned you so much trouble. I will no more endeavour, by the
relation of those pleasures our passion gave us, to awaken any guilty
fondness you may yet feel for me. I free you from all your oaths; forget
the titles of lover and husband and keep only that of father. I expect
no more from you than tender protestations and those letters so proper
to feed the flame of love. I demand nothing of you but spiritual advice
and wholesome discipline. The path of holiness, however thorny it be,
will yet appear agreeable to me if I may but walk in your footsteps. You
will always find me ready to follow you. I shall read with more pleasure
the letters in which you shall describe the advantages of virtue than
ever I did those in which you so artfully instilled the poison of
passion. You cannot now be silent without a crime. When I was possessed
with so violent a love, and pressed you so earnestly to write to me,

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="margnote">God holds her heart</span>how many letters did I
send you before I could obtain one from you? You denied me in my misery
the only comfort which was left me, because you thought it pernicious.
You endeavoured by severities to force me to forget you, nor do I blame
you; but now you have nothing to fear. This fortunate illness, with
which Providence has chastised me for my good, has done what all human
efforts and your cruelty in vain attempted. I see now the vanity of that
happiness we had set our hearts upon, as if it were eternal. What fears,
what distress have we not suffered for it!

No, Lord, there is no pleasure upon earth but that which virtue gives.
The heart amidst all worldly delights feels a sting; it is uneasy and
restless until fixed on Thee. What have I not suffered, Abelard, whilst
I kept alive in my retirement those fires which ruined me in the world?
I saw with hatred the walls that surrounded me; the hours seemed as long
as years. I repented a thousand times that I had buried myself here. But
since grace has opened my eyes all the scene is changed; solitude looks
charming, and the peace of the place enters my very heart. In the
satisfaction of doing my duty I feel a delight above all that riches,
pomp or sensuality could afford. My quiet has indeed cost me dear, for I
have bought it at the price of my love; I have offered a violent
sacrifice I thought beyond my power. But if I have torn you from my
heart, be not jealous; God, who ought always to have possessed it,
reigns there in your stead. Be content with having a place in my mind
which you shall never lose; I shall always take a secret

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

<span class="margnote">A letter arrives </span>pleasure in thinking of
you, and esteem it a glory to obey those rules you shall give me.

 

This very moment I receive a letter from you; I will read it and answer
it immediately. You shall see by my promptitude in writing to you that
you are always dear to me.

You very obligingly reproach me for delay in writing you any news; my
illness must excuse that. I omit no opportunities of giving you marks of
my remembrance. I thank you for the uneasiness you say my silence caused
you, and the kind fears you express concerning my health. Yours, you
tell me, is but weakly, and you thought lately you should have died.
With what indifference, cruel man, do you tell me a thing so certain to
afflict me? I told you in my former letter how unhappy I should be if
you died, and if you love me you will moderate the rigours of your
austere life. I represented to you the occasion I had for your advice,
and consequently the reason there was you should take care of
yourself;--but I will not tire you with repetitions. You desire us not
to forget you in our prayers: ah! dear Abelard, you may depend upon the
zeal of this society; it is devoted to you and you cannot justly fear
its forgetfulness. You are our Father, and we are your children; you are
our guide, and we resign ourselves to your direction with full assurance
in your piety. You command; we obey; we faithfully execute what you have
prudently ordered. We impose no penance on ourselves but what you
recommend, lest we should rather follow an indiscreet zeal than solid
virtue. In a word, nothing

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

<span class="margnote">The interior of a nunnery</span>is thought right
but what has Abelard's approbation. You tell me one thing that perplexes
me that you have heard that some of our Sisters are bad examples, and
that they are generally not strict enough. Ought this to seem strange to
you who know how monasteries are filled nowadays? Do fathers consult the
inclination of their children when they settle them? Are not interest
and policy their only rules? This is the reason that monasteries are
often filled with those who are a scandal to them. But I conjure you to
tell me what are the irregularities you have heard of, and to show me
the proper remedy for them. I have not yet observed any looseness: when
I have I will take due care. I walk my rounds every night and make those
I catch abroad return to their chambers; for I remember all the
adventures that happened in the monasteries near Paris.

You end your letter with a general deploring of your unhappiness and
wish for death to end a weary life. Is it possible so great a genius as
you cannot rise above your misfortunes? What would the world say should
they read the letters you send me? Would they consider the noble motive
of your retirement or not rather think you had shut yourself up merely
to lament your woes? What would your young students say, who come so far
to hear you and prefer your severe lectures to the ease of a worldly
life, if they should discover you secretly a slave to your passions and
the victim of those weaknesses from which your rule secures them? This
Abelard they so much admire, this great leader, would lose his fame and
become the sport of his pupils.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

<span class="margnote">Satan reproves sin</span>If these reasons are not
sufficient to give you constancy in your misfortune, cast your eyes upon
me, and admire the resolution with which I shut myself up at your
request. I was young when we separated, and (if I dare believe what you
were always telling me) worthy of any man's affections. If I had loved
nothing in Abelard but sensual pleasure, other men might have comforted
me upon my loss of him. You know what I have done, excuse me therefore
from repeating it; think of those assurances I gave you of loving you
still with the utmost tenderness. I dried your tears with kisses, and
because you were less powerful I became less reserved. Ah! if you had
loved with delicacy, the oaths I made, the transports I indulged, the
caresses I gave, would surely have comforted you. Had you seen me grow
by degrees indifferent to you, you might have had reason to despair, but
you never received greater tokens of my affection than after you felt
misfortune.

Let me see no more in your letters, dear Abelard, such murmurs against
Fate; you are not the only one who has felt her blows and you ought to
forget her outrages. What a shame it is that a philosopher cannot accept
what might befall any man. Govern yourself by my example; I was born
with violent passions, I daily strive with tender emotions, and glory in
triumphing and subjecting them to reason. Must a weak mind fortify one
that is so much superior? But I am carried away. Is it thus I write to
nay dear Abelard? He who practises all those virtues he preaches? If you
complain of Fortune,

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

<span class="margnote">Woman's weakness again conquers</span>it is not
so much that you feel her strokes as that you try to show your enemies
how much to blame they are in attempting to hurt you. Leave them,
Abelard, to exhaust their malice, and continue to charm your auditors.
Discover those treasures of learning Heaven seems to have reserved for
you; your enemies, struck with the splendour of your reasoning, will in
the end do you justice. How happy should I be could I see all the world
as entirely persuaded of your probity as I am. Your learning is allowed
by all; your greatest adversaries confess you are ignorant of nothing
the mind of man is capable of knowing.

My dear Husband (for the last time I use that title!), shall I never see
you again? Shall I never have the pleasure of embracing you before
death? What dost thou say, wretched Heloise? Dost thou know what thou
desirest? Couldst thou behold those brilliant eyes without recalling the
tender glances which have been so fatal to thee? Couldst thou see that
majestic air of Abelard without being jealous of everyone who beholds so
attractive a man? That mouth cannot be looked upon without desire; in
short, no woman can view the person of Abelard without danger. Ask no
more therefore to see Abelard; if the memory of him has caused thee so
much trouble, Heloise, what would not his presence do? What desires will
it not excite in thy soul? How will it be possible to keep thy reason at
the sight of so lovable a man?

I will own to you what makes the greatest pleasure in my retirement;
after having passed the day in thinking of you, full of the repressed

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="margnote">The delight of dreams</span>idea, I give myself
up at night to sleep. Then it is that Heloise, who dares not think of
you by day, resigns herself with pleasure to see and hear you. How my
eyes gloat over you! Sometimes you tell me stories of your secret
troubles, and create in me a felt sorrow; sometimes the rage of our
enemies is forgotten and you press me to you and I yield to you, and our
souls, animated with the same passion, are sensible of the same
pleasures. But O! delightful dreams and tender illusions, how soon do
you vanish away! I awake and open my eyes to find no Abelard: I stretch
out my arms to embrace him and he is not there; I cry, and he hears me
not. What a fool I am to tell my dreams to you who are insensible to
these pleasures. But do you, Abelard, never see Heloise in your sleep?
How does she appear to you? Do you entertain her with the same tender
language as formerly, and are you glad or sorry when you awake? Pardon
me, Abelard, pardon a mistaken lover. I must no longer expect from you
that vivacity which once marked your every action; no more must I
require from you the correspondence of desires. We have bound ourselves
to severe austerities and must follow them at all costs. Let us think of
our duties and our rules, and make good use of that necessity which
keeps us separate. You, Abelard, will happily finish your course; your
desires and ambitions will be no obstacle to your salvation. But Heloise
must weep, she must lament for ever without being certain whether all
her tears will avail for her salvation.

I had liked to have ended my letter without

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="margnote">She craves his presence</span>telling you what
happened here a few days ago. A young nun, who had been forced to enter
the convent without a vocation therefor, is by a stratagem I know
nothing of escaped and fled to England with a gentleman. I have ordered
all the house to conceal the matter. Ah, Abelard! if you were near us
these things would not happen, for all the Sisters, charmed with seeing
and hearing you, would think of nothing but practising your rules and
directions. The young nun had never formed so criminal a design as that
of breaking her vows had you been at our head to exhort us to live in
holiness. If your eyes were witnesses of our actions they would be
innocent. When we slipped you should lift us up and establish us by your
counsels; we should march with sure steps in the rough path of virtue. I
begin to perceive, Abelard, that I take too much pleasure in writing to
you; I ought to burn this letter. It shows that I still feel a deep
passion for you, though at the beginning I tried to persuade you to the
contrary. I am sensible of waves both of grace and passion, and by turns
yield to each. Have pity, Abelard, on the condition to which you have
brought me, and make in some measure my last days as peaceful as my
first have been uneasy and disturbed.
