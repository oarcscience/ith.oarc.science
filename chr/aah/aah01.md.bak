*The Love Letters of Abelard and Heloise*, \[1901\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="page_i">p. i</span>

The letters of Abelard and Heloise were written in Latin about the year
1128, and were first published in Paris in 1616. The 'Letters' appeared
first in England in 1728 in their original Latin, but thereafter
translations were numerous, the anonymous one given here being published
in 1722. It is rather a paraphrase than a translation, but by its
swiftness and sympathy best gives the spirit of the original. The story
of these illustrious lovers is told in their correspondence, but the
outline of their lives is briefly this:--Abelard, Professor of Logic and
Canon of Notre Dame, the most celebrated man of his day, being
thirty-seven years of age and having so far lived the life intellectual
and scorned the passions, meets Heloise, a beautiful and learned woman
of nineteen, and falls desperately in love--as only the late lover can.
Reason and religion are thrown to the winds; he would marry her, but she
loves with a devotion as mad as his, and marriage would arrest his
advancement in the Church, so she refuses yet gives him all. Her child
is born, and then Abelard insists on a secret marriage, but in her
unselfish infatuation she denies she is a wife and glories in the title
of mistress. Fulbert, her uncle and guardian, is furious; with hired
assistance he breaks into Abelard's chamber and brutally mutilates and
shames him. Abelard cannot bear the degradation; he has not the courage
to face his students, he has not the control to stay near Heloise; he
resolves to turn monk. But,

<span id="page_ii">p. ii</span>

manlike, he first demands that Heloise turn nun, in order that no other
may know the attractions he has enjoyed. Heloise willingly consents; she
being then twenty-two and he forty years of age. Ten years after, in her
convent, a letter of Abelard's falls into her hands; she learns he has
not found content, she knows she has not. She writes to Abelard
betraying all the pent-up passion of those years of restraint; he
replies in a letter alternating between religion and regret--not
accepting the inevitable, not daring to break free. Other four letters
pass, each less passionate than the previous, and then the silence falls
once more.

Abelard died in 1142 at the age of sixty-three, and twenty years later
Heloise died and was buried beside him. Subsequently their remains were
removed to Père Lachaise, where their tomb can now be seen.

And Abelard, the great leader and logician, his treatises are forgotten,
his fame as a philosopher is dead--only his love letters live.

And Heloise, the beautiful and the learned, who stands second to Sapho,
is known merely as an example of the passionate devotion of woman.

So they remain to us, the typical lovers; he with man's mania to master,
she with woman's one desire to submit.

No love letters that have ever been written but have contained phrases
common to one another and to be found here; but no love letters that
have ever been published have equalled these in the old passionate tale
of the struggle to forget--to sink the love of the human in the love of
the divine.
