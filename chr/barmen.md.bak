# **Theological Declaration of Barmen**

*Written by Karl Barth and the confessing church in Nazi Germany in
response to Hitler's national church. Its central doctrines concern the
sin of idolatry and the lordship of Christ*

## **I. An Appeal to the Evangelical Congregations and Christians in Germany**

<span id="01"></span>**8.01** **The Confessional Synod of the German
Evangelical Church met in Barmen, May 29-31, 1934. Here representatives
from all the German Confessional Churches met with one accord in a
confession of the one Lord of the one, holy, apostolic Church. In
fidelity to their Confession of Faith, members of Lutheran, Reformed,
and United Churches sought a common message for the need and temptation
of the Church in our day. With gratitude to God they are convinced that
they have been given a common word to utter. It was not their intention
to found a new Church or to form a union. For nothing was farther from
their minds than the abolition of the confessional status of our
Churches. Their intention was, rather, to withstand in faith and
unanimity the destruction of the Confession of Faith, and thus of the
Evangelical Church in Germany. In opposition to attempts to establish
the unity of the German Evangelical Church by means of false doctrine,
by the use of force and insincere practices, the Confessional Synod
insists that the unity of the Evangelical Churches in Germany can come
only from the Word of God in faith through the Holy Spirit. Thus alone
is the Church renewed.  
**<span id="02"></span>**8.02** **Therefore the Confessional Synod calls
upon the congregations to range themselves behind it in prayer, and
steadfastly to gather around those pastors and teachers who are loyal to
the Confessions.  
**<span id="03"></span>**8.03** **Be not deceived by loose talk, as if
we meant to oppose the unity of the German nation! Do not listen to the
seducers who pervert our intentions, as if we wanted to break up the
unity of the German Evangelical Church or to forsake the Confessions of
the Fathers!  
**<span id="04"></span>**8.04** **Try the spirits whether they are of
God! Prove also the words of the Confessional Synod of the German
Evangelical Church to see whether they agree with Holy Scripture and
with the Confessions of the Fathers. If you find that we are speaking
contrary to Scripture, then do not listen to us! But if you find that we
are taking our stand upon Scripture, then let no fear or temptation keep
you from treading with us the path of faith and obedience to the Word of
God, in order that God's people be of one mind upon earth and that we in
faith experience what he himself has said: "I will never leave you, nor
forsake you." Therefore, "Fear not, little flock, for it is your
Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."**

## **II. Theological Declaration Concerning the Present Situation of the German Evangelical Church**

<span id="05"></span>**8.05** **According to the opening words of its
constitution of July 11, 1933, the German Evangelical Church is a
federation of Confessional Churches that grew our of the Reformation and
that enjoy equal rights. The theological basis for the unification of
these Churches is laid down in Article 1 and Article 2(1) of the
constitution of the German Evangelical Church that was recognized by the
Reich Government on July 14, 1933:**

-   **Article 1. The inviolable foundation of the German Evangelical
    Church is the gospel of Jesus Christ as it is attested for us in
    Holy Scripture and brought to light again in the Confessions of the
    Reformation. The full powers that the Church needs for its mission
    are hereby determined and limited.**
-   **Article 2 (1). The German Evangelical Church is divided into
    member Churches** ***Landeskirchen).***

<span id="06"></span>**8.06** **We, the representatives of Lutheran,
Reformed, and United Churches, of free synods, Church assemblies, and
parish organizations united in the Confessional Synod of the German
Evangelical Church, declare that we stand together on the ground of the
German Evangelical Church as a federation of German Confessional
Churches. We are bound together by the confession of the one Lord of the
one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.  
**<span id="07"></span>**8.07** **We publicly declare before all
evangelical Churches in Germany that what they hold in common in this
Confession is grievously imperiled, and with it the unity of the German
Evangelical Church. It is threatened by the teaching methods and actions
of the ruling Church party of the "German Christians" and of the Church
administration carried on by them. These have become more and more
apparent during the first year of the existence of the German
Evangelical Church. This threat consists in the fact that the
theological basis, in which the German Evangelical Church is united, has
been continually and systematically thwarted and rendered ineffective by
alien principles, on the part of the leaders and spokesmen of the
"German Christians" as well as on the part of the Church administration.
When these principles are held to be valid, then, according to all the
Confessions in force among us, the Church ceases to be the Church and th
German Evangelical Church, as a federation of Confessional Churches,
becomes intrinsically impossible.  
**<span id="08"></span>**8.08** **As members of Lutheran, Reformed, and
United Churches we may and must speak with one voice in this matter
today. Precisely because we want to be and to remain faithful to our
various Confessions, we may not keep silent, since we believe that we
have been given a common message to utter in a time of common need and
temptation. We commend to God what this may mean for the intrrelations
of the Confessional Churches.  
**<span id="09"></span>**8.09** **In view of the errors of the "German
Christians" of the present Reich Church government which are devastating
the Church and also therefore breaking up the unity of the German
Evangelical Church, we confess the following evangelical truths:**

<span id="10"></span>**8.10 -** **1. "I am the way, and the truth, and
the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me." (John 14.6). "Truly,
truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door,
but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. . . . I
am the door; if anyone enters by me, he will be saved." (John 10:1,
9.)  
**<span id="11"></span>**8.11** **Jesus Christ, as he is attested for us
in Holy Scripture, is the one Word of God which we have to hear and
which we have to trust and obey in life and in death.  
**<span id="12"></span>**8.12** **We reiect the false doctrine, as
though the church could and would have to acknowledge as a source of its
proclamation, apart from and besides this one Word of God, still other
events and powers, figures and truths, as God's revelation.**

<span id="13"></span>**8.13 -** **2. "Christ Jesus, whom God has made
our wisdom, our righteousness and sanctification and redemption." (1
Cor. 1:30.)  
**<span id="14"></span>**8.14** **As Jesus Christ is God's assurance of
the forgiveness of all our sins, so, in the same way and with the same
seriousness he is also God's mighty claim upon our whole life. Through
him befalls us a joyful deliverance from the godless fetters of this
world for a free, grateful service to his creatures.  
**<span id="15"></span>**8.15** **We reiect the false doctrine, as
though there were areas of our life in which we would not belong to
Jesus Christ, but to other lords--areas in which we would not need
justification and sanctification through him.**

<span id="16"></span>**8.16** **- 3. "Rather, speaking the truth in
love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into
Christ, from whom the whole body \[is\] joined and knit together." (Eph.
4:15,16.)  
**<span id="17"></span>**8.17** **The Christian Church is the
congregation of the brethren in which Jesus Christ acts presently as the
Lord in Word and sacrament through the Holy Spirit. As the Church of
pardoned sinners, it has to testify in the midst of a sinful world, with
its faith as with its obedience, with its message as with its order,
that it is solely his property, and that it lives and wants to live
solely from his comfort and from his direction in the expectation of his
appearance.  
**<span id="18"></span>**8.18** **We reject the false doctrine, as
though the Church were permitted to abandon the form of its message and
order to its own pleasure or to changes in prevailing ideological and
political convictions.**

<span id="19"></span>**8.19 -** **4. "You know that the rulers of the
Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men excercise authority over
them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you
must be your srvant." (Matt. 20:25,26.)  
**<span id="20"></span>**8.20** **The various offices in the Church do
not establish a dominion of some over the others; on the contrary, they
are for the excercise of the ministry entrusted to and enjoined upon the
whole congregation.  
**<span id="21"></span>**8.21** **We reject the false doctrine, as
though the Church, apart from this ministry, could and were permitted to
give itself, or allow to be given to it, special leaders vested with
ruling powers.**

<span id="22"></span>**8.22 -** **5. "Fear God. Honor the emperor." (1
Peter 2:17.)  
Scripture tells us that, in the as yet unredeemed world in which the
Church also exists, the State has by divine appointment the task of
providing for justice and peace. \[It fulfills this task\] by means of
the threat and exercise of force, according to the measure of human
judgment and human ability. The Church acknowledges the benefit of this
divine appointment in gratitude and reverence before him. It calls to
mind the Kingdom of God, God's commandment and righteousness, and
thereby the responsibility both of rulers and of the ruled. It trusts
and obeys the power of the Word by which God upholds all things.  
**<span id="23"></span>**8.23** **We reject the false doctrine, as
though the State, over and beyond its special commision, should and
could become the single and totalitarian order of human life, thus
fulfilling the Church's vocation as well.  
**<span id="24"></span>**8.24** **We reject the false doctrine, as
though the Church, over and beyond its special commission, should and
could appropriate the characteristics, the tasks, and the dignity of the
State, thus itself becoming an organ of the State.**

<span id="25"></span>**8.25** **- 6. "Lo, I am with you always, to the
close of the age." (Matt. 28:20.) "The word of God is not fettered." (2
Tim. 2:9.)  
**<span id="26"></span>**8.26** **The Church's commission, upon which
its freedom is founded, consists in delivering the message of th free
grace of God to all people in Christ's stead, and therefore in the
ministry of his own Word and work through sermon and sacrament.  
**<span id="27"></span>**8.27** **We reject the false doctrine, as
though the Church in human arrogance could place the Word and work of
the Lord in the service of any arbitrarily chosen desires, purposes, and
plans.  
**<span id="28"></span>**8.28** **The Confessional Synod of the German
Evangelical Church declares that it sees in the acknowledgment of these
truths and in the rejection of these errors the indispensable
theological basis of the German Evangelical Church as a federation of
Confessional Churches. It invites all who are able to accept its
declaration to be mindful of these theological principles in their
decisions in Church politics. It entreats all whom it concerns to return
to the unity of faith, love, and hope.**
