# The Corpus Hermeticum

The Corpus Hermeticum are the core documents of the Hermetic tradition.
Dating from early in the Christian era, they were mistakenly dated to a
much earlier period by Church officials (and everyone else) up until the
15th century. Because of this, they were allowed to survive and we seen
as an early precursor to what was to be Christianity. We know today that
they were, in fact, from the early Christian era, and came out of the
turbulent religious seas of Hellenic Egypt.

These are all taken from Mead's translations, which are in the public
domain at this point.
