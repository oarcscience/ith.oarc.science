<h3>translated by G.R.S. Mead</h3>

<h2>IX.  On Thought and Sense</h2>

<P>

&lt;This somewhat diffuse essay covers a series of topics, starting

with (and to some extent from) the concept that the set of perceptions

we call &quot;thoughts&quot; and the set we call &quot;sensory

perceptions&quot; are not significantly different from each other.

 The implications of this idea play a significant role in later

Hermetic thought, particularly in the areas of magic and the Art

of Memory; in this tractate, though, the issues involved are barely

touched, and the argument wanders into moral dualisms and the

equally important, but distinct, idea that the Cosmos is itself

a divine creative power.

<P>

&lt;Section 10, in which understanding is held up as the source

and precondition of belief, should probably be seen as part of

the same ancient debate on the roles of faith and reason that

gave rise to Tertullian's famous <I>credo</I> <I>quia</I> <I>absurdum</I>

(&quot;I believe because it is absurd&quot;). - JMG&gt;

<P>

1.  I gave the Perfect Sermon (Logos) yesterday, Asclepius; today

I think it right, as sequel thereunto, to go through point by

point the Sermon about Sense.

<P>

Now sense and thought do seem to differ, in that the former has

to do with matter, the latter has to do with substance.  But unto

me both seem to be at-one and not to differ - in men I mean. 

In other lives &lt;or living creatures&gt; sense is at-oned with

Nature, but in men thought.

<P>

Now mind doth differ just as much from thought as God doth from

divinity.  For that divinity by God doth come to be, and by mind

thought, the sister of the word (logos) and instruments of one

another.  For neither doth the word (logos) find utterance without

thought, nor is thought manifested without word.

<P>

2.  So sense and thought both flow together into man, as though

they were entwined with one another.  For neither without sensing

can one think, nor without thinking sense.

<P>

But it is possible [they say] to think a thing apart from sense,

as those who fancy sights in dreams.  But unto me it seems that

both of these activities occur in dream-sight, and sense doth

pass out of the sleeping to the waking state.

<P>

For man is separated into soul and body, and only when the two

sides of his sense agree together, does utterance of its thought

conceived by mind take place.

<P>

3.  For it is mind that doth conceive all thoughts - good thoughts

when it receives the seeds from God, their contraries when [it

receiveth them] from the daimonials; no part of Cosmos being free

of daimon, who stealthily doth creep into the daimon who's illumined

by God's light &lt;i.e., the human soul&gt;, and sow in him the

seed of its own energy.  

<P>

And mind conceives the seed thus sown, adultery, murder, parricide,

[and] sacrilege, impiety, [and] strangling, casting down precipices,

and all such other deeds as are the work of evil daimons.

<P>

4.  The seeds of God, 'tis true, are few, but vast and fair, and

good - virtue and self-control, devotion.  Devotion is God-gnosis;

and he who knoweth God, being filled with all good things, thinks

godly thoughts and not thoughts like the many [think].

<P>

For this cause they who Gnostic are, please not the many, nor

the many them.  They are thought mad and laughted at; they're

hated and despised, and sometimes even put to death.

<P>

For we did say that bad must needs dwell on earth, where 'tis

in its own place.  Its place is earth, and not Cosmos, as some

will sometimes say with impious tongue.

<P>

But he who is a devotee of God, will bear with all - once he has

sensed the Gnosis.  For such an one all things, e'en though they

be for others bad, are for him good; deliberately he doth refer

them all unto the Gnosis.  And, thing most marvelous, 'tis he

alone who maketh bad things good.

<P>

5.  But I return once more to the Discourse (Logos) on Sense.

 That sense doth share with thought in man, doth constitute him

man.  But 'tis not [every] man, as I have said, who benefits by

thought; for this man is material, that other one substantial.

<P>

For the material man, as I have said, [consorting] with the bad,

doth have his seed of thought from daimons; while the substantial

men [consorting] with the Good, are saved by God.

<P>

Now God is Maker of all things, and in His making, He maketh all

[at last] like to Himself; but they, while they're becoming good

by exercise of their activity, are unproductive things.

<P>

It is the working of the Cosmic Course that maketh their becomings

what they are, befouling some of them with bad and others of them

making clean with good.

<P>

For Cosmos, too, Asclepius, possesseth sense-and-thought peculiar

to itself, not like that of man; 'tis not so manifold, but as

it were a better and a simpler one.

<P>

6.  The single sense-and-thought of Cosmos is to make all things,

and make them back into itself again, as Organ of the Will of

God, so organized that it, receiving all the seeds into itself

from God, and keeping them within itself, may make all manifest,

and [then] dissolving them, make them all new again; and thus,

like a Good Gardener of Life, things that have been dissolved,

it taketh to itself, and giveth them renewal once again.

<P>

There is no thing to which it gives not life; but taking all unto

itself it makes them live, and is at the same time the Place of

Life and its Creator.

<P>

7.  Now bodies matter [-made] are in diversity.  Some are of earth,

of water some, some are of air, and some of fire.

<P>

But they are all composed; some are more [composite], and some

are simpler.  The heavier ones are more [composed], the lighter

less so.

<P>

It is the speed of Cosmos' Course that works the manifoldness

of the kinds of births.  For being a most swift Breath, it doth

bestow their qualities on bodies together with the One Pleroma

- that of Life.

<P>

8.  God, then, is Sire of Cosmos; Cosmos, of all in Cosmos.  And

Cosmos is God's Son; but things in Cosmos are by Cosmos.

<P>

And properly hath it been called Cosmos [Order]; for that it orders

all with their diversity of birth, with its not leaving aught

without its life, with the unweariedness of its activity, the

speed of its necessity, the composition of its elements, and order

of its creatures.

<P>

The same, then, of necessity and propriety should have the name

of Order.  

<P>

The sense-and-thought, then, of all lives doth come into them

from without, inbreathed by what contains [them all]; whereas

Cosmos receives them once for all together with its coming into

being, and keeps them as a gift from God.

<P>

9.  But God is not, as some suppose, beyond the reach of sense-and-thought.

 It is through superstition men thus impiously speak.

<P>

For all the things that are, Asclepius, all are in God, are brought

by God to be, and do depend on Him - both things that act through

bodies, and things that through soul-substance make [other things]

to move, and things that make things live by means of spirit,

and things that take unto themselves the things that are worn

out.

<P>

And rightly so; nay, I would rather say, He doth not have these

things; but I speak forth the truth, He is them all Himself. 

He doth not get them from without, but gives them out [from Him].

<P>

This is God's sense-and-thought, ever to move all things.  And

never time shall be when e'en a whit of things that are shall

cease; and when I say &quot;a whit of things that are&quot;, I

mean a whit of God.  For thigs that are, God hath; nor aught [is

there] without Him, nor [is] He without aught.

<P>

10.  These things should seem to thee, Asclepius, if thou dost

understand them, true; but if thou dost not understand, things

not to be believed.

<P>

To understand is to believe, to not believe is not to understand.

<P>

My word (logos) doth go before [thee] to the truth.  But mighty

is the mind, and when it hath been led by word up to a certain

point, it hath the power to come before [thee] to the truth.

<P>

And having thought o'er all these things, and found them consonant

with those which have already been translated by the reason, it

hath [e'en now] believed, and found its rest in that Fair Faith.

<P>

To those, then, who by God['s good aid] do understand the things

that have been said [by us] above, they're credible; but unto

those who understand them not, incredible.

<P>

Let so much, then, suffice on thought-and-sense.
