## IX. On Thought and Sense

&lt;This somewhat diffuse essay covers a series of topics, starting with
(and to some extent from) the concept that the set of perceptions we
call "thoughts" and the set we call "sensory perceptions" are not
significantly different from each other. The implications of this idea
play a significant role in later Hermetic thought, particularly in the
areas of magic and the Art of Memory; in this tractate, though, the
issues involved are barely touched, and the argument wanders into moral
dualisms and the equally important, but distinct, idea that the Cosmos
is itself a divine creative power.

&lt;Section 10, in which understanding is held up as the source and
precondition of belief, should probably be seen as part of the same
ancient debate on the roles of faith and reason that gave rise to
Tertullian's famous *credo* *quia* *absurdum* ("I believe because it is
absurd"). - JMG&gt;

1\. I gave the Perfect Sermon (Logos) yesterday, Asclepius; today I
think it right, as sequel thereunto, to go through point by point the
Sermon about Sense.

Now sense and thought do seem to differ, in that the former has to do
with matter, the latter has to do with substance. But unto me both seem
to be at-one and not to differ - in men I mean. In other lives &lt;or
living creatures&gt; sense is at-oned with Nature, but in men thought.

Now mind doth differ just as much from thought as God doth from
divinity. For that divinity by God doth come to be, and by mind thought,
the sister of the word (logos) and instruments of one another. For
neither doth the word (logos) find utterance without thought, nor is
thought manifested without word.

2\. So sense and thought both flow together into man, as though they
were entwined with one another. For neither without sensing can one
think, nor without thinking sense.

But it is possible \[they say\] to think a thing apart from sense, as
those who fancy sights in dreams. But unto me it seems that both of
these activities occur in dream-sight, and sense doth pass out of the
sleeping to the waking state.

For man is separated into soul and body, and only when the two sides of
his sense agree together, does utterance of its thought conceived by
mind take place.

3\. For it is mind that doth conceive all thoughts - good thoughts when
it receives the seeds from God, their contraries when \[it receiveth
them\] from the daimonials; no part of Cosmos being free of daimon, who
stealthily doth creep into the daimon who's illumined by God's light
&lt;i.e., the human soul&gt;, and sow in him the seed of its own energy.

And mind conceives the seed thus sown, adultery, murder, parricide,
\[and\] sacrilege, impiety, \[and\] strangling, casting down precipices,
and all such other deeds as are the work of evil daimons.

4\. The seeds of God, 'tis true, are few, but vast and fair, and good -
virtue and self-control, devotion. Devotion is God-gnosis; and he who
knoweth God, being filled with all good things, thinks godly thoughts
and not thoughts like the many \[think\].

For this cause they who Gnostic are, please not the many, nor the many
them. They are thought mad and laughted at; they're hated and despised,
and sometimes even put to death.

For we did say that bad must needs dwell on earth, where 'tis in its own
place. Its place is earth, and not Cosmos, as some will sometimes say
with impious tongue.

But he who is a devotee of God, will bear with all - once he has sensed
the Gnosis. For such an one all things, e'en though they be for others
bad, are for him good; deliberately he doth refer them all unto the
Gnosis. And, thing most marvelous, 'tis he alone who maketh bad things
good.

5\. But I return once more to the Discourse (Logos) on Sense. That sense
doth share with thought in man, doth constitute him man. But 'tis not
\[every\] man, as I have said, who benefits by thought; for this man is
material, that other one substantial.

For the material man, as I have said, \[consorting\] with the bad, doth
have his seed of thought from daimons; while the substantial men
\[consorting\] with the Good, are saved by God.

Now God is Maker of all things, and in His making, He maketh all \[at
last\] like to Himself; but they, while they're becoming good by
exercise of their activity, are unproductive things.

It is the working of the Cosmic Course that maketh their becomings what
they are, befouling some of them with bad and others of them making
clean with good.

For Cosmos, too, Asclepius, possesseth sense-and-thought peculiar to
itself, not like that of man; 'tis not so manifold, but as it were a
better and a simpler one.

6\. The single sense-and-thought of Cosmos is to make all things, and
make them back into itself again, as Organ of the Will of God, so
organized that it, receiving all the seeds into itself from God, and
keeping them within itself, may make all manifest, and \[then\]
dissolving them, make them all new again; and thus, like a Good Gardener
of Life, things that have been dissolved, it taketh to itself, and
giveth them renewal once again.

There is no thing to which it gives not life; but taking all unto itself
it makes them live, and is at the same time the Place of Life and its
Creator.

7\. Now bodies matter \[-made\] are in diversity. Some are of earth, of
water some, some are of air, and some of fire.

But they are all composed; some are more \[composite\], and some are
simpler. The heavier ones are more \[composed\], the lighter less so.

It is the speed of Cosmos' Course that works the manifoldness of the
kinds of births. For being a most swift Breath, it doth bestow their
qualities on bodies together with the One Pleroma - that of Life.

8\. God, then, is Sire of Cosmos; Cosmos, of all in Cosmos. And Cosmos
is God's Son; but things in Cosmos are by Cosmos.

And properly hath it been called Cosmos \[Order\]; for that it orders
all with their diversity of birth, with its not leaving aught without
its life, with the unweariedness of its activity, the speed of its
necessity, the composition of its elements, and order of its creatures.

The same, then, of necessity and propriety should have the name of
Order.

The sense-and-thought, then, of all lives doth come into them from
without, inbreathed by what contains \[them all\]; whereas Cosmos
receives them once for all together with its coming into being, and
keeps them as a gift from God.

9\. But God is not, as some suppose, beyond the reach of
sense-and-thought. It is through superstition men thus impiously speak.

For all the things that are, Asclepius, all are in God, are brought by
God to be, and do depend on Him - both things that act through bodies,
and things that through soul-substance make \[other things\] to move,
and things that make things live by means of spirit, and things that
take unto themselves the things that are worn out.

And rightly so; nay, I would rather say, He doth not have these things;
but I speak forth the truth, He is them all Himself. He doth not get
them from without, but gives them out \[from Him\].

This is God's sense-and-thought, ever to move all things. And never time
shall be when e'en a whit of things that are shall cease; and when I say
"a whit of things that are", I mean a whit of God. For thigs that are,
God hath; nor aught \[is there\] without Him, nor \[is\] He without
aught.

10\. These things should seem to thee, Asclepius, if thou dost
understand them, true; but if thou dost not understand, things not to be
believed.

To understand is to believe, to not believe is not to understand.

My word (logos) doth go before \[thee\] to the truth. But mighty is the
mind, and when it hath been led by word up to a certain point, it hath
the power to come before \[thee\] to the truth.

And having thought o'er all these things, and found them consonant with
those which have already been translated by the reason, it hath \[e'en
now\] believed, and found its rest in that Fair Faith.

To those, then, who by God\['s good aid\] do understand the things that
have been said \[by us\] above, they're credible; but unto those who
understand them not, incredible.

Let so much, then, suffice on thought-and-sense.
