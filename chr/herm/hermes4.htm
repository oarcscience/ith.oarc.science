<h2>The Corpus Hermeticum</h2>







<h3>translated by G.R.S. Mead</h3>







<h2>IV.  The Cup or Monad</h2>



&lt;This short text gives an unusually lucid overview of the foundations



of Hermetic thought.  The stress on rejection of the body and



its pleasures, and on the division of humanity into those with



Mind and those without, are reminiscent of some of the so-called



&quot;Gnostic&quot; writings of the same period.  The idea that



the division is a matter of choice, on the other hand, is a pleasant



variation on the almost Calvinist flavor of writings such as the



<I>Apocalypse</I> <I>of</I> <I>Adam</I>.  



<P>



&lt;Mead speculates that the imagery of the Cup in this text may



have a distant connection, by way of unorthodox ideas about Communion,



with the legends of the Holy Grail. - JMG&gt;



<P>



1.  Hermes:  With Reason (Logos), not with hands, did the World-maker



make the universal World; so that thou shouldst think of him as



everywhere and ever-being, the Author of all things, and One and



Only, who by His Will all beings hath created.



<P>



This Body of Him is a thing no man can touch, or see, or measure,



a body inextensible, like to no other frame.  'Tis neither Fire



nor Water, Air nor Breath; yet all of them come from it.  Now



being Good he willed to consecrate this [Body] to Himself alone,



and set its Earth in order and adorn it.



<P>



2.  So down [to Earth] He sent the Cosmos of this Frame Divine



- man, a life that cannot die, and yet a life that dies.  And



o'er [all other] lives and over Cosmos [too], did man excel by



reason of the Reason (Logos) and the Mind.  For contemplator of



God's works did man become; he marvelled and did strive to know



their Author.



<P>



3.  Reason (Logos) indeed, O Tat, among all men hath He distributed,



but Mind not yet; not that He grudgeth any, for grudging cometh



not from Him, but hath its place below, within the souls of men



who have no Mind.



<P>



Tat:  Why then did God, O father, not on all bestow a share of



Mind?



<P>



H:  He willed, my son, to have it set up in the midst for souls,



just as it were a prize.



<P>



4.  T:  And where hath He set it up?



<P>



H:  He filled a mighty Cup with it, and sent it down, joining



a Herald [to it], to whom He gave command to make this proclamation



to the hearts of men:



<P>



Baptize thyself with this Cup's baptism, what heart can do so,



thou that hast faith thou canst ascend to him that hath sent down



the Cup, thou that dost know for what thoudidst come into being!



<P>



As many then as understood the Herald's tidings and doused themselves



in Mind, became partakers in the Gnosis; and when they had &quot;received



the Mind&quot; they were made &quot;perfect men&quot;.



<P>



But they who do not understand the tidings, these, since they



possess the aid of Reason [only] and not Mind, are ignorant wherefor



they have come into being and whereby.



<P>



5.  The senses of such men are like irrational creatures'; and



as their [whole] make-up is in their feelings and their impulses,



they fail in all appreciation of &lt;lit.:  &quot;they do not



wonder at&quot;&gt; those things which really are worth contemplation.



 These center all their thought upon the pleasures of the body



and its appetites, in the belief that for its sake man hath come



into being.



<P>



But they who have received some portion of God's gift, these,



Tat, if we judge by their deeds, have from Death's bonds won their



release; for they embrace in their own Mind all things, things



on the earth, things in the heaven, and things above the heaven



- if there be aught.  And having raised themselves so far they



sight the Good; and having sighted it, they look upon their sojourn



here as a mischance; and in disdain of all, both things in body



and the bodiless, they speed their way unto that One and Only



One.



<P>



6.  This is, O Tat, the Gnosis of the Mind, Vision of things Divine;



God-knowledge is it, for the Cup is God's.



<P>



T:  Father, I, too, would be baptized.



<P>



H:  Unless thou first shall hate thy Body, son, thou canst not



love thy Self.  But if thou lov'st thy Self thou shalt have Mind,



and having Mind thou shalt share in the Gnosis.



<P>



T:  Father, what dost thou mean?



<P>



H:  It is not possible, my son, to give thyself to both - I mean



to things that perish and to things divine.  For seeing that existing



things are twain, Body and Bodiless, in which the perishing and



the divine are understood, the man who hath the will to choose



is left the choice of one or the other; for it can never be the



twain should meet.  And in those souls to whom the choice is left,



the waning of the one causes the other's growth to show itself.



<P>



7.  Now the choosing of the Better not only proves a lot most



fair for him who makes the choice, seeing it makes the man a God,



but also shows his piety to God.  Whereas the [choosing] of the



Worse, although it doth destroy the &quot;man&quot;, it doth only



disturb God's harmony to this extent, that as processions pass



by in the middle of the way, without being able to do anything



but take the road from others, so do such men move in procession



through the world led by their bodies' pleasures.



<P>



8.  This being so, O Tat, what comes from God hath been and will



be ours; but that which is dependent on ourselves, let this press



onward and have no delay, for 'tis not God, 'tis we who are the



cause of evil things, preferring them to good.



<P>



Thou see'st, son, how many are the bodies through which we have



to pass, how many are the choirs of daimones, how vast the system



of the star-courses [through which our Path doth lie], to hasten



to the One and Only God.



<P>



For to the Good there is no other shore; It hath no bounds; It



is without an end; and for Itself It is without beginning, too,



though unto us it seemeth to have one - the Gnosis.



<P>



9.  Therefore to It Gnosis is no beginning; rather is it [that



Gnosis doth afford] to us the first beginning of its being known.



<P>



Let us lay hold, therefore, of the beginning. and quickly speed



through all [we have to pass].



<P>



`Tis very hard, to leave the things we have grown used to, which



meet our gaze on every side, and turn ourselves back to the Old



Old [Path].



<P>



Appearances delight us, whereas things which appear not make their



believing hard.



<P>



Now evils are the more apparent things, whereas the Good can never



show Itself unto the eyes, for It hath neither form nor figure.



<P>



Therefore the Good is like Itself alone, and unlike all things



else; or `tis impossible that That which hath no body should make



Itself apparent to a body.



<P>



10.  The &quot;Like's&quot; superiority to the &quot;Unlike&quot;



and the &quot;Unlike's&quot; inferiority unto the &quot;Like&quot;



consists in this:



<P>



The Oneness being Source and Root of all, is in all things as



Root and Source.  Without [this] Source is naught; whereas the



Source [Itself] is from naught but itself, since it is Source



of all the rest.  It is Itself Its Source, since It may have no



other Source.



<P>



The Oneness then being Source, containeth every number, but is



contained by none; engendereth every number, but is engendered



by no other one.



<P>



11.  Now all that is engendered is imperfect, it is divisible,



to increase subject and to decrease; but with the Perfect [One]


none of these things doth hold.  Now that which is increasable



increases from the Oneness, but succumbs through its own feebleness



when it no longer can contain the One.



<P>



And now, O Tat, God's Image hath been sketched for thee, as far



as it can be; and if thou wilt attentively dwell on it and observe



it with thine heart's eyes, believe me, son, thou'lt find the



Path that leads above; nay, that Image shall become thy Guide



itself, because the Sight [Divine] hath this peculiar [charm],



it holdeth fast and draweth unto it those who succeed in opening



their eyes, just as, they say, the magnet [draweth] iron.
