## The Corpus Hermeticum

### translated by G.R.S. Mead

## IV. The Cup or Monad

&lt;This short text gives an unusually lucid overview of the foundations
of Hermetic thought. The stress on rejection of the body and its
pleasures, and on the division of humanity into those with Mind and
those without, are reminiscent of some of the so-called "Gnostic"
writings of the same period. The idea that the division is a matter of
choice, on the other hand, is a pleasant variation on the almost
Calvinist flavor of writings such as the *Apocalypse* *of* *Adam*.

&lt;Mead speculates that the imagery of the Cup in this text may have a
distant connection, by way of unorthodox ideas about Communion, with the
legends of the Holy Grail. - JMG&gt;

1\. Hermes: With Reason (Logos), not with hands, did the World-maker
make the universal World; so that thou shouldst think of him as
everywhere and ever-being, the Author of all things, and One and Only,
who by His Will all beings hath created.

This Body of Him is a thing no man can touch, or see, or measure, a body
inextensible, like to no other frame. 'Tis neither Fire nor Water, Air
nor Breath; yet all of them come from it. Now being Good he willed to
consecrate this \[Body\] to Himself alone, and set its Earth in order
and adorn it.

2\. So down \[to Earth\] He sent the Cosmos of this Frame Divine - man,
a life that cannot die, and yet a life that dies. And o'er \[all other\]
lives and over Cosmos \[too\], did man excel by reason of the Reason
(Logos) and the Mind. For contemplator of God's works did man become; he
marvelled and did strive to know their Author.

3\. Reason (Logos) indeed, O Tat, among all men hath He distributed, but
Mind not yet; not that He grudgeth any, for grudging cometh not from
Him, but hath its place below, within the souls of men who have no Mind.

Tat: Why then did God, O father, not on all bestow a share of Mind?

H: He willed, my son, to have it set up in the midst for souls, just as
it were a prize.

4\. T: And where hath He set it up?

H: He filled a mighty Cup with it, and sent it down, joining a Herald
\[to it\], to whom He gave command to make this proclamation to the
hearts of men:

Baptize thyself with this Cup's baptism, what heart can do so, thou that
hast faith thou canst ascend to him that hath sent down the Cup, thou
that dost know for what thoudidst come into being!

As many then as understood the Herald's tidings and doused themselves in
Mind, became partakers in the Gnosis; and when they had "received the
Mind" they were made "perfect men".

But they who do not understand the tidings, these, since they possess
the aid of Reason \[only\] and not Mind, are ignorant wherefor they have
come into being and whereby.

5\. The senses of such men are like irrational creatures'; and as their
\[whole\] make-up is in their feelings and their impulses, they fail in
all appreciation of &lt;lit.: "they do not wonder at"&gt; those things
which really are worth contemplation. These center all their thought
upon the pleasures of the body and its appetites, in the belief that for
its sake man hath come into being.

But they who have received some portion of God's gift, these, Tat, if we
judge by their deeds, have from Death's bonds won their release; for
they embrace in their own Mind all things, things on the earth, things
in the heaven, and things above the heaven - if there be aught. And
having raised themselves so far they sight the Good; and having sighted
it, they look upon their sojourn here as a mischance; and in disdain of
all, both things in body and the bodiless, they speed their way unto
that One and Only One.

6\. This is, O Tat, the Gnosis of the Mind, Vision of things Divine;
God-knowledge is it, for the Cup is God's.

T: Father, I, too, would be baptized.

H: Unless thou first shall hate thy Body, son, thou canst not love thy
Self. But if thou lov'st thy Self thou shalt have Mind, and having Mind
thou shalt share in the Gnosis.

T: Father, what dost thou mean?

H: It is not possible, my son, to give thyself to both - I mean to
things that perish and to things divine. For seeing that existing things
are twain, Body and Bodiless, in which the perishing and the divine are
understood, the man who hath the will to choose is left the choice of
one or the other; for it can never be the twain should meet. And in
those souls to whom the choice is left, the waning of the one causes the
other's growth to show itself.

7\. Now the choosing of the Better not only proves a lot most fair for
him who makes the choice, seeing it makes the man a God, but also shows
his piety to God. Whereas the \[choosing\] of the Worse, although it
doth destroy the "man", it doth only disturb God's harmony to this
extent, that as processions pass by in the middle of the way, without
being able to do anything but take the road from others, so do such men
move in procession through the world led by their bodies' pleasures.

8\. This being so, O Tat, what comes from God hath been and will be
ours; but that which is dependent on ourselves, let this press onward
and have no delay, for 'tis not God, 'tis we who are the cause of evil
things, preferring them to good.

Thou see'st, son, how many are the bodies through which we have to pass,
how many are the choirs of daimones, how vast the system of the
star-courses \[through which our Path doth lie\], to hasten to the One
and Only God.

For to the Good there is no other shore; It hath no bounds; It is
without an end; and for Itself It is without beginning, too, though unto
us it seemeth to have one - the Gnosis.

9\. Therefore to It Gnosis is no beginning; rather is it \[that Gnosis
doth afford\] to us the first beginning of its being known.

Let us lay hold, therefore, of the beginning. and quickly speed through
all \[we have to pass\].

\`Tis very hard, to leave the things we have grown used to, which meet
our gaze on every side, and turn ourselves back to the Old Old \[Path\].

Appearances delight us, whereas things which appear not make their
believing hard.

Now evils are the more apparent things, whereas the Good can never show
Itself unto the eyes, for It hath neither form nor figure.

Therefore the Good is like Itself alone, and unlike all things else; or
\`tis impossible that That which hath no body should make Itself
apparent to a body.

10\. The "Like's" superiority to the "Unlike" and the "Unlike's"
inferiority unto the "Like" consists in this:

The Oneness being Source and Root of all, is in all things as Root and
Source. Without \[this\] Source is naught; whereas the Source \[Itself\]
is from naught but itself, since it is Source of all the rest. It is
Itself Its Source, since It may have no other Source.

The Oneness then being Source, containeth every number, but is contained
by none; engendereth every number, but is engendered by no other one.

11\. Now all that is engendered is imperfect, it is divisible, to
increase subject and to decrease; but with the Perfect \[One\] none of
these things doth hold. Now that which is increasable increases from the
Oneness, but succumbs through its own feebleness when it no longer can
contain the One.

And now, O Tat, God's Image hath been sketched for thee, as far as it
can be; and if thou wilt attentively dwell on it and observe it with
thine heart's eyes, believe me, son, thou'lt find the Path that leads
above; nay, that Image shall become thy Guide itself, because the Sight
\[Divine\] hath this peculiar \[charm\], it holdeth fast and draweth
unto it those who succeed in opening their eyes, just as, they say, the
magnet \[draweth\] iron.
