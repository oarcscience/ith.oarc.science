<H1>The Shakers</H1>
<P>The Shakers were a unique Christian group who fled persecution in England,
arriving in America in the 18th Century.
They believed that their founder, Ann Lee, was the second coming of Christ.
The Shakers believed that God had both male and female aspects, and practiced
equality of men and women at all levels in their organization.
They were one of the first churches in America to
integrate their congregations, involving both
Blacks and Native Americans from the very start.
Known for simple values, hard work, communal living and absolute celibacy,
the Shakers went into a long decline during the 20th Century.
They are only today represented by a few elders at one farm.
It is difficult not to be moved by their sincere belief
that any act, including dance, song, and even manual labor,
can be an act of worship. - <I>jbh</I>
