## HUMAN NATURE REVEALED IN POETRY

The Book of Job is a work of pure literature; it is a pastoral, it is a
novel, it is a philosophical treatise in the form of a dialogue, it is a
drama, and above all it is a poem. It is animated throughout by the very
spirit of poetry--it is indeed one of the greatest poems of the world.
As a pastoral, it deals with the land and possessions of a rich stock
farmer; as a novel, it contains incidents so interesting that, once
read, they are never forgotten; as philosophy, it deals with one of the
most important problems, the significance of pain, and leaves us where
all other treatises on this subject have left us, in the dark; as a
drama, it has action and talk, both so appealing that when it was
presented on the New York stage it had a long run; as poetry, it reaches
the highest elevations known to the human spirit, and loses itself in
the stars.

It has everything except one thing--love o' women. Curious, that a
narrative-pastoral-philo-sophical-dramatic-poem can be so thrilling
without making any use of the chief material for all these forms of
literature.

<span id="p.306">p.306</span>

It opens in the liveliest fashion, so lively that Goethe borrowed it for
the opening of *Faust.* Job had that combination of piety and wealth so
often exemplified in the town's leading citizen. He sought first the
kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these other things were
added unto him. Thus Satan sneered, as some of the ungodly do to-day,
whenever Job was held up as an illustration of religion. It is easy to
be good when you have plenty of money and good health--take these away
and faith in God will have wings like riches and fly.

So far as the problem of evil is concerned, it is interesting to notice
that Satan spent his time traveling, going freely hither and thither,
and was given a free hand. Thus the Spirit of Opposition, the Spirit of
Negation, the Super-Mischief-maker was and apparently is eternally busy,
and could point with pride to his solid accomplishments.

God and Satan fought for the soul of Job, as they fight for every human
being; apparently even the meanest is worth fighting for. No one has
ever got any further with the doctrine of predestination than the
coloured preacher who said, "God predestines man to be saved: the Devil
predestines man to be damned; and man has the casting vote."

Satan was allowed to try his technique on Job's prosperity and security.
Four servants came running in turn to Job, bringing him news of
disaster: the first spoke of robbers, who had destroyed property and
servants; the second, of lightning destroy-

<span id="p.307">p.307</span>

ing sheep and shepherds; the third, of three bands of marauders who
stole all the camels and killed their drivers; the fourth, of a cyclone
which destroyed the manor house and killed his seven sons.

Job received these four blows with that equanimity that accompanies only
the most steadfast faith. He worshipped God, who had given and taken
away: blessed be the name of the Lord.

When Satan appeared again before the Most High, he did not look like a
defeated antagonist; he was reminded that Job's piety had not been
lessened or stained by disaster. Satan suggested that there was one
thing that no faith could overcome--physical suffering. It will be
remembered that in *In Memoriam* we read,

> Be near me when the sensuous frame  
> Is rack'd with pangs that conquer trust,

It is unfortunate that just when faith should be brightest it is often
most dim--in times of bodily anguish. When the body is racked with pain,
religion should help to fortify the mind; but it is just then when
religious feeling is often dominated and driven from the field by
corporal discomfort. Shakespeare intimated that there was no philosophy
proof against toothache; and it is true that until a philosopher can get
the tooth fixed or removed, he is not likely to make any valuable
contribution to human thought. No saying is more vain than to say that
extreme pain stimulates and exalts the mind;

<span id="p.308">p.308</span>

it really stupefies one's thinking powers, and for the very simple
reason that pain is so all-pervading that there is no room in the mind
for anything else. Suddenly Job's portly body was embossed with boils;
he could neither stand, nor sit, nor lie down with any comfort. His wife
mocked his faith, and advised him to curse God and die. You see, don't
you, how far you have got with religion? Perhaps she wanted to get rid
of him. He must have been rather trying in the days of his health and
prosperity; for there is only one husband more exasperating than an
impatient one, and that is one who is patient. And what a sight he was
now! Job rebuked her sharply for blasphemy, told her that we receive
both good and evil from God, and must not expect continual fine weather.
Up to this moment he had uttered nothing in rebellion or in despair; and
it is just possible that his faith might have withstood even the boils
if his three friends had not taken it into their heads to visit and
console him. I say he might have triumphed over either the boils or the
friends; but the combination was too much, even for Job, and he cursed
his birthday. It was quite evident to the sufferer, as he saw the three
approaching, with their faces properly adjusted for sympathy, that there
was team-play here; they had evidently talked him over and made an
appointment to visit him. Had he known the poetry of Browning he might
have cried out to them:

<span id="p.309">p.309</span>

> Has some plague a longer lease,  
>     Proffering its help uncouth?  
> Can't one even die in peace?

He recognised them afar off, but he was so changed from the prosperous,
upstanding, hearty man that at first they did not know him; when his
identity finally became clear, they were so overcome as to be speechless
seven days and seven nights. His appearance must have produced a
terrific shock to silence such fluency as theirs.

The seven days of silence were broken by the voice of Job, who uttered a
noble psalm in praise of Death; his condition and the words springing
from it take us back to those two wonderful verses in Ecclesiasticus,
cited in a previous chapter--how bitter the thought of death is when one
is healthy and prosperous, how welcome when one is in anguish, and
especially when one "hath lost patience." Job exemplified this changing
attitude in the change of his own condition.

Eliphaz cleared his throat, and began somewhat doubtfully, "If we assay
to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?" He reminded Job that no man
was perfect, hence every one needs refinement by suffering; he advised
him not to despise the chastening of the Almighty, but to have faith
that he would come out of this trial a sounder and better man. But Job
answered that the arrows of the Almighty had pierced him; that he was in
such grief he longed

<span id="p.310">p.310</span>

believe that he was being punished for sin. He challenged Eliphaz to
point out wherein he had gone wrong.

Then Bildad the Shuhite spoke up, rather vaguely, it must be confessed:
he referred to history, as proving that the righteous prosper and the
wicked suffer, which, if he had known a little more history, he might
have urged with less assurance; he practically told Job to cheer up, for
he would surely be all right again, though he did not suggest when or
how.

To this Job made the reply that millions have made in suffering; how am
I to establish an intimate relation with the great God? Does He hold
court like a human judge, so that I can stand before Him and present my
case? How can I get a hearing? How can I be sure that He, who made
Arcturus, Orion, and the Pleiades, cares anything for me, any more than
I care for a worm? No, it is not because I have sinned that I am
punished; I don't know why I suffer so; all I want now is a little
respite before death, the end of consciousness, the end of pain.

> Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I
> had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!  
> I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been
> carried from the womb to the grave.  
> Are not my days few? Cease then, and let me alone, that I may take
> comfort a little,  
> Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness
> and the shadow of death;

<span id="p.311">p.311</span>

> A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death,
> without any order, and where the light is as darkness.

Many poets have attempted to express the idea of nothingness;
Shakespeare spoke of death's dateless night: Job, a distinguished man of
business, with definite plans for each day, calls the land of the dead a
place "without any order."

Then the third friend, Zophar the Naamathite, who had thus far kept
silent with great difficulty, burst out in a torrent of speech, hotly
condemning Job for self-righteousness. He called upon him to repent, and
all might yet be well. Who can know the infinite mind? who by searching
can find out God? Therefore, Job, I advise you to humble yourself in the
dust, put away your sins, and repent; then all will be forgiven, and you
will remember these boils only as a bad dream.

Job was decidedly irritated by the words of Zophar, and answered
sarcastically, "No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die
with you." (On the stage this line was spoken with such an indescribable
tone of mingled wrath, impatience, and suffering that the audience burst
out in uncontrollable laughter.) He went on to say that he too was not
devoid of understanding; compared with God, he was nothing; but compared
with his three friends, he felt no inferiority in intellect; my
neighbours are mocking me; it is easy to talk when you are feeling fine
yourself.

<span id="p.312">p.312</span>

> But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.  
> O that ye would altogether hold your peace, and it should be your
> wisdom.

The fact is that God does not need such persons as you to speak in His
behalf; you cannot understand His ways; He does not always punish the
wicked, and help the good. There is no formula.

The truth is that life is nothing but vanity and sorrow, as meaningless
as death. Then out of the depths Job asks the eternal question: Is there
any better life than this miserable existence? Is there any reason for
hope in a life after death, where our dreams of perfection may reach
fulfillment? As the best answer to this question was made by Him who
spake as never man spake, I wish to place together question and
answer--the question in the fourteenth chapter of Job, the answer in the
fourteenth chapter of John. The answer is as refreshing as clear water
to thirst, as healing balm to a painful wound.

### THE QUESTION

> Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.  
> He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a
> shadow, and continueth not. .....  
> For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout
> again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease......  
> But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and
> where is he?.....  
> If a man die, shall he live again?

<span id="p.313">p.313</span>

### THE ANSWER

> Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in
> me.  
> In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would
> have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

The three friends were neither silenced nor convinced by Job's speeches;
Eliphaz the Temanite began again, and said that Job had filled his belly
with the east wind. He declared that it was not only foolish but wicked
to ask questions of God, or to suggest that He was not dealing fairly by
the world. Like the other two, he could not get the idea of sin and
punishment out of his head, and rebuked the sufferer.

Job's original stock of patience was now quite exhausted. "Miserable
comforters are ye all." I appeal from you to my Witness in heaven; for
although my anguish comes from Him, He understands me, and you do not.
Your words are merely an addition to an already intolerable burden.

Bildad the Shuhite, having the sensitiveness that sometimes accompanies
vanity, sharply resented these amenities, and interrupted Job by telling
him to keep still and listen to words of wisdom. He then poured out
another diatribe on the wicked, predicting disaster for those who would
not repent. Job told Bildad that he ought to be ashamed of himself for
such talk, for it had no friendliness nor understanding. Can't you see
that while you are delivering these discourses, I am suffering horribly?

<span id="p.314">p.314</span>

> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of
> God hath touched me.

Then follows an interesting remark, which (as the late Professor Jastrow
pointed out) has been almost universally misunderstood. Job here appeals
from his contemporaries, who scorn him, to future time--indeed, to us in
the twentieth century --when some defender will appear who will do him
justice. Like many a man who suffers from misrepresentation, he appeals
to posterity. When he said, "I know that my Redeemer liveth," he
apparently was not referring to Christ nor to Jehovah; the word Redeemer
should have been translated defender--and Job means, if only my
suffering could be recorded in a book, some wise man in the future would
read it, and defend me against the reproaches of Eliphaz, Bildad, and
Zophar

> Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were printed in a
> book!  
> That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for
> ever!  
> For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the
> latter day upon the earth.

His pious wish has been fulfilled. We understand Job better, and the
homiletic fury of the three friends is almost as irritating to us as it
was to him.

While Professor Jastrow has done much to stimulate thought on this great
poem, he went altogether too far in reconstructing the work, in an
attempt to

<span id="p.315">p.315</span>

make it consistent. Who expects the lamentations of one who was in such
acute misery as Job to form a consistent doctrine or to maintain the
same attitude toward life and death? At times he speaks in utter
despair, and again with some hope, as any man would in changing moods.

Sometimes he believes in a future life, at other times not at all, as is
the way of fluctuating human opinion.

Zophar the Naamathite, like a bird with one tune, poured some more hot
words into the wicked, who, he informed Job, might triumph temporarily,
but in the end would receive their deserts. Look out.

Job replied, in the tone of a man who knows that what he will say will
produce no conviction, yet must speak.

> Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.

He said that while it was true that some of the wicked suffered, some of
them did not; if you will look on life as it is, without any
preconceived theory, you will see that your explanation of human
suffering does not fit the facts. In this speech Job really took the
same position as that declared many years later by our Lord: He sendeth
His rain on the just and on the unjust.

Eliphaz, however, resembled many philosophers in loving his theory more
than the truth. He told Job to look back over his entire career, and he
would

<span id="p.316">p.316</span>

certainly remember many things he had done which were not right; *hinc
illæ lachrimæ.*

Ah, said Job, if only I knew where I might find God, to be as sure of
Him as you are; if only I could ask Him a few questions, and know the
explanation of life I The world is full of evil, and God permits
murderers and adulterers to live. If I were God, I might know why.

Bildad, whose ammunition was nearly all exhausted, here fired a shot
aimed apparently at no target; man, he said, must not attempt to justify
himself. Job then made a very long speech, full of disconnected remarks,
many of which contain beautiful figures of speech, but have little to do
with the argument. He talks like a man who is afraid to stop for fear
his antagonist will begin again, and he had rather talk than listen. He
reviewed his former happy life, and contrasted it with his present
wretched state.

When he finished, it was Zophar's turn; but he said nothing. Perhaps he
was asleep. Job's speech was very long.

But there was a young man, Elihu the Buzite, who had been listening, and
was by this time angry with both sides; with Job, because he had
attempted to justify himself, and with the three comforters, because
they were silenced; really, however, he was angry because he had been
bursting with repressed rhetoric, and had not got a chance to put in a
word. He released a flood of talk--his conceit, so charac-

<span id="p.317">p.317</span>

teristic of the younger generation, is downright funny.

> I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.  
> For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.  
> Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst
> like new bottles.  
> I will speak, that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer.

He was in terror lest Job should interrupt him before he got through;
never was there a man who more loved to hear himself talk. After he had
been pouring out a steady torrent of words, it is evident that Job made
an attempt to speak, and Elihu cried hastily:

> Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.  
> If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to
> justify thee.  
> If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee
> wisdom.

Job was too amazed to speak, and Elihu went on endlessly, until he had
exhausted not only the patience of Job, but the patience of God.

The wind of Elihu had brought on a whirlwind, and out of the storm came
a great Voice, with language majestic and divine:

> Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?  
> Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and
> answer thou me.

<span id="p.318">p.318</span>

> Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if
> thou hast understanding......  
> Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened, or who laid the corner
> stone thereof;  
> When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted
> for joy?  
> Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had
> issued out of the womb?  
> When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a
> swaddlingband for it,  
> And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,  
> And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy
> proud waves be stayed......  
> Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands
> of Orion?  
> Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide
> Arcturus with his sons?.....  
> Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with
> thunder?  
> Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils
> is terrible.  
> He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to
> meet the armed men.  
> He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back
> from the sword.  
> The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the
> shield.  
> He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth
> he that it is the sound of the trumpet.  
> He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar
> off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting......

This glorious poetry, setting forth the wonders of the earth, and of the
starry heavens, indicated the

<span id="p.319">p.319</span>

distance between the mind of man and the mind of God. Job, who had
maintained an attitude of defiance to his three friends, and doubtless
an attitude of bewilderment to Elihu, now humbled himself in the
presence of the works of God. "I abhor myself, and repent in dust and
ashes."

Eliphaz and his two friends received a merited rebuke from the divine
voice, and were informed that their wisdom was all foolishness; but Job
would pray for them, that their presumption might be forgiven. They were
sadder and wiser for this experience, and prepared a burnt offering.

Job forgave them, and it is pleasant to observe that at the moment when
he prayed for his old friends, his boils left him, and he was clean.
Prosperity returned to him abundantly, his sons grew apace, and his
daughters were the fairest women in the land. He lived one hundred and
forty years after his memorable misfortune, and greeted his
great-grandchildren.

What Satan thought of all this is not recorded; but the problem of evil
is left just where it was before the discussion, just where every
philosopher leaves it when he has said his last word.

The Song of Songs, called Solomon's Song, is a collection of passionate
Eastern lyrics dealing with love, courtship and marriage. It is rather
curious that this very human poem, with its frank expression of desire
and longing, should ever have been given a

<span id="p.320">p.320</span>

spiritual interpretation. It is like a garden; it has the roses of love
and the weeds of jealousy.

The main theme is the worship of bodily beauty; the richly ornamental
and odorous words take the form of a duet, in which the maiden and the
man sing alternately in praise of the other's charms. The girl looks
shyly out through the lattice and sees with adoration the approaching
figure of her lover running to meet her, full of vigour, agility and
grace. He is like a young hart, leaping on the mountains. To the
passionate eyes of the man, the maiden is as a fair lily among thistles,
and he takes delight in her slender, supple sweetness.

Journeys end in lovers meeting; it is the union of youth in springtime.
Surely no song to the freshness of spring ever surpassed this:

> For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;  
> The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is
> come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;  
> The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the
> tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come
> away......  
> My beloved is mine, and I am his; he feedeth among the lilies.

The Song celebrates not only the joy and glory of Love and Beauty, but
also the Terror--for Love and Beauty may be as terrible as they are
sweet.

> Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear
> as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners? .....

<span id="p.321">p.321</span>

> Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love
> is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof
> are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.  
> Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a
> man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would
> utterly be contemned.

The Book of Psalms contains one hundred and fifty lyrical poems. A true
lyric should have three distinct qualities--brevity, melody, unity. By
its very nature it must be brief; we can enjoy a long narrative or
descriptive poem, but a long lyric would be as intolerable as a long
tune. A lyrical poem should be fluently musical, singing spontaneously;
and it should as a rule represent only one mood. This mood may not be
characteristic of the author's usual mental attitude, but it is his
feeling at the time when he finds relief in expression.

The one apparent exception to the rule of brevity is Psalm CXIX; but
that is a group of songs, rather than one.

Divine lyrics have never reached a loftier height than in the Psalms,
which is the greatest Hymn Book in the world. Almost every human
emotion-- except the love of man and woman--is represented. In this
correspondence with God there is an intimate revelation of the human
heart, a marvellous confessional. There are songs of joy, triumph, hate,
rage, fear, repentance, remorse, praise, adoration, ecstasy, and
despair. There is the fierce tumult of battle, there is the quiet tone
of serene meditation. The

<span id="p.322">p.322</span>

works of nature are the handiwork of God; there is the glory of the
morning, the glory of the evening, and the glory of the stars. Often the
writer sings as intimately and unrestrainedly as though he were alone
with God.

There are only six verses in the Twenty-third Psalm, but who can
estimate the range and extent of their heart-strengthening influence?
Thousands and thousands have gone through pain, sorrow, humiliation, and
death with these immortal words on their lips. They have literally
restored the soul of sufferers. In the universality of their import and
application they belong to all people and all time.

> The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.  
> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the
> still waters.  
> He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for
> his name's sake.  
> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
> fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort
> me.  
> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou
> anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  
> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and
> I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

Those who are not religious, who never think of religion subjectively,
have no more idea of the reality of religious passion than those who
have never been in love have a conception of the power of love; they
understand the ardour of religion as a deaf man understands music and a
man born blind ap-

<span id="p.323">p.323</span>

preciates a sunset. In Psalm XLII the poet expresses a feeling instantly
understood by some, and meaningless to others:

> As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after
> thee, O God.  
> My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and
> appear before God?

The innumerable hosts of those who have lived the life of the spirit and
found in that life solid and unshakable security feel in their hearts an
echo to the majestic opening of the Forty-sixth Psalm:

> God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.  
> Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though
> the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;  
> Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains
> shake with the swelling thereof.

In recent times, up to the year of grace 1914, many godly people were
troubled by the so-called imprecatory psalms, where the poets called on
God to torture, crush, and annihilate their enemies; these psalms were
written by fighters, who hated their enemies and believed that their
personal enemies were the enemies of righteousness. They therefore
called loudly for divine vengeance, and rejoiced in their foes'
discomfiture and ruin. I say that these poems were prudently omitted
from pulpit reading, as it was felt that in modern and more peaceful
days we had outgrown such rancorous hostility, or at all events that we
ought to have done so. But when I remember the language used in the
pulpits of some

<span id="p.324">p.324</span>

American churches during the World War, I find it very easy to
understand the mood of the cursing psalms, and I find it impossible to
take toward those hymns of hate a superior attitude; for surely the
twentieth century, as often represented by official religion, was in
precisely the same frame of mind. Human nature at any critical moment
may burst through the confining garments of culture, education, and
religion, as an angry man throws off restraint.

This is the vigorous fashion in which the Psalmist preached in time of
war; of course he believed that his own advancement and that of the
Kingdom of God were firmly united; it was a holy war:

> They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against
> me without a cause......  
> Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.  
> Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek
> their bread also out of their desolate places.  
> Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers
> spoil his labour.  
> Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any
> to favour his fatherless children.  
> Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let

> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord; and let
> not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

On the night of 22 January, 1922, a clergyman in Leeds, England, made a
sensation by announcing that this Psalm, CIX, would henceforth be
expurgated from the service; he added that he would like

<span id="p.325">p.325</span>

also to remove Psalms XXXV and LXIX, on the ground that all three were
unchristian. They are certainly unchristian, but they are not unnatural.
The clergyman said, "No one has been able to explain the curses in the
Psalms and they represent human nature at its very worst." Well, they
represented human nature very well not only in David's time, but in
1914-18, and expressed a common feeling.

For solemn grandeur there is perhaps no poem in literature superior to
the Ninetieth Psalm, believed to be one of the oldest in the book, and
formerly ascribed to Moses. It could not have been written by Moses, I
suppose, because it speaks of the age of man, seventy years with an
occasional extension to eighty, as being normal; whereas in the early
days of Jewish history a much longer life was often recorded, Moses
himself dying at the age of one hundred and twenty.

The comparison of the eternal Present of God with the transient hills,
and with the swift change from future to past in the life of men, is
overwhelming in its stern dignity of expression. We think in hours and
days, measurements adapted to our range; with Him a thousand years are
but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. This
psalm is like a symphony, beginning sonorously, then descending into a
mournful adagio, and closing jubilantly.

I suppose there could not be a more well-worn

<span id="p.326">p.326</span>

platitude than to say that life is short; but in our philosophical
thinking we actually do forget the relativity of measurement. We measure
cloth by yards, but the astronomer measures by light-years; if with God
a thousand years are as a watch in the night, why are we so confident as
to the goodness or the badness of the world? If a man thinks in
centuries, his view is surely different from that of a child, who thinks
only of to-day; how about One who thinks in terms of eternity?

On the other hand, the literature of melancholy is too much obsessed
with the shortness of life; compared with the life of a California tree,
human existence on earth is short indeed; but it is really long enough
to enjoy greatly and to suffer greatly; long enough to do much good and
much evil; long enough to learn some things well; in many strange
characters, long enough to be tired of it; long enough for ennui. For
there are many who would kill time, and there are occasions when to the
most active mind an hour seems long.

Life may be short, as many who have wasted it find out at its close; but
certainly most of us live as long as we deserve.

Hell was the first important element in theology to become discredited
in modern thought; there are, of course, many who still believe in hell,
but the majority of Protestant Christians probably do not. With the
extinction of this flame, the fear of a future life, the dread of
something after death, van-

<span id="p.327">p.327</span>

ished; the future life has ceased to terrify most intelligent persons.
But with the fear of the future banished, the hope of the future began
to grow weak; the material expansion of modern life, followed by the
World War, which calamity had a disastrous effect on religious
faith--how disastrous no one now can tell--drove out of the minds of
many people the hope of existence after death. The result is that there
are now probably a larger number of people who have no belief in a
future life than have ever existed hitherto; thus we see all about us
to-day a common attitude toward this present life that can best be
characterised by the word *greedy.*

Everyone seems to be afraid he will miss something ; this is the last
drink, youth is fleeting, opportunity will not knock again. We behold an
all but universal mad rush for "happiness," with little care for cost or
consequences.

To a student of human nature, it is always interesting to see how the
same premise will in different minds be followed by opposite
conclusions. Omar Khayyam never had so many followers as now; life is
short, therefore eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. But there are
other men who, with the same prospect, come to precisely opposite ways
of conduct. Life is short, therefore do as much good as possible; life
is short, therefore do as much permanent work as possible, for to-morrow
we die. The night cometh, when no man can work.

The gallant knight, Harry Hotspur, spoke as follows:

<span id="p.328">p.328</span>

> O gentlemen, the time of life is short;  
> To spend that shortness basely were too long,  
> If life did ride upon a dial's point,  
> Still ending at the arrival of an hour.

Theodore Roosevelt, the American Hotspur, in a letter to Bellamy Storer,
wrote:

> We have got but one life here, and what comes after it we cannot with
> certainty tell; but it pays, no matter what comes after it, to try and
> do things, to accomplish things in this life, and not merely to have a
> soft and pleasant time.

Psalm CIV is a swelling chorus of praise to God, in which the individual
voices, earth and sky and sea, with beasts and birds and fishes, combine
in majestic harmonies:

> O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and
> majesty.  
> Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who stretchest out
> the heavens like a curtain:  
> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the
> clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind......  
> He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
> hills......  
> By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which
> sing among the branches......  
> He appointeth the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.  
> Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the
> forest do creep forth.  
> The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.  
> The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in
> their dens.

<span id="p.329">p.329</span>

> Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.  
> O Lord, how manifold are thy works; in wisdom hast thou made them all:
> the earth is full of Thy riches.  
> So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
> innumerable, both small and great beasts.  
> There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to
> play therein......  
> The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in
> his works.  
> He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and
> they smoke.  
> I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my
> God while I have my being.  
> My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the Lord.

In every man's heart there is the love of his native land; and this
passion is never so strong as when he is in a far country, for the bonds
that unite him to his home are elastic, pulling harder as the distance
increases. Nor does anyone love his country so much as when it has been
defeated in war; victorious people are proud of their nation, and of
their nation's flag; but their pride is not so strong as the passionate
love of country among those that have been overthrown and cast down.
Imagine yourself, if you can, an exile, a captive in a strange, hostile,
and powerful land, suddenly seeing your own country's flag, or hearing
its national song. Your feelings could never find better expression than
in the Psalm CXXXVII:

<span id="p.330">p.330</span>

> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we
> remembered Zion.  
> We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.  
> For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and
> they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the
> songs of Zion.  
> How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?  
> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.  
> If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my
> mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

The true mystic believes that the Divine Presence is all about him; that
man's search for God does not compare in eager intensity with God's
search for man. For there are those who seek God in vain, when all that
is needed is surrender. Children do not go out looking for their
parents; they go out sometimes trying vainly to escape from the
all-embracing, searching parental love. If the appearance of Jesus
Christ on earth means anything, it means that the love of God is
pursuing the flying heart of man. The great poet, Francis Thompson,
expressed this fundamental religious idea in his extraordinary
masterpiece, *The Hound of Heaven;* but even his genius does not compare
in truth and beauty with the inspiration and language of the one hundred
and thirty-ninth Psalm:

> O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.  
> Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou un-derstandest my
> thought afar off.  
> Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all
> my ways.

<span id="p.331">p.331</span>

> For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it
> altogether.  
> Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.  
> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high; I cannot attain
> unto it.  
> Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy
> presence?  
> If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell,
> behold, thou art there.  
> If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts
> of the sea;  
> Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.

In the book of the prophet Isaiah, we find not only the heights of
poetry--both sublimity and tenderness--we find a revelation of the
wickedness of human nature and the only remedy. In the very first
chapter there is a hearty condemnation of mere church-going, formal
prayers, hollow ritualistic observances, days and times of sacrifice;
what is needed is regeneration, a new heart. It is an interesting
comment on human nature that every truly great religious teacher has
found it necessary to attack the leaders of formal religion. Everything
that man touches seems sooner or later to become debased, and religion
is no exception; instead of renewing ourselves day by day, our worship
and prayers become mechanical, and so, instead of a life-giving force in
our hearts, we carry a useless burden.

A terrible expression is used here--the Lord is *bored* by our worship
of Him. "They are a trouble

<span id="p.332">p.332</span>

unto me; I am weary to bear them. And when ye spread forth your hands, I
will hide mine eyes from you." If it is tiresome to hear a dull,
mechanical sermon for half an hour, think what the Divine patience must
be to hear all the prayers, hymns, and modes of worship! Apparently
sinners do not begin to exhaust His patience so much as monotonous
lip-service.

Remember, in the following passage Isaiah is speaking to the orthodox:

> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before
> mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve
> the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.

Corruption had broken out in high places and, as sometimes happens, even
in religious organisations, the camp-followers had come to the front.

Yet through all this fierce condemnation of hypocrisy and apostasy,
there is in the book of the prophet Isaiah a belief in ultimate
redemption; Israel has become disgraced and trodden down by foreign foes
because of her own wickedness and cynicism; but she will be purified by
humiliation, and out of these very people will come a Redeemer, not only
for the Jews, but for the whole world. Like all great teachers of
religion and morality, he believes that the soul of man is worth saving,
and that it can be saved; he looks forward, as so many stout hearts have
done, to a distant age of universal peace and brotherly love.

<span id="p.333">p.333</span>

It is inspiring to remember that there has never been a time in history
when the call to truth and righteousness was not heard; man cannot
really live except through the life of the spirit. The spiritual is as
much a part of human nature as selfish desires; and the eloquence of
Isaiah is at once a witness to the hunger and thirst of the soul, and a
means of satisfaction. Man cannot live by bread alone. In a world so
full of intense need, the most important things can be bought without
money and without price.

Our Lord did not hesitate to take the leadership of humanity prophesied
by Isaiah; He read to the people about Him the words of the prophet, and
then, with divine audacity, He said, in thrilling tones, *To-day is this
scripture fulfilled in your ears.*
