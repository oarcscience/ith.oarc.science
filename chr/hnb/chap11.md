## WISDOM AND PHILOSOPHY

Whatever may be thought of the scientific value of the cosmogony of
Genesis, however people may disagree as to the historicity of the deeds
of Elisha, no matter how sceptical may be the general attitude toward
the story of Jonah--the Book of Proverbs is not obsolete. It was written
a long while ago, but is more contemporary than this morning's
newspaper. It cannot become demoded; it has been, is, and always will be
true; for it is founded on the eternal base of human nature; less
subject to change than the solid rocks.

Mark Twain used to say that the Mississippi River had the habit of
changing its channel overnight; so that on each trip the pilot must be
alert. But the channel of human conduct has never altered; the chart
therefore remains the same. In a world where we know so little, it is
interesting to remember that for the main lines of action and behaviour
our knowledge is sufficient. Wisdom and folly are now what they always
have been. It is not necessary to be a fool in order to discover the
results of folly. There are thousands of fools today sufficiently oblig-

<span id="p.278">p.278</span>

ing to act as examples, lending freely their experience to the profit of
observers.

It is often said that Experience is the best teacher; but this is true
only when we gain by the experience of others. In the case of the
sufferer, Experience is not the best teacher; because she charges more
for her instruction than it is worth. It does you no good to learn how
you ought to have conducted your business when you are bankrupt; it does
not help you to learn the proper diet when you are dying from poison.

> But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my
> reproof:  
> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear
> cometh;  
> When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a
> whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.

The Book of Proverbs is a collection of wise sayings founded on
observation of life. It is a clear revelation of human nature, showing
that in Hebrew history they had the same varieties of humanity that now
walk the streets of Manhattan. It is often called Hebrew Wisdom, but it
should be called Human Wisdom. It is a mingling of shrewdness and piety;
energy and reverence. It does not point out every danger, but it shows
the safe path. Its wisdom reaches far into the future; for though it
does not tell us what is wrong with our automobile--

<span id="p.279">p.279</span>

such engines then being unknown--it tells us how to drive in security.

This famous Guide-Book is mainly given up to definite, practical
instructions; but it also contains a splendid Hymn to Wisdom, wherein
Wisdom is represented as being the first creation of God, practically
coming into existence with the energy of the Divine Mind. Wisdom is
older than the hills and the sea--and if mind be older than matter, it
assuredly is. The prose of the book is specific, and meant to help
travellers in this world in all emergencies, both private and public
difficulties. The necessity of having a good education, relations of
parents and children, wives and husbands, street-neighbours, value of
hard work and the danger of shiftlessness, dangers of poverty and of
wealth, civic duties both in the courts and in trade, restraint in food,
drink, and speech, control of the sensual and angry passions, and how in
general to conduct oneself in society.

I neither know nor care who wrote out all these proverbs; they are the
accumulated wisdom and knowledge of many generations, brief and
convenient summaries of conduct. The important thing is not, Who wrote
them? or when were they written? but are they true? and if so, what use
shall we make of them?

In the main, they teach the philosophy of moderation--perhaps never more
needed than now, when so many are extremists.

<span id="p.280">p.280</span>

The two wisest men of modern times are Goethe and Franklin; they were
fond of writing aphorisms and epigrams, composing guides to life. All
the wisdom of the great German and the great American may be rightly
regarded as footnotes to the Book of Proverbs.

When a man thinks, talks, and acts well, he has behind him the support
of centuries of experience; when he behaves badly, he is running counter
to a force that has gained irresistible momentum by Time.

The percentage of alloy in this great Book is small, for nearly every
verse is the pure metal, that which remains after having passed the
sharpest and most searching tests. This is why they are so frequently
quoted, and why without additional comment, they so often make a final
answer to a proposition. It is well for public speakers and debaters to
know this book; it is a quiver full of pointed arrows.

It is interesting to observe that in the Proverbs a specific application
often follows a general suggestion; as if to say, Here is the general
truth, and here a definite illustration.

> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power
> of thine hand to do it.  
> Say not unto thy neighbour: Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will
> give; when thou hast it by thee.

The author of the sixth chapter did not disdain to learn wisdom from the
smallest animals; in his attack on laziness--a universal sin--he saw
that a

<span id="p.281">p.281</span>

bug might have more brains than a man, and was therefore fitted to teach
humanity.

> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:  
> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,  
> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the
> harvest.  
> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy
> sleep?  
> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
> sleep:  
> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an
> armed man.

Much is said in these proverbs about strange women, who were then as now
a menace to the individual and to society; there is one verse in the
sixth chapter that sums up the whole question in a few words.

> But whoso commiteth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he
> that doeth it destroyed! his own soul.

And dealing with this same vice, the wise man attempts to destroy the
illusion by coupling consequences with conduct, in a dramatic sequence:

> Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.  
> But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in
> the depths of hell.

Apart from the exhortations to good behaviour, there are many passages
which have nothing to do with ethics, but are simply revelations of the
mind of man, shedding light in dark places, as:

<span id="p.282">p.282</span>

> Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.  
> The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not
> intermeddle with his joy.  
> Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is
> heaviness.

In the twentieth century we hear much talk of disarmament, both because
of its expense, carrying burdensome taxation, and because nations know
that they are not themselves to be trusted with many battleships, any
more than a child can be trusted with toy pistols. But the sure way to
disarm one's personal enemy is given in Chapter XV:

> A soft answer turneth away wrath; but grievous words stir up anger.

Curious that nine out of ten persons still do all they possibly can to
strengthen the malignant purpose and fighting power of their
antagonists.

The limitless range of disaster brought about by fools is picturesquely
set forth in this comparison: followed later by parental grief.

> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his
> folly . . . the father of a fool hath no joy.

The strength of true friendship is interpreted in this verse:

> A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.

The ease with which a reputation for wisdom can be gained and
maintained, was understood perfectly, then as now:

<span id="p.283">p.283</span>

> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that
> shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.

The reason for this is simple enough. It is the belief, usually well
founded, that a fool cannot keep his mouth shut.

The apostle James, in his famous chapter on the untameable tongue, was
perhaps thinking of the following verse:

> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it
> shall eat the fruit thereof.

The following passage undoubtedly was the cause of much lamentation
among the children of Puritans:

> Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for
> his crying.

The question of personal honour, misunderstood through so many
centuries, which false interpretation has largely added to the
population of graveyards, is truly stated in the Proverbs:

> It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be
> meddling.

The talk of bargainers has not greatly changed.

> It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his
> way, then he boasteth.

One of the favourite sources of humour in the mediaeval poems and plays
was a woman with a bad temper; she was represented as a terror to the
most valiant man. I wonder if she was as common in real life as on the
stage and in fiction? and if so,

<span id="p.284">p.284</span>

was it because her disposition was ruined by her husband? In the
Proverbs, this character is repeatedly mentioned:

> It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a
> brawling woman in a wide house.  
> It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and
> an angry woman.
>
> *(Wilderness were paradise enow!)*
>
> A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are
> alike.

Many verses deal with opportune and inopportune speech; nothing seems
more beautiful than just the right word spoken in just the right way at
just the right time; whereas nothing is more unbearable than the fatuous
presumption of those numerous babblers who seem to have a positive
genius for the inopportune.

> A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.  
> As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise
> reprover upon an obedient ear.  
> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger
> to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.

On the other hand:

> Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without
> rain.  
> A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and
> a sword, and a sharp arrow.  
> Confidence in an unfaithful friend in time of trouble is like a broken
> tooth, and a foot out of joint.  
> As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as

<span id="p.285">p.285</span>

> vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.  
> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the
> morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.

It would seem that even in those days the jovial back-slapper usually
selected the wrong time for his enthusiasm. Practical jokers were also
common, and were regarded with the detestation they have always
deserved.

> So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith: Am not I in
> sport?

The truly wise man not only does not trust others overmuch, he does not
trust himself. Some Frenchman said that the biggest fool in the world
was the man who believed he could know himself. The wisest man among the
Greeks was Ulysses, whose wisdom was particularly shown in his distrust
of his own heart, and the preparations he made against himself. When he
had been warned that the song of the Sirens was fatal, he had the ears
of his crew plugged, so that they could hear nothing, for he knew that
sailors are not to be trusted with women. But his supreme wisdom was
shown in the way he overreached himself, providing against his folly in
advance. He wished to hear this ravishing melody, for he desired to have
every possible experience; so he left his own ears unstopped, but bade
the sailors tie him securely to the mast, and to pay no attention to
him, if he should struggle to break loose; on no account to release him.
Then when he heard the

<span id="p.286">p.286</span>

music, although he was the wisest man in the world, and had been
distinctly warned of this particular danger, he struggled with all his
might to be free, and cursed the sailors for disregarding his wild
writhings; but he had foreseen his own danger, knew he could not trust
himself, and had thus saved himself from himself. All this was clearly
stated in one verse of the Proverbs:

> He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool.

It should be remembered that when St. Paul, in the twelfth chapter of
the Letter to the Romans, gave his famous advice to overcome an enemy
with kindness, he was quoting from the old book of Proverbs:

> If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty,
> give him water to drink:  
> For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.

Occasionally there is a touch of mystic beauty, wise with a wisdom far
beyond the wisdom of this world. It is the profound wisdom of poetry and
religion.

> Where there is no vision, the people perish.

Of all the chapters in Proverbs, my favourite is the thirtieth. This is
said to contain the words of Agur, the son of Jakeh, being his
confession of faith and the summary of his observations and knowledge of
life. I wish we knew something about Agur; but he is as complete a
puzzle as Melchizedek. No one

<span id="p.287">p.287</span>

knows anything either of him or his father except their names. He was a
wise man, who had learned much in his way of life; he had keen eyes, an
understanding heart, a fine sense of humour, and a vivid imagination.

His prayer is for neither poverty nor riches; lead me not into
temptation. If I am poor, I may steal, or become morose, and blaspheme
God. If I am rich, I may become self-satisfied, and worship myself
instead of God. His ideal in everything is moderation, for he has
observed the never-dying greediness of man, and how increase of desire
brings misery.

> The horseleach hath two daughters, crying: Give, give. There are three
> things which are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is
> enough:  
> The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with
> water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.

The beauty and mystery of life filled his mind; he meditated often and
deeply. He thought about the progress through the air of the
still-winged eagle, which no one yet understands; of the swift gliding
of the snake across a stone; of a ship close-hauled to the wind; and
above all, of that mystery of mysteries, on which both human life and
human art are founded, the relation of man to woman.

> There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which
> I know not: The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon
> a

<span id="p.288">p.288</span>

> rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man
> with a maid.

As he looked back on the vexations of life, he tried to think of what is
most intolerable; and he decided that there were four things which
cannot be borne--a servant when he reigneth, (see Kipling), a fool when
he is filled with meat, an odious woman when she is married, and an
handmaid that is heir to her mistress.

From these unpleasant spectacles, he turns to the contemplation of four
small and weak animals, who nevertheless may teach us much.

> There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are
> exceeding wise:  
> The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the
> summer;  
> The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the
> rocks;  
> The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;  
> The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.

The ants are not strong in body, but strong in mind; they prepare
themselves against the evil day, and thus in time of distress are really
stronger than giants, for they have enough. The conies were little
rabbits, who had no aggressive weapons and no defence except flight; but
by building their houses in the rocks, these feeble folk became just as
strong as their impregnable home. The locusts learned what no community
of human beings have ever yet

<span id="p.289">p.289</span>

learned, how to make their world safe for democracy; they have no
tyrannical and capricious king, no written constitution, yet they
understand how to govern themselves and can live and work together
harmoniously; the ugly spider rises aloft, and dwells, with all her
ugliness, in the splendid palace of the king. She aspired. And so these
four humble creatures are illustrations to the observing Agur of four
ideas: The wisdom of preparedness, the wisdom of safety, the wisdom of
cooperation, and the wisdom of beauty.

The last chapter is said to contain the words of King Lemuel, who is
generally believed to be no other than Solomon. It is full of deep
insight, because, as we are told in the first verse, he is simply
repeating what his mother taught him. She told him how to become and how
to remain a wise king and a beneficent ruler; two excesses must be
resolutely avoided--strange women and strong liquor. Both indulgences
have destroyed innumerable kings. If it really is Solomon talking, he
resembles other men in neglecting his mother's counsel. A king, she
added, is also a judge, and if he drinks too much, his power of judgment
is perverted, and his wisdom will be turned into folly. Use wine only as
medicine, as a stimulant for those who are desperately ill, and to
comfort those suffering from melancholia.

Then suddenly she passes to the consideration of that subject, which is
a perennial theme--Woman.

<span id="p.290">p.290</span>

Who is the ideal woman? What does she do? how does she dress? what does
she say? Now although fashions in garments, in manners, in appearance,
change bewilderingly from generation to generation, it is safe to say
that the ideal woman as herein represented, will never go out of style,
and will never cease to be attractive. Modesty is accompanied by the
charm of mystery; character withstands the insidious decay of years;
good sense is always current coin; kindness is the glory of a woman's
conversation, as venomous speech is its degradation.

> Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.  
> The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall
> have no need of spoil.  
> She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.  
> She stretcheth out her hands to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her
> hands to the needy.  
> She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household
> are clothed with scarlet.  
> She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and
> purple.  
> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of
> the land.  
> Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to
> come.  
> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of
> kindness.  
> She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the
> bread of idleness.  
> Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he
> praiseth her.

<span id="p.291">p.291</span>

The phrase, "She shall rejoice in time to come," when literally
translated, reads: "She laughs at the time to come." She has no fear of
advancing years, which strike so many women with terror; for she knows
that her charm is not wholly external, and that old age will only
increase it.

After so many attacks on women in the Book of Proverbs, it is inspiring
to read this magnificent tribute, evidently drawn from the life. And it
is well to compare this ideal woman with those who, according to
Addison, spend all their time decorating that part of the head known as
the outside. A pretty girl without brains is described elsewhere in
these proverbs, in the following homely phrase:

> As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is
> without discretion.

Let us hope that among Solomon's seven hundred wives, he found one that
approached the ideal set forth by his mother.

The Book of Ecclesiastes, as we have it in the Bible, may be considered
as a treatise on philosophy, just as the Proverbs are a collection of
wise sayings dealing with conduct. The latter belongs to the world of
action, the former to the world of thought. The philosophy represented
in Ecclesiastes is Pessimism--pessimism as complete and thoroughgoing as
that expressed by two other literary artists, Schopenhauer and Thomas
Hardy.

It is supposed to be the conclusion about life

<span id="p.292">p.292</span>

reached by the wisest man of the world, Solomon the king, the son of
David. If this be true, it is quite natural, and should call for no
surprise. David was a man of action, with tremendous zest for life, who
enjoyed himself thoroughly; he loved women, fighting, statesmanship,
singing, dancing, good company, poetry, and music; he was too busy to be
a pessimist, just as a mother of ten children seldom has nervous
prostration. She hasn't the time.

Solomon asked for purely mental gifts and he received them in abundance.
Big, hearty David had a thoughtful son, given to introspection and much
solitary meditation. It is a modern instance. One often sees today a
captain of industry, who at seventy years of age, is cheerfully active;
while his son, far better educated, having begun in childhood to ask
awkward questions of his parents and having received no answer, now asks
them of himself.

In the English text, Solomon is called the Preacher: the Hebrew word for
that is Koheleth, and therefore in modern translations and commentaries
this book--with the exception of the moralising passages--is said to be
the work of a man named Koheleth. The late Professor Jastrow, in his
interesting version and discussion of Ecclesiastes, believed Koheleth to
be an assumed name. Professor Jastrow deserves the gratitude of scholars
and readers for his investigations; one must always remember, however,
that the largest part of his book is conjecture, and also that his
translation,

<span id="p.293">p.293</span>

however close to the Hebrew, resembles all other modern translations in
its inferiority in English style to the Authorised Version.

Remember that it makes absolutely no difference whether Solomon wrote
it, or some obscure preacher, or a man named Koheleth, or some other man
who called himself Koheleth. The important thing is that we have a
magnificent piece of literature, containing a pessimistic view of life,
accompanied with religious admonition. If Solomon wrote both, well and
good; with his mentality, and appetites jaded by excess, it would fit
him perfectly.

In the Note-Book of the Russian novelist, Chekhov, we find this
interesting monologue:

> Solomon (alone). Oh! how dark is life! No night, when I was a child,
> so terrified me by its darkness as does my invisible existence. Lord,
> to David my father Thou gavest only the gift of harmonising words and
> sounds, to sing and praise Thee on strings, to lament sweetly, to make
> people weep or admire beauty; but why hast Thou given me a meditative,
> sleepless, hungry mind? Like an insect born of the dust, I hide in
> darkness; and in fear and despair, all shaking and shivering, I see
> and hear in everything an invisible mystery. Why this morning? Why
> does the sun come out from behind the temple and gild the palm tree?
> Why this beauty of women? Where does the bird hurry; what is the
> meaning of its flight, if it and its young and the place to which it
> hastens will, like myself, turn to dust? It were better I had never
> been born or were a stone, to which God has given neither eyes nor
> thoughts. In order to tire out my body by nightfall, all day
> yesterday, like a mere workman, I carried marble to the temple; but
> now the night has come and I cannot sleep......I'll go and lie down.

<span id="p.294">p.294</span>

> Phorsco told me that if one imagines a flock of sheep running and
> fixes one's attention upon it, the mind gets confused and one falls
> asleep. I'll do it......(Exit.)

Elsewhere Chekhov wrote in his Note-Book, "Solomon made a great mistake
when he asked for wisdom."

It is interesting to observe that the English novelist, John Galsworthy,
in his novel, *To Let,* has created a character whose philosophy is
exactly similar to that expressed in Ecclesiastes. This man is the
Belgian, Monsieur Profond, who has completely exhausted life, and has
neither enthusiasm nor principles; his remark about every occupation,
interest, and life itself is simply that there is nothing in it.

If Solomon wrote only the pessimism in the book of Ecclesiastes, and
some pious scribe added the religious admonitions, very well; they are
both true, taken separately or together. Without any faith in God, life
ceases to have any meaning, which is precisely the view taken in the
body of the text; with faith in God, even the sorrows of life have
significance, because everything has a meaning, which is the view taken
by the commentator.

Therefore it is not surprising to find this book in the Bible. The
objections to it as a portion of Holy Writ are based on the fact that it
expresses pessimism and despair; but it does not teach pessimism and
despair. Jezebel expresses in her life, conduct, and talk a certain kind
of woman; but she is not meant to be a model.

<span id="p.295">p.295</span>

The Book of Ecclesiastes is one of the most modern of all the sixty-six
parts of the Bible-- because pessimism is to-day an extremely popular
attitude of mind. One reason why pessimism is popular is because the
majority of people have the insidious taint of self-pity, and imagine
that their particular troubles are more severe than those carried by
others. Furthermore, a great many have lost all religious faith and with
it the key to life; life is certainly a mystery to all of us, but to
some it is a marvellous and challenging mystery, to others a hopeless
and purpose-crushing puzzle. One man rises higher by reason of an
obstacle; another is tripped by it, never to rise again.

It is also characteristic that modern critics like the pessimism of this
book better than the religious teaching it contains; for many would much
rather be told what a wretched time they are having, poor fellows, than
to be told how to improve the situation--especially when the latter plan
means real work.

It is often said that the Preacher is like Omar Khayyam; so he is, if
you leave out the *practical* philosophies of both. Omar says that we
know not whence we came nor whither we are going; therefore, take a
drink. This book says we know nothing about life, therefore fear God and
keep His commandments.

Personally, I have never been able to see why ignorance of life should
produce a thirst. I suppose

<span id="p.296">p.296</span>

that what is meant, is to drug one's puzzled mind into oblivion, so that
one can forget the mystery of life. Now inasmuch as mind is the best
thing we have, I prefer to keep it as clear as possible. A tiny candle
may not go far in the darkness, but it is better than more darkness.

It is a curious fact that people who are sick, or poor, or crippled are
not as a rule pessimists; the pessimists are recruited from the ranks of
the healthy and wealthy, who have grown dull from easily satisfied
desires.

The Preacher loses no time in stating his philosophical position. His
first word is Vanity--*vanitas vanitatum.* There is nothing new under
the sun. Generations come and go, and the earth abideth forever. The
Preacher had seen everything, had tasted all experience, had eaten
freely of the tree of knowledge, and had come to this conclusion-- there
is nothing in it! Life is meaningless. Observe that, like a genuine
philosophical pessimist, he does not lay the main emphasis on the
sorrows and discomforts of life; for these could be borne, bad as they
are, if we knew we were going somewhither, if we knew pain had a
meaning. Real pessimism rises not from experience of pain, but from the
fear that life is without significance. Nothing makes any difference.
Oblivion swallows us all. He hated life, with that common and yet
peculiar fallacy of thought; he hated life, because he hated death. If
life is hateful, death should be welcome; if life is

<span id="p.297">p.297</span>

wretched, its shortness should be counted as an asset; but in reality
nobody loves life deep down in his heart like your pessimist--whose two
reasons for hating life are first, that it is short, and second, that it
is followed by oblivion.

> Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth
> even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart,
> that this also is vanity.  
> For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever;
> seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten.
> And how dieth the wise man? As the fool.  
> Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun
> is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation; of spirit.

Later, this hater of life reveals his love of it,, which explains what I
mean by saying that no one loves life like your pessimist.

One of his statements, which is constantly quoted, is certainly not
true: "Increase of knowledge in-creaseth sorrow." One might as well say
that the view at the base of a tower is finer than the view from the top
thereof; or that one leg is better than two. Although the famous
assertion of the Preacher

<span id="p.298">p.298</span>

is false, his philosophy is consistently founded upon it; youth is the
best time of life and old age the most miserable. The noble poetry of
the book, which in the Authorised Version, is full of solemn and
mournful music, reaches its splendid climax in the last chapter; the
language of despair has never reached elsewhere such an elevation as in
this lamentation on old age, where one hardly knows which to admire
more, the language or the rhythm; the swiftly following succession of
vivid metaphors, or the swelling adagio music:

> While the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt
> say, I have no pleasure in them;  
> While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
> darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:  
> In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong
> men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few,
> and those that look out of the windows be darkened.

The keepers of the house are either the ribs or the hips; the strong men
are the legs; the grinders are the molars; the windows are the eyes, and
the sight is dim with advancing years.

> And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the
> grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and
> all the daughters of musick shall be brought low.

The doors are the ears, which age closes up; the sound of the grinding
is low presumably means that penetrating noises reach old ears dim and
muffled; he shall rise up at the voice of the bird--one of the

<span id="p.299">p.299</span>

all but universal accompaniments of old age is inability to sleep late
in the morning; in the days of Ecclesiastes, as now, the old man woke at

> The earliest pipe of half-awakened bird

and wondered how he would get through the three hours before breakfast.
The daughters of music shall be brought low does not mean that the voice
will be of lower register, for in the only passage fit to be compared
with this, the soliloquy of Jaques in *As You Like It,* he has the manly
voice change into thin, childish treble; what it means is that the music
of health will leave the voice of old age, which will have no vibration,
but will be thin and unpleasant; the daughters of music are slain.

> Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall
> be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper
> shall be a burden, and desire shall fail.

Fear of that which is high means that old age does not like hills, not
even stairs; fears shall be in the way refers to the timidity that
accompanies the old man in every movement; the almond tree has white
blossoms, referring to the white hair; the grasshopper shall be a burden
probably means simply that even the merest trifle causes worry; desire
refers to the loss of virility.

> Because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the

> Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be

> at the cistern.

The funeral processions in the streets mean more to an old man than to
youth, being a kind of public rehearsal of his own tragedy; the silver
cord may be the spine, and the golden bowl the head, containing the
brain, which has lost its activity; what is meant by the pitcher and the
wheel nobody knows; Professor Jastrow thinks they may refer to the
kidneys and intestines. But they may mean simply the inability of the
old man to carry out any plan; at the very moment of action, his purpose
is made sterile by weakness, as the pitcher is broken just when you want
to fill it, and the wheel broken at just the time when you need its
revolution.

Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.

>     Last scene of all,  
> That ends this strange, eventful history,  
> Is second childishness and mere oblivion;  
> Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

Which speech Shakespeare put into the mouth of an idle and disillusioned
spectator, as the Bible places similar views in the mouth of a tired and
jaded king.

The commentator could not let such philosophy pass without an antidote;
just as a physician gives a remedy for disease, so this commentator,
whether he were the original philosopher or some one who

<span id="p.301">p.301</span>

had read the despairing words with curiosity and dissent, added very
sensibly:

> This is the conclusion of the whole matter; fear God and keep His
> commandments.

Or, as Tennyson says,

> Hold thou the good; define it well  
>     For fear divine Philosophy  
>     Should push beyond her mark, and be  
> Procuress to the Lords of Hell.
