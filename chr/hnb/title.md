> A POSTSCRIPT BY WAY OF PREFACE
>
> I have done: and if any blames me,  
> Thinking that merely to touch in brevity  
>     The topics I dwell on, were unlawful--  
> Or worse, that I trench, with undue levity,  
>     On the bounds of the holy and the awful--  
> I praise the heart, and pity the head of him,  
> And refer myself to THEE, instead of him,  
> Who head and heart alike discernest,  
>     Looking below light speech we utter,  
>     When frothy spume and frequent sputter  
> Prove that the soul's depths boil in earnest!  
> May truth shine out, stand ever before us!  
>     --*Christmas Eve,* by ROBERT BROWNING.
