# The Book of the Cave of Treasures

### notes to the hypertext transcription

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The *Book of the Cave of Treasures* is a sixth century Christian sacred
history written by a Jacobite. The Jacobites are an eastern Monophysite
sect, seperate from both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox
churches. This book and the *Book of the Bee* are both interesting
because they present the 'history' of the world from the creation to the
death of Christ, thus reproducing a good bit of the story contained in
the Bible, but they also contain many stories not included in the
canonical account, some of the material being Jewish, some of it Greek,
and some of it Mesopotamian. According to Budge--

> The principal object of the writer of the "Cave of Treasures" was to
> trace the descent of Christ back to Adam, and to show that the
> Christian Dispensation was foreshadowed in the history of the
> Patriarchs and their successors the kings of Israel and Judah by means
> of types and symbols. (Introduction, [pp. 33-34](bct03.htm#page_33).md)

**Transcription standards and notes**: Underlines represent breve
(short) markings over vowels, and dots under consonants, \` and ´
represent right and left pointing apostrophes in transcriptions of
Semitic words. Some of the references to the pagination of the Syriac
MS. (*i.e.*, in the format \[Fol. 8*a*, col. 1\]) were off and have been
corrected; missing references, however, have not been supplied. Some of
the transcriptions of names from the Syriac have been standardized.
