THE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS FROM THE SECOND YEAR OF CYRUS TO THE BIRTH OF
CHRIST.

 

   Now when the people had gone up \[to Jerusalem\] they had no Books of
the Prophets. And Ezra the scribe went down into that pit \[wherein
Simeon had cast the Books\], and he found a censer full of fire, and the
perfume of the incense which rose up from it. And thrice he took some of
the dust of those Books, and cast it into his mouth, and straightway God
made to abide in him the spirit of prophecy, and he renewed all the
Books of the Prophets.

 

   **\[**NOTE.--According to the *Book of Adam* (iv. 10) the manuscripts
and the library of the Temple were burnt. Simeon begged the commander to
give him the ruins of the library, and he went in and collected the
ashes of the books and put them into a pot, which he placed in a vault.
He filled a censer with coals and incense, and, having lighted the fire,
he set the censer over the place where the ashes of the books lay. The
fire continued to burn until Ezra came to the <span id="page_193">p.
193</span> vault, and the smoke of the incense was rising from the
censer. He spread his hands thrice over the ashes of the books, and God
gave him the spirt of prophecy, and he rewrote the Books of the Law and
the Prophets.**\]**

 

   And that same fire which was found in the pit became the holy fire in
the house of the Lord. And Zerubbabel reigned in Jerusalem, and Joshua,
the son of Yôzâdâk, was high-priest, and Ezra was the scribe of the Law
and the Prophets. And the children of Israel \[<span
id="fol_37a1"></span>Fol. 37*a*, col. 1\] celebrated a Passover when
they went up from Babel. These are the three Passovers which the
children of Israel kept; the first was \[kept\] in Egypt in the days of
Moses; the the second was \[kept\] in the reign of Josiah; the third was
\[kept\] when they went up from the land of Babel. And now an end hath
been made to the Passover for them for ever. From the first captivity of
Jerusalem, that in which Daniel went down into captivity, to the reign
of Cyrus the Persian, was seventy years according to the prophecy of
Jeremiah. And the children of Israel began the \[re\]building of the
Temple in the days of Zerubbabel, and Joshua, the son of Yôzâdôk, and
Ezra the scribe, and the building thereof was finished in six and forty
years, even as it is written in the holy Gospel ([John ii.
19](../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#2:19)).

\[The genealogies of the later Israelites.\]

   Now the genealogy of the tribes (or, families) was lost by \[<span
id="fol_37a2"></span>Fol. 37*a*, col. 2\] the scribes, and they were
unable to show either whence the heads of families took \[their\] wives,
or whence they came. I, however, possess the knowledge of the correct
genealogy, and will show the truth to everyman. When the children of
Israel went up from Babylon--

   Zerubbabel begot Abiud by Malkath, the daughter of Ezra the scribe.  
   Abiud took to wife Zakhyath, the daughter of Joshua, the son of
Yôzâdâk, the priest, and begot by her Eliakim.  
   Eliakim took to wife <u>H</u>âlâbh, the daughter of Dôrnîbh, and
begot by her \`Azôr.  
   \`Azôr took to wife Yalpath, the daughter of <u>H</u>azôr, and begot
by her Zadok.  
   Zadok took to wife <u>K</u>altîn, the daughter of Dôrnibh, and begot
by her Akhîn.  
   Akhîn took to wife <u>H</u>eskath, the daughter of Ta\`îl, and begot
by her Eliud.  
   Eliud took to wife Beshtîn, the daughter of \[<span
id="fol_37b1"></span>Fol. 37*b*, col. 1\] <u>H</u>asâl, and begot by her
Eleazar.  
   Eleazar took to wife Dîbath, the daughter of Tôlâ<u>h</u>, and begot
by her Mâtthân.  
   Mâtthân took to wife Sebhrath, the daughter of Phinehas, and begot by
her two sons at one conception, Jacob and Yônâkhîr.  
    <span id="page_195">p. 195</span> Jacob took to wife
<u>H</u>adbhîth, the daughter of Eleazur, and begot by her Joseph.  
   Yônakhîr took Dînâ, the daughter of Pâ<u>k</u>ôdh, and begot by her
Mary, of whom was born the Christ.  

   And because none of the early writers could discover the order of
succession of the generations of their fathers, the Jews urged the sons
of the Church very strongly to show them \[who were\] the fathers of the
blessed Mary in the order of the succession of their families. And they
pressed the children of the Church to enquire into the genealogy of the
families \[<span id="fol_37b2"></span>Fol. 37*b*, col. 2\] of their
fathers, and to show them the truth. For the Jews call Mary an
adulteress. And here the mouth of the Jews is stopped, and they believe
that Mary was of the seed of the house of David and of Abraham. Now the
Jews have no table of succession which showeth them the true order of
the families of their fathers, because their books have been burned
thrice--once in the days of Antiochus \[IV. Epiphanes\], who raised up a
persecution against them, and polluted the Temple of the Lord, and
forced them to offer up sacrifices unto idols; the second time in the
days of . . . . . . . ; and the third time in the days of Herod, when
Jerusalem was destroyed. Because of this the Jews were greatly grieved,
for they had no <span id="page_196">p. 196</span> trustworthy table of
the succession of the generations of their fathers. And they toiled
eagerly \[<span id="fol_38a1"></span>Fol. 38*a*, col. 1\] that they
might obtain the truth, but they were unable to do so.

   Now the Jews had many writers, and each of them wrote what he
pleased, and no two of them agreed in what they wrote, because they
could not stand on a foundation of truth. And even our own writers, the
children of the Church, cannot show us the certainty of the real truth.
They cannot show how the ascent of the body of Adam to Golgotha took
place, nor whence came the fathers (or, ancestors) of Melchisedek, and
the fathers of the blessed woman Mary. And the children of Israel being
urged by the Church, and being unable to ascertain the truth, waxed
reckless, and wrote, as it were, in the madness of error. \[Here the
text is faulty and incomplete.\] And as concerning the table of
succession of the sixty-three families, which \[reach\] from Adam to
Christ, the Greek writers, and the Hebrew writers, and the Syrian
writers, can neither show whence each head of a family took his wife
\[<span id="fol_38a2"></span>Fol. 38*a*, col. 2\], nor whose daughter
she was. Now each divine doctor (or, teacher) has laid down for the
Church one true doctrine, and they have given unto believers the armour
wherewith they can fight and overcome her enemies. Besides this, the
grace of Christ hath granted unto us <span id="page_197">p. 197</span>
that which was lacking in them, and this we will cast into the rich
treasury \[of their knowledge\]. And this, with great diligence, we have
bestirred ourselves to do, even as our truly loving brother in Christ,
the illustrious Nâmôsâyâ (Nemesius ?) greatly desireth. And although I
have been hindered through my dilatoriness, thou hast through thy love
of learning, not been dilatory. And because of thy loving kindness
towards me, and also because I myself am eager not to withhold from thee
that which thou requirest of me, I will \[here\] write down \[<span
id="fol_38b1"></span>Fol. 38*b*, col. 1\] the true table of succession.
Hear, O my brother Nemesius (?) the following table of succession which
I write for thee; none of the \[other\] doctors hath been able to light
upon it. The following are the sixty-three generations from which the
Incarnation of Christ is descended, and their order is thus:--

\[The Genealogy of Mary.\]

   And because Joseph was the son of Mary's uncle, by the fore-knowledge
of God, Who knew that Mary would be certainly attacked by the Jews, Mary
was given to Joseph, who was the son of her uncle, that he might take
care of her. Observe, O our brother Nemesius, that the fathers of the
blessed woman Mary belonged to the succession of the generations of
David.

 

   **\[**NOTE.--An alternative genealogy is given in the *Book of the
Bee* ([chapter xxxiii](../bb/bb33)), and reads: David begot Nathan,
Nathan begot Mattatha, Mattatha begot Mani, Mani begot Melea, Melea
begot Eliakim, Eliakim begot Jonam, Jonam begot Levi. \[Add Joseph, Juda
and Simeon from [Luke iii. 19](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#3:19), 20.\] Levi
begot Mattîtha, Mattîtha begot Jorim, Jorim begot Eliezer, Eliezer begot

   Behold, I have set thee upon a foundation of truth, which none of the
\[former\] chroniclers found to stand upon; see, too, how these
sixty-three generations \[reaching\] from Adam to the birth of Christ,
succeeded each other. And the Jews also rejoiced \[<span
id="fol_39b2"></span>Fol. 39*b*, col. 2\] because they also had found
the generations of the familles of their fathers.

   Observe, O our brother Nemesius, that in the days of Cyrus the <span
class="small">FIFTH THOUSAND \[YEARS\] CAME TO AN END</span>. And from
the thousand \[years\] of Cyrus until the Passion of our Redeemer, the
years were in number five hundred, according to the prophecy of Daniel,
who prophesied and said, "After sixty-two weeks the Messiah shall be
slain." And these weeks make five hundred years.

 

   **\[**NOTE.--According to the *Book of Adam* (iv. 14), Daniel said,
"After seven weeks Christ shall come, and shall be put to death." Now
seven weeks are 490 years, for a great week contains 70 years. But on
that the prophet said, "after <span id="page_203">p. 203</span> seven
years," he pointed to the \[remaining\] ten \[of the 500 years\]. Daniel
did not say, "Christ shall come at the end of seven weeks," but "after
seven weeks, and He shall be put to death."**\]**

 

   Behold, from this time the mouth of the Jews is shut, for they have
dared to say that the Messiah hath not yet come. They must, perforce, do
one of two things: either accept the prophecy of Daniel, or say, "We do
not accept it." For the prophecy hath fulfilled itself, and the weeks
have passed, and the Messiah hath been slain, and the Holy City hath
been laid waste by Vespasian.

 

\[The Birth of Christ.\]

   Observe now \[<span id="fol_40a1"></span>Fol. 40*a*, col. 1\], O thou
lover of learning, our brother Nemesius, in the forty-second year of the
kingdom of Augustus, Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judah, as it is
written in the Holy Gospel.

 

\[The Star and the Magi.\]

   Now, it was two years before Christ was born that the star appeared
to the Magi. They saw the star in the firmament of heaven, and the
brilliancy of its appearance was brighter than that of every other star.
And within it was a <span id="page_204">p. 204</span> maiden carrying a
child, and a crown was set upon his head. Now it was the custom of the
ancient kings, and the Magi of the Chaldeans, to consult the Signs of
the Zodiac about all the affairs of their lives. And when the Magi saw
the star they were perturbed, and terrified, and afraid, and the whole
land of Persia was disturbed. And the kings, and the Magi, and the
Chaldeans \[<span id="fol_40a2"></span>Fol. 40*a*, col. 2\], and the
wise men of Persia, were stupefied, and they were exceedingly afraid of
the portent which they saw. And they said, "Peradventure the king of the
Greeks hath determined to wage war against the land of Nimrod." And the
Magi and the Chaldeans were terrified, and they consulted their books of
wisdom, and through the might of the wisdom of their books they
understood and learned, and stood upon the strength of the truth. Now,
in truth, the Magi of the Chaldeans discovered that by means of the
motions of the stars, to which they gave the name of "Signs of the
Zodiac," they were able to know and understand the strength (or,
importance) of events before they took place. And this same knowledge is
also given to those who go down into the sea, and by the motions of the
stars they know beforehand when there is going to be a disturbance of
the winds, and when a violent storm is going to rise up against them,
and <span id="page_205">p. 205</span> whenever they are about to be
threatened with danger from winds and waves. Thus also was it with the
Magi. When they saw and read in the \[<span id="fol_40b1"></span>Fol.
40*b*, col. 1\] "Revelation of Nimrod" they discovered therein that a
king was born in Judah, and the whole path of the Dispensation of Christ
was revealed unto them.

 

   **\[**NOTE.--As touching the nature of that star, whether it was a
star in its nature, or in appearance only, it is right to know that it
was not of the other stars, but a secret power which appeared like a
star; for all the other stars that are in the firmament, and the sun and
moon, perform their course from east to west. This one, however, made
its course from north to south, for Palestine lies thus, over against
Persia. This star was not seen by them at night only, but also during
the day, and at noon; and it was seen at the time when the sun is
particularly strong, because it was not one of the stars. Now the moon
is stronger in its light than all the stars, but it is immediately
quenched and its light dissipated by one small ray of the sun. But this
star overcame even the beams of the sun by the intensity of its light.
Sometimes it appeared, and sometimes it was hidden entirely. It guided
the Magi as far as Palestine. . . . . . This was not an ordinary
movement of the stars, but a <span id="page_206">p. 206</span> rational
power. Moreover, it had no fixed path. It did not remain always in the
height of heaven, but sometimes it came down, and sometimes it mounted
up. *Book of the Bee* ([chapter xxxviii](../bb/bb38)).**\]**

   And straightway, according to what they had received from the
tradition which had been handed down to them by their fathers, they left
the East, and went up to the mountains of Nôdh, which lie inside the
entrances to the East from the lands on the skirts of the North, and
they took from them gold, and myrrh, and frankincense. And from this
\[passage\] understand, O my brother Nemesius, that the Magi knew the
whole service of the Dispensation of our Redeemer through the offerings
which they brought: the gold was for a king, the myrrh for a physician,
and the frankincense for a priest, for the Magi knew Who He was, and
that He was a king, and a physician, and a priest. Now when the son of
the king of Sheba was a little boy his father brought him \[<span
id="fol_40b2"></span>Fol. 40*b*, col. 2\] to a Rabbi, and he learned the
Book of the Hebrews better than all his companions and his fellow
countrymen, and he said unto all his slaves, "It is written in all the
books of genealogies that the king shall be born in Bethlehem."

 

\[The names of the Magi.\]

   These are they who bore offerings to the King, kings, the sons of
kings:--

|                                   |                                                                                                                                     |

   **\[**NOTE.--In the *Book of Adam* (iv. 15) the kings are called Hor,
king of Persia, Basantar, king of Saba, and Karsundas, king of the East.
According to the *Book of the Bee* ([chapter xxxix](../bb/bb39)), the
Magi were twelve in number, and their names were:--  
      Zarwândâd, the son of Artabân.  
      Hôrmîzdâd, the son of Sî<u>t</u>ârû<u>k</u>
(San<u>t</u>arô<u>k</u>).  
      Gûshnâsâph (Gushnasp), the son of Gûndaphar.  
      Arshakh, the son of Mîhârôk.  
   These four brought gold.  
      Zarwândâd, the son of Wârzwâd.  
      Îryâhô, the son of Kesro (Khusrau).  
      Ar<u>t</u>a<u>h</u>shesht, the son of <u>H</u>olîtî.  
      Ashtôn\`âbôdân, the son of Shîshrôn.  
   These four brought myrrh.  
      Mehârôk, the son of <u>H</u>ûhâm.  
      A<u>h</u>shiresh, the son of Ha<u>s</u>bân.  
      <u>S</u>ardâlâh, the son of Baladân.  
      Merôdâch, the son of Beldarân.  
   These four brought frankincense.**\]**

 

\[The Magi in Jerusalem.\]

   And the Magi having made ready to go up, the kingdom of the mighty
men of war was <span id="page_210">p. 210</span> perturbed and
terrified, and there was with the Magi so mighty a following that all
the cities of the East were in dismay before them, and Jerusalem also.
And when they entered the presence of Herod, he trembled before them,
and he commanded them, saying, "Depart in \[<span
id="fol_41a1"></span>Fol. 41*a*, col. 1\] peace, and seek diligently for
the young Child, and when ye have found Him, come and show me, that I
too may go and make obeisance unto Him"; though deceit was hidden in
Herod's heart, he offered homage with his mouth. Now when, the Magi went
up to Jerusalem there was great commotion in Judea, because of the edict
of Augustus Cæsar, which commanded that every man should be registered
in his country, and in the city of his fathers. Because of this Herod
was greatly perturbed, and he said unto the Magi, "Go ye and search for
Him." Now the Magi are called "Magi" because of the garb of Magianism in
which the heathen kings arrayed themselves whensoever they offered up a
sacrifice and made offerings to their gods. They made use of two
different kinds of apparel; that which appertained to royalty \[they
wore\] inside, and that which appertained to Magianism outside \[<span
id="fol_41a2"></span>Fol. 41*a*, col. 2\]. And thus also was it with
those who went up prepared to make offerings to Christ, and they were
arrayed in both kinds of apparel.

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

   And when the Magi had gone forth from Jerusalem, and from the
presence of Herod, that same star which had been their guide on the road
appeared to them, and they rejoiced greatly. And the star went on before
them until they entered the cave, where they saw the young Child swathed
in bands and laid in a manger. Whilst they were on their way up thither
they said within themselves, "When we arrive there we shall see mighty
and wonderful things, according to the law and custom which prevail
among royal personages when a king is born." Thus did they think that
they would find in the land of Israel a royal palace, and couches of
gold with cushions laid upon them \[<span id="fol_41b1"></span>Fol.
41*b*, col. 1\], and the king and the son of the king arrayed in purple,
and awestruck soldiers and companies of royal troops, and the nobles of
the kingdom paying him honour by presenting gifts, and tables laid out
with meats fit for the king, and vessels of drink standing in rows, and
men servants and women servants serving in fear. Such were the things
which the Magi expected to see, but they saw them not; they saw sights
which were far better than these when they went into the cave. They saw
Joseph sitting in astonishment, and Mary in a state of wonderment, but
there was no couch with cushions laid upon it, and no table with <span
id="page_212">p. 212</span> food laid out upon it, and no sign of the
preparations which accompany royal state. And although they saw all this
humble estate and poverty, they had no doubt in their minds, but they
drew nigh in fear and made obeisance to Him in honour, and they offered
\[<span id="fol_41b2"></span>Fol. 41*b*, col. 2\] unto Him, gold, and
myrrh, and frankincense. And it was very grievous unto Mary and Joseph
that they had nothing to set before them, but the Magi fed themselves
with food of their own providing.

 

   **\[**NOTES.--In addition to the gold, frankincense and myrrh which
the Magi brought, they laid before the Child as an offering thirty
*zûzê* of silver. Their weight was according to the weight of the
sanctuary, but they were equal to six hundred pieces according to the
weight of the country. (The Syriac zûzê = the Arabic *dirham* and the
Greek *drachme*.) The thirty pieces were made by Terah, who gave them to
Abraham, who gave them to Isaac. With them Isaac bought a village, and
the man who received them took them to Pharaoh. Pharaoh sent them to
David as a contribution towards the building of the Temple, and Solomon
placed them round the door of the altar. Nebuchadnezzar carried them
away to Babylon, and gave them to certain royal Persian hostages, who
took <span id="page_213">p. 213</span> them to Persia and gave them to
their parents. When the Magi set out for Jerusalem they took the thirty
pieces with their other offerings out with them they bought from certain
shepherds at Edessa "the garment without seam," which an angel had given
to them. Abgar, king of Edessa, took the thirty pieces and the garment
from the shepherds, and sent them to Christ. Christ kept the garment and
sent the thirty pieces to the Jewish treasury. The priests gave them to
Judas Iscariot for betraying our Lord, but he repented and took them
back to the priests. After Judas hanged himself the priests purchased a
burial ground for strangers with the thirty pieces (*Book of the Bee*,
[chapter xliv](../bb/bb44)) . Another legend says that Joseph had the
thirty pieces, and that with them he bought spices to embalm Jacob. They
passed into the possession of the Queen of Sheba, who gave them to
Solomon (Sandeys, *Christmas Carols*, London, 1883, page lxxxiii).**\]**

 

\[The Circumcision of Christ.\]

   Now Christ was eight days old when the Magi presented their
offerings; and Mary received them at the very time when Joseph
circumcised Christ. In truth, Joseph circumcised Him according to the
Law, but he only went through (or imitated) the act of cutting, for no
\[flesh\] <span id="page_214">p. 214</span> whatsoever was cut off from
Him. For as \[a rod of\] iron passeth through the fire and cutteth the
rays thereof, without any part of it being cut off from it, so in like
manner was Christ circumcised without anything being taken from Him.

 

\[The Conversion of the Magi.\]

   And the Magi lived with the Child three days, and they saw the hosts
of heaven going up and coming down to Christ. And they heard the sound
\[<span id="fol_42a1"></span>Fol. 42*a*, col. 1\] of the praises of the
angels, who sang hymns and cried out, "Holy, Holy, Holy, Mighty God,
with whose praises the heavens and the earth are filled." And they were
in great fear, and in truth they believed in Christ, and said, "This is
the King Who hath come down from heaven and become man." And Perôzdhâdh
answered and said unto them, "Now know I that the prophecy of Isaiah is
true. For when I was in the school of the Hebrews I read in \[the Book
of\] Isaiah, and I found \[written\] therein thus: 'For unto us a child
is born, and unto us a son hath been given. And His Name shall be called
Wonderful, and Counsellor, and God, Giant of the Worlds'" ([Isa. ix.
6](../../bib/kjv/isa.htm#9:6)). And it is written in another place,
"Behold, a virgin is with child, and she shall bring forth a son, and
his name shall be called <span id="page_215">p. 215</span> 'Emmanuel,'
which is, being interpreted, 'God with us'" ([Isa. vii.
14](../../bib/kjv/isa.htm#7:14)). And because He became like a man, and
the angels were coming down \[<span id="fol_42a2"></span>Fol. 42*a*,
col. 2\] from heaven to Him, truly He is the Lord of angels and men. And
all the Magi believed and said, "Truly this King is God. Kings are born
unto us frequently, and mighty men, the sons of mighty men, are born
unto us on earth, but it is an unheard-of thing for the angels to come
down to them." And straightway they all rose up, and did homage to Him
as the Lord and King of the world. And having prepared food for their
journey, they went down to their own country by a desert road.

 

\[The Massacre of the Innocents.\]

   Now, there are certain men who will dispute this \[statement\] and
say, "Where was Christ when the children were massacred, for it is
written that He was not found in the land of Judah?" It was because of
this massacre that He fled to Egypt, so that there might be fulfilled
that which is written \[<span id="fol_42b1"></span>Fol. 42*b*, col. 1\].
"From Egypt I called my Son" ([Hos. xi. 1](../../bib/kjv/hos.htm#11:1)).
And know this also. When Christ entered Egypt all the idols therein were
swept from their places, and fell down, and were broken, so that there
might be fulfilled that which is written, "Behold, the <span
id="page_216">p. 216</span> Lord rideth on a swift cloud, and entereth
Egypt, and the idols of Egypt shall be broken before Him" ([Isa. xix.
1](../../bib/kjv/isa.htm#19:1)).

 

   **\[**NOTE.--When Joseph and Mary and the Child reached the gate of
the city of Hermopolis, there were by the two buttresses of the gate two
figures of brass that had been made by the sages and philosophers; and
they spoke like men. When our Lord entered Egypt these two figures cried
out with a loud voice, saying, "A great king has come into Egypt." *Book
of the Bee* ([chapter xl.](../bb/bb40))**\]**

 

   And He did not return from Egypt \[at once\], but lived there until
Herod died, and after him reigned Archelaus.

   Now, thou must know, O my brother Nemesius, that, even as I have
already told thee, all the men who were under the rule of Herod were
\[included\] in that registration for taxation; and the registration was
completed in fifty days. And it was not until this registration was
completed and sealed, and until Herod had sealed it and sent it to
Augustus in Rome, that the Messiah was searched for; up to that time
\[<span id="fol_42b2"></span>Fol. 42*b*, col. 2\] no children had been
slain. And it was during the commotion caused by that registration that
Christ was born. When forty <span id="page_217">p. 217</span> days after
His birth had been fulfilled, Christ went into the Temple of the Lord.
And Simeon the Aged, the son of Joshua bar-Yôzâdhâ<u>k</u>, in whose
days the captivity went up from Babel, took Him in his arms. Now, Simeon
was five hundred years old when he took Christ in his arms.

 

\[The Flight into Egypt.<span id="page_217_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_217_note_1)\]

   And straightway the angel said unto Joseph, "Arise, take the young
Child and His mother, and flee into Egypt." And when the registration
was completed, the Jews were dismissed, so that each man might depart to
his own district and to his own village.

 

\[Herod and John the Baptist.\]

   Then did Herod enquire for the Magi, and when he was told, "they have
gone back to their own country," he was exceedingly wroth, and he sent
straightway and slew all the young children in Bethlehem, and in all the
villages round about. And when Herod had passed among the \[<span
id="fol_43a1"></span>Fol. 43*a*, col. 1\] slain children, and they did
not find there \[the body of\] John, the son of Zacharias, he said,
<span id="page_218">p. 218</span> "Truly, his son will reign over
Israel." For he had heard of what had been said unto Zacharias by the
angel, when he announced to him concerning \[the birth of\] John. And
Herod sent to Zacharias \[and commanded him\] to bring John, and
Zacharias said, "I am a priest, and I minister in the Temple of the
Lord; I do not know where the Child and his mother are." And because of
these words Zacharias was slain between the bench (or, steps) and the
altar. Now, Elizabeth had taken John and gone forth into the desert.

 

\[The Death of Herod.\]

   And as for Herod, a divine punishment that was pitiless overtook him,
and he fell ill of a sickness through which he stank, and his body
melted away into a mass of worms, and he suffered most grievous pains,
and at length people were unable to come near him because of his putrid
smell. And through that bitter suffering \[<span
id="fol_43a2"></span>Fol. 43*a*, col. 2\] his soul departed into outer
darkness. Nevertheless, by his death he destroyed many.

 

   **\[**NOTE.--First of all, he slew his wife and his daughter, and he
killed one man of every family, saying, "At the time of my death there
shall be mourning and weeping and lamentation in <span id="page_219">p.
219</span> the whole city." His bowels and his legs were swollen with
running sores, and matter flowed from them, and he was consumed by
worms. He had nine wives and thirteen children. There was a knife in his
hand, and he was eating an apple; and by reason of the severity of his
pain, he drew the knife across his throat, and cut it with his own hand;
and his belly burst open, and he died and went to perdition. An evil
fate also overtook Bôzîyâ, the daughter of Herodias, who begged for the
head of John the Baptist on a charger. Having given the saint's head to
her mother, she went out to dance upon the ice, but the ice broke and
she sank into the water up to her neck, and no one could deliver her. At
length men came with the sword which had been used in beheading John,
and they cut off Bôzîyâ's head and gave it to her mother. The right hand
with which Herodias took up John's head withered, and when she saw the
heads of the saint and her daughter she became blind, and Satan entered
her and bound her with fetters. See *Book of the Bee* (chapters
[xxxix](../bb/bb39) and [xli](../bb/bb41)).**\]**

 

   Now Herod had said unto Archelaus his son, and unto Shâlôm his
sister, "Immediately I am dead, let those whom I have fettered in prison
be slain"--now he had imprisoned one person from <span id="page_220">p.
220</span> every house. And he said, "I know that the Jews will feel
great joy at my death. But in order that they may not rejoice and be
glad whilst ye are sorrowful and are weeping, let all those whom I have
shut up in prison be slain, so that through their death they may cause
lamentation unintentionally." And Archelaus and Shâlôm did as Herod
commanded them, and when this order had been carried out in all Judea
there remained not one house in which there was not lamentation, even as
it was in Egypt \[in days of old\].

 

\[Christ returns to Galilee.\]

   And when Herod died, and his death had been announced to Joseph, he
went back to Galilee. And when Christ was thirty years old \[<span
id="fol_43b1"></span>Fol. 43*b*, col. 1\] He was baptized by John. Now
John was in the desert all the days of his life, and he lived upon the
root which is called "Kâmû<u>s</u>," which is wild honey. \[According to
some this root was like unto a carrot.\] And in the twelfth year of the
kingdom of Tiberius Christ suffered.

 

\[Chronological statement.\]

   Understand now and see, O my brother Nemesius, that in the days of
Yârêd, in his fortieth year, the F<span class="small">IRST</span>
Thousand Years came to an end. In the six hundredth year of Noah <span
id="page_221">p. 221</span> the S<span class="small">ECOND</span>
Thousand Years came to an end. In the seventy-fourth year of Reu the
T<span class="small">HIRD</span> Thousand Years came to an end. In the
twenty-sixth year of Âhôr (Ehud) the F<span class="small">OURTH</span>
Thousand Years came to an end. In the second year of Cyrus the F<span
class="small">IFTH</span> Thousand Years came to an end. And in the five
hundredth year of the S<span class="small">IXTH</span> Thousand Years
Christ was born in His human form.

 

\[The Crucifixion of Christ.\]

   And know thou also that Christ dwelt \[<span
id="fol_43b2"></span>Fol. 43*b*, col. 2\] in Mary, and suffered in
Nazareth, and was born in Bethlehem, and was laid in a manger, and was
carried by Simeon in the Temple of Solomon, and was reared in Galilee,
and was anointed by Mary Magdalene, and ate the Passover in the house of
Nicodemus, the brother of Joseph of Râmethâ, and was bound in the house
of <u>H</u>annân, and was struck with a reed in the house of Caiaphas,
and embraced the pillar and was scourged with a whip in the Prætorium of
Pilate, and on Friday, on the first day of Nîsân (April), on the
fourteenth day of the moon, our Redeemer suffered.

   At the <span class="small">FIRST HOUR</span> of Friday God fashioned
Adam from the dust, and at the first hour of Friday Christ received
spittle from the sons of Adam.

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

   At the <span class="small">SECOND HOUR</span> of Friday the wild
beasts, and the cattle, and the feathered fowl gathered themselves
together \[<span id="fol_44a1"></span>Fol. 44*a*, col. 1\] to Adam, and
he gave names to them as they bowed their heads before him. And at the
second hour of Friday the Jews gathered themselves together against
Christ, and they gnashed their teeth at Him, even as the blessed David
said, "Many bulls have gathered together round about me, bulls of Bashan
have beset me round" ([Ps. xxii. 12](../../bib/kjv/psa.htm#22:12)).

   At the <span class="small">THIRD HOUR</span> of Friday a crown of
glory was placed on the head of Adam, and at the third hour of Friday
the crown of thorns was placed on the head of Christ.

   T<span class="small">HREE HOURS</span> was Adam in Paradise and
shining with splendour, and three hours was Christ in the Judgment Hall
being beaten by creatures that had been fashioned out of dust.

   At the <span class="small">SIXTH HOUR</span> Eve went up to the tree
of the transgression of the commandment, and at the sixth hour Christ
ascended the Cross, the Tree of Life.

   At the <span class="small">SIXTH HOUR</span> Eve gave unto Adam the
fruit of the gall of death \[<span id="fol_44a2"></span>Fol. 44*a*, col.
2\], and at the sixth hour the crowd of iniquity gave unto Christ
vinegar and gall.

   For <span class="small">THREE HOURS</span> Adam remained under the
Tree naked, and for three hours was Christ naked <span id="page_223">p.
223</span> on the wood of the Cross. And from the right side of Adam
went forth Eve, the mother of mortal offspring, and from the right side
of Christ went forth baptism, the mother of immortal offspring.

   On Friday Adam and Eve sinned, and on Friday their sin was remitted.

   On Friday Adam and Eve died, and on Friday they came alive.

   On Friday Death reigned over them, and on Friday they were freed from
his dominion.

   On Friday Adam and Eve went forth from Paradise, and on Friday our
Lord went into the grave.

   On Friday Adam and Eve became naked, and on Friday Christ stripped
\[<span id="fol_44b1"></span>Fol. 44*b*, col. 1\] Himself naked and
clothed them.

   On Friday Satan stripped Adam and Eve naked, and on Friday Christ
stripped naked Satan and all his hosts, and put them to shame openly.

   On Friday the door of Paradise was shut and Adam went forth, and on
Friday it was opened and a robber went in.

   On Friday the two-edged sword was given to the Cherub, and on Friday
Christ smote with the spear, and brake the two-edged sword.

   On Friday kingdom, and priesthood, and prophecy were given unto Adam,
and on Friday <span id="page_224">p. 224</span> priesthood, and kingdom,
and prophecy were taken from the Jews.

   At the <span class="small">NINTH HOUR</span> Adam went down into the
lowest depth of the earth from the height of Paradise, and at the ninth
hour Christ went down to the lowest depths of the earth, to those who
lay \[<span id="fol_44b2"></span>Fol. 44*b*, col. 2\] in the dust, from
the height of the Cross.

   Know also that Christ was like unto Adam in everything, even as it is
written. In that very place where Melchisedek ministered as a priest,
and where Abraham offered up his son Isaac as an offering, the wood of
the Cross was set up, and that self-same place is the centre of the
earth, and there the Four Quarters of the earth meet each other. For
when God made the earth His mighty power was running before it, and the
earth was running after it, and the power of God stood still and became
motionless in Golgotha; and that same place formeth the boundary of the
earth. When Shem took up the body of Adam, that same place, which is the
door of the earth, opened itself. And when Shem and Melchisedek had
deposited the body of Adam in the centre of the earth the Four Quarters
\[<span id="fol_45a1"></span>Fol. 45*a*, col. 1\] of the earth closed in
about it, and embraced Adam, and straightway that opening was closed
firmly, and all the children of Adam were not able to open it. And <span
id="page_225">p. 225</span> when the Cross of Christ, the Redeemer of
Adam and his sons, was set up upon it, the door of that place was opened
in the face of Adam. And when the Wood (*i.e.* the Cross) was fixed upon
it, and Christ was smitten with the spear, and blood and water flowed
down from His side, they ran down into the mouth of Adam, and they
became a baptism to him, and he was baptized.

   Now when the Jews crucified Christ on the Wood, they divided His
garments among them beneath the Cross, even as it is written. His tunic
was of purple, which is the raiment of royalty; and when they stripped
Him of the raiment of royalty Pilate would not permit the Jews \[<span
id="fol_45a2"></span>Fol. 45*a*, col. 2\] to array Him in ordinary
apparel, but only in the actual raiment of royalty, either purple or
scarlet. By both of these it might be known that He was a king. For it
is impossible for any other man to wear purple; only a king can do this.
And one of the Evangelists hath said, "The soldiers put on Him a purple
robe" ([Mark xv. 17](../../bib/kjv/mar.htm#15:17); [John xix.
2](../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#19:2), 5), and this is a true word and is
highly credible; and another Evangelist uses the word "scarlet "([Matt.
xxvii. 28](../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#27:28)), and he proclaimed what was
true. The scarlet garment indicateth to us blood, and the purple garment
water; for the scarlet one was like unto blood, and the <span
id="page_226">p. 226</span> purple one was like unto water. The scarlet
garment proclaimeth the joyful and immortal nature of man, and the
purple one the sad and mortal nature of man. Understand, therefore, O
our brother \[<span id="fol_45b1"></span>Fol. 45*b*, col. 1\] Nemesius,
that scarlet proclaimeth life.

   Now the spies said prophetically to Rahab, the harlot, "thou shalt
tie a thread of scarlet to the window" ([Joshua ii.
18](../../bib/kjv/jos.htm#2:18)) when they descended having been
\[well\] entreated by her. And through her they prefigured a certain
matter, for the window \[symbolized\] the side of our Lord Christ, and
the thread of scarlet His precious blood which produced life.

   And they (*i.e.* the Jews) wove a crown of spikes of thorn bushes,
and set it upon His head. And they arrayed Him in royal apparel, not
knowing what they were doing. And they bowed the knee, and made
obeisance unto Him, and they spake with their mouths, without being
compelled to do so, saying, "Hail to Thee, King of the Jews." Observe
ye, O my brethren, that not even in His death did He lack the \[sign
of\] royalty. And when the Jews and the soldiers who were the servants
of Herod and Pilate were struggling together to rend the tunic of Christ
\[<span id="fol_45b2"></span>Fol. 45*b*, col. 2\], to divide it among
them, they did so because they all eagerly desired the beauty of the
sight thereof. And the <span id="page_227">p. 227</span> centurion also
who watched the Cross himself testified before all the crowd, saying,
"Verily, this man is the Son of God." And this centurion said unto them,
"The orders which have been given to me do not permit me to rend the
apparel of royalty, but cast lots for it \[and we shall see\] to whom it
will come"; and when the Jews and the soldiers of the king had cast
lots, the lot fell upon one of the soldiers of Pilate. Now the tunic of
our Lord had no seam, but had been woven whole in one piece. And
whensoever there was a lack of rain in the place where it had been
deposited and taken care of, the people used to bring out the tunic, and
as soon as they lifted it up \[<span id="fol_46a1"></span>Fol. 46*a*,
col. 1\] towards heaven an abundance of rain fell. And also, whensoever
the soldier who had received it lacked rain for his crop, he brought out
the tunic, and it worked this miracle. Now the tunic was taken away by
force from the man who got it by Pilate, who sent it to the Emperor
Tiberius. To us this tunic indicateth the Orthodox Faith, which all the
nations \[joined\] together are unable to cleave.

   Three valuable gifts, than which there is nothing more valuable, were
given to the Jews in olden time, namely, royalty, priesthood, and
prophecy: prophecy by the hand of Moses, priesthood by the hand of
Aaron, and royalty <span id="page_228">p. 228</span> by the hand of
David. These three gifts which the generations and families of the
children of Israel had enjoyed for \[many\] years were taken from them
in one day; and they were stripped of all three of them, and became
aliens to them, that is to say, prophecy by the Cross, priesthood by the
rending of the tunic \[of Christ\], and royalty by the crown of thorns.
Moreover, that spirit of compassion (or propitiation) which had dwelt in
the Temple, in the Holy of Holies, forsook them and departed. And the
curtain (or veil) of the sanctuary was cleft in twain. And the Passover
fled from them, for they never celebrated another Passover in it. And
know, O my brethren, that when Pilate pressed them to go into the
Judgment Hall, they said unto him, "We are unable to go into the
Prætorium, because up to now we have not eaten the Passover."

   And when the sentence of death had been passed on our Lord by Pilate,
they (the Jews) made haste and went into the sanctuary \[<span
id="fol_46b1"></span>Fol. 46*b*, col. 1\] and brought out from thence
the carrying poles of the Ark of the Covenant, and out of them they made
the Cross of Christ. Verily it was meet that these pieces of wood which
used to carry the Covenant should also carry the Lord of the Covenant.
The Cross of Christ was formed of two pieces of wood which were of the
same height, and depth, and length, <span id="page_229">p. 229</span>
and breadth. And Paul the Apostle laboured exceedingly that the Gentiles
might know what was the might of the Cross, which embraced the height,
and depth, and length, and breadth of the earth. And when they raised up
Christ, the Lamp of Light of all the earth, and set Him upon the
candlestick of the Cross, the light of the sun became dark, and was
extinguished, and a covering of darkness was spread over the whole
earth. Three nails were driven into the body of our Redeemer, two
through His hands, and one through both His feet. And there were two
thieves \[with Him\], one on His right hand and one on His left hand.

   And they handed out to Him vinegar and gall in a sponge. By the
vinegar which they gave unto Him it was made known concerning them that
their will was changed from what it had been formerly, and that they had
turned themselves from integrity to wickedness, and by the gall was made
known the bitterness of the accursed serpent which was in them. And they
showed that they also had belonged to that good vineyard from which
prophets, and kings, and priests, and they themselves had drunk; but
because they had become wicked heirs, who would not labour in the
vineyard of my beloved, they produced husks instead of grapes, and the
wine which they pressed out therefrom was <span id="page_230">p.
230</span> sour. And having crucified the Heir on the Wood, they mixed
some of the impurity of their wickedness with their sour wine \[<span
id="fol_47a1"></span>Fol. 47*a*, col. 1\], and gave Him to drink of the
wine from the vineyard of the Gentiles; but He would not drink
\[saying\], "Give me of that vine which My Father brought out of Egypt."
For Christ knew that the prophecy of Moses which had been prophesied
concerning them had been fulfilled in them; for Moses said, "Your grapes
are grapes of gall, your clusters are bitter. Your poison is the poison
of the serpent, and their head is that of a malignant viper. These are
the things which ye render unto the Lord" ([Deut. xxxii.
32](../../bib/kjv/deu.htm#32:32), 33).

   Observe, O my brother Nemesius, that the blessed Moses with the eye
of the Spirit foresaw the things which they were going to do to Christ
\[and said\], "These are the things which ye render to the Lord." The
congregation of the crucifiers was a decayed vine, its daughters were
bitter grapes, and its sons were clusters of gall. Their head was
Caiaphas, the malignant viper, and they were all evil serpents, and all
of them were filled with \[<span id="fol_47a2"></span>Fol. 47*a*, col.
2\] the venom of Satan, who is the Evil Serpent. Instead of the water of
the rock which had been given them to drink in the wilderness, they gave
Him vinegar to drink, and instead of manna, the gall of the <span
id="page_231">p. 231</span> quail. They did not give Him a cup to drink
from, but a sponge, so that they might show that the blessing of their
fathers had been swept away from them. Now this is evident from what
follows: When a vessel is empty and there is no wine in it, they wash
and wipe it with a sponge. Even so did the Jews do when they crucified
Christ, \[for\] with a sponge they wiped away and removed from
themselves royalty, and priesthood, and prophecy, and the religion of
Christ, and gave them to Christ, and the vessels of their bodies washed
and empty remained only.

   And the Law and the Prophets having been fulfilled, and Adam having
been sent and seen the fountain of living water which was poured out
from above for his redemption \[<span id="fol_47b1"></span>Fol. 47*b*,
col. 1\], then was Christ smitten with the spear, and blood and water
flowed down from His side; but they were not mingled with each other.
For what reason did the blood come forth before the water? For two
reasons: First, that through the blood life might be given unto Adam,
and then, after life and resurrection, the water for his baptism.
Secondly, that through the blood He might show that He was immortal, and
through the water He might show that He was mortal, and a bearer of
sufferings. The blood and the water ran down into the mouth of Adam,
<span id="page_232">p. 232</span> and Adam was redeemed, and put on a
garment of glory. And Christ wrote the edict of His return with the
blood of His own Person, and despatched it by the thief.

   And when an end had been made of everything, the writ of repudiation
of the congregation was written, and the congregation became a thing
cast aside, and it was stripped of its glorious raiment, even as in
times of old \[<span id="fol_47b2"></span>Fol. 47*b*, col. 2\] David
had, through the Holy Spirit, said and prophesied, saying, "Even unto
the horns of the altar" ([Ps. cxviii. 22](../../bib/kjv/psa.htm#118:22)
?)--to this pass were the festivals of the Jews brought. "Unto the horns
of the altar" \[means\] to the crucifixion of Christ, that is to say:

\[The end of the two and sixty weeks.\]

   Observe, O our brother Nemesius, how the generations and families
have succeeded each other; from Adam to the Jews, and the Jews also from
one \[generation\] to another until the Cross of Christ. From that time
and onwards the festivals of the Jews have ceased, even as the blessed
David saith concerning them: "Bind our festivals with chains even to the
horns of the altar" ([Ps. cxviii. 27](../../bib/kjv/psa.htm#118:27)).
The chains are the families which are linked each to the other, and the
altar is the Cross of Christ. The festivals of the Jews succeeded each
other until the Cross of Christ, in priesthood, and royalty, and
prophecy, and Passover; but from the Cross of Christ up to the present
they all have ceased, even as I have said \[<span
id="fol_48b2"></span>Fol. 48*b*, col. 2\]. The Jews have no longer among
them a king, or a priest, or a prophet, or <span id="page_235">p.
235</span> a Passover, even as Daniel prophesied concerning them,
saying, "After two and sixty weeks Christ shall be slain, and the city
of holiness shall be laid waste until the completion of things decreed"
([Dan. ix. 26](../../bib/kjv/dan.htm#9:26)). That is to say, for ever
and ever.

 

\[Christ's body is embalmed and laid in the tomb made for Joshua, the
son of Nôn.\]

   And when the end of all the Law and the Prophets had come, and Christ
was hanging on the Cross, Joseph, the brother of Nicodemus and Cleophas,
went in to Pilate--now he was the bearer of the seal-ring of Pilate, and
was a councillor, and had free intercourse with him--and asked for the
body of our Redeemer; and Pilate commanded that it should be given to
him. And when Joseph had taken His body, straightway Pilate commanded
that \[<span id="fol_49a1"></span>Fol. 49*a*, col. 1\] the garden also
in which the grave was situated should be given to him; it belonged to
Joseph, and it had been given unto him as an inheritance by Phinehas,
the Levite, the son of Joseph's uncle. Now Joseph was from Jerusalem,
but he had been made a councillor in Râmthâ, and all the letters which
had been written during the whole period of Pilate's administration had
been sealed with the seal which Joseph carried. And when Joseph had
taken down the body of our Lord <span id="page_236">p. 236</span> from
the Cross, the Jews ran and took the Cross, and brought it into the
Temple, because \[the pieces of wood thereof\] were the bearing poles of
the Ark of the Covenant. And Nicodemos also embalmed the body of our
Lord \[and swathed it\] in clean, new linen swathings, and Joseph made
it ready for the grave and buried it in a new tomb which had been made
for Joshua, the son of Nôn, to be buried in. And because he saw with the
eye of the Spirit \[<span id="fol_49a2"></span>Fol. 49*a*, col. 2\], and
the way of the Dispensation of Christ had appeared to him, he took the
stone which had travelled about with the children of Israel in the
desert and placed it at the door of the tomb, and therefore he was not
buried in it. And when Joseph, and Nicodemus, and Cleophas had buried
Christ, they laid that stone before the door of the building of the
tomb. And the high priests, and men of the house of Pilate, went out and
set seals on the grave and on the stone.

 

\[The Cross of Christ.\]

   And now, my brother Nemesius, be amazed and give praise to God that
all the straps (or, ligatures) of the . . . . . . of Christ were joined
together on the bearing poles of the Ark of the service of God and the
covering of the sanctuary of propitiation. This was what God commanded
Moses: to make a breast-plate of judgment <span id="page_237">p.
237</span> ([Exod. xxviii. 15](../../bib/kjv/exo.htm#28:15)) and of
peace; of judgment for the Jews who crucified Him \[<span
id="fol_49b1"></span>Fol. 49*b*, col. 1\], and of peace for the Gentiles
who have believed in him. His Cross was made of the wood of the
Sanctuary, His grave was a new one, which had been made for the death of
Joshua, the son of Nôn, and the stone (or rock), which is Christ, had
when in the desert given water to six hundred thousand people, and now
it became an altar and gave life to all the Gentiles. And the saying of
the Apostle, "that rock was Christ" ([I Cor. x.
4](../../bib/kjv/co1.htm#10:4)) is true and well worthy of belief.
Joseph was a councillor in Râmthâ, Nicodemus was a teacher of the Law in
Jerusalem, and Cleophas was the recorder of the Hebrews in \`Amâôs.
Nicodemus prepared everything which was required for the Passover in the
Upper Chamber; and Joseph made Him ready for burial and buried Him in
his own inheritance, and Cleophas received Him into his house. And when
\[<span id="fol_49b2"></span>Fol. 49*b*, col. 2\] He had risen from the
dead these men became to Him true and faithful brethren.

 

\[The trilingual inscription above the Cross.\]

   And when Joseph brought Him down from the Cross, he took away that
inscription which was spread out above His head, that is to say, over
the head of the Cross of Christ, because it <span id="page_238">p.
238</span> had been written by Pilate in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew.
And why did Pilate write in it no word of the Syrians? Because the
Syrians participated in no way whatsoever in the \[shedding of the\]
blood of Christ. And Pilate, a wise man and a lover of the truth, did
not wish to write a lie as wicked judges do, but he did according to
what is written in the Law of Moses. Pilate wrote in the inscription
\[the names of the languages of\] those who condemned the innocent in
the order in which the slayers of Christ laid their hands upon him, and
he hung the writing above Him. Herod was a Greek, Caiaphas was \[<span
id="fol_50a1"></span>Fol. 50*a*, col. 1\] a Hebrew, and Pilate a Roman.
Now the Syrians had no part in the murder of Christ, and to this
testifieth Abhgar, king of Edessa, who wished to take Jerusalem and
destroy it because the Jews crucified Christ. \[See Cureton, *Doctrine
of Addai*, ed. Phillips, page 30; Cureton, *Ancient Syrian Documents*,
page 107; and Wright, *Journal of Sacred Literature*, No. XX, New
Series, January, 1865.**\]**

 

\[The Harrowing of Hell.\]

   Now the descent of Sheol was not in vain, for it was the cause of
manifold benefits to our race. He dismissed Death from his domination.
He preached the resurrection to those who were lying in the dust, and He
pardoned those who <span id="page_239">p. 239</span> had sinned against
the Law. He laid waste Sheol, and slew sin. He put Satan to shame, and
made the devils sad, and He abrogated sacrifices and offerings and made
an apology for Adam, and abolished the festivals of the Jews.

 

   **\[**NOTE.--According to the Coptic *Book of the Resurrection*,
which is attributed to Bartholomew the Apostle, Christ broke down the
doors of hell, and smashed the bolts, and destroyed the doorposts and
frames. He overthrew the blazing furnaces of brass, and extinguished
their fires, and, sweeping everything out of hell, He left it like a
desert. He fettered the "Shameless One," and bound the ministers of
Satan, and tied up a devil called Melkhir with a chain. *See* British
Museum MS. Oriental No. 6804, and Budge, *Coptic Apocrypha*, page
184.**\]**

 

\[The Resurrection of Christ.\]

   And having risen from the grave on the third day, Christ appeared to
<u>K</u>îpâ (Peter) and John.

   And whilst \[<span id="fol_50a2"></span>Fol. 50*a*, col. 2\] Christ
was in the grave, and the watchmen were sitting round about it, Simon
Peter conceived the design of giving the watchmen wine to drink so that
they might become drunk and fall asleep, when he intended to rise up and
open the tomb, and take out the body of Christ without breaking the
<span id="page_240">p. 240</span> seals on the tomb, so that the Jews
might not say, "Assuredly His disciples stole Him away." And whilst the
watchmen were eating and drinking, Christ rose up and showed Himself to
<u>K</u>îpâ (Peter), for He had indeed risen. And Peter believed that He
was truly Christ, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and did not
approach the tomb. And afterwards Christ also appeared to the watchmen
openly, and He went to His disciples in the Upper Chamber, and Thomas
felt Him. And He appeared to His disciples on the sea shore. Now, though
Simon Peter denied Him thrice before the Jews, he acknowledged Him
thrice \[<span id="fol_50b1"></span>Fol. 50*b*, col. 1\] before the
disciples. And Christ delivered to him and committed to his hands all
His flock, saying, before His disciples, "Feed thou for Me My sheep and
lambs and ewes," that is to say, men, women and children. And forty days
after His Resurrection He bestowed upon the Apostles the laying on of
hands of the priesthood, and He went up to heaven, and sat down on the
right hand of His Father.

   Then the Apostles gathered themselves together and went up into the
Upper Chamber with Mary, the Holy Virgin, and Simon Peter baptized Mary,
and John, the virgin, received her \[into his house\]. And they decreed
a fast until they had received the Spirit, the Paraclete, <span
id="page_241">p. 241</span> at Pentecost, they all being gathered
together. And tongues (*i.e.* languages) were distributed among them, so
that each of them might go and teach that nation in the tongue which he
had received, so that there might never be strife among them. \[<span
id="fol_50b2"></span>Fol. 50*b*, col. 2\].
