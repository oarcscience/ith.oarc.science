ABRAHAM AND THE CITY OF UR.

   The paragraphs which the author of the "Cave Treasures" devotes to
the history of Terah and Abraham throw new light upon the lives of these
patriarchs and the conditions under which they lived in the city of Ur,
and they contain many interesting details which are not recorded in the
Book of Genesis, and some new information concerning the overthrow of
the city of Ur by the "Wind Flood." It is quite clear that Terah and
Abraham were great, powerful and wealthy shêkhs, and their large flocks
of sheep and goats and herds of camels suggest that they were owners and
breeders of cattle on a large scale, and masters of caravans. The three
hundred and eighteen trained men, born in his house ([Gen. xiv.
14](../../bib/kjv/gen.htm#14:14).md), whom Abraham armed and sent forth to
rescue Lot, his nephew, were probably the armed guards who marched with
his flocks and herds and caravans and protected them. Up to the present
no person <span id="page_274">p. 274</span> mentioned in the cuneiform
inscriptions can be identified either with Terah or Abraham, but all the
facts which the recent excavations at Ur have brought to light show that
in Abraham's day the inhabitants of the city were given up wholly to
idolatry, their chief object of worship being Nannar, the Moon-god. Not
only did Abraham smash his father's idols, but under the divine guidance
he freed himself from the custom of offering up his firstborn to devils.
Further, when he saw his city attacked by hosts of enemies from the
north and from the low-lying lands to the south, there was nothing left
for him to do but migrate to the country which God promised to give him.
Putting all the evidence together, it is clear that Abraham was a great,
strong and independent chief in Babylonia, and that his power waxed
greater when he established himself at <u>H</u>arrân. The rescue of Lot
shows that his armed retainers formed an effective military body, and
the greatness of his might and influence is proved by the fact that he
compelled Ephron the Hittite to sell him the cave of Machpelah. And the
Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who seized Sarah, would hardly have listened to
Abraham's objections unless he knew that Abraham had a following strong
enough to make his restitution of Sarah a necessity.

THE EXCAVATIONS AT UR OF THE CHALDEES.

   Of the greatness and importance of Ur of the Chaldees politically and
commercially, the excavations which Mr. C. L. Woolley has conducted for
the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania during the last
five years afford abundant evidence. In my little book, *Babylonian Life
and History*, London, 1925, I gave a brief summary of what had been done
up to the time of going to press, and it is necessary to describe the
progress of the work during the winters of **1924-25** and **1925-26**.
The facts are derived from Mr. Woolley's official reports, published in
the *Antiquaries' Journal*, Vol. V, No. 4, and Vol. VI, No. 4. As
already said, the Ziggurat which stands in the west corner of the
Temenos enclosure was cleared during the winter of 1923-24, and in
**1924-25** work was begun on the Temenos or Sacred Area itself. A good
general view of the site already excavated is given on <span
id="pl03"></span>[Plate III](bct_pl03.md). Already in 1925, Mr. Woolley was
able to report as follows: "Summarizing our results in this part of the
field, we can say that we have now a complete plan of the Ziggurat and
its surroundings in the Neo-Babylonian period after the wholesale
reconstructions of Nebuchadnezzar II and Nabonidus, the complete plan of
the Kassite period for three <span id="page_276">p. 276</span> sides of
the Ziggurat, a good part of the plan of the buildings of the Larsa
period (2000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), and that of Ur-Engur's
(*i.e.* Ur-Nammu's) work on one side of the tower, together with a
general idea of its lines on two of the other sides." The Ziggurat of
Ur-Nammu was built on a terrace which on this side had a width of 34
metres, and cones of baked clay bearing Ur-Nammu's dedication of the
building E-temen-ni-il had been inserted in the vertical joints of the
brickwork. For the first time these cones were found in their original
position. A specimen of these cones is given on <span
id="pl04-1"></span>[Plate IV](bct_pl04.md). Ur-Nammu built E Nannar, or
Temple of the Moon-god, on the terrace level of E-temen-ni-il. During
the Larsa period Ur-Nammu's buildings were reconstructed, and prominent
among the kings who carried out this work were Sinidinnam (2086-2080
<span class="small">B.C.</span>) and Warad Sin (2072-2060 <span
class="small">B.C.</span>). Cones and other monuments show that
En-an-na-tum, high-priest of Nannar, and son of king Ishme-Dagan, and
Sumu-ilum, who built a temple to Innina, and Silli-Adad, and Kudur Mabug
had all worked here.

   The principal builder at Ur during the Kassite period was Kuri-Galzu,
but his work was not of the best kind, and as his successors did no
repairs on his buildings, they fell into decay. The arched doorway which
he built in the <span id="page_277">p. 277</span> sanctuary of
E-Dublal-maḫ is shown on <span id="pl04-2"></span>[Plate IV](bct_pl04.md).
For seven hundred years nothing of importance in connection with the
temple buildings at Ur was done. Nebuchadnezzar II and his grandson
practically rebuilt the public buildings at Ur. They found the ancient
shrines so hopelessly destroyed or so completely buried that on a
traditional site they were able to employ a new design or radically to
reshape the old, and even to change the location of a sanctuary whose
name alone perhaps survived. Under the rule of the Persians the city
gradually sunk into ruin and decay.

   To the south-east of the Ziggurat stood the Temple of Nin-gal, which
was built by Sinbalatsu-ikbi (*see* the door socket of this king on
<span id="pl08-1"></span>[Plate VIII](bct_pl08).md), the Assyrian governor
of Ur (650 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), and was restored by
Nabonidus. Mr. Woolley's excavations showed that it was built on the
site of the first temple of Nin-gal, which dated from the reign of
Kuri-Galzu in the XIVth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>

   To the south-east of the temple E-Nun-Ma<u>h</u> are the temple
E-Dublal-Ma<u>h</u>, the work of Kuri-Galzu (<span
id="pl05"></span>[Plate V](bct_pl05).md), and the E-Gig-Par which was built
by Nabonidus (<span id="pl06"></span>[Plate VI](bct_pl06).md). The latter
building is 95 metres long and 50 metres wide, and is oriented N.W. and
S.E., and there is no doubt that it was the <span id="page_278">p.
278</span> convent in which Bêl-Shalti-Nannar, daughter of Nabonidus and
sister of Belshazzar, ruled as Lady Superior of the sacred women of Ur.
In the rooms of this convent were found a very large number of small but
important objects, *e.g.* gate sockets, sculptured reliefs,
school-exercise tablets, teaching tablets, tablets marked with squares
in lines used in playing games, etc., and one room was used as a Museum,
for it contained inscribed objects with labels attached for teaching
purposes! The remains found in E-Dublal-Ma<u>h</u> included portions of
a statue, dating from 2800 <span class="small">B.C.</span>; a limestone
plaque with reliefs representing the worship of Nannar (<span
id="pl13-1"></span>[Plate XIII](bct_pl13), No. 1.md); portions of the great
stele of Ur-Nammu (<span id="pl11-2"></span>[Plate XI](bct_pl11.md), No.
2); alabaster rams forming the sides of a throne (<span
id="pl13-2"></span>[Plate XIII](bct_pl13), No. 2.md); etc.

   During the winter of **1925-26**, Mr. Woolley and his men excavated
the great Gig-Par-ku site at Ur. The earliest buildings of which any
actual ruins were found belonged to the period of the First Dynasty of
Ur (about 4000-3500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>). In digging down to
trace the Third Dynasty foundations, they found a short section of a
wall constructed with kiln-burnt plano-convex bricks set over a
foundation of rough limestone blocks, a wall identical in every respect
with that of the temple built by king <span id="page_279">p. 279</span>
A-an-nî-pad-da at Al-\`Ubêd. Among the buildings of the Third Dynasty of
Ur (2300 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) was the temple of Ur-Nammu,
but remains of its walls are wanting. Thirteen gate sockets were found,
and the inscription on them reads, "Ur-Nammu, the mighty man, the king
of Ur, the king of Sumer and Akkad, has built the splendid Gig-Par for
his Lady Nin-Gal" (<span id="pl07-2"></span>[Plate VII](bct_pl07.md), Nos.
2 and 3). On the ruins of Ur-Nammu's temple his grandson Bur-Sin built a
temple which was dedicated by him to the goddess Nin-Gal. An inscribed
door socket of Bur-Sin is shown on <span id="pl08-2"></span>[Plate
VIII](bct_pl08.md). This temple was probably destroyed about 2000 <span
class="small">B.C.</span> by the Elamites, who captured the city and
brought the rule of the Third Dynasty of Ur to an end.

   The next temple that occupied the site was built by En-an-na-tum, son
of Ishme-Dagan, king of Isin. The building was rectangular and measured
79 metres by 76½ metres, and its angles were oriented to the cardinal
points of the compass. It was surrounded by a massive wall, and had two
entrances; at the east angle was a gate tower. The building was divided
into three parts by the cross corridor, and by a wall running parallel
with it; it contained two temples, several small shrines, and a
considerable number of small rooms, in which the priests and priestesses
lived. Some of the rooms were used <span id="page_280">p. 280</span> as
kitchens and pantries, and some as sepulchral chambers in which the
bodies of dead priests were buried. A view of the great kitchen in Gig
Par Ku is given on <span id="pl09"></span>[Plate IX](bct_pl09.md). The
building supplies a complete plan of an early Sumerian sanctuary, which
has hitherto been wanting. The temple flourished in a greater or lesser
degree all through the reign of <u>H</u>ammurabi, and down to the
eleventh year of the reign of his son Samsu-iluna; its destruction
probably took place during, or as a result of, the revolt which took
place in the following year. Among the important objects found in the
ruins may be mentioned:--1. A diorite statuette of the goddess Eau, the
great "World- Mother" (<span id="pl10"></span>[Plate X](bct_pl10).md),
which was made about 2400 <span class="small">B.C.</span> 2. Diorite
statuette of the goddess Nin-Gal (about 2080 <span
class="small">B.C.</span>). 3. A limestone plaque on which are
sculptured scenes of worship (about 3000 <span
class="small">B.C.</span>) (<span id="pl11-1"></span>[Plate
XI](bct_pl11), No. 1.md). 4. An alabaster model of the lunar disk dedicated
to Nannar by the daughter of Sargon of Agade (about 2630 <span
class="small">B.C.</span>). 5. A granite bowl of Naram-Sin of Agade
(2550 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), which about 300 years later
(about 2250 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) was presented to the temple
at Ur by the daughter of king Dungi (or, Shulgi).

   The excavation of the "Palace Site "has yielded much useful
information, and the further exploration of the so-called Tomb Mound has
<span id="page_281">p. 281</span> laid bare the foundations of many
houses, and yielded many small, but interesting, antiquities, tablets,
terra-cotta figures, cylinder seals, pottery, etc. Among the tablets
were several dating from the period of Rim-Sin (1980 <span
class="small">B.C.</span>); these were inscribed with hymns and
religious texts written in honour of the Moon-god Nannar.

   Mr. C. L. Woolley resurned work at Ur on October 28, 1926, and
continued the excavations until February, 1927, when want of funds
brought his operations to a standstill. The results of his labours
during the past winter are of extraordinary importance, and through the
courtesy of Sir Frederic Kenyon, Director of the British Museum, and the
late Dr. Byron Gordon, Director of the Museum of the University of
Pennsylvania at Philadelphia, I am enabled to describe them briefly in
the following pages.

   The site first selected for work during the past winter was a lofty
mound outside the wall built by Nebuchadnezzar II round the Sacred Area,
and when a space measuring 200 feet by 150 feet was cleared, several
blocks of houses, divided by narrow streets, were found. Hitherto the
Expedition had excavated only temples and fortifications which, after
all, tell us little or nothing about the private daily life of Abraham's
neighbours, but Mr. Woolley felt that the time had come for him to
explore the ruins of the <span id="page_282">p. 282</span> houses of the
merchants and the poorer class of inhabitants of "Ur of the Chaldees,"
and the results he obtained greatly exceeded his expectations. When a
house fell down in Babylonia the ruins were levelled and another house
was built on them, and in some mounds several layers of houses, each
layer belonging to a different period, have been identified. On the site
selected by Mr. Woolley the rains and winds and storms of four thousand
years had removed all the more modern layers of houses, and he was able
to get to work at once on a fine collection of houses which were built
about 2100 <span class="small">B.C.</span> The main walls being built of
burnt brick, were in a good state of preservation; the interior walls
were of mud brick, laid on burnt brick foundations, which rose two or
three feet above the brick-paved floor. Thus the foundations formed a
"damp course," and the state of the walls showed that the dwellers in
the houses were not troubled by damp. The visitor, on passing through
the doorway, entered a small ante-chamber, which led into the courtyard;
this was partly covered in. The reception room was on one side, and the
kitchen and pantry, etc., were on the other. The bedrooms of the family
were on the upper floor, which were entered from a wooden gallery
running round all four sides of the court yard. <span id="page_284">p.
284</span> Close to the front door was the stairway, the treads of which
are made of solid brick. The walls of these houses are still about 20
feet in height, and the plan of them and the general arrangement of the
rooms on the ground floor and upper floor are reproduced to this day in
the houses of merchants and well-to-do folk at Baghdâd and Hillah. There
is little doubt that it was in houses of this kind that Serug, Terah,
Nahor and Abraham lived. The houses and their courtyards stood side by
side in rows, as at the present day; the streets then as now were
narrow. An excellent representation of a street is given on <span
id="pl12"></span>[Plate XII](bct_pl12.md). {See <span
id="p283"></span>[page 283](bct_p283.md) for a drawing of the interior of a
private house.}

   When the master of the house died he was usually buried under it,
together with his engraved stone cylinder-seal, pots, and inscribed clay
tablets. As was to be expected, no furniture of any shape or kind was
found in the houses, and even the burial places under them had been
rifled. But, in spite of this, Mr. Woolley succeeded in collecting from
the site a considerable number of clay tablets inscribed with tables of
square and cube roots, hymns, and records of the buildings erected by
various kings of Ur. Among the miscellaneous objects found may be
mentioned a bottle of blue and black glass which probably came from
Syria; this interesting object was probably made about 1500 <span
class="small">B.C.</span>.

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

   The works that were carried out after the excavation of the houses
was finished threw much light upon the history of Ur in the first half
of the third minennium <span class="small">B.C.</span> There is now no
doubt that a temple tower or Ziggurat existed at Ur as early as 2800
<span class="small">B.C.</span>, for portions of its walls made of
plano-convex mud bricks were found buried under the Ziggurat made by
Ur-Nammu 2600 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Under the temple of
E-nin-makh a very interesting object was discovered in the shape of the
cover of an ivory toilet box bearing a Phoenician inscription (*see*
<span id="pl14-1"></span>[Plate XIV](bct_pl14), No. 1.md), and with it were
several articles for the toilet in ivory, and a beautifully engraved
comb. The remains of the royal buildings, which were erected about 2000
<span class="small">B.C.</span>, prove that the Sumerians, even at that
early period, were able to construct halls with arches and vaulted
roofs. It is clear that many of the statements which were made by
architectural authorities two or three generations ago will have to be
greatly modified in the light of the discoveries made at Ur. In a great
commercial centre like Ur accurate weights were of prime importance, and
the fine diorite duck-weight inscribed with the name of king Shulgi
shows that as early as 2500 <span class="small">B.C.</span> standard
weights were in use in Babylonia (*see* <span id="pl07-1"></span>[Plate
VII](bct_pl07), No. 1.md). This standard was in use in Babylonia two
thousand years later, as an inscription on a weight of Nebuchadnezzar II
testifies.

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

   The next portion of the site selected for careful excavation was the
area at the south-east end, inside the wall built by Nebuchadnezzar II,
where there were no buildings. A trench cut across it brought to light
an early cemetery, containing graves which were made not much later than
3000 <span class="small">B.C.</span> These graves yielded a large
quantity of pottery; vases in diorite, hard stone, alabaster, and
steatite, many of beautiful shape and design; copper bowls, vases, pots,
axe-heads, adzes, spears, razors, knives and daggers; gold, silver and
carnelian beads; lapis lazuli pins with heads of gold or silver;
cylinder-seals beautifully engraved; rock-crystal cylinder-seals with
copper caps and cores made of white or coloured paste; gold tiaras,
chains, finger-rings, ear-rings, beads, amulets, etc. All these show
that the crafts of the metal worker and the jeweller had reached a very
high state of perfection when the first kings of the Ist dynasty of Ur
began to reign in the second half of the fourth millennium <span
class="small">B.C.</span> When these graves were made they were only
about one foot below the level of the surrounding country, but now they
lie some 15 or 20 feet under the accumulated rubbish of fifty centuries.
The latest graves were, according to Mr. Woolley, made about 3000 <span
class="small">B.C.</span>, and the earliest some 500 years earlier.
Among the objects found in the <span id="page_287">p. 287</span>
lowermost layer of graves were two cylinder-seals each inscribed with
the name of a king of Ur who reigned over the city several hundreds of
years before its history as a great commercial centre began. In the
uppermost layer the cylinder-seals are inscribed with the names of
officers of the household of the daughter of Sargon of Agade, about 2600
<span class="small">B.C.</span> This princess was the High Priestess of
the Moon-god of Ur.

   The four principal methods of burial were as follows:--(1) The body,
in its ordinary apparel, was wrapped in a mat and laid on a mat at the
bottom of the grave; the vases, weapons, ornaments, etc., were placed
round about it. (2) The body was placed in a wickerwork coffin, together
with the small objects; the vessels in pottery, stone, etc., were
grouped round it. (3) The body was laid in a wooden coffin, with the
objects to be buried with it, some being enclosed in little coffers. (4)
The body was laid in an oval case made of clay. In the oldest graves of
all, traces of partial cremation were found. The problem of how the
early Sumerians disposed of their dead has now been solved. As the
Egyptians buried their dead on the west bank of the Nile, so also did
the Sumerians transport the bodies of their dead across the great canal
which flowed by the west wall of the city of Ur, and bury them in the
western desert.

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

   Before the close of the season cylinder-seals bearing the names of
five early kings, of whom three were unknown to history, were found.
From the lapis lazuli cylinder-seal of Queen Nin-Kur-Nin the name of her
husband Mes-anni-padda ![cuneiform](288.jpg.md), the founder of the Ist
dynasty of Ur has been recovered. Several of the kings of this dynasty
have hitherto been regarded as mythical.

   Below the black stratum which lies under the graves of the period of
3000 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the richest graves were found. Here
were discovered clay tablets, inscribed with a semi-pictographic script,
and seals bearing the names of kings unrecorded in history. Among the
other important "finds" may be mentioned:--(1) Eight shell plaques
decorated with linear patterns (*see* <span id="pl15"></span>[Plate
XV](bct_pl15).md) and animal figures; the lines are filled in with colour,
red and black. (2) A royal gaming board, which consists of 20 shell
plaques, decorated with linear designs and inlay of red paste and lapis
lazuli, and framed with lapis lazuli, ivory and mother-of-pearl. It is
the Sumerian equivalent of the so-called draught-boards which have been
found in Egyptian tombs, and seems to indicate that the Sumerians, as
well as the Egyptians, believed that their dead amused themselves by
playing some game like that of draughts in the Other World.

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

   But the greatest "find" of all was made just before the end of the
season. About 18 feet below the level of the ground Mr. Woolley came
upon a hoard of copper tools and weapons. This consisted of sets of
chisels and bundles of heavy spear-heads, and side by side with these
were two gold chisels and a gold spear-head. Further research brought to
light more copper weapons, arrows by the quiverful, lance-points, a
mace, axe-heads, and parts of bows. Round about these were pendants in
carnelian, lapis lazuli and gold, the gold binding for a bow, an adze of
solid gold, its wooden handle being covered with plaster painted red and
bound with thin gold. Lying a little apart was a silver baldric, to
which was attached a "vanity case" of gold filigree work, containing a
pair of tiny tweezers, spoon and stiletto, all of gold, hung upon a
silver ring. Close by was **a dagger** (*see* <span
id="pl14-2"></span>[Plate XIV](bct_pl14), No. 2.md). The hilt is formed of
one piece of deep-coloured lapis lazuli studded with gold, and the blade
is of burnished gold; the sheath is of solid gold. The back of the
latter is plain except for two lines of simple beading, but the front is
entirely covered with an intricate design in filigree work. The dagger
and its sheath are marvels of design and workmanship, and as they were
made at least fifty-five centuries ago, they are among the oldest and
finest specimens of the craft of the goldsmith in the world.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

   All the more important antiquities which have fallen to the share of
the Trustees of the British Museum are exhibited in the Babylonian Rooms
of the Museum, and are on view all day and every day. Mr. Woolley has
written and published in October each year in *The Antiquaries' Journal*
a detailed report, with excellent plans and a large number of
photographic plates, of the work done at Ur during the preceding winter,
and to these the reader who requires fuller and more detailed
information about the work is begged to refer. The Trustees of the
British Museum have also decided to publish a full scientific Report on
the work, with maps, plans, and photographs, and the first volume of it,
which deals with the discovery of the temple of A-an-ni-pad-da at Tall
al-\`Ubêd, near Ur, by Dr. H. R. Hall, and the completion of its
excavation by Mr. Woolley, has already appeared. A smaller work on the
temple of Tall al-\`Ubêd is being prepared by Dr. H. R. Hall, and Mr. C.
J. Gadd, of the British Museum, is writing the history of Ur from the
time of the Seven Wise Men who flourished before the Flood to the final
downfall and decay of the city about 300 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
