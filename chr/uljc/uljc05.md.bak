### A FESTIVAL IN A GONPA.

Leh, the capital of Ladak, is a little town of 5,000 inhabitants, who
live in white, two-story houses, upon two or three streets, principally.
In its centre is the square of the bazaar, where the merchants of India,
China, Turkestan, Kachmyr and Thibet, come to exchange their products
for the Thibetan gold. Here the natives provide themselves with cloths
for themselves and their monks, and various objects of real necessity.

An old uninhabited palace rises upon a hill which dominates the town.
Fronting the central square is a vast building, two

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

stories in height, the residence of the governor of Ladak, the Vizier
Souradjbal--a very amiable and universally popular Pendjaban, who has
received in London the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.

To entertain me, during my sojourn in Leh, the governor arranged, on the
bazaar square, a game of polo--the national sport of the Thibetans,
which the English have adopted and introduced into Europe. In the
evening, after the game, the people executed dances and played games
before the governor's residence. Large bonfires illuminated the scene,
lighting up the throng of inhabitants, who formed a great circle about
the performers. The latter, in considerable numbers, disguised as
animals, devils and sorcerers, jumped and contorted themselves in
rhythmic dances timed to the measure of

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

the monotonous and unpleasing music made by two long trumpets and a
drum.

The infernal racket and shouting of the crowd wearied me. The
performance ended with some graceful dances by Thibetan women, who spun
upon their heels, swaying to and fro, and, in passing before the
spectators in the windows of the residence, greeted us by the clashing
together of the copper and ivory bracelets on their crossed wrists.

The next day, at an early hour, I repaired to the great Himis convent,
which, a little distance from Leh, is elevated upon the top of a great
rock, on a picturesque site, commanding the valley of the Indies. It is
one of the principal monasteries of the country, and is maintained by
the gifts of the people and the subsidies it receives from Lhassa. On
the road leading to it, beyond the bridge

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

crossing the Indus, and in the vicinity of the villages lining the way,
one finds heaps of stones bearing engraved inscriptions, such as have
already been described, and *t’horthenes*. At these places, our guides
were very careful to turn to the right. I wished to turn my horse to the
left, but the Ladakians made him go back and led him by his halter to
the right, explaining to me that such was their established usage. I
found it impossible to learn the origin or reason of this custom.

Above the gonpa rises a battlemented tower, visible from a great
distance. We climbed, on foot, to the level on which the edifice stands
and found ourselves confronted by a large door, painted in brilliant
colors, the portal of a vast two-story building enclosing a court paved
with little pebbles. To the right, in one of the angles of the

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

court, is another huge painted door, adorned with big copper rings. It
is the entrance to the principal temple, which is decorated with
paintings of the principal gods, and contains a great statue of Buddha
and a multitude of sacred statuettes. To the left, upon a verandah, was
placed an immense prayer-cylinder. All the lamas of the convent, with
their chief, stood about it, when we entered the court. Below the
verandah were musicians, holding long trumpets and drums.

At the right of the court were a number of doors, leading to the rooms
of the lamas; all decorated with sacred paintings and provided with
little prayer-barrels fancifully surmounted by black and white tridents,
from the points of which floated ribbons bearing inscriptions--doubtless
prayers. In the centre of the court were raised two tall masts,

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

from the tops of which dangled tails of yaks, and long paper streamers
floated, covered with religious inscriptions. All along the walls were
numerous prayer-barrels, adorned with ribbons.

A profound silence reigned among the many spectators present. All
awaited anxiously the commencement of a religious "mystery," which was
about to be presented. We took up a position near the verandah. Almost
immediately, the musicians drew from their long trumpets soft and
monotonous tones, marking the time by measured beats upon an odd-looking
drum, broad and shallow, upreared upon a stick planted in the ground. At
the first sounds of the strange music, in which joined the voices of the
lamas in a melancholy chant, the doors along the wall opened
simultaneously, giving entrance

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

to about twenty masked persons, disguised as animals, birds, devils and
imaginary monsters. On their breasts they bore representations of
fantastic dragons, demons and skulls, embroidered with Chinese silk of
various colors. From the conical hats they wore, depended to their
breasts long multicolored ribbons, covered with inscriptions. Their
masks were white death's-heads. Slowly they marched about the masts,
stretching out their arms from time to time and flourishing with their
left hands spoon-shaped objects, the bowl portions of which were said to
be fragments of human crania, with ribbons attached, having affixed to
their ends human hair, which, I was assured, had been taken from scalped
enemies. Their promenade, in gradually narrowing circles about the
masts, soon became merely a confused

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

jostling of each other; when the rolling of the drum grew more
accentuated, the performers for an instant stopped, then started again,
swinging above their heads yellow sticks, ribbon-decked, which with
their right hands they brandished in menacing attitudes.

After making a salute to the chief lama, they approached the door
leading to the temple, which at this instant opened, and from it another
band came forth, whose heads were covered by copper masks. Their dresses
were of rich materials, embroidered in various bright colors. in one
hand each of them carried a small tambourine and with the other he
agitated a little bell. From the rim of each tambourine depended a
metallic ball, so placed that the least movement of the hand brought it
in contact with the

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

resonant tympanum, which caused a strange, continuous under-current of
pulsating sound. These new performers circled several times about the
court, marking the time of their dancing steps by measured thumpings of
the tambourines. At the completion of each turn, they made a deafening
noise with their instruments. Finally, they ran to the temple-door and
ranged themselves upon the steps before it.

For a moment, there was silence. Then we saw emerge from the temple a
third band of performers. Their enormous masks represented different
deities, and each bore upon its forehead "the third eye." At their head
marched Thlogan-Poudma-Jungnas (literally "he who was born in the lotus
flower"). Another richly dressed mask marched beside him, carrying a
yellow parasol covered with symbolic

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

designs. His suite was composed of gods, in magnificent costumes;
Dorje-Trolong and Sangspa-Kourpo (*i.e.*, Brahma himself), and others.
These masks, as a lama sitting near me explained to us, represented six
classes of beings subject to the metamorphoses; the gods, the demi-gods,
men, animals, spirits and demons.

On each side of these personages, who advanced gravely, marched other
masks, costumed in silks of brilliant hues and wearing on their heads
golden crowns, fashioned with six lotus-like flowers on each, surmounted
by a tall dart in the centre. Each of these masks carried a drum.

These disguises made three turns about the masts, to the sound of a
noisy and incoherent music, and then seated themselves on the ground,
around Thlogan-Pondma-Jungnas,

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

a god with three eyes, who gravely introduced two fingers into his mouth
and emitted a shrill whistle. At this signal, young men dressed in
warrior costumes--with ribbon-decked bells dangling about their
legs--came with measured steps from the temple. Their heads were covered
by enormous green masks, from which floated triangular red flags, and
they, too, carried tambourines. Making a diabolical din, they whirled
and danced about the gods seated on the ground. Two big fellows
accompanying them, who were dressed in tight clown costumes, executed
all kinds of grotesque contortions and acrobatic feats, by which they
won plaudits and shouts of laughter from the spectators.

Another group of disguises--of which the principal features were red
mitres and yellow

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

pantaloons--came out of the temple, with bells and tambourines in their
hands, and seated themselves opposite the gods, as representatives of
the highest powers next to divinity. Lastly there entered upon the scene
a lot of red and brown masks, with a "third eye" painted on their
breasts. With those who had preceded them, they formed two long lines of
dancers, who to the thrumming of their many tambourines, the measured
music of the trumpets and drums, and the jingling of a myriad of bells,
performed a dance, approaching and receding from each other, whirling in
circles, forming by twos in a column and breaking from that formation to
make new combinations, pausing occasionally to make reverent obeisance
before the gods.

After a time this spectacular excitement the noisy monotony of which
began to weary

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

me--calmed down a little; gods, demigods, kings, men and spirits got up,
and followed by all the other maskers, directed themselves toward the
temple door, whence issued at once, meeting them, a lot of men admirably
disguised as skeletons. All those sorties were calculated and
pre-arranged, and every one of them had its particular significance. The
*cortêge* of dancers gave way to the skeletons, who advanced with
measured steps, in silence, to the masts, where they stopped and made a
concerted clicking with pieces of wood hanging at their sides,
simulating perfectly the rattling of dry bones and gnashing o f teeth.
Twice they went in a circle around the masts, marching in time to low
taps on the drums, and then joined in a lugubrious religious chant.
Having once more made the concerted rattling of their artificial bones

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

and jaws, they executed some contortions painful to witness and together
stopped.

Then they seized upon an image of the Enemy of Man--made of some sort of
brittle paste--which had been placed at the foot of one of the masts.
This they broke in pieces and scattered, and the oldest men among the
spectators, rising from their places, picked up the fragments which they
handed to the skeletons--an action supposed to signify that would soon
be ready to join the bony crew in the cemetery.

 

The chief lama, approaching me, tendered an invitation to accompany him
to the principal terrace and partake of the festal "tchang;" which I
accepted with pleasure, for my head was dizzy from the long spectacle.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

We crossed the court and climbed a staircase--obstructed with
prayer-wheels, as usual--passed two rooms where there were many images
of gods, and came out upon the terrace, where I seated myself upon a
bench opposite the venerable lama, whose eyes sparkled with spirit.

Three lamas brought pitchers of tchang, which they poured into small
copper cups, that were offered first to the chief lama, then to me and
my servants.

"Did you enjoy our little festival?" the lama asked me.

"I found it very enjoyable and am still impressed by the spectacle I
have witnessed. But, to tell the truth, I never suspected for a moment
that Buddhism, in these religious ceremonies, could display such a
visible, not to say noisy, exterior form."

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

"There is no religion, the ceremonies of which are not surrounded with
more theatrical forms," the lama answered. "This is a ritualistic phase
which does not by any means violate the fundamental principles of
Buddhism. It is a practical means for maintaining in the ignorant mass
obedience to and love for the one Creator, just as a child is beguiled
by toys to do the will of its parents. The ignorant mass is the child of
The Father."

"But what is the meaning," I said to him, "of all those masks, costumes,
bells, dances, and, generally, of this entire performance, which seems
to be executed after a prescribed programme?"

"We have many similar festivals in the year," answered the lama, "and we
arrange particular ones to represent 'mysteries,' susceptible

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

of pantomimic presentation, in which each actor is allowed considerable
latitude of action, in the movements and jests he likes, conforming,
nevertheless, to the circumstances and to the leading idea. Our
mysteries are simply pantomimes calculated to show the veneration
offered to the gods, which veneration sustains and cheers the soul of
man, who is prone to anxious contemplation of inevitable death and the
life to come. The actors receive the dresses from the cloister and they
play according to general indications, which leave them much liberty of
individual action. The general effect produced is, no doubt, very
beautiful, but it is a matter for the spectators themselves to divine
the signification of one or another action. You, too, have recourse
sometimes to similar devices, which, however, do not

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

in the least violate the principle of monotheism."

"Pardon me," I remarked, "but this multitude of idols with which your
gonpas abound, is a flagrant violation of that principle."

"As I have told you," replied the lama to my interruption, "man will
always be in! childhood. He sees and feels the grandeur of nature and
understands everything presented to his senses, but he neither sees nor
divines the Great Soul which created and animates all things. Man has
always sought for tangible things. It was not possible for him to
believe long in that which escaped his material senses. He has racked
his brain to and means for contemplating the Creator; has endeavored to
enter into direct relations with him who has done him so much good,

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

and also, as he erroneously believes, so much evil. For this reason he
began to adore every phase of nature from which he received benefits. We
see a striking example of this in the ancient Egyptians, who adored
animals, trees, stones, the winds and the rain. Other peoples, who were
more sunk in ignorance, seeing that the results of the wind were not
always beneficent, and that the rain did not inevitably bring good
harvests, and that the animals were not willingly subservient to man,
began to seek for direct intermediaries between themselves and the great
mysterious and unfathomable power of the Creator. Therefore they made
for themselves idols, which they regarded as indifferent to things
concerning them, but to whose interposition in their behalf, they might
always recur. From remotest antiquity to our own days,

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

man was ever inclined only to tangible realities.

"While seeking a route to lead their feet to the Creator, the Assyrians
turned their eyes toward the stars, which they contemplated without the
power of attaining them. The Guebers have conserved the same belief to
our days. In their nullity and spiritual blindness, men are incapable of
conceiving the invisible spiritual bond which unites them to the great
Divinity, and this explains why I they have always sought for palpable
things, which were in the domain of the senses, and I by doing which
they minimized the divine principle. Nevertheless, they have dared to
attribute to their visible and man-made images a divine and eternal
existence. We can see the same fact in Brahminism, where man, given to
his inclination for exterior

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

forms, has created, little by little, and not all at once, an army of
gods and demi-gods. The Israelites may be said to have demonstrated, in
the most flagrant way, the love of man for everything which is concrete.
In spite of a series of striking miracles accomplished by the great
Creator, who is the same for all the peoples, the Jewish people could
not help making a god of metal in the very minute when their prophet
Mossa spoke to them of the Creator! Buddhism has passed through the same
modifications. Our great reformer, Sakya-Muni, inspired by the Supreme
Judge, understood truly the one and\] indivisible Brahma, and forbade
his disciples attempting to manufacture images in imaginary semblance of
him. He had openly broken from the polytheistic Brahmins, and
appreciated the purity, oneness and immortality

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

of Brahma. The success he achieved by his teachings in making disciples
among the people, brought upon hint persecution by the Brahmins, who, in
the creation of new gods, had found a source of personal revenue, and
who, contrary to the law of God, treated the people in a despotic
manner. Our first sacred teachers, to whom we give the name of
buddhas--which means, learned men or saints--because the great Creator
has incarnated in them, settled in different countries of the globe. As
their teachings attacked especially the tyranny of the Brahmins and the
misuse they made of the idea of God--of which they indeed made a
veritable business--almost all the Buddhistic converts, they who
followed the doctrines of those great teachers, were among the common
people of China and India. Among those teachers,

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

particular reverence is felt for the Buddha, Sakya-Muni, known in China
also under the name of Fô, who lived three thousand years ago, and whose
teachings brought all China back into the path of the true God; and the
Buddha, Gautama, who lived two thousand five hundred years ago, and
converted almost half the Hindus to the knowledge of the impersonal,
indivisible and only God, besides whom there is none.

"Buddhism is divided into many sects which, by the way, differ only in
certain religious ceremonies, the basis of the doctrine being everywhere
the same. The Thibetan Buddhists, who are called 'lamaists,' separated
themselves from the Fô-ists fifteen hundred years ago. Until that time
we had formed part of the worshippers of the Buddha, Fô-Sakya-Muni, who
was the first to collect all

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

the laws compiled by the various buddhas preceding him, when the great
schism took place in the bosom of Brahmanism. Later on, a
Khoutoukhte-Mongol translated into Chinese the books of the great
Buddha, for which the Emperor of China rewarded him by bestowing upon
him the title of 'Go-Chi--'Preceptor of the King!' After his death, this
title was given to the Dalai-Lama of Thibet. Since that epoch, all the
titularies of this position have borne the title of Go-Chi. Our religion
is called the Lamaic one--from the word 'lama,' superior. It admits of
two classes of monks, the red and the yellow. The former may marry, and
they recognize the authority of the Bantsine, who resides in Techow
Loumba, and is chief of the civil administration in Thibet. We, the
yellow lamas, have taken the vow of celibacy, and

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

our direct chief is the Dalai-Lama. This is the difference which
separates the two religious orders, the respective rituals of which are
identical."

"Do all perform mysteries similar to that which I have just witnessed?"

"Yes; with a few exceptions. Formerly these festivals were celebrated
with very solemn pomp, but since the conquest of Ladak our convents have
been, more than once, pillaged and our wealth taken away. Now we content
ourselves with simple garments and bronze utensils, while in Thibet you
sec but golden robes and gold utensils."

"In a visit which I recently made to a gonpa, one of the lamas told me
of a prophet, or, as you call him, a buddha, by the name of Issa. Could
you not tell me anything about him?" I asked my interlocutor, seizing

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

this favorable moment to start the subject which interested me so
greatly.

"The name Issa is very much respected among the Buddhists," he replied,
"but he is only known by the chief lamas, who have read the scrolls
relating to his life. There have existed an infinite number of buddhas
like Issa, and the 84,000 scrolls existing are filled brim full of
details concerning each one of them. But very few persons have read the
one-hundredth part of those memoirs. In conformity with established
custom, every disciple or lama who visits Lhassa makes a gift of one or
several copies, from the scrolls there, to the convent to which he
belongs. Our gonpa, among others, possesses already a great number,
which I read in my leisure hours. Among them are the memoirs of the life
and acts of the Buddha Issa, who preached

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

the same doctrine in India and among the sons of Israel, and who was put
to death by the Pagans, whose descendants, later on, adopted the beliefs
he spread,--and those beliefs are yours.

"The great Buddha, the soul of the Universe, is the incarnation of
Brahma. He, almost always, remains immobile, containing in himself all
things, being in himself the origin of all and his breath vivifying the
world. He has left man to the control of his own forces, but, at certain
epochs, lays aside his inaction and puts on a human form that he may, as
their teacher and guide, rescue his creatures from impending
destruction. In the course of his terrestrial existence in the
similitude of man, Buddha creates a new world in the hearts of erring
men; then he leaves the earth, to become once more an

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

invisible being and resume his condition of perfect bliss. Three
thousand years ago, Buddha incarnated in the celebrated Prince
Sakya-Muni, re-affirming and propagating the doctrines taught by him in
his twenty preceding incarnations. Twenty-five hundred years ago, the
Great Soul of the World incarnated anew in Gautama, laying the
foundation of a new world in Burmah, Siam and different islands. Soon
afterward, Buddhism began to penetrate China, through the persevering
efforts of the sages, who devoted themselves to the propagation of the
sacred doctrine, and under Ming-Ti, of the Honi dynasty, nearly 2,050
years ago, the teachings of Sakya-Muni were adopted by the people of
that country. Simultaneously with the appearance of Buddhism in China,
the same doctrines began to spread among the

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Israelites. It is
about 2,000 years ago that the Perfect Being, awaking once more for a
short time from his inaction, incarnated in the new-born child of a poor
family. It was his will that this little child should enlighten the
unhappy upon the life of the world to conic and bring erring men back
into the path of truth; showing to them, by his own example, the way
they could best return to the primitive morality and purity of our race.
When this sacred child attained a certain age, he was brought to India,
where, until he attained to manhood. he studied the laws of the great
Buddha, who dwells eternally in heaven."

"In what language are written the principal scrolls bearing upon the
life of Issa?" I asked, rising from my seat, for I saw that my
interesting interlocutor evidenced fatigue,

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

and had just given a twirl to his prayer-wheel, as if to hint the
closing of the conversation.

"The original scrolls brought from India to Nepaul, and from Nepaul to
Thibet, relating to the life of Issa, are written in the Pali language
and are actually in Lhassa; but a copy in our language--I mean the
Thibetan--is in this convent."

"How is Issa looked upon in Thibet? Has he the repute of a saint?"

"The people are not even aware that he ever existed. Only the principal
lamas, who know of him through having studied the scrolls in which his
life is related, are familiar with his name; but, as his doctrine does
not constitute a canonical part of Buddhism, and the worshippers of Issa
do not recognize the authority of the Dalai-Lama, the prophet

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Issa--with many
others like him--is not recognized in Thibet as one of the principal
saints."

"Would you commit a sin in reciting your copy of the life of Issa to a
stranger?" I asked him.

"That which belongs to God," he answered me, "belongs also to man. Our
duty requires us to cheerfully devote ourselves to the propagation of
His doctrine. Only, I do not, at present, know where that manuscript is.
If you ever visit our gonpa again, I shall take pleasure in showing it
to you."

At this moment two monks entered, and uttered to the chief lama a few
words unintelligible to me.

"I am called to the sacrifices. Will you kindly excuse me?" said he to
me, and,

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

with a salute, turned to the door and disappeared.

I could do no better than withdraw and lie down in the chamber which was
assigned to me. and where I spent the night.

 

In the evening of the next day I was again in Leh--thinking of how to
get back to the convent. Two days later I sent, by a messenger, to the
chief lama, as presents, a watch, an alarm clock, and a thermometer. At
the same time I sent the message that before leaving Ladak I would
probably return to the convent, in the hope that he would permit me to
see the manuscript which had been the subject of our conversation. It
was now my purpose to gain Kachmyr and return from there, some time
later,

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

to Himis. But fate made a different decision for me.

In passing a mountain, on a height of which is perched the gonpa of
Piatak, my horse made a false step, throwing me to the ground so
violently that my right leg was broken below the knee.

It was impossible to continue my journey, I was not inclined to return
to Leh; and seeking the hospitality of the gonpa, of Piatak was not,
from the appearance of the cloister, an enticing prospect. My best
recourse would be to return to Himis, .then only about half a day's
journey distant, and I ordered my servants to transport me there. They
bandaged my broken leg--an operation which caused me great pain--and
lifted me into the saddle. One carrier walked by my side, supporting the
weight of the injured

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

member, while another led my horse. At a late hour of the evening we
reached the door of the convent of Himis.

When informed of my accident, the kind monks came out to receive me and,
with a wealth of extraordinary precautions of tenderness, I was carried
inside, and, in one of their best rooms, installed upon an improvised
bed, consisting of a mountain of soft. fabrics, with the
naturally-to-be-expected prayer-cylinder beside me. All this was done
for me under the personal supervision of their chief lama, who, with
affectionate sympathy, pressed the hand I gave him in expression of my
thanks for his kindness.

In the morning, I myself bound around the injured limb little oblong
pieces of wood, held by cords, to serve as splints. Then I remained
perfectly quiescent and nature was

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

not slow in her reparative work. Within two days my condition was so far
improved that I could, had it been necessary, have left the gonpa and
directed myself slowly toward India in search of a surgeon to complete
my cure.

While a boy kept in motion the prayer-barrel near my bed, the venerable
lama who ruled the convent entertained me with many interesting stories.
Frequently he took from their box the alarm clock and the watch, that I
might illustrate to him the process of winding them and explain to him
their uses. At length, yielding to my ardent insistence, he brought me
two big books, the large leaves of which were of paper yellow with age,
and from them read to me the biography of Issa, which I carefully
transcribed in my travelling note-book according to the translation

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

made by the interpreter. This curious document is compiled under the
form of isolated verses, which, as placed, very often had no apparent
connection with, or relation to each other.

On the third day, my condition was so far improved as to permit the
prosecution of my journey. Having bound up my leg as well as possible, I
returned, across Kachmyr, to India; a slow journey, of twenty days,
filled with intolerable pain. Thanks, however, to a litter, which a
French gentleman, M. Peicheau, had kindly sent to me (my gratitude for
which I take this occasion to express), and to an ukase of the Grand
Vizier of the Maharajah of Kachmyr, ordering the local authorities to
provide me with carriers, I reached Srinagar, and left almost
immediately,

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

being anxious to gain India before the first snows fell.

In Muré I encountered another Frenchman, Count André de Saint Phall, who
was making a journey of recreation across Hindostan. During the whole
course, which we made together, to Bombay, the young count demonstrated
a touching solicitude for me, and sympathy for the excruciating pain I
suffered from my broken leg and the fever induced by its torture. I
cherish for him sincere gratitude, and shall never forget the friendly
care which I received upon my arrival in Bombay from the Marquis de
Morés, the Vicomte de Breteul, M. Monod, of the Comptoir d’Escompte, M.
Moët, acting consul, and all the members of the very sympathetic French
colony there.

During a long time I revolved in my mind

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

the purpose of publishing the memoirs of the life of Jesus Christ found
by me in Himis, of which I have spoken, but other interests absorbed my
attention and delayed it. Only now, after having passed long nights of
wakefulness in the co-ordination of my notes and grouping the verses
conformably to the march of the recital, imparting to the work, as a
whole, a character of unity, I resolve to let this curious chronicle see
the light.
