<p>2. But Issa, warned by the Sudras of his</p>

<p>danger, left by night Djagguernat, gained the mountain, and settled in the country of the Gautamides, where the great Buddha Sakya-Muni came to the world, among a people who worshipped the only and sublime Brahma.</p>  
<p>3. When the just Issa had acquired the Pali language, he applied himself to the study of the sacred scrolls of the Sutras.</p>  
<p>4. After six years of study, Issa, whom the Buddha had elected to spread his holy word, could perfectly expound the sacred scrolls.</p>  
<p>5. He then left Nepaul and the Himalaya mountains, descended into the valley of Radjipoutan and directed his steps toward the West, everywhere preaching to the people the supreme perfection attainable by man;</p>  
<p>6. And the good he must do to his fellowmen,</p>  
<p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></A></p>  
<p>which is the sure means of speedy union with the eternal Spirit. "He who has recovered his primitive purity," said Issa, "shall die with his transgressions forgiven and have the right to contemplate the majesty of God."</p>  
<p>7. When the divine Issa traversed the territories of the Pagans, he taught that the adoration of visible gods was contrary to natural law.</p>  
<p>8. "For to man," said he, "it has not been given to see the image of God, and it behooves him not to make for himself a multitude of divinities in the imagined likeness of the Eternal.</p>  
<p>9. "Moreover, it is against human conscience to have less regard for the greatness of divine purity, than for animals or works of stone or metal made by the hands of man.</p>  
<p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></A></p>  
<p>10. "The eternal Lawgiver is One; there are no other Gods than He; He has parted the world with none, nor had He any counsellor.</p>  
<p>11. "Even as a father shows kindness toward his children, so will God judge men after death, in conformity with His merciful laws. He will never humiliate his child by casting his soul for chastisement into the body of a beast.</p>  
<p>12. "The heavenly laws," said the Creator, through the mouth of Issa, "are opposed to the immolation of human sacrifices to a statue or an animal; for I, the God, have sacrificed to man all the animals and all that the world contains.</p>  
<p>13. "Everything has been sacrificed to man, who is directly and intimately united to me, his Father; therefore, shall the man be</p>  
<p><a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="green">p. 177</font></A></p>  
<p>severely judged and punished, by my law, who causes the sacrifice of my children.</p>  
<p>14. "Man is naught before the eternal Judge; as the animal is before man.</p>  
<p>15. "Therefore, I say unto you, leave your idols and perform not ceremonies which separate you from your Father and bind you to the priests, from whom heaven has turned away.</p>  
<p>16. "For it is they who have led you away from the true God, and by superstitions and cruelty perverted the spirit and made you blind to the knowledge of the truth."</p>
