# Chapter XVI - The Apocalypse

<span id="pg_558">p. 558</span>

Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this
prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time
is at hand.--REVELATION.

Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in
the mountain of His holiness.--PSALMS.

ST. JOHN writes, in the tenth chapter of his book of Revelation :

And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a
cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the
sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: and he had in his hand a little
book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on
the earth.

The new Evangel

This angel or message which comes from God, clothed with a cloud,
prefigures divine Science. To mortal sense Science seems at first
obscure, abstract, and dark; but a bright promise crowns its brow. When
understood, it is Truth's prism and praise. When you look it fairly in
the face, you can heal by its means, and it has for you a light above
the sun, for God "is the light thereof." Its feet are pillars of fire,
foundations of Truth and Love. It brings the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
whose flames of Truth were prophetically described by John the Baptist
as consuming error.

<span id="pg_559">p. 559</span>

Truth's volume

This angel had in his hand "a little book," open for all to read and
understand. Did this same book contain the revelation of divine Science,
the "right foot" or dominant power of which was upon the sea,--upon
elementary, latent error, the source of all error's visible forms? The
angel's left foot was upon the earth; that is, a secondary power was
exercised upon visible error and audible sin. The "still, small voice"
of scientific thought reaches over continent and ocean to the globe's
remotest bound. The inaudible voice of Truth is, to the human mind, "as
when a lion roareth." It is heard in the desert and in dark places of
fear. It arouses the "seven thunders" of evil, and stirs their latent
forces to utter the full diapason of secret tones. Then is the power of
Truth demonstrated,--made manifest in the destruction of error. Then
will a voice from harmony cry: "Go and take the little book. . . . Take
it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be
in thy mouth sweet as honey." Mortals, obey the heavenly evangel. Take
divine Science. Read this book from beginning to end. Study it, ponder
it. It will be indeed sweet at its first taste, when it heals you; but
murmur not over Truth, if you find its digestion bitter. When you
approach nearer and nearer to this divine Principle, when you eat the
divine body of this Principle, - thus partaking of the nature, or primal
elements, of Truth and Love, - do not be surprised nor discontented
because you must share the hemlock cup and eat the bitter herbs; for the
Israelites of old at the Paschal meal thus prefigured this perilous
passage out of bondage into the El Dorado of faith and hope.

To-day's lesson

The twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse, or Revela

<span id="pg_560">p. 560</span>

tion of St. John, has a special suggestiveness in connection with the
nineteenth century. In the opening of the sixth seal, typical of six
thousand years since Adam, the distinctive feature has reference to the
present age.

Revelation xii. 1. And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman
clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a
crown of twelve stars.

True estimate of God's messenger

Heaven represents harmony, and divine Science interprets the Principle
of heavenly harmony. The great miracle, to human sense, is divine Love,
and the grand necessity of existence is to gain the true idea of what
constitutes the kingdom of heaven in man. This goal is never reached
while we hate our neighbor or entertain a false estimate of anyone whom
God has appointed to voice His Word. Again, without a correct sense of
its highest visible idea, we can never understand the divine Principle.
The botanist must know the genus and species of a plant in order to
classify it correctly. As it is with things, so is it with persons.

Persecution harmful

Abuse of the motives and religion of St. Paul hid from view the
apostle's character, which made him equal to his great mission.
Persecution of all who have spoken something new and better of God has
not only obscured the light of the ages, but has been fatal to the
persecutors. Why? Because it has hid from them the true idea which has
been presented. To misunderstand Paul, was to be ignorant of the divine
idea he taught. Ignorance of the divine idea betrays at once a greater
ignorance of the divine Principle of the idea - igno

<span id="pg_561">p. 561</span>

rance of Truth and Love. The understanding of Truth and Love, the
Principle which works out the ends of eternal good and destroys both
faith in evil and the practice of evil, leads to the discernment of the
divine idea.

Espousals supernal

Agassiz, through his microscope, saw the sun in an egg at a point of
so-called embryonic life. Because of his more spiritual vision, St. John
saw an "angel standing in the sun." The Revelator beheld the spiritual
idea from the mount of vision. Purity was the symbol of Life and Love.
The Revelator saw also the spiritual ideal as a woman clothed in light,
a bride coming down from heaven, wedded to the Lamb of Love. To John,
"the bride" and "the Lamb" represented the correlation of divine
Principle and spiritual idea, God and His Christ, bringing harmony to
earth.

Divinity and humanity

John saw the human and divine coincidence, shown in the man Jesus, as
divinity embracing humanity in Life and its demonstration,--reducing to
human perception and understanding the Life which is God. In divine
revelation, material and corporeal selfhood disappear, and the spiritual
idea is understood.

Spiritual sunlight

The woman in the Apocalypse symbolizes generic man, the spiritual idea
of God; she illustrates the coincidence of God and man as the divine
Principle and divine idea. The Revelator symbolizes Spirit by the sun.
The spiritual idea is clad with the radiance of spiritual Truth, and
matter is put under her feet. The light portrayed is really neither
solar nor lunar, but spiritual Life, which is "the light of men." In the
first chapter of the Fourth Gospel it is written, "There was a man sent
from God . . . to bear witness of that Light."

Spiritual idea revealed

John the Baptist prophesied the coming of the im

<span id="pg_562 ">p. 562</span>

maculate Jesus, and John saw in those days the spiritual idea as the
Messiah, who would baptize with the Holy Ghost,--divine Science. As
Elias presented the idea of the fatherhood of God, which Jesus
afterwards manifested, so the Revelator completed this figure with
woman, typifying the spiritual idea of God's motherhood. The moon is
under her feet. This idea reveals the universe as secondary and
tributary to Spirit, from which the universe borrows its reflected
light, substance, life, and intelligence.

Spiritual idea crowned

The spiritual idea is crowned with twelve stars. The twelve tribes of
Israel with all mortals,--separated by belief from man's divine origin
and the true idea,--will through much tribulation yield to the
activities of the divine Principle of man in the harmony of Science.
These are the stars in the crown of rejoicing. They are the lamps in the
spiritual heavens of the age, which show the workings of the spiritual
idea by healing the sick and the sinning, and by manifesting the light
which shines "unto the perfect day" as the night of materialism wanes.

Revelation xii. 2. And she being with child cried, travailing in birth,
and pained to be delivered.

Travail and joy

Also the spiritual idea is typified by a woman in travail, waiting to be
delivered of her sweet promise, but remembering no more her sorrow for
joy that the birth goes on; for great is the idea, and the travail
portentous.

Revelation xii. 3. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and
behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven
crowns upon his heads.

<span id="pg_563">p. 563</span>

The dragon as a type

Human sense may well marvel at discord, while, to a diviner sense.,
harmony is the real and discord the unreal. We may well be astonished at
sin, sickness, and death. We may well be perplexed at human fear; and
still more astounded at hatred, which lifts its hydra head, showing its
horns in the many inventions of evil. But why should we stand aghast at
nothingness? The great red dragon symbolizes a lie,--the belief that
substance, life, and intelligence can be material. This dragon stands
for the sum total of human error. The ten horns of the dragon typify the
belief that matter has power of its own, and that by means of an evil
mind in matter the Ten Commandments can be broken.

The sting of the serpent

The Revelator lifts the veil from this embodiment of all evil, and
beholds its awful character; but he also sees the nothingness of evil
and the allness of God. The Revelator sees that old serpent, whose name
is devil or evil, holding untiring watch, that he may bite the heel of
truth and seemingly impede the offspring of the spiritual idea, which is
prolific in health, holiness, and immortality.

Revelation xii. 4. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of
heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the
woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon
as it was born.

Animal tendency

The serpentine form stands for subtlety, winding its way amidst all
evil, but doing this in the name of good. Its sting is spoken of by
Paul, when he refers to "spiritual wickedness in high places." It is the
animal instinct in mortals, which would impel

<span id="pg_564">p. 564</span>

them to devour each other and cast out devils through Beelzebub.

As of old, evil still charges the spiritual idea with error's own nature
and methods. This malicious animal instinct, of which the dragon is the
type, incites mortals to kill morally and physically even their
fellow-mortals, and worse still, to charge the innocent with the crime.
This last infirmity of sin will sink its perpetrator into a night
without a star.

Malicious barbarity

The author is convinced that the accusations against Jesus of Nazareth
and even his crucifixion were instigated by the criminal instinct here
described. The Revelator speaks of Jesus as the Lamb of God and of the
dragon as warring against innocence. Since Jesus must have been tempted
in all points, he, the immaculate, met and conquered sin in every form.
The brutal barbarity of his foes could emanate from no source except the
highest degree of human depravity. Jesus "opened not his mouth." Until
the majesty of Truth should be demonstrated in divine Science, the
spiritual idea was arraigned before the tribunal of so-called mortal
mind, which was unloosed in order that the false claim of mind in matter
might uncover its own crime of defying immortal Mind.

Doom of the dragon

From Genesis to the Apocalypse, sin, sickness, and death, envy, hatred,
and revenge, - all evil, - are typified by a serpent, or animal
subtlety. Jesus said, quoting a line from the Psalms, "They hated me
without a cause." The serpent is perpetually close upon the heel of
harmony. From the beginning to the end, the serpent pursues with hatred
the spiritual idea. In Genesis, this allegorical, talking serpent
typifies mortal mind, "more subtle than any beast of the

<span id="pg_565">p. 565</span>

field." In the Apocalypse, when nearing its doom, this evil increases
and becomes the great red dragon, swollen with sin, inflamed with war
against spirituality, and ripe for destruction. It is full of lust and
hate, loathing the brightness of divine glory.

Revelation xii. 5. And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule
all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God,
and to His throne.

The conflict with purity

Led on by the grossest element of mortal mind, Herod decreed the death
of every male child in order that the man Jesus, the masculine
representative of the spiritual idea might never hold sway and deprive
Herod of his crown. The impersonation of the spiritual idea had a brief
history in the earthly life of our Master; but "of his kingdom there
shall be no end," for Christ, God's idea, will eventually rule all
nations and peoples - imperatively, absolutely, finally - with divine
Science. This immaculate idea, represented first by man and, according
to the Revelator, last by woman, will baptize with fire; and the fiery
baptism will burn up the chaff of error with the fervent heat of Truth
and Love, melting and purifying even the gold of human character. After
the stars sang together and all was primeval harmony, the material lie
made war upon the spiritual idea; but this only impelled the idea to
rise to the zenith of demonstration, destroying sin, sickness, and
death, and to be caught up unto God,--to be found in its divine
Principle.

Revelation xii. 6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she
hath a place prepared of God.

<span id="pg_566 ">p. 566</span>

Spiritual guidance

As the children of Israel were guided triumphantly through the Red Sea,
the dark ebbing and flowing tides of human fear,--as they were led
through the wilderness, walking wearily through the great desert of
human hopes, and anticipating the promised joy,--so shall the spiritual
idea guide all right desires in their passage from sense to Soul, from a
material sense of existence to the spiritual, up to the glory prepared
for them who love God. Stately Science pauses not, but moves before
them, a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night, leading to divine
heights.

If we remember the beautiful description which Sir Walter Scott puts
into the mouth of Rebecca the Jewess in the story of Ivanhoe,

   When Israel, of the Lord beloved,  
      Out of the land of bondage came,  
   Her fathers' God before her moved,  
      An awful guide, in smoke and flame, -  

we may also offer the prayer which concludes the same hymn,

   And oh, when stoops on Judah's path  
      In shade and storm the frequent night,  
   Be Thou, longsuffering, slow to wrath,  
      A burning and a shining light!  

Revelation xii. 7, 8. And there was war in heaven: Michael and his
angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought, and his angels,
and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.

Angelic offices

The Old Testament assigns to the angels, God's divine messages,
different offices. Michael's characteristic is spiritual strength. He
leads the hosts of heaven against the power of sin, Satan, and

<span id="pg_567">p. 567</span>

fights the holy wars. Gabriel has the more quiet task of imparting a
sense of the ever-presence of ministering Love. These angels deliver us
from the depths. Truth and Love come nearer in the hour of woe, when
strong faith or spiritual strength wrestles and prevails through the
understanding of God. The Gabriel of His presence has no contests. To
infinite, ever-present Love, all is Love, and there is no error, no sin,
sickness, nor death. Against Love, the dragon warreth not long, for he
is killed by the divine Principle. Truth and Love prevail against the
dragon because the dragon cannot war with them. Thus endeth the conflict
between the flesh and Spirit.

Revelation xii. 9. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent,
called the devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was
cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

Dragon cast down to earth

That false claim--that ancient belief, that old serpent whose name is
devil (evil), claiming that there is intelligence in matter either to
benefit or to injure men--is pure delusion, the red dragon; and it is
cast out by Christ, Truth, the spiritual idea, and so proved to be
powerless. The words "cast unto the earth" show the dragon to be
nothingness, dust to dust; and therefore, in his pretence of being a
talker, he must be a lie from the beginning. His angels, or messages,
are cast out with their author. The beast and the false prophets are
lust and hypocrisy. These wolves in sheep's clothing are detected and
killed by innocence, the Lamb of Love.

Warfare with error

Divine Science shows how the Lamb slays the wolf.

<span id="pg_568">p. 568</span>

Innocence and Truth overcome guilt and error. Ever since the foundation
of the world, ever since error would establish material belief, evil has
tried to slay the Lamb; but Science is able to destroy this lie, called
evil. The twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse typifies the divine method
of warfare in Science, and the glorious results of this warfare. The
following chapters depict the fatal effects of trying to meet error with
error. The narrative follows the order used in Genesis. In Genesis,
first the true method of creation is set forth and then the false. Here,
also, the Revelator first exhibits the true warfare and then the false.

Revelation xii. 10--12. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now
is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the
power of His Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which
accused them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the
blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved
not their lives unto the death. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye
that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea!
for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he
knoweth that he hath but a short time.

Paean of jubilee

For victory over a single sin, we give thanks and magnify the Lord of
Hosts. What shall we say of the mighty conquest over all sin? A louder
song, sweeter than has ever before reached high heaven, now rises
clearer and nearer to the great heart of Christ; for the accuser is not
there, and Love sends forth her primal and everlasting strain.
Self-abnegation, by which we lay down all for Truth, or Christ, in our
warfare against error, is a rule in Christian Science. This rule clearly

<span id="pg_569">p. 569</span>

interprets God as divine Principle,--as Life, represented by the Father;
as Truth, represented by the Son; as Love, represented by the Mother.
Every mortal at some period, here or hereafter, must grapple with and
overcome the mortal belief in a power opposed to God.

The robe of Science

The Scripture, "Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
thee ruler over many," is literally fulfilled, when we are conscious of
the supremacy of Truth, by which the nothingness of error is seen; and
we know that the nothingness of error is in proportion to its
wickedness. He that touches the hem of Christ's robe and masters his
mortal beliefs, animality, and hate, rejoices in the proof of
healing,--in a sweet and certain sense that God is Love. Alas for those
who break faith with divine Science and fail to strangle the serpent of
sin as well as of sickness! They are dwellers still in the deep darkness
of belief. They are in the surging sea of error, not struggling to lift
their heads above the drowning wave.

Expiation by suffering

What must the end be? They must eventually expiate their sin through
suffering. The sin, which one has made his bosom companion, comes back
to him at last with accelerated force, for the devil knoweth his time is
short. Here the Scriptures declare that evil is temporal, not eternal.
The dragon is at last stung to death by his own malice; but how many
periods of torture it may take to remove all sin, must depend upon sin's
obduracy.

Revelation xii. 13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the
earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.

<span id="pg_570">p. 570</span>

Apathy to occultism

The march of mind and of honest investigation will bring the hour when
the people will chain, with fetters of some sort, the growing occultism
of this period. The present apathy as to the tendency of certain active
yet unseen mental agencies will finally be shocked into another extreme
mortal mood,--into human indignation; for one extreme follows another.

Revelation xii. 15, 16. And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a
flood, after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of
the flood. And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her
mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his
mouth.

Receptive hearts

Millions of unprejudiced minds--simple seekers for Truth, weary
wanderers, athirst in the desert - are waiting and watching for rest and
drink. Give them a cup of cold water in Christ's name, and never fear
the consequences. What if the old dragon should send forth a new flood
to drown the Christ-idea? He can neither drown your voice with its roar,
nor again sink the world into the deep waters of chaos and old night. In
this age the earth will help the woman; the spiritual idea will be
understood. Those ready for the blessing you impart will give thanks.
The waters will be pacified, and Christ will command the wave.

Hidden ways of iniquity

When God heals the sick or the sinning, they should know the great
benefit which Mind has wrought. They should also know the great delusion
of mortal mind, when it makes them sick or sinful. Many are willing to
open the eyes of the people to the power of good resident in divine
Mind, but they are

<span id="pg_571">p. 571</span>

not so willing to point out the evil in human thought, and expose evil's
hidden mental ways of accomplishing iniquity.

Christly warning

Why this backwardness, since exposure is necessary to ensure the
avoidance of the evil? Because people like you better when you tell them
their virtues than when you tell them their vices. It requires the
spirit of our blessed Master to tell a man his faults, and so risk human
displeasure for the sake of doing right and benefiting our race. Who is
telling mankind of the foe in ambush? Is the informer one who sees the
foe? If so, listen and be wise. Escape from evil, and designate those as
unfaithful stewards who have seen the danger and yet have given no
warning.

The armor of divinity

At all times and under all circumstances, overcome evil with good. Know
thyself, and God will supply the wisdom and the occasion for a victory
over evil. Clad in the panoply of Love, human hatred cannot reach you.
The cement of a higher humanity will unite all interests in the one
divinity.

Pure religion enthroned

Through trope and metaphor, the Revelator, immortal scribe of Spirit and
of a true idealism, furnishes the mirror in which mortals may see their
own image. In significant figures he depicts the thoughts which he
beholds in mortal mind. Thus he rebukes the conceit of sin, and
foreshadows its doom. With his spiritual strength, he has opened wide
the gates of glory, and illumined the night of paganism with the sublime
grandeur of divine Science, outshining sin, sorcery, lust, and
hypocrisy. He takes away mitre and sceptre. He enthrones pure and
undefiled religion, and lifts on

<span id="pg_572 ">p. 572</span>

high only those who have washed their robes white in obedience and
suffering.

Native nothingness of sin

Thus we see, in both the first and last books of the Bible,--in Genesis
and in the Apocalypse,--that sin is to be Christianly and scientifically
reduced to its native nothingness. "Love one another" (I John, iii. 23),
is the most simple and profound counsel of the inspired writer. In
Science we are children of God; but whatever is of material sense, or
mortal, belongs not to His children, for materiality is the inverted
image of spirituality.

Fulfilment of the Law

Love fulfils the law of Christian Science, and nothing short of this
divine Principle, understood and demonstrated, can ever furnish the
vision of the Apocalypse, open the seven seals of error with Truth, or
uncover the myriad illusions of sin, sickness, and death. Under the
supremacy of Spirit, it will be seen and acknowledged that matter must
disappear.

In Revelation xxi. 1 we read:

And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the
first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

Man's present possibilities

The Revelator had not yet passed the transitional stage in human
experience called death, but he already saw a new heaven and a new
earth. Through what sense came this vision to St. John? Not through the
material visual organs for seeing, for optics are inadequate to take in
so wonderful a scene. Were this new heaven and new earth terrestrial or
celestial, mate

<span id="pg_573">p. 573</span>

rial or spiritual? They could not be the former, for the human sense of
space is unable to grasp such a view. The Revelator was on our plane of
existence, while yet beholding what the eye cannot see, - that which is
invisible to the uninspired thought. This testimony of Holy Writ
sustains the fact in Science, that the heavens and earth to one human
consciousness, that consciousness which God bestows, are spiritual,
while to another, the unillumined human mind, the vision is material.
This shows unmistakably that what the human mind terms matter and spirit
indicates states and stages of consciousness.

Nearness of Deity

Accompanying this scientific consciousness was another revelation, even
the declaration from heaven, supreme harmony, that God, the divine
Principle of harmony, is ever with men, and they are His people. Thus
man was no longer regarded as a miserable sinner, but as the blessed
child of God. Why? Because St. John's corporeal sense of the heavens and
earth had vanished, and in place of this false sense was the spiritual
sense, the subjective state by which he could see the new heaven and new
earth, which involve the spiritual idea and consciousness of reality.
This is Scriptural authority for concluding that such a recognition of
being is, and has been, possible to men in this present state of
existence,--that we can become conscious, here and now, of a cessation
of death, sorrow, and pain. This is indeed a foretaste of absolute
Christian Science. Take heart, dear sufferer, for this reality of being
will surely appear sometime and in some way. There will be no more pain,
and all tears will be wiped away. When you read this, remember Jesus'
words, "The kingdom of

<span id="pg_574">p. 574</span>

God is within you." This spiritual consciousness is therefore a present
possibility.

The Revelator also takes in another view, adapted to console the weary
pilgrim, journeying " uphill all the way."

He writes, in Revelation xxi. 9:

And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials
full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither,
I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.

Vials of wrath and consolation

This ministry of Truth, this message from divine Love, carried John away
in spirit. It exalted him till he became conscious of the spiritual
facts of being and the "New Jerusalem, coming down from God, out of
heaven," - the spiritual outpouring of bliss and glory, which he
describes as the city which "lieth foursquare." The beauty of this text
is, that the sum total of human misery, represented by the seven angelic
vials full of seven plagues, has full compensation in the law of Love.
Note this,--that the very message, or swift-winged thought, which poured
forth hatred and torment, brought also the experience which at last
lifted the seer to behold the great city, the four equal sides of which
were heaven-bestowed and heaven-bestowing.

Spiritual wedlock

Think of this, dear reader, for it will lift the sackcloth from your
eyes, and you will behold the softwinged dove descending upon you. The
very circumstance, which your suffering sense deems wrathful and
afflictive, Love can make an angel entertained unawares. Then thought
gently whispers:

<span id="pg_575">p. 575</span>

"Come hither! Arise from your false consciousness into the true sense of
Love, and behold the Lamb's wife,--Love wedded to its own spiritual
idea." Then cometh the marriage feast, for this revelation will destroy
forever the physical plagues imposed by material sense.

The city foursquare

This sacred city, described in the Apocalypse (xxi. 16) as one that
"lieth foursquare" and cometh "down from God, out of heaven," represents
the light and glory of divine Science. The builder and maker of this New
Jerusalem is God, as we read in the book of Hebrews; and it is "a city
which hath foundations." The description is metaphoric. Spiritual
teaching must always be by symbols. Did not Jesus illustrate the truths
he taught by the mustard-seed and the prodigal? Taken in its allegorical
sense, the description of the city as foursquare has a profound meaning.
The four sides of our city are the Word, Christ, Christianity, and
divine Science; "and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day:
for there shall be no night there." This city is wholly spiritual, as
its four sides indicate.

The royally divine gates

As the Psalmist saith, "Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole
earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great
King." It is indeed a city of the Spirit, fair, royal, and square.
Northward, its gates open to the North Star, the Word, the polar magnet
of Revelation; eastward, to the star seen by the Wisemen of the Orient,
who followed it to the manger of Jesus; southward, to the genial
tropics, with the Southern Cross in the skies, - the Cross of Calvary,
which binds human society into solemn union; westward, to the grand
realization

<span id="pg_576">p. 576</span>

of the Golden Shore of Love and the Peaceful Sea of Harmony.

Revelation's pure zenith

This heavenly city, lighted by the Sun of Righteousness,--this New
Jerusalem, this infinite All, which to us seems hidden in the mist of
remoteness, reached St. John's vision while yet he tabernacled with
mortals.

In Revelation xxi. 22, further describing this holy city, the beloved
Disciple writes:

And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are
the temple of it.

The shrine celestial

There was no temple,--that is, no material structure in which to worship
God, for He must be worshipped in spirit and in love. The word temple
also means body. The Revelator was familiar with Jesus' use of this
word, as when Jesus spoke of his material body as the temple to be
temporarily rebuilt (John ii. 21). What further indication need we of
the real man's incorporeality than this, that John saw heaven and earth
with "no temple \[body\] therein"? This kingdom of God "is within
you,"--is within reach of man's consciousness here, and the spiritual
idea reveals it. In divine Science, man possesses this recognition of
harmony consciously in proportion to his understanding of God.

Divine sense of Deity

The term Lord, as used in our version of the Old Testament, is often
synonymous with Jehovah, and expresses the Jewish concept, not yet
elevated to deific apprehension through spiritual transfiguration. Yet
the word gradually approaches a higher meaning. This human sense of
Deity yields to the divine

<span id="pg_577">p. 577</span>

sense, even as the material sense of personality yields to the
incorporeal sense of God and man as the infinite Principle and infinite
idea, - as one Father with His universal family, held in the gospel of
Love. The Lamb's wife presents the unity of male and female as no longer
two wedded individuals, but as two individual natures in one; and this
compounded spiritual individuality reflects God as Father-Mother, not as
a corporeal being. In this divinely united spiritual consciousness,
there is no impediment to eternal bliss,--to the perfectibility of God's
creation.

The city of our God

This spiritual, holy habitation has no boundary nor limit, but its four
cardinal points are: first, the Word of Life, Truth, and Love; second,
the Christ, the spiritual idea of God; third, Christianity, which is the
outcome of the divine Principle of the Christ-idea in Christian history;
fourth, Christian Science, which to-day and forever interprets this
great example and the great Exemplar. This city of our God has no need
of sun or satellite, for Love is the light of it, and divine Mind is its
own interpreter. All who are saved must walk in this light. Mighty
potentates and dynasties will lay down their honors within the heavenly
city. Its gates open towards light and glory both within and without,
for all is good, and nothing can enter that city, which "defileth. . . .
or maketh a lie." The writer's present feeble sense of Christian Science
closes with St. John's Revelation as recorded by the great apostle, for
his vision is the acme of this Science as the Bible reveals it.

In the following Psalm one word shows, though faintly,

the light which Christian Science throws on the Scriptures by
substituting for the corporeal sense, the incorporeal or spiritual sense
of Deity:

         PSALM XXIII

\[DIVINE LOVE\] is my shepherd; I shall not want.

\[LOVE\] maketh me to lie down in green pastures:

\[LOVE\] leadeth me beside the still waters.

\[LOVE\] restoreth my soul \[spiritual sense\]: \[Love\] leadeth me in
the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil: for \[LOVE\] is with me; \[LOVE's\] rod and \[LOVE'S\]
staff they comfort me.

\[LOVE\] prepareth a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
\[LOVE\] anointeth my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I
will dwell in the house \[the consciousness\] of \[LOVE\] for ever.
