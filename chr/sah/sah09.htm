<P><P><A NAME="pg_255"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 255</FONT></A></P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy throne is established of old<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art from everlasting.--PSALMS.<BR>
<P>For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.--PAUL.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Inadequate theories of creation</FONT></P>
ETERNAL Truth is changing the universe. As mortals drop off their mental swaddling-clothes, thought
expands into expression. "Let there be light," 
is the perpetual demand of Truth and Love,
changing chaos into order and discord into the
music of the spheres. The mythical human theories of
creation, anciently classified as the higher criticism, sprang
from cultured scholars in Rome and in Greece, but they
afforded no foundation for accurate views of creation by
the divine Mind.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Finite views of Deity</FONT></P>
Mortal man has made a covenant with his eyes to belittle Deity with human conceptions. In league
with material sense, mortals take limited views
of all things. That God is corporeal or material, no man
should affirm.
<P><P>The human form, or physical finiteness, cannot be
made the basis of any true idea of the infinite Godhead.
Eye hath not seen Spirit, nor hath ear heard His voice.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_256"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 256</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>No material creation</FONT></P>
Progress takes off human shackles. The finite must
yield to the infinite. Advancing to a higher plane of action, thought rises from the material sense to
the spiritual, from the scholastic to the inspirational, and from the mortal to the immortal. All
things are created spiritually. Mind, not matter, is the
creator. Love, the divine Principle, is the Father and
Mother of the universe, including man.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Tritheism impossible</FONT></P>
The theory of three persons in one God (that is, a personal Trinity or Tri-unity) suggests polytheism, rather than the one ever-present I AM.
"Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>No divine corporeality</FONT></P>
The everlasting I AM is not bounded nor compressed
within the narrow limits of physical humanity, nor can
He be understood aright through mortal concepts. The precise form of God must be of
small importance in comparison with the sublime question, What is infinite Mind or divine Love?
<P><P>Who is it that demands our obedience? He who, in
the language of Scripture, "doeth according to His will
in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the
earth; and none can stay His hand, or say unto Him,
What doest Thou?"
<P><P>No form nor physical combination is adequate to represent infinite Love. A finite and material sense of God
leads to formalism and narrowness; it chills the spirit of
Christianity.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Limitless Mind</FONT></P>
A limitless Mind cannot proceed from physical limitations. Finiteness cannot present the idea or the vastness of infinity. A mind originating from a
finite or material source must be limited and
finite. Infinite Mind is the creator, and creation is the
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_257"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 257</FONT></A></P><P><P>infinite image or idea emanating from this Mind. If
Mind is within and without all things, then all is Mind;
and this definition is scientific.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Matter is not substance</FONT></P>
If matter, so-called, is substance, then Spirit, matter's
unlikeness, must be shadow; and shadow cannot produce
substance. The theory that Spirit is not the
only substance and creator is pantheistic heterodoxy, which ultimates in sickness, sin, and death; it is
the belief in a bodily soul and a material mind, a soul
governed by the body and a mind in matter. This belief is shallow pantheism.
<P><P>Mind creates His own likeness in ideas, and the substance of an idea is very far from being the supposed substance of non-intelligent matter. Hence the Father Mind
is not the father of matter. The material senses and
human conceptions would translate spiritual ideas into
material beliefs, and would say that an anthropomorphic
God, instead of infinite Principle,--in other words, divine
Love,--is the father of the rain, "who hath begotten the
drops of dew," who bringeth "forth Mazzaroth in his season," and guideth "Arcturus with his sons."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Inexhaustible divine Love</FONT></P>
Finite mind manifests all sorts of errors, and thus
proves the material theory of mind in matter to be the
antipode of Mind. Who hath found finite life
or love sufficient to meet the demands of human
want and woe, - to still the desires, to satisfy the aspirations? Infinite Mind cannot be limited to a finite form,
or Mind would lose its infinite character as inexhaustible
Love, eternal Life, omnipotent Truth.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Infinite physique impossible</FONT></P>
It would require an infinite form to contain infinite
Mind. Indeed, the phrase infinite form involves a contradiction of terms. Finite man cannot be the image and
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_258"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 258</FONT></A></P><P><P>likeness of the infinite God. A mortal, corporeal, or
finite conception of God cannot embrace the glories of
limitless, incorporeal Life and Love. Hence
the unsatisfied human craving for something
better, higher, holier, than is afforded by a
material belief in a physical God and man. The insufficiency of this belief to supply the true idea proves the
falsity of material belief.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Infinity's reflection</FONT></P>
Man is more than a material form with a mind inside,
which must escape from its environments in
order to be immortal. Man reflects infinity,
and this reflection is the true idea of God.
<P><P>God expresses in man the infinite idea forever developing itself, broadening and rising higher and higher from
a boundless basis. Mind manifests all that exists in
the infinitude of Truth. We know no more of man as
the true divine image and likeness, than we know of
God.
<P><P>The infinite Principle is reflected by the infinite idea
and spiritual individuality, but the material so-called senses
have no cognizance of either Principle or its idea. The
human capacities are enlarged and perfected in proportion as humanity gains the true conception of man and
God.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Individual permanency</FONT></P>
Mortals have a very imperfect sense of the spiritual
man and of the infinite range of his thought. To him
belongs eternal Life. Never born and
never dying, it were impossible for man, under
the government of God in eternal Science, to fall from his
high estate.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>God's man discerned</FONT></P>
Through spiritual sense you can discern the heart of
divinity, and thus begin to comprehend in Science the
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_259"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 259</FONT></A></P><P><P>generic term man. Man is not absorbed in Deity, and
man cannot lose his individuality, for he reflects eternal Life; nor is he an isolated, solitary idea, for he represents infinite Mind, the sum of all
substance.
<P><P>In divine Science, man is the true image of God. The
divine nature was best expressed in Christ Jesus, who
threw upon mortals the truer reflection of God and lifted
their lives higher than their poor thought-models would
allow,--thoughts which presented man as fallen, sick,
sinning, and dying. The Christlike understanding of
scientific being and divine healing includes a perfect Principle and idea,--perfect God and perfect man,--as the
basis of thought and demonstration.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The divine image not lost</FONT></P>
If man was once perfect but has now lost his perfection,
then mortals have never beheld in man the reflex image
of God. The lost image is no image. The
true likeness cannot be lost in divine reflection.
Understanding this, Jesus said: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
perfect."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Immortal models</FONT></P>
Mortal thought transmits its own images, and forms
its offspring after human illusions. God, Spirit, works
spiritually, not materially. Brain or matter
never formed a human concept. Vibration is
not intelligence; hence it is not a creator. Immortal
ideas, pure, perfect, and enduring, are transmitted by
the divine Mind through divine Science, which corrects
error with truth and demands spiritual thoughts, divine
concepts, to the end that they may produce harmonious
results.
<P><P>Deducing one's conclusions as to man from imperfec<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_260"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 260</FONT></A></P><P><P>tion instead of perfection, one can no more arrive at the
true conception or understanding of man, and make himself like it, than the sculptor can perfect his outlines from
an imperfect model, or the painter can depict the form
and face of Jesus, while holding in thought the character
of Judas.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Spiritual discovery</FONT></P>
The conceptions of mortal, erring thought must give
way to the ideal of all that is perfect and eternal. Through
many generations human beliefs will be attaining diviner conceptions, and the immortal and
perfect model of God's creation will finally be seen as
the only true conception of being.
<P><P>Science reveals the possibility of achieving all good,
and sets mortals at work to discover what God has already
done; but distrust of one's ability to gain the goodness
desired and to bring out better and higher results, often
hampers the trial of one's wings and ensures failure at the
outset.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Requisite change of our ideals</FONT></P>
Mortals must change their ideals in order to improve
their models. A sick body is evolved from
sick thoughts. Sickness, disease, and death
proceed from fear. Sensualism evolves bad
physical and moral conditions.
<P><P>Selfishness and sensualism are educated in mortal
mind by the thoughts ever recurring to one's self, by
conversation about the body, and by the expectation of
perpetual pleasure or pain from it; and this education
is at the expense of spiritual growth.  If we array
thought in mortal vestures, it must lose its immortal
nature.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Thoughts are things</FONT></P>
If we look to the body for pleasure, we find pain; for
Life, we find death; for Truth, we find error; for Spirit,
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_261"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 261</FONT></A></P><P><P>we find its opposite, matter. Now reverse this action.
Look away from the body into Truth and Love,
the Principle of all happiness, harmony, and
immortality. Hold thought steadfastly to the enduring, the good, and the true, and you will bring these
into your experience proportionably to their occupancy
of your thoughts.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Unreality of pain</FONT></P>
The effect of mortal mind on health and happiness is
seen in this: If one turns away from the body with such
absorbed interest as to forget it, the body
experiences no pain. Under the strong impulse of a desire to perform his part, a noted actor was
accustomed night after night to go upon the stage and
sustain his appointed task, walking about as actively
as the youngest member of the company. This old man
was so lame that he hobbled every day to the theatre, and
sat aching in his chair till his cue was spoken,--a signal
which made him as oblivious of physical infirmity as if
he had inhaled chloroform, though he was in the full possession of his so-called senses.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Immutable identity of man</FONT></P>
Detach sense from the body, or matter, which is only
a form of human belief, and you may learn the meaning
of God, or good, and the nature of the immutable and immortal. Breaking away from the
mutations of time and sense, you will neither
lose the solid objects and ends of life nor your own identity. Fixing your gaze on the realities supernal, you will
rise to the spiritual consciousness of being, even as the bird
which has burst from the egg and preens its wings for a
skyward flight.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Forgetfulness of self</FONT></P>
We should forget our bodies in remembering good and
the human race. Good demands of man every hour, in
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_262"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 262</FONT></A></P><P><P>which to work out the problem of being. Consecration
to good does not lessen man's dependence on God, but
heightens it. Neither does consecration diminish man's obligations to God, but shows
the paramount necessity of meeting them. Christian
Science takes naught from the perfection of God, but it
ascribes to Him the entire glory. By putting "off the old
man with his deeds," mortals "put on immortality."
<P><P>We cannot fathom the nature and quality of God's
creation by diving into the shallows of mortal belief. We
must reverse our feeble flutterings--our efforts to find
life and truth in matter--and rise above the testimony
of the material senses, above the mortal to the immortal
idea of God. These clearer, higher views inspire the Godlike man to reach the absolute centre and circumference
of his being.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The true sense</FONT></P>
Job said: "I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the
ear: but now mine eye seeth Thee." Mortals will echo
Job's thought, when the supposed pain and
pleasure of matter cease to predominate. They
will then drop the false estimate of life and happiness, of
joy and sorrow, and attain the bliss of loving unselfishly,
working patiently, and conquering all that is unlike God.
Starting from a higher standpoint, one rises spontaneously, even as light emits light without effort; for "where
your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Mind only the cause</FONT></P>
The foundation of mortal discord is a false sense of
man's origin. To begin rightly is to end rightly. Every
concept which seems to begin with the brain
begins falsely. Divine Mind is the only cause
or Principle of existence. Cause does not exist in matter,
in mortal mind, or in physical forms.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_263"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 263</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Human egotism</FONT></P>
Mortals are egotists. They believe themselves to be
independent workers, personal authors, and even privileged originators of something which Deity
would not or could not create. The creations
of mortal mind are material. Immortal spiritual man
alone represents the truth of creation.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Mortal man a mis-creator</FONT></P>
When mortal man blends his thoughts of existence
with the spiritual and works only as God works,
he will no longer grope in the dark and cling
to earth because he has not tasted heaven.
Carnal beliefs defraud us. They make man an involuntary hypocrite,--producing evil when he would create
good, forming deformity when he would outline grace
and beauty, injuring those whom he would bless. He
becomes a general mis-creator, who believes he is a
semi-god. His "touch turns hope to dust, the dust we
all have trod." He might say in Bible language: "The
good that I would, I do not: but the evil which I would
not, that I do."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>No new creation</FONT></P>
There can be but one creator, who has created all.
Whatever seems to be a new creation, is but the discovery
of some distant idea of Truth; else it is a
new multiplication or self-division of mortal thought, as when some finite sense peers from its
cloister with amazement and attempts to pattern the
infinite.
<P><P>The multiplication of a human and mortal sense of persons and things is not creation. A sensual thought, like
an atom of dust thrown into the face of spiritual immensity, is dense blindness instead of a scientific eternal
consciousness of creation.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Mind's true camera</FONT></P>
The fading forms of matter, the mortal body and ma<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_264"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 264</FONT></A></P><P><P>terial earth, are the fleeting concepts of the human mind.
They have their day before the permanent facts and their
perfection in Spirit appear. The crude creations of mortal thought must finally give place
to the glorious forms which we sometimes behold in the
camera of divine Mind, when the mental picture is spiritual and eternal. Mortals must look beyond fading,
finite forms, if they would gain the true sense of things.
Where shall the gaze rest but in the unsearchable realm
of Mind? We must look where we would walk, and we
must act as possessing all power from Him in whom we
have our being.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Self-completeness</FONT></P>
As mortals gain more correct views of God and man,
multitudinous objects of creation, which before were
invisible, will become visible. When we
realize that Life is Spirit, never in nor of
matter, this understanding will expand into self-completeness, finding all in God, good, and needing no other
consciousness.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Spiritual proofs of existence</FONT></P>
Spirit and its formations are the only realities of being.
Matter disappears under the microscope of Spirit. Sin
is unsustained by Truth, and sickness and
death were overcome by Jesus, who proved
them to be forms of error. Spiritual living
and blessedness are the only evidences, by which we can
recognize true existence and feel the unspeakable peace
which comes from an all-absorbing spiritual love.
<P><P>When we learn the way in Christian Science and recognize man's spiritual being, we shall behold and understand God's creation,--all the glories of earth and heaven
and man.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Godward gravitation</FONT></P>
The universe of Spirit is peopled with spiritual beings,
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_265"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 265</FONT></A></P><P><P>and its government is divine Science. Man is the offspring, not of the lowest, but of the highest qualities of
Mind. Man understands spiritual existence
in proportion as his treasures of Truth and
Love are enlarged. Mortals must gravitate Godward,
their affections and aims grow spiritual,--they must near
the broader interpretations of being, and gain some proper
sense of the infinite,--in order that sin and mortality
may be put off.
<P><P>This scientific sense of being, forsaking matter for
Spirit, by no means suggests man's absorption into Deity
and the loss of his identity, but confers upon man enlarged individuality, a wider sphere of thought and action,
a more expansive love, a higher and more permanent
peace.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Mortal birth and death</FONT></P>
The senses represent birth as untimely and death as
irresistible, as if man were a weed growing apace or a
flower withered by the sun and nipped by
untimely frosts; but this is true only of a
mortal, not of a man in God's image and likeness. The
truth of being is perennial, and the error is unreal and
obsolete.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Blessings from pain</FONT></P>
Who that has felt the loss of human peace has not gained
stronger desires for spiritual joy? The aspiration after
heavenly good comes even before we discover
what belongs to wisdom and Love. The loss
of earthly hopes and pleasures brightens the ascending
path of many a heart. The pains of sense quickly inform
us that the pleasures of sense are mortal and that joy is
spiritual.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Decapitation of error</FONT></P>
The pains of sense are salutary, if they wrench away
false pleasurable beliefs and transplant the affections
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_266"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 266</FONT></A></P><P><P>from sense to Soul, where the creations of God are good,
"rejoicing the heart." Such is the sword of
Science, with which Truth decapitates error,
materiality giving place to man's higher individuality and
destiny.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Uses of adversity</FONT></P>
Would existence without personal friends be to you
a blank? Then the time will come when you will be
solitary, left without sympathy; but this
seeming vacuum is already filled with divine
Love. When this hour of development comes, even if
you cling to a sense of personal joys, spiritual Love will
force you to accept what best promotes your growth.
Friends will betray and enemies will slander, until the
lesson is sufficient to exalt you; for "man's extremity
is God's opportunity." The author has experienced the
foregoing prophecy and its blessings. Thus He teaches
mortals to lay down their fleshliness and gain spirituality.
This is done through self-abnegation. Universal Love
is the divine way in Christian Science.
<P><P>The sinner makes his own hell by doing evil, and the
saint his own heaven by doing right. The opposite persecutions of material sense, aiding evil with evil, would
deceive the very elect.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Beatific presence</FONT></P>
Mortals must follow Jesus' sayings and his demonstrations, which dominate the flesh. Perfect and infinite
Mind enthroned is heaven. The evil beliefs
which originate in mortals are hell. Man is the
idea of Spirit; he reflects the beatific presence, illuming
the universe with light. Man is deathless, spiritual. He
is above sin or frailty. He does not cross the barriers 
of time into the vast forever of Life, but he coexists with
God and the universe.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_267"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 267</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The infinitude of God</FONT></P>
Every object in material thought will be destroyed, but
the spiritual idea, whose substance is in Mind, is eternal.
The offspring of God start not from matter
or ephemeral dust. They are in and of Spirit,
divine Mind, and so forever continue. God is one. The
allness of Deity is His oneness. Generically man is one,
and specifically man means all men.
<P><P>It is generally conceded that God is Father, eternal, selfcreated, infinite. If this is so, the forever Father must
have had children prior to Adam. The great I AM made
all "that was made." Hence man and the spiritual universe coexist with God.
<P><P>Christian Scientists understand that, in a religious
sense, they have the same authority for the appellative
mother, as for that of brother and sister. Jesus said:
"For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which
is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and
mother."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Waymarks to eternal Truth</FONT></P>
When examined in the light of divine Science, mortals
present more than is detected upon the surface, since
inverted thoughts and erroneous beliefs must
be counterfeits of Truth. Thought is borrowed from a higher source than matter, and
by reversal, errors serve as waymarks to the one Mind,
in which all error disappears in celestial Truth. The
robes of Spirit are "white and glistering," like the raiment
of Christ. Even in this world, therefore, "let thy garments be always white." "Blessed is the man that endureth [overcometh] temptation: for when he is tried,
[proved faithful], he shall receive the crown of life,
which the Lord hath promised to them that love him."
(James i. 12.)
