<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Chapter V - Animal Magnetism Unmasked</H1>
<P><P><A NAME="pg_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A></P><P><P>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: these are the things which
defile a man.-- JESUS.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Earliest investigations</FONT></P>
MESMERISM or animal magnetism was first brought
into notice by Mesmer in Germany in 1775. According to the American Cyclopaedia, he regarded this
so-called force, which he said could be exerted by one living organism over another, as
a means of alleviating disease. His propositions were
as follows :
<P><P>"There exists a mutual influence between the celestial
bodies, the earth, and animated things. Animal bodies
are susceptible to the influence of this agent, disseminating itself through the substance of the nerves."
<P><P>In 1784, the French government ordered the medical
faculty of Paris to investigate Mesmer's theory and to
report upon it. Under this order a commission was
appointed, and Benjamin Franklin was one of the commissioners. This commission reported to the government as follows:
<P><P>"In regard to the existence and utility of animal magnetism, we have come to the unanimous conclusions that
there is no proof of the existence of the animal magnetic
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_101"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 101</FONT></A></P><P><P>fluid; that the violent effects, which are observed in 
the public practice of magnetism, are due to manipulations, or to the excitement of the imagination and the 
impressions made upon the senses; and that there is one
more fact to be recorded in the history of the errors of
the human mind, and an important experiment upon 
the power of the imagination."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Clairvoyance, magnetism</FONT></P>
In 1837, a committee of nine persons was appointed,
among whom were Roux, Bouillaud, and Cloquet, which tested during several sessions the 
phenomena exhibited by a reputed clairvoyant. Their
report stated the results as follows:     
<P><P>"The facts which had been promised by Monsieur
Berna [the magnetizer] as conclusive, and as adapted to
throw light on physiological and therapeutical questions,
are certainly not conclusive in favor of the doctrine of
animal magnetism, and have nothing in common with
either physiology or therapeutics."      
<P><P>This report was adopted by the Royal Academy of
Medicine in Paris.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Personal conclusions</FONT></P>
The author's own observations of the workings of 
animal magnetism convince her that it is not 
a remedial agent, and that its effects upon 
those who practise it, and upon their subjects who do 
not resist it, lead to moral and to physical death.
<P><P>If animal magnetism seems to alleviate or to cure disease, this appearance is deceptive, since error cannot 
remove the effects of error. Discomfort under error is
preferable to comfort. In no instance is the effect of
animal magnetism, recently called hypnotism, other 
than the effect of illusion. Any seeming benefit derived
from it is proportional to one's faith in esoteric magic.
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A></P><P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Mere negation</FONT></P>
Animal magnetism has no scientific foundation, for
God governs all that is real, harmonious, and eternal, and
His power is neither animal nor human. Its
basis being a belief and this belief animal, in
Science animal magnetism, mesmerism, or hypnotism is
a mere negation, possessing neither intelligence, power,
nor reality, and in sense it is an unreal concept of the socalled mortal mind.
<P><P>There is but one real attraction, that of Spirit. The
pointing of the needle to the pole symbolizes this allembracing power or the attraction of God, divine Mind.
<P><P>The planets have no more power over man than over
his Maker, since God governs the universe; but man,
reflecting God's power, has dominion over all the earth
and its hosts.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Hidden agents</FONT></P>
The mild forms of animal magnetism are disappearing, and its aggressive features are coming to the front.
The looms of crime, hidden in the dark recesses of mortal thought, are every hour weaving webs more complicated and subtle. So secret are the
present methods of animal magnetism that they ensnare
the age into indolence, and produce the very apathy on
the subject which the criminal desires. The following
is an extract from the Boston Herald:
<P><P>"Mesmerism is a problem not lending itself to an easy
explanation and development. It implies the exercise
of despotic control, and is much more likely to be abused
by its possessor, than otherwise employed, for the individual or society."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Mental despotism</FONT></P>
Mankind must learn that evil is not power. Its socalled despotism is but a phase of nothingness. Christian
Science despoils the kingdom of evil, and pre-eminently
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A></P><P><P>promotes affection and virtue in families and therefore
in the community. The Apostle Paul refers to the
personification of evil as "the god of this
world," and further defines it as dishonesty
and craftiness. Sin was the Assyrian moon-god.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Liberation of mental powers</FONT></P>
The destruction of the claims of mortal mind through
Science, by which man can escape from sin
and mortality, blesses the whole human family. As in the beginning, however, this liberation does not scientifically show itself in a knowledge of
both good and evil, for the latter is unreal.
<P><P>On the other hand, Mind-science is wholly separate
from any half-way impertinent knowledge, because Mindscience is of God and demonstrates the divine Principle,
working out the purposes of good only. The maximum
of good is the infinite God and His idea, the All-in-all.
Evil is a suppositional lie.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The genus of error</FONT></P>
As named in Christian Science, animal magnetism or 
hypnotism is the specific term for error, or mortal mind.
It is the false belief that mind is in matter, and
is both evil and good; that evil is as real as
good and more powerful. This belief has not one quality of Truth. It is either ignorant or malicious. The
malicious form of hypnotism ultimates in moral idiocy.
The truths of immortal Mind sustain man, and they annihilate the fables of mortal mind, whose flimsy and gaudy
pretensions, like silly moths, singe their own wings and
fall into dust.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Thought-transference</FONT></P>
In reality there is no mortal mind, and consequently no transference of mortal thought
and will-power. Life and being are of
God. In Christian Science, man can do no harm, for
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A></P><P><P>scientific thoughts are true thoughts, passing from God
to man.
<P><P>When Christian Science and animal magnetism are
both comprehended, as they will be at no distant date,
it will be seen why the author of this book has been
so unjustly persecuted and belied by wolves in sheep's
clothing.
<P><P>Agassiz, the celebrated naturalist and author, has
wisely said: "Every great scientific truth goes through
three stages. First, people say it conflicts with the Bible.
Next, they say it has been discovered before. Lastly,
they say they have always believed it."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Perfection of divine government</FONT></P>
Christian Science goes to the bottom of mental action,
and reveals the theodicy which indicates the rightness of
all divine action, as the emanation of divine
Mind, and the consequent wrongness of the
opposite so-called action,--evil, occultism,
necromancy, mesmerism, animal magnetism, hypnotism.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Adulteration of Truth</FONT></P>
The medicine of Science is divine Mind; and dishonesty,
sensuality, falsehood, revenge, malice, are animal propensities and by no means the mental qualities which heal the sick. The hypnotizer
employs one error to destroy another. If he heals sickness through a belief, and a belief originally caused the
sickness, it is a case of the greater error overcoming the
lesser. This greater error thereafter occupies the ground,
leaving the case worse than before it was grasped by the
stronger error.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Motives considered</FONT></P>
Our courts recognize evidence to prove the motive as
well as the commission of a crime. Is it not
clear that the human mind must move the
body to a wicked act? Is not mortal mind the mur<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A></P><P><P>derer? The hands, without mortal mind to direct them,
could not commit a murder.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Mental crimes</FONT></P>
Courts and juries judge and sentence mortals in order to restrain crime, to prevent deeds of violence or to punish
them. To say that these tribunals have no 
jurisdiction over the carnal or mortal mind,
would be to contradict precedent and to admit that the
power of human law is restricted to matter, while mortal
mind, evil, which is the real outlaw, defies justice and is
recommended to mercy. Can matter commit a crime?
Can matter be punished? Can you separate the mentality from the body over which courts hold jurisdiction?
Mortal mind, not matter, is the criminal in every case;
and human law rightly estimates crime, and courts reasonably pass sentence, according to the motive.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Important decision</FONT></P>
When our laws eventually take cognizance of mental
crime and no longer apply legal rulings wholly to physical
offences, these words of Judge Parmenter of
Boston will become historic: "I see no reason
why metaphysics is not as important to medicine as to
mechanics or mathematics."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Evil let loose</FONT></P>
Whoever uses his developed mental powers like an escaped felon to commit fresh atrocities as opportunity occurs is never safe. God will arrest him. Divine justice will manacle him. His sins will
be millstones about his neck, weighing him down to the
depths of ignominy and death. The aggravation of error foretells its doom, and confirms the ancient axiom:
"Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad."
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>The misuse of mental power</FONT></P>
The distance from ordinary medical practice to Christian Science is full many a league
in the line of light; but to go in healing from the use of
<P><P><P><A NAME="pg_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A></P><P><P>inanimate drugs to the criminal misuse of human willpower, is to drop from the platform of common manhood
into the very mire of iniquity, to work against the free
course of honesty and justice, and to push vainly against
the current running heavenward.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Proper self-government</FONT></P>
Like our nation, Christian Science has its Declaration
of Independence. God has endowed man with inalienable rights, among which are self-government,
reason, and conscience. Man is properly selfgoverned only when he is guided rightly and governed by
his Maker, divine Truth and Love.
<P><P>Man's rights are invaded when the divine order is interfered with, and the mental trespasser incurs the divine
penalty due this crime.
<P><P><P><FONT SIZE=1>Right methods</FONT></P>
Let this age, which sits in judgment on Christian
Science, sanction only such methods as are demonstrable
in Truth and known by their fruit, and classify
all others as did St. Paul in his great epistle
to the Galatians, when he wrote as follows:
<P><P>"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are
these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness,
revellings and such like: of the which I tell you before,
as I have also told you in time past, that they which do
such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But
the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against
such there is no law."
