# PREFACE

<span id="pg_vi">p. vi</span>

To those leaning on the sustaining infinite, to-day is big with
blessings. The wakeful shepherd beholds the first faint morning beams,
ere cometh the full radiance of a risen day. So shone the pale star to
the prophetshepherds; yet it traversed the night, and came where, in
cradled obscurity, lay the Bethlehem babe, the human herald of Christ,
Truth, who would make plain to benighted understanding the way of
salvation through Christ Jesus, till across a night of error should dawn
the morning beams and shine the guiding star of being. The Wisemen were
led to behold and to follow this daystar of divine Science, lighting the
way to eternal harmony. The time for thinkers has come. Truth,
independent of doctrines and time-honored systems, knocks at the portal
of humanity. Contentment with the past and the cold conventionality of
materialism are crumbling away. Ignorance of God is no longer the
steppingstone to faith. The only guarantee of obedience is a right
apprehension of Him whom to know aright is Life eternal. Though empires
fall, "the Lord shall reign forever." A book introduces new thoughts,
but it cannot make them speedily understood. It is the task of the
sturdy pioneer to hew the tall oak and to cut the rough granite. Future
ages must declare what the pioneer has accomplished.

Since the author's discovery of the might of Truth in

<span id="pg_viii">p. viii</span>

the treatment of disease as well as of sin, her system has been fully
tested and has not been found wanting; but to reach the heights of
Christian Science, man must live in obedience to its divine Principle.
To develop the full might of this Science, the discords of corporeal
sense must yield to the harmony of spiritual sense, even as the science
of music corrects false tones and gives sweet concord to sound.

Theology and physics teach that both Spirit and matter are real and
good, whereas the fact is that Spirit is good and real, and matter is
Spirit's opposite. The question, What is Truth, is answered by
demonstration, by healing both disease and sin; and this demonstration
shows that Christian healing confers the most health and makes the best
men. On this basis Christian Science will have a fair fight. Sickness
has been combated for centuries by doctors using material remedies; but
the question arises, Is there less sickness because of these
practitioners? A vigorous "No" is the response deducible from two
connate facts,--the reputed longevity of the Antediluvians, and the
rapid multiplication and increased violence of diseases since the flood.

In the author's work, RETROSPECTION AND INTROSPECTION, may be found a
biographical sketch, narrating experiences which led her, in the year
1866, to the discovery of the system that she denominated Christian
Science. As early as 1862 she began to write down and give to friends
the results of her Scriptural study, for the Bible was her sole teacher;
but these compositions were crude, the first steps of a child in the
newly discovered world of Spirit.

<span id="pg_ix">p. ix</span>

She also began to jot down her thoughts on the main subject, but these
jottings were only infantile lispings of Truth. A child drinks in the
outward world through the eyes and rejoices in the draught. He is as
sure of the world's existence as he is of his own; yet he cannot
describe the world. He finds a few words, and with these he stammeringly
attempts to convey his feeling. Later, the tongue voices the more
definite thought, though still imperfectly. So was it with the author.
As a certain poet says of himself, she "lisped in numbers, for the
numbers came." Certain essays written at that early date are still in
circulation among her first pupils; but they are feeble attempts to
state the Principle and practice of Christian healing, and are not
complete nor satisfactory expositions of Truth. To-day, though rejoicing
in some progress, she still finds herself a willing disciple at the
heavenly gate, waiting for the Mind of Christ.

Her first pamphlet on Christian Science was copyrighted in 1870 ; but it
did not appear in print until 1876, as she had learned that this Science
must be demonstrated by healing, before a work on the subject could be
profitably studied. From 1867 until 1875, copies were, however, in
friendly circulation.

Before writing this work, SCIENCE AND HEALTH, she made copious notes of
Scriptural exposition, which have never been published. This was during
the years 1867 and 1868. These efforts show her comparative ignorance of
the stupendous Life-problem up to that time, and the degrees by which
she came at length to its solution; but she values them as a parent

<span id="pg_x">p. x</span>

may treasure the memorials of a child's growth, and she would not have
them changed.

The first edition of SCIENCE AND HEALTH was published in 1875. Various
books on mental healing have since been issued, most of them incorrect
in theory and filled with plagiarisms from SCIENCE AND HEALTH. They
regard the human mind as a healing agent, whereas this mind is not a
factor in the Principle of Christian Science. A few books, however,
which are based on this book, are useful.

The author has not compromised conscience to suit the general drift of
thought, but has bluntly and honestly given the text of Truth. She has
made no effort to embellish, elaborate, or treat in full detail so
infinite a theme. By thousands of well-authenticated cases of healing,
she and her students have proved the worth of her teachings. These cases
for the most part have been abandoned as hopeless by regular medical
attendants. Few invalids will turn to God till all physical supports
have failed, because there is so little faith in His disposition and
power to heal disease.

The divine Principle of healing is proved in the personal experience of
any sincere seeker of Truth. Its purpose is good, and its practice is
safer and more potent than that of any other sanitary method. The
unbiased Christian thought is soonest touched by Truth, and convinced of
it. Only those quarrel with her method who do not understand her
meaning, or discerning the truth, come not to the light lest their works
be reproved. No intellectual proficiency is requisite in the learner,
but sound morals are most desirable.

<span id="pg_xi">p. xi</span>

Many imagine that the phenomena of physical healing in Christian Science
present only a phase of the action of the human mind, which action in
some unexplained way results in the cure of disease. On the contrary,
Christian Science rationally explains that all other pathological
methods are the fruits of human faith in matter, faith in the workings,
not of Spirit, but of the fleshly mind which must yield to Science.

The physical healing of Christian Science results now, as in Jesus'
time, from the operation of divine Principle, before which sin and
disease lose their reality in human consciousness and disappear as
naturally and as necessarily as darkness gives place to light and sin to
reformation. Now, as then, these mighty works are not supernatural, but
supremely natural. They are the sign of Immanuel, or "God with us," a
divine influence ever present in human consciousness and repeating
itself, coming now as was promised aforetime,

   To preach deliverance to the captives \[of sense\],  
   And recovering of sight to the blind,  
   To set at liberty them that are bruised.  

When God called the author to proclaim His Gospel to this age, there
came also the charge to plant and water His vineyard.

The first school of Christian Science Mind-healing was started by the
author with only one student in Lynn, Massachusetts, about the year
1867. In 1881, she opened the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in
Boston, under the seal of the Commonwealth, a law relative to colleges
having been passed, which enabled her to get this institution chartered
for medical pur

<span id="pg_xii ">p. xii</span>

poses. No charters were granted to Christian Scientists for such
institutions after 1883, and up to that date, hers was the only College
of this character which had been established in the United States, where
Christian Science was first introduced.

During seven years over four thousand students were taught by the author
in this College. Meanwhile she was pastor of the first established
Church of Christ, Scientist; President of the first Christian Scientist
Association, convening monthly; publisher of her own works; and (for a
portion of this time) sole editor and publisher of the Christian Science
Journal, the first periodical issued by Christian Scientists. She closed
her College, October 29, 1889, in the height of its prosperity with a
deep-lying conviction that the next two years of her life should be
given to the preparation of the revision of SCIENCE AND HEALTH, which
was published in 1891. She retained her charter, and as its President,
reopened the College in 1899 as auxiliary to her church. Until June 10,
1907, she had never read this book throughout consecutively in order to
elucidate her idealism.

In the spirit of Christ's charity, as one who "hopeth all things,
endureth all things," and is joyful to bear consolation to the sorrowing
and healing to the sick, she commits these pages to honest seekers for
Truth.
