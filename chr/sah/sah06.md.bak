# Chapter VI - Science, Theology, Medicine

<span id="pg_107">p. 107</span>

But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is
not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught
it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.--PAUL.

The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid
in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.--JESUS.

Christian Science discovered

In the year 1866, I discovered the Christ Science or divine laws of
Life, Truth, and Love, and named my discovery Christian Science. God had
been graciously preparing me during many years for the reception of this
final revelation of the absolute divine Principle of scientific mental
healing.

Mission of Christian Science

This apodictical Principle points to the revelation of Immanuel, "God
with us," - the sovereign ever-presence, delivering the children of men
from every ill "that flesh is heir to." Through Christian Science,
religion and medicine are inspired with a diviner nature and essence;
fresh pinions are given to faith and understanding, and thoughts
acquaint themselves intelligently with God.

Discontent with life

Feeling so perpetually the false consciousness that life inheres in the
body, yet remembering that in reality God is our Life, we may well
tremble in the prospect of those days in which we must say, "I have no
pleasure in them."

<span id="pg_108">p. 108</span>

Whence came to me this heavenly conviction, - a conviction antagonistic
to the testimony of the physical senses? According to St. Paul, it was
"the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of
His power." It was the divine law of Life and Love, unfolding to me the
demonstrable fact that matter possesses neither sensation nor life; that
human experiences show the falsity of all material things; and that
immortal cravings, "the price of learning love," establish the truism
that the only sufferer is mortal mind, for the divine Mind cannot
suffer.

Demonstrable evidence

My conclusions were reached by allowing the evidence of this revelation
to multiply with mathematical certainty and the lesser demonstration to
prove the greater, as the product of three multiplied by three,
equalling nine, proves conclusively that three times three duodecillions
must be nine duodecillions,--not a fraction more, not a unit less.

Light shining in darkness

When apparently near the confines of mortal existence, standing already
within the shadow of the death-valley, I learned these truths in divine
Science: that all real being is in God, the divine Mind, and that Life,
Truth, and Love are all-powerful and everpresent; that the opposite of
Truth,--called error, sin, sickness, disease, death,--is the false
testimony of false material sense, of mind in matter; that this false
sense evolves, in belief, a subjective state of mortal mind which this
same so-called mind names matter thereby shutting out the true sense of
Spirit.

New lines of thought

My discovery, that erring, mortal, misnamed mind produces all the
organism and action of the mortal body, set my thoughts to work in new
channels,

<span id="pg_109">p. 109</span>

and led up to my demonstration of the proposition that Mind is All and
matter is naught as the leading factor in Mind-science.

Scientific evidence

Christian Science reveals incontrovertibly that Mind is All-in-all, that
the only realities are the divine Mind and idea. This great fact is not,
however, seen to be supported by sensible evidence, until its divine
Principle is demonstrated by healing the sick and thus proved absolute
and divine. This proof once seen, no other conclusion can be reached.

Solitary research

For three years after my discovery, I sought the solution of this
problem of Mind-healing, searched the Scriptures and read little else,
kept aloof from society, and devoted time and energies to discovering a
positive rule. The search was sweet, calm, and buoyant with hope, not
selfish nor depressing. I knew the Principle of all harmonious
Mind-action to be God, and that cures were produced in primitive
Christian healing by holy, uplifting faith; but I must know the Science
of this healing, and I won my way to absolute conclusions through divine
revelation, reason, and demonstration. The revelation of Truth in the
understanding came to me gradually and apparently through divine power.
When a new spiritual idea is borne to earth, the prophetic Scripture of
Isaiah is renewedly fulfilled: "Unto us a child is born, . . . and his
name shall be called Wonderful."

Jesus once said of his lessons: "My doctrine is not mine, but His that
sent me. If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." (John vii. 16, 17.)

God's allness learned The three great verities of Spirit, omnipotence,
omni

<span id="pg_110">p. 110</span>

presence, omniscience,--Spirit possessing all power, filling all space,
constituting all Science,--contradict forever the belief that matter can
be actual. These eternal verities reveal primeval existence as the
radiant reality of God's creation, in which all that He has made is
pronounced by His wisdom good.

Thus it was that I beheld, as never before, the awful unreality called
evil. The equipollence of God brought to light another glorious
proposition, - man's perfectibility and the establishment of the kingdom
of heaven on earth.

Scriptural foundations

In following these leadings of scientific revelation, the Bible was my
only textbook. The Scriptures were illumined; reason and revelation were
reconciled, and afterwards the truth of Christian Science was
demonstrated. No human pen nor tongue taught me the Science contained in
this book, SCIENCE AND HEALTH; and neither tongue nor pen can overthrow
it. This book may be distorted by shallow criticism or by careless or
malicious students, and its ideas may be temporarily abused and
misrepresented; but the Science and truth therein will forever remain to
be discerned and demonstrated.

The demonstration lost and found

Jesus demonstrated the power of Christian Science to heal mortal minds
and bodies. But this power was lost sight of, and must again be
spiritually discerned, taught, and demonstrated according to Christ's
command, with "signs following." Its Science must be apprehended by as
many as believe on Christ and spiritually understand Truth.

Mystical antagonists

No analogy exists between the vague hypotheses of

<span id="pg_111">p. 111</span>

agnosticism, pantheism, theosophy, spiritualism, or millenarianism and
the demonstrable truths of Christian Science; and I find the will, or
sensuous reason of the human mind, to be opposed to the divine Mind as
expressed through divine Science.

Optical illustration of Science

Christian Science is natural, but not physical. The Science of God and
man is no more supernatural than is the science of numbers, though
departing from the realm of the physical, as the Science of God, Spirit,
must, some may deny its right to the name of Science. The Principle of
divine metaphysics is God; the practice of divine metaphysics is the
utilization of the power of Truth over error; its rules demonstrate its
Science. Divine metaphysics reverses perverted and physical hypotheses
as to Deity, even as the explanation of optics rejects the incidental or
inverted image and shows what this inverted image is meant to represent.

Pertinent proposal

A prize of one hundred pounds, offered in Oxford University, England,
for the best essay on Natural Science, - an essay calculated to offset
the tendency of the age to attribute physical effects to physical causes
rather than to a final spiritual cause,--is one of many incidents which
show that Christian Science meets a yearning of the human race for
spirituality.

Confirmatory tests

After a lengthy examination of my discovery and its demonstration in
healing the sick, this fact became evident to me,--that Mind governs the
body, not partially but wholly. I submitted my metaphysical system of
treating disease to the broadest practical tests. Since then this system
has gradually gained ground, and has proved itself, whenever scien

<span id="pg_112">p. 112</span>

tifically employed, to be the most effective curative agent in medical
practice.

One school of Truth

Is there more than one school of Christian Science? Christian Science is
demonstrable. There can, therefore, be but one method in its teaching.
Those who depart from this method forfeit their claims to belong to its
school, and they become adherents of the Socratic, the Platonic, the
Spencerian, or some other school. By this is meant that they adopt and
adhere to some particular system of human opinions. Although these
opinions may have occasional gleams of divinity, borrowed from that
truly divine Science which eschews man-made systems, they nevertheless
remain wholly human in their origin and tendency and are not
scientifically Christian.

Unchanging Principle

From the infinite One in Christian Science comes one Principle and its
infinite idea, and with this infinitude come spiritual rules, laws, and
their demonstration, which, like the great Giver, are "the same
yesterday, and to-day, and forever;" for thus are the divine Principle
of healing and the Christ-idea characterized in the epistle to the
Hebrews.

On sandy foundations

Any theory of Christian Science, which departs from what has already
been stated and proved to be true, affords no foundation upon which to
establish a genuine school of this Science. Also, if any so-called new
school claims to be Christian Science, and yet uses another author's
discoveries without giving that author proper credit, such a school is
erroneous, for it inculcates a breach of that divine commandment in the
Hebrew Decalogue, "Thou shalt not steal."

Principle and practice

God is the Principle of divine metaphysics. As there

<span id="pg_113">p. 113</span>

is but one God, there can be but one divine Principle of all Science;
and there must be fixed rules for the demonstration of this divine
Principle. The letter of Science plentifully reaches humanity to-day,
but its spirit comes only in small degrees. The vital part, the heart
and soul of Christian Science, is Love. Without this, the letter is but
the dead body of Science, pulseless, cold, inanimate.

Reversible propositions

The fundamental propositions of divine metaphysics are summarized in the
four following, to me, self-evident propositions. Even if reversed,
these propositions will be found to agree in statement and proof,
showing mathematically their exact relation to Truth. De Quincey says
mathematics has not a foot to stand upon which is not purely
metaphysical.

1\. God is All-in-all.  
2. God is good. Good is Mind.  
3. God, Spirit, being all, nothing is matter.  
4. Life, God, omnipotent good, deny death, evil, sin, disease. -
Disease, sin, evil, death, deny good, omnipotent God, Life.  

Which of the denials in proposition four is true? Both are not, cannot
be, true. According to the Scripture, I find that God is true, "but
every \[mortal\] man a liar."

Metaphysical inversions

The divine metaphysics of Christian Science, like the method in
mathematics, proves the rule by inversion. For example: There is no pain
in Truth, and no truth in pain; no nerve in Mind, and no mind in nerve;
no matter in Mind, and no mind in matter; no matter in Life, and no life
in matter; no matter in good, and no good in matter.

<span id="pg_114">p. 114</span>

Definition of mortal mind

Usage classes both evil and good together as mind; therefore, to be
understood, the author calls sick and sinful humanity mortal
mind,--meaning by this term the flesh opposed to Spirit, the human mind
and evil in contradistinction to the divine Mind, or Truth and good. The
spiritually unscientific definition of mind is based on the evidence of
the physical senses, which makes minds many and calls mind both human
and divine.

In Science, Mind is one, including noumenon and phenomena, God and His
thoughts.

Imperfect terminology

Mortal mind is a solecism in language, and involves an improper use of
the word mind. As Mind is immortal, the phrase mortal mind implies
something untrue and therefore unreal; and as the phrase is used in
teaching Christian Science, it is meant to designate that which has no
real existence. Indeed, if a better word or phrase could be suggested,
it would be used; but in expressing the new tongue we must sometimes
recur to the old and imperfect, and the new wine of the Spirit has to be
poured into the old bottles of the letter.

Causation mental

Christian Science explains all cause and effect as mental, not physical.
It lifts the veil of mystery from Soul and body. It shows the scientific
relation of man to God, disentangles the interlaced ambiguities of
being, and sets free the imprisoned thought. In divine Science, the
universe, including man, is spiritual, harmonious, and eternal. Science
shows that what is termed matter is but the subjective state of what is
termed by the author mortal mind.

Philological inadequacy

Apart from the usual opposition to everything new,

<span id="pg_115">p. 115</span>

the one great obstacle to the reception of that spirituality, through
which the understanding of Mind-science comes, is the inadequacy of
material terms for metaphysical statements, and the consequent
difficulty of so expressing metaphysical ideas as to make them
comprehensible to any reader, who has not personally demonstrated
Christian Science as brought forth in my discovery. Job says: "The ear
trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat." The great difficulty is to
give the right impression, when translating material terms back into the
original spiritual tongue.

SCIENTIFIC TRANSLATION OF IMMORTAL MIND

Divine synonyms

GOD: Divine Principle, Life, Truth, Love, Soul, Spirit, Mind.

Divine image

MAN: God's spiritual idea, individual, perfect, eternal.

Divine reflection

IDEA: An image in Mind; the immediate object of understanding.--Webster.

SCIENTIFIC TRANSLATION OF MORTAL MIND

First Degree: Depravity.

Unreality

PHYSICAL. Evil beliefs, passions and appetites, fear, depraved will,
self-justification, pride, envy, deceit, hatred, revenge, sin, sickness,
disease, death.

Second Degree: Evil beliefs disappearing.

Transitional qualities

MORAL. Humanity, honesty, affection, compassion, hope, faith, meekness,
temperance.

<span id="pg_116">p. 116</span>

Third Degree: Understanding.

Reality

SPIRITUAL. Wisdom, purity, spiritual understanding, spiritual power,
love, health, holiness.

Spiritual universe

In the third degree mortal mind disappears, and man as God's image
appears. Science so reverses the evidence before the corporeal human
senses, as to make this Scriptural testimony true in our hearts, "The
last shall be first, and the first last," so that God and His idea may
be to us what divinity really is and must of necessity
be,--all-inclusive.

Aim of Science

A correct view of Christian Science and of its adaptation to healing
includes vastly more than is at first seen. Works on metaphysics leave
the grand point untouched. They never crown the power of Mind as the
Messiah, nor do they carry the day against physical enemies,--even to
the extinction of all belief in matter, evil, disease, and death,--nor
insist upon the fact that God is all, therefore that matter is nothing
beyond an image in mortal mind.

Divine personality

Christian Science strongly emphasizes the thought that God is not
corporeal, but incorporeal,--that is, bodiless. Mortals are corporeal,
but God is incorporeal.

As the words person and personal are commonly and ignorantly employed,
they often lead, when applied to Deity, to confused and erroneous
conceptions of divinity and its distinction from humanity. If the term
personality, as applied to God, means infinite personality, then God is
infinite Person,--in the sense of infinite personality, but not in the
lower sense. An infinite Mind in a finite form is an absolute
impossibility.

<span id="pg_117">p. 117</span>

The term individuality is also open to objections, because an individual
may be one of a series, one of many, as an individual man, an individual
horse; whereas God is One,--not one of a series, but one alone and
without an equal.

Spiritual language

God is Spirit; therefore the language of Spirit must be, and is,
spiritual. Christian Science attaches no physical nature and
significance to the Supreme Being or His manifestation; mortals alone do
this. God's essential language is spoken of in the last chapter of
Mark's Gospel as the new tongue, the spiritual meaning of which is
attained through "signs following."

The miracles of Jesus

Ear hath not heard, nor hath lip spoken, the pure language of Spirit.
Our Master taught spirituality by similitudes and parables. As a divine
student he unfolded God to man, illustrating and demonstrating Life and
Truth in himself and by his power over the sick and sinning. Human
theories are inadequate to interpret the divine Principle involved in
the miracles (marvels) wrought by Jesus and especially in his mighty,
crowning, unparalleled, and triumphant exit from the flesh.

Opacity of the senses

Evidence drawn from the five physical senses relates solely to human
reason; and because of opacity to the true light, human reason dimly
reflects and feebly transmits Jesus' works and words. Truth is a
revelation.

Leaven of Truth

Jesus bade his disciples beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of
the Sadducees, which he defined as human doctrines. His parable of the
"leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures

<span id="pg_118">p. 118</span>

of meal, till the whole was leavened," impels the inference that the
spiritual leaven signifies the Science of Christ and its spiritual
interpretation,--an inference far above the merely ecclesiastical and
formal applications of the illustration.

Did not this parable point a moral with a prophecy, foretelling the
second appearing in the flesh of the Christ, Truth, hidden in sacred
secrecy from the visible world?

Ages pass, but this leaven of Truth is ever at work. It must destroy the
entire mass of error, and so be eternally glorified in man's spiritual
freedom.

The divine and human contrasted

In their spiritual significance, Science, Theology, and Medicine are
means of divine thought, which include spiritual laws emanating from the
invisible and infinite power and grace. The parable may import that
these spiritual laws, perverted by a perverse material sense of law, are
metaphysically presented as three measures of meal,--that is, three
modes of mortal thought. In all mortal forms of thought, dust is
dignified as the natural status of men and things, and modes of material
motion are honored with the name of laws. This continues until the
leaven of Spirit changes the whole of mortal thought, as yeast changes
the chemical properties of meal.

Certain contradictions

The definitions of material law, as given by natural science, represent
a kingdom necessarily divided against itself, because these definitions
portray law as physical, not spiritual. Therefore they contradict the
divine decrees and violate the law of Love, in which nature and God are
one and the natural order of heaven comes down to earth.

<span id="pg_119">p. 119</span>

Unescapable dilemma

When we endow matter with vague spiritual power, that is, when we do so
in our theories, for of course we cannot really endow matter with what
it does not and cannot possess, - we disown the Almighty, for such
theories lead to one of two things. They either presuppose the
self-evolution and self-government of matter, or else they assume that
matter is the product of Spirit. To seize the first horn of this dilemma
and consider matter as a power in and of itself, is to leave the creator
out of His own universe; while to grasp the other horn of the dilemma
and regard God as the creator of matter, is not only to make Him
responsible for all disasters, physical and moral, but to announce Him
as their source, thereby making Him guilty of maintaining perpetual
misrule in the form and under the name of natural law.

God and nature

In one sense God is identical with nature, but this nature is spiritual
and is not expressed in matter. The lawgiver, whose lightning palsies or
prostrates in death the child at prayer, is not the divine ideal of
omnipresent Love. God is natural good, and is represented only by the
idea of goodness; while evil should be regarded as unnatural, because it
is opposed to the nature of Spirit, God.

The sun and Soul

In viewing the sunrise, one finds that it contradicts the evidence
before the senses to believe that the earth is in motion and the sun at
rest. As astronomy reverses the human perception of the movement of the
solar system, so Christian Science reverses the seeming relation of Soul
and body and makes body tributary to Mind. Thus it is with man, who is
but the humble servant of the restful Mind, though it

<span id="pg_120">p. 120</span>

seems otherwise to finite sense. But we shall never understand this
while we admit that soul is in body or mind in matter, and that man is
included in non-intelligence. Soul, or Spirit, is God, unchangeable and
eternal; and man coexists with and reflects Soul, God, for man is God's
image.

Reversal of testimony

Science reverses the false testimony of the physical senses, and by this
reversal mortals arrive at the fundamental facts of being. Then the
question inevitably arises: Is a man sick if the material senses
indicate that he is in good health? No! for matter can make no
conditions for man. And is he well if the senses say he is sick? Yes, he
is well in Science in which health is normal and disease is abnormal.

Health and the senses

Health is not a condition of matter, but of Mind; nor can the material
senses bear reliable testimony on the subject of health. The Science of
Mind-healing shows it to be impossible for aught but Mind to testify
truly or to exhibit the real status of man. Therefore the divine
Principle of Science, reversing the testimony of the physical senses,
reveals man as harmoniously existent in Truth, which is the only basis
of health; and thus Science denies all disease, heals the sick,
overthrows false evidence, and refutes materialistic logic.

Any conclusion pro or con, deduced from supposed sensation in matter or
from matter's supposed consciousness of health or disease, instead of
reversing the testimony of the physical senses, confirms that testimony
as legitimate and so leads to disease.

Historic illustrations

When Columbus gave freer breath to the globe, ignorance and superstition
chained the limbs of the brave old navigator, and disgrace and star

<span id="pg_121">p. 121</span>

vation stared him in the face; but sterner still would have been his
fate, if his discovery had undermined the favorite inclinations of a
sensuous philosophy.

Copernicus mapped out the stellar system, and before he spake,
astrography was chaotic, and the heavenly fields were incorrectly
explored.

Perennial beauty

The Chaldean Wisemen read in the stars the fate of empires and the
fortunes of men. Though no higher revelation than the horoscope was to
them displayed upon the empyrean, earth and heaven were bright, and bird
and blossom were glad in God's perennial and happy sunshine, golden with
Truth. So we have goodness and beauty to gladden the heart; but man,
left to the hypotheses of material sense unexplained by Science, is as
the wandering comet or the desolate star--"a weary searcher for a
viewless home."

Astronomic unfoldings

The earth's diurnal rotation is invisible to the physical eye, and the
sun seems to move from east to west, instead of the earth from west to
east. Until rebuked by clearer views of the everlasting facts, this
false testimony of the eye deluded the judgment and induced false
conclusions. Science shows appearances often to be erroneous, and
corrects these errors by the simple rule that the greater controls the
lesser. The sun is the central stillness, so far as our solar system is
concerned, and the earth revolves about the sun once a year, besides
turning daily on its own axis.

As thus indicated, astronomical order imitates the action of divine
Principle; and the universe, the reflection of God, is thus brought
nearer the spiritual fact, and is allied to divine Science as displayed
in the everlasting government of the universe.

<span id="pg_122">p. 122</span>

Opposing testimony

The evidence of the physical senses often reverses the real Science of
being, and so creates a reign of discord, assigning seeming power to
sin, sickness, and death; but the great facts of Life, rightly
understood, defeat this triad of errors, contradict their false
witnesses, and reveal the kingdom of heaven,--the actual reign of
harmony on earth. The material senses' reversal of the Science of Soul
was practically exposed nineteen hundred years ago by the demonstrations
of Jesus; yet these so-called senses still make mortal mind tributary to
mortal body, and ordain certain sections of matter, such as brain and
nerves, as the seats of pain and pleasure, from which matter reports to
this so-called mind its status of happiness or misery.

Testimony of the senses

The optical focus is another proof of the illusion of material sense. On
the eye's retina, sky and tree-tops apparently join hands, clouds and
ocean meet and mingle. The barometer,--that little prophet of storm and
sunshine, denying the testimony of the senses,--points to fair weather
in the midst of murky clouds and drenching rain. Experience is full of
instances of similar illusions, which every thinker can recall for
himself.

Spiritual sense of life

To material sense, the severance of the jugular vein takes away life;
but to spiritual sense and in Science, Life goes on unchanged and being
is eternal. Temporal life is a false sense of existence.

Ptolemaic and psychical error

Our theories make the same mistake regarding Soul and body that Ptolemy
made regarding the solar system. They insist that soul is in body and
mind therefore tributary to matter. Astronomical science has destroyed
the

<span id="pg_123">p. 123</span>

false theory as to the relations of the celestial bodies, and Christian
Science will surely destroy the greater error as to our terrestrial
bodies. The true idea and Principle of man will then appear. The
Ptolemaic blunder could not affect the harmony of being as does the
error relating to soul and body, which reverses the order of Science and
assigns to matter the power and prerogative of Spirit, so that man
becomes the most absolutely weak and inharmonious creature in the
universe.

Seeming and being

The verity of Mind shows conclusively how it is that matter seems to be,
but is not. Divine Science, rising above physical theories, excludes
matter, resolves things into thoughts, and replaces the objects of
material sense with spiritual ideas.

The term CHRISTIAN SCIENCE was introduced by the author to designate the
scientific system of divine healing.

The revelation consists of two parts:

1\. The discovery of this divine Science of Mindhealing, through a
spiritual sense of the Scriptures and through the teachings of the
Comforter, as promised by the Master.

2\. The proof, by present demonstration, that the socalled miracles of
Jesus did not specially belong to a dispensation now ended, but that
they illustrated an ever-operative divine Principle. The operation of
this Principle indicates the eternality of the scientific order and
continuity of being.

Scientific basis

Christian Science differs from material science, but not on that account
is it less scientific. On the contrary, Christian Science is pre-emi

<span id="pg_124">p. 124</span>

mently scientific, being based on Truth, the Principle of all science.

Physical science a blind belief

Physical science (so-called) is human knowledge,--a law of mortal mind,
a blind belief, a Samson shorn of his strength. When this human belief
lacks organizations to support it, its foundations are gone. Having
neither moral might, spiritual basis, nor holy Principle of its own,
this belief mistakes effect for cause and seeks to find life and
intelligence in matter, thus limiting Life and holding fast to discord
and death. In a word, human belief is a blind conclusion from material
reasoning. This is a mortal, finite sense of things, which immortal
Spirit silences forever.

Right interpretation

The universe, like man, is to be interpreted by Science from its divine
Principle, God, and then it can be understood; but when explained on the
basis of physical sense and represented as subject to growth, maturity,
and decay, the universe, like man, is, and must continue to be, an
enigma.

All force mental

Adhesion, cohesion, and attraction are properties of Mind. They belong
to divine Principle, and support the equipoise of that thought-force,
which launched the earth in its orbit and said to the proud wave, "Thus
far and no farther."

Spirit is the life, substance, and continuity of all things. We tread on
forces. Withdraw them, and creation must collapse. Human knowledge calls
them forces of matter; but divine Science declares that they belong
wholly to divine Mind, are inherent in this Mind, and so restores them
to their rightful home and classification.

Corporeal changes

The elements and functions of the physical body and

<span id="pg_125">p. 125</span>

of the physical world will change as mortal mind changes its beliefs.
What is now considered the best condition for organic and functional
health in the human body may no longer be found indispensable to health.
Moral conditions will be found always harmonious and health-giving.
Neither organic inaction nor overaction is beyond God's control; and man
will be found normal and natural to changed mortal thought, and
therefore more harmonious in his manifestations than he was in the prior
states which human belief created and sanctioned.

As human thought changes from one stage to another of conscious pain and
painlessness, sorrow and joy, - from fear to hope and from faith to
understanding, - the visible manifestation will at last be man governed
by Soul, not by material sense. Reflecting God's government, man is
self-governed. When subordinate to the divine Spirit, man cannot be
controlled by sin or death, thus proving our material theories about
laws of health to be valueless.

The time and tide

The seasons will come and go with changes of time and tide, cold and
heat, latitude and longitude. The agriculturist will find that these
changes cannot affect his crops. "As a vesture shalt Thou change them
and they shall be changed." The mariner will have dominion over the
atmosphere and the great deep, over the fish of the sea and the fowls of
the air. The astronomer will no longer look up to the stars, he will
look out from them upon the universe; and the florist will find his
flower before its seed.

Mortal nothingness

Thus matter will finally be proved nothing more than a mortal belief,
wholly inadequate to affect a man

<span id="pg_126">p. 126</span>

through its supposed organic action or supposed existence. Error will be
no longer used in stating truth. The problem of nothingness, or "dust to
dust," will be solved, and mortal mind will be without form and void,
for mortality will cease when man beholds himself God's reflection, even
as man sees his reflection in a glass.

A lack of originality

All Science is divine. Human thought never projected the least portion
of true being. Human belief has sought and interpreted in its own way
the echo of Spirit, and so seems to have reversed it and repeated it
materially; but the human mind never produced a real tone nor sent forth
a positive sound.

Antagonistic questions

The point at issue between Christian Science on the one hand and popular
theology on the other is this: Shall Science explain cause and effect as
being both natural and spiritual? Or shall all that is beyond the
cognizance of the material senses be called supernatural, and be left to
the mercy of speculative hypotheses?

Biblical basis

I have set forth Christian Science and its application to the treatment
of disease just as I have discovered them. I have demonstrated through
Mind the effects of Truth on the health, longevity, and morals of men;
and I have found nothing in ancient or in modern systems on which to
found my own, except the teachings and demonstrations of our great
Master and the lives of prophets and apostles. The Bible has been my
only authority. I have had no other guide in "the straight and narrow
way" of Truth.

Science and Christianity

If Christendom resists the author's application of the

<span id="pg_127">p. 127</span>

word Science to Christianity, or questions her use of the word Science,
she will not therefore lose faith in Christianity, nor will Christianity
lose its hold upon her. If God, the All-in-all, be the creator of the
spiritual universe, including man, then everything entitled to a
classification as truth, or Science, must be comprised in a knowledge or
understanding of God, for there can be nothing beyond illimitable
divinity.

Scientific terms

The terms Divine Science, Spiritual Science, Christ Science or Christian
Science, or Science alone, she employs interchangeably, according to the
requirements of the context. These synonymous terms stand for everything
relating to God, the infinite, supreme, eternal Mind. It may be said,
however, that the term Christian Science relates especially to Science
as applied to humanity. Christian Science reveals God, not as the author
of sin, sickness, and death, but as divine Principle, Supreme Being,
Mind, exempt from all evil. It teaches that matter is the falsity, not
the fact, of existence; that nerves, brain, stomach, lungs, and so
forth, have--as matter--no intelligence, life, nor sensation.

No physical science

There is no physical science, inasmuch as all truth proceeds from the
divine Mind. Therefore truth is not human, and is not a law of matter,
for matter is not a lawgiver. Science is an emanation of divine Mind,
and is alone able to interpret God aright. It has a spiritual, and not a
material origin. It is a divine utterance,--the Comforter which leadeth
into all truth.

Christian Science eschews what is called natural science, in so far as
this is built on the false hypotheses that matter is its own lawgiver,
that law is founded on material con

<span id="pg_128">p. 128</span>

ditions, and that these are final and overrule the might of divine Mind.
Good is natural and primitive. It is not miraculous to itself.

Practical Science

The term Science, properly understood, refers only to the laws of God
and to His government of the universe, inclusive of man. From this it
follows that business men and cultured scholars have found that
Christian Science enhances their endurance and mental powers, enlarges
their perception of character, gives them acuteness and
comprehensiveness and an ability to exceed their ordinary capacity. The
human mind, imbued with this spiritual understanding, becomes more
elastic, is capable of greater endurance, escapes somewhat from itself,
and requires less repose. A knowledge of the Science of being develops
the latent abilities and possibilities of man. It extends the atmosphere
of thought, giving mortals access to broader and higher realms. It
raises the thinker into his native air of insight and perspicacity.

An odor becomes beneficent and agreeable only in proportion to its
escape into the surrounding atmosphere. So it is with our knowledge of
Truth. If one would not quarrel with his fellow-man for waking him from
a cataleptic nightmare, he should not resist Truth, which banishes -
yea, forever destroys with the higher testimony of Spirit--the so-called
evidence of matter.

Mathematics and scientific logic

Science relates to Mind, not matter. It rests on fixed Principle and not
upon the judgment of false sensation. The addition of two sums in
mathematics must always bring the same result. So is it with logic. If
both the major and the minor propositions of a syllogism are correct,
the conclusion, if properly

<span id="pg_129">p. 129</span>

drawn, cannot be false. So in Christian Science there are no discords
nor contradictions, because its logic is as harmonious as the reasoning
of an accurately stated syllogism or of a properly computed sum in
arithmetic. Truth is ever truthful, and can tolerate no error in premise
or conclusion.

Truth by inversion

If you wish to know the spiritual fact, you can discover it by reversing
the material fable, be the fable pro or con,--be it in accord with your
preconceptions or utterly contrary to them.

Antagonistic theories

Pantheism may be defined as a belief in the intelligence of matter,--a
belief which Science overthrows. In those days there will be "great
tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world;" and earth
will echo the cry, "Art thou \[Truth\] come hither to torment us before
the time?" Animal magnetism, hypnotism, spiritualism, theosophy,
agnosticism, pantheism, and infidelity are antagonistic to true being
and fatal to its demonstration; and so are some other systems.

Ontology needed

We must abandon pharmaceutics, and take up ontology,--"the science of
real being." We must look deep into realism instead of accepting only
the outward sense of things. Can we gather peaches from a pine-tree, or
learn from discord the concord of being? Yet quite as rational are some
of the leading illusions along the path which Science must tread in its
reformatory mission among mortals. The very name, illusion, points to
nothingness.

Reluctant guests

The generous liver may object to the author's small estimate of the
pleasures of the table. The sinner sees, in the system taught in this
book, that the demands of

<span id="pg_130">p. 130</span>

God must be met. The petty intellect is alarmed by constant appeals to
Mind. The licentious disposition is discouraged over its slight
spiritual prospects. When all men are bidden to the feast, the excuses
come. One has a farm, another has merchandise, and therefore they cannot
accept.

Excuses for ignorance

It is vain to speak dishonestly of divine Science, which destroys all
discord, when you can demonstrate the actuality of Science. It is unwise
to doubt if reality is in perfect harmony with God, divine Principle, -
if Science, when understood and demonstrated, will destroy all discord,
- since you admit that God is omnipotent; for from this premise it
follows that good and its sweet concords have all-power.

Children and adults

Christian Science, properly understood, would disabuse the human mind of
material beliefs which war against spiritual facts; and these material
beliefs must be denied and cast out to make place for truth. You cannot
add to the contents of a vessel already full. Laboring long to shake the
adult's faith in matter and to inculcate a grain of faith in God, an
inkling of the ability of Spirit to make the body harmonious,--the
author has often remembered our Master's love for little children, and
understood how truly such as they belong to the heavenly kingdom.

All evil unnatural

If thought is startled at the strong claim of Science for the supremacy
of God, or Truth, and doubts the supremacy of good, ought we not,
contrariwise, to be astounded at the vigorous claims of evil and doubt
them, and no longer think it natural to love sin and unnatural to
forsake it,--no longer imagine evil to be ever-present and good absent?
Truth should

<span id="pg_131">p. 131</span>

not seem so surprising and unnatural as error, and error should not seem
so real as truth. Sickness should not seem so real as health. There is
no error in Science, and our lives must be governed by reality in order
to be in harmony with God, the divine Principle of all being.

The error of carnality

When once destroyed by divine Science, the false evidence before the
corporeal senses disappears. Hence the opposition of sensuous man to the
Science of Soul and the significance of the Scripture, "The carnal mind
is enmity against God." The central fact of the Bible is the superiority
of spiritual over physical power.

THEOLOGY

Churchly neglect

Must Christian Science come through the Christian churches as some
persons insist? This Science has come already, after the manner of God's
appointing, but the churches seem not ready to receive it, according to
the Scriptural saying, "He came unto his own, and his own received him
not." Jesus once said: "I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and
hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father, for so it seemed good in
Thy sight." As aforetime, the spirit of the Christ, which taketh away
the ceremonies and doctrines of men, is not accepted until the hearts of
men are made ready for it.

John the Baptist, and the Messiah

The mission of Jesus confirmed prophecy, and explained the so-called
miracles of olden time as natural demonstrations of the divine power,
demonstra- , tions which were not understood. Jesus' works established
his claim to the Messiahship. In reply to John's inquiry, "Art thou he
that should come,"

<span id="pg_132">p. 132</span>

Jesus returned an affirmative reply, recounting his works instead of
referring to his doctrine, confident that this exhibition of the divine
power to heal would fully answer the question. Hence his reply: "Go and
show John again those things which ye do hear and see: the blind receive
their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf
hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to
them. And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me." In
other words, he gave his benediction to any one who should not deny that
such effects, coming from divine Mind, prove the unity of God,--the
divine principle which brings out all harmony.

Christ rejected

The Pharisees of old thrust the spiritual idea and the man who lived it
out of their synagogues, and retained their materialistic beliefs about
God. Jesus' system of healing received no aid nor approval from other
sanitary or religious systems, from doctrines of physics or of divinity;
and it has not yet been generally accepted. To-day, as of yore,
unconscious of the reappearing of the spiritual idea, blind belief shuts
the door upon it, and condemns the cure of the sick and sinning if it is
wrought on any but a material and a doctrinal theory. Anticipating this
rejection of idealism, of the true idea of God, - this salvation from
all error, physical and mental,--Jesus asked, "When the Son of man
cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?"

John's misgivings

Did the doctrines of John the Baptist confer healing power upon him, or
endow him with the truest conception of the Christ? This righteous
preacher once pointed his disciples to Jesus as "the Lamb of God;" yet
afterwards he seriously questioned

<span id="pg_133">p. 133</span>

the signs of the Messianic appearing, and sent the inquiry to Jesus,
"Art thou he that should come?"

Faith according to works

Was John's faith greater than that of the Samaritan woman, who said, "Is
not this the Christ?" There was also a certain centurion of whose faith
Jesus himself declared, "I have not found so great faith, no, not in
Israel."

In Egypt, it was Mind which saved the Israelites from belief in the
plagues. In the wilderness, streams flowed from the rock, and manna fell
from the sky. The Israelites looked upon the brazen serpent, and
straightway believed that they were healed of the poisonous stings of
vipers. In national prosperity, miracles attended the successes of the
Hebrews; but when they departed from the true idea, their demoralization
began. Even in captivity among foreign nations, the divine Principle
wrought wonders for the people of God in the fiery furnace and in kings'
palaces.

Judaism antipathetic

Judaism was the antithesis of Christianity, because Judaism engendered
the limited form of a national or tribal religion. It was a finite and
material system, carried out in special theories concerning God, man,
sanitary methods, and a religious cultus. That he made "himself equal
with God," was one of the Jewish accusations against him who planted
Christianity on the foundation of Spirit, who taught as he was inspired
by the Father and would recognize no life, intelligence, nor substance
outside of God.

Priestly learning

The Jewish conception of God, as Yawah, Jehovah, or only a mighty hero
and king, has not quite given place to the true knowledge of God. Creeds
and rituals have not cleansed their hands of

<span id="pg_134">p. 134</span>

rabbinical lore. To-day the cry of bygone ages is repeated, "Crucify
him!" At every advancing step, truth is still opposed with sword and
spear.

Testimony of martyrs

The word martyr, from the Greek, means witness; but those who testified
for Truth were so often persecuted unto death, that at length the word
martyr was narrowed in its significance and so has come always to mean
one who suffers for his convictions. The new faith in the Christ, Truth,
so roused the hatred of the opponents of Christianity, that the
followers of Christ were burned, crucified, and otherwise persecuted;
and so it came about that human rights were hallowed by the gallows and
the cross.

Absence of Christ-power

Man-made doctrines are waning. They have not waxed strong in times of
trouble. Devoid of the Christ-power, how can they illustrate the
doctrines of Christ or the miracles of grace? Denial of the possibility
of Christian healing robs Christianity of the very element, which gave
it divine force and its astonishing and unequalled success in the first
century.

Basis of miracles

The true Logos is demonstrably Christian Science, the natural law of
harmony which overcomes discord,--not because this Science is
supernatural or preternatural, nor because it is an infraction of divine
law, but because it is the immutable law of God, good. Jesus said: "I
knew that Thou hearest me always;" and he raised Lazarus from the dead,
stilled the tempest, healed the sick, walked on the water. There is
divine authority for believing in the superiority of spiritual power
over material resistance.

Lawful wonders

A miracle fulfils God's law, but does not violate that law. This fact at
present seems more mysterious than

<span id="pg_135">p. 135</span>

the miracle itself. The Psalmist sang: "What ailed thee, O thou sea,
that thou fleddest? Thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? Ye
mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye little hills, like lambs?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the
God of Jacob." The miracle introduces no disorder, but unfolds the
primal order, establishing the Science of God's unchangeable law.
Spiritual evolution alone is worthy of the exercise of divine power.

Fear and sickness identical

The same power which heals sin heals also sickness. This is "the beauty
of holiness," that when Truth heals the sick it casts out evils, and
when Truth casts out the evil called disease, it heals the sick. When
Christ cast out the devil of dumbness, "it came to pass, when the devil
was gone out, the dumb spake." There is to-day danger of repeating the
offence of the Jews by limiting the Holy One of Israel and asking: "Can
God furnish a table in the wilderness?" What cannot God do?

The unity of Science and Christianity

It has been said, and truly, that Christianity must be Science, and
Science must be Christianity, else one or the other is false and
useless; but neither is unimportant or untrue, and they are alike in
demonstration. This proves the one to be identical with the other.
Christianity as Jesus taught it was not a creed, nor a system of
ceremonies, nor a special gift from a ritualistic Jehovah; but it was
the demonstration of divine Love casting out error and healing the sick,
not merely in the name of Christ, or Truth, but in demonstration of
Truth, as must be the case in the cycles of divine light.

<span id="pg_136">p. 136</span>

The Christ-mission

Jesus established his church and maintained his mission on a spiritual
foundation of Christ-healing. He taught his followers that his religion
had a divine Principle, which would cast out error and heal both the
sick and the sinning. He claimed no intelligence, action, nor life
separate from God. Despite the persecution this brought upon him, he
used his divine power to save men both bodily and spiritually.

Ancient spiritualism

The question then as now was, How did Jesus heal the sick? His answer to
this question the world rejected. He appealed to his students: "Whom do
men say that I, the Son of man, am?" That is: Who or what is it that is
thus identified with casting out evils and healing the sick? They
replied, "Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias; and
others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets." These prophets were
considered dead, and this reply may indicate that some of the people
believed that Jesus was a medium, controlled by the spirit of John or of
Elias.

This ghostly fancy was repeated by Herod himself. That a wicked king and
debauched husband should have no high appreciation of divine Science and
the great work of the Master, was not surprising; for how could such a
sinner comprehend what the disciples did not fully understand? But even
Herod doubted if Jesus was controlled by the sainted preacher. Hence
Herod's assertion: "John have I beheaded: but who is this?" No wonder
Herod desired to see the new Teacher.

Doubting disciples

The disciples apprehended their Master better than did others; but they
did not comprehend all that he said and did, or they would not have
questioned him so often. Jesus patiently persisted in

<span id="pg_137">p. 137</span>

teaching and demonstrating the truth of being. His students saw this
power of Truth heal the sick, cast out evil, raise the dead; but the
ultimate of this wonderful work was not spiritually discerned, even by
them, until after the crucifixion, when their immaculate Teacher stood
before them, the victor over sickness, sin, disease, death, and the
grave.

Yearning to be understood, the Master repeated, "But whom say ye that I
am?" This renewed inquiry meant: Who or what is it that is able to do
the work, so mysterious to the popular mind? In his rejection of the
answer already given and his renewal of the question, it is plain that
Jesus completely eschewed the narrow opinion implied in their citation
of the common report about him.

A divine response

With his usual impetuosity, Simon replied for his brethren, and his
reply set forth a great fact: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
living God!" That is: The Messiah is what thou hast declared,--Christ,
the spirit of God, of Truth, Life, and Love, which heals mentally. This
assertion elicited from Jesus the benediction, "Blessed art thou, Simon
Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my
Father which is in heaven;" that is, Love hath shown thee the way of
Life!

The true and living rock

Before this the impetuous disciple had been called only by his common
names, Simon Bar-jona, or son of Jona; but now the Master gave him a
spiritual name in these words: "And I say also unto thee, That thou art
Peter; and upon this rock \[the meaning of the Greek word petros, or
stone\] I will build my church; and the gates of hell \[hades, the under

<span id="pg_138">p. 138</span>

world, or the grave\] shall not prevail against it." In other words,
Jesus purposed founding his society, not on the personal Peter as a
mortal, but on the Godpower which lay behind Peter's confession of the
true Messiah.

Sublime summary

It was now evident to Peter that divine Life, Truth, and Love, and not a
human personality, was the healer of the sick and a rock, a firm
foundation in the realm of harmony. On this spiritually scientific basis
Jesus explained his cures, which appeared miraculous to outsiders. He
showed that diseases were cast out neither by corporeality, by materia
medica, nor by hygiene, but by the divine Spirit, casting out the errors
of mortal mind. The supremacy of Spirit was the foundation on which
Jesus built. His sublime summary points to the religion of Love.

New era in Jesus

Jesus established in the Christian era the precedent for all
Christianity, theology, and healing. Christians are under as direct
orders now, as they were then, to be Christlike, to possess the
Christ-spirit, to follow the Christ-example, and to heal the sick as
well as the sinning. It is easier for Christianity to cast out sickness
than sin, for the sick are more willing to part with pain than are
sinners to give up the sinful, so-called pleasure of the senses. The
Christian can prove this to-day as readily is it was proved centuries
ago.

Healthful theology

Our Master said to every follower: "Go ye into all the world, and preach
the gospel to every creature! . . . Heal the sick! . . . Love thy
neighbor as thyself!" It was this theology of Jesus which healed the
sick and the sinning. It is his theology in this book and the spiritual
meaning of this theology, which

<span id="pg_139">p. 139</span>

heals the sick and causes the wicked to "forsake his way, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts." It was our Master's theology which the
impious sought to destroy.

Marvels and reformations

From beginning to end, the Scriptures are full of accounts of the
triumph of Spirit, Mind, over matter. Moses proved the power of Mind by
what men called miracles ; so did Joshua, Elijah, and Elisha. The
Christian era was ushered in with signs and wonders. Reforms have
commonly been attended with bloodshed and persecution, even when the end
has been brightness and peace; but the present new, yet old, reform in
religious faith will teach men patiently and wisely to stem the tide of
sectarian bitterness, whenever it flows inward.

Science obscured

The decisions by vote of Church Councils as to what should and should
not be considered Holy Writ; the manifest mistakes in the ancient
versions; the thirty thousand different readings in the Old Testament,
and the three hundred thousand in the New, - these facts show how a
mortal and material sense stole into the divine record, with its own hue
darkening to some extent the inspired pages. But mistakes could neither
wholly obscure the divine Science of the Scriptures seen from Genesis to
Revelation, mar the demonstration of Jesus, nor annul the healing by the
prophets, who foresaw that "the stone which the builders rejected" would
become "the head of the corner."

Opponents benefited

Atheism, pantheism, theosophy, and agnosticism are opposed to Christian
Science, as they are to ordinary religion; but it does not follow that
the profane or atheistic invalid cannot be healed by Christian Science.
The moral condition of such a man de

<span id="pg_140">p. 140</span>

mands the remedy of Truth more than it is needed in most cases; and
Science is more than usually effectual in the treatment of moral
ailments.

God invisible to the senses

That God is a corporeal being, nobody can truly affirm. The Bible
represents Him as saying: "Thou canst not see My face; for there shall
no man see Me and live." Not materially but spiritually we know Him as
divine Mind, as Life, Truth, and Love. We shall obey and adore in
proportion as we apprehend the divine nature and love Him
understandingly, warring no more over the corporeality, but rejoicing in
the affluence of our God. Religion will then be of the heart and not of
the head. Mankind will no longer be tyrannical and proscriptive from
lack of love,--straining out gnats and swallowing camels.

The true worship

We worship spiritually, only as we cease to worship materially.
Spiritual devoutness is the soul of Christianity. Worshipping through
the medium of matter is paganism. Judaic and other rituals are but types
and shadows of true worship. "The true worshippers shall worship the
Father in spirit and in truth."

Anthropomorphism

The Jewish tribal Jehovah was a man-projected God, liable to wrath,
repentance, and human changeableness. The Christian Science God is
universal, eternal, divine love, which changeth not and causeth no evil,
disease, nor death. It is indeed mournfully true that the older
Scripture is reversed. In the begining God created man in His, God's,
image; but mortals would procreate man, and make God in their own human
image. What is the god of a mortal, but a mortal magnified?

<span id="pg_141">p. 141</span>

More than profession required

This indicates the distance between the theological and ritualistic
religion of the ages and the truth preached by Jesus. More than
profession is requisite for Christian demonstration. Few understand or
adhere to Jesus' divine precepts for living and healing. Why? Because
his precepts require the disciple to cut off the right hand and pluck
out the right eye, - that is, to set aside even the most cherished
beliefs and practices, to leave all for Christ.

No ecclesiastical monopoly

All revelation (such is the popular thought!) must come from the schools
and along the line of scholarly and ecclesiastical descent, as kings are
crowned from a royal dynasty. In healing the sick and sinning, Jesus
elaborated the fact that the healing effect followed the understanding
of the divine Principle and of the Christ-spirit which governed the
corporeal Jesus. For this Principle there is no dynasty, no
ecclesiastical monopoly. Its only crowned head is immortal sovereignty.
Its only priest is the spiritualized man. The Bible declares that all
believers are made "kings and priests unto God." The outsiders did not
then, and do not now, understand this ruling of the Christ; therefore
they cannot demonstrate God's healing power. Neither can this
manifestation of Christ be comprehended, until its divine Principle is
scientifically understood.

A change demanded

The adoption of scientific religion and of divine healing will
ameliorate sin, sickness, and death. Let our pulpits do justice to
Christian Science. Let it have fair representation by the press. Give to
it the place in our institutions of learning now occupied by scholastic
theology and physiology, and it will

<span id="pg_142">p. 142</span>

eradicate sickness and sin in less time than the old systems, devised
for subduing them, have required for self-establishment and propagation.

Two claims omitted

Anciently the followers of Christ, or Truth, measured Christianity by
its power over sickness, sin, and death; but modern religions generally
omit all but one of these powers,--the power over sin. We must seek the
undivided garment, the whole Christ, as our first proof of Christianity,
for Christ, Truth, alone can furnish us with absolute evidence.

Selfishness and loss

If the soft palm, upturned to a lordly salary, and architectural skill,
making dome and spire tremulous with beauty, turn the poor and the
stranger from the gate, they at the same time shut the door on progress.
In vain do the manger and the cross tell their story to pride and
fustian. Sensuality palsies the right hand, and causes the left to let
go its grasp on the divine.

Temple cleansed

As in Jesus' time, so to-day, tyranny and pride need to be whipped out
of the temple, and humility and divine Science to be welcomed in. The
strong cords of scientific demonstration, as twisted and wielded by
Jesus, are still needed to purge the temples of their vain traffic in
worldly worship and to make them meet dwelling-places for the Most High.

MEDICINE

Question of precedence

Which was first, Mind or medicine? If Mind was first and self-existent,
then Mind, not matter, must have been the first medicine. God being
All-inall, He made medicine; but that medicine was Mind. It could not
have been matter, which departs from the nature and character of Mind,
God. Truth

<span id="pg_143">p. 143</span>

is God's remedy for error of every kind, and Truth destroys only what is
untrue. Hence the fact that, to-day, as yesterday, Christ casts out
evils and heals the sick.

Methods rejected

It is plain that God does not employ drugs or hygiene, nor provide them
for human use; else Jesus would have recommended and employed them in
his healing. The sick are more deplorably lost than the sinning, if the
sick cannot rely on God for help and the sinning can. The divine Mind
never called matter medicine, and matter required a material and human
belief before it could be considered as medicine.

Error not curative

Sometimes the human mind uses one error to medicine another. Driven to
choose between two difficulties, the human mind takes the lesser to
relieve the greater. On this basis it saves from starvation by theft,
and quiets pain with anodynes. You admit that mind influences the body
somewhat, but you conclude that the stomach, blood, nerves, bones, etc.,
hold the preponderance of power. Controlled by this belief, you continue
in the old routine. You lean on the inert and unintelligent, never
discerning how this deprives you of the available superiority of divine
Mind. The body is not controlled scientifically by a negative mind.

Impossible coalescence

Mind is the grand creator, and there can be no power except that which
is derived from Mind. If Mind was first chronologically, is first
potentially, and must be first eternally, then give to Mind the glory,
honor, dominion, and power everlastingly due its holy name. Inferior and
unspiritual methods of healing may try to make Mind and drugs coalesce,
but the two will

<span id="pg_144">p. 144</span>

not mingle scientifically. Why should we wish to make them do so, since
no good can come of it?

If Mind is foremost and superior, let us rely upon Mind, which needs no
cooperation from lower powers, even if these so-called powers are real.

   Naught is the squire, when the king is nigh;    Withdraws the star,
when dawns the sun's brave light.

Soul and sense

The various mortal beliefs formulated in human philosophy, physiology,
hygiene, are mainly predicated of matter, and afford faint gleams of
God, or Truth. The more material a belief, the more obstinately
tenacious its error; the stronger are the manifestations of the
corporeal senses, the weaker the indications of Soul.

Will-power detrimental

Human will-power is not Science. Human will belongs to the so-called
material senses, and its use is to be condemned. Willing the sick to
recover is not the metaphysical practice of Christian Science, but is
sheer animal magnetism. Human will-power may infringe the rights of man.
It produces evil continually, and is not a factor in the realism of
being. Truth, and not corporeal will, is the divine power which says to
disease, "Peace, be still."

Conservative antagonism

Because divine Science wars with so-called physical science, even as
Truth wars with error, the old schools still oppose it. Ignorance,
pride, or prejudice closes the door to whatever is not stereotyped. When
the Science of being is universally understood, every man will be his
own physician, and Truth will be the universal panacea.

Ancient healers

It is a question to-day, whether the ancient inspired healers understood
the Science of Christian healing, or

<span id="pg_145">p. 145</span>

whether they caught its sweet tones, as the natural musician catches the
tones of harmony, without being able to explain them. So divinely imbued
were they with the spirit of Science, that the lack of the letter could
not hinder their work; and that letter, without the spirit, would have
made void their practice.

The struggle and victory

The struggle for the recovery of invalids goes on, not between material
methods, but between mortal minds and immortal Mind. The victory will be
on the patient's side only as immortal Mind through Christ, Truth,
subdues the human belief in disease. It matters not what material method
one may adopt, whether faith in drugs, trust in hygiene, or reliance on
some other minor curative.

Mystery of godliness

Scientific healing has this advantage over other methods,--that in it
Truth controls error. From this fact arise its ethical as well as its
physical effects. Indeed, its ethical and physical effects are
indissolubly connected. If there is any mystery in Christian healing, it
is the mystery which godliness always presents to the ungodly,--the
mystery always arising from ignorance of the laws of eternal and
unerring Mind.

Matter versus matter

Other methods undertake to oppose error with error, and thus they
increase the antagonism of one form of matter towards other forms of
matter or error, and the warfare between Spirit and the flesh goes on.
By this antagonism mortal mind must continually weaken its own assumed
power.

How healing was lost

The theology of Christian Science includes healing the sick. Our
Master's first article of faith propounded

<span id="pg_146">p. 146</span>

to his students was healing, and he proved his faith by his works. The
ancient Christians were healers. Why has this element of Christianity
been lost? Because our systems of religion are governed more or less by
our systems of medicine. The first idolatry was faith in matter. The
schools have rendered faith in drugs the fashion, rather than faith in
Deity. By trusting matter to destroy its own discord, health and harmony
have been sacrificed. Such systems are barren of the vitality of
spiritual power, by which material sense is made the servant of Science
and religion becomes Christlike.

Drugs and divinity

Material medicine substitutes drugs for the power of God--even the might
of Mind--to heal the body. Scholasticism clings for salvation to the
person, instead of to the divine Principle, of the man Jesus; and his
Science, the curative agent of God, is silenced. Why? Because truth
divests material drugs of their imaginary power, and clothes Spirit with
supremacy. Science is the "stranger that is within thy gates,"
remembered not, even when its elevating effects practically prove its
divine origin and efficacy.

Christian Science as old as God

Divine Science derives its sanction from the Bible, and the divine
origin of Science is demonstrated through the holy influence of Truth in
healing sickness and sin. This healing power of Truth must have been far
anterior to the period in which Jesus lived. It is as ancient as "the
Ancient of days." It lives through all Life, and extends throughout all
space.

Reduction to system

Divine metaphysics is now reduced to a system, to a form comprehensible
by and adapted to the thought of

<span id="pg_147">p. 147</span>

the age in which we live. This system enables the learner to demonstrate
the divine Principle, upon which Jesus' healing was based, and the
sacred rules for its present application to the cure of disease.

Late in the nineteenth century I demonstrated the divine rules of
Christian Science. They were submitted to the broadest practical test,
and everywhere, when honestly applied under circumstances where
demonstration was humanly possible, this Science showed that Truth had
lost none of its divine and healing efficacy, even though centuries had
passed away since Jesus practised these rules on the hills of Judaea and
in the valleys of Galilee.

Perusal and practice

Although this volume contains the complete Science of Mind-healing,
never believe that you can absorb the whole meaning of the Science by a
simple perusal of this book. The book needs to be studied, and the
demonstration of the rules of scientific healing will plant you firmly
on the spiritual groundwork of Christian Science. This proof lifts you
high above the perishing fossils of theories already antiquated, and
enables you to grasp the spiritual facts of being hitherto unattained
and seemingly dim.

A definite rule discovered

Our Master healed the sick, practised Christian healing, and taught the
generalities of its divine Principle to his students; but he left no
definite rule for demonstrating this Principle of healing and preventing
disease. This rule remained to be discovered in Christian Science. A
pure affection takes form in goodness, but Science alone reveals the
divine Principle of goodness and demonstrates its rules.

Jesus' own practice

Jesus never spoke of disease as dangerous or as difficult

<span id="pg_148">p. 148</span>

to heal. When his students brought to him a case they had failed to
heal, he said to them, "O faithless generation," implying that the
requisite power to heal was in Mind. He prescribed no drugs, urged no
obedience to material laws, but acted in direct disobedience to them.

The man of anatomy and of theology

Neither anatomy nor theology has ever described man as created by
Spirit, - as God's man. The former explains the men of men, or the
"children of men," as created corporeally instead of spiritually and as
emerging from the lowest, instead of from the highest, conception of
being. Both anatomy and theology define man as both physical and mental,
and place mind at the mercy of matter for every function, formation, and
manifestation. Anatomy takes up man at all points materially. It loses
Spirit, drops the true tone, and accepts the discord. Anatomy and
theology reject the divine Principle which produces harmonious man, and
deal--the one wholly, the other primarily - with matter, calling that
man which is not the counterpart, but the counterfeit, of God's man.
Then theology tries to explain how to make this man a Christian,--how
from this basis of division and discord to produce the concord and unity
of Spirit and His likeness.

Physiology deficient

Physiology exalts matter, dethrones Mind, and claims to rule man by
material law, instead of spiritual. When physiology fails to give health
or life by this process, it ignores the divine Spirit as unable or
unwilling to render help in time of physical need. When mortals sin,
this ruling of the schools leaves them to the guidance of a theology
which admits God to be the healer of sin but not of sickness, although
our great

<span id="pg_149">p. 149</span>

Master demonstrated that Truth could save from sickness as well as from
sin.

Blunders and blunderers

Mind as far outweighs drugs in the cure of disease as in the cure of
sin. The more excellent way is divine Science in every case. Is materia
medica a science or a bundle of speculative human theories? The
prescription which succeeds in one instance fails in another, and this
is owing to the different mental states of the patient. These states are
not comprehended and they are left without explanation except in
Christian Science. The rule and its perfection of operation never vary
in Science. If you fail to succeed in any case, it is because you have
not demonstrated the life of Christ, Truth, more in your own
life,--because you have not obeyed the rule and proved the Principle of
divine Science.

Old-school physician

A physician of the old school remarked with great gravity: "We know that
mind affects the body somewhat, and advise our patients to be hopeful
and cheerful and to take as little medicine as possible; but mind can
never cure organic difficulties." The logic is lame, and facts
contradict it. The author has cured what is termed organic disease as
readily as she has cured purely functional disease, and with no power
but the divine Mind.

Tests in our day

Since God, divine Mind, governs all, not partially but supremely,
predicting disease does not dignify therapeutics. Whatever guides
thought spiritually benefits mind and body. We need to understand the
affirmations of divine Science, dismiss superstition, and demonstrate
truth according to Christ. To-day there is hardly a city, village, or
hamlet, in which are not to

<span id="pg_150">p. 150</span>

be found living witnesses and monuments to the virtue and power of
Truth, as applied through this Christian system of healing disease.

The main purpose

To-day the healing power of Truth is widely demonstrated as an immanent,
eternal Science, instead of a phenomenal exhibition. Its appearing is
the coming anew of the gospel of "on earth peace, good-will toward men."
This coming, as was promised by the Master, is for its establishment as
a permanent dispensation among men; but the mission of Christian Science
now, as in the time of its earlier demonstration, is not primarily one
of physical healing. Now, as then, signs and wonders are wrought in the
metaphysical healing of physical disease; but these signs are only to
demonstrate its divine origin,--to attest the reality of the higher
mission of the Christ-power to take away the sins of the world.

Exploded doctrine

The science (so-called) of physics would have one believe that both
matter and mind are subject to disease, and that, too, in spite of the
individual's protest and contrary to the law of divine Mind. This human
view infringes man's free moral agency; and it is as evidently erroneous
to the author, and will be to all others at some future day, as the
practically rejected doctrine of the predestination of souls to
damnation or salvation. The doctrine that man's harmony is governed by
physical conditions all his earthly days, and that he is then thrust out
of his own body by the operation of matter,--even the doctrine of the
superiority of matter over Mind,--is fading out.

Disease mental

The hosts of AEsculapius are flooding the world with diseases, because
they are ignorant that the human mind

<span id="pg_151">p. 151</span>

and body are myths. To be sure, they sometimes treat the sick as if
there was but one factor in the case; but this one factor they represent
to be body, not mind. Infinite Mind could not possibly create a remedy
outside of itself, but erring, finite, human mind has an absolute need
of something beyond itself for its redemption and healing.

Intentions respected

Great respect is due the motives and philanthropy of the higher class of
physicians. We know that if they understood the Science of Mind-healing,
and were in possession of the enlarged power it confers to benefit the
race physically and spiritually, they would rejoice with us. Even this
one reform in medicine would ultimately deliver mankind from the awful
and oppressive bondage now enforced by false theories, from which
multitudes would gladly escape.

Man governed by Mind

Mortal belief says that death has been occasioned by fright. Fear never
stopped being and its action. The blood, heart, lungs, brain, etc., have
nothing to do with Life, God. Every function of the real man is governed
by the divine Mind. The human mind has no power to kill or to cure, and
it has no comtrol over God's man. The divine Mind that made man
maintains His own image and likeness. The human mind is opposed to God
and must be put off, as St. Paul declares. All that really exists is the
divine Mind and its idea, and in this Mind the entire being is found
harmonious and eternal. The straight and narrow way is to see and
acknowledge this fact, yield to this power, and follow the leadings of
truth.

Mortal mind dethroned

That mortal mind claims to govern every organ of the mortal body, we
have overwhelming proof. But this so

<span id="pg_152">p. 152</span>

called mind is a myth, and must by its own consent yield to Truth. It
would wield the sceptre of a monarch, but it is powerless. The immortal
divine Mind takes away all its supposed sovereignty, and saves mortal
mind from itself. The author has endeavored to make this book the
AEsculapius of mind as well as of body, that it may give hope to the
sick and heal them, although they know not how the work is done. Truth
has a healing effect, even when not fully understood.

All activity from thought

Anatomy describes muscular action as produced by mind in one instance
and not in another. Such errors beset every material theory, in which
one statement contradicts another over and over again. It is related
that Sir Humphry Davy once apparently cured a case of paralysis simply
by introducing a thermometer into the patient's mouth. This he did
merely to ascertain the temperature of the patient's body; but the sick
man supposed this ceremony was intended to heal him, and he recovered
accordingly. Such a fact illustrates our theories.

The author's experiments in medicine

The author's medical researches and experiments had prepared her thought
for the metaphysics of Christian Science. Every material dependence had
failed her in her search for truth; and she can now understand why, and
can see the means by which mortals are divinely driven to a spiritual
source for health and happiness.

Homoeopathic attenuations

Her experiments in homoeopathy had made her skeptical as to material
curative methods. Jahr, from Aconitum to Zincum oxydatum, enumerates the
general symptoms, the characteristic signs, which demand different
remedies; but the drug

<span id="pg_153">p. 153</span>

is frequently attenuated to such a degree that not a vestige of it
remains. Thus we learn that it is not the drug which expels the disease
or changes one of the symptoms of disease.

Only salt and water

The author has attenuated Natrum muriaticum (common table-salt) until
there was not a single saline property left. The salt had "lost his
savour;" and yet, with one drop of that attenuation in a goblet of
water, and a teaspoonful of the water administered at intervals of three
hours, she has cured a patient sinking in the last stage of typhoid
fever. The highest attenuation of homoeopathy and the most potent rises
above matter into mind. This discovery leads to more light. From it may
be learned that either human faith or the divine Mind is the healer and
that there is no efficacy in a drug.

Origin of pain

You say a boil is painful; but that is impossible, for matter without
mind is not painful. The boil simply manifests, through inflammation and
swelling, a belief in pain, and this belief is called a boil. Now
administer mentally to your patient a high attenuation of truth, and it
will soon cure the boil. The fact that pain cannot exist where there is
no mortal mind to feel it is a proof that this so-called mind makes its
own pain--that is, its own belief in pain.

Source of contagion

We weep because others weep, we yawn because they yawn, and we have
smallpox because others have it; but mortal mind, not matter, contains
and carries the infection. When this mental contagion is understood, we
shall be more careful of our mental conditions and we shall avoid
loquacious tattling about disease, as we would avoid advocating crime.
Neither sympathy nor society should ever tempt us to cherish

<span id="pg_154">p. 154</span>

error in any form, and certainly we should not be error's advocate.

Disease arises, like other mental conditions, from association. Since it
is a law of mortal mind that certain diseases should be regarded as
contagious, this law obtains credit through association,--calling up the
fear that creates the image of disease and its consequent manifestation
in the body.

Imaginary cholera

This fact in metaphysics is illustrated by the following incident: A man
was made to believe that he occupied a bed where a cholera patient had
died. Immediately the symptoms of this disease appeared, and the man
died. The fact was, that he had not caught the cholera by material
contact, because no cholera patient had been in that bed.

Children's ailments

If a child is exposed to contagion or infection, the mother is
frightened and says, "My child will be sick." The law of mortal mind and
her own fears govern her child more than the child's mind governs
itself, and they produce the very results which might have been
prevented through the opposite understanding. Then it is believed that
exposure to the contagion wrought the mischief.

That mother is not a Christian Scientist, and her affections need better
guidance, who says to her child: "You look sick," "You look tired," "You
need rest," or "You need medicine."

Such a mother runs to her little one, who thinks she has hurt her face
by falling on the carpet, and says, moaning more childishly than her
child, "Mamma knows you are hurt." The better and more successful method
for any mother to adopt is to say: "Oh, never mind! You're not

<span id="pg_155">p. 155</span>

hurt, so don't think you are." Presently the child forgets all about the
accident, and is at play.

Drug-power mental

When the sick recover by the use of drugs, it is the law of a general
belief, culminating in individual faith, which heals; and according to
this faith will the effect be. Even when you take away the individual
confidence in the drug, you have not yet divorced the drug from the
general faith. The chemist, the botanist, the druggist, the doctor, and
the nurse equip the medicine with their faith, and the beliefs which are
in the majority rule. When the general belief endorses the inanimate
drug as doing this or that, individual dissent or faith, unless it rests
on Science, is but a belief held by a minority, and such a belief is
governed by the majority.

Belief in physics

The universal belief in physics weighs against the high and mighty
truths of Christian metaphysics. This erroneous general belief, which
sustains medicine and produces all medical results, works against
Christian Science; and the percentage of power on the side of this
Science must mightily outweigh the power of popular belief in order to
heal a single case of disease. The human mind acts more powerfully to
offset the discords of matter and the ills of flesh, in proportion as it
puts less weight into the material or fleshly scale and more weight into
the spiritual scale. Homoeopathy diminishes the drug, but the potency of
the medicine increases as the drug disappears.

Nature of drugs

Vegetarianism, homoeopathy, and hydropathy have diminished drugging; but
if drugs are an antidote to disease, why lessen the antidote? If drugs
are good things, is it safe to say that the less in quantity you have of
them the better? If drugs

<span id="pg_156">p. 156</span>

possess intrinsic virtues or intelligent curative qualities, these
qualities must be mental. Who named drugs, and what made them good or
bad for mortals, beneficial or injurious?

Dropsy cured without drugs

A case of dropsy, given up by the faculty, fell into my hands. It was a
terrible case. Tapping had been employed, and yet, as she lay in her
bed, the patient looked like a barrel. I prescribed the fourth
attenuation of Argentum nitratum with occasional doses of a high
attenuation of Sulphuris. She improved perceptibly. Believing then
somewhat in the ordinary theories of medical practice, and learning that
her former physician had prescribed these remedies, I began to fear an
aggravation of symptoms from their prolonged use, and told the patient
so; but she was unwilling to give up the medicine while she was
recovering. It then occurred to me to give her unmedicated pellets and
watch the result. I did so, and she continued to gain. Finally she said
that she would give up her medicine for one day, and risk the effects.
After trying this, she informed me that she could get along two days
without globules; but on the third day she again suffered, and was
relieved by taking them. She went on in this way, taking the unmedicated
pellets,--and receiving occasional visits from me,--but employing no
other means, and she was cured.

A stately advance

Metaphysics, as taught in Christian Science, is the next stately step
beyond homoeopathy. In metaphysics, matter disappears from the remedy
entirely, and Mind takes its rightful and supreme place. Homoeopathy
takes mental symptoms largely

<span id="pg_157">p. 157</span>

into consideration in its diagnosis of disease. Christian Science deals
wholly with the mental cause in judging and destroying disease. It
succeeds where homoeopathy fails, solely because its one recognized
Principle of healing is Mind, and the whole force of the mental element
is employed through the Science of Mind, which never shares its rights
with inanimate matter.

The modus of homoeopathy

Christian Science exterminates the drug, and rests on Mind alone as the
curative Principle, acknowledging that the divine Mind has all power.
Homoeopathy mentalizes a drug with such repetition of
thought-attenuations, that the drug becomes more like the human mind
than the substratum of this socalled mind, which we call matter; and the
drug's power of action is proportionately increased.

Drugging unchristian

If drugs are part of God's creation, which (according to the narrative
in Genesis) He pronounced good, then drugs cannot be poisonous. If He
could create drugs intrinsically bad, then they should never be used. If
He creates drugs at all and designs them for medical use, why did Jesus
not employ them and recommend them for the treatment of disease? Matter
is not self-creative, for it is unintelligent. Erring mortal mind
confers the power which the drug seems to possess.

Narcotics quiet mortal mind, and so relieve the body; but they leave
both mind and body worse for this submission. Christian Science
impresses the entire corporeality,--namely, mind and body,--and brings
out the proof that Life is continuous and harmonious. Science both
neutralizes error and destroys it. Mankind is the better for this
spiritual and profound pathology.

<span id="pg_158">p. 158</span>

Mythology and materia medica

It is recorded that the profession of medicine originated in idolatry
with pagan priests, who besought the gods to heal the sick and
designated Apollo as "the god of medicine." He was supposed to have
dictated the first prescription, according to the "History of Four
Thousand Years of Medicine." It is here noticeable that Apollo was also
regarded as the sender of disease, "the god of pestilence." Hippocrates
turned from image-gods to vegetable and mineral drugs for healing. This
was deemed progress in medicine; but what we need is the truth which
heals both mind and body. The future history of material medicine may
correspond with that of its material god, Apollo, who was banished from
heaven and endured great sufferings upon earth.

Footsteps to intemperance

Drugs, cataplasms, and whiskey are stupid substitutes for the dignity
and potency of divine Mind and its efficacy to heal. It is pitiful to
lead men into temptation through the byways of this wilderness
world,--to victimize the race with intoxicating prescriptions for the
sick, until mortal mind acquires an educated appetite for strong drink,
and men and women become loathsome sots.

Advancing degrees

Evidences of progress and of spiritualization greet us on every hand.
Drug-systems are quitting their hold on matter and so letting in
matter's higher stratum, mortal mind. Homoeopathy, a step in advance of
allopathy, is doing this. Matter is going out of medicine; and mortal
mind, of a higher attenuation than the drug, is governing the pellet.

Effects of fear

A woman in the city of Lynn, Massachusetts, was etherized and died in
consequence, although her physi

<span id="pg_159">p. 159</span>

cians insisted that it would be unsafe to perform a needed surgical
operation without the ether. After the autopsy, her sister testified
that the deceased protested against inhaling the ether and said it would
kill her, but that she was compelled by her physicians to take it. Her
hands were held, and she was forced into submission. The case was
brought to trial. The evidence was found to be conclusive, and a verdict
was returned that death was occasioned, not by the ether, but by fear of
inhaling it.

Mental conditions to be heeded

Is it skilful or scientific surgery to take no heed of mental conditions
and to treat the patient as if she were so much mindless matter, and as
if matter were the only factor to be consulted? Had these unscientific
surgeons understood metaphysics, they would have considered the woman's
state of mind, and not have risked such treatment. They would either
have allayed her fear or would have performed the operation without
ether.

The sequel proved that this Lynn woman died from effects produced by
mortal mind, and not from the disease or the operation.

False source of knowledge

The medical schools would learn the state of man from matter instead of
from Mind. They examine the lungs, tongue, and pulse to ascertain how
much harmony, or health, matter is permitting to matter,--how much pain
or pleasure, action or stagnation, one form of matter is allowing
another form of matter.

Ignorant of the fact that a man's belief produces disease and all its
symptoms, the ordinary physician is liable to increase disease with his
own mind, when he

<span id="pg_160">p. 160</span>

should address himself to the work of destroying it through the power of
the divine Mind.

The systems of physics act against metaphysics, and vice versa. When
mortals forsake the material for the spiritual basis of action, drugs
lose their healing force, for they have no innate power. Unsupported by
the faith reposed in it, the inanimate drug becomes powerless.

Obedient muscles

The motion of the arm is no more dependent upon the direction of mortal
mind, than are the organic action and secretion of the viscera. When
this so-called mind quits the body, the heart becomes as torpid as the
hand.

Anatomy and mind

Anatomy finds a necessity for nerves to convey the mandate of mind to
muscle and so cause action; but what does anatomy say when the cords
contract and become immovable? Has mortal mind ceased speaking to them,
or has it bidden them to be impotent? Can muscles, bones, blood, and
nerves rebel against mind in one instance and not in another, and become
cramped despite the mental protest?

Unless muscles are self-acting at all times, they are never so,--never
capable of acting contrary to mental direction. If muscles can cease to
act and become rigid of their own preference,--be deformed or
symmetrical, as they please or as disease directs, - they must be
selfdirecting. Why then consult anatomy to learn how mortal mind governs
muscle, if we are only to learn from anatomy that muscle is not so
governed?

Mind over matter

Is man a material fungus without Mind to help him? Is a stiff joint or a
contracted muscle as much a result of law as the supple and

<span id="pg_161">p. 161</span>

elastic condition of the healthy limb, and is God the lawgiver?

You say, "I have burned my finger." This is an exact statement, more
exact than you suppose; for mortal mind, and not matter, burns it. Holy
inspiration has created states of mind which have been able to nullify
the action of the flames, as in the Bible case of the three young Hebrew
captives, cast into the Babylonian furnace; while an opposite mental
state might produce spontaneous combustion.

Restrictive regulations

In 1880, Massachusetts put her foot on a proposed tyrannical law,
restricting the practice of medicine. If her sister States follow this
example in harmony with our Constitution and Bill of Rights, they will
do less violence to that immortal sentiment of the Declaration, "Man is
endowed by his Maker with certain inalienable rights, among which are
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

The oppressive state statutes touching medicine remind one of the words
of the famous Madame Roland, as she knelt before a statue of Liberty,
erected near the guillotine: "Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy
name!"

Metaphysics challenges physics

The ordinary practitioner, examining bodily symptoms, telling the
patient that he is sick, and treating the case according to his physical
diagnosis, would naturally induce the very disease he is trying to cure,
even if it were not already determined by mortal mind. Such unconscious
mistakes would not occur, if this old class of philanthropists looked as
deeply for cause and effect into mind as into matter. The physician
agrees with his "adversary quickly," but upon different terms

<span id="pg_162">p. 162</span>

than does the metaphysician; for the matter-physician agrees with the
disease, while the metaphysician agrees only with health and challenges
disease.

Truth an alterative

Christian Science brings to the body the sunlight of Truth, which
invigorates and purifies. Christian Science acts as an alterative,
neutralizing error with Truth. It changes the secretions, expels humors,
dissolves tumors, relaxes rigid muscles, restores carious bones to
soundness. The effect of this Science is to stir the human mind to a
change of base, on which it may yield to the harmony of the divine Mind.

Practical success

Experiments have favored the fact that Mind governs the body, not in one
instance, but in every instance. The indestructible faculties of Spirit
exist without the conditions of matter and also without the false
beliefs of a so-called material existence. Working out the rules of
Science in practice, the author has restored health in cases of both
acute and chronic disease in their severest forms. Secretions have been
changed, the structure has been renewed, shortened limbs have been
elongated, ankylosed joints have been made supple, and carious bones
have been restored to healthy conditions. I have restored what is called
the lost substance of lungs, and healthy organizations have been
established where disease was organic. Christian Science heals organic
disease as surely as it heals what is called functional, for it requires
only a fuller understanding of the divine Principle of Christian Science
to demonstrate the higher rule.

Testimony of medical teachers

With due respect for the faculty, I kindly quote from Dr. Benjamin Rush,
the famous Philadelphia teacher of medical practice. He declared that
"it is impossible to calculate the mischief

<span id="pg_163">p. 163</span>

which Hippocrates has done, by first marking Nature with his name, and
afterward letting her loose upon sick people."

Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse, Professor in Harvard University, declared
himself "sick of learned quackery."

Dr. James Johnson, Surgeon to William IV, King Of England, said:

"I declare my conscientious opinion, founded on long observation and
reflection, that if there were not a single physician, surgeon,
apothecary, man-midwife, chemist, druggist, or drug on the face of the
earth, there would be less sickness and less mortality."

Dr. Mason Good, a learned Professor in London, said :

"The effects of medicine on the human system are in the highest degree
uncertain; except, indeed, that it has already destroyed more lives than
war, pestilence, and famine, all combined."

Dr. Chapman, Professor of the Institutes and Practice of Physic in the
University of Pennsylvania, in a published essay said

"Consulting the records of our science, we cannot help being disgusted
with the multitude of hypotheses obtruded upon us at different times.
Nowhere is the imagination displayed to a greater extent; and perhaps so
ample an exhibition of human invention might gratify our vanity, if it
were not more than compensated by the humiliating view of so much
absurdity, contradiction, and falsehood. To harmonize the contrarieties
of medical doctrines is indeed a task as impractible as to arrange the
fleeting vapors around us, or to reconcile the fixed and repulsive
antipathies of nature. Dark and

<span id="pg_164">p. 164</span>

perplexed, our devious career resembles the groping of Homer's Cyclops
around his cave."

Sir John Forbes, M.D., F.R.S., Fellow of the Royal College of
Physicians, London, said:

"No systematic or theoretical classification of diseases or of
therapeutic agents, ever yet promulgated, is true, or anything like the
truth, and none can be adopted as a safe guidance in practice."

It is just to say that generally the cultured class of medical
practitioners are grand men and women, therefore they are more
scientific than are false claimants to Christian Science. But all human
systems based on material premises are minus the unction of divine
Science. Much yet remains to be said and done before all mankind is
saved and all the mental microbes of sin and all diseased thought-germs
are exterminated.

If you or I should appear to die, we should not be dead. The seeming
decease, caused by a majority of human beliefs that man must die, or
produced by mental assassins, does not in the least disprove Christian
Science; rather does it evidence the truth of its basic proposition that
mortal thoughts in belief rule the materiality miscalled life in the
body or in matter. But the forever fact remains paramount that Life,
Truth, and Love save from sin, disease, and death. "When this
corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have
put on immortality \[divine Science\], then shall be brought to pass the
saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory" (St. Paul).
