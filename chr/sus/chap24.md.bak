## THE SPECIAL RELIGIOUS NEED OF THE UN-OBTRUSIVENESS OF THE SPIRITUAL

The chief difference, no doubt, consists in the fact that, in the
religious life, we are dealing with the most fundamental of all
relations—the relation to God, which, we have already seen, has a
universality all its own. Even the ethical life, therefore, so far as it
is conceived as independent of the religious, has no such sweep as the
religious life. And if the ethical demanded the training of a constantly
compelled struggle, this, much more. To come into any worthy personal
relation to a God, right relation to whom involves right relation to all
others and to all else, is no holiday task. It calls for a girding up of
the loins of our minds. "Self-renunciation," à Kempis reminds us, "is
not the work of one day, nor children's sport." Moreover, the simple
fact that in the religious life we have to deal with an unseen God, so
unobtrusive as to seem almost deliberately to hide his working, gives to
the conditions of the religious life some real difference. Here we have
not only to maintain ourselves in a spiritual world, plainly given as a
fact, but we have almost to maintain the reality of that world itself.
We must create, in some real sense, not only our moral spirit, but also
the very realm in which that spirit is to be shown. The very existence
for us of the spiritual world, that is, seems in no small measure
committed to our trust. Day by day we are to assure ourselves anew:
There is a God; he does love; man is free; man is immortal; this life is
not all; there is a growing, all-embracing Kingdom of God. That religion
has in all this a task somewhat, though not wholly, peculiar, will
hardly be denied.

But the difference just noted, like the first difference, evidently
makes a supreme demand upon the ethical purpose. And the contrast
between the conditions of the religious life and those of all the rest
of life, except the ethical, as to the intended obscurity with which we
have to deal, lies exactly in this inseparableness of the religious and
the ethical. The ethical spirit is absolutely essential to the true
religious life. There must, therefore, be emphasized in every possible
way in the religious life that which will morally train; and the merely
formal, perfunctory, or imitated must be sternly eliminated. If there is
a God at all, who really intends to bring us to the highest life, we may
confidently expect that the conditions of our life will be so shaped as
to call out in us the persistent ethical will. In Herrmann's
words,\[<a href="#foot1" id="text1">1</a>\] "We are to seek communion
with God, not as something alongside of devotion to what is good, but
only in this devotion."

Above all else, this means that the conditions must be such that the
religious life may be the man's own, voluntarily chosen and voluntarily
kept. If this is to be true, a sacred reverence for the human
personality must be a controlling principle in all God's dealing with
us. Man's freedom will be respected, and his individuality respected.
There will be no over-riding of either in any way. This implies that, in
the nature of the case, it is impossible that there should be any
forcing of God and the spiritual life upon a man. They must become his
own, by voluntary recognition, by persistent choosing. Only so can he
keep his spiritual life and grow in it.

And if there is to be no forcing of God and the spiritual world upon a
man, this would seem to mean further, that we can expect no absolutely
incontrovertible evidences, no overpowering signs—certainly not before
the ethical choice. A choice will be left, some room for our own
attitude of will to have its effect. It is this principle that Pascal
seems to have in mind when he says:\[<a href="#foot2" id="text2">2</a>\]
"God wished to render himself perfectly recognizable to those who seek
him with their whole heart; and hidden from those who shun him with all
their heart." "Religion is a thing so great, that it is just that those
who would not take the pains to seek it, if it is obscure, should be
deprived of it. What do they complain of then, if it is such that they
could find it by seeking it?" And he intimates how this obscurity
becomes a moral test: "If you care but little to know the truth, here
\[in a suggested difficulty\] is enough to leave you in repose. But if
you desire with all your heart to know the truth, it is not enough,
examine minutely."

Wherever, then, we ask in the spiritual life for incontrovertible
evidence, we ask not only for that which transcends our limitations, but
for that which on moral grounds also is not to be granted; we ask that
the conditions of our life should be less perfectly adapted than they
now are to our highest moral and spiritual needs. The seeming unreality
of the spiritual world becomes itself, thus, a ground of trust.

But even more than this is to be said. Our moral need seems plainly to
require, also, that there shall be no domination of the human
personality by God's personality. Not only will God not thrust the fact
of his existence upon us in resistless fashion, whatever our moral
attitude, but in his personal relation to us, even after we have
voluntarily and gladly recognized it, he will still sacredly respect our
own moral initiative and our own individuality. Because he would bring
us to real character and to a spiritual experience of our own, he will
jealously guard his action, hiding his hand in his dealing with us, not
putting upon us the practically irresistible pressure of over-powering
personality. If even the parent and elder friend need to take pains not
to dominate with their personalities the growing personality of the
child, much more must the- Infinite Personality guard the manifestations
of himself. The very possibility of unmistakably genuine character in
finite beings seems to depend upon the fact that God should, thus, at
least in the preliminary stages of their training, scrupulously remain
the indemonstrable, the invisible, the hidden, the unobtrusive God,
showing such a reverence for the personality of his children as men
never show for one another.

Kant clearly recognizes this imperative need of the hidden God, and his
own careful statement deserves
quotation:\[<a href="#foot3" id="text3">3</a>\] Else "God and eternity
with their awful majesty would stand unceasingly before our eyes, (for
what we can prove perfectly is to us as certain as that of which we are
assured by the sight of our eyes). Transgression of the law would no
doubt be avoided, what is commanded would be done; but the mental
disposition, from which actions ought to proceed, cannot be infused by
any command, and in this case the spur of action is ever active and
external, so that reason has no need to exert itself in order to gather
strength to resist the inclinations by a lively representation of the
dignity of the law: hence most of the actions that conformed to the law
would be done from fear, a few only from hope, and none at all from
duty, and the moral worth of actions, on which alone in the eyes of
supreme wisdom the worth of the person and even that of the world
depends, would cease to exist. As long as the nature of man remains what
it is, his conduct would thus be changed into mere mechanism, in which,
as in a puppet show, everything would gesticulate well, but there would
be no life in the figures. Now, when it is quite otherwise with us, when
with all the effort of our reason we have only a very obscure and
doubtful view into the future, when the Governor of the world allows us
only to conjecture his existence and his majesty, not to behold them or
prove them clearly; and on the other hand, the moral law within us,
without promising or threatening anything with certainty, demands of us
disinterested respect; and only when this respect has become active and
dominant, does it allow us by means of it a prospect into the world of
the super-sensible, and then only with weak glances: all this being so,
there is room for true moral disposition, immediately devoted to the
law, and a rational creature can become worthy of sharing in the summum
bonum that corresponds to the worth of his person and not merely to his
actions. Thus what the study of nature and of man teaches us
sufficiently elsewhere may well be true here also; that the unsearchable
wisdom by which we exist is not less worthy of admiration in what it has
denied than in what it has granted."

It is not strange, then, after all, that the Spiritual life meets us
constantly with the paradoxical demand that we should in some real sense
create the objects of our faith, as well as act in view of them. So Kant
felt as to God and freedom and immortality. So Fichte affirmed as to the
entire world of the spirit. So James has asserted most strongly as to
freedom. So Browning and many another has believed as to the love of God
and all that that involves. Religion is a deed. And, in a very real
sense, we are left to determine whether for us there shall be a God, and
a loving God, a freedom, an immortality, a future world, a Kingdom of
God. God has intended that the conditions of our life should be such as
to challenge us at every point to a stalwart faith and a stalwart life.
As Browning says, thinking of the central truth of all—the love of God,
and his supreme historical revelation in Christ:

"So duly, daily, needs provision be  
 For keeping the soul's prowess possible,  
 Building new barriers as the old decay,  
 Saving us from evasion of life's proof,  
 Putting the question ever, 'Does God love,  
 And will ye hold that truth against the world?'"

And it is impossible to let this truth, of which we are now speaking,
get full possession of us, and not find a great new light thrown on the
whole dark problem of evil—our greatest natural obstacle to a satisfying
religious faith. Seeing how much is at stake in this reverent guarding,
at any cost, of our moral initiative

and of our individuality, we learn not to expect God to interfere, even
when great evils threaten. The greatest evil, after all, would be that
the conditions of genuine character should fail. We come even to rejoice
that we live, in this time of our preliminary training, in a world in
which the rewards of virtue do not seem to follow either immediately or
certainly. The natural and inevitable doubt which underlies for every
man "the problem of evil" becomes, in the light of this far reaching
principle of reverence for personality, itself a cause of thanksgiving;
for it insures that our righteous choices shall not be selfishly
motived. We are glad that the genuinely unselfish choice seems so often
to cut right athwart our own interests; for it means that our wills are
not over-ridden. The very existence of the problem of evil makes
possible our belief in the genuineness of the character of ourselves and
of others. It is a heavy price that is thus paid, no doubt; but it is
not too heavy for the priceless interests so guarded.

We have to recognize, on the part of God, then, something like a really
purposed obscuring of the spiritual world. The seeming unreality of the
spiritual life is a chief part of our moral and spiritual training.
