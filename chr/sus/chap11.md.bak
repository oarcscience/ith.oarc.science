## DIFFICULTY IN THE CONCEPTION OF GOD

There are, still, certain special applications of the doctrine of
relativity that, because of their direct bearing on the religious life,
it may be worth while briefly to consider. It is often urged, that the
very terms we apply to God show that we must be out of any real living
relation to him. The term 'Absolute,' for example, has been made, of
itself, to settle the whole matter. The Absolute, it is said, is that
which by hypothesis is out of all relations, and with which, therefore,
it is of course not possible to come into relations. One would be almost
ashamed to call attention to such pure verbal jugglery, if it had not
been so often solemnly paraded as an argument of vital consequence. God
is not the Absolute, let us unhesitatingly say, as being unrelated. A
being out of all relation to all else—incapable, that is, of any
possible reciprocal action with other beings—would be as nearly a
nonentity as we could well conceive, if indeed it were possible to
conceive such a supposed being at all. On the contrary, God is the
Absolute rather, in that he is the being in whom all relations find
their reason and possibility of existence.

Nor is God the Absolute in the sense that he is without qualities. This
would be to assert that he is without content, whereas we must rather
conceive of God as having the richest, largest, fullest content, in the
direction of Spinoza's idea of an infinite number of attributes.
Positively, the Absolute as applied to God ought to mean, raised above
all the limitations which pertain to the finite as a mere part of a
whole—the final and fundamental source of all, unexhausted in any or all
of his manifestations.

Similar statements need to be made about the use of the word
unchangeable, as applied to God. God is unchangeable in the consistency
of the meaning of his nature and of his loving purpose. But instead of
this making it true that there can then be no change in him answering to
our need, it rather insures such adjusting activity as his love
requires. This whole false notion of un-changeableness in God goes back
to a metaphysically false and abandoned notion of an ever identical
stuff or substance, and should no longer be allowed to obscure our
religious thinking or living. We are to believe in a really living God,
who is in the realest reciprocal action with all the finite, and with
whom, therefore, our inner attitude does make a difference.

And when we have once gotten rid of these spectres of an unthinkable
Absolute and of an ever-identical substance, we discover that that other
ghost is also laid, that supposes that there is some profound
philosophical difficulty in prayer or in any revelation. There is, in
truth, no sound reason, philosophical or scientific, for denying that
God has actual access to our minds. Lotze certainly did not speak
without full knowledge of all the difficulties involved when he said:
"There is nothing whatever that stands in opposition to the further
conviction that God, at particular moments and in particular persons,
may have stood nearer to humanity, or may have revealed himself at such
moments and in such persons in a more eminent way than at other moments
and in other persons. . . . It is even without doubt legitimate to
regard the relation in which he \[Christ\] stood to God as absolutely
unique, not only as to degree but also as to its essential
quality."\[<a href="#foot20" id="text20">20</a>\]

Once more, I think religion ought to count exorcised that other
philosophical spectre, which affirms a necessary contradiction between
the terms Infinite and personality. Of course, if one starts, as Paulsen
does, with a definition of personality as "the form peculiar to human
life," that by hypothesis restricts it to the finite, it is easy to
prove that such personality cannot belong to the Infinite. But the
continuation of Paulsen's own argument, though he calls his view
"pantheistic," really shows that he himself cannot rest there:
"Pantheism, as we understand it, has no intention of depriving God of
anything or of denying him anything but human limitations. It will not
permit us to define God by the concept of personality, simply because
the notion is too narrow for the infinite fulness and depth of his
being. Still, in order to remove the apprehension, we might call God a
supra-personal being, not intending thereby to define his essence, but
to indicate that God's nature is above the human mind, not below it. And
Pantheism might add that it finds no fault with anyone for calling God a
personal being in this sense. Insomuch as the human mind is the highest
and most important thing that we know, we can form an idea of God only
by intensifying human attributes. .... That is the possible and
inevitable anthropomorphism of all
religions."\[<a href="#foot21" id="text21">21</a>\]

It seems wholly legitimate not only but, for our ultimate thinking, far
more satisfactory to say, as Lotze essentially does, that the fact is,
that so far from being true that personality is inconsistent with the
Infinite, it is rather true that personality can be regarded as complete
and perfect only in the Infinite. He alone, whose being is not bestowed
by another and therefore in much necessarily hidden; he alone, who is
not a mere part in a whole; he alone, whose memory may infallibly gather
all the past; he alone, whose life is absolutely self-conditioned—he
alone can have complete self-consciousness and perfect freedom, can thus
be a perfect personality.\[<a href="#foot22" id="text22">22</a>\] The
terms Infinite and personal, thus, do not seem to me contradictory.
Moreover, it is to be remembered that the alternative conceptions,
suggested by such terms as "Impersonal Spirit," "Moral World Order,"
"Infinite Substance," "Self-developing Idea," we are really not able to
think at all without at least tacit reference to the notion of personal
spirit. It may well be, that God transcends all our highest thought, and
in this sense may be called "supra-personal," though this is for us
wholly empty of content; but our highest possible conception of him,
nevertheless, is as personal.

Perhaps no one in modern literature has indicated more effectively the
legitimacy of this argument, from the best in the human to the divine,
than Browning, in the latter part of his "Saul." This is hardly less
than a consummate study of the way by which inspiration may come, and
its resulting mood. The whole theme of the latter part of the poem is
that God cannot be less than man at his best, even in man's willingness
to suffer for love's sake. And the whole world seems to David, in
Browning's closing paragraph, to feel the awe of this revelation, and to
throb with this vision of an infinitely loving, suffering God:

 

> > "I believe it! 'Tis thou, God, that givest, 'tis I who receive:  
> >  In the first is the last, in thy will is ray power to believe."
> >
> >  "See the King—I would help him but cannot, the wishes fall  
> >         through.  
> > Could I wrestle to raise him from sorrow, grow poor to enrich,  
> > To fill up his life, starve my own out,  
> > I would—knowing which, I know that my service is perfect.  
> > Oh, speak through me now!  
> > Would I suffer for him that I love?  
> > So wouldst thou—so wilt thou!  
> > So shall crown thee the topmost, ineffablest, uttermost crown—  
> > And thy love fill infinitude wholly, nor leave up nor down  
> > One spot for the creature to stand in!"

 

Browning often argues that will is more than power, and love than will;
and that God cannot be less in any of these ways than man at his best.
We have no higher capacities for the true vision of God than exactly the
divinest qualities in ourselves,—the qualities of a seeking, suffering,
self-giving love. This is a fully justified part of that "inevitable
anthropomorphism of all religions" of which Paulsen speaks. No
philosophical inheritances need be regarded as invalidating the essence
of this contention.
