## THE NEEDED EMPHASES IN MODERN RELIGIOUS LIFE

If one asks, now, what is involved in these statements, and attempts to
characterize the Christian way to communion with God, he will be obliged
to say that, for the fully modern man, the way must be ethical,
Christian, social, biblical, practical, and, in all these points alike,
rational.

It must be ethical, for no religious experience can justify itself to a
man who has come to moral self-consciousness, which does not offer, in
the sphere of the moral, a deepening of the moral life. Mere emotions,
therefore, however entrancing, will not answer. Here lies the far
reaching significance of the Reformers' insistence that God's presence
is to be found in the daily calling, and the sense of his nearness to be
won just there, *in* the doing of the daily duty.

It must be Christian, in building, as we have seen, directly on the fact
of Christ as the one fact sufficiently great and significant to open a
certain way to God for the modern man.

It must be social, because in the sphere of religion, as in all other
spheres of value, we are almost inevitably introduced through the
witness of those who already share in the value. And, doubtless, for
some the religious experience remains to the end in much larger degree
indirect, than for others. And for all of us some of our best visions of
the spiritual come through others. The social trend of the Christian's
communion with God is seen, too, in the indispensable fellowship with
the Church and with the great prophetic seers of history, as well as in
the inevitable way in which the kingdom of God must go forward by the
witness, given from heart to heart, of what men have found Christ to be
to them.

It must be biblical, not as building on a book, but in just so far as
the Bible is regarded not as a record of doctrines or history to be
authoritatively accepted, but as a book of honest testimony to
experience. Its supreme value lies just here. For the testimony of
another is our chief road to enlargement of life. Most of all, it is
through such simple, honest witness that the New Testament puts us face
to face with the redeeming personality of Christ. Whatever our theories
about the Bible, it is not as compelling authority, but as simple,
honest witness that the New Testament brings us emancipating power.

In another's words, "The inner life of Jesus is stamped, on the
testimony of men who have been set free by him. In this way has it
become a force in history, and in no other way was that possible. Hence
we can lay hold on it and make it ours only when we let the witness of
his disciples lay hold on us." And that witness the Christian "finds in
Scripture as nowhere else."

Treated as a book throbbing thus with personal life-as a book of honest
testimony to experience broad and deep, in the moral and spiritual
life-and approached through a true historical method, I have no doubt
that the Bible will increasingly prove what the free critic, Edmond
Scherer, claimed: "The Bible will ever be the book of power, the
marvellous book, *the* book above all others. It will ever be the light
of the mind and the bread of the soul. Neither the superstitions of
some, nor the irreligious negations of others have been able to do it
harm. If there is anything certain in the world, it is that the
destinies of the Bible are linked with the destinies of holiness on
earth."

The modern emphasis, again, must be practical, as wrought out in
experience, and submitting not only gladly, but of deliberate purpose,
to the test of experiment in life. The experiment here is the endeavor
to find whether the deepest laws and trends of our being do unmistakably
point to God. And it is in this practical way that we must apply, each
for himself, the psychological and sociological tests which have already
been considered. Do the Christian conception of the spiritual life and
the honest response to the inner life of Christ give opportunity for the
highest and fullest personal self-expression and personal association,
justifying themselves, thus, rationally and ethically? If the individual
finds himself compelled, as I certainly do, to return an unhesitating
affirmative to this question, then he will simply be saying that the
deepest laws and trends of human nature reach their fullest
justification and growth only upon the Christian assumption.
