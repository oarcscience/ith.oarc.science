## THE NEED OF THE MODERN MAN MET ONLY IN CHRIST

Surely Herrmann is right in saying that theologians of all schools may
at least agree as to the general meaning of personal Christianity. "It
is a communion of the soul with the living God, through the mediation of
Christ. Herein is really included all that belongs to the characteristic
life of Christendom—revelation and faith, conversion and the comfort of
forgiveness, the joy of faith and the service of love, lonely communion
with God, and life in Christian
fellowship."\[<a href="#foot1" id="text1">1</a>\]

Our very first and greatest problem, therefore, on the positive side, in
dealing with the reality of the spiritual life, is to make it clear just
how the individual soul may come into undoubted communion with a living
God. It needs especially to be noted that our age has come, in such
preeminent degree, to scientific and moral self-consciousness, that for
the men of to-day the previous easier roads into the religious life are
in large degree closed. The psychological treatment, for example, of
mystical experiences has made it impossible for us to take at their own
estimation all kinds of ecstatic states, and we can feel no surety in
these short-cuts to communion with God in a religious experience that
cannot bear a rational and ethical test. With Herrmann, we have to ask
those who so base their religious conviction, "how they are sure they
are really aware of God Himself when they have those emotions in which
their whole nature seems exalted. Our confidence in God needs other
support than the recollection of such purely emotional experiences can
give."\[<a href="#foot2" id="text2">2</a>\]

Whatever has been true for previous generations, and whatever is still
true for those who have not entered fully into the consciousness of the
present time—for many of us, our road to God must now be indubitably
rational and ethical. It is impossible that we should rest in any
religious experience that cannot so justify itself. The men of the fully
modern spirit are, therefore, simply driven to find their way into a
personal communion with God through facts so great that they can bear
the severest rational and ethical test. And the religion that can fully
satisfy the modern man must, thus, build unmistakably on the great
fact-foundation of man's own rational and ethical nature, and upon a
personality great enough to reveal God, and to bring indubitable
conviction of God's existence and of his personal communion with the
individual soul.

It is just at this point that Christianity has its supreme gift to make
to the man of to-day. For the service of Christianity here is the more
priceless and indispensable to the modern man, the more deeply he has
entered into the modern spirit. For the deeper our moral consciousness,
the greater our sense of moral need. In Herrmann's
words,\[<a href="#foot3" id="text3">3</a>\] "We feel ourselves to be
separated from God, and consequently crippled in our faith by things
which troubled the ancients very little. We cannot go back to our first
simple indifference to moral demands after our conscience has once been
sensible of them. Above all, the knowledge that we are bound to
unconditional obedience can never die away into sloth and inactivity
after it has once dawned upon us. So that when we are faced by something
that wants to force itself on us as a Power over our entire life, the
doubt arises in our minds whether in it we really find something we can
be conscientiously willing to obey unconditionally. He who is morally
free will mock at a religion that is above morality just as he pities
one that is beneath it. Therefore, the only God that can reveal Himself
to us is one who shows Himself to us in our moral struggle as the Power
to which our souls are really subject. This is what is vouchsafed to us
in the revelation of God in Jesus Christ." This simply means that, for
the modern man who has awakened to full moral self-consciousness, many
an ancient way of approach to God is decisively closed; and if he is to
come into communion with God at all, it must be by a manifestation of
God great enough to make certain both the holiness of God and his
forgiveness of us.

Now, it is through the witness of the New Testament writers that we find
in Christ for ourselves a fact so great, so transcendent, that we come
back to it again and again with calm assurance, to find in its simple
presence the indubitable conviction of the spiritual world, of our own
intended destiny, of God, and of his holiness and his love. Christ does
not merely tell us these things—he does much more—he makes us able to
believe them. He, and no other as he, searches us, humbles us, assures
us, and exalts us at the same time. Only through him do we come with
assurance into the great convictions, the great hopes, and the great
aspirations; and these measure us as does nothing else. Only through him
are we brought into living communion with the living God. If I may quote
Herrmann again: "The most important thing for the man who is to submit
himself to God is surely that he should be absolutely certain of the
reality of God, and Jesus does establish in us, through the fact of his
personal life, a certainty of God which covers every doubt. When once he
has attracted us by the beauty of His Person, and made us bow before Him
by its exalted character, then even amid our deepest doubts, that Person
of Jesus will remain present with us as a thing incomparable, the most
precious fact in history, the most precious fact our life contains."
Thus, "the religious life of the Christian is inseparable from vision of
the personal life of Jesus. That vision must be the Christian's constant
companion, and so it is, as he finds more and more that in such vision
he grasps that reality without which all else in the world is empty and
desolate."
