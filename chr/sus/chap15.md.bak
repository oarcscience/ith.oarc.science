## THE SPIRITUAL LIFE NOT A LIFE OF IMITATION

It is equally important for us to remember, if the spiritual life is to
be real to us, that it is not a life of the imitation or repetition of
the experience of others. That we need others here, as elsewhere, is
clear. That we come into most that is of value to us, through
introduction by some other, is also plain. Nevertheless, if the
spiritual world is to have the fullest reality for us—the reality it
ought to have for a mind awakened to mature self-consciousness—we must
have some experience in the spiritual that is genuinely our own, not a
hollow echo of something we have heard from others.

In a Christian community, where the language of religious experience is
familiar, perhaps there is no greater danger besetting the spiritual
life than this danger of merely imitating the experience of others. To
face the reality of a genuine religious experience, heartily to fulfil
the conditions upon which alone it may become genuinely ours, means much
that is uncomfortable—real willingness to see the facts of our own life
and need as they are, the breaking down of our pride, the giving up of
our selfishness and self-indulgence, the putting of ourselves really and
persistently in the presence of God's supreme revelation in Christ. This
is not easy. Men naturally shrink from it. It is far easier to satisfy
oneself with a very shallow dealing with the problem of our life, and
then to catch up the traditional language of religious experience from
others.

This temptation, in the individual himself, is increased by the virtual
demand that has been very generally made by the Church, that there must
be a full expression of the meaning of the Christian life at the very
beginning, or even as a condition of entering upon it at all. But how is
it possible that this should honestly be? It seems very like requiring a
student to pass upon a course as a condition of entering it. A
confession of Christ that means anything must be one's own, the honest
expression of what one has already found Christ to be. A confession of
faith requires that the faith—the living experience—should be there,
before we confess it. But how can a man confess the divinity of Christ,
for example, as a condition of becoming a disciple of Christ? The only
confession of Christ's divinity, that can be even approximately
adequate, can come only in his disciple-ship, in one's deepening
experience of what Christ has come to be to him. Plainly, Christ's own
little circle of the twelve came only gradually, under association with
him, to any adequate confession of him. We have no right to require
more. The point of insistence is, not that we should accept the creed of
the apostles in order to come into their experience, but rather that we
should seek an experience like the apostles, that may fruit in a like
confession, which can then be genuinely our own.

The very familiarity with the language of religious experience, then,
the instinctive temptation to catch up the expression of life rather
than to insist upon the life itself, and the demand of the Church for an
expression of Christian life quite beyond the possibility of
experience,—all combine to produce the far too general habit of
expressing more than has been personally known and experienced, and
hence to give the sense of unreality. This is, to my mind, the most
serious danger, for example, of the Christian Endeavor pledge,
particularly with those quite young, where the matter is not carefully
guarded. They are pledged to speak, whether they have really something
of their own to say or not. They naturally catch up the language of
Christian experience, which they have heard from others. Gradually, if
they are thoughtful and conscientious and have not been making unusual
growth, they come to feel that their language is no true reflection of
their own experience. They feel its hollowness; a reaction sets in; and
a most depressing sense of the unreality of the spiritual life naturally
succeeds. We must not shut our eyes to such dangers. In any case,
wherever the religious life becomes, to any large degree, a life of mere
imitation or repetition of others' experiences, and the person is at all
thoughtful, there the spiritual life is certain to come to seem
thoroughly unreal.
