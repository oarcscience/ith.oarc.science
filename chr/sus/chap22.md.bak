## THE WITNESS OF OUR CONSCIOUSLY BEST HOURS

This close connection of the religious and the ethical leads us to
emphasize the important principle that, when we find fluctuations in our
convictions concerning the reality of anything, we must ask for the
witness of our consciously best hours, physically, intellectually, and
morally. If religious conviction does tend to go up and down with our
moral attitude, and the ethical has any real justification, then our
religious convictions are just so far confirmed. And, with reference to
the entire man, it behooves us to ask, When does the spiritual world
seem most real to us? in our best or our worst moments? when we are
consciously most in possession of ourselves in every way, or when we are
consciously below our best? So Tyndall, for example, tested the doctrine
of material atheism: "I have noticed," he said, "during years of
self-observation, that it is not in hours of clearness and vigor that
this doctrine commends itself to my
mind."\[<a href="#foot1" id="text1">1</a>\]

So far, now, as we can control the conditions—bodily, intellectual, and
moral—of our best hours, the ideal world may be truly said to exist for
us in the proportion in which we make it to exist. And to just that
extent, the fluctuation in our sense of the reality of the spiritual
life may be ascribed to removable causes, already considered. But so far
as our sense of the reality of the spiritual life is affected by
limitations inevitably involved in our finiteness, or by fluctuations in
our mental states due to constitutional conditions and connections but
very partially subject to our control, the causes are not removable, but
they are recognizable. And to see that the wavering sense of spiritual
reality is due, not to any lack of realness in the spiritual world, but
only to changing conditions in ourselves, is to be delivered from many
doubts and fears, and to take a long step toward a confident religious
faith. When Kant found that a constant feeling of depression which
attended him had its cause in the abnormal narrowness of his chest, he
could not throw off the physical feeling, but he could keep it from
shadowing his life. So, we need constantly to take account of our
necessary finite limitations and the inevitable fluctuations of our
life, if we are to keep our religious faith clear and strong.

The very fact, that these unremovable causes of the sense of the
unreality of the spiritual life are to be found in our natural
constitution, suggests that it may not be intended that the spiritual
life should always seem to us equally real and commanding. And if we
press the inquiry, Why should this be intended? it seems possible to
suggest but one answer consonant with a genuine religious faith: it must
be needed as a part of our moral and spiritual training. We are brought,
thus, to consider the last of the causes of the seeming unreality of the
spiritual life.
