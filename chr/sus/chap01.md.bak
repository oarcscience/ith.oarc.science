## THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF THE INQUIRY

Our deepest need, always, for any ideal view or for any ideal life, is
faith in the reality of the spiritual, faith in a God who can save us
from being at constant war with ourselves. We all need a God, who can
make rational and consistent our deepest longings, aspirations, and
purposes; who can save us at least from counting as illusions all that
in us which—ourselves being judges—is worthiest and most deserving to
abide;—who can save us from "glorying in having renounced that which no
one has ever any right to renounce."

In all this, religion does not stand alone; it makes common cause with
every ideal interest and aim, of whatever kind. The aesthetic, the
ethical, the philosophical, the scientific, the broadly rational of
every sort, are equally concerned. Our problem is nowhere that narrow
and mistaken one of the so-called "harmony of science and religion," but
rather that more serious question—Have we any justifiable ideals? is
there any standard for men and for life, except a pettily utilitarian
one? When we think our life through to the bottom, when we carry our
thought of the world to the farthest limit possible to our thinking,
shall we then find our best self an illegitimate offspring of pride and
error, standing naked and laid open unto that eye of reason which
pierces all shams? or shall we find that rational judgment itself forced
to own itself to be, in common with all other ideals, the child of faith
in God, and of faith in a spiritual world whose reality we cannot doubt
and continue to think at all? This is the central question of this
little book.

A true theology must face this deepest question, must do something to
answer this deepest need of men. A theology, therefore, that understands
itself cannot be an isolated, esoteric interest of a few. Is it not
rather the great attraction of theology that to it, as the science and
philosophy of religion, are most directly committed the supreme
interests of the race? Is it not even true that one cannot continue in
philosophy to the end, without becoming a theologian? In a very real
sense, thus, it is still possible to think of theology as "queen of the
sciences," never because it seeks authoritatively to lord it anywhere,
but queen because it is able to take account of the entire range of
man's ideals, as no other science—and not even philosophy—has commonly
felt free to do. In this sense, as the old schoolmen declared, theology
finds what philosophy only seeks.

In other words, one must hold it to be the chief business of the
theology of any given age or year or hour, to help to save men from
"evasion of life's proof," to deliver them from shame of their best
selves, to point out the conditions upon which the spiritual life may be
made indubitably real. And the theme of this book thus seems to be
thrust upon the theologian as demanding proof even of his right to be a
worker in theology at all.

A self-respecting theologian, certainly, must always be profoundly and
steadfastly unwilling to be considered the hired advocate of a little
religious coterie, that can forget that the interests it defends are
universal interests and meet universal needs. Is it not involved in the
very conception of a religion, that it demands universal recognition?
and is not this sense, as Lotze has called it, the one respectable root
of fanaticism? How can the theologian, then, forget that he stands—not
for the schoolmen nor for any shibboleths of the schools; not for the
Fathers, nor for any ostracizing dogmas of the Fathers; but for all men
and for their right and call to live the highest life, for room in which
a man may stretch himself in the farthest ranges of his being, for air
to breathe and light to rejoice in?

How can it be, then, that it should be particularly charged against
theology, that it is unreal and binding, rather than real and setting
prisoners free? That such theology, so-called, there has been, I
reluctantly admit. But, nevertheless, theology belies itself, and denies
its very reason for being, if it fails to be real and freeing—and
freeing because it makes the spiritual life indubitably real. Our theme,
thus, lies at the very heart of the theologian's problem, and, at the
same time, at the heart of life. And the theologian may call artist and
poet and moralist and philosopher and scientist, and every common seeker
of truth and goodness and beauty, and all true lovers, to witness that
in this, his quest, he fights their battles all, no less than his own.

"Does God love, and will ye hold that faith against the world?"
