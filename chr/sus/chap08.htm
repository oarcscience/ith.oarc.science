  <h2 align="center">THE PRACTICAL NATURE OF ALL BELIEF</h2>

  <p>But the psychological emphasis upon the influence of the practical interests in all consciousness, and upon the
  whole concrete life of the whole man, not only means—as we have been seeing—that in the knowledge of the spiritual we
  may not ignore these conditions of all knowledge, but also particularly means that we are not to forget the practical
  nature of all belief.</p>

  <p>That I may not simply repeat a line of thought which I have elsewhere given[<a name="text14" href=
  "#foot14">14</a>] let me substitute bodily Professor Bowne&#39;s very clear and suggestive statement upon this point:
  &quot;The sum is this: The mind is not a disinterested logic machine, but a living organism, with manifold interests
  and tendencies. These outline its development, and furnish the driving power. The implicit aim in mental development
  is to recognize these interests, and make room for them, so that each shall have its proper field and object. In this
  way a series of ideals arise in our mental life. As cognitive, we assume that the universe is rational. Many of its
  elements are opaque, and utterly unmanageable by us at present, but we assume spontaneously and unconsciously that at
  the center all is order, and that there all is crystalline and transparent to intelligence. Thus there arises in our
  thought the conception of a system in which all is light, a system whose foundations are laid in harmony, and whose
  structure is rational law, a system every part of which is produced and maintained and illumined by the majestic and
  eternal Reason. But this is only a cognitive ideal, to which experience yields but little support. But we hold fast
  the ideal and set aside the facts which make against it as something not yet comprehended.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But we are moral beings also, and our moral interests must be recognized. Hence arises a moral ideal, which
  we join to the cognitive. The universe must be not only rational, but righteous at its root. Here too we set aside
  the facts which make against our faith as something not yet understood. This is especially the case in dealing with
  the problem of evil. Here we are never content with finding a cause for the good and evil in experience; we insist
  upon an explanation which shall save the assumed goodness at the heart of things.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Finally, we are religious, and our entire nature works together to construct the religious ideal. The
  intellect brings its ideal; and the conscience brings its ideal; and the affections bring their ideal; and these,
  together with whatever other thought of perfection we may have, are united into the thought of the one Perfect Being,
  the ideal of ideals, the supreme and complete, to whom heart, will, conscience, and intellect alike may come and say,
  &#39;Thy Kingdom come; thy will be done.&#39; Here, as in the previous cases, we do not ignore the facts which make
  against the view, but we set them aside as things to be explained, but which must not in any way be allowed to weaken
  our faith.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;All of these ideals are, primarily, alike subjective. They are produced, indeed, under the stress of
  experience, but they are not transcripts of any possible experience. That transparent universe of the reason is as
  purely a mental product as that righteous universe of the conscience, or as the supreme perfection of religion. In
  each of these cases the mind appears with its subjective ideals, and demands that reality shall recognize them; and
  in all alike reality recognizes them only imperfectly. To some extent the universe is intelligible. To some extent
  the power not ourselves makes for righteousness. To some extent God is revealed. But in all these cases a purely
  logical and objective contemplation of the known facts would leave us in great uncertainty. The assured conviction we
  have rests upon no logical deduction from experience, but upon the optimistic assumption that the mind has a right to
  itself, and is at home in the universe. The mind will not consent to abandon its nature and resign itself to utter
  mental and moral confusion. This is, to be sure, an act of pure faith, but it is an act upon which our entire mental
  life depends. A purely speculative knowledge of reality, which shall be strictly deductive and free from assumption,
  is impossible.&quot;[<a name="text15" href="#foot15">15</a>]</p>

  <p>The spiritual life—the religious view—then, let it be clearly seen, makes here no peculiar demand. It stands side
  by side with other ideals, having a like original justification. That it must take account of practical and ideal
  interests is in no way peculiar to it; but of these practical and ideal interests it must take account. Not to do so,
  is to end in hopeless confusion, not in greater clearness.</p>
