  <h2 align="center">THE SPIRITUAL LIFE NOT A LIFE OF EXTERNAL RULES</h2>

  <p>But if we are not to make the mistake of thinking of the spiritual life as a life of magical inheritance, but
  rather as clearly involving laws and conditions, neither are we to make the opposite mistake of conceiving the
  spiritual life as a life of rules laid on from without. Counsels to be heeded there certainly are in the religious
  life, and valuable habits to be formed. Nevertheless, the heart of the life with God can never be contained in any
  prescribed routine of rules and regulations. We are called to a real life, with its own spontaneous growth and varied
  expressions, and we are called to liberty. Christ seems to have been concerned, not to give rules for holy living or
  for holy dying, but to trust all to the dynamic of the single motive of love to his person. His disciples are simply
  asked to be in truth disciples—doing only what loving loyalty to him would suggest. In the liberty of a loyal love,
  freely won and freely given, they are to live out their lives. No rules have any binding authority which this love
  does not inspire; and they have even secondary authority only so long as they are valuable means for that love.</p>

  <p>The very essence of the spiritual life is a personal relation with God. No more than any other personal relation
  can this be wisely made a mere matter of rules. And just as any other personal relation, this relation to God in the
  religious life will lose its spontaneity, its joy, its growth, and its reality, when external rules are made to
  determine all. Even in the development of a personal relation, there are clear laws, as we must later notice; but
  they are the laws of a spontaneously developing life, not external rules laid on from without.</p>

  <p>The spiritual life always suffers, and loses in reality, from an extreme emphasis upon the mechanical rules of
  living, however good the rules in themselves may be. In what is perhaps his most important single address—&quot;The
  Changed Life&quot;—Drummond states incisively the failure of the method of external rules: &quot;All these methods
  that have been named—the self-sufficient method, the self-crucifixion method, the mimetic method, and the diary
  method—are perfectly human, perfectly natural, perfectly ignorant, and, as they stand, perfectly inadequate. Their
  harm is that they distract attention from the true working method, and secure a fair result at the expense of the
  perfect one.&quot; &quot;The solution of the problem of sanctification is compressed into a sentence—Reflect the
  character of Christ and you will become like Christ.&quot;</p>

  <p>Much religious literature, on account of its emphasis on rules of living, has had, thus, particularly in the case
  of the especially conscientious, a positively deadening effect. So much is made of the machinery, that the man ends
  with the feeling that it is all machinery, and he is simply going through the motions of life, instead of having the
  real life itself. This is particularly true, where the rules enjoin much introspection, under which necessarily the
  very form of the inner life changes. Thoughtful and conscientious religious workers, who have made a great deal of
  the organization and machinery of their work, are not unlikely to get a similar paralyzing sense that the results are
  all machine-made. For the sake of the reality of the spiritual life, then, let us not come into bondage to external
  rules. They are, at the very best, means only, absolutely subordinate in significance.</p>

  <p>If now, we definitely set aside in thought and act these four mistaken conceptions of the nature of the spiritual
  life, as a life of strain of imitation, of magical inheritance, and of rules from without, we shall have done
  something to insure its greater reality: and as over against these false conceptions, we shall set the thought of a
  life, normal, real, effective, free. These mistaken conceptions of the nature of the spiritual life themselves
  suggest that perhaps the greatest source of the seeming unreality of the spiritual life is the simple failure to
  fulfil its natural conditions.</p>
