<p align="center">Rev. 16:8-9.</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="1">"And the 'Fourth Angel' poured out his Vial <b>UPON THE SUN</b>; and power was given unto him (the Sun) to <b>scorch men with fire</b>. And men were <b>scorched with GREAT HEAT</b>, and <b>blasphemed the name of God</b>, which hath power over these Plagues; and they repented not to give Him glory."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Under the "Fourth Trumpet" the <b>third part</b> of the Sun was smitten, and the <b>third part</b> of the Moon and of the Stars; so as the <b>third part of them was darkened</b>, and the day shone not for a <b>third part</b> of it, and the night likewise. Rev. 8:12. But it was only the <b>light</b> that was diminished, nothing is said about the <b>heat</b> of the Sun. This "Fourth Vial" is therefore not a recurrence of the "Fourth Trumpet." Here the <b>heat</b> of the Sun is intensified, and so great is the heat that men are <b>scorched</b> by it. How this will be done it is useless to conjecture. It is the time spoken of by Malachi. "Behold, the day cometh that shall <b>BURN AS AN OVEN</b>; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch"; and the time is located as just before the "<b>SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</b>" shall arise with healing in His wings. Mal. 4:1-2. The effect of this Plague will be not to make men repent, but to cause them to <b>blaspheme the name of God</b>. Blessed will those people be who do not live to see that day.</p>
