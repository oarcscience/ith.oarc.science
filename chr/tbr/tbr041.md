### THE ANGEL WARNING.

### ("Three Woes" Announced.)

Rev. 8:13.

"And I beheld, and heard an **ANGEL (R. V. Eagle)** flying through the
midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, **WOE, WOE, WOE,** to the
**inhabiters of the earth** by reason of the other voices of the Trumpet
of the **THREE ANGELS**, which are yet to sound."

The Revised Version, and many Manuscripts substitute "**Eagle**" for
**ANGEL**, but that does not affect the meaning, for if God could make
Balaam's "**ass**" to speak, He can use an "**Eagle**" to announce a
message.
