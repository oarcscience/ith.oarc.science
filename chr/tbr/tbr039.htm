<p>When the "Third Trumpet" sounded a "<b>GREAT STAR</b>" fell from heaven burning like a lamp (R. V. <b>Torch</b>). This will doubt-less be another "Meteor," that will assume the form of a "<b>Torch</b>" in its blazing path through the heavens, and when its gaseous vapors are scattered as it explodes, they will be absorbed by the <b>third part of the rivers and fountains of waters</b>, and they will be <b>poisoned by the noxious gases</b>, and made <b>bitter</b>, and many men shall die from drinking of those waters. "<b>Wormwood</b>" is a perennial herb, very bitter, and is used in the manufacture of "<b>Absinthe</b>." It is much used in France as a beverage, and is more intoxicating and destructive than ordinary liquors. This time is foretold by the Prophet Jeremiah. "Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts, because they have forsaken my law, Behold, I will feed them, even this people (Israel), with <b>WORMWOOD</b>, and give them <b>WATER OF GALL</b> to drink." Jer. 9:13-15.</p>
