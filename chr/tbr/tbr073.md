### FOURTH VIAL.

### (Great Heat.)

Rev. 16:8-9.

"And the 'Fourth Angel' poured out his Vial **UPON THE SUN**; and power
was given unto him (the Sun) to **scorch men with fire**. And men were
**scorched with GREAT HEAT**, and **blasphemed the name of God**, which
hath power over these Plagues; and they repented not to give Him glory."

Under the "Fourth Trumpet" the **third part** of the Sun was smitten,
and the **third part** of the Moon and of the Stars; so as the **third
part of them was darkened**, and the day shone not for a **third part**
of it, and the night likewise. Rev. 8:12. But it was only the **light**
that was diminished, nothing is said about the **heat** of the Sun. This
"Fourth Vial" is therefore not a recurrence of the "Fourth Trumpet."
Here the **heat** of the Sun is intensified, and so great is the heat
that men are **scorched** by it. How this will be done it is useless to
conjecture. It is the time spoken of by Malachi. "Behold, the day cometh
that shall **BURN AS AN OVEN**; and all the proud, yea, and all that do
wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up,
saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor
branch"; and the time is located as just before the "**SUN OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS**" shall arise with healing in His wings. Mal. 4:1-2. The
effect of this Plague will be not to make men repent, but to cause them
to **blaspheme the name of God**. Blessed will those people be who do
not live to see that day.
