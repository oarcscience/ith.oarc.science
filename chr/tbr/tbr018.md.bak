### VII. THE CHURCH AT LAODICEA.

(**A Lukewarm Church**.)

Rev. 3:14-22.

1\. **THE SALUTATION**--"And unto the Angel of the Church of the
Laodiceans write: These things saith the **Amen**, the **Faithful** and
**True Witness**, the beginning of the creation of God.

2\. **THE COMPLAINT**--I know thy **works**, that thou art neither
**hot** nor **cold**: I would thou wert **cold** or **hot**. So then
because thou art **lukewarm**, and neither cold or hot, I will **spue
thee out of my mouth**. Because thou sayest, I am **rich** and
**increased with goods**, and have **need of nothing**, and knowest not
that thou are **wretched**, and **miserable**, and **poor**, and
**blind**, and **naked**.

3\. **THE COUNSEL**--I counsel thee to buy of Me **gold tried in the
fire**, that thou mayest be rich; and **white raiment**, that thou
mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
and **anoint thine eyes with eyesalve**, that thou mayest see.

4\. **THE CHASTENING**--As many as I love, I **rebuke** and **chasten**:
be zealous therefore, and repent.

5\. **THE PROMISE**--Behold I stand at the door, and knock: if **any
man** hear My voice, and **open the door**, I will come in to him, and
will **sup with him**, and **he with me**. To him that overcometh will I
grant to sit with me in **My Throne**, even as I also overcame, and am
set down with My Father in His Throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear
what the Spirit saith unto the Churches."

Christ has no "commendation" for this Church, but much to complain of.
He says--

"I know thy works, that thou art **neither cold or hot**; I would thou
wert **cold** or **hot**. So then, because thou art **lukewarm**, and
neither cold or hot, I will **spue thee out of my mouth**."

There is nothing more disgusting or nauseating than "tepid" water. So
there is nothing more repugnant to Christ than a "tepid" church. He
would rather have a church "frozen" or "boiling." It was the "chilly
spiritual atmosphere" of the Church of England that drove John Wesley to
start those outside meetings which became so noted for their "religious
fervor," and it was the same "chilly atmosphere" of the Methodist Church
that drove William Booth in turn to become a "Red-hot" Salvationist.

Our churches today are largely in this "lukewarm" condition. There is
very little of warm-hearted spirituality. There is much going on in
them, but it is largely mechanical and of a social character.
Committees, societies, and clubs are multiplied, but there is

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

an absence of "spiritual heat." Revival meetings are held, but instead
of waiting on the Lord for power, evangelists and paid singers are hired
and soul winning is made a business. The cause of this "lukewarmness" is
the same as that of the Church of Laodicea--**Self-Deception**.

"Because thou sayest **I am rich**, and **increased with goods**, and
have **need of nothing**; and knowest not that thou **art wretched**,
and **miserable**, and **poor**, and **blind** and **naked**."

They thought they were **rich**, and outwardly they were, but Christ saw
the poverty of their heart. There are many such churches in the world
today. More so than in any other period in the history of the church.
Many of these churches have Cathedral-like buildings, stained glass
windows, eloquent preachers, paid singers, large congregations. Some of
them have large landed interests and are well endowed, and yet they are
poor. Many of the members, if not the majority, are worldly, card
playing, dancing, and theatre going Christians. The poor and the saintly
are not wanted in such churches because their presence is a rebuke.
These churches do not see that they are **wretched**, **miserable**,
**poor**, **blind**, and **naked**.

If we were to visit such churches they would take pride in showing us
the building, they would praise the preaching and singing, they would
boast of the character of their congregations, the exclusiveness of
their membership, and the attractiveness of all their services, but if
we suggested a series of meetings for the "deepening of the **Spiritual
Life**," or the "**conversion of the unsaved**," they would say--"Oh,
no, we do not want such meetings, we have **need of nothing**." The
Church at Laodicea was not burdened with **debt**, but it was burdened
with **WEALTH**.

The trouble with the church today is that it thinks that nothing can be
done without money, and that if we only had the money the world would be
converted in this generation. The world is not to be converted by money,
but by the **Spirit of God**.

The trouble with the Church of Laodicea was that its "Gold" was not of
the right kind, and so it was counseled to buy of the Lord "**gold tried
in the fire**." What kind of gold is that? It is gold that has no
**taint** upon it. Gold that is not **cankered**, or secured by
**fraud**, or the withholding of a just wage. What a description we have
of these Laodicean days in James 5:1-4.

But the Church of Laodicea was not only poor, though rich, it was
**blind**. Or to put it more accurately--"**Near-Sighted**." They could
see their worldly prosperity, but were "**Short-Sighted**" as to
heavenly things, so the Lord counseled them to anoint their eyes with
"**Eye-Salve**." Their merchants dealt in ointments and herbs of a high
degree of healing virtue, but they possessed no salve that would restore
**impaired Spiritual Vision**, only the **Unction of the Holy One**
could do that.

But the Church was not only poor, and blind, it was **naked**. Their
outward garments were doubtless of the finest material and the latest
fashionable cut, but not such as should adorn the person of a Child of
God. So they were counseled to purchase of Christ "**White Raiment**,"

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

in exchange for the "raven black woolen" garments for which the garment
makers of Laodicea were famous.

Then a most startling revelation was made to the Church of Laodicea,
Christ said--

"**Behold, I Stand at the Door and Knock**."

These words are generally quoted as an appeal to sinners, but they are
not, they are addressed to a **Church**, and to a Church in whose midst
Christ had **once stood**, but now found Himself excluded and **standing
outside** knocking for admittance.

This is the most startling thing recorded in the New Testament, that it
is possible for a church to be outwardly prosperous and yet have no
Christ in its midst, and be unconscious of the fact. This is a
description of a **Christless Church**. Oh, the

**EXCLUDED CHRIST**.

Excluded from His own nation, for they **Rejected** Him; excluded from
the world, for it **Crucified** Him; excluded from His Church, for He
stands outside its door **Knocking for Entrance**.

How did Christ come to be outside the Church? He had been **within** it
once or there never would have been a Church. How did He come to leave?
It is clear that they had not **thrust** Him out, for they do not seem
to have missed His presence. They continued to worship Him, to sing His
praises, and engage in all manner of Christian service, yet He had
withdrawn. Why? The reason is summed up in one word--**Worldliness**.

But how is Christ to get back into His Church? Does it require the
unanimous vote or invitation of the membership? No. "If any man hear my
voice, and open the door, I will come in to **him**, and will **sup with
him**, and **he** with **Me**." That is the way to revive a lukewarm
church is for the individual members to open their hearts and let Christ
**re-enter, and thus open the door** for His reappearance.

The character of the Church today is Laodicean, and as the Laodicean
Period is to continue until the Church of the "New-Born" is taken out,
we cannot hope for any great change until the Lord comes back.

What do these "Messages to the Churches" teach us? They clearly teach
the **DECLINE OF THE CHURCH**. That the professing Church instead of
increasing in spiritual and world converting power will become
**lukewarm**, **faithless**, and **CHRISTLESS**.

In Paul's Parable of the "Two Olive Trees" (Rom. 11:15-27), he shows how
the "**natural branches**" of the "Good Olive Tree," (Israel) were
broken off because of **UNBELIEF**, that the "Wild Olive Tree" of the
Church might be "**grafted in**," which in turn, because of
**UNBELIEF**, would be displaced that the "**Natural branches**" might
be "**grafted back again**," thus showing that the Church does not take
the place of Israel permanently, but simply fills up the "Gap" between
Israel's "casting off" and "restoration to Divine favor." As the
Laodicean Period closes the "Church Age," the Church disappears at the
end of Chapter Three, and Israel comes again into view. See the [Chart
