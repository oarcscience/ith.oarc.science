### III. PAUL'S FOREVIEW.

"Let no man deceive you by any means: for '**that Day**' (the Day of the
Lord) shall not come except there come a '**falling away first**,' and
that '**MAN OF SIN**' be revealed. The

'**SON OF PERDITION**,'

who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that
is worshipped; so that he **As God** sitteth in the Temple of God (the
rebuilt Temple at Jerusalem), showing himself that he is God . . . For
the

'**MYSTERY OF INIQUITY**'

doth already work (in Paul's day); only He (the Holy Spirit) who now
letteth (restraineth R. V.) will let (restrain), until He be taken out
of the way. And then shall

'**THAT WICKED**'

**be revealed**, whom the Lord shall consume with the **spirit**
(breath) **of His mouth**, and shall destroy with the **brightness**
(manifestation R. V.) **of His Coming**. Even him, whose coming is after
the **working of Satan** with all **power** and **signs** and **lying
wonders**, and with all **deceivableness of unrighteousness** in them
that perish; because they received not the **love of the truth**
(Christ) that they might be saved." 2. Thess. 2:3-10.

In the American Standard Edition of the Bible the Antichrist is called
the "**MYSTERY OF LAWLESSNESS**" or the "**LAWLESS ONE**." As such he is
not the **cause** of **Lawlessness**, he is the **result** or **fruit**
of it, for he will arise out of the seething cauldron of **Lawlessness**
that is now becoming more pronounced and manifest in the world.

The name that the Apostle Paul gives the Antichrist--the "**SON OF
PERDITION**," is not without significance. The name is used but twice in
the Scriptures. It is first used by Christ of **Judas** (John 17:12),
and then here of **Antichrist**. The Apostle also calls the Antichrist
in this passage the "**MYSTERY OF INIQUITY**." What does that mean? In
1. Tim. 3:16 Christ is spoken of as the "**MYSTERY OF GODLINESS**," that
is, that He was God **MANIFEST IN THE FLESH**. How did He become
"**manifest in the flesh**"? By being born of the Virgin Mary by the
Holy Spirit. Thus it was that Jesus became the **SON OF GOD**. Luke
1:35. Now as **iniquity** is the opposite of **godliness**, then the
"**MYSTERY OF INIQUITY**" must be the opposite of the "**MYSTERY OF
GODLINESS**." That is, if Christ is the "**MYSTERY OF GODLINESS**,"
Antichrist must be the "**MYSTERY OF INIQUITY**," and as Christ was the
"**Son of God**," then Antichrist must be the "**SON OF PERDITION**,"
that is, of **SATAN**. And as Christ was born of a **virgin** by the
Holy Spirit, so Antichrist will be born of a **woman** (not necessarily
a virgin) by Satan. This is no new view for it has been held by many of
God's spiritually minded children since the days of the Apostle John,
and

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

there is some warrant for it in the Scriptures. In Gen. 3:15, God said
to the Serpent (Satan), "I will put enmity between thee and the woman,
and between '**THY SEED**' and '**HER SEED**'." Now the Woman's **SEED**
was **CHRIST**, then the Serpent's **SEED** must be **ANTICHRIST**. In
John 8:44 Jesus said to the Jews--"Ye are of your father **THE DEVIL** .
. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a **liar**,
and the father of **IT**." In the Greek there is the definite article
before "**lie**," and it should read "**THE LIE**," so when the Devil
speaks of "**THE LIE**," he is speaking of **his own** (child), for he
is a liar, and the **FATHER OF "IT"--"THE LIE."** And it is worthy of
note that in the verse (vs. 11) that follows the passage we are
considering that the Apostle says--"And for this cause God shall send
them strong delusion that they should believe **a lie**." Here again the
definite article is found in the Greek, and it should read "**The
LIE**," the "**SON OF PERDITION**," the **ANTICHRIST**.

But why was Judas called the "**SON OF PERDITION**"? Was he a child of
Satan by some woman, or was he simply indwelt by Satan? Here we must let
the Scriptures speak for themselves. In John 6:70-71 we read that Jesus
said "Have not I chosen you Twelve, and one of you is a **DEVIL**? He
spake of **Judas Iscariot** the son of Simon; for he it was that should
betray Him, being one of the Twelve." In no other passage than this is
the word "**Devil**" applied to anyone but to Satan himself. Here the
word is "**diabolus**," the definite article is employed, and it should
read--"and one of you is **THE DEVIL**." This would make Judas the Devil
**incarnate**, or the "**MYSTERY OF INIQUITY**," and explains why Jesus
in John 17:12, calls him the "**SON OF PERDITION**."

This is the only place in the Scriptures where the word "**diabolus**"
is applied to a human being, and it implies an incarnation.

While "**Perdition**" is a **PLACE** (Rev. 17:8, 11), it is also a
"**condition**" into which men may fall (1. Tim. 6:9; Heb. 10:39), and
while men who have committed the "Unpardonable Sin" are "**sons of
perdition**," because they are destined to the place of the irrevocably
lost, yet Judas and Antichrist are the "**SONS OF PERDITION**" in a
special sense, for they are the **SONS** of the author of
"**Perdition**"--**THE DEVIL**. That is they are not merely
"**obsessed**" or controlled by the Devil, the Devil has **incarnated**
himself in them, and for the time being, to all practical purposes, they
are the very Devil himself.

The next question that arises is, "If Judas and the Antichrist are both
called the '**SON OF PERDITION**,' are they one and the same, or are
there **two 'Sons of Perdition'**?" Here we must anticipate. Turning to
Rev. 11:7, we read that the "**Beast**" that slays the "Two Witnesses"
**ascends out of the "Bottomless Pit**" (**ABYSS**), and that
"**Beast**" is the **ANTICHRIST**. Now how did he get into the
"**ABYSS**"? Well, if there is only **one "SON OF PERDITION,"** and
Judas and Antichrist are one and the same, then he got in the **ABYSS**
when Judas went to his "**Own Place**" (the **ABYSS**). Acts 1:25. Of no
other person is it said anywhere in the Scriptures that he went "**to
his own place**." Again in Rev. 17:8 it is said--"The '**Beast**' that
thou sawest **was**, and **is not**: and shall **ascend out of the** 

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

\[paragraph continues\] **'Bottomless Pit'** (Abyss), and go into
**PERDITION**." As this "**Beast**" is the same that slays the "**Two
Witnesses**" he is the **ANTI-CHRIST**. Now there are four things said
of him. First, he "**WAS**." Second, he "**IS NOT**." Third, he shall
"**ASCEND OUT OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT**." Fourth, he shall "**GO INTO
PERDITION**." From this we learn that in John's day the "**Beast**"
"**Was Not**," but that he had been **before on the earth**, and was to
**come again**, that he was to **ASCEND FROM THE BOTTOMLESS PIT**. This
is positive proof that the **ANTICHRIST** has been on the earth
**before**, and that when he comes in the **future** he will come from
the "**ABYSS**."

The question then arises, when was "**Antichrist**" on the earth
**before**? If Judas and Antichrist are one and the same the enigma is
solved. When Judas was on the earth, he **WAS**; when Judas went to his
"**Own Place**" he "**WAS NOT**"; when Judas comes back from the
"**Abyss**" he will be--**THE ANTICHRIST**. The Author does not insist
on this view of Judas and Antichrist being correct, but with open mind
he accepts it, because it seems to be the only logical solution of both
Judas and Antichrist being called the "**SON OF PERDITION**."
