### FIRST VIAL.

### (Boils.)

Rev. 16:1-2.

"And I heard a great voice out of the Temple saying to the 'Seven
Angels,' Go your ways, and pour out the '**VIALS OF THE WRATH OF GOD**'
upon the earth. And the first went, and poured out his **VIAL** upon the
earth: and there fell a **noisome and grievous sore** upon the men which
had the '**MARK OF THE BEAST**,' and upon them which **WORSHIPPED HIS
IMAGE**."

These "**VIALS**" and their **contents** are **LITERAL**. One cannot
imagine that such momentous things as are here described refer to
historical events that are **already past**, as when some interpret the
"First Vial" as the French Revolution in A. D. 1792, and the "**sores**"
its infidelity; and the "Second Vial" as the naval wars of that
Revolution; the "Third Vial" as the battles of Napoleon in Italy, and
the rest of the Vials as historical events that happened in the
Nineteenth Century. If this be true then we have been passing in the
past 125 years through the period of the Great Tribulation without
knowing it, and have been preaching "**Grace**" and not that "**THE HOUR
OF HIS JUDGMENT IS COME**." This is **supposition** and not
**EXPOSITION**, and requires the reader of the Book of Revelation to be
versed in all the historical events of the Christian Era. No, these
"Vial Judgments" are yet **future**, and will be **literally fulfilled**
as here described, and this gives us the "**KEY**" to the
**LITERALNESS** of the whole Book of Revelation. That these "Vial
Judgments" are not figurative is clear from the fact that 4 of the 7
have actually happened before. They are simply repetitions of the
"**PLAGUES OF EGYPT**." See the "[Chart on the](#img_14100.md) " and the
"Egyptian Plagues" compared. This Plague of a "**NOISOME AND GRIEVOUS
SORE**" that shall fall upon men, is a repetition of the "Plague of
Boils" that fell upon the Egyptians at the time of the Exodus. Ex.
9:8-12. The "First Vial Judgment" then will be a repetition of the
"Sixth Egyptian Plague." That that Plague actually happened no believer
in the Bible doubts, then why should we try to explain away the
literalness of the Plagues that shall follow the pouring out of each of
these Vials.

Boils are caused by **bad blood**, and reveal corruption in the system.
These "**grievous sores**" which will come upon **MEN ONLY**, and not
upon the beasts also as in the time of Moses, will not only reveal
corruption in the body, but in the heart of those whose sins will cause
corruption in their bodies. That these "**sores**" are reserved for
those who have the "**MARK OF THE BEAST**," and who worship his
**IMAGE** is further proof that these "Vial Judgments" are still
**future**. Here is the fulfillment of Rev. 14:9-11.

The effect of the Plague of Boils upon the Egyptians was to harden their
hearts, and a like effect will be produced upon the followers of
Antichrist by the Plagues that shall follow the pouring out of the
"**Vials**," for we read in verse 9, that men will blaspheme God, and
refuse to repent. From this we see that suffering alone does not lead to
repentance.
