### I. ISAIAH'S FOREVIEW.

The Prophet Isaiah sees the Antichrist as the "**ASSYRIAN**." Isa. 10:5,
12, 24; 30:27-33. In Isa. 11:4, a chapter which is evidently Messianic,
we read that among other things which the Messiah will do--"He shall
smite the earth with the '**rod of His mouth**,' and with the '**breath
of His lips**' shall He slay '**THE WICKED**'." The

word translated "**THE WICKED**," is in the singular number, and cannot
refer to wicked persons in general, but to some **one person who is
conspicuously wicked**. The expression is strikingly like that of Paul's
in 2. Thess. 2:8. "Then shall that '**WICKED**' be revealed, whom the
Lord shall consume with the '**Spirit of His Mouth**,' and shall destroy
with the '**Brightness of His Coming**'." It is evident that Isaiah and
Paul refer to the same individual, who can be no other than the
Antichrist.

In Isa. 14:4-17 there is a description of a "**King of Babylon**" who
shall smite the people in his wrath, and rule the nations in anger. He
is called "**LUCIFER, Son of the Morning**," and his fall is described.
He is cast down to Hell (Sheol, the Underworld), where his coming
creates a great stir among the kings of the earth that have preceded
him, and who exclaim when they see him--"Art thou .also become weak as
we? Art thou become like unto us? . . . Is this the man that made the
earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; that made the world as a
wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house
of his prisoners?" There has never as yet been such a King of Babylon as
is here described. It must therefore refer to some future King of
Babylon, when Babylon shall be rebuilt, as we shall see it is to be.
Verses 12 to 14 evidently refer to Satan, and are descriptive of him
before his fall, but as he is to incarnate himself in the Antichrist,
who is to be a future King of Babylon, it explains the source of the
pride and presumption of Antichrist, which will lead to his downfall, as
it did to Satan's.
