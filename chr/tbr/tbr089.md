### 4. SATAN LOOSED.

Rev. 20:7-8.

"And when the Thousand Years are expired, Satan shall be **loosed out of
his prison**, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the
four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to
battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. And they went up
on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the 'Camp of the Saints'
about, and the Beloved City (Jerusalem): and **fire came down from God
out of heaven, and devoured them**."

As the evening shadows of the Millennial Day fall, the Angel who
imprisoned Satan will unlock the "prison house" of the "Bottomless Pit,"
and Satan will come forth embittered by his forced confinement to vent
his anger upon the people of God, a refutation of the claim that the
miseries of perdition will lead to repentance. Satan will still be the
same malignant being after his 1000 years of confinement that he was
before. His hatred against God and His people will be unquenched.
