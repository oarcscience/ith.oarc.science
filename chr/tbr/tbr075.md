### SIXTH VIAL.

### (The Euphrates Dried Up.)

Rev. 16:12.

"And the 'Sixth Angel' poured out his Vial upon the **GREAT RIVER
EUPHRATES**; and the water thereof was **DRIED UP**, that the way of the
'**Kings of the East**' might be prepared."

This means the literal river Euphrates. The other Plagues will be real,
and why does not this mean the drying up of the real Euphrates River.
The opening up of a dry passage through the Red Sea that the Children of
Israel might escape from Egypt, and the parting of the waters of the
River Jordan that they might pass over into the Land of Canaan, are
facts of history, why then shall not the River Euphrates be dried up
that the Kings of the East and their armies may cross over and assemble
for the Battle of Armageddon? The prophecy in Isa. 11:15-16, where "the
Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian Sea (Red Sea), and
. . . shake His hand over the River (Euphrates) and smite its seven
streams, so men can go over '**DRY SHOD**'," refers to this time. The
Kings shall journey East from Africa, and West from Asia that they may
meet in Palestine for the "Battle of Armageddon." The drying up of the
Euphrates will serve a twofold purpose. It will permit the remnant of
Israel from Assyria to return, and also allow the nations of the far
East to be gathered for the "Judgment of Nations." Matt. 25:31-46.
