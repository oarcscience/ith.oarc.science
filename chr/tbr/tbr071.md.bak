### SECOND VIAL.

### (Blood On the Sea.)

Rev. 16:3.

"And the 'Second Angel' poured out his Vial **upon the sea**: and it
became **as the blood of a dead man**: and **every living soul died in
the sea**."

We saw that at the sounding of the "Second Trumpet," that the **third
part** of the sea became blood, and the third part of the creatures
which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the
ships were destroyed. Rev. 8:8-9. Here the whole of the sea is affected.
This may mean only the Sea of Galilee, or the Mediterranean Sea, and not
the oceans of the earth. It does not follow that this blood is that of
men. It may be only of the living creatures that are in the sea. The
Revised Version translates (in the margin) the word "**soul**" as the
"**soul of life**," and we know that the word "**soul**" implies "**self
conscious life**," and this is common to all animal life. The blood is
certainly not the blood of sailors and marines caused by some great
naval battle. The inference is that the creatures in the sea died, not
because of the loss of their own blood, but because the waters of the
sea became "**AS the blood of a dead man**"--that is, corrupt.
