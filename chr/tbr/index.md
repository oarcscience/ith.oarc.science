------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Rev. Clarence Larkin's guide to the Book of Revelation.
Larkin, who published several books about biblical studies in the 1910s
and 20s, was a 'Dispensationalist,' one of the threads of modern
Evangelical Christianity. The predecessor of Larkin is J.N. Darby, the
founder of Dispensationalism, and among his many successors are [Hal
Lindsay](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/031027771X/internetsacredte),
and the [Left
Behind](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0842329129/internetsacredte)
books.

Unlike more recent authors, however, Larkin does not make any claims to
know when or exactly how the prophecies will unfold. Rather he takes us
on a grand tour of the Apocalypse of St. John, and guides us through its
images, symbols and poetry. Larkin sorts out what could be a reference
to an actual event or person, (without attempting any particular
association) and what is pure symbolism. Larkin uses bold type
extensively for emphasis, as well as some superb 'visual aids' in the
form of intricate charts and maps.

Contrasted with other prophetic books such as
[Nostradamus](../../nos/index) and the [Sibylline
Oracles](../../cla/sib/index), Revelation has a consistent narrative
with a beginning, middle and end. It is also one of the essential sacred
texts and required reading for anyone interested in religion. This book
will be a welcome reference for anyone studying or trying to explain
Revelation, whether or not they are Dispensationalists.
