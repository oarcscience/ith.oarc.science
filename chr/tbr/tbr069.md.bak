### THE TABERNACLE OF TESTIMONY.

Rev. 15:5-8.

"And after that I looked, and behold, the Temple of the '**TABERNACLE OF
TESTIMONY**' in Heaven was opened: and the 'Seven Angels' came out of
the Temple, having the '**SEVEN PLAGUES**,' clothed in pure and white
linen, and having their breasts girded with Golden Girdles. And one of
the 'Four Beasts' gave unto the 'Seven Angels' '**SEVEN GOLDEN VIALS**'
full of the '**WRATH OF GOD**,' who liveth for ever and ever. And the
Temple was filled with smoke from the Glory of God, and from His Power:
and no man was able to enter into the Temple, till the '**SEVEN
PLAGUES**' of the 'Seven Angels' were fulfilled."

Here again we see the Heavenly Temple. The "Seven Angels" that come out
of it are clothed in priestly garments, and the "Golden Vials" that they
carry were given them by one of the "Beasts" or Living Creatures, which
one is not mentioned, and when he gave them to them the Heavenly Temple
was filled with **smoke**. When the Tabernacle was finished by Moses,
and the Temple by Solomon, there was a "**cloud**," the "Shekinah
Glory," but **no smoke**. Ex. 40:34-36. 1. Kings 8:10-11. The
"**cloud**" means **GRACE**, the "**smoke**" means **JUDGMENT**. Isa.
6:14. Ex. 19:18.
