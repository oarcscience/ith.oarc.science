### 6. THE NEW TREE OF LIFE.

Rev. 22:2.

"In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the River. was
there the '**TREE OF LIFE**,' which bare **twelve manner of fruits**,
and yielded her fruit **every month**: and the **leaves of the Tree**
were for the **healing of the nations**."

The streets are to be lined with trees, as are also the banks of a
wonderful river. These trees are not mere shade trees, but beautiful
**Fruit Trees**, called the "**TREE OF LIFE**," that bear **Twelve Kinds
of Fruit**, a different kind each month. The fruit of these trees is for
**Overcomers Only**.

"To him that **overcometh** will I give to eat of the '**Tree of Life**'
which is in the midst of the Paradise of God." Rev. 2:7.

The leaves of the trees are for the **Healing of the Nations that shall
occupy the New Earth**. Not that there will be any sickness, but to
preserve them in health, as Adam would have been preserved in health if
he had eaten of the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden. Gen. 3:22-24.
