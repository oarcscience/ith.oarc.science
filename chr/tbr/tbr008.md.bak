# The Announcement

"Behold, He cometh with clouds; and **every eye shall SEE HIM**, and
they also which **PIERCED HIM**: and all kindreds of the earth shall
wail because of Him. Even so, Amen."  
                                                 Rev. 1:7.

This refers to the Second Stage of Christ's Coming, the "Revelation" or
"Appearing." The First Stage of His Coming, the "Rapture," is not
mentioned in the Book. This will fulfil Zech. 12:10, "They (the Jews)
shall look upon **Me** (Jesus) whom they have **PIERCED**." This is
confirmatory of the view that the Book of Revelation deals mainly with
the events that follow **after** the "Rapture" and **precede** and
**attend** the "Revelation" or the coming **to the earth** of the
**Lord**.

It is difficult to imagine the grief and remorse that will fill the
hearts of those Jews who shall witness the return of the Lord to the
Mount of Olives, when they shall see in His hands and feet the "**PRINT
OF THE NAILS**," and He shall be revealed as the One they crucified.
Like Thomas they will cry, "**MY LORD AND MY GOD**." John 20:24-29. The
Prophet Zechariah (Zech. 12:9-14) describes it as a time of great
"**BITTERNESS**" and a day of great mourning in Jerusalem, when families
will separate themselves from their neighbors and mourn every family
apart. And not only shall the Jews mourn because they rejected Him when
He came the first time, but the nations of the earth will **WAIL** when
they realize that He has come back, not as a Saviour, but a Judge to
punish them for their iniquities.
