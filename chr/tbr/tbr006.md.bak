# The Book of Revelation

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### THE TITLE.

"THE REVELATION OF

### Jesus Christ,

WHICH GOD GAVE UNTO HIM, TO SHOW UNTO HIS  
SERVANTS THINGS WHICH MUST SHORTLY  
COME TO PASS;  
AND HE SENT AND SIGNIFIED IT BY HIS  
ANGEL UNTO HIS SERVANT

### John:

WHO BARE RECORD OF THE WORD OF GOD,  
AND OF THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS CHRIST,  
AND OF ALL THINGS THAT HE SAW.

### THE BLESSING.

BLESSED IS HE THAT '**READETH**,'  
AND THEY THAT '**HEAR**' THE WORDS OF THIS  
PROPHECY, AND '**KEEP**' THOSE THINGS WHICH  
ARE WRITTEN THEREIN:

### FOR THE TIME IS AT HAND."

**Rev. 1:1-3**.

The "Title" of the Book describes its character. It is not "The
Revelation of St. John the Divine," as the heading in our Bibles would
have us believe, but it is

"**THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST**."

The word "Revelation" in the Greek is "**APOCALUPSIS**." Hence the title
"**THE APOCALYPSE**," by which it is often called. It is from the verb
"**APOCALUPTO**," to unveil; from "**APO**," **away from**; and
"**KALUMMA**," a **veil**. Hence "Apocalupsis" means a taking away of a
veil, as when a statue is unveiled, that what is behind the veil may be
seen. It is not so much a revelation or unveiling of the Person of
Christ, though it discloses His High Priestly and Kingly glory, as it is
the unveiling of those events that shall precede and accompany His
return to the earth. This is seen from the fact that what is revealed in
the Book, was given unto Jesus Christ, by God the Father, to show unto
His Servants the "**things which must shortly come to pass**."

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

When Jesus was asked just before His death, when the things that He had
prophesied against Jerusalem should come to pass (Mark 13:1-31), He
replied in verse 32, "But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no,
not the angels which are in Heaven, **neither (NOT YET) the Son, but the
FATHER**." But after His Ascension He received from the Father the
information that the Disciples asked for, and before the close of the
first century, while at least one of those Disciples was still living,
the beloved John, He sent an angel messenger to impart to him, and
through him to the Churches, the information that is "unveiled" in this
Book of Revelation. Thus we see that the canon of Scripture would be
incomplete without this message from Jesus to His Church after His
return to Heaven.

While the Apostle John is the writer of the Book he is not the author or
composer. The Author was the Lord Jesus Himself. The Apostle was only a
"scribe" or "amanuensis." Twice he declares that the contents of the
Book were revealed to him by an angel. Rev. 1:1; 22:8. The fact that the
style of the Book differs so strikingly from the other writings of John,
as the Gospel and Epistles, is the strongest kind of evidence that John
did not compose the Book, but that it was dictated or visualized to him.
In its subject matter, and in the majesty and sublimity of its language,
which is in harmony with its contents, the Book of Revelation differs
from all other books, and is incomparably above them, thus revealing its
Divine Authorship. In fact it is the only portion of the New Testament
to which Jesus gives His **endorsement**, and affixes His **signature**,
saying at its close--"**I JESUS** have sent **Mine Ange**l to testify
unto you these things in the Churches." Rev. 22:16.

The Book of Revelation then is not a compilation of Jewish "Apocalyptic
Literature," intermixed with "Heathen Visions Christianized," thus being
a "**patchwork**" of Jewish and Heathen Folklore, but it is the
Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him, to show unto His
servants things which must shortly come to pass. This He sent by **His
ANGEL**. Who this Angel was we are not told, but when John fell down to
worship him, he said, "See thou do it not: for I am thy
**fellowservant**, and of **thy brethren the prophets**, and of **them
which keep the sayings of this book**." Rev. 22:8-9. He must therefore
have been one of the old prophets raised for the purpose.

The Book is a **PROPHETIC** Book. It is not a history. It does not
record the past, but **reveals the future**. It makes this claim in the
Title--"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of
**THIS PROPHECY**," Rev. 1:3; and four times in the concluding chapter.
Rev. 22:7, 10, 18, 19. It is the summing up and consummation of all
prophecy. In it all unfulfilled prophecy is fulfilled. It is the
"**finality**" in prophecy until Jesus comes back. There has been no
"new revelation" since it was written; and all those who claim to have
received **new** and **later** "**revelations**" are impostors and false
prophets. There is no place for "**additions**" or "subtractions" in the
Book. It opens with a "**blessing**" promised the reader. and ends with
a "**curse**" upon those who "**ADD UNTO**" or "**TAKE FROM**" it. Rev.
1:3; 22:18-19.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

Nothing is said about **understanding** the Book, but blessed is he that
"**readeth**," or if too illiterate to read, blessed are they that
"**hear**," that is, listen to its reading. The reference here is
doubtless to the "reader" and "hearers" of the Scripture as read in the
Synagogue in the Apostle's day. That the Book should be shunned by many
because of its mysterious character is no wonder. It is one of the
"devices" of Satan to get people to neglect a Book that foretells his
casting as "Prince of the Powers of the Air," and the "God of This Age,"
out of the Heavenlies; of his imprisonment in the "Bottomless Pit" for
1000 years; and his final casting into the Lake of Fire. While Satan
hates all Scripture in general, he hates the books of Genesis and
Revelation in particular. Therefore he attacks the authenticity of
Genesis, and seeks to have Revelation neglected.

The Book is not only a "**Prophetic**" book, it is a "**SYMBOLIC**"
book, that is, it is written largely in "**symbolic**" language, that is
the meaning of the statement in the Title--"He sent and '**SIGNIFIED**'
it by His Angel unto His Servant John." The word "**signified**" means
given in "**signs**" and "**symbols**" and should be pronounced
"**SIGN´-IFIED**." There are more "signs" and "symbols" in the Book of
Revelation than in any other book in the Bible, but they are either
explained there or in some other part of the Scriptures. No one can
understand the Book of Revelation who does not understand the Book of
Daniel. The Prophet Daniel was told to "seal up" the words of his
prophecy until the "Time of the End," not the "end of time," but the end
of the "Times of the Gentiles." Dan. 12:4, 9. But the writer of the Book
of Revelation was told to "**seal NOT**" the sayings of the Book, for
the **TIME IS AT HAND**. Rev. 22:10.

The symbolism of the Book of Revelation shows that it was written for a
"**special class**," for those who are acquainted with the "Word of
God," and who have "**spiritual discernment**," and not for the carnally
minded reader. "The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but
those things which are **REVEALED** belong unto us and our children
forever." Deu. 29:29. The Book of Revelation was written to reveal or
disclose the purpose of God as to the earth and the nations, and we are
not prying into God's secrets when we read and study it. It being the
last prophecy, we naturally would expect it to sum up all previous
prophecy, and as all previous prophecy had to do with the **CHURCH**,
**ISRAEL**, and **THE NATIONS**, so we should expect this last prophecy
to give us the final word as to them; and that is what it does. We find
the **CHURCH** in the **beginning**, **ISRAEL** in the **middle**, and
the saved **NATIONS** at the **end**. These three are also seen in the
construction of the Holy City, New Jerusalem; where we have the
**CHURCH** in the **Foundation**, represented by the names of the Twelve
Apostles, and **ISRAEL** in the **Gates**, with the names of the Twelve
Tribes of Israel written over them, and the saved **NATIONS** in the
**Streets**, where they walk in the light of the City's Glory.

The Book is largely Jewish. This is seen in its "signs" and symbols,
such as the Tabernacle, the Ark, the Altar, the Trumpets and Plagues,
and the sealing of the 144,000 of Israel. It is Jewish because

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

\[paragraph continues\] God in it, after the Church is taken out, deals
again with Israel, and in chapters 6 to 19 inclusive He reveals what
shall take place during the last or "Seventieth Week" of Daniel's
"Seventy Weeks."

It is the Book of "**CONSUMMATION**" and its proper place in the sacred
canon is where it is placed, at the end of the Bible. The Book is full
of **ACTION**. Earth and heaven are brought near together. The clouds
roll away, thrones, elders, and angelic forms are seen; harps, trumpets,
cries from disembodied souls and choruses of song are heard. Earth
touches heaven, and alas it touches hell also. Good and evil meet. There
is no blending, but sharp contrasts, and a long protracted conflict that
ends in **victory for the good**, and the "**BEAST**," the "**FALSE
PROPHET**," **SATAN** and his hosts, and "**DEATH**" and **HADES** find
their place in the "**Lake of Fire**." It describes the **culmination**
of the evils foreseen and described in 1. Tim. 4:1; 2 Tim. 3:1-5; 2 Pet.
2:1-2; Jude 14-19, and declares the **CONSUMMATION** of that which the
Prophets foretold, the creation of a

**NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH**

in which righteousness shall dwell. Isa. 65:17. At last the patience of
the patriarchs and saints is rewarded; the longings of faith, and the
hope of Israel and the Church fulfilled, and the glory of God shines
unhindered on a scene of righteousness and peace. The Bible begins with
Paradise **LOST**, and closes with Paradise **REGAINED**.
