### The Great Abdication

The "**Millennial Age**" and the "**Perfect Age**," between which the
Earth is Renovated by Fire, make up the "**Age of Ages**," which period
is called the **KINGDOM OF THE SON OF MAN**.

At the close of the "Age of Ages" when Christ "shall have put down all
rule and all authority and power, for He must reign till He hath put all
enemies under his feet," then Christ as the Son of

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Man, shall surrender the Kingdom to God, that
God may be **ALL IN ALL**. 1 Cor. 15:24-28. This is known as **The Great
Abdication**.

There have been many abdications of thrones in the world's history, but
none like this. Thrones have been abdicated for various reasons. Some
have been forced, others voluntary. Some on account of physical
infirmity, or to secure some particular successor. But Christ will not
abdicate for any of these reasons. He will abdicate because He has
**Finished the Work That Was Given Him to Do as the Son of Man**. He
will not surrender His **Human Nature**, but His title "**Son of Man**"
will merge back into that of "**Son of God**" so that the Divine
**Godhead** shall thereafter act in its **Unity**, and God shall be
"**ALL IN ALL**."
