### THIRD TRUMPET.

### (The Star Wormwood.)

Rev. 8:10-11.

"And the **THIRD ANGEL** sounded, and there fell a '**GREAT STAR**' from
heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the **third part of
the rivers**, and upon the **fountains of waters**; and the name of the
'**Star**' is '**WORMWOOD**': and the third part of the waters (rivers)
became **WORMWOOD**; and many men died of the waters, because they were
made **bitter**."

When the "Third Trumpet" sounded a "**GREAT STAR**" fell from heaven
burning like a lamp (R. V. **Torch**). This will doubt-less be another
"Meteor," that will assume the form of a "**Torch**" in its blazing path
through the heavens, and when its gaseous vapors are scattered as it
explodes, they will be absorbed by the **third part of the rivers and
fountains of waters**, and they will be **poisoned by the noxious
gases**, and made **bitter**, and many men shall die from drinking of
those waters. "**Wormwood**" is a perennial herb, very bitter, and is
used in the manufacture of "**Absinthe**." It is much used in France as
a beverage, and is more intoxicating and destructive than ordinary
liquors. This time is foretold by the Prophet Jeremiah. "Therefore thus
saith the Lord of Hosts, because they have forsaken my law, Behold, I
will feed them, even this people (Israel), with **WORMWOOD**, and give
them **WATER OF GALL** to drink." Jer. 9:13-15.
