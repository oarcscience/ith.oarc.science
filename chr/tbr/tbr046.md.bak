### 2. THE TWO WITNESSES.

Rev. 11:1-14.

"And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the '**ANGEL**'
stood, saying, Rise and measure the '**TEMPLE OF GOD**,' and the
'**ALTAR**,' and them that worship therein. But the '**COURT**' which is
without the **TEMPLE** leave out; and measure it not; for it is given
unto the **GENTILES**: and the Holy City shall they tread under foot
**FORTY AND TWO MONTHS**. And I will give power unto **MY 'TWO
WITNESSES,'** and they shall prophesy a **THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND
THREE-SCORE DAYS**, clothed in sackcloth. These are the '**TWO OLIVE
TREES**' and the '**TWO CANDLESTICKS**' standing before the God of the
earth. And if any man will hurt them, **fire proceedeth out of their
mouth, and devoureth their enemies**: and if any man will hurt them, he
must in this manner be killed. These have power to **SHUT HEAVEN**, that
it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to
**TURN THEM TO BLOOD**, and to smite the earth with **ALL PLAGUES**, as
often as they will. And when they shall have finished their testimony,
the **BEAST THAT ASCENDETH OUT OF THE '[BOTTOMLESS](errata.htm#2.md) PIT'**
shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. And
their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the '**GREAT CITY**,' which
spiritually is called **SODOM** and **EGYPT**, where also our Lord **WAS
CRUCIFIED**. And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations
shall see their dead bodies **THREE DAYS AND A HALF**, and shall not
suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon
the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts
one to another; because these **TWO PROPHETS** tormented them that dwelt
on the earth. And after **three days and a half** the **SPIRIT OF LIFE**
from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great
fear fell upon them which saw them. And they heard a great voice from
Heaven saying unto them '**COME UP HITHER**,' and they ascended up to
Heaven **in a cloud**; and their enemies beheld them. And the **same
hour** was there a **GREAT EARTHQUAKE**, and the **tenth part of the
City fell**, and in the earthquake were slain of men **seven thousand**:
and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of Heaven."

The "**ANGEL**" that told John to rise and measure the **TEMPLE** was
the same "**MIGHTY ANGEL**" that handed him the "**LITTLE BOOK**" to
eat. And as they were both still on the earth, the "**TEMPLE**" that
John was told to measure was the Temple at Jerusalem. Not the Temple of
Herod, for that had been destroyed over 25 years before by Titus, in A.
D. 70. This then must be a **future temple** that is to be built at
Jerusalem. It is clear that there will be a Temple at Jerusalem during
the reign of Antichrist, for he shall **sit in it**, and proclaim
himself **GOD**. 2. Thess. 2:3-4. And he shall cause the "**ABOMINATION
OF DESOLATION**" spoken of by Daniel the Prophet (Dan. 9:27), probably
the "**IMAGE OF THE BEAST**," to be set up in the "**HOLY PLACE**."
Matt. 24:15. This will not be the Millennial Temple described by Ezekiel
(Ez. 4:1; 42:20), for that will be built at Shiloh, in the midst of the
Holy Oblation (Ez. 48:8, 21), and not until after the physical changes
that will take place at the return of Christ (Zech. 14:4) shall have
changed the surface of the Land of Palestine. The Temple

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

that the Jews will build on their return to Jerusalem will probably be
destroyed by the Earthquake that destroys the **tenth part** of the
City, for that Earthquake will synchronize with the "Great Earthquake"
that shall occur at the breaking of the "Seventh Seal," the sounding of
the "Seventh Trumpet," and the pouring out of the "Seventh Vial." Rev.
8:5, 11:19, 16:18.

John was told to measure only the Temple proper, and to leave out the
"Court" that surrounded it. The Temple of Herod had four Courts: the
Court of the Priests, the Court of Israel, the Court of the Women, and
the Court of the Gentiles. The Tabernacle had but one Court; while
Solomon's Temple had **two**, the Court of the Priests, and the Court of
the Gentiles. As the "Court" of this new Temple, as well as the Holy
City (Jerusalem), is to be trodden under foot of the Gentiles for 42
months, or 3½ years, this period must refer to the **last half** of the
"Seventieth Week," after Antichrist breaks his "Covenant" with the Jews,
and desecrates the Temple, for Jerusalem must be trodden down of the
Gentiles until the "Times of the Gentiles" is fulfilled (Luke 21:24),
and that will not end until the Battle of Armageddon.

After the "**MIGHTY ANGEL**" had given John instructions as to measuring
the Temple, He said--"And I will give power unto **MY 'TWO WITNESSES,'**
and they shall prophesy a '**thousand two hundred and threescore
days**'." As a "**thousand two hundred and threescore days**" are equal
to **42 months** of **30 days each**, or to **3½ years**, then the time
when these "**TWO WITNESSES**" are to prophesy must correspond with the
**last half** of the "**Week**," or the time of **THE GREAT
TRIBULATION**.

Who are these "**TWO WITNESSES**"? They are **men**: not systems, or
churches, or a body of witnesses, for they **prophesy** and are
**clothed in sackcloth**, neither of which can be said of other than
**persons**, and there are **TWO** of them. It is very easy to identify
them. They have power to **shut heaven that it rain not in the DAYS OF
THEIR PROPHECY**. This can refer to no other than Elijah, who had power
in the days of King Ahab to shut up the heavens for the space of three
years and six months (1. Kings 17:1. Luke 4:25. James 5:17), and this is
the same length of time, 42 months, or 1260 days, or 3½ years, that
these "**TWO WITNESSES**" are to prophesy. Then we know that Elijah was
translated, and did not see death, that he might come back before "**THE
GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD**" for the purpose of "turning the
heart of the children to their fathers," and this is the purpose of the
prophesying of these "**TWO WITNESSES**." Mal. 4:5-6. It is clear from
the time that the Prophet Malachi said that Elijah would come again,
**JUST BEFORE "The Great And Dreadful Day Of The Lord,"** that this
prophecy was not fulfilled in John the Baptist. He announced the "First
Coming" of Christ, but no "**Great And Dreadful Day Of The Lord**"
followed. That event is yet future, and follows the testimony of these
"**TWO WITNESSES**."

When the Jews sent Priests and Levites from Jerusalem to John to ask him
"**Who Art Thou?**" he confessed--"**I AM NOT THE CHRIST.**" And they
asked him, "What then? Art thou **ELIJAH**?"

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

And he said--"**I AM NOT**." It is clear from John's answers to these
questions that he was **NOT ELIJAH**. When Gabriel announced to
Zacharias the birth of John the Baptist, he said, he shall go before Him
(Christ) in the "**SPIRIT AND POWER**" of Elijah. That is, he will not
be Elijah, but shall be like him in **spirit** and **power**. When John
from his prison cell sent messengers to Jesus to ask Him if He were the
Christ, after Christ had dismissed those messengers He said to the
multitude of John, "**IF YE WILL RECEIVE 'IT,' THIS IS ELIJAH WHICH WAS
FOR TO COME**." Matt. 11:1-14. Jesus here simply affirms that John was
**ELIJAH** if men would **RECEIVE "IT."** Not receive "**HIM**" (John),
but receive "**IT**." What did Jesus mean by "**IT**"? The context shows
that Jesus was talking about the "**KINGDOM**" (Verses 11 and 12), and
if they had received "**THE KINGDOM**" that John announced was **at
hand**, then John, instead of being John, would have been **ELIJAH**
come back, but because God foresaw that the Jews would not receive the
**KINGDOM**, He could not send **ELIJAH at that time**, so He had to
send a substitute with the "**spirit**" and "**power**" of Elijah in his
place, so He sent John the Baptist.

But you say, did not Jesus say to the Disciples when they were coming
down from the Mt. of Transfiguration, where they had seen Elijah--"Elias
truly shall first come, and restore all things. But I say unto you that
**ELIAS IS COME ALREADY**, and they knew him not, but have done unto him
whatsoever they listed. Then the Disciples understood that He spake unto
them of **JOHN THE BAPTIST**"? Matt. 17:11-13. Now whatever this may
mean, it cannot contradict John's own declaration that he **WAS NOT
ELIJAH**, or Christ's statement that if God had **foreseen** that the
Jews would have received the Kingdom, He would have sent **ELIJAH**
instead of John. And Christ's statement in the above reference, that
Elijah's purpose in coming is to "**RESTORE ALL THINGS**," which John
did not do, and Malachi's declaration that Elijah would not come **until
just before the 'GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD,'** makes it clear
that John the Baptist was not Elijah, and that Elijah is yet to come.

It is clear then that one of the "**TWO WITNESSES**" will be Elijah, but
who will be the other? Many claim that Moses will be the second Witness,
while some say he will be Enoch, because they say Moses being a
resurrected person cannot die again, and the "Two Witnesses" are both to
die. They claim that both Enoch and Elijah were caught up in their
bodies, **without dying**, that they might come back again in their
bodies and **die**. There is no scriptural ground for declaring that
Moses cannot die again. Lazarus was raised from the dead and he died
again, and the "Wicked Dead" shall be raised from the dead, and after
Judgment at the "Great White Throne," they shall be sentenced to **die
again**, which is the "**SECOND DEATH**." Rev. 20:12-15.

It is said of these "**TWO WITNESSES**" that they have power--

1\. "To **SHUT HEAVEN**, that it **RAIN NOT** in the days of their
prophecy."

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

2\. "And have power over **WATERS** to **TURN THEM TO BLOOD**, and to
smite the earth with **ALL PLAGUES**, as often as they will."

Now we know that Moses had power to turn water into **BLOOD**, and to
smite the earth with **PLAGUES**, but we are not told that Enoch had
such power.

If we study carefully what shall happen during the period the "**TWO
WITNESSES**" shall testify, which as we have seen will be the last half
of the "Week," or 3½ years, we shall see that the "**TWO WITNESSES**"
can be no other than **MOSES** and **ELIJAH**. It is probable that
Elijah will shut up the heavens that there shall be no rain, during the
3½ years of their witnessing, for we read that there is to be a "**FIRE
TEST**" such as Elijah appointed on Mt. Carmel in the days of King Ahab
(1. Kings 18:17-40), and the con-test will be between Elijah and the
"**FALSE PROPHET**," and that the "**FALSE PROPHET**" shall have power
to do what the Priests of Baal could not do, bring **FIRE FROM HEAVEN**.
Rev. 13:13. The crucial question on Mt. Carmel was, who is **GOD**,
**JEHOVAH** or **BAAL**? In the days of Antichrist it will be, who is
**GOD**, **JEHOVAH** or **ANTICHRIST**? The test will be the power to
bring down **FIRE FROM HEAVEN**. As the "False Prophet" will imitate the
power of Elijah and bring down **FIRE FROM HEAVEN**, the test will not
be decisive. The true Israel of God however will acknowledge the claim
of Jehovah, while the followers of "The Beast" will continue to believe
in him. But Elijah shall not be as fortunate as he was in the days of
Ahab, for then he escaped the vengeance of Jezebel, but he will not be
able to escape the vengeance of Antichrist who will see to it that both
he and Moses are slain.

As the Plagues that are to accompany the pouring out of the "Vials," are
**four** of them similar to the "Plagues of Egypt," who more likely to
bring them to pass than Moses? The evidence seems conclusive that the
"**TWO WITNESSES**" will be **MOSES** and **ELIJAH**.

In passing it is worth noting the "**TITLE**" of these two men. The
"**MIGHTY ANGEL**" (Christ) calls them My "**TWO WITNESSES**." This
implies that "**WITNESSING**" was their **business**. And when we recall
their **witnessing** on the Mt. of Transfiguration (Matt. 17:3), and
that it was **TWO MEN** that **witnessed** to the women at the Tomb that
Jesus had risen (Luke 24:4-7), and that it was **TWO MEN** who stood by
and **witnessed** to the Disciples as Jesus ascended into Heaven (Acts
1:10-11), and that in all three incidents the **MEN** were clothed in
"**shining garments**," it seems clear that Moses was resurrected and
Elijah translated for the express office of "**WITNESSES**."

These "**TWO WITNESSES**" are called the "**TWO OLIVE TREES**" and the
"**TWO CANDLESTICKS**" which stand before the God of the earth. For an
explanation of this symbol we must turn back to the Old Testament. The
Prophet Zechariah saw in a vision a "**GOLDEN CANDLESTICK**," with a
bowl upon the top of it, and the seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to
the seven lamps; and **TWO OLIVE TREES** by it, one upon the right side
of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. And he turned

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

to the angel that talked with him and said "What are these '**TWO OLIVE
TREES**' upon the right side of the **CANDLESTICK** and upon the left
side thereof?" And he said, "These are the '**TWO ANOINTED ONES**,' that
stand by the Lord of the whole earth." Zech. 4:1-14. These "**TWO
ANOINTED ONES**" were Zerubbabel the Governor, and Joshua the High
Priest. Haggai 1:1, 14. Zech. 3:1; 4:6. They had been anointed by the
Holy Spirit to rebuild and restore Jerusalem and the Temple after the
Babylonian Captivity, against which Satan was raising up much
opposition. Zech. 3:1-7. What more appropriate type could have been used
than this? Zerubbabel and Joshua are types of the "**TWO WITNESSES**"
whose work it will be to proclaim that the time has come to rebuild
Jerusalem and re-establish the Temple worship, for the "**KINGDOM OF
HEAVEN**" is at hand. And they will have to do it in the face of the
opposition of Satan, who at that time will have incarnated himself in
the Antichrist. How beautifully this illustrates the fact that every
Type in the Scriptures has its Anti-Type, and that the Old Testament
**infolds** and **unfolds** the New Testament, and that until the
Anti-Type appears the plan and purpose of God remains' unfulfilled and
incomplete.

These "**TWO WITNESSES**" are to prophecy for 1260 days, or 3½ years,
and for that length of time they are **immune from death**. For if any
man attempt to hurt them, "**fire will proceed out of their mouths and
devour their enemies**." But when they have "**finished their
testimony**," they shall be overcome by "**THE BEAST**" (Antichrist),
who will make war against them, and shall kill them, and their dead
bodies shall lie in the streets of Jerusalem, which is spiritually
called Sodom and Egypt at that time, because the character of its
inhabitants will resemble the character of the inhabitants of Sodom in
the days of Lot, and the conduct of Israel in Egypt (Ezek. 23:3-4, 8,
19), for the space of "**three days and a half**," and the people of all
nationalities shall not suffer their dead bodies to be buried, and they
shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to
another, because these "**TWO WITNESSES**" who tormented them by their
testimony and their plagues are dead. How foolish men are. They think
that when they kill God's Prophets they have destroyed His law, and
cannot be punished.

But the people's rejoicing will be short-lived, for at the end of the 3½
days the "**SPIRIT OF LIFE**" will re-enter the bodies of the "**TWO
WITNESSES**," and they shall stand upon their feet, and great fear shall
be upon their enemies, and a voice from Heaven will be heard
saying--"**COME UP HITHER**," and they shall ascend up to Heaven in a
**cloud** as Christ Himself ascended, and their enemies shall witness
their ascent. They are first **resurrected** and then **translated**.
The same hour of their ascension there will be a "**Great Earthquake**"
that will destroy a **tenth part of the city of Jerusalem** and 7000 of
its inhabitants, and the remainder of its inhabitants will turn to God
from **fright**. But this repentance will be short-lived, like that of
Pharoah's.

It must not be supposed that because this description of the "Two
Witnesses" is given to John in the "**INTERVAL**" between the "Sixth"
and "Seventh" Trumpets, that the "Two Witnesses" testify

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

**only during that "INTERVAL."** The time is too short, for they testify
for 1260 days, or 42 months. Their witnessing was still **future** when
John was told about them, for the "**MIGHTY ANGEL**" said to John--"I
**WILL** give," showing that the "Two Witnesses" had not as yet
appeared, for John did not see them, he simply recorded what the
"**MIGHTY ANGEL**" told him about them. As we have seen, the period of
their witnessing is during the "**last half**" of the Week, and
therefore they do not appear until the "**Middle**" of the Week.

"The '**SECOND WOE**' is past: and, behold, the '**THIRD WOE**' cometh
quickly."
