<p>The explanation as to the meaning of the "<b>LITTLE HORN</b>" perplexed Daniel, and he voiced it by saying "My '<b>cogitation</b>s' much troubled me, and my <b>countenance changed in me</b> (he had a sad look); but I kept the matter in <b>my heart</b>." Dan. 7:28. To comfort His Servant, God, two years later, transported Daniel in vision to Shushan, the Capital of Persia, and as he stood on the bank of the river Ulai, he saw a <b>RAM</b> which had "<b>Two Horns</b>," one higher than the other, and the higher came up last. He saw the <b>RAM</b> push "<b>Westward</b>," and "<b>Northward</b>," and "<b>Southward</b>," and nothing could stand before it, and it did according to its will. Dan. 8:4. While Daniel was "considering" what the Vision of the <b>RAM</b> meant, he saw a <b>HE-GOAT</b> come from the West unmolested, and he noticed it had a "<b>NOTABLE HORN</b>" between its eyes, and when it reached the <b>RAM</b> it was moved with "<b>choler</b>" or anger against it, and smote it with "<b>fury</b>," and broke its. "<b>Two Horns</b>," and <b>knocked it down</b> and <b>stamped upon it</b>. Then the <b>HE-GOAT</b> waxed great, but when it became strong its "<b>GREAT HORN</b>" was broken off, and "<b>Four Notable Horns</b>" came up in its place, and out of one of them sprang a "<b>LITTLE HORN</b>" which waxed exceedingly great toward the "<b>South</b>," and toward the "<b>East</b>," and toward the "<b>Pleasant Land</b>" (Palestine), Dan. 8; 5-9.</p>

<p>When Daniel sought for the meaning of this Vision he heard a voice say--"Gabriel, make this man to understand the Vision." Then Gabriel said to Daniel the Vision belongs to the "<b>Time of the End</b>" (the End of the Times of the Gentiles), and is to make thee know what shall come to pass in the "<b>Last End of the Indignation</b>" (the Great Tribulation). Dan. 8:15-19. Gabriel then informed Daniel that the "<b>RAM</b>" stood for the "Medo-Persian Empire," with its two Kings, Darius and his nephew Cyrus, that the "<b>HE-GOAT</b>" stood for the "Grecian Empire," the "<b>GREAT HORN</b>" between its eyes for its first King (Alexander the Great), and that the "<b>FOUR HORNS</b>" that took the place of the "<b>GREAT HORN</b>," stood for "<b>Four Kingdoms</b>" into which the "Grecian Empire" should be divided.</p>  
<p>This explanation cleared up things considerably for Daniel. It revealed to him that the "<b>TWO HORNS</b>" of the <b>RAM</b>, one higher than the other, and the "<b>TWO SHOULDERS</b>" of the <b>BEAR</b>, one higher than the other, and the "<b>TWO ARMS</b>" of the <b>COLOSSUS</b>, stood for the same thing, the double Empire of Medo-Persia. He also saw that the "<b>FOUR HORNS</b>" that came up in the place of the "<b>GREAT HORN</b>" corresponded to the "<b>FOUR HEADS</b>" of the <b>LEOPARD</b>, and therefore must correspond with the "<b>ABDOMEN</b>" and "<b>HIPS</b>" of the <b>COLOSSUS</b>, and stand for the Grecian Empire, and its "<b>Fourfold Division</b>" among the Generals of Alexander the Great.</p>  
<p>But Daniel was still troubled as to the meaning of the "<b>LITTLE HORN</b>" that he saw come out of one of the "<b>Four Horns</b>" of the <b>HE-GOAT</b>, and Gabriel told him that it stood for a King of "<b>Fierce Countenance</b>" who should stand up in the "<b>LATTER TIME</b>" of the Kingdom, and who should stand up against the "<b>PRINCE OF PRINCES</b>" (Christ). Dan. 8:23-25. The description of this "<b>LITTLE HORN</b>" so clearly corresponded to the description of the "<b>LITTLE HORN</b>" that Daniel saw arise amid the "<b>Ten Horns</b>" of the "Fourth Wild Beast," that he saw they described and stood for the <b>same Person</b>. The revelation so overcame Daniel that he "fainted," and was sick certain days. Dan. 8:27</p>
