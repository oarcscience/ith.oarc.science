### SIXTH DOOM.

### SATAN.

Rev. 20:10.

"And the '**Devil**' that deceived them was cast into the '**LAKE OF
FIRE AND BRIMSTONE**,' where the '**Beast**' and the **False Prophet**
are, and shall be **tormented day and night for ever and ever**."

As punishment for his final act of Rebellion, Satan shall be seized,
probably by the same Angel that chained him, and hurled into the "**LAKE
OF FIRE**," where he will find alive and waiting for him the "**Beast**"
and the "**False Prophet**" who were cast therein a 1000 years before.
This shows that there is no such thing as annihilation. The "Lake of
Fire" was prepared for the Devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41), not to
consume them in, for God could do that with **fire from heaven**, but to
**PUNISH THEM IN**; and all those whose names are not written in the
"Book of Life" will go to the same place to spend eternity. The reason
why Satan does not want people to read and study the Book of Revelation
is, because he does not want the world to know that there is to be an
end to his power.

Only the "**bodies**" of those who perish in this last great war will be
destroyed by fire, their "**souls**" and "**spirits**" will go to the
"Hell Compartment" of the "Underworld" to come out at the Resurrection

of the Wicked dead and .appeal' at the "Great White Throne Judgment,"
and be sentenced to the "**SECOND DEATH**," which, as we have seen,
means that they must spend eternity without a material body in the "Lake
of Fire." See [Chart of ''The Underworld.''](tbr043.htm#img_07500)
