### 7. THE NEW THRONE.

Rev. 22:3-4.

"And there shall be no more curse: but the **THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE
LAMB** shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him: and they shall
see His **FACE**: and His **NAME** shall be in their **foreheads**."

Whoever heard of an earthly city without some place of worship, be it
heathen or Christian, but the wonderful thing about the New Jerusalem
is, that it has no **Temple**. Why need a Temple when the object of
worship is present, for "**The Lord God Almighty and the Lamb Are the
Temple of It**." In fact the whole City itself will be a Temple.

"Then the '**Tabernacle of God**' shall be with men, and He will **dwell
with them**, and they shall be His People, and God Himself shall be with
them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes; and there shall be **no more death**, neither sorrow, nor crying,
neither shall there be any more pain; for the **FORMER THINGS ARE PASSED
AWAY**." Rev. 21:3, 4.

This means that Heaven shall have come down to Earth, and that this
earth will become the **RESIDENCE OF GOD**.
