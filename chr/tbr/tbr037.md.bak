# The Seven Trumpets

<span id="img_07000"></span> ![](img/07000.jpg)

### FIRST TRUMPET.

### (Hail--Fire--Blood.)

Rev. 8:6-7.

"And the '**SEVEN ANGELS**' which had the '**SEVEN TRUMPETS**' prepared
themselves to sound. The '**First Angel**' sounded, and there followed
**HAIL** and **FIRE mingled with BLOOD**, and they were cast **upon the
Earth**: and the **third part of trees was burnt up**, and **all green
grass was burnt up**."

There is no need to spiritualize this. It means just what it says. These
things have happened before why not again? It is the fulfilment of Joel
2:30-31, where the Lord says that in the "latter days" He will--"Shew
wonders in the heavens' and in the earth, **BLOOD**, and **FIRE**, and
**PILLARS OF SMOKE**. The sun shall be turned into **DARKNESS**, and the
Moon into **BLOOD**, **before** the **GREAT AND THE TERRIBLE DAY OF THE
LORD COME**." The **DAY** when He shall come to take **VENGEANCE ON HIS
ENEMIES**. The Lord is going to repeat the "**PLAGUES OF EGYPT**." They
were **literal**, why not the "Trumpet" and "Vial" Judgments? The
**literalness** of these Judgments give us the "**key**" to the
**LITERALNESS** of the Book of Revelation. No less than 5 of the 9
Plagues of Egypt are to be repeated during the Tribulation Period. This
Plague is the same as the "**SEVENTH EGYPTIAN PLAGUE**." "And the Lord
said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may
be **HAIL** in all the Land of Egypt, upon **man**, and upon **beast**,
and upon every **herb of the field**, throughout the Land of Egypt." And
Moses stretched forth his "**rod**" toward heaven: and the Lord sent
**THUNDER** and **HAIL**, and the **FIRE ran along upon the ground**;
and the Lord rained **HAIL** upon the Land of Egypt. So there was
**HAIL**, and **FIRE mingled with** the **HAIL**, very grievous, such as
there was **none like it** in all the Land of Egypt since it became a
nation. And the **HAIL** smote throughout all the Land of Egypt all that
was in the **field**, both **man** and **beast**; and the **HAIL** smote
every **herb of the field**, and **brake every tree**

**of the field. ONLY IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN, WHERE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL
WERE, WAS THERE NO HAIL**." Ex. 9:22-26. The difference between this
Egyptian Plague, and the Plague of the First Trumpet, is, that the
situation will be **reversed**. Then the "**CHILDREN OF ISRAEL**"
escaped, now they will suffer. The Judgments of Egypt were directed
against Pharoah, the Judgments of the Tribulation Period will be
directed against Israel.

The Egyptian "Plague of Hail" was clearly a great "**ELECTRICAL STORM**"
that did not touch the Land of Goshen where the Children of Israel
dwelt. The **FIRE** that "**ran along the ground**" was lightning. The
difference between the Egyptian Plague and the one John describes is,
that in Egypt **man** and **beast** suffered **with the vegetation**,
while only the **trees** and the **green grass** will suffer when the
First Trumpet sounds, and the **HAIL** and **FIRE** will be **MINGLED
WITH BLOOD**. In Egypt the "Hail" smote **every herb of the field**, and
**broke every tree**, but under the First Trumpet only **one-third** of
the trees and grass will be burnt up.
