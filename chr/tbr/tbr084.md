### THIRD DOOM.

### "THE BEAST" AND "FALSE PROPHET."

Rev. 19:20.

"And the '**BEAST**' was taken, and with him the '**FALSE PROPHET**'
that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had
received the 'Mark of the Beast,' and them that worshipped his 'Image.'
These both were cast **ALIVE** into a 'Lake of Fire' burning with
brimstone."

The issue of the "Battle of Armageddon" will never be in doubt. The
previous summoning of the birds and beasts of prey, prove this'. Before
the destruction of the army of Antichrist, he and the False Prophet will
be cast "alive" into the "Lake of Fire." This shows that they are not
"Systems" but "Persons," and as Enoch and Elijah were taken to Heaven
**without dying**, so Antichrist and the False Prophet will be cast into
the "Lake of Fire" **without dying**, and will be still there and alive
when Satan is cast in a 1000 years later.

Before Antichrist is seized and cast into the "Lake of Fire," Satan will
make his exit from his person, and after the battle is over, Satan will
be bound and cast into the "Bottomless Pit," where he will be "sealed
up" for 1000 years'. This is the culminating act of the "Tribulation
Period."
