### FIFTH SEAL.

### (The Souls of Martyrs.)

Rev. 6:9-11.

<span id="img_05800"></span> ![&lt;b&gt;THE SACRIFICIAL
ALTAR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Souls Under the
Altar&lt;/b&gt;.)](img/05800.jpg.md)  
**THE SACRIFICIAL ALTAR**  
(**Souls Under the Altar**.)

"And when He had opened the '**FIFTH SEAL**,' I saw under the
'**Altar**' the **SOULS** of them that were slain for the Word of God,
and for the testimony which they held: and they cried with a loud voice,
saying, How long, O Lord, Holy and True, dost Thou not **judge** and
**avenge our BLOOD** on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes
were given unto every one of them: and it was said unto them, that they
should rest yet for a '**little season**,' until their **fellow
servants** also and their **brethren**, that should be killed as they
were, should be fulfilled."

When the Lamb had opened the "**FIFTH SEAL**," John saw under the
"Sacrificial Altar," corresponding to the "Burnt Offering Altar," the
"**SOULS**" of them that were slain for the "Word of God" and for the
"testimony they held." The fact that their "**SOULS**" were under the
"Sacrificial Altar" is proof that they had been offered as a
"**Sacrifice**," that is that they were **MARTYRS**. But they were not
the Martyrs of the Christian Church, for they had been resurrected and
taken up with the Church. These Martyrs' are those who

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

will be killed for the "Word of **God**" and their "testimony" **after**
the Church is caught out.

According to Christ (Matt. 24:9-14), a persecution will be brought about
by the preaching of the "**GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM**." When the Church is
caught out the preaching of the "**GOSPEL OF THE GRACE OF GOD**" (Acts
20:24), which is being preached now, will cease, and the preaching of
the "**GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM**" will be revived. It is the Gospel that
John the Baptist preached, "Repent ye: for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
hand." Matt. 3:1-2, and that Elijah the Prophet when he returns will
preach. Malachi 4:5-6. It is to be preached in all the world for a
**witness**; and then shall the "**End**," the End of this Dispensation,
come. It will be preached by the Jews, and will be the announcement that
Christ is coming back to set up His Earthly Kingdom, and rule over the
affairs of men. This will be exceedingly distasteful to the Kings of the
Earth, particularly to Antichrist and the Kings of the Ten Federated
Kingdoms, and the outcome will be a "Great Persecution" of those who
preach and accept such a Gospel, and the "**SOULS**" that John saw under
the "Sacrificial Altar," are the souls of those who shall perish during
that time of persecution. That there is no such thing as "**Soul
Sleep**," and that **disembodied SOULS** are **conscious** and can
**speak** and **cry**, is clear from what John saw and heard, for these
"**SOULS**" cried with a **loud voice**--"How long, O Lord, Holy and
True, dost Thou not **judge** and **avenge our BLOOD** on them that
dwell on the earth?" The character of their cry is' further proof that
they are not the Martyrs of the Christian Church, for they would not cry
to be avenged, but like Stephen would say--"Lord, lay not this sin to
their charge." Acts 7:60. Their cry is that of the Imprecatory Psalms
(Psa. 35, 55, 59, 94, etc.) and indicates that these Martyrs whose
**SOULS** are seen are mainly **JEWS**. This is still more likely when
we consider that the "Gospel of the Kingdom" is to be preached to the
**NATIONS**, and Israel has never been numbered among the Nations. Num.
23:9.

To these martyred "**SOULS**" **white robes were given**. This does not
mean that they were resurrected, that is, given **glorified BODIES**,
and then robed, but that they in their "Soulish" or "**PSYCHICAL**"
bodies were given white robes, for while the "**Spirit**" of man loses
its earthly, or **FLESHY** body, at death, it still has a **body**, its
**SOULISH** body, that can see, hear, speak, etc., for how could a
**SOUL** "cry" if it did not have a form and physical senses. For a full
exposition of this see the Author's Book on "Dispensational Truth," the
Chapter on the "Spirit World."

These martyred **SOULS** were comforted, and told that they should rest
for a "**little season**," about 3½ years, until their fellow servants
also, and their brethren (Jews) that should be killed, **as they were**,
should be fulfilled. This promise is fulfilled in Rev. 20:4-6. These are
the Saints of the Most High that Daniel foresaw would receive the
Kingdom. Dan. 7:27.
