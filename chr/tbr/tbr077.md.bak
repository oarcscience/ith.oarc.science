### SEVENTH VIAL.

### (Great Hail.)

Rev. 16:17-21.

"And the 'Seventh Angel' poured out his Vial **INTO THE AIR**: and there
came a great voice out of the Temple of Heaven, from the Throne,
saying--**IT IS DONE**. And there were **VOICES**, and **THUNDERS**, and
**LIGHTNINGS**; and there was a **GREAT EARTHQUAKE**, **such as was not
since men were upon the earth**, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.
And the Great City (Jerusalem) was divided into three parts, and the
cities of the nations fell, and Great Babylon came in remembrance before
God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His
wrath. And **every island fled away, and the mountains were not found**
(they will be leveled). And there fell upon men a **GREAT HAIL** out of
heaven, **every stone about the weight of a talent**: and men blasphemed
God because of the Plague of the Hail; for the Plague thereof was
exceeding great."

It is worthy of note that at the breaking of the "Seventh **SEAL**," and
the sounding of the "Seventh **TRUMPET**," and the pouring out of the
"Seventh **VIAL**," that the same things occur. That is, **voices** and
**thunderings** are heard, **great lightning** is seen, and there is a
**GREAT EARTHQUAKE**. And at the sounding of the "Seventh **TRUMPET**,"
and the pouring out of the "Seventh **VIAL**" there is a **GREAT HAIL
STORM**. This only confirms what has been already stated that the
"**SEVENTH SEAL**" includes the 'Trumpets" and "Vials," and that the
"**SEVENTH TRUMPET**" includes the "Vials," and that what happens during
the "Seventh **SEAL**," and the "Seventh **TRUMPET**," and the "Seventh
**VIAL**," all refers to the same period, the "**END OF THE WEEK**." In
other words, the opening of the "Seventh **SEAL**" reveals the events
that are about to happen; the blast of the "Seventh **TRUMPET**"
announces the events as forth-coming, and the outpouring of the "Seventh
**VIAL**" executes them.

When the "Seventh **SEAL**" was broken there was "**SILENCE**" in
Heaven, but when the "Seventh **TRUMPET**" sounded, and the "Seventh
**VIAL**" was poured out there were "**GREAT VOICES**" in Heaven. The
"Great Voice" at the pouring out of the "Seventh Vial" was from the
Throne, and cried--"**IT IS DONE**." When Christ expired on the Cross He
cried--"**IT IS FINISHED**," that is, the way and plan of Salvation was
complete, and this voice from the Throne that cries "**IT IS DONE**" may
be His voice, announcing that the pouring out of the "Seventh Vial"
finishes the wrath of God.

The "Great Earthquake" that follows will be the greatest that this world
has ever seen. It is foretold in Zech. 14:4-5. So great will it be, that
it will level the mountains, and destroy islands, and so change the
contour and shape of the Land of Palestine and the surrounding countries
and seas, as to make new maps of that part of the world necessary; and
it will raise the Dead Sea so that its waters shall flow again into the
Red Sea. Ez. 47:1-12. It will divide the "Great City" (Jerusalem) into 3
parts, and the cities of the Nations (the "Ten Federated Nations"), and
"**GREAT BABYLON**,"

whose destruction is described in chapter eighteen, will be destroyed in
that "Great Earthquake." This reference to the "City of Babylon" is
further incidental proof that the City of Babylon is to be rebuilt.
Among the cities destroyed in that Earthquake will be Rome, Naples,
London, Paris, and Constantinople.

At that time there will fall upon men a "**GREAT HAIL**." Each stone
will weigh about a Talent, or 100 pounds. Here we have a repetition of
the "**SEVENTH EGYPTIAN PLAGUE**." Ex. 9:13-35. Hail has been one of
God's engines of destruction. He used it to discomfit the enemies of
Israel at Beth-horon in the days of Joshua. Josh. 10:11. The "Law"
required that the "Blasphemer" should be "**STONED TO DEATH**" (Lev.
24:16), and here these Blasphemers of the "End Time" shall be **STONED
FROM HEAVEN**.

It must not be forgotten that the "Seventh Vial" covers the whole period
from the time the "Seventh Angel" pours out its contents until Christ
returns to the Mount of Olives. For the earthquake that splits the Mount
of Olives, upheaves the land of Palestine, levels mountains, submerges
islands, and destroys the cities of the Nations, along with the City of
Babylon, is caused by the touch of Christ's feet on the Mount of Olives
at the Revelation stage of His Second Coming (Zech. 14:4), and the
"**Great Hail**" in all probability will not fall until the time comes
in the crisis of the Battle of Armageddon for the destruction of the
Allied armies of Antichrist. Hailstones will be the missiles used by the
Armies of Heaven.

In Rev. 19:15, we are told that out of the mouth of Christ, at His
return, will go a "**SHARP SWORD**," that with it He should smite the
nations, and in 2 Thess. 2:8, we are told that Antichrist (that
**WICKED**), shall be consumed by the "**SPIRIT OF THE LORD'S MOUTH**."
Whether we take these statements as literal or not, it is clear that
they stand for some **supernatural means of destruction**, and refer
more to the followers of Antichrist, than to Antichrist himself, for he
personally is not to be destroyed, but is to be cast **ALIVE** into the
"Lake of Fire." Rev. 19:20.

As the pouring out of the "Seventh Vial" finishes the "Wrath of God," it
is in harmony with the purposes of the Book of Revelation to foretell at
this point what will then happen to the enemies of God. These we will
now examine under the heading the "Seven Dooms."
