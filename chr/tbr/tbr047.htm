<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="1">"And the '<b>SEVENTH ANGEL</b>' sounded: and there were great voices in Heaven, saying, <b>THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD ARE BECOME THE KINGDOMS OF OUR LORD, AND OF HIS CHRIST; AND HE SHALL REIGN FOR EVER AND EVER</b>. And the four and Twenty Elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshiped God, saying, We give Thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which <b>art</b>, and <b>wast</b>, and <b>art to come</b>; because Thou hast taken to Thee Thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and Thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that Thou shouldest give reward unto Thy Servants the Prophets, and to the Saints, and them that fear Thy Name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. And the <b>TEMPLE OF GOD</b> was opened <b>IN HEAVEN</b>, and there was seen in His Temple the '<b>Ark of His Testament</b>': and there were <b>LIGHTNINGS</b>, and <b>VOICES</b>, and <b>THUNDERINGS</b> and an <b>EARTHQUAKE</b>, and <b>GREAT HAIL</b>."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>The sounding of the "<b>SEVENTH TRUMPET</b>" includes all that happens down to chapter 20:3. When it sounded John heard "<b>Great Voices</b>" in Heaven saying--"<b>THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD ARE BECOME THE KINGDOMS OF OUR LORD, AND OF HIS CHRIST; AND HE SHALL REIGN FOR EVER AND EVER</b>." This is the announcement that the time had come for Christ to take "<b>THE KINGDOM</b>," though "The Kingdom" does not fully come into His possession for 3&frac12; years. The whole of this passage is <b>anticipative</b>, for the "sayings" of the Four and Twenty Elders look forward to the Resurrections and Judgments of chapter 20. The scene is located in Heaven. For it is there that John hears the Trumpet sound, and sees the "Temple of God" opened, and hears the "voices" and "thunderings" that accompany the devastation of the earth by "earthquake" and "hail." This announcement is preliminary to the great events that are to follow, which will be the most remarkable and momentous that have ever happened on this earth.</p>  
<p>The "<b>THIRD WOE</b>" includes the "<b>VIALS</b>," and all other judgments down to chapter 20:3. The "<b>Time Limit</b>" of the "<b>SEVENTH TRUMPET</b>" is given in chapter 10:7, and is spoken of as <b>"THE 'DAYS'"</b> of the "<b>Voice</b>" of the "<b>SEVENTH ANGEL</b>" when he shall <b>BEGIN TO SOUND</b>. Implying that the blast or blasts, of the "<b>SEVENTH TRUMPET</b>" shall be <b>long continued</b>, that is, extend over the whole of the last half of the "Week."</p>
