### SECOND SEAL.

### (A Red Horse.)

Rev. 6:3-4.

<span id="img_05500"></span> ![](img/05500.jpg)

"And when He had opened the '**SECOND SEAL**,' I heard the 'Second
Beast' say, **Come**. And there went out another Horse that was **RED**:
and power was given to him that sat thereon to **take peace from the
earth**, and that they should **kill one another**: and there was given
unto him a **GREAT SWORD**."

There is no need to tarry long with this **SEAL**. When it was broken
John heard the second, or "Calf-like Living Creature" say, "**Come**,"
and a "**RED HORSE**" appeared and went forth, whose Rider was given a
"GREAT SWORD," and who had power to take peace from the earth, and cause
men to kill one another. The symbolism is very clear. **Red**, the color
of the Horse, is a symbol of **BLOOD**, and the **Sword** is a symbol of
**WAR**. The time is clearly that prophesied by Christ--"And ye shall
hear of wars and rumors of wars . . . for nation shall rise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom." Matt. 24:6-7. This seems to imply
that the Antichrist will not have everything his own way, and that his
Autocratic methods will lead to insubordination and civil wars among the
nations under some great leader represented by the Rider of the Red
Horse, whose "Great Sword" is symbolical of the awful destruction of
human life that will follow.

This is a fulfillment of 1. Thess. 5:3. "When they shall say **PEACE**
and **SAFETY**; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail
upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape." We learn from this
"Seal" that wars are likely to break out at any time and that there will
be no peace on the earth until the return of the "Prince of Peace."
