### SEVENTH DOOM.

### THE WICKED DEAD.

### "THE GREAT WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT."

Rev. 20:11-15.

"And I saw a **GREAT WHITE THRONE**, and Him that sat on it, from whose
face the earth and the heaven (atmosphere of our earth) **fled away**;
and there was found no place for them. And I saw the **dead**, small and
great, stand before God: and the Books were opened: and another Book was
opened, which is the '**BOOK OF LIFE**': and the dead were judged out of
those things which were written in the Books, **according to their
works**. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it: and '**Death**'
and '**Hell**' delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were
judged every man **according to their works**. And '**Death**' and
'**Hell**' were cast into the '**LAKE OF FIRE**: This is the '**SECOND
DEATH**.' And whosoever was not found written in the '**BOOK OF LIFE**'
was cast into the '**LAKE OF FIRE**'."

This is not a "**General Judgment**," for there is no such thing in the
Scriptures. The Church is not in this Judgment, nor is Israel, for both
have been already judged. The Church was Judged at the "**Judgment Seat
of Christ**," and Israel was Judged during the "**Tribulation Period**."
This is a Judgment of the **DEAD ONLY**, and is an entirely different
Judgment from that of "The Nations" recorded in Matt. 25:31-46. That is
on the earth, this is in Heaven. That is of the "**Living Nations**," as
**Nations**, this is of the **DEAD**. That is for the Nations' treatment
of Christ's brethren, the Jews, this is for **WORKS**. There no
"**books**" are opened, here they are. No "**Book of Life**" is
mentioned there, here there is. That Judgment was **before** the
Millennium, when Christ shall sit on the "**Throne of His Glory**," and
is to find out what Nations shall have a right to enter into the
"Millennial Kingdom," this is **after** the Millennium when Christ shall
sit on the "**Great White Throne**." The two Judgments are entirely
separate as to **time**, **place**, **basis of judgment** and
**result**. See [Chart of the Resurrections and
Judgments](tbr087.htm#img_17800.md).

In this Judgment "**Death**" and "**Hell**" are personified. By
"**Death**" we are to understand the "**Grave**" which holds the
"**body**" until the Resurrection; by "**Hell**," the Compartment of the
"**Underworld**" or "**HADES**," where the "**souls**" of the Wicked
Dead remain until the Resurrection of the Wicked. That both "**Death**"
and "**Hell**" are cast into the "**LAKE OF FIRE**" signifies that
**Death** and **Sin** will not be found on the New Earth.

The "Great White Throne" will not be on the earth, for the "Great White
Throne Judgment" will take place during the "Renovation of the Earth By
Fire," for the "Renovation of the Earth" is reserved or kept until the
time of that Judgment, which Peter calls "**The Day of Judgment and
Perdition of Ungodly Men**" (2. Pet. 3:7),

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

because the Judgment of the "Great White Throne" is the Judgment of the
**WICKED DEAD**. All the Righteous dead arose at the "First
Resurrection." If any Righteous die between the "First Resurrection" and
the "Resurrection of the Wicked," or "Second Resurrection," they will
rise with the **Wicked dead** at that Resurrection. The
words--"Whosoever was not found written in the '**Book of Life**',"
implies that there will be **some**, probably very few in comparison,
Righteous at the "Second Resurrection." At the close of the Millennium,
and just before the "Renovation of the Earth By Fire," the living
Righteous will probably be translated, and the living Wicked or Ungodly
will be destroyed in the flames that will consume the Earth's atmosphere
and exterior surface.

The Wicked or Ungodly will not be judged to see whether they are
**entitled** to "Eternal Life," but to ascertain the "**degree**" of
their punishment. The sad feature of this Judgment will be that there
will be many kind and lovable people there who were not saved, and who
will be classed among the "**ungodly**" because they rejected Christ as
a Saviour. The "**Books**" will be opened in which the "**Recording
Angel**" has kept a record of every person's life, and they will be
Judged every man **according to his "Works."** Some will be sentenced to
a more severe punishment than others, but none will escape. The worst of
all is, that those who were not so bad must spend Eternity with the
ungodly, and that in the "Lake of Fire." Their punishment includes the
"**Second Death**," which means, as we have seen, that they shall lose
their resurrection body, in which they were Judged and become
"**disembodied spirits**" again, and so exist in the **"Lake of Fire"
FOREVER**.

What a Judgment Scene that will be. There will be Cain and the wicked
Antediluvians; the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah; Pharoah, Ahab,
Jezebel, Judas and all those Scribes' and Pharisees and Chief Priests
who caused the Crucifixion of our Lord, and did not repent, and Ananias
and Sapphira, and the great host of the wicked and rejectors of Christ
of all nations and ages.

The "**Fallen Angels**" (not the Devil's angels) who are "**reserved in
everlasting chains under darkness**," will be Judged at this time, which
**Jude** calls the "**Judgment of the GREAT DAY**." Jude 6. When this
Judgment is over the Devil and his angels, and all the ungodly, will
have been consigned to the "Lake of Fire," and the Universe purged of
all evil, and righteousness shall reign supreme on the New Earth.
