# CHAPTER VI

### AN INQUIRY CONCERNING PREPARATION FOR COMMUNION

#### The Voice of the Disciple

When I consider Thy dignity, O Lord, and mine own vileness, I tremble
very exceedingly, and am confounded within myself. For if I approach
not, I fly from life; and if I intrude myself unworthily, I run into Thy
displeasure. What then shall I do, O my God, Thou helper and Counsellor
in necessities.

2\. Teach Thou me the right way; propound unto me some short exercise
befitting Holy Communion. For it is profitable to know how I ought to
prepare my heart devoutly and reverently for Thee, to the intent that I
may receive Thy Sacrament to my soul's health \[or it may be also for
the celebrating this so great and divine mystery\].
