### OF THE SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR

#### The Voice of Christ

Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh
you,(1) saith the Lord. The bread that I will give is My flesh which I
give for the life of the world.(2) Take, eat: this is My Body, which is
given for you; this do in remembrance of Me.(3) He that eateth My flesh
and drinketh My blood dwelleth in Me and I in him. The words that I
speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.(4)
