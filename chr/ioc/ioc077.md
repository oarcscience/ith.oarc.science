# CHAPTER XXXIX

### THAT MAN MUST NOT BE IMMERSED IN BUSINESS

"My Son, always commit thy cause to Me; I will dispose it aright in due
time. Wait for My arrangement of it, and then thou shalt find it for thy
profit."

2\. O Lord, right freely I commit all things to Thee; for my planning
can profit but little. Oh that I did not dwell so much on future events,
but could offer myself altogether to Thy pleasures without delay.

3\. "My Son, a man often striveth vehemently after somewhat which he
desireth; but when he hath obtained it he beginneth to be of another
mind, because his affections towards it are not lasting, but rather rush
on from one thing to another. Therefore it is not really a small thing,
when in small things we resist self."

4\. The true progress of man lieth in self-denial, and a man who denieth
himself is free and safe. But the old enemy, opposer of all good things,
ceaseth not from temptation; but day and night setteth his wicked
snares, if haply he may be able to entrap the unwary. Watch and pray,
saith the Lord, lest ye enter into temptation.(1)

\(1\) Matthew xxvi. 41.
