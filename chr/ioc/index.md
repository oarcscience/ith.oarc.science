The 15th century treatise Of the Imitation of Christ is one of the most
popular Christian books of all time. Although its authorship was
disputed for a long time, it is generally now regarded as the product of
Thomas a Kempis. The work is a manual of devotion assisting the soul in
its pursuit of holiness and communion with God. Written as it was for
the monastic life, it presents a high standard for spiritual life, and
an ideal for devout Christians to aspire to. --J.B. Hare
