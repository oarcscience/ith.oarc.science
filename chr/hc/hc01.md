*The Story of My Misfortunes*, by Peter Abelard, tr. Henry Adams
Bellows, \[1922\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FOREWORD

    OFTEN the hearts of men and women are stirred, as likewise they are
soothed in their sorrows more by example than by words. And therefore,
because I too I have known some consolation from speech had with one who
was a witness thereof, am I now minded to write of the sufferings which
have sprung out of my misfortunes, for the eyes of one who, though
absent, is of himself ever a consoler. This I do so that, in comparing
your sorrows with mine, you may discover that yours are in truth nought,
or at the most but of small account, and so shall you come to bear them
more easily.
