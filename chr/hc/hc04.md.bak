### CHAPTER III

#### OF HOW HE CAME TO LAON TO SEEK ANSELM AS TEACHER

    I SOUGHT out, therefore, this same venerable man, whose fame, in
truth, was more the result of long established custom than of the
potency of his own talent or intellect. If any one came to him impelled
by doubt on any subject, he went away more doubtful still. He was
wonderful, indeed, in the eyes of these who only listened to him, but
those who asked him questions perforce held him as nought. He had a
miraculous flow of words, but they were contemptible in meaning and
quite void of reason. When he kindled a fire, he filled his house with
smoke and illumined it not at all. He was a tree which seemed noble to
those who gazed upon its leaves from afar, but to those who came nearer
and examined it more closely was revealed its barrenness. When,
therefore, I had come to this tree that I might pluck the fruit thereof,
I discovered that it was indeed the fig tree which Our Lord cursed
(Matthew xxi. 19; Mark xi. 13), or that ancient oak to which Lucan
likened Pompey, saying:

        "he stands, the shade of a name once mighty,  
        Like to the towering oak in the midst of the fruitful field."  
        (Lucan, "Pharsalia," IV, 135-)

    It was not long before I made this discovery, and stretched myself
lazily in the shade of that same tree. I went to his lectures less and
less often, a thing which some among his eminent followers took sorely
to heart, because they interpreted it as a mark of contempt for so
illustrious a teacher. Thenceforth they secretly sought !to influence
him against me, and by their vile insinuations made me hated of him. It
chanced, moreover, that one day, after the exposition of certain texts,
we scholars were jesting among ourselves, and one of them, seeking to
draw me out, asked me what I thought of the lectures on the Books of
Scripture. I, who had as yet studied only the sciences, replied that
following such lectures seemed to me most useful in so far as the
salvation of the soul was concerned, but that it appeared quite
extraordinary to me that educated persons should not be able to
understand the sacred books simply by studying them themselves, together
with the glosses thereon, and without the aid of any teacher. Most of
those who were present mocked at me, and asked whether I myself could do
as I had said, or whether I would dare to undertake it. I answered that
if they wished, I was ready to try it. Forthwith they cried out and
jeered all the more. "Well and good," said they; "we agree to the test.
Pick out and give us an exposition of some doubtful passage in the
Scriptures, I so that we can put this boast of yours to the proof." And
they all chose that most obscure prophecy of Ezekiel.

    I accepted the challenge, and invited them to attend a lecture on
the very next day. Whereupon they undertook to give me good advice,
saying that I should by no means make undue haste in so important a
matter, but that I ought to devote a much longer space to working out my
exposition and offsetting my inexperience by diligent toil. To this I
replied indignantly that it was my wont to win success, not by routine,
but by ability. I added that I would abandon the test altogether unless
they would agree not to put off their attendance at my lecture. In truth
at this first lecture of mine only a few were present, for it seemed
quite absurd to all of them that I. hitherto so inexperienced in
discussing the Scriptures, should attempt the thing so hastily. However,
this lecture gave such satisfaction to all those who heard it that they
spread its praises abroad with notable enthusiasm, and thus compelled me
to continue my interpretation of the sacred text. When word of this was
bruited about, those who had stayed away from the first lecture came
eagerly, some to the second and more to the third, and all of them were
eager to write down the glosses which I had begun on the first day, so
as to have them from the very beginning.
