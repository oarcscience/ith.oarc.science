### CHAPTER XIII

#### OF THE ABBEY TO WHICH HE WAS CALLED AND OF THE PERSECUTION HE HAD FROM HIS SONS THAT IS TO SAY THE MONKS AND FROM THE LORD OF THE LAND

    WHILE I was thus afflicted with so great perturbation to of the
spirit, and when the only way of escape seemed to be for me to seek
refuge with Christ among the enemies of Christ, there came a chance
whereby I thought I could for a while avoid the plottings of my enemies.
But thereby I fell among Christians and monks who were far more savage
than heathens and more evil of life. The thing came about in this wise.
There was in lesser Brittany, in the bishopric of Vannes, a certain
abbey of St. Gildas at Ruits, then mourning the death of its shepherd.
To this abbey the elective choice of the brethren called me, with the
approval of the prince of that land, and I easily secured permission to
accept the post from my own abbot and brethren. Thus did the hatred of
the French drive me westward, even as that of the Romans drove Jerome
toward the East. Never, God knows, would I have agreed to this thing had
it not been for my longing for any possible means of escape from the
sufferings which I had borne so constantly.

    The land was barbarous and its speech was unknown to me; as for the
monks, their vile and untameable way of life was notorious almost
everywhere. The people of the region, too, were uncivilized and lawless.
Thus, like one who in terror of the sword that threatens him dashes
headlong over a precipice, and to shun one death for a moment rushes to
another, I knowingly sought this new danger in order to escape from the
former one. And there, amid the dreadful roar of the waves of the sea,
where the land's end left me no further refuge in flight, often in my
prayers did I repeat over and over again: "From the end of the earth
will I cry unto Thee, when my heart is overwhelmed" (Ps. lxi. 2).

    No one, methinks, could fail to understand how persistently that
undisciplined body of monks, the direction of which I had thus
undertaken, tortured my heart day and night, or how constantly I was
compelled to think of the danger alike to my body and to my soul. I held
it for certain that if I should try to force them to live according to
the principles they had themselves professed, I should not survive. And
yet, if I did not do this to the utmost of my ability, I saw that my
damnation was assured. Moreover, a certain lord who was exceedingly
powerful in that region had some time previously brought the abbey under
his control, taking advantage of the state of disorder within the
monastery to seize all the lands adjacent thereto for his own use, and
he ground down the monks with taxes heavier than those which were
extorted from the Jews themselves.

    The monks pressed me to supply them with their daily necessities,
but they held no property in common which I might administer in their
behalf, and each one, with such resources as he possessed, supported
himself and his concubines, as well as his sons and daughters. They took
delight in harassing me on this matter, and they stole and carried off
whatsoever they could lay their hands on, to the end that my failure to
maintain order might make me either give up trying to enforce discipline
or else abandon my post altogether. Since the entire region was equally
savage, lawless and disorganized, there was not a single man to whom I
could turn for aid, for the habits of all alike were foreign to me.
Outside the monastery the lord and his henchmen ceaselessly hounded me,
and within its walls the brethren were forever plotting against me, so
that it seemed as if the Apostle had had me and none other in mind when
he I said: "Without were fightings, within were fears" (II Cor. vii. 5).

    I considered and lamented the uselessness and the wretchedness of my
existence, how fruitless my life now was, both to myself and to others;
how of old I had been of some service to the clerics whom I had now
abandoned for the sake of these monks, so that I was no longer able to
be of use to either; how incapable I had proved myself in everything I
had undertaken or attempted, so that above all others I deserved the
reproach, "This man began to build, and was not able to finish" (Luke
xiv. 30). My despair grew still deeper when I compared the evils I had
left behind with those to which I had come, for my former sufferings now
seemed to me as nought. Full often did I groan: "Justly has this sorrow
come upon me because I deserted the Paraclete, which is to say the
Consoler, and thrust myself into sure desolation; seeking to shun
threats I fled to certain peril."

    The thing which tormented me most was the fact that, having
abandoned my oratory, I could make no suitable provision for the
celebration there of the divine office, for indeed the extreme poverty
of the place would scarcely provide the necessities of one man. But the
true Paraclete Himself brought me real consolation in the midst of this
sorrow of mine, and made all due provision for His own oratory. For it
chanced that in some manner or other, laying claim to it as having
legally belonged in earlier days to his monastery, my abbot of St. Denis
got possession of the abbey of Argenteuil, of which I have previously
spoken, wherein she who was now my sister in Christ rather than my wife,
Heloise, had taken the veil. From this abbey he expelled by force all
the nuns who had dwelt there, and of whom my former companion had become
the prioress. The exiles being thus dispersed in various places, I
perceived that this was an opportunity presented by God himself to me
whereby I could make provision anew for my oratory. And so, returning
thither, I bade her come to the oratory, together with some others from
the same convent who had clung to her.

    On their arrival there I made over to them the oratory, together
with everything pertaining thereto, and subsequently, through the
approval and assistance of the bishop of the district, Pope Innocent II
promulgated a decree confirming my gift in perpetuity to them and their
successors. And this refuge of divine mercy, which they served so
devotedly, soon brought them consolation, even though at first their
life there was one of want, and for a time of utter destitution. But the
place proved itself a true Paraclete to them, making all those who dwelt
round about feel pity and kindliness for the sisterhood. So that,
methinks, they prospered more through gifts in a single year than I
should have done if I had stayed there a hundred. True it is that the
weakness of womankind makes their needs and sufferings appeal strongly
to people's feelings, as likewise it makes their virtue all the more
pleasing to God and man. And God granted such favour in the eyes of all
to her who was now my sister, and who was in authority over the rest,
that the bishops loved her as a daughter, the abbots as a sister, and
the laity as a mother. All alike marvelled at her religious zeal, her
good judgment and the sweetness of her incomparable patience in all
things. The less often she allowed herself to be seen, shutting herself
up in her cell to devote herself to sacred meditations and prayers, the
more eagerly did those who dwelt without demand her presence and the
spiritual guidance of her words.
