### CHAPTER XII

#### OF THE PERSECUTION DIRECTED AGAINST HIM BY SUNDRY NEW ENEMIES OR, AS IT WERE, APOSTLES

    AND so I dwelt in this place, my body indeed hidden away, but my
fame spreading throughout the whole world, till its echo reverberated
mightily—echo, that fancy of the poet's, which has so great a voice, and
nought beside. My former rivals, seeing that they themselves were now
powerless to do me hurt, stirred up against me certain new apostles in
whom the world put great faith. One of these (Norbert of Prémontré) took
pride in his position as canon of a regular order; the other (Bernard of
Clairvaux) made it his boast that he bad revived the true monastic life.
These two ran hither and yon preaching and shamelessly slandering me in
every way they could, so that in time they succeeded in drawing down on
my head the scorn of many among those having authority, among both the
clergy and the laity. They spread abroad such sinister reports of my
faith as well as of my life that they turned even my best friends
against me, and those who still retained something of their former
regard for me were fain to disguise it in every possible way by reason
of their fear of these two men.

    God is my witness that whensoever I learned of the convening of a
new assemblage of the clergy, I believed that it was done for the
express purpose of my condemnation. Stunned by this fear like one
smitten with a thunderbolt, I daily expected to be dragged before their
councils or assemblies as a heretic or one guilty of impiety. Though I
seem to compare a flea with a lion, or an ant with an elephant, in very
truth my rivals persecuted me no less bitterly than the heretics of old
hounded St. Athanasius. Often, God knows, I sank so deep in despair that
I was ready to leave the world of Christendom and go forth among the
heathen, paying them a stipulated tribute in order that I might live
quietly a Christian life among the enemies of Christ. It seemed to me
that such people might indeed be kindly disposed toward me, particularly
as they would doubtless suspect me of being no good Christian, imputing
my flight to some crime I had committed, and would therefore believe
that I might perhaps be won over to their form of worship.
