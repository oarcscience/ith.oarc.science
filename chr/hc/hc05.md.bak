### CHAPTER IV

#### OF THE PERSECUTION HE HAD FROM HIS TEACHER ANSELM

    NOW this venerable man of whom I have spoken was acutely smitten
with envy, and straightway incited, as I have already mentioned, by the
insinuations of sundry persons, began to persecute me for my lecturing
on the Scriptures no less bitterly than my former master, William, had
done for my work in philosophy. At that time there were in this old
man's school two who were considered far to excel all the others:
Alberic of Rheims and Lotulphe the Lombard. The better opinion these two
held of themselves, the more they were incensed against me. Chiefly at
their suggestion, as it afterwards transpired, yonder venerable coward
had the impudence to forbid me to carry on any further in his school the
work of preparing glosses which I had thus begun. The pretext he alleged
was that if by chance in the course of this work I should write anything
containing blunders—as was likely enough in view of my lack of
training—the thing might be imputed to him. When this came to the ears
of his scholars, they were filled with indignation at so undisguised a
manifestation of spite, the like of which had never been directed
against any one before. The more obvious this rancour became, the more
it redounded to my honour, and his persecution did nought save to make
me more famous.
