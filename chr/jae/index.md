Edward Planta Nesbit (d. 1900) was a schoolmaster, author and land agent
in Angaston, South Australia, during the 19th century. Aside from a thin
book of poetry, this was the only book of his which ever saw print. This
is a scan of the first edition. There was apparently a second edition in
1899, published in Manchester. This was supposed to be a first in a
series titled Christ, Christians and Christianity, as evidenced by a
list of proposed 'Succeeding Books' (none of which were ever published).
Hence my decision to title this 'Jesus An Essene' rather than cite that
as a sub-title, as some library entries have it.

In any case, Nesbit makes a very radical proposal which hinges on Jesus
being a member of the Essene sect, today known as the custodians of the
famous 'Dead Sea Scrolls.' This may not have been the first appearance
of this theme, which remains popular today, but it is the earliest that
I'm aware of. In any case, this is one of those short books which can
have a big impact on the reader.

PRODUCTION NOTES: There are no chapter breaks in the main body of the
book. On this occasion, at least, I have decided to leave this as one
big (400Kb) file rather than insert arbitrary file breaks. Please
download responsibly.--<span class="small">J.B. Hare, February 10,
