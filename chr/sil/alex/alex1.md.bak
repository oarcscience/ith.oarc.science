## FOREWORD

   Many years ago in lovely Lindau on the Bodensee, I happened upon a
thin volume of Angelus Silesius' couplets which startled, amused and
greatly interested me. Although it was in 1657 the world had first
received them it seemed to me that they had lost little of their
significance in 300 years. Their pithy comments upon human frailty,
their wholesome attempt to direct a way toward peace of mind, their
often half concealed humor, have modern application.

   The verse form is that of the somewhat unusual Alexandrine, a couplet
with lines of twelve syllables, occasionally thirteen, which was used in
early French romantic poems about Alexander the Great. In English it is
perhaps oftenest met with as the last line in the Spencerian stanza.

   To have translated all of the 1676 couplets would have been to
encounter much repetition and boredom, and in a few instances,
insurmountable rhyming difficulties. The selection here made was perhaps
arbitrary but represents an attempt to include the most arresting of
Angelus Silesius' couplets.
