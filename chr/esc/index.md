This is a collection of lectures by William Miller (1782-1849), a 19th
century preacher who managed to convince himself and thousands of others
that Jesus would return in 1844. Born a Baptist, he became a Deist and
Freemason. After he fought in the war of 1812, he had a spiritual
epiphany, and was called back to Baptism. After much study, Miller
became convinced that Biblical chronology pointed to the immiment end of
the world, and in 1832, was confident enough to publicize his beliefs.

As the deadline approached, his followers grew into a huge movement. The
calculations were refined by his disciples, and October 22, 1844 was
determined to be the day. As that date approached, Millerites sold their
homes and business, and flocked to the hills to await the last
judgement. Of course, nothing out of the ordinary occurred, and most of
Miller's followers melted away as quickly as they had joined. This
became known as 'the Great Disappointment.' However, the concept of the
imminent return of Jesus has been a major component of evangelical
Christian thought for the past century. Few have been so bold as to set
an actual date certain for the end of the world. Most millennialists
today simply point to various signs and portents to suggest that the end
is near.
