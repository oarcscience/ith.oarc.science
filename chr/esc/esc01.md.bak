*Evidence from Scripture and History of the Second Coming of Christ*, by
William Miller, \[1842\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### INTRODUCTION.

            IN presenting these Lectures to the public, the writer is
only complying with the solicitations of some of his friends, who have
requested that his views on the Prophecies of Daniel and John might be
made public.  The reader is therefore requested to give the subject a
careful and candid perusal, and compare every part with the standard of
Divine Truth; for if the explanation the writer has given to the
scriptures under consideration should prove correct, the reader will
readily perceive that it concerns us all, and becomes doubly important
to us, because we live on the eve of one of the most important events
ever revealed to man by the wisdom of God--the judgment of the great
day.

            In order that the reader may have an understanding of my
manner of studying the Prophecies, by which I have come to the following
result, I have thought proper to give some of the rules of
interpretation which I have adopted to understand prophecy.

            Prophetical scripture is very much of it communicated to us
by figures and highly and richly adorned metaphors; by which I mean that
figures such as *beasts, birds, air* or *wind, water, fire,
candlesticks, lamps, mountains, islands,* &c., are used to represent
things prophesied of--such as kingdoms, warriors, principles, people,
judgments, churches, word of God, large and smaller governments.  It is
metaphorical also, showing some peculiar quality of the thing prophesied
of, by the most prominent feature or quality of the figure used, as
*beasts*--if a *lion,* power and rule; if a *leopard,* celerity; if a
*bear,* voracious; an *ox,* submissive; a *man,* proud and independent. 
*Fire* denotes justice and judgment in its figure; in the metaphor,
denotes the purifying or consuming up the dross or wickedness; as *fire*
has a cleansing quality, so will the justice or judgments of God.  "For
when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will
learn righteousness."  Therefore almost all the figures used in prophecy
have their literal and metaphorical meaning; as *beasts* denote,
literally, a kingdom, so metaphorically good or bad, as the case may be,
to be understood by the subject in connection.

            To understand the literal meaning of figures used in
prophecy, I have pursued the following method:--I find the word
"*beast*" used in a figurative sense; I take my concordance, trace the
word, and in Daniel vii. 17, it is explained to mean "kings or
kingdoms."  Again, I come across the words "*bird or fowl,*" and in Isa.
xlvi. 11, it is used meaning a conqueror or warrior,--Cyrus.  Also, in
Ezekiel xxxix. 4-9, denotes armies or conquerors.  Again, the words
"*air or wind,*" as used in Rev. ix. 2, and 16, 17, to understand which
I turn to Eph. ii. 2, and 4-14, and there learn that it is used as a
figure to denote the theories of worldly men or vain philosophy.  Again,
"*water or rivers*" are used as figures in Rev. xvii. 15, it is
explained to mean "people or nations."  "*Rivers*" of course mean the
nation or people living on the river mentioned, as in Rev., xvi. 12. 
"*Fire*" is often used in a figurative sense; explained in Num. xxi.
27-28, Deut. xxxii. 22, Psal. lxxviii. 21, Heb. xii. 29, to mean justice
and judgment.

            As prophecy is a language somewhat different from other
parts of Scripture, owing to its having been revealed in vision, and
that highly figurative, yet God in his wisdom has so interwoven the
several prophecies, that the events foretold are not all told by one
prophet, and although they lived and prophesied in different ages of the
world, yet they tell us the same things; so you take away one, and a
link will be wanting.  There is a general connection through the whole;
like a well-regulated community they all move in unison, speaking the
same things, observing the same rules, so that a Bible reader may almost
with propriety suppose, let him read in what prophecy he may, that he is
reading the same prophet, the same author.  This will appear evident to
any one who will compare scripture with scripture.  For example, see
Dan. xii. 1, Matt. xxiv. 21.  Isa. xlvii. 8. Zeph. ii. 15, Rev. xviii.
7.  There never was a book written that has a better connection and
harmony than the Bible, and yet it has the appearance of a great
store-house full of all the precious commodities heart could desire,
thrown in promiscuously; therefore, the biblical student must select and
bring together every part of the subject he wishes to investigate, from
every part of the Bible; then let every word have its own Scripture
meaning, every sentence its proper bearing, and have no contradiction,
and your theory will and must of necessity be correct.  Truth is one
undeviating path, that grows brighter and brighter the more it is
trodden; it needs no plausible arguments nor pompous dress to make it
more bright, for the more naked and simple the fact, the stronger the
truth appears.

            Let it be noticed that God has revealed to his prophets the
same events in divers figures and at different times, as he has to
Daniel in the second, seventh, and eighth chapters concerning the four
kingdoms; or to Peter, (see Acts x. 16;) also Isaiah and John.  Then, to
get the whole truth, all those visions or prophecies must be
concentrated and brought together, that have reference to the subject
which we wish to investigate; and when combined, let every word and
sentence have its proper bearing and force in the grand whole, and the
theory or system, as I have before shown, must be correct.  I have
likewise noticed that in those events, visions, and prophecies which
have had their fulfilment, every word and every particular has had an
exact and literal accomplishment, and that no two events have ever
happened, that I can learn, which will exactly apply or fulfil the same
prophecy.  Take, for instance, the prophecies concerning the birth,
life, and crucifixion of our Savior, and in his history we find a
literal fulfilment; yet in the birth, life, or death of any other
individual it would be in vain to find a parallel.  Again, take the
prophecies which have been admitted, by Protestants at least, to apply
to Cyrus, Alexander, Julius Cæsar, destruction of Jerusalem, and the
church of Rome, and I have never been able to trace even a resemblance
to the prophecies in question in any historical events except the true
ones.  If this is true, may we not suppose that the unfulfilled
prophecies in their accomplishments will be equally as evident and
literal?

            There are two important points to which all prophecy seems
to centre, like a cluster of grapes upon its stem--the first and second
coming of Christ; the first coming to proclaim the gospel, set up his
kingdom, suffer for sinners, and bring in an everlasting righteousness. 
His second coming, to which the ardent faith and pious hope of the tried
and tempted child of God centres, is for complete redemption from sin,
for the justification and glorification promised to all those who look
for his appearing, the destruction of the wicked and mystical Babylon,
the abomination of the whole earth.

            His first coming was as a man, his human nature being only
visible.  He comes first, like the "first man of the earth, earthy;" his
second coming is "the Lord from heaven."  His first coming was literally
according to the prophecies.  And so we may safely infer will be his
second appearance, according to the Scriptures.  At his advent, his
forerunner was spoken of--"one crying in the wilderness;" the manner of
his birth--"a child born of a virgin;" the place where--"Bethlehem of
Judea;" the time of his death--"when seventy weeks should be fulfilled;"
for what he should suffer--"to make an end of sins, to make
reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness,
to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy."  The
*star* that appeared, the *stripes* he received, the *miracles* he
performed, the *tauntings* of his foes--all were literally fulfilled. 
Then, why not suppose that all the prophecies concerning his second
coming will be as literally accomplished as the former!  Can any man
show a single reason why it will not?  If this be true, we can obtain
much light by reading the Scriptures.  We are there informed of the
manner of his second coming--"suddenly, in the clouds, in like manner as
he ascended;" the majesty of his coming--"on a great white throne, with
power and great glory, and all his saints with him;" the object of his
coming--"as the Ancient of Days, to send his angels into the four winds
of heaven gather his elect, raise the righteous dead, change the
righteous living, chain Satan, destroy anti-Christ, the wicked, and all
those who destroy the earth, judge, justify and glorify his people,
cleanse his church, present her to his Father, live and reign with her
on the new heavens and new earth," the form of the old having passed
away.

            The time when these things shall take place is also
specified, by some of the prophets, unto 2300 days, (meaning years;)
then shall the sanctuary be cleansed, after the anti-Christian beast has
reigned her "time, times, and a half;" after the two witnesses have
prophesied "a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in
sackcloth;" after the church captivity in the wilderness, "forty-two
months," after the "gospel should be preached in all the world for a
witness, then shall the end come."  The signs of the times are also
given, when we may know, he is near, even at the door.  When there are
many "lo here's and lo there's;" when the way of truth is evil spoken
of; when many seducers are abroad in the land; when scoffers disbelieve
in his coming, and say, "Where is the promise of his coming;" when the
wise and foolish virgins are called to trim their lamps, and the voice
of the friend of the bridegroom is, "Behold, he cometh;" when the city
of the nations is divided into three parts; when the power of the holy
people is scattered, and the kings of the east come up to battle; when
there is a time of trouble, such as never was before, and the church in
her Laodicean state; when the seventh seal opens, the seventh vial is
poured out, the last woe pronounced by the angel flying through the
midst of heaven, and the seventh and last trumpet sounds;--then will the
mystery of God be finished, and the door of mercy be closed forever;
then shall we be brought to the last point, his second coming.

            Again, prophecy is sometimes typical; that is, partly
fulfilled in the type, but completely only in the antitype.  Such was
the prophecy concerning Isaac, partly fulfilled in him, wholly so in
Christ; likewise concerning Israel, partly fulfilled in them as a
nation, but never fully accomplished until the final redemption of
spiritual Israel.  Likewise the prophecies concerning the Jewish
captivity in Babylon, and their return, are only partly accomplished in
the history of past events.  The description of those things in the
prophets is so august and magnificent, that if only applicable to the
literal captivity of the Jews and their return, the exposition would be
weak and barren; therefore I humbly believe that the exact fulfilment
can only be looked for in the captivity of the church in the wilderness,
under the anti-Christian beast, destruction of mystical Babylon, and
glorification of the saints in the New Jerusalem state.

            There are also in the 24th chapter of Matthew many things
prophesied of, which were not fulfilled at the destruction of Jerusalem;
such as the coming of the Son of Man in the clouds, the gathering his
elect from the four winds of heaven, his taking one and leaving
another.  This shows a typical meaning in this prophecy, and that it
will not all be fulfilled until the end of the world.  Also, the
transfiguration of Christ on the mount, prophesied of by himself eight
days before, is noticed by Peter, 2d Epistle, i. 16-18, as being a type
or figure of his second coming.

            Who, that has read the prophecies with any degree of
attention, will not acknowledge the great agreement between the Old
Testament prophecies and the New?  Almost every prophecy given by Christ
and his apostles may be found, in the Old Testament prophets,
represented by figures, which were familiar to the writers and readers
of those times.  The foregoing rules are some of the principal ones
which I have observed in attempting to explain the prophecies of Daniel
and John, and to give the time when the mystery of God will be finished,
as I humbly believe it is revealed to the prophets.

            If I have erred in my exposition of the prophecies, the
time, being so near at hand, will soon expose my folly; but if I have
the truth on the subjects treated on in these pages, how important the
era in which we live!  What vast and important events must soon be
realized! and how necessary that every individual be prepared that that
day may not come upon them unawares, while they are surfeited with the
cares and riches of this life, and the day overtake them as a thief! 
"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake
you as a thief," 1 Thess. v. 4.  In studying these prophecies, I have
endeavored to divest myself of all prepossessed opinions, not warranted
by the word of God, and to weigh well all the objections that might be
raised from the Scriptures; and after fourteen years' study of the
prophecies and other parts of the Bible, I have come to the following
conclusions, and do now commit myself into the hands of God as my Judge,
in giving publicity to the sentiments herein contained, conscientiously
desiring that this little book may be the means to incite others to
study the Scriptures, and to see whether these things be so, and that
some minds may be led to believe in the word of God, and find an
interest in the offering and sacrifice of the Lamb of God, that their
sins might be forgiven them through the blood of the atonement, "when
the refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord, and from the
glory of his power," "when he comes to be admired in all them that
believe in that day."

            And now, my dear readers, I beg of you to lay aside
prejudice; examine this subject candidly and carefully for yourselves. 
Your belief or unbelief will not affect the truth.  If it is so,
whatever you may think or do will not alter the revealed purposes of
God.  "Not one jot or tittle of his word will fail;" but you may, by
your obedience in the faith, secure you an interest in the first
resurrection, and a glorious admittance into the New Jerusalem, and an
inheritance among the justified in glory, and you may sit down with
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of God.  May this be your
lot--is the prayer of your servant,

**WM. MILLER.**
