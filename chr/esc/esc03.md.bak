### LECTURE I.

##### TITUS ii. 13.

##### Looking for that blessed hope, and glorious appearing of the great God, and our Savior Jesus Christ.

 

            WHEN we take a view of the trials, pains, afflictions,
persecutions, poverty, and distress, which the people of God suffer in
this world, we are almost led to exclaim with the apostle, "If in this
life only we have hope, we are of all men most miserable."  But no; we
will not complain; for to suffer the short period of threescore years
and ten, at most, will only give a greater zest to the glory which shall
follow at the appearing of our Lord and Savior the great God and Jesus
Christ.  I know the world are taunting us with the inquiry, "Where is
the promise of his coming? for, since the fathers fell asleep, all
things remain as they were, even from the creation of the world;" for
they will pretend to be ignorant (as the apostle Peter expresses himself
of the deluge) that the world that then was, being overflowed with
water, perished; and still more do they pretend to be ignorant, that the
same earth is in like manner to be destroyed by fire, "reserved unto
fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men." 2Peter
iii. 7.  Also, my brethren, there are some even among us, who "are spots
in your feasts of charity, feeding themselves without fear; clouds
without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth;
twice dead, plucked up by the roots; raging waves of the sea, foaming
out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness
of darkness forever.  And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied
of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his
saints, to execute judgment upon all; and to convince all that are
ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
committed, and of all their hard *speeches* which they have spoken
against him.  These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own
lusts; and their mouth speaking great swelling words, having men's
persons in admiration, because of advantage.  But, beloved, remember ye
the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus
Christ; how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time,
who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.  These be they who
separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.  But ye, beloved,
building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy
Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy (or
glorious appearing) of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life." Jude
12-21.  Or, as Peter says, 2Pet. iii. 12, "Looking for and hasting unto
the coming of the day of God."  And again, Paul says, in Heb. ix. 28,
"And unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without
sin unto salvation."  And Paul further saith, to his Philippian
brethren, "For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look
for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body,
that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body."

            Having thus proved that the apostles directed our hope to
the coming of Christ for the fulfilment of all our trials and
persecution, and the completion of our faith, I shall now take up our
subject in the following order:--I. I shall endeavor to prove that it is
yet future; viz., the coming of Christ, spoken of in the text.  II. The
certainty of his coming.  III. The object of his coming.

            I. We are, according to our design, to show that the
appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ, spoken of in the text, is yet
future.

            Some teach us that he came at the destruction of Jerusalem,
and quote to the 24th chapter of Matthew as proof.  Let us examine their
evidence.  As Jesus went out of the temple, his disciples came to him
for to show him the buildings of the temple, where Christ delivered his
memorable prophecy, which was exactly fulfilled in little more than
thirty-six years afterwards, "There shall not be left here one stone
upon another that shall not be thrown down."

            And it appears that, afterwards, as Jesus sat upon the Mount
of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, having, as may
reasonably be supposed, been ruminating in their minds, or conversing
among themselves, on the prophecy, and had, perhaps, supposed that no
power on earth could destroy those strong buildings, and concluded that,
when this was accomplished, it would be the judgment-day.  They
therefore inquire of him, "saying, Tell us, when shall these things be?"
that is, what he had prophesied of; "and what shall be the sign of thy
coming, and of the end of the world?"  They might not have intended to
ask more than one question; yet they did ask three, and Christ answered
them accordingly.  He had before told them of the destruction of
Jerusalem, 4th, 5th, and 6th verses; he cautions them against being
deceived with false Christs, and not to be troubled at wars and rumors
of wars,--and yet Jerusalem was destroyed in the first war of any note
after this prophecy,--and then says plainly, "The *end* is not yet." 
Now, if this *end* was the destruction of Jerusalem, then where are
those wars, spoken of by Christ?  This cannot mean any thing less than
the end of the world.  From the 7th to the 14th verse, inclusive, he
gives a prophetic history of the trials, afflictions, and persecutions
of his people, and also of the success of the gospel immediately
previous to the end, and says, "Then shall the end come."

            Now, it must be evident that this cannot mean the end of
Jerusalem, because, if so, he that endured unto the end was to be saved
from all the troubles which Christ had been speaking of; and it was not
true that the disciples of Christ did not suffer afterwards the same
things which Christ said they would.  From the 15th to the 28th verse,
Christ instructs his disciples into their duty during the siege of
Jerusalem, and also down to the coming of the Son of Man.  This, you
will see, must mean Christ in person; because neither the Holy Spirit
nor Father is any where called *Son of Man.*  He likewise speaks of the
signs which should follow the destruction of Jerusalem.  From the 29th
to the 35th verse, inclusive, Christ explains the signs in the heavens
and on the earth immediately after the tribulation of the people of God,
which had been spoken of as the common lot of all his followers, and
which he had promised to shorten for the elect's sake, and of his coming
in the clouds with power and great glory; the gathering of his elect
from the four winds of heaven; gives his disciples the parable of the
fig tree, as an illustration of the *end;* and then says to his
disciples, "Verily, I say unto you, This generation shall not pass till
all these things be fulfilled; heaven and earth shall pass away, but my
words shall not pass away."

            Here is the great stumbling-block to many.  Christ is
talking about his elect, his children, and his generation; and not, as
some will have it, about the generations that then lived on the earth;
for they did undoubtedly pass off, a large share of them; for it was
about thirty-six years before the destruction of Jerusalem.  But his
kingdom has never been taken from the earth.  Although they have been
hunted from one part of the earth to another; although they have been
driven into caves and dens of mountains; have been slain, burnt, sawn
asunder; have wandered as pilgrims and strangers on the earth;--yet the
"blood of the martyrs has been the seed of the church;" and Christ has
had, and will have, a people on the earth, until his second coming.  1
Peter ii. 9: "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy
nation, a peculiar people," &c.  The Psalmist says, "A seed shall serve
him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation." Psalm xxii.
30.  I humbly believe that Christ has quoted the sentiment contained in
the 102d Psalm, 25th to last verse: "Of old hast thou laid the
foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thine hands. 
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old
like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be
changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.  The
children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be
established before thee."

            Here we see the Psalmist has expressed the same sentiment
that I understand Christ to have given in these two verses, which I
conclude is the proper explanation.  And then the parables which follow
in the remainder of the 24th and 25th chapters, are easily understood as
having reference to the end of the world; and in that way will exactly
compare.  See the 31st verse of the 25th chapter: "When the Son of Man
shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he
sit upon the throne of his glory; and before him shall be gathered all
nations," &c.  This verse was not fulfilled at the destruction of
Jerusalem, for the "Son of Man" was not seen in the clouds with power
and great glory; and yet the words are, "every eye shall see him;" and
as sudden and as visible "as the lightning, that shineth from the east
even unto the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be."  Can this
have passed, and the history of the world have been silent?  No.  Could
all nations be gathered before him, and there be divided, the righteous
from the wicked, and the one part sent to everlasting punishment, while
the other is received to life eternal, and none know it?  No.  Were the
elect gathered from the four winds of heaven at the destruction of
Jerusalem?  No;  they were commanded to flee to the mountains; and
history says they did leave that devoted city when the Romans
encompassed it with their armies.  Then, could the prophecies contained
in these chapters have been fulfilled, and the world remain ignorant of
some of the most important events?  I answer, No.  Then the "Son of Man"
did not come to the destruction of Jerusalem.  If he did, where is the
evidence?  None, none, not a particle.  But if he did come to the
destruction of Jerusalem, then it must have been his second coming; for
Paul says, Heb. ix. 28, "And unto them that look for him shall he appear
the second time without sin unto salvation."  Can this be true if he
came to Jerusalem?  The passage certainly implies that his people would
have no more sin, or afterwards would be "without sin."  Experience
teaches us to the contrary.  Again it is said, 1 Thes. iv. 16, 17, "For
the Lord *himself* shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the
voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in
Christ shall arise first; then we, which are alive and remain, shall be
caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air;
and so shall we ever be with the Lord."  Who saw this great transaction
at Jerusalem?  Were there no witnesses?  Yes, the apostle John lived
many years after this, and wrote his Gospel, his Epistles, and his
Revelation, long after the destruction of Jerusalem.  And what does he
testify?  In his Gospel, 14th chapter, 3d verse, "And if I go and
prepare a place for you, I will come and receive you to myself, that
where I am there ye may be also."  Again, 28th and 29th verses, "Ye have
heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come *again* unto you.  If ye
loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father; for my
Father is greater than I.  And now I have told you before it come to
pass, that when it is come to pass, ye might believe."  Again, 1 John
ii. 28, "And now, little children, abide in him, that, when he shall
appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his
coming."  And iii. 2, "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth
not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that when he shall appear,
we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."  And, again, in
Rev. i. 7, "Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him;
and they also which pierced him, and all kindreds of the earth, shall
wail because of him."  Many more places might be mentioned in John's
testimony, but not one word that he had already come *again*, as some
supposed.  Let this, then, suffice to prove, that the "*glorious
appearing,*" spoken of in our text, is still future.

            And now we will examine some of the evidence of the
certainty of his coming, which is our second proposition.

            II. The certainty of it:

            1st. Because the ancient prophets all spake of it.  Jude
tells us that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold
the Lord cometh, with ten thousands of his saints, &c.  Balaam was
constrained to admit, "Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have
dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city," plainly
referring to the judgment-day; for he says, "Alas! who shall live when
God doth this?"  See Numbers xxiv. 17-23.  And Moses as plainly refers
to this day in Deut. xxxii. 43, "Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people,
for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance
to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land and to his
people."  David says, Psalm l. 3, 4, "Our God shall come, and shall not
keep silence; a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very
tempestuous round about him; he shall call to the heavens from above,
and to the earth, (that he may judge his people.")  And Isa. xl. 5, "And
the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
together; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it."  In the 39th
chapter of Ezekiel, you will see the same day of judgment prophesied of
in a clear and plain manner.  In Dan. vii. 9, 10, "I beheld till the
thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment
was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his
throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.  A
fiery stream issued and came forth before him: thousand thousands
ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."  Joel iii. 14,
"Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision, for the day of the
Lord is near in the valley of decision."  Zeph. i. 14, "The great day of
the Lord is near; it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the
day of the Lord; the mighty men shall cry there bitterly."  Zech. xiv.
5, "And the Lord thy God shall come, and all the saints with thee." 
Mal. iv. 2, "But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of
Righteousness arise with healing in his wings, and ye shall go forth,
and grow up as calves in the stall."  And Christ himself says, in Matt.
xvi. 27, "For the Son of Man shall come in the glory of his Father, with
his angels; and then shall he reward every man according to his works." 
The angels that stood by the disciples at the time Jesus ascended up,
and a cloud received him out of their sight, said, "Ye men of Galilee,
why stand ye gazing up into heaven?  This *same Jesus*, which is taken
up from you into heaven, shall so come in like *manner* as ye have seen
him go into heaven."  Let us take particular notice of the phrase *this
same Jesus*, and compare with other parallel passages, as, *our God
shall come*, and it will prove to our satisfaction that Jesus Christ is
God, as well as man, and we may have strong consolation for our hope in
his appearing, for his promises can never fail.  "Heaven and earth may
pass away, but not one jot or tittle of his word shall fail."  Also take
notice of the words "*like manner*," which agree with the often
expressed sentence, "He shall come in *the clouds of heaven.*"  We shall
be led to admire the general harmony of the Scriptures, and the
agreement of the prophets in their descriptions of future events. 
Again, Christ says to the church of Philadelphia, Rev. iii. 11, "Behold,
I come quickly: hold that fast thou hast, that no man take thy crown." 
"For yet a little while and he that shall come will come, and will not
tarry," Heb. x. 37.  And will not the evidence I have brought from the
word of God be sufficient to prove the certainty of his future coming? 
And if I should argue the tradition of nations that never saw the word
of God, the conviction on the mind of men generally, that there must be
a day of retribution; could I open the breast of the reader, and show
the thundering of your conscience; yes, could I see and expose the
tremblings and failings of heart, which you have had, while you have
been looking with fear for those things that are coming on the earth--of
what use would it be?  Would you believe it if I could raise a dead
friend who would tell you to prepare to meet your God?  No.  If they
believe not Moses and the prophets, neither would they though one rose
from the dead.  How foolish, then, would it be for me to try to prove in
any other manner what God has revealed or promised, than by the means
which God has appointed.  By his word you will be judged; and if this
condemns you now, (unless you become reconciled,) it will condemn you
hereafter.

            III. The object of his coming.

            1st. He comes to raise and gather his saints to him in the
air.  "As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive; but
every man in his own order--Christ the first fruit, afterwards they that
are Christ's at his coming," 1 Cor. xv. 22, 23.  Again, "For if we
believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in
Jesus will God bring with him.  For this we say unto you by the word of
the Lord, that we which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the
Lord, shall not prevent them that are asleep.  For the Lord himself
shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,
and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. 
Then we, which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with
them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be
with the Lord," 1 Thess. iv. 14-17.  "Now we beseech you, brethren, by
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto
him," 2 Thess. ii. 1.  "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the
first resurrection: on such the second death shall have no power,"  Rev.
xx. 6.  In Psalms we have the same account of the gathering of his
people.  "Gather my saints together unto me, those who have made a
covenant with me by sacrifice," Psalm l. 5.  Again, see Isaiah lxvi. 18,
"It shall come that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they
shall come and see my glory."  "For thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I,
even I, will both search my sheep and seek them out.  As a shepherd
seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are
scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all
places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day,"
Ezekiel xxxiv. 11, 12.

            And now I refer you to one more passage, and then pass on. 
"Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, (that is, die,)
but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be
raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  For this corruptible
must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  So
when this mortal shall put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass
the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."  These
texts, to which I have called your attention, will apply only to the
people of God, or those who are in Christ Jesus.  I have, therefore,
only been proving to you the object of Christ's coming, as it respects
his people.  And I think I have plainly proved that when Christ shall
appear in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, he will raise
the righteous dead, change the righteous living, gather them from among
all nations, where they have been scattered during the ages of
persecution and trial. "in the dark and cloudy day," and receive them
unto himself in the air, when they will ever be with the Lord.--I will,

            2dly, Show that the wicked will be destroyed from the earth
by fire, and the world cleansed from the curse of sin by the same means,
and prepared for the reception of the New Jerusalem state, or the
glorious reign of Christ with his people.  That the wicked will be
destroyed by fire, at his appearing, we prove by the following texts:
Deut. xxxii. 22, "For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn
unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth, with her increase,
and set on fire the foundations of the mountains."  2 Samuel xxii. 9,
10, 13, "There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.  He bowed the heavens and came
down, and darkness was under his feet.  Through the brightness before
him were coals of fire kindled."  Psalm xcvii. 2, 3, "Clouds and
darkness are round about him, righteousness and judgment are the
habitation of his throne.  A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his
enemies round about."  Isa. lxvi. 15, 16, "For, behold, the Lord will
come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his
anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.  For by fire and by
his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh; and the slain of the Lord
shall be many."  Dan. vii. 11, "I beheld then, because of the voice of
the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was
slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame."  Again,
Nahum i. 5, "The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the
earth is burnt at his presence; yea, the world and all that dwell
therein."  Habakkuk iii. 3-5, "God came from Teman, (*south*) and the
Holy One from Mount Paran, (*from glory.*)  Selah.  His glory covered
the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise: and his brightness
was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand; and there was the
hiding of his power.  Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals
went forth at his feet.  He stood and measured the earth; he beheld and
drove asunder the nations, and the everlasting mountains were scattered,
the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting."  Also, Malachi
iv. 1, "For, behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven; and all
the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day
that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall
leave them neither root nor branch."  Matt. iii. 12, "Whose fan is in
his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat
into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." 
Matt. xiii. 30, "Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in
bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn."  40, "As
therefore the tares are gathered and burnt, so shall it be in the end of
the world."  49th verse, "So shall it be in the end of the world: the
angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just." 
Again, Paul to the church of the Thessalonians writes, "And to you who
are troubled, rest with us; when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from
heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them
that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ; who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power." 2 Peter iii. 10,
"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which
the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall
melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and the works that are therein,
shall be burned up."  Rev. xviii. 8, "Therefore shall her plagues come
in one day--death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly
burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her."  These
passages are but a part of the word of God which prove the destruction
of the wicked--of the anti-Christian beast--and the cleansing of the
world by fire.  Yet if Scripture proof can be sufficient, surely I have
brought enough; and where that can have no bearing on the mind of men,
how vain should I be to search the archives of natural philosophy to
give you more evidence! for He who hath all wisdom in heaven and in
earth, and who knows what is in the mind of man, hath used the best
arguments, the most persuasive means (I had like to have said) in the
power of a God to use; and indeed he says, "What could I have done more
than I have done for my vineyard."  He has taught us by his own word, by
the mouth of his prophets, and by examples: witness his word on Mount
Sinai, where the people heard his voice and saw the fire; witness all
the declarations of the prophets which I have read; witness Jesus Christ
himself, in the parable of the tares and wheat, and the harvest;
witness, also, the destruction of the old world by water, and Sodom and
Gomorrah by fire; Jerusalem by famine, sword, and fire.  These are all
set forth as samples to warn us of the approaching judgment.  And yet
who believes the report?  Who is willing to examine the evidences--to
reason candidly and to reflect seriously on these things?  Who among us
puts implicit confidence in the word of God, especially in that which is
unfulfilled?  Any may believe in so much as has been accomplished; but
where is the virtue in such faith?  Where is the blessedness of our hope
in the glorious appearing of Jesus Christ?  If we are "looking for that
blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior
Jesus Christ," we shall examine the word of God faithfully; we shall
compare scripture with scripture; we shall take notice of the signs
which Christ has given us of his coming.  That the day may not overtake
us as a thief, we should live with a steady reference to that day, and
rejoice more and more as we see the day approaching.

            3d. I will now give some of the evidences concerning the
glorious reign which must follow his coming.  The earth, being cleansed
by fire, will, like the phœnix, be revived from its own ashes.  The
destruction of the wicked, the end of death, sin banished, it will
lighten the world of a load of crime which has made it reel to and fro
like a drunkard; the internal fires will have spent their force on all
combustible matter, and have gone out; volcanoes will cease;
earthquakes, tornadoes, and whirlwinds can no more be experienced or
needed, for the cause is gone; the earth or the heavens can no more be
shaken, "that those things that cannot be shaken may remain.  Wherefore
we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby
we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear; for our God
is a consuming fire," Heb. xii.

27-29.  Then, when this earth shall become new, by being cleansed and
purified, the New Jerusalem will "come down from God out of heaven,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.  And I heard a great voice
out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he
will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself
shall be with them and be their God," Rev. xxi. 2, 3.  "And he carried
me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that
great city, the Holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
having the glory of God," 10th verse.  "And the city had no need of the
sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it, for the glory of God did
lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof."  "And I saw thrones and
they that sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them; and I saw the
souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the
word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image,
neither had received his mark in their foreheads, or in their hands; and
they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years; but the rest of the
dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished."

            Much more evidence might be brought to prove the personal
reign of Jesus Christ with his people; but this is enough to prove the
glorious and personal reign after the resurrection; but few dispute it. 
But, say some, do you not believe in a spiritual reign of a thousand
years before the resurrection?  I answer, I believe in a reign of grace,
by the influence of the divine Spirit, for more than 1800 years past;
but when you speak of a thousand years, I suppose you mean the same time
that I call the glorious reign after the resurrection of the righteous,
and before the resurrection of the wicked.  I know of no spiritual
reign, mentioned in the word of God, and especially of that duration. 
We argue that there cannot be a reign of peace and glory until the world
is cleansed from all wickedness, Satan is chained, and righteousness
fill our world; nor until "the glorious appearing of the great God and
our Savior Jesus Christ," even the anti-Christian beast will not be
destroyed, (according to the texts we have already quoted,) until they
are destroyed by "the brightness of his appearing."  All those passages
which speak of this happy period of rest to the people of God, or which
in any manner allude to it, describe it as being after the resurrection
of the saints, or after righteousness fills the earth, and after the
anti-Christian beast is destroyed.  And even our text more than implies
that we shall not realize any great or glorious results from our hope,
or collectively in a body the church will not receive any important
deliverance until the "glorious appearing of the great God and our
Savior Jesus Christ."  Is this true?  I say the passages of Scripture
already named fix it beyond a doubt.  And any one who will examine the
scripture for himself, will find that the second coming of Christ is the
point to which Jesus Christ, the prophets, and the apostles directed
their disciples, as the termination of their trials, persecutions, and
afflictions; and Jesus Christ says, "In the world ye shall have
tribulation."  I say, I can find nothing in the word of God to warrant
me to believe that we ought to look for or expect a happier period than
we now enjoy, until he who has promised to come shall come the second
time without sin unto salvation, and cleanse us, the world, and make all
things new.  These things are abundantly proved in the unerring word of
God.  And now, Christians, if these things are so, what manner of
persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking
for and hasting unto the day of God, "looking for that blessed hope and
the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ"? 
Then let our conversation be in heaven, from whence we expect our
Savior, and stir up each other's pure minds by way of remembrance of
these things; for the time of the promise draweth nigh, when he will
come and receive us to himself, that we may be with him.  How necessary,
my brethren, we should examine the word of God diligently; see if it
does not give some indications, some signs, by which we may know the
"Son of Man is near, even at the door," and our "blessed hope" is about
to be realized in the "glorious appearing of the great God and our
Savior the Lord Jesus Christ."  If he comes and finds us, or some of us,
in this lukewarm state, hardly having looked into his word, and, making
our want of talents an excuse, have neglected to trim our lamps, and
have been very spare in holy conversation, and are crying peace and
safety when sudden destruction cometh, and perhaps have sneeringly
mocked and laughingly ridiculed the idea of Christ being near at the
door, and perhaps have joined the infidel and unbeliever in their unholy
remarks on this subject, and although we have heard the midnight cry,
"Behold, the bridegroom cometh," yet we treat it with neglect or
disdain, or some of us, perhaps, with reproach,--I ask, if the Lord of
such servants come and find us so doing, what will he do with us?  He
will come in an hour that we think not, and cut us off, and appoint our
portion among hypocrites and unbelievers, where shall be weeping,
wailing, and gnashing of teeth.  But we will suppose that he will not
come in so short a time as your speaker believes; still what do I ask of
you, my brethren?  Nothing but what Jesus Christ and the apostles
required 1800 years ago.  I ask you to compare these views with the
Bible.  Is this wrong?  *No.*  I ask you for holy conversation.  Is this
wrong? *No.*  I ask you for heavenly-mindedness.  Is this wrong?  No,
no.  I ask you to stir up each other's pure minds, to make improvement
on your one talent if no more; to come out of this cold and lukewarm
state; to trim your lamps and be ready.  Are these requirements wrong? 
Certainly not; no, no.  I ask you again to compare scripture with
scripture; to read the prophets; to stop your revilings; to take warning
by the old world; to flee from sin and the wrath which is to come; to
hide yourselves in Christ, until the indignation be over and past; to
look "for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God
and our Savior Jesus Christ."  Is this wrong?  Then be the wrong on my
head.

            And now, my impenitent friends, what say you?  "We say, 'You
know nothing about it.'"  Do you believe the old world was deluged? 
"Why, yes."  What makes you believe it?  "Because our philosophers tell
us there are a great many signs remaining of the flood, and we can
believe them."  And are there no signs of the near approach of the
Judgment Day?  What say the prophets, apostles, and Jesus Christ?  Are
they not equal to your philosophers?  Examine your Bibles, and see;
weigh well the evidence; your eternal happiness, the salvation of your
immortal souls, may depend on your decision.  But what say you more? 
"We say, 'You were very unwise to fix on the year 1843, or sooner, for
this day to come; for it will not come; and then you will be ashamed." 
And I hope I may be able, by the grace of God, to repent.  But what if
it does come?  You cannot with any propriety say positively it will not
come, for you make no pretence to divination.  But I say, What if it
does come?  Where will you be?  No space then for repentance.  No,
no--too late, too late; the harvest is over and past, the summer is
gone, the door is shut, and your soul is not saved.  Therefore it can do
you no harm to hear, and believe, and do those things which God requires
of you, and which you think you would do, if you knew he would appear. 
First, I ask you to repent of your sins.  Would this be right?  Yes. 
Next, I ask you to believe in God.  Is this right?  Yes.  And I ask you
to be reconciled to his will, love his law, forsake sin, love holiness,
practise his precepts, obey his commands.  Would these things be right? 
Yes, yes.  And last of all, and not least, I ask you to "look for that
blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior
Jesus Christ."  *Amen.*
