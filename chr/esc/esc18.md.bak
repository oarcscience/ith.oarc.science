### LECTURE XVI.

##### MATT. xxv. 1.

##### Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

 

            PARABLES are always given to illustrate some doctrine or
subject which the speaker wishes to communicate, and is an easy or
familiar manner of making his hearers or readers understand the subject,
and receive a lasting impression.  Nothing has so good an effect on the
mind as to teach by parables moral precepts or spiritual truths.  In
this way we are taught by visible things, or familiar objects, to
realize, in some measure, the truths and subjects presented.  This was
the manner Christ taught his disciples and followers, that their
memories might the more easily retain, and be often refreshed, when they
beheld any scene like the representation of the parable; and in this
way, they might always keep in view the important truth that is likened
to the parable.  A parable, rightly applied and clearly understood,
gives good instruction, and is a lasting illustration of the truth.  But
if we apply the parable wrong, if we put on a false construction, it
will serve to lead us into an error, and blind us, instead of producing
light,--as Christ said of the Pharisees, he spake to them in parables,
that, "seeing, they might see and not perceive, and hearing, they might
hear and not understand."  Men often explain parables by fancy, to suit
their own notions, without any evidence but their own ingenuity; and by
this means there will be as many different explanations as there are
ingenious men.  But I dare not trifle thus with the word of God: if we
cannot, by the word of God, explain, we had better leave the same as we
find it, and not attempt what must only result in guess-work at last;
but follow Scripture rule, and we cannot get far from the truth.  Christ
has given us rules by which to explain parables, by explaining some
himself.  The explanations given by Christ of the parable of the tares
and the wheat, is a rule that will bear in about all cases.  That he has
given rules, is very evident in his answer to his disciples, when they
asked him concerning his parables.  Mark iv. 13, "And he said unto them,
Know ye not this parable?  How, then, will ye know all parables?"  That
is, if ye understand how I explain this parable, you will know how to
explain all others; but if you do not understand how I explain this, you
cannot explain all others."  This is the rule.  Christ made all the
prominent parts of a parable figures; such as the *sower,* Son of man;
*good seed,* children of the kingdom; *tares,* children of the wicked
one; *harvest,* end of the world; *reapers,* the angels; "as, therefore,
the tares are gathered and burned, so shall it be in the end of the
world," &c.  Here is a sample; good seed, tares, harvest, and reapers,
are figures representing other things, as we have shown.  "But how," say
you, "shall we always know what these figures represent?"  I answer, By
the explanation given in other parts of the Bible.  For the word of God
is its own expositor, or it can be of no manner of use to us; for if we
have to apply to any other rule, to explain the Bible, then, the other
rule would be tantamount, and have a precedence, and the Bible must fall
of course.  But it is not so.  Then, to explain our subject, I shall,

            I. Show what is meant by the figures used in the parable.

            II. The time to which this parable is applicable, and,

            III. Make an application of our subject.

            I. I will explain the figures in the parable; and, 1st,
"kingdom of heaven" means the gospel day, or circle of God's government
under the gospel dispensation.  This I shall prove by the word of God. 
Matt. iii. 1,2, "In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the
wilderness of Judea, and saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is
at hand."  That is, the gospel day is come.  Again: "Jesus came into
Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, saying, The time is
fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand."  Luke xvi. 16, "The law
and the prophets were until John; since that time the kingdom of God is
preached."  That is, the gospel day commenced with John, since which
time the gospel is preached.

            "Ten virgins" means mankind in general, in a probationary
state, liable to be wooed and betrothed to the Lord, under the gospel,
and during the gospel day.  See Isaiah lxii. 1-5, "For as a young man
marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee; and as the bridegroom
rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee."  It is
evident, by the second verse, that Gentiles and Jews are both included
in this prophecy.

            "Five wise virgins" is a figure of believers in God, or the
children of the kingdom.  Psalms xlv. 13, 14, "The king's daughter is
all glorious within; her clothing is of wrought gold.  She shall be
brought unto the king in raiment of needle-work; the virgins, her
companions that follow her, shall be brought unto thee."  "That I might
comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion." Lam. ii. 13.

            "Five foolish" represents the unbelieving class of mankind,
while in this probationary state, under the means of grace.  This will
be sufficiently proved by the following passages--Isa. xlvii. 1, "Come
down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the
ground; there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans."  Jer. xlvi.
11, "O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many
medicines; for thou shalt not be cured."  These texts prove, beyond a
doubt, that the wicked class of men are called *virgins* by the
Scriptures.

            "Lamps" is a figure of the word of God; for that only can
tell us about the New Jerusalem; that only can inform us when Christ
will come again to the marriage supper of the Lamb.  The word of God is
the means of moral light, to light our steps through moral darkness, up
to the coming of the bridegroom to receive the bride unto himself.  This
I shall prove by the cxix. Psalm, 105, "Thy word is a lamp to my feet,
and a light to my path."  Also, Prov. vi. 23, "For the commandment is a
lamp, and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of
life."

            "Oil" is a representation or emblem of faith; as oil
produces light by burning, so does faith, in exercise by the fire of
love, produce more light, and gives comfort in adversity, hope in
darkness, love for the coming bridegroom; and the light of faith assists
us to watch for his coming, and to know the time of night, and to go out
to meet him: such are called the children of light, because they are
believers, children of faith, "sons of oil."  "Because of the savor of
thy good ointments, thy name is as ointment poured forth; therefore do
the virgins love thee,"  Sol. Song, i. 2.  "Faith works by love."  See 1
John ii. 27, "But the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth
in you; and ye need not that any man teach you; but as the same
anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and
even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him."  It is evident, that
the anointing here, and elsewhere spoken of, means faith, faith in his
name, &c.

            "Vessels" represent the persons or mind that believes or
disbelieves in the word of God, as in 1 Thess. iv. 4, "That every one of
you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor." 
Also, 2 Tim. ii. 21, "If any man, therefore, purge himself from these,
he shall be a vessel unto honor."

            "Bridegroom" is the figurative name for Christ; as the
prophet Isaiah says, "And as a bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so
shall thy God rejoice over thee."  And Christ says, "How can the
children of the bride-chamber mourn, while the bridegroom is with them?"
alluding to himself.  This proves that Christ means himself, in person,
by the bridegroom in the parable.

            "The door was shut," implies the closing up of the
mediatorial kingdom, and finishing the gospel period.  I shall prove
this by Luke xiii. 25-28, "When once the master of the house is risen
up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to
knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer
and say unto you, I know ye not whence ye are.  Then shall ye begin to
say, We have eaten and drunken in thy presence, and thou hast taught in
our streets.  But he shall say, I tell you I know you not whence ye are;
depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth."

            "Marriage" is the time when Christ shall come the second
time without sin unto salvation; gather his elect from the four winds of
heaven, where they have been scattered during the dark and cloudy day;
when he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all
them that believe; when the bride hath made herself ready, and the
marriage of the Lamb is come, then he will present her to his Father
without spot or wrinkle, and there marry the bride before his Father and
the holy angels; removes her into the New Jerusalem state, seats her
upon the throne of his glory, where she will ever be with the Lord. 
When this takes place, the whole body will be present; the whole church
must be there, not a member missing, not a finger out of joint.  She
will be perfect in beauty, all over glorious.  See Rev. xix. 7-9, "Let
us rejoice and be glad, and give honor to him, for the marriage of the
Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.  And to her was
granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white, for
the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.  And he said unto me,
Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the
Lamb."  Daniel says, "Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the 1335
days."  John says, "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first
resurrection."  All these are at one and the same time; and how can we
expect to be free from sorrow, mourning, and tears, until the bridegroom
comes and moves us into the beloved city? Rev. xxi. 2-4, "And I John saw
the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.  And I heard a great voice
out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he
will dwell with them," &c.

            "Midnight cry" is the watchmen, or some of them, who by the
word of God discover the time as revealed, and immediately give the
warning voice, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him." 
This has been fulfilled in a most remarkable manner.  One or two on
every quarter of the globe have proclaimed the news, and agree in the
time--Wolf, of Asia; Irwin, late of England; Mason, of Scotland; Davis,
of South Carolina; and quite a number in this region are, or have been,
giving the cry.  And will not you all, my brethren, examine and see if
these things are so, and trim your lamps, and be found ready?

            "Trimming the lamps."  You will recollect, my friends, that
the word of God is the lamp.  To trim a lamp is to make it give light,
more light, and clearer light.  In the first place, to translate the
Bible would make it give light, in all languages into which it should be
translated.  Then, to send to or give every family in the known world a
Bible would make the Bible give more light.  And thirdly, to send out
true servants of God who have made the Bible their study, and true
teachers, who would teach the holy precepts and doctrines contained
therein, and to employ many Sabbath school teachers, would in the hands
of God be the means of its giving clearer light.  This would be trimming
the lamp; and so far as the foolish virgins assisted in translating the
Scriptures, in sending them among all nations, and employing
missionaries and teachers to teach mankind its principles, so far would
they trim their lamp; but if they had no faith in it, their light would
be darkness, and the lamp to them would go out.  If the friend of the
bridegroom should proclaim the approach of him whom they all expected,
and should prove it ever so plain by the lamp, but having no faith, the
lamp would go out; they would not be ready to enter in to the marriage
supper, and the door would be shut.  This is undoubtedly the meaning
which Christ intends to convey in this parable.  I shall, therefore,
show,

            II. The time this parable is applicable to.

            In the chapter previous our Savior had answered three
questions which his disciples had put to him on the mount of Olives,
when they came to him privately, "saying, Tell us, when shall these
things be?"  That is, when Jerusalem should be levelled with the
ground.  "And what shall be the sign of thy coming?"  That is, his
second coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, as he
had before informed them, which is yet future.  "And of the end of the
world," or, as some translate it, "end of the age," to which I am
perfectly willing to agree; but what age? is the question.  I answer,
The gospel age, or the kingdom of heaven.  See 14th verse, "This gospel
of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all
nations; and then shall the end come."  "The law and the prophets were
until John, since which time the kingdom of heaven is preached."  The
Jewish economy is no where called the kingdom of heaven; but this
expression belongs exclusively to the gospel; and of course any age in
which the gospel or kingdom of heaven is preached can never be applied
to the Jewish age.  Any novice in Scripture interpretation must readily
admit this.  These were the questions proposed by the disciples to their
divine Master, and were answered in the following manner: From the 4th
to the 14th verses inclusive of the 24th chapter of Matthew, Christ
informs his disciples of the troubles, trials, persecutions, and
distress which they and his followers should suffer, down to the end of
the gospel age.  He also informs them by what means they must suffer--by
false brethren, by deceit, by wars, rumors of wars, clashing of nations,
earthquakes, afflictions, death, hatred, offences, betrayals, false
prophets, coldness, iniquity, famines, and pestilence, and these to the
end of the gospel age.  From the 15th to the 22d inclusive he alludes to
the destruction of Jerusalem, and particularly gives his followers
warning of what they shall suffer, and informs them what to do at that
time; he tells them what to pray for, and how to escape from the siege,
and how to avoid certain consequences which must follow this great
tribulation.

            From the 23d to the 28th inclusive, he warns his disciples
against the error that false teachers would promulgate, that Christ did
or would come at the destruction of Jerusalem.  He told them plainly to
"believe it not," for his second coming would be as visible as the
lightning, and then every man would be gathered to his own company; so
there would be no room for deceit.

            In the 29th verse he prophesies of the rise of anti-Christ,
the darkness and fall of many into superstition and error, and the
persecution of the true church.  30th and 31st verse, He gives a sign of
his coming, the mourning of the tribes of the earth, and then speaks of
his coming and what he will do.  32, Is the parable of the fig tree. 
33, He enforces it by saying, "So likewise ye, when ye shall see all
these things, know that it is near, even at the door."  34th and 35th
verses, He gives his disciples a comfortable promise, which was to this
amount, that his children should not be all destroyed from the earth. 
But "this *generation* shall not pass till all these things be
fulfilled."  To prove the word *generation* is so used, I will refer you
to Psalm xxii. 30, "A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the
Lord for a *generation.*"  1 Peter ii. 9, "A chosen *generation,* a
royal priesthood, a holy nation."  The word *generation,* in the
Scriptures, when used in the singular, I believe almost invariably means
the children of one parent; as the *generation* of Adam, children of
Adam, chosen *generation,* children of God, *generation* of vipers,
children of the devil.  So Christ, talking to his children, and
instructing them only, says, "This *generation* shall not pass till all
these things be fulfilled.  Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my
words shall not pass away."  His kingdom shall not be destroyed nor
given to another people.

            36th verse, He informs his disciples that the day and hour
of his coming is known only to God, has never been revealed, meaning day
and hour only, whether at midnight, at cock crowing, or in the morning.

            Verses 37-44, inclusive, He informs them that his coming
will be like the deluge; unexpected to the wicked, as then.  He tells
them the manner; that he will separate the righteous from the wicked;
one shall be taken and another left.  He then gives them a charge to
watch, and repeats, "they know not the hour."  Christ illustrates his
warning by the figure of the good man of the house, and then charges
them to be also ready, as the good man would, if he knew in what watch
the thief would come, showing us plainly that all true believers will
know near the time, as Paul says, "But ye, brethren, are not in
darkness, that that day shall overtake you as a thief."

            From 45-47, he tell us of the faithful and wise servant who
watches and gives warning of his coming, and speaks of the blessings
that servant shall inherit when he comes and finds him so doing.

            48-51, Christ gives us the marks of an evil servant: 1st
mark, he will "say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming."  He may
not preach or speak against Christ's coming; no, he will only say it to
himself.  But he will not say he will never come; no, he will only think
in his heart, "My Lord delayeth his coming."  When he hears the voice of
the faithful servant saying, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh," he will
say nothing in public against it; no, not so bad as that.  Neither will
he say any thing in favor of the cry; but mutter in his heart, "My Lord
delayeth his coming."  The second mark, "And shall begin to smite his
fellow-servants."  It does not say he will beat and bruise his
fellow-servants, or the faithful servant who watches and cries; but he
shall begin to smite, &c., meaning he will begin the persecution, set
others on, and himself he will keep back, in his heart deceitful.  3d
mark, "And to eat and drink with the drunken."  To eat and drink with
the drunken--it does not say he gets drunk; no, it only says he eats and
drinks with them that are so.  By this I understand he fellowships with
them, and is engaged in, and employs his time, his talents, his mind, to
build up some popular and worldly object, which men of the world would
be pleased in promoting.  He courts popular applause; he seeks to please
men more than God.  "The Lord of that servant will come in a day when he
looketh not for him, and in an hour he is not aware of.  And shall cut
him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites; there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

            Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten
virgins, which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom." 
I think we cannot be mistaken in the application of this parable. 
"Then," that is, at the time when the wise servants are looking for and
proclaiming his coming, and when the evil servant says in his heart, My
Lord delayeth his coming.  Then, too, when he will come, and they that
are ready go in to the marriage, and the door is shut.  This must mean
the time when Christ comes to judgment, for he cuts off the evil
servant, and appoints him his portion, and shuts the door against the
foolish virgins; and when they knock, he opens not, but tells them, I
know you not.

            Where, then, is the millennium? say some.  After the
judgment sits, and not before; after the bridegroom comes, and the
beloved city is completed; when Christ shall move his saints home, and
live and reign with them on the new heavens and new earth, wherein
dwelleth righteousness.  If there could have been a millennium before
Christ should come and gather his saints into one body, it must be a
very imperfect one.  A part of the body in heaven, a part in the earth,
and the remainder under the earth; separated, divided, wounded, and torn
by enemies and death, absent from our head.  No, it cannot be; if in
this life only we have hope, we are of all men most miserable.  If we
are to have a temporal millennium, why did not our Savior mention it on
the mount of Olives, as preceding his coming?  He did not, neither has
any of the apostles; but all speak of troublous times, departure from
the faith, iniquity abounding, and the love of many waxing cold in the
latter days.  Our parable, to which we are now attending, says, at
midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out
to meet him.  "At midnight;" this teaches us that at the time of his
coming there will be much apathy and darkness on this subject; that is
the coming of the bridegroom.  The parable implies the same.  "For while
the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept."  Can we not bear
witness that this has been the true state of the church for a number of
years past?  The writers on the word of God have adopted in their
creeds, that there would be a temporal millennium before Christ would
come.  I call it temporal, because they have all of them taught that it
would be in this state of things, not in an immortal state, neither in a
glorified state; and that Christians would have all kingdoms under their
control; that is, in a temporal sense; and that they would be married
and given in marriage, until the coming of Christ after this 1000 years,
or, as some say, 360,000 years.  This has been, and is yet, the
prevailing opinion among our standard writers and great men.  No wonder,
Christ says, they will say in their hearts, My Lord delayeth his coming,
and that the wise and foolish are all sleeping and slumbering on this
important subject.  For while we look for a temporal kingdom, behold, he
cometh and destroys all that is perishable, all that is temporal, and
erects upon these a new heaven and a new earth, which is immortal, and
that fadeth not away, eternal in the heavens.  I shall now,

            III. Make an application of our subject.  And,

            1st. The time of the fulfilment of this parable is evidently
come, in part at least.  The world for a number of years have been
trimming their lamps, and the wise and foolish have been engaged in
translating the word of God into almost every language known unto us
upon the earth.  Mr. Judson tells us that it has been translated into
one hundred and fifty languages within thirty years; that is, three
times the number of all the translations known to us before.  Then
fourfold light has been shed among the nations, within the short period
of the time above specified; and we are informed that a part if not all
of the word of God is now given to all nations in their own language. 
This, surely, is setting the word of life in a conspicuous situation,
that it may give light to all in the world.  This has not been done by
the exertions of Christians or professors only, but by the aid of all
classes and societies of men.  Kings have opened their coffers, and
favored those engaged in the work; nobles have used their influence and
have cast into the treasury of the treasury of the Lord of their
abundance; rich men have bestowed of their riches; and in many cases the
miser has forgot his parsimony, the poor have replenished the funds of
the Lord's house, and the widow has cast in her mite.  How easy to work
the work of the Lord when the hearts of men are made willing by his
power!  But shall we forget those who have forsaken the land of their
fathers, the home of their nativity, and have spent lonesome years of
toil among strangers, yes, worse than strangers, among heathen
idolaters, and the savage of the wilderness, in the cold regions of the
north, and under the scorching rays of a vertical sun, among the
suffocating sands of the desert, or in the pestilential atmosphere of
India; who have risked their lives to learn a language, and prepare
themselves to trim a lamp for those who sit in darkness and the shadow
of death?  No, we will not forget them; the prayers of thousands have
ascended before the golden altar, morning and evening, on their behalf,
and Israel's God has been their protector.  Surely we may hope that
these have oil in their lamps, who have sacrificed so much to bestow a
lamp upon others.  But remember, my brethren, the Lord he is God, and
let him have all the glory.  This is the time, and the same time that
Gabriel informed Daniel, "many should run to and fro, and knowledge
should increase."  This, too, is the same time when the angel flying
through the midst of heaven had the everlasting gospel to preach to them
who dwelt upon the earth.  Here are Christ's words fulfilled, where he
says, "And the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."

            2dly. It is plain to any diligent observer of the signs of
the times, that all the societies for moral reform in our world at the
present day are parts of the fulfilment of the parable, giving more
light.  What of our Bible societies?  Are not these trimming the lamp
for millions of human beings?  Thirty years past, more than three
fourths of the families in what we call Christian lands were without the
lamp of life, and now nearly all supplied.  Many of those who sat in
heathenish darkness then, are now rejoicing in the light of God's book. 
And much of this has been performed through the instrumentality of Bible
societies, and not only through the agency of the church, but political
men, men of the world, the great men, merchants of the earth and those
who trade in ships, all who live under the influence of the gospel, the
"kingdom of heaven," have engaged in the work.  Will not the most
skeptical acknowledge, that this society has succeeded beyond the most
sanguine expectation of its most ardent advocates?  And is not this
strong circumstantial evidence that the Bridegroom is near, even at the
door?

            3d. The missionary societies of all sects and denominations,
which have been established within forty years, have as far exceeded all
former exertions of this kind as the overflowing Nile does the waters of
the brook Kidron.  See the missionary spirit extending from east to
west, and from north to south, warming the breast of the philanthropist,
giving life and vigor to the cold-hearted moralist, and animating and
enlivening the social circle of the pious devotee.  Every nation, from
India to Oregon, from Kamtschatka to New Zealand, have been visited by
these wise servants (as we hope) of the cross, proclaiming "the
acceptable *year* of the Lord, and the *day* of vengeance of our God,"
carrying the lamp, the word of God in their hands, and oil, faith in
God, in their hearts.  All classes of men are engaged in this cause,
from the gray hairs of old age down to the sprightly youth of ten
years.  Who, then, can doubt but that the virgins in this sense have and
are trimming their lamps, and the bride is making herself ready?  "Go ye
out to meet him."

            4th. The Sabbath schools and Bible classes are but a part of
the fulfilment of the parable, yet clearly an evidence that the virgins
are now trimming their lamps.  This system of teaching the young and
ignorant took its rise between forty and fifty years since, at the very
time that the Christian world were praying, and ardently praying, for
the coming of Christ, before that part of the Savior's prayer was
forgotten, "Thy kingdom come."  From a little fountain this stream of
water has become a great river, and encompassed the whole land.  Every
quarter of the globe are drinking at this fountain or stream of
knowledge, and the youth are taught to trim their lamps.  And when the
bridegroom shall come, may we not reasonably hope that the thousands of
the young men and young women who have assisted in giving light to
others, may be found having oil in their vessels, and their lamps
trimmed and burning, and they looking and waiting for the coming of
their Master, that when he comes they may rise to meet him in the air,
with ten thousand of their pupils, who will sing the new song in the New
Jerusalem forever and ever?  Search diligently, my young friends, and
see to it that ye believe in this word, "which is able to make you wise
unto salvation."

            5. Tract societies are of much use, and are an efficient
means to help trim the lamps; like snuffers that take away the
preventives to the light, so are tracts.  They take away from the mind
the prejudice that thousands have against reading the word of God.  They
remove those rooted and groundless opinions which many have that they
cannot understand the Bible; they serve to excite the mind to this kind
of reading; they enlighten the understanding into some scriptural
truths; they are pioneers, in many instances, to conversion; they can be
sent where the word of God cannot at first be received; in one word,
they are the harbingers of light, the forerunners of the Bible.  And in
this, too, all men in this probationary state seem to be more or less
engaged, from the king on the throne down to the poor peasant in the
cottage, writing, printing, folding, transporting, paying, or reading,
these silent little messengers of the virgins' lamp.  "Then all those
virgins arose and trimmed their lamps."  Has not God's hand been seen in
all this?  Yes, glory be to him who hath disposed the hearts of men to
work the work that God bids them, and to fulfil the blessed word which
he hath given them.  This institution took its rise about the same time
with the Bible society.

            6. Temperance societies.  These serve one purpose in
trimming the lamps and preparing the way for the virgins to go out and
meet the Bridegroom.  Our world, twenty years ago, might be called a
world of fashionable drunkards; almost all men drank of the intoxicating
bowl, and thought it no harm.  But when the lamp began to dart its rays
around our tabernacles, it was found by woful experience that those who
drank of the poisonous cup were totally and wholly unprepared to receive
the warning voice, or hear the midnight cry, "Behold, the bridegroom
cometh."  No, "they that were drunken, were drunken in the night," says
the apostle.  "Therefore let us watch and be sober."  And Peter tells
us, "But the end of all things is at hand; be ye therefore sober, and
watch unto prayer."  How foolish would it have been for a drunken man to
be set on a watch, or a praying man to be found drunk!  Therefore, in
order that men might be in a suitable frame of mind to receive
instruction at the close of this dispensation, and be in a situation to
listen to the midnight cry, God ordered the virgins, and they arose and
trimmed their lamps; and in all human probability thousands who would
have met a drunkard's grave if this society had not arose, are now
watching, with their lamps trimmed and burning, ready to meet the
Bridegroom at his coming.  Perhaps this temperance society is the
virgins' last resort.  The Judge stands at the door; go ye out to meet
him.  This society, like the others before mentioned, is a general
thing, and all sects, denominations, and classes of men are engaged in
it, and it has an important influence upon all men who are in this
probationary state, and who may be termed, as in our text, "virgins." 
This society is of later origin than the others, and seems to be a rear
guard to wake up a few stragglers which the other societies could not
reach.  And now, drunkards, is your time; Wisdom stands at the door and
knocks; let go the intoxicating bowl, be sober, and hear the midnight
cry, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh."  For your souls' sake drink not
another draught, lest he come and find you drunken, "and that day come
upon you unawares, and find you sleeping."  O, be wise, ye intemperate
men, for they only went in to the marriage who were found ready, "and
the door was shut."  "Then came also the other virgins, saying, Lord,
Lord, open to us.  But he answered and said, Verily, I say unto you, I
know you not.  Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the
hour wherein the Son of Man cometh."  "But the wise shall understand,"
says Daniel, xii. 10.

            And now, my Christian friends, let me inquire, Are your
lamps trimmed and burning?  And have you oil in your vessels?  Are you
prepared for the coming Bridegroom?  And are you awake to this important
subject?  What say you?  If this parable, to which I have directed your
minds, has reference to the last day and the coming of Christ; if the
"virgins" has reference to all men in this probationary state, and
dividing them into two classes, wise and foolish; if the "lamp" is the
word of God, and "oil" means faith in his word, or grace in the heart,
as some say,--then my conclusions are just, and the evidence is strong
that we live at the end of the gospel kingdom, and upon the threshold of
the glorified state of the righteous.  Then examine your Bibles, and if
you can as fairly prove any other exposition of this parable, as I have
this, then believe yours, and time must settle the issue; but if you can
find nothing in the Scriptures to controvert plainly my explanation,
then believe, and prepare to go out to meet the Bridegroom; for behold
he cometh.  Awake, ye fathers and mothers in Zion; you have long looked
and prayed for this day.  Behold the signs!  He is near, even at the
door.  And, ye children of God, lift up your heads and rejoice, for your
redemption draweth nigh.  For these things have begun to come to pass. 
And ye, little lambs of the flock, remember Jesus has promised to carry
you in his arms, and that he will come and take you to himself, that
where he is there ye may be also.  But remember, all of you, the wise
had oil in their lamps, and they were trimmed and burning.  Search deep;
examine yourselves closely, be not deceived; and may the Spirit which
searcheth all things, and knoweth what is in the mind of man, assist
you.

            But, my impenitent friends, what shall I say to you?  Shall
I say, as the master in the parable, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh: go
ye out to meet him"?  Prepare to meet your Judge.  Now he has given you
a time for repentance; you have had a probationary season, and possibly
now the sceptre of mercy is held out to you.  Repent, or it will soon be
said to you as Jeremiah said to the virgin, the daughter of Egypt, "In
vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured;" or as
in the parable, "I know you not."  Have you no oil in your lamps?  Delay
not a moment; believe the gospel, and you will live; believe in the word
of God; receive the love of the Bridegroom, and make no delay; for while
they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in
with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.  O, think what must be
the exercise of your minds when these things shall be real; when you
will stand without and knock, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us.  Again I
ask, Will you repent, believe, and be saved?  Are you determined to
resist the truth until it is too late?  Say, sinner, what think ye?  "We
will risk the consequence.  We do not believe in your day you tell us
of.  The world is the same it always was; no change, nor ever will be;
but if it should come, it will not this ten thousand years; not in our
day, certainly.  You do not believe yourself.  If you did, we should
call you a fool."

            Are these your arguments, sinner?  Yes.  Well, if I had
brought no more, no stronger arguments than these, I would not blame you
for not believing, for not one of yours can you or have you supported
with a particle of proof.  They are mere assertions; your believing or
not believing will not alter the designs of God.  The antediluvians
believed not.  The citizens of the plain laughed at the folly of Lot. 
And where are they now?  Suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
