### CHAPTER XXII

<span class="small">How St. Francis tamed the wild turtle-doves</span>

ONE day, a youth had taken many turtle-doves, and as he was carrying
them to sell them, St. Francis, who ever had singular compassion for
gentle creatures, chanced to meet him, and looking upon those
turtle-doves with compassionate eye, said to the youth: "Good youth, I
pray thee give them to me, that birds so gentle, which in the Scriptures
are likened unto chaste and humble and faithful souls, come not into the
hands of cruel men who would slay them". Whereupon,

inspired of God, he forthwith gave them all to St. Francis; and he
receiving them in his bosom, began to speak to them sweetly: "O my
sisters, simple, innocent, chaste turtle-doves, why do you let
yourselves be taken? Now I desire to save you from death and to make
nests for you, so that ye may bring forth fruit and multiply, according
to the commandments of our Creator." And St. Francis went and made nests
for them all, and they resorted thereunto, and began to lay eggs and to
hatch forth their [young](errata.htm#5.md), in the presence of the friars;
and so tame were they and so familiar with St. Francis and with the
other friars that they might have been domestic fowls which had always
been fed by them; and never did they depart until St. Francis with his
blessing gave them leave to do so. And to the young man, which had given
them unto him, St. Francis said: "Son, thou wilt yet be a friar in this
Order, and thou wilt serve Jesus Christ with all thy heart"; and so it
came to pass, for the said youth became a friar and lived in the Order
in great sanctity.
