### CHAPTER XIII

<span class="small">Of the grief which Friar Juniper had for the death
of his companion, Friar Amazialbene</span>

FRIAR JUNIPER had as his companion a friar whom he dearly loved, and his
name was Amazialbene. Abundantly was this man dowered with the virtue of
highest patience and obedience; for, if he were beaten all day long,
never did he murmur or utter one single word of complaint. He was
ofttimes sent to Places where the friars were surly and hard to please,
and from whom he suffered many persecutions; the which he bore most
patiently without any murmuring. At the bidding of Friar Juniper he
would weep and laugh. Now, as God willed it, this Friar Amazialbene died
in exceeding good report; and when Friar Juniper heard of his death he
took greater grief therefrom than ever he had had in all his life before
for any carnal thing; and so by his outward bearing he manifested the
great bitterness which was within, and said: "Woe is me! miserable
wretch that I am, for now no good thing remaineth unto me, and all the
world is undone in the death of my sweet and well-beloved Friar
Amazialbene!" And he said: "Were it not that I should have no peace with
the friars, I would go to his grave and take therefrom his head, and of
his skull would I make two porringers; from the one, in memory of him
and for my love's sake, I would always eat, and from the other I would
drink whenever I was thirsty or desired to drink".
