### CHAPTER XXXV

<span class="small">How, on Christmas Eve, St. Clare being sick was
miraculously carried to the Church of St. Francis and there heard the
office</span>

ONCE St. Clare was grievously sick, so that she could not go at all to
say the office in church with the other nuns; and when the festival of
the Nativity of Christ was come, all the other nuns went to matins, and
she remained abed, sad at heart because she was not able to go with the
others and partake of that spiritual consolation. But Jesus Christ, her
spouse, willing not to leave her thus disconsolate, caused her to be
miraculously carried to the church of St. Francis and to be present at
the whole office of matins and of the midnight Mass, and, besides this,
to receive the Holy Communion and afterward to be carried back to her
bed again. Now the nuns returned to St. Clare, when the office in S.
Damiano was over, and said unto her: "O our mother, Sister Clare, what
great consolation have we had, this holy Christmas Day! Would that it
had been God's will that you had been with us!" And St. Clare made
answer: "Sisters

mine and dearest daughters, I give thanks and praise to our blessed Lord
Jesus Christ, because in every solemnity of this most holy night, and
even more than you, have I had my part to the great comfort of my soul;
because, by the intercessions of my father St. Francis and by the grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ, I have been present in the church of my
venerable father St. Francis, and with the ears of my body and of my
mind have heard all the office and the music of the organs which was
made there; and in the same place have I taken the most Holy Communion.
Wherefore, for such a grace vouchsafed unto me do ye rejoice and give
thanks unto our Lord Jesus Christ."
