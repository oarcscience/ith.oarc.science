The Little Flowers is a traditional collection of tales of St. Francis
and the early Franciscans. The legend of St. Francis (b. 1181, d. 1226),
the patron saint of animals, birds, and the environment, greatly
expanded as time went by, and accumulated in this work.

The Little Flowers is a much-loved spiritual classic. This translation
by W. Heywood has recently been republished by Vintage, introduced by
Madeline L'Engle.
