### CHAPTER VIII

<span class="small">How Friar Juniper abased himself for the glory of
God</span>

ONCE Friar Juniper, desiring to utterly abase himself, stripped himself
stark naked save for his breeches, and, having made as it were a bundle
of his habit, put his clothes upon his head, and thus naked entered
Viterbo, and gat him to the public piazza to be jeered at. As he stood
there naked, the children and youths, deeming him out of his senses,
treated him with great despite, casting much mud upon him, and pelting
him with stones, and pushing him about, now this way and now that, with
words of great derision; and thus tormented and derided he stayed there
the greater part of the day, and afterward, all naked as he was, he
betook himself to the convent. And seeing

him in such case the friars were very wrath with him. And especially
because he had come thus naked through all the city with his bundle on
his head, they rebuked him very harshly, and threatened him with
grievous penalties. And one said: "Let us put him in prison"; and
another said: "Let us hang him; no punishment could be too great for
such an ill example as he hath set this day, both touching himself and
all the Order". And Friar Juniper replied joyfully and with all
humility: "Ye speak well and truly, for I am worthy of all these
punishments and of many more".
