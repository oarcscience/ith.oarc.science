### CHAPTER XVI

<span class="small">How St. Francis received the counsel of St. Clare,
and of the holy Friar Sylvester, that he ought by preaching to convert
much folk; and how he founded the Third Order and preached to the birds
and made the swallows keep silence.</span>

SHORTLY after his conversion, the humble servant of Christ, St. Francis,
having already gathered many companions and received them into the
Order, stood in great anxiety and in great doubt as to that which he
ought to do; whether to devote himself wholly to prayer or sometimes
also to preaching; and touching that matter he desired greatly to know
the will of God; and because the holy humility which was in him suffered
him not to trust to himself nor to his

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

own prayers, he bethought him to inquire of the Divine will through the
prayers of others; wherefore he called Friar Masseo and said: "Go thou
to Sister Clare and tell her in my name that, together with certain of
the most spiritual of her companions, she should devoutly pray God that
He may vouchsafe to show me whether it be better that I give myself to
preaching or to prayer alone. And thereafter go to Friar Sylvester and
tell him to do the like." Now, in the world, this had been that Messer
Sylvester who had seen a cross of gold proceeding out of the mouth of
St. Francis, the which was high even unto heaven and wide even unto the
ends of the earth; and this Friar Sylvester was of so great devotion and
of so great sanctity that by prayer he prevailed with God and all that
he asked was granted him, and ofttimes he talked with God; and therefore
St. Francis had great devotion toward him. Friar Masseo departed and,
according to the bidding of St. Francis, did his embassage first to St.
Clare and thereafter to Friar Sylvester; who, as soon as he had received
it, forthwith gat himself to prayer, and while he was yet praying he
obtained the Divine answer, and turned him to Friar Masseo and said:
"Thus doth God bid thee say to Friar Francis; that God hath not called
him to this estate for himself alone, but that he may have much fruit of
souls, and that many through him may be saved". And when he had heard
this, Friar Masseo returned to St. Clare, to know what answer she had
received from God; and she replied that she and the other companions had
had the self same answer from God which Friar Sylvester had had.
Therewith Friar Masseo returned to St. Francis; and St. Francis welcomed
him with very great charity, washing his feet and setting food before
him. And

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

when he had eaten, St. Francis called Masseo into the wood; and there he
kneeled down before him, and drew back his cowl, and making a cross of
his arms, asked him: "What doth my Lord Jesus Christ bid me do?" Friar
Masseo made answer: "To Friar Sylvester as to Sister Clare and to her
companion, Christ hath made answer and revealed that His will is that
thou go through the world to preach, because He hath not chosen thee for
thyself alone but also for the salvation of others". Then St. Francis,
when he had had this answer and knew thereby the will of Jesus Christ,
rose up with exceeding great fervour and said: "Let us go in the name of
God"; and he took as his companions Friar Masseo and Friar Agnolo, holy
men. And going with impetuosity of spirit, taking thought neither of way
nor path, they came to a walled place which is called Savurniano; and
St. Francis began to preach; but first he bade the swallows which were
twittering to keep silence until such time as he should finish
preaching; and the swallows obeyed him; and there he preached with so
great fervour that for devotion all the men and women of that town were
minded to follow him and to abandon the town; but St. Francis suffered
them not, saying: "Be not over hasty to depart; and I will ordain that
which it behoves you to do for the salvation of your souls"; and then he
bethought him to institute the Third Order for the universal salvation
of all men: and so, leaving them greatly comforted and with minds turned
to repentance, he gat him thence and came betwixt Cannaio and Bevagno.
And passing on, full of fervour, he lifted up his eyes and saw certain
trees hard by the road, whereupon was an almost infinite number of
birds; whereat St. Francis marvelled, and said to his companions: "Ye
shall

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

await me here on the road, and I will go and preach to the birds my
sisters"; and he went into the field and began to preach to the birds
which were upon the ground; and anon those which were in the trees came
to him, and all of them stood still together until St. Francis finished
preaching; and even then they departed not until he gave them his
blessing; and according to that which Friar Masseo afterward related to
Friar James of Massa, when St. Francis went about among them touching
them with his mantle, none of them moved therefor. Now the preaching of
St. Francis was on this wise: "My sisters the birds, much are ye
beholden unto God your creator, and alway and in every place ought ye to
praise Him, because He hath given you liberty to fly wheresoever ye
will, and hath clothed you on with twofold and threefold raiment.
Moreover, He preserved your seed in the ark of Noah that your race might
not be destroyed. Again, ye are beholden unto Him for the element of the
air which He hath appointed for you; furthermore, ye sow not neither do
ye reap; yet God feedeth you and giveth you rivers and fountains
wherefrom to drink; He giveth you mountains and valleys for your refuge,
and high trees wherein to build your nests; and, in that ye know not how
to sew nor spin, God clotheth you and your little ones; wherefore doth
your Creator love you seeing that He giveth you so many benefits. Guard
yourselves, therefore, my sisters the birds, from the sin of ingratitude
and be ye ever mindful to give praise to God." And, as St. Francis spake
these words unto them, all those birds began to open their beaks, and to
stretch out their necks, and to open their wings, and reverently to bow
their heads even unto the ground, and to show by their motions and by
their songs that the holy father gave them very great

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

delight: and St. Francis rejoiced with them and was glad and marvelled
much at so great a multitude of birds, and at the most beautiful
diversity of them, and at their attention and fearlessness; for which
cause he devoutly praised the Creator in them. Finally, when he had made
an end of preaching, St. Francis made over them the sign of the Cross
and gave them leave to depart; whereupon all those birds rose into the
air with wondrous songs; and thereafter, according to the form of the
Cross which St. Francis had made over them, they divided themselves into
four bands; and one band flew towards the East, and one towards the
West, and one towards the South and the fourth towards the North, and
each company went singing marvellous songs; signifying thereby that,
even as St. Francis, the Standard-bearer of the Cross, had preached to
them, and made over them the sign of the Cross, according whereunto they
separated themselves toward the four quarters of the world, so the
preaching of the Cross of Christ, renewed by St. Francis, was about to
be carried through all the world by him and by his friars; the which
friars, like unto the birds, possess nothing of their own in this world
but commit their lives wholly to the providence of God.
