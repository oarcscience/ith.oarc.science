### CHAPTER LII

<span class="small">Of the vision of Friar John of Alvernia whereby he
understood all the order of the Holy Trinity</span>

THE aforesaid Friar John of Alvernia, in that he had perfectly
suffocated every worldly and temporal delight and consolation, and had
set all his joy and all his hope in God, was given marvellous
consolations and revelations by the Divine Goodness, and especially on
the festivals of Christ; wherefore, on a time when the Festival of the
Nativity of Christ drew nigh, whereon he looked with confidence to
receive from God consolation of the sweet humanity of Jesus, the Holy
Ghost put in his heart such great and exceeding love and fervour for the
charity of Christ, whereby He humbled Himself to take upon Him our
humanity, that of a verity it seemed to him that his soul was drawn
forth from his body and that it burned like a furnace. Whereupon, not
being able to endure such ardours, he was in agony and altogether
melting away, and cried out with a loud voice; because, through the
violent impulse of the Holy Ghost and through the too great fervour of
love, he could not restrain himself from crying out. And in that hour
wherein this measureless fervour came upon him, there came therewith so
sure and certain a hope of salvation that, for nothing in the world,
could he believe that, if he were then to die, he must pass through the
pains of purgatory; and this love endured with him for six full months,
albeit he felt not that excessive fervour continually, but it came

upon him at certain hours of the day. And during this time he received
marvellous visitations and consolations from God; and oftentimes he was
rapt in ecstasy, even as that friar, who first wrote of these things,
saw. Among the which times, he was one night so elevated and rapt in God
that he beheld in Him, the Creator, all created things, both celestial
and terrestrial, and all their perfections and grades and separate
orders. And then he clearly understood how every created thing
represented its Creator, and how God is above, and within, and outside,
and beside all created things. Thereafter, he discerned one God in Three
Persons, and Three Persons in one God, and the infinite charity which
caused the Son of God to become incarnate in obedience to the Father.
And, finally, he perceived, in that vision, how that there was no other
way whereby the soul could go to God and have eternal life, save only
through Christ the blessed, who is the Way, the Truth and the Life of
the soul.
