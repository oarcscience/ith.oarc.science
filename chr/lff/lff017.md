### CHAPTER XIV

<span class="small">How while St. Francis and his friars spake of God,
He appeared in the midst of them</span>

IN the beginning of the Religion, what time St. Francis and his
companions were gathered together to speak of Christ, he, in fervour of
spirit, commanded one of them that, in the name of God, he should open
his mouth and speak of God that which the Holy Ghost inspired him. Now,
while the friar was fulfilling that commandment and was discoursing
marvellously of God, St. Francis imposed silence upon him and bade
another friar speak in like manner. He yielding obedience and
discoursing subtly of God, St. Francis, in like manner, imposed silence
upon him, and commanded a third to speak of God, who, in his turn, began
to speak so profoundly of the secret things of God that, of a verity,
St. Francis knew that he, like the other two, spake through inspiration
of the Holy Ghost; and this also was shown by example and by a clear
sign; in that, while they were thus speaking, Christ the blessed
appeared in the midst of them in the likeness and form of a youth,
exceeding beautiful, and blessing them, fulfilled them all with so much
grace and sweetness, that they were all rapt away out of themselves and
lay like dead men, wholly insensible to the things of this world. And
thereafter, when they had come to themselves, St. Francis said unto
them: "My dearest brethren, let us thank God, who hath willed to reveal
the treasures of Divine wisdom through the mouths of the simple; for it
is God who openeth the mouth of the dumb and maketh the tongues of the
simple to talk very wisely".
