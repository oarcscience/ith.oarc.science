### CHAPTER IV

<span class="small">How the Angel of God proposed a question to Friar
Elias, guardian of a Place of Val di Spoleto, and because Friar Elias
answered him proudly, departed and went on his way to St. James, where
he found Friar Bernard and told him this story</span>

AT the beginning and commencement of the Order, when there were few
friars and the Places were not yet taken, St. Francis, for his devotion,
went to St. James of Galicia, and took with him certain friars, among
whom one was Friar Bernard; and, as they thus journeyed together, he
found in a town a sick mendicant, upon whom he had compassion, and he
said unto Friar Bernard: "Son, I desire that thou

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

abide here to tend this sick man"; and Friar Bernard, humbly kneeling
and bowing his head, received the obedience of the holy father, and
remained in that place. And St. Francis with his other companions went
to St. James. Now, when they had arrived there, while they passed the
night in prayer in the Church of St. James, it was revealed by God to
St. Francis that he would take many Places throughout the world,
inasmuch as his Order would increase and grow into a great multitude of
friars; and, by reason of this revelation, St. Francis began to take
Places in those regions. Thereafter, returning by the way whereby he had
come, St. Francis found Friar Bernard and the sick man, with whom he had
left him, perfectly healed. Wherefore St. Francis gave leave to Friar
Bernard to go to St. James in the following year; and so St. Francis
returned to the Val di Spoleto, and abode in a desert place, he and
Friar Masseo and Friar Elias and others, all of whom were exceeding
careful not to annoy or interrupt St. Francis when he was at prayer; and
this they did for the great reverence which they bore him, and because
they knew that God revealed great things to him in his prayers. Now it
befel upon a day that, while St. Francis was at prayer in a wood, a
goodly youth, clad as for a journey, came to the door of the Place and
knocked thereon so impatiently and loudly, and for so long a time, that
the friars marvelled greatly at such unwonted knocking. Friar Masseo
went and opened the door and said to that youth: "Whence comest thou, my
son, for it seemeth that thou hast never been here before, in so
unwonted a manner hast thou knocked?" The youth replied: "And how ought
one to knock?" Friar Masseo said: "Knock three times with an interval
between each knock, and

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

then wait long enough for the friar to say the Paternoster and to come
unto thee, and, if in this space he cometh not, knock again". The youth
replied: "I am in great haste and therefore do I knock so loudly,
because I have a long journey to make, and hither am I come to talk with
Friar Francis; but he is now in the wood in contemplation, and therefore
I would not disturb him; but go and send me Friar Elias whom I wish to
ask a question, because I hear that he is very learned". Thereupon,
Friar Masseo went and told Friar Elias to go and speak to that youth,
and thereat was he wrath and would not go. Wherefore Friar Masseo knew
not what to do, nor what answer to carry back, in that, if he said:
Friar Elias cannot come, he lied; and if he said that he was angered and
would not come, he feared to set a bad example. And because Friar Masseo
delayed to return the youth knocked again as at the first, and after a
while Friar Masseo returned to the door and said unto him: "Thou hast
not observed my teaching with regard to knocking". The youth replied:
"Friar Elias is not willing to come to me. Go therefore and tell Friar
Francis that I have come to speak with him; but, because I would not
hinder him from prayer, bid him send Friar Elias to me." Then Friar
Masseo went to St. Francis, who was praying in the wood with his face
upraised to heaven, and told him of the message of the youth and the
reply of Friar Elias; and that youth was the angel of God in human form.
Then, St. Francis, neither moving from his place nor lowering his face,
said: "Go and tell Friar Elias, for obedience sake, to go at once to
that youth". Now when Friar Elias had heard the commandment of St.
Francis, he went to the door in great wrath and opened it with much fury
and noise, and said to the

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

youth: "What dost thou want?" The youth made answer: "Look to it, friar,
that thou art not wrath, as thou seemest to be, because anger clouds the
mind and prevents the discernment of the truth". Said Friar Elias: "Tell
me what thou wantest with me". The youth replied: "I ask thee whether it
be lawful for those who observe the Holy Gospel to eat that which is set
before them even as Christ said to His disciples; and I ask thee further
whether it be lawful for any man to prefer anything contrary to the
liberty of the Gospel". Friar Elias answered haughtily: "This I know
well, but I will not answer thee. Go about thy business". Said the
youth: "I could answer this question better than thou". Then was Friar
Elias wrath and he slammed the door and departed. Thereafter he began to
think over the said question and to doubt thereof within himself; and he
knew not how to answer it, because he was vicar of the Order and had
commanded and made an ordinance beyond the Gospel and beyond the Rule of
St. Francis, that no friar of the Order should eat meat; so that the
said question was expressly intended for him. Wherefore, not knowing how
to decide the matter himself, and considering the modesty of the youth
and that he had said that he knew how to answer that question better
than he, he returned to the door and opened it to inquire of the youth
touching the aforesaid question; but he was already gone, because the
pride of Friar Elias was not worthy to speak with an angel. This done,
St. Francis, to whom everything had been revealed by God, returned from
out the wood and sternly and with a loud voice rebuked Friar Elias,
saying: "Ill do you, proud Friar Elias, that you drive away from us the
holy angels who come to teach us. I tell thee that I fear much lest thy

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

pride should make thee end thy days outside this Order". And so it befel
thereafter, even as St. Francis had said unto him, in that he died
outside the Order. On that same day, and in that hour wherein the angel
departed, he appeared in that same form to Friar Bernard who was
returning from St. James; and he had reached the bank of a great river;
and he saluted him in his own tongue, saying: "God give thee peace, O
good friar"; and the good Friar Bernard, marvelling greatly at the
beauty of the youth and at hearing the speech of his native country,
with salutation of peace and with joyful countenance, asked of him:
"Whence comest thou, good youth?" The angel made answer: "I come from
the Place where St. Francis dwells; and I went thither to have speech
with him and was not able to do so, because he was in the wood, wrapped
in contemplation of Divine things, and I desired not to disturb him.
And, in that Place dwell Friar Masseo and Friar Giles and Friar Elias:
and Friar Masseo hath taught me how to knock at the door after the
manner of a friar; but Friar Elias, because he would not answer the
question which I asked him, afterward repented, and wished to hear me
and to see me, and could not." After these words, the angel said to
Friar Bernard: "Wherefore dost thou not pass over to the other side?"
Friar Bernard answered: "Because I am fearful of danger by reason of the
depth of the waters which I see". Said the angel: "Pass we over
together; doubt thou not"; and he took him by the hand and in the
twinkling of an eye he set him on the other side of the river. Then
Friar Bernard knew that it was the angel of God, and, with great
reverence and joy, he cried in a loud voice: "O blessed angel of God,
tell me thy name". The angel made answer: "Why askest

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

thou my name, which is Wonderful?" And when the angel had thus said he
vanished away and let Friar Bernard greatly comforted, insomuch that he
made all that journey with rejoicing, and he gave thought to the day and
the hour when the angel appeared unto him. And, when he arrived at the
Place where was St. Francis with the aforesaid companions, he told them
everything in order, and they knew certainly that that same angel in the
day and hour in which he had appeared unto them appeared also unto him.
