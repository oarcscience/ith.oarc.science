### CHAPTER IX

<span class="small">How Friar Juniper, to abase himself, played at
see-saw</span>

ONCE when Friar Juniper was going to Rome, where the fame of his
sanctity was already noised abroad, many Romans, for their great
devotion, went forth to meet him? and, seeing so many folk coming, Friar
Juniper bethought him to turn their devotion to scorn and derision.
There were there two little boys who were playing at see-saw, that is to
say they had laid one log across another log, and each of them sat at
his end, and thus they went up and down. Friar Juniper went and lifted
one of those boys off the log and got up there himself, and began to
see-saw. Meanwhile the people came up and marvelled to see Friar Juniper
playing at see-saw; nevertheless, they saluted him with great devotion
and waited until he should have finished his game of see-saw, to the end
that they might thereafter attend him honourably to the convent. And
Friar Juniper cared but little either for their salutation and reverence
or for their waiting,

but took great pains with his see-sawing. And, after they had thus
waited a long time, some of them began to grow weary and to say: "What
fool is this?" Some, knowing the ways of the man, increased in devotion
toward him; nevertheless, in the end, they all went away and left Friar
Juniper on the see-saw, and, when they were all gone, Friar Juniper
remained full of consolation because he had seen some who made a mock of
him. So he gat him up and entered Rome with all meekness and humility,
and came to the convent of the minor friars.
