### CHAPTER XXXIX

<span class="small">Of the marvellous sermon which St. Antony of Padua,
a minor friar, preached in the Consistory</span>

THE marvellous vessel of the Holy Ghost, Messer St. Antony of Padua, one
of the chosen disciples and companions of St. Francis, whom St. Francis
called his vicar, preached upon a time in the Consistory before the Pope
and the cardinals; in the which Consistory were men of divers nations,
to wit, Greeks, Latins, French, Germans, Slavonians and English, and of
other diverse languages of the world. And, being inflamed by the Holy
Ghost, he set forth the word of God so efficaciously, so devoutly, so
subtly, so sweetly, so clearly and so learnedly, that all those who were
in the Consistory, albeit they spoke different languages, understood all
his words as clearly and distinctly as if he had spoken in the dialect
of each of them; and they were all amazed; and it seemed that the
ancient miracle of the Apostles had been renewed, when, at the Feast of
Pentecost, they spake in every language by the virtue of the Holy Ghost;
and they marvelled and said one to another: "Is not this man who
preacheth a Spaniard? How, then, do we all hear in his speech the
language of our own countries?" The Pope likewise considering, and
marvelling within himself at the deep wisdom of his words, said: "Of a
truth this man is the Ark of the Covenant and a repository of Holy
Writ".
