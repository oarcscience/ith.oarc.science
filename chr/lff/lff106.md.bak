### CHAPTER II

<span class="small">How St. Francis appeared to Friar Leo</span>

ON a time, after St. Francis had departed this life, there came upon
Friar Leo a desire to see that sweet father, whom, when alive, he had so
dearly loved; and, by reason of this desire, he began, beyond his wont,
to afflict his body with prayers and fastings; beseeching God with great
fervour that He would fulfil his desire. And so, while he was all
enkindled in that prayer, St. Francis appeared unto him all glorious
with wings, and he had talons upon his hands and upon his feet, like
unto those of an eagle, but gilded. And Friar Leo, being all gladdened
and consoled by this so marvellous apparition, said with wonder:
"Wherefore, my most venerable father, hast thou appeared unto me in so
strange a shape?" St. Francis made answer: "Among the other graces,
which have been given and granted unto me by the Divine compassion, are
these wings; to the end that, being invoked, I may straightway succour
the lovers of this holy Religion in their tribulations and necessities;
and may carry their souls and those of my friars, as it were flying, to
the supernal glory. These talons so great and strong and golden are
given me against the devil, against the persecutors of my Religion and
against the reprobate friars of this holy Order, that I may chastise
them with hard and grievous clawings

and cruel punishments." To the praise of Christ. Amen.
