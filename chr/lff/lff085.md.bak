### CHAPTER IX

<span class="small">How through the merits of Friar Giles, the soul of a
friend of a certain Preaching Friar was delivered from the pains of
Purgatory</span>

WHEN Friar Giles lay sick of that sickness whereof a few days after he
died, a friar of St. Dominic fell sick even unto death. Now this man had
a friend who was a friar; and the said friend, seeing him draw nigh unto
death, said unto the sick friar: "My brother, I desire that, if God
permit, thou return to me after thy death and tell me how thou farest".
The sick man promised to return if it should be possible. Friar Giles
died the same day, and, after his death, \[the said Preaching Friar\]
appeared unto the living Preaching Friar, and said: "It was the will of
God that I should keep my promise to thee". Said the living to the dead:
"How is it with thee?" The dead made answer: "It is well, because I died
on the same day whereon a holy Minor Friar, by name Friar Giles,
departed from this life, unto whom, by reason of his great sanctity,
Jesus Christ granted that he should lead to Paradise all the souls which
were in Purgatory, among whom was 1, in great torment; and by the merits
of Friar Giles I am delivered therefrom". And when he had said this he
suddenly vanished away; and that friar revealed not the vision to any
man. The said friar fell sick, and anon suspecting that God had

smitten him because he had not revealed the virtue and. the glory of
Friar Giles, he sent for the Minor Friars and there came unto him five
couples; and, when they were assembled, together with the Preaching
Friars, he revealed unto them the aforesaid vision with great devotion;
and after that they had inquired diligently, they found clearly that
they two had departed this life on the self-same day.
