### CHAPTER III

<span class="small">Of the manner of life which Friar Giles led when he
went to the Holy Sepulchre</span>

BY leave of St. Francis, Friar Giles went to visit the Holy Sepulchre of
Christ, and came to the port of Brindisi, and there he abode many days,
because no ship was ready. And Friar Giles, wishing to live by the
labour of his hands, begged a water-pot and filled it with water, and
went crying through the city: "Who wants water?" And by his labour he
gat him bread and the things necessary for the bodily life, both for
himself and for his companion; and thereafter, he crossed the sea and
visited the Holy Sepulchre of Christ and the other holy places with
great devotion. And, as he returned, he abode in the city of Ancona for
many days, and, because he was wont to live by the labour of his hands,
he made baskets of rushes and sold them, not for money but for bread for
himself and his companion, and he carried the dead to their burying for

the same wage. And, when this failed him, he returned to the table of
Jesus Christ, asking alms from door to door. And on this wise, with much
labour and poverty he returned to Santa Maria degli Angeli.
