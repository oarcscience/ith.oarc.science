### CHAPTER I

<span class="small">An ensample of Friar Leo, how St. Francis bade him
wash the stone</span>

IN the mountain of Alvernia, as St. Francis was I speaking with Friar
Leo, St. Francis said: "Friar little sheep, wash this stone with water".
Friar Leo hastened to obey and washed the stone with water. Said St.
Francis, with great joy and gladness: "Wash it with wine"; and so was it
done. " Wash it," said St. Francis, "with oil;" and so was it done. Said
St. Francis: "Friar little sheep, wash that stone with balm". Friar Leo
replied: "O sweet father, how can I get balm in so wild a place as this
is?" St. Francis made answer: "Know, friar little sheep of Christ, that
this is the stone where Christ sat when He appeared to me on a time in
this very place; and therefore have I said unto thee four times: 'Wash
it and hold thy peace '; for Jesus Christ hath promised me four singular
graces for my Order. The first is that all those who shall love my Order
from their hearts, and the friars who shall persevere, shall by the
Divine grace make a good end. The second is that the persecutors of this
holy Religion shall be notably

punished. The third is that no evil man shall be able to remain long in
this Order, continuing in his frowardness. The fourth is that this
Religion shall last even unto the last judgment."
