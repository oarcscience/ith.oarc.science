### CHAPTER OF THE TRUE RELIGION

FRIAR GILES used to say, speaking of himself: "I would rather have a
little of the grace of God, being a Religious in the Religion, than I
would have many graces of God being a layman and living in ''the world;
for in the world there are many more hindrances and perils, and much
less remedy and help than there is in the Religion." Also Friar Giles
said: "Meseemeth that sinful man feareth more his own good than he doth
his loss and hurt; for he feareth to enter into the Religion and to do
penance; but he feareth not to offend God and his soul, by remaining in
the hard and obstinate world, and in the loathesome mire of his sins,
awaiting his last eternal damnation". A layman asked Friar Giles,
saying: "Father, what dost thou counsel me to do? to enter the Religion
or to remain in the world doing good works?" To whom Friar Giles made
answer: "My brother,

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

certain is it that if any needy man knew that a great treasure was
hidden in the public land, he would not ask counsel of any person to
assure himself whether it would be well to dig it up and hide it in his
house; how much more should a man endeavour and hasten with all zeal and
diligence to possess himself of that celestial treasure which is to be
found in the holy Religious and spiritual congregations, without asking
so much advice!" And that layman, hearing this answer, forthwith
distributed that which he possessed among the poor, and thus despoiled
of everything, forthwith entered the Religion. Friar Giles was wont to
say: "Many men enter the Religion, and yet do not put into effect and
operation those things which belong to the perfect state of the holy
Religion; but these men are like unto that ploughman who clad himself in
the armour of Orlando, and knew not how to fight or joust therewith.
Every man knoweth not how to ride a restive and vicious horse; and, even
if he rideth him, perchance he would not know how to keep himself from
falling, when the horse ran or grew restive." Also Friar Giles said: "I
hold it not a great thing that a man gaineth entrance to the court of
the king; nor do I hold it a great matter that he should know how to
obtain some graces or benefits from the king; but the great matter is
that he should know well how to remain and dwell and bear himself aright
in the court of the king, continuing to act prudently according to that
which is meet. The court of the great Celestial King is the holy
Religion, wherein it is not difficult to enter and to receive some gifts
and graces from God; but the great matter is that a man know well how to
live and bear himself and persevere therein with prudence even unto his
death." Likewise Friar Giles said: "Rather would I be a layman

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

and continually hope and desire with devotion to enter the Religion,
than I would be clad with the habit in the holy Religion, without the
practice of virtuous works, continuing in sloth and in negligence. And
therefore the Religious man should always strive to live well and
virtuously, knowing that he cannot live in any other state save only in
his Order." Once Friar Giles said: "Meseemeth that the Religion of the
Minor Friars was verily sent by God for the profit and great edification
of the people; but woe unto us friars, if we shall not be such men as we
ought to be! Certain it is that in this life men more blessed than we
could not be found; because holy is he who followeth him who is holy,
and he is truly good who walketh in the path of the good; and rich is he
who goeth in the footsteps of the rich; and the Religion of the Minor
Friars, more than any other Religion, followeth the footsteps and the
way of the most good, of the most rich and of the most holy that ever
was or ever shall be, to wit of our Lord Jesus Christ."
