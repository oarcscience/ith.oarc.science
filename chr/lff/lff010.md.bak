### CHAPTER VII

<span class="small">How St. Francis passed a Lent in an island of the
lake of Perugia, where he fasted forty days and forty nights, and ate no
more than one half loaf</span>

INASMUCH as the faithful servant of Christ, St. Francis, was in certain
things well-nigh another Christ, given to the world for the salvation of
mankind, God the Father willed to make him in many actions conformed and
like unto His Son Jesus Christ; as is made manifest in the venerable
College of the

and in the admirable mystery of the sacred stigmata, and in the unbroken
fast of the holy Lent which he made on this wise. On a time, St Francis
being, on the day of Carnival, hard by the lake of Perugia, in the house
of one of his disciples, with whom he had lodged during the night, he
was inspired by God to go and keep that Lent in an island of the lake;
wherefore St. Francis besought this disciple of his that, for the love
of Christ, he would carry him in his skiff to an island of the lake,
whereon no man dwelt, and that he, would do this on the night of Ash
Wednesday to the end that none might know thereof; and he, for the love
of the great devotion which he bare St. Francis, diligently fulfilled
his request and carried him to the said island; and St. Francis took
with him nothing save two small loaves. And, when he had landed upon the
island, and his friend was about to depart and to return to his house,
St. Francis besought him lovingly that he would not reveal to any man
that he was there, and that he would not come for him until Holy
Thursday; and so he departed. And St. Francis remained alone, and, in
that there was no dwelling there, wherein he might find shelter, he
entered into a very dense thicket, which many brambles and bushes had
made like unto a cave or little but; and in this place he set himself in
prayer to contemplate celestial things. And there he abode all Lent
without eating and without drinking anything save only half of one of
those little loaves, according to that which his disciples found on Holy
Thursday when he returned to him; for he found of the two little loaves
one whole and half of the other. It is believed that St. Francis ate for
reverence of the fast of Christ the blessed, who fasted forty days and
forty nights without taking any earthly food; and on this

wise, with that half loaf, he cast forth from himself the poison of
vainglory, and after the ensample of Christ fasted forty days and forty
nights. Thereafter, in that place where St. Francis had shown such
marvellous abstinence, God did many miracles through his merits; for
which cause men began to build houses there and to dwell there; and, in
a little while, a walled village, fair and great, was made there, and
withal the Place of the friars, which is called the Place of the Island,
and the men and women of that village still have kept great reverence
and devotion for that place where St. Francis kept the said Lent.
