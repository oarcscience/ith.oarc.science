### CHAPTER X

<span class="small">How God had given graces unto Friar Giles, and of
the year of his death</span>

FRIAR BUONAVENTURA of Bagnoreggio was wont to say of Friar Giles that
God had given and granted unto him special grace for all those who
commended themselves unto him with devout intention as touching those
things which appertain unto the soul. He wrought many miracles in his
life, and after his death, as appeareth from his Legend; and he passed
from this life to the glory supernal in the year of Our Lord M.CC.LII.,
(1252) on the day of the Feast of St. George, and was buried at Perugia
in the convent of the Minor Friars.
