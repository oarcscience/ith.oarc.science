### CHAPTER II

<span class="small">Ensample of the great power of Friar Juniper against
the devil</span>

THAT the demons were not able to endure the purity of innocence and the
profound humility of Friar Juniper appeareth in this ensample following,
to wit that once a demoniac, contrary to every wont of his, and with
passing strange violence, suddenly leaped out of the road, and, running
very swiftly, fled for seven miles through divers by-paths; and, being
asked by his kinsfolk, which with great grief followed after him,
wherefore he had so strangely fled away, he made answer: "The reason is
this; because that madman Juniper was passing along that road; and not
being able to endure his presence or to wait, I fled into these woods" .
And certifying themselves of this truth, they found that Friar Juniper
had passed at that hour, even as the demon had said. Wherefore St.
Francis, when demoniacs were brought unto him that he might heal them,
if the devils departed not immediately at his command, was wont to say:
"If thou dost not forthwith depart from this creature, I will cause
Friar Juniper to come against thee"; and then the devil, fearing the
presence of Friar Juniper, and unable to endure the virtue and humility
of St. Francis, departed immediately.
