### CHAPTER XII

<span class="small">How Friar Juniper was rapt in ecstasy during the
celebration of the Mass</span>

ONCE while Friar Juniper was hearing Mass with great devotion, he was
rapt in ecstasy through elevation of mind and for a long time; and
having been left in a cell far away from the other friars, when he
returned to himself he began, with great fervour, to say: "O friars
mine, who is there in this life so noble that he would not gladly carry
a basket of dung through all the town, if he were given a house full of
gold?" And he said: "Alack! wherefore are we unwilling to suffer a
little shame, if so be we may gain the blessed life?"
