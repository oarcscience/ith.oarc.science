### CHAPTER L

<span class="small">How, as he said Mass on the day of the dead, Friar
John of Alvernia saw many souls liberated from purgatory</span>

immediately he beheld an almost infinite multitude of souls coming forth
from purgatory, like the sparks of fire innumerable, which fly from a
blazing furnace; and he saw them rise up to heaven, through the merits
of the passion of Christ, who every day is offered for the living and
the dead in that most sacred Host, the which is worthy to be adored in
*sæcula sæculorum*.
