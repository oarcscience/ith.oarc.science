### CHAPTER IV

<span class="small">How Friar Giles praised obedience more than
prayer</span>

ONCE a friar was in his cell at prayer, and his Guardian sent unto him
bidding him by virtue of obedience to go and beg for alms. Wherefore he
straightway went to Friar Giles and said: "My father, I was at prayer,
and the Guardian hath commanded me to go for bread; and to me it seemeth
that it were better to continue in prayer". Friar Giles made answer: "My
son, hast thou as yet neither learned nor understood what manner of
thing is prayer True prayer is that a man should do the will of his
Superior; and it is a sign of great pride in him who hath put his neck
beneath the yoke of holy obedience, when, for any cause, he shunneth it,
to do his own will, albeit to him it seemeth that thereby he doth a more
perfect work. The perfectly obedient Religious is like unto the knight
who is mounted upon a goodly horse, by the excellence whereof he goeth
without fear along the midst of the road; and, on the contrary, the
disobedient Religious, grumbling and unwilling, is like unto one who is
mounted upon a thin, weak and vicious horse, because, when he hath
endured but a little fatigue, he either falleth down dead or is taken by
the enemy. I tell thee that if a man were so devout and of such
elevation of mind that he spake with Angels, and, while he thus spake,
were called by his

forthwith to leave the converse of the Angels and to obey him who is set
over him."
