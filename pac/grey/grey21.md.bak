# The Art of Netting Learned by Kahukura from the Fairies

### Ko Te Korero Mo Nga Patupaiarehe

ONCE upon a time, a man of the name of Kahukura wished to pay a visit to
Rangiaowhia, a place lying far to the northward, near the country of the
tribe called Te Rarawa. Whilst he lived at his own village, he was
continually haunted by a desire to visit that place. At length he
started on his journey, and reached Rangiaowhia, and as he was on his
road, be passed a place where some people had been cleaning mackerel,
and he saw the inside of the fish lying all about the sand on the
sea-shore: surprised at this, he looked about at the marks, and said to
himself: 'Oh, this must have been done by some of the people of the
district.' But when he came to look a little more narrowly at the
footmarks, he saw that the people who had been fishing had made them in
the night-time, not that morning, nor in the day; and he said to
himself: 'These are no mortals who have been fishing here--spirits must
have done this; had they been men, some of the reeds and grass which
they sat on in their canoe would have been lying about.' He felt quite
sure from several circumstances, that spirits or fairies had been there;
and after observing everything well, he returned to the house where he
was stopping. He, however, held fast in his heart what he had seen, as
something very striking to tell all his friends in every direction, and
as likely to be the means of gaining

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

knowledge which might enable him to find out something new.

So that night he returned to the place where he had observed all these
things, and just as he reached the spot, back had come the fairies too,
to haul their net for mackerel; and some of them were shouting out: 'The
net here! the net here!' Then a canoe paddled off to fetch the other in
which the net was laid, and as they dropped the net into the water, they
began to cry out: 'Drop the net in the sea at Rangiaowhia, and haul it
at Mamaku.' These words were sung out by the fairies, as an
encouragement in their work and from the joy of their hearts at their
sport in fishing.

As the fairies were dragging the net to the shore, Kahukura managed to
mix amongst them, and hauled away at the rope; he happened to be a very
fair man, so that his skin was almost as white as that of these fairies,
and from that cause he was not observed by them. As the net came close
in to the shore, the fairies began to cheer and shout: 'Go out into the
sea some of you, in front of the rocks, lest the nets should be
entangled at Tawatawauia by Teweteweuia', for that was the name of a
rugged rock standing out from the sandy shore; the main body of the
fairies kept hauling at the net, and Kahukura pulled away in the midst
of them.

When the first fish reached the shore, thrown up in the ripple driven
before the net as they hauled it in, the fairies had not yet remarked
Kahukura, for he was almost as fair as they were. It was just at the
very first peep of dawn that the fish were all landed, and the fairies
ran hastily to pick them up from the sand, and to haul the net up on the
beach. They did not act with their fish as men do, dividing them into
separate loads for each, but every one took up what fish he liked, and
ran a twig through their gills, and as they strung the fish, they
continued calling out: 'Make haste, run

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

here, all of you, and finish the work before the sun rises.'

Kahukura kept on stringing his fish with the rest of them. He had only a
very short string, and, making a slip-knot at the end of it, when he had
covered the string with fish, he lifted them up, but had hardly raised
them from the ground when the slip-knot gave way from the weight of the
fish, and off they fell; then some of the fairies ran good-naturedly to
help him to string his fish again, and one of them tied the knot at the
end of the string for him, but the fairy had hardly gone after knotting
it, before Kahukura had unfastened it, and again tied a slip-knot at the
end; then he began stringing his fish again, and when he had got a great
many on, up he lifted them, and off they slipped as before. This trick
he repeated several times, and delayed the fairies in their work by
getting them to knot his string for him, and put his fish on it. At last
full daylight broke, so that there was light enough to distinguish a
man's face, and the fairies saw that Kahukura was a man; then they
dispersed in confusion, leaving their fish and their net, and abandoning
their canoes, which were nothing but stems of the flax. In a moment the
fairies started for their own abodes; in their hurry, as has just been
said, they abandoned their net, which was made of rushes; and off the
good people fled as fast as they could go. Now was first discovered the
stitch for netting a net, for they left theirs with Kahukura, and it
became a pattern for him. He thus taught his children to make nets, and
by them the Maori race were made acquainted with that art, which they
have now known from very remote times.
