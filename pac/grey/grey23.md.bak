# The Loves of Takarangi and Rau-mahora

THERE was, several generations since, a chief of the Taranaki tribe,
named Rangirarunga. His pa was called Whakarewa; it was a large pa,
renowned for the strength of it fortifications. This chief had a very
beautiful daughter, whose name was Rau-mahora; she was so celebrated for
her beauty that the fame of it had reached all parts of these islands,
and had, therefore, come to the ears of Te Rangi-apitirua, a chief of
the Ngati-Awa tribes, to whom belonged the pa of Puke-ariki, on the hill
where the Governor's house stood in New Plymouth. This chief had a son
named Takarangi; he was the hero of his tribe. He, too, naturally heard
of the beauty of Rau-mahora; and it may be that his heart sometimes
dwelt long on the thoughts of such great loveliness.

Now in those days long past, there arose a war between the tribes of Te
Rangi-apitirua and of the father of Rau-mahora; and the army of the
Ngati-Awa tribes marched to Taranaki, to attack the *pa* of
Rangirarunga, and the army invested that fortress, and sat before it
night and day, yet they could not take it; they continued nevertheless
constantly to make assaults upon it, and to attack the garrison of the
fortress, so that its inhabitants became worn out from want of
provisions and water, and many of them were near dying.

At last the old chief of the pa, Rangirarunga, overcome by thirst, stood
on the top of the defences of the pa, and cried out to the men of the
enemy's army: 'I pray you to give me one drop of water.'

\[paragraph continues\] Some of his enemies, pitying the aged man, said:
'Yes'; and one ran with a calabash to give him water. But the majority
being more hard-hearted were angry at this, and broke the calabash in
his hands, so that not a drop of water reached the poor old man; and
this was done several times, whilst his enemies continued disputing
amongst themselves.

The old chief still stood on the top of the earthen wall of the
fortress, and he saw the leader of the hostile force, with the symbols
of his rank fastened on his head: he wore a long white comb, made from
the bone of a whale, and a plume of the long downy feathers of the white
heron, the emblems of his chieftainship. Then was heard by all, the
voice of the aged man as he shouted to him from the top of the wall:
'Who art thou? And the other cried out to him: 'Lo, he who stands here
before you is Takarangi.' And the aged chief of the pa called down to
him: 'Young warrior, art thou able to still the wrathful surge which
foams on the hidden rocks of the shoal of O-rongo-mai-ta-kupe?' meaning:
'Hast thou, although a chief, power to calm the wrath of these fierce
men?' Then proudly replied to him the young chief: 'The wrathful surge
shall be stilled; this arm of mine is one which no dog dares to bite',
meaning that no plebeian hand dared touch his arm, made sacred by his
deed and rank, or to dispute his will. But what Takarangi was really
thinking in his heart was: 'That dying old man is the father of
Rau-mahora, of that so lovely maid. Ah, how I should grieve if one so
young and innocent should die tormented with the want of water.' Then he
arose, and slowly went to bring water for that aged man, and for his
youthful daughter; and he filled a calabash, dipping it up from the cool
spring which gushes up from the earth, and is named Oringi. No word was
spoken, or movement made, by the crowd of fierce and angry men, but all,
resting

upon their arms, looked on in wonder and in silence. Calm lay the sea,
that was before so troubled, all timid and respectful in the lowly
hero's presence; and the water was taken by Takarangi, and by him was
held up to the aged chief; then was heard by all, the voice of
Takarangi, as he cried aloud to him, 'There; said I not to you: "No dog
would dare to bite this hand of mine?" Behold the water for you--for you
and for that young girl.' Then they drank, both of them, and Takarangi
gazed eagerly at the young girl, and she too looked eagerly at
Takarangi; long time gazed they, each one at the other; and as the
warriors of the army of Takarangi looked on, lo, he had climbed up and
was sitting at the young maiden's side; and they said amongst
themselves: 'O comrades, our lord Takarangi loves war, but one would
think he likes Rau-mahora almost as well.'

At last a sudden thought struck the heart of the aged chief, of the
father of Rau-mahora; so he said to his daughter: 'O my child, would it
be pleasing to you to have this young chief for a husband?'--and the
young girl said: 'I like him.' Then the old man consented that his
daughter should be given as a bride to Takarangi, and he took her as his
wife. Thence was that war brought to an end, and the army of Takarangi
dispersed, and they returned each man to his own village, and they came
back no more to make war against the tribes of Taranaki--for ever were
ended their wars against them.

And the descendants of Rau-mahora dwell here in Wellington. They are Te
Puni, and all his children, and his relatives. For Takarangi and
Rau-mahora had a daughter named Rongouaroa, who was married to Te Whiti;
and they had a son named Aniwaniwa, who married Tawhirikura; and they
had a son named Rerewha-i-te-rangi, and he married Puku, who was the
mother of Te Puni.
