# The Legend of Poutini and Whaiapu

### The Discovery of New Zealand

NOW pay attention to the cause of the contention which arose between
Poutini and Whaiapu, which led them to emigrate to New Zealand. For a
long time they both rested in the same place, and Hine-tu-a-hoanga, to
whom the stone Whaiapu <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) belonged,
became excessively enraged with Ngahue, and with his prized stone
Poutini <span id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_12.md). At last she drove Ngahue
out and forced him to leave the place, and Ngahue departed and went to a
strange land, taking his jasper. When Hine-tu-a-hoanga saw that he was
departing with his precious stone, she followed after them, and Ngahue
arrived at Tuhua with his stone, and Hine-tu-a-hoanga arrived and landed
there at the same time with him, and began to drive him away again. Then
Ngahue went to seek a place where his jasper might remain in peace, and
be found in the sea this island Aotearoa (the northern island of New
Zealand), and he thought he would land there.

Then he thought again, lest he and his enemy should be too close to one
another, and should quarrel again, that it would be better for him to go
farther off with his jasper, a very long way off. So he carried it off
with him, and they coasted along,

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

and at length arrived at Arahura (on the west coast of the middle
island), and he made that an everlasting resting-place for his jasper;
then he broke off a portion of his jasper, and took it with him and
returned, and as be coasted along lie at length reached Wairere
(believed to be upon the east coast of the northern island), and he
visited Whangaparaoa and Tauranga, and from thence he returned direct to
Hawaiki, and reported that he had discovered a new country which
produced the moa and jasper in abundance. He now manufactured sharp axes
from his jasper; two axes were made from it, Tutauru and
Hau-hau-te-rangi. He manufactured some portions of one piece of it into
images for neck ornaments, and some portions into ear ornaments; the
name of one of these ear ornaments was Kaukau-matua, which was recently
in the possession of Te Heuheu, and was only lost in 1846, when he was
killed with so many of his tribe by a landslip. The axe Tutauru was only
lately lost by Purahokura and his brother Reretai, who were descended
from Tama-ihu-toroa. When Ngahue, returning, arrived again in Hawaiki,
he found them all engaged in war, and when they heard his description of
the beauty of this country of Aotea, some of them determined to come
here.

Construction of Canoes to Emigrate to New Zealand

They then felled a totara tree in Rarotonga, which lies on the other
side of Hawaiki, that they might build the Arawa from it. The tree was
felled, and thus the canoe was hewn out from it and finished. The names
of the men who built this canoe were, Rata, Wahie-roa, Ngahue, Parata,
and some other skilful men, who helped to hew out the Arawa and to
finish it.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

A chief of the name of Hotu-roa, hearing that the Arawa was built, and
wishing to accompany them, came to Tama-te-kapua and asked him to lend
him his workmen to hew out some canoes for him too, and they went and
built and finished Tainui and some other canoes.

The workmen above mentioned are those who built the canoes in which our
forefathers crossed the ocean to this island, to Aotea-roa. The names of
the canoes were as follows: the Arawa was first completed, then Tainui,
then Matatua, and Taki-tumu, and Kura-hau-po, and Tokomaru, and
Matawhaorua. These are the names of the canoes in which our forefathers
departed from Hawaiki, and crossed to this island. When they had lashed
the topsides on to the Tainui, Rata slew the son of Manaia, and bid his
body in the chips and shavings of the canoes. The names of the axes with
which they hewed out these canoes were Hauhau-te-Rangi, and Tutauru.
Tutauru was the axe with which they cut off the head of Uenuku.

All these axes were made from the block of jasper brought back by Ngahue
to Hawaiki, which was called 'The fish of Ngahue'. He had previously
come to these islands from Hawaiki, when he was driven out from thence
by Hine-tu-a-hoanga, whose fish or stone was obsidian. From that cause
Ngahue came to these islands; the canoes which afterwards arrived here
came in consequence of his discovery.
