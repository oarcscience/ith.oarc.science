### MATS.

The natives excel in the. manufacture of fine mats, specimens of which
will be found in our collection. They are made of bulrushes obtained
from the craters in the vicinity of the lakes formed by the collection
of the rain-water. They are woven by hand, and fine specimens are highly
prized.
