### TRADITION REGARDING FISH HOOKS.

In the time, of Atua Ure Rangi, the Seventeenth king, the image-makers
were exempt from all other kinds of work, and the fishermen were taxed
for their chief support. The fish-hooks in use were made of stone, so
hard that many months of chipping and grinding were required to fashion
one fit for service, and the most perfect hooks, even in the hands of
expert fishermen, permitted the escape of a large proportion of the
fish. A youth named Urevaiaus, who was descended from a long line of
fishermen, living at Hanga Pico, became prominent as one of the most
skillful fishermen on the island. His outfit contained hooks bequeathed
to him by his forefathers, but he became discouraged by the want of
success which he thought his labors demanded, and much time was devoted
to a consideration of the subject. One day, after a number of large and
choice fish had escaped from his hooks, he determined to spend the
entire night in the worship of the god Mea Kahi. About midnight, while
he was still at his devotions, the spirit of an ancient fisherman named
Tirakoka appeared, and made known the fact that his want of success was
due to the inefficiency of the hooks. The spirit directed him to go to
the cave in which his father's remains had been interred, and secure a
piece of the thighbone, out of which a proper hook might be constructed.
Urevaiaus became so much frightened by his interview with the spirit,
that he failed to remember fully all the instructions that had been
given, but he went to the cave the next day and secured the thigh-bone
of his paternal parent. For many days he went out in his canoe
regularly, but instead of fishing his entire attention was devoted to
the manufacture of an improved hook. During this period his boat
returned empty every evening, and his want of success excited the open
ridicule of his companions and the concern of his friends, but he
persevered until he had fashioned a bone-hook with barbed point.

When ready to test his new invention, a place was selected at a distance
from his companions, and his boat was quickly filled with the finest
fish. The extraordinary success of the young fisherman, in time excited
the envy and jealousy of his companions, and his persistent refusal of
all inducements to part with the secret led to a serious quarrel and
bitter enmity. A sudden attack was finally planned upon Urevaiaus while
at work upon the fishing-grounds; in effort to preserve his secret the
youth lost his life; but the new form of hooks was found in his boat and
the invention became known to the fraternity.
