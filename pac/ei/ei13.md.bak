### NATIVES.

The population of Easter Island is not stated in actual figures by any
of the traditions or legends, but all agree in the statement that the
different districts were peopled by numerous and powerful clans who were
constantly at war with each other. The immense amount of work performed
by the image-makers and platform builders would indicate the employment
of a great many persons, if accomplished within a reasonable limit of
time, or the extension over several centuries, if the undertaking was
carried out by successive generations. The ruins of extensive
settlements near Tahai Bay Kotatake plains, around Puka Manga-Manga
mountain, the Rana-Hana-Kana coast, the vicinity of Anakena, the shores
of La Pérouse Bay, and extending along the coast from Tongariki to
Vinapu in an almost unbroken line, would prove either the presence of
numerous inhabitants, or a frequent change of location. The limited area
of the 32 square miles of surface available for cultivation precludes
the idea of any very dense population, and many reasons might be
assigned for a frequent change of habitation. We know that the stone
houses at Orango were only occupied daring the feast of "bird eggs." The
image-builders engaged in the quarries of Rana Roraka probably lived at
Tongariki, and entire communities may have changed location at different
seasons of the year from failure of water supply, or some equally
sufficient reason.

The early Spanish voyagers estimated the population at between 2,000 and
3,000. Admiral Roggeveen states that he was surrounded by several
thousand natives before he opened fire upon them. Captain Cook,
fifty-two years later, placed the number at between 600 and 700, and
Foster, who was with him, estimated them at 900. Twelve years later
(1786) La Pérouse placed the population at 2,000. Bushey (1825) puts the
number at about 1,500. Kotzebue and Lisiansky make more liberal
estimates. Equally chimerical and irreconcilable deductions are made by
recent writers. Mr. A. A. Salmon, after many years' residence on the
island, estimates the population between 1850 and 1860 at nearly 20,000.
The diminution of the actual number of inhabitants progressed rapidly
from 1863, when the majority of the able-bodied men were kidnaped by the
Peruvians, and carried away to work in the guano deposits of the Chincha
Islands, and plantations in Peru. Only

few of these unfortunates were released, and all but two of them died
upon the return voyage, from small-pox. The disease was introduced on
the shore and nearly decimated the island in a short time. An old man
called Pakomeo is at, present the only survivor of those returned from
slavery, and he is eloquent in the description of the barbarous
treatment received from the hands of the Peruvians. In 1864 a Jesuit
mission was established on the island, and through the teachings of
Frère Eugene, the ancient customs and mode of life were replaced by
habits of more civilized practice.

H. M. S. *Topaze* visited the island in 1868. At that time the
population was about 900, one-third of the number being females. In 1875
about 500 persons were removed to Tahiti under contract to work in the
sugar plantations of that island. In 1878 the mission station was
abandoned, and about 300 people followed the missionaries to the Gambier
Archipelago.

Mr. Salmon took a complete census of the people just before the arrival
of the *Mohican*, and we were furnished with a list containing the names
of every man, woman, and child on the island. The total number of
natives is at present 155. Of these 68 are men, 43 women, 17 boys under
fifteen years of age, and 27 girls of corresponding age. The population
has been for several years at a standstill, the births and deaths being
about equal in numbers. The longevity of the islanders appears to
compare favorably with the natives of more favored lands. The oldest man
among them is a chief called Mati; his actual age is not known, but he
must be upwards of ninety, and his wife is nearly of the same age.

The last king was kidnaped by the Peruvians and died in captivity, but
his nearest descendant is a sturdy old fellow (Fig. 2) called Kaitae,

about eighty years of age. The simple mode of life, frugal diet, freedom
from care and anxiety, with regular habits, are favorable to the
longevity of the race.
