### RANA RORAKA.

The day was devoted to the examination of the inside of the crater of
Rana Roraka. The walls of the crater are very abrupt except on the west
side, where the lava-flow escaped to the sea, and here the cattle and
horses find easy access to the pool of water that has collected in the
bottom. High up on the southern side are the workshops of the
image-builders, extending in irregular terraces quite to the top. Here
we found images in all stages of incompletion (Fig. 10), from the rude

outline drawing to the finished statue ready to be cut loose from its

modus operandi

appears to have been to select a suitable rock upon which the image was
sketched in a reclining position. The upper surface having been carved
into shape and entirely finished, the last work was to cut the back
loose from the rock. This necessitated the exercise of great care to
prevent the breaking off of exposed portions, and was accomplished by
building piles of stones to sustain the weight while it was being
undermined.

Sixty-three statues in all similar to those shown in Figs. 11 and 12,
were counted inside the crater, and of these forty are standing up,
completed and ready to be transported to the platforms for which they
were

intended. They stand well down towards the bottom of the slope, and are
more or less buried in the earth by the washings from above, as shown in
Figs. 13 and 14.

The work of lowering the huge images from the upper terraces to the
bottom of the crater and thence over the wall and down into the plain
below, was of great magnitude, and we are lost in wonder that so much
could be accomplished by rude savages ignorant of everything in the way
of mechanical appliances. The average weight of these statues would be
something between 10 and 12 tons, but some are very large and would
weigh over 40 tons. It, is possible that a slide was made, upon which
the images were launched to the level ground below; a number of broken
and damaged figures lie in a position to suggest that idea, but from the
bottom of the crater they were transported up and over the wall and
thence over hill and dale to various points all over the island.
Excavations were made at different points inside the

<span id="page_494">p. 494</span>

crater, but nothing was found of interest beyond a few broken stone
implements that had. no doubt been used by the image-builders.

December 27.--We made an early start and visited the image-builders'
workshops on the west side of Rana Roraka, which are much more extensive
than those on the inside of the crater. These workshops commence well up
on the side of the mountain and extend quite to the summit by irregular
terraces. In places these terraces extend one above another with
unfinished images upon each, and the configuration of the land is such
as to preclude all idea of launching the statues by means of a slide. We
were unable to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion as to how the
immense statues on the upper tier of works' could be moved to the plain
below, passing over the underlying cavities where similar works had been
quarried. We know the natives had ropes made of hemp, two kinds of which
are indigenous to the island, but it is difficult to conjecture how
these heavy weights were handled without mechanical appliances. One
hundred and fifty-five images were counted upon this slope in various
stages, including those standing at the base of the mountain finished
and complete, ready for removal

<span id="page_495">p. 495</span>

to the platforms. Many of the images in the workshops are of huge
proportions, but the largest one on the island lies on one of the
central terraces in an unfinished condition and measures 70 feet in
length, 14½ feet across the body; the head being 28½ feet long. Some of
the standing statues are in as perfect condition as the day they were
finished.

One (Fig. 15) is noticeable from the fact that the head is slightly
turned to one side and is known as the "wry-neck," but whether it is the
result of accident or design could not be determined.

Another excellent specimen (Fig. 16) of these remarkable figures stands
near the last mentioned and shows tool-marks around the neck as though
an effort had been made to cut the head off. The natives call this
"hiara" and have a tradition to the effect that it belonged to a
powerful clan who were finally defeated in war, and that their enemies
had made an attempt to destroy the statue by cutting off the head. The
story may be based only upon the mutilation, but the chances are that it
is founded upon fact.

Nothing of importance was found by digging about the images or in the
workshops except broken stone implements which had been used by the
builders. In one of the quarries we found the only trace of sculptured
figures in the vicinity.

These emblems were carved upon a smooth rock over a half-finished image.

December 28-Shortly after daylight the entire force started making
excavations under the foundations of the image-builders houses, the
ruins of which extend towards Rana Roraka from Tongariki Bay, on regular
terraces. These peculiar ruins are to be found here in great numbers
both inside and outside of the crater, but do not differ from those
already described. A custom obtained among the islanders, similar to
that practiced by the tribes of Alaska and other Indian, of America, of
burying something of interest or value beneath the doorposts of their
dwellings. Usually it was a smooth beach pebble which was supposed to
have some fetish qualities to bring good luck or ward off evil
influences.

One of the largest of these ruins has an extensively paved terrace in
front. At a depth of about three feet below the surface of the central
door-way, we found a rough angular flinty stone with a rudely carved
face upon it. A prominent ruin of the same description inside of the
crater, and another near the workshop on the outside, yielded a hard
stone upon which marks had been carved very similar to those on the
rocks at Orongo.
