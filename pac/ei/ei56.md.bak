### TRADITION REGARDING OBSIDIAN SPEAR-POINTS.

The implements of warfare brought to the island by King Hotu Matua and
his followers were few in number, and in the course of time became
broken, lost, or destroyed. The clans were continually at war with each
other, but from the want of proper weapons the most desperate encounters
resulted in little loss of life. Spears were improvised with heads made
of the sharp edges of the calabash, but they proved in efficient weapons
and did little execution. During the reign of Atura-ugi, the sixth king,
a man living near the crater of the Rana Kau, while returning to his
home after sundown from Temanevai, where he and his companions had been
engaged in a useless struggle, stepped in the darkness upon a sharp
stone that cut his foot like a knife. He carried the stone home with
him, and in the morning found it to be black volcanic glass, which upon
being broken showed vitreous edges such as had cut his foot. Believing
he had discovered an effective material for the manufacture of
war-heads, he substituted the obsidian for the calabash points and went
forth to meet his enemies. The new weapon proved more puissant than he
had hoped for, and havoc was created in the ranks of his opponents.
Armed with spear-heads obtained from the obsidian mountain Orito, the
discoverer and his clan swept everything before them until the new
material became known to all the

people. Since the time of this discovery the encounters of the islanders
are characterized as more sanguinary.
