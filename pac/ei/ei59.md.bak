### LIST OF ETHNOGRAPHIC SPECIMENS OBTAINED AT EASTER ISLAND.

Wooden image.--Called Moai Tangata. Male figure made of toromiro wood,
with eyes of bone and obsidian. (Plate L, fig. l.)

Wooden image.--Called Moai Kva-kva. Male figure made of toromiro wood,
with eyes of bone and obsidian, and breast-bone and ribs sharply
defined. (Plate L, fig. 2.)

Wooden image.--Called Moai Papaa. Female figure made of toromiro wood,
with eyes of bone and obsidian. (Plate L, fig. 3.)

These figures have been called household gods, and were never
worshipped, though they were regarded the representations of certain
spirits. Similar figures were made to represent deceased chiefs and

<span id="page_535">p. 535</span>

persons of note, and were given a place of honor at feasts and
ceremonies.

Stone image.--Called Moai Maea. Male figure; held in the same estimation
as those made of wood. (Plate LI, fig. l.)

Wooden clubs.--Called Ua. Made of toro-miro wood, 6 feet long, the point
slightly widened and the handle ornamented with a bi-fronted head with
eyes of bone and obsidian. These clubs were only used as batôns of
office by the chiefs, and the handle was supposed to represent the
effigy of the owner. (Plate LII, figs. 1 and 2.)

Wooden club.--Called Poa. Made of heavy wood, about 30 inches long,
gradually widened from the handle to a broad blade, rounded at the end.
These were used for fighting and were handled with great dexterity.

Wooden club.--Called Ao. Made of light wood, used as wands in dancing.
The flattened ends are sometimes ornamented with heads supposed to
represent females noted for skill and grace in this accomplishment.
(Plate LIII, figs. 1 and 2.)

Wooden club.--Called Ariiki. Made of toro-miro wood, the end being
turned at right angles from the short handle. The club is ornamented all
over with beads. This was the batôn of the king and used only by him.
Obtained with much difficulty and expense.

Calabash.--Called Hue Vai. Opened at the small end only, used as a water
vessel, and for domestic purposes.

Calabash.--Called Epu Moa. Known as the fowl gourd, and a superstition
ascribes a beneficial influence over the chickens fed and watered from
it.

Calabash.--Called Tata. Used chiefly in boats for bailing.

Calabash.--Very old specimen obtained from an ancient tomb, covered with
hieroglyphics similar to those found on the incised tablets. These
calabashes grow in profusion on the island, but are worthy of note on
account of the prominent place they occupy in the traditions, and
because the seed was introduced by the original settlers.

Fish-net.--Called Kupenga Maito. This form of net has been in use from
an early period, and is made from the fiber of wild hemp. Nets of
different sizes used in fishing, as well as those for fighting and other
purposes, were of similar material and mesh. (Plate XIII.)

Feather hat.--Called Vana-vana. Head-dress made of black and green
variegated feathers, used only in delivering a challenge to combat for
revenge. (Plate LIV, fig. l.)

Feather hat.--Called Han Kura-kura. Small head-dress of brown or red
feathers worn by soldiers in time of war. (Plate LIV, fig. 2.)

Feather hat.--Called Han Pan-ten-ki. Head-dress of long, black, green,
and variegated feathers worn by dancing-people. (Plate LIV, fig. 3.)

Feather hat.--Called Han Tara. Small head-dress of trimmed feathers

<span id="page_536">p. 536</span>

ornamented by long tail feathers behind; used by chiefs on occasions of
ceremony (Plate LIV, fig. 1.)

Feather hat.--Called Han Vaero. Head-dress used in dancing, and formerly
at marriage feasts. (Plate LV, fig. 1.)

Feather hat.--Called Han Hie-hie. Large and heavy head-dress made of
black feathers worn by chiefs as insignia of office. These hats are made
of chicken feathers secured by the quill ends to a foundation of knitted
hemp, intended to fit the head closely. They are frequently referred to
in the traditions. (Plate LV, fig. 2.)

Wallet.--Called Kare. Made from bulrushes taken from the crater of
Rana-Kau. (Plate LI, fig. 2.)

Mat.--Called Moenga. Made of bullrushes and used for sleeping mats.

Obsidian spear-points.--Plate LVI.--Large collection showing the nine
classes into which they are divided by the natives. Fig. 1, narrow leaf
shaped spear-head, called Mataa Nutakuku. Fig. 2, wide round-pointed
spear-head, called Mataa Rei-pure-pure-rova. Fig. 3, narrow and long.
pointed spear-head, called Mataa Neho-mango. Fig. 4, narrow spade-shaped
spear-head, called Mataa Hikutiveva. Fig. 5, Broad straight edged
spear-head, called Mataa-hae. Fig. 6, smooth round edged spear head,
called Mataa Aro-kiri. Fig. 7, broad fan-shaped spear-head, called Mataa
Nutu-kuku. Fig. 8, concave and convex sided spear-head, called Mama Roa.
Fig. 9, long sharp, irregular pointed spear-head, called Mataa
Hai-haerve. These spear-heads were fastened to poles about 8 feet long,
by lashings of hemp, and formed the chief weapon used by the natives in
their frequent strifes. They were thrown to a distance, as well as a
thrusting weapon, much after the manner in which the Zulus use their
assagais. The volcanic glass of which the points were made crops out at
many places on the island, but was chiefly obtained at the obsidian
mountain of Orito. Spear-heads of different shapes and sizes were
dependent upon individual taste and skill. The best samples in the
collection were purchased from Mr. Salmon; others were found in the
tombs and burial-places; and some were picked up on the old
battle-grounds.

Fetish-board.--Called Timoika. Broad, flat paddle made of whalebone. 30
inches long and 14 inches wide. This wand is used in working a charm
against an enemy. The injured individual while performing a sort of
convulsive dance, makes mystic movements with the paddle, meanwhile
muttering incantations in a monotonous tone. The result is believed to
be the speedy death of the person against whom the fetish is invoked.
(Plate LIII, fig. 3.)

Potato fetish.--Called Rapa. Small, light paddle double bladed, about 24
inches long, painted light red in color. It was used with appropriate
ceremonies at times when the potato crop was in danger from insects or
drought, and was believed to ward off and guard against evil spirits.
(Plate LIII, fig. 4.)

<span id="page_537">p. 537</span>

Stone adzes.--Called Toki. The collection comprises twenty-five
different sizes, called by distinctive names which signify the use for
which they are designed. Tools of this class were always used in a
wooden handle. (Plate LVII.)

Stone knife.--Called Roe. Ground down to a knife-blade with a point and
cutting edge, used principally for fashioning the eyes and faces of the
images. (Plate LI, fig. 3.)

Ax handles.--Miro Toki. Hard-wood, with natural joint, used for holding
stone implements. (Plate LVII.)

Fish god.--Called Mea Ika. This rough, in-shaped stone was one of the
objects really worshipped by the natives. Some of them bear evidences of
tool marks, but it does not appear that any effort was made to carve
them into shape or decorate them. These gods were never common, and were
possessed by communities or clans, and not by individuals. The legends
claim that they were all brought to the island by Hotu Matua and the
first settlers. (Plate LI, fig. 4.)

Bonito god.--Called Mea Kahi. A stone with apparently no distinguishing
characteristics, and nothing to merit the profound religious homage paid
to it. It is not clear why the bonito should have the distinction or a
separate god from the other fish, unless it be for the reason that it
appears in great numbers in these waters, and has always been highly
esteemed as an article of food. Fish always constituted an important
diet with the natives, and the abundance in which they were found was
ascribed to the faithful and constant adoration of these stone gods.
(Plate LI, fig. 5.)

Fowl god.--Called Mea Moa. A beach pebble with slight traces of
tool-marks, but it might readily be passed among other stones without
attracting attention. To the fowl god is ascribed the custody of
chickens, and its beneficial influence was secured by being placed under
a setting hen for a short time before the eggs were hatched. (Plate LI,
fig. 6.)

Stone Fish Hook.--Called Mugai Kihi. These primitive hooks, now very
rare on the island, were made of the hardest rock to be obtained, and
were ground into shape by long and constant rubbing. (Plate LVIII, fig.
3.)

Bone fish hooks.--Called Mugai Iri. In accordance with an ancient
superstition, these hooks were manufactured from the thigh-bones of
deceased fishermen. The curve was fashioned with a small barb which
prevented the escape of the fish. The form is so perfectly adapted to
the purpose that the natives still use their old bone hooks in
preference to those of European make. A fish-hook of similar design was
used by the Indians of Santa Cruz Island. (Plate LVIII, figs. 1 and 2.)

Incised tablets.--Called Hokau Rongo Rongo. Two specimens in excellent
state of preservation, showing the hieroglyphics used in the written
language (Plates XXXVIII-XLI.)

Double paddle.--Called Mata Kao-kao. Made of heavy wood, balanced

<span id="page_538">p. 538</span>

by wide blades ornamented with outlined faces. Used in the ancient
canoes in a similar manner to that practiced by the Indians of America.
(Plate LII, fig. 3.)

Ancient scull oars.--Called Mata Kao. Angular float of peculiar shape
and unique design attached to a long handle. Used for steering and
sculling very large canoes. Very old and highly prized by the islanders
as the only specimen of the scull-oar used by their ancestors. (Plate
LIX)

Human skulls.--Called Puoko Iri. Art examination of these skulls shows
very little difference between the crania of the present people and
those found in the most ancient tombs. Three specimens obtained from the
King's platform have hieroglyphics engraved upon them, which signify the
clan to which they belonged. (Plate L.)

Native cloth.--Called Hami Nua. Made of the inner bark of the hibiscus
and paper-mulberry trees. The manufacture of the "tappa" has now ceased
altogether. (Plate LI, fig. 7.)

Tattooing implements.--Called Ta Kona. Tools used for puncturing the
skin. Made of bird bones.

Needles.--Called Iri. Both bone and wooden needles used for sewing tappa
cloth, and other varieties for knitting meshes of nets. (Plate LX, fig.
1.)

Fetish stones.--Called Atua Mangaro. A collection obtained by digging
beneath the door-posts of the ancient dwellings. The majority are simply
beach pebbles; others have been formed by rubbing; and one is a
triangular-shaped stone with a face outlined upon it. These were placed
beneath the houses, with much ceremony, and were supposed to ward off
evil influences. (Plate LX, fig. 2.)

Neck ornaments.--Called Hoko Ngao. Carved wood in fanciful designs worn
during the dance.

Pigments.--Called Penetuli. Natural paints used by being ground down in
the heated juice of the sugar cane.

Frescoed slabs.--Taken from the inner walls and ceilings of the stone
houses at Orongo. (Plate XXIII.)

Fetish stones.--Buried under the corner-stones of the houses.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[534:1](ei58.htm#fr_0.md) Mahuta Ariiki had a son
who made the first stone image on the Island. This son died before his
father.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[534:2](ei58.htm#fr_2.md) These two kings reigned at
the same time. The son rebelled against his father, and finally killed
him.
