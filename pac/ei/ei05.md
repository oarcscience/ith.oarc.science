*Te Pito Te Henua, or Easter Island*, by William J. Thompson, \[1891\],

### CLIMATE.

The climate is not unlike that of Madeira, with one wet and one dry
season. From April to October the rainfall is copious, and in summer it
is limited to passing showers. The mean temperature at the time of our
visit (midsummer), in the shade, at 2 o'clock p. m., was between 78° and
80° Fah., and at 2 o'clock a. m. there was a fall of about 6 degrees.
The southeast trades blow fresh at the beginning and end of the season,
and make the climate salubrious and healthful. Our long fatiguing
matches, while making the exploration of the island, were not
accompanied with inconvenience from exposure to the direct rays of the
sun, the constant breezes making the sensible temperature always appear
lower than that recorded by the thermometer. Violent exercise induced
profuse perspiration, but evaporation was always free and rapid.
Electric storms are unknown.
