### CAVE AND TOMB NEAR AHUAKAPU POINT.

On the face of the cliff near the point, Ahuakapu, a large and
interesting cave, was visited. Many of the recesses and angles had been
walled up and contained human remains. Fossiliferous specimens of marine
animals were obtained by digging up the floor of the cave. The igneous
rocks in the vicinity show evidences of rude, sculptures, among which
could be traced canoes, fishes, and men in various attitudes. Upon the
extreme point we found another one of those round towers, built for the
purpose of observing the movements of turtles on the beach. The shaft
measures 24 feet, and stands in. the center of a narrow platform 67 feet
long, filled with tombs containing human remains that had long been
undisturbed, as evidenced by a luxuriant growth of lichens on the rough
rocks.
