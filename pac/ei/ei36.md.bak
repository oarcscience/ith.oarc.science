much time is possible was devoted to examining and sketching these
curious relies. The hard volcanic rock is covered by carvings intended
to represent human faces, birds, fishes, and mythical animals, all very
much defaced by the ravages of time and the elements (Plate XXIII). The
apparent age of some of the rock-carvings antedates the neighboring
stone houses, the images, and other relics of the island except the
ruined village on the bluff west of Kotatake Mountain. Fishes and
turtles appear frequently among these sculptures, but the most common
figure is a mythical animal, half human in form, with bowed back and
long claw-like legs and arms. According to the natives. this symbol was

pottery which I once dug up in Peru, while making excavations among the
graves of the Incas. The form is nearly identical, but, except in this
instance, no similarity was discovered between the relies of Easter
Island and the coast of South America.
