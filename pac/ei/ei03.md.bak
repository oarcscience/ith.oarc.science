### GEOLOGICAL FEATURES.

The geological features of the island are replete with interest. The
formation is purely of a volcanic character and embraces every variety
pertaining to that Basaltic, cellular, and tufaceous lavas abound in
diversified forms. The basaltic is generally porous and scoriform, but
on the slope of the hills the substrata are frequently as com pact and
dense is that of the coast-line. Near Anakena may be seen hills composed
of scoria quite as cellular as pumice, and in close proximity compact
beds having a dark blue basis, composed of crystals of glassy feldspar
and olivine. The cellular formation is mixed pumice and slag, in some
cases similar

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

to volcanic cinder, having the lightness and qualities of coke. In some
of the varieties the cavities are filled with olivine crystals partly
decomposed, but generally the cavities are empty. This lava when mixed
with feldspar is sometimes of gray color; not unfrequently several tints
of red may be seen, though the most common is a dark, lusterless brown.

The tufaceous lavas are extremely interesting, because they form the
most prominent feature in the physiognomy of the island. To this
geological structure, with the incessant action of the trade-winds and
heavy rains, is due the fact that the island is surrounded by
precipitous cliffs, rising in some cases to a thousand feet in height.
The formation is extremely friable, and by the action of the elements,
enormous masses are continually disappearing beneath the waves of the
sea that beat upon this unprotected shore. These tufas differ
considerably in consistency at the eastern end of the island. The
species is a fine light-red dust that is blown about by the wind and is
destitute of vegetation; towards the southwest end the basis is a
compact mud-like red clay, while the colossal crowns, intended to adorn
the gigantic statues, are carved out of a variety that has been
scorified in one of the craters, and is of a dull reddish color.

The ordinary rules for estimating the age of rocks by compactness can be
applied at Easter Island only hypothetically, because the scoriform and
more dense specimens are found immediately contiguous to one another. In
places they are quite conglomerated, as though older formations had been
disturbed by volcanic convulsions, while a new flow of lava enveloped
and sealed the whole into a heterogeneous mass. During our short stay on
the islands there was no opportunity to measure the lava flow or to make
investigations of that nature.

Natural caves are numerous, both on the coast-line and in the interior
of the island. Some of them are of undoubted antiquity and bear evidence
of having been used by the early inhabitants as dwellings and as burial
places. It is reported that small images, inscribed tablets, and other
objects of interest have been hidden away in such caves and finally lost
through land-slides.

The numerous bills on this island have gently sloping sides, except
where they approach the coast, falling at this point precipitously to
the sea. The plains are irregularly shaped, and some of the smaller ones
rise to a considerable height. The physical character of the soil is
alluvial. The substratum is volcanic ash and stones, and the upper
formation is composed of decayed vegetable matter mingled with a rich
deposit of decomposed lava washed down from hills by the frequent rains.
These plains being formed by the periodical eruptions of the volcanoes,
some difference may be noted in the quantity of the soil, varying
according to location.

After the successive discharges of lava from the craters of Rana Roraka
and Rana-kao had prescribed the limits of the island and when

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

this flow had ceased, there was a heavy deposit of mud, covering deeply
both hill and dale. This condensed earth, after the lapse of centuries,
has formed a soil that produces a natural grass affording an excellent
pasturage for flocks and herds. The expiring energy of the volcanic
power appears to have been directed, long after the formation of this
soil, to sprinkling thickly the entire surface of the island with stones
and small bowlders, thus providing the means of attraction and holding
the moisture, nature's substitute, as it were, for trees. The natives
have distinct names for the following varieties: Black and red tufa with
volcanic cinder and pumice are called "Maea-Hane-hane," "maea" being the
generic term applied to all stone. A soft gray tufa is ground down with
the juice of the sugar-cane and used as a paint. This is known as
"Kiri-kiri Teu." Hard slates, black, red, and gray, are used for stone
axes and called "Maea-Toke." Granite used for the same purpose is known
as "Maea-Nevhive." The hardest and finest stone implements are made of
the flinty beach pebble known as "Maea-Rengrengo." The hard cellular
stories from which the majority of the platforms are built are called
"Maea-Pupura." The material from which images were constructed is called
"Maea-Matariki," and the obsidian from which spear-heads were made is
known as "Maea-Mataa."
