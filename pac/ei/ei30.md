### BURIAL OF THE DEAD.

Hundreds of tombs, cairns, platforms, and catacombs were examined during
our stay on the island, and in all cases the bodies were lying at full
length. In a vault beneath platform No. 11 are a number of skulls packed
together in sufficient quantity to completely fill the
compartment--trophies of war perhaps, in view of the fact that the
skulls were those of adults; but in no single instance did we discover
the remains doubled up as the Incas and other American aborigines were
in the habit of burying their dead. In the early ages it was the custom
to wrap the corpse in dried grass, bound together by a mat made of
sedge, and whether laid in platform, cairn, or cave, the body was

usually laid with the head towards the sea. Succeeding generations
substituted tappa or native cloth for the sedge mat, and the present
people are sufficiently civilized to prefer rude coffins when the
material can be obtained. Cemeteries were located by the missionaries
near the churches at Vaihu and Mateveri, and strong efforts made to
discourage the burial of converted natives with their heathen ancestors,
but they were never able to overcome their aversion to promiscuous
interment.
