### THIEVING.

The natives did not attach any moral delinquency to the practice of
thieving. They had a god of thieving, and successful operations were
believed to be accomplished under his patronage, and only detected when
not sanctioned by that spirit. The detected thief was made to suffer for
his crime by an established system of retaliation peculiar to
themselves, but the individual never lost caste or the respect of his
friends. Thieves caught in the act might be beaten, knocked about, and
the aggressor was permitted to offer no resistance in the efforts to
escape, although he might be the largest and most powerful. Before the
retaliation could be enforced, the theft had to be proven and fixed
beyond question, then the plundered individual was at liberty to recover
the value of the loss from any property available belonging to the
robber, and in the event of the value not being recovered, articles of
value could be destroyed to equalize the amount. Retaliation for theft
could be enforced by the weak and feeble against the strong and
powerful, and, any resistance would call to their aid the entire
community.

The rite of circumcision, so common throughout Polynesia, is unknown
here, and their language contains no equivalent word for it. At the
present time, all the natives have professed Christianity, and the
ancient customs have been replaced by the ceremonies of the church to a
great extent, but since the departure of the missionaries there has been
a tendency to return to the old ideas, and many superstitions and
practices are mingled with their religion. The marriage ceremony is
performed by the acting priest in the church, but the practice is
permitted with children who have not reached the age of puberty, and the
betrothal is conducted by parents, the relations of the female paying a
stipulated amount, generally in food to be consumed by the friends at
the feast given to celebrate the event. It, is not certain that polygamy
ever existed, but an ancient custom permitted the husband to sell or
lease his wife to another for a stated term. On account of the
disproportion in the number of the sexes, celibacy was a matter of
necessity, and

probably originated this custom. Love of family is a strong trait in
their character; children are fondly cared for, and the desire for
offspring is general.
