This is an old song, supposed to have descended from the time the first
inhabitants arrived on the island. The father is believed to mourn for
his child left in that eastern land, from which tradition states the
People migrated.

#### ENGLISH TRANSLATION.

The sail of my daughter,  
  Never broken by the force of foreign clans!  
The sail of my daughter,  
  Unbroken by the conspiracy of Honiti!  
Ever victorious in all her fights  
  She could not be enticed to drink poison waters  
In the cup of obsidian glass.  
  Can my sorrow ever be appeased  
While we are divided by the mighty seas?  
  Oh my daughter, oh my daughter!  
It is a vast and watery road  
  Over which I look toward the horizon,  
My daughter, oh my daughter!  
  I'll swim over the deep to meet you,  
My daughter, oh my daughter!
