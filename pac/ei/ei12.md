### NETS AND ROPES

Various forms of fishing nets were manufactured, from the hand net to
the long seine called "kupenga maito," which was supported by poles at
the extremities, weighted with stone sinkers on the submerged edge and
floated by billets of wood on the surface (Plate XIII). Their

light casting-nets were used with great dexterity as they waded along
the beach, and when a shoal of small fish appeared, the net was thrown
with the right hand. These nets were remarkably made, and in the
manufacture a netting-needle of bone or wood was used, much after the
fashion in more civilized countries. The coarse nets and cordage was
made from the twisted bark of the *hibiscus*, and the fine ones from the
fiber of the indigenous hemp. From the strong heavy ropes used in
raising and transporting the colossal images to the light but durable
fish-lines, the threads were all twisted by hand, across the knee, into
even strands, which were multiplied according to the size and strength
required.
