### VARIOUS NAMES OF THE ISLAND.

Previous to the general recognition of the name bestowed by Admiral
Roggeveen in commemoration of the day upon which the land was
discovered, it had not been regularly christened by either of the
earlier navigators who claimed to have sighted it. The Spaniards
afterwards gave it the name of San Carlos, but the Dutchman's title of
Easter Island was preferred by the chart-makers and was adopted by the
world in general.

The island is known to the natives as "Te Pito te Henua," the literal
interpretation of the words signifying the "navel and uterus." This
singular name was given to the land, according to the ancient
traditions, by Hotu Metua immediately after its discovery, and has been
handed down through succeeding generations unchanged. To the
simple-minded Polynesian this name is suggestive, appropriate, and
beautiful. The child of nature recognizing the volcanic origin of the
island can see in the great volcano, Rana Roraka, a resemblance to the
human "te pito" in relation to its shape and gently sloping sides
surrounding the shallow crater. The same association of ideas would
picture the majestic volcano, Rana Kao, at the southwest end, as "te
henua," in whose womb was conceived the embryo and whose vitals brought
forth the rocks and earth from which the island was formed.

"Kiti te eiranga" is stated by an English writer of some note to be the
native name for the island, but we could not find any authority for it,
nor did the natives with whom we came in contact recognize the name.

Throughout southeastern Polynesia this island is known as Rapa Nui, but
the name is of accidental origin and only traces back about twenty
years. When the islanders, kidnaped by the Peruvians, were being
returned to their homes, there was for a time a question as to the
identity of those from Easter Island. The native name of "Te Pito te
Henua" was not recognized by the French officials, and finding certain
fellow-sufferers hailing from Oparo, an island lying 2,000 miles to the
westward, were more successful under the local appellation of Rapa iti
(Little Rapa), the euphonious title was dropped and Rapa nui (Great
Rapa) substituted. Teapy, Waihu, and various other names have been given
to the island, but clearly without warrant. Vaihu was the name of a
district and was occupied by the most powerful clan in the days of Cook
and La Pérouse, but it was never applied to the entire island.
