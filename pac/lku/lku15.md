Strewed the seeds, finest seeds of stars in the heavens;  
Strewed fine seed of gods, the sun became a god,  
Strewed the seeds from Hina; Lonomaku was formed like jelly,  
The food on which subsisted Hinahanaikamalama or Waka,  
Sought for by Wakea in the deep blue sea,  
In the coral mound, ’mongst rough waves,  
Causing Hinaiaa kamalama to float, a sprig,  
’Twas flung into his canoe, she was thereby called Hina the sprig;  
Taken ashore and warmed by the fire.  
Corals were born and eels were born,  
Sea-urchins were born, sea-eggs were born. <span id="page_73">p.

Blackstone was born, volcanic rocks were born,  
Whereby she was named Hinahalakoa.  
Hina wanted food and Wakea provided,  
Set his gods up and well bolstered,  
Set them nicely in a row;  
Then went after Hinakaweoa to be his wife.  
A fowl was born and clung to Wakea's back.  
’Twas a stain, this fowl that grew on the back of Wakea;  
Wakea grew angry and tried to brush it off;  
Wakea, provoked and annoyed,  
Shook it off, and it lit on the roof.  
That fowl on the roof,  
That fowl was a chief  
That came from the seed of Kaeoeo  
That climbs in space.  
The heavens did swing,  
The earth does swing  
In the starry space.
