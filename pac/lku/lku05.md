### THE FOURTH ERA.

#### FIRST VERSE.

Established in the dawn of Laa's light  
The Ape aumoa with faintest strife  
Envied the sea that washed the land,  
As it crept up and yet crept down  
And brought forth creeping families  
That crept on their backs and crept on their front,  
With pulses that beat in front and rounding backs,  
With faces in front and claws to feel  
Of darkness, of darkness,  
For Kaneaka Papanopano is born (dawn).  
So Popanopano the man  
And Polalowehi his wife, <span id="page_16">p. 16</span>  
Man was born to increase--  
To increase in the night by the thousands.  
At this age there is a lull--  
At this age take your children to the beach.  
Children play at heaping sands.  
They are the children born of night.  
Night was born.

#### SECOND VERSE.

Night was born of great delight,  
Night was rolled for the pleasure of gods,  
Night gave birth to the split-back turtle.  
Watch in the night for the land turtle.  
Night gave birth to the brown lobster,  
The night of commotion for the [Alii (?)](errata.htm#0.md) lobster,  
The birth night of the lazy monster  
Was a wet night for the rolling monster.  
Night gave birth to clinging beings,  
And Night loudly called for roughness.  
Night gave birth to wailing  
A night of drawback to oblivion,  
Night gave birth to high noses,  
Night dug deep for jelly fish,  
Night gave birth to slush,  
So the night must wait for motion.

#### THIRD VERSE.

Man by Waiololi, woman by Waiolola,  
The earth was born and lived by the sea;

Through a channel; the la-i is food, and creeps.

So the gods may enter, but not man.

#### TWELFTH VERSE.

The dancing motion till creeping crept  
With long and waving lengthy tail,  
And with humpy lumpy lashes sweeps  
And trails along in filthy places.  
These live on dirt and mire;  
Eat and rest, eat and throw up;  
They exist on filth, are low-born beings,  
Till to earth they become a burden  
Of mud that's made,  
Made unsafe, until one reels  
And is unsteady.,  
Go thou to the land of creepers,  
Where families of creepers were born in one night.  
                         ’Tis night.
