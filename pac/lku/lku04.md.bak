#### NINTH VERSE.

This is the leaping point of the bird Halulu  
Of Kiwaa, the bird of many notes,  
And of those birds that fly closely together as to shade the sun,  
They cover the land with their young to the rock's edge,  
Their gall burst easily with a smack  
As the Ape sprout whose delicate shoots  
Shoot forth their young sprouts and spread  
And bring forth in their birth many branches.  
             It was so on that night,  
             It was so this night,  
             It was dark at the time with Poeleele,  
             And darkest age--of bubbly night.  
                          ’Tis night.
