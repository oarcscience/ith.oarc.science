### THE FIRST ERA, OR AGE.

#### FIRST VERSE.

At the time that turned the heat of the earth,  
At the time when the heavens turned and changed,  
At the time when the light of the sun was subdued  
To cause light to break forth,  
At the time of the night of Makalii (winter)  
Then began the slime which established the earth,  
The source of deepest darkness.  
Of the depth of darkness, of the depth of darkness,  
Of the darkness of the sun, in the depth of night,  
                                    It is night,  
                                    So was night born.
