### THE FIFTH ERA.

#### FIRST VERSE.

The advance of age when Kapokanokano (night of strength)  
Established heaps in the Polalouli (depth of night),  
And the dark fresh color of the earth thrown up  
Was the darkness of the famous Polalouli (night in the deep),  
Who married for wife Kapokanokano.  
His snout was of great size and with it dug the earth;  
He dug until he raised a great mound,  
He raised a hill for his gods,  
A hill, a precipice in front,  
For the offspring of a pig which was born;  
Built a house and paid the forest  
And rested by the patches of Loiloa,  
             For Umi who is to possess the land,  
             For Umi who is to reign anon;  
The land where Kapokanokano dwelt,  
To which place laid a path of frailest trail,  
A trail as fine as the choicest hair of this pig,  
A being was born half pig, half god,  
At the time of life of Kapokanokano,  
Who became the wife of Polalouli.  
             Night was born.

Of affections for the tribe of relations,  
Of songs that grasp of Oma's friends  
Till relations are enrolled from Kapokanokano  
                          At yester eve.  
                            ’Tis night.
