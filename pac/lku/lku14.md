| Hikapuanaiea. | Haumea was discovered. |

Haumea of mythical form, Haumea with eight different forms,  
Haumea of several forms, Haumea in form of a shark.  
Whose many forms took different shapes,  
And at the birth of Hikapuanaiea her breasts were caught by the
heavens.  
This woman of Nuumea was discovered by a dog.  
Nuumea was the land, Nuupapakini the earth,  
Where Haumea's grandchildren increased.  
In Kio sickness ended, the brains began to roll.  
This woman that gave birth from her head,  
Children were born from her brains.  
This woman of the darkest night, of Nuumea,  
And lived at Mulinaha,  
Gave birth to Laumiha through the brain;  
Gave birth to Kahaula, a woman, through the brain;  
Gave birth to Kahakauakoko through the brain.  
Haumea was the same woman  
Who lived with Kanaloaakua.  
Kauakahiakua was born from the brains;  
Her children were mostly born from the brains;  
With great slime was the birth from the brain  
By "Papa who sought the earth" (people),  
By "Papa who sought the heavens" (chief),  
By Papa the great producer of lands,  
By Papa who lived with Wakea.  
Haalolo was born a woman.  
Accompanying its birth were anger and jealousy.  
Wakea became false to Papa.  
Changed the days and months,  
Ordered the nights of Kane towards the last of the month  
And the nights of Hilo to be first; <span id="page_69">p. 69</span>  
And established sacred tabus across his threshold.  
Such was the house that Wakea lived in.  
The food of the parent chief became sacred;  
The Ape, so bitter, became sacred;  
The Akia (sour) became sacred;  
The Auhuhu (pungent and bitter) became sacred;  
The Uhaloa for its life-giving properties became sacred;  
The Laalo, so acid, became sacred;  
The Haloa that grow by the edge of the patch became sacred.  
Plant the Haloa, the leaves will grow tall;  
So grew the sprout of Haloa in the day and  
                            Thrived.
