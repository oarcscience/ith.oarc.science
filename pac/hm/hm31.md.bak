### KUPUA STORIES

HAWAIIAN legends tell of the adventures of heroes who have two natures,
part human, part god. The god nature is likely to be derived from some
animal ancestor whose spirit enters into the child at birth. Hence the
heroic struggles which take place between demi-gods, often in animal,
plant, or stone form, competitors with more than human power whose
character as shape shifters brings natural forces into play in the
conflict and gives a mythical effect to the action. Such supernatural
beings are called kupua. They may appear as human beings or in some
other material form inherited from their divine ancestry, or their kupua
nature may be shown in the power they are able to exercise with a weapon
or with the mere grip of the hand. Competitions between rival kupua make
up a large number of the episodes belonging to kupua stories. Such
heroes belong to a period of conflict between warring chiefs. They
perform prodigious feats of physical valor. They are the strong men of
their district or island. Ruling chiefs give up their lands and hide
from them, but on the whole kupua are more concerned to fight for some
weaker chief whose cause they have made their own than to win lands on
their own account. They are roving champions, passing from island to
island, ridding the country of those who have held it in terror. They
are experts in the use of the spear, slingstone, battle-axe, war club,
as well as in boxing, wrestling, and word play. They are great rat
shooters like Pikoi-a-ka-alala, great fishermen like Nihooleki,
superhuman warriors like Kapunohu and Kepakailiula, performers of
titanic labors like Kalae-puni and Kalae-hina of Hawaii, winners in cock
fights like the chicken-girl Lepe-a-moa.

Geographical allusions abound. There is much riddling upon place names.
Chiefs bear the names of districts they govern, chiefesses of hills or
of bodies of water. Elaboration to

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

explain the origin of some physical feature or the derivation of a name
is by no means unusual. Kupua heroes leave their mark upon the land they
pass through. Thus the titanic movement of supernatural forces is made
realizable to the listener.

There is humor in the exaggeration, as in our own tall-tale telling.
Kupua stories are admittedly fiction, although often credited as fact.
An old Hawaiian chuckles as he tells how Pikoi could shoot a rat asleep
on the far point that lies faint on the distant horizon. The traces of
Kalaehina's activities are pointed out today in various localities,
sometimes with pride as deeds of kindness, sometimes with accusation of
malice as a mischief maker, more often with a half-credulous grin as for
a wonder worker.

Kupua stories tend to follow a regular pattern. The kupua is born in
some nonhuman form, but detected and saved by his grandparents,
generally on the mother's side, who discern his divine nature. He is
precocious, becomes speedily a great eater, predatory and mischievous.
He is won over to the side of some chief by a present of his daughter or
daughters as wives, and sent to do battle with his rival or with some
dangerous adversary who is terrorizing the country.

The period covered in these legends is roughly that between the mythical
figures of Olopana of Oahu, Kukuipahu of Kohala, Kakaalaneo of Maui,
down to such semihistorical ruling chiefs as Keawe-nui-a-Umi and his son
Lono-i-ka-makahiki on Hawaii, Kamalalawalu on Maui, and Kakuhihewa and
Kuali‘i on Oahu. The island of Kauai, Kohala on Hawaii, and Ewa on Oahu
serve as a sort of breeding ground for these heroic figures. The Kauai
legend of Kawelo with its many exaggerated features stands perhaps
midway between the semihistorical figures of more or less authentic
history and these fictitious heroes, product of the free play of the
imagination upon whatever material, traditional or borrowed, comes best
to hand.

One of the most popular of the kupua warrior legends, to judge by the
number of recorded versions and the fulness of elaboration of the story,
is that of Kawelo of Kauai, called Kawelo-a-Maihuna-li‘i (-son of
Maihuna the chief) or Kawelo-lei-makua

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (Kawelo who cherished his parents) because he
defended his parents against their persecutors on Kauai. The earliest
recorded version is perhaps that by Jules Remy published in 1862. The
latest is that dictated to Pukui of Honolulu by an eighty-five-year-old
Hawaiian of Kauai named Kaululaau shortly before his death, as it had
been handed down to him orally, and translated by Miss Laura Green of
Honolulu. The similarity in the chants and in the episodes themselves
proves the existence of a single traditional form, the changes and
embellishments of which betray the hand of an independent composer.

### LEGEND OF KAWELO

(*a*) *Green-Pukui version*. Mano-ka-lani-po, ruling chief of Kauai, has
by his wife Ka-wai-kini a tiny son of extraordinary rank and beauty
called Maihuna-li‘i-iki-o-ka-poko (The little chief Maihuna) who is
brought up as a foster child of the high chief Holoholoku. When the boy
reaches the age to marry, a wife is sought for him over all Kauai, but
since none is found of sufficient beauty, the foster father, directed by
a dream, launches his wife's magic canoe transformed out of a hibiscus
blossom and is carried by favorable breezes invoked from the wind gourd
of his ancestor Nahiukaka to Oahu, where he obtains the hand of
Malei-a-ka-lani, a high chiefess descended from Paao, daughter of
Ihiihi-lau-akea and his wife Manana and brought up by her grandmother
Olomana in the Koolau mountains, and is borne back with the bride that
same day, to find that his wife has already, with the help of the little
Mu and Menehune people, prepared a sumptuous feast for the marriage
celebration.

Three sons are born to the two at Wailua, each birth preceded by a
pregnancy craving satisfied only by the little Menehune people, who
bring ice from the mountains of Hawaii, awa planted by the birds at
Panaewa, honey from the mingled blossoms of lehua and pandanus to be
found only on Hawaii. Kawelo is the eldest born, Kamalama the second,
Ka-lau-maki the third. The boys are brought up under tapu and not
allowed to play with other boys. One day they run away and join the
other children in a spear-throwing contest. Kawelo wins, and eventually
he becomes the champion spear thrower for Kauai. He

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

builds a shelter for himself of pili grass named Kahiki-haunaka. His god
is Kane-i-ka-pualena (Kane in the yellow flower).

Kawelo longs to travel and. persuades his brothers to accompany him to
Oahu. Here he joins the expert fisherman Makuakeke in the sport of
fishing for the giant uhu fish named Uhumakaikai. At night on his return
his brothers meet him, each with a company of forty men, and hurl spears
at him all of which he is able to dodge.

An expert in the arts of warfare named Kalonaikahailaau gives him his
daughter Kane-wahine-iki-aohe (Little man-woman) as wife and teaches him
all he knows, reserving only the art of stone throwing. When the call
comes for him to return to Kauai and avenge his parents, driven from
their land by Aikanaka, he sets sail with twenty-four young warriors,
together with his warrior wife, his two brothers, and an adopted son
named Kaelehaupuna. As the war party leaves the shore, his father-in-law
appears and gives to the wife a snaring stick (pikoi) with which to
defend her husband in battle. \[This is in the shape of a block of wood
like a rough dumbbell, to the center of which a long cord is attached,
and is used to trip up or entangle an opponent in battle.\]

The party sails for Kauai, lands at Wailua where Aikanaka and his men
are, and, after declaring war, Kawelo mows down each antagonist with his
famous war club, Kuika‘a. Once they jeer at him, calling him "son of a
cock (moa)" and "counter of cockroaches" because his grandfather has the
name of Nahanaimoa, and Kawelo is about to retire in shame when his wife
prompts him to retort to the taunt, "The cock roosts above the chief;
the cock is chief." Kahakaloa fells him, but he recovers and in turn
kills the other with a blow. When his old comrade, the giant Kaua-hoa
advances, he tries to win the warrior over with a chant, fearing his
mighty club, but the warrior wife catches the club with her snaring
stick and it falls harmless. In the division of land that follows, the
wife gets Hanalei for her courage.

Kamalama gets homesick and returns to Oahu, taking the family god with
him, without which Kawelo is unable to foresee disaster. The adopted son
who lives at Maulili takes a wife, to whom he betrays Kawelo's weak
point in warfare. His enemies

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

lure him to the plain. Three times they bury him in stones and three
times he shakes himself free. The fourth time he seems to be dead and
they leave him on a scaffold under guard until morning. He revives, does
battle, and slays everybody. His brother, warned by their god, returns
in time to insist that the traitor be also executed. Kawelo makes his
permanent home at Wailua and dies of a good old age, but no one knows
where he is buried. <span id="fr_990"></span>[1](#fn_990.md)

 

(*b*) *Fornander* (1) *and Rice version*. Maihuna and Malai-aka-lani
have five children in Hanamaulu on Kauai: Kawelo-mahamahaia,
Kawelo-lei-ko‘o, Kawelo-lei-makua (the subject of the story), and
Kawelo-kamalama, all sons, and Kaena-ku-aka-lani, a daughter. The
maternal grandparents bring up Kawelo at Wailua with Ai-kanaka
(Man-eater), son of the ruling chief, and Kaua-hoa (Battle comrade), all
relatives born on the same day. Kawelo eats enormously and angers his
fellows by outdoing Kauahoa in managing toy boats and kite flying. The
place where he worsted Kauahoa in the latter sport is called to this day
Ka-ho‘oleina-a-pe‘a (The kite caused to fall).

When the family move to Oahu, he angers his brothers by outdoing them in
wrestling and they leave him and return to Kauai. Kawelo remains,
becomes proficient in fishing, and fishes up the Uhumakaikai by means of
a chant. When summoned to Kauai to avenge his family he sends his wife
Kane-wahine-iki-aohe to obtain from her father the stroke called
Wahieloa to prepare him for fighting. He bathes in the stream Apuakehau
and gets a good meal of food. He sends Kamalama to spy upon the
conversation of his wife's relatives and they believe him to be a god.
At Waianae he builds a temple to his god Kane-i-ka-pualena and to the
god Ka-lani-hehu which the messengers have brought him from Kauai. The
chief of Oahu furnishes him with a canoe. An adopted son, Ka-ulu-iki,
gets frightened at the start and returns to Oahu. The story of the
subjugation of Aikanaka and his subsequent attack with stones does not
vary essentially from Green's version. Aikanaka goes to live in the
uplands of Hanapepe and it is this chief's daughter whom Kaele-ha makes
his wife and to whom he reveals Kawelo's weak

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

point. Kawelo retires eventually to his parents' old home at Hanamaulu.

 

(*c*) *Fornander version* (2). Kawelo is born at Pupulima, Waimea.
He-ulu is his father, Haimu his mother. He is a timid child and Kauahoa,
his older brother, is adopted by Haulili of Hanalei lest he kill the
younger child. Sea bathing is his favorite sport. He longs for the wives
of his half-brother Aikanaka and his father says that a man to have
wives must be an expert in fishing and farming. These accomplishments
fail to attract, but when he becomes proficient in dancing they "fall
upon him and kiss him." Aikanaka resents the loss of his wives and seeks
Kawelo's life. Kawelo retires to Oahu with his brother Kamalama and
becomes expert in spear practice. At the hill Pu‘uloa he meets the
beautiful Kou. With Makuakeke he goes fishing. With his wife
Kane-wahine-iki-aohe, the girl skilled in surfing, he retires to Wahiawa
after learning from her father all the arts of warfare except that of
stoning. His parents on Kauai are meanwhile reduced to living on "fleas
and popolo berries." He is out fishing when messengers arrive to summon
him to Kauai and he first secures his catch, then with six strokes is at
the landing. With ten warriors, his wife, and his brother he lands at
Wailua. Haweo, Walaheeikio, Maumau-iki-o, and Kauahoa he meets and
overcomes in single encounters. At the close of the war Aikanaka takes
Kawelo's wife and it is she who betrays his weak point in warfare. The
battle with stones follows other versions, but the story is left
incomplete at the point where he takes position to meet his enemies
after recovering from the last stoning. <span
id="fr_991"></span>[2](#fn_991.md)

 

(*d*) *Westervelt version*. Kawelo has a kupua rat brother named
Kawelo-mai-huna who helps him build a canoe in which he escapes to Oahu
and who there thatches with bird feathers the house which the chief has
set him as a task to build with his own hands. <span
id="fr_992"></span>[3](#fn_992.md) Kawelo-aikanaka succeeds his grandfather
Kawelo-mahamaha-ia, great uncle of Kawelo, as ruling chief over Kauai.
When Kawelo, warned by the rat people, flees to Oahu,

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

his own parents are already living there. He adopts a strong man named
Ka-lau-meke who claims power through the rat family, and another named
Ka-ele-ha. The rest of the story describes the catching of the uhu, the
marriage with the warrior maid, the call to Kauai and defeat of
Aikanaka's forces, and the battle with stones, without unusual
features. <span id="fr_993"></span>[4](#fn_993.md)

 

(*e*) *Dickey version*. Kawelo-lei-makua is born in Wailua on the same
day as Kawelo-aikanaka and Kauahoa Kame‘eu‘i. He goes away to Oahu with
the help of his kupua brother Kawelo-mai-huna. Aikanaka becomes ruling
chief of Kauai and op-presses Kamalama-iki-poki‘i, younger brother of
Kawelo. Kawelo comes to the rescue, lands at Wailua, and declares for
war. At Wailua he slays all sent against him, including Kahakaloa. That
night the brothers get some sleep by setting up images to resemble
watchmen. The next day comes Kauahoa and gives Kawelo a stunning blow,
but Kawelo revives and, with the aid of his wife's snaring stick, slays
Kauahoa. Aikanaka wins the affections of Kawelo's wife. The stone battle
is fought at Kalaheo and Kawelo left for dead, but his spirit warns his
parents in Honolulu and they come and revive him and teach him the art
of stone fighting (nounou) so that in the second battle (fought on the
mountain called Nounou) he is victorious over Aikanaka. That chief he
tears in two but saves his own treacherous wife. In his old age his
people rebel and throw him over a cliff. <span
id="fr_994"></span>[5](#fn_994.md)

 

(*f*) *Remy-Brigham version*. Kawelo is a giant of prodigious strength.
To please the chiefess Kaakauhuhimalani he becomes a proficient
agriculturist and fisherman, but she is untouched until he becomes
expert in the hula dance. She then takes him for a husband and this
gives him rank as a chief. Three older brothers named
Kawelo-maka-inoino, Kawelo-maka-huhu, Kawelo-maka-oluolu (Kawelo with
bad eyes, -angry eyes, -kind eyes) pour poi over his head and almost
smother him, hence he chants a farewell to his wife and departs for
Oahu.

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

He is welcomed by Kakuhihewa and secretly collects an expedition against
Kauai. He sets out for that island and en-counters evil monsters in the
shape of the marine monster Apukohai, against whom he invokes the owl
god, and the fish Uhu-makaikai, which he traps in a net \[whose weaving
pattern is described in detail\] and which he kills after a fierce
struggle. On Kauai his old friends and relations Kahakaloa and Aikanaka
have joined the enemy. His friends Ka-lau-maki and Kaamalama follow him
from Oahu. Ka-hele-ha deserts him for Aikanaka. Showers of stones are
rained upon him. He prays to the gods and is saved. In the chant he
accuses his enemies of putting to death his father Maihuna and his
mother Malei by casting them over a cliff. He divides the land by giving
Puna to Ka-hele-ha (who had deserted him), Kona to Ka-lau-maki, Koolau
to Makua-keke, Kohala to Kaamalama, and Hanalei to his wife who has
saved him with her snaring stick. He rules Kauai until he is old and
feeble, when his people throw him over a cliff. <span
id="fr_995"></span>[6](#fn_995.md)

 

(*g*) *Oahu temple story*. Kawelo is slain at the battle of Wahiawa and
his body placed on the lele (altar) of the heiau of Kukui to decompose.
It is struck by lightning and he comes to life again. <span
id="fr_996"></span>[7](#fn_996.md)

 

(*h*) Historical version. Kawelo's grandfather was Kawelomahamahaia, an
important ruling chief of Kauai whose heiau of the severest ritual
class, Homaikawa, was dedicated to the shark god <span
id="fr_997"></span>[8](#fn_997.md) and who was himself worshiped as a shark
at death. <span id="fr_998"></span>[9](#fn_998.md) By his wife
Kapohina-o-ka-lani he had five children, Kawelo-makua-lua,
Kawelo-iki-a-koo, Koo-a-ka-poko, and two daughters, one of whom became
the wife of her brother Kawelo-makua-lua, who succeeded his father as
ruling chief of Kauai, and mother of Kawelo-aikanaka; the other,
Malai-a-ka-lani, became the wife of Maihuna and mother of
Kawelo-lei-makua, hero of this legend. <span
id="fr_999"></span>[10](#fn_999.md)

Kawelo-makua-lua and his sister-wife are said to have first set up the
practice of the prostrating tapu (kapu moe), called

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

burning-hot tapu of chiefs (kapu wela o na li‘i) because of the death
penalty imposed upon those who failed to observe the tapu. It was
carried to Oahu during the rule of Kauakahi-a-Kaho‘owaha, father of
Kuali‘i, whose wife has a Kawelo name, and to Maui in the time of
Kekaulike. <span id="fr_1000"></span>[11](#fn_1000.md)

The legend of Kawelo is recited at great length and is embellished with
chants and episodes of a romantic character or such as are typical of
kupua stories. Accounts of his birth contain references to the Menehune
and Mu people and associate him with rat-men born of the gods, and it
seems likely that the kupua qualities ascribed in the Dickey and
Westervelt versions to a rat "brother" were originally those which
belonged to Kawelo himself, or at least to his father. The mysterious
birth as a rat or other misformation in the midst of a storm--hence the
preservation of this embryonic form in a gourd wrapped in a feather
cloak until, when it is taken down, feathers fly about, rain falls, and
other wonders occur and a being emerges who can take the forms of man,
rat, fish, or elepaio bird--certainly corresponds with the magical
births recorded of kupua heroes who belong in the same class as
Kawelo. <span id="fr_1001"></span>[12](#fn_1001.md) Similar feats are told
locally of Kawelo. He is said to have wrested the "tongue of Hawaii"
from that island and to have brought it to Maulili pool on Waikomo
stream in Koloa district, where it projects from the cliff of Koloa on
the eastern wall of the pool. <span id="fr_1002"></span>[13](#fn_1002.md)
The account of the arrangements for Maihuna's marriage closely resembles
that given of Pi‘ilani's to the Oahu high chiefess Laielohelohe. The
legend must therefore be taken rather as an example of fiction in the
form of a typical kupua hero tale than be judged for its historical
accuracy.

The story has some likeness to the San Cristoval legend of Rapuanate the
giant, who lived on Marau-raro. <span id="fr_1003"></span>[14](#fn_1003.md)
All the figures are conceived in the titanic mold characteristic of
kupua stories. The warrior of Hanalei, Kawelo's childhood companion, is
described as a giant 120 feet tall, as strong as

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 320 men, and carrying a club in the shape of an
unrooted koa tree from Kahihikolo "in whose branches birds perch and
sing." Before such an opponent even Kawelo's stout heart quails and only
the prompt action of his wife with the snaring stick averts the club
stroke and gives the hero a chance to cleave the giant in two with a
stroke of his own famous war club. We are here in a more sophisticated
stage of culture than is common in these kupua stories, where the hero's
strength often lies in his hands and victims are rent apart with an
exhibition of physical violence. The motive is however curiously
un-Hawaiian, since the war club does not seem to have been developed in
the group as it was in the islands to the south. Kawelo's skill in
dodging the spear is more nearly in line with Hawaiian custom. Such a
ritual spear-throwing occurs at the Makahiki festival as the chief who
represents the god lands from the canoe sent out to break the tapu. This
has sometimes been interpreted as a mythical motive connected with sun
worship, but nothing could possibly be more unnecessary than such an
interpretation of a natural gesture by the ruling chief to proclaim his
skill at arms during a festival especially given over to a display of
athletic achievement.

Another characteristic motive common to such kupua hero tales and which
occurs episodically in this story is that of the inactive hero. Kawelo
sleeps until destruction becomes imminent. As the canoe approaches the
land he warns,

When Aikanaka's men approach, say no word,  
Only when they come very close awaken me,

and the enemy is allowed to lift the canoe and bear it up to dry land
before there comes the warning chant:

We have passed the holes of the burrowing crab,  
We have passed the holes of the sand crab,  
Here we are at the rat's hole!

and he rouses himself to action and easily mows down twice forty men
with his terrible war club. During the first fight Kawelo remains
chanting beside his canoes while the rest of the party engage the enemy
on the plains. During the assault

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

with stones, he allows himself to be buried in stones before freeing
himself of their weight. This motive of the inactivity of the hero,
generally followed by some prodigious exhibition of strength, is
sometimes rationalized by representing the kupua as smuggled on land
wrapped up like a bundle. On the other hand it is replaced in the
stories of Kapunohu, Palila, and Kalelealuaka by the probably borrowed
tale type of the disguised warrior.

With due allowance for historical inaccuracies and for literary
exaggeration, the story of Kawelo presents a true picture of Hawaiian
culture. The foster father bears the same name as the land of Holoholoku
which was made sacred to the birth of high chiefs of Kauai. Kawelo's
wife, Little-man-woman, is true to the Hawaiian type of warrior maid who
used to accompany her husband to war to hearten and assist him in actual
warfare, as attested by old informants, in the days before the discovery
by Cook. The practice of word play to destroy the morale of an opposing
champion or to soften his wrath is also true to old custom. Battles may
be ended by means of a laudatory chant, as in the Kuali‘i legend. The
incident in which Kawelo loses courage because of a taunt at his
ancestry is characteristic of the actual fighting power believed to
inspire such exchanges of insult. <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[15](#fn_1004.md) Riddling allusions, often dependent
upon punning with place names, win applause. There are homely folk
incidents such as that of the paddlers who forget their message at the
sight of a pretty woman and the consequent danger to the canoe \[compare
for the forgotten message the messenger sent from Tonga to determine
whether men or women ought to be tattooed, who, in the perils of the
passage, inverts the sexes, as in Brewster\], <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[16](#fn_1005.md) or of the champion who, believing he
has done his enemy in "by a single blow," indulges in a hearty meal and
struts about with the inverted food bowl over his head as a helmet.
Though perhaps borrowed from one tale to another, such incidents add to
the realistic effect of the action.

Two other kupua hero tales, those of Palila and of Kalelealuaka,

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

follow the special type represented in the Rice version of Kamapua‘a's
adventures, the second part of which also appears as an episode in the
Kuali‘i legend, the first in that of Kapunohu. The type is that of a
struggle between two chiefs for supremacy decided for the weaker chief
by se-curing the aid of a son-in-law with kupua powers, followed by (or
including) the episode of a disguised warrior who wins on successive
days of battle and is finally identified as the seemingly inactive
son-in-law.

### LEGEND OF PALILA

Palila is a great warrior of Kauai, son of Ka-lua-o-Palena (The pit of
Palena), chief over one half of Kauai, and of Mahinui, daughter of Hina.
Ku is his god. He is born at Ka-mo‘oloa in the northern part of Kauai in
the shape of a cord and is rescued by his grandmother Hina from the
rubbish heap and brought up among the spirits at the heiau of Alanapo in
Humuula. He has two natures, one of a man and one of a spirit. His
father is in conflict with the chief Na-maka-o-ka-lani (The eyes of the
heavenly one) over the other half of Kauai, and just as he is at the
point of defeat Palila comes to the rescue with the club Huli-a-mahi
with which he fells whole forests of trees at a stroke. The hole called
Wai-hohonu is formed where he sinks this club before his father. All are
terrified and Hina has to roll over their prostrate bodies to make him
laugh and end the tapu. She stands on the rise of land called Alea
(Mauna-kilika) holding his robe called Haka-ula and his loincloth Ikuwa,
and after circumcising him she returns with him to Alanapo.

The rule over Kauai being secured to Palila's father, the hero leaves
home in search of adventure. Standing on the knoll called Komo-i-ke-anu
he throws his club and, clinging to one end, arrives at the cliff
Nualolo at Ka-maile, thence flies on to Kaena point on Oahu, and from
there to Wai-kele where Ahu-a-Pau, chief of Oahu, is presiding over
games. The shark-man Kamaikaahui is terrorizing the country. By slaying
this man he wins the chief's daughters Ke-alamikioi and Ka-lehua-wai but
must first be "made human" at the heiau of Kane at Kahehuna before he
can wed. Ahu yields his litter to the victor, and for the first time
sets foot upon the ground.

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

Ahu fears his son-in-law and sends him on the circuit of the island
without warning him of the formidable warrior Olomana, thirty-six feet
in height, to whom the land from Makapu‘u point to Kaoio point is
sacred. Palila lights on his shoulder and cuts him through, casting off
that portion called Mahi-nui toward the sea and leaving the peak called
Olomana.

The whole of Oahu being now won for his father-in-law, Palila first goes
fishing with Kahului at Mauna-lua, using his club with equal success as
paddle and fishhook; but, finding his companion stingy, he goes across
from Hanauma to Kaluakoi on Molokai, where he leaves "a part of his
body" as the point Kalae-o-ka-laau; then, taking a dislike to Molokai on
account of the name Ho‘one‘enu‘u attached to a "tree" there, he flies
across to Lanai, thence to Honua-ula on Maui, thence to Kaula between
Hamakua and Hilo districts on Hawaii. There he finds Hina's sister Lupea
living above Kaawali‘i in the form of a hau tree. Since she is a kahu of
Palila no hau tree will grow to this day where Palila's loincloth has
been spread out to dry.

Kulukulua of Hilo district and Wanua of Hamakua are at war. Palila takes
up the cause of the Hilo chief. No one knows who the invisible warrior
is who cries each time a man falls, "Slain by me, Palila, by the
offspring of Walewale, by the foster child of Lupea, by the o-o bird
that sings in the forest, by the mighty god Ku!" until in the last fight
he makes himself known. He slays the three great warriors of Hamakua
each with a single stroke and hangs their jaws on a tree called
Ka-haka-auwae (The shelf of jawbones) and becomes himself ruling chief
of Hilo. <span id="fr_1006"></span>[17](#fn_1006.md)

### LEGEND OF KALELEALUAKA

The father of Ka-lele-a-luaka is Opele-the-sleeper (Ka-opele-moemoe)
whose nature is such that he passes into a trance every six months and
lies for six months as if dead, after which there comes a storm with
thunder and lightning and he awakens. During this trance his spirit
"floats away into the upper air with Poliahu" and compasses the whole
group in a day. Opele is born in Waipio valley on Hawaii in such a
trance and his

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

body is laid away in a cave. He awakens and calls to his parents in a
chant and when they come to the spot they find him sitting in a tree
braiding scarlet lehua flowers into a wreath. Cultivating the land is a
passion with him and he plants crops at Kula on Maui, at Kapapakolea in
Moanalua on Oahu, in Lihue on Oahu, but each time his trance seizes him
just as he is about to enjoy his crop, and others consume it. In one
such sleep his body is floated downstream and is found on the beach of
Maeaea in Waialua by some men from Kauai looking for a human sacrifice
for their temple of Lolomauna at Pokii (or of Kukui at Kaikihaunaka).
For six months he lies on the altar without his flesh decomposing, then
there comes thunder and an earthquake and he awakens. The old man at
whose house he receives hospitality thinks he will make a fine husband
for his daughter Maka-lani (or Kalikookalauae). He wastes no time in
love making but goes to work at once cultivating a huge tract of land
and bringing in a great catch of fish. When his wife is about to have a
child he warns her of his habit of trance, but her family (or the wife
herself) cannot believe that he is not dead and they bind stones to his
feet and throw him into the sea, where within six months he awakens
during a thunderstorm and returns to his wife (or goes back to his old
plantation on Oahu).

The son Ka-lele-a-lua-ka grows up mischievous (in ignorance of his true
father, who has left him a spear as recognition token and gone away to
Oahu). Opele has given his own power to the child and has no more
trances. The boy can "jump up and down precipices and run on water like
a duck." He is challenged by the ruling chief of Wailua who has heard
his boasts, then by the chief of Hanalei, and kills both as a sacrifice
for the heiau he and his father have built. With a lad named Kaluhe as
companion he paddles across to Waianae on Oahu and, picking up another
lad nicknamed Keino-ho‘omanawa-nui because he is too lazy to clean his
food before eating, he goes to cultivating at Kahuoi in Ewa at his
father's old plantation (or finds his father at work and gives him the
recognition token).

The boys live at a mountain house, Lele-pau, and amuse themselves at
night by making extravagant wishes, the sloven for all kinds of fat
food, Kalele for a house erected for him by

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

the ruling chief and the chief's daughters for wives. Kakuhihewa sees
the boys' light burning night after night and, suspecting treason, comes
(or sends a spy) to listen at the door. A spear is left at the door as a
token that they are under the tapu of the chief, but since the kahuna
Na-pua-i-kamau advises the chief that this is a man daring enough to win
for him in the struggle then going on between Kakuhihewa and Kuali‘i (or
Pueo-nui), the chief fulfils the wishes of each and the two boys are
housed splendidly at the court and have the chief's daughters as wives.

It was the lame marshal Maliu-ha‘aino who was sent to execute the
command. He proceeded so slowly with the other two boys that Kalele had
time to be transported to Kuaikua to be bathed and circumcised in the
midst of a thunderstorm and return to the party without being missed,
when he picked them all up (but without their being aware of the
miracle) and set them down at-the chief's place. In like manner, when
all the warriors go forth to fight the rival chief of Oahu's forces and
the lame marshal starts out alone because of his slow progress, Kalele
pretends to sleep, then sets for his wives some such fruitless task as
filling a water bottle with the snout turned downward or cleaning and
baking a fowl without cutting it open, and, disguising himself each day
with plant wreaths of different localities, he overtakes the lame man
and carries him to Punchbowl hill to overlook the battle, while he
himself performs prodigies with his hands alone, driving back the enemy,
killing the chief who is leading them, and carrying home and hiding the
booty. On the last day of battle he forces Kuali‘i (or Pueo-nui) to
yield the rule over the land, but receives first a thrust from his spear
by which he is later identified as the true victor. (In Fornander, it is
a farmer at Halawa who sees him each time returning with the booty and
on the last day gives him a spear thrust in order to identify him.) In
the last battle he kills the sloven because he has each time claimed the
conquest for himself, then brings out the feather cloaks and other booty
taken from the bodies of the slain chiefs and he and his wives become
chiefs over the land. <span id="fr_1007"></span>[18](#fn_1007.md)

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

In both these stories occur marvelous weapons and marvelous exhibitions
of physical power. Palila fells whole forests with his club and is
carried over land or sea clinging to its end. Ka-lele-a-luaka's strength
lies in his hands. He is a swift runner and daring leaper. Opposing
warriors, as in the Kawelo story, carry prodigious weapons. One spear
can kill two hundred men at a stroke and is long enough to use as a
wind-break or to dam a stream. Names of some of the warriors occur in
other legends. Olomana is one of the mountain peaks back of Kailua said
to have been named from a band of strangers (haole) who early reached
these shores. Two of the warriors whom Palila meets in Hamakua on Hawaii
are among the company of fish kupua who accompany Keanini from
Kuaihelani when he comes to marry Hainakolo; one of them is said to have
been slain by Lima-loa, the other to have become a sea deity and to have
aided other sea gods in opposing Lohiau's passage from Kauai with
Hi‘iaka to join Pele. <span id="fr_1008"></span>[19](#fn_1008.md)

Another tendency in Hawaiian legend, in which genealogical interest is
strong, finds illustration in the Kalelealuaka story, where the action
passes from the great deeds of the father to those of the kupua son. So
in the Moikeha-Kila legend, the Paka‘a-Kuapaka‘a, the Luaho‘omoe-Kuula,
and the Aikanaka to Laka series. Attention is paid in the Palila legend
to the circumcision ceremony by which the wild energies of the kupua
seem to be made human and tractable, and to the tattooing of a warrior.
The spot where Palila was tattooed for the fight on Oahu is pointed out
on the edge of Kamahualele on Kauai at a place called
Ka-eli-alina-a-ka-mahu (The digging and scarring by the
hermaphrodite). <span id="fr_1009"></span>[20](#fn_1009.md)

Directly associated with the Kamapua‘a legend are two kupua hero tales,
one of which, that of Kapunohu, carries the same pattern as the two
legends just discussed, although the theme of the disguised warrior is
not developed; the other, that of Nihooleki, suggests the legend of
Ka-lele-aluaka's father, Opele-the-sleeper, in that it is the tale of a
great fisherman

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

who becomes a reëmbodied spirit and friend of Kamapua‘a. Kapunohu enters
the Kamapua‘a story as a brother of two sisters, one of whom, named
Koahua-nui, is represented as the wife of Olopana, the other as the wife
of Kukuipahu, ruling chief over the larger section of Kohala district.

### LEGEND OF KAPUNOHU

Kapunohu is born in Kukui-pahu's district. He gains the leading ghost
spirit of Hawaii, Kani-ka‘a, <span id="fr_1010"></span>[21](#fn_1010.md)
for his god. The spirit is one day glancing his spear Kani-ka-wi along
the course when Kapunohu picks it up and runs with it until Kani-ka‘a is
obliged to call a truce. With the spear thrower as his god, he finds
that he can hurl his spear through eight hundred wiliwili trees in line
at one time. With Kani-ka-wi as weapon and the ghost god as his ally,
Kapunohu avenges an insult from his brother-in-law by winning from him
the whole district for his rival and marrying Niuli‘i's daughters. At
Kapaau in Ainakea, Kukuipahu is killed and 3,200 men with him and their
feather cloaks are taken. At the place ever afterwards famous as Lamakee
he kills with his spear the warrior Paopele, who wields a club named
Keolewa so great that it extends over a whole district in length,
reaches up to the clouds of heaven, and takes four thou-sand men to
carry. On Oahu he allies himself with his brother-in-law Olopana against
Kakuihewa and slays that chief. Hungry after his exploit, he is bidden
by his sister to help himself to what food he likes and he pulls up
eight patches of taro. He goes on to Kauai, lands at Poki and at Waimea,
and settles at Koloa. His greatest feat is winning a throwing contest,
sling-stone against the spear Kani-ka-wi, in which he has staked his
life against Kemamo, the strong man of Kauai. Kemamo makes a good cast,
but Kapunohu's spear clears the coconuts at Niumalu, enters the water at
Wailua (hence the name Kawelowai) and, dashing up its spray (hence
Waiehu), pierces the cliff at Kalalea and goes on to Hanalei. <span

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

### LEGEND OF NIHOOLEKI

The great fisherman Nihooleki is born at Keauhou in Kona, Hawaii, and
comes to Oahu and lives at Kuukuua on Pu‘u-o-kapolei in Waianae under
the name of Keaha-iki-aholeha. He becomes ruling chief of Waianae and a
mighty fisherman because of his famous pearl fishhook named Pahuhu,
which attracts aku fish, and a double canoe ten fathoms in length manned
by twenty paddlers in which he always goes out fishing. He travels to
Waimea on Kauai, the birthplace of his wife who is high chiefess of that
island, and becomes ruling chief. When he dies his body is brought back
to Waianae and placed in a small house of poles in the shape of a
pyramid, where his parents worship the spirit until it is strong enough
to become a live person again. He goes back to his wife on Kauai under
the name of Nihooleki and she does not guess that this is her husband's
spirit. Reproached for doing nothing but sleep, he sends his wife to his
brothers-in-law to secure first his pearl fishhook, which the spirit of
his sister in the form of a black noio bird is guarding where it hangs
from the ridgepole, and then his double canoe which has been pushed
aside in the canoe shed, and, finally, paddlers to man it. The haul of
fish he secures is enough for the whole island, and he gets as a third
name at this time that of Puipui-a-ka-lawaia (Plumpness of the
fisherman). He fishes first off Waianae, then comes to Keauhou, where he
sends paddlers ashore each with a fish for his sisters. On his return to
Kauai he carries two fish ashore to offer one to the male and the other
to the female aumakua.

His friend Kamapua‘a is afflicted with dropsy and in spite of her
husband's instructions Nihooleki's wife, when Kamapua‘a is brought in a
litter to her door on a visit, turns him rudely away. Nihooleki
therefore abandons his wife but gives her, as tokens for their child, a
club and a feather cloak, and, as a name, that by which she had known
him as her first husband. In this way the chiefess learns that her
second husband is the reincarnated spirit of her first husband.
Kamapua‘a and Nihooleki go off together, diving under the sea to reach
Waianae, where Nihooleki gives his friend recognition tokens by which
his parents

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

may know him and bids him marry his sister at Keauhou while he himself
enters his tomb at Waianae and disappears. <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[23](#fn_1012.md)

 

Other tall tales in which exaggerated feats of strength are the theme
may be even more episodic in character and derive their subject matter
from curious natural features of the district within which the kupua's
power extends, or from contests with strong men of tradition. Among
these are the stories of Kalae-puni and his younger brother Kalae-hina
(Kalaikini, Kaleikini, Au-kini), sons of Ka-lani-po and Ka-mele-kapu,
who are born and brought up in the Kona district of Hawaii, at
Holua-loa.

### LEGEND OF KALAEPUNI

Kalae-puni is mischievous and without fear. At the age of six he can
outdo all his playmates; at twenty he is fully developed. He kills
sharks with his hands at Kalahiki and pulls up a kou tree at Honaunau as
if it were a blade of grass. The ruling chief Keawe-nui-a-Umi hides
himself and Kalae-puni becomes ruling chief. At Keawe's request the
kahuna Mokupane plots his death and has a pit dug at Ke-ana-pou on
Kahoolawe and sets two old people to watch for a very old man with hair
like bunches of olona fiber. When such a one floats ashore and asks for
water the old people send him to the pit and then throw stones down upon
him. The husband runs away but the wife finally hits him with a stone on
the head and kills him. <span id="fr_1013"></span>[24](#fn_1013.md)

### LEGEND OF KALAEHINA (KALAIKINI, KALEIKINI)

(*a*) Kalae-hina is so strong that he can throw a canoe into the sea as
easily as if it were a spear, tear up trees by the roots, and split wood
with his head. When the six canoes which his brother is building at
Kupua in South Kona get stuck at the place called Na-wa‘a-ho‘okui in
bringing them down to the sea, he hits on a plan to deliver five of them
by sea from a different landing while he himself brings the sixth along
on his back by the upper road. His brother therefore sends him to kill
the chiefs of

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Maui and seize the rule from Kamalalawalu. At
Kauiki in Hana the chief is found holding competitive sports and
Kalae-hina enters the games. When the chief sees how strong the new
champion is he runs away and hides at Wai-anapanapa.

Kalae-hina becomes ruling chief over Maui and gets such a great name for
strength that the men who work for him are silent from fear. Kapakohana,
who has superseded Ola on Kauai because of his strength, comes to test
himself with Kalae-hina. They wrestle and Kapakohana manages to push his
antagonist over the cliff Kai-halulu and drown him in the sea, after
which feat he cuts out his jawbone and exhibits it to the people. <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[25](#fn_1014.md)

 

(*b*) The kupua Kalai-kini comes from Kauai of Mano-kalani-po in the
form of a man to contend with the kupua of Hawaii. In Puna he strives to
overthrow Pohaku-o-lekia in the form of a standing rock on the hill
above Kapoho but is unable because Lekia is encouraged by his wife
Pohaku-o-Hanalei, who stands in the form of a round-shaped rock beside
the other. At Kapahua on the coast beyond Kalapana he stops up with
kauila wood the spouting horn called "the blowhole of Kalaikini" in
order to prevent the salt spray from spoiling the potato crop or, some
say, for mischievous reasons. <span id="fr_1015"></span>[26](#fn_1015.md)

 

(*c*) In Waipio, Kaleikini tries to uproot a kupua stone called
Nuhinuhi-a-Ua and attacks a kawau tree which is a great kupua called
Ke-kumu-kewau which, if uprooted, would have caused a flood. He is
called a native of Polulu in Kohala and can change himself into many
forms. Once he wanted his sister to name a child after him but said
nothing of his wish. Every child born to her he would throw into a
certain pond, where it became a fish, until a kahuna advised the family
of his wish. The fish are to be seen there to this day and are called
uiui because of the squeaking noise they make. <span
id="fr_1016"></span>[27](#fn_1016.md)

 

(*d*) In Hana, Kaleikini is described as a wanton mischief maker. He
comes from Hawaii to Hana on Maui and tries to

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

stop up the spouting horn near Kauiki called Puhi-o-Mokuhano, and he
smashes the stone of Kane beside that of Kanaloa (Niu-o-Kane a me
Kanaloa) because of its fame. <span id="fr_1017"></span>[28](#fn_1017.md)

 

Many Kupua stories center about the court of Kukuipahu in Kohala
district on Hawaii, and that chief is a favorite figure in kupua
extravaganzas. In the story of Kaipalaoa the riddler, Kukui-pahu's wife
is Kalena-i-hele-auau and it is she who instructs her nephew in
riddling. In that of the riddler Kapunohu, the kupua's sister becomes
Kukui-pahu's wife. In the story of Kepakailiula, Kukui-pahu marries his
daughter to the red-skinned kupua. Actors in the story have traditional
place names. Kukui-pahu names a land section in Kohala. Kaunalewa names
the district on Kauai where Uweuwelekehau and Lu‘ukia plant a coconut
grove and where stands the heiau Lolomauna. <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[29](#fn_1018.md) Keauhou and Kahalu‘u are places on
the Kona coast of Hawaii. Makolea is the name of a heiau at Kahalu‘u
presided over by Lono's god Ka-ili, where Lono-i-ka-makahiki is said to
have celebrated some of his victories. <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[30](#fn_1019.md) The story is patched up out of
episodes drawn from both native and foreign sources and has, like others
of these late compositions, no traditional value save as an example of
how kupua elements were manipulated for stock entertainment.

### LEGEND OF KEPAKAILIULA

Kepaka-ili-ula (Born with red skin) is born in Keaau, Puna, on Hawaii,
child of Ku and Hina. He is born in the form of an egg and his mother's
brothers Ki‘i-noho and Ki‘i-hele (Ki‘i staying and Ki‘i going) wrap him
in a feather cape for ten days and ten nights and there emerges a
beautiful child; at the end of forty days, during which he has lain
wrapped in a red feather cloak, his skin and eyes have become red. His
foster parents rear him in Paliuli, where the prodigious appetite he
develops is easily pacified, since here all things grow in abundance
without labor. As he approaches maturity his foster parents travel

<span id="page_424">p. 424</span>

about the island seeking a wife for their ward and after rejecting the
beauties of Hilo, Puna, and Ka-u they pronounce Makolea, daughter of the
Kona chief Keauhou and his wife Kahalu‘u, faultless. When Kepakailiula
leaves Pali-uli to court his wife, the place is shut up and no one has
seen it since.

Since Makolea of Kona is promised to Kakaalaneo of Maui, the lovers are
obliged to meet secretly and are presently detected by the parents and
the girl is sent away to Maui. Kepakailiula goes away to Kohala and
takes to wife Ka-pua-o-ka-onaona, the pretty daughter of Kukui-pahu,
ruling chief of Kohala. On two successive nights he paddles over to
Maui, makes Kakaalaneo drunk with awa and enjoys his bride, finally
leaving him head down in a dung heap. Pretending a friendly visit to
Maui, he comes with a great following of canoes to meet Kakaalaneo and
in a spear-throwing contest cuts the chief in two with his war club
named Olelo-kahi-e and keeps on slaughtering the people until Kukui-pahu
thrusts his young wife before him to stay his wrath. The rule over both
Kohala and Maui he gives to Kukui-pahu and goes on to Oahu, where
Kakuhihewa is so afraid of him that he makes him his foster son and
turns over to him the rule of Oahu.

Makolea, while out surfing, is stolen away by Keaumiki and Keauka,
messengers of Kaiki-pa‘a-nanea, famous ruling chief of Kauai.
Kepakailiula follows, makes friends with a leading chief of the island
living near at Waimea, and defeats the ruling chief, first in a
wrestling match and then in a riddling match upon which the contestants
have staked their bones, slays the chief and burns him in an oven, and
makes the friendly chief Kaunalewa ruler over the island. <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[31](#fn_1020.md)

 

Two animals besides the dog and hog found native here before the arrival
of Europeans were a species of bat (*Atalapha semota*), said to be found
also in Chile, <span id="fr_1021"></span>[32](#fn_1021.md) and a species of
small rat inhabiting wild rocky places and living on roots and seeds
(*Rattus hawaiiensis*). <span id="fr_1022"></span>[33](#fn_1022.md)
According to the Kumulipo,

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

in the sixth era of the po are born "the beings that leap in the night"
and "keep the changes of the month." <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[34](#fn_1023.md) Thus the rat kupua who is part human,
part spirit, becomes a favorite theme for story-telling. When
Kalanimanuia is brought back to life, he has the look of a rat until his
human form is completely restored in all its beauty. <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[35](#fn_1024.md) Na-maka-i-ka-ha‘i has a rat-girl
among her attendants. <span id="fr_1025"></span>[36](#fn_1025.md) In the
Kila story it is a rat-man who gnaws the rope and lets down the food
which Makali‘i has hung up in a net. Kawelo's brother is said to have
rat forms, and there is a folktale of Ohia-tree and his sister Rain who
turns her forest family into rats with a slap each and herself into a
spring of water. <span id="fr_1026"></span>[37](#fn_1026.md) Rat shooting,
a favorite betting sport among chiefs on Hawaii and the unique example
of the use of bow and arrow in this group, is also reported as a
competitive sport of chiefs in Tonga, <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[38](#fn_1027.md) and in Samoa the son of a woman with
a rat's head has rat carpenters build a house for his marriage. <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[39](#fn_1028.md)

The love of exaggeration characteristic of kupua stories is amply
satisfied in the figure of the rat-man Pikoi-a-ka-alala (Pikoi son of
Crow), which belongs to the period of Keawe-nui-a-Umi of Hawaii and
Kakuhihewa of Oahu. He is born at Wailua on Kauai into a kupua rat
family and is skilled in the art of shooting with bow and arrow. The two
principal episodes of his legend are those of his contest in rat
shooting with Mainele on Oahu and his successful shooting of the kupua
birds who live in the forest of Hawaii and prevent Keawe-a-Umi from
selecting a tree for the canoe he is building to go in search of his
favorite Kapa‘a. A famous riddler, he uses riddling puns as a legitimate
way of winning a fantastic bet. But it is the fabulous skill of Pikoi in
rat shooting which is the favorite theme for local tall-tale telling. He
can stand on Kauiki on the island of Maui and shoot a rat lying asleep
in Kohala across the channel. <span id="fr_1029"></span>[40](#fn_1029.md)

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

### LEGEND OF PIKOIAKAALALA

(*a*) *Fornander version*. Pikoi-a-ka-alala is born at Wailua, Kauai,
into a kupua family who have the power of taking human or rat form. His
father is Alala (Crow), and his mother Koukou, his two sisters are Iole
(Rat) and Opeapea (Bat). When his koieie (koieiei) board wins over the
others the boys are jealous and push it into the rapids. He jumps in
after it and is borne down the Wailua river out to sea and cast up on
the beach at Kou on Oahu, where he is found by a man named Kauakahi and
carried to the home of his sisters, who have married influential men on
Oahu. He recites his family names, is recognized, and the husbands sent
for to prepare a feast of welcome. While the food is preparing he joins
a rat-shooting contest and is taken as champion by the chiefess
Kekakapuomaluihi against the famous rat shooter Mainele, the champion of
her husband Kaula-mawaho, ruling chief of the island. Mainele shoots ten
rats with one arrow, but Pikoi puts up a prayer to his rat family and
strings ten rats and a bat by the whiskers upon one arrow. After a
betting contest in which Pikoi wins by riddling upon the word iole
(rat), the newcomer is acclaimed victor and Mainele retires in disgrace.
On his return to his sisters he eats up most of the food and the people
say to each other, "He eats like a god!"

Keawe-nui-a-Umi sends for the expert shooter Mainele to get rid of some
elepaio birds who prevent his canoe builders from felling trees for
their craft; every tree that the men attempt to fell, the birds declare
rotten. Pikoi gets his friend Kauakahi to convey him with the party to
Hawaii hidden in a basket, under pretence of carrying with him his god,
and when Mainele fails to get the birds Pikoi takes successful aim by
watching their reflection in a basin of water. Thus he becomes a wealthy
man.

 

(*b*) *Westervelt version*. Pikoi has six rat sisters named after the
bow used for rat shooting (kikoo); he himself and his sister
Ka-ui-o-Manoa (The beauty of Manoa) who marries Pawa‘a, chief of Manoa
valley on Oahu, have human form. The rat sisters teach him chants and he
is furnished with a bow and arrows by means of which he wins over all
competitors on Kauai except

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

the dog-man Pupualenalena, whose skill is equal with his own. He
accompanies his father to visit his sister, who lives with her husband
at Kahaloa; they have also a place called Kahoiwai farther up Manoa
valley. On the way he shoots and kills the great squid kupua Kahahe‘e
who pursues the canoe off Kaena. On the plain below Makiki valley the
champion shooter of the chiefess Kaha-maluihi is losing to Mainele, the
champion of her husband Kakuhihewa. Pikoi breaks up her bow and arrows,
obtains his own from his father, and, employing his family prayer chant
to invoke supernatural aid, he spies out rats invisible in the foliage
save for their whiskers and strings them upon his single arrow by
forties to the ecstatic cheers of the onlookers. For five years he hides
until he is a grown man and his rat sisters have gnawed his hair short
and colored his face, so that when he appears as a handsome man with a
somewhat ragged haircut he is not recognized. The chiefess compromises
him by riding in on the same wave with him and he is about to be killed
by the chief's men when the former shooting champion is recognized and
tested in a riddling match with Mainele in which he is acclaimed victor.
His brother-in-law knocks dead forty of the men who have insulted him;
his own "wise arrow" seeks out those who flee; and he becomes known as
the "fire shooter" (Ka-pana-kahu-ahi), and dwells up Manoa valley in a
great grass house given him by the chief. <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[41](#fn_1030.md)

 

Cock-fighting was a favorite sport of Hawaiian chiefs as of
Tahitian, <span id="fr_1031"></span>[42](#fn_1031.md) but without the use
of artificial spurs such as are reported for the Dyaks of Borneo. High
stakes were laid upon the game. A fine passage in the famous chant of
Haui-ka-lani commemorating Kamehameha's first victory over Kiwalao on
Hawaii compares the battle between the chiefs to a cock-fight:

Hawaii is a cock-pit, on the ground the well-fed cocks fight. . . .  
He (the chief) is a well-fed cock . . .  
Warmed in the fire-house until the stiffened feathers rattle, <span
id="page_428">p. 428</span>  
Of varied colors like many-colored paddles, like piles of kauila
timbers;  
The feathers rise and fall when the cock spurs.  
The cock spurs north and then spurs south  
Till one great blow of the spur  
Hits the head, he flees severely wounded.  
The chief bites like a dog,  
Scratches the ground like a fowl,  
The fowl scratches, the soft dust flies upward. . . . <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[43](#fn_1032.md)

 

### LEGEND OF LEPEAMOA

Lepe-a-moa (Comb of a cock), the chicken-girl of Palama, is the kupua
daughter of a high chief of Kauai named Keahua who has incurred the
displeasure of a sea-dwelling kupua named Akua-peha-ale (God of the
swelling billow) and been exiled to a remote place in the mountains
called Ka-wai-kini, where his wife Kauhao, daughter of the chiefess
Kapalama of Oahu, bears a child in the form of an egg. Kapalama comes
for the child and keeps the egg wrapped in tapa and sweet-smelling
plants until it hatches into a many-colored bird and becomes, through
the power of a bird ancestress named Ke-ao-lewa who lives in the
heavens, a kupua with power to take either the form of a bird or that of
a beautiful girl. This child Lepe-a-moa is brought up by her
grandparents Kapalama and Hono-uliuli on Oahu.

Meanwhile on Kauai a boy is born named Kauilani. Storm signs proclaim
his rank as a chief and his father's parents, Lau-ka-ieie and
Kani-a-ula, bathe him in the spring called Wai-ui and gird him with the
malo Paihi-ku. Thus he gains supernatural strength. To destroy his
father's enemy he first hems him in by planting stakes, which grow into
a thicket. The gods carve images which come to life and fight for him.
The malo Paihi-ku gives his spear-thrust strength. Thus the demigod is
defeated and burned and his father restored to his lands.

Kauilani next goes to find his sister, tossing his spear ahead of him
and following its lead. Two women hide the spear; when he calls "Koa-wi!
koa-wa!" it answers. Over the sea he perceives the kupua form of a bird
ancestress, Ka-iwa-kalameha, then a

rainbow, then sees by the shore his sister catching fish. He hides in
her house and sees her change into her bird forms. As she falls asleep
he seizes her and holds her fast. She tries to escape in her kupua
bodies until the parents tell her in a chant who he is.

Kakuhihewa of Oahu is entertaining his sister and her husband Maui-nui
and has bet his own lands against those of his brother-in-law upon a
cock-fight. He now offers his daughter in marriage to the man who can
produce a cock to win the bet for him. Kauilani, who is in high favor
with the chiefess, promises to do this. The Maui cock is a kupua bird
related to Lepe-a-moa's family and named Ke-au-hele-moa. A kupua in the
form of an elepaio bird warns Kauilani not to let the cock see his
sister before the fight. He wears her concealed in a garland about his
neck until the fight begins. The Maui cock tries all its bodies in
succession but the hen wins. At first the new wife is jealous of the
beautiful sister, but after their girl child Kamamo is born and adopted
by the kupua sister, Kauilani goes to live at Kakuhihewa's court. <span

*Tuamotu, Anaa*. Taiva and Gaitua have a son born first as an egg. The
wife conceals it, fearing her husband's anger. He however guards it as
his own when the bird-child is discovered. This is Rogo-tau-hia or
Rogo-rupe. See also Rua-toa, the boy covered with feathers, who rescues
his father Hiri-toa from Puna's filth-pit. <span

*Tonga*. The woman who eats her pigeon god bears a child with a pigeon
head who later becomes a beautiful girl and marries the ruling chief of
Tonga. Ulukihe-lupe is her name and her child Kauulu-fonua avenges his
father and becomes ruling chief of Tonga. <span
