### XXXI

### VOYAGE TO THE LAND OF THE GODS

THE Oahu Waha-nui (Big mouth) family is placed by Fornander in the early
period of contact with the southern Pacific, contemporary with Hikapoloa
on Hawaii, Kaikipa‘anea on Kauai, Kamauaua on Molokai. <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[1](#fn_1083.md) He is said to have been a great
voyager, to have so oppressed the Menehune people as to induce their
migration to the sunken land of Kane, led by Kanaloa and Kane-apua and
directed by their god Kane, and to have been himself killed in a sea
fight. <span id="fr_1084"></span>[2](#fn_1084.md) But the famous fictitious
narrative (kaao) recording his voyage "to tread on the breasts of Kane
and Kanaloa" connects Waha-nui with the island not of Oahu but of
Hawaii.

### STORY OF WAHA-NUI

(*a*) *Fornander version*. Waha-nui sets out from Hawaii with his seer
(kaula) Kilohi to fulfil a vow he has made to sail to Kahiki and
"trample" upon Ka-houpo-o-Kane-a-me-Kanaloa before returning again to
Hawaii. Kane, Kanaloa, and Kane-apua, three gods with human forms, have
been living on Lanai, but Kane-apua has angered his brothers by
urinating in their water spring and they have taken bird form and flown
away, leaving Kane-apua, who has no bird body, to shift for himself. As
Wahanui passes Kaunolu point on Lanai, Kane-apua hails him and asks to
be taken aboard. Waha-nui points out that the canoe is already
overcrowded. Kane-apua twice raises a storm which forces the canoe back
and is at length given a place in the canoe behind the sailing masters
Ho‘okele-i-Hilo and Ho‘okele-i-Kau. As they encounter various dangers of
the sea he proves useful, first, in dispersing their fear of the island
Kane-huna-moku when it looms up and is taken by the sailing masters for
the great dog of Hina, Ku-ilio-loa; next, in quieting the two kupua
hills Pali-uli

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>

and Pali-kea (White and Black cliffs) which clash together and destroy
canoes; then in riding in safety a storm, sent from the calabash that
holds the bones of La‘a-ma‘oma‘o, by diving down and making the canoe
fast with a rope made out of the intestines of his ancestress
Hono-nui-kua-eaea where she lies with her face turned upward to greet
her grandchild; lastly, in quieting his own dog at the landing at
Kahiki. He tells Waha-nui to go until he comes to three men lying with
their faces turned up-ward, who are Kane, Kanaloa, and Mauli. Waha-nui
upon his return worships Kane-apua and is given a pilikua, here
described as a double-bodied creature, "the bodies being joined together
by means of the ribs growing into each other," and told not to show this
wonder until he reaches Hawaii. Waha-nui cannot resist displaying it on
Kauai and the ruling chief Kupakoili, advised by his diviner (kilokilo)
Luluupali, kills the chief and all his followers except one man, who
dives into the sea and later escapes to Hawaii and carries the news. The
death of Waha-nui is, however, avenged. His successor sends a plausible
invitation to the Kauai people to come to Hawaii, then massacres them
all; not one escapes. <span id="fr_1085"></span>[3](#fn_1085.md)

 

(*b*) *Kamakau version*. Kane-apua hails Waha-nui at the cape Apua.
Kilohi is the pilot, Moopuaiki the kahuna. The canoe lands at
Hale-o-Lono on Molokai, sails by the cliff of Kaholo, passes the cape
Kaunolu in broad daylight and comes to Apua, where it is hailed by
Kane-apua. After the storm the canoe lands at Kaunolo-pau and sails by
way of Ke-ala-i-kahiki on Kahoolawe. It is bound for
Kahiki-kapakapaua-o-Kane to tread on Ka-houpo-o-Kane, and Kane-apua
warns him to tread upon it all if he would live. On his return Waha-nui
brings the pilikua (dwarfs) and they become runners on Kauai. One is
brought to Punalu‘u harbor on the Ka-u coast of Hawaii and lives above
Kopu and Moaula. <span id="fr_1086"></span>[4](#fn_1086.md)

 

Analysis of the Waha-nui legend shows that it follows a traditional
Polynesian type.

\(A\) A kupua is reluctantly admitted to an overcrowded

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span>

boat (A1) by means of a forced landing, (A2) or upon promise of help in
overcoming obstacles, (A3) or through a disguise (the floating gourd),
(A4) or through other proof of supernatural power.

\(B\) He wards off the dangers of the way.

\(C\) He sends the party home with a culture gift which they lose
through disregard of a tapu imposed.

All of these elements seldom appear in the legend as preserved. In
Samoa, Tangaloa joins two youths from Tutuila sailing home from Manua,
who take him aboard only because the canoe will not move without him. He
carries them to Fiji, saves them from the "pointing finger of Fiji," and
sends them home with food plants and mullet, but the mullet (or all but
the coconut) they lose because they forget the instruction not to bail
out the canoe before coming to land. <span
id="fr_1087"></span>[5](#fn_1087.md) In the Tonga version of the "Voyage to
Bulotu" four gods sailing in a canoe are joined by a fifth, a woman
Familie (Take care) or Haalefeke, who intercepts them at various places
until her mysterious nature is recognized, and it is she who helps them
come safely through the tests set in Bulotu. Through her, food plants
are brought to Tonga. <span id="fr_1088"></span>[6](#fn_1088.md) In a
Tuamotu story from Anaa, Tararo asks to be taken by Kio, king of Marama,
on a courting expedition to Rarotonga and, when he is refused passage,
calls up winds and forces the canoe to take him aboard, then himself
wins the beauty of Rarotonga. <span id="fr_1089"></span>[7](#fn_1089.md) In
an Aitutaki version of the Rata story, Rata, bound for Marama, refuses
passage to Nganaoa, but when he comes floating overseas in a gourd he is
allowed to join the party, after promising to destroy all the monsters
of the way. <span id="fr_1090"></span>[8](#fn_1090.md) In the Tahitian Rata
story it is "the priest" who encourages the expedition and names the
opponents; <span id="fr_1091"></span>[9](#fn_1091.md) in the Tuamotuan,
Tava‘a, one of the family spirits of the forest, is found "sitting in
the bows as a guide for the voyage." <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[10](#fn_1092.md) In the Maori migration legend of the
canoe Tainui, the female fairy Te Peri acts as directing god, seated at
the bow of the canoe to guard

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

against dangers. <span id="fr_1093"></span>[11](#fn_1093.md) But for the
warning spirit Saolevao, Lele‘asapai would never have succeeded in
bringing down the yam planting from the flying gods in Alele. <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[12](#fn_1094.md)

The floating-gourd trick in order to be taken into a canoe or to pursue
one in which the supernatural being has been re-fused passage is to be
found in Polynesian trickster cycles. In Hawaii it is told of the
sorceress Hina-ke-ka (Hina the bailer). In the Marquesas, Tanaoa's
brothers have gone off in a canoe and left him deserted. He follows in a
coconut gourd and turns them all into porpoises, then himself wins the
beautiful Meto with his flute playing. <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[13](#fn_1095.md) White has a mixed story of Tautini
who floats to land in a bowl-sized canoe after his uncle's
fishhook. <span id="fr_1096"></span>[14](#fn_1096.md) In the Banks islands
story of Qat, the trickster follows his brothers when they steal off
with his wife and canoe, comes floating beside the canoe in a painted
coconut gourd, and makes the landing before them. <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[15](#fn_1097.md)

A common belief in spirit guidance dominates all these stories and may
normally play a part in the make-up of any travel story. The incident of
the guardian spirit or god through whose advice the hero wins success on
a dangerous mission, whatever its objective, is therefore not
necessarily borrowed from one story t' another. But the particular
treatment of the incident in the reluctance of those in the canoe to
give passage and the repeated effort of the supernatural being to gain
it, together with the fact that it is only through his help that the
quest is attained, gives the tale a type form very characteristic of
South Sea travel stories and which may derive from a common, perhaps
borrowed, source. It is interesting to observe that an incident based
upon reverence for a god is often diverted to farcical ends in the
make-up of such a story. The helpful spirit is often, like Kane-apua in
the Waha-nui legend, a trickster spirit whose troublesome acts distort
the actual moral pattern of the tale.

The meaning of Waha-nui's vow is rendered obscure by the chant language
employed. It must refer to some vengeance to be taken, such as Brewster
describes from Fiji as

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

mbuturaki, which consists in knocking a man down and stamping upon him;
"when a number of them got a victim down and jumped upon him, he
generally bore their marks for the rest of his life." <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[16](#fn_1098.md) In a Tahiti story Maui in a rage
stamps upon the disk of the sun until it is cracked and weakened. <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[17](#fn_1099.md) In Maori myth Tawhaki, angry with his
parents because they did not avenge the attempt made against his life,
"went to heaven and trod on the Toka-tami-whare," who were his
ancestors. <span id="fr_1100"></span>[18](#fn_1100.md) Treading upon the
prostrate bodies of relatives may be used as a mark of submission, as in
the Hawaiian legend of Kamapua‘a where his family submit to this
treatment after their son has conquered the land. But the expression may
well here refer to a voyage to ancestral lands circling the Pacific as
in the Kaulu chant, Kane referring (in Hawaii) to the sun's path north
of the Equator, Kanaloa to its path to the south.

Kane-apua's connection with Lanai is well established. Aiai, when he
goes about marking out fishing grounds and setting up altars, finds him
fishing off Kaunolu point on Lanai. <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[19](#fn_1101.md) Fish gods named Kane-apua and
Rae-apua were worshiped at Lanai in Ellis's day, and Kalakaua names them
as worshiped by Molokai fishermen. Emerson calls Kane-(lau)-apua a
healing and beneficent god from Lanai who is joined with his relative
Kane-milo-hai as an emissary to save men from death. The akuhekuhe fish
is said to be one of this god's forms. He is named as a brother of Pele,
who is left as guard on an outlying island of the group. <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[20](#fn_1102.md) He is named as the fourth son of
Hina-ai-malama and Konikonia. <span id="fr_1103"></span>[21](#fn_1103.md)
He is one of the bird brothers named in the legend of Aukele-nui-a-Iku
and legend says that Aukele and his brother Apua bring the first coconut
to Hawaii. <span id="fr_1104"></span>[22](#fn_1104.md) His connection with
Kane and Kanaloa is that of a younger brother and lesser deity, who
nevertheless by trickery gains his ends much like the younger Maui among
the sons of Akalana.

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

Waha-nui, the explorer of the Pacific and tyrant chief over the early
Kane people on Oahu, is possibly represented in the mythical
Ke-ali‘i-wahi-lani who looked down from heaven and, beholding the
beautiful woman La‘ila‘i dwelling on the island of Oahu, came down and
made her his wife and thus became the father of "one of the ancestors of
this race." An often quoted chant associates the name of Wahi-lani of
Oahu with the adventure described in the legend of Waha-nui:

O Wahi-lani, o ke ali‘i o Oahu,  
I holo aku i kahiki,  
I na pae-moku o Moa-ula-nui-akea,  
E keekeehi i ka houpu o Kane a me Kanaloa.

"Wahi-lani, chief of Oahu,  
Sailed away to Kahiki,  
To the islands of Moa-ula-nui-akea,  
To tread the sunken land of Kane and Kanaloa." <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[23](#fn_1105.md)

\[paragraph continues\] The purpose of Wahi-lani's voyage in this chant
is identical with that of Waha-nui's. The localization on Oahu is
unmistakable and agrees with that of the Waha-nui family on Oahu, with
the Wakea and Papa stories, and the traditional placing of Luanu‘u, who
is also called Wahi-lani, on the north coast of Oahu.

The name of Wahi-lani is, however, given to a chief of Kohala district
on Hawaii in the time of Keawe-nui-a-Umi. This chief is named as one of
those who accompany Keawe on his quest for Paka‘a and he is jeered at by
Paka‘a's son as "not a chief by birth" but a petty chief, ruling over a
land where sweet potato is the food and grasshoppers the fish of the
land. <span id="fr_1106"></span>[24](#fn_1106) He (or his son.md) joins the
rebellion against Keawe and is slain, and his bones are displayed by
Lono-i-ka-makahiki together with those of the five other chiefs whom
Keawe slew. <span id="fr_1107"></span>[25](#fn_1107.md) In both the
Waha-nui legend and the Paka‘a appear the Hawaii names of
Ho‘okele-i-Hilo and Ho‘okele-i-Puna (or -Kau) for the sailing masters,
and in both legends the

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

same device is used to force a landing by raising a storm. It looks as
if the two stories took shape at the same time, when early legends were
being relocalized and drawn into the cycle composed about the popular
figure of Keawe-nui-a-Umi at the time when he held court as ruling chief
on the island of Hawaii.
