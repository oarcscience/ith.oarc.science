### GENEALOGIES

THE genealogists of each island are said to favor a particular account
of the beginnings of mankind and the ancestry of the Hawaiian people.
The Kumuhonua tradition, according to which Ho‘okumu-ka-honua (Founding
of the race), as his name implies, is the original ancestor, is recited
on Molokai. Hawaii and Maui genealogists favor the O-puka-honua
(Opu‘u-ka-honua) or Budding-of-the-race. Oahu and Kauai follow the
Kane-huli-honua (Over-turner of the race) ancestral line. <span
id="fr_764"></span>[1](#fn_764.md)

On the Kumuhonua genealogy a line of chiefs leads down from Kumuhonua,
the first man descended from the gods, through Laka, or Kolo-i-ke-ao
(Creeping toward the light), brother of Kolo-i-ka-po (Creeping toward
the night), to Nu‘u (Ka-hina-li‘i) in whose time came the great flood
known as the Sea-of-Kahinali‘i, and thence to Lua-nu‘u (Lu son of Nu‘u),
called also Kane-hoa-lani, ancestor of the Mu and Menehune people; to
Hawaii-loa, called Ke-kowa-i-Hawaii (The channel to Hawaii), and from
him to Eleeleua-lani and from him to Ku-kalani-ehu and his wife
Ka-haka-ua-koko, parents of Papa-hanau-moku the wife of Wakea. <span
id="fr_765"></span>[2](#fn_765.md) Malo calls Kumuhonua the father, through
his wife Ka-mai-eli (The digger), of the root of the land (mole o ka
honua), which may be interpreted as the rootstock of the race. <span
id="fr_766"></span>[3](#fn_766.md) An invocation for curing the sick
begins:

O Kumuhonua of Mehani,  
A spirit out of earth, a spirit out of heaven.

\[paragraph continues\] Te Mehani is the name in Tahiti of the famous
mountain crater on the island of Ra‘iatea (called in old days Havai‘i)

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

where souls of the dead congregate for their journey to the other world.

The Kumuhonua legend includes the story of the creation, by Kane and his
associates, of Kumu-honua and his wife Lalohonua, of their placing in a
fertile garden from which they were driven because of disobedience to
the laws of Kane (which some say had to do with a "tree"), of the change
made in his name to Kane-la‘a-uli as a fallen chief, and of his retreat
to Pu‘u-ka-honua after his trouble with Kane. It is impossible to say
just what the legend originally implied. Kamakau speaks of Kane-la‘a-uli
as "a noted chief who respected the laws and proposed excellent reforms
which he was unable to carry through because of the greed of chiefs and
so died." Kepelino and Fornander papers make him responsible for the
coming of death into the world. Kepelino is writing for the Catholic
fathers and interested in interpreting genuine old tradition in the
light of Christian teaching. Kamakau is a journalist, setting things
down as he interprets them and unrestrained by foreign criticism and, it
would seem, without access to either the Kepelino or Fornander
papers. <span id="fr_767"></span>[4](#fn_767.md)

The Opuka-honua (Opu‘u-ka-honua) genealogy opens with the coming to
Hawaii, after the islands are already peopled, of the chief Opukahonua
and his younger brothers Lolo-mu and Mihi and the woman Lana, and leads
down to Papa and thence to the Kamehameha line. According to the
Opukahonua legend the islands were fished up out of the ocean by the
great fisherman Kapuhe‘euanui (The large headed octopus).

*Fornander version*. Kapuhe‘euanui lets down his fishline into the sea
from Kapaahu and fishes up a piece of coral, which the kahuna
Laulialamakua advises him to throw back into the sea with prayer and the
sacrifice of a pig, at the same time pronouncing a name over the coral,
and for each piece he throws there rises an island, first Hawaii, then
Maui, then Oahu, and so on.

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

The incident is referred to in the lines of the famous chant of
Makuakaumana when Paao's canoe appears off Moa-ula-nui-akea to invite a
chief to come and live on Hawaii-of-the-green-back:

A land found in the ocean,  
Thrown up out of the sea,  
From the very depths of Kanaloa,  
The white coral in the watery caves  
That caught on the hook of the fisherman,  
The great fisherman of Kapaahu,  
The great fisherman, Kapuhe‘euanu‘u. . . . <span
id="fr_768"></span>[5](#fn_768.md)

The Kumu-uli genealogy, employed instead of the Kumuhonua on Kauai and
Maui, is sacred to chiefs; to teach it to commoners is forbidden. The
name is explained to mean "Fallen chief" (Ke-ali‘i-kahuli) from kumu
meaning "chief" in poetic diction and (kah)uli, "fallen." <span
id="fr_769"></span>[6](#fn_769.md) It resembles the Kumu-honua up to a
certain point, but differs in that it opens with the gods Kane, Kanaloa,
Kauakahi, and their sister Maliu and wife Ukina-opiopio as ancestors of
Huli-honua, and leads down through Laka instead of Pili to Wakea through
Kahiko and his wife Kapulanakehau, instead of to Papa through her
parents Ka-lani-ehu and Kahakauakoko. In the legend of Kuali‘i it is
quoted as the genealogical tree which leads down to Kamehameha. <span
id="fr_770"></span>[7](#fn_770.md) It names Kane-huli-honua and his wife
Ke-aka-huli-lani as the first parents after the group of gods named
above. A variant on the twelfth branch of the Kumulipo says that at the
close of the Ololo line were born Kumuhonua, Kane, Kanaloa, and Ahukai,
the last three represented as triplets. Kahiko names follow among
others, and the line closes with

Wela-ahi-lani-nui (Fiery-hot heavenly one) the husband, Owe the wife,  
Kahiko-lua-mea the husband, Kupulanakehau the wife, <span
id="page_310">p. 310</span>  
Wakea the husband of Haumea, Papa, and Ho‘ohoku-ka-lani, Haloa. . . .
 <span id="fr_771"></span>[8](#fn_771.md)

The Kuali‘i genealogy, as it follows the Kumu-uli down to Wakea, is
incorporated into a chant of 618 lines in praise of the famous Oahu
chief of the northern district who is said to have ruled the whole
island during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and descent from
whom is claimed on the line of Pinea-i-ka-lani, wife of Liloa of Hawaii.
The story of its composition illustrates the high position given to
professional poets among a people depending wholly upon oral memorizing.

Two brothers, Kapaahu-lani and Kamakaau-lani, desire to better their
position by securing a powerful patron. They are kahunas and skilled
composers. They compose a panegyric to Kuali‘i, then stir up a conflict
between him and a weaker rival, join opposite sides, lead the two forces
to a concerted spot, and at the moment of joining battle, one brother
chants the hymn of praise from the opposing side and Kuali‘i, pacified,
gives up the battle; whereupon the deluded chief against whom the plan
is laid hastens to bestow upon his supposed savior lands and honors,
which the chanter loyally shares with his younger brother. <span
id="fr_772"></span>[9](#fn_772.md)

The Kumulipo genealogy (Kumu-\[u\]li-po, Beginning in the darkness of
night, that is, in the spirit world) is contained in a long chant of
2,077 lines divided into two periods, the first that of the po or spirit
world, the second that of the ao or world of living men; that is, of
ancestors who have lived on earth as human beings. The first part tells
of the birth of the lower forms of life up through pairs of sea and land
plants, fish and birds, creeping reptiles and creeping plants, to the
mammals known to Hawaiians before the discovery by Europeans: the pig,
the bat, the rat, and the dog. The second period opens with the breaking
of light, the appearance of the woman La‘ila‘i and the coming of Kane
the god, Ki‘i

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

the man, Kanaloa the octopus, together with two others,
Moanaliha-i-ka-waokele (Vast expanse of wet forest), whose name occurs
in romance as a chief dwelling in the heavens, and
Ku-polo-liili-ali‘i-mua o-lo‘i-po (Dwelling in cold uplands of the first
chiefs of the dim past), described as a long-lived man of very high
rank. There follow over a thousand lines of genealogical pairs, husband
and wife, broken by passages containing myths familiar to us from other
sources, those of Haumea, Papa and Wakea, Hina, and Maui.

The chant is said to have been composed about 1700 for the young chief
Ka-I-i-mamao, son of Keawe-i-kekahi-ali‘i-o-ka-moku, at the time he was
dedicated in the heiau and given the burning (wela), honoring (hoano),
and prostrating (moe) tapus which elevated him to the rank of a god. The
child was born during the Makahiki festival and was hence given at birth
the name of Lono-i-ka-makahiki. It is said that at the time of Captain
Cook's arrival at Kealakekua bay in 1789 during the Lono festival, when
sacred honors were paid him in the heiau of Hikiau as the returned god
Lono, this chant was recitated by two officiating kahunas. It was given
to Alapai-wahine, child by his own daughter, according to genealogists,
of Ka-I-i-mamao and from her descended to the former king Kalakaua and
his sister Liliuokalani who succeeded him. Kalakaua took an interest in
genealogies and had the chant written down. When the German
anthropologist, Adolf Bastian, visited the islands he studied the
manuscript, recognized its importance, and made a partial translation
into German which appears in his studies of sacred chants of
Polynesia. <span id="fr_773"></span>[10](#fn_773.md) In 1889 Kalakaua had
his manuscript version printed, and this has become, in spite of many
textual errors and alleged tampering with the original, the standard
text for the Kumulipo. In 1897 appeared Liliuokalani's translation.

There is no doubt that the first division of the chant is a reworking
from old material. The conception of the birth from one form of matter
to another, and from one form of life to another, corresponds with the
text of the Wharewananga

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

or school of learning belonging to the east coast of New Zealand, <span
id="fr_774"></span>[11](#fn_774.md) and to chants of the coming into being
of living forms of nature collected in Tahiti, the Marquesas, and the
Tuamotus. In Easter island Métraux found a myth in which three males and
a female called Ra‘ira‘i (identical with La‘ila‘i) people the
island. <span id="fr_775"></span>[12](#fn_775.md)

The latter half of the chant from the dawn of light (ao), although
phrased in chant language difficult to render with exactness into
English, is nevertheless clearly designed to give the genealogical
history of the family of Keawe to which the young chief belonged and
from which the family of Kalakaua and his sister claimed descent. The
first part must be regarded as originally a simple and literal story of
the development of natural forms on the earth. The antithesis between
darkness and light which forms the structural basis of the chant means,
according to one Hawaiian informant (Kupihea), the division between the
spirit world of the gods, which includes all natural forms, and the
world of men with which the family history begins.

Hanau ke po i ka po, po no,  
Hanau mai a puka i ke ao, malamalama.

"Things born in the dark are of the night,  
Things born from and sprung up in the day, they are of the light,"

are the original opening lines, says Kupihea, which were replaced in
transcription by the fine scene of tumult with which, in our present
copy of the chant, begins the birth of form in the po.

It was the correspondence of the chant with the evolutionary theory of
creation which interested early scholars. A Hawaiian friend (Mrs. Pokini
Robinson) who was familiar with old chief language and who read the
chant for the first time was convinced that the various stages of the po
are so phrased as to correspond with the development of a child from
birth to the time when the light of reason dawns and he begins to act

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

otherwise than from impulse, and she points out expressions belonging to
infancy and the ceremonies connected with that period. If this is true
the chant has certainly been a good deal mishandled by later retouchings
with a quite different theme in mind. Dr. Handy finds a parallel in a
Marquesan chant in which the development of the child within the womb of
the mother is somewhat similarly handled. Much interesting speculation
is also possible in matching the progress of births into plant and
animal forms with the growth and expansion of the race and with
particular incidents in its history. This historical point of view has
much in its favor. It implies a comparatively late reworking, perhaps
several such, of a genuine old original with its simple conception of
the birth of prehuman forms in the spirit world (po) up to the coming of
man, the image (ki‘i, ti‘i, tiki), who ushers in the world of human
beings (ao), to correspond with the actual genealogical history of the
Hawaiian line of chiefs from which the divine child to whom the chant is
presented claims direct descent.
