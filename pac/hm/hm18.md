### VI

### MAUI THE TRICKSTER

THE deeds of Maui, the well-known trickster hero of Polynesia, are
reported sporadically in Hawaii, always minutely localized for each
island, and centering especially about a point above Kahakuloa for West
Maui, Kauiki for East Maui, a cave on the Wailuku river above Hilo for
Hawaii, Waianae on Oahu, Wailua on Kauai. Most of the principal episodes
of the Maui cycle found in other groups occur, but sometimes with
considerable or complete variation from forms familiar in the south. The
search for eternal life and the transformation of the sister-wife's
lover into a dog are absent and there is no report of culture traits
invented by Maui except perhaps that of the kite. Only in the Kumulipo
chant is there any indication of a complete legendary cycle. That such a
cycle existed in connection with the Kane-Kanaloa legend is evident from
such fragments as we have. Maui is made a direct ancestor from Wakea on
the Ulu line; a list of his adventures or "strifes" (ka ua) occurs in
the fifteenth era of the Kumulipo. Except for a series of encounters
with Kane and Kanaloa for possession of the awa drink, these correspond
closely with the well-known series from the south. It is unfortunate
that early collectors neglected these stories, which today have probably
been much toned down from forms more nearly approaching the primitive
versions obtained by Stimson from the Tuamotus, and whose connection
with the mythology has been lost.

That in spite of the fragmentary and modernized form in which it
survives the story is very old is evident from its wide localization.
Besides the Kauiki references, the particular place is pointed out on
East Maui near Kailua on the wind-ward side of Kaumakanai above the
beach of Pokihale where the oven of the alae bird kupua was not long ago
still visible. Not far off, the print of Maui's knee is still to be seen
where he stooped to drink at a stream. The reference to Hina's

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

cave home connects the story with an early period, as do the allusions
to Kane and Kanaloa as banana eaters and kava drinkers. Maui's
connection as a trickster and sorcerer with the Kane group is clearly
demonstrated.

Setting aside for the moment the Kumulipo series, the following motives
occur in Hawaiian versions:

\(A\) Mysterious birth (Poepoe MS. *BPBM* col.; For. Col. 5: 536-539;
*HHS* 25: 16-17). In every case the supernatural father is a stranger,
variously named as Hina-lau-ae, Makali‘i from the heavens, "a man named
Malo." The reputed father is Akalana.

\(B\) Pushing up the heavens (Westervelt, *Maui*, 31-32).

\(C\) Getting fire (Thrum, *Tales*, 33-35; Westervelt, *Maui*, 64-66;
Kamakau, *Ke Au Okoa*, February 3, 1870; *Moolelo Hawaii* \[1838\], 41).

\(D\) Fishing up islands (Thrum, *More Tales*, 248-252; *HHS* 25: 17-18;
*Moolelo Hawaii*, 41).

\(E\) Snaring the sun (Thrum \[by Forbes\], *Tales*, 31-33; For. Col. 5:
538-539; *Moolelo Hawaii*, 41).

\(F\) Rescue of (F1) mother from water monster (Westervelt, Maui, 7-8;
local legends); (F2) wife from bat (Thrum, *More Tales*, 252-259); (F3)
Maui's own rescue by an owl child (For. Col. 5: 538-541).

\(G\) Death (Thrum, *More Tales*, 259-260).

 

1\. *Kumulipo version* (*after Ho‘olapa*).

Waolena was the husband, Mahuie was the wife,  
Akalana was the husband, Hina-a-ke-ahi was the wife,  
Maui-the-firstborn was born, Maui-the-middle-child was born,  
Maui-the-littlest (ki‘iki‘i) was born, Maui-of-the-loincloth was born,  
Girded with the loincloth of Akalana.  
Hina-of-the-fire was pregnant and bore a cock,  
Hina delivered her child in the form of an egg;  
She had not lived with a cock  
But a cock was born to her.  
The cock crowed "alala!" Hina was puzzled,  
She had not lived with a man but a child was born, <span
id="page_228">p. 228</span>  
A mysterious child for Hina-of-the-fire.  
Kia-loa and Kia-a-ka-poko were both angry,  
The brothers of Hina,  
Two of the four Kia.  
Maui fought, those Kia fell,  
Red blood flowed from the forehead of Maui,  
That was Maui's first strife.  
He fetched the bunch of black-stemmed awa from Kane and Kanaloa,  
That was Maui's second strife.  
The third strife was the quarrel over the strainer;  
The fourth was that over the bamboo of Kane and Kanaloa;  
The fifth strife was that at the gathering for the wrist-turning
contest.  
The sixth had to do with his descent;  
Maui asked who was his father,  
Hina denied that he had a father,  
The loincloth (malo) of Kalana was his father.  
Hina-of-the-fire wanted fish;  
He learned fishing; Hina commanded,  
"Go fetch your father,  
There is the line, the hook,  
Come-here-from-the-heavens (Manai-a-ka-lani), that is the hook  
For grappling the islands together, out of the ocean."  
He seized the great alae bird of Hina,  
The bird sister of Pimoe;  
This was the seventh strife of Maui.  
The mischievous kupua it was whom he hooked,  
The jaw, the mouth as it opened, of Pimoe,  
The fish that was lord of the island that shakes the ocean.  
Pimoe was pulled ashore dead by Maui.  
He had pity for Mahanauluehu,  
The child of Pimoe,  
Maui brought him ashore and devoured all but the tail,  
Pimoe lived through his tail,  
Mahanauluehu was the tail he lived through.  
Kane and Kanaloa were shaken from their foundation,  
With the ninth strife of Maui.  
Pe‘ape‘a carried away Hina-ke-ka, <span id="page_229">p. 229</span>  
The bat god was this Pe‘ape‘a,  
This was the last strife of Maui,  
He scratched out the eyes of the eight-eyed bat;  
The strife ended with Moemoe.  
Everyone knows of the strife of Maui with the Sun,  
With the loop of the snaring cord of Maui;  
Summer became the Sun's,  
Winter became Maui's.  
He drank the muddy waters of the plain  
Of Kane and Kanaloa,  
Strove by trickery,  
Around Hawaii, around Maui,  
Around Kauai, around Oahu;  
At Kahalu‘u is the afterbirth buried, at Waikane the navel string,  
He died at Hakipu‘u at Kualoa, Maui-of-the-loincloth,  
The famous kupua of the island, A chief indeed. <span
id="fr_567"></span>[1](#fn_567)

2\. *East Maui versions*: (A) *Birth*, (C) *Finding fire*, (D) *Fishing
up islands*, (E) *Snaring the sun*. Maui is not the child of Hina by
Akalana in the natural way but is begotten one day when she has a
longing for seaweed, goes out to the beach at Kaanomalo to gather some,
and, finding a man's loincloth on the beach, puts it on and goes to
sleep. The child born from this adventure is named Maui-a-Akalana and
her husband says, "We have found our lord!"

Maui's first feat is getting fire from the mud hens while they are
roasting bananas. Hina teaches him to catch the littlest one. He finds
them at Waianae on Oahu. Each time he approaches they scratch out the
fire. When he finally succeeds in seizing the littlest mud hen she tries
to put him off by naming first the taro stalk, then the ti leaf as the
secret of fire. That is why these leaves have hollows today, because
Maui rubbed them to try to get fire. At last the mud hen tells him that
fire is in the water (wai), meaning the tree called "sacred water"
(wai-mea),

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

and shows him how to obtain it. So Maui gets fire, but he first rubs a
red streak on the mud hen's head out of revenge for her trickery before
letting the bird escape.

Maui's next feat is stopping the sun from moving so fast. Hina sends him
to a big wiliwili tree where he finds his old blind grandmother cooking
bananas and steals them one by one until she recognizes him and agrees
to help him. He sits by the trunk of the tree and lassoes the sun's rays
as the sun comes up. The sun pleads for life and agrees that the days
shall be long in summer and short during the six winter months.

While Maui is still a child he goes fishing with his brothers and gets
them to go far out to the fishing ground called Po‘o directly seaward
from Kipahulu and in a line with the hill called Ka-iwi-o-Pele. Here
with his hook called Manai-a-ka-lani (Come from heaven) he catches the
big ulua of Pimoe. For two days they pull at it before it comes to the
surface and is drawn close to the canoe. The brothers are warned not to
look back. They do so. The cord breaks, and the fish vanishes. That is
why the islands are not united into one. <span
id="fr_568"></span>[2](#fn_568)

\(B\) *Pushing up the heavens*. The sky presses down over the earth. A
man "supposed to be Maui" says to a woman that if she will give him a
"drink from her gourd" \[a euphemistic expression\] he will push up the
sky for her. She complies and the man \[standing on Kauiki\] thrusts the
sky upward. Today, although the clouds may hang low over the mountain of
Haleakala, they refrain from touching Kauiki. <span
id="fr_569"></span>[3](#fn_569)

 

3\. *West Maui versions*: (A) *Birth*. Maui is the son of Hin-alau-ae
and Hina. The family lives at Makalia above Kahakuloa. While Maui is
still unborn, some men out fishing see a handsome child diving from a
high cliff into the sea, and they pursue. The child makes for home and
returns to his mother's womb. Thus they know that a magician is to be
born. <span id="fr_570"></span>[4](#fn_570)

*Lanai variant*. Pu‘upehe is the supernatural son of Kapokoholua the
father, Kapoiliili the mother, who live on the island of

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Lanai, which goes at this time by the name of
Ka-ulu-laau. For thirteen months Pu‘upehe lives unborn and frightens his
mother by speaking to her from her womb and playing the ghost as a
spirit abroad, in which form he sends fish to his father's line through
his god Pua-iki and learns the arts of warfare by over-hearing an expert
teaching others how to kill Pu‘upehe's father. He demands awa to chew
and tobacco, both of which seem to be new customs to his parents. When
he leaves his mother's body it becomes flat; when he returns it is again
swollen. <span id="fr_571"></span>[5](#fn_571)

*Maori variant*. Whakatau, son of Apakura, is formed by the god Rongo
out of Apakura's apron when she leaves it one day on the sand. Kites are
seen flying in the air but no one is visible because Whakatau is under
the sea. One day he comes out on shore and is pursued, but no one can
catch him but his mother Apakura. <span id="fr_572"></span>[6](#fn_572)

\(E\) *Snaring the sun*. The sun goes so fast that Hina has trouble in
drying her strips of bark cloth. Maui observes the sun from Wailohi and
sees where it rises. He fashions strong cord of coconut fiber from
Peeloko (Paeloko) at Waihee. The sun is rendered tractable and Maui then
turns to punish Moemoe, who has derided his effort. Moemoe flees until
overtaken north of Lahaina, where he is transformed into the long rock
beside the road today. <span id="fr_573"></span>[7](#fn_573)

(F3) *Maui's rescue*. While Maui is away snaring the sun, his mother
bears an owl-child. Maui is kind to the owl. Once he is taken prisoner
and is to be offered in sacrifice at Moali‘i. Hina and the owl, hearing
of his danger, follow him. The owl releases him and Hina sits down,
covers him with her clothing and pretends to pick fleas. Thus he is
saved. <span id="fr_574"></span>[8](#fn_574)

 

4\. *Kauai versions*: (A) *Birth*. Hina, the mother of Maui, dreams in
Kahiki of surf riding at Wailua on Kauai with a handsome man. Her
brother Nu-lo-hiki turns himself into a canoe in which Hina sails to
Wailua and takes for her husband the man of her dreams. This man is
Makali‘i who has come from

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

the skies, to which he returns after the birth of Maui and his eight
brothers. The canoe is left at Molokua and becomes the first coconut
tree on the island. Up this tree Maui climbs to visit his father.

\(D\) *Fishing*. If Maui can hook the fish Luehu on the night of Lono,
he can draw the islands together. The nine alae birds (mud hens) give
warning to Luehu of his approach. His mother teaches him to make an
image in his place and himself hide and seize the youngest alae. The
place where he catches the bird is shown in a taro patch near the navel
stone of Holoholoku. He now catches the big fish, and the islands would
have drawn together had he not, contrary to his mother's warning, taken
into his canoe a bailer that comes floating on the water and which turns
into a beautiful woman. The crowds cheer the wonder, the brothers turn
to look, and the big fish escapes the hook and the islands slide apart
again. <span id="fr_575"></span>[9](#fn_575)

 

5\. *Hilo* (*Hawaii*) *versions*: (F1) *Rescue of mother*. Hina, mother
of Maui, lives in a cave by the Wailuku river in Hilo on Hawaii where
she beats bark cloth. While Maui is away at Aleha-ka-la (now called
Hale-a-ka-la) snaring the sun, Lonokaeho (some say Kuna the eel) comes
to woo her and when she refuses him he almost drowns her. She calls to
Maui for help and he throws about Lono-kaeho the snares with which he
has overcome the sun and turns him into a rock which stands there today.
The stone image of Hina could in old days be seen with water dripping
from its breasts, but a landslide has covered it. <span
id="fr_576"></span>[10](#fn_576)

 

6\. *Waianae* (*Oahu*) *versions*: (A) *Birth*. Akalana is the father,
Hina-kawea the mother of Maui-a-ka-lana and his two brothers, Maui-mua,
Maui-ikiiki. Maui and his mother live in a cave on the south side of
Waianae on Oahu where Hina makes her tapa. The fishhook Manai-a-ka-lani,
the snare with which Maui snared the sun, the places where he made his
adzes, are to be seen there to this day. The father of Maui goes to
Kahiki and his descendants people all the lands of the southern ocean as
far as New Zealand. <span id="fr_577"></span>[11](#fn_577)

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

\(D\) *Fishing*. Maui-kupua, his mother and brothers live at Ulehawa,
Maui and his mother in a cave called Kane-ana, in Waianae district. Maui
wishes to unite the islands. His mother sends him to Ka-alae-nui-a-hina,
who tells him he must hook Uniho-kahi at the fishing station of
Ponaha-ke-one off Ulehawa. Maui and his brothers paddle out to the
fishing ground with the hook Manai-a-ka-lani. He tells his brothers to
catch the bailer (kaliu) they will see floating by, and himself takes it
into the canoe. When they reach the fishing station the bailer has
become transformed into a beautiful woman. She accompanies Maui's hook
into the sea and bids Uniho-kahi open his mouth, as she and Maui have
been disputing about the number of his teeth. When he obeys she hooks
him fast. The brothers paddle. Maui bids them not look back; but they
disobey, the hook comes loose, and the islands separate again.

(F2) *Rescue of wife from bat*. On another occasion the brothers go
fishing. All catch sharks except Maui, who hooks a moi fish and an ulua.
He has taken these to the heiau Lua-eha and has swallowed half of a
fish, beginning at the head, when he looks up and sees
Pe‘ape‘a-maka-walu (Eight-eyed bat) making off with his wife Kumulama.
He drops the fish but is unable to over-take the abductor. His mother
Hina sends him to his grand-father Ku-olo-kele in the land of
Ke-ahu-moa, where he sees a humpbacked man coming, hurls a stone at him,
and straightens out his back. The stone may be seen today at Waipahu
where Ku-olo-kele hurled it. The grateful grandfather shows Maui how to
fashion a bird-shaped ship (a kite) out of feathers, ti leaves, and ieie
vine, in which he flies through the air to Moanaliha and sees "the
houses of Limaloa" and the people gathered on the shore. The chief
Pe‘ape‘a orders the strange bird brought into the house. When the chief
sleeps, Maui waits until all eight eyes are closed and then cuts off the
chief's head and flies away with his wife to Oahu, where he drains all
eight of the bat's eyes in a cup of awa.

\(G\) *Death*. Maui goes to live in Hilo on Hawaii and makes himself
unpopular with his tricks. He one day visits the home of Kane and
Kanaloa and their party at Alakahi in Waipio valley and attempts to
spear with a sharp stick the bananas they are roasting by the fire. He
is detected and his brains dashed out.

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

\[paragraph continues\] They color the side of Alakahi peak and tinge
red the shrimps in the stream. A rainbow is formed of his blood. <span
id="fr_578"></span>[12](#fn_578)

No comprehensive study of Maui variants can here be attempted. An
interesting comparison with Stimson's findings from the Tuamotus will be
useful as containing some fresh and striking similarities with Hawaiian
myth, either in the Maui cycle itself or in other connections which link
with it.

*Tuamotus*. (*a*) *Composite version*. Maui-tikitiki-a-Ataraga is the
child of Ataraga by Huahega whom Ataraga seeks at her bathing place. He
snares the sun; gains his real father's recognition; slays Mahuika;
fishes up Tahiti and Little Tahiti; rescues Hina from Tuna the eel and,
when Tuna follows with a flood, stays the water by exposing his phallus,
then kills Tuna, from whose head springs the first coconut; when Peka
steals Hina, he gets into the body of a golden pheasant and, flying to
Peka's home, gets taken in as a pet in spite of the mother's warning,
cuts off Peka's head, and flies away with Hina; transforms Hina's lover
Ri, and his friend who comes to seek vengeance, into dogs; when he sees
Huahega's hair turning gray, goes to exchange stomachs with Rori the sea
slug in order that men may not die, but his brothers raise a shout and
he vomits it up again and hence men die. <span
id="fr_579"></span>[13](#fn_579)

(*b*) *Anaa version*. Maui-tikitiki (Wonder worker the vigorous) is
fifth son of Ataraga and the chiefess Huahega, daughter of the magician
Mahuike who controls fire, to whose home Huahega retires after the birth
of her fifth son. He gains recognition by his father, seeks his mother
and gains recognition by her family, but, refused by Mahuike a house
like his older brothers, he kills Mahuike in a tossing contest. He
snares the sun with a rope made from the hairs of his mother's head.
With the help of his brothers he fishes up the land of Havaiki from the
ocean bottom. He takes to wife the daughter of Tiki, who is Tuna's wife,
and kills Tuna, from whose head springs the coconut tree named
Niu-roa-i-Havaiki. Peka-nui (Great bat) carries off Hina and Maui
changes into a snipe, follows "the road of the

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

bird," slays Peka as in the other version, and recovers his wife. He
falls ill and is told to crawl into the shell of Tupa the crab so that
he may change his skin and go on living like the crab. In order to do so
he must swallow Rori-tau's entrails, but as he is doing this his
brothers come along and cause him to vomit them up. He turns Hina's
lover Ri and Ri's friend Togio into dogs. Maui's brothers go to the sun;
one is killed in the sun's heat, the other returns and Maui goes to get
his brother's body (or pretends to go) to bury it in the heavens. He
makes his marae tapu while pretending absence on an errand to the sun,
so that he may enjoy, without his mother's knowledge, the two girls
(from the heavens), the Dawn-maid and the Maid-of-the-Moon. He sends
home the Dawn-maid but keeps the Maid-of-the-Moon as his wife. <span
id="fr_580"></span>[14](#fn_580)

 

All the familiar incidents of the Polynesian Maui cycle except that of
pushing up the sky are contained in these Tuamotu versions. The parallel
to the Hawaiian story of Maui and the eight-eyed bat is very close. The
incident in the Tuamotu story of the religious tapu imposed in order to
conceal an amorous affair is to be compared with the Hawaiian Wakea and
Papa infidelity episode in which Wakea imposes tapu nights in order to
embrace his daughter Ho‘ohoku-ka-lani. A close parallel also occurs at
the conclusion of the Laieikawai romance, where the sun-god husband
pretends an errand to earth in order to gratify his passion for his
wife's sister. Hina-nui-a-(ka)lana is named in the chant of the birth of
islands as mother of the priestly island Molokai, called Molokai-a-Hina,
whom Kulu-waiea (Wakea), husband of Haumea (Papa), takes during his
wife's absence. <span id="fr_581"></span>[15](#fn_581) This is the Hina
called Hina-kawea, says Thrum, who is named as the mother of the Maui
brothers and wife of Akalana on the Ulu genealogy. <span
id="fr_582"></span>[16](#fn_582) The Kipahulu story of the malo, through
wearing which Hina conceives the wonder child, is an obvious version of
the Tuamotu story of Tiki hiding his phallus in a heap of sand in order
to beget a child by Hina. <span id="fr_583"></span>[17](#fn_583) The
final curious scene in the Maui Tuamotu story with its allusion to

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

the life of the crab as symbol of rebirth has also a parallel form in
the Hawaiian. Kepelino writes: "According to the Hawaiian story, man
lived like the crab, he came out of the first shell and lived in that
soft condition until he grew hard again. Thus man lived, became old,
creeping, yellow like the yellowed hala leaf, eyelashes few like a
rat's, then he returned again to youth, became beautiful once more, the
body grew as it had before, became old, and so on." <span
id="fr_584"></span>[18](#fn_584)

Maui stories from other groups lack any reference to the "strifes" of
Maui over the kava, and the killing of the Kia (post) brothers of Hina,
with which the Kumulipo series opens. A close parallel occurs in the
opening scenes of the legend of Iro (Hilo) from Rarotonga, not only of
the assertion of rights in the kava feast but also to the mysterious
birth of Maui.

Iro-ma-oata is son of Moe-tara-uri of Vavau and his cousin, the
beautiful Akimano, wife of Pou-ariki of Kuporu. Moe-tarauri seeks her
out during the absence of her husband and leaves her before the child is
born. In their games the child shows magical powers above those of his
older brothers. When they go to learn the sacred chants, he follows and
gets them so readily that his teachers marvel. Hearing his teachers sigh
for the good food, kava, and pig which are denied them, he takes up the
spear of his real father, of whose identity he is as yet unaware, and
attacks with it and kills the keepers of these foods. When his supposed
father Pou(post)-ariki is angry and uses words of insult, he obtains
from his mother the secret of his birth and goes forth to make himself
known to Moe-tara-uri. <span id="fr_585"></span>[19](#fn_585)

\[paragraph continues\] Although Maui is not here named and Iro's
further adventures have little to do with the strifes of Maui, it is to
be noted that Tongan Maui stories are much concerned, like this Iro
story, with encounters with monsters, such as the dragging up of a great
eel and the killing of a biting tree. The Maui fishing tale from Kauiki
tells of fishing up Pimoe, a legend which is handed down today in the
story of Kuula,

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

god of fishing stations, and which is evidently closely connected with
the tale of Tuna the eel, husband of Hina, and with the Tuamotu Turi
story. The "biting tree" uprooted by Maui, or by some other hero of the
South Seas, may be the kava strife noted in the Kumulipo series. <span

<span id="fn_586"></span>[237:20](hm18.htm#fr_586) A complete
bibliography to date of Maui material is under preparation. The
following are useful:

1\. A classified list of references to Maui myths in the *Journal of the
Polynesian Society* (*JPS* 38 \[1928\]: 15-16).

2\. Article on "Maui" in Tregear, *Maori-Polynesian Dictionary*.

3\. Dixon, *Oceanic Mythology*, 41-56 and notes.

For distinct centers see:

MAORI: White 2: 62-127; Taylor, 124-133; Grey, 10-35; Percy Smith, *MPS*
3: 145-146, 174-182.

TAHITI: Henry, 427-433, 615-621; Baessler, *ZE* 37: 920-924.

MARQUESAS: Handy, *Bul.* 69: 12-18, 103 (Tikitiki, 122-124); Von den
Steinen, *Kunst*, 2: 110-112.

NIUE (Maui-Tikitikilaga): Loeb, *Bul.* 32: 209-213.

MANGAIA: Gill, 51-63 (77-80).

MANAHIKI: Gill, 63-76; Turner, 278-279.

RAKAHANGA: Buck, *Bul.* 99: 85-86.

TONGA: Collocott, *FL* 32: 45-58 (summary of text with French
translation in *Anthropos* 12-13: 1026-1046 \[1917-1918\]; 14-15;
125-142 \[1919-1920\]); Gifford, *Bul.* 8: 21-24.

SAMOA: Fraser, *RSNSW* 25: 79-83; Stuebel, 64-65; Turner, 209-211;
Stair, 238-239; Krämer 1: 393 (who equates Maui with Tagaloa-a-ui, child
of the Sun).

This list does not take into account the equally important Maui
equivalents such as Qat or Tangaloa in the South Seas, or the
over-lapping of the Maui cycle of adventures with those of other hero
cycles, as suggested in the Iro cycle and that of Wakes and Tiki. The
study of the Maui cycle now under way by Dr. Luomala will clear up many
obscure points in existing Maui variants.
