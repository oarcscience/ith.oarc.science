### HAWAIILOA AND PAAO MIGRATIONS

THE story of Hawaii-loa, called also Ke-kowa-i-Hawaii, belongs to the
Kumuhonua legend and recounts the peopling of the group from the south
under four brothers, sons of Aniani-ka-lani, named Ki, Kanaloa,
La‘akapu, and Hawaii-loa. Ki peoples Tahiti, Borabora, Huahine, Tahea,
Ra‘iatea, and Mo‘orea. Kanaloa peoples Nukuhiwa, Uapou, Tahuata, Hiwaoa,
and the rest of the Marquesas. His wife comes from the man-eating
Taeohae and hence come the man-eaters of Nu‘uhiwa, Fiji, Farapara,
Paumotu, and the islands west. Hawaii-loa peoples the Hawaiian group, of
which there were at that time but the two islands, Hawaii and Maui, but
later the other islands "rose out of the sea."

(*a*) *Fornander version*. Hawaii-loa is born on the east coast of
Ka-aina-kai-melemele-a-Kane (Land of the yellow sea of Kane). He makes
long fishing excursions, sometimes of months at a time, with his chief
navigator Makali‘i (Eyes of the chief) who is an expert in star lore
(kilo-hoku), and on one of these they steer east and find a fertile land
where coconuts and awa grow. Some time after their return he migrates to
this land with his family and a great following, but as he alone takes
his wife and children, the whole Hawaiian race is descended from the one
stock. From time to time he voyages south to bring back mates for his
children out of his brother Ki's family. He brings Ki's oldest son
Tu-nui-ai-a-to-atua as husband for his favorite daughter Oahu, and their
son Tu-nui-atea is born at Keauhou on Hawaii and the district of Puna
named for the father's district, Puna-auia, in Tahiti. He brings
Te-ari‘i-tinorua (-double-bodied) from Tahiti to become a wife for
Tu-nui-atea; Ke-ali‘imaewa-lani (Kauai) is their son, from whom the Kona
people are descended. The son and grandson of Tu-nui-atea, Ke-li‘ialia
and Ke-mili-a, are born in Tahiti, but the great-grandson Eleeleua-lani
or Ke-li‘i-ku is born on Hawaii. Ka-oupe-ali‘i is

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

his wife. From a child of Eleeleua-lani and a chief brought from Tahiti
named Te-ari‘i-apa (perhaps -oupe) are said to spring the Kohala people.
Hawaii-loa's wife Hualalai bears her last child Hamakua and is buried on
the mountain of Hawaii that bears her name.

Hawaii-loa discovers on one of his visits south that his brother Ki has
abandoned the family gods Ku, Kane, and Lono and taken the man-eating
god Ku-waha-ilo as his god. He therefore passes a law called Papa-enaena
that communication shall be shut off with the islands to the south. He
sails northwest with Iao as his guiding star and lands in the country of
the "people with slanting eyes," travels west and north over the land,
and brings back "some white men and marries them to native women." He
voyages to Kapakapaua-a-Kane to teach his son Ku-nui-akea navigation and
brings back two men whom he places under his young son Kauai as land
stewards over the two rock islets of Lehua and Nihoa off Kauai, called
after their names.

From Hawaii-loa's son Ku-nui-akea spring the high chiefs with the strict
tapu (welo-ali‘i); from Makali‘i spring the commoners (welo kanaka). The
kahunas belong to the chief class. In the time of Ku-nui-akea comes
Tahiti-nui, a grandchild of Ki, from Tahiti, lands at the southwest
point of Kahoolawe (Ka-lae-i-Kahiki), and settles East Maui, hence the
name Kahiki-nui for a district of Maui. Thus the descendants of Ki and
Hawaii-loa people the whole group.

 

(*b*) *Kepelino version*. Hawaii-nui is a fisherman from lands adjoining
Kahiki-honua-kele. He knows the sea called "Sea where the fish run"
(O-kai-holo-a-ka-i‘a) which used to lie where these islands now lie. He
sailed from Kahiki-honua-kele and discovered these islands, first Kauai,
then Oahu, then the Maui group, then Hawaii, which he named after
himself. The other islands he named after his children, and various land
divisions after his eight navigators who sailed with him, of whom
Makali‘i was chief. To return to Kahiki they sailed west guided by the
star Hoku-loa.

 

(*c*) *Thrum version*. After the chief's first visit to the Hawaiian
group he returns to seek his brothers, whom he has left

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

in the south, and finding his brother Ki in Kahiki he brings Ki's
firstborn son Tu-nui-ai-a-te-atua to be a husband for his favorite
daughter Oahu. Their child Ku-nui-akea is born at Keauhou in Puna on the
island of Hawaii, a place named after Tu-nui's birthplace in Puna-auia
in Tahiti. This child becomes a chief of the highest rank and from his
line are descended the high chiefs (hoali‘i) of these islands. Another
grandchild of Ki called Tahiti-nui settles upon East Maui, from whom the
district of Kahiki-nui is named. <span id="fr_925"></span>[1](#fn_925.md)

This Tu-nui-ai-a-te-atua is probably to be equated with
Kahanai-a-ke-akua (The adopted of the gods) of Oahu story, who is
brought up in Waolani by Kane and Kanaloa, marries on Hawaii, and
becomes ruling chief over the island of Oahu with the Mu, Wa, and
Menehune people as his servants. <span id="fr_926"></span>[2](#fn_926.md)

The names of certain families of chiefs survive out of this early period
of intercourse with the South Seas, before migration legends to Hawaii
begin to take on the color of actual history. The Waha-nui family of
Oahu is one of these. The Kamauaua family of Molokai is another. The
Pele migration and the coming of the "gods" Kane and Kanaloa perhaps
belong rather to myth than legend, nevertheless they have their
migration story and belong to the early period. Hikapoloa of Hawaii has
a definite place in early tradition. The Keikipa‘anea family of Kauai is
represented by a riddling chief of early fame whose legend has been
written out at length by a Hawaiian compiler under the name of
Ka-lani-ali‘i-loa (The great heavenly chief). Place names, chants, and
ritual allusions, as well as family genealogies, unite to give these
names traditional significance in spite of the fabulous nature of the
legends to which they are attached.

Of Makali‘i, the chief navigator of Hawai‘iloa in the Kumuhonua legend
of the settling of the group, from whom are said to have descended the
class of commoners (welo kanaka) as distinguished from the chiefs (welo
ali‘i) represented by the family of Hawaii-loa, no connected legend is
told. In the

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

mythical story of Kaulu, Makali‘i is represented as the seer of Kane and
Kanaloa to whose place in the heavens messengers resort in order to make
use of his powers of divination, and who is completely bullied into
submission by the terrible Kaulu. In the Aukele legend he is connected
with the Pele family as uncle of Na-maka-o-ka-ha‘i and is again worsted
by the young hero, who flies up to the heavens to make the acquaintance
of his wife's relatives without waiting for her to give them warning of
his coming. The story includes a glowing description of the wife of
Makali‘i:

"Her skin was as red as fire, on coming out of the house, her beauty
would overshadow the rays of the sun, so that darkness would cover the
land, the red rain would be seen approaching; the fog also, and after
these things, then the fine rain, then the red water would flow and the
lightning play in the heavens. After this, the form of Malanaikuaheahea
would be seen coming along over the tips of the fingers of her servants,
in all her beauty. The sun shone at her back and the rainbow was as
though it were her footstool." <span id="fr_927"></span>[3](#fn_927.md)

As a settler on Hawaiian soil Makali‘i is rather consistently connected
with the island of Kauai. He is called a chief of Waimea on the
Maweke-Moikeha line, and Nae-kapu-lani, wife of the chief
Mano-ka-lani-po, after whom the name Kauai-o-Mano-ka-lani-po was given
to the island, is called his child (-a-Makali‘i). <span
id="fr_928"></span>[4](#fn_928) Ku-ka-lani-ehu (Ku the heavenly blond.md),
the parent of Wakea's wife Papa, is said to be sixth in descent from
Makali‘i. <span id="fr_929"></span>[5](#fn_929.md) In the Kahuoi legend
Kinikuapu‘u sails from Kauai with two fishermen whose names are
constantly connected with Makali‘i, as in the string figure chant which
runs,

There are Ieiea and Po‘opalu,  
The fishermen of Makali‘i;  
They are whipping the long fishcord. <span
id="fr_930"></span>[6](#fn_930.md)

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

In the legend of Kamapua‘a, Makali‘i appears as ruling chief over the
island of Kauai, who is driven into the uplands by his invading nephew
just as, in the Moikeha-Kila legend, he is defeated and banished by his
nephew Kila. His name is given to the month on the Hawaiian calendar "in
which the food (plant) bears leaf," corresponding to our December or
January when the sun turns north again, a season marked by the withering
of the tender shoots of the ilima flower and the blossoming of the
medicinal koolau. <span id="fr_931"></span>[7](#fn_931.md) At this season
the legendary Makali‘i prepared his land for planting, and because of
his fame as an agriculturist the month was named in his honor. It was in
the month of Makali‘i, says the chant, on a night when lightning
flashed, that the chief Kauai was born, the chief from whom the island
ruled over by Makali‘i is said to have taken its new name. <span
id="fr_932"></span>[8](#fn_932.md)

According to the Hawaiiloa legend, the name of Makali‘i refers to his
post as navigator, "Eyes of the chief." In the Kila story the name is
derived from the pattern called "Little eyes" of the net in which the
plant foods of Kahiki were drawn up out of reach of Kila's expedition.
It is during the seasonal festival of the Makahiki that the symbolic
scattering of edible plants from the net of Makali‘i takes place in
order to decide the chances of the food supply for the coming year. Now
the rat leaves the plains for the uplands and begins to nibble at the
edible fernstalks while the owl, "thus deprived of its natural food,"
feeds upon berries, remarks Kepelino of the Makali‘i season. <span
id="fr_933"></span>[9](#fn_933.md) Something of this calendar meaning must
enter into the legend of Makali‘i as mythical navigator and seer of the
early settlers of the northwestern island of Kauai who, through his
knowledge of the stars, regulated for them the planting season and
foretold success in agriculture. <span id="fr_934"></span>[10](#fn_934.md)
Hawaiians call stars useful in such observations after the famous
navigator. Not only is Aldebaran, traditional steering star for
Hawaii-loa, named Makali‘i,

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

but the Pleiades also are called "the cluster of Makali‘i" (na
huihui-a-Makali‘i) or "nets of Makali‘i" (na-koko-a-Makali‘i).
"Makali‘i's rainbow-colored gourd-net hangs above" (Huihui koko a
Makali‘i kau iluna), is the saying. <span
id="fr_935"></span>[11](#fn_935.md) Other stars are named "the bailers of
Makali‘i" (na ka o Makali‘i), "the wives of Makali‘i" (na wahine o
Makali‘i). <span id="fr_936"></span>[12](#fn_936.md)

The tradition of Makali‘i as the regulator of food plants may come from
Tahiti, where the Pleiades are also called Matari‘i. When these first
sparkle in the horizon toward Orion's belt (Mere) in the twilight of
evening (November 20), the season of plenty begins, and it lasts until
these stars descend below the horizon in the twilight of evening. <span
id="fr_937"></span>[13](#fn_937.md) In Mangaia, the appearance of Matariki
about the middle of December above the eastern horizon at sunset marks
the new year. The story says:

The Pleiades were originally one star, and so brilliant that Tane was
angry. He got Sirius and Aldebaran to help him, and pursued Matariki,
who fled behind a stream. Sirius drained the waters dry and Tane flung
Aldebaran and broke Matariki into six little pieces. <span
id="fr_938"></span>[14](#fn_938.md)

In Samoa, (Maka)li‘i is the descendant of Lu the wanderer (or
circumciser, see Luanu‘u), son of Lu-a-itu, who weds the daughter of the
lord of Atafu north of Samoa. Li‘i is swallowed by a fish and deified
under the name of the Pleiades. Hence Atonga(-loa) is half spirit, half
man. <span id="fr_939"></span>[15](#fn_939.md) In the legend of the
settling of Manu‘a, four children are offered to the sun: Li‘i is
swallowed by a fish and deified as the Pleiades, the other three reach
and settle Manu‘a, the sister as wife of its chief and mother of
Lu-a-Tongaloa, who became the first chief of Upolo. <span
id="fr_940"></span>[16](#fn_940.md) In Tonga, Mataliki "probably refers to
the Pleiades," says Collocott. <span id="fr_941"></span>[17](#fn_941.md)
Rakahanga people worship the Pleiades. <span
id="fr_942"></span>[18](#fn_942.md) Mataliki is the principal god of
Pukapuka. <span id="fr_943"></span>[19](#fn_943.md)

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

### PUKAPUKA MYTH OF MATALIKI

When Maui fished up Tonga, some gods who lived undersea wandered in the
air. One traveled to a rock which had emerged from the water at the
place where Pukapuka now is, and saw a godlike man come from it, so he
swam away and did not return. This man was Mataliki. To him therefore
the island belonged, and he was a god. He found a wife at an island
called Tongaleleva and they had two children, Te-muli-vaka and
Te-mata-kiate. Tongaloa gods were invited to build up the island but,
fearing union with Samoa, the Pukapuka people asked them to stop
building reefs. The western division of the channel which the Sun made
by stamping his foot, which marks the line of the taro beds, is called
Te-muli-wenua (The back of the earth); the eastern division is
Te-mata-wenua (The front of the earth). <span
id="fr_944"></span>[20](#fn_944.md)

Hikapoloa has a place in legend as traditional ruler of Kohala district
on Hawaii corresponding to that of Makali‘i on Kauai. As an epithet
attached to the names of Kane, Ku, and Lono it represents them as a
joint godhead "before heaven and earth were created," an event which, so
far as Hawaiian legendary history is concerned, seems to have taken
place on Oahu and may be ascribed to the introduction of Kane worship
and the setting up of a kahuna class. The phrase Ke-ali‘i-Hikapoloa is
said to be equivalent to "Almighty god." <span
id="fr_945"></span>[21](#fn_945.md) "Taken by Hikapoloa" (Lame aku la
Hikapoloa) occurs in a chant of Kamehameha's day as a phrase for
death. <span id="fr_946"></span>[22](#fn_946.md) The place in Kohala where
the Makahiki god was kept, on the way up from the present heiau of
Mo‘okini, is called Hikapoloa. <span id="fr_947"></span>[23](#fn_947.md)

It is to this earlier period of colonization and the spread of new
ruling families with their rival gods that, according to some
interpreters, such an allusion as this from the fourth era of the
Kumulipo refers with its indication of a new line of chiefs and the
establishment of a family which becomes a determining factor in Hawaiian
genealogical history:

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

Heap up the fire of La‘a there,  
The ape plant from over the ocean,  
Those of the sea take to the land,  
Creep this way and that,  
The family of creepers multiply,  
The ancient line and the new intermingle,  
The new line becomes the genealogy of the chiefs,  
Their offspring become the best of the land,  
Fathomless, a deep darkness their rank,  
Kane-of-the-night-of-deep-darkness is born.

Tradition ascribes to Paao the introduction of human sacrifice into the
temple ritual, the walled heiau, and the red-feather girdle as a sign of
rank; all typical, says Handy, of late Tahitian culture and not found in
Samoa. Other institutions ascribed to him are the pulo‘ulo‘u tapu sign,
the prostrating tapu (tapu moe or -o), and the feather god Kaili; some
would call Paao rather than La‘a-mai-kahiki the introducer of image
worship. Most of these things characterize the Ra‘iatea ritual. That
Paao took his ideas from Tahiti is further indicated by reference to
"Vavau" and "Upolo" as places where he owned land, probably old
districts so named in northern Tahiti in the Aha-roa division of that
island, and the name Aha-ula (later called Waha-ula) for the first heiau
erected by his party on Hawaii suggests such a connection. Paao is said
to have brought the puhala (pandanus) to Kohala. He brought soil from
the hills and planted trees about the heiau, still standing, of Wahaula,
some of which seem to have survived to Fornander's day. Stones near the
heiau of Mo‘okini are pointed out today as "Paao's canoe," his "paddles"
and "fishhook," and the fields he cultivated are called "the weeds of
Paao" (na maau o Paao) and left untouched for fear of storm. To him are
ascribed those severities of religious observance which built up the
power of chief and priest during this later period of migration from the
south. The land was revolutionized and all the old kahunas were put to
death during Paao's time, says Kepelino. <span
id="fr_948"></span>[24](#fn_948.md)

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

### PAAO MIGRATION LEGEND

(*a*) *Emerson version*. The priest Paao and his older brother Lono-pele
have a bitter quarrel. Lono-pele accuses Paao's son of stealing tapu
food and Paao insists on cutting open his son's stomach to prove the
accusation false. He broods over his son's death and builds a double
canoe to leave for other lands. Lono-pele's son drums upon the canoes
with his fingers while they are under tapu and Paao has him slain for a
sacrifice for the canoes and buried beneath them, where the buzzing of
flies reveals to the father the child's dead body.

Paao acts as priest for the voyage, Makaalawa as navigator and
astronomer, Halau as sailing master, Pu-oleole as trumpeter; and there
are forty paddlers, besides stewards and awa chewers. Na-mauu-o-Malawa
(The grasses of Malawa), sister of Paao, accompanies the party.
Kanaloa-nui the canoe is called (Or Ka-nalo-a-muia, The buzzing of
flies). They pass under the Kaakoheo bluff and the prophet Makuakaumana
asks to be taken aboard. Paao says all the places are full except the
projection of the stern. Makuakaumana leaps and gains this position (but
this incident probably belongs to the return trip to Tahiti).

Lono-pele sends as storm winds Kona-ku, Kona-nui-a-niho, Moae,
Kona-heapuku, Kiki-ao, Lele-ula, Lele-kuilua, followed by a north wind,
Ho‘olua, and a monster bird, the Iwa, called Ke-kaha-ka-iwa-i-na-pali.
Paao invokes Lono and first a school of aku fish, then one of opelu come
to quiet the waves. These fish have ever since been sacred to the Paao
family.

Paao lands first in Puna on Hawaii, where he builds the heiau at Pulama
\[now called Waha-ula (Red mouth) but formerly Aha-ula\]. He goes on to
Kohala and erects the famous heiau of Mo‘okini at Pu‘uepa, the stones
for which are passed from hand to hand a distance of nine miles from the
seacoast.

 

(*b*) *Kamakau version*. Upon Paao's prayer to the god of ocean
(Kanaka-o-kai, says Green), the aku and opelu fish "leaped up and
skipped in the waters and quieted the waves." At the time of the
prophet's leap, several other "gods" attempted

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

the feat and were dashed to death. His success is heralded in a chant:

"You are like the flying fish  
Skimming easily through the sky,  
Traversing the dark waters of ocean,  
O Halulu at the foundation house of heaven,  
Kane, Makua-kau-mana,  
The prophet who made the circuit of the island,  
Who circled the pillars of Kahiki."

(Paao brings with him several mo‘o kupua from Kahiki, all worshiped as
sacred stones on Oahu today. These are Makapu‘u, Ihiihi-lau-akea, and
Malei. <span id="fr_949"></span>[25](#fn_949.md) Makua-kau-mana returns to
Kahiki but Paao remains on Hawaii and his bones rest in the cave of
Pu‘uwepa in Kohala. <span id="fr_950"></span>[26](#fn_950.md) An early
school composition makes Paao brother to Pele. <span
id="fr_951"></span>[27](#fn_951).md)

### PAAO AND PILI-KAAIEA LEGEND

Paao makes a return voyage to Tahiti (starting from Kapua in Kona
district, says Thrum) in order to secure a relative of pure blood who
can compete in rank as ruling chief with the blueblood families of other
islands, Hawaiian chiefs having intermarried carelessly with families of
petty chiefs. The invitation is preserved in an old chant (Emerson
text):

E Lono! e Lono- e! e Lonokaeho!  
Lonokulani, ali‘i o Ka-ulu-o-nana,  
Eia na wa‘a, kau mai a i,  
E hoi e noho ia Hawaii-kuauli.  
He aina loa‘a i ka moana,  
I hoea mai loko o ka ale,  
I ka halehale poipu a Kanaloa,  
He koa-kea i halelo i ka wai,  
I lou i ka makau a ka lawaia,  
A ka lawaia nui o Kapuhe‘euanu‘u-la,  
A pae na wa‘a, kau mai; <span id="page_373">p. 373</span>  
E holo e ai ia Hawaii, he moku;  
He moku Hawaii,  
He moku Hawaii no Lonokaeho e noho.

"O Lono, Lono, Lono-ka-eho!  
Lono descended from the gods, chief of the fertile land of Nana,  
Here are canoes, come aboard,  
Return and dwell on green-backed Hawaii,  
A land discovered in the ocean,  
Risen up out of the waves,  
From the very depths of the sea,  
A piece of white coral left dry in the ocean,  
Caught by the hook of the fisherman,  
The great fisherman of Kapaahu,  
The great fisherman of Kapuhe‘euanu‘u;  
When the canoes land, come aboard,  
Sail away and possess Hawaii; a land,  
A land is Hawaii,  
A land is Hawaii for Lonokaeho to dwell in."

\[paragraph continues\] Lono-kaeho declines the invitation but sends in
his place Pili-kaaiea (or -auau), called a "grandchild" of Lana-ka-wai
on the Ulu line, but born and brought up in Kahiki. Pili wins the hearts
of the people and from him descend the chiefs of Hawaii on the Ulu line
down to the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The priesthood
established by Paao under the Ku ritual descended through an unbroken
line of kahunas to Hewahewa, under whom the tapus were broken and the
old heiau worship was abolished after the death of Kamehameha in
1819. <span id="fr_952"></span>[28](#fn_952.md)

 

The Paao migration legend introduces stock episodes in Polynesian
stories of long voyages. Obstacles sent to oppose a voyage are overcome
through the interposition of a god, as in the Waha-nui legend; not in
this case referred to the god who has made the supernatural leap to gain
passage, but the

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

connection is here probably lost. The leap itself as a means of testing
divinity is not an imaginary episode. Hocart says that in the Lau
islands the choice of a ruling chief was determined by challenging the
men of rank to jump off a point and catch at a banyan tree. Only the man
brave enough to accept the challenge and strong enough to make the leap
was worthy to be chief. <span id="fr_953"></span>[29](#fn_953.md) In Hawaii
leaping down cliffs was practised as an asset in war.

The introductory episode occurs in almost identical form in the Maori,
so much so as to lead Stokes to argue for an identity between Paao and
Hiro (Hilo). It is, however, clearly a type episode attached to more
than one figure in Maori story.

Maori. (*a*) Whiro-tu-tupua, after quarreling with his older brother Hua
about the canoe they are building, strangles Hua's son Tao-ma-kati
because he eats the choice bits given to the builders, and hides his
body in the chips under the canoe (or kills him as an offering for the
canoe launching). The body is revealed by a buzzing blowfly. The two
fight and the child's father is defeated (and he and his family are
killed and eaten). <span id="fr_954"></span>[30](#fn_954.md)

(*b*) Whiro kills Ngana-te-irihia because he snatches the choice bits of
food, and hides the body under the canoe Whatu-te-ihi. A blowfly reveals
the body. Whiro wins in battle with the child's father. <span
id="fr_955"></span>[31](#fn_955.md)

(*c*) The body of the son of Manaia, who has been killed by Hoturoa (or
Rata) while the canoes are building to sail to New Zealand, is revealed
by the god assuming the body of a fly and buzzing about the body. <span
id="fr_956"></span>[32](#fn_956.md)

(*d*) Uenuku kills Hoimatua's child for stumbling on the threshold, and
Hoimatua's relative Turi kills Uenuku's in revenge and subsequently
migrates in the Aotea canoe to escape Uenuku's vengeance. <span
id="fr_957"></span>[33](#fn_957.md)

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Revelation of a murder by a buzzing fly is a
common theme in Maori story. In the story of Hatupatu, parents send a
spirit in blowfly form to find the body of their child who has been
killed by his brothers for eating the birds they have preserved, and the
spirit brings the child to life. <span id="fr_958"></span>[34](#fn_958.md)
See also the Moriori story of Tu-moana's son who murders his sweetheart
for laughing at him and her dead body is revealed by a buzzing
fly, <span id="fr_959"></span>[35](#fn_959.md) and compare the Hawaiian
story of Ka-hala-o-puna whose body is revealed by an owl or bird god.

The whole incident, like most Maori stories, corresponds closely with
actual occurrences in human life. The supernatural element is introduced
into the Paao legend only through the attempt to rationalize these
occurrences in the light of belief in the part played by spirit forces
in such happenings. The buzzing fly attracted by the odor of putrifying
flesh is explained as a spirit emissary. Bad weather on a sea voyage is
laid not to meteorological disturbances, but to the sorceries of an
enemy; the schools of fish which come with clearing weather, to the
cause and not the accompaniment of the change.
