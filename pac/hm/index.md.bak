# Hawaiian Mythology

## by Martha Beckwith

#### \[1940 (no renewal)\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is Martha Beckwith's monumental study of Hawaiian mythology.
Beckwith utilized numerous texts which are today rare or hard to obtain
to construct this study. She gives all available variants of each myth
or legend, including versions from other Pacific islands including
Tahiti, Tonga, Samoa and others. This is primarily a critical edition of
the key Hawaiian myths, and Beckwith largely does not attempt to
interpret the texts, rather to examine both variant narratives and core
folklore motifs. The book covers every significant theme in Hawaiian
mythology, from the origin myths of the Hawaiian gods and goddesses, to
more recent legends of star-crossed lovers. She also covers such topics
as Kahunas (sorcerors) and Menehunes (fairies).
