### KAMAPUA‘A

ONE of the most popular figures in Hawaiian mythical narrative is the
being, half man and half hog, who goes by the name of Kama-pua‘a
(Hog-child). Tradition relates the immigration to the group of the
Kamapua‘a family during the colonizing period. An extended and racy
account of his adventures as a kupua on these islands or in Kahiki
appears in one of the fictitious narratives (kaao) collected from
Fornander informants. Local legends and nursery tales further embellish
his story. As wooer of Pele he is drawn into the Pele cycle and,
according to Kamakau, the child of Pele by Kamapua‘a becomes an
"ancestor of chiefs and commoners" on these islands. In the genealogical
chant of the Kumulipo there occurs, during the fifth period of the po,
the birth of a being half hog, half god, of whom the chant says:

His snout was of great size and with it (he) dug the earth,  
He dug until he raised a great mound,  
He raised a hill for his gods,  
A hill, a precipice in front,  
For the offspring of a pig that was born. <span

\[paragraph continues\] The "mound" raised by the pig-god may perhaps be
understood to refer to a powerful family of descendants.

The colonizing tradition represents Kamapua‘a as the grandson of the
sorceress Kamaunua-niho (Ka-mau-nui) and connects the family first with
the island of Maui, then with Oahu and Kauai, and finally extends the
adventures of the hog-man to Hawaii and Kahiki, from which land the
family originally migrated.

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

### LEGEND OF THE KAMAPUA‘A FAMILY

The chiefess Ka-maunu-a-niho comes from Kahiki with her husband Humu
(Aumu) and the chief Kalana-nu‘u-nui-kua-mamao. They land at Kalahawai
in Waihe‘e on Maui and live in the uplands of Waihe‘e, where Kamaunu
takes Kalana for her husband and Humu retires to Kahiki. Her daughter
Hina becomes the wife of Olopana, chief of the northern district of
Oahu, and has a son who is named Kahiki-honua-kele (Kahiki the land that
moved off) because of the family affiliation with Kahiki. Hina then
takes Olopana's younger brother Kahiki-ula, chief of Kauai, as her
husband and has two sons, named Kelekeleiaku(aiku?) and Kamapua‘a. <span
id="fr_504"></span>[2](#fn_504.md)

 

As a kupua, Kamapua‘a is under the special protection of ancestral gods
and himself godlike. As a man he is tall and handsome; "the big
foreigner with sparkling eyes" (ka haole nui, maka olohilohi) he is
called in chant. <span id="fr_505"></span>[3](#fn_505.md) Some say that he
has bristles down his back which he conceals under a cape. He is able to
change himself not only into a hog but also into fishes and plants of
various kinds. He is said to have escaped Pele's fire by changing
himself into the tough-skinned little fish known as the
humuhumu-nukunuku-a-pua‘a and when a pig is not available at a time of
sacrifice this fish or some other of the hog-man's forms may be
substituted, such as the coarse grass (*panicum pruriens*) called
kukae-pua‘a (pig excrement), patches of which mark his wanderings over
the islands. His plant bodies are enumerated in one of his name chants,
and the story is that he overcomes Lono-of-the-eight-foreheads-of-stone
by tangling each forehead (lae) in wild growth and the dog-man
Ku-ilio-loa by stuffing himself in his weed bodies down the dog's throat
and then cutting his way out. In these transformation fictions it is
worth noting that the shape-shifting power to change into any given form
also implies a duplication of such forms; he may himself take the form
of a hog, but at his prayer the place is filled with hogs

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

sent to his succor. He was occasionally worshiped as a god, if the
report is correct that at Wainiha, Kauai, was a small paved heiau which
had Kamapua‘a for its deity. <span id="fr_506"></span>[4](#fn_506.md)

The fictitious narrative of Kamapua‘a (Pua-pua‘a) is said to have taken
sixteen hours in the recital. <span id="fr_507"></span>[5](#fn_507.md) Most
Hawaiians declare that he was born in Kahiki, but Westervelt tells of
his birth on Oahu.

Kama-pua‘a is born as a foetus at Kalua-nui on the northern coast of
Oahu. His older brother Kahiki-honua-kele tries to throw him away, but
when his mother comes out of her bath of purification she finds him
lying on her skirt in the form of a baby pig. The brother therefore
takes the pig to his grandmother and Kamaunu recognizes her kupua
grandson and rears him until he is grown. <span
id="fr_508"></span>[6](#fn_508.md)

The adventures of the hog-man thus born to Hina include, first, his
strife with his stepfather Olopana on Oahu; second, strifes on Kauai,
first with its chief Makali‘i and his own father who is ruling under
Makali‘i, next with a rival chief in behalf of his father-in-law who has
bestowed wives upon himself and his friend; third, strife in Kahiki with
Lono-of-the-eight-foreheads-of-stone and his dog Ku-ilio-loa; fourth,
strife as the wooer of Pele on Hawaii and Maui.

### LEGEND OF KAMAPUA‘A

*Kamapua‘a and Olopana*. Kamapua‘a grows up strong and rough and is
unpopular with his stepfather Olopana, ruling chief of Koolau at Kailua.
Kamapua‘a lives in Kaliu-wa‘a valley (Leaky canoe) and is led on by the
supernatural fowl Kawauhele-moa to rob Olopana's hen roost and commit
other depredations. Four times the guards, eight hundred strong and each
time increasing in number, capture him in his hog shape and tie him to a
pole; four times his grandmother releases him with a chant. Finally all
his captors are slain except Makali‘i, who escapes to bring the report.
The whole district is aroused.

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Kamapua‘a stretches his body as a bridge up
which his house-hold escape out of the valley and he retreats to Wahiawa
and engages in farming. Olopana consults a new prophet from Kauai and
learns how Kamapua‘a may be rendered weak. Lonoaohi, the old prophet
whom Olopana has disgraced for failure to capture Kamapua‘a, takes up
the cause of the hog-man and when he is brought bound to the heiau for
sacrifice, instructs his sons Black-hog and Spotted-hog to make a mere
pretence of tying him. In the morning when Olopana and his men come for
the sacrifice, Kamapua‘a springs up and kills the chief and all the men
except Makali‘i. <span id="fr_509"></span>[7](#fn_509.md)

*Kamapua‘a on Kauai*. (*a*) Kamapua‘a repairs to Kauai where Makali‘i
the ruling chief over the greater part of the island is fighting
Kane-iki. With Lima-loa he courts Kane-iki's pretty daughters and takes
up his father-in-law's cause against his uncle. With his war club
Kahiki-kolo he kills the champions and wards off the spears thrown
against him. Makali‘i hides between the knees of Kamaunuaniho and
pacifies his nephew by reciting all the land's name chants, which the
love god Lono-iki-aweawe-aloha teaches him out of compassion. Kamapua‘a
allows him his choice of a place of banishment and he chooses to retreat
to the mountains. Then come his father Kahiki-ula and his brother
Kahiki-honua-kele to do battle. Questioned by Kamapua‘a, the father
asserts that he has no other son, and the brother replies that both his
brothers are dead; "one Pele slew and the other hung himself." At Hina's
approach Kamapua‘a withdraws lest he slay his mother. Later he pays a
visit to his parents at Kalalau and is so angry when they do not
recognize him that only by chanting all his name songs and, as a last
resort, by exposing herself naked can his mother pacify him. He finally
goes away to Kahiki with Kowea.

(*b*) Kamapua‘a swims in fish form to Kipukai on the south-east coast of
Kauai. Changing into a huge hog he roots up the growing crops. The
bristles down his back which reveal, when in human form, his hog nature,
he hides with a cape. While he is sleeping in hog form in the spring
called today Wai-a-ka-pua‘a,

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

Lima-loa rolls a stone down to crush him, but he reaches out and throws
a stone which wedges the rock on the hillside. He and Lima-loa become
friends and he helps Lima-loa to court the two lovely sisters of the
ruling chief of the Puna side of Kauai from Kipukai to Anahola, whom the
friends find combing their hair at the two rock basins called
Ka-wai-o-ka-pakilokilo (The water of the reflected image) which they are
using as looking glasses. After taking the girls as his wives, he fights
for their brother against the Kona side of the island from Koloa to
Mana. In hog form, with the hands of a man to wield the club, he kills
the Kona chiefs in battle and takes their feather capes and helmets,
which he hides under his bed. Only through a spear wound which he has
received in his hand is he discovered to the Puna chief as the one who
has kept for himself the chief's own share of the booty. For this act
Kamapua‘a is banished. <span id="fr_510"></span>[8](#fn_510.md)

 

*Kamapua‘a and Lono-ka-eho*. Kamapua‘a flees from Kauai and goes away to
Kahiki, where rival chiefs, Lonokaeho and Kowea, are at war. Kowea gives
Kamapua‘a his daughters as wives in order to win his championship.
Kamapua‘a calls upon his plant bodies to entangle the eight stone
foreheads of Lonokaeho as they strike down upon him, and when he has
killed his foe he calls upon his hog bodies to "eat up" Lono and all his
men. He then meets the dog-man Ku-ilio-loa and, stuffing his weed bodies
into the warrior's open jaws, kills him from within. <span
id="fr_511"></span>[9](#fn_511.md)

 

*Kamapua‘a and Pele*. Kamapua‘a comes to the crater of Halema‘uma‘u
(Fern house) and, appearing upon the point sacred to Pele, woos the
goddess in the form of a handsome man. Her sisters attract her attention
to him. She refuses him with insult, calling him "a pig and the son of a
pig." His love songs change to taunts and the two engage in a contest of
insulting words. He attempts to approach her, but she sends her flames
over him. Each summons his gods. Pele's brothers encompass him "above
and below" and would have smothered him had not his love-making god
lured them away at sight of a woman.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Kamapua‘a threatens to put out the fires of the
pit with deluges of water, but Pele's uncles, brothers, and the fire
tender Lono-makua keep them burning and again the hog-man's life is in
danger. His sister, chiefess of Makahanaloa, comes to his aid with fog
and rain. Hogs run all over the place. The pit fills with water. The
love-making god sees that if Pele is destroyed Kamapua‘a will be the
loser. The fires are all out, only the fire sticks remain. These the god
saves, Pele yields, and Kamapua‘a has his way with her. They divide the
districts between them, Pele taking Puna, Ka-u, and Kona (districts
periodically overrun with lava flows) and Kamapua‘a ruling Kohala,
Hamakua, Hilo (the windward districts, always moist with rain). <span
id="fr_512"></span>[10](#fn_512.md)

The two have a child named Opelu-nui-kauhaalilo who becomes ancestor of
chiefs and commoners on Hawaii (Kamakau).

Kamapua‘a leaves Hawaii and draws up a new home from the ocean depths
where he establishes a family. Pele, who now loves him, tries in vain to
draw him back with a love chant (Westervelt).

 

According to Kalakaua, the Pele myth is built up out of an actual
occurrence, in which a family of immigrants take refuge in a mountain
cavern from the unwelcome advances of the hog-man and are overwhelmed by
a stream of fiery lava which pursues the attacking party down the
mountain. The supposition is that the flames from the burning lava are
the transformed bodies of the submerged family, who live today in the
volcano and manifest themselves in its activities. It is, however, more
than probable that the story is a rationalized invention influenced by
the popular aumakua conceptions of Kalakaua's period.

*Kalakaua version*. About 1175, while the usurper Kam(a)iole is ruling
the island of Hawaii, a family of chiefs and priests from a southern
group, led by a kahuna named Moho, land at Honoapu on the Ka-u coast
and, proceeding along the coast to Puna, settle in the foothills back of
Keauhou. With Moho come

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

his sisters Pele and Ulolu and his humpbacked brother Kamakaua.
Kamapua‘a has fled to Hawaii from Oahu and, hearing of Pele's beauty, he
comes to court her. She refuses him with insult, calling him "a pig and
the son of a pig." He and his followers raid the settlement and kill all
but the immediate family, who take refuge in an underground cavern in a
cleft of the mountain. Kamapua‘a's band push on, when there suddenly
bursts forth a stream of lava, submerging the cavern and driving the
besieging party to take refuge in the sea. <span
id="fr_513"></span>[11](#fn_513.md)

 

Other Pele connections occur in the Kamapua‘a legend. The same land from
which Kamaunu and her brothers migrate is that which Aukele visits to
seek Namakaokaha‘i, older sister of Pele, and it is at least plausible
to conclude that Aukelenuiaiku is to be identified with the brother
Kelekeleiaku and possibly Kamapua‘a with Namaka's brother Kane-apua of
that romance. The names of three sisters said to have been born to Hina,
the mother of Kamapua‘a, are listed in chant among the plant gods of the
hog-man and two of them, Hau-nu‘u and Hau-lani, are names of wives of
Haumea's grandsons for whom she made herself young again to take them as
husbands. <span id="fr_514"></span>[12](#fn_514.md) The Kamaunu and Pele
families are represented in myth as hostile, although in some way
related. Malaehaa-koa (or hoa), called the kahu of Hi‘iaka, who recites
to her the hymn chanting the deeds and mysteries of Pele since the
beginning of her rule, a hymn which also names Niheu-the-mischievous and
Nuakea wife of Keoloewa of Molokai, is the same who tells Olopana how to
get control of Kamapua‘a by offering as a sacrifice objects in which the
letters *l-a-u* occur. If Kamapua‘a is equivalent to Kane-pua‘a
(Kaneapua), who is worshiped as a god of agriculture to bring rain and
abundance to the crops, he would be, like her older sister
Namakaokaha‘i, naturally pitted against Pele the fire-goddess and
consumer of vegetation. <span id="fr_515"></span>[13](#fn_515.md)

The device of using springing plants to entangle a contestant

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

or effect an escape is common in kupua stories. Hi‘iaka uses it to
overcome an evil mo‘o; Kaulana-poki‘i when she avenges the murder of her
brothers; Makani-keoe to protect his protégé; Kauakahi's sister to
obstruct the path of her brother's sweetheart or, as in the Green
version, to hide him away in a tree. Most famous of all such tree
concealments is that of Haumea when she enters a tree with her husband
in order to save him from his captors. In the Marquesas,
Ono-the-resurrected enters a temanu tree as a god and lives on
air. <span id="fr_516"></span>[14](#fn_516.md) In New Zealand,
Tu-te-koro-pango conjures up plants to obstruct the path to his
home. <span id="fr_517"></span>[15](#fn_517.md)

The Olopana at Kailua on Oahu who is Kamapua‘a's "uncle" is not to be
confused with Moikeha's brother Olopana, although it is impossible not
to suspect a confusion between Hina's desertion of her older husband for
his younger brother and Lu‘ukia's of Olopana for Moikeha. Nor is the
Lonokaeho with the foreheads of stone generally identified with the
chief of the same name at Kahiki whom Paao calls upon to come and rule
Hawaii. The coupling with his name of the great dog Ku-ilio-loa
justifies a connection with the Lono-ka-ehu (Lono the blond) who comes
to the group from Kahiki with his great dog of that name in search of
his brother. Hawaiians called "ehu," with lighter skin, brown eyes, and
curly brown hair in contrast to the darker-skinned Hawaiians with
straight black hair, are associated in native belief with the Pele
family. Outlying villages show a number of such brown-haired persons,
said to be of pure native stock.

Fiction, however, plays with these names for its own purposes and it
would be unsafe to draw any historical conclusions from the use made by
story tellers of such local associations. In Thrum's Kana legend
Lonokaeho is the fourth man of fame to whom Hakalanileo of Hawaii
appeals in vain for help to regain his wife. <span
id="fr_518"></span>[16](#fn_518.md) He is represented as the wooer of
Maui's mother Hina in her cave on the Wailuku river in Hilo, Hawaii,
while Maui is away snaring the sun. The rock (eho) into which he was
changed still stands to attest the truth of the story.

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

The attack upon Lonokaeho in Kahiki is transferred in the Kaulu legend
to Kailua, and that upon his companion to Kualoa on Oahu, the district
from which comes Lonokaeho's daughter, who marries La‘a-mai-kahiki in
the Moikeha tradition and becomes mother of La‘a's son Lauli-a-La‘a. The
"foreheads" of stone of Lonokaeho are alluded to in chant:

He mau lani pohaku na Lonokaeho,  
No lani ka lae i ponia i ka wai niu,  
I haua i ka pua‘a hiwa a Kane,  
I ka pua‘a hiwa, puawa hiwa a Lono.

"Lono-ka-eho had foreheads of stone,  
Lono's was a forehead annointed with coconut milk \[i.e., Lono belonged
to the highest class of chiefs\],  
He was worshiped \[?\] with the black pig of Kane,  
The black pig, the bundle of black awa of Lono." <span
id="fr_519"></span>[17](#fn_519.md)

\[paragraph continues\] The "foreheads" perhaps refer to eight lines of
chiefs from whom the heavenly one (lani) counts descent. Pio-ke-anuenue
(Curve of the rainbow) he is elsewhere called in allusion to the pio
rank to which he is born.

The "eight foreheads of stone" have interesting connections with the
south. For central Polynesia and westward the number eight has special
significance in sacred matters. In the Tahitian group, Ra‘iatea has
eight stones set up at the national marae to represent eight kings who
have ruled in the past and the names of these kings are given to the
eight sacred symbols of investiture of royal chiefs at
Taputapuatea. <span id="fr_520"></span>[18](#fn_520.md) Borabora (called
Vavau) and "first-born" after Ra‘iatea is divided into eight
districts. <span id="fr_521"></span>[19](#fn_521.md) Mo‘orea (called
Aimo‘o) is so divided into eight arms by the natural ridges of the
mountains as to carry the name of "the octopus" (fee). <span
id="fr_522"></span>[20](#fn_522.md) The god Maui is called "Maui of the
eight heads." <span id="fr_523"></span>[21](#fn_523.md) Eight directions of

group eight islands west of Fakarava (Havai‘i) represent independent
chieftainships. <span id="fr_525"></span>[23](#fn_525.md) In Samoa the
heavens where the gods dwell are "eight-fold." <span

Eight is a sacred number in Fiji. A Fijian giant, Thanga-walu, came into
the world two months after conception and rapidly grew to a height of
sixty feet with a forehead "eight spans high." Another giant deity has
eight eyes, another eight arms. <span id="fr_529"></span>[27](#fn_529.md)
In Tonga, Alai-aloo (Eight foreheads) is a god frequently consulted for
the cure of the sick; <span id="fr_530"></span>[28](#fn_530.md) the number
eight is a favorite to associate with mounds; <span
id="fr_531"></span>[29](#fn_531.md) Lolo-ma-tokelau's compound has a fence
of eight crosspieces. <span id="fr_532"></span>[30](#fn_532.md) On Easter
island immigrants from Mangareva have made eight enclosures. <span
id="fr_533"></span>[31](#fn_533.md)

On San Cristoval the number eight "seems to be connected with magical
powers." In the story of the snake spirit named "Eight fathoms," when
the snake is killed she comes to life again after "eight days" of rain.
She makes her house of "eight leaves." She is cut into "eight pieces"
and comes to life after "eight showers of rain." She submerges a village
with "eight waves," a feat also performed by the hero Rapuanante. <span
id="fr_534"></span>[32](#fn_534.md) To work magic a woman takes eight each
of dracena leaves, coconuts, and dog's teeth. <span
id="fr_535"></span>[33](#fn_535.md) There is a story of "eight dwarves." In
Japan the princess bestows eight treasures, called "eight deities of
Idzushi." <span id="fr_536"></span>[34](#fn_536.md) In Hawaii a sorcerer's
prayer addressed to Kane and other gods begins, "To you who are the
breath of the eighth night." <span id="fr_537"></span>[35](#fn_537.md) A
famous Maui chief is named Child-of-eight-branches (Kama-lala-walu).

Some connect Kama-pua‘a with the god Lono, and Lono names certainly
occur in his story. He wars with Kowea

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (Koea) against Lono-ka-eho in Kahiki. His foster
father's priest Lono-aohi, whose sons are named Black-hog and
Spotted-hog, becomes his ally. Lono-iki-aweawe-aloha is his love-making
god. Signs and prophecies in the clouds are alluded to in his chants. A
name chant runs:

He miki he miki  
A i hanau mai oe, e Hina,  
Ka maka o ka pua‘a,  
E lele ana i ke lani,  
E lele ana i ke kuahiwi,

"Take care, take care,  
When you give birth, Hina,  
The eyes of the hog  
They glance to the heavens,  
And glance to the mountain,  
The son of Hina is a hog with eight eyes,  
By Hina art thou,

This is your name, make answer." <span id="fr_538"></span>[36](#fn_538.md)

 

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

Although tradition sometimes lays the scene of Kamapua‘a's birth in
Kahiki, to which place his father's name Kahiki-ula is said to belong,
and legends of his exploits in the Hawaiian group are told also of
Kahiki, and he is said not to have died in Hawaii but to have retired to
Kahiki and married a chiefess there, nevertheless local legends abound
all over Hawaii which connect his name with various places now held
sacred because of their connection with the hog-child. The valley of
Kaliu-wa‘a (The leaky canoe) which cuts into the Koolau range of Oahu
must be approached with reverence. Leaf offerings are made at the
entrance to the valley; women at their monthly periods must wear a
protection of ti leaves about their necks. Near the head of the valley a
smooth furrow worn by water falling over the cliff is explained as the
groove cut when he made a ladder of his virile member for his followers
to escape their pursuers. A small hollow in a rock near the entrance to
the valley is the place where he hid, and an upright slab on the cliff
above is the transformed body of the man who pointed out his hiding
place to his enemies. <span id="fr_539"></span>[37](#fn_539.md)

Most local stories, however, concern themselves with his amorous
adventures. At Kamoiliili he sees two pretty women and pursues them.
They are goddesses and disappear in the earth. When he digs for them,
two springs of water burst forth known as the "springs of
Kamapua‘a." <span id="fr_540"></span>[38](#fn_540.md)

Other women whom he pursues turn into springs, their male defenders into
stone, and gashes in the earth are made by his snout. At a place near
the coast in Puna called Lua-o-Pele, where the earth is torn up as if
there had been a struggle, he is said to have overtaken the reluctant
Pele and forced the fire goddess to submit to his embraces. They say
that this is why today the sacred lehua trees "grow right down to the
shore at this place alone." Pele's sister Kapo, aware of Pele's peril,
sends her own wandering vagina (kohe-lele) to light upon a tree and
attract Kamapua‘a from her sister. He follows it to Oahu, where its
impression may be seen today on

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

the Makapu‘u side of Koko head where it rested before Kapo withdrew it
and hid it in Kalihi valley. A Maui legend tells how, when Kapo is
living at Wailua-iki with her husband Kuo‘u, Kamapua‘a comes to that
island in his fish form and sees a rainbow resting over Kapo's house.
Her husband is out fishing and she is beating tapa when the handsome
stranger enters. Two men on the cliff signal to her husband and he comes
running and gives Kamapua‘a a whack with his paddle. The kupua sends the
husband flying over the cliff, called to-day Kuo‘u, and he falls in the
shape of a huge stone pointed out today by the roadside. The gap between
Wailua and Wailua-iki through which today runs a steep trail, still
traveled by the mailman to the valley, was torn out at the time of this
struggle. Kapo's house may also be seen and the mark of her vagina
against the cliff. Similar stories of Kamapua‘a's attack upon Pele are
among the popular stories told in this vicinity. In the pursuit
Kamapua‘a loses his hair at a point called Huluhulu-nui (Many bristles),
runs against the cliff at Pua‘aho‘oku‘i, and finally overcomes Pele at
the hill called Kaiwi-o-Pele (The bones of Pele). Such episodes are
related with a keen relish for particular detail and rhythmical
repetition, punning on place names and etiological references playing a
determining part in the story.
