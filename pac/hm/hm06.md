### IV

### THE KANE WORSHIP

KANE was the leading god among the great gods named by the Hawaiians at
the time of the arrival of the missionaries in the islands. He
represented the god of procreation and was worshiped as ancestor of
chiefs and commoners. According to the possibly late edition of the
Kumuhonua legend, he formed the three worlds: the upper heaven of the
gods, the lower heaven above the earth, and the earth itself as a garden
for mankind; the latter he furnished with sea creatures, plants, and
animals, and fashioned man and woman to inhabit it.

An account of the creation of the world which appears in the
genealogical legend of Kumuhonua, the first man fashioned by the gods,
represents Kane as playing a dominant role as creator, but assisted by
Ku and Lono, a trilogy called lahui akua (union of gods) or he papa Kane
(Kane class) said to be worshiped under the name of Ku-kauakahi. <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56) The worship of Tane (Kane), Ro‘o (Lono.md),
and Tu (Ku) by the manahune in Tahiti, to whose mythology belong the
Polynesian figures also of Atea (Wakea), Ti‘i (Ki‘i or Tiki), and Maui,
is closely comparable with the Hawaiian Kane worship. <span
id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57.md)

### LEGEND OF CREATION

(*a*) Fornander version (1). In the first era Kane dwells alone in
continual darkness (i ka po loa); there is neither heaven nor earth. In
the second era light is created and the gods Ku and Lono, with Kane,
fashion the earth and the things on the earth. In the third era they
create man and woman, Kumu-honua (Earth beginning) and Lalo-honua (Earth
below). In the fourth era Kane, who has lived on earth with man, goes up
to

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

heaven to live and the man, having broken Kane's law, is made subject to
death. <span id="fr_58"></span>[3](#fn_58.md)

(*b*) *Fornander version* (2). The three gods Kane, Ku, Lono come out of
the night (po) and create three heavens to dwell in, the uppermost for
Kane, the next below for Ku, and the lowest for Lono, "a heaven for the
parent (makua), a heaven for Ku, a heaven for Lono." Next they make the
earth to rest their feet upon and call it "The great earth of Kane"
(Ka-honua-nui-a-Kane). Kane then makes sun, moon, and stars, and places
them in the empty space between heaven and earth. He makes the ocean
salt, in imitation of which the priests purify with salt water. Next an
image of man is formed out of earth, the head out of white clay brought
from the seas of the north, south, east, and west, the body out of red
earth (apo ula) mixed with spittle (wai nao). The right side of the head
is made of clay brought from the north and east, the left side is made
of clay from the south and west. Man is formed after the image of Kane
with Ku as the workman, Lono as general assistant. Kane and Ku spit (or
breathe) into the nostrils, Lono into the mouth, and the image becomes a
living being. "I have shaped this dirt (lepo); I am going to make it
live," says Kane. "Live! live!" respond Ku and Lono. The man rises and
kneels. They name him Ke-li‘i-ku-honua (The chief Ku(mu)-honua) or
Honua-ula because made out of "red earth." They give him a delightful
garden to live in called Kalana-i-hauola, but later Paliuli, situated in
the land of Kahiki-honua-kele (The land that moved off), and fashion a
wife for him out of his right side and call her Ke-ola-Ku-honua (or
Lalo-hana). "Great Hawaii of the green back and mottled seas" this land
is called. A law is given him but he breaks the law and is then known as
Kane-la‘a-(kah)uli, "a god who fell because of the law." <span
id="fr_59"></span>[4](#fn_59.md)

In the original garden of Kumuhonua and Lalo-hana his wife, are to be
found the pig, dogs of various varieties, mo‘o of many sorts. A tapu
tree, sacred apples which cause death if eaten by strangers, and tapu
bark cloth forbidden to all but the

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

high chiefs are spoken of. Some think that the laau (law or tree) which
caused the expulsion of the pair from the garden refers to these things.
The garden, which is very sacred, goes by a multiplicity of names. It is
the great white albatross of Kane that drove them out of the garden (Ka
Aaia-nukea-nui-a-Kane). Kumuhonua-mokupuni is the land to the eastward
to which Kumuhonua retreats after he has broken the law, and he returns
to Kapakapa-ua-a-Kane and is buried in a place called Kumu-honua-pu‘u,
which was afterwards called Ka-pu‘u-po‘o-kanaka (The hill of human
heads). <span id="fr_60"></span>[5](#fn_60.md)

\(c\) *Kepelino version*. Kane as a triad, Kane, Kana (Ku), Lono, exists
alone in the deep intense night which he has created, and brings about,
first light, then the heavens, then the earth and the ocean, then sun,
moon, and stars. <span id="fr_61"></span>[6](#fn_61.md) Kane existing alone
chants,

"Here am I on the peak of day, on the peak of night.  
The spaces of air,  
The blue sky I will make, a heaven,  
A heaven for Ku, for Lono,  
A heaven for me, for Kane,  
Three heavens, a heaven. Behold the heavens!  
There is the heaven,  
The great heaven,  
Here am I in heaven, the heaven is mine."

\[paragraph continues\] During the first five periods the heavens and
earth are created and the sun, moon, and stars, and plants to clothe the
earth. In the sixth period man is formed.

Kane, Ku, Lono, conceived as a single godhead, mold Kumuhonua, the first
man, out of wet soil and he becomes living soil. They make him a chief
to rule over the whole world and place him with his wife Lalo-honua in
Ka-aina-nui-o-Kane (The great land of Kane), where they live happily
until Lalo-honua meets the "Great seabird with white beak that stands
fishing" (Aaia-nui-nukea-a-ku-lawaia) and is seduced to eat the sacred
apples

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

of Kane. She goes mad and becomes a seabird. The seabird carries them
both away into the jungle, the trees part and make a path for them, but
the trees return to their places and the path is lost, hence the name
"Hidden land of Kane" for this first garden home. . . . Death is the
penalty for Kumuhonua because he did not keep the command of the god. He
gains the name Kane-la‘a-uli and is jeered at by the people as he goes
weeping and lamenting along the highway. For countless years he dwells
as a refugee on the hill called Pu‘u-o-honua, then he returns to
Kahiki-honua-kele and is buried on a mountain called
Wai-hon(u)a-o-Kumuhonua. There his descendants also are buried and the
place is called "The heaping place of bones" (O-ke-ahuna-iwi). <span
id="fr_62"></span>[7](#fn_62.md)

(*d*) *Kamakau version*. Kane, assisted by Ku and Lono and opposed by
Kanaloa, makes the heaven and the earth. All is chaotic. Nothing exists
but the upper regions and the spirit gods. Kane excels among the gods in
wisdom and power. The triad of gods unite in forming the world. They
begin on the twenty-sixth day of the month, the day dedicated to Kane,
and in six days, including the days of Kane, Lono, Mauli, Moku, Hilo,
Hoaka, form the heavens and the earth. The sabbath or holy day of Ku is
established on the seventh day. <span id="fr_63"></span>[8](#fn_63.md)

On Oahu between Kualoa and Kaneohe lies the first land planned by the
gods. On the eastern flank of Mololani (a crater hill on Mokapu), at a
place where fine red earth is mixed with bluish and blackish soil, the
first man is formed by the three gods Kane, Ku, Lono. Kane draws a
likeness of the gods with head, body, hands, and legs like themselves.
Then he makes the image live and it becomes the first man. The gods
place him in a house of kou wood and name him Huli-honua because he is
"made out of earth." The first man notices that his shadow always clings
to him. While he sleeps the god makes a good-looking woman and when he
awakes she lies by his side. He calls her Ke-aka-huli-lani (The shadow
from the heavens). <span id="fr_64"></span>[9](#fn_64.md)

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

(*e*) *Westervelt version*. On the island-like peninsula of Mokapu on
Oahu is the crater hill Mololani. On the east side near the sea red
earth lies beside black soil. Kane makes an image of a man out of earth.
. . . Ku and Lono catch a spirit of the air and give Kane's figure life.
They name him Wela-ahi-lani-nui. The man notices his shadow (aka) and
wonders what it is. The woman is torn out of the man's body by the god
Kane; Ku and Lono heal the body. When the man sees her he names her
Ke-aka-huli-lani after his own shadow. <span
id="fr_65"></span>[10](#fn_65.md)

 

The similarities here to biblical stories have made readers suspicious
of the stories of the forming of man out of earth and of the fall of man
and his being driven out of a sacred garden. It is, however, much more
likely that familiarity with the biblical stories has lent a coloring
and an emphasis to traditions which were genuinely native than that the
Hawaiians have invented these stories in direct imitation of Bible
accounts. In the southern groups, Tane (Kane) makes a woman out of sand.
In Tahiti, although Ta‘aroa (Kanaloa) is the great first mover, Tane is
the god of beauty who adorns the earth and Tu (Ku) is the "builder."

The worship paid to Kane was of a simple character, without human
sacrifice or laborious ritual. "Life is sacred to Kane" (ua kapu ke ola
na Kane), was the saying. Kane worshipers were called he papa la‘a (a
consecrated class) as distinguished from image worshipers. <span
id="fr_66"></span>[11](#fn_66.md) The heiau to Kane at first contained no
images until image worship became popular, when they were introduced
into all heiau. Ellis found the name Kane-nui-akea attached to a stone
image from Kauai brought to the heiau of Kauai-kahaloa at Puapua‘a in
Kona, Hawaii, and with it two wooden gods called Kane-ruru-honua (Kane
shaking the earth) and Rora-maka-ehe (probably Lono with flashing eyes)
and a feather god called Ke-kua-ai-manu (The bird-eating god). <span
id="fr_67"></span>[12](#fn_67.md)

A family altar called Pohaku-o-Kane (Stone of Kane) was set up to Kane
in the shape of a single conical stone from

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

a foot to eight feet in height, plain or with slight carving, and
planted about with ti plant, where members of a family went to pray to
their aumakua and ask forgiveness for the broken tapu to which they
ascribed any trouble that had come upon them. Here they sought
protection from their family god with offerings and prayer. They came
early in the morning, chewed awa while a pig was baking, and, when all
was ready, ate under tapu, leaving no remnants and clearing away all
rubbish. The place for setting up the stone and the offering to be made
were revealed in a dream to the kahuna they consulted. The stone itself
was sprinkled with water or with coconut oil and covered with a piece of
bark cloth during the ceremony. It is possible, since the Kane stone is
generally regarded as an emblem of the male organ of generation, that
this covering is similar to the reported practice, before worshiping an
image in which sex organs were displayed, of covering those parts with
tapa cloth. <span id="fr_68"></span>[13](#fn_68.md)

Each family worshiped Kane under the name of its own family Kane god, or
aumakua, but invoked also all other Kane gods whose aid it desired.
Kamakau lists thirty such aumakua and adds, with his customary love for
exaggeration, "There were thousands and thousands of names to fit the
work done, but all referring to one god. There was one altar and only
one place to offer food, the stone of Kane, and among all inspired by a
Kane god, one keeper should not despise another. They should all eat the
sacrifices and offerings together; the difference lay in the law of each
god and the things dedicated to each." The prayer to the aumakua must
hence be inclusive. It enumerates first the male aumakua, then the
female, and begins, "Stoop down, heaven! listen, earth! hearken, pillars
of earth, aumakua at the rising and the setting of the sun, from that
tapu point to this tapu point! Here is the offering and the sacrifice, a
sacrifice to the god because we are in trouble," and concludes, after
enumerating the gods of the heavens, "To all male aumakua and to all the
chiefly ancestral aumakua, to you I appeal. Brush aside the dark-

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

ness, brush aside death, brush aside trouble. It is I \[name of
suppliant\], chief one of your children in this life. Return, that we
may have mana (sacred power)." The same invocation is repeated to the
female aumakua and their names are listed. <span
id="fr_69"></span>[14](#fn_69.md)

An example of Kane worship in the name of one of these lesser deities is
illustrated in the description given by Kamakau of the place held by
Kane-hekili (Kane in the thunder) as an aumakua on the island of Maui.
Kane-hekili as god of thunder is associated with Kane-wawahi-lani (Kane
breaking through heaven), Ka-uila-nui-maka-keha‘i-i-ka-lani (Lightning
flashing in the heavens), Ka-hoali‘i, and other gods whose names suggest
the lively phenomena of a thunderstorm. Humpbacked forms may be seen
driving through the air at such times, led by Na-kolo-i-lani, or by the
humpbacked brothers of Pele. During such a storm all containers should
be turned bottom side up; all persons should lie face down-ward and make
no outcry. Silence is the law (tapu) of Kane-hekili. Two stones in the
cave of Ke-ana at Kahuku on Oahu are said to be the bodies of two boys
who disobeyed their mother's injunction to keep silence during a
thunderstorm.

Kane-hekili is the god worshiped by those who claim an aumakua in the
thunder. Thunder is the divine form of the god. When he comes to his
worshipers in a dream, he is seen in his human form with his feet
standing on earth and his head touching the clouds, one side of his body
black and the other side white. Such a mark on the body is hence the
sign of one given to Kane-hekili. Anyone born with a birthmark on the
right side is said to be so given. Ulumeheihei, the friend of Kamehameha
and governor of Maui after the setting up of the kingdom, was one who
had this sign. Kahekili, the last ruling chief of Maui, was tattooed on
one side of his body to show that he belonged to the family of the
thunder god. A kahuna named Kahekili who at one time kept the heiau of
Pakana-loa, erected back of Keanae on Maui at a place where violent
thunderstorms occur, came to be regarded as possessed by the spirit of
Kane-hekili. He was feared as a sorcerer,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

but any plot against his life seemed invariably to be checked by a
violent thunderstorm. When he died, his brother-in-law sought his body
inside the heiau and carried away the head to Lanai and worshiped it as
a god. Parts of the body were distributed, and men became known as
worshipers of "eyes of Kahekili" or "mouth of Kahekili." <span
id="fr_70"></span>[15](#fn_70.md)

Chiefs who count their genealogy direct from Kane, whether on the Ulu or
Nanaulu line, rank among the hoali‘i or high tapu chiefs as
distinguished from the lower grades of chiefs with a less distinguished
family genealogy. Descent is therefore of vital importance and the
privileges enjoyed by Kane worshipers are on the basis of such rank,
which gives them command of tapus comparable to those of the gods. They
are in fact gods (akua) in name as in effect, with power over life and
death because of the awful sacredness with which their presence is
regarded. They are "chiefs with the tapus of gods" (na li‘i kapu akua)
as compared with the tapus enjoyed by the lesser chiefs (na li‘i noa).
They are "chiefs of the ikupau" as compared with "chiefs of the ikunu‘u"
who share the right to temporal power alone and the ordinary tapus of
chiefs.

The name of Ka-hoali‘i is given to "a mythical ancestor worshiped as a
god," deity of the walled heiau at Kawaipapa, Papa‘a, Kauai, and said to
be the possessor of the two famous axes of old times from the gods
Haumapu and Olopu with which he "cut asunder the government \[aupuni\]
so that it fell." It was with these axes that the kahuna must touch the
ohia tree selected for the building of a luakini heiau before the tree
was felled and brought down from the forest. <span
id="fr_71"></span>[16](#fn_71.md) On various ceremonial occasions the god
was impersonated as a dark man, completely naked, with stripes or
patches of white on the inner sides of his thighs. At the Makahiki
festival he occupied a booth of lama wood during the period of the
freeing of the various food tapus, and at the close of the period, when
the aku fish were freed, the eyeball of a fish and that of a human
victim were given him to swallow. At the building of

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

a luakini heiau he was again impersonated by a naked man who led the
running. At the dedication ceremony of a heiau for the circumcision of a
young chief, a night was given up to this god during which none dared
come outside lest he die. The priests passed about praying the people to
come out and the official who sought human sacrifices, called the Mu,
tried to entice out the unwary in order to secure a victim. <span
id="fr_72"></span>[17](#fn_72.md)

The law (tapu) of this god was called Pu‘u-koa-maka-ia (Hard eyeball of
a fish) with reference to the human eyeball which was the offering he
demanded. Kamakau asserts that a chief possessed by the spirit of
Ka-hoali‘i might invoke this law at any time when the followers of the
chief were assembled. All must then look steadfastly at the chief thus
possessed and anyone might be selected as victim and his eyes gouged out
and swallowed in a cup of awa. <span id="fr_73"></span>[18](#fn_73.md)
Maui, when he recovers his wife from Bat, has to be appeased with the
eyes of the abductor offered to him in a cup of awa before his injured
feelings are pacified. <span id="fr_74"></span>[19](#fn_74.md) Ku‘i-a-lua,
god of the art of bone breaking (lua), demands of his pupils that they
eat an eye-ball of a victim after finishing their course of training.

The drinking of a victim's eye with the kava as an offering to deity is
reported from other groups. In Tahiti, when human victims were
sacrificed, says Ellis, the eye was given to the king. <span
id="fr_75"></span>[20](#fn_75.md) In the Marquesas, the spirit of the
brother-in-law of Tiki is caught up to the sky and sacrificed and the
eyes are consumed with the kava. <span id="fr_76"></span>[21](#fn_76.md) In
New Zealand eyes are scooped out and swallowed in order to obtain the
spirit of the owner, says Taylor. <span id="fr_77"></span>[22](#fn_77.md)

In myth Ka-hoa-li‘i or an equivalent is represented as a god of the
underworld, who occupied "the subterranean region through which the sun
passes each night from west to east." In the legend of Kana, Ka-hoa-lei
(or li‘i), vexed by Niheu, withholds the sun and leaves the people in
darkness until Kana visits the land to the far east, blackens his hands
to resemble those of the god, and gets handed up to him the

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

sun, the stars, and the cock that signals the dawn. <span
id="fr_78"></span>[23](#fn_78.md) So in the legend of Aukele, that hero
secures the water of life in the same manner from the servants of the
underworld deity Ka-moho-ali‘i at the pit of the far eastern edge of the
world where the sun comes up. <span id="fr_79"></span>[24](#fn_79.md) Kane
himself is said to have come to Hawaii from the east, and old Hawaiians
make the front door face the east as a sign of Kane worship and turn
toward the sun when they offer their morning prayer. <span
id="fr_80"></span>[25](#fn_80.md)

Chanted prayers to the gods were an important part, perhaps the
important part, of temple worship. The most sacred of these were uttered
by the high priest and for this ritual a scaffolding was erected within
the temple area called the Lananu‘umamao because built in three stages,
called nu‘u (earth), lani (heavens), and mamao (far off but not beyond
hearing). This last and most sacred stage was entered by the high priest
and ruling chief alone. The whole structure was covered with white bark
cloth (oloa). On the floor of the temple platform surrounding the
structure stood the images, the chief image directly in front of the
staging. On each side of the tower were sometimes placed arches of bent
saplings, three on a side, and these were supposed to bend if the
offering (or prayer) was acceptable. This oracular response of the gods
may be compared with the drum placed over a high chief's threshold,
whose sounding or silence indicated the rank of the one entering, or the
cord similarly hung across the en-trance which fell to the ground of
itself before a high chief, but under which one of lower rank must
stoop.

Prayers were offered at each step of the scaffolding. Some were offered
at the altar before ascending the tower. A series of prayers used in the
Kane worship and recited by an old Hawaiian from Kauai named Robert
Luahiwa to Mr. Theodore Kelsey are here given as translated by Miss
Laura Green in order to show the highly exalted religious feeling with
which the high gods were approached by the priest who uttered

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

the prayer, the audience meanwhile sitting motionless in perfect
stillness until, at the word noa, the tapu was "freed" and they might
resume their customary liberty of movement. The word amama with which
the prayer concludes is pre-Christian and not connected with the
Christian amen.

The first prayer is little more than an enumeration of the names of Kane
as the subordinate forms by which the one god who embraces them all is
worshiped. It is the prayer "given by Kane when he began to offer prayer
in the heiau of Kuikahi, at Hanapepe, Kauai, near the stream of
Manawai-o-puna" and "is calling on the lesser Kanes to do their duty and
aid him."

The second prayer is one offered by Kane to the assembly (papa) of gods
from the steps of the oracle. It is significant that the female gods of
growth, Laka and Hi‘iaka, are invoked with Kane, and that the plants
used for temple decoration are included among the names of Kane: the
fragrant myrtle (maile), the ieie vine or climbing pandanus, the sacred
lehua and dracaena trees out of which images were carved. Pele, Kapo,
and the male and female Ku gods are also invoked. The enchanted stone
Kapolei, formerly belonging to Kauai, is mentioned.

The third prayer is offered at the altar. Lono of the heavens, Hi‘iaka,
and Laka are invoked with "red Kane." At the fourth prayer the priest is
within the "six" arches and upon the steps of the scaffold. Here the
reciter breaks off. The most sacred prayers, those uttered from the
prayer tower, are not reported.

The same reciter gives a fifth prayer offered when gathering plants in
the mountains for temple decoration. The guardian spirits are invoked to
return and possess the plants. "Produce sacredness, produce freedom,
freedom for me, a man," prays the gatherer, and then begins to pluck the
leaves with prayer. The address to Kane-i-ka-pahu‘a (Kane the thruster)
is said to be to Kane in the guise of an owl, who thrusts with wings and
talons at the enemies of his worshipers in time of battle and turns
aside their weapons. The word may also mean "dancer." Kane-i-ka-pahu-wai
is "Kane with a calabash of water" which he pours out upon the earth
below.
