### XXXIV

### THE STRETCHING-TREE KUPUA

POLYNESIAN type tale tells of a high chief who weds away from home and
departs, leaving tokens with the mother for the child about to be born
by which the child's paternity may be recognized. The story falls into
an established pattern, but subject to infinite episodic elaborations
and varying from romantic to realistic in treatment of details. In
Hawaii a favorite carrier for the firstborn when he goes in search of
his father is a stretching tree, sometimes spoken of as an "ancestor,"
who can take either tree or eel form, and this tree kupua in some cases
goes by the name of Niu-ola-hiki or Niu-loa-hiki, variously translated
Life-giving (ola) or Long or High (loa) coconut (niu) of Kahiki (hiki),
the last word, hiki, being also sometimes explained as "traveling" and
the whole name being interpreted as Long-traveling-coconut.

The tree as a pathway to another world occurs in Rice's version of the
Kaanaelike romance; <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1](#fn_1154.md) in the
Hi‘iaka story, where one of Pele's brothers makes a canoe of his body in
order to carry Lohiau back to Kauai after he has been for the second
time brought back to life; <span id="fr_1155"></span>[2](#fn_1155.md) in
the story of Maui's uncle Nu-lo-hiki, who turns himself into a canoe to
bring Hina to her lover at Wailua on Kauai and then into a coconut tree
up which Maui climbs to visit Makali‘i in the heavens; <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[3](#fn_1156.md) in the romance of Hainakolo, where
Niu-loa-hiki is an ancestor god of Keaunini who, in the shape of a tall
coconut tree, shakes down a leaf sheath to form a boat for the youth's
journey in search of his father <span id="fr_1157"></span>[4](#fn_1157.md)
and in the form of an eel ac-companies him on his wedding journey. <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[5](#fn_1158.md) In the story of Niauepo‘o, who goes to
seek his father overseas, an ancestor named Niu-ola-hiki in the form of
a stretching tree serves as

<span id="page_479">p. 479</span>

carrier of the child. Closely related are the stories of Kalanimanuia
and of Namakaokapao‘o.

### STORY OF NIAUEPO‘O

Ku-alakai from Kahiki-nui-alealea meets Hina at Maniania in Ka-u
district on Hawaii and leaves her with child. He gives her a feather
cape and helmet, his loincloth and red canoe, and bids her send their
child to seek him. The son Niauepo‘o asks after his father and desires
to visit him, but refuses the sea road. Hina's grandparents give him a
bow and an arrow whose flight he is to follow and invoke their ancestor
Niu-ola-hiki to bear their child overseas in the form of a lengthening
coconut tree. The boy clings to the tip, the mother utters a chant, and
the god drops the boy down in Kahiki-nui-alealea. Here he finds the
children playing games, competes, wins, and gains a boy companion named
Uhu-ula (Red uhu fish). The arrow sent ahead to guide the way falls
inside the house of the chief's grand-daughter and when the boys follow
the arrow she takes Niauepo‘o for her husband. The boys are discovered
and killed and their bodies thrown into the sea, but the ancestor
restores their spirits to life, Uhuula in the form of the red uhu fish
and Niauepo‘o in his own form. Each night the boy comes out of the sea
and uses the stone walk, bathing pool, loincloth, water gourd, drum, and
sleeping mats prepared for the reception of the chief's son. The guards
report to the chief, a watch is set, nets arranged to trap him, and as
soon as he has eaten food he becomes a human being again and is joyfully
received by his father. Hina, however, enraged by his former treatment,
comes from overseas to avenge him and turns her husband into an alakai
fish. The daughter she bears after her return is named Maniania
(trembling), from the cold and fear experienced by her son while being
carried overseas, and the name is today attached to the place on Ka-u
where she lived. <span id="fr_1159"></span>[6](#fn_1159.md)

### ROMANCE OF KALANIMANUIA

Ku, ruling chief of Lihue on Oahu, surprises the beautiful Kaunoa at her
bathing pool and leaves her with his spear and

<span id="page_480">p. 480</span>

loincloth as tokens for their child, whom he directs to be named, if a
boy, Kalanimanuia. The boy is brought up at Kukaniloko in ignorance of
his birth until his supposed father scolds him for giving away food too
lavishly, when the mother sends him to Ku with the tokens. Ku does not
recognize the child and orders him to be thrown into the sea off Kualoa
point. Night after night his spirit comes to the heiau, chants a song,
and leaves at cockcrow. The heiau kahunas worship the spirit until it
gains strength to take on human form. Ku recognizes his son and nets are
placed about the heiau to snare the spirit, which is then worked over
until it takes first the body of a rat and then becomes almost human in
form.

The rat-like boy woos his sister Ihiawaawa, and jeers at her three
suitors Hala, Kumunuiaiake, and Aholenuimakaukai as unworthy of her, but
she will have nothing to do with him because he looks like a rat. The
lovers determine upon a test of beauty, the falling of a suspended cord
to determine the winner. The night before the contest Kalanimanuia hears
repeated knockings at his door and there enter the soles of his feet
(puakuakua), then the knees (moi), the thighs (lolelua), the hair
(limuhuna), the eyes (hohoea). The next morning he appears at the
contest as a splendid youth. Wind, rain, thunder and lightning hail his
coming and the cord tumbles of itself in sign of a high ranking
chief. <span id="fr_1160"></span>[7](#fn_1160.md)

### STORY OF NAMAKAOKAPAO'O

Ku-ula-o-kaha‘i (Standing breadfruit of Kaha‘i) from Kahiki-papaialewa,
a land in the clouds, comes to Oahu and meets Pokai at Hoaeae. On his
return to Kahiki he leaves a garment, a girdle, and a feather cloak as
tokens of their child's parent-hood. Na-maka-o-ka-pao‘o (The eyes of the
pao‘o fish) is born. While a mere baby he pulls up all the potato vines
which his supposed father Puali‘i has planted. When his father attempts
to kill him with an axe, the instrument slips, as the child pronounces a
chant, and cuts off Puali‘i's own head and the child picks it up and
hurls it a distance of five miles. Amau, ruling chief of Oahu, sends men
to kill the child, but all are slain and

<span id="page_481">p. 481</span>

finally the chief himself, and the son sets up his mother as ruler over
Oahu. He leaves the tokens from his father in a gourd at the foot of the
Kaha‘i breadfruit which is his father's impersonation on Oahu and
travels to Hawaii, where he makes friends with some boys with whom he
has wagered in a contest with arrows and is adopted as a friend by
Namaka-o-ka-i‘a, whose father Namaka-o-ka-lani is defending Kona
district against Ku, ruling chief of Puna and Ka-u districts. Having
established his friend's father, he sails to visit his own father
(incomplete). <span id="fr_1161"></span>[8](#fn_1161.md)

Parallel forms of the same general pattern occur in southern Polynesian
groups.

*Maori*. (*a*) Tu-huruhuru is son of Tini-rau and Hina. Hina flees with
her brother Rupe when the child is born, but leaves the child in answer
to her husband's supplication. The boys, jealous because he excels in
hurling the throwing stick, taunt him as a bastard and the child goes
disguised as a slave to his mother's settlement. Obeying his father's
instructions, when ordered to bring Rupe water to drink he pours it on
his uncle's nose and when his mother dances he sings a charm which
loosens her girdle. Both beat him; he escapes and tries to drown himself
but is recognized in time, and his mother and her brother return to
Tini-rau for the baptism ceremony. <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[9](#fn_1162.md)

(*b*) Tuahuriri is deserted by his mother's husband, son of the great
chief Kahukura-te-paku, because she has had an affair with another man
and he feels himself insulted. The mother of a boy whom the child has
struck calls him a bastard and he in-quires for his father and goes to
seek him at his home in Waimea. His party is about to be killed and
eaten as strangers when he alludes to "the red battens of my grandfather
Kahukura-te-paku's house" and repeats the name given to him by his
father. Honorable recognition follows, but he still cherishes a grudge
and on another visit is believed to have left a deadly plant which takes
off many of his father's people. <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[10](#fn_1163.md)

(*c*) Tautini-awhitia is born after his father has gone to live at
another place. He excels in sport, and the boys taunt him as

<span id="page_482">p. 482</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "fatherless!" He goes to seek his father in a
canoe made of the rewarewa pod and his mother chants a charm for his
safety on the sea. He arrives safely at his father's home and is adopted
as a slave by a little son of his father and sent to live in the bush.
Two pet birds of the same kind as those which his father had brought to
relieve his mother's pregnancy craving before he was born are taught to
speak and reveal his identity, and he is gladly received with
honor. <span id="fr_1164"></span>[11](#fn_1164.md)

(*d*) Wharematangi is son of Ngarue by Uru-te-kakara. Ngarue leaves his
wife because her relatives call him lazy, but gives her a name for the
child, a dart, and a chant to guide him to his father's house. He excels
in dart throwing but is jeered at by his playmates because his father's
family has not avenged an insult from another tribe, and goes to seek
his father. The dart leads the way, protected by the chant, and he is
recognized by its shape and received gladly. An expedition of vengeance
is speedily planned. <span id="fr_1165"></span>[12](#fn_1165.md)

 

*Marquesas*. Kae's son Te-hina-tu-o-Kae (Hina-tuu-o-Kae), child of
Hina-i-Vaino‘i (Vainoki), is mocked by the boys because he has no
father. Hina sends him on her fish brother to the place where Kae lives.
The boy bathes in the basin which Kae has prepared for his son; he tears
up the bananas and sugar cane. The people, angry, take him to the old
tuhuna and he is put in a hole to be strangled the next day. The lad
chants his name. Kae comes, recognizes him, and puts him upon his head,
thus consecrating the child, <span id="fr_1166"></span>[13](#fn_1166.md) or
recognizes him only after having him first thrown into an oven. <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[14](#fn_1167.md)

 

*Tonga*. Tongaloa Eitumatupua descends from the sky by a casuarina tree
and takes to wife a woman of earth. A boy is born and called Ahoeitu.
Tongaloa gives the woman a mountain of earth and a yam for the child's
garden. The boy asks for his father. The mother sends him to the sky by
way of the tree. She anoints him with coconut oil and gives him a
loincloth. The father is catching pigeons. He takes the boy home and
gives him

<span id="page_483">p. 483</span>

kava and food and sends him to play at throwing-stick with his sky
brothers. They kill him and eat him but throw away his bones and head.
These are gathered up, the brothers are given an emetic, and with Malay
apple leaves as covering he is brought to life. The brothers now love
him and follow him back to earth, where he displaces the old Tuitonga
and rules as far as Uea. <span id="fr_1168"></span>[15](#fn_1168.md)

 

*Lau Islands*: *Legend of Va*. A woman is swallowed by a shark, escapes,
and marries the lord of Notho in a strange land. Her son Vu never grows
up but is stronger than other children. When they revile him because of
his stranger mother he sails away alone to seek his mother's
country. <span id="fr_1169"></span>[16](#fn_1169.md)

 

Each of the tales contains special incidents, emphasis upon which
suggests the source from which the story is drawn. The tapu bathing
basin and other preparations made to receive the expected visitor in the
first two stories certainly belong to the Marquesas, where it is
customary to prepare such a bathing basin, plant fruit and paper
mulberry trees, and raise pigs in anticipation of a firstborn
child, <span id="fr_1170"></span>[17](#fn_1170.md) and where the account of
the arrival of Kae's child born to Vaino‘i in the island of women almost
exactly duplicates the episode in this Hawaiian story. The name
Niauepo‘o is a class title in Hawaii for chiefs of the highest rank,
born from the marriage of close relatives among high chiefs. The
singular episode of the restoration of the different parts of
Kalanimanuia's body has a parallel also in a Marquesan story where Ono
is killed and torn in pieces, but the twelve sisters save his "head" and
each bears a child in the form of one of the missing members. <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[18](#fn_1171.md) It is a variant of the theme of the
ugly man grown handsome (by bathing, cutting up and making over by the
gods, and so forth) and in this form is well known in Polynesian as in
oriental and African story. For the slipping knife compare a Tonga
version of Hina's flight from Sinilau, in which the parents do not
recognize the children and attempt to kill

<span id="page_484">p. 484</span>

them, but by pronouncing the family names they cause the knife to
slip. <span id="fr_1172"></span>[19](#fn_1172.md)

The test of beauty in the Kalanimanuia story agrees with the Hawaiian
custom of stretching a sacred cord (aha) which is supposed to fall of
itself before a ranking chief, and the incident is therefore probably
native to Hawaii. A story illustrating this custom is recited by people
of Hilo to this day, as follows:

### LEGEND OF LONOMAAIKANAKA

At the time when Lono-ma-ai-kanaka was living back of Hilo with some of
his chiefs, one of the chiefesses wandered into the back country and
lived with the commoners on popolo berries and wild ferns. After a time
she longed for fish and proposed an expedition to the coast. At
Ka-nuku-o-ka-manu (Beak of the bird) they approached Lono's encampment.
Her friends were about to retire, but the chiefess ran forward, the
cords fell before her, and she went and lay upon the chests of the
chiefs and embraced their heads. Thus for the first time her friends of
the back country knew that she was a chiefess of high rank, and they
feared for their lives; but she dismissed them with honor. <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[20](#fn_1173.md)

The stretching-tree kupua, called Niu-ola-hiki or Niu-loa-hiki in
Hawaiian story, occurs in the Marquesas, Rarotonga, and the Tuamotus,
generally as an intermediary between earth and heaven, man and the gods,
a child and his divine ancestors, youth and manhood; or, in one case, as
a symbolic connection between this world and that of the dead. In
romance a chief goes by this path to woo a divine chiefess; the canoe in
which a hero sails upon adventure is called by this name.

In the Marquesas, Tanaoa outsails his brothers in a canoe made out of a
coconut sheath and named Niu-oa-fiti, here translated "Distant coconut
at Fiji." <span id="fr_1174"></span>[21](#fn_1174.md) Koomahu climbs up

<span id="page_485">p. 485</span>

to heaven after his sister and, finding her waiting upon old blind Tapa
for whom she is roasting bananas, he restores the blind woman's eyes
with coconut water from the Niu-oa-i-Fiti, translated "Long coconut palm
in Fiji." <span id="fr_1175"></span>[22](#fn_1175.md) In the rite to
consecrate a new-born child, two mythical "coconuts" are referred to,
called niu-oa-i-fiti and niu-oa-ani, one for furnishing food for the
child, the other for the navel cord, but whether invoked as gods is not
made clear. <span id="fr_1176"></span>[23](#fn_1176.md) In Rarotonga, to
say that one "climbs the coconut tree Nu-roa-ki-iti" is equivalent to
saying that one commits suicide. <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[24](#fn_1177.md) Ta‘aki goes to seek his father by the
road between heaven and earth called Nu-roa-ki-iti. <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[25](#fn_1178.md) In the Tuamotus, in Fagatau, Tahaki
climbs Niu-roa-i-Hiti and finds himself precipitated into Hina's bathing
pool. <span id="fr_1179"></span>[26](#fn_1179.md) An Anaa chant quoted by
Stimson says, "The ship of Maui is the shell of the
High-coconut-of-Havaiki." The tree Niu-roa-i-Havaiki grows from the head
of Tuna-te-vai-ora, the demigod whose wife Hina-tuatu-a-akakai comes to
Havaiki after a husband and becomes Mauitikitiki's wife. <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[27](#fn_1180.md) In the Chant of Rua, a canoe called
Niu-roa-i-hiti is constructed in Nuku-tavake to sail to Vahitahi, which
was the original home of the Nuku-tavake people. The story proceeds:

The chief as high priest performs ceremonies proper for the occasion and
despatches heralds to call the people together to the court before the
House-of-learning. During the ceremony he becomes possessed by the god,
who reveals that the demon god Rua-tuputupua has taken possession of the
ship. Chants are uttered to free the ship from the power of the demon,
invoking Tane, Tagaroa, Tu. Te-tahi the captain chants songs. He sends
one herald aloft to watch for land birds, then another, who sees birds
riding the waves. The land of Vahitahi, lying twenty miles distant from
Nuku-tavake, is now in sight. The seer at Vahitahi foresees the ship's
arrival and knows that it is possessed by a demon. Every effort is now
made to exorcise the

<span id="page_486">p. 486</span>

demon. The ship is hauled upon the reef with erotic songs in-tended to
arouse the men to their highest pitch of energy. The songs describe the
safe passage of the reef, the bringing of the ship to shore, its lodging
there, and precautions to prevent the demon from escaping on land. All
proceed in file to the temple. The demon is exorcised into a pool of
fresh water and the ship cleansed with smoke from its influence. <span
id="fr_1181"></span>[28](#fn_1181.md)

Besides these allusions to a stretching tree or a swift canoe with a
name obviously a variant of that of the Hawaiian kupua, there are a
number of legends told in the South Seas where a lengthening unnamed
tree serves as roadway between earth and heaven. In Mangaia, Tane climbs
a tree beset by insects whose top seems to reach the sky, from which he
shakes down nuts upon his own homeland. <span
id="fr_1182"></span>[29](#fn_1182.md) A ladder-like tree beset by insects
is alluded to in the Samoan Ahoeitu story. <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[30](#fn_1183.md) In one Samoan story a lad goes up to
the moon on a tree; <span id="fr_1184"></span>[31](#fn_1184.md) in another
a boy sent to climb a tree at an ogre's house finds that it stretches
upward when he attempts to pick a nut. <span
id="fr_1185"></span>[32](#fn_1185.md) In Tonga, a child born with strength
in his hands goes up to visit his father in the sky on a casuarina tree
that grows up from his own staff. <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[33](#fn_1186.md) In the Banks islands a lengthening
Casuarina tree saves Qat and his brothers from Qasavara. <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[34](#fn_1187.md) In Dobu a scabby-skinned man,
deserted by his fellows, travels to the sky on a lengthening casuarina
tree. <span id="fr_1188"></span>[35](#fn_1188.md) In San Cristoval,
brothers cause a betel tree to stretch in order to rid them-selves of a
younger brother, and it lengthens to the skies and bends over to the
boy's home. <span id="fr_1189"></span>[36](#fn_1189.md) A lengthening areca
tree which a man climbs after nuts for his brother carries a man to the
country of the skies. <span id="fr_1190"></span>[37](#fn_1190.md) In a tale
from North Borneo, a man escapes to the sky by a lengthening tree which
pigs, woodpeckers, and porcupines are attempting to fell. <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[38](#fn_1191.md) In

<span id="page_487">p. 487</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Whitsuntide island of the New Hebrides, Tagaro
comes to earth and begets a son who follows him to the skies on an arrow
which turns into an aerial tree root. <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[39](#fn_1192.md) Again, a grandmother sends a child up
a tree after fruit and when he gives her none she causes the tree to
lengthen. <span id="fr_1193"></span>[40](#fn_1193.md) In the Lau islands
the daughter of Turi climbed a tree and "flew like a bird right up to
heaven and married the god Mbengga." <span
id="fr_1194"></span>[41](#fn_1194.md)

In Hawaii, according to information given by a worshiper of
Kane-huna-moku, the kupua Niu-ola-hiki in his tree form is the path that
leads to the land of the gods, a land of "sacred coconuts," where Kane,
Lono, and Kanaloa first made man. Here the "coconuts" are phallic
symbols. The chant addressed to Ku and Hina by herb pickers is identical
with that by which the mother of Niauepo‘o summons the boy's ancestor to
bear him safely to the far land of his father:

O Life-giving coconut!  
Budded in Kahiki, Rooted in Kahiki,  
Forming a trunk in Kahiki,  
Bearing leaves in Kahiki,  
Bearing fruit in Kahiki,  
Ripened in Kahiki!

\[paragraph continues\] The myth of the "life-giving," or
"far-traveling" coconut palm of Kahiki or Avaiki may be regarded as the
symbolic expression throughout Polynesia of the blood tie which connects
a migrating people to their original ancestral line. It is a claim upon
paternal recognition. It is a living impersonation of the family line
which carries the genealogy of the newborn child back over whatever
distance of time or space to his ultimate ancestry and to all the honors
and dignities which such ancestry implies. It is the claim made by a
migrating people for recognition by others of their line of their divine
patrimony. It probably has phallic meaning in connection with the sexual
life of the child who becomes himself

<span id="page_488">p. 488</span>

an element in the preservation of the family line. The Tuamotu
references strongly suggest ritual symbolism. So also the eel form in
Hawaii, employed, like the coconut palm and the canoe, as a phallic
symbol.
