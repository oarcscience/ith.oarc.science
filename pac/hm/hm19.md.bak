### AIKANAKA-KAHA‘I CYCLE

THE Ulu genealogy used by the chiefs of Maui and Hawaii includes, as the
twenty-eighth to the thirty-second in descent from Wakea, the names of
five chiefs famous also in the genealogies and tradition of the South
Seas. These five are Ai-kanaka (Kai-tangata), Hema, Kaha‘i (Tawhaki),
Wahieloa, Laka. A comparison with southern groups shows a close likeness
in the series, although the names of their wives differ widely.

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

<span id="img_24000"></span> ![](img/24000.jpg)

The district of Hana in East Maui is the center of localization in
Hawaii for the lives of the Aikanaka-Laka family, and traditional chants
are preserved which tell precisely where each of the five was born,
where the afterbirth, umbilical cord, and navel string of each were
buried, the place where each was reared, the site of his house, the
place of his death and burial, and sometimes other data, together with
lists of

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

place names of which it is doubtful whether they name places where the
body rested on the way to burial or have some other significance,
factual or spiritual. The circumstantial nature of these chants might
argue for the actual existence of such chiefs on Hawaiian soil, but
Kamakau, who records the chants in his *Moolelo Hawaii* (1869), tells
how, in the time of Kuali‘i of Oahu and later in that of Kamehameha-nui
of Maui, the genealogists got together and established the genealogical
lines back to Puna and Hema, sons of Aikanaka, from whom Hawaiian chief
families count their ancestry; Oahu and Kauai families from Puna, Maui
and Hawaii from Hema, traditional settler in New Zealand with the
Menehune. At that time the genealogical chant for each chief was
probably harmonized with local tradition and crystallized into its
present form. The legends have passed into nursery tales and lost the
grim character preserved to them in less sophisticated groups, but as a
whole they follow closely the pattern common to the whole area where
these names appear.

The cycle tells of a woman from a cannibal group who weds a chief in
another land and, becoming dissatisfied, returns home, leaving two
children, Puna (Punga) and Hema. Hema wins a goddess as a wife, and when
his child is to be born he goes away to seek a birth gift and is taken
prisoner. His eyes are plucked out and he himself is thrust into the
filth pit. His son Kaha‘i (Tawhaki) goes to rescue him and to avenge his
wrongs, accompanied by his brother Alihi (Karihi, Kari‘i), who does not
share his godlike nature and is hence unable to endure the difficulties
of the journey. He is guided by an old blind ancestress who is
discovered roasting food and whose eyesight is restored in return for
the information sought. Kaha‘i's son Wahieloa is also taken captive, and
his son Laka goes to seek his bones, carried across seas in a double
canoe fashioned for him by the canoe-building gods and the little
spirits of the forest who are his family deities.

### AIKANAKA LEGEND

(*a*) *Thrum version*. Ai-kanaka (Man-eater) is a Maui chief, son of
Heleipawa, son of Kapawa. He is born at Kowali-Muo-lea,

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

at a place called Ho‘olono-ki‘u in Hana district and reared at
Makali‘i-hanau, and his home is on Kauiki hill. He is a good industrious
man and a kind ruler. Hina-hana-ia-(i)-ka-malama (Hina who worked in the
moon), or Hina-mai-ka-lani ( Hina from the heavens), comes from
Ulupaupau in Kahiki to be his wife and to them are born, first, imbecile
children, then Puna-i-mua (Puna the firstborn), and last Hema. Hina's
servants are Kaniamoko and Kahapouli. After the birth of Puna, Hina
begins to enlarge her landholdings. The children's excrement has to be
carried to the north side of the water hole at Ulaino and Hina wearies
of their constant messing and the tapu involved in the disposition of
the excrement. Hence on the night of Hoku (Full moon) she leaps to the
moon from a place called Wanaikulani. Her husband leaps to catch her,
the leg breaks off in his hand (hence she is called Lono-muku), and
there she hangs in the moon to this day. <span
id="fr_587"></span>[1](#fn_587.md)

 

(*b*) *Kamakau version*. Aikanaka, son of Kailoau, son of Heleipawa, is
born in Kipahulu, Hana district, on East Maui. The place of his birth
and the site of his house on the hill Kuekahi can still be seen. Strange
stories are told of his wife Hina-hanaia-ka-malama or Hina-ai-ka-malama
(Hina fed on the moon). She is said to have found food from the moon in
the shape of the sweet potato called hualani. Her husband cut off her
foot and threw it to the moon where she lived. <span
id="fr_588"></span>[2](#fn_588.md)

 

According to Malo, <span id="fr_589"></span>[3](#fn_589.md) Aikanaka died
at Aneuli, Pu‘uolai, in Honuaula, Maui, and was buried in Iao valley. An
early school record makes Hana-ua-lani-ha‘aha‘a the place of Hina's
ascent and adds, "If her husband had not cut off her legs she would have
reached the locality of the sun." <span id="fr_590"></span>[4](#fn_590.md)
The *Moolelo Hawaii* (1838) reads: "Because the children made so much
excrement she fled away and lived in the moon. As she flew up, her
husband cut off her foot, hence she was called Lonomuku. What a grand
lie!" <span id="fr_591"></span>[5](#fn_591.md) Nursery tales today center
upon

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

the weariness caused by the constant running to and fro from Kauiki to
Ulaino, a distance of a mile or so, to deposit the children's messes, a
situation made amusing by the dramatic way in which the story is told.
The theme occurs in traditional Polynesian variants; in Maori it
connects with the use of a latrine. A local version collected in Hana in
1932 makes the husband the one who wearies of cleaning the children or
does not like being given the child to clean.

He takes large gourds \[for which the neighboring district of Hamoa is
famous\], one under each arm, and leaping from the hill Ka-iwi-o-Pele
\[where the site of the house can be seen today\] floats away to the
moon.

\[paragraph continues\] A similar story is told in Mangaia of the god
Tane.

Tane comes from Avaiki and marries a sister of Ina-of-the-moon. She
becomes jealous and he weaves himself baskets out of coconut fronds and,
using them for wings, flies away to his own land. <span
id="fr_592"></span>[6](#fn_592.md)

\[paragraph continues\] In Rarotonga:

Ngata wins Ngaro-ariki-te-tara, the beautiful daughter of Kuiono, and
after recovering her from Avaiki and again from the land Ka-opu-te-ra
(of sunset) he abandons her forever because she has left their child
with him to tend while she pays a visit to Variiri and the child is
fretful. <span id="fr_593"></span>[7](#fn_593.md)

\[paragraph continues\] In New Zealand:

Hapai-nui-a-maunga (Great lifter of mountains) comes from heaven to wed
Tawhaki. A child is born. He complains of its filth. She takes the
child, steps off the roof gable and goes back to heaven. <span
id="fr_594"></span>[8](#fn_594.md)

 

*Maori*. Whaitiri (or Awa-nui-a-rangi) of the heavens is a man-eater.
She hears of Kai-tangata on earth and, taking literally a name perhaps
signifying victory over enemies, comes

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

to earth and makes him her husband. When she finds he is not really a
man-eater she is disappointed. She bears him children, Punga and Hema
(and others). He complains of their filth (or discusses her with others)
and she returns to the heavens (having first made a filth pit for the
children). Her husband tries to catch her by her garment in some
versions. <span id="fr_595"></span>[9](#fn_595.md)

 

*Tahiti*. Nona (or Haumea), a cannibal woman of high rank, lives at
Mahina (Moon) in North Tahiti. Her husband, a chief of high rank of the
house Tahiti-to‘erau abandons her. Her daughter Hina hides her lover in
a cave which is opened by a spell. The mother listens to the spell,
finds and devours him. The girl flees and is protected by a hairy chief
named No‘a (Noahuruhuru) who kills the cannibal mother-in-law, Nona, and
marries the girl. Pu‘a-ari‘i-tahi and Hema are their children. <span
id="fr_596"></span>[10](#fn_596.md)

 

*Tuamotu* (*Anaa*). Nona is the daughter of Te-ra-hei-manu and the girl
Hei-te-rara who is daughter of the ogress Ragi-titi. She desires
Noa-makai-tagata and they sleep together. Noa insults Nona by
complaining about her bad odor and she leaves him for another lover. Noa
follows her, kills the new lover, and brings back Nona to his own
land. <span id="fr_597"></span>[11](#fn_597.md)

 

*Rarotonga*. Te-meru-rangi is the father, Ina-ma-ngurunguru the mother
of Ema, father of Taaki and Karii. Te-meru is also known as Kai-tangata
and Tui-kai-vaevae-roroa. <span id="fr_598"></span>[12](#fn_598.md)

 

The Tuamotu version is related to the story told (at Ra‘iatea) in the
Tahitian group of Hiro and his beautiful wife Vai-tu-marie, parents of
Marama (Moonlight). Hiro overhears his wife laughing with a neighbor
about her husband's strong odor, and puts her to death. Her son Marama
discovers and grieves over her death, but nothing comes of the
incident. <span id="fr_599"></span>[13](#fn_599.md)

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

### HEMA LEGEND

Puna is brought up on Oahu, Hema on Maui at Kauiki, called
Hawaii-kua-uli (Hawaii of the green back). Hema grows to be a handsome
man and takes Lua(Ulu, Ula)-mahehoa from the upper Iao valley in Wailuku
as his wife. In the fifth month of her pregnancy he sails after the
birth gift called Apo-ula (Red feather band) to the land of the child's
maternal grandparents. They are deep-sea divers and "it is a custom in
that country to take men's eyes for fishbait." Hema's eyes are gouged
out and he loses his wits ("caught by the aaia bird of Kane"). The last
part of his chant reads, in Emerson's translation:

"Hema sailed for Kahiki  
Seeking the birth gift (Apoula)  
Caught was Hema seized by the Aaia,  
He fell at Kahiki, at Kapakapaua,  
Remaining at Ulupaupau,  
There are the eyes of Hema." <span id="fr_600"></span>[14](#fn_600.md)

*Maori*. Hema is the son of Kai-tangata and Whaitiri. He weds
Ara-whita-i-te-rangi (Arahuta) who becomes mother of Tawhaki and
Karihi <span id="fr_601"></span>[15](#fn_601.md) or weds Kare-nuku, who
becomes mother of Pupu-mai-nono, Karihi, Tawhaki, <span
id="fr_602"></span>[16](#fn_602.md) or weds Uru-tonga and has Karihi and
Tawhaki <span id="fr_603"></span>[17](#fn_603.md) or Hema, daughter of the
same, weds Hu-aro-tu and has Karihi, Pupu-mai-nono, Tawhaki. Forbid-den
to follow her mother when Whaitiri leaves for her own country, she
attempts the journey and is taken captive by Te-tini-o-Waiwai (The
little spirits of the water). <span id="fr_604"></span>[18](#fn_604.md)
Hema is slain by the Ponaturi, underwater people, <span
id="fr_605"></span>[19](#fn_605.md) or killed and his wife taken captive at
the settlement of the whale people Paikea, Kewa, and Ihu-puku, <span
id="fr_606"></span>[20](#fn_606.md) or slain by the Patu-pae-a-rehe. In
some versions <span id="fr_607"></span>[21](#fn_607.md) Karihi is called
the "child" of Whaitiri.

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

*Tahiti*. Hina weds No‘a-huruhuru (hairy), who has saved her from her
cannibal mother Rona (or Haumea), and has two sons, Pu‘a-ari‘i-tahi and
Hema. The mother favors Hema because he does not refuse to louse her
hair and to swallow a red (and a white) louse which he finds in so
doing. She accordingly promises him a goddess for a wife. He is to find
Hua-uri (or Hina-tahutahu) at her bathing pool called Vai-te-marama (at
the Vaipoopoo river at Hanapepe) and catch her by the hair and carry her
past four (or twenty) houses without letting her feet touch the ground;
then she will lose her power and follow him. The first time he cannot
resist her pleadings, lets her down, and she runs away from him; the
second time he succeeds. Tafa‘i-iri-ura(-i-o-ura) is their child,
Arihi-nui-a-Pu‘a is the child of Pu‘a. When her child is abused by the
other children Hema's wife curses her husband and he tries to commit
suicide by leaping head down from the A‘a-‘ura and is caught by spirits
and carried to the Po (Tumu-i-Havai‘i) where his body becomes "a deposit
for the spirits' dung" and his eyes are used "as morning lights at the
mat-weaving place of Ta‘aroa's daughter." Hence in Tahiti a man with a
skin disease is compared with Hema as "a place for the excrement of the
spirits." <span id="fr_608"></span>[22](#fn_608.md)

 

Compare the Marquesan story of Kena who goes to the underworld after his
wife and must carry her out in a basket and by no means let her out or
she will escape. The first time he fails; the next time he
succeeds. <span id="fr_609"></span>[23](#fn_609.md) See also the Hawaiian
story of "Hiku and Kawelu."

*Tuamotu*. (*a*) *North islands*. Hema is son of Noa-huruhuru and Hina,
daughter of the cannibal woman Rona. Hina sends her son to seize
Hua-uri, "queen of Niue," and through the powerful incantations of Noa
he brings her back "naked and wailing." When their son Tafa‘i is abused
by the other boys Hema commits suicide and the "fairies of Matua-uru"
catch him and confine him in a latrine. <span
id="fr_610"></span>[24](#fn_610.md)

\(b\) *Fagatau*. Hema is the husband of Hua-uri, younger sister

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

of Arimata, and there is jealousy between the sisters over their sons
Niu-kura and Tahaki. Hema and Hua-uri go to the sea after a special kind
of sea urchin as food for their son. The goblin band of the Matua-uru
seize and carry off Hema while Hua-uri escapes. They pluck out his eyes
and fasten them to the belt band of the woman Roi-matagotago and use his
body as a filth pit. <span id="fr_611"></span>[25](#fn_611.md)

(*c*) *Anaa*. Hema lives in the upper valleys and seizes Hua-uri who
lives by the sea, daughter of Titimanu and Kuhi, while she is digging
arum root in the uplands. Kuhi sends a magic bunch of feathers to find
Hua-uri, and the wife, fearing lest her parents kill Hema, returns to
her parents and wins their consent to the marriage, although they warn
her that the man is not her equal. When her child is to be born she goes
to her parents' home and is bidden by her mother pick and eat a louse
from the mother's head. She picks first a black and then a red louse and
the mother predicts that her second child will be famous. When this
second child is to be born, Hema encroaches upon the beach where the
goblins of Matua-uru catch crabs and is pursued and seized. <span
id="fr_612"></span>[26](#fn_612.md)

 

*Rarotonga*. Ema is descended from Te Memeru, high chief of Kuporu. His
wife is Ua-uri-raka-moana who dwells by the deep sea. Kari‘i, Taaki, and
the girls Puapua-ma-inano and Inanomata-kopikopi are her children. The
older son Kari‘i refuses to bite the ulcer on her head; Taaki complies
and power enters into him so that light shines from his whole body.
Kari‘i is jealous because his father favors Taaki and offers his father
Hema in sacrifice at the marae to "many gods." Hema's eyes are taken
possession of by Tangaroa-a-ka-puta-ara, his body by the little gods.
"Ema, heap of filth!" the gods call him. <span
id="fr_613"></span>[27](#fn_613.md)

 

*Samoa* (*Vaitapu*). The brothers Punga (Pu‘a) and Sema seek wives.
Punga has many wives, Sema only a woman all sores named
Matinitini-ungakoa. He is derided, but his wife dives three times and
becomes beautiful, with a red skirt and lightning

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

flashes. Her children are Tafaki (Tafa‘i) and Kalisilisi (‘Alise).

 

The Kaha‘i (or Tawhaki) legend follows a more or less regular pattern,
although with local variations. Hema is always the father (in one
instance, mother); his wife is generally a goddess. A brother Alihi
constantly fails in under-takings in which Kaha‘i succeeds because of
his godlike endowments or of the chants of which he has command. His
cousins by his father's brother Puna (Punga, Pu‘a) or his own older
brothers often seek Kaha‘i's life.

### KAHA‘I LEGEND

*Hawaii*. Kaha‘i-nui (Kaha‘i the strong) is son of Hema, a chief of East
Maui living on the hill Kauiki in Hana district, and of Lua(Ula,
Ulu)-mahahoa from Iao valley in Wailuku district. He is born in Iao
valley at a place called Ka-halulukahi above Loiloa at Haunaka. His
chant tells how he goes "by the path of the rainbow" and guided by cloud
signs to seek his father, who has had his eyes. gouged out on an
expedition to foreign lands. His brother Alihi accompanies him but is
unable to keep the pace. The chant, as translated by Emerson, runs:

"Alihi's eyes were blinded,  
The horizon blinded his eyes,  
         .       .       .       .       .  
The foundations of heaven were shaken,  
The kinsfolk of the gods inquired,  
Kane and Kanaloa asked him,  
'O Kaha‘i! where are you going?'  
'I am seeking the eyes of Hema.'  
'They are in Kahiki, at Ulupa'pa‘u,  
There with the Aaia bird sought after by Kane  
You will find them on the borders of Kahiki.'"

\[paragraph continues\] On his return Kaha‘i lands on the Ka-u coast of
Hawaii and weds Hina-ulu-ohia at Kahuku and their child Wahieloa is born
at Wailau (or Punalu‘u). Kaha‘i dies at Kailiki‘i in Ka-u (hence

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

some say he never lived on Kauiki) and is buried in Iao valley, or, as
the chant says,

". . . on the plains of Kahului  
 . . . at Keahuku. . . ." <span id="fr_614"></span>[28](#fn_614.md)

 

*Maori*. Tawhaki's relatives are jealous because all women love him and
they set upon him and leave him for dead. He restores himself by his own
power (or is restored by wife, mother, or sister) and leaves the country
(calling down a flood upon those who have attempted his life). He and
Karihi his brother go to search for their father's bones (and to release
their mother from captivity in some versions). The bones are in the
possession of an underwater people called Pona-turi or Patu-pae-a-rehe
(or, of people like small birds) who cannot bear the sunlight but come
to land and sleep at night in a house called Manawa-tane. Approaching,
he hears his father's bones rattle (and finds his mother acting as
watchman). He stops up the chinks until it is broad day, and the spirit
people are killed by the sunlight (or killed as they attempt to escape
from the house). Or Tawhaki follows to the settlement where the father
was killed, hears the bones rattle, and avenges the father's death. He
ascends to the heavens guided by an old blind ancestress whom the
brothers en-counter roasting food and whose eyes he restores. She
directs him on his way, but Karihi is unable to make the ascent. She
also helps him secure a bird-woman as wife (Maikuku-makaha by name) when
she comes to her bathing pool; or a goddess (Tangotango or Hapai) comes
down from heaven to be his wife; or he takes the wife of his enemy at
the settlement he visits (Hine-nui-i-te-kawa). Sometimes he loses her
through a broken tapu or because he hurts her feelings, and ascends to
the heavens in search of her. <span id="fr_615"></span>[29](#fn_615.md)

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

In the Maori, Tawhaki is represented as man or god at discretion. <span
id="fr_616"></span>[30](#fn_616.md) He is god of thunder and
lightning. <span id="fr_617"></span>[31](#fn_617.md) He causes a flood by
stamping on the floor of the heavens. <span
id="fr_618"></span>[32](#fn_618.md) At the top of the mountain he takes off
his human form and clothes himself with lightning. <span
id="fr_619"></span>[33](#fn_619.md) He learns from his sister Pupu-mai-nono
incantations for walking on water without sinking. <span
id="fr_620"></span>[34](#fn_620) From Tama-iwaho (Te-maiwaho.md) he learns
incantations to cure diseases. <span id="fr_621"></span>[35](#fn_621.md)
From Maru he learns war chants (such as the Maori still use when cutting
off hair to prepare for war), <span id="fr_622"></span>[36](#fn_622.md) by
means of which he climbs to the heavens of Rahua, keeper of the
"elements of life."

The same incident may serve to embellish the legend of different members
of the family cycle.

(*a*) Tawhaki disguises himself as an old man and is taken as a slave
when he enters the settlement. Left to carry home the axes when the men
quit work, he completes with a few strokes the canoe which the men are
shaping, and brings in a huge load of wood besides. He goes to sit in a
tapu place, unrecognized by his wife. The next day he appears in
splendid person with lightning flashing from his armpits, claims his
wife, and performs the proper ceremonies for his little daughter. <span
id="fr_623"></span>[37](#fn_623.md)

(*b*) Tawhaki's descendant, Rata's son Tu-whaka-raro, has been killed by
the Poporo-kewa people and his wife Apakura summons her son Whaketau to
avenge her. He mingles with the wood gatherers, hears his father's bones
rattle, and when recognized by those in the house, escapes through the
smoke-hole and sets fire to the house Tihi-o-manono. <span
id="fr_624"></span>[38](#fn_624.md) He asks a slave by which road
Poporo-kewa comes, makes a slave summon him for the sweet-potato
planting, lays a noose and catches him (as in the Rata story). <span
id="fr_625"></span>[39](#fn_625.md)

The legend of Tafa‘i in Tahiti belongs to the chief (ari‘i)
culture. <span id="fr_626"></span>[40](#fn_626.md)

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *Tahiti*. Tafa‘i's mother is a goddess from
another world named Hina-tahutahu or Hua-uri (Ouri). His older cousin is
Arihi (Arii)-nui-a-Pu‘a. Anuenue (rainbow) is the canoe in which he
sails. He is blond and handsome. He lives in the Tapahi hills of Mahina
district, north Tahiti. His footsteps are to be seen in the hard rock.

The children of Pu‘a kill (or beat) him because he excels them in
sports, but he is brought back to life (by his mother) and later avenges
himself upon the boys by turning them into porpoises of the sea. He
descends to Po with Karihi (Arihi-nui-a-Pu‘a) after his father and,
helped by his old blind ancestress and guided by the dawn-star maiden,
finds him kept in the spirits' filth pit (the Matua-uru) and his eyes
being used "for morning lights at the net-plaiting place of Ta‘aroa's
daughters." He burns down the house with all inside, after netting the
place to prevent escape, and secures the eyes from the girls.

Pu‘a's children go on a courting expedition to Nu‘u-ta-farata (some say
to Hawaii) to woo a dangerous chiefess named Te-ura-i-te-ra‘i (Redness
in the heavens), or Tere, and refuse to let him go with them. He makes a
canoe out of a coconut sheath, reaches land first, and after his
brothers have been killed in the tests proposed, namely, to pull and
prepare awa from the living awa plant (Tumu-tahi) and to slay for the
feast the boar Mooiri (Moiri) who swallows men whole, he succeeds, eats
the whole feast lest the creature come to life, restores his brothers to
life, then deserts the chiefess. On the way home he turns his brothers
into porpoises.

Tafa‘i weds Hina of North Tahiti, famous for her long black hair. She
dies and he pursues her spirit to Te-mehani, the last place on the
island whence spirits take their departure to paradise or down to Po,
and restores her spirit to her body. They live at Uporu in Mahina
district of North Tahiti and Wahieroa is their son. <span
id="fr_627"></span>[41](#fn_627.md)

 

For the episode of the awa root and boar-killing test see the Tahitian
story of Hiro, who digs up the tree called Ava-tupu-tahi (Ava standing
alone) and kills the boar Mo‘iri

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

and the keepers of the two, Taru-i-hau and Te-rima-‘aere <span
id="fr_628"></span>[42](#fn_628.md) and compare the Mangaian version of
Ono-kura, who fells the ironwood tree which has formerly restored itself
and slain the feller, and kills the demon Vaotere at its taproot. <span
id="fr_629"></span>[43](#fn_629.md) Other episodes of the Tafa‘i story are
drawn from familiar Polynesian themes. In one version Tafa‘i's ancestral
shark Tere-mahia-ma-Hiva (Nutaravaivaria) carries him over the ocean but
swallows his brother. Tafa‘i redeems his brother with a big load of
coconuts, but later cracks a coconut on the shark's head and the shark
deposits both brothers in the sea, <span
id="fr_630"></span>[44](#fn_630.md) an episode also found in the Siouan
Indian twin story and hence probably borrowed.

*Tuamotu*. Tahaki is son of Hema and Hua-uri; Niu-kura is son of
Hua-uri's older sister Arimata. Both mothers vaunt the deeds of their
sons. Niu-kura is jealous and sends Tahaki to dive, kills him with a
spear, and cuts his body to pieces. His foster brother Karihi saves the
phallus and testicles and the mother restores him to life. When Niu-kura
and the other brothers go voyaging (or swimming) the mother (or Tahaki)
invokes her gods and they are changed into porpoises (or whales) and
live in the sea.

Tahaki and Karihi (Ariki) go to the land of Matua-uru(-au-huru),
directed by old blind Kuhi (Uhi) who gives them a net to trap the
spirits and offers to each of them one of her star maidens who come to
her house at night. Karihi fails to catch one, but Tahaki catches the
star called Tokurua-of-the-dawn; they struggle "way up to the floor of
the upper heaven and down again to earth" but he holds on to her and she
follows and lives with him. (He goes to a relative named Titi-manu and
is sent to the house Maurua-of-the-region-of-the-gods "toward the
flaming rays of the dawn" to woo Hora-hora and they have a daughter
Mehau.) They find Hema in the filth pit, clean him up with coconut oil,
restore his eyeballs (fastened to the belt of the woman Roi-matagotago),
and kill the spirits (but save the woman).

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

Tahaki climbs the High-coconut-to-Hiti (Niu-roa-i-Hiti) ("goes to Niue,"
says Leverd) and is blown off naked into Hina's bathing pool. Since the
"long girdle of Hiva" fits him exactly, he is recognized as the
"grandchild" of Ituragi and Tuaraki-i-te-po and sent to woo the high
chiefess Hapai. She at first rejects him, but finally recognizes his red
body, perfumes herself, and gives herself to him (or recognizes him too
late and he abandons her). Tane has not been consulted. He sets tests:
to pass before his face, sit upon his three-legged stool, and pull up
his sacred tree by the roots. From the hole thus made Tahaki can look
down to Havaiki. For a long time the two are happy together, then he
makes love to her sister Teharue. Hapai is jealous. He leaves her and
she follows and laments his death at Fagatau. <span

*Rarotonga*. Taaki is the son of Ema and Ua-uri-raka-moana. Ariki is his
elder brother. Ariki is jealous of Taaki's superior accomplishments.

The mother predicts excellence for Taaki and Ariki has his father
offered in sacrifice and tries to kill his brother. Taaki destroys three
companies of fifty men sent to bring him to the bathing pool where Ariki
plans to kill him, but follows his sister Ianao-mata-kopikopi and is cut
to bits. His sister Puapua-ma-inano brings the pieces together and
restores him to life.

Taaki sets out to seek his father by the road between heaven and earth
called Nu-roa-ki-Iti. He passes two women beating tapa, climbs to the
breast of his mother's sister Vaine-nui-tau-rangi (Altar of Tane), and
goes to Tangaroa-aka-puta-ara after Ema's eyes and to the "house of many
gods" after Ema's body, which is just about to be burned in sacrifice,
and kills the "many gods."

At Rangi-tuna he finds Tu-tavake who gives him culture gifts, among them
Maikuku. <span id="fr_632"></span>[46](#fn_632.md)

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

*Moriori*. Tawhaki is the son of Hema and father of Wahieroi by his wife
Hapai. She is the daughter of Tu and Hapai-mao-mao. Since he will not
allow her to give birth in the house Hapai leaves him and goes back to
heaven. He goes thither on the path of the spider web to seek her. He
gives sight to the old blind woman Ta Ruahine-mata-moai. He uses chants
to insure calm winds. <span id="fr_633"></span>[47](#fn_633.md)

 

*Samoa*. Tafa‘i belongs to a race of giants. He can hurl a coconut tree
and once "plucked up by the roots a great Malili tree, eighty feet high"
and "carried it off on his shoulder, branches and all." He can leave his
footprint in the solid rock as if it were sand. <span
id="fr_634"></span>[48](#fn_634.md)

Tafa‘i's parents Pua and Singano (Sigano) have names of sweet-smelling
trees. Sina-taeoilangi, a woman of the heavens, daughter of
Tangaloa-lagi, is sought in marriage by Tafa‘i. His messenger goes on
the road to heaven and carries a present of musty food. This is rejected
but Tafa‘i's suit is accepted. The two brothers disguise themselves as
if they were ugly lest they be slain by the people of the heavens, and
she refuses to have anything to do with them. In the morning they make
their bodies handsome and too late she sees the light flashing from
them. They leave her and she follows. They abandon her trapped in a
chasm, but Pua and Singano come and release her and take her to live
with them in the uplands of earth. She goes to the sea after sea water
for cooking in the hope of meeting Tafa‘i. He sees and desires her, but
she returns to the uplands and, mounting upon the housetop, takes her
way toward heaven, bidding him follow. On the way she meets her father
and his tribe bringing her marriage gifts and they persuade her to
return to Tafa‘i, where his sister turns herself into an ifiifi tree and
shakes down abundance of food for the feast. From this union is born La
(Sun), the heat of whose body is "like a whirlwind." La goes to live
with his mother in the skies and the story of his adventures in far
lands follows. Tafa‘i takes Sina-piripiri and has Fafieloa (Wahieloa).
Fafieloa takes Tula and has Lata (Laka). <span
id="fr_635"></span>[49](#fn_635.md)

The Kaha‘i cycle may be analyzed as follows:

\(A\) Ill-usage by relatives, (A1) avenged by their destruction.

\(B\) Expedition to a far land to rescue father (B1) from a filth pit
into which he has been thrown, (B2) to restore his eyes (B3) and avenge
his wrongs.

\(C\) Ascent to heaven (C1) guided by an old blind relative cooking food
(C2) whose eyesight he restores (C3) and who gives him directions (C4)
to find a wife.

\(D\) Winning of a wife (D1) whom he deserts (D2) or she deserts him
(D3) and he goes to bring her back.

The two adventures therefore most commonly told of Kaha‘i in Polynesian
legend are the quest in search of his father Hema and a courting
expedition, which may take the form of a search for a lost wife. The
restoration to sight of an old blind ancestress roasting food, who
directs his search and helps him to a wife from among her daughters, is
a common episode in the story.

In Maori versions she is the blind ancestress Whaitiri, Mata-kere-po
(Blind eyes), Te-ru-wahine-mata-moari, or Te-pu-o-toi, and she is found
roasting ten taro, sweet potatoes, bananas, or other vegetables. He
takes away one at a time until she is aware of his presence, then makes
his relationship known, cures her blindness with a touch or a slap, with
clay and spittle, incantations, or his brother's eyes and she shows him
the spirit path to the heaven of his ancestors, in the shape of an
arati‘ati‘a (notched ladder), hanging roots, a wall, spider's web, kite
line, or rope fastened to her neck. In several variants the capture of
Maikuku-makaha (her daughter) follows and the ascent to the heavens is
made in pursuit of this wife. <span id="fr_636"></span>[50](#fn_636.md)
Among the Moriori, the old blind woman to whom Tawhaki gives sight is Ta
Ruahine-mata-moai and he ascends to the heavens by the path of the
spider web. <span id="fr_637"></span>[51](#fn_637.md) In Tahiti, Ari‘i and
Tafa‘i on their way to seek Ema find Kui (Uhi) the blind in Havai‘i,

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

fishhook called Puru-i-te-maumau and her line "Shark of the
firmament" <span id="fr_638"></span>[52](#fn_638.md) and kill her; <span
id="fr_639"></span>[53](#fn_639.md) in Tumu-i-Havai‘i they meet blind Ui,
from whose four star daughters, named after the red feathers of the kula
bird, Tafa‘i selects a wife, the morning star Ura-i-ti‘a-hotu, to direct
him on the way. <span id="fr_640"></span>[54](#fn_640.md) In the Tuamotus,
Tahaki and Karihi find Kuhi (or ‘Ui) and Tahaki restores her sight by
throwing coconuts at her eyes (from a tree named Te-niu-roa-i-Hiti) and
wins the dawn star for wife. <span id="fr_641"></span>[55](#fn_641.md) In
Rarotonga the place of the blind ancestress is taken by
Vaine-nui-tau-rangi. Taaki climbs up to her breasts and gains
recognition from her as descendant. In a Tane story, Tane, on the way to
Iti-kau, goes first to Iti-marama, where he cures old blind Kui with a
coconut plucked from a tree guarded by insects. <span
id="fr_642"></span>[56](#fn_642.md) So in Mangaia, Tane swings over to
Enua-kura (Land of red parrot feathers) on a stretching tree and
restores the sight of old blind Kui and marries one of her daughters
named Ina, whom he later deserts because she becomes jealous. <span
id="fr_643"></span>[57](#fn_643.md) In Manihiki, Maui follows his parents
to the underworld, restores the sight of Ina the blind, and obtains from
her knowledge of coconuts and taro. <span
id="fr_644"></span>[58](#fn_644.md) In a Samoan story told in Tokelau,
Kalokalo-o-ke-La makes himself known to his old blind grandmother
counting eight taro buds, restores her sight, and climbs a tree guarded
by insects at whose summit he finds a spinning house and is given a
shell to use as a lucky fish lure. <span
id="fr_645"></span>[59](#fn_645.md) In Niue a divine child is cast out at
birth, but survives and goes to seek his father. He finds an old woman
cooking eight yams, whose sight he restores, and she tells him how to
recognize his father. <span id="fr_646"></span>[60](#fn_646.md) In the
Marquesas, the story of "Koomahu and his sister by the blind Tapa" tells
how Koomahu climbs to heaven on Peva's beard after his sister, who has
been caught on Tapa's hook. He finds old Tapa cooking bananas, restores
her

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

sight, and secures one of her star daughters as guide on the way to find
his sister. He finally climbs down from heaven with his sister on the
tree which he has planted below on the earth. <span
id="fr_647"></span>[61](#fn_647.md)

Although this adventure with the old blind ancestress is not mentioned
in the Hawaiian chant of Kaha‘i, the episode occurs in several other
quest stories from this group. According to Westervelt, Maui, on his way
to snare the sun, is directed by his mother Hina to his old blind
grandmother who is roasting bananas for the sun at a place up Kaupo
valley where there is a large wiliwili tree. The old woman gives him
another snaring rope and an axe, and hides him by the tree until the sun
appears. <span id="fr_648"></span>[62](#fn_648.md) In the Kana legend, Uli
sends her grandson Kana to bring back the sun. That she is conceived as
blind is shown by the statement that she has a rope stretched from her
door to the sea to guide her steps. Niheu is killed in the ascent but
restored by his brother on Kana's return victorious. <span
id="fr_649"></span>[63](#fn_649.md) In the legend of Kila, Moikeha's son on
his way to Kahiki visits the rat-woman Kane-pohihi (Kuponihi), whom he
finds blind and counting her cooked bananas. <span
id="fr_650"></span>[64](#fn_650.md) Aukelenui-a-iku, on his way in search
of the water of life, finds at the bottom of the pit Old-woman-Kaikapu
roasting bananas, steals them one by one, and restores her sight with
two sprouts of coconut, in return for which and her recognition of him
as a grandchild, she directs him how to win the water of life. <span
id="fr_651"></span>[65](#fn_651.md)

The episode, in Kaha‘i's quest after his father, of the destruction of
the spirits who fear daylight by trapping them inside a house is
referred by Von den Steinen to stories of expeditions from the Marquesas
islands undertaken after the red (kula, kura, ula) parrot feathers, so
highly prized for ornament, upon one of which trips Hema is supposed to
have lost his life. The Marquesan journey to Aotona after bird feathers
is to the Cook group thirteen hundred miles to the southwest from the
Marquesas. The story is here connected

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

with Aka or Aka-ui (Laka), grandson of Tafa‘i, who goes after the
feathers to adorn his son and daughter when they arrive at puberty.

### KURA LEGEND

Aka's party get directions from Mahaitivi who lives at Poito-pa in the
neighborhood of Atuona on Hivaoa and has visited Aotona and become a
friend of the Kula bird, and his sons Utunui and Pepu conduct the party.
They set out from the north coast of Hivaoa with a double canoe named
Va‘a-hiva carrying 140 rowers, eighty to a hundred of whom die of hunger
before they reach Aotona. Each of the islands at which they touch is
famous for certain scented plants, fruits, or bird feathers whose names
are mentioned, and the travelers are given free way when their own names
are spoken. At Aotona they build a house or rebuild Mahaitivi's,
sprinkle roasted coconut as a lure, and hide until the "kula" have
filled the house, thinking that their friend has returned. When all are
inside they close the doors and fill 140 bags with feathers, that the
families of the dead may also receive their portion. <span
id="fr_652"></span>[66](#fn_652.md)

\[paragraph continues\] The theme appears in Maori story unconnected
with the Kaha‘i cycle:

Tangaroa steals the child of Ruapupuke and sets him up as a figure at
the end of the ridgepole of a house at the bottom of the sea where live
the underwater people who fear daylight. The father follows and, advised
by an old woman, stops up the chinks of the house until it is broad day
and then lets the sun-light kill those within. <span
