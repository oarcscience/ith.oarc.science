# FOREWORD

The legends of a people are of interest to the scholar, the thinker, and
the poet.

The legends tell us of the struggles, the triumphs, and the wanderings
of the people, of their thoughts, their aspirations; in short, they give
us a twilight history of the race.

As the geologist finds in the rocks the dim records of the beginnings of
life on our planet, the first foreshadowings of the mighty forests that
have since covered the lands, and of the countless forms of animal life
that have at last culminated in Man, so does the historian discover in
the legends of a people the dim traces of its origin and development
till it comes out in the stronger light of the later day.

So it is with the legends of the Hawaiians, or of the Polynesian race.
We see them, very indistinctly, starting from some distant home in Asia,
finally reaching the Pacific Ocean, and then gradually spreading abroad
over its islands till they dominate a large portion of its extent.

In bringing together this collection of Hawaiian legends, the author of
this little book has conferred a great favor upon all those residents

{p. viii}

of Hawaii and of those visitors to its shores who may take an interest
in its original inhabitants, once an exceedingly numerous people, but
now a scattering remnant only. To that native race this little book will
be at once a joy and a sorrow; to the heart of the *haole*, who has
lived among them, known them intimately for thirty years or more (as has
the writer of this Foreword), and learned to love them, this collection
of the legends of old Honolulu brings a warm "Aloha!
