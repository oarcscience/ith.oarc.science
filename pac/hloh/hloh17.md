# XIII

### THE CANNIBAL DOG-MAN

Note: The Menehunes were the fairies of Hawaii. The goblins and gnomes
of valley or woodland were called the eepa people, while monsters having
the power of appearing in different kinds of bodies were called kupuas.
These usually had cruel and vindictive characters and were ready to
destroy and devour any persons they could catch. There were, however,
many kupuas of kindly spirit who gave watchful care to the members of
their own families.

The Menehunes were temple-builders, makers of great fish-ponds and even
highways. They made canoes, built houses, and did many of the pleasant
things fairies are always doing. Their good works are to be found to
this day on all the different islands of the Hawaiian group.

KA-HANAI-A-KE-AKUA (The-adopted-child-of-the-gods) was the chief whose
followers fought with the dragon-god, Kuna, for a canoe in Nuuanu
Valley. He was a friend of the fairies--the Menehune people. When he had
grown into young manhood and was going to have a temple of his own, with
his

{p. 91}

own gods to worship, the Menehunes heard about the plan for the walls
and altars and determined to build that temple for the chief.

As soon as the night shadows had fallen over the mountains back of
Honolulu the Menehunes were called together by their luna, or leader.
The stones necessary for the heiau (temple) walls were pointed out.
Flat-sided stones were selected for raised places and altars, smooth
stones were called for from the seashore to be laid down as the temple
floor. Bamboo and ohia sticks were to be brought with which to build
platforms for sacrifices, such as the bodies of human victims. All parts
of the temple building\[1\] even to the thatched houses for the priests
and chiefs were portioned among the little people.

In one night the work was finished, a feast was eaten, and the Menehunes
had scattered in the shadows of the forest thickets.

Kahanai took possession of his temple and dedicated it with the tabu
service and ceremonies. This meant that a tabu of silence or a tabu
forbidding work of any kind would be announced, and all the people of
the district or place in which the temple was located would obey that
tabu until the dedication ceremonies were all over and

\[1. This heiau (temple) was on the road to Pauoa Valley, now Pacific
Heights.\]

{p. 92}

the words "Noa, ua noa" were used, meaning that the tabu was over and
everything could be freely done as before.

The name given to this temple was Ka-he-iki.

In this temple the chief placed his friend and guardian, Kahilona, who
had cared for him from his babyhood, as his priest and teacher. Kahilona
was the priest of this temple. Kahilona prepared this chant for the
temple building.

"Gone is the little house,  
    The little house,  
Gone is the large house,  
    The large house,  
Gone is the short house,  
    The short house,  
Gone is the little house,  
    From Maiuu to Maaa-e.  
Let this be commenced.

Build, with the soft beat of the drum,  
With the murmur of the voice of the gods,  
With the low whine of the dog,  
With the low grunt of the pig,  
And the soft whispers of men.  
Here am I, Kahilona,  
    The teacher of prayer,  
    Proclaimed by Kahilona."

A kupua who was a dog-man overthrew the government of Kahanai and became
the ruling power between Nuuanu Valley and the sea. His own house and
heiau were at Lihue,--a place

{p. 93}

toward the Waianae Mountains. This kupua never attacked or injured any
members of the family of the very high chief or king of the island Oahu,
but he was a cannibal, and many of the people were killed and eaten by
him. He could appear at will either as a man or a dog.

His name was Kaupe. After he had eaten some of the people of Oahu he
went over the water to eat the men of Maui, and then went on to Hawaii,
where he captured the son of one of the high chiefs and carried him back
to Oahu, putting him in the temple at Lihue to keep him there until the
time came for a human sacrifice. Then the boy was to be killed and laid
on a platform before the gods.

The father of that boy left Hawaii to follow him to Oahu, thinking there
might be some way of saving his son. If he failed he could at least die
with him. When the father came to Oahu he very quietly landed and looked
for some one to give him aid. After a time he met Kahilona, the
caretaker of the temple of the Menehunes, and told him all his trouble.

The priest taught the father the proper incantations by which he could
get his boy away from the magic power of Kaupe, and save both himself
and his boy. Then he also taught the father a prayer which he was to use
if Kaupe should learn of their escape and pursue them.

{p. 94}

At night he approached the temple at Lihue repeating the chant which
Kahilona had taught him. He watched for the signs which the priest had
told him would indicate the place where the boy was kept, and followed
them carefully. He continually repeated his chant until he came inside
the walls and found the dog asleep guarding the boy. The father slipped
in, cautiously aroused the boy, and unfastened the cords which bound
him. Then they quietly passed the dog, guarded by the incantation:

"O Ku! O Lono! O Ka-ne! O Kanaloa!  
Save us two. Save us two."

Thus they passed out of the temple and fled toward the temple Ka-he-iki.

While they were running a great noise was heard far behind them. The dog
had been awakened, and had discovered the escape of his prisoner. Then
rushing like a whirlwind around the temple he found the direction in
which they had fled. This was the path naturally taken by those leaving
Oahu to escape to Hawaii. The great dog only waiting to learn the course
taken, pursued them on the wings of the wind.

The two chiefs fled, but saw that it was impossible to outrun the dog.
Then the father uttered the prayer which the priest had said

{p. 95}

would save them if Kaupe followed. They ran with increased strength and
swiftness, but the dog would soon be upon them. Again the father
repeated the prayer:

"O Ku! O Lono! O Ka-ne! O Kanaloa!  
By the power of the gods,  
By the strength of this prayer,  
Save us two. Save us two."

Then they found a great stone at Moanalua under which they were able to
hide.

The dog had only one thought, which was that the father and son would
return to Hawaii as speedily as possible aided by their gods, so he
rushed to the beach, leaped into the air and flew to Hawaii.

The chiefs went to the temple Ka-he-iki, and were gladly welcomed by the
priest, Kahilona, who taught them the prayers by which they could
overcome and destroy the dog-man.

After they were fully instructed they returned to their home on Hawaii
and waged war against their enemy. They obeyed the directions of the
priest and finally killed Kaupe.

But the ghost of Kaupe was not killed. He returned as a ghost-god to the
highest part of Nuuanu Valley, where in his shadow body he can sometimes
be seen in the clouds which gather around the mountain-tops or come down

{p. 96}

the valley. Sometimes his cloud-form is that of a large dog, and
sometimes he is very small, but there his ghost rests and watches over
the lands which at one time he filled with terror.

Kahilona, the priest of the temple Ka-he-iki, became the ancestor of one
of the greatest of the priestly clans of the islands-the Mo-o-kahuna
(the priests of the dragon) class of Oahu, noted for their ability to
read the signs of sky and sea and land.
