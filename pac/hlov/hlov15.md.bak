### GENEALOGY OF THE PELE FAMILY

THERE were gods, goddesses, and ghost-gods in the Pele family. Almost
all had their home in volcanic fires and were connected with all the
various natural fire phenomena such as earthquakes, eruptions, smoke
clouds, thunder, and lightning. Pele was the supreme ruler of the
household.

She had a number of brothers and sisters. There were also many
au-makuas, or ancestor ghost-gods, who were supposed to have been sent
into the family by incantations and sacrifices. Sometimes when death
came among the Hawaiians, a part of the body of the dead person would be
thrown into the living volcano, Kilauea, with all ceremony. It was
supposed that the spirit also went into the flame, finding there its
permanent dwelling-place. This spirit became a Pele-au-makua.

Pele's brother, Ka-moho-alii, and her older sister, Na-maka-o-ka-hai,
however, belonged to the powers of the sea. Ka-moho-alii, whose name was
sometimes given as Ka-moo-alii, was king of the sharks. He was a
favorite of the

{p. 64}

fire-goddess Pele. Na-maka-o-ka-hai, a sea-goddess, as a result of
family trouble, became Pele's most bitter enemy, fighting her with
floods of water, according to the legends.

Thus the original household represented the two eternal enemies, fire
and water. One set of legends says that Kane-hoa-lani was the father and
Hina-alii was the mother. Kane was one of the four great gods of
Polynesia,--Ku, Kane, Lono, and Kanaloa.

Kane-hoa-lani might be interpreted as "Kane, the divine companion or
friend." A better rendering is "Kane, the divine fire-maker." In most of
the legends and genealogies he is given a place among Pele's brothers.

There were many Hinas. The great Hina was a goddess whose stories
frequently placed her in close relation to the moon.

--It seems far-fetched to give Hina a place in the Pele family. The name
was evidently brought to the Hawaiian Islands from the South Seas and in
process of time was grafted into the Pele myth.--

Another set of legends published in the earliest newspapers, printed in
the Hawaiian language, say that Ku-waha-ilo and Haumea were the parents.
Ku was the fiercest and most powerful of the four chief gods. Haumea had
another name, Papa. She was the earth. This parentage

{p. 65}

was carried out in the most diverse as well as the most ancient of the
legends and seems to be worthy of acceptance. Ku-waha-ilo is in some
legends called Ku-aha-ilo. In both cases the name means "Ku with the
wormy mouth," or "Ku, the man-eater" (The cannibal), whose act made him
ferocious and inhuman in the eyes of the Hawaiians.

Pele has long been the fire-goddess of the Hawaiians. Her home was in
the great fire-pit of the volcano of Kilauea on the island of Hawaii,
and all the eruptions of lava have borne her name wherever they may have
appeared. Thus the word "Pele" has been used with three distinct
definitions by the old Hawaiians. Pele, the fire-goddess; Pele, a
volcano or a fire-pit in any land; and Pele, an eruption of lava.

King Kalakaua was very much interested in explaining the origin of some
of the great Hawaiian myths and legends. He did not make any statement
about the parents of the legendary family, but said that the Pele family
was driven from Samoa in the eleventh century, finding a home in the
southwestern part of the island Hawaii near the volcano Kilauea. There
they lived until an eruption surrounded and overwhelmed them in living
fire. After a time the native imagination, which always credited
ghost-gods, placed this family among the most

{p. 66}

powerful au-makuas and gave them a home in the heart of the crater. From
this beginning, he thought, grew the stories of the Pele family.

The trouble with Kalakaua's version is that it does not take into
account the relation of Pele to various parts of Polynesia.

The early inhabitants of the region around Hilo in the southwestern part
of the island Hawaii, near Kilauea, brought many names and legends from
far-away Polynesian lands to Hawaii. Hilo (formerly called Hiro),
meaning to "twist" or "turn," was derived from Whiro, a great Polynesian
traveller and sea-robber. The stories of Maui and Puna came from other
lands, so also came some of the myths of Pele.

Fornander, in "The Polynesian Race," says: "In Hawaiian, Pele is the
fire-goddess who dwells in volcanoes. In Samoan, Fee is a personage with
nearly similar functions. In Tahitian, Pere is a volcano."

These varieties of the name Pele, Fornander carries back also to the
pre-Malay dialects of the Indian Archipelago, where pelah means "hot,"
belem to "burn." Then he goes back still farther to the Celtic Bel or
Belen (the sun god), the Spartan Bela (the sun), and the Babylonian god
Bel. It might be worth while for some student of the Atlantic Coast or
Europe to find the derivation of the name Pele as applied

{p. 67}

to the explosive volcano of Martinique, and note its apparent connection
with the Pacific languages.

In Raratonga is found a legend which approaches the Hawaiian stories
more nearly than any other from foreign sources. There the great goddess
of fire was named Mahuike, who was known throughout Polynesia as the
divine guardian of fire. It was from her that Maui the demi-god was
represented by many legends as procuring fire for mankind. Her daughter,
also a fire-goddess, was Pere, a name identical with the Hawaiian Pele,
the letters *l* and *r* being interchangeable. This Pere became angry
and blew off the top of the island Fakarava. Earthquakes and explosions
terrified the people. Mahuike tried to make Pere quiet down, and finally
drove her away. Pere leaped into the sea and fled to Va-ihi (Hawaii).

A somewhat similar story comes in from Samoa. Mahuike, the god of fire
in Samoa, drove his daughter away. This daughter passed under the ocean
from Samoa to Nuuhiwa. After establishing a volcano there, the spirit of
unrest came upon her and she again passed under the sea to the Hawaiian
Islands, where she determined to stay forever.

In Samoa one of the fire-gods, according to some authorities, was Fe-e,
a name almost the

{p. 68}

same as Pele, yet nearly all the Samoan legends describe Fe-e as a
cuttlefish possessing divine power, and at enmity with fire.

Hon. S. Percy Smith, who was for a long time Minister of Native Affairs
in New Zealand and now is President of the Polynesian Society for
Legendary and Historical Research, writes that the full name for Pele
among the New Zealand Maoris is "Para-whenua-mea, which through
well-known letter changes is identical with the full Hawaiian name
Pele-honua-mea."

From several continued Pele stories in newspapers in the native
language, about 1865, the following sketch of the Pele family, is
compiled:

The god Ku, under the name Ku-waha-ilo, was the father. Haumea was the
mother. Her father was a man-eater. Her mother was a precipice (*i.e.*,
belonged to the earth). Others say Ku-waha-ilo, had neither father nor
mother, but dwelt in the far-off heavens. (This probably meant that he
lived beyond the most distant boundary of the horizon.)

Two daughters were born. The first, Na-maka-o-ka-hai, was born from the
breasts of Haumea. Pele was born from the thighs.

After this the brothers and sisters were given life by Haumea.
Ka-moho-alii, the shark-god, was born from the top of the head. He was
the elder brother, the caretaker of the family,

{p. 69}

always self-denying and ready to answer any call from his relatives.
Kane-hekili, Kane who had the thunder, was born from the mouth.
Kauwila-nui, who ruled the lightning, came from the flashing eyes of
Haumea. Thus the family came from the arms, from the wrists, the palms
of the hands, the fingers, the various joints, and even from the toes. A
modern reader would think that Haumea as Mother Earth threw out her
children in the natural outburst of earth forces, but it is extremely
doubtful if the old Hawaiians had any such idea. Yet the expression that
Haumea was a precipice might imply a misty feeling in that direction.

The youngest of the family, Hiiaka-in-the-bosom-of-Pele, was born an
egg. After she had been carefully warmed and nourished by Pele, she
became a beautiful child. When she grew into womanhood she was the
bravest, the most powerful, except Pele, and the most gentle and lovable
of all the sisters.

The names of the members of the household of fire are worth noting as
revealing the Hawaiian recognition of the different forces of nature.
Some said there were forty sisters. One list gives only four. They were
almost all called "The Hiiakas." Ellis in 1823 said the name meant
"cloud holder." Fornander says it means "twilight bearer." Hii conveys
the idea of

{p. 70}

lifting on the hip and arm so as to make easy. Aka means usually
"shadow," and pictures the long shadows of the clouds across the sky as
evening comes. There is really no twilight worth mentioning in the
Hawaiian Islands and Hiiaka would be better interpreted as "lifting
sunset shadows," or holding up the smoke clouds while their shadows fall
over the fires of the crater, conveying the idea of firelight shining up
under smoke clouds as they rise from the lake of fire.

The Hiiakas were "shadow bearers." There were eight well-known sisters:

Hiiaka-kapu-ena-ena (Hiiaka-of-the-burning-tabu), known also as
Hiiaka-pua-ena-ena (Hiiaka-of-the-burning-flower) and also as
Hiiaka-pu-ena-ena (Hiiaka-of-the-burning-hills).

Hiiaka-wawahi-lani
(Hiiaka-breaking-the-heavens-for-the-heavy-rain-to-fall).

Hiiaka-noho-lani (Hiiaka-dwelling-in-the-skies).

Hiiaka-makole-wawahi-waa (Hiiaka-the-fire-eyed-canoe-breaker).

Hiiaka-kaa-lawa-maka (Hiiaka-with-quick-glancing-eyes).

Hiiaka-ka-lei-ia (Hiiaka-encircled-by-garlands-of-smoke-clouds).

Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele (Hiiaka-in-the-bosom-of-Pele), who was known
also as the Young Hiiaka.

Some of the legends say that Kapo was one of Pele's sisters. Kapo was a
vile, murderous,

{p. 71}

poison-goddess connected with the idea of "praying to death,"\[1\] and
in the better legends is dropped out of the Pele family. There were
eleven well-known brothers:

Ka-moho-alii (The-dragon-or-shark-king).

Kane-hekili (Kane-the-thunderer).

Kane-pohaku-kaa (Kane-rolling-stones, or The-earthquake-maker).

Kane-hoa-lani (Kane-the-divine-fire-maker).

Kane-huli-honua
(Kane-turning-the-earth-upside-down-in-eruptions-and-earthquakes).

Kane-kauwila-nui (Kane-who-ruled-the-great-lightning).

Kane-huli-koa (Kane-who-broke-coral-reefs).

Ka-poha-i-kahi-ola (Explosion-in-the-place-of-life, *i.e.*, fountains of
bursting gas in the living fire).

Ke-ua-a-ke-po (The-rain-in-the-night, or
The-rain-of-fire-more-visible-at-night).

Ke-o-ahi-kama-kaua (The-fire-thrusting-child-of-war).

Lono-makua (Lono-the-father-who-had-charge-of-the-crater-and-its-fire).

The Thunderer and the Child-of-War were said to be hunchbacks. According
to the different legends Pele had four husbands, each of whom lived with
her for a time. Two of these were with her in the ancient homes of the
Hawaiians, Kuai-he-lani\[2\] and Hapakuela. These husbands were
Aukele-nui-a-iku and Wahieloa. Two husbands came to her while she dwelt
in Kilauea, her palace of fire in the Hawaiian Islands. One was the
rough Kama-puaa, the other was Lohiau, the handsome king of Kauai.
