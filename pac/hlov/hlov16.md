### PELE'S LONG SLEEP

PELE and her family dwelt in the beauty of Puna. On a certain day there
was a fine, clear atmosphere and Pele saw the splendid surf with its
white crests and proposed to her sisters to go down for bathing and
surf-riding.

Pele, as the high chiefess of the family, first entered the water and
swam far out, then returned, standing on the brink of the curling wave,
for the very crest was her surf-board which she rode with great skill.
Sometimes her brother, Kamohoalii, the great shark-god, in the form of a
shark would be her surf-board. Again and again she went out to the deep
pit of the waves, her sisters causing the country inland to resound with
their acclamation, for she rode as one born of the sea.

At last she came to the beach and, telling the sisters that the tabu on
swimming was lifted, and they could enter upon their sport, went inland
with her youngest sister, Hiiaka, to watch while she slept. They went to
a house thatched with ti\[1\] leaves, a house built for the goddess.

\[1. Cordyline terminalis.\]

{p. 73}

There Pele lay down, saying to her sister Hiiaka:

"I will sleep, giving up to the shadows of the falling evening--dropping
into the very depths of slumber. Very hard will be this sleep. I am
jealous of it. Therefore it is tabu. This is my command to you, O my
little one. Wait you without arousing me nine days and eight nights.
Then call me and chant the 'Hulihia'" (a chant supposed to bring life
back and revive the body).

Then Pele added: "Perhaps this sleep will be my journey to meet a
man--our husband. If I shall meet my lover in my dreams the sleep will
be of great value. I will sleep."

Hiiaka moved softly about the head of her sister Pele, swaying a kahili
fringed and beautiful. The perfume of the hala,\[1\] the fragrance of
Keaau, clung to the walls of the house. From that time Puna has been
famous as the land fragrant with perfume of the leaves and flowers of
the hala tree.

Whenever Pele slept she lost the appearance which she usually assumed,
of a beautiful and glorious young woman, surpassing all the other women
in the islands. Sleep brought out the aged hag that she really was.
Always when any worshipper saw the group of sisters and

\[1. Same as Lahala or Puhala, Pandanus adoratissimus.\]

{p. 74} Pele asleep in their midst they saw a weary old woman lying in
the fire-bed in the great crater.

While Pele was sleeping her spirit heard the sound of a hula-drum
skilfully played, accompanied by a chant sung by a wonderful voice. The
spirit of Pele arose from her body and listened to that voice. She
thought it was the hula\[1\] of Laka, who was the goddess of the dance.
Then she clearly heard male voices, strong and tender, and a great joy
awoke within her, and she listened toward the east, but the hula was not
there. Then westward, and there were the rich tones of the beaten drum
and the chant. Pele's spirit cried: "The voice of love comes on the
wind. I will go and meet it."

Pele then forsook Keaau and went to Hilo, but the drum was not there.
She passed from place to place, led by the call of the drum and dance,
following it along the palis (precipices) and over the deep ravines,
through forest shadows and along rocky beaches until she came to the
upper end of Hawaii. There she heard the call coming across the sea from
the island Maui. Her spirit crossed the channel and listened again. The
voices of the dance were louder and clearer and more beautiful.

She passed on from island to island until she came to Kauai, and there
the drum-beat and the

\[1. see Appendix, "Hula."\]

{p. 75}

song of the dance (lid not die away or change, so she knew she had found
the lover desired in her dream.

Pele's spirit now put on the body of strong healthful youth. Nor was
there any blemish in her beauty and symmetry from head to foot. She was
anointed with all the fragrant oils of Puna. Her dress was the splendid
garland of the red lehua flower and maile\[1\] leaf and the fern from
the dwelling-places of the gods. The tender vines of the deep woods
veiled this queen of the crater. In glorious young womanhood she went to
the halau. The dark body of a great mist enveloped her.

The drum and the voice had led her to Haena, Kauai, to the house of
Lohiau, the high-born chief of that island. The house for dancing was
long and was beautifully draped with mats of all kinds. It was full of
chiefs engaged in the sports of that time. The common people were
gathered outside the house of the chief.

The multitude saw a glorious young woman step out of the mist. Then they
raised a great shout, praising her with strong voices. It seemed as if
the queen of sunrise had summoned the beauty of the morning to rest upon
her. The countenance of Pele was like the clearest and gentlest
moonlight. The people made a vacant

\[1. Alyxia olivœformis\]

{p. 76}

space for the passage of this wonderful strange casting themselves on
the ground before her.

An ancient chant says.

O the passing of that beautiful woman.  
Silent are the voices on the plain,  
No medley of the birds is in the forest;  
There is quiet, resting in peace."

Pele entered the long house, passed by the place of the drums, and
seated herself on a resting-place of soft royal mats.

The chiefs were astonished, and after a long time asked her if she came
from the far-off sunrise of foreign lands.

Pele replied, smiling, "Ka! I belong to Kauai."

Lohiau, the high chief, said: "O stranger, child of a journey, you speak
in riddles. I know Kauai from harbor to clustered hills, and my eyes
have never seen any woman like you."

"Ka!" said Pele, "the place where you did not stop, there I was."

But Lohiau refused her thought, and asked her to tell truly whence she
had come. At last Pele acknowledged that she had come from Puna,
Hawaii,--"the place beloved by the sunrise at Haehae."

The chiefs urged her to join them in a feast, but she refused, saying
she had recently eaten

{p. 77}

and was satisfied, but she "was hungry for the hula--the voices and the
drum."

Then Lohiau told her that her welcome was all that he could give. "For
me is the island, inland, seaward, and all around Kauai. This is your
place. The home you have in Puna you will think you see again in Kauai.
The name of my house for you is Ha-laau-ola \[Tree of Life\]."

Pele replied: "The name of your house is beautiful. My home in Puna is
Mauli-ola \[Long Life\]. I will accept this house of yours."

Lohiau watched her while he partook of the feast with his chiefs, and
she was resting on the couch of mats. He was thinking of her marvellous,
restful beauty, as given in the ancient chant known as "Lei Mauna Loa."

Lei of Mauna Loa, beautiful to look upon.  
The mountain honored by the winds.  
Known by the peaceful motion.  
Calm becomes the whirlwind.  
Beautiful is the sun upon the plain.  
Dark-leaved the trees in the midst of the hot sun  
Heat rising from the face of the moist lava.  
The sunrise mist lying on the grass,  
Free from the care of the strong wind.  
The bird returns to rest at Palaau.  
He who owns the right to sleep is at Palaau.  
    I am alive for your love--  
        For you indeed."

{p. 78}

Then Lohiau proposed to his chiefs that he should take this beautiful
chiefess from Kauai as his queen, and his thought seemed good to all.
Turning to Pele, he offered himself as her husband and was accepted.

Then Lohiau arose and ordered the sports to cease while they all slept.
Pele and Lohiau were married and dwelt together several days, according
to the custom of the ancient time.

After this time had passed Lohiau planned another great feast and a day
for the hula-dance and the many sports of the people. When they came
together, beautiful were the dances and sweet the voices of Lohiau and
his aikane (closest friend).

Three of the women of Kauai who were known as "the guardians of Haena"
had come into the halau and taken their places near Lohiau. The people
greeted their coming with great applause, for they were very beautiful
and were also possessed of supernatural power. Their beauty was like
that of Pele save for the paleness of their skins, which had come from
their power to appear in different forms, according to their pleasure.
They were female mo-o, or dragons. Their human beauty was enhanced by
their garments of ferns and leaves and flowers.

Pele had told Lohiau of their coming and had charged him in these words:
"Remember, you

{p. 79}

have been set apart for me. Remember, and know our companionship.
Therefore I place upon you my law, 'Ke kai okia' \[Cut off by the sea\]
are you--separated from all for me."

Lohiau looked on these beautiful women. The chief of the women, Kilinoe,
was the most interesting. She refused to eat while others partook of a
feast before the dancing should begin, and sat watching carefully with
large, bright, shining eyes the face of Lohiau, using magic power to
make him pay attention to her charms. Pele did not wish these women to
know her, so placed a shadow between them and her so that they looked
upon her as through a mist.

--Some legends say that Pele danced the Hula of the Winds of Kauai,
calling their names until strong winds blew and storms of rain beat upon
the house in which the chiefs were assembled, driving the common people
to their homes.--

There the chiefs took their hula-drums and sat down preparing to play
for the dancers. Then up rose Kilinoe, and, taking ferns and flowers
from her skirts, made fragrant wreaths wherewith to crown Lohiau and his
fellow hula-drummers, expecting the chief to see her beauty and take her
for his companion. But the law of Pele was upon him and he called to her
for a chant before the dance should commence.

Pele threw aside her shadow garments and

{p. 80}

came out clothed in her beautiful pa-u (skirt) and fragrant with the
perfumes of Puna. She said, "It is not for me to give an olioli mele \[a
chant\] for your native dance, but I will call the guardian winds of
your islands Niihau and Kauai, O Lohiau! and they will answer my call."

Then she called for the gods who came to Hawaii; the gods of her old
home now known through all Polynesia; the great gods Lono and his
brothers, coming in the winds of heaven. Then she called on all the
noted winds of the island Niihau, stating the directions from which they
came, the points of land struck when they touched the island and their
gentleness or wrath, their weakness or power, and their helpfulness or
destructiveness.

For a long time she chanted, calling wind after wind, and while she
sang, soft breezes blew around and through the house; then came stronger
winds whistling through the trees outside. As the voice of the singer
rose or fell so also danced the winds in strict harmony. While she sang,
the people outside the house cried out, "The sea grows rough and white,
the waves are tossed by strong winds and clouds are flying, the winds
are gathering the clouds and twisting the heavens."

But one of the dragon-women sitting near Lohiau said: "The noise you
think is from the sea or rustling through the leaves of the trees is

{p. 81}

only the sound of the people talking outside the great building. Their
murmur is like the voice of the wind."

Then Pele chanted for the return of the winds to Niihau and its small
islands and the day was of the singer softened at peace as the voice
toward the end of the chant. Hushed were the people and wondering were
the eyes turned upon Pele by the chiefs who were seated in the great
halau. Pele leaned on her couch of soft mats and rested.

Very angry was Kilinoe, the dragon-woman. Full of fire were her eyes and
dark was her face with hot blood, but she only said: "You have seen
Niihau. Perhaps also you know the winds of Kauai." By giving this
challenge she thought she would overthrow the power of Pele over Lohiau.
She did not know who Pele was, but supposed she was one of the women of
high rank native to Kauai.

Pele again chanted, calling for the guardian winds of the island Kauai:

"O Kauai, great island of the Lehua,  
Island moving in the ocean,  
Island moving from Tahiti,  
Let the winds rattle the branches to Hawaii.  
Let them point to the eye of the son.  
There is the wind of Kane at sunset--  
The hard night-wind for Kauai."

{p. 82}

Then she called for kite-flying winds when the birds sport in the
heavens and the surf lies quiet on incoming waves, and then she sang of
the winds kolonahe, softly blowing; and the winds hunahuna, breaking
into fragments; and the winds which carry the mist, the sprinkling
shower, the falling rain and the severe storm; the winds which touch the
mountain-tops, and those which creep along the edge of the precipices,
holding on by their fingers, and those which dash over the plains and
along the sea-beach, blowing the waves into mist.

Then she chanted how the caves in the seacoast were opened and the
guardians of the winds lifted their calabashes and let loose evil winds,
angry and destructive, to sweep over the homes of the people and tear in
pieces their fruit-trees and houses. Then Pele's voice rang out while
she made known the character of the beautiful dragon-women, the
guardians of the caves of Haena, calling them the mocking winds of
Haena.

The people did not understand, but the dragon-women knew that Pele only
needed to point them out as they sat near Lohiau, to have all the chiefs
cry out against them in scorn. Out of the house they rushed, fleeing
back to their home in the caves.

When Pele ceased chanting, winds without

{p. 83}

number began to come near, scraping over the land. The surf on the reef
was roaring. The white sand of the beach rose up. Thunder followed the
rolling, rumbling tongue of branching lightning. Mist crept over the
precipices. Running water poured down the face of the cliffs. Red water
and white water fled seaward, and the stormy heart of the ocean rose in
tumbled heaps. The people rushed to their homes. The chiefs hastened
from the house of pleasure. The feast and the day of dancing were broken
up. Lohiau said to Pele: "How great indeed have been your true words
telling the evil of this day. Here have come the winds and destructive
storms of Haena. Truly this land has had evil to-day."

When Pele had laid herself down on the soft mats of Puna for her long
sleep she had charged her little sister, who had been carried in her
bosom, to wake her if she had not returned to life before nine days were
past.

The days were almost through to the last moment when Lohiau lamented the
evil which his land had felt. Then as the winds died away and the last
strong gust journeyed out toward the sea Pele heard Hiiaka's voice
calling from the island Hawaii in the magic chant Pele had told her to
use to call her back to life.

Hearing this arousing call, she bowed her head and wept. After a time
she said to Lohiau:

{p. 84}

"It is not for me to remain here in pleasure with you. I must return
because of the call of my sister. Your care is to obey my law, which is
upon you. Calm will take the place of the storm, the winds will be
quiet, the sea will ebb peacefully, cascades will murmur on the mountain
sides, and sweet flowers will be among the leaves. I will send my little
sister, then come quickly to my home in Puna."

Hiiaka knew that the time had come when she must arouse her goddess
sister from that deep sleep. So she commenced the incantation which Pele
told her to use. It would call the wandering spirit back to its home, no
matter where it might have gone. This incantation was known as "Hulihia
ke au ("The current is turning"). This was a call carried by the
spirit-power of the one who uttered it into far-away places to the very
person for whom it was intended. The closing lines of the incantation
were a personal appeal to Pele to awake.

"E Pele e! The milky way (the *i'a*) turns.  
E Pele e! The night changes.  
E Pele e! The red glow is on the island.  
E Pele e! The red dawn breaks.  
E Pele e! Shadows are cast by the sunlight.  
E Pele e! The sound of roaring is in your crater.  
E Pele e! The uhi-uha is in your crater \[this means the sound of wash
of lava is in the crater\].  
F Pele e! Awake, arise, return."

{p. 85}

The spirit of Pele heard the wind, Naue, passing down to the sea and
soon came the call of Hiiaka over the waters. Then she bowed down her
head and wept.

When Lohiau saw the tears pouring down the face of his wife he asked why
in this time of gladness she wept.

For a long time she did not reply. Then she spoke of the winds with
which she had danced that night-the guardians of Niihau and Kauai, a
people listening to her call, under the ruler of all the winds, the
great Lono, dwelling on the waters.

Then she said: "You are my husband and I am your wife, but the call has
come and I cannot remain with you. I will return to my land--to the
fragrant blossoms of the hala, but I will send one of my younger sisters
to come after you. Before I forsook my land for Kauai I put a charge
upon my young sister to call me before nine days and nights had passed.
Now I hear this call and I must not abide by the great longing of your
thought."

Then the queen of fire ceased speaking and began to be lost to Lohiau,
who was marvelling greatly at the fading away of his loved one, As Pele
disappeared peace came to him and all the land of Kauai was filled with
calm and rest.

Pele's spirit passed at once to the body lying in the house thatched
with ti\[1\] leaves in Puna.

\[1. Cordyline terminalis.\]

{p. 86}

Soon she arose and told Hiiaka to call the sisters from the sea and they
would go inland.

Then they gathered around the house in which Pele had slept. Pele told
them they must dance the hula of the lifted tabu, and asked them, one
after the other, to dance, but they all refused until she came to
Hiiaka, who had guarded her during her long sleep. Hiiaka desired to go
down to the beach and bathe with a friend, Hopoe, while the others went
inland.

Pele said, "You cannot go unless you first dance for the lifted tabu."

Hiiaka arose and danced gloriously before the hula god and chanted while
she danced--

"Puna dances in the wind.  
The forest of Keaau is shaken.  
Haena moves quietly.  
There is motion on the beach of Nanahuki.  
The hula-lea danced by the wife,  
Dancing with the sea of Nanahuki.  
Perhaps this is a dance of love,  
For the friend loved in the sleep."

Pele rejoiced over the skill of her younger sister and was surprised by
the chanted reference to the experiences at Haena. She granted
permission to Hiiaka to remain by the sea with her friend Hopoe, bathing
and surf-riding until a messenger should be sent to call her home to
Kilauea. Then Pele and the other sisters went inland.
