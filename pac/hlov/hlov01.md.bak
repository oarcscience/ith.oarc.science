# FOREWORD

However doctors may differ concerning the way that our earth came into
being, most of them agree that in its early days meteoric bodies from
space flew together and produced a hotter globe than at present. Perhaps
its surface was all covered with vast circular lakes of lava such as our
telescopes reveal in great perfection, ring upon ring, over the surface
of the moon. On the moon these rings and pits are now cold, remnant from
a time when the gases from the inside of our satellite were bubbling
forth from a great internal heat supply and bringing with them oceans of
slag which seethed and swirled in circular pools which formed
symmetrically within ramparts of their own spatter.

The earth is not without traces of similar circular ramparts in the
shape of long curved chains of volcanoes, mostly in the sea, which would
appear as ridges if the ocean were to dry up. The line of the Hawaiian
Islands from Kauai to Mauna Loa on the large island of Hawaii is such a
curved ridge, now of enormous height

{p. viii}

above the bottom of the Pacific, but perhaps at one time much lower and
more extended into something like a circle. These islands appear to have
been built by overflows of lava from a curved crack which followed along
the old rampart, just as we now find smoke-cracks along the small
ramparts which restrain the hot lavas in Halemaumau in the pit of
Kilauea. The last activity along this crack appears to have moved slowly
through thousands of years from west to east, and each volcanic mountain
that was built made a stopper to force the liquid out along the crack
farther eastward until finally two live volcanoes, Mauna Loa and
Kilauea, were left at the extreme east end, still spouting out the
liquid and building up domes.

Some men of science say that the molten liquid, which is mostly an
iron-stained glass, foamy with the intensely hot gases which escape from
the inside of the earth, comes from an under layer beneath the outer
crust of the earth, which would be found anywhere if we went down deep
enough. Others say that it comes from scattered pockets of liquid under
a stiff shell and over a stiffer inner globe. However this may be, there
is some agreement that the depth from which the liquids come is about
seventy miles and we know that vast quantities of gas escape with them.
Possibly the gases

{p. ix}

unite chemically with each other and so themselves produce some of the
heat.

It is clear that heat and gas action are the motive agents which make
volcanoes so lively, so much so that simultaneously Mauna Loa and
Kilauea may maintain liquid columns of lava at two different elevations
ten thousand feet apart. This is accounted for by the fact that the
melted glass is so charged with gases under high pressure that it
seethes up and down in the cracks and tubes which it occupies according
to their form and size, and according to the coming together or opening
apart of their walls, just as any sparkling wine makes a foam which
rises or falls according to the suddenness of the uncorking or to the
size of the glass into which it is poured.

Sudden uncorking is an apt simile for volcanoes in general, as most of
them, unlike Kilauea, erupt very suddenly and explosively. This is due
to the way in which the gas-charged liquid has become confined under the
solidified mountain, and so only at long intervals becomes so hot and so
insinuating that it finds a way out and, once released, spouts like the
open safety-valve of a steam engine until the gas pressure is relieved.
But even Kilauea is not guiltless of terrific and destructive explosive
eruption. About 1790, thousands of tons of gravel and

{p. x}

boulders and dust were strewn over Hawaii from Kilauea, covering
hundreds of square miles, destroying the vegetation, and killing some of
the people. This would appear to be a crisis reached every few
centuries, and perhaps dependent on a building up of the mountain by
lava to a certain height where the foam column is so confined that it
can no longer overflow and so is compelled to explode.

Mauna Loa is a much more productive volcano than Kilauea, for its flows
have covered a vast territory with new lava within the century past,
whereas Kilauea has done much less overflowing. Everything indicates
that Kilauea is older than Mauna Loa. Mauna Loa with its flows is
tending through the ages to bury up Kilauea, and it is quite possible
that within a few centuries there will be flows from Mauna Loa which
will cascade over the wall into Kilauea crater and so make Kilauea
Mountain appear to be a mere spur of Mauna Loa. Mauna Kea to the north
appears to have been a great circular volcano about one hundred miles in
diameter, and when it had extinguished itself by too much building, its
lava took refuge in making two new cones out on the edge of the old
mountain, namely Kilauea and Hualalai. These built up until they had
nearly exhausted the lava available, owing to their height, and then a
new vent,

{p. xi}

Mauna Loa, burst out in the center, filling a long spoon-shaped valley
between them and to the southwest of Mauna Kea. The new mountain has now
built itself up to a height almost equal to that of Mauna Kea. and
probably in a few centuries will begin exploding and heaping up cinder
cones just as Mauna Kea did before it finally became extinct.

Some such story as this outlines the tremendous events, explosions,
whirlwinds, avalanches, lava flows, earthquakes, and fiery blasts which
composed the narrative of the domain of Pele before man appeared upon
the scene. We do not know how much more frequent these things were in
the old days, but there were probably eras of quiet and eras of
excitement just as at present. It behooves us to give the closest
possible attention to all the events of the present and to record them
faithfully, so as to render to the scientific historian of the future a
consecutive account of all the details which will lead up to some great
crisis in the days to come.
