### HIIAKA AND THE SEACOAST KUPUAS

KUPUAS were legendary monsters which could change themselves into human
beings at will. They were said to have come from far-off lands with the
early settlers. They had descendants who lived along the seacoast or in
out-of-the-way places inland. They were always ready to destroy and
often devour any strangers passing near them. Frequently they were
sharks which had a shark mouth although appearing like men. This mouth
was between the shoulders and was concealed by a cape thrown carefully
over the back. As human beings they would mingle with their fellows and
go out in the sea, bathing and surf-riding, but when they went into the
water they would dive under, assume their shark form, and catch some one
of the bathers. They would carry the body to some under-water cave,
where it could be devoured. All other sea monsters were given human
qualities--some were helpful to men and some were destructive.

Fabled monsters lived on land. Some of these were gigantic lizards,
probably the legendary

{p. 118}

memory of the crocodiles of their ancient home in India. Some were the
great clouds floating in the heavens. Peculiar rocks, trees, precipices,
waterfalls, birds, indeed everything with or without life, might be
given human and supernatural power and called kupuas. After a time
various objects began to have worshippers who became priests supposed to
be endowed with the qualities of the objects worshipped. These, in the
later days, have been considered sorcerers or witches, receiving the
name kupuas.

##### MAKAUKIU

Hiiaka, the sister of Pele, the goddess of volcanoes, by her magic power
was able to find and destroy many of these mysterious monsters. She bad
two companions as she journeyed along the eastern coast of the island
Hawaii, Their way was frequently very wearisome as they climbed down
steep precipices into valleys and gulches and then had to climb up on
the other side.

In one valley beautiful clear sea-water invited the girls to bathe. Two
of them threw aside their tapa clothes and ran down to the beach. Hiiaka
bade them wait, telling them this was the home of Makaukiu, a very
ferocious monster. But the girls thought they could see any evil

{p. 119}

one, if living in that pure, clear water, so they laughed at their
friend and went to the edge of the water. Hiiaka took some fragrant
ti-leaves, made a little bundle and threw it into the sea. The girls
made ready to leap and swim, when suddenly Makaukiu appeared just below
the surface, catching and shaking the leaves.

The girls fled inland to higher ground, but Hiiaka stood at the edge of
the sea. The sea monster tried to catch her in his great mouth. He
lashed the water into foam, trying to strike her with his tail. He tried
to wash her into the sea by pushing great, whirling waves against her,
but Hiiaka struck him with the mighty forces of lightning and fire which
she had in her magic skirt. Soon he was dead and his body floated on the
water until the tide swept it out to sink in the deep sea. The place
where this monster was slain was given his name and is still called "The
Swimming-Hole of Makaukiu."

##### MAHIKI

The Hawaiians say that the desire for battle was burning in the heart of
Hiiaka and she longed to kill Mahiki, who lived near Waipio Valley--one
of the most beautiful of all the valleys of the Hawaiian Islands. Mahiki
was a whirlwind. When he saw the girls coming he fled

{p. 120}

inland, hiding himself in a cloud of dust. Whenever the girls came
toward him he fled swiftly to a new place. They could not catch and
destroy him.

As they were following the whirlwind they heard some one calling. They
stopped and found two persons without bones--the bodies were flesh, soft
and yielding, yet of human form. Hiiaka had pity on them, so she took
the ribs of a long leaf and pushed them into the soft bodies, where they
became bones. Then the two could stand. After a time they could use
their new bones in their legs and walk.

##### PILI AND NOHO

Hiiaka remembered that there were two dragons in the river Wailuku, a
river of swift cascades and beautiful waterfalls near Hilo, so she
turned back filled with the wish to destroy them and free the people
from that danger.

At the place where the people crossed the river were two things which
looked like large, flat logs tossing in the water. Any person wishing to
cross the river would lay fish, sweet potatoes, and other kinds of food
on the logs. When these things disappeared the logs would act sometimes
as a bridge and sometimes as a boat, taking those who had given presents
across the river. These

{p. 121}

logs were the great tongues of the dragons Pili-a-moo and Noho-a-moo,
i.e., the dragon Pili and the dragon Noho.

Hiiaka and her two companions came to the river side. The travellers
called for an open way across.

One dragon said to the other, "Here comes one of our family."

The other said: "What of that? She can cross if she pays. If she does
not give our price, she shall not go over in this place."

Hiiaka ordered the dragons to prepare her way, but they refused. Then
she taunted them as slaves, ordering them to bring vegetable food and
fish. The dragons became angry and thrashed the water into whirlpools,
trying to catch the travellers and pull them into the river. The people
from far and near gathered to the place of this strange conflict.

A chief laughed at Hiiaka, saying, "These are dragon-gods, and yet you
dispute with them!"

Hiiaka said, "Yes, they are dragon-gods, but when I attack them they
will die."

The chief offered to make any bet desired that she could not injure the
dragons.

Hiiaka said, "I have no property, but I wager my body, my life, against
your property that the dragons die."

Then began a great conflict along the banks

{p. 122}

and in the swift waters. Hiiaka struck the dragons with her magic skirt
in which was concealed the divine power of lightning. They tried to
escape, but Hiiaka struck again and again and killed them, changing the
bodies into blocks of stone. Then she called the chief, saying, "I have
made the way safe for your people and you; I give back your property and
the land of the dragons."

Hiiaka and her friends turned north again and hastened to Waipio Valley
to catch Mahiki--the demon of the whirlwind. He ran down to meet her and
threw dust all over them, then fled inland to the mountains. Hiiaka
chanted:

"I am above Waipio,  
My eyes look sharply down.  
I have gone along the path  
By the sea of Makaukiu,  
Full flowing like the surf.  
I have seen Mahiki,  
I have seen that he is evil,  
Evil, very evil indeed."

##### MOO-LAU

Then Hiiaka thought of Moo-lau, who was the great dragon-god of the
district Kohala. He had a great multitude of lesser gods as his
servants.

{p. 123}

Hiiaka clearly and sweetly called for the dragon-gods to prepare a way
for her and also to bring gifts for herself and her companions.

Moo-lau answered, "You have no path through my lands unless you have
great strength or can pay the price."

Then began one of the great legendary battles of ancient Hawaiian
folk-lore. Hiiaka, throwing aside her flower-wreaths and common clothes,
took her lightning pa-u (skirt) and attacked Moo-lau. He fought her in
his dragon form. He breathed fierce winds against her. He struck her
with his swift-moving tail. He tried to catch her between his powerful
jaws, He coiled and twisted and swiftly whirled about, trying to knock
her down, but she beat him with her powerful hands in which dwelt some
of the divine power of volcanoes. She struck his great body with her
magic skirt in which dwelt the power of the lightning. Each pitted
supernatural powers against the other. Each struck with magic force and
each threw out magic strength to ward off deadly blows. They became
tired, very tired, and, turning away from each other, sought rest. Again
they fought and again rested.

Hiiaka chanted an incantation, or call for help:

{p. 124}

"Moo-lau has a dart  
Of the wood of the uhi-uhi;\[1\]  
A god is Moo-lau, Moo-lau is a god!"

This was a spirit-call going out from Hiiaka. It broke through the
clouds hanging on the sides of the mountains. It pierced the long, long
way to the crater of Kilauea. It roused the followers of the
fire-goddess. A host of destructive forces, swift as lightning, left the
pit of fire to aid Hiiaka.

Meanwhile Moo-lau had sent his people to spy out the condition of
Hiiaka. Then he called for all the reptile gods of his district to help
him. He rallied all the gnomes and evil powers he could order to come to
his aid and make a mighty attack.

When the battle seemed to be going against her, suddenly the Ho-ai-ku
men and the Ho-ai-ka women, the destructive gnomes from the crater,
broke in a storm upon Moo-lau and his demons. Oh, how the little people
from the pit devoured and destroyed the dragon army! The slaughter of
the reptile horde was quickly accomplished and Hiiaka soon saw the body
of her enemy the dragon-god trampled underfoot.

When the god Mahiki saw that Moo-lau was slain and his army defeated he
raised a great

\[1. Smilax Sandwicensis.\]

{p. 125}

cloud of dust and fled far off around the western side of the island.
The whirlwind was one of the earth-monsters which even the sister of the
goddess of volcanoes could not destroy.

Many were the evil demi-gods who tried to hinder Hiiaka in her journey
along the east coast of the island Hawaii. Sharks fought her from the
seas. The gnomes and dragons of valley and forest tried to destroy her.
Even birds of evil omen came into the fight against her, but she
conquered and killed until the land was freed from its enemies and the
people of the districts along the sea could journey in comparative
safety.

Pau-o-palae, the goddess of ferns, met the chief of this land which had
been freed from the power of the dragon. She saw him swimming in the sea
and, forgetting her companions, leaped in to sport with him. They at
once decided to be married. Then she turned aside to his new home,
leaving Hiiaka and Wahine-omao to go on after Lohiau.
