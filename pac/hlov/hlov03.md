Note:--The great volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands on account of their
magnitude, gradual slope, character and location do not lend themselves
to interesting photography, as whatever is attempted must be done at sea
on swaying ships in rough channels some distance out and detail is lost,
hence the illustrations in this volume include many of the vast craters
forming the volcanic rim which surrounds that "Crack in the Floor of the
Pacific" over which the Hawaiian Islands are situated.
