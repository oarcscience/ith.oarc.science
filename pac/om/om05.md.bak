# OCEANIC MYTHOLOGY

## PART I

### POLYNESIA

THAT portion of Oceania whose mythology is both most is widely known and
to which reference is most frequently made is undoubtedly Polynesia. One
of the chief reasons for this lies in the character of the legends
themselves, for they are both pleasing and in many respects unusual. We
may well begin then with Polynesia in presenting an outline of Oceanic
mythology.

The people of these Happy Isles have, from the beginning, been of great
interest to anthropologists; but although much has been learned
regarding them, the problems of their origin and ethnic history are
still far from being settled. Most students of the subject, however, are
now agreed that in the Polynesians we must see a somewhat complex
blending of several waves of immigration, bringing relatively
fair-skinned peoples from the Indonesian area (or perhaps from still
farther west) eastward through Melanesia into the Pacific. That there
have been at least two, and probably more, such great waves, and that
these have in varying degree mixed with the dark-skinned people of
Melanesia in transit, seems clear; but whether other racial elements
also enter into the question is not yet certain. Although older and
younger waves are probably represented in all the island-groups of
Polynesia, the oldest seems especially noticeable in two of the most
outlying portions of the whole region, i. e. New Zealand and Hawaii. The
detailed study of the spread of these waves can as yet however be said
only to have begun.
