# XXIX.--THE HULA KOLANI

For the purpose of this book the rating of any variety of hula must
depend not so much on the grace and rhythm of its action on the stage as
on the imaginative power and dignity of its poetry. Judged in this way,
the *kolani* is one of the most interesting and important of the hulas.
Its performance seems to have made no attempt at sensationalism, yet it
was marked by a peculiar elegance. This must have been due in a measure
to the fact that only adepts--*olóhe*--those of the most finished skill
in the art. of hula, took part in its presentation. It was a hula of
gentle, gracious action, acted and sung while the performers kept a
sitting position, and was without instrumental accompaniment. The fact
that this hula was among the number chosen for presentation before the
king (Kamehameha III) while on a tour of Oahu in the year 1846 or 1847
is emphatic testimony as to the esteem in which it was held by the
Hawaiians themselves.

The mele that accompanied this hula when performed for the king's
entertainment at Waimanalo was the following:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

He ua la, he ua,  
He ua pi’i mai;  
Noe-noe halau,  
Halau lea o Lono.  
5 O lono oe;  
Pa-á-a na pali  
I ka hana a Ikuwá--  
Pohá ko-ele-ele.  
A Welehu ka maláma,  
10 Noho i Makali’i;  
Li’i-li’i ka hana.  
Aia a e’é-u,  
He eu ia no ka la hiki.  
Hiki mai ka Lani,  
15 Nauweuwe ka honua,  
Ka hana a ke ola’i nui:  
Moe pono ole ko’u po--  
Na niho ai kalakala,  
Ka hana a ka Niuhi  
20 A mau i ke kai loa.  
He loa o ka hiki’na.  
A ua noa, a ua noa.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Lo, the rain, the rain!  
The rain is approaching;  
The dance-hall is murky,  
The great hall of Lono.  
5 Listen! its mountain walls  
Are stunned with the clatter,  
As when in October,  
Heaven's thunderbolts shatter.  
Then follows Welehu,  
10 The month of the Pleiads.  
Scanty the work then done,  
Save as one's driven.  
Spur comes with the sun,  
When day has arisen.  
15 Now comes the Heaven-born:  
The whole land doth shake,  
As with an earthquake;  
Sleep quits then my bed:  
How shall this maw be fed!  
20 Great maw of the shark--  
Eyes that gleam in the dark  
Of the boundless sea!  
Rare the king's visits to me.  
All is free, all is free!

If the author of this Hawaiian idyl sought to adapt its descriptive
imagery to the features of any particular landscape, it would almost
seem as if he had in view the very region in which Kauikeaouli found
himself in the year 1847 as he listened to the mele of this unknown
Hawaiian Theocritus. Under the spell of this poem, one is transported to
the amphitheater of Mauna-wili, a valley separated from Waimanalo only
by a rampart of hills. At one's back are the abrupt walls of Konahuanni;
at the right, and encroaching so as almost to shut in the front, stands
the knife-edge of Olomana; to the left range the furzy hills of
Ulamawao; while directly to the front, looking north, winds the green
valley, whose waters, before reaching the ocean, spread out into the
fish-ponds and duck swamps of Kailua. It would seem as if this must have
been the very picture the idyllic poet had in mind. This smiling, yet
rock-walled, amphitheater was the vast dance-hall of Lono--*Halau loa o
Lono* (verse 4)--whose walls were deafened, stunned (*pa-á-a*, verse 6),
by the tumult and uproar of the multitude that always followed in the
wake of a king, a multitude whose night-long revels banished sleep: *Moe
pono ole ko’u po* (verse 17). The poet seems to be thinking of this same
hungry multitude in verse 18, *niho ai kalakala*, literally the teeth
that tear the food; also when he speaks of the Niuhi (verse 19), a
mythical shark, the glow of whose eyes was said to be visible for a
great distance in the ocean, *A mau i ke kai loa* (verse 20).

*Ikuwá*, *Welehu*, *Makali’i* (verses 7, 9, and 10). These were months
in the Hawaiian year corresponding to a part of September, October and
November, and a part of December. The Hawaiian year began when the
Pleiades (*Makali’i*) rose at sunset (about November 20), and was
divided into twelve lunar months of twenty-nine or thirty days each. The
names of the months differed somewhat in the different parts of the
group. The month *Ikuwá* is said to have been so named from its being
the season of thunderstorms. This does not of itself settle the time of
its occurrence, for the reason that in Hawaii the procession of the
seasons and the phenomena of weather follow no definite order; that is,
though electrical storms occur, there is no definite season of
thunderstorms.

*Maka-li’i* (verse 10) was not only the name of a month and the name
applied to the Pleiades, but was also a name given the cool, the rainy,
season. The name more commonly given this season was *Hooilo*. The
Makahiki period, continuing four months, occurred at this time of the
year. This was a season when the people rested from unnecessary labor
and devoted themselves to festivals, games, and special religious
observances. Allusion is made to this avoidance of toil in the words
*Li’ili’i ka hana* (verse 11).

One can not fail to perceive a vein of gentle sarcasm cropping up in
this idyl, softened, however, by a spirit of honest good feeling.
Witness the following: *Noe-noe* (verse 3), primarily meaning cloudy,
conveys also the idea of agreeable coolness and refreshment. Again,
while the multitude that follows the king is compared to the ravenous
man-eating *Niuhi* (verse 19), the final remark as to the rarity of the
king's visits, *He loa o ka hiki’na* (verse 21), may be taken not only
as a salve to atone for the satire, but as a sly self-gratulation that
the affliction is not to be soon repeated.
