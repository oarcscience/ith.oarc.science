# XXXIX.--THE HULA KU'I

The account of the Hawaiian hulas would be incomplete if without mention
of the hula *ku’i*. This was an invention, or introduction, of the last
quarter of the nineteenth century. Its formal, public, appearance dates
from the coronation ceremonies of the late King Kalakaua, 1883, when it
filled an important place in the programme. Of the 262 hula performances
listed for exhibition, some 30 were of the hula ku’i. This is perhaps
the most democratic of the hulas, and from the date of its introduction
it sprang at once into public favor. Not many years ago one could
witness its extemporaneous performance by nonprofessionals at many an
entertainment and festive gathering. Even the school-children took it up
and might frequently be seen innocently footing its measures on the
streets. ([Pl. xxiv](#img_pl24)..md)

The steps and motions of the hula ku’i to the eyes of the author
resemble those of some Spanish dances. The rhythm is in common, or
double, time. One observes the following motions:

*Figure A*.--1. A step obliquely forward with the left foot, arms
pointing the same way, body inclining to the right. 2. The ball of the
left foot (still advanced) gently pressed on the floor; the heel swings
back and forth, describing an arc of some 30 or 40 degrees. 3. The left
foot is set firmly in the last position, the body inclining to it as the
base of support; the right foot is advanced obliquely, and 4, performs
the heel-swinging motions above described, arms pointing obliquely to
the right.

*Figure B*.--Hands pressed to the waist, fingers directed forward,
thumbs backward, elbows well away from the body; left foot advanced as
in figure A, 1, body inclining to the right. 2. The left foot performs
the heel-waving motions, as above. 3. Hands in same position, right foot
advanced as previously described. 4. The right foot performs the
swinging motions previously described--the body inclined to the left.

*Figure C*.--In this figure, while the hands are pressed as before
against the waist, with the elbows thrown well away from the body, the
performer sways the pelvis and central axis of the trunk in a circular
or elliptical orbit, a movement, which, carried to the extreme, is
termed ami.

There are other figures and modifications, which the ingenuity and fancy
of performers have introduced into this dance; but this account must
suffice.

Given a demand for a *pas seul*, some pleasing dance combining grace
with dexterity, a shake of the foot, a twist of the body, and a wave of
the hands, the hula ku’i filled the bill to perfection. The very fact
that it belonged by name to the genus hula, giving it, as it were, the
smack of forbidden fruit, only added to its attractiveness. It became
all the rage among dancing folk, attaining such a vogue as almost to
cause a panic among the tribunes and censors of society. Even to one who
cares nothing for the hula per se, save as it might be a spectacle out
of old Hawaii, or a setting for an old-time song, the innocent grace and
Delsartian flexibility of this solo dance, which one can not find in its
Keltic or African congeners, associate it in mind with the joy and
light-heartedness of man's Arcadian period.

The instruments generally used in the musical accompaniment of the hula
ku’i are the guitar, the *uku-lele*, <span
id="fr_515"></span>[a](#fn_499.md) the taro-patch fiddle, or the mandolin;
the piano also lends itself effectively for this purpose; or a
combination of these may be used.

The songs that are sung to this dance as a rule belong naturally to
later productions of the Hawaiian muse, or to modifications of old
poetical compositions. The following mele was originally a name-song
(mele-inoa). It was appropriated by the late Princess Kino-iki; and by
her it was passed on to Kalani-ana-ole, a fact which should not
prejudice our appreciation of its beauty.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

How pleasing, when borne by the tide,  
One says, you and I are a-cold.  
The buds of the center are chilled  
Of the woman who shivers on shore.  
5 I stood on the height Poli-ahu;  
The ocean enrobed Wai-lua.  
Ah, strange are the pranks of the wind,  
The Kiu-ke’e wind of the pali!  
It smites now the ocean at Puna--  
10 That's always the fashion at Puna.  
Gone, gone is the last of my love,  
At this mixture of brine in my drink!  
My mouth is a-thirst for a draught  
Of the cold mountain-water,  
15 That plays at the foot of the cliff,  
In the shade of the kui-kui tree.  
I thought our love-flower, ilima--  
Oft worn as a garland by you--  
Still held its color most true.  
20 You'd exchange its beauty for rue!

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Fame trumpets your conquests each day,  
Brave Lily Victoria!  
Your scepter finds new hearts to sway,  
Subdues the Pacific's wild waves,  
5 Your foes are left stranded ashore,  
Firm heart as of steel!  
Dame Rumor tells us with glee  
Your fortunes wax evermore,  
Beauty of Aina-hau,  
10 Comrade dear to my heart.  
And what of the hyacinth maid,  
Nymph of the Flowery Land?  
I choose the lehua, ilima,  
As my wreath and emblem of love,  
15 The small-leafed fern and the maile--  
What fragrance exhales from thy breast!

</div>

The story that might explain this modern lyric belongs to the gossip of
half a century ago. The action hinges about one who is styled Pua
Lanakila--literally Flower of Victory. Now there is no flower,
indigenous or imported, known by this name to the Hawaiians. It is an
allegorical invention of the poet. A study of the name and of its
interpretation, Victory, at once suggested to me the probability that it
was meant for the Princess Victoria Kamamalu.

As I interpret the story, the lover seems at first to be in a condition
of unstable equilibrium, but finally concludes to cleave to the flowers
of the soil, the *lehua* and the *ilima* (verse 15), the *palai* and the
*maile* (verse 17), the meaning of which is clear.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_499"></span>[251:a](ulh43.htm#fr_515.md) The *uku-lele* and
the *taro-patch fiddle* are stringed instruments resembling in general
appearance the fiddle. They seem to have been introduced into these
islands by the Portuguese immigrants who have come in within the last
twenty-five years. As with the guitar, the four strings of the uku-lele
or the five strings of the taro-patch fiddle are plucked with the finger
or thumb.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[251:b](ulh43.htm#fr_516.md) *Na pua o ka laina*.
The intent of this expression, which seems to have an erotic meaning,
may perhaps be inferred from its literal rendering in the translation.
It requires a tropical imagination to follow a Hawaiian poem.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[251:c](ulh43.htm#fr_517.md) *Poli-ahu*. A place
or region on Mauna-kea.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[251:d](ulh43.htm#fr_518.md) *Kiu-ke’e*. The name
of a wind felt at Nawiliwili, Kauai. The local names for winds differed
on the various islands and were multiplied almost without measure; as
given in the mythical story of Kama-pua’a, or in the semihistoric tale
of Kú-a-Paka’a, they taxed the memories of raconteurs.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[252:a](ulh43.htm#fr_519.md) *Kui-kui*. The older
name-form of the tree (Aleurites triloba), popularly known by some as
the candle-nut tree, from the fact that its oily nuts were used in
making torches. *Kukui*, or *tutui*, is the name now applied to the
tree, also to a torch or lamp. The Samoan language still retains the
archaic name *tuitui*. This is one of the few instances in which the
original etymology of a word is retained in Hawaiian poetry.
