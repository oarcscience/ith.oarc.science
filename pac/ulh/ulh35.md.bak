# XXXI.--THE HULA MANÓ

The hula *manó*, shark-dance, as its name signifies, was a performance
that takes class with the hula kolea, already mentioned, as one of the
animal dances. But little can be said about the physical features of
this hula as a dance, save that the performers took a sitting position,
that the action was without sensationalism, and that there was no
instrumental accompaniment. The cantillation of the mele was in the
distinct and quiet tone and manner which the Hawaiians termed
ko’i-honua.

The last and only mention found of its performance in modern times was
in the year 1847, during the tour, previously mentioned, which
Kamehameha III made about Oahu. The place was the lonely and romantic
valley of Waimea, a name already historic from having been the scene of
the tragic death of Lieutenant Hergest (of the ship *Dædalus*) in 1792.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Alas! I am seized by the shark, great shark!  
Lala-kea with triple-banked teeth.  
The stratum of Lono is gone,  
Torn up by the monster shark,  
5 Niuhi with fiery eyes,  
That flamed in the deep blue sea.  
Alas! and alas!  
When flowers the wili-wili tree,  
That is the time when the shark-god bites.  
10 Alas! I am seized by the huge shark!  
O blue sea, O dark sea,  
Foam-mottled sea of Kane!  
What pleasure I took in my dancing!  
Alas! now consumed by the monster shark!

</div>

Who would imagine that a Hawaiian would ever picture the god of love as
a shark? As a bird, yes; but as a shark! What a light this fierce idyl
casts on the imagination of the people of ancient Hawaii!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_416"></span>[221:a](ulh35.htm#fr_432.md) *Lala-kea*. This
proper name, as it seems once to have been, has now become rather the
designation of a whole class of man-eating sea-monsters. The Hawaiians
worshiped individual sharks as demigods, in the belief that the souls of
the departed at death, or even before death, sometimes entered and took
possession of them, and that they at times resumed human form. To this
class belonged the famous shark Niuhi (verse 5).

<span id="fn_417"></span>[221:b](ulh35.htm#fr_433.md) Papa-ku o Lono. This
was one of the underlying strata of the earth that must be passed before
reaching *Milu*, the hades of the Hawaiians. The cosmogony of the
southern Polynesians, according to Mr. Tregear, recognized ten papa, or
divisions. "The first division was the earth's surface; the second was
the abode of Rongo-ma-tane and Haumiatiketike; \* \* \* the tenth was
Meto, or Ameto, or Aweto, wherein the soul of man found utter
extinction." (The Maori-Polynesian Comparative Dictionary, by Edward
Tregear, F. R. G. S., etc., Wellington, New Zealand, 1891.)

<span id="fn_418"></span>[221:c](ulh35.htm#fr_434.md) Verses 8 and 9 are
from an old proverb which the Hawaiians put into the following quatrain:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A pua ka wiliwili,  
A nanahu ka manó:  
A pua ka wahine u’i,  
A nanahu ke kanawai.

</div>

\[Translation\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When flowers the wiliwili,  
Then bites the shark;  
When flowers a young woman,  
Then bites the law.

</div>

The people came to take this old saw seriously and literally, and during
the season when the wiliwili (Erythrina monosperma) was clothed in its
splendid tufts of brick-red. mothers kept their children from swimming
into the deep sea by setting before them the terrors of the shark.
