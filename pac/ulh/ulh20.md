# XVI.--THE HULA ÍLI-ÍLI

The hula *íli-íli*, pebble-dance, was a performance of the classical
times, in which, according to one who has witnessed it, the olapa alone
took part. The dancers held in each hand a couple of pebbles, *ili-ili*,
hence the name of the dance--which they managed to clash against each
other, after the fashion of castanets, thus producing a rude music of
much the same quality as that elicited from the "bones" in our minstrel
performances. According to another witness, the drum also was sometimes
used in connection with the pebbles as an accompaniment to this hula.

The ili-ili was at times a hula of intensity--that is to say, was acted
with that stress of voice and manner which the Hawaiians termed
*ai-ha’a*; but it seems to have been more often performed in that quiet
natural tone of voice and of manner termed *ko’i-honua*, which may be
likened to utterance in low relief.

The author can present only the fragment of a song to illustrate this
hula:

*Mele*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A lalo maua o Wai-pi’o,  
Ike i ka nani o Hi’i-lawe.  
E lawe mai a oki  
I na hala o Naue i ke kai,  
5 I na lehua lu-lu’u pali;  
Noho ana lohe i ke kani o ka o-ó,  
Hoolono aku i ka leo o ke kahuli.

</div>

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

We twain were lodged in Wai-pi’o,  
Beheld Hi’i-lawe, the grand.  
We brought and cut for our love-wreath  
The rich hala drupe from Naue's strand,  
5 Tufted lehua that waves on the cliff;  
Then sat and gave ear to song of o-ó,  
Or harked the chirp of the tree-shell.

*Wai-pi’o*, the scene of this idyl, is a valley deep and broad which the
elements have scooped out in the windward exposure of Hawaii, and scarce
needs mention to Hawaiian tourists. *Hi’i-lawe* is one of

several high waterfalls that leap from the world of clouds into the
valley-basin.

*Kahuli* is a fanciful name applied to the beautiful and unique genus of
tree-shells (Achatinella), [plate XII](#img_pl12.md), that inhabit the
Hawaiian woods. The natives are persuaded that these shells have the
power of chirping a song of their own, and the writer has often heard
the note which they ascribe to them; but to his ear it was
indistinguishable from the piping of the cricket. This is the song that
the natives credit to the tree-shells:

*Mele*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Kahuli aku,  
Kahuli mai,  
Kahuli lei ula,  
Lei akolea. <span id="fr_258"></span>[a](#fn_254.md)

*Song of the Tree-shell*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Trill a-far,  
Trill a-near,  
A dainty song wreath,  
Wreath akolea.  
5 Kolea, Kolea,  
Fetch me some dew,  
Dew from pink akolea.

</div>

This little piece of rustic imagination is said to have been used in the
hula, but in connection with what dance the author has not been able to
learn.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_254"></span>[121:a](ulh20.htm#fr_258.md) The *akolea* is a
fern (by some classed as a Polypodium) which, according to Doctor
Hillebrand (Flora of the Hawaiian Islands), "sustains its extraordinary
length by the circinnate tips which twine round the branches of
neighboring shrubs or trees."
