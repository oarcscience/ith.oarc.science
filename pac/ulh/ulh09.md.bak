# V.--CEREMONIES OF GRADUATION; DÉBUT OF A HULA DANCER

### CEREMONIES OF GRADUATION

The *ai-lolo* rite and ceremony marked the consummation of a pupil's
readiness for graduation from the school of the halau and his formal
entrance into the guild of hula dancers. As the time drew near, the kumu
tightened the reins of discipline, and for a few days before that event
no pupil might leave the halau save for the most stringent necessity,
and then only with the head muffled (*pulo’u*) to avoid recognition, and
he might engage in no conversation whatever outside the halau.

The night preceding the day of ai-lolo was devoted to special services
of dance and song. Some time after midnight the whole company went forth
to plunge into the ocean, thus to purge themselves of any lurking
ceremonial impurity. The progress to the ocean and the return they made
in complete nudity. "Nakedness is the garb of the gods." On their way to
and from the bath they must not look back, they must not turn to the
right hand or to the left.

The kumu, as the priest, remained at the halau, and as the procession
returned from the ocean he met it at the door and sprinkled each one
(*pikai*) with holy water. Then came another period of dance and song;
and then, having cantillated a *pule hoonoa*, to lift the tabu, the kumu
went forth to his own ceremonial cleansing bath in the sea. During his
absence his deputy, the *kokua kumu*, took charge of the halau. When the
kumu reached the door on his return, he made himself known by reciting a
*mele wehe puka*, the conventional password.

Still another exercise of song and dance, and the wearied pupils are
glad to seek repose. Some will not even remove the short dancing skirts
that are girded about them, so eager are they to snatch an hour of rest;
and some lie down with bracelets and anklets yet unclasped.

At daybreak the kumu rouses the company with the tap of the drum. After
ablutions, before partaking of their simple breakfast, the company stand
before the altar and recite a tabu-removing prayer, accompanying the
cantillation with a rhythmic tapping of feet and clapping of hands:

*Pule Hoonoa*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Pupu we’uwe’u e, Laka e!  
O kona we’uwe’u ke ku nei. <span id="page_32">p. 32</span>  
Kaumaha a’e la ia Laka.  
O Laka ke akua pule ikaika.  
5 Ua ku ka maile a Laka a imua;  
Ua lu ka hua <span id="fr_32"></span>[a](#fn_31.md) o ka maile.  
Noa, noa ia’u, ia Kahaula--  
Papalua noa.  
Noa, a ua noa.  
10 Eli-eli kapu! eli-eli noa!  
Kapu oukou, ke akua!  
Noa makou, ke kanaka´.

</div>

\[Translation\]

*Tabu-lifting Prayer*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Oh wildwood bouquet, oh Laka!  
Hers are the growths that stand here.  
Suppliants we to Laka.  
The prayer to Laka has power;  
5 The maile of Laka stands to the fore.  
The maile vine casts now its seeds.  
Freedom, there's freedom to me, Kahaula--  
A freedom twofold.  
10 Freedom, aye freedom!  
A tabu profound, a freedom complete.  
Ye gods are still tabu;  
We mortals are free.

</div>

At the much-needed repast to which the company now sit down there may be
present a gathering of friends and relatives and of hula experts, called
*olóhe*. Soon the porkling chosen to be the *ai-lólo* offering is
brought in--a black suckling without spot or blemish. The kumu holds it
down while all the pupils gather and lay their hands upon his hands; and
he expounds to them the significance of the ceremony. If they consecrate
themselves to the work in hand in sincerity and with true hearts, memory
will be strong and the training, the knowledge, and the songs that have
been intrusted to the memory will stay. If they are heedless, regardless
of their vows, the songs they have learned will fly away.

The ceremony is long and impressive; many songs are used. Sometimes, it
was claimed, the prayers of the kumu at this laying on of hands availed
to cause the death of the little animal. On the completion of the
ceremony the offering is taken out and made ready for the oven.

One of the first duties of the day is the dismantling of the old kuahu,
the shrine, and the construction of another from new materials as a
residence for the goddess. While night yet shadows the earth the
attendants and friends of the pupils have gone up into the

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

mountains to collect the material for the new shrine. The rustic
artists, while engaged in this loving work of building and weaving the
new kuahu, cheer and inspire one another with joyful songs vociferous
with the praise of Laka. The halau also they decorate afresh, strewing
the floor with clean rushes, until the whole place enthralls the senses
like a bright and fragrant temple.

The kumu now grants special dispensation to the, pupils to go forth that
they may make good the results of the neglect of the person incident to
long confinement in the halau. For days, for weeks, perhaps for months,
they have not had full opportunity to trim hair, nails, or heard, to
anoint and groom themselves. They use this short absence from the hall
also to supply themselves with wreaths of fragrant maile, crocus-yellow
ilima, scarlet-flaming lehua, fern, and what not.

At the appointed hour the pupils, wreathed and attired like nymphs and
dryads, assemble in the halau, sweet with woodsy perfumes. At the door
they receive aspersion with consecrated water.

The ai-lolo offering, cooked to a turn--no part raw, no part cracked or
scorched--is brought in from the *imu*, its bearer sprinkled by the
guard at the entrance. The kumu, having inspected the roast offering and
having declared it ceremonially perfect, gives the signal, and the
company break forth in songs of joy and of adulation to goddess Laka:

*Mele Kuahu*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Noho ana Laka i ka ulu wehi-wehi,  
Ku ana iluna i Mo’o-helaia, <span id="fr_33"></span>[a](#fn_32.md)  
Ohia-Ku <span id="fr_34"></span>[b](#fn_33.md) iluna o Mauna-loa. <span
id="fr_35"></span>[c](#fn_34.md)  
Aloha mai Kaulana-ula <span id="fr_36"></span>[d](#fn_35.md) ia’u.  
5 Eia ka ula la, he ula leo, <span id="fr_37"></span>[e](#fn_36.md)  
He uku, he modai, he kanaenae,  
He alana na’u ia oe.  
E Laka e, e maliu mai;  
E maliu mai oe, i pono au,  
10 A pono au, a pono kaua.

</div>

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

\[Translation\]

*Altar-Prayer*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Laka sits in her shady grove,  
Stands on her terrace, at Mo’o-helaia;  
Like the tree of God Ku on Mauna-loa.  
Kaulana-ula trills in my ear;  
5 A whispered suggestion to me,  
Lo, an offering, a payment,  
A eulogy give I to thee.  
O Laka, incline to me!  
Have compassion, let it be well--  
10 Well with me, well with us both.

</div>

There is no stint of prayer-song. While the offering rests on the kuahu,
the joyful service continues:

*Mele Kuahu*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

E Laka, e!  
Pupu we’uwe’u e, Laka e!  
E Laka i ka leo;  
E laka i ka loaa:  
5 E Laka i ka waiwai;  
E Laka i na mea a pau!

</div>

\[Translation\]

*Altar-Prayer*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

O goddess Laka!  
O wildwood bouquet, O Laka!  
O Laka, queen of the voice!  
O Laka, giver of gifts!  
5 O Laka, giver of bounty!  
O Laka, giver of all things!

</div>

At the conclusion of this loving service of worship and song each member
of the troupe removes from his head and neck the wreaths that had
bedecked him, and with them crowns the image of the goddess until her
altar is heaped with the offerings.

Now comes the pith of the ceremony: the novitiates sit down to the feast
of ai-lolo, theirs the place of honor, at the head of the table, next
the kuahu. The *ho’o-pa’a*, acting as carver, selects the typical
parts--snout, ear-tips, tail, feet, portions of the vital organs,
especially the brain (*lolo*). This last it is which gives name to the
ceremony. He sets an equal portion before each novitiate. Each one must
eat all that is set before him. It is a mystical rite, a sacrament; as
he eats he consciously partakes of the virtue of the goddess that is
transmitted to himself.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

Meantime the *olohe* and friends of the novitiates, inspired with the
proper enthusiasm of the occasion, lift their voices in joyful
cantillations, in honor of the goddess, accompanied with the clapping of
hands.

The ceremony now reaches a new stage. The kumu lifts the tabu by
uttering a prayer--always a song--and declares the place and the feast
free, and the whole assembly sit down to enjoy the bounty that is spread
up and down the halau. On this occasion men and women may eat in common.
The only articles excluded from this feast are *luau*--a food much like
spinach, made by cooking the young and delicate taro leaf--and the drupe
of the *hala*, the pandanus ([pl. XVIII](ulh25.htm#img_pl18).md).

The company sit down to eat and to drink; presently they rise to dance
and sing. The kumu leads in a tabu-lifting, freedom-giving song and the
ceremony of ai-lolo is over. The pupils have been graduated from the
school of the halau; they are now members of the great guild of hula
dancers. The time has come for them to make their bow to the waiting
public outside, to bid for the favor of the world. This is to be their
"little go;" they will spread their wings for a greater flight on the
morrow.

The kumu with his big drum, and the musicians, the ho’o-pa’a, pass
through the door and take their places outside in the lanai, where sit
the waiting multitude. At the tap of the drum the group of waiting olapa
plume themselves like fine birds eager to show their feathers; and, as
they pass out the halau door and present themselves to the breathless
audience, into every pose and motion of their gliding, swaying figures
they pour a full tide of emotion in studied and unstudied effort to
captivate the public.

### DÉBUT OF A HULA DANCER

The occasion is that of a lifetime; it is their *uniki*, their début.
The song chosen must rise to the dignity of the occasion. Let us listen
to the song that enthralls the audience seated in the rush-strown lanai,
that we may judge of its worthiness.

*A Name-Song, a Eulogy* (for Naihe)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The huge roller, roller that surges from Kona,  
Makes loin-cloth fit for a lord;  
Far-reaching swell, my malo streams in the wind:  
Shape the crescent malo to the loins--  
5 The loin-cloth the sea, cloth for king's girding.  
Stand, gird fast the loin-cloth!

</div>

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Let the sun guide the board Halepó,  
Till Halepó lifts on the swell.  
It mounts the swell that rolls from Kahiki,  
10 From Wakea's age onrolling.  
The roller plumes and ruffles its crest.

Here comes the champion surf-man,  
While wave-ridden wave beats the island,  
A fringe of mountain-high waves.  
15 Spume lashes the Hiki-au altar--  
A surf this to ride at noontide.

The coral, horned coral, it sweeps far ashore.  
We gaze at the surf of Ka-kuhi-hewa.  
The surf-board snags, is shivered;  
20 Maui splits with a crash,  
Trembles, dissolves into slime.

Glossy the skin of the surf-man;  
Undrenched the skin of the expert;  
Wave-feathers fan the wave-rider.  
25 You've seen the grand surf of Puna, of Hilo.

</div>

This spirited song, while not a full description of a surf-riding scene,
gives a vivid picture of that noble sport. The last nine verses have
been omitted, as they add neither to the action nor to the interest.

It seems surprising that the accident spoken of in line 19 should be
mentioned; for it is in glaring opposition to the canons that were
usually observed in the composition of a *mele-inoa*. In the
construction of a eulogy the Hawaiians were not only punctiliously
careful to avoid mention of anything susceptible of sinister
interpretation, but they were superstitiously sensitive to any such
unintentional happening. As already mentioned ([p.
27](ulh08.htm#page_27).md), they believed that the fate-compelling power of
a word of ill-omen was inevitable. If it did not result in the death of
the one eulogized, retributive justice turned the evil influence back on
him who uttered it.
