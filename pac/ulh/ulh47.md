# GLOSSARY

The study of Hawaiian pronunciation is mainly a study of vowel sounds
and of accent. Each written vowel represents at least two related
sounds.

A (*ah*) has the Italian sound found in father, as in h*a*-le or in
L*a*-ka; also a short sound like that of a in li*a*ble, as in
ke-*a*-ke-*a*, to contradict, or in *a*-ha, an assembly.

E (*a*) has the sound of long a in f*a*te, or of e in pr*e*y, without
the i-glide that follows, as in the first syllable of P*é*-le, or of
m*é*-a, a thing; also the short sound of e in n*e*t, as in *é*-ha, hurt,
or in p*é*a, a sail.

I (*ee*) has the long sound of i in p*i*que, or in pol*i*ce, as in
*i*-li, skin, or in h*í*-la-h*í*-la, shame; also the short sound of i in
h*i*ll, as in l*í*-hi, border, and in *í*-ki, small.

O (*oh*) has the long sound of o in n*o*te or in *o*ld, without the
u-glide, as in l*ó*-a, long, or as in the first syllable of L*ó*-no;
also a short sound, which approximates to that sometimes erroneously
given to the vowel in c*o*at, as in p*ó*-po, rotten, or as in l*ó*-ko, a
lake.

U (*oo*) has the long sound of u in r*u*le, as in *hú*-la, to dance; and
a short sound approximating to that of u in f*u*ll, as in m*ú*-ku, cut
off.

Every Hawaiian syllable ends in a vowel. No attempt has been made to
indicate these differences of vowel sound. The only diacritical marks
here employed are the acute accent for stressed syllables and the
apostrophe between two vowels to indicate the glottic closure or
interruption of sound (improperly sometimes called a guttural) that
prevents the two from coalescing.

In the seven diphthongs *ae*, *ai*, *ao*, *au*, *ei*, *ia*, and *ua* a
delicate ear will not fail to detect a coalescence of at least two
sounds, thus proving them not to be mere digraphs.

In animated description or pathetic narrative, or in the effort to
convey the idea of length, or height, or depth, or immensity, the
Hawaiian had a way of prolonging the vowel sounds of a word, as if by so
doing he could intimate the amplitude of his thought.

The letter w (*way*) represents two sounds, corresponding to our w and
our v. At the beginning of a word it has the sound of w (*way*),
retaining this even when the word has become compounded. This is
illustrated in *W*ái-a-lú-a (geographical name), and *w*á-ha mouth. In
the middle of a word, or after the first syllable, it

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

almost always has the sound of v (*vay*), as in hé-*w*a (wrong), and in
E-*w*á (geographical name). In há-*w*a-*w*á (awkward), the compound word
ha-*w*ái (water-pipe), and several others the w takes the *way* sound.

The great majority of Hawaiian words are accented on the penult, and in
simple words of four or more syllables there is, as a rule, an accent on
the fourth and on the sixth syllables, counting back from the final
syllable, as in lá-na-kí-la (victorious) and as in hó-o-kó-lo-kó-lo (to
try at law).
