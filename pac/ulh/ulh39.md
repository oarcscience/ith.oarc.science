# XXXV.--THE HULA KILU

The hula *kilu* was so called from being used in a sport bearing that
name which was much patronized by the alii class of the ancient régime.
It was a betting game, or, more strictly, forfeits were pledged, the
payment of which was met by the performance of a dance, or by the
exaction of kisses and embraces. The satisfaction of these forfeits not
unfrequently called for liberties and concessions that could not be
permitted on the spot or in public, but must wait the opportunity of
seclusion. There were, no doubt, times when the conduct of the game was
carried to such a pitch of license as to offend decency; but as a rule
the outward proprieties were seemingly as well regarded as at an
old-fashioned husking bee, when the finding of the "red ear" conferred
or imposed the privilege or penalty of exacting or granting the blushing
tribute of a kiss. Actual improprieties were not witnessed.

The game of *kilu* was played in an open matted space that lay between
the two divisions of the audience--the women being on one side and the
men on the other. Any chief of recognized rank in the *papa alii* was
permitted to join in the game; and kings and queens were not above
participating in the pleasures of this sport. Once admitted to the hall
or inclosure, all were peers and stood on an equal footing as to the
rules and privileges of the game. King nor queen could plead exemption
from the forfeits incurred nor deny to another the full exercise of
privileges acquired under the rules.

The players, five or more of each sex, having been selected by the
president, La *anoano* ("quiet day"), sat facing each other in the space
between the spectators. In front of each player stood a conical block of
heavy wood, broad at the base to keep it upright. The kilu, with which
the game was played, was an oval, one-sided dish, made by cutting in two
an egg-shaped coconut shell. The object of the player was to throw his
kilu so that it should travel with a sliding and at the same time a
rotary motion across the matted floor and hit the wooden block which
stood before the one of his choice on the side opposite. The men and the
women took turns in playing. A successful hit entitled the player to
claim a kiss from his opponent, a toll which was exacted at once.
Success in winning ten points made one the victor in the game, and,
according to some, entitled him to claim the larger forfeit, such as was
customary in the democratic

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

game of *ume*. The payment of these extreme forfeits was delayed till a
convenient season, or might be commuted--on grounds of policy, or at the
request of the loser, if a king or queen--by an equivalent of land or
other valuable possession. Still no fault could be found if the winner
insisted on the strict payment of the forfeit.

The game of kilu was often got up as a compliment, a supreme expression
of hospitality, to distinguished visitors of rank, thus more than making
good the polite phrase of the Spanish don, "all that I have is yours."

The fact that the hula kilu was performed by the alii class, who took
great pains and by assiduous practice made themselves proficient that
they might be ready to exhibit their accomplishment before the public,
was a guarantee that this hula, when performed by them, would be of more
than usual grace and vivacity. When performed in the halau as a tabu
dance, according to some, the olapa alone took part, and the number of
dancers, never very large, was at times limited to one performer.
Authorities differ as to whether any musical instrument was used as an
accompaniment. From an allusion to this dance met with in an old story
it is quite certain that the drum was sometimes used as an
accompaniment.

Let us picture to ourselves the scene: A shadowy, flower-scented hall;
the elite of some Hawaiian court and their guests, gathered, in accord
with old-time practice, to contend in a tournament of wit and grace and
skill, vying with one another for the prize of beauty. The president has
established order in the assembly; the opposing players have taken their
stations, each one seated behind his target-block. The tallykeeper of
one side now makes the challenge. "This kilu," says he, "is a love
token; the forfeit a kiss." An Apollo of the opposite side joyfully
takes up the gauge. His tallykeeper introduces him by name. He plumes
himself like a wild bird of gay feather, standing forth in the decorous
finery of his rank, girded and flower-bedecked after the manner of the
halau, eager to win applause for his party not less than to secure for
himself the loving reward of victory. In his hand is the instrument of
the play, the kilu; the artillery of love, however, with which he is to
assail the heart and warm the imagination of the fair woman opposed to
him is the song he shoots from his lips.

The story of the two songs next to be presented is one, and will show us
a side of Hawaiian life on which we can not afford entirely to close our
eyes. During the stay at Lahaina of Kamehameha, called the Great--whom
an informant in this matter always calls "the murderer," in protest
against the treacherous assassination of Keoua, which took place at
Kawaihae in Kamehameha's very presence--a high chiefess of his court
named Kalola engaged in a love affair with a young man of rank named
Ka’i-áma. He was

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

much her junior, but this did not prevent his infatuation. Early one
morning she rose, leaving him sound asleep, and took canoe for Molokai
to serve as one of the escort to the body of her relative, Keola, on the
way to its place of sepulture.

Some woman, appreciating the situation, posted to the house and waked
the sleeper with the information. Ka’iáma hastened to the shore, and as
he strained his vision to gain sight of the woman of his infatuation the
men at the paddles and the bristling throng on the central platform--the
*pola*---of the craft, vanishing in the twilight, made on his
imagination the impression of a hazy mountain thicket floating on the
waves, but hiding from view some rare flower. He gave vent to his
feelings in song:

The rhythmic dip and swing on to Wailua.  
My call to the witch shall fly with the breeze,

The unchivalrous indiscretion of the youth in publishing the secret of
his amour elicited from Kamehameha only the sarcastic remark, "Couldn't
he eat his food and keep his mouth shut?" The lady herself took the same
view of his action. There was no evasion in her reply; her only reproach
was for his childishness in blabbing.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The sun-furrow gleams at the back of Lehua;  
The King's had his fill of scandal and chaff;  
The wind-god empties his lungs with a laugh;  
And the Mikioi tosses the sea at Lehua,  
5 As the trade-wind wafts his friend on her way--  
A congress of airs that ruffles the bay.  
Hide love 'neath a mask--that's all I would ask.  
To spill but a tear makes our love-tale appear;  
He pours out his woe; I've seen it, I know;  
10 That's the way with a boy-friend, heigh-ho!

The art of translating from the Hawaiian into the English tongue
consists largely in a fitting substitution of generic for specific
terms. The Hawaiian, for instance, had at command scores of specific
names for the same wind, or for the local modifications that were
inflicted

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

upon it by the features of the landscape. One might almost say that
every cape and headland imposed a new nomenclature upon the breeze whose
direction it influenced. He rarely contented himself with using a broad
and comprehensive term when he could match the situation with special
form.

The singer restricts her blame to charging her youthful lover with an
indiscreet exhibition of childish emotion. The mere display of emotion
evinced by the shedding of tears was in itself a laudable action and in
good form.

This first reply of the woman to her youthful lover did not by any means
exhaust her armament of retaliation. When she next treats of the affair
it is with an added touch of sarcasm and yet with a sang frond that
proved it had not unsettled her nerves.

Red glows Kala’e through the wind-blown dust

To return to the description of the game, the player, having uttered his
vaunt in true knightly fashion, with a dexterous whirl now sends his
kilu spinning on its course. If his play is successful and the kilu
strikes the target on the other side at which he aims, the

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

audience, who have kept silence till now, break forth in applause, and
his tally-keeper proclaims his success in boastful fashion:

*Oli*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A úweuwé ke kó'e a ke kae;  
Puehuehu ka la, komo inoino;

\[Translation\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now wriggles the worm to its goal;  
A tousling; a hasty encounter;  
A grapple; down falls the rain.

</div>

It is now the winner's right to cross over and claim his forfeit. The
audience deals out applause or derision in unstinted pleasure; the
enthusiasm reaches fever-point when some one makes himself the champion
of the game by bringing his score up to ten, the limit. The play is
often kept up till morning, to be resumed the following night. <span

Here also is a mele, which tradition reports to have been cantillated by
Hiiaka, the sister of Pele, during her famous kilu contest with the
Princess Pele-ula, which took place at Kou--the ancient name for
Honolulu--on Hiiaka's voyage of return from Kauai to her sister's court
at Kilauea. In this affair Lohiau and Wahine-oma’o contended on the side
of Hiiaka, while Pele-ula, was assisted by her husband, Kou, and by
other experts. But on this occasion the dice were cogged; the victory
was won not by human skill but by the magical power of Hiiaka, who
turned Pele-ula's kilu away from the target each time she threw it, but
used her gift to compel it to the mark when the kilu was cast by
herself.

</div>

This is but a fragment of the song which Hiiaka pours out in her efforts
to calm the fateful storm which she saw piling up along the horizon. The
situation was tragic. Hiiaka, daring fate, defying the dragons and
monsters of the primeval world, had made the journey to Kauai, had
snatched away from death the life of Lohiau and with incredible
self-denial was escorting the rare youth to the arms of her sister,
whose jealousy she knew to be quick as the lightning, her vengeance hot
as the breath of the volcano, and now she saw this feather-head, with
monstrous ingratitude, dallying with fate, calling down upon the whole
party the doom she alone could appreciate, all for the smile of a siren
whose charms attracted him for the moment; but, worst of all, her heart
condemned her as a traitress--she loved him.

Hiiaka held the trick-card and she won; by her miraculous power she kept
the game in her own hands and foiled the hopes of the lovers.

The scene of this idyl is laid in the district of Waialua, Oahu, but the
poet gives his imagination free range regardless of the unities. The
chief subjects of interest that serve as a trellis about which the human
sentiments entwine concern the duties of the fisherman, who is also a
farmer; the school for the hula, in which the hero and the heroine are
pupils; and lastly an ideal condition of happiness which the lovers look
forward to under the benevolent dispensation of the gods Ku and Ahuena.

Among the numerous relatives of Pele was one said to be a sister, who
was stationed on a bleak sun-burnt promontory in Koolau, Oahu, where she
supported a half-starved existence, striving to hold soul and body
together by gathering the herbs of the fields, eked out by unsolicited
gifts of food contributed by passing travelers. The pathetic plaint
given below is ascribed to this goddess.

this region.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[241:c](ulh39.htm#fr_488) *Makahana-loa*. A
favorite fishing ground. The word *ilikai* ("skin of the sea")
graphically depicts the calm of the region. In the translation the name

<span id="fn_473"></span>[241:d](ulh39.htm#fr_489) *Lihau*. A gentle
rain that was considered favorable to the work of the fisherman.

division of Waialua, here seemingly used to mean the farm.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[241:f](ulh39.htm#fr_491) *Uahi pohina*.
Literally gray-headed smoke. It is said that when studying together the
words of the mele the pupils and the kumu would often gather about a

of the mountain," Mount Kaala.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[242:e](ulh39.htm#fr_496) *Hale-mano*.
Literally the multitude of houses: a sylvan region bound to the south
western flank of the Konahuanni range of mountains, a region of legend
and romance, since the coming of the white mau given over to the ravage
and desolation that follow the free-ranging of cattle and horses, the
vaquero, and the abusive use of fire and ax by the woodman.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[242:f](ulh39.htm#fr_497) *I'a ku o ka aina*.
Fish common to a region; in this place it was probably the kala, which

Waimea, Oahu, stood two rocks on the opposite bluffs that sentineled the
bay. These rocks were said to represent respectively the gods Ku and
Ahuena, patrons of the local fishermen.
