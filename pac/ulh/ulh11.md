# VII.--WORSHIP AT THE ALTAR OF THE HALAU

The first duty of a visitor on being admitted to the halau while the
tabu was on--that is, during the conduct of a regular hula--was to do
reverence at the kuahu. The obligations of religion took precedence of
all social etiquette. He reverently approaches the altar, to which all
eyes are turned, and with outstretched hands pours out a supplication
that breathes the aroma of ancient prayer:

*Pule Kuahu* (no Laka)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

O Laka oe,  
O ke akua i ke a’a-lii  <span id="fr_64"></span>[a](#fn_63) nui.  
O Laka mai uka!  
E Laka mai kai!  
5 O hoo-ulu <span id="fr_65"></span>[b](#fn_64) o Lono,  
O ka ilio nana e haehae ke aha,  
O ka ie-ie ku i ka wao,  
O ka maile hihi i ka nahele,

10 O na ku’i <span id="fr_67"></span>[d](#fn_66) o Hauoli,  
O Ha’i-ka-malama, <span id="fr_68"></span>[e](#fn_67)  
Wahine o Kina’u. <span id="fr_69"></span>[f](#fn_68)  
Kapo ula <span id="fr_70"></span>[g](#fn_69) o Kina’u.  
O Laka oe,  
15 O ke akua i ke kuahu nei la, e!  
E ho’i, e ho’i a noho i kou kuahu.  
Hoo-ulu ia!

</div>

\[Translation\]

*Altar-Prayer* (to Laka)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Thou art Laka,  
God of the deep-rooted a’a-lii.  
O Laka from the mountains,  
O Laka from the ocean!

</div>

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

5 Let Lono bless the service,  
Shutting the mouth of the dog,  
That breaks the charm with his barking.  
Bring the i-e that grows in the wilds.  
The maile that twines in the thicket,  
10 Red-beaked kiele, leaf of the goddess,  
The joyous pulse of the dance  
In honor of Ha’i-ka-malama,  
Friend of Kina’u,  
Red-robed friend of Kina’u.  
15 Thou art Laka,  
God of this altar here.  
Return, return and reside at your altar!  
Bring it good luck!

</div>

A single prayer may not suffice as the offering at Laka's altar. His
repertory is full; the visitor begins anew, this time on a different
tack:

*Pule Kuahu* (no Laka)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ela ke kuko, ka li’a;  
I ka manawa he hiamoe ko’u,  
Hoala ana oe,  
    Ooe o Halau-lani,

    O Puoho-lani,

Ku moho kiekie la i-uka.  
I-uka ho’i au me Laka

id="fr_72"></span>[b](#fn_71) i ka nahelehele;  
He hoa kaana ia no’u,  
No kela kuahiwi, kualono hoi.  
    E Laka, e Laka, e!  
E maliu mai!  
15 A maliu mai oe pono au,  
A a’e mai oe pono au!

</div>

\[Translation\]

*Altar-Prayer* (to Laka)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

This my wish, my burning desire,  
That in the season of slumber  
Thy spirit my soul may inspire,  
    Altar-dweller,  
5   Heaven-guest,  
    Soul-awakener,  
Bird from covert calling,  
Where forest champions stand.  
    There roamed I too with Laka,

</div>

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

10 Of Lea and Loa a wilderness-child;  
On ridge, in forest boon companion she  
To the heart that throbbed in me.  
    O Laka, O Laka,  
Hark to my call!  
15 You approach, it is well;  
You possess me, I am blest!

</div>

In the translation of this pule the author has found it necessary to
depart from the verse arrangement that obtains in the Hawaiian text.

The religious services of the halau, though inspired by one motive, were
not tied to a single ritual or to one set of prayers. Prayer marked the
beginning and the ending of every play--that is, of every dance--and of
every important event in the programme of the halau; but there were many
prayers from which the priest might select. After the prayer specially
addressed to Laka the visitor might use a petition of more general
scope. Such is the one now to be given:

*He Pule Kuahu* (ia Kane ame Kapo); *a he Pule Hoolei*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Kane, hiki a’e, he maláma <span id="fr_73"></span>[a](#fn_72) ia luna;  
Ha’aha’a, he maláma ia lalo;

Verses 9 to 15, inclusive, are almost identical in form with the first
seven verses in the Mele Kuahu addressed to Laka, given on page
[33](ulh09.htm#page_33).

\[Translation\]

*An Altar-Prayer* (to Kane and Kapo); *also a Garland-Prayer, used while
decorating the altar*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now, Kane, approach, illumine the altar;  
Stoop, and enlighten mortals below;  
Rejoice in the gifts I have brought.  
Wreathed goddess fostered by Kapo--  
5 Hail Kapo, of beauty resplendent!  
Great Kapo, of sea and land,  
The topmost stay of the net,  
Its lower stay and anchoring line.  
Kapo sits in her darksome covert;  
10 On the terrace, at Mo’o-he-laia,  
Stands the god-tree of Ku, on Mauna-loa.  
God Kaulana-ula twigs now mine ear,  
His whispered suggestion to me is  
This payment, sacrifice, offering,  
15 Tribute of praise to thee, O Kapo divine.  
Inspiring spirit in sleep, answer my call.  
Behold, of lehua bloom of Kaana  
The women are stringing enough  
To enwreath goddess Kapo;  
20 Kapo, great queen of that island,  
Of the high and the low.  
The day of revealing shall see what it sees:

</div>

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A seeing of facts, a sifting of rumors,  
An insight won by the black sacred awa,  
25 A vision like that of a god!  
O Kapo, return!  
Return and abide in your altar!  
Make it fruitful!  
Lo, here is the water,  
30 The water of life!  
Hail, now, to thee!

</div>

The little god-folk, whom the ancients called Kini Akua--myriads of
gods--and who made the wildwoods and wilderness their playground, must
also be placated. They were a lawless set of imps; the elfins, brownies,
and kobolds of our fairy world were not "up to them" in wanton deviltry.
If there is to be any luck in the house, it can only be when they are
dissuaded from outbreaking mischief.

The pule next given is a polite invitation to these little brown men of
the woods to honor the occasion with their presence and to bring good
luck at their coming. It is such a prayer as the visitor might choose to
repeat at this time, or it might be used on other occasions, as at the
consecration of the kuahu:

*He Pule Kuahu* (no Kini Akua)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

E ulu, e ulu, Kini o ke Akua  
Ulu Kane me Kanaloa!  
Ulu Ohi’a-lau-koa, me ka Ie-ie!  
A’e mai a noho i kou kuahu!  
5 Eia ka wai ia, he wai e ola.  
E ola no, e-e!

</div>

\[Translation\]

*An Altar-Prayer* (to the Kini Akua)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Gather, oh gather, ye hosts of godlings!  
Come Kane with Kanaloa!  
Come leafy Ohi’a and I-e!  
Possess me and dwell in your altar!  
5 Here's water, water of life!  
Life, give us life!

</div>

The visitor, having satisfied his sense of what the occasion demands,
changes his tone from that of cantillation to ordinary speech, and
concludes his worship with a petition conceived in the spirit of the
following prayer:

<span class="small">E ola ia’u, i ka malihini; a pela hoi na kamaaina,
ke kumu, na haumana, ia oe, e Laka. E Laka ia Pohaku i ka wawae. E Laka
i ke kupe’e. E Laka ia Luukia i ka pa-u; e Laka i ke kuhi; e Laka i ka
leo; e Laka i ka lei. E Laka i ke ku ana imua o ke anaina.</span>

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

\[Translation\]

Thy blessing, O Laka, on me the stranger, and on the residents, teacher
and pupils. O Laka, give grace to the feet of Pohaku; and to her
bracelets and anklets; comeliness to the figure and skirt of Luukia. To
(each one) give gesture and voice. O Laka, make beautiful the lei;
inspire the dancers when they stand before the assembly.

At the close of this service of song and prayer the visitor will turn
from the kuahu and exchange salutations and greetings with his friends
in the halau.

The song-prayer "Now, Kane, approach, illumine the altar" ([p.
45](#page_45)) calls for remark. It brings up again the question,
previously discussed, whether there were not two distinct cults of
worshipers, the one devoted to Laka, the other to Kapo. The following
facts will throw light on the question. On either side of the approach
to the altar stood, sentinel-like, a tall stem of hala-pepe, a graceful,
slender column, its head of green sword-leaves and scarlet drupes making
a beautiful picture. (See [p. 24](ulh07.htm#page_24).) These are said to
have been the special emblems of the goddess Kapo.

The following account of a conversation the author had with an old
woman, whose youthful days were spent as a hula dancer, will also help
to disentangle the subject and explain the relation of Kapo to the hula:

"Will you not recite again the prayer you just now uttered, and slowly,
that it may be written down?" the author asked of her. "Many prayers for
the kuahu have been collected, but this one differs from them all."

"We Hawaiians," she answered, "have been taught that, these matters are
sacred (*kapu*) and must not be bandied about from month to mouth."

"Aye, but the time of the tabus has passed. Then, too, in a sense having
been initiated into hula matters, there can be no impropriety in my
dealing with them in a kindly spirit."

"No harm, of course, will come to you, a *haole* (foreigner). The
question is how it will affect us."

"Tell me, were there two different classes of worshipers, one class
devoted to the worship of Laka and another class devoted to the worship
of Kapo?"

"No," she answered, "Kapo and Laka were one in spirit, though their
names were two."

"Haumea was the mother of Kapo. Who was her father?"

"Yes, Haumea was the mother, and Kua-ha-ilo <span
id="fr_86"></span>[a](#fn_85) was the father."

"How about Laka?"

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

"Laka was the daughter of Kapo. Yet as a patron of the hula Laka stands
first; she was worshiped at an earlier date than Kapo; but they are
really one."

Further questioning brought out the explanation that Laka was not
begotten in ordinary generation; she was a sort of emanation from Kapo.
It was as if the goddess should sneeze and a deity should issue with the
breath from her nostrils; or should wink, and thereby beget spiritual
offspring from the eye, or as if a spirit should issue forth at some
movement of the ear or mouth.

When the old woman's scruples had been laid to rest, she repeated slowly
for the author's benefit the pule given on pages [45](#page_45) and
[46](#page_46), "Now, Kane, approach," \* \* \* of which the first eight
lines and much of the last part, to him, were new.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_63"></span>[42:a](ulh11.htm#fr_64) *A’a-lii*. A deep-rooted
tree, sacred to Laka or to Kapo.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[42:b](ulh11.htm#fr_65) *Hoo-ulu*. Literally to
make grow; secondarily, to inspire, to prosper, to bring good luck. This
is the meaning most in mind in modern times, since the hula has become a
commercial venture.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[42:c](ulh11.htm#fr_66) *Ki-ele*. A flowering
plant native to the Hawaiian woods, also cultivated, sacred to Laka, and
perhaps to Kapo. The leaves are said to be pointed and curved like the
beak of the bird *i-iwi*, and the flower has the gorgeous yellow-red
color of that bird.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[42:d](ulh11.htm#fr_67) It has been proposed to
amend this verse by substituting *akua* for *ku’i*, thus making the idea
the gods of the hula.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[42:e](ulh11.htm#fr_68) *Ha’i-ka-malama*. An
epithet applied to Laka.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[42:f](ulh11.htm#fr_69) *Kina’u*. Said to mean
Hiiaka, the sister of Pele.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[42:g](ulh11.htm#fr_70) *Kapo ula*. Red, *ula*,
was the favorite color of Kapo. The *kahuna anaana*, high priests of
sorcery, of the black art, and of murder, to whom Kapo was at times
procuress, made themselves known as such by the display of a red flag
and the wearing of a red malo.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[43:a](ulh11.htm#fr_71) *Lea*. The same as Laia,
or probably Haumea.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[43:b](ulh11.htm#fr_72) *Wahie loa*. This must
be a mistake. Laka the son of Wahie-loa was a great voyager. His canoe
(*kau-méli-éli*) was built for him by the gods. In it he sailed to the
South to rescue his father's bones from the witch who had murdered him.
This Laka had his home at Kipahulu, Maui, and is not to be confounded
with Laka, goddess of the hula.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[44:a](ulh11.htm#fr_73) *Maláma*. Accented on
the penult, as here, the word means to enlighten or a light (same in
second verse). In the third and fourth verses the accent is changed to
the first syllable, and the word here means to preserve, to foster.
These words furnish an example of poetical word-repetition.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[44:b](ulh11.htm#fr_74) *Onioni*. To squirm, to
dodge, to move. The meaning here seems to be to move with delight.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[44:c](ulh11.htm#fr_75) *Wahine lei*. A
reference to *Laka*, the child of Kapo, who was symbolized by a block of
wood on the altar. (See [p. 23](ulh07.htm#page_23).)

<span id="fn_75"></span>[44:d](ulh11.htm#fr_76) *Hala-hala a i’a*. Said
to he a certain kind of fish that was ornamented about its tail-end with
a band of bright color; therefore an object of admiration and desire.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[44:e](ulh11.htm#fr_77) *Hala-hala a mea*. The
ending *mea* is perhaps taken from the last half of the proper name
*Hau-mea* who was Kapo's mother. It belongs to the land, in contrast to
the sea, and seems to be intended to intensify and extend the meaning of
the term previously used. The passage is difficult. Expert Hawaiians
profess their inability to fathom its meaning.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[44:f](ulh11.htm#fr_78) *Alihi luna*. The line
or "stretching cord," that runs the length of a net at its top, the *a
lalo* being the corresponding line at the bottom of the net. The exact
significance of the language complimentary to Kapo can not be phrased
compactly.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[44:g](ulh11.htm#fr_79) *Poha-kú*. The line that
runs up and down at the end of a long net, by which it may be anchored.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[44:h](ulh11.htm#fr_80) *Moo-helaia*. See note
a, [p. 33](ulh09.htm#page_33).

<span id="fn_80"></span>[44:i](ulh11.htm#fr_81) *Kaulana-a-ula*. See
note d, [p. 33](ulh09.htm#page_33).

<span id="fn_81"></span>[44:j](ulh11.htm#fr_82) *Ula leo*. See note c,
[p. 33](ulh09.htm#page_33).

<span id="fn_82"></span>[45:a](ulh11.htm#fr_83) *Kaana*. A place on
Mauna-loa, Molokai, where the lehua greatly flourished. The body of
Kapo, it is said, now lies there in appearance a rock. The same claim is
made for a rock at Wailua, Hana, Maui.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[45:b](ulh11.htm#fr_84) *Pu-awa hiwa* (*hiwa*,
black). A kind of strong awa. The gentle exhilaration, as well a the
deep sleep, of awa were benefits ascribed to the gods. Awa was an
essential to most complete sacrifices.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[45:c](ulh11.htm#fr_85) *Wai*. Literally water,
refers to the bowl of awa, replenished each day, which set on the altar
of the goddess.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[47:a](ulh11.htm#fr_86) *Kua-ha-ilo*. A god of
the *kahuna anaana*; meaning literally to breed maggots in the back.
