# XXVII.--THE HULA KIELÉI

The hula *kí-e-léi*, or *kí-le-léi*, was a performance of Hawaii's
classic times. and finds mention as such in the professedly imperfect
list of hulas given by the historian David Malo. <span
id="fr_406"></span>[a](#fn_393.md) It was marked by strenuous bodily
action, gestures with feet and hands, and that vigorous exercise of the
pelvis and body termed *ami*, the chief feature of which was a rotation
of the pelvis in circles and ellipses, which is not to be regarded as an
effort to portray sexual attitudes. It was a performance in which the
whole company stood and chanted the mele without instrumental
accompaniment.

The sacrifice offered at the kuahu in connection with the production of
this hula consisted of a black pig, a cock of the color termed
ula-hiwa--black pointed with red--a white hen, and awa. According to
some authorities the offerings deemed appropriate for the sacrifice that
accompanied each hula varied with the hula, but was definitely
established for each variety of hula. The author's studies, however,
lead him to conclude that, whatever may have been the original demands
of the gods, in the long run they were not over-particular and were not
only willing to put up with, but were well pleased so long as the
offering contained, good pork or fish and strong awa.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Perilous, steep, is the climb to Hanalei woods;  
To walk canny footed over its bogs;  
To balance oneself on its ledges,  
And toil up ladder of hanging roots.  
5 The bulk of my guide overhangs me,  
His loins are well-nigh exhausted;  
Two beautiful shapes!  
’Neath this bank I crouch sheltered from rain.

</div>

At first blush this mele seems to be the account of a perilous climb
through that wild mountainous region that lies back of Hanalei, Kauai, a
region of tangled woods, oozy steeps, fathomless bogs, narrow ridges,
and overhanging cliffs that fall away into profound abysses, making such
an excursion a most precarious adventure. This is what appears on the
surface. Hawaiian poets, however, did not indulge in landscape-painting
for its own sake; as a rule, they had some ulterior end in view, and
that end was the portrayal of some primal human passion, ambition, hate,
jealousy, love, especially love. Guided by this principle, one asks what
uncouth or romantic love adventure this wild mountain climb symbolizes.
All the Hawaiians whom the author has consulted on this question deny
any hidden meaning to this mele.

Aerial roots such as are put forth by the lehua trees in high altitudes

with a sort of ladder.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[211:a](ulh31.htm#fr_411.md) *U'i elua*. Literally
two beauties. One interpreter says the reference is to the arms, with
which one pulls himself up; it is here rendered " flanks."

<span id="fn_399"></span>[211:b](ulh31.htm#fr_412.md) *Ki-ki’i ka ua i ka
nana keia, la*. The meaning of this passage is obscure. The most
plausible view is that this is an exclamation made by one of the two
travelers while crouching for shelter under an overhanging bank. This
one, finding himself unprotected, exclaims to his companion on the
excellence of the shelter he has found, whereupon the second man comes
over to share his comfort only to find that he has been hoaxed and that
the deceiver has stolen his former place. The language of the text seems
a narrow foundation on which to base such an incident. A learned
Hawaiian friend, however, finds it all implied in this passage.
