# PREFATORY NOTE

Previous to the year 1906 the researches of the Bureau were restricted
to the American Indians, but by act of Congress approved June 30 of that
year the scope of its operations was extended to include the natives of
the Hawaiian islands. Funds were not specifically provided, however, for
prosecuting investigations among these people, and in the absence of an
appropriation for this purpose it was considered inadvisable to restrict
the systematic investigations among the Indian tribes in order that the
new field might be entered. Fortunately the publication of valuable data
pertaining to Hawaii is already provided for, and the present memoir by
Doctor Emerson is the first of the Bureau's Hawaiian series. It is
expected that this Bulletin will be followed shortly by one comprising
an extended list of works relating to Hawaii, compiled by Prof. H. M.
Ballou and Dr. Cyrus Thomas.
