# IX.--THE HULA ALA'A-PAPA

Every formal hula was regarded by the people of the olden time as a
sacred and religious performance (*tabu*); but all hulas were not held
to be of equal dignity and rank (*hanohano*). Among those deemed to be
of the noblest rank and honor was the *ala’a-papa*. In its best days
this was a stately and dignified performance, comparable to the
old-fashioned courtly minuet.

We shall observe in this hula the division of the performers into two
sets, the *hoopa’a* and the *olapa*. Attention will naturally bestow
itself first on the olapa, a division of the company made up of splendid
youthful figures, young men, girls, and women in the prime of life. They
stand a little apart and in advance of the others, the right hand
extended, the left resting upon the hip, from which hangs in swelling
folds the pa-ú. The time of their waiting for the signal to begin the
dance gives the eye opportunity to make deliberate survey of the forms
that stand before us.

The figures of the men are more finely proportioned, more statuesque,
more worthy of preservation in marble or bronze than those of the women.
Only at rare intervals does one find among this branch of the Polynesian
race a female shape which from crown to sole will satisfy the canons of
proportion--which one carries in the eye. That is not to say, however,
that the artistic eye will not often meet a shape that appeals to the
sense of grace and beauty. The springtime of Hawaiian womanly beauty
hastes away too soon. Would it were possible to stay that fleeting
period which ushers in full womanhood!

One finds himself asking the question to what extent the responsibility
for this overthickness of leg and ankle exaggerated in appearance, no
doubt, by the ruffled anklets often worn--this pronounced tendency to
the growth of that degenerate weed, fat, is to be explained by the
standard of beauty which held sway in Hawaii's courts and for many ages
acted as a principle of selection in the physical molding of the
Hawaiian female.

The prevailing type of physique among the Hawaiians, even more marked in
the women than in the men, is the short and thick, as opposed to the
graceful and slender. One does occasionally find delicacy of modeling in
the young and immature; but with adolescence fatness too often comes to
blur the outline.

The hoopa’a, who act as instrumentalists, very naturally maintain a
position between sitting and kneeling, the better to enable them to

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

handle that strangely effective drumlike instrument, the *ipu*, the one
musical instrument used as an accompaniment in this hula. The, ipu is
made from the bodies of two large, pear-shaped calabashes of unequal
sizes, which are joined together at their smaller ends in such a manner
as to resemble a figure-of-eight. An opening is left at the top of the
smaller calabash to increase the resonance. In moments of calm the
musicians allow the body to rest upon the heels: as the action warms
they lift themselves to such height as the bended knee will permit.

The ala’a-papa is a hula of comparatively moderate action. While the
olapa employ hands, feet, and body in gesture and pose to illustrate the
meaning and emotion of the song, the musicians mark the time by lifting
and patting with the right hand the ipu each holds in the left hand. If
the action of the play runs strong and stirs the emotions, each hoopa’a
lifts his ipu wildly, fiercely smites it, then drops it on the padded
rest in such manner as to bring out its deep mysterious tone.

At a signal from the kumu, who sits with the hoopa’a, the *poo-pua’a*,
leader of the olapa, calls the mele (*kahea i ka mele*)--that is, he
begins its recitation--in a tone differing but little from that of
ordinary conversation, a sing-song recitation, a vocalization less
stilted and less punctilious than that usually employed in the utterance
of the oli or mele. The kumu, the leader of the company, now joins in,
mouthing his words in full observance of the mele style. His manner of
cantillation may be either what may he called the low relief, termed
*ko’i-honua*, or a pompous alto-relievo style, termed *ai-ha’a*. This is
the signal for the whole company to chime in, in the same style as the
kumu. The result, as it seems to the untutored ear, is a confusion of
sounds like that of the many-tongued roar of the ocean.

The songs cantillated for the hula ala’a-papa were many and of great
variety. It seems to have been the practice for the kumu. to arrange a
number of mele, or poetical pieces, for presentation in the hula in such
order as pleased him. These different mele, thus arranged, were called
*pale*, compartments, or *mahele*, divisions, as if they were integral
parts of one whole, while in reality their relation to one another was
only that of the juxtaposition imposed upon them by the kumu.

The poetical pieces first to be presented were communicated to the
author as *mahele*, divisions--hardly cantos--in the sense above
defined. They are. however, distinct poems, though there chances to run
through them all a somewhat similar motive. The origin of many of these
is referred to a past so remote that tradition assigns them to what the
Hawaiians call the *wa po*, the night of tradition, or they say of them,
*no ke akua mai*, they are from the gods. It matters not

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

how faithful has been the effort to translate these poems, they will not
be found easy of comprehension. The local allusions, the point of view,
the atmosphere that were in the mind of the savage are not in our minds
to-day, and will not again be in any mind on earth; they defy our best
efforts at reproduction. To conjure up the ghostly semblance of these
dead impalpable things and make them live again is a problem that must
be solved by each one with such aid from the divining rod of the
imagination as the reader can summon to his help.

Now for the play, the song:

*Mele no ka Hula Alá’a-papa*

’Twas in Koolau I met with the rain:  
It comes with lifting and tossing of dust,  
Advancing in columns, dashing along.  
The rain, it sighs in the forest;  
5 The rain, it beats and whelms, like the surf;  
It smites, it smites now the land.  
Pasty the earth from the stamping rain;  
Full run the streams, a rushing flood;  
The mountain walls leap with the rain.  
10 See the water climbing its bounds like a dog,  
A raging dog, gnawing its way to pass out.

This song is from the story of Hiiaka on her journey to Kauai to bring

The author of this poem of venerable age is not known. It is spoken of
as belonging to the *wa po*, the twilight of tradition. It is
represented to be part of a mele taught to Hiiaka by her friend and
preceptress in the hula, Hopoe. Hopoe is often called *Hopoe-wahine*,
[from](errata.htm#0.md) internal evidence one can see that it can not be in
form the same as was given to Hiiaka by Hopoe; it may have been founded
on the poem of Hopoe. If so, it has been modified.

Heaven-magic, fetch a Hilo-pour from heaven!  
Morn's cloud-buds, look! they swell in the East.  
The rain-cloud parts. Hilo is deluged with rain,  
The Hilo of King Hana-kahi.

5 Surf breaks, stirs the mire of Pii-lani;  
The bones of Hilo are broken

Ghostly the rain-scud of Hilo in heaven;

Forth to observe the stab and thrust of the rain.  
The rain that clings to the roof of Hilo.

Hilo, like Puna, stands mountainless;  
Aye, mountain-free stand Hilo and Puna.  
15 Puna ’s a gulf ’twixt Ka-ú and Hilo:  
Just leaning her back on Mount Nothing.  
She sleeps at the feet of Mount Loa.

Ka-ú, a land much scourged by the A’e.  
20 A dust-cloud lifts in Ka-ú as one climbs.

"What name?" was asked of the old Hawaiian.

"A god," said he.

"How is that? A mele-inoa celebrates the name and glory of a king, not
of a god."

His answer was, "The gods composed the mele; men did not compose it."

Like an old-time geologist, he solved the puzzle of a novel phenomenon
by ascribing it to God.

(Bombastic style)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Haunt of white tropic-bird and big ruffled owl,  
Up rises the first-born child of the pali.  
He climbs, he climbs, he climbs up aloft,  
Kaholo-ku’-iwa, the pali of Ha’i.  
5 Accomplished now is the steep,  
The ladder-like series of steps.  
Malu-ó is left far below.

Passed is Ka-maha-la’-wili,  
The very ridge-pole of the rain--  
10 It's as if the peak cut it in twain--  
An arched roof the peak's crest Hale-hale-o-ú.  
A twisted cord hangs the brook Wai-hilau;  
Like smoke from roasting bird Ocean's wild dance;  
The shark-god is swimming the sea;

</div>

This mele, *Hole Waimea*, is also sung in connection with the hula
*ipu*.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

The song above given, the translation of which is to follow, belongs to
historic times, being ascribed to King Liholiho--Kamehameha II--who died
in London July 13, 1824, on his visit to England. It attained great
vogue and still holds its popularity with the Hawaiians. The reader will
note the comparative effeminacy and sentimentality of the style and the
frequent use of euphemisms and double-entendre. The double meaning in a
Hawaiian mele will not always be evident to one whose acquaintance with
the language is not intimate. To one who comes to it from excursions in
Anglo-Saxon poetry, wandering through its "meadows trim with daisies
pied," the sly intent of the Hawaiian, even when pointed out, will, no
doubt, seem an inconsequential thing and the demonstration of it an
impertinence, if not a fiction to the imagination. Its euphemisms in
reality have no baser intent than the euphuisms of Lyly, Ben Jonson, or
Shakespeare.

*Song--Hole Waimea*

PART IV

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Love tousled Waimea with shafts of the wind,  
While Kipuupuu puffed jealous gusts.  
Love is a tree that blights in the cold,  
But thrives in the woods of Mahiki.  
5 Smitten art thou with the blows of love;  
Luscious the water-drip in the wilds;  
Wearied and bruised is the flower of Koaie;  
Stung by the frost the herbage of Wai-ka-é,:  
And this--it is love.  
10 Wai-ka loves me like a sweetheart.  
Dear as my heart Koolau's yellow eye,  
My flower in the tangled wood, Hole-f-a,  
A travel-wreath to lay on love's breast,  
A shade to cover my journey's long climb.  
15 Love-touched, distraught, mine a wilderness-home;  
But still do I cherish the old spot,  
For love--it is love.  
Your love visits me even here:  
Where has it been hiding till now?

This is not a line-for-line translation; that the author found
infeasible. Line 8 of the English represents line 7 of the Hawaiian.
Given more literally, it might be, "He'll shake the buttocks of Hilo's
forty thousand."

The metaphor of this song is disjointed, but hot with the primeval
passions of humanity.

</div>

The following account is taken from the Polynesian Researches of the
Rev. William Ellis, the well-known English missionary, who visited these
islands in the years 1822 and 1823, and whose recorded observations have
been of the highest value in preserving a knowledge of the institutions
of ancient Hawaii:

In the afternoon, a party of strolling musicians and dancers arrived at
Kairua. About four o'clock they came, followed by crowds of people, and
arranged themselves on a fine sandy beach in front of one of the
governor's houses, where they exhibited a native dance, called *hura
araapapa*.

The five musicians first seated themselves in a line on the ground, and
spread a piece of folded cloth on the sand before them. Their instrument
was a large calabash, or rather two, one of an oval shape about three
feet high, the other perfectly round, very neatly fastened to it, having
also an aperture about three inches in diameter at the top. Each
musician held his instrument before him with both hands, and produced
his music by striking it on the ground, where he had laid a piece of
cloth, and beating it with his fingers, or the palms of his hands. As
soon as they began to sound their calabashes, the dancer, a young man
about the middle stature, advanced through the opening crowd.

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

<span class="small">His jet-black hair hung in loose and flowing
ringlets on his naked shoulders; his necklace was made of a vast number
of strings of nicely braided human hair, tied together behind, while a
*paraoa* (an ornament made of a whale's tooth) hung pendent from it on
his breast; his wrists were ornamented with bracelets formed of polished
tusks of the hog, and his ankles with loose buskins, thickly set with
dog's teeth, the rattle of which, during the dance, kept time with the
music of the calabash drum. A beautiful yellow tapa was tastefully
fastened round his loins, reaching to his knees. He began his dance in
front of the musicians, and moved forward and backwards, across the
area, occasionally chanting the achievements of former kings of Hawaii.
The governor sat at the end of the ring, opposite to the musicians, and
appeared gratified with the performance, which continued until the
evening. (Vol. IV. 100-101, London, Fisher, Son & Jackson, 1831.)</span>

<span class="small">NOTE BY THE AUTHOR.--At the time of Mr. Ellis' visit
to Hawaii the orthography of the Hawaiian language was still in a
formative stage, and it is said that his counsels had influence in
shaping it. His use of *r* instead of *l* in the words *hula*,
*alaapapa*, and *palaoa* may, therefore, be ascribed to the fact of his
previous acquaintance with the dialects of southern Polynesia, in which
the sound of *r* to a large extent substitutes that of *1*, and to the
probability that for that reason his ear was already attuned to the
prevailing southern fashion, and his judgment prepossessed in that
direction.</span>

<span id="fn_147"></span>[61:k](ulh13.htm#fr_148.md) *Iwi-honua*. Literally
a bone of the earth: a projecting rock or a shoal; if in the water, an
object to be avoided by the surf-rider. In this connection see note *o*,

<span id="fn_148"></span>[63:a](ulh13.htm#fr_149.md) *Hale-kai*. A wild
mountain glen back of Hanalei valley, Kauai.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[63:b](ulh13.htm#fr_150.md) *Ma’alewa*. An aerial
root that formed a sort of ladder by which one climbed the mountain
steeps; literally a shaking sling.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[63:c](ulh13.htm#fr_151.md) *Moana-nui-ka-lehua*.
A female demigod that came from the South (*Ku-kulu-o-Kahiki*) at about
the same mythical period as that of Pele's arrival--if not in her
company--and who was put in charge of a portion of the channel that lies
between Kauai and Oahu. This channel was generally termed *Ie-ie-waena*
and *Ie-ie-waho*. Here the name *Moana-nui-ka-lehua* seems to be used to
indicate the sea as well as the demigoddess, whose dominion it was.
Ordinarily she appeared as a powerful fish, but she was capable of
assuming the form of a beautiful woman (mermaid?). The title *lehua* was
given her on account of her womanly charms.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[63:d](ulh13.htm#fr_152.md) *Mali’o*. Apparently
another form of the word *malino*, calm; at any rate it has the same
meaning.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[63:e](ulh13.htm#fr_153.md) *Lehua*. An allusion
to the ill-fated young woman Hopoe, who was Hiiaka's intimate friend.
The allusion is amplified in the next line.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[63:f](ulh13.htm#fr_154.md) *Hopoe-lehua*. The
lehua tree was one of the forms in which Hopoe appeared, and after her
death, due to the jealous rage of Pele, she was turned into a charred
lehua tree which stood on the coast subject to the beating of the surf.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[63:g](ulh13.htm#fr_155.md) *Maka’u ka lehua i ke
kanaka*. Another version has it *Maka’u ke kanaka i ka lehua*; Man fears
the lehua. The form here used is perhaps an ironical allusion to man's
fondness not only to despoil the tree of its scarlet flowers, but
womanhood, the woman it represented.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[63:h](ulh13.htm#fr_156.md) *Kea-au*. Often
shortened in pronunciation to *Ke-au*, a fishing village in Puna near
Hilo town. It now has a landing place for small vessels.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[64:a](ulh13.htm#fr_157.md) *Hoolono*. To call, to
make an uproar, to spread a report.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[64:b](ulh13.htm#fr_158.md) *Ia hoo-nee-nee ia
pili mai*. A very peculiar figure of speech. It is as if the poet
personified the act of two lovers snuggling up close to each other.
Compare with this the expression No huli mai, used by another poet in
the thirteenth line of the lyric given on [p. 204](ulh29.htm#page_204.md).
The motive is the same in each case.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[65:a](ulh13.htm#fr_159.md) *Hi’u-o-lani*. A very
blind phrase. Hawaiians disagree as to its meaning. In the author's
opinion, it is a word referring to the conjurer's art.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[65:b](ulh13.htm#fr_160.md) *Ua o Hilo*. Hilo is a
very rainy country. The name Hilo seems to be used here as almost a
synonym of violent rain. It calls to mind the use of the word Hilo to
signify a strong wind:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Pa mai, pa mai.  
Ka makani a Hilo! <span id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_165.md)  
Waiho ka ipu iki,  
Homai ka ipu nui!

</div>

\[Translation\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Blow, blow, thou wind of Hilo!  
Leave the little calabash,  
Bring on the big one!

</div>

<span id="fn_160"></span>[65:c](ulh13.htm#fr_161.md) *Pua-lani*. The name
of a deity who took the form of the rosy clouds of morning.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[65:d](ulh13.htm#fr_162.md) *Mahele ana*.
Literally the dividing; an allusion to the fact, it is said, that in
Hilo a rain-cloud, or rain-squall, as it came up would often divide and
a part of it turn off toward Puna at the cape named Lele-iwi, one-half
watering, in the direction of the present town, the land known as
Hana-kahi.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[65:e](ulh13.htm#fr_163.md) *Huna-kahi*. Look at
note f, [p. 60](#page_60.md).

<span id="fn_163"></span>[65:f](ulh13.htm#fr_164.md) *Mauna-ole*. According
to one authority this should be Mauna-Hilo. Verses 13, 14, 16, and 17
are difficult of translation. The play on the words *ku a*, standing at,
or standing by, and *kua*, the back; also on the word *kowa*, a gulf or
strait; and the repetition of the word *mauna*, mountain--all this is
carried to such an extent as to be quite unintelligible to the
Anglo-Saxon mind, though full of significance to a Hawaiian.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[65:g](ulh13.htm#fr_165.md) *A’e*. A strong wind
that prevails in Ka-u. The some word also means to step on, to climb.
This double-meaning gives the poet opportunity for a euphuistic
word-play that was much enjoyed by the Hawaiians. The Hawaiians of the
present day are not quite up to this sort of logomachy.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[65:1](ulh13.htm#fr_166.md) *Hilo*, or Whiro, as
in the Maori, was a great navigator.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[66:a](ulh13.htm#fr_167.md) *Kaili-ki’i*. The
promontory that shelters the cove *Ka-hewa-hewa*.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[66:b](ulh13.htm#fr_168.md) *Ka-hea-hea*. The name
of the cove *Ka-hewa-hewa*, above mentioned, is here given in a softened
form obtained by the elision of the letter *w*.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[67:a](ulh13.htm#fr_170.md) *Koa’e-kea*, *Pueo
hulu-nui*. Steep declivities, *pali*, on the side of Waipio valley,
Hawaii. Instead of inserting these names, which would be meaningless
without an explanation, the author has given a literal translation of
the names themselves, thus getting a closer insight into the Hawaiian
thought.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[67:b](ulh13.htm#fr_171.md) *A’e*. The precipices
rise one above another like the steps of a stairway, climbing, climbing
up, though the probable intent of the poet is to represent some one as
climbing the ascent.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[67:c](ulh13.htm#fr_172.md) *Ha’i*. Short for
*Ha’ina-kolo*; a woman about whom there is a story of tragic adventure.
Through eating when famished of some berries in an unceremonious way she
became distraught and wandered about for many months until discovered by
the persistent efforts of her husband. The pali which she climbed was
named after her.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[67:d](ulh13.htm#fr_173.md) *Maka’u-kiu*. The name
of a famous huge shark that was regarded with reverential fear.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[67:e](ulh13.htm#fr_174.md) *Pohaku lele*. In
order to determine whether a shark was present, it was the custom,
before going into the clear water of some of these coves, to throw rocks
into the water in order to disturb the monster and make his presence
known.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[68:a](ulh13.htm#fr_176.md) *Big-leaf*. A literal
translation of *Lau-nui*. *Laupahoehoe*, Flat-leaf.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[68:b](ulh13.htm#fr_177.md) *Hole*. To rasp, to
handle rudely, to caress passionately. Waimea is a district and village
on Hawaii.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[68:c](ulh13.htm#fr_178.md) *Kipu’u-pu’u*. A cold
wind from Mauna-Kea that blows at Waimea.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[68:d](ulh13.htm#fr_179.md) *Mahiki*. A woodland
in Waimea, in mythological times haunted by demons and spooks.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[68:e](ulh13.htm#fr_180.md) *Mala-nai*. The
poetical name of a wind, probably the trade wind; a name much used in
Hawaiian sentimental poetry.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[68:f](ulh13.htm#fr_181.md) *Oha-wai*. A water
hole that is filled by dripping; an important source of supply for
drinking purposes in certain parts of Hawaii.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[68:g](ulh13.htm#fr_182.md) *Pua o Koaie*. The
koaie is a tree that grows in the wilds, the blossom of which is
extremely fragrant. (Not the same as that subspecies of the *koa*
(Acacia koa) which Hillebrand describes and wrongly spells *koaia*. Here
a euphemism for the delicate parts.)

<span id="fn_180"></span>[68:h](ulh13.htm#fr_183.md) *Koolau*, or, full
form, *Ko-koo-lau*. Described by Doctor Hillebrand as *Kokolau*, a wrong
spelling. It has a pretty yellow flower, a yellow eye--*maka lena*--as
the song has it. Here used tropically. (This is the plant whose leaf is
sometimes used as a substitute for tea.)

<span id="fn_181"></span>[68:i](ulh13.htm#fr_184.md) *Moolau*. An
expression used figuratively to mean a woman, more especially her
breasts. The term *huli-lau* is also used, in a slang way, to signify
the breasts of a woman, the primitive meaning being a calabash.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[68:j](ulh13.htm#fr_185.md) *Pili*. To touch;
touched. This was the word used in the forfeit-paying love game, *kilu*,
when the player made a point by hitting the target of his opponent with
his *kilu*. (For further description see p. 235.)

<span id="fn_183"></span>[70:a](ulh13.htm#fr_186.md) *Po-lolo*. A secret
word, like a cipher, made up for the occasion and compounded of two
words, *po*, night, and *loloa*, long, the final *a* of *loloa* being
dropped. This form of speech was called *kepakepa*, and was much used by
the Hawaiians in old times.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[70:b](ulh13.htm#fr_187.md) *Ulu-mano*. A violent
wind which blows by night only on the western side of Hawaii. Kamehameha
with a company of men was once wrecked by this wind off Nawawa; a whole
village was burned to light them ashore. (*Dictionary of the Hawaiian
Language*, by Lorrin Andrews.)

<span id="fn_185"></span>[70:c](ulh13.htm#fr_188.md) *Walu-ihe a ke A’e*.
The A’e is a violent wind that is described as blowing from different
points of the compass in succession; a circular storm. *Walu-ihe*--eight
spears--was a name applied to this same wind during a certain portion of
its circuitous range, covering at least eight different points, as
observed by the Hawaiians. It was well fitted, therefore, to serve as a
figure descriptive of eight different lovers, who follow each other in
quick succession in the favors of the same wanton.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[70:d](ulh13.htm#fr_189.md) *Ho-li’o*. The name of
a wind, but of an entirely different character from those above
mentioned.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[70:e](ulh13.htm#fr_190.md) *Hana-kahi*. (See note
f, [p. 60](#page_60)..md)
