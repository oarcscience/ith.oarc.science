# XXV.--THE HULA PA’I-UMAUMA

The hula *pa’i-umauma*--chest-beating hula--called also hula
*Paláni*, <span id="fr_379"></span>[a](#fn_366.md) was an energetic dance,
in which the actors, who were also the singers, maintained a kneeling
position, with the buttocks at times resting on the heels. In spite of
the restrictions imposed by this attitude, they managed to put a
spirited action into the performance; there were vigorous gestures, a
frequent smiting of the chest with the open hand, and a strenuous
movement of the pelvis and lower part of the body called *ami*. This
consisted of rhythmic motions, sidewise, backward, forward, and in a
circular or elliptical orbit, all of which was done with the precision
worthy of an acrobat, an accomplishment attained only after long
practice. It was a hula of classic celebrity, and was performed without
the accompaniment of instrumental music.

In the mele now to be given the poet calls up a succession of pictures
by imagining himself in one scenic position after another, beginning at
Hilo and passing in order from one island to another--omitting, however,
Maui--until he finds himself at Kilauea, an historic and traditionally
interesting place on the windward coast of the garden-island, Kauai. The
order of travel followed by the poet forbids the supposition that the
Kilauea mentioned is the great caldera of the volcano on Hawaii in which
Pele had her seat.

It is useless to regret that the poet did not permit his muse to tarry
by the way long enough to give us something more than a single eyeshot
at the quickly shifting scenes which unrolled themselves before him,
that so he might have given us further reminiscence of the lands over
which his Pegasus bore him. Such completeness of view, however, is alien
to the poesy of Hawaii.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

At Hilo I rendezvoused with the lehua;  
By the Wailuku stream, near the robber-den;  
Off cape Lele-iwi I swam in the ocean;  
At Pana-ewe, mid groves of lehua;  
5 At Ha-ili, a forest of flocking birds.  
On Molokai I travel its one highway;  
I saw the plain of Kala’e quiver with heat,  
And beheld the ax-quarries of Manna-loa.  
Ah, the perfume Nihoa's pandanus exhales!  
10 Ko’i-ahi, home of the small-leafed maile;  
And now at Makua, lo, its virgin sand,  
While ocean surges and scours on below.  
Lo, a woman crouched on the shore by the sea,  
In the brick-red bowl, Kilauea's bay.

In the next mele to be given it is evident that, though the motive is
clearly Hawaiian, it has lost something of the rugged simplicity and
impersonality that belonged to the most archaic style, and that it has
taken on the sentimentality of a later period.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Come now, Manono,  
Come, Manono, I say,  
Take up the burden;  
Through groves of pandanus  
5 And wild stag-horn fern,  
Wearisome fern, lies our way.  
Arrived at the hill-top,  
We'll smooth out the nest,  
That we may snug close.

10 Turn now to me, dear,  
While we rest here.  
Make we a little nest,  
That we may draw near.  
This way your face, dear, <span id="page_205">p. 205</span>  
15 While we rest here.  
Rest thou and I here,  
Near the warm, warm water  
And the smooth lava-plate  
Of Mau-kele.

20 Rest thou and I here.  
By the water so warm,  
And the lava-plate smooth  
Of Mau-kele.  
Little by little  
25 Your thoughts will be mine.  
Little by little  
Your thoughts I'll divine.

</div>

Manono was the name of the brave woman, wife of Ke-kua-o-ka-lani, who
fell in the battle of Kuamo’o, in Kona, Hawaii, in 1819, fighting by the
side of her husband. They died in support of the cause of law and order,
of religion and tabu, the cause of the conservative party in Hawaii, as
opposed to license and the abolition of all restraint.

The *uluhe* (verses 5, 6) is the stag-horn fern, which forms a matted
growth most obstructive to woodland travel. The burden Manono is asked
to bear, what else is it but the burden of life, in this case lightened
by love?

Whether there is any connection between the name of the
hula--breast-beating--and the expression in the first verse of the
following mele is more than the author can say.

’Tis Kahipa, with pendulous breasts;  
How they swing to and fro, see-saw!  
The teeth of Lani-wahine gape--  
A truce to upper and lower jaw!  
5 From Lihue we look upon Ewa;  
There swam the monster, Miko-lo-lóu,  
His bowels torn out by Pa-pi’-o.  
The shark was caught in grip of the hand.  
Let each one stay himself with wild herbs,  
10 And for comfort turn his hungry eyes  
To the rustling trees of Lei-walo.  
Hark! the whistling-plover--her old-time seat,  
As one climbs the hill from Echo-glen,  
And cools his brow in the breeze.

The thread of interest that holds together the separate pictures
composing this mele is slight. It will, perhaps, give to the whole a
more definite meaning if we recognize that it is made up of snapshots at
various objects and localities that presented themselves to one passing
along the old road from Kahúku, on Oahu, to the high land which gave the
tired traveler his first distant view of Honolulu before he entered the
winding canyon of Moana-lua.

called at Moanalua because a woman who was its chief exponent was a
Catholic, one of the "poe Paláni." Much odium has been laid to the
charge of the hula on account of the supposed indecency of the motion
termed *ami*. There can be no doubt that the ami was at times used to
represent actions unlit for public view, and so fir the blame is just.
But the ami did not necessarily nor always represent obscenity, and to
this extent the hula has been unjustly maligned.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[203:a](ulh29.htm#fr_380.md) *Lehúa*. A tree that
produces the tufted scarlet flower that is sacred to the goddess of the
hula, Laka.

the cause of death by drowning of very many. Another story is that it
was once the hiding place of robbers.

valley in the district of Waianae, Oahu, where was the home of the
small-leafed maile.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[203:k](ulh29.htm#fr_390.md) *Makua*. A valley in
Waianae.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[203:l](ulh29.htm#fr_391.md) *One opio-pio*. Sand

for instance, who is naked and desires to escape observation.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[203:n](ulh29.htm#fr_393.md) *Kilauea*. There is
some doubt whether this is the Kilauea on Kauai or a little place of the
same name near cape Kaena, the westernmost point of Oahu.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[205:a](ulh29.htm#fr_394.md) *Ka-hipa*. Said to be

visited Oahu and was hospitably received by Ka-ahu-pahau and Ka-hi’u-ká,
sharks of the Ewa lagoons. who had a human ancestry and were on friendly
terms with their kindred. Miko-lo-lóu, when his hosts denied him human
flesh, helped himself. In the conflict that rose the Ewa sharks joined
with their human relatives and friends on land to put an end to
Miko-lo-lóu. After a fearful contest they took him and reduced his body
to ashes. A dog, however, snatched and ate a portion--some say the
tongue, some the tail--and another part fell into the water. This was
reanimated by the spirit of the dead shark and grew to be a monster of
the same size and power as the one deceased. Miko-lo-lóu now gathered
his friends and allies from all the waters and made war against the Ewa
sharks, but was routed.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[206:a](ulh29.htm#fr_397.md) *Pa-pi’-o*. A shark
of moderate size, but of great activity, that fought against
Miko-lo-lóu. It entered his enormous mouth, passed down into his
stomach, and there played havoc with the monster, eating its way out.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[206:b](ulh29.htm#fr_398.md) *Ai pakahi, e, i to
nahele*. The company represented by the poet to he journeying pass
through an uninhabited region barren of food. The poet calls upon them
to satisfy their hunger by eating of the edible wild herbs--they abound
everywhere in Hawaii--at the same time representing them as casting
longing glances on the breadfruit trees of Leiwalo. This was a grove in
the lower levels of Ewa that still survives.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[206:c](ulh29.htm#fr_399.md) *Kolea-kani*. A
female *kupua*--witch she might be called now--that had the form of a

travelers who went that way.
