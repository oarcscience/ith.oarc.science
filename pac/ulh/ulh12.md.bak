# VIII.--COSTUME OF THE HULA DANCER

The costume of the hula dancer was much the same for both sexes, its
chief article a simple short skirt about the waist, the pa-ú. ([Pl.
I.](ulh00.htm#img_pl01).md)

When the time has come for a dance, the halau becomes one common
dressing room. At a signal from the kumu the work begins. The putting on
of each article of costume is accompanied by a special song.

First come the *ku-pe’e*, anklets of whale teeth, bone, shell-work,
dog-teeth, fiber-stuffs, and what not. While all stoop in unison they
chant the song of the anklet:

*Mele Ku-pe’e*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Aala kupukupu <span id="fr_87"></span>[a](#fn_86.md) ka uka o
Kane-hoa. <span id="fr_88"></span>[b](#fn_87.md)  
E ho-a! <span id="fr_89"></span>[c](#fn_88.md)  
Hoa na lima o ka makani, he Wai-kaloa. <span

Ku’u pua,  
Ku’u pua i’ini e ku-i a lei.  
Ina ia oe ke lei ’a mai la.

</div>

\[Translation\]

*Anklet-Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Fragrant the grasses of high Kane-hoa.  
Bind on the anklets, bind!  
Bind with finger deft as the wind  
That cools the air of this bower.  
5 Lehua bloom pales at my flower,  
O sweetheart of mine,  
Bud that I'd pluck and wear in my wreath,  
If thou wert but a flower!

</div>

The short skirt, *pa-ú*, was the most important piece of attire worn by
the Hawaiian female. As an article of daily wear it represented many
stages of evolution beyond the primitive fig-leaf, being fabricated from
a great variety of materials furnished by the garden of

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

nature. In its simplest terms the pa-ú was a mere fringe of vegetable
fibers. When placed as the shield of modesty about the loins of a woman
of rank, or when used as the full-dress costume of a dancing girl on a
ceremonious occasion, it took on more elaborate forms, and was
frequently of *tapa*, a fabric the finest specimens of which would not
have shamed the wardrobe of an empress.

In the costuming of the hula girl the same variety obtained as in the
dress of a woman of rank. Sometimes her pa-ú would be only a close-set
fringe of ribbons stripped from the bark of the hibiscus (*hau*), the
*ti* leaf or banana fiber, or a fine rush, strung upon a thong to
encircle the waist. In its most elaborate and formal style the pa-ú
consisted of a strip of fine tapa, several yards long and of width to
reach nearly to the knees. It was often delicately tinted or printed. as
to its outer part, with stamped figures. The part of the tapa skirt thus
printed, like the outer, decorative one in a set of tapa bed-sheets, was
termed the *kilohana*.

The pa-ú worn by the danseuse, when of tapa, was often of such volume as
to balloon like the skirt of a coryphée. To put it on was quite an art,
and on that account, if not on the score of modesty, a portion of the
halau was screened off and devoted to the use of the females as a
dressing room, being known as the *unu-lau-koa*, and to this place they
repaired as soon as the kumu gave the signal for dressing.

The hula pa-ú of the women was worn in addition to that of daily life;
the hula pa-ú of the men, a less pretentious affair, was worn outside
the malo, and in addition to it.

The method of girding on the pa-ú was peculiar. Beginning at the right
hip--some say the left--a free end was allowed to hang quite to the
knee; then, passing across the back, rounding the left hip, and
returning by way of the abdomen to the starting point, another circuit
of the waist was accomplished; and, a reverse being made, the garment
was secured by passing the bight of the tapa beneath the hanging folds
of the pa-ú from below upward until it slightly protruded above the
border of the garment at the waist. This second end was thus brought to
hang down the hip alongside of the first free end; an arrangement that
produced a most decorative effect.

The Hawaiians, in their fondness for giving personal names to inanimate
objects, named the two free ends (*apua*) of the pa-ú respectively
*ku-kápu-úla-ka-láni* and *Léle-a-mahu’i*.

According to another method, which was simpler and more commonly
employed, the piece was folded sidewise and, being gathered into pleats,
a cord was inserted the length of the fold. The cord was passed about
the waist, knotted at the hip, and thus held the garment secure.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

While the girls are making their simple toilet and donning their unique,
but scanty, costume, the kumu, aided by others, soothes the impatience
of the audience and stimulates their imagination by cantillating a mele
that sets forth in grandiloquent imagery the praise of the pa-ú.

This is a typical Hawaiian poem of the better sort, keyed in a highly
imaginative strain. The multitude of specific allusions to topographical
names make it difficult to translate it intelligently to

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

a foreign mind. The poetical units are often so devised that each new
division takes its clue from the last word of the previous verse, on the
principle of "follow your leader," a capital feature in Hawaiian poetry.

\[Translation\]

*Pa-ú Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Gird on the pa-ú, garment tucked in one side,  
Skirt lacelike and beauteous in staining,  
That is wrapped and made fast about the oven.  
Bubbly as foam of falling water it stands,  
5 Quintuple skirt, sheer as the cliff Kupe-hau.  
One journeyed to work on it at Honokane.

Have a care the pa-ú is not filched.  
Scent from the robe Manú climbs the valley walls--  
Abysses profound, heights twisting the neck.  
10 A child is this steep thing of the cliff Kau-kini,  
A swelling cloud on the peak of Auwana.

Wondrous the care and toll to make the pa-ú!  
What haste to finish, when put a-soak  
In the side-glancing stream of Apua!  
15 Caught by the rain-scud that searches the glen,  
The tinted gown illumines the pali--

The sheeny steep shot with buds of lama--  
Outshining the comely malua-ula,  
Which one may seize and gird with a strong hand.  
20 Leaf of ti for his malo, Umi <span id="fr_121"></span>[a](#fn_120.md)
stood covered.

Look at the oloná fibers inwrought,  
Like the trickling brooklets of Wai-hilau.  
The oloná fibers knit with strength  
This dainty immaculate web, the pa-ú,  
25 And the filmy weft of the kilo-hana.  
With the small bamboo the tapa is finished.

A fire seems to bud on the pali.  
When the tapa is spread out to dry,  
Pressed down with stones at Wai-manu--  
30 Stones that are shifted about and about,  
Stones that are tossed here and there,  
Like work of the hail-thrower Kane.

At Wai-manu finished, ’tis cut at Wai-pi’o;  
Ha’i takes the bamboo Ko-a’e-kea;

</div>

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

35 Deftly wields the knife of small-leafed bamboo;  
A bamboo choice and fit for the work.  
Cut, cut through, cut off the corners;  
Cut round, like crescent moon of Hoaka;  
Cut in scallops this shift that makes tabu:  
40 A fringe is this for the pa-ú.

’Tis lifted by Ka-holo-ku-iwa,  
’Tis borne by Pa-wili-wili;  
A pa-ú narrow at top like a house,  
That's hung on the roof-tree till morning,

45 Hung on the roof-tree Ha-la’a-wili.  
Make a handle fitting the shoulder;  
Lash it fast, rolled tight like a log.  
The bundle falls, red shows the pali;  
The children shout, they scream in derision.  
50 The a’o bird shrieks itself hoarse  
In wonder at the pa-ú--  
Pa-ú with a sheen like Hi’i-lawe falls,  
Bowed like the rainbow arch  
Of the rain that's now falling.

The girls of the olapa, their work in the tiring-room completed, lift
their voices in a spirited song, and with a lively motion pass out into
the hall to bloom before the waiting assembly in the halau in all the
glory of their natural charms and adornments:

*Oli*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ku ka punohu ula i ka moana;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

5 A shout of applause

I appeal to thee, Laka!

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

The answering song, led by the kumu, is in the same flamboyant strain:

*Oli*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Lift Mahu’ilani on high,  
Thy palms Kauna-lewa a-waving!

After the ceremony of the pa-ú came that of the lei, a wreath to crown
the head and another for the neck and shoulders. It was not the custom
in the old times to overwhelm the body with floral decorations and to
blur the outlines of the figure to the point of disfigurement; nor was
every flower that blows acceptable as an offering. The gods were jealous
and nice in their tastes, pleased only with flowers indigenous to the
soil--the ilima ([pl. VI](#img_pl06).md), the lehua, the maile, the ie-ie,
and the like (see pp. [19](ulh06.htm#page_19), [20](ulh06.htm#page_20).md).
The ceremony was quickly accomplished. As the company knotted the
garlands about head or neck, they sang:

*Oli Lei*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ke lei mai la o Ka-ula i ke kai, e!  
Ke malamalama o Niihau, ua malie.  
A maile, pa ka Inu-wai.  
Ke inu mai la na hala o Naue i ke kai.  
5 No Naue, ka hala, no Puna ka wahine. <span
id="fr_125"></span>[c](#fn_124.md)  
No ka lua no i Kilauea.

</div>

\[Translation\]

*Wreath Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ka-ula wears the ocean as a wreath;  
Nii-hau shines forth in the calm.  
After the calm blows the wind Inu-wai;  
Naue's palms then drink in the salt.  
5 From Naue the palm, from Puna the woman--  
Aye, from the pit, Kilauea.

</div>

Tradition tells a pathetic story ([p. 212](ulh32.htm#page_212).md) in
narrating an incident touching the occasion on which this song first was
sung.

bed-clothes. Five turns also, It is said, complete a pa-ú.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[51:e](ulh12.htm#fr_96.md) *Pali no Kupe-hau*.
Throughout the poem the pa-ú is compared to a *pali*, a mountain wall.
Kupe-hau is a precipitous part of Wai-pi’o valley.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[51:f](ulh12.htm#fr_97.md) *Hono-kane*. A valley

Ole-pau, the king of the island Maui, ordered his retainer, Lua-hoo-moe,
to fetch for his eating some young *u-a’u*, a sea-bird that nests and
rears its young in the mountains. These young birds are esteemed a
delicacy. The kahuna, who was a bird-hunter, truthfully told the king
that it was not the season for the young birds; the parent birds were
haunting the ocean. At this some of the king's boon companions, moved by
ill-will, charged the king's mountain retainer with suppressing the
truth, and in proof they brought some tough old birds caught at sea and
had them served for the kings table. Thereupon the king, not discovering
the fraud, ordered that Lua-hoo-moe should be put to death by fire. The
following verses were communicated to the author as apropos of Kau-kini,
evidently the name of a man:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ike ia Kau-kini, he lawaia manu.  
He upena ku’u i ka noe, i Poha-kahi,  
Ua hoopulu ia i ka ohu ka kikepa;

ula*. The malua-ula was a variety of tapa that was stained with *hili
kukui* (the root-bark of the kukui tree). The ripe kukui nut was chewed
into a paste and mingled with this stain. *Mama ula* refers to this
chewing. The *malua ula* is mentioned as a foil to the pa-ú, being a
cheap tapa.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[52:c](ulh12.htm#fr_103.md) A contracted form of
*ti* or *ki*, the plant or, as in this case, the leaf of the *ti*, the
Dracæna ([pl. v](ulh11.htm#img_pl05).md). Liloa, the father of Umi, used it
to cover himself after his amour with the mother of Umi, having given
his malo in pledge to the woman. Umi may have used this same leaf as a
substitute for the malo while in the wilderness of Laupahoehoe, hiding
away from his brother, King Hakau.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[52:d](ulh12.htm#fr_104.md) *Oloná*. A strong
vegetable fiber sometimes added to tapa to give it strength. The fibers
of olona in the fabric of the pa-ú are compared to the runnels and
brooklets of *Waihilau*.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[52:e](ulh12.htm#fr_105.md) *Wai-hilau*. Name
applied to the water that drips in a cave in Puna. It is also the name
of a stream in Wai-pi’o valley, Hawaii.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[52:f](ulh12.htm#fr_106.md) *Kilo-hana*. The name
given the outside, ornamented, sheet of a set (*kuina*) of five tapas
used as bed-clothing. It was also applied to that part of a pa-ú which
was decorated with figures. The word comes from *kilohi*, to examine
critically, and *hana*, to work and therefore means an ornamental work.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[52:g](ulh12.htm#fr_107.md) *Ohe*. Bamboo. In this
case the stamp, made from bamboo, used to print the tapa.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[52:h](ulh12.htm#fr_108.md) *Alá*. The hard, dark
basalt of which the Hawaiian *ko’i*, adz, is made; any pebble, or small
water-worn stone, such as would be used to hold in place the pa-ú while
spread out to dry.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[52:i](ulh12.htm#fr_109.md) *Kane-poha-ka’a*.
Kane-the-hail-sender. The great god Kane was also conceived of as
Kane-hekili, the thunderer; Kane-lulu-honua, the earthquake-sender, etc.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[53:a](ulh12.htm#fr_113.md) *Hoaka*. The name of
the moon in its second day, or of the second day of the Hawaiian month;
a crescent.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[53:b](ulh12.htm#fr_114.md) *O awili a Malu-ó*.
The most direct and evident sense of the word *awili* is to wrap. It
probably means the wrapping of the pa-ú about the loins; or it may mean
the movable, shifty action of the pa-ú caused by the lively actions of
the dancer. The expression *Malu-ó* may be taken from the utterance of
the king's *ilamuku* (constable or sheriff) or other official, who, in
proclaiming a tabu, held an idol in his arms and at the same time called
out *Kapu, o-o*! The meaning is that the pa-ú, when wrapped about the
woman's loins, laid a tabu on the woman. The old Hawaiian consulted on
the meaning of this passage quoted the following, which illustrates the
fondness of his people for endless repetitions and play upon words:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">
