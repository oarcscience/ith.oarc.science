# XXXVI.--THE HULA HOO-NA-NÁ

The hula *hoo-na-ná*--to quiet, amuse--was an informal dance, such as
was performed without the usual restrictions of tabu that hedged about
the set dances of the halau. The occasion of an outdoor festival, an
*ahaaina* or *luau*, was made the opportunity for the exhibition of this
dance. It seems to have been an expression of pure sportiveness and
mirth-making, and was therefore performed without sacrifice or religious
ceremony. While the king, chiefs, and *aialo*--courtiers who ate in the
king's presence--are sitting with the guests about the festal board, two
or three dancers of graceful carriage make a circuit of the place,
ambling, capering, gesturing as they go in time to the words of a gay
song.

A performance of this sort was witnessed by the author's informant in
Honolulu many years ago; the occasion was the giving of a royal luau.
There was no musical instrument, the performers were men, and the mele
they cantillated went as follows:

\[Translation\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

She is limed, she is limed,  
My bird is limed,  
With the gum of the forest.  
We make a great circuit,  
5 Outskirting the feast.  
You shall feast on king's bounty:  
No fear of the tabu, all's free.  
Free! and by whom?  
Free by the word of the king.  
10 Then a free rein to mirth!  
Banish the kill-joy  
Who eats the king's dainties!  
Feast then till replete  
With the good king's meat!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_483"></span>[244:a](ulh40.htm#fr_499.md) *Kepáu*. Gum, the
bird-lime of the fowler, which was obtained from forest trees, but
especially from the *ulu*, the breadfruit.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[244:b](ulh40.htm#fr_500.md) *Muli-wa’a* (*muli*,
a term applied to a younger brother). The idea involved is that of
separation by an interval, as a younger brother is separated from his
older brother by an interval. *Muliwai* is an interval of water, a
stream. *Wa’a*, the last part of the above compound word, literally a
canoe, is here used tropically to mean the tables, or the dishes, on
which the food was spread, they being long and narrow, in the shape of a
canoe. The whole term, consequently, refers to the people and the table
about which they are seated.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[244:c](ulh40.htm#fr_501.md) *Eli-eli*. A word
that is found in ancient prayers to emphasize the word *kapu* or the
word *noa*.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[244:d](ulh40.htm#fr_502.md) *Lilua*. To stand
erect and act without the restraint usually prescribed in the presence
of royalty.
