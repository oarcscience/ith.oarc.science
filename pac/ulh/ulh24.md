# XX.--THE HULA OHE

The action of the hula *ohe* had some resemblance to one of the figures
of the Virginia reel. The dancers, ranged in two parallel rows, moved
forward with an accompaniment of gestures until the head of each row had
reached the limit in that direction, and then, turning outward to right
and left, countermarched in the same manner to the point of starting,
and so continued to do. They kept step and timed their gestures and
movements to the music of the bamboo nose-flute, the *ohe*.

In a performance of this hula witnessed by an informant the chorus of
dancers was composed entirely of girls, while the kumu operated the
nose-flute and at the same time led the cantillation of the mele. This
seemed an extraordinary statement, and the author challenged the
possibility of a person blowing with the nose into a flute and at the
same time uttering words with the mouth. The Hawaiian asserted,
nevertheless, that the leader of the hula, the kumu, did accomplish
these two functions; yet his answer did not remove doubt that they were
accomplished jointly and at the same time. The author is inclined to
think that the kumu performed the two actions alternately.

The musical range of the nose-flute was very limited; it had but two or,
at the most, three stops. The player with his left hand held the flute
to the nostril, at the same time applying a finger of the same hand to
keep the other nostril closed. With the fingers of his right hand he
operated the stops ([pl. XV](#img_pl15).md).

Come up to the wildwood, come;  
Let us visit Wai-kini,  
And gaze on Pihana-ka-lani,

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Its birds of plumage so fine;  
5 Be comrade to Hale-lehua,  
Soul-mate to Kau’kahi-alii.  
O, Kaili, Kaili!  
Kaili, leaf of the koa,  
Graceful as leaf of the koa,  
10 Granddaughter of goddess,  
Whose name is the breath of love,  
Darling of blooming Lehua.  
My lady rides with the gray foam,  
On the surge that enthralls the desire.  
15 I pine for the sylph robed in gauze,  
Who rides on the surf Maka-iwa--  
Aye, cynosure thou of all hearts,  
In all of sacred Wailua.  
Forlorn and soul-empty the house;  
20 You pleasure on the beach Ali-ó;  
Your love is up here in the wildwood.

This mele hoipoipo, love-song, like the one previously given, is from
Kauai. The proper names that abound in it, whether of places, of
persons, or of winds, seem to have been mostly of Kauaian origin,
furnished by its topography, its myths and legends. They have, however,
become the common property of the whole group through having been
interwoven in the national songs that pass current from island to
island.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_295"></span>[135:a](ulh24.htm#fr_301.md) *Ida-wai-kini*. The
name of a rocky bluff that stands on the side of Mount Wai-ale-ale,
looking to Wailua. It is said to divide the flow from the great morass,
the natural reservoir formed by the hollow at the top of the mountain,
turning a part of it in the direction of Wai-niha, a valley not far from
Hanalei, which otherwise would, it is said by Hawaiians, go to swell the
stream that forms the Wailua river. This rock, in the old times, was
regarded as a demigod, a *kupua*, and had a lover who resided in
Wai-lua, also another who resided in the mountains. The words in the
first two or three verses may be taken as if they were the utterance of
this Wai-lua lover, saying "I will go up and see my sweetheart
Ida-wai-kini."

<span id="fn_296"></span>[135:b](ulh24.htm#fr_302.md) *Pihana-ka-lani*.
Literally, the fullness of heaven. This was a forest largely of lehua
that covered the mountain slope below Ka-wai-kini. It seems as if the
purpose of its mention was to represent the beauties and charms of the
human body. In this romantic region lived the famous mythological
princes--*alii kupua* the Hawaiians called them--<span id="page_136">p.
136</span> named *Kaua-kahi-alii* and Aiwohi-kupua, with their princess
sister *Ka-hale-lehua*. The second name mentioned was the one who
married the famous heroine of the romantic story of *Laie-i-ka-wai*.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[136:a](ulh24.htm#fr_303.md) *Manu hulu ma’ema’e*.
An allusion to the great number of plumage birds that were reputed to be
found in this place.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[136:b](ulh24.htm#fr_304.md) *Puna-hale ia
Kaua-kahi-alii*. The birds of the region are said to have been on very
intimate and friendly terms with Kaua-kahi-alii. (See note b, p. 135.)

<span id="fn_299"></span>[136:c](ulh24.htm#fr_305.md) *Kaili*. The full
form is said to be *Ka-ili-lau-o-he-koa*--Skin-like-the-leaf-of-the-koa.
In the text of the mele this name is analyzed into its parts and written
as if the phrase at the end were an appellative and not an integral part
of the name itself. This was a mythical character of unusual beauty, a
person of superhuman power, kupua, a mistress of the art of surf-riding,
which passion she indulged in the waters about Wai-lua.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[136:d](ulh24.htm#fr_306.md)
*Hooipo-i-ha-Malanai*. A mythical princess of Wailua, the grandmother of
Kaili. This oft-quoted phrase, literally meaning to make love in the
(gently-blowing) trade-wind, has become almost a stock expression,
standing for romantic love, or love-making.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[136:e](ulh24.htm#fr_307.md) *Lehua-wehe*. The
piece of ocean near the mouth of the Wailua river in which Kaili
indulged her passion for surf-riding.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[136:f](ulh24.htm#fr_308.md) *Kalu-kalu o Kewá*.
*Kalu-kalu* may mean a species of soft, smooth grass specially fitted
for sliding upon, which flourished on the inclined plain of Kewá, Kauai.
One would sit upon a mat, the butt end of a coconut leaf, or a sled,
while another dragged it along. The Hawaiian name for this sport is
*pahe’e*. *Kalu-kalu* is also the name applied to "a very thin
gauze-like kapa." (See Andrews's Hawaiian Dictionary.) If we suppose the
poet to have clearly intended the first meaning, the figure does not
tally with the following verse, the fifteenth. Verses 14 and 15 would
thus be made to read

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I desire the kalu-kalu (grass) of Kewá,  
That is riding the surf of Maka-iwa.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This is an
impossible figure and makes no sense. If, on the other hand, we take
another version and conceive that the bard had in mind the gauze-like
robe of *kalu-kalu* --using this, of course, as a figure for the person
clad in such a robe--the rendering I have given,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I pine for the sylph robed in gauze,  
who rides the surf Maka-iwa,

</div>

would not only make a possible, but a poetic, picture. Let the critical
reader judge which of these two versions hits closer to common sense and
probability.
