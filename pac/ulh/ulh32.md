# XXVIII.--THE HULA MÚ’U-MÚ’U

The conception of this peculiar hula originated from a pathetic incident
narrated in the story of Hiiaka's journey to bring Prince Lohiau to the
court of Pele. [Hiiaka](errata.htm#9.md), standing with her friend
Wahine-oma’o on the heights that overlooked the beach at Kahakuloa,
Maui, saw the figure of a woman, maimed as to hands and feet, dancing in
fantastic glee on a plate of rock by the ocean. She sang as she danced,
pouring out her soul in an ecstacy that ill became her pitiful
condition; and as she danced her shadow-dance, for she was but a ghost,
poor soul! these were the words she repeated:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Auwé, auwé, mo’ ku’u lima!  
Auwé, auwé, mo’ ku’u lima!

</div>

\[Translation\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Alas, alas, maimed are my hands!  
Alas, alas, maimed are my hands!

</div>

Wahine-oma’o, lacking spiritual sight, saw nothing of this; but Hiiaka,
in downright pity and goodness of impulse, plucked a hala fruit from the
string about her neck and threw it so that it fell before the poor
creature. who eagerly seized it and with the stumps of her hands held it
up to enjoy its odor. At the sight of the woman's pleasure Hiiaka sang:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Le’a wale hoi ka wahine lima-lima ole, wawae ole.  
E ha ana i kana i’a, ku’i-ku’i ana i kana opihi.  
Wa’u-wa’u ana i kana limu, Mana-mana-ia-kalu-é-a.

</div>

\[Translation\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

How pleased is the girl maimed of hand and foot,  
Groping for fish. pounding shells of opihi,  
Kneading her moss. Mana-mana-ia-kalu-éa!

</div>

The answer of the desolate creature, grateful for Hiiaka's recognition
and kind attention, was that pretty mele appropriated by hula folk as
the wreath-song, already given ([p. 56](ulh12.htm#page_56).md), which will
bear repetition:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ke lei mai la o Ka-ula i ke kai, e-e!  
Ke malamalama o Niihau, na malie.  
A malie, pa ka Inu-wai.  
Ke inu mai la na hala o Naue i ke kai.  
5 No Naue ka hala, no Puna ka wahine,  
No ka lua no i Kilauea.

</div>

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

\[Translation\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Kaula wreathes her brow with the ocean;  
Niihau shines forth in the calm.  
After the calm blows the Inu-wai,  
And the palms of Naue drink of the salt.  
5 From Naue the palm, from Puna the maid,  
Aye, from the pit of Kilauea.

</div>

The hula *mu’u-mu’u*, literally the dance of the maimed, has long been
out of vogue, so that the author has met with but one person, and he not
a practitioner of the hula, who has witnessed its performance. This was
in Puna, Hawaii; the performance was by women only and was without
instrumental accompaniment. The actors were seated in a half-reclining
position, or kneeling. Their arms, as if in imitation of a maimed
person, were bent at the elbows and doubled up, so that their gestures
were made with the upper arms. The mele they cantillated went as
follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Pii ana a-áma, <span id="fr_413"></span>[a](#fn_400.md)  
A-áma kai nui,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Black crabs are climbing,  
Crabs from the great sea,  
Sea that is darkling.  
Black crabs and gray crabs  
5 Scuttle o’er the reef-plate.  
Billows are tumbling and lashing,  
Beating and surging nigh.  
Seashells are crawling up;  
And lurking in holes  
10 Are the eels o-ú and o-í.  
But taste the moss akáhakáha,  
Kahiki! how the sea rages!  
The wild sea of Kane!  
The pit-god has come to the ocean,  
15 All consuming, devouring  
By heaps the delicate shellfish!  
Lashing the mount, lashing the sea,  
Lurking place of the goddess.  
Pray hide yourself wholly;  
20 The Pele women are hidden.  
Burst forth now! burst forth!  
Ku with spreading column of smoke!  
Now down to the grove Milo-holu:  
Bathe in waters warmed by the goddess.  
25 Behold, they burn, behold, they burn!

</div>

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The fires of the goddess burn!  
Now for the dance, the dance!  
Bring out the dance made public  
By Mána-mána-ia-kálu-é-a.  
30 Turn about back, turn about face;  
Advance toward the sea;  
Advance toward the land,  
Toward the pit that is Pele's,  
Portentous consumer of rocks in Puna.  
35 Pi and Pa chirp the cricket notes  
Of Pele at home in her pit.  
Have done with restraint!

</div>

The imagery and language of this mele mark the hula to which it belonged
as a performance of strength.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_400"></span>[213:a](ulh32.htm#fr_413.md) *A-áma*. An edible
black crab. When the surf is high it climbs up on the rocks.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[213:b](ulh32.htm#fr_414.md) *Pai-é-a*. An edible
gray crab. The favorite time for taking these crabs is when the high
tide or surf forces them to leave the water for protection.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[213:c](ulh32.htm#fr_415.md) *Pipípi*. A black
seashell (Nerita). With it is often found the *alea-lea*, a gray shell.
These shellfish, like the crabs above mentioned, crawl up the rocks and
cliffs during stormy weather.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[213:d](ulh32.htm#fr_416.md) *O-ú*. A variety of
eel that lurks in holes; it is wont to keep its head lifted. The *o-i´*
(same verse) is an eel that snakes about in the shallow water or on the
sand at the edge of the water.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[213:e](ulh32.htm#fr_417.md) *Akahakaha*. A
variety of moss. If one ate of this as he gathered it, the ocean at once
became tempestuous.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[213:f](ulh32.htm#fr_418.md) Opihi. An edible
bivalve found in the salt waters of Hawaii. Pele is said to have been
very fond of it. There is an old saying, *He akua at opihi o
Pele*--"Pele is a goddess who eats the opihi." In proof of this
statement they point to the huge piles of opihi shells that may he found
along the coast of Puna, the middens, no doubt, of the old-time people.
*Koéle* was a term applied to the opihi that lives well under water, and
therefore are delicate eating. Another meaning given to the word
*koele*--*opihi koele*, line 17--is " heaped up."

<span id="fn_406"></span>[214:a](ulh32.htm#fr_419.md) *Ku ka mahu nui
akea*. The Hawaiians have come to treat this phrase as one word, an
epithet applied to the god Ku. In the author's translation it is treated
as an ordinary phrase.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[214:b](ulh32.htm#fr_420.md) *Milo-hólu*. A grove
of milo trees that stood, as some affirm, about that natural basin of
warm water in Puna, which the Hawaiians called *Wai-wela-wela*.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[214:c](ulh32.htm#fr_422.md) *Pi*, *Pa*. These
were two imaginary little beings who lived in the crater of Kilauea, and
who declared their presence by a tiny shrill piping sound, such,
perhaps, as a stick of green wood will make when burning. Pi was active
at such times as the fires were retreating, Pa when the fires were
rising to a full head.
