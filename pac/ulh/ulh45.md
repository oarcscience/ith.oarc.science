# XLI.--THE WATER OF KANE

If one were asked what, to the English-speaking mind, constitutes the
most representative romantico-mystical aspiration that has been embodied
in song and story, doubtless he would be compelled to answer the legend
and myth of the Holy Grail. To the Hawaiian mind the aspiration and
conception that most nearly approximates to this is that embodied in the
words placed at the head of this chapter, The Water of Kane. One finds
suggestions and hints of this conception in many passages of Hawaiian
song and story, sometimes a phosphorescent flash, answering to the dip
of the poet's blade, sometimes crystallized into a set form; but nowhere
else than in the following mele have I found this jewel deliberately
wrought into shape, faceted, and fixed in a distinct form of speech.

This mele comes from Kauai, the island which more than any other of the
Hawaiian group retains a tight hold on the mystical and imaginative
features that mark the mythology of Polynesia; the island also which
less than any other of the group was dazzled by the glamour of royalty
and enslaved by the theory of the divine birth of kings.

*The Water of Kane*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A query, a question,  
I put to you:  
Where is the water of Kane?  
At the Eastern Gate  
5 Where the Sun comes in at Haehae;  
There is the water of Kane.

A question I ask of you:  
Where is the water of Kane?  
Out there with the floating Sun,

</div>

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

10 Where cloud-forms rest on Ocean's breast.  
Uplifting their forms at Nihoa,  
This side the base of Lehua;  
There is the water of Kane.

One question I put to you:  
15 Where is the water of Kane?  
Yonder on mountain peak,  
On the ridges steep,  
In the valleys deep,  
Where the rivers sweep;  
20 There is the water of Kane.

This question I ask of you:  
Where, pray, is the water of Kane?  
Yonder, at sea, on the ocean,  
In the driving rain,  
25 In the heavenly bow,  
In the piled-up mist-wraith,  
In the blood-red rainfall,  
In the ghost-pale cloud-form;  
There is the water of Kane.

30 One question I put to you:  
Where, where is the water of Kane?  
Up on high is the water of Kane,  
In the heavenly blue,  
In the black piled cloud,  
35 In the black-black cloud.  
In the black-mottled sacred cloud of the gods;  
There is the water of Kane.

One question I ask of you:  
Where flows the water of Kane?  
40 Deep in the ground. in the gushing spring,  
In the ducts of Kane and Loa,  
A well-spring of water, to quaff,  
A water of magic power--  
The water of life!  
45 Life! O give us this life!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_510"></span>[257:a](ulh45.htm#fr_526.md) *Hae-hae*. Heaven's
eastern gate; the portal in the solid walls that supported the heavenly
dome, through which the sun entered in the morning.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[257:b](ulh45.htm#fr_527.md) *Kau-Lana-ka-la*.
When the setting sun, perhaps by an optical illusion drawn out into a
boatlike form, appeared to be floating on the surface of the ocean, the
Hawaiians named the phenomenon *Kau-lana-ka-la*--the floating of the
sun. Their fondness for personification showed itself in the final
conversion of this phrase into something like a proper name, which they
applied to the locality of the phenomenon.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[257:c](ulh45.htm#fr_528.md) *Pae opua i ke kai*.
Another instance of name-giving, applied to the bright clouds that seem
to rest on the horizon, especially to the west.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[257:d](ulh45.htm#fr_529.md) *Nihoa* (Bird
Island). This small rock to the northwest of Kauai, though far below the
horizon, is here spoken of as if it were in sight.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[258:a](ulh45.htm#fr_530.md) *Punohu*. A red
luminous cloud, or a halo, regarded as an omen portending some sacred
and important event.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[258:b](ulh45.htm#fr_531.md) *Ua-koko*. Literally
bloody rain, a term applied to a rainbow when lying near the ground, or
to a freshet-stream swollen with the red muddy water from the wash of
the hillsides. These were important omens, claimed as marking the birth
of tabu chiefs.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[258:c](ulh45.htm#fr_532.md) *Wai kau a Kane me
Kanaloa*. Once when Kane and Kanaloa were journeying together Kanaloa
complained of thirst. Kane thrust his staff into the pali near at hand,
and out flowed a stream of pure water that has continued to the present
day. The place is at Keanae, Maui.
