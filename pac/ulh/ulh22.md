# XVIII. AN INTERMISSION

During the performance of a hula the halau and all the people there
assembled are under a tabu, the imposition of which was accomplished by
the opening prayer that had been offered before the altar. This was a
serious matter, and laid everyone present under the most formal
obligations to commit no breach of divine etiquette; it even forbade the
most innocent remarks and expressions of emotion. But when the
performers, wearied of the strait-jacket, determined to unbend and
indulge in social amenities, to lounge, gossip, and sing informal songs,
to quaff a social bowl of awa, or to indulge in an informal dance, they
secured the opportunity for this interlude by suspending the tabu. This
was accomplished by the utterance of a *pule hoo-noa*, a tabu-lifting
prayer. If the entire force of the tabu was not thus removed, it was at
least so greatly mitigated that the ordinary conversations of life might
be carried on without offense. The pule was uttered by the kumu or some
person who represented the whole company:

*Pule Hoo-noa*

Here also is another pule hoo-noa, a prayer-song addressed to Laka, an
intercession for the lifting of the tabu. It will be noticed that the
request is implied, not explicitly stated. All heads are lifted, all
eyes are directed heavenward or to the altar, and the hands with a
noiseless motion keep time as the voices of the company, led by the
kumu, in solemn cantillation, utter the following prayer:

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

</div>

But even now, when the tabu has been removed and the assembly is
supposed to have assumed an informal character, before they may indulge
themselves in informalities, there remains to be chanted a dismissing
prayer, *pule hooku’u*, in which all voices, must join:

This fragment--two fragments, in fact, pieced together--belongs to the
epic of Pele. As her little sister, Hiiaka, is about to start on her
adventurous journey to bring the handsome Prince Lohiau from the distant
island of Kauai she is overcome by a premonition of Pele's jealousy and
vengeance, and she utters this intercession.

The formalities just described speak for themselves. They mark better
than any comments can do the superstitious devotion of the old-timers to
formalism, their remoteness from that free touch of social and artistic
pleasure, the lack of which we moderns often lament in our own lives and
sigh for as a lost art, conceiving it to have been once the possession
of "the children of nature."

The author has already hinted at the form and character of the
entertainments with which hula-folk sometimes beguiled their
professional interludes. Fortunately the author is able to illustrate by
means of a song the very form of entertainment they provided for
themselves on such an occasion. The following mele, cantillated with an
accompaniment of expressive gesture, is one that was actually given at
an awa-drinking bout indulged in by hula-folk. The author has an account
of its recital at Kahuku, island of Oahu, so late as the year 1849,
during a circuit of that island made by King Kamehameha

reckoned as belonging to the ordinary repertory of the hula; but to
which particular form of the dance it was devoted has not been learned:

Kane is drunken with awa:  
His head is laid on the pillow;  
His body stretched on the neat.  
A trumpet sounds through the fog,  
5 Dimmed are the stars in the sky;  
When the night is clear, how they twinkle!  
Lani-kaula's torches look double,  
The torches that burn for Kane.  
Ghostly and drear the walls of Waipio  
10 At the endless blasts of Kiha-pú.  
The king's awa fails to console him:  
’Tis the all-night conching of Kiha-pú.  
Broken his sleep the whole winter;  
Downcast and sad, sad and downcast,  
15 At loss to find a brave hunter  
Shall steal the dunned conch from the cliff.  
Look, how it gleams \[through the fog\]!

Kane, the chief god of the Hawaiian pantheon, in company with other
immortals, his boon companions, met in revelry on the heights bounding
Wai-pi’o valley. With each potation of awa they sounded a blast upon
their conch-shells, and the racket was almost continuous from the
setting of the sun until drowsiness overcame them or the coming of day
put an end to their revels.

The tumult of sound made it impossible for the priests to perform
acceptably the offices of religion, and the pious king, Liloa, was
distressed beyond measure. The whole valley was disturbed and troubled
with forebodings at the suspension of divine worship.

The chief offender was Kane himself. The trumpet which he held to his
lips was a conch of extraordinary size ([pl. XIV](#img_pl14).md) and
credited with a divine origin and the possession of supernatural power;
its note was heard above all the others. This shell, the famed Kiha-pú,
had been stolen from the heiau of Paka’a-lána, Liloa's temple in Waipi’o
valley, and after many adventures had come into the hands of god Kane,
who used it, as we see, for the interruption of the very services that
were intended for his honor.

The relief from this novel and unprecedented situation came from an
unexpected quarter. King Liloa's awa-patches were found to be suffering
from the nocturnal visits of a thief. A watch was set; the thief proved
to be a dog, Puapua-lenalena, whose master was a confirmed awa-toper.
When master and dog were brought into the presence of King Liloa, the
shrewd monarch divined the remarkable character of the animal, and at
his suggestion the dog was sent on the errand which resulted in the
recovery by stealth of the famed conch Kiha-pú. As a result of his loss
of the conch, Kane put an end to his revels, and the valley of Wai-pi’o
again had peace.

This mele is an admirable specimen of Hawaiian poetry, and may be taken
as representative of the best product of Hawaii's classical period. The
language is elegant and concise, free from the redundancies that so
often load down Hawaiian compositions. No one, it is thought, will deny
to the subject-matter of this mele an unusual degree of interest.

There is a historic side to the story of the conch-shell Kiha-pú. Not
many years ago the Hawaiian Museum contained an ethnological specimen of
great interest, the conch-shell Kiha-pú. It was fringed, after the
fashion of a witch-doll, with strings, beads, and wampum-like bits of
mother-of-pearl, and had great repute as a *kupua* or luck-bringer. King
Kalakaua, who affected a sentimental leaning to the notions of his
mother's race, took possession of this famous "curio" and it disappeared
from public view.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_265"></span>[126:a](ulh22.htm#fr_271.md) *Lehua*. See [plate
XIII](#img_pl13.md).

<span id="fn_266"></span>[126:b](ulh22.htm#fr_272.md) *Ka-ulua*. The name
of the third month of the [Hawaiian](errata.htm#3.md) year. corresponding
to late January or February, a time when in the latitude of Hawaii
nature does not refrain from leafing and flowering.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[126:c](ulh22.htm#fr_273.md) Haumea. The name
applied after her death and apotheosis to Papa, the wife of Wakea, and
the ancestress of the Hawaiian race. (The Polynesian Race, A. Fornander,
I, 205. London, 1878.)

<span id="fn_268"></span>[126:d](ulh22.htm#fr_274.md) It is doubtful to
whom the expression "makua-kane " refers, possibly to Wakea, the husband
of Papa; and if so, very properly termed father, ancestor, of the
people.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[126:e](ulh22.htm#fr_275.md) *Manu o Kaáe*
(*Manu-o-Kaáe* it might be written) is said to have been a goddess, one
of the family of Pele, a sister of the sea [nymph](errata.htm#4.md)
*Moana-nui-ka-lehua*, whose dominion was in the waters between Oahu and
Kauai. She is said to have had the gift of eloquence.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[126:f](ulh22.htm#fr_276.md) *Pe-káu* refers to
the ranks and classes of the gods.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[126:g](ulh22.htm#fr_277.md) *Pé-ka-naná* refers
to men, their ranks and classes.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[128:a](ulh22.htm#fr_278.md) *Pupu we’u-we’u*. A
bouquet. The reference is to the wreaths and floral decorations that
bedecked the altar, and that were not only offerings to the goddess, but
symbols of the diverse forms in which she manifested herself. At the
conclusion of a performance the players laid upon the altar the garlands
they themselves had worn. These were in addition to those which were
placed there before the play began.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[128:b](ulh22.htm#fr_279.md) *Ku-wá*. It has cost
much time and trouble to dig out the meaning of this word. The
fundamental notion is that contained in its two parts, *ku*, to stand,
and *wa*, an interval or space. the whole meaning to arrange or set in
orderly intervals.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[128:c](ulh22.htm#fr_280.md) *La-ká*. A Tahitian
name for the tree which in Hawaii is called *lehua*, or *ohia*. In verse
3 the Hawaiian name *ohia* and the Tahitian *Laká* (accented on the
final syllable, thus distinguishing it from the name of the goddess
*Láka*, with which it has no discoverable connection) are combined in
one form as an appellation of the god *Ku*--*ku-ka-ohia-Laká*. This is a
notable instance of the survival of a word as a sacred epithet in a
liturgy, which otherwise had been lost to the language.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[128:d](ulh22.htm#fr_281.md) *Ku-pulu-pulu*. *Ku*,
the fuzzy or shaggy, a deity much worshiped by canoe-makers, represented
as having the figure of an old man with a long beard. In the sixth verse
the full form of the god's name here given as *Moku-ha-li’i* would be
*Ku-moku-hali’i*, the last part being an epithet applied to *Ku* working
in another capacity. *Moku-hali’i* is the one who bedecks the island.
His special emblem, as here implied, was the *lama*, a beautiful tree,
whose wood was formerly used in making certain sacred inclosures. From
this comes the proper name *Palama*, one of the districts of Honolulu.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[128:e](ulh22.htm#fr_282.md) *Kú-i-kú-i*. The same
as the tree now called *ku-kú-i*, the tree whose nuts were used as
candles and flambeaus. The Samoan name of the same tree is *tú-i-tú-i*.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[129:a](ulh22.htm#fr_283.md) A literal translation
of the first line would be as follows: (Here) stands the doomed
sacrifice for the journey in search of a bed-lover.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[129:b](ulh22.htm#fr_284.md) *Huli-wale*. To turn
about, here used as the name of a place, is evidently intended
figuratively to stand for mental indecision.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[129:c](ulh22.htm#fr_285.md) The bracketed phrase
is not in the text of the original.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[130:a](ulh22.htm#fr_286.md) *Kéha* is in elegant
expression for the side of the head.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[130:b](ulh22.htm#fr_287.md) *Hi’o-lani*,
literally to turn the side to heaven, is a classic expression of
refinement.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[130:c](ulh22.htm#fr_288.md) *Mahana-lua*,
literally to see double, was an accepted test of satisfactory
drunkenness. It reminds the author of an expression he once heard used
by the comedian Clarke in the play of Toddles. While in a maudlin state
from liquor he spoke of the lighted candle that was in his hand as a
"double-barreled candle."

<span id="fn_283"></span>[130:d](ulh22.htm#fr_289.md) *Lani-kaula* was a
prophet who lived on Molokai at a place that still bears his name. He
had his residence in the midst of a grove of tine kukui trees, the
remnants of which remain to this day. Torches made from the nuts of
these trees were supposed to be of superior quality and they furnished
the illumination for the revelries of Kane and his fellows.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[130:e](ulh22.htm#fr_290.md) *He kaula no Kane*. A
literal translation would be, a prophet of Kane.
