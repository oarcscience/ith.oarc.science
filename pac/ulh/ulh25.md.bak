# XXI.--THE MUSIC AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS OF THE HAWAIIANS

A bird is easier captured than the notes of a song. The *mele* and *oli*
of Hawaii's olden time have been preserved for us; but the music to
which they were chanted, a less perdurable essence, has mostly exhaled.
In the sudden transition from the tabu system to the new order of things
that came in with the death of Kamehameha in 1819, the old fashion of
song soon found itself antiquated and outdistanced. Its survival, so far
as it did survive, was rather as a memorial and remembrance of the past
than as a register of the living emotions of the present.

The new music, with its *pa*, *ko*, *li*--answering to our do, re,
mi <span id="fr_309"></span>[a](#fn_303.md)--was soon in everybody's mouth.
From the first it was evidently destined to enact a role different from
that of the old cantillation; none the less the musical ideas that came
in with it, the air of freedom from tabu and priestcraft it breathed,
and the diatonic scale, the highway along which it marched to conquest,
soon produced a noticeable reaction in all the musical efforts of the
people. This new seed, when it had become a vigorous plant, began to
push aside the old indigenous stock, to cover it with new growths, and,
incredible as it may seem, to inoculate it with its own pollen, thus
producing a cross which to-day is accepted in certain quarters as the
genuine article of Hawaiian song. Even now. the people of northwestern
America are listening with demonstrative interest to songs which they
suppose to be those of the old hula, but which in reality have no more
connection with that institution than our negro minstrelsy has to do
with the dark continent.

The one regrettable fact, from a historical point of view, is that a
record was not made of indigenous Hawaiian song before this process of
substitution and adulteration had begun. It is no easy matter now to
obtain the data for definite knowledge of the subject.

While the central purpose of this chapter will be a study of the music
native to old Hawaii, and especially of that produced in the halau,
Hawaiian music of later times and of the present day can not be entirely
neglected; nor will it be without its value for the indirect light it
will shed on ancient conditions and on racial characteristics. The
reaction that has taken place in Hawaii within historic times in

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

response to the stimulus from abroad can not fail to be of interest in
itself.

There is a peculiarity of the Hawaiian speech which can not but have its
effect in determining the lyric tone-quality of Hawaiian music; this is
the predominance of vowel and labial sounds in the language. The phonics
of Hawaiian speech, we must remember, lack the sounds represented by our
alphabetic symbols *b*, *c* or *s*, *d*, *f*, *g*, *j*, *q*, *x*, and
*z*--a poverty for which no richness in vowel sounds can make amends.
The Hawaiian speech, therefore, does not call into full play the
uppermost vocal cavities to modify and strengthen, or refine, the throat
and month tones of the speaker and to give reach and emphasis to his
utterances. When he strove for dramatic and passional effect, he did not
make his voice resound in the topmost cavities of the voice-trumpet, but
left it to rumble and mutter low down in the throat-pipe, thus producing
a feature that colors Hawaiian musical recitation.

This feature, or mannerism, as it might be called, specially marks
Hawaiian music of the bombastic bravura sort in modern times, imparting
to it in its strife for emphasis a sensual barbaric quality. It can be
described further only as a gurgling throatiness, suggestive at times of
ventriloquism, as if the singer were gloating over some wild physical
sensation, glutting his appetite of savagery, the meaning of which is
almost as foreign to us and as primitive as are the mewing of a cat, the
gurgling of an infant, and the snarl of a mother-tiger. At the very
opposite pole of development from this throat-talk of the Hawaiian must
we reckon the highly-specialized tones of the French speech, in which we
find the nasal cavities are called upon to do their full share in
modifying the voice-sounds.

The vocal execution of Hawaiian music, like the recitation of much of
their poetry, showed a surprising mastery of a certain kind of
technique, the peculiarity of which was a sustained and continuous
outpouring of the breath to the end of a certain period, when the lungs
again drank their fill. This seems to have been an inheritance from the
old religious style of prayer-recitation, which required the priest to
repeat the whole incantation to its finish with the outpour of one
lungful of breath. Satisfactory utterance of those old prayer-songs of
the Aryans, the *mantras*, was conditioned likewise on its being a
one-breath performance. A logical analogy may be seen between all this
and that unwritten law, or superstition, which made it imperative for
the heroes and demigods, *kupua*, of Hawaii's mythologic age to
discontinue any unfinished work on the coming of daylight. <span

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

When one listens for the first time to the musical utterance of a
Hawaiian poem, it may seem only a monotonous onflow of sounds faintly
punctuated by the primary rhythm that belongs to accent, but lacking
those milestones of secondary rhythm which set a period to such broader
divisions as distinguish rhetorical and musical phrasing. Further
attention will correct this impression and show that the Hawaiians paid
strict attention not only to the lesser rhythm which deals with the time
and accent of the syllable, but also to that more comprehensive form
which puts a limit to the verse.

With the Hawaiians musical phrasing was arranged to fit the verse of the
mele, not to express a musical idea. The cadencing of a musical phrase
in Hawaiian song was marked by a peculiarity all its own. It consisted
of a prolonged trilling or fluctuating movement called *i’i*, in which
the voice went up and down in a weaving manner, touching the main note
that formed the framework of the melody, then springing away from it for
some short interval--a half of a step, or even some shorter
interval--like an electrified pith-ball, only to return and then spring
away again and again until the impulse ceased. This was more extensively
employed in the oli proper, the verses of which were longer drawn out,
than in the mele such as formed the stock pieces of the hula. These
latter were generally divided into shorter verses.

### MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS

The musical instruments of the Hawaiians included many classes, and
their study can not fail to furnish substantial data for any attempt to
estimate the musical performances, attainments, and genius of the
people.

Of drums, or drum-like instruments of percussion, the Hawaiians had
four:

1\. The *pahu*, or *pahu-hula* ([pl. X](ulh16.htm#img_pl10).md), was a
section of hollowed log. Bread-fruit and coconut were the woods
generally used for this purpose. The tough skin of the shark was the
choice for the drumhead, which was held in place and kept tense by
tightening cords of coconut fiber, that passed down the side of the
cylinder.

The workmanship of the pahu, though rude, was of tasteful design. So far
as the author has studied them, each pahu was constructed with a
diaphragm placed about two-thirds the distance from the head, obtained
by leaving in place a cross section of the log, thus making a closed
chamber of the drum-cavity proper, after the fashion of the kettledrum.
The lower part of the drum also was hollowed out and carved, as will be
seen in the illustration. In the carving of all the specimens examined
the artists have shown a notable fondness for a fenestrated design
representing a series of arches, after the fashion of

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

a two-storied arcade, the haunch of the superimposed arch resting
directly on the crown of that below. In one case the lower arcade was
composed of Roman, while the upper was of Gothic, arches. The grace of
the design and the manner of its execution are highly pleasing, and
suggest the inquiry, Whence came the opportunity for this intimate study
of the arch?

The tone of the palm was produced by striking its head with the
finger-tips, or with the palm of the hand; never with a stick, so far as
the writer has been able to learn. Being both heavy and unwieldly, it
was allowed to rest upon the ground, and, if used alone, was placed to
the front of the operator; if sounded in connection with the instrument
next to be mentioned, it stood at his left side.

The pahu, if not the most original, was the most important instrument
used in connection with the hula. The drum, with its deep and solemn
tones, is an instrument of recognized efficiency in its power to stir
the heart to more vigorous pulsations, and in all ages it has been
relied upon as a means of inspiring emotions of mystery, awe, terror,
sublimity, or martial enthusiasm.

Tradition of the most direct sort ascribes the introduction of the pahu
to La’a--generally known as La’a-mai-Kahiki (La’a-from-Kahiki)--a prince
who flourished about six centuries ago. He was of a volatile,
adventurous disposition, a navigator of some renown, having made the
long voyage between Hawaii and the archipelagoes in the southern
Pacific--Kahiki--not less than twice in each direction. On his second
arrival from the South he brought with him the big drum, the pahu, which
he sounded as he skirted the coast quite out to sea, to the wonder and
admiration of the natives on the land. La’a, being of an artistic
temperament and an ardent patron of the hula, at once gave the divine
art of Laka the benefit of this newly imported instrument. He traveled
from place to place, instructing the teachers and inspiring them with
new ideals. It was he also who introduced into the hula the kaékeéke as
an instrument of music.

2\. The *pu-niu* ([pl. XVI](#img_pl16).md) was a small drum made from the
shell of a coconut. The top part, that containing the eyes, was removed,
and the shell having been smoothed and polished, the opening was tightly
covered with the skin of some scaleless fish--that of the *kala*
(Acanthurus unicornis) was preferred. A venerable kumu-hula states that
it was his practice to use only the skin taken from the right side of
the fish, because he found that it produced a finer quality of sound
than that of the other side. The Hawaiian mind was very insistent on
little matters of this sort--the mint, anise, and cummin of their
system. The drumhead was stretched and placed in position while moist
and flexible, and was then made fast to a ring-shaped
cushion--*poahu*--of fiber or tapa that hugged the base of the shell.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

The Hawaiians sometimes made use of the clear gum of the *kukui* tree to
aid in fixing the drumhead in place.

When in use the pu-niu was lashed to the right thigh for the convenience
of the performer, who played upon it with a thong of braided fibers held
in his right hand (), his left thus being free to manipulate the big
drum that stood on the other side.

Of three pu-niu in the author's collection, one, when struck, gives off
the sound of c+1 below the staff; another that of c+1♯ below the staff,
and a third that of c+2♯ in the staff.

While the grand vibrations of the palm filled the air with their solemn
tremor, the lighter and sharper tones of the pu-niu gave a piquancy to
the effect, adding a feature which may be likened to the sparkling
ripples which the breeze carves in the ocean's swell.

3\. The *ipu*, or *ipu-hula* ([pl. VII](ulh14.htm#img_pl07).md), though not
strictly a drum, was a drumlike instrument. It was made by joining
closely together two pear-shaped gourds of large size in such fashion as
to make a body shaped like a figure 8. An opening was made in the upper
end of

<span id="img_fig02"></span> ![FIG. 2.--Ka, drumstick for pu-niu. (Pl.
XVI.)](img/fig02.jpg.md)  
FIG. 2.--Ka, drumstick for pu-niu. (Pl. XVI.)

the smaller gourd to give exit to the sound. The cavities of the two
gourds were thrown into one, thus making a single column of air, which,
in vibration, gave off a note of clear bass pitch. An ipu of large size
in the author's collection emits the tone of c in the bass. Though of
large volume, the tone is of low intensity and has small carrying power.

For ease in handling, the ipu is provided about its waist with a loop of
cord or tapa, by which device the performer was enabled to manipulate
this bulky instrument with one hand. The instrument was sounded by
dropping or striking it with well-adjusted force against the padded
earth-floor of the Hawaiian house.

The manner and style of performing on the ipu varied with the sentiment
of the mele, a light and caressing action when the feeling was
sentimental or pathetic, wild and emphatic when the subject was such as
to stir the feelings with enthusiasm and passion.

Musicians inform us that the drum--exception is made in the case of the
snare and the kettle drum--is an instrument in which the pitch is a
matter of comparative indifference, its function being to mark the time
and emphasize the rhythm. There are other elements, it

 

<span id="img_pl16"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![PLATE XVI&lt;br&gt;
PU-NIU, A DRUM](tn/pl16.jpg)

PLATE XVI  
PU-NIU, A DRUM  
</span>

 

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

would seem, that must be taken into the account in estimating the value
of the drum. Attention may be directed first to its tone-character, the
quality of its note which touches the heart in its own peculiar way,
moving it to enthusiasm or bringing it within the easy reach of awe,
fear, and courage. Again, while, except in the orchestra, the drum and
other instruments of percussion may require no exact pitch, still this
does not necessarily determine their effectiveness. The very depth and
gravity of its pitch, made pervasive by its wealth of overtones, give to
this primitive instrument a weird hold on the emotions.

This combination of qualities we find well illustrated in the pahu and
the ipu, the tones of which range in the lower registers of the human
voice. The tone-character of the pu-niu, on the other hand, is more
subdued, yet lively and cheerful, by reason in part of the very
sharpness of its pitch, and thus affords an agreeable offset to the
solemnity of the other two.

Ethnologically the palm is of more world-wide interest than any other
member of its class, being one of many varieties of the kettle-drum that
are to be found scattered among the tribes of the Pacific, all of them,
perhaps, harking back to Asiatic forbears, such as the tom-tom of the
Hindus.

The sound of the pahu carries one back in imagination to the dread
sacrificial drum of the Aztec teocallis and the wild kettles of the
Tartar hordes. The drum has cruel and bloody associations. When
listening to its tones one can hardly put away a thought of the many
times they have been used to drown the screams of some agonized
creature.

For more purely local interest, inventive, originality, and simplicity,
the round-bellied ipu takes the palm, a contrivance of strictly
Hawaiian, or at least Polynesian, ingenuity. It is an instrument of
fascinating interest, and when its crisp rind puts forth its volume of
sound one finds his imagination winging itself back to the mysterious
caverns of Hawaiian mythology.

The gourd, of which the ipu is made, is a clean vegetable product of the
fields and the garden, the gift of Lono-wahine--unrecognized daughter of
mother Ceres--and is free from all cruel alliances. No bleating lamb was
sacrificed to furnish parchment for its drumhead. Its associations are
as innocent as the pipes of Pan.

4\. The *Ka-éke-éke*, though not drumlike in form, must be classed as an
instrument of percussion from the manner of eliciting its note. It was a
simple joint of bamboo, open at one end, the other end being left closed
with the diaphragm provided by nature. The tone is produced by striking
the closed end of the cylinder, while held in a vertical position, with
a sharp blow against some solid, nonresonant body, such as the matted
earth floor of the old Hawaiian house. In

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

the author's experiments with the kaékeéke an excellent substitute was
found in a bag filled with sand or earth.

In choosing bamboo for the kaékeéke it is best to use a variety which is
thin-walled and long-jointed, like the indigenous Hawaiian varieties, in
preference to such as come from the Orient, all of which are
thick-walled and short-jointed, and therefore less resonant than the
Hawaiian.

The performer held a joint in each hand, the two being of different
sizes and lengths, thus producing tones of diverse pitch. By making a
proper selection of joints it would be possible to obtain a set capable
of producing a perfect musical scale. The tone of the kaékeéke is of the
utmost purity and lacks only sustained force and carrying power to be
capable of the best effects.

An old Hawaiian once informed the writer that about the year 1850, in
the reign of Kamehameha III, he was present at a hula kaékeéke given in
the royal palace in Honolulu. The instrumentalists numbered six, each
one of whom held two bamboo joints. The old man became enthusiastic as
he described the effect produced by their performance, declaring it to
have been the most charming hula he ever witnessed.

5\. The *úli-ulí* () consisted of a small gourd of the size of one's two
fists, into which were introduced shotlike seeds, such as those of the
canna. In character it was a rattle, a noise-instrument pure and simple,
but of a tone by no means disagreeable to the ear, even as the note
produced by a woodpecker drumming on a log is not without its
pleasurable effect on the imagination.

The illustration of the úliulí faithfully pictured by the artist
reproduces a specimen that retains the original simplicity of the,
instrument before the meretricious taste of modern times tricked it out
with silks and feathers. (For a further description of this instrument,
see [p. 107](ulh17.htm#page_107)..md)

6\. The *pu-íli* was also a variety of the rattle, made by splitting a
long joint of bamboo for half its length into slivers, every alternate
sliver being removed to give the remaining ones greater freedom and to
make their play the one upon the other more lively, The tone is a
murmurous breezy rustle that resembles the notes of twigs, leaves, or
reeds struck against one another by the wind--not at all an unworthy
imitation of nature-tones familiar to the Hawaiian ear.

The performers sat in two rows facing each other, a position that
favored mutual action, in which each row of actors struck their
instruments against those of the other side, or tossed them back and
forth. (For further account of the manner in which the puili was used in
the hula of the same name, see [p. 113](ulh18.htm#page_113)..md)

7\. The *laau* was one of the noise-instruments used in the hula. It
consisted of two sticks of hard resonant wood, the smaller of which

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

was struck against the larger, producing a clear xylophonic note. While
the pitch of this instrument is capable of exact determination, it does
not seem that there was any attempt made at adjustment. A man in the
author's collection, when struck, emits tones the predominant one of
which is d+1 (below the staff).

8\. The *ohe*, or *ohe-hano-ihu* (), is an instrument of undoubted
antiquity. In every instance that has come under the author's
observation the material has been, as its name--*ohe*--signifies, a
simple joint of bamboo, with an embouchure placed about half an inch
from the closed end, thus enabling the player to supply the instrument
with air from his right nostril. In every nose-flute examined there have
been two holes, one 2 or 3 inches away from the embouchure, the older
about a third of the distance from the open end of the flute.

The musician with his left hand holds the end of the pipe squarely
against his lip, so that the right nostril slightly overlaps the edge of
the embouchure. The breath is projected into the embouchure with
modulated force. A nose-flute in the author's collection with the lower
hole open produces the sound of f+1♯; with both holes unstopped

<span id="img_fig03"></span> ![FIG. 3.--Ohe-hano-ihu,
nose-flute.](img/fig03.jpg.md)  
FIG. 3.--Ohe-hano-ihu, nose-flute.

it emits the sound a+2; and when both holes are stopped it produces the
sound of c+2♯, a series of notes which are the tonic, mediant, and
dominant of the chord of F♯ minor.

An ohe played by an old Hawaiian named Keaonaloa, an inmate of the
Lunalilo Home, when both holes were stopped sounded f+1; with the lower
hole open it sounded a+2, and when both holes were open it sounded c+3.

The music made by Keaonaloa with his ohe was curious, but not
soul-filling. We must bear in mind, however, that it was intended only
as an accompaniment to a poetical recitation.

Some fifty or sixty years ago it was not uncommon to see bamboo flutes
of native manufacture in the hands of Hawaiian musicians of the younger
generation. These instruments were avowedly imitations of the D-flute
imported from abroad. The idea of using bamboo for this purpose must
have been suggested by its previous use in the nose-flute.

"The tonal capacity of the Hawaiian nose-flute," says Miss Jennie
Elsner, "which has nothing harsh and strident about it, embraces five
tones, f+1 and g+2 in the middle register, and f+2, g+1, and a+2 an

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

octave above. These flutes are not always pitched to the same key,
varying half a tone or so." On inquiring of the native who kindly
furnished the following illustrations, he stated that he had bored the
holes of his ohe without much measurement, trusting to his intuitions
and judgment.

<span id="img_mu01"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![I--Range of the

The player began with a slow, strongly accented, rhythmical movement,
which continued to grow more and more intricate. Rhythmical diminution
continued in a most astounding manner until a frenzied climax was
reached; in other words, until the player's breath-capacity was
exhausted.

A peculiar effect, as of several instruments being used at the same
time, was produced by the two lower tones being thrown in in wild
profusion, often apparently simultaneously with one of the upper tones.
As the tempo in any one of these increased, the rhythm was lost sight of
and a peculiar syncopated effect resulted. <span

</span>

9\. The pu-á was a whistle-like instrument. It was made from a gourd of
the size of a lemon, and was pierced with three holes, or sometimes only
two, one for the nose, by which it was blown, while

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

the others were controlled by the fingers. This instrument has been
compared to the Italian ocarina.

10\. The *íli-íli* was a noise-instrument pure and simple. It consisted
of two pebbles that were held in the hand and smitten together, after
the manner of castanets, in time to the music of the voices. (See [p.
120](ulh20.htm#page_120)..md)

11\. The *niau-kani*--singing splinter--was a reed-instrument of a rude
sort, made by holding a reed of thin bamboo against a slit cut out in a
larger piece of bamboo. This was applied to the mouth, and the voice
being projected against it produced an effect similar to that of the
jew's harp. (See [p. 132](ulh23.htm#page_132)..md)

12\. Even still more extemporaneous and rustic than any of these is a
modest contrivance called by the Hawaiians *pú-la-í*. It is nothing more
than a ribbon torn from the green leaf of the *ti* plant, say
three-quarters of an inch to an inch in width by 5 or 6 inches long, and
rolled up somewhat after the manner of a lamplighter, so as to form a
squat cylinder an inch or more in length. This was compressed to flatten
it. Placed between the lips and blown into with proper force, it emits a
tone of pure reedlike quality, that varies in pitch, according to the
size of the whistle, from G in the middle register to a shrill piping
note more than an octave above.

The hula girl who showed this simple device offered it in answer to
reiterated inquiries as to what other instruments, besides those of more
formal make already described, the Hawaiians were wont to use in
connection with their informal rustic dances. "This," said she, "was
sometimes used as an accompaniment to such informal dancing as was
indulged in outside the halau." This little rustic pipe, quickly
improvised from the leaf that every Hawaiian garden supplies, would at
once convert any skeptic to a belief in the pipes of god Pan.

13\. The *ukeké*, the one Hawaiian instrument of its class, is a mere
strip of wood bent into the shape of a bow that its elastic force may
keep tense the strings that are stretched upon it. These strings, three
in number, were originally of sinnet, later after the arrival of the
white man, of horsehair. At the present time it is the fashion to use
the ordinary gut designed for the violin or the taro-patch guitar. Every
ukeké seen followed closely a conventional pattern, which argues for the
instrument a historic age sufficient to have gathered about itself some
degree of traditional reverence. One end of the stick is notched or
provided with holes to hold the strings, while the other end is wrought
into a conventional figure resembling the tail of a fish and serves as
an attachment about which to wind the free ends of the strings.

No ukeké seen by the author was furnished with pins, pegs, or any
similar device to facilitate tuning. Nevertheless, the musician does

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

tune his ukeké as the writer can testify from his own observation. This
Hawaiian musician was the one whose performances on the nose-flute are
elsewhere spoken of. When asked to give a sample of his playing on the
ukeké, he first gave heed to his instrument as if testing whether it was
in tune. He was evidently dissatisfied and pulled at one string as if to
loosen it; then, pressing one end of the bow against his lips, he talked
to it in a singing tone, at the same time plucking the strings with a
delicate rib of grass. The effect was most pleasing. The open cavity of
the mouth, acting as a resonator, reenforced the sounds and gave them a
volume and dignity that was a revelation. The lifeless strings allied
themselves to a human voice and became animated by a living soul.

With the assistance of a musical friend it was found that the old
Hawaiian tuned his strings with approximate correctness to the tonic,
the third and the fifth. We may surmise that this self-trained musician
had instinctively followed the principle or rule proposed by
Aristoxenus, who directed a singer to sing his most convenient note, and
then, taking this as a starting point, to time the remainder of his
strings--the Greek kithara, no doubt--in the usual manner from this one.

While the ukeké was used to accompany the mele and the oli, its chief
employment was in serenading and serving the young folk in breathing
their extemporized songs and uttering their love-talk--*hoipoipo*. By
using a peculiar lingo or secret talk of their own invention, two lovers
could hold private conversation in public and pour their loves and
longings into each other's ears without fear of detection--a thing most
reprehensible in savages. This display of ingenuity has been the
occasion for outpouring many vials of wrath upon the sinful ukeké.

Experiment with the ukeké impresses one with the wonderful change in the
tone of the instrument that takes place when its lifeless strings are
brought into close relation with the cavity of the mouth. Let anyone
having normal organs of speech contract his lips into the shape of an O,
make his cheeks tense, and then, with the pulp of his finger as a
plectrum, slap the center of his cheek and mark the tone that is
produced. Practice will soon enable him to render a full octave with
fair accuracy and to perform a simple melody that shall be recognizable
at a short distance. The power and range this acquired will, of course,
be limited by the skill of the operator. One secret of the performance
lies in a proper management of the tongue. This function of the mouth to
serve as a resonant cavity for a musical instrument is familiarly
illustrated in the jew's-harp.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

The author is again indebted to Miss Elsner for the following comments
on the ukeké:

<span class="small">The strings of this ukeké, the Hawaiian fiddle, are
tuned to e+1, to b and to d+1. These three strings are struck nearly
simultaneously, but the sound being very feeble, it is only the first
which, receiving the sharp impact of the blow, gives out enough volume
to make a decided impression.</span>

The early visitors to these islands, as a rule, either held the music of
the savages in contempt or they were unqualified to report on its
character and to make record of it.

We know that in ancient times the voices of the men as well as of the
women were heard at the same time in the songs of the hula. One of the
first questions that naturally arises is, Did the men and the women sing
in parts or merely in unison?

It is highly gratifying to find clear historical testimony on this point
from a competent authority. The quotation that follows is from the pen
of Capt. James King, who was with Capt. James Cook on the latter's last
voyage, in which he discovered the Hawaiian islands (January 18, 1778).
The words were evidently penned after the death of Captain Cook, when
the writer of them, it is inferred, must have succeeded to the command
of the expedition. The fact that Captain King weighs his words, as
evidenced in the footnote, and that he appreciates the bearing and
significance of his testimony, added to the fact that he was a man of
distinguished learning, gives unusual weight to his statements. The
subject is one of so great interest and importance, that the whole
passage is here quoted. <span id="fr_312"></span>[a](#fn_306.md) It adds
not a little to its value that the writer thereof did not confine his
remarks to the music, but enters into a general description of the hula.
The only regret is that he did not go still further into details.

<span class="small">Their dances have a much nearer resemblance to those
of the New Zealanders than of the Otaheitians or Friendly Islanders.
They are prefaced with a slow, solemn song, in which all the party join,
moving their legs, and gently striking their breasts in a manner and
with attitudes that are perfectly easy and graceful; and so far they are
the same with the dances of the Society Islands. When this has lasted
about ten minutes, both the tune and the motions gradually quicken, and
end only by their inability to support the fatigue, which</span>

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

part of the performance is the exact counterpart of that of the New
Zealanders; and (as it is among them) the person who uses the most
violent action and holds out the longest is applauded as the best
dancer. It is to be observed that in this dance the women only took part
and that the dancing of the men is nearly of the same kind with what we
saw at the Friendly Islands; and which may, perhaps, with more
propriety, be called the accompaniment of the songs, with corresponding
and graceful motions of the whole body. Yet as we were spectators of
boxing exhibitions of the same kind with those we were entertained with
at the Friendly Islands, it is probable that they had likewise their
grand ceremonious dances, in which numbers of both sexes assisted.

Their music is also of a ruder kind, having neither flutes nor reeds,
nor instruments of any other sort, that we saw, except drums of various
sizes. But their songs, *which they sing in parts*, and accompany with a
gentle motion of the arms, in the same manner as the Friendly Islanders,
had a very pleasing effect.

To the above Captain King adds this footnote:

As this circumstance of their singing in parts has been much doubted by
persons eminently skilled in music, and would be exceedingly curious if
it was clearly ascertained, it is to be lamented that it can not be more
positively authenticated.

Captain Burney and Captain Phillips of the Marines, who have both a
tolerable knowledge of music, have given it as their opinion they did
sing in parts; that is to say, that they sang together in different
notes, which formed a pleasing harmony.

These gentlemen have fully testified that the Friendly Islanders
undoubtedly studied their performances before they were exhibited
public; that they had an idea of different notes being useful in
harmony; and also that they rehearsed their compositions in private and
threw out the inferior voices before they ventured to appear before
those who were supposed to be judges of their skill in music.

In their regular concerts each man had a bamboo <span
id="fr_313"></span>[a](#fn_307.md) which was of a different length and gave
a different tone. These they beat against the ground, and each
performer, assisted by the note given by this instrument, repeated the
same note, accompanying it with words, by which means it was rendered
sometimes short and sometimes long. In this manner they sang in chorus,
and not only produced octaves to pitch other, according to their species
of voice, but fell on concords such as were not disagreeable to the ear.

Now, to overturn this fact, by the reasoning of persons who did not hear
these performances, is rather an arduous task. And yet there is great
improbability that any uncivilized people should by accident arrive at
this perfection in the art of music, which we imagine can only be
attained by dint of study and knowledge of the system and the theory on
which musical composition is founded. Such miserable jargon as our
country psalm-singers practice, which may be justly deemed the lowest
class of counterpoint, or singing in several parts, can not be acquired
in the coarse manner in which it is performed in the churches without
considerable time and practice. It is, therefore, scarcely credible that
a people, semibarbarous, should naturally arrive at any perfection in
that art which it is much doubted whether the Greeks and Romans, with
all their refinements in music, ever attained, and which the Chinese,
who have been longer civilized than any people on the globe, have not
yet found out.

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span class="small">If Captain Burney (who, by the testimony of his
father, perhaps the greatest musical theorist of this or any other age,
was able to have done it) has written down in European notes the
concords that these people sung, and if these concords had been such as
European ears could tolerate, there would have been no longer doubt of
the fact; but, as it is, it would, in my opinion, be a rash judgment to
venture to affirm that they did or did not understand counterpoint; and
therefore I fear that this curious matter must be considered as still
remaining undecided. (A Voyage to the Pacific Ocean, undertaken by the
command of His Majesty, for making discoveries in the Northern
Hemisphere. Performed under the direction of Captains Cook, Clerke, and
Gore, in His Majesty's ships the Resolution and Discovery, in the years
1776, 1777, 1778, and 1780, 3 volumes, London, 1784, III, 2d ed., 142,
143, 144.)</span>

While we can not but regret that Captain King did not go into detail and
inform us specifically what were the concords those old-time people
"fell on," whether their songs were in the major or minor key, and many
other points of information, he has, nevertheless, put science under
obligations to him by his clear and unmistakable testimony to the fact
that they did arrange their music in parts. His testimony is decisive:
"In this manner they sang in chorus, and not only produced octaves to
each other, according to their species of voice, but fell on concords
such as were not disagreeable to the ear." When the learned doctor
argues that to overturn this fact would be an arduous task, we have to
agree with him--an arduous task indeed. He well knew that one proven
fact can overthrow a thousand improbabilities. "What man has done man
can do" is a true saying; but it does not thence follow that what man
has not done man can not do.

If the contention were that the Hawaiians understood counter-point as a
science and a theory, the author would unhesitatingly admit the
improbability with a readiness akin to that with which he would admit
the improbability that the wild Australian understood the theory of the
boomerang. But that a musical people, accustomed to pitch their voices
to the clear and unmistakable notes of bamboo pipes cut to various
lengths, a people whose posterity one generation later appropriated the
diatonic scale as their own with the greatest avidity and readiness,
that this people should recognize the natural harmonies of sound, when
they had chanced upon them, and should imitate them in their songs--the
improbability of this the author fails to see.

The clear and explicit statement of Captain King leaves little to be
desired so far as this sort of evidence can go. There are, however,
other lines of inquiry that must be developed:

1\. The testimony of the Hawaiians themselves on this matter. This is
vague. No one of whom inquiry has been made is able to affirm positively
the existence of part-singing in the olden times. Most of those with
whom the writer has talked are inclined to the view that the ancient
cantillation was not in any sense part-singing as now practised. One
must not, however, rely too much on such

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

testimony as this, which at the best is only negative. In many cases it
is evident the witnesses do not understand the true meaning and bearing
of the question. The Hawaiians have no word or expression synonymous
with our expression "musical chord." In all inquiries the writer has
found it necessary to use periphrasis or to appeal to some illustration.
The fact must be borne in mind, however, that people often do a thing,
or possess a thing, for which they have no name.

2\. As to the practice among Hawaiians at the present time, no
satisfactory proof has been found of the existence of any case in which
in the cantillations of their own songs the Hawaiians--those
uninfluenced by foreign music--have given an illustration of what can
properly be termed part-singing; nor can anyone be found who can testify
affirmatively to the same effect. Search for it has thus far been as
fruitless as pursuit of the will-o’-the-wisp.

3\. The light that is thrown on this question by the study of the old
Hawaiian musical instruments is singularly inconclusive. If it were
possible, for instance, to bring together a complete set of kaekeeke
bamboos which were positively known to have been used together at one
performance, the argument from the fact of their forming a musical
harmony, if such were found to be the case--or, on the other hand, of
their producing only a haphazard series of unrelated sounds, if such
were the fact--would bring to the decision of the question the
overwhelming force of indirect evidence. Put such an assortment the
author has not been able to find. Bamboo is a frail and perishable
material. Of the two specimens of kaekeeke tubes found by him in the
Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum one was cracked and voiceless; and so the
testimony of its surviving partner was of no avail.

The Hawaiians of the present day are so keenly alive to musical harmony
that it is hardly conceivable that their ancestors two or three
generations ago perpetrated discords in their music. They must either
have sung in unison or hit on "concords such as were not disagreeable to
the ear." If the music heard in the halau to-day in any close degree
resembles that of ancient times--it must be assumed that it does--no
male voice of ordinary range need have found any difficulty in sounding
the notes, nor do they scale so low that a female voice would not easily
reach them.

Granting, then, as we must, the accuracy of Captain King's statement,
the conclusion to which the author of this paper feels forced is that
since the time of the learned doctor's visit to these shores, more than
one hundred and twenty-eight years ago, the art and practice of singing
or cantillating after the old fashion has declined among the Hawaiians.
The hula of the old times, in spite of all the efforts to maintain it,
is becoming more and more difficult of procurement

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

every day. Almost none of the singing that one hears at the so-called
hula performances gotten up for the delectation of sight-seers is
Hawaiian music of the old sort. It belongs rather to the second or third
rattoon-crop, which has sprung up under the influence of foreign
stimuli. Take the published hula songs, such as "*Tomi-tomi*," "*Wahine
Poupou*" and a dozen others that might be mentioned, to say nothing
about the words--the music is no more related to the genuine Hawaiian
article of the old times than is "ragtime" to a Gregorian chant.

The bare score of a hula song, stripped of all embellishments and
reduced by the logic of our musical science to the merest skeleton of
notes, certainly makes a poor showing and gives but a feeble notion of
the song itself--its rhythm, its multitudinous grace-notes, its weird
tone-color. The notes given below offer such a skeletal presentation of
a song which the author heard cantillated by a skilled hula-master. They
were taken down at the author's request by Capt. H. Berger, conductor of
the Royal Hawaiian Baud:

IV--Song from the Hula Pa’i-umauma  
</span>

The same comment may be made on the specimen next to be given as on the
previous one: there is an entire omission of the trills and flourishes
with which the singer garlanded his scaffolding of song, and which
testified of his adhesion to the fashion of his ancestors, the fashion
according to which songs have been sung, prayers recited, brave deeds
celebrated since the time when Pane and Pele and the other gods dipped
paddle for the first time into Hawaiian waters. Unfortunately, in this
as in the previous piece and as in the one next to be given, the singer
escaped the author before he was able to catch the words.

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

Here, again, is a piece of song that to the author's ear bears much the
same resemblance to the original that an oiled ocean in calm would bear
to the same ocean when stirred by a breeze. The fine dimples which gave
the ocean its diamond-flash have been wiped out.

Is it our ear that is at fault? Is it not rather our science of musical
notation, in not reproducing the fractions of steps, the enharmonics
that are native to the note-carving ear of the Chinaman, and that are
perhaps essential to the perfect scoring of an oli or mele as sung by a
Hawaiian?

None of the illustrations thus far given have caught that fluctuating
trilling movement of the voice which most. musicians inter-viewed on the
subject declare to be impossible of representation, while some flout the
assertion that it represents a change of pitch. One is reminded by this
of a remark made by Pietro Mascagni: <span
id="fr_314"></span>[a](#fn_308.md)

<span class="small">The feeling that a people displays in its character,
its habits, its nature, and thus creates an overprivileged type of
music, may be apprehended by a foreign spirit which has become
accustomed to the usages and expressions common from that particular
people. But popular music, \[being\] void of any scientific basis, will
always remain incomprehensible to the foreigner who seeks to study it
technically.</span>

When we consider that the Chinese find pleasure in musical performances
on instruments that divide the scale into intervals less than half a
step, and that the Arabian musical scale included quarter-steps, we
shall be obliged to admit that this statement of Mascagni is not merely
a fling at our musical science.

Here are introduced the words and notes of a musical recitation done
after the manner of the hula by a Hawaiian professional and his wife.
Acquaintance with the Hawaiian language and a feeling for the allusions
connoted in the text of the song would, of course, be a great aid in
enabling one to enter into the spirit of the performance. As these
adjuncts will be available to only a very few

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

of those who will read these words, in the beginning are given the words
of the oli with which he prefaced the song, with a translation of the
same, and then the mele which formed the bulk of the song, also with a
translation, together with such notes and comments as are necessary to
bring one into intellectual and sympathetic relation with the
performance, so far as that is possible under the circumstances. It is
especially necessary to familiarize the imagination with the language,
meaning, and atmosphere of a mele, because the Hawaiian approached song
from the side of the. poet and elocutionist. Further discussion of this
point must, however, be deferred to another division of the subject:

EXPLANATORY REMARKS

The acute or stress accent is placed over syllables that take the accent
in ordinary speech.

A word or syllable italicized indicates drum-down-beat.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

It will be noticed that the stress-accent and the rhythmic accent,
marked by the down-beat, very frequently do not coincide. The time
marked by the drum-down-beat was strictly accurate throughout.

The tune was often pitched on some other key than that in which it is
here recorded. This fact was noted when, from time to time, it was found
necessary to have the singer repeat certain passages.

The number of measures devoted to the *i’i*, or fluctuation, which is
indicated by the wavering line <span id="img_15800"></span>
![](img/15800.jpg), varied from time to time, even when the singer
repeated the same passage. (See remarks on the *i’i*, [p.
140](#page_140)..md)

Redundancies of speech (interpolations) which are in disagreement with
the present writer's text (pp. [155](#page_155)-156.md) are inclosed in
brackets. It will be seen that in the fifth verse he gives the version
*Maka’u ke kanaka i ka lehua* instead of the one given by the author,
which is *Maka’u ka Lehua i ke kanaka*. Each version has its advocates,
and good arguments are made in favor of each.

On reaching the end of a measure that coincided with the close of a
rhetorical phrase the singer, Kualii, made haste to snatch, as it were,
at the first word or syllable of the succeeding phrase. This is
indicated by the word "anticipating," or "anticipatory "--written
*anticip*.--placed over the syllable or word thus snatched.

It was somewhat puzzling to determine whether the tones which this man
sang were related to each other as five and three of the major key, or
as three and one of the minor key. Continued and strained attention
finally made it seem evident that it was the major key which he
intended, i. e., it was f+1 and d+1 in the key of B♭, rather than f+1
and d+1 in the key of D minor.

### ELOCUTION AND RHYTHMIC ACCENT IN HAWAIIAN SONG

In their ordinary speech the Hawaiians were good elocutionists--none
better. Did they adhere to this same system of accentuation in their
poetry, or did they punctuate their phrases and words according to the
notions of the song-maker and the conceived exigencies of poetical
composition? After hearing and studying this recitation of Kualii the
author is compelled to say that he does depart in a great measure from
the accent of common speech and charge his words with intonations and
stresses peculiar to the mele. What artificial influence has come in to
produce this result? Is it from some demand of poetic or of musical
rhythm? Which? It was observed that he substituted the soft sound of *t*
for the stronger sound of *k*, "because," as he explained, "the sound of
the *t* is lighter." Thus he said *te tanata* instead of *ke kanaka*,
the man. The Hawaiian ear has always a delicate feeling for tone-color.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

In all our discussions and conclusions we must bear in mind that the
Hawaiian did not approach song merely for its own sake; the song did not
sing of itself. First in order came the poem, then the rhythm of song
keeping time to the rhythm of the poetry. The Hawaiian sang not from a
mere bubbling up of indefinable emotion, but because he had something to
say for which he could find no other adequate form of expression. The
Hawaiian boy, as he walks the woods, never whistles to keep his courage
up. When he paces the dim aisles of Kaliuwa’a, he sets up an altar and
heaps on it a sacrifice of fruit and flowers and green leaves, but he
keeps as silent as a mouse.

During his performance Kualii cantillated his song while handling a
round wooden tray in place of a drum; his wife meanwhile performed the
dance. This she did very gracefully and in perfect time. In marking the
accent the left foot was, if anything, the favorite, yet each foot in
general took two measures; that is, the left marked the down-beat in
measures 1 and 2, 5 and 6, and so on, while the right, in turn, marked
the rhythmic accent that comes with the down-beat in measures 3 and 4, 7
and 8, and so on. During the four steps taken by the left foot, covering
the time of two measures, the body was gracefully poised on the other
foot. Then a shift was made, the position was reversed, and during two
measures the emphasis came on the right foot.

The motions of the hands, arms, and of the whole body, including the
pelvis--which has its own peculiar orbital and sidelong swing were in
perfect sympathy one part with another. The movements were so
fascinating that one was at first almost hypnotized and disqualified for
criticism and analytic judgment. Not to derogate from the propriety and
modesty of the woman's motions, under the influence of her Delsartian
grace one gained new appreciation of "the charm of woven paces and of
waving hands."

Throughout the whole performance of Kualii and his wife Abigaila it was
noticed that, while he was the reciter, she took the part of the olapa
(see [p. 28](ulh08.htm#page_28).md) and performed the dance; but to this
rôle she added that of prompter, repeating to him in advance the words
of the next verse, which he then took up. Her verbal memory, it was
evident, was superior to his.

Experience with Kualii and his partner, as well as with others,
emphasizes the fact that one of the great difficulties encountered in
the attempt to write out the slender thread of music (*leo*) of a
Hawaiian mele and fit to it the words as uttered by the singer arises
from the constant interweaving of meaningless vowel sounds. This, which
the Hawaiians call *i’i*, is a phenomenon comparable to the weaving of a
vine about a framework, or to the pen-flourishes that

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

illuminate old German text. It consists of the repetition of a vowel
sound--generally *i* (= *ee*) or *e* (= *a*, as in fate), or a rapid
interchange of these two. To the ear of the author the pitch varies
through an interval somewhat less than a half-step. Exactly what is the
interval he can not say. The musicians to whom appeal for aid in
determining this point has been made have either dismissed it for the
most part as a matter of little or no consequence or have claimed the
seeming variation in pitch was due simply to a changeful stress of voice
or of accent. But the author can not admit that the report of his senses
is here mistaken.

A further embarrassment comes from the fact that this tone-embroidery
found in the i’i is not a fixed quantity. It varies seemingly with the
mood of the singer, so that not unfrequently, when one asks for the
repetition of a phrase, it will, quite likely, be given with a somewhat
different wording, calling for a readjustment of the rhythm on the part
of the musician who is recording the score. But it must be acknowledged
that the singer sticks to his rhythm, which, so far as observed, is in
common time.

In justice to the Hawaiian singer who performs the accommodating task
just mentioned it must be said that, under the circumstances in which he
is placed, it is no wonder that at times he departs front the
prearranged formula of song. His is the difficult task of pitching his
voice and maintaining the same rhythm and tempo unaided by instrumental
accompaniment or the stimulating movements of the dance. Let any
stage-singer make the attempt to perform an aria, or even a simple
recitative, off the stage, and without the support--real or
imaginary--afforded by the wonted orchestral accompaniment as well as
the customary stage-surroundings, and he will be apt to find himself
embarrassed. The very fact of being compelled to repeat is of itself
alone enough to disconcert almost anyone. The men and women who to-day
attempt the forlorn task of reproducing for us a hula mele or an oli
under what are to them entirely unsympathetic and novel surroundings
are, as a rule, past the prime of life, and not unfrequently acknowledge
themselves to be failing in memory.

After making all of these allowances we must, it would seem, make still
another allowance, which regards the intrinsic nature and purpose of
Hawaiian song. It was not intended, nor was it possible under the
circumstances of the case, that a Hawaiian song should be sung to an
unvarying tempo or to the same key; and even in the words or sounds that
make up its fringework a certain range of individual choice was allowed
or even expected of the singer. This privilege of exercising
individuality might even extend to the solid framework of the mele or
oli and not merely to the filigree, the i’i, that enwreathed it.

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

It would follow from this, if the author is correct, that the musical
critic of to-day must be content to generalize somewhat and must not be
put out if the key is changed on repetition and if tempo and rhythm
depart at times from their standard gait. It is questionable if even the
experts in the palmy days of the hula attained such a degree of skill as
to be faultless and logical in these matters.

It has been said that modern music has molded and developed it-self
under the influence of three causes, (1) a comprehension of the nature
of music itself, (2) a feeling or inspiration, and (3) the influence of
poetry. Guided by this generalization, it may be said that Hawaiian
poetry was the nurse and pedagogue of that stammering infant, Hawaiian
music; that the words of the mele came before its rhythmic utterance in
song; and that the first singers were the priests and the eulogists.
Hawaiian poetry is far ahead of Hawaiian song in the power to move the
feelings. A few words suffice the poet with which to set the picture
before one's eyes, and one picture quickly follows another; whereas the
musical attachment remains weak and colorless, reminding one of the
nursery pictures, in which a few skeletal lines represent the human
frame.

Let us now for refreshment and in continued pursuit of our subject
listen to a song in the language and spirit of old-time Hawaii,
composed, however, in the middle of the nineteenth century. It is given
as arranged by Miss Lillian Byington, who took it down as she heard it
sung by an old Hawaiian woman in the train of Queen Liliuokalani, and as
the author has since heard it sung by Miss Byington's pupils of the
Kamehameha School for Girls. The song has been slightly idealized,
perhaps, by trimming away some of the superfluous i’i, but not more than
is necessary to make it highly acceptable to our ears and not so much as
to take from it the plaintive bewitching tone that pervades the
folk-music of Hawaii. The song, the mele, is not in itself much--a hint,
a sketch, a sweep of the brush, a lilt of the imagination, a connotation
of multiple images which no jugglery of literary art can transfer into
any foreign speech. Its charm, like that of all folk-songs and of all
romance, lies in its mysterious tug at the heartstrings.

*A Name-song of Kamehameha*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

In Waipi’o stands Paka’alana,  
The sacred shrine of Liloa.  
Love to the woman climbing the steep,  
Who gathered the ulei berries,  
5 Who ate of the uncooked herbs of the wild,  
Craving the swaying fruit like a hungry child.  
A covert I found from the storm,  
Life in my sea of delight.

</div>

The text of this mele--said to be a name-song of Kamehameha V--as first
secured had undergone some corruption which obscured the meaning. By
calling to his aid an old Hawaiian in whose memory the song had long
been stored the author was able to correct it. Hawaiian authorities are
at variance as to its meaning. One party reads in it an exclusive
allusion to characters that have flitted across the stage within the
memory of people now living, while another, taking a more romantic and
traditional view, finds in it a reference to an old-time myth--that of
*Ke-anini-ula-o-ka-lani*--the chief character in which was *Haina-kolo*.
(See note *e*.) After carefully considering both sides of the question
it seems to the author that, while the principle of double allusion, so
common in Hawaiian poetry, may here prevail, one is justified in giving
prominence to the historico-mythological interpretation that is inwoven
in the poem. It is a comforting thought that adhesion to this decision
will suffer certain unstaged actions of crowned heads to remain in
charitable oblivion.

The music of this song is an admirable and faithful interpretation of
the old Hawaiian manner of cantillation, having received at the hands of
the foreign musician only so much trimming as was necessary to idealize
it and make it reducible to our system of notation.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

*Hoaeae*.--This term calls for a quiet, sentimental style of recitation,
in which the fluctuating trill i’i, if it occurs at all, is not made
prominent. It is contrasted with the *olioli*, in which the style is
warmer and the fluctuations of the i’i are carried to the extreme.

Thus far we have been considering the traditional indigenous music of
the land. To come now to that which has been and is being produced in
Hawaii by Hawaiians to-day, under influences from abroad, it will not be
possible to mistake the presence in it of two strains: The foreign,
showing its hand in the lopping away of much redundant foliage, has
brought it largely within the compass of scientific and technical
expression; the native element reveals itself, now in

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

plaintive reminiscence and now in a riotous *bonhommie*, a rollicking
love of the sensuous, and in a style of delivery and vocal technique
which demands a voluptuous throatiness, and which must be heard to be
appreciated.

The foreign influence has repressed and well-nigh driven from the field
the monotonous fluctuations of the i’i, has lifted the starveling
melodies of Hawaii out of the old ruts and enriched them with new notes,
thus giving them a spring and *élan* that appeal alike to the cultivated
ear and to the popular taste of the day. It has, moreover, tapped the
springs of folk-song that lay hidden in the Hawaiian nature. This same
influence has also caused to germinate a Hawaiian appreciation of
harmony and has endowed its music with new chords, the tonic and
dominant, as well as with those of the subdominant and various minor
chords.

The persistence of the Hawaiian quality is, however, most apparent in
the language and imagery of the song-poetry. This will be seen in the
text of the various mele and oli now to be given. Every musician will
also note for himself the peculiar intervals and shadings of these
melodies as well as the odd effects produced by rhythmic syncopation.

The songs must speak for themselves. The first song to be given, though
dating from no longer ago than about the sixth decade of the last
century, has already scattered its wind-borne seed and reproduced its
kind in many variants, after the manner of other folklore. This
love-lyric represents a type, very popular in Hawaii, that has continued
to grow more and more personal and subjective in contrast with the
objective epic style of the earliest Hawaiian mele.

*Poli Anuanu*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. Aloha wale oe,  
Poli anuanu;

</div>

He who would translate this love-lyric for the ear as well as for the
mind finds himself handicapped by the limitations of our English
speech--its scant supply of those orotund vowel sounds which flow forth
with their full freight of breath in such words as *a-ló-ha*, *pó-li*,
and *á-nu-á-nu*. These vocables belong to the very genius of the
Hawaiian tongue.

*Cold Breast*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. Love fain compels to greet thee,  
Breast so cold, so cold.  
Chilled, benumbed am I  
With the pinching cold.

2\. How bitter cold the rainfall,  
Bitter cold the stream,  
Body all a-shiver,  
From the pinching cold.

3\. Pray, what think you?  
What if you and I  
Should our arms enfold,  
Just to keep off the cold?

</div>

The song next given, dating from a period only a few years subsequent,
is of the same class and general character as Poli Anuanu. Both words
and music are peculiarly Hawaiian, though one may easily detect the
foreign influence that presided over the shaping of the melody.

The fragments of Hawaiian music that have drifted down to us no doubt
remain true to the ancient type, however much they may have changed in
quality. They show the characteristics that stamp all primitive
music--plaintiveness to the degree almost of sadness, monotony, lack of
acquaintance with the full range of intervals that make up our diatonic
scale, and therefore a measurable absence of that ear-charm we call
melody. These are among its deficiencies.

If, on the other hand, we set down the positive qualities by the
possession of which it makes good its claim to be classed as music, we
shall find that it has a firm hold on rhythm. This is indeed one of the
special excellencies of Hawaiian music. Added to this, we find that it
makes a limited use of such intervals as the third, fifth, fourth, and
at the same time resorts extravagantly, as if in compensation, to a fine
tone-carving that divides up the tone-interval into fractions so much
less than the semitone that our ears are almost indifferent to them, and
are at first inclined to deny their existence. This minute division of
the tone, or step, and neglect at the same time of the broader harmonic
intervals, reminds one of work in which the artist charges his picture
with unimportant detail, while failing in attention to the strong
outlines. Among its merits we must not forget to mention a certain
quality of tone-color which inheres in the Hawaiian tongue and which
greatly tends to the enhancement of Hawaiian music, especially when
thrown into rhythmic forms.

The first thing, then, to repeat, that will strike the auditor on
listening to this primitive music will be its lack of melody. The voice
goes wavering and lilting along like a canoe on a rippling ocean.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then, of a sudden,
it swells upward, as if lifted by some wave of emotion; and there for a
time it travels with the same fluctuating movement, soon descending to
its old monotone, until again moved to rise on the breast of some fresh
impulse. The intervals sounded may be, as already said, a third, or a
fifth, or a fourth; but the whole movement leads nowhere; it is an
unfinished sentence. Yet, in spite of all these drawbacks and of this
childish immaturity, the amateur and enthusiast finds himself charmed
and held as if in the clutch of some Old-World spell, and this at what
others will call the dreary and monotonous intoning of the savage.

In matters that concern the emotions it is rarely possible to trace with
certainty the lines that lead up from effect to cause. Such is the
nature of art. If we would touch the cause which lends attractiveness to
Hawaiian music, we must look elsewhere than to melody. In the belief of
the author the two elements that conspire for this end are rhythm and
tone-color, which comes of a delicate feeling for vowel-values.

The hall-mark of Hawaiian music is rhythm, for the Hawaiians be-long to
that class of people who can not move hand or foot or perform any action
except they do it rhythmically. Not alone in poetry and music and the
dance do we find this recurring accent of pleasure, but in every action
of life it seems to enter as a timekeeper and regulator, whether it be
the movement of a fingerful of poi to the mouth or the swing of a
*kahili* through the incense-laden air at the burial of a chief.

The typical Hawaiian rhythm is a measure of four beats, varied at times
by a 2-rhythm, or changed by syncopation into a 3-rhythm.

These people have an emotional susceptibility and a sympathy with
environment that belongs to the artistic temperament; but their
feelings, though easily stirred, are not persistent and ideally
centered; they readily wander away from any example or pattern. In this
way may be explained their inclination to lapse from their own standard
of rhythm into inexplicable syncopations.

As an instance of sympathy with environment, an experience with a hula
dancer may be mentioned. Wishing to observe the movement of the dance in
time with the singing of the mele, the author asked him to perform the
two at one time. He made the attempt, but failed. At length, bethinking
himself, he drew off his coat and bound it about his loins after the
fashion of a pa-ú, such as is worn by hula dancers. He at once caught
inspiration, and was thus enabled to perform the double rule of dancer
and singer.

It has been often remarked by musical teachers who have had experience
with these islanders that as singers they are prone to flat the tone and
to drag the time, yet under the stimulus of emotion they show the
ability to acquit themselves in these respects with great credit. The
native inertia of their being demands the spur of excitement

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

to keep them up to the mark. While human nature everywhere shares in
this weakness, the tendency seems to be greater in the Hawaiian than in
some other races of no higher intellectual and esthetic advancement.

Another quality of the Hawaiian character which reenforces this tendency
is their spirit of communal sympathy. That is but another way of saying
that they need the stimulus of the crowd, as well as of the occasion,
even to make them keep step to the rhythm of their own music. In all of
these points they are but an epitome of humanity.

Before closing this special subject, the treatment of which has grown to
an unexpected length, the author feels constrained to add one more
illustration of Hawaii's musical productions. The Hawaiian national hymn
on its poetical side may be called the last appeal of royalty to the
nation's feeling of race-pride. The music, though by a foreigner, is
well suited to the words and is colored by the environment in which the
composer has spent the best years of his life. The whole production
seems well fitted to serve as the clarion of a people that need every
help which art and imagination can offer.

the valley within walls, while the dark foreshortened vault of heaven
covers it as with a roof.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[155:b](ulh25.htm#fr_316.md) *Kumano*. A

that was run out into a stream for the purpose of diverting a portion of
it into a new channel.

doorsill (of this temple), always an object of superstitious regard, but
especially so in the case of this temple. Here it stands for the whole
temple.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[162:d](ulh25.htm#fr_323.md) *Liloa*. A famous
king of Hawaii who had his seat in Waipi’o.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[162:e](ulh25.htm#fr_324.md) *Wahine pii ka pali*.
Haina-kolo, a mythical character. is probably the one alluded to. She
married a king of Kukulu o Kahiki, and. being deserted by him, swam back
to Hawaii. Arrived at Waipi’o in a famishing state, she climbed the
heights and ate of the *ulei* berries without first propitiating the
local deity with a sacrifice. As an infliction of the offended deity,
she became distraught and wandered away into the wilderness. Her husband
repented of his neglect and after long search found her. Under kind
treatment she regained her reason and the family was happily reunited.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[162:f](ulh25.htm#fr_325.md) *Lau laau*. Leaves of
plants.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[162:g](ulh25.htm#fr_326.md) *Hoolaau*. The last
part of this word, *laau*, taken in connection with the last word of the
previous verse, form a capital instance of word repetition. This was an
artifice much used in Hawaiian poetry, both as a means of imparting
tone-color and for the punning wit it was supposed to exhibit.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[162:h](ulh25.htm#fr_327.md) *Ua pe’e pa Kai-a-ulu
a Waimea*. *Kai-a-ulu* is a fierce rain-squall such as arises suddenly
in the uplands of Waimea, Hawaii. The traveler, to protect himself,
crouches (*pe’e*) behind a hummock of grass, or builds up in all haste a
barricade (*pa*) of light stuff as a partial shelter against the
oncoming storm.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[162:i](ulh25.htm#fr_328.md) *Kai*. Taken in
connection with *Kai-a-ulu* in the preceding verse, this is another
instance of verse repetition. This word, the primary meaning of which is
