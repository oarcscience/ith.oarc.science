<p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></A></p>  <h1 align="center">XXV.--THE HULA PA&#8217;I-UMAUMA</h1>  
<p>The hula <i>pa&#8217;i-umauma</i>--chest-beating hula--called also hula <i>Pal&aacute;ni</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_379"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A> was an energetic dance, in which the actors, who were also the singers, maintained a kneeling position, with the buttocks at times resting on the heels. In spite of the restrictions imposed by this attitude, they managed to put a spirited action into the performance; there were vigorous gestures, a frequent smiting of the chest with the open hand, and a strenuous movement of the pelvis and lower part of the body called <i>ami</i>. This consisted of rhythmic motions, sidewise, backward, forward, and in a circular or elliptical orbit, all of which was done with the precision worthy of an acrobat, an accomplishment attained only after long practice. It was a hula of classic celebrity, and was performed without the accompaniment of instrumental music.</p>  
<p>In the mele now to be given the poet calls up a succession of pictures by imagining himself in one scenic position after another, beginning at Hilo and passing in order from one island to another--omitting, however, Maui--until he finds himself at Kilauea, an historic and traditionally interesting place on the windward coast of the garden-island, Kauai. The order of travel followed by the poet forbids the supposition that the Kilauea mentioned is the great caldera of the volcano on Hawaii in which Pele had her seat.</p>  
<p>It is useless to regret that the poet did not permit his muse to tarry by the way long enough to give us something more than a single eyeshot at the quickly shifting scenes which unrolled themselves before him, that so he might have given us further reminiscence of the lands over which his Pegasus bore him. Such completeness of view, however, is alien to the poesy of Hawaii.</p>

<p>In the next mele to be given it is evident that, though the motive is clearly Hawaiian, it has lost something of the rugged simplicity and impersonality that belonged to the most archaic style, and that it has taken on the sentimentality of a later period.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Mele</i></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Come now, Manono,<br> Come, Manono, I say,<br> Take up the burden;<br> Through groves of pandanus<br> 5 And wild stag-horn fern,<br> Wearisome fern, lies our way.<br> Arrived at the hill-top,<br> We'll smooth out the nest,<br> That we may snug close.</p>

<p>Manono was the name of the brave woman, wife of Ke-kua-o-ka-lani, who fell in the battle of Kuamo&#8217;o, in Kona, Hawaii, in 1819, fighting by the side of her husband. They died in support of the cause of law and order, of religion and tabu, the cause of the conservative party in Hawaii, as opposed to license and the abolition of all restraint.</p>  
<p>The <i>uluhe</i> (verses 5, 6) is the stag-horn fern, which forms a matted growth most obstructive to woodland travel. The burden Manono is asked to bear, what else is it but the burden of life, in this case lightened by love?</p>  
<p>Whether there is any connection between the name of the hula--breast-beating--and the expression in the first verse of the following mele is more than the author can say.</p>

<p>The thread of interest that holds together the separate pictures composing this mele is slight. It will, perhaps, give to the whole a more definite meaning if we recognize that it is made up of snapshots at various objects and localities that presented themselves to one passing along the old road from Kah&uacute;ku, on Oahu, to the high land which gave the tired traveler his first distant view of Honolulu before he entered the winding canyon of Moana-lua.</p>

Miko-lo-l&oacute;u, when his hosts denied him human flesh, helped himself. In the conflict that rose the Ewa sharks joined with their human relatives and friends on land to put an end to Miko-lo-l&oacute;u. After a fearful contest they took him and reduced his body to ashes. A dog, however, snatched and ate a portion--some say the tongue, some the tail--and another part fell into the water.
