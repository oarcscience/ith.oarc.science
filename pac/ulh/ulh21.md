# XVII.--THE HULA KÁ-ÉKE-ÉKE

The *kaekeeke* was a formal hula worthy of high consideration. Some
authorities assert that the performers in this dance were chosen from
the hoopaa alone, who, it will be remembered, maintained the kneeling
position, while, according to another authority, the olapa also took
part in it. There is no reason for doubting the sincerity of both these
witnesses. The disagreement probably arose from hasty generalization.
One is reminded of the wise Hawaiian saw, already noted, "Do not think
that, your halau holds all the knowledge."

This hula took its name from the simple instrument that formed its
musical accompaniment. This consisted of a single division of the
long-jointed bamboo indigenous to Hawaii, which was left open at one
end. (The varieties of bamboo imported from China or the East Indies
have shorter joints and thicker walls, and will not answer the purpose,
being not sufficiently resonant.) The joints used in the kaekeeke were
of different sizes and lengths, thus producing tones of various pitch.
The performer held one in each hand and the tone was elicited by
striking the base of the cylinder sharply against the floor or some
firm, nonresonant body.

On making actual trial of the kaekeeke, in order to prove by experience
its musical quality and capabilities, the writer's pleasure was as great
as his surprise when he found it capable of producing musical tones of
great purity and of the finest quality. Experiment soon satisfied him
that for the best production of the tone it was necessary to strike the
bamboo cylinder smartly upon some firm, inelastic substance, such as a
bag of sand. The tone produced was of crystalline purity, and by varying
the size and length of the cylinders it proved possible to represent a
complete musical scale. The instrument was the germ of the modern organ.

The first mele to be presented partakes of the nature of the allegory. a
form of composition not a little affected by the Hawaiians:

*Mele*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A Hamakua au.  
Noho i ka ulu hala.  
Malihini au i ka hiki ana.  
I ka ua pe’epe’e i pohaku.  
5 Noho oe a li’u-li’u,  
A luli-luli malie iho. <span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

He keiki akamai ko ia pali;  
Elima no pua i ka lima.  
Kui oe a lawa

Malama malie oe i ka makemake,  
I lei hooheno no ke aloha ole.

Moe oe a ala mai;  
Nana iho oe i kou pono.  
15 Hai'na ia ka puana:  
Keiki noho pali o Hamakua;  
A waka-waka, a waka-waka.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It was in Hamakua;  
I sat in a grove of Pandanus,  
A stranger at my arrival,  
A rock was my shelter from rain.  
5 I found it a wearisome wait,  
Cautiously shifting about.

There's a canny son of the cliff  
That has five buds to his hand.  
You shall twine me a wreath of due length,  
10 A wreath to encircle my love,  
Whilst you hold desire in strong curb,  
Till love-touch thaws the cold-hearted.

When you rise from sleep on the mat,  
Look down, see the conquest of love.  
15 The meaning of this short story?  
What child fondly clings to the cliff?  
Waka-waka, the shell-fish.

</div>

The scene of this idyl, this love-song, *mele hoipoipo*, is Hamakua, a
district on the windward side of Hawaii, subject to rain-squalls. The
poet in his allegory represents himself as a stranger sitting in a
pandanus grove, *ulu hala* (verse 2); sheltering himself from a
rain-squall by crouching behind a rock, *ua pe’epe’e pohaku* (verse 4);
shifting about on account of the veering of the wind, *luli-luli malie
iho* (verse 6). Interpreting this figuratively, Hamakua, no doubt, is
the woman in the case; the grove an emblem of her personality and
physical charms; the rain-squall, of her changeful moods and passions.
The shifting about of the traveler to meet the veering of the wind would
seem to mean the man's diplomatic efforts to deal with the woman's
varying caprices and outbursts.

He now takes up a parable about some creature, a child of the
cliff--Hamakua's ocean boundary is mostly a precipitous wall--which he
represents as a hand with five buds. Addressing it as a servant, he bids
this creature twine a wreath sufficient for his love, *kui oe a* 

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

*lawa* (verse 9), *I lei no ku’u aloha* (verse 10). This creature with
five buds, what is it but the human hand, the errand-carrier of man's
desire, *makemake* (verse 11)? The pali, by the way, is a figure often
used by Hawaiian poets to mean the glory and dignity of the human body.

That is a fine imaginative touch in which the poet illustrates the power
of the human hand to kindle love in one that is cold-hearted, as if he
had declared the hand itself to be not only the wreath-maker, but the
very wreath that is to encircle and warm into response the unresponsive
loved one, *I lei hooheno no ke aloha ole* (verse 12).

Differences of physical environment, of social convention, of accepted
moral and esthetic standards interpose seemingly impassable barriers
between us and the savage mind, but at the touch of an all-pervading
human sympathy these barriers dissolve into very thin air.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Kahiki-nui, land of wind-driven smoke!  
Mine eyes gaze with longing on Kona;  
A fire-wreath glows aback of the district,  
And a robe of wonderful green  
5 Lies the sea that has aproned my loins  
Off the point of Hana-maló.  
A dark burnished form is Hawaii,  
To one who stands on the mount--  
A hamper swung down from heaven,  
10 A beautiful carven shape is the island--  
Thy mountains, thy splendor of herbage:  
Mauna-kea and Loa stand (in glory) apart,  
To him who looks from Maile-hahei;  
And Kilohana pillows for rest  
15 On the shoulder of Hu'e-hu'e.

</div>

This love-song--*mele hoipoipo*--which would be the despair of a strict
literalist--what is it all about? A lover in Kahiki-nui of the softer
sex, it would appear--looks across the wind-swept channel and sends her
thoughts lovingly, yearningly, over to Kona of Hawaii, which district
she personifies as her lover. The mountains and plains, valleys and
capes of its landscapes, are to her the parts and features of her
beloved. Even in the ocean that flows between her and him, and which has
often covered her nakedness as with a robe, she finds a link in the
chain of association.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_256"></span>[124:a](ulh21.htm#fr_260.md) *Auwahi* (a word not
found in any dictionary) is said by a scholarly Hawaiian to be au
archaic form of the word *uwahi*, or *uahi* (milk of fire), smoke,
*Kahiki-nui* is a dry region and the wind (*makani*) often fills the air
with dust.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[124:b](ulh21.htm#fr_261.md) *Kua lei ahi*. No
Hawaiian has been found who professes to know the true meaning of these
words. The translation of them here given is, therefore, purely formal.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[124:c](ulh21.htm#fr_262.md) *Pa-ú halaká*. An
expression sometimes applied to the hand when used as a shield to one's
modesty; here it is said of the ocean (hat) when one's body is immersed
in it.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[124:d](ulh21.htm#fr_263.md) *Hana-maló*. A cape
that lies between Kawaihae and Kailua in north Kona.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[124:e](ulh21.htm#fr_264.md) *Ewa lewá*. In this
reading the author has followed the authoritative suggestion of a
Hawaiian expert, substituting it for that first given by another, which
was *elewa*. The latter was without discoverable meaning. Even as now
given conjectures as to its meaning are at variance. The one followed
presents the less difficulty.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[124:f](ulh21.htm#fr_265.md) *Palamoa*. The name
of a virulent *kupua* that acted as errand-carrier and agent for
sorcerers (*kahuna ánaaná*); also the name of a beautiful grass found on
Hawaii that has a pretty red seed. Following the line of least
resistance, the latter meaning has been adopted; in it is found a
generic expression for the leafy covering of the island.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[124:g](ulh21.htm#fr_267.md) *Mauna-kea* and
*Mauna-loa*. The two well-known mountains of the big island of Hawaii.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[124:h](ulh21.htm#fr_268.md) *Maile-hahei*. Said
to be a hill in Kona.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[124:i](ulh21.htm#fr_270.md) *Kilohana* and
*Hu'e-hu'e*. The names of two hills in Kona, Hawaii.
