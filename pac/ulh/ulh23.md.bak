# XIX.--THE HULA NIAU-KANI

The hula *niau-kani* was one of the classic dances of the halau, and
took its name from the musical instrument that was its accompaniment.
This was a simple, almost extemporaneous, contrivance, constructed, like
the jew's-harp, on the principle of a reed instrument. It was made of
two parts, a broad piece of bamboo with a longitudinal slit at one end
and a thin narrow piece of the same material, the reed, which was held
firmly against the fenestra on the concave side of part number one. The
convexity of the instrument was pressed against the lips and the sound
was produced by projecting the breath through the slit in a speaking or
singing tone in such a way as to cause vibrations in the reed. The
manner of constructing and operating this reed instrument is suggestive
of the jew's-harp. It is asserted by those who should know that the
niau-kani was an instrument of purely Hawaiian invention.

The performer did not depend simply upon the musical tone, but rather
upon the modification it produced in the utterances that were strained
through it. It would certainly require a quick ear, much practice, and a
thorough acquaintance with the peculiarities of Hawaiian mele to enable
one to distinguish the words of a song after being transformed by
passage through the niau-kani.

As late as about thirty or forty years ago the niau-kani was often seen
in the hands of the native Hawaiian youth, who used it as a means of
romantic conversations and flirtation. Since the coming in of the
Portuguese and their importation of the *uku-lele*, the
*taro-patch-fiddle*, and other cheap stringed instruments, the niau-kani
has left the field to them and disappeared.

The author's informant saw the niau-kani dance performed some years ago
at Moana-lua, near Honolulu, and again on the island of Kauai. The dance
in each case was the same. The kumu, aided by a pupil, stood and played
on the niau-kani, straining the cantillations through the reed-protected
aperture, while the olapa, girls, kept time to the music with the
movements of their dancing.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Up to the streams in the wildwood,  
Where rush the falls Molo-kama,  
While the rain sweeps past Mala-hoa,  
I had a passion to visit  
5 The forest of bloom at Koili,

</div>

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

To give love-caress to Manu’a,  
And her neighbor Maha-moku,  
And see the waters flash at Mono-lau;  
My hand would quiet their rage,  
10 Would sidle and touch Lani-huli.  
Grant me but this one entreaty,  
Well meet ’neath the omens above.  
Two flowers there are that bloom  
In your garden of being;  
15 Entwine them into a garland,  
Fit emblem and crown of our love.  
And what the hour of your coining?  
When stands the Sun o’er the pali,  
When turns the breeze of the land,  
20 To breathe the perfume of hala,  
While the currents swirl at War-pá.

This mele is the language of passion, a song in which the lover frankly
pours into the ear of his inamorata the story of his love up to the time
of his last enthrallment. Verses 11, 12, and 17 are the language of the
woman. The scene is laid in the rainy valley of Hanalei, Kauai, a broad
and deep basin, to the finishing of which the elements have contributed
their share. The rush and roar of the waters that unite to form the
river Wai-oli, from their wild tumbling in the falls of Molo-kama till
they pass the river's mouth and mingle with the flashing waves of the
ocean at Mono-lau, *Anapa i ke kai o Mono-lau* (verse 8), are emblematic
of the man's passion and his finest for satisfaction.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_285"></span>[133:a](ulh23.htm#fr_291.md) NOTE.--The proper
names belong to localities along the course of the Wai-oli stream.

*Molokama* (more often given as *Na Molo-kama*). The name applied to a
succession of falls made by the stream far up in the mountains. The
author has here used a versifier's privilege, compressing this long word
into somewhat less refractory shape.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[133:b](ulh23.htm#fr_292.md) *Kupa-koili*. A grove
of mountain-apples, *ohia ai*, that stand on the bank of the stream not
far from the public road.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[133:c](ulh23.htm#fr_293.md) *Manu’a-kepa*. A
sandy, grass-covered meadow on the opposite side of the river from
Kupa-koili.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[133:d](ulh23.htm#fr_294.md) *Maha-moku*. A sandy
beach near the mouth of the river, on the same bank as Manu’a-kepa.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[133:e](ulh23.htm#fr_295.md) *Monu-lau*. That part
of the bay into which the river flows, that is used as an anchorage for
vessels.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[133:f](ulh23.htm#fr_296.md) *Lani-huli*. The side
of the valley Kilauea of Wai-oli toward which the river makes a bend
before it enters the ocean.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[133:g](ulh23.htm#fr_297.md) Kau-ka-opua.
Originally a phrase meaning "the cloud-omen hangs," has come to be used
as the proper name of a place. It is an instance of a form of
personification often employed by the Hawaiians, in which words having a
specific meaning--such, for instance, as our "jack-in-the-box"--have
come to be used as a noun for the sake of the meaning wrapped up in the
etymology. This figure of speech is, no doubt, common to all languages,
markedly so in the Hawaiian. It may be further illustrated by the Hebrew
name Ichahod--"his glory has departed."

<span id="fn_292"></span>[133:h](ulh23.htm#fr_298.md) *A kau ka La, i na
pali*. When stands the sun o’er the pali, evening or late in the
afternoon. On this part of Kauai the sun sets behind the mountains.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[133:i](ulh23.htm#fr_299.md) *Wai-a-ma’o*. The
land-breeze, which sometimes springs up at night.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[133:j](ulh23.htm#fr_300.md) *Wai-pú*. A spot on
the bank of the stream where grew a pandanus tree, *hala*, styled
*Ka-hala-mapu-ana*, the hala-breathing-out-its-Fragrance.
