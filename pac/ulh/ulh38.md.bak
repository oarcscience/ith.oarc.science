# XXXIV.--THE HULA OHELO

The hula ohelo was a very peculiar ancient dance, in which the actors,
of both sexes, took a position almost that of reclining, the body
supported horizontally by means of the hand and extended leg of one
side, in such a manner that flank and buttock did not rest upon the
floor, while the free leg and arm of the opposite side swung in wide
gestures, now as if describing the arch of heaven, or sweeping the
circle of the horizon, now held straight, now curved like a hook. At
times the company, acting in concert, would shift their base of support
from the right hand to the left hand, or vice versa. The whole action,
though fantastical, was conducted with modesty. There was no
instrumental accompaniment; but while performing the gymnastics above
described the actors chanted the words of a mele to some Old World tune,
the melody and rhythm of which are lost.

A peculiar feature of the training to which pupils were subjected in
preparation for this dance was to range them in a circle about a large
fire, their feet pointing to the hearth. The theory of this practice was
that the heat of the fire suppled the limbs and imparted vivacity to the
motions, on the same principle apparently as fire enables one to bend
into shape a crooked stick. The word *kapuahi*, fireplace, in the fourth
line of the mele, is undoubtedly an allusion to this practice.

The fact that the climate of the islands, except in the mountains and
uplands, is rarely so cold as to make it necessary to gather about a
fire seems to argue that the custom of practising this dance about a
fireplace must have originated in some land of climate more austere than
Hawaii.

It is safe to say that very few kumu-hulas have seen and many have not
even heard of the hula ohelo. The author has an authentic account of its
production at Ewa in the year 1856, its last performance, so far as he
can learn, on the public stage.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Touched, thou art touched by my gesture, I fear, I fear.  
I dread your mountain of flesh, of flesh;  
How it sways, how it sways, it sways!  
I'm scorched by the heat of this hearth, this hearth.  
5 We bask in this summer of Kona, of Kona;  
Calm mantles the whispering sea, the whispering sea.  
Lo, the hook of the fisherman great, oh so great!  
The line hums as it runs from the gourd, from the gourd.  
Regard the cloud-omens over the sea, the sea.  
10 Well skilled in his craft is Mali’o, Mali’o.  
How grateful now were a draught of water, of water!  
Pardon! thou art touched by thrust of my leg, of my leg!

Forth and return, forth and return, forth and return!  
Now waft the woodland perfumes, the woodland perfumes.  
15 The house ere we entered was tenant-free, quite free.  
Heart-heavy we turn to the greenwood, the greenwood;  
This the place, Heart's desire, you should tarry, should tarry,  
And feel the soft breath of the Unulau, Unulau--  
Retirement for you, retirement for me, and for him.  
20 We'll give then our heart to this task, this great task,  
And build in the wildwood a shrine, ay a shrine.  
You go; forget not the toils we have shared, have shared,  
Lest your bones lie unblest in the road, in the road.  
How wearisome, long, the road ’bout Hawaii, great Hawaii!  
25 Love carries me off with a rush, and I cry, I cry,  
Alas, I'm devoured by the shark, great shark!

</div>

This is not the first time that a Hawaiian poet has figured love by the
monster shark.
