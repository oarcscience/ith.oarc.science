# XXXII.--THE HULA ILÍO

The dog took his part and played his enthusiastic role in the domestic
life of every Hawaiian. He did not starve in a fool's paradise, a
neglected object of man's superstitious regard, as in Constantinople;
nor did he vie with kings and queens in the length and purity of his
pedigree, as in England; but in Hawaii he entered with full heart of
sympathy into all of man's enterprises, and at his death bequeathed his
body a sacrifice to men and gods. It was fitting that the Hawaiian poet
should celebrate the dog and his altogether virtuous and altruistic
services to mankind. The hula *ilío* may be considered as part of
Hawaii's tribute to man's most faithful friend, the dog.

The hula ilío was a classic performance that demanded of the actors much
physical stir; they shifted their position, now sitting, now standing;
they moved from place to place; indulged in many gestures, sometimes as
if imitating the motions of the dog. This hula has long been out of
commission. Like the two animal-hulas previously mentioned, it was
performed without the aid of instrumental accompaniment.

The allusions in this mele are to the mythical story that tells of
Kane's drinking revels on the heights about Waipi’o valley; how he and
his fellows by the noise of their furious couching disturbed the prayers
and rituals of King Liloa and his priests, Kane himself being the chief
offender by his blowing on the conch-shell Kihapú, stolen from Liloa's
temple of Paka’alana; its recovery by the wit and dramatic action of the
gifted dog Puapua-lenalena. (See [p. 131](ulh22.htm#page_131)..md)

</div>

The author of this mele, apparently under the sanction of his poetic
license, uses toward the great god Ku a plainness of speech which to us
seems satirical; he speaks of him as *makole*, red-eyed, the result, no
doubt, of his notorious addiction to awa, in which he was not alone
among the gods. But it is not at all certain that the Hawaiians looked
upon this ophthalmic redness as repulsive or disgraceful. Everything
connected with awa had for them a cherished value, In the mele given on
[p. 130](ulh22.htm#page_130.md) the cry was, "Kane is drunken with awa!"
The two gods Kane and Ku were companions in their revels as well as in
nobler adventures. Such a poem as this flashes a strong light into the
workings of the Hawaiian mind on the creations of their own imagination,
the beings who stood to them as gods; not robbing them of their power,
not deposing them from the throne of the universe, perhaps not even
penetrating the veil of enchantment and mystery with which the popular
regard covered them, at the most perhaps giving them a hold on the
affections of the people.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Look forth, god Ku, look forth!  
Huh! Ku is blear-eyed!  
Aye, weave now the wreath--  
A wreath for the dog Pua-lena;  
5 A halo plume for Kahili,  
Choice garlands from Niho-kú.

</div>

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

There was a scurry of clouds, earth groaned;  
The sound of your baying reached  
Hawaii the verdant, the pet of the gods;  
10 A portent was seen in the heavens.  
You were kept in a cradle of gourd,  
Water-gourd of the witch Kilioe,  
Who haunted the cliffs of Haena--  
The fiery blasts of the crater  
15 Touch not Kamoho-alii's cliff.  
Your travel reaches Waipi’o,  
The sacred cliff of god Pane.  
Sleep fled the bed of the king  
At the din of the conch Kiha-pú.  
20 The king was tormented, depressed;  
His messenger sped on his way;  
Found help from Kauai of Máno--  
The marvelous foster child,  
By Waiuli, Kahuli, upreared  
25 Your answer, a-o-a, a-o-a!--  
'Twas thus Kauahoa made ready betimes,  
That hero of old Hanalei  
"Strike home! then sleep at midday!"  
"God fend a war between kindred!"  
30 One flower all other surpasses;  
Twine with it a wreath of kai-o'e,  
A chaplet to crown Pua-lena.  
My labor now has its reward,  
The doorsill of Pa-ka’a-lana.  
35 My heart leaps up in great cheer;  
The bay of the dog greets my ear,  
It reaches East Cape by the sea,  
Where Puna gave refuge to thee,  
Till came the king's herald, hot-foot,  
40 And quaffed the awa's tree-grown root.  
A-o-a, a-o-a, he, he, hene!

</div>

The problem to be solved by the translator of this peculiar mele is a
difficult one. It involves a constant readjustment of the mental
standpoint to meet the poet's vagrant fancy, which to us seems to occupy
no consistent point of view. If this difficulty arises from the author's
own lack of insight, he can at least absolve himself from the charge of
negligence and lack of effort to discover the standpoint that shall give
unity to the whole composition; and can console himself with the
reflection that no native Hawaiian scholar with whom he has conferred
has been able to give a key to the solution of this problem. In truth,
the native Hawaiian scholars of to-day do not appreciate as we do the
necessity of holding fast to one viewpoint. They seem to be willing to
accept with gusto any production of their old-time singers, though they
may not be able to explain them, and though to us, in whose hearts the
songs of the masters ever make music, they may seem empty riddles.

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

The solution of this problem here furnished is based on careful study of
the text and of the allusions to tradition and myth that therein abound.
Its expression in the translation has rendered necessary occasional
slight departures from absolute literalness, and has involved the
supplying of certain conjunctive and explanatory words and phrases of
which the original, it is true, gives no hint, but without which the
text would be meaningless.

One learned Hawaiian with whom the author has enjoyed much conference
persists in taking a most discouraging and pessimistic view of this
mele. It is gratifying to be able to differ from him in this matter and
to be able to sustain one's position by the consenting opinion of other
Hawaiians equally accomplished as the learned friend just referred to.

The incidents in the story of Puapua-lenalena alluded to in the mele do
not exactly chime with any version of the legend met with. That is not
strange. Hawaiian legends of necessity had many variants, especially
where, as in this case, the adventures of the hero occurred in part on
one and in part on another island. The author's knowledge of this story
is derived from various independent sources, mainly from a version given
to his brother, Joseph S. Emerson, who took it down from the words of an
intelligent Hawaiian youth of Kohala.

English literature, so far as known to the author, does not furnish any
example that is exactly comparable to or that will serve as an
illustration of this nonterminal rhyme, which abounds in Hawaiian
poetry. Perhaps the following will serve the purpose of illustration:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">’Twas the swine of Gadara, fattened on *mast*.  
The *mast*-head watch of a ship was the last  
To see the wild herd careering past.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Or such a
combination as this:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">He was a mere flat,  
Yet flattered the girls.</span>

</div>

Such artificial productions as these give us but a momentary
intellectual entertainment. While the intellectual element in them was
not lacking with the Hawaiians, the predominant feeling, no doubt, was a
sensuous delight coining from the repetition of a full-throated
vowel-combination.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_419"></span>[223:a](ulh36.htm#fr_435.md) *Makole*. Red-eyed;
ophthalmic.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[223:b](ulh36.htm#fr_436.md) The wreath, *lei*, is
not for the god, but for the dog Puapua-lenalena, the one who in the
story recovered the stolen conch. *Kiha-pú* (verse 20), with which god
Kane made night hideous and disturbed the repose of pious King Liloa
(*Moe ole ka po o ke alii*, verse 19).

<span id="fn_421"></span>[223:c](ulh36.htm#fr_437.md) *Kahili*. Said to be
the foster mother of Puapua-lenalena.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[223:d](ulh36.htm#fr_438.md) *Niho-kú*. Literally
an upright tooth, was the name of the hill on which lived the old couple
who were the foster parents of the dog.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[224:a](ulh36.htm#fr_439.md) *Kaanini ka lani*,
etc. Portents by which heaven and earth expressed their appreciation of
the birth of a new prodigy, the dog Puapua-lenalena.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[224:b](ulh36.htm#fr_440.md) *Hiwa-uli*. An
epithet applied to the island of Hawaii, perhaps on account of the
immense extent of territory on that island that was simply black lava;
*hiwa*, black, was a sacred color. The term *uli* has reference to its
verdancy.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[224:c](ulh36.htm#fr_441.md) *Ipu*. Wai-uli, the
foster father of the dog, while fishing in a mountain brook, brought up
a pebble on his hook; his wife, who was childless and yearned for
offspring, kept it in a calabash wrapped in choice tapa. In a year or
two it had developed into the wonderful dog, Puapua-lenalena. The
calabash was the *ipu* here mentioned, the same as the *hano wai* (verse
13), a water-container.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[224:d](ulh36.htm#fr_442.md) Kilióe. A sorceress
who lived at Haéna. Kauai, on the steep cliffs that were inaccessible to
human foot.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[224:e](ulh36.htm#fr_443.md) *Ena-ena na ahi o
Kilauea*. "Hot are the fires of Kilauea." The duplicated word *ena-ena*,
taken in connection with *Ha-ena* in the previous verse, is a capital
instance of a form of assonance, or nonterminal rhyme, much favored and
occasionally used by Hawaiian poets of the middle period. From the fact
that its use here introduces a break in the logical relation which it is
hard to reconcile with unity one may think that the poet was seduced
from the straight and narrow way by this opportunity for an indulgence
that sacrifices reason to rhyme.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[224:f](ulh36.htm#fr_444.md) *Kamoho-alii*. The
brother of Pele; his person was so sacred that the flames and smoke of
Kilauea dared not invade the bank on which he reposed. The connection of
thought between this and the main line of argument is not clear.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[224:g](ulh36.htm#fr_445.md) *Hoouna ka elele*.
According to one story Liloa dispatched a messenger to bring
Puapua-lenalena and his master to Waipi’o to aid him in regaining
possession of Kiha-pú.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[224:h](ulh36.htm#fr_446.md) *A no aku oe, aoa* \*
\* \* . This indicated the dog's assent. Puapua-lenalena understood what
was said to him, but could make no reply in human speech. When a
question was put to him, if he wished to make a negative answer, he
would keep silent; but if he wished to express assent to a proposition,
he barked and frisked about.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[224:i](ulh36.htm#fr_447.md) *Hana e o Kaua-hoa*.
\* \* \* No one has been found who can give a satisfactory explanation
of the logical connection existing between the passage here cited and
the rest of the poem. It treats of an armed conflict between Kauahoa and
his cousin Kawelo, a hero from Oahu. which took place on Kauai. Kauahoa
was a retainer and soldier of Ai-kanaka, a king of Kauai. The period was
in the reign of King Kakuhihewa, of Oahu. Kawelo invaded Kauai with an
armed force and made a proposition to Kauahoa which involved treachery
to Kauahoa's liege-lord Ai-kanaka. Kauahoa's answer to this proposition
is given in verse 28; *Hu'e a kaua, aloe i ke awakea*!--"Strike home,
then sleep at midday!" The sleep at midday was the sleep of death.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[225:a](ulh36.htm#fr_448.md) *Kapae ke kaua o ka
hoahanau!* This was the reply of Kawelo, urging Kauahoa to set the
demands of kinship above those of honor and loyalty to his liege-lord.
In the battle that ensued Kauahoa came to his death. The story of Kawelo
is full of romance.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[225:b](ulh36.htm#fr_449.md) *Kaio'e*. Said to be
a choice and beautiful flower found on Kauai. It is not described by
Hillebrand.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[225:c](ulh36.htm#fr_450.md) *Ka nioi o
Paka’a-lana*. The doorsill of the temple, *heiau*, of Paka’a-lana was
made of the exceedingly hard wood *nioi*. It was to this temple that
Puapua-lenalena brought the conch Kiha-pú when he had stolen (recovered)
it from god Kane.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[225:d](ulh36.htm#fr_451.md)
[*Kumukahi*](errata.htm#10). See note e on [p. 197](ulh28.htm#page_197.md).

<span id="fn_436"></span>[225:e](ulh36.htm#fr_452.md) *Awa kau-laau o
Puna*. It is said that in Puna the birds sometimes planted the awa in
the stumps or in the crotches of the trees, and this awa was of the
finest quality.
