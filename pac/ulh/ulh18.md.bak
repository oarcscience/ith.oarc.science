# XIV.--THE HULA PUÍLI

The character of a hula was determined to some extent by the nature of
the musical instrument that was its accompaniment. In the *hula puíli*
it certainly seems as if one could discern the influence of the rude,
but effective, instrument that was its musical adjunct. This instrument,
the *puíli* ([fig. 1](#img_fig01).md), consisted of a section of bamboo
from which one node with its diaphragm had been removed and the hollow
joint at that end split up for a considerable distance into fine
divisions, which gave forth a breezy rustling when the instrument was
struck or shaken.

The performers, all of them hoopaa, were often placed in two rows,
seated or kneeling and facing one another, thus favoring a responsive
action in the use of the puili as well as in the cantillation of the
song. One division would sometimes shake and brandish their instruments,
while the others remained quiet, or both divisions would perform

at once, each individual clashing one puíli against the other one held
by himself, or against that of his vis-a-vis; or they might toss them
back and forth to each other, one bamboo passing another in slid air.

While the hula puíli is undeniably a performance of classical antiquity,
it is not to be regarded as of great dignity or importance as compared
with many other hulas. Its character, like that of the metes associated
with it, is light and trivial.

The mele next presented is by no means a modern production. It seems to
be the work of some unknown author, a fragment of folklore, it might be
called by some, that has drifted down to the present generation and then
been put to service in the hula. If hitherto the word *folklore* has not
been used it is not from any prejudice against it, but rather from a
feeling that there exists an inclination to stretch the application of
it beyond its true limits and to make it include popular songs, stories,
myths, and the like, regardless of its fitness of application. Some
writers, no doubt, would apply this vague term to a large part of the
poetical pieces which are given in this book.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> On the same
principle, why should they not apply the term folklore to the myths and
stories that make up the body of Roman and Greek mythology? The present
author reserves the term folklore for application to those
unappropriated scraps of popular song, story, myth, and superstition
that have drifted down the stream of antiquity and that reach us in the
scrap-bag of popular memory, often bearing in their battered forms the
evidence of long use.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It has come, it has come; to the Sun!  
How I love the Sun that's on high;  
Below it swims Ka-wai-hoa,  
On the slope inclined from Lehua.  
5 On Kauai met I a pali,  
A beetling cliff that bounds Milo-lii,  
And climbing up Makua-iki,  
Crawling up was Pua, the child,  
An orphan that weeps out its tale.

The writer has rescued the following fragment from the waste-basket of
Hawaiian song. A lean-to of modern verse has been omitted; it was
evidently added within a generation:

*Mele*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Malua, <span id="fr_253"></span>[d](#fn_249.md) ki’i wai ke aloha,

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Malua, fetch water of love.  
Give drink to this mamane bud.  
The birds, they are singing ecstatic,  
Sipping Panaewa's nectared lehua,  
5 Beside themselves with the fragrance  
Exhaled from the garden Ohele.  
Your love comes to me a tornado;  
It has rapt away my whole body,  
The heart you once sealed as your own,  
10 There planted the seed of desire.  
Thought you ’twas the tree of Hopoe,  
This tree, whose bloom you would pluck?

</div>

What is the argument of this poem? A passion-stricken swain, or perhaps
a woman, cries to *Malua* to bring relief to his love-smart, to give
drink to the parched *mamane* buds--emblems of human feeling. In
contrast to his own distress, he points to the birds caroling in the
trees, reveling in the nectar of *lehua* bloom, intoxicated with the
scent of nature's garden. What answer does the lovelorn swain receive
from the nymph he adores? In lines 11 and 12 she banteringly asks him if
he took her to be like the traditional lehua tree of Hopoe, of which men
stood in awe as a sort of divinity, not daring to pluck its flowers? It
is as if the woman had asked--if the poet's meaning is rightly
interpreted--"Did you really think me plighted to vestal vows, a tree
whose bloom man was forbidden to pluck?"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_246"></span>[114:a](ulh18.htm#fr_250.md) *Kawaihoa*. The
southern point of Niihau. which is to the west of Kauai, the evident
standpoint of the poet, and therefore "below" Kauai.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[114:b](ulh18.htm#fr_251.md) *Milo-ili*. A valley
on the northwestern angle of Kauai, a precipitous region, in which
travel from one point to another by land is almost impossible.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[114:c](ulh18.htm#fr_252.md) *Makua-iki*.
Literally "little father," a name given to an overhanging pali, where
was provided a hanging ladder to make travel possible. The series of
palis in this region comes to an end at Milo-lii.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[114:d](ulh18.htm#fr_253.md) The *Malua* was a
wind, often so dry that it sucked up the moisture from the land and
destroyed the tender vegetation.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[114:e](ulh18.htm#fr_254.md) Panaewa was a
woodland region much talked of in poetry and song.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[115:a](ulh18.htm#fr_255.md) *Hopoe* was a
beautiful young woman, a friend of Hiiaka, and was persecuted by Pele,
lowing to jealousy. One of the forms in which she as a divinity showed
herself was as a lehua tree in full bloom.
