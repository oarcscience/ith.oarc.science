# XXXVII.--THE HULA ULILI

The hula *ulili*, also called by the descriptive name *kolili*--to wave
or flutter, as a pennant--was a hula that was not at all times confined
to the tabu restrictions of the halau. Like a truant schoolboy, it
delighted to break loose from restraint and join the informal
pleasurings of the people. Imagine an assembly of men and women in the
picturesque illumination given by flaring kukui torches, the men on one
side, the women on the other. Husbands and wives, smothering the
jealousy instinctive to the human heart, are there by mutual
consent--their daughters they leave at home--each one ready to play his
part to the finish, with no thought of future recrimination. It was a
game of love-forfeits, on the same lines as kilu and ume.

Two men, armed with wands furnished with tufts of gay feathers, pass up
and down the files of men and women, waving their decorated staffs, ever
and anon indicating with a touch of the wand persons of the opposite
sea, who under the rules must pay the forfeit demanded of them. The
kissing, of course, goes by favor. The wand-bearers, as they move along,
troll an amorous ditty:

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A search for a sweetheart \* \* \*  
Sport for a Kona day!  
Kona, calm sea of the gods.  
Two days the wind surges;  
5 Then, magic of cloud!  
It veers to the plain,  
Drinks up the water of love.  
How gleesome the sound  
Of rain on the trees,  
10 A balm to love's wound!  
The wand touches, heart-ease!  
It touches my bird--  
Touch-of life from the sun!  
Brings health to the million.  
15 Ho, now comes the fun!  
A meeting, a union--  
The nymph, Koo-lau,  
And the hero, Ke-í.
