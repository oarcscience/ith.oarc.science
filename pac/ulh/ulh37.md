# XXXIII.--THE HULA PUA’A

The hula *pua’a* rounds out the number of animal-dances that have
survived the wreck of time, or the memory of which has come down to us.
It was a dance in which only the olapa took part without the aid of
instrumental accompaniment. Women as well as men were eligible as actors
in its performance. The actors put much spirit into the action, beating
the chest, flinging their arms in a strenuous fashion, throwing the body
into strained attitudes, at times bending so far back as almost to touch
the floor. This energy seems to have invaded the song, and the
cantillation of the mele is said to have been done in that energetic
manner called *ai-ha’a*.

The hula pua’a seems to have been native to Kauai. The author has not
been able to learn of its performance within historic times on any other
island.

The student of Hawaiian mythology naturally asks whether the hula pua’a
concerned itself with the doings of the mythological hog-deity
Kama-pua’a whose amour with Pele was the scandal of Hawaiian mythology.
It takes but a superficial reading of the mele to answer this question
in the affirmative.

The following mele, or oli more properly, which was used in connection
with the hula pua’a, is said to have been the joint production of two
women, the daughters of a famous bard named Kana, who was the reputed
brother of Limaloa (long-armed), a wonder-working hero who piled up the
clouds in imitation of houses and mountains and who produced the mirage:

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ax of broadest edge I'm hight;  
The island groups I've visited,  
Islands of Mala-la-walu,  
Seat of Ka-maulu-a-niho,  
5 Grandam of Kama, the swine-god.  
I have seen Pi’i-lani's glory,  
Whose fame spreads over the islands.  
Enamored was I of Pele;  
Her beauty holds court at the fire-pit,  
10 Given to ravage the plains of Puna.  
Mischievous son of Ku, and of Hina,  
Whose cloud-bloom hangs in ether,  
The pig-shaped cloud that shadows Haupu,  
An impulse comes to return to Kahiki--  
15 The chains of the pit still gall me,  
The tabu cliff of Ka-moho-alii,  
The mount that is ever ablaze.  
I thought to have domiciled with her;  
Was driven away by mere shame--  
20 The shameful abuse of the goddess!  
Go thou, go I--a truce to the shame.  
It was your manners that shamed me.  
Free to you was the house we lived in.  
These were the deeds of Broad-edged-Ax,  
25 Who has seen the whole group of islands.  
Olopana's firstborn am I,  
Nursed in the arms of Ku-ula;

</div>

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Hers were the roosts for the gamecocks.  
The wilds of Ka-liu-wa’a my home,  
30 That too my craft back to Kahiki;  
This my farewell to Hawaii,  
Land of the God's immigration.  
Strangers we came to Hawaii;  
A stranger thou, a stranger I,  
35 Called Broad-edged-Ax:  
I've read the cloud-omens in heaven.  
It curls, it curls! his tail--it curls!  
Look, it clings to his buttocks!  
Faugh, faugh, faugh, faugh, uff!  
40 What! Ka-haku-ma’a-lani your name!  
Answer from heaven, oh Kane!  
My song it is done!

</div>

If one can trust the statement of the Hawaiian who communicated the
above mele, it represents only a portion of the whole composition, the
first canto--if we may so term it--having dropped into the limbo of
forgetfulness. The author's study of the mele lends no countenance to
such a view. Like all Hawaiian poetry, this mele wastes no time with
introductory flourishes; it plunges at once in medias res.

Hawaiian mythology figured Pele, the goddess of the volcano, as a
creature of passion, capable of many metamorphoses; now a wrinkled hag,
asleep in a cave on a rough lava bed, with banked fires and only an
occasional blue flame playing about her as symbols of her power; now a
creature of terror, riding on a chariot of flame and carrying
destruction; and now as a young woman of seductive beauty, as when she
sought passionate relations with the handsome prince, Lohiau; but in
disposition always jealous, fickle, vengeful.

Kama-pua’a was a demigod of anomalous birth, character, and make-up,
sharing the nature and form of a man and of a hog, and assuming either
form as suited the occasion. He was said to be the nephew of Olopana, a
king of Oahu, whose kindness in acting as his foster father he repaid by
the robbery of his henroosts and other unfilial conduct. He lived the
lawless life of a marauder and freebooter, not confining his operations
to one island, but swimming from one to another as the fit took him. On
one occasion, when the farmers of Waipi’o, whom he had robbed, assembled
with arms to bar his retreat and to deal vengeance upon him, he charged
upon the multitude, overthrew them with great slaughter, and escaped
with his plunder.

Toward Pele Kama-pua’a assumed the attitude of a lover, whose approaches
she at one time permitted to her peril. The incident took place in one
of the water caves--volcanic bubbles--in Puna, and at the level of the
ocean; but when he had the audacity to invade her privacy and call to
her as she reposed in her home at Kilauea she repelled his advances and
answered his persistence with a fiery onset, from which he fled in
terror and discomfiture, not halting until he

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

had put the width of many islands and ocean channels between himself and
her.

In seeking an explanation of this myth of Pele, the volcano god and
Kama-pua’a, who, on occasion, was a sea-monster, there is no necessity
to hark back to the old polemics of Asia. Why not account for this
remarkable myth as the statement in terms of passion familiar to all
Hawaiians of those impressive natural phenomena that were daily going on
before them? The spectacle of the smoking mountain pouring out its fiery
streams, overwhelming river and forest, halting not until they had
invaded the ocean; the awful turmoil as fire and water came in contact;
the quick reprisal as the angry waves overswept the hand; then the
subsiding and retreat of the ocean to its own limits and the restoration
of peace and calm, the fiery mount still unmoved, an apparent victory
for the volcanic forces. Was it not this spectacular tournament of the
elements that the Hawaiian sought to embody and idealize in his myth of
Pele and Kama-pua’a? <span id="fr_465"></span>[a](#fn_449)

The likeness to be found between the amphibious Kama-pua’a and the hog
appeals picturesquely to one's imagination in many ways. The very
grossness of the hog enables him becomingly to fill the role of the
Beast as a foil to Pele, the Beauty. The hog's rooting snout, that
ravages the cultivated fields; his panicky retreat when suddenly
disturbed; his valiant charge and stout resistance if cornered; his
lowered snout in charge or retreat; his curling tail--how graphic-ally
all these features appeal to the imagination in support of the
comparison which likens hint to a tidal wave.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_437"></span>[228:a](ulh37.htm#fr_453) *Ko’i maka nui*. The
word *maka*, which from the connection here must mean the edge of an ax,
is the word generally used to mean an eye. Insistence on their
peculiarity leads one to think that there must have been something
remarkable about the eyes of Kama-pua’a. One account describes
Kama-pua’a as having eight eyes and as many feet. It is said that on one
occasion as Kama-pua’a was lying in wait for Pele in a volcanic bubble
in the plains of Puna Pele's sisters recognized his presence by the
gleam of his eyes. They immediately walled up the only door of exit.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[228:b](ulh37.htm#fr_454) *Mala-la-wale*. A
celebrated king of Maui, said to have been a just ruler, who was slain
in battle on Hawaii while making war against Lono-i-ka-makahiki, the
rightful ruler of the island. It may be asked if the name is not
introduced here because of the word *walu* (eight) as a reference to
Kama-pua’a's eight eyes.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[229:a](ulh37.htm#fr_455) *Pi’i-lane*. A king
of Maui, father-in-law to Umi, the son of Liloa.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[229:b](ulh37.htm#fr_456) *Hina*. There were
several Hinas in Hawaiian mythology and tradition. Olopana, the son of
Kamaulu-a-niho (Pomander gives this name as Ka-maunu-a-ního), on his
arrival from Kahiki, settled in Koolau and married a woman named Hina.
Kama-pua’a is said to be the natural son of Hina by Kahiki-ula, the
brother of Olopana. To this Olopana was attributed the heiau of Kawaewae
at Kaneohe.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[229:c](ulh37.htm#fr_457) *Ao pua’a*. The
cloud-cap that often rested on the summit of Haupu, a mountain on Kauai,
near Koloa, is said to have resembled the shape of a pig. It was a
common saying, "The pig is resting on Haupu."

<span id="fn_442"></span>[229:d](ulh37.htm#fr_458) *Ho’i*. To return.
This argues that, if Kama-pua’a was not originally from Kahiki, he had
at least visited there.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[229:e](ulh37.htm#fr_459) *Hale-ma’u-ma’u*.
This was an ancient lava-cone which until within a few years continued
to be the most famous fire-lake in the caldera of Kilauea. It was so
called, probably, because the roughness of its walls gave it a
resemblance to one of those little shelters made from rough *ama’u* fern
such as visitors put up for temporary convenience. The word has not the
same pronunciation and is not to be confounded with that other word mau,
meaning everlasting.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[229:f](ulh37.htm#fr_460) *Kamoho-ali’i*. The
brother of Pele; in one metamorphosis he took the form of a shark. A
high point in the northwest quarter of the wall of Kilauea was
considered his special residence and regarded as so sacred that no smoke
or flame from the volcano ever touched it. He made his abode chiefly in
the earth's underground caverns, through which the sun made its nightly
transit from West back to the East. He often retained the orb of the day
to warm and illumine his abode. On one such occasion the hero Mawi
descended into this region and stole away the sun that his mother Hina
might have the benefit of its heat in drying her tapas.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[229:g](ulh37.htm#fr_461) *Hale i noho*. The
word *hale*, meaning house, is frequently used metaphorically for the
human body, especially that of a woman. Pale thus acknowledges her amour
with Kama-pua’a.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[229:h](ulh37.htm#fr_462) *Hiapo*. A firstborn
child. Legends are at variance with one another as to the parentage of
Kama-pua’a. According to the legend referred to previously, Kama-pua’a
was the son of Olopana's wife Hina, his true father being Kahiki-ula,
the brother of Olopana. Olopana seems to have treated him as his own
son. After Kama-pua’a's robbery of his mother's henroosts, Olopana
chased the thief into the mountains and captured him. Kama eventually
turned the tables against his benefactor and caused the death of Olopana
through the treachery of a priest in a heiau; he was offered up on the
altar as a sacrifice.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[230:a](ulh37.htm#fr_463) *Ka-liu-wa’a*. The
bilge of the canoe. This is the name of a deep and narrow valley at
Hauula, Koolau, Oahu, and Is well worth a visit. Kama-pua’a. hard
pressed by the host of his enemies, broke through the multitude that
encompassed him on the land side and with his followers escaped up this
narrow gorge. When the valley came to an abrupt end before him, and he
could retreat no farther, he reared up on his hind legs and scaled the
mountain wall; his feet, as he sprang up, scored the precipice with
immense hollowed-out grooves or flutings. The Hawaiians call these
*wa’a* from their resemblance to the hollow of a Hawaiian canoe. This
feat of the hog-god compelled recognition of Kama-pua’a as a deity; and
from that time no one entered Ka-liu-wa’a valley without making an
offering to Kama-pua’a.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[230:b](ulh37.htm#fr_464) *Ka-haku-ma’a-lani*.
A name evidently applied to Kama-pua’a.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[232:a](ulh37.htm#fr_465) "The Hawaiian
tradition of *Pele*, the dread goddess of the volcanic fires," says Mr.
Fornander, "analogous to the Samoan Fe’e, is probably a local adaptation
in aftertimes of an elder myth, half forgotten and much distorted. The
contest related in the legend between Pele and *Kamapua’u*, the
eight-eyed monster demigod, indicates, however, a confused knowledge of
some ancient strife between religious sects, of which the former
represented the worshipers of fire and the latter those with whom water
was the principal element worthy of adoration." Abraham Fornander, The
Polynesian Race, pp. 51, 52, Trubner & Co., London.)
