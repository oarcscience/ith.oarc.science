# XXXVIII.--THE HULA O-NIU

The so-called hula *o-niu* is not to be classed with the regular dances
of the halau. It was rather a popular sport, in which men and women
capered about in an informal dance while the players engaged in a
competitive game of top-spinning. The instrument of sport was made from
the lower pointed half of an oval coconut shell, or from the
corresponding part of a small gourd. The sport was conducted in the
presence of a mixed gathering of people amid the enthusiasm and
boisterous effervescence which betting always greatly stimulated in
Hawaii.

The players were divided into two sides of equal number, and each player
had before him a plank, slightly hollowed in the center--like the board
on which the Hawaiians pounded their poi--to be used as the bed for
spinning his top. The naked hand, unaided by whip or string, was used to
impart to the rude top a spinning motion and at the same time the
necessary projectile force--a balancing of forces that called for nice
adjustment, lest the whirling thing reel too far to one side or run wild
and fly its smooth bed. Victory was declared and the wager given to the
player whose top spun the longest.

The feature that most interests us is the singing, or cantillation, of
the oli. In a dance and game of this sort, which the author's inform-ant
witnessed at Kahuku, Oahu, in 1844, one contestant on each side, in
turn, cantillated an oli during the performance of the game and the
dance.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The rustle and hum of spinning top,  
Wild laughter and babel of sound--  
Hear the roar of the waves at Pu’u-hina!  
Bursts of derision echoed from cliffs,  
5 The cliffs of Ka-iwi-ku’i;  
And the day is stirred by a breeze.  
The house swarms with women and men.  
List! the drum-beat of Lohiau,  
Lohiau, the lover, prince of Haena--  
10 Love glows like an oven at his coming;  
Then to bathe in the lake of the God.  
Let us look at the vale Lima-huli, look!  
Now turn we and study the spinning--  
That trick we must catch to be winning.

</div>

This fragment from antiquity, as the local coloring indicates, finds its
setting at Haena, the home of the famous mythological Prince Lohiau, of
whom Pele became enamored in her spirit journey. Study of the mele
suggests the occasion to have been the feast that was given in
celebration of Lohiau's restoration to life and health through the
persevering incantations of Hiiaka, Pele's beloved sister. The feast was
also Lohiau's farewell to his friends at Haena. At its conclusion Hiiaka
started with her charge on the journey which ended with the tragic death
of Lohiau at the brink of the volcano. Pele in her jealousy poured out
her fire and consumed the man whom she had loved.
