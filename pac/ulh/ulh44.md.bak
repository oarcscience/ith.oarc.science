# XL.--THE OLI

The Hawaiian word *mele* included all forms of poetical composition. The
fact that the mele, in whatever form, was intended for cantillation, or
some sort of rhythmical utterance addressed to the ear, has given to
this word in modern times a special meaning that covers the idea of song
or of singing, thus making it overlap ambiguously into the territory
that more properly belongs to the word *oli*. The oli was in strict
sense the lyric utterance of the Hawaiians.

In its most familiar form the Hawaiians--many of whom possessed the gift
of improvisation in a remarkable degree--used the oli not only for the
songful expression of joy and affection, but as the vehicle of humorous
or sarcastic narrative in the entertainment of their comrades. The
traveler, as he trudged along under his swaying burden, or as he rested
by the wayside, would solace himself and his companions with a pensive
improvisation in the form of an oli. Or, sitting about the camp-fire of
an evening, without the consolation of the social pipe or bowl, the
people of the olden time would keep warm the fire of good-fellowship and
cheer by the sing-song chanting of the oli, in which the extemporaneous
bard recounted the events of the day and won the laughter and applause
of his audience by witty, ofttimes exaggerated, allusions to many a
humorous incident that had marked the journey. If a traveler, not
knowing the language of the country, noticed his Hawaiian guide and
baggage-carriers indulging in mirth while listening to an oli by one of
their number, he would probably be right in suspecting himself to be the
innocent butt of their merriment.

The lover poured into the ears of his mistress his gentle fancies: the
mother stilled her child with some bizarre allegory as she rocked it in
her arms; the bard favored by royalty--the poet laureate--amused the
idle moments of his chief with some witty improvisation; the alii
himself, gifted with the poetic fire, would air his humor or his
didactic comments in rhythmic shape--all in the form of the oli.

The dividing line, then. between the oli and those other weightier forms
of the mele, the *inoa*, the *kanikau* (threnody), the *pule*, and that
unnamed variety of mele in which the poet dealt with historic or
mythologic subjects, is to be found almost wholly in the mood of the
singer. In truth, the Hawaiians not unfrequently applied the term pule
to compositions which we moderns find it hard to bring within our
definitions of prayer. For to our understanding the

 

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hawaiian pule
often contains neither petition, nor entreaty, nor aspiration, as we
measure such things.

The oli from its very name *(oli-oli*, joyful) conveys the notion of
gladness, and therefore of song. It does not often run to such length as
the more formal varieties of the mele; it is more likely to be pitched
to the key of lyric and unconventional delight, and, as it seems to the
writer, more often than other forms attains a gratifying unity by reason
of closer adherence to some central thought or mood; albeit, when not so
labeled, one might well be at a loss whether in any given case he should
term the composition mele or oli.

It may not be entirely without significance that the first and second
examples here given come from Kauai, the island which most vividly has
retained a memory of the southern lands that were the homes of the
people until they came as emigrants to Hawaii.

The story on which this song is founded relates that the comely Pamaho’a
was so fond of her husband during his life that at his death she was
unwilling to part with his bones. Having cleaned and wrapped them in a
bundle, she carried them with her wherever she went. In the indiscretion
begotten of her ill-balanced state of mind she committed the mortal
offense of entering the royal residence while thus encumbered, where was
Kaahumanu, favorite wife of Kamehameha I. The king detailed two
constables (*ilamuku*) to remove the woman and put her to death. When
they had reached a safe distance, moved with pity, the men said: "Our
orders were to slay; but what hinders you to escape?" The woman took the
hint and fled hot-foot.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The wind-beaten stream of Wailua  
Is tossed into waves from the sea;  
Salt-drenched are the leaves of the hau,  
The stalks of the taro all rotted--  
5 ’Twas the crop of Maka’u-kiu.  
The flowers of kukui are a telltale,  
A messenger sped by the gale  
To warn the canoe to depart.  
Pray you depart!  
10 Hot-foot, she's off with her pack--  
A bundle red-stained with the mud--  
And ghost-swift she breasts Malu-aka.  
Quest follows like smoke--lost is her companion;  
Fierce the wind plucks at the leaves,  
15 Grabs--by mistake--her burden, the man.  
Despairing, she falls to the earth.  
And, hugging the hillock of sand,  
Sobs out her soul on the beach Mo-mo-iki.  
A tale this wrung from my heart,  
20 Not told by the tongue of man.  
Wrong! yet right, was I. my friend;  
My love after all was for you,  
While I lived a vagabond life there and here,  
Sowing my vagrom tears in all roads--  
25 Prompt my payment of debt to your house--  
Yes, truly, I'm wrong!
