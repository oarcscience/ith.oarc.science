### THE TOMB OF PUUPEHE

#### A LEGEND OF LANAI

###### FROM "THE HAWAIIAN GAZETTE"

ONE of the interesting localities of tradition, famed in Hawaiian song
and story of ancient days, is situate at the southwestern point of the
island of Lanai, and known as the *Kupapau o Puupehe*, or Tomb of
Puupehe. At the point indicated, on the leeward coast of the island, may
be seen a huge block of red lava about eighty feet high and some sixty
feet in diameter, standing out in the sea, and detached from the
mainland some fifty fathoms, around which centres the following legend.

Observed from the overhanging bluff that overlooks Puupehe, upon the
summit of this block or elevated islet, would be noticed a small
inclosure formed by a low stone wall. This is said to be the last
resting-place of a Hawaiian girl whose body was buried there by her
lover Makakehau, a warrior of Lanai.

Puupehe was the daughter of Uaua, a petty chief, one of the dependents
of the king of Maui, and she was won by young Makakehau as the joint
prize of love and war. These two are described in the *Kanikau*, or
Lamentation, of Puupehe, as mutually captive,

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

the one to the other. The maiden was a sweet flower of Hawaiian beauty.
Her glossy brown, spotless body "shone like the clear sun rising out of
Haleakala." Her flowing, curly hair, bound by a wreath of lehua
blossoms, streamed forth as she ran "like the surf crests scudding
before the wind." And the starry eyes of the beautiful daughter of Uaua
blinded the young warrior, so that he was called Makakehau, or Misty
Eyes.

The Hawaiian brave feared that the comeliness of his dear captive would
cause her to be coveted by the chiefs of the land. His soul yearned to
keep her all to himself. He said: "Let us go to the clear waters of
Kalulu. There we will fish together for the kala and the aku, and there
I will spear the turtle. I will hide you, my beloved, forever in the
cave of Malauea. Or, we will dwell together in the great ravine of
Palawai, where we will eat the young of the uwau bird, and we will bake
them in ki leaf with the sweet pala fern root. The ohelo berries of the
mountains will refresh my love. We will drink of the cool waters of
Mauna-lei. I will thatch a hut in the thicket of Kaohai for our
resting-place, and we shall love on till the stars die."

The meles tell of their love in the Pulou ravine, where they caught the
bright iiwi birds, and the scarlet apapani. Ah, what sweet joys in the
banana groves of Waiakeakua, where the lovers saw naught so beautiful as
themselves! But the "misty eyes" were soon to be made dim by weeping,
and dimmer, till the drowning brine should close them forevermore.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

Makakehau left his love one day in the cave of Malauea while he went to
the mountain spring to fill the water-gourds with sweet water. This
cavern yawns at the base of the overhanging bluff that overtops the rock
of Puupehe. The sea surges far within, but there is an inner space which
the expert swimmer can reach, and where Puupehe had often rested and
baked the *honu*, or sea turtle, for her absent lover.

This was the season for the *kona*, the terrific storm that comes up
from the equator and hurls the ocean in increased volume upon the
southern shores of the Hawaiian Islands. Makakehau beheld from the rock
springs of Pulou the vanguard of a great kona,--scuds of rain and thick
mist, rushing with a howling wind, across the valley of Palawai. He knew
the storm would fill the cave with the sea and kill his love. He flung
aside his calabashes of water and ran down the steep, then across the
great valley and beyond its rim he rushed, through the buffetings of the
storm, with an agonized heart, down the hill slope to the shore.

The sea was up indeed. The yeasty foam of mad surging waves whitened the
shore. The thundering buffet of the charging billows chorused with the
howl of the tempest. Ah! where should Misty Eyes find his love in this
blinding storm? A rushing mountain of sea filled the mouth of Malauea,
and the pent-up air hurled back the invading torrent with bubbling roar,
blowing forth great streams of spray. This was a war of matter, a battle
of the elements to thrill with pleasure the hearts of strong men. But
with one's

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

love in the seething gulf of the whirlpool, what would be to him the
sublime cataract? What, to see amid the boiling foam the upturned face,
and the dear, tender body of one's own and only poor dear love, all
mangled? *You* might agonize on the brink; but Makakehau sprang into the
dreadful pool and snatched his murdered bride from the jaws of an ocean
grave.

The next day, fishermen heard the lamentation of Makakehau, and the
women of the valley came down and wailed over Puupehe. They wrapped her
in bright new kapa. They placed upon her garlands of the fragrant *na-u*
(gardenia). They prepared her for burial, and were about to place her in
the burial ground of Manele, but Makakehau prayed that he might be left
alone one night more with his lost love. And he was left as he desired.

The next day no corpse nor weeping lover were to be I found, till after
some search Makakehau was seen at work piling up stones on the top of
the lone sea tower. The wondering people of Lanai looked on from the
neighboring bluff, and some sailed around the base of the columnar rock
in their canoes, still wondering, because they could see no way for him
to ascend, for every face of the rock is perpendicular or overhanging.
The old belief was, that some *akua*, *kanekoa*, or *keawemauhili*
(deities), came at the cry of Makakehau and helped him with the dead
girl to the top.

When Makakehau had finished his labors of placing his lost love in her
grave and placed the last stone upon it, he stretched out his arms and
wailed for Puupehe, thus:

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Where are you O Puupehe?  
Are you in the cave of Malauea?  
Shall I bring you sweet water,  
The water of the mountain?  
Shall I bring the uwau,  
The pala, and the ohelo?  
Are you baking the honu  
And the red sweet hala?  
Shall I pound the kalo of Maui?  
Shall we dip in the gourd together?  
The bird and the fish are bitter,  
And the mountain water is sour.  
I shall drink it no more;  
I shall drink with Aipuhi,  
The great shark of Manele."</span>

</div>

Ceasing his sad wail, Makakehau leaped from the rock into the boiling
surge at its base, where his body was crushed in the breakers. The
people who beheld the sad scene secured the mangled corpse and buried it
with respect in the kupapau of Manele.
