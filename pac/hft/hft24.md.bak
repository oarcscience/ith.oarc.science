### KU-ULA, THE FISH GOD OF HAWAII

###### TRANSLATED FROM MOKE MANU BY M. K. NAKUINA

THE story of Ku-ula, considered by ancient Hawaiians as the deity
presiding over and controlling the fish of the sea,--a story still
believed by many of them to-day,--is translated and somewhat condensed
from an account prepared by a recognized legendary bard of these
islands. The name of Ku-ula is known from the ancient times on each of
the islands of the Hawaiian group, and the writer gives the Maui version
as transmitted through the old people of that island.

Ku-ula had a human body, and was possessed with wonderful or miraculous
power (*mana kupua*) in directing, controlling, and influencing all fish
of the sea, at will.

Leho-ula, in the land of Aleamai, Hana, Maui, is where Ku-ula and
Hina-pu-ku-ia lived. Nothing is known of their parents, but tradition
deals with Ku-ula, his wife, their son Ai-ai, and Ku-ula-uka, a younger
brother of Ku-ula. These lived together for a time at Leho-ula, and then
the brothers divided their work between them, Ku-ula-uka choosing farm
work, or work pertaining to the land, from the seashore to the
mountain-top, while Ku-ula--known also

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

as Ku-ula-kai--chose to be a fisherman, with such other work as
pertained to the sea, from the pebbly shore to ocean depths. After this
division Ku-ula-uka went up in the mountains to live, and met a woman
known as La-ea--called also Hina-ulu-ohia--a sister of Hina-pu-ku-ia,
Ku-ula's wife. These sisters had three brothers, named Moku-ha-lii,
Kupa-ai-kee, and Ku-pulu-pulu-i-ka-na-hele. This trio were called by the
old people the gods of the canoe-making priests--"*Na akua aumakua o ka
poe kahuna kalai waa*."

While Ku-ula and his wife were living at Leho-ula he devoted all his
time to his chosen vocation, fishing. His first work was to construct a
fish-pond handy to his house but near to the shore where the surf
breaks, and this pond he stocked with all kinds of fish. Upon a rocky
platform he also built a house to be sacred for the fishing kapu which
he called by his own name, Ku-ula.

It is asserted that when Ku-ula made all these preparations he believed
in the existence of a God who had supreme power over all things. That is
why he prepared this place wherein to make his offerings of the first
fish caught by him to the fish god. From this observance of Ku-ula all
the fish were tractable (*laka loa*) unto him; all he had to do was to
say the word, and the fish would appear. This was reported all over Hana
and when Kamohoalii the King (who was then living at Wananalua, the land
on which Kauiki Hill stands) heard of it, he appointed Ku-ula to be his
head fisherman. Through this pond, which was well stocked with all kinds
of fish, the King's

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

table was regularly supplied with all rare varieties, whether in or out
of season. Ku-ula was his mainstay for fish-food and was consequently
held in high esteem by Kamohoalii, and they lived without disagreement
of any kind between them for many years.

During this period the wife of Ku-ula gave birth to a son, whom they
called Aiai-a-Ku-ula (Aiai of Ku-ula). The child was properly brought up
according to the usage of those days, and when he was old enough to care
for himself an unusual event occurred.

A large *puhi* (eel), called Koona, lived at Wailau, on the windward
side of the island of Molokai. This eel was deified and prayed to by the
people of that place, and they never tired telling of the mighty things
their god did, one of which was that a big shark came to Wailau and gave
it battle, and during the fight the puhi caused a part of the rocky
cliff to fall upon the shark, which killed it. A cave was thus formed,
with a depth of about five fathoms; and that large opening is there to
this day, situate a little above the sea and close to the rocky fort
where lived the well known Kapepeekauila. This puhi then left its own
place and came and lived in a cave in the sea near Aleamai, called
Kapukaulua, some distance out from the Alau rocks. It came to break and
rob the pond that Ku-ula had built and stocked with fish of various
kinds and colors, as known to-day.

Ku-ula was much surprised on discovering his pond stock disappearing, so
he watched day and night, and at last, about daybreak, he saw a large
eel come in through the *makai* (seaward) wall of the pond. When

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

he saw this he knew that it was the cause of the loss of his fish, and
was devising a way to catch and kill it; but on consulting with his wife
they decided to leave the matter to their son Aiai, for him to use his
own judgment as to the means by which the thief might be captured and
killed. When Aiai was told of it he sent word to all the people of
Aleamai and Haneoo to make ili hau ropes several lau fathoms in length;
and when all was ready a number of the people went out with it in two
canoes, one each from the two places, with Aiai-a-Ku-ula in one of them.
He put two large stones in his canoe and held in his hands a fisherman's
gourd (*hokeo*), in which was a large fishhook called manaiaakalani.

When the canoes had proceeded far out he located his position by
landmarks; and looking down into the sea, and finding the right place,
he told the paddlers to cease paddling. Standing up in the canoe and
taking one of the stones in his hands he dived into the sea. Its weight
took him down rapidly to the bottom, where he saw a big cave opening
right before him, with a number of fishes scurrying about the entrance,
such as uluas and other deep sea varieties. Feeling assured thereby that
the puhi was within, he arose to the surface and got into his canoe.
Resting for a moment, he then opened the gourd and took out the hook
manaiaakalani and tied the hau rope to it. He also picked up a long
stick and placed at the end of it the hook, baited with a preparation of
cocoanut and other substances attractive to fishes. Before taking his
second dive he arranged with those on the canoe as to the signs to them
of his

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

success. Saying this, he picked up the other stone and dived down again
into the sea; then, proceeding to the cave, he placed the hook in it, at
the same time murmuring a few incantations in the name of his parents.
When he knew that the puhi was hooked he signalled, as planned, to tell
those on the canoe of his success. In a short while he came to the
surface, and entering the canoe they all returned to shore, trailing the
rope behind. He told those in the canoe from Haneoo to paddle thither
and to Hamoa, and to tell all the people to pull the puhi; like
instructions were given those on the Aleamai canoe for their people. The
two canoes set forth on their courses to the landings, keeping in mind
Aiai's instructions, which were duly carried out by the people of the
two places; and there were many for the work.

Then Aiai ascended Kaiwiopele Hill and motioned to the people of both
places to pull the ropes attached to the hook on the mouth of the puhi.
It was said that the Aleamai people won the victory over the much
greater number from the other places, by landing the puhi on the
pahoehoe stones at Lehoula. The people endeavored to kill the prize, but
without success till Aiai came and threw three ala stones at it and
killed it. The head was cut off and cooked in the *imu* (oven). The
bones of its jaw, with the mouth wide open, are seen to this day at a
place near the shore, washed by the waves,--the rock formation at a
short distance having such a resemblance.

Residents of the place state that all ala stones near where the imu was
made in which the puhi was baked

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

do not crack when heated, as they do elsewhere, because of the imu
heating of that time. It is so even to this day. The backbone (*iwi
kuamoo*) of this puhi is still lying on the pahoehoe where Aiai killed
it with the three ala stones,--the rocky formation, about thirty feet in
length, exactly resembling the backbone of an eel. The killing of this
puhi by Aiai gave him fame among the people of Hana. Its capture was the
young lad's first attempt to follow his father's vocation, and his
knowledge was a surprise to the people.

After this event a man came over from Wailau, Molokai, who was a *kahu*
(keeper) of the puhi. He dreamed one night that he saw its spirit, which
told him that his *aumakua* (god) had been killed at Hana, so he came to
see with his own eyes where this had occurred. Arriving at Wananalua he
was befriended by one of the retainers of Kamohoalii, the King of Hana,
and lived there a long time serving under him, during which time he
learned the story of how the puhi had been caught and killed by Aiai,
the son of Ku-ula and Hinapukuia, whereupon he sought to accomplish
their death.

Considering a plan of action, he went one day to Ku-ula, without orders,
and told him that the King had sent him for fish for the King. Ku-ula
gave him but one fish, an ulua, with a warning direction, saying, "Go
back to the King and tell him to cut off the head of the fish and cook
it in the imu, and the flesh of its body cut up and salt and dry in the
sun, for 'this is Hana the *aupehu* land; Hana of the scarce fish; the
fish Kama; the fish of Lanakila.' (*Eia o Hana la he aina* 

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

aupehu; o Hana keia i ka ia iki; ka ia o Kama; ka ia o Lanakila)."

When the man returned to the King and gave him the fish, the King asked:
"Who gave it to you?" and the man answered:

"Ku-ula."

Then it came into his head that this was his chance for revenge, so he
told the King what Ku-ula had said but not in the same way, saying:
"Your head fisherman told me to come back and tell you that your head
should be cut from your body and cooked in the imu, and the flesh of
your body should be cut up and salted and dried in the sun."

The King on hearing this message was so angered with Ku-ula, his head
fisherman, that he told the man to go and tell all his *konohikis* (head
men of lands with others under them) and people, to go up in the
mountains and gather immediately plenty of firewood and place it around
Ku-ula's house, for he and his wife and child should be burned up.

This order of the King was carried out by the konohikis and people of
all his lands except those of Aleamai. These latter did not obey this
order of the King, for Ku-ula had always lived peaceably among them.
There were days when they had no fish, and he had supplied them freely.

When Ku-ula and his wife saw the people of Hana bringing firewood and
placing it around the house they knew it foreboded trouble; so Ku-ula
went to a place where taro, potatoes, bananas, cane, and some gourds
were growing. Seeing three dry gourds on the vine,

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

he asked the owner for them and was told to take them. These he took to
his house and discussed with his wife the evil day to come, and told
Aiai that their house would be burned and their bodies too, but not to
fear death nor trouble himself about it when the people came to shut
them in.

After some thinking Ku-ula remembered his giving the ulua to the King's
retainer and felt that he was the party to blame for this action of the
King's people. He had suspected it before, but now felt sure; therefore
he turned to his son and said: "Our child, Aiai-a-Ku-ula, if our house
is burned, and our bodies too, you must look sharp for the smoke when it
goes straight up to the hill of Kaiwiopele. That will be your way out of
this trouble, and you must follow it till you find a cave where you will
live. You must take this hook called manaiaakalani with you; also this
fish-pearl (*pa hi aku*), called *Kahuoi;* this shell called *lehoula*,
and this small sandstone from which I got the name they call me,
*Ku-ula-au-a-Ku-ulakai*. It is the progenitor of all the fish in the
sea. You will be the one to make all the ku-ulas from this time forth,
and have charge also of making all the fishing stations (*ko’a lawaia*)
in the sea throughout the islands. Your name shall be perpetuated and
those of your parents also, through all generations to come, and I
hereby confer upon you all my power and knowledge. Whenever you desire
anything call, or ask, in our names, and we will grant it. We will stand
up and go forth from here into the sea and abide there forever; and you,
our child, shall live on the land here without worrying about anything
that

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

may happen to you. You will have power to punish with death all those
who have helped to burn us and our house. Whether it be king or people,
they must die; therefore let us calmly await the calamity that is to
befall us."

All these instructions Aiai consented to carry out from first to last,
as a dutiful son.

After Ku-ula's instructions to his son, consequent upon the
manifestations of coming trouble, the King's people came one day and
caught them and tied their hands behind their backs, the evil-doer from
Molokai being there to aid in executing the cruel orders of Kamohoalii
resulting from his deceitful story. Upon being taken into their house
Ku-ula was tied to the end post of the ridge pole (*pouhana*), the wife
was tied to the middle post (*kai waena*) of the house, and the boy,
Aiai, was tied to one of the corner posts (*pou o manu*). Upon fastening
them in this manner the people went out of the house and barricaded the
doorway with wood, which they then set on fire. Before the fire was lit,
the ropes with which the victims were tied dropped off from their hands.
Men, women, and children looked on at the burning house with deep pity
for those within, and tears were streaming down their cheeks as they
remembered the kindness of Ku-ula during all the time they had lived
together. They knew not why this family and their house should be burned
in this manner.

When the fire was raging all about the house and the flames were
consuming everything, Ku-ula and his wife gave their last message to
their son and left him.

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They went right
out of the house as quietly as the last breath leaves the body, and none
of the people standing there gazing saw where, or how, Ku-ula and his
wife came forth out of the house. Aiai was the only one that retained
material form. Their bodies were changed by some miraculous power and
entered the sea, taking with them all the fish swimming in and around
Hana. They also took all sea-mosses, crabs, crawfish, and the various
kinds of shellfish along the seashore, even to the opihi-koele at the
rocky beach; every edible thing in the sea was taken away. This was the
first stroke of Ku-ula's revenge on the King and the people of Hana who
obeyed his mandate; they suffered greatly from the scarcity of fish.

When Ku-ula and his wife were out of the house they three gourds
exploded from the heat, one by one, and all those who were gazing at the
burning house believed the detonations indicated the bursting of the
bodies of Ku-ula, his wife, and child. The flames shot up through the
top of the house, and the black smoke hovered above it, then turned
toward the front of Kaiwiopele Hill. The people saw Aiai ascend through
the flames and walk upon the smoke toward the hill till he came to a
small cave that opened to receive and rescue him.

As Aiai left the house it burned fiercely, and, carrying out the
instructions of his father he called upon him to destroy by fire all
those who had caught and tied them in their burning house. As he
finished his appeal he saw the rippling of the wind on the sea and a
misty rain coming with it, increasing as it came

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

till it reached Lehoula, which so increased the blazing of the fire that
the flames reached out into the crowd of people for those who had obeyed
the King. The man from Molokai, who was the cause of the trouble, was
reached also and consumed by the fire, and the charred bodies were left
to show to the people the second stroke of Ku-ula's vengeance. Strange
to say, all those who had nothing to do with this cruel act, though
closer to the burning house, were uninjured; the tongues of fire reached
out only for the guilty ones. In a little while but a few smouldering
logs and ashes were all that remained of the house of Ku-ula. Owing to
this strange action of the fire some of the people doubted the death of
Ku-ula and his wife, and much disputation arose among them on the
subject.

When Aiai walked out through the flames and smoke and reached the cave,
he stayed there through that night till the next morning, then, leaving
his hook, pearl shell, and stone there, he went forth till he came to
the road at Puilio, where he met several children amusing themselves by
shooting arrows, one of whom made friends with him and asked him to his
house. Aiai accepted the invitation, and the boy and his parents
treating him well, he remained with them for some days.

While Aiai was living in their house the parents of the boy heard of the
King's order for all the people of Hana to go fishing for hinalea. The
people obeyed the royal order, but when they went down to the shore with
their fishing baskets they looked around for the usual bait (*ueue*),
which was to be pounded up and put

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

into the baskets, but they could not find any, nor any other material to
be so used, neither could they see any fish swimming around in the sea.
"Why?" was the question. Because Ku-ula and his wife had taken with them
all the fish and everything pertaining to fishing. Finding no bait they
pounded up limestone and placed it in the baskets and swam out and set
them h in the sea. They watched and waited all day, but in vain, for not
a single hinalea was seen, nor did any enter the baskets. When night
came they went back empty-handed and came down again the next day only
to meet the same luck. The parents of the boy who had befriended Aiai
were in this fishing party, in obedience to the King's orders, but they
got nothing for their trouble. Aiai, seeing them go down daily to
Haneoo, asked concerning it, and was told every thing so he bade his
friend come with him to the cave where' he had stayed after his father's
house was burned. Arriving there he showed the stone fish god,
Pohaku-muone, and said: "We can get fish up here from this stone without
much work or trouble."

Then Aiai picked up the stone and they went down; to Lehoula, and
setting it down at a point facing the pond which his father had made he
repeated these words: "O Ku-ula, my father; O Hina, my mother, I place
this stone here in your name, Ku-ula, which action will make your name
famous and mine too, your son; the keeping of this ku-ula stone I give
to my friend, and he and his offspring hereafter will do and act in all
things pertaining to it in our names."

After saying these words he told his friend his duties

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

and all things to be observed relative to the stone and the benefits to
be derived therefrom as an influencing power over such variety of fish
as he desired. This was the first establishment of the *ko’a ku-ula* on
land,--a place where the fisherman was obliged to make his offering of
the first of his catch by taking two fishes and placing them on the
ku-ula stone as an offering to Ku-ula. Thus Aiai first put in practice
the fishing oblations established by his father at the place of his
birth, in his youth, but it was accomplished only through the mana kupua
of his parents.

When Aiai had finished calling on his parents and instructing his
friend, there were seen several persons walking along the Haneoo beach
with their fishing baskets and setting them in the sea, but catching
nothing. At Aiai's suggestion he and his friend went over to witness
this fishing effort. When they reached the fishers Aiai asked them,
"What are those things placed there for?"

They answered, " Those are baskets for catching hinaleas, a fish that
our King, Kamohoalii, longs for, but we cannot get bait to catch the
fish with."

"Why is it so? " asked Aiai.

And they answered, "Because Ku-ula and his family are dead, and all the
fish along the beach of Hana are taken away."

Then Aiai asked them for two baskets. Having received them, he bade his
friend take them and follow him. They went to a little pool near the
beach, and setting the baskets therein, he called on his parents for
hinaleas. As soon as he had finished, the fish

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

were seen coming in such numbers as to fill the pool, and still they
came. Aiai now told his friend to go and fetch his parents and relatives
to get fish, and to bring baskets with which to take home a supply; they
should have the first pick, and the owners of the baskets should have
the next chance. The messenger went with haste and brought his relatives
as directed. Aiai then took two fishes and gave them to his friend to
place on the ko’a they had established at Lehoula for the ku-ula. He
also told him that before the setting of the sun of that day they would
hear that King Kamohoalii of Hana was dead, choked and strangled 4 to
death by the fish. These prophetic words of Aiai came true.

After Aiai had made his offering, his friend's parents came to where the
fish were gathering and were told to take all they desired, which they
did, returning home happy for the liberal supply obtained without
trouble. The owners of the baskets were then called and told to take all
the fish they wished for themselves and for the King. When these people
saw the great supply they were glad and much surprised at the success of
these two boys. The news of the reappearing of the fish spread through
the district, and the people flocked in great numbers and gathered
hinaleas to their satisfaction, and returned to their homes with
rejoicing. Some of those who gave Aiai the baskets returned with their
bundles of fish to the King. When he saw so many of those he had longed
for he became so excited that he reached out and picked one up and put
it in his mouth, intending to eat it; but instead the

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

fish slipped right into his throat and stuck there. Many tried to reach
and take it out, but were unable, and before the sun set that day
Kamohoalii, the King of Hana, died, being choked and strangled to death
by the fish. Thus the words of Aiai, the son of Ku-ula, proved true.

By the death of the King of Hana the revenge was complete. The evil-doer
from Molokai, and those who obeyed the King's orders on the day Ku-ula's
house was fired, met retribution, and Aiai thus won a victory over all
his father's enemies.

After living for a time at Hana Aiai left that place and went among the
different islands of the group establishing fishing ko’as (*ko’a aina
aumakua*). He was the first to measure the depth of the sea to locate
these fishing ko’as for the deep sea fishermen who go out in their
canoes, and the names of many of these ko’as located around the
different islands are well known.
