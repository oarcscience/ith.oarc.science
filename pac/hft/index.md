This is an anthology of Hawaiian folklore, including pieces by Thomas
Thrum and other writers. This includes many articles which were
originally published in difficult to obtain journals and now-rare books.
All were written in the late 19th or early 20th century, and are mostly
based on first-hand oral traditions. Chapters cover topics such as
resemblances to Biblical stories, myths of the gods and goddesses such
as Maui and Pele, historical legends, topographical folklore, and the
folklore of fishing.

Of interest to the general reader will be [the tales of the
Menehune](hft13), the 'little people' of Hawaii, who resemble in some
aspects the fairies of Europe. The Menehune are credited with numerous
earth-works such as fish ponds and stone platforms. This is reminiscent
of European folklore which attributes the construction of megalithic
monuments to the fairies. Could the Menehune be based on a
short-statured pre-Polynesian indigenous Hawaiian culture? Or, could
this be a post-contact European folklore import, as some recent
researchers have suggested?

Hawaiian Folk Tales is one of a number of excellent period books
available on this subject, and with a few exceptions, does not attempt
to overly romanticize or impose western narrative structure. It makes
entertaining reading both for visitors and residents of the Hawaiian
islands.
