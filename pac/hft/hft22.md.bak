### BATTLE OF THE OWLS

###### JOS. M. POEPOE

THE following is a fair specimen of the animal myths current in ancient
Hawaii, and illustrates the place held by the owl in Hawaiian mythology.

There lived a man named Kapoi, at Kahehuna, in Honolulu, who went one
day to Kewalo to get some thatching for his house. On his way back he
found some owl's eggs, which he gathered together and brought home with
him. In the evening he wrapped them in ti leaves and was about to roast
them in hot ashes, when an owl perched on the fence which surrounded his
house and called out to him, "O Kapoi, give me my eggs!"

Kapoi asked the owl, "How many eggs had you?"

"Seven eggs," replied the owl.

Kapoi then said, "Well, I wish to roast these eggs for my supper."

The owl asked the second time for its eggs, and was answered by Kapoi in
the same manner. Then said the owl, "O heartless Kapoi! why don't you
take pity on me? Give me my eggs."

Kapoi then told the owl to come and take them. The owl, having got the
eggs, told Kapoi to build up a *heiau*, or temple, and instructed him to
make an

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

altar and call the temple by the name of Manua. Kapoi built the temple
as directed; set kapu days for its dedication, and placed the customary
sacrifice on the altar.

News spread to the hearing of Kakuihewa, who was then King of Oahu,
living at the time at Waikiki, that a certain man had kapued certain
days for his heiau, and had already dedicated it. This King had made a
law that whoever among his people should erect a heiau and kapu the same
before the King had his temple kapued, that man should pay the penalty
of death. Kapoi was thereupon seized, by the King's orders, and led to
the heiau of Kupalaha, at Waikiki.

That same day, the owl that had told Kapoi to erect a temple gathered
all the owls from Lanai, Maui, Molokai, and Hawaii to one place at
Kalapueo. <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) All those from the Koolau
districts were assembled at Kanoniakapueo, <span
id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md) and those from Kauai and Niihau at
Pueohulunui, near Moanalua.

It was decided by the King that Kapoi should be put to death on the day
of Kane. <span id="fr_10"></span>[3](#fn_10.md) When that day came, at
daybreak the owls left their places of rendezvous and covered the whole
sky over Honolulu; and as the King's servants seized Kapoi to put him to
death, the owls flew at them, pecking them with their beaks and
scratching them with their claws. Then and there was fought the battle
between Kakuihewa's people and the owls. At last the owls conquered, and

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kapoi was
released, the King acknowledging that his *Akua* (god) was a powerful
one. From that time the owl has been recognized as one of the many
deities venerated by the Hawaiian people.
