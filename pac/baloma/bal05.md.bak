# Chapter V.

Magic plays an enormous part in the tribal life of the Kiriwinians (as
it undoubtedly does with the majority of native peoples). All important
economic activities are fringed with magic, especially such as imply
pronounced

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

elements of chance, venture, or danger. Gardening is completely wrapped
up in magic; the little hunting that is done has its array of spells;
fishing, especially when it is connected with risk and when the results
depend upon luck and are not absolutely certain, is equipped with
elaborate magical systems. Canoe building has a long list of spells, to
be recited at various stages of the work, at the felling of the tree, at
the scooping out of the dugout; and, towards the end, at painting,
lashing together, and launching. But this magic is used only in the case
of the larger sea-going canoes. The small canoes, used on the calm
lagoon or near the shore, where there is no danger, are quite ignored by
the magician. Weather--rain, sun and wind--have to obey a great number
of spells, and they are especially amenable to the call of some eminent
experts, or, rather, families of experts, who practice the art in
hereditary succession. In times of war--when fighting still existed,
before the white man's rule--the Kiriwinians availed themselves of the
art of certain families of professionals, who had inherited war magic
from their ancestors. And, of course, the welfare of the
body--health--can be destroyed or restored by the magical craft of
sorcerers, who are always healers at the same time. If a man's life be
endangered by an attempt on the part of the above-mentioned
*mulukuausi*, there are spells to counteract their influence, though the
only safe way to escape the danger is to apply to a woman who is a
*mulukuausi* herself--there is always some such woman in a distant
village.

Magic is so widespread that, living among the natives, I used to come
across magical performances, very often quite unexpectedly, apart from
the cases where I arranged to be present at a ceremony. The hut of
Bagido'u, the garden magician of Omarakana, was not fifty meters from my
tent, and I remember bearing his chant on one of the very first days
after my arrival, when I hardly knew of the existence of garden magic.
Later on I was allowed to assist at his chanting over magical herbs; in
fact, I could enjoy the privilege as often as I liked, and I used it
several times. In many

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

garden ceremonies part of the ingredients are chanted over in the
village, in the magician's own house, and, again, before being used in
the garden. On the morning of such a day the magician goes alone into
the bush, sometimes far away, to fetch the necessary herbs. In one charm
as many as ten varieties of ingredients, practically all herbs, have to
be brought. Some are to be found on the seabeach only, some must be
fetched from the *raiboag* (the stony coral woodland), others are
brought from the *odila*, the low scrub. The magician has to set out
before daybreak and obtain all his material before the sun is up. The
herbs remain in the house, and somewhere about noon he proceeds to chant
over them. A mat is spread on the bedstead, and on this mat another is
laid. The herbs are placed on one half of the second mat, the other half
being folded over them. Into this opening the magician chants his spell.
His mouth is quite close to the edges of the mat, so that none of his
voice can go astray; all enters the yawning mat, where the herbs are
placed, awaiting to be imbued with the spell. This catching up of the
voice, which carries the spell, is done in all magical recitations. When
a small object has to be charmed, a leaf is folded so as to form a tub
and at the narrow end of this the object is placed, while the magician
chants into the broad end. To return to Bagido'u and his garden magic.
He would chant his charm for about half an hour, or even longer,
repeating the spell over and over again, repeating various phrases in it
and various important words in a phrase. The spell is sung in a low
voice, there being a peculiar, half-melodic fashion of recital, which
slightly varies with the divers forms of magic. The repetition of the
words is a kind of rubbing in of the spell into the substance to be
medicated.

After the garden magician has finished his spell, he wraps up the leaves
in the mat and puts them aside, to be presently used in the field,
usually the next morning. All actual ceremonies of garden magic take
place in the field, and there are many spells which are chanted in the
garden. There is a whole system of garden magic consisting of a series
of

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

complex and elaborate rites, each accompanied by a spell. Every
gardening activity must be preceded by a proper rite. Thus there is a
general inaugurative rite, previous to any work in the gardens whatever,
and this rite is performed on each garden plot separately. The cutting
down of the scrub is introduced by another rite. The burning of the cut
and dried scrub is in itself a magical ceremony, and it brings in its
wake minor magical rites performed for each plot, the whole perfomance
extending over four days. Then, when the planting begins, a new series
of magical acts takes place, which lasts for a few days. Again, the
weeding and the preliminary digging are introduced by magical
performances. All these rites, as it were, a frame, into which the
garden work is fitted. The magician orders rest periods, which have to
be observed, and his work regulates the work of the community, forcing
all the villagers to perform certain labors simultaneously, and not to
lag behind or be too far in advance of the others.

His share is very much appreciated by the community; indeed, it would be
difficult to imagine any work done in the gardens without the
co-operation of the *towosi* (garden magician). [43](bal09.htm#xref_43.md)

In the management of gardens the *towosi* has a great deal to say, and
great respect is shown to his advice, a respect which is in reality
purely formal, because there are very few controversial, or even
doubtful, questions about gardening. Nevertheless, the natives
appreciate such formal deference and acknowledgment of authority to a
degree which is really astonishing. The garden magician receives also
his payment, which consists of substantial gifts of fish offered him by
the members of the village community. It must be added that the dignity
of village magician is usually vested in the person of the village
headman, though this is not invariably the case. But only a man who
belongs by birth to a certain village, whose maternal ancestors have
always been the lords of that village and of that soil, can "strike the
soil" (*iwoie buiagu*).

In spite of its great importance, Kiriwinian garden magic

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

does not consist in any stately, sacred ceremonies, surrounded with
strict taboos, performed with as much display as the natives can afford.
On the contrary, any person uninitiated into the character of Kiriwinian
magic might walk through the most important ceremony without being aware
that anything of importance is going on. Such a person might come across
a man scratching the soil with a stick, or making a small heap of dried
branches and stalks, or planting a taro tuber, and perhaps muttering
some words, Or else the imaginary spectator would walk through a
Kiriwinian new garden field, with its soil freshly moved and cleared,
with its diminutive forest of stems and sticks put into the ground to
serve as supports for the *taitu*, a field which will presently look
like a hop garden, and in such a walk he might meet a group of men,
halting here and there and adjusting something in the comer of each
garden plot. Only when loud spells are chanted over the fields would the
visitor's attention be directly drawn to the magical reality of the
performance. In such cases the whole act, otherwise insipid, assumes
some dignity and impressiveness. A man may be seen standing alone, with
a small group behind him, and addressing in a loud voice some unseen
power, or, more correctly, from the Kiriwinian's point of view, casting
this unseen power over the fields: a power which lies in the spell
condensed there through the wisdom and piety of generations. Or voices
may be beard all over the field chanting the same spell, as not seldom
the *towosi* summons the help of his assistants, who consist always of
his brothers or other matrilineal successors.

By way of illustration, let us go through one such ceremony--that
consisting in the burning of the cut and dried scrub. Some herbs,
previously chanted over, have to be wrapped, with a piece of banana
leaf, round the tops of dried coconut leaflets. Leaves so prepared will
serve as torches to set fire to the field. In the forenoon (the ceremony
I witnessed in Omarakana took place about ii a.m.), Bagido'u the
*towosi* of that village, went to the gardens accompanied by To'uluwa,
his maternal uncle and headman

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

of the village, and by some other people, among whom was Bokuioba, one
of the headman's wives. The day was hot, and there was a slight breeze;
the field was dry, so setting fire to it was easy. Everyone present took
a torch-even Bokuioba. The torches were lit quite without ceremony (by
means of wax matches, produced by the ethnographer, not without a pang),
and then everyone went along the field on the windward side, and the
whole was soon ablaze. Some children looked on at the burning, and there
was no question of any taboo. Nor was there much excitement in the
village about the performance, for we left a number of boys and children
behind, playing in the village and not at all interested or inclined to
come and see the rite. I assisted at some other rites, where Bagido'u
and I were alone, though there was no taboo to prevent anyone who wished
from being present. Of course, if anyone was present, a certain minimum
of decorum would be observed. The question of taboo, moreover, varies
with the village, each having its own system of garden magic. I assisted
at another garden burning ceremony (on the day following the wholesale
burning when a small heap of rubbish, together with some herbs, was
burnt on each plot) in a neighboring village, and there the *towosi* got
very angry because some girls looked on at the performance from a fair
distance, and I was told that the ceremonies were taboo to women in that
village. Again, whereas some ceremonies are performed by the *towosi*
alone, in others several people usually assist, while there are still
others in which the whole village community has to take part. Such a
ceremony will be described in detail below, as it bears more
particularly on the question of the participation of the *baloma* in
magic.

I have spoken here of garden magic only in order to illustrate the
general nature of Kiriwinian magic. Garden magic is by far the most
conspicuous of all magical activities, and the broad statements
exemplified in this particular case bold good with reference to all
other kinds of magic as well. All this is just intended to serve as a
general picture, which must be kept in mind in order that my remarks
about

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

the part played by the *baloma* in magic may appear in the right
perspective. [44](bal09.htm#xref_44.md)

The backbone of Kiriwinian magic is formed by its spells. It is in the
spell that the main virtue of all magic resides. The rite is there only
to launch the spell, to serve as an appropriate mechanism of
transmission. This is the universal view of all Kiriwinians, of the
competent as well as of the profane, and a minute study of the magical
ritual well confirms this view. It is in the formulae, therefore, that
the clue to the ideas concerning magic is to be found. And in the
formulae we find frequent mention made of the ancestral names. Many
formulae begin with long lists of such names, serving, in a way, as an
invocation.

The question whether such lists are real prayers, in which an actual
appeal is made to the ancestral *baloma*, who are supposed to come and
act in the magic, or whether the ancestral names figure in the formulae
as mere items of tradition-hallowed and full of magical virtue, just
because of their traditional nature-does not seem to allow of any
definite decision either way. In fact, both elements are undoubtedly
present: the direct appeal to the *baloma* and the traditional value of
the mere ancestral names. The data given below should allow of closer
determination. As the traditional element is closely bound up with the
mode of inheritance of the magical formulae, let us begin with the
latter question.

The magical formulae are passed from generation to generation, inherited
from father to son in the paternal line, or from *Kadala* (mat. uncle)
to nephew in the maternal line, which, in native opinion, is the real
line of kindred (*veiola*). The two forms of inheritance are not quite
equivalent. There is a class of magic which may be termed local, because
it is bound up with a given locality. To this class belong all the
systems of garden magic, [45](bal09.htm#xref_45.md) as well as all such
magical spells as are connected with certain spots endowed with magical
properties. Such was the most powerful rain magic in the island, that of
Kasana'i, which had to be performed in a certain waterhole in the
*weika* (grove) of Kasana'i.

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Such was the official war magic of Kiriwina,
which had to be performed by men belonging to Kuaibuaga, and which was
associated with a *kaboma* (a sacred grove) near that village. Again,
the elaborate systems of magic which were essential to shark and
*kalala* fishing had each to be carried out by a man belonging to the
village of Kaibuola or Laba'i respectively. All such formulae were
hereditary in the female line. [46](bal09.htm#xref_46.md)

The class of magic which is not bound up with locality, and which may be
easily transmitted from father to son, or even from stranger to
stranger, at a fair price, is much smaller. Here belong, in the first
place, the formulae of native medicine, which always go in couples, a
*silami*, a formula of evil magic, the object of which is to produce
illness, being always coupled with *vivisa*, a formula for annihilating
the respective *silami*, and so curing the disease. The magic which
initiates a man into the craft of carving, the *tokabitam* (carver)
magic, belongs to this class, as well as the canoe-making charms. And a
series of formulae of minor importance, or at least of less esoteric
character, such as love magic, magic against the bite of insects, magic
against the *mulukuausi* (this latter rather important), magic for
removing the bad effects of incest, etc. But even these formulae, though
they are not necessarily performed by the people of one locality, are
usually associated with a locality. There is very often a myth at the
bottom of a certain system of magic, and a myth is always
local. [47](bal09.htm#xref_47.md)

Thus the more numerous examples, and certainly the more important class
of magic (the "matrilineal" magic), is local, both in its character and
in its transmission, whereas only par-t of the other class is distinctly
local in its character. Now locality is in the mind and tradition of the
Kiriwinian most intimately associated with a given family or
subclan. [48](bal09.htm#xref_48.md) In each locality the line of men who
have succeeded each other as its rulers, and who in turn performed those
acts of magic essential to its welfare (such as garden magic), would
naturally loom large in the minds of the natives. This probably is
confirmed by the facts, for, as mentioned

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

above, the names of matrilineal ancestors play a great part in magic.

Some examples may be given to confirm this statement, though the full
discussion of the question must be deferred to another occasion, because
it would be necessary to compare this feature with the other elements
recurring in magic, and to this end the full reproduction of all the
formulae would be necessary. Let us begin with the garden magic. I have
recorded two systems of this magic, that of the village of Omarakana
called *kailuebila*, which is generally considered to be the most
powerful; and the *momtilakaiva* system, associated with the four small
villages, Kupuakopula, Tilakaiva, Iourawotu', and Wakailuva.

In the Omarakana system of garden magic there are ten magical spells,
each associated with a special act: one said while striking the ground
on which a new garden is to be made; another in the ceremony initiating
the cutting down of the scrub; another during the ceremonial burning of
the cut, dried scrub, and so on. Out of these ten spells there are three
in which reference is made to *baloma* of ancestors. One of those three
is by far the most important, and it is said during the performance of
several rites, at the cutting down ceremony, at the planting ceremony,
etc.

This is the beginning:

"*Vatuvi, vatuvi*; (repeated many times)  
*Vitumaga, imaga*;  
*Vatuvi, vatuvi*; (many times)  
*Vitulola, ilola*:  
*Tubugu Polu, tubugu Koleko, tubugu Takikila*,  
*Tubugu Mulabuoita, tubugu Kuaiudila*,  
*Tubugu Katupuala, tubugu Buguabuaga, tubugu Numakala*;  
*Bilumava'u bilumam*;  
*Tabugu Muakenwa, tamagu Iowana*. . .

After this follows the rest of the formula, which is very long, and
which, in the main, describes the state of things which the formula is
meant to produce, *i.e.*, it describes

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

the growth of the garden, the ridding of the plants from all pests,
blights, etc.

The correct translation of such magical formulae presents certain
difficulties. There are in them archaic expressions which the natives
only partially understand, and even then it is extremely difficult to
make them translate the meaning correctly into modern Kiriwinian. The
typical form of a spell consists of three parts: (1) The introduction
(called *u'ula* = lowest part of a stem, used also to denote something
akin to our conception of cause); (2) The body of the spell (called
*tapuala* = the back, the flanks, the rump; (3) The final part (*dogina*
= the tip, the end, the peak; etymologically connected with *doga*, a
tusk, a sharp, long tooth). Usually the *tapuala* is much more easy to
understand and to translate than the other parts. The invocation of
ancestors, or, more correctly, perhaps, the list of their names, is
always contained in the *u'ula*.

In the *u'ula* just quoted, the first word, *vatuvi*, was not understood
by my informant, Bagido'u, the *towosi* (garden magician), of Omarakana,
or at least, he was not able to translate it to me. On etymological
grounds it can be translated, I think, by "cause" or
"make." [49](bal09.htm#xref_49.md)

The words *vitumaga imaga* are composed of the prefixes *vitu* (to
cause), and *i* (third person, singular, verbal prefix); and of the root
*maga*, which is composed again of *ma*, the root of come, and *ga*, a
suffix often used, which plays merely the role of giving emphasis. The
words *vitulola*, *ilola* are quite symmetrical with the former, only
the root *la*, "to go" (reduplicated into *lola*), figures instead of
*ma*, to come.

In the list of ancestors, two points are to be noted: the first names
are attached to the word *tubugu*, whereas the last but one is used with
*tabugu*. *Tubugu* is a plural, and means "my grandfathers" (*gu* being
the pronominal suffix of the first person); *tabugu* means "my
grandfather" (in the singular). The use of the plural in the first group
is connected with the fact that in each subclan there are certain names,
which are the property of this subclan; and

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

every member of this subclan must possess one of these ancestral names,
though be may be called also by another non-hereditary name, by which be
is known more generally. Thus, in the first part of the spell, not one
ancestor of the name of Polu is addressed, but the magician invokes "all
my ancestors of the name of Polu, all my ancestors of the name of
Koleko," etc.

The second characteristic feature, which is also genera in all such
lists of ancestors, is that the last names are preceded by the words
"*bilumava'u bilumam*," which broadly mean (without entering into a
linguistic analysis) "you new *baloma*," and then the names of the few
last ancestors are enumerated. Thus Bagido'u mentions his grandfather,
Muakenuva, and his father, Iowana. [50](bal09.htm#xref_50.md) This is
important, because it is a direct invocation of a *baloma*, "O thou
*baloma*" (in "bilumam'" the m' being the suffix of the second person).
In the light of this fact, the ancestor names appear to be more likely
invocations of the ancestral *baloma* than a simple enumeration, even
though the ancestral names have an intrinsic, active, magical power.

In a free translation, the fragment may be rendered thus:--

"Cause! Make it! Be efficient!  
Cause to come! Cause to go!  
My grandfathers of the name Polu, etc. . . .  
And you, recent *baloma*, grandfather Muakenuva, and father Iowana."

This free translation leaves still a great deal ambiguous, but it must
be emphatically stated that this ambiguity does exist in the mind of the
man who is best acquainted with the formula. Asked, what had to go and
what to come, Bagido'u expressed his opinion in guesses. Once he told me
that the reference was to the plants which have to enter the soil; on
another occasion he thought that the garden pests are to go. Whether
"come" and "go" are meant to be antithetical or not, was not clear
either. The correct

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

interpretation must, I think, insist on the very vague meaning of the
*u'ula*, which is merely a kind of invocation. The words are believed to
embody some hidden virtue, and that is their main function. The
*tapuala*, which presents no ambiguities, explains the exact purpose of
the spell.

It is also noteworthy that *u'ula* contains rhythmical elements in the
symmetry in which the four groups of words are placed. Again, though the
number of times the word *vatuvi* is repeated varies (I have heard the
formula actually chanted several times), it is repeated the same number
of times in both periods. The alliteration in this formula is
undoubtedly also not accidental, as it is to be found in many other
spells.

I have dwelt somewhat at length on this formula, treating it as
representative of the others, which will be adduced without detailed
analysis.

The second formula in which ancestor names are mentioned is spoken at
the very first of the series of successive ceremonies at the *iowota*,
when the *towosi* strikes the ground on which the gardens are going to
be made. This formula begins:

"*Tudava, Tu-Tudava*,  
*Malita, Ma-Malita*," etc.,

mentioning here the names of two ancestral heroes, about whom there
exists a mythological cycle. Tudava is claimed to be in a way an
ancestor of the *tabalu* (the most aristocratic subclan, who rule
Omarakana), though there is no doubt that he belonged to the Lukuba clan
(whereas the *tabalu* belong to the Malasi clan).

The same two names are invoked in another formula, which is spoken over
certain herbs, used in garden-planting magic, and over some structures
of wood, made for magical purposes only, called *kamkokola*. This
formula begins:

"*Kailola, Iola; Kailola, Iola*;  
*Kaigulugulu; kaigulugulu*;  
*Kailalola Tudava*, <span id="page_202">p. 202</span>  
*Kaigulugulu Malita*,  
*Bisipela Tudava; bisila'i otokaikaya*," etc.

In free translation this means--

Go down \[O you roots\]; bore \[into the ground, O you roots\]; \[help
them\] to go down, O Tudava; \[help them\] to bore \[into the ground\] O
Malita; Tudava climbs up \[lit. changes\]; \[Tudava\] settles down on
the *tokaikaia* (*i.e.*, the platform for the *baloma*).

In the Omarakana system of garden magic there are no special references
to any sacred places near the village. [51](bal09.htm#xref_51.md) The only
ritual action performed in connection with the *baloma* during the
ceremony is of a very trifling character. After reciting the appropriate
spell over the first taro planted in a *baleko* (a garden plot, the
economic and magical unit in gardening), the magician constructs a
miniature hut and fence of dry branches, called *si buala baloma* ("the
*baloma*, their house"). No spells are said over it, nor could I
discover any tradition, or obtain any further explanation in connection
with this quaint act.

Another reference to the *baloma*, and a much more important one, though
it does not take place during a ceremony, is the exposition or offering
to the spirits of the *ula'ula*, the fee paid for the magic. The
*ula'ula* is brought to the *towosi* (garden magician) by the members of
the community, and consists usually of fish, but there may be betel nuts
or coconuts, or, nowadays, tobacco. This is exposed in the house; the
fish only in the form of a small portion of the whole gift, and, as far
as I know, in a cooked condition. While the magician chants over the
magical leaves and implements in his house previous to taking them out
into the garden, the *ula'ula*, offered to the *baloma*, ought to be
exposed somewhere near the medicated substance. This offering of the
*ula'ula* to the *baloma* is not a feature particular to the Omarakana
garden magic, but it obtains in all the other systems.

The other system (*momtilakaiva*), to which reference

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

has been made, contains only one formula, in which there is a list of
*baloma*. As this resembles that quoted above, the proper names only
being different, I omit it here. In this system of magic, however, the
role played by the *baloma* is much more pronounced, for in one of the
main ceremonies, that of the *Kamkokola*, there is an offering made to
the *baloma*. The *kamkokola* are large, bulky erections, consisting of
vertical poles some 3 to 6 meters high, and of slanting poles of the
same length, leaning against the vertical poles. The two side poles of
the *kamkokola* are propped against a lateral bifurcation of the erect
pole, formed by the stump of a protruding branch. Seen from above, the
constructions present a right angle, or the shape of the letter L, with
the vertical pole at the angle. From the side they look somewhat the
shape of the Greek letter λ. These structures have no practical
importance whatever, their only function being a magical one. They form
the magical prototype, so to speak, of the poles put in the ground as
supports for the *taitu* vine. The *kamkokola*, though they represent a
merely magical item, require, nevertheless, a considerable amount of
labor to erect. The heavy poles have to be brought very often from a
great distance, as few are found near the villages in the low scrub,
which is cut down every four or five years. For weeks men are busy
searching for, felling, and bringing into their gardens the material for
the *kamkokola*, and disputes about stealing the poles are frequent.

The *kamkokola* ritual occupies a couple of days in all the systems;
four or more days are further taken up by the obligatory rest from all
field work, which precedes the magical performance. The first day of the
magic proper is devoted, in the *momtilakaiva* system, to the chanting
over the fields. The magician, attended perhaps by one or two men, walks
across the whole garden site--it was about three-quarters of a mile
across country in the case which I witnessed--and on each garden plot be
chants the spell, leaning on one of the slanting poles of the
*kamkokola*. He faces the plot, and chants in a loud voice, which
carries well over

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

the whole plot. He has some thirty or forty such recitations to make.

It is the second day which is really of interest in this connection, for
then a ceremony is performed in the gardens in which all the villages
take part, and in which the *baloma* also are said to participate. The
object of this ceremony is to charm some leaves which will be put into
the ground at the foot of the *kamkokola* and also at the junction of
the vertical and the slanting poles. In the morning of this day the
whole village is busy with preparations. The large earthenware pots used
for boiling food on festive occasions are put on the stones which
support them, and they bubble and steam while women move round and watch
the cooking. Some women bake their *taitu* in the ground between two
layers of red-hot stones. All the boiled and baked *taitu* will be
brought out into the field, and there it will be ceremonially
distributed.

In the meantime some men have gone into the bush, some have gone right
down to the seashore, others to the *raiboag* (the rocky wooded ridge),
in order to get the herbs necessary for the magic. Large bunches have to
be brought, as after the ceremony the medicated herbs are distributed
among all the men, each taking his share and using it on his own plot.

At about ten o'clock in the morning I went into the field, accompanied
by Nasibowa'i, the *towosi* of Tilakaiva. He had a large ceremonial
stone axe hanging over his shoulder which, indeed, he uses in several
ceremonies, whereas Bagido'u of Omarakana never makes use of this
instrument. Soon after we had arrived and seated ourselves on the
ground, waiting till all were present, the women began to troop in one
after the other. Each was carrying a wooden dish with *taitu* on her
head, often leading a child by the hand and carrying another astride on
her flank. The spot where the ceremony had to be performed was at a
point where the road from Omarakana entered the garden of Tilakaiva. On
this side of the fence there was dense low scrub of a couple of years'
growth; on the other the garden

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

lay bare, the ground naked, the wooded ridge of the *raiboag* and
several groves in the distance showing through the fairly dense
agglomeration of poles planted as supports for the *taitu* vine. Two
rows of specially fine ones ran along the path, forming a nice espalier
in front of me. They terminated on this side with two specially fine
*kamkokola*, at the foot of which the ceremony was to be performed, and
which were to be supplied with herbs by the magician himself.

The women seated themselves all along the alley and on both sides in the
fields. It took them about half an hour to collect, after which the food
they brought was made into heaps, one heap for each man present, and
each contribution was divided among the heaps. By this time all the men,
boys, girls, and small children had arrived, and, the whole village
being present, the proceedings began. The normal *sagali* (distribution)
started the ceremony; a man walked past the heaps of food, and at each
heap called out the name of one of those present, after which this
portion (which had been placed on a wooden dish) was taken by a woman (a
connection of the man called) and carried into the village. The women
thus departed to the village, taking with them the babies and children.
This part of the ceremony was said to be for the benefit of the
*baloma*. The food thus distributed is called *baloma kasi* (food of the
*baloma*), and the spirits are said to take some part in the
proceedings, to be present there, and to be pleased with the food.
Beyond these generalities, however, it was absolutely impossible to
obtain a more definite or detailed statement from any of the natives,
including Nasibowa'i himself.

After the women had departed, such of the small boys as remained behind
were hunted away, as the ceremony proper was to begin. Even I and my
"boys" had to step on the other side of the fence. The ceremony
consisted simply of the recital of a spell over the leaves. Large
bunches of these were put upon the ground on a mat, and Nasibowa'i
squatted down in front of them and recited his spell right into the
herbs. As soon as be had finished, the men pounced

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

upon the leaves, each taking a handful, and running to his garden plot
to put them under and on the *kamkokola*. This ended the ceremony, which
with the waiting had lasted well over one hour.

Again, in the *momtilakaiva* magic, one of the spells refers to a
"sacred grove" (*kaboma*), called Ovavavile. This place (a large clump
of trees obviously not cut for many generations) is situated quite close
to the villages of Omarakana and Tilakaiva. It is tabooed, swelling of
the sexual organs (elephantiasis?) being the penalty for not observing
the prohibition. I never explored its interior, for fear, not so much of
the taboo, as of the small red ticks (scrub itch), which are a veritable
pest. To perform one of the magical rites, the *towosi* of Tilakaiva
goes into this sacred wood and puts a large tuber of a species of yam
called *kasi-iena* on a stone, this being an offering made to the
*baloma*.

The spell runs:--

U'ula: "*Avaita'u ikavakavala Ovavavala*?  
*Iaegula'i Nasibowa'i*,  
*Akavakavala Ovavavala*!"  
Tapuala: "*Bala baise akavakavala Ovavavala Iaegula'i*  
*Nasbowa'i akavakavala Ovavavala, bala*  
*baise*,  
*Agubitamuana, olopoulo Ovavavala; bala*  
*baise*  
*Akabinaiguadi olopoulo Ovavavala*."

There is no *dogina* (final piece) in this formula. The translation runs
as follows:--

"Who bends down in Ovavavile? [52](bal09.htm#xref_52.md) I, Nasibowa'i
(personal name of the present *towosi*) am bending down in Ovavavile! I
shall go there and bend down in Ovavavile; I, Nasibowa'i, shall bend
down in Ovavavile; I shall go there and bear the burden \[here the
magician identifies himself with the stone on which the kasi-iena is
put\] within the *kaboma* of Ovavavile. I shall go there and bulge out
\[here he speaks in the name of the planted tuber\] within the grove of
Ovavavile."

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

In this ceremony the association between the *baloma* and the magic is
very slight, but it exists, and the connection with the locality affords
another link between ancestral tradition and magic. So much concerning
garden magic.

In the two most important systems of fish magic of Kiriwina--*i.e.*, the
shark magic of the village of Kaibuola and the *kalala* (mullet?) magic
of the village of Laba'i--the spirits also play some part. Thus in both
systems one of the ceremonies consists of an offering to the *baloma*,
which is also subtracted from the *ula'ula* payment given to the
magician by the people of his village. In the shark magic one of the
rites takes place in the magician's house. The performer puts small
parcels of the cooked fish (which he had received as *ula'ula*) and some
betel nut on one of the three stones (*kailagila*), which are placed
round a fireplace and serve to support the large cooking pots. There he
utters the following formula:

U'ula: "*Kamkuamsi kami Ula'ula kubukuabuia, Inene'i, Ibuaigana
I'iovalu, Vi'iamoulo, Ulopoulo, Bowasa'i, Bomuagueda*."  
Tapuala and Dogina: "*Kukuavilasi poulo, kuminum kuaidasi poulo; okawala
Vilaita'u; okawala Obuwabu; Kulousi kuvapuagise wadola kua'u obuarita,
kulousi kuluvabouodasi kua'u obuarita kuiaioiuvasi kukapuagegasi kumaise
kuluvabodasi matami pualalala okotalela Vinaki*."

The U'ula may be translated:--

"Eat your *ula'ula* (gift, payment for magic), O unmarried women,
Inene'i," etc. (all these are personal names of female *baloma*).

In the *tapuala* there are certain words I was unable to translate, but
the general meaning is clear: "Spoil our fishing! bring bad luck to our
fishing" (so far the spell is negative; it suggests in imperative form
that which it is desired to prevent); ----- (?); ----- (?); "Go, open
the mouth of the shark in the sea; go, make the shark to be

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

met in the sea; remain open (yawning); come; make them meet the shark;
your eyes are (?); on the beach of Vinaki."

This fragmentary translation shows, at any rate, that the *bili baloma*
(a plural form of *baloma*, used when they are treated as a kind of
effective agent in magic) of the unmarried females are directly invoked
to lend a hand in making the fishing lucky.

My informant was as puzzled as myself by the question why female and not
male *baloma* are supposed to be effective in this magic. But it was a
fact known, not only to the magician, but to everybody, that the female
*baloma* are the *tolipoula*, the "masters of the fishing." The magician
and some other men in council tentatively suggested that the male
*baloma* go out to the fishing with the men, and the female *baloma*
remain behind and have to be fed by the magician, lest they should be
angry. Another man pointed out that in the myth which explains the
existence of the shark fishing in Kaibuola, a woman plays an important
part. But it was clear that to all my informants the fact of women being
*tolipoula* was so natural that it had never occurred to them to
question it previously.

The *kalala* fishing in the village of Laba'i is connected with the
mythical hero Tudava, who is specially associated with that village, and
who is, in a way, reputed to be an ancestor of the present rulers of
Laba'i. The magic which accompanies this fishing is essentially bound up
with the mythological doings of Tudava. Thus, he lived on the beach
where the fishing takes place and where the most important magical
formulae are spoken. Again, Tudava used to walk on the road leading from
the beach to the village, and there are some traditional spots connected
with his doings on that road. The "traditional presence," if such an
expression may be coined, of the hero is felt in all the fishing places.
The whole neighborhood is also enveloped in taboos, which are especially
stringent when the fishing is going on. This is periodical, and lasts
for about six days each moon, beginning on the *yapila* (the day of the
full moon), when

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

the fish are coming in shoals into the shallow water between the barrier
reef and the beach. The native tradition says that Tudava ordered the
*kalala* fish to live in "big river? on the d'Entrecasteaux Archipelago,
and once a month to come up to the beach of Laba'i. But the magic
spells, also ordered by Tudava, are essential, for if these were omitted
the fish would not come. Tudava's name, coupled with those of other
ancestors, figures in a long spell said at the beginning of the fishing
period on the beach near a large tabooed stone called
Bomlikuliku. [53](bal09.htm#xref_53.md) The spell begins:--

"*Tudava kulu Tudava;  
Ibu'a kulu, Wa'ibua;  
Kuluvidaga, Kulubaiwoie, Kulubetoto,  
Muaga'i, Karibuiuwa*," etc.

Tudava and Wa'ibua are mythical ancestors who both belonged to the
village of Laba'i, the first being, as we know already, the great
"culture hero" of the island. Noteworthy is the play on the name
Wa'ibua, evidently for the purposes of rhythm. Again, the word *kulu*
inserted between the two first names (that of Tudava and of Ibu'a and
prefixed to the three following names) could not be translated by my
informants, nor do I see any etymological solution of the difficulty.
After the personal names enumerated above follow eight names without a
kinship term and sixteen with the kinship term *tubugu* ("my
grandfathers") preceding each. Then comes the name of the immediate
predecessor of the present magician. My informant was unable to explain
why some of the names were furnished with the kinship determination,
whilst the others were not. But he was very positive that those two
classes were not equivalent or interchangeable.

An offering is made daily to the *baloma* during the six days the
fishing lasts. Small bits of cooked fish (about the size of walnuts) and
bits of betel nut (now also tobacco) are put by the magician on the
Bomlikuliku stone with the following words:--

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

"*Kamkuamsi kami ula'ula, nunumuaia:  
Ilikilaluva, Ilibualita;  
Kulisasisama*," [54](bal09.htm#xref_54.md)

which mean--

"Eat your *ula'ula* (present for performing magic), O old women:
Ilikilaluva (personal name), *Ilibualita* (personal name); open it."

This shark spell or invocation is repeated daily with each offering.
Another charm, called *guvagava*, is chanted daily for the six days over
some leaves; it has the power of attracting the *kalala* fish. The spell
begins with a list of ancestors, all of them styled "ancestor" or
"grandfather."

There is a spell performed once only, at the beginning of the fishing
period, on the road leading from the village of Laba'i to the beach. It
is chanted over a plant (*libu*) uprooted from the soil and put across
the path. In this spell there is the following phrase:--

"*Iamuana iaegulo, Umnalibu  
Tai'ioko, Kubugu, Taigala, Likiba*," [55](bal09.htm#xref_55.md)

which is also an enumeration of names, all of which are said to have
belonged to the present magician's ancestors.

Another formula in which names of ancestors occur is that recited while
the magician sweeps his house at the beginning of the fishing period.
This spell begins:--

"*Boki'u, Kalu Boki'u; Tamala, Kuri Tamala;  
Tageulo, Kuritageulo*."

All these are names of ancestors of the magician's subclan.
Characteristic is the repetition of the names with a superadded prefix,
"*Boki'u Kalu Boki'u*," etc. Whether the man's real name is represented
by the first word and the second one is an embellished replica, or
whether the first is only a curtailed second syllable of the real name,
was not quite clear to my informants.

In the system of *kalala*-fishing magic just discussed the

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

number of formulae in which ancestral names figure is five out of a
total of seven, which makes a large proportion.

It would take up too much space to discuss in detail all the remaining
magical formulae which have been recorded. A synoptic table (see next
page) will be sufficient as a basis for a short
discussion. [56](bal09.htm#xref_56.md)

As mentioned above, there are the two classes of magic, the
"matrilineal" and "patrilineal," the former bound up with a locality,
the latter often handed over from one place to another. It is also
necessary in Kiriwinian magic to distinguish between magic which forms a
system, and that which naturally consists of unconnected formulae. The
term "system" may be taken to denote that magic in which a number of
formulae form an organic consecutive whole. This whole is usually
connected with activities which are also part of a large organic
total--activities all of which are directed towards the same end. Thus
it is quite clear that garden magic forms a system. Every formula is
connected with some activity, and all together form a consecutive series
tending towards one end. The same applies to magic performed at
different stages of a fishing period or to magical formulae said during
the successive phases of a trading expedition. No single formula of such
a system would be of any use. They must all be recited successively;
they must all belong to the same system, and each must mark off some
phase of the given activity. On the other hand, love magic consists of a
number of spells (and they are innumerable in Kiriwina), every one of
which forms an independent unit.

War magic (No. 2) again forms a system. All spells have to be recited,
one after the other, in connection with consecutive magical activities.
This system is connected with a certain locality, and references to this
locality (and other places, too) are made, but no ancestor names are
mentioned.

Weather magic (No. 1), chiefly rain magic and, less important, fine
weather magic, is local and connected with a myth. The twelve spells all
belong to one locality, and they are the most powerful rain magic in the
island. They are the monopoly of the rulers of the village of Kasana'i
(a

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

small village, which forms practically one unit with the village of
Omarakana), a monopoly which in times of drought brings an enormous
income in gifts to the magician.

Again, in *kaitubutabu* magic (No. 3) the two formulae are part of a
system; they must both be said at two different stages of a period,
during which coconuts are tabooed, and the object of the whole series of
observances and rites is to foster the growth of coconuts.

Thunder magic (No. 4) is connected with a tradition, in which there
figures a mythical ancestor, and this is mentioned in the spell.

Canoe-making magic (No. 6) and *muasila* magic (No. 7), connected with a
remarkable system of trading and exchange of valuables (called *kula*),
form each an extremely important system of magic. No ancestral names are
mentioned in the formulae recorded. Unfortunately, I have not recorded
any complete system of *muasila*, and though one system of canoe magic
has been recorded, it could not be properly translated. In both forms of
magic there are references to localities, but none to ancestors.

The three spells of fishing magic (No. 11) belong to one system.

The other spells (Nos. 12-15) do not form systems. In the love spells
there is naturally no mention of ancestral names. The only formulae
where such names appear are those designed to bring a disease upon a man
or to exorcise it. Some of these charms are associated with myths.

The data here given concerning the role of ancestors in magic must speak
for themselves. It has not been possible to obtain much additional
information from natives upon this subject. The references to the
*baloma* form an intrinsic and essentially important part of the spells
in which they occur. It would be no good asking the natives "What would
happen if you omitted to invoke the *baloma*?" (a type of question which
sometimes reveals the ideas of the native as to the sanction or reason
for a certain practice), because a magical formula is an inviolable,
integral item of tradition. It must be known thoroughly and repeated
exactly

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

as it was learnt. A spell or magical practice, if tampered with in any
detail, would entirely lose its efficacy. Thus the enumeration of
ancestral names cannot conceivably be omitted. Again, the direct
question, "Why do you mention those names?" is answered in the
time-honored manner, "*Tokunabogu bubunemasi* \[our (excl.) old
custom\]." And in this matter I did not profit much from discussing
matters with even the most intelligent natives.

That the names of the ancestors are more than a mere enumeration is
clear from the fact that the *ula'ula* is offered in all the most
important systems, which have been thoroughly examined, and also
from--the offerings and *sagali* described above. But even these
presents and the partaking of the *sagali*, though undoubtedly they
imply the presence of the *baloma*, do not express the idea of the
spirits' actual participation in fostering the aim of the magic; of
their being the agents through whom the magician works, to whom he
appeals or whom he masters in the spell, and who perform subsequently
the task imposed on them.

The natives at times express meekly the idea that a benevolent attitude
of the spirit is very favorable to the fishing or gardening, and that if
the spirits were angry they would do harm. This latter negative view was
undoubtedly more pronounced. The *baloma* participate in some vague
manner in such ceremonies as are performed for their benefit, and it is
better to keep on the right side of them, but this view by no means
implies the idea that they are the main agents, or even the subsidiary
agents, of any activity. [57](bal09.htm#xref_57.md) The magical virtue lies
in the spell itself.

The native attitude of mind towards the *baloma* in magic may become
more clear when compared with that obtaining during the *milamala*.
There the *baloma* are participants and onlookers, whose favor ought to
be gained, whose wishes are naturally respected, who, further, are not
slow in showing their disapproval, and who can make a nuisance of
themselves if not properly treated, though their anger is not nearly so
terrible as that of the normal type of supernatural beings, savage or
civilized. In the *milamala* the

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *baloma* are not real agents in anything that
goes on. Their role is purely passive. And out of this passivity they
can be roused only by being put into bad humor, when they begin to show
their existence in a negative manner, so to speak.

There is another side to the lists of ancestral names in magic, which
must be remembered here. In all Kiriwinian magic a great role is played
by myths, underlying a certain system of magic, and by tradition in
general. How far this tradition is local and how far it thus becomes
focussed on the family tradition of a certain subclan has been discussed
above. The ancestral names mentioned in the several formulae form
therefore one of the traditional elements so conspicuous in general. The
mere sanctity of those names, being often a chain linking the performer
with a mythical ancestor and originator, is in the eyes of the natives a
quite sufficient *prima facie* reason for their recital. Indeed, I am
certain that any native would regard them thus in the first place, and
that he would never see in them any appeal to the spirits, any
invitation to the *baloma* to come and act; the spells uttered whilst
giving the *ula'ula* being, perhaps, an exception. But even this
exception does not loom first and foremost in his mind and does not
color his general attitude towards magic. [58](bal09.htm#xref_58.md)
