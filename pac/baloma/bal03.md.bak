# Chapter III.

Until this occurs the *baloma* is by no means entirely out of touch with
the living world. He visits his native village from time to time, and he
is visited by his surviving friends and relatives. Some of these latter
possess the faculty of getting right into the shadowy world of spirits.
Others are able to get glimpses only of the *baloma*, to hear them, to
see them from a distance or in the dark--just sufficiently clearly to
recognize them, and to be absolutely sure that they are *baloma*.

Tuma--the place of the living--is a village where the natives of
Kiriwina go from time to time. In Tuma and the adjoining islands turtle
shell and the large white cowrie shells (*Ovulum ovum*) are very
plentiful; in fact, this small island is the main source of those
important articles of decoration for the northern and eastern villages
of Kiriwina. [22](bal09.htm#xref_22.md) Therefore Tuma is often visited by
men from the main island.

All my informants from Omarakana and the neighboring villages knew Tuma
quite well. And there was hardly anybody who had not had some experience
of the *baloma*. One man saw a shadow in the twilight receding at his
approach; another heard a well-known voice, etc., etc. Bagido'u, an
exceptionally intelligent man of the Tabalu subclan, the garden magician
of Omarakana, and my best informant on all matters of ancient lore and
tradition, has

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

seen any number of spirits, and had not the slightest doubt that a man
staying in Tuma for some length of time would have no difficulty in
seeing any of his deceased friends. One day he (Bagido'u) was getting
water out of a well in the *raiboag* (stony woodland) on Tuma, when a
*baloma* hit him on the back, and, on turning round, Bagido'u just saw a
shadow retreating into the bush, and heard a smacking sound, such as is
usually made with the lips if a native wants to attract somebody's
attention. Again, one night, Bagido'u was sleeping in Tuma on a bed.
Suddenly he found himself lifted out of it and put on the ground.

A large party of men, with To'uluwa, the chief of Omarakana, went to
Tuma. They landed not far from the Modawosi stone, when they saw a man
standing there. They immediately identified him as Gi'iopeulo, a great
warrior and a man of indomitable strength and courage, who had died
recently in a village not more than five minutes distance from
Omarakana. When they approached, he disappeared, but they heard
distinctly "*Bu kusisusi bala* \[You remain, I shall go\]"--the usual
form of "Good-by." Another of my informants was in Tuma drinking water
in one of the large water grottoes, so typical of the *raiboag*. He
heard a girl called Buava'u Lagim cry out to him, calling him by name,
out of this waterhole.

I have heard of many more such incidents. It is worthy of note that in
all these cases the *baloma* are distinct from the *kosi*--that is, the
natives are sure that it is a *baloma*, and not a *kosi*, that is seen
or heard, though their slightly frivolous behavior (like the throwing of
a respectable man out of his bed, or hitting him on the back) does not
differ from that of the *kosi* in any essential respect. Again, the
natives do not seem to regard any of those appearances or pranks of the
*baloma* with any sort of "creepy" feeling; they do not seem to be
afraid of them, as Europeans are of ghosts, any more than they are of
the *kosi*.

Besides these intermittent glimpses of the spirit life, the living are
brought into touch with the *baloma* in a much more intimate manner,
through the mediation of those

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

privileged people who visit in their own person the land of the dead.
Professor Seligman writes: "There are individuals who say that they have
visited Tuma and returned to the upper world." [23](bal09.htm#xref_23.md)
Such people are by no means rare, and are of both sexes, though, of
course, they differ vastly in renown. In Omarakana, the village where I
was living, the most renowned person of this sort was a woman,
Bwoilagesi, a daughter of the late chief Numakala, brother and
predecessor of To'uluwa, the present ruler of Omarakana. She has
visited, and apparently continues to visit, Tuma, where she sees and
speaks with the *baloma*. She has also brought back a *baloma* song from
Tuma, which is sung very often by the women of Omarakana.

There is also a man, Moniga'u, who goes to Tuma from time to time and
brings news from the spirits. Although I knew both those people very
well, I was not able to get from them any detailed information as to
their wanderings in Tuma. They were both very uneasy on this subject,
and returned my questions with half-hearted and obvious answers. I was
strongly under the impression that they were unable to give any detailed
statements, and that all they knew was told by them to everybody, and
was thus public property. Such public property was the song above
mentioned, [24](bal09.htm#xref_24.md) and also personal messages from
various spirits to their families. Bwoilagesi--with whom I talked once
on this subject in the presence of her son, Tukulubakiki, one of the
most friendly, decent and intelligent natives I met-stated that she
never remembers what she saw, though she remembers what was told to her.
She does not walk or sail to Tuma; she falls asleep and just finds
herself among the *baloma*. She and her son were quite positive that the
song was given her by the *baloma*. But it was evident that the subject
was painful to Tukulubakiki, especially when I pressed about details. I
was unable to find any instance in which my lady informant derived
actual economic benefit from her exploits in Tuma, though her prestige
was immensely enhanced, in spite of the existence of sporadic, yet
unmistakable, scepticism.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

Thus I was told by two of my informants that all such claims about
seeing the *Baloma* are downright lies. One of them, Gomaia, a boy of
Sinaketa (a village on the southern half of the island) told me that one
of the most remarkable men who used to visit Tuma was one Mitakai'io, of
Oburaku; but even he was a humbug. He used to boast that he could go to
Tuma in order to eat. "I want to eat now; I shall go to Tuma; there is
plenty of food there: ripe bananas, yams and taro, ready to eat; fish
and pigs; there is plenty of areca nut and betel pepper, too; all the
time I go to Tuma I eat." It may be easily imagined how strongly these
pictures would appeal to the natives' fancy, how they would enhance the
personal prestige of the boaster and arouse the envy of the more
ambitious. Boasting about food is the most prevalent form of native
vanity or ambition. A commoner might pay with his life if he had too
much food or too good a garden, and especially if he displayed it too
boastfully.

Gomaia apparently did not like Mitakai'io's boastings, and tried to get
at the truth. He offered one pound. "I'll give you one pound if you take
me to Tuma." But Mitakai'io was satisfied with much less. "Your father
and mother cry for you all the time; they want to see you; give me two
sticks of tobacco and I shall go, see them, give them the tobacco. Your
father saw me; he told me, 'Bring the tobacco from Gomaia.'" But
Mitakai'io was not in a hurry to take Gomaia to the other world. Gomaia
gave him the two sticks, and these were smoked by the wizard himself.
Gomaia found it out and was very indignant, and insisted on getting to
Tuma, promising to give the pound as soon as be returned from there
again. Mitakai'io gave him three kinds of leaves, which be ordered him
to rub all over his body, and to swallow another small parcel. This was
done, and Gomaia lay down and went to sleep--but he never reached Tuma.
This made him sceptical, but, though Mitakai'io never got the promised
pound, he retained his general prestige.

The same Mitakai'io exposed another minor Tuma seer,

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

by name Tomuaia Lakuabula. There was a chronic controversy between the
two, Mitakai'io often expressing a contemptuous opinion about Tomuaia.
Finally the matter had to be settled by a test. Tomuaia promised to go
to Tuma and to bring some token from there. As a matter of fact, he went
to the bush and stole a bunch of betel nuts belonging to Mourada the
*tokaraiwaga valu* (village headman) of Oburaku. He consumed plenty of
the nuts himself, keeping one, however, for future use. In the evening
he said to his wife, "Prepare my mat on the couch; I hear the *baloma*
singing; I shall soon be with them; I must lie down." Then he began to
sing in his house. All the men outside heard him and said to each other:
"It is Tomuaia who sings alone and none else." They told him so the next
day, but he said they could not have heard him, but many of the *baloma*
were singing, and he had joined them.

When day was approaching, he put the one betel nut, kept for the
purpose, into his mouth, and at daybreak he got up, went out of his
house, and, taking the betel nut from his mouth, cried: I have been to
Tuma; I have brought a betel nut from there.' All the people were highly
impressed with the token, but Mourada and Mitakai'io, who had watched
him carefully on the previous day, knew that he had stolen the bunch of
nuts, and they exposed him. From that time Tomuaia did not talk about
Tuma. I have noted this story exactly as I heard it from Gomaia, and I
am telling it in the same form. The natives in their narrative very
often do not preserve the right perspective, however. It seems to me
probable that my informant has condensed into his account different
occurrences; but in this place it is the main fact of the natives'
psychological attitude towards "spiritism" that is interesting; I mean
the pronounced scepticism of some individuals on this subject and the
tenacity of belief among the majority. It is also obvious from these
stories--and it was stated outright by my sceptical friends--that the
chief element in all wanderings to Tuma is the material benefit derived
from this by the seers.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

A slightly different form of communication with spirits is that of the
men who have short fits, in which they talk to the *baloma*. I am not
able even approximately to define the psychological or pathological
basis of such phenomena. Unfortunately, they were only brought to my
notice towards the end of my stay--in fact, about a fortnight before my
departure, and then only by accident. One morning I heard loud and, it
seemed to me, quarrelsome vociferation from the other side of the
village, and, being always on the alert for some sociological
"document," I inquired from the natives in my but what it was. They
replied that Gumguya'u--a respectable and quiet man--was talking to the
*baloma*. I hurried to the spot, but, arriving too late, found the man
exhausted on his bed, apparently asleep. The incident did not arouse any
excitement, because, as they said, it was his habit to talk to the
*baloma*. The conversation was carried on by Gumguya'u in a loud and
high-pitched tone that sounded like an abusive monologue, and it was
said to have reference to a big ceremonial boat race which had taken
place two days before. Such a race is always held when a new canoe is
built, and it is the duty of the chief, who organizes it, to arrange a
big *sagali* (ceremonial distribution of food) in connection with the
festivities. The *baloma* are in some impersonal and vague manner always
interested in festivities, and they watch to ensure plenty of food. Any
scarcity, caused either by slackness or the bad luck of the organizer,
is resented by the *baloma*, who blame him for it, whether it be his
fault or not. Thus, in this case, the *baloma* had approached Gumguya'u
with the intention of expressing their strong disapproval of the meager
character of the *sagali* made the other day on the beach. The organizer
of the feast was, of course, To'uluwa, the chief of Omarakana.

Dreams also seem to play some part in the commerce between the *baloma*
and the living. Perhaps the cases in which principally the *baloma* thus
appear to the living occur immediately after death, when the spirit
comes and tells the news to any near friend or relative who is not on
the spot. Again, *baloma* often come to women in dreams to tell them

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

that they will become enceinte. During the *milamala*, the annual feast,
people are frequently visited by dead relatives in dreams. In the first
of the cases mentioned (when spirits after death come to absent friends
or relatives) there is some latitude and some "symbolizing," such as has
been assumed in the interpretation of dreams throughout all ages and
civilizations. Thus a large party of Omarakana boys went away to work on
a plantation in Milne Bay, on the extreme east end of the mainland of
New Guinea. Among them was Kalogusa, a son of To'uluwa, the chief, and
Gumigawa'ia, a commoner from Omarakana. One night Kalogusa dreamt that
his mother, an old woman, one of the sixteen wives of To'uluwa, now
living in Omarakana, came to him and told him that she had died. He was
very sad, and apparently showed his grief by wailing. (The story was
told to me by one of the party.) All the others knew that "something
must have happened in Omarakana." When they learned on their way home
that the mother of Gumigawa'ia had died, they were not at all
astonished, and found in this the explanation of Kalogusa's dream.

This seems to be the proper place to discuss the nature of the *baloma*
and their relation to the *kosi*. Of what stuff are they made? Of the
same or of different substance? Are they shades, or spirits, or are they
conceived materially? It is possible to put all these questions to the
natives, the most intelligent of whom will grasp them without difficulty
and discuss them with the ethnographer, showing a considerable amount of
insight and interest. But such discussions have proved to me
unmistakably that in dealing with these and similar questions one leaves
behind the domain of belief proper and approaches quite a different
class of native ideas. Here the native speculates rather than positively
believes, and his speculations are not a very serious matter to him, nor
does he trouble at all as to whether they are orthodox or not. Only
exceptionally intelligent natives will enter into such questions at all,
and these express rather their private opinion than positive tenets.
Even the exceptionally intelligent natives have nothing in their
vocabulary or store

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

of ideas that would correspond even approximately to our ideas of
"substance" or "nature," though there is a word, *u'ula*, corresponding
approximately to "cause," "origin."

You may ask: "What is the *baloma* like? Is its body like ours, or
different? And in what manner is it different?" You may further point
out to the native the problem of the body remaining and the disembodied
*baloma* going away. To such questions the answer will be almost
invariably that the *baloma* is like a reflection (*saribu*) in water
(or mirror for the modern Kiriwinian), and that the *kosi* is like a
shadow (*kaikuabula*). This distinction--the "reflection" character of
the *baloma* and the shadowy nature of the *kosi*--is the usual, but by
no means the exclusive opinion. At times both are said to be like
*saribu* or like *kaikuabula*. I was always under the impression that
such answers were not so much a definition as a simile. By that I mean
that the natives were not at all certain that a *baloma* is made of the
same matter as a reflection; they knew, in fact, that a reflection is
"nothing," that it is a *sasopa* (lie), that there is no *baloma* in it,
but the *baloma* is just "something like a reflection" (*baloma makawala
saribu*). When forced against a metaphysical wall by such questions,
"How can a *baloma* call out, and eat, and make love if it is like a
saribu? How can a *kosi* hammer against a house, or throw stones, or
strike a man if it is like a shadow?" the more intelligent replied more
or less to the effect: "Well the *baloma* and the *kosi* are like the
reflection and like the shadow, but they are also like men, and they
behave all the same as men do." And it was difficult to argue with
them. [25](bal09.htm#xref_25.md) The less intelligent or less patient
informants were inclined to shrug their shoulders over such questions;
others, again, would obviously become interested in the speculations,
and produce extempore opinions, and ask your view, and just enter into a
metaphysical discussion of a sort. Such extemporized opinions, however,
never amounted to very far-reaching speculations; they just turned round
the general views above mentioned.

It must be clearly understood that there were certain

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

tenets which my informants one and all would endorse. There is not the
slightest doubt that a *baloma* retains the semblance of the man he
represents, so that if you see the *baloma*, you recognize the man that
was. The *baloma* live the life of men; they get older; they eat, sleep,
love, both whilst in Tuma and on visits which they pay to their
villages. All these were points on which the natives had not the
slightest doubts. It will be remarked that these tenets refer to actions
of the *baloma*, describe their behavior, and also that some of
them--such as the belief in the *baloma's* need of food, for
instance--imply certain behavior on the part of men (compare below,
description of the *milamala*). He only almost general tenet concerning
the *baloma* and *kosi* was that the former are like reflections, the
latter like shadows. It is noteworthy that this double simile
corresponds respectively to the open, defined, permanent nature of the
*baloma* and to the vague, precarious, nocturnal character of the
*kosi*.

But even as to the fundamental relations between the *baloma* and *kosi*
there exist essential discrepancies--discrepancies which bear not merely
on their nature, but even upon their relative existence. By far the more
general view is that the *baloma* goes straight to Tuma and that another
spirit, the *kosi*, roams about for a short time. This view admits of
two interpretations: either there are two spirits in the living man, and
they both leave the body at death, or else the *kosi* is a kind of
secondary spirit, appearing only at death and absent in a living body.
The natives understood this question if I put it in this form: "Do the
*baloma* and *kosi* stop in the body all the time? Or, on the contrary,
does the *baloma* alone stop in the body and the *kosi* only appear at
death?' But the answers were all vacillating and contradictory, the same
man giving different answers at various times, the best proof that one
was in the domain of pure extempore speculation.

Besides this more general view, I found several men who repeatedly
maintained that the *kosi* is the first stage of a development, and that
subsequently, after a few days, the

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *kosi* is transformed into a *baloma*. Here we
would have, therefore, only one spirit, who lingers for a time after
death round and near his home and then departs. In spite of its greater
simplicity and logical plausibility, this belief was by far the less
pronounced. It was, however, independent and developed enough to prevent
the former belief being assumed as exclusive or even orthodox.

An interesting variation of the first version (that of a parallel
existence of both *baloma* and *kosi*) was that given by Gomaia, one of
my best informants. He was positive that only such men as had been
sorcerers (*bwoga'u*) during their life would produce a *kosi* after
death. To be a *bwoga'u* is not very difficult, however. Any man who
knows any of the *silami* (evil spells), and who is in the habit of
practicing them, is a *bwoga'u*. According to Gomaia, the others (the
ordinary persons) would not become *kosi*; they would become *baloma*
only, and go to Tuma. In all other particulars-such as the respective
nature of *baloma* and *kosi*, and the behavior as well as the
precarious existence--Gomaia agreed with the general views. His version
is noteworthy, because he is a very intelligent native and his father
was a great wizard and *bwoga'u*, and his *kadala* (maternal uncle) is
also a sorcerer. Moreover, this version agrees very well with the fact
that the *bwoga'u* is always imagined as prowling at night, and, in
fact, except for the *mulukuausi*, he presents the only serious terror
of the night. Again, the *mulukuausi*, though not the *bwoga'u* (a still
more virulent form of evil-minded human being, wise in sorcery), have,
as we saw above, a "double" or "sending" called *kakuluwala*, which
leaves their body and travels invisibly. This belief in a "double" or
"sending" is parallel to another, which affirms that the *mulukuausi*
travel bodily.

These remarks show that, generally speaking, the question as to the
nature of the *baloma* and *kosi* and of their mutual relationship has
not crystallized into any orthodox and definite doctrine.

The relation of the *baloma* to the body of the living man is still less
clear to the natives. They are unable to give any

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

definite answers to such questions as: "Does the *baloma* stop in any
part of the body (head, belly, lungs)? Can it leave it during life? Is
it the *baloma* that walks in dreams? Is it the *baloma* of some people
that go to Tuma?" Though the two last-mentioned questions are usually
answered by "yes," it is a very unconvincing affirmation, and it is
obvious that these speculations are not backed up by orthodox tradition.
Intelligence, memory, wisdom they localize in the body, and know the
seat of each of those faculties of the mind; but the *baloma* they are
not able to locate, and, indeed, I rather think they imagine that it is
a double that detaches itself from the body at death, and not a soul
that dwells in the body during life. I am only sure, however, that their
ideas are in an uncrystallized form, rather felt than formulated, rather
referring to activities of the *baloma* than analytically discussing his
nature and various conditions of existence.

Another point about which there appears to be no one definite, dogmatic
answer is the actual abode of the spirits. Do they reside on the surface
of earth, on the island of Tuma, or do they live underground or
elsewhere? There are several opinions, and the respective supporters
were quite definite in upholding their views. Thus from a number of
informants, including Bagido'u, a very serious and reliable man, I
received the answer that the *baloma* live on the island of Tuma, that
their villages are somewhere there, exactly as the *baloma* camp
somewhere in the neighborhood of a village in Kiriwina on their annual
return during the *milamala*. The above-mentioned three villages of the
dead share the surface of the island with Tuma, the village of the
living. The *baloma* are invisible, and so is everything that belongs;
to them, and that is the reason why their villages can be there without
being in anybody's way.

Another view is that the *baloma* descend underground to a real "nether
world," and live there in Tumaviaka (Great Tuma). This view was
expressed in two different versions, one of which speaks of a kind of
two-storied underworld. When the *baloma* dies at the close of his first
spiritual

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

existence he descends to the lower story, or stratum, from whence only
he is able to return to the material world (*cf. infra*, VI,
Reincarnation). The majority reject this theory, and say that there is
only one tier of nether world, which agrees with Professor Seligman's
statement: "The spirits of the dead do not stay in the upper world with
the living, but descend into the other world below the
earth." [26](bal09.htm#xref_26.md) Again, this view of an underground Tuma
seems to harmonize better with the prevalent idea on Kiriwina that the
first human beings emerged from holes in the ground. Professor Seligman
even obtained the account that "the world was originally colonized from
Tuma, men and women being sent to the upper world by Topileta, who
himself stopped underground." [27](bal09.htm#xref_27.md) That I did not
come across this statement is not astonishing in consideration of the
great diversity of views on certain matters, the nature of Tuma and its
relation to the world of the living being one of them. Seligman's
statement corroborates the opinion that "underground Tuma" is the most
orthodox version, though, as already stated, the whole question is not
dogmatically settled in native belief.
