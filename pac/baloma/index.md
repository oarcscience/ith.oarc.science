The Trobriand Islanders of the Melanesian region, as well as many other
cultures in the Australian and New Guinea regions, had a belief that
there was no cause and effect relationship between sexual intercourse
and pregnancy. As detailed in this monograph, the Trobrianders belived
that the Baloma, the spirits of the dead, would return from the
afterlife and impregnate women when they bathed in the lagoon, thus
reincarnating the dead ancestor.

This often cited monograph by one of the founders of modern ethnography
is a classic of the field. Malinowski makes a breakthrough observation
this is not just a quaint lack of scientific understanding by 'natives';
it is part of an entire cultural complex that makes as much sense as any
other, relatively speaking. He makes the point that no set of beliefs
can be studied in isolation from the rest of society. Anthropology
should not be the haphazard collection of random customs and artifacts,
as it had been up to that point. Rather, we need to study cultures on
their own terms in a systematic fashion.
