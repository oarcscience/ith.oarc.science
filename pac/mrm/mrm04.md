# CHAPTER II.

### MAORI COSMOGONY AND MYTHOLOGY.

An quoquam genitos nisi Cœlo credere fas est Esse homines.--*Manilius*.

THE *Maori* had no tradition of the Creation. The great mysterious Cause
of all things existing in the Cosmos was, as he conceived it, the
generative Power. Commencing with a primitive state of Darkness, he
conceived Po (=Night) as a person capable of begetting a race of beings
resembling itself. After a succession of several generations of the race
of Po, Te Ata (=Morn) was given birth to. Then followed certain beings
existing when Cosmos was without form, and void. Afterwards came Rangi
(=Heaven), Papa (=Earth), the Winds, and other Sky-powers, as are
recorded in the genealogical traditions preserved to the present time.

We have reason to consider the mythological traditions of the *Maori* as
dating from a very antient period. They are held to be very sacred, and
not to be repeated except in places set apart as sacred.

The Genealogies recorded hereafter are divisible into three distinct
epochs:--

1\. That comprising the personified Powers of Nature preceding the
existence of man, which Powers are regarded by the *Maori* as their own
primitive ancestors, and are invoked in their *karakia* by all the
*Maori* race;

{p. 11}

for we find the names of Rangi, Rongo, Tangaroa, &c., mentioned as
*Atua* or Gods of the *Maori* of the Sandwich Islands and other Islands
of the Pacific inhabited by the same race. The common worship of these
primitive *Atua* constituted the National religion of the Maori.

2\. In addition to this the *Maori* had a religious worship peculiar to
each tribe and to each family, in forms of *karakia* or invocation
addressed to the spirits of dead ancestors of their own proper line of
descent.

Ancestral spirits who had lived in the flesh before the migration to New
Zealand would be invoked by all the tribes in New Zealand, so far as
their names had been preserved, in their traditional records as mighty
spirits.

3\. From the time of the migration to New Zealand each tribe and each
family would in addition address their invocations to their own proper
line of ancestors,--thus giving rise to a family religious worship in
addition to the national religion.

The cause of the preservation of their Genealogies becomes intelligible
when we consider that they often formed the ground-work of their
religious formulas, and that to make an error or even hesitation in
repeating a *karakia* was deemed fatal to its efficacy.

In the forms of *karakia* addressed to the spirits of ancestors, the
concluding words are generally a petition to the *Atua* invoked to give
force or effect to the *karakia* as being derived through the *Tipua*,
the *Pukenga*, and the *Whananga*, and so descending to the living
*Tauira*.

### GENEALOGICAL DESCENT FROM TOKO-PA.

Kohu (=Mist) was the child of Tokopa.

Kohu married To Ika-roa (= The Milky-way), and gave birth to Nga Whetu
(= The Stars).

### GENEALOGICAL DESCENT FROM RANGI-POTIKI.

Rangi-potiki had three wives, the first of which was Hine-ahu-papa; from
her descended:--

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

Haronga took to wife Tongo-tongo. Their children were a son and
daughter, Te Ra (= The Sun) and Marama (= The Moon). Haronga perceiving
that there was no light for his daughter Marama, gave To Kohu in
marriage to Te Ikaroa, and the Stars were born to give light for the
sister of To Ra, for the child of Tongo-tongo. "*Nga tokorua a
Tongotongo*" (= the two children of Tongotongo) is a proverbial term for
the Sun and Moon at the present day.

Rangi-potiki's second wife was Papatuanuku. She gave birth to the
following children:--

Rehua (a star).  
Rongo.  
Tangaroa.  
Tahu.  
Punga and Here, twins.  
Hua and Ari,     do.

RONGO was *atua* of the *kumara*.

TANGAROA was ancestor of Fish and the Pounamu, which is classed with
fish by the *Maori*. Tangaroa took to wife Te Anu-matao (= the chilly
cold): from which union descended.

TAHU was *atua* presiding over peace and feasts.

PUNGA was ancestor of the lizard, shark, and ill-favoured creatures:
hence the proverb "*aitanga-a-Punga*" (= child of Punga) to denote an
ugly fellow.

TU-MATAUENGA was the *Maori* war God.

Rangi-potiki's third wife was Papa (= Earth). Tangaroa was accused of
having committed adultery with Papa, and Rangipotiki, armed with his
spear, went to obtain satisfaction. He found Tangaroa seated by the door
of his house, who, when he saw Rangi thus coming towards him, began the
following *karakia*, at the same time striking his right shoulder with
his left hand:--

Tangaroa, Tangaroa,  
Tangaroa, unravel;  
Unravel the tangle,  
Unravel, untwist.

{p. 19}

Though Rangi is distant,  
He is to be reached.  
Some darkness for above,  
Some light for below  
Freely give  
For bright Day

\[1\]

This invocation of Tangaroa was scarce ended when Rangi made a thrust at
him. Tangaroa warded it off, and it missed him. Then Tangaroa made a
thrust at Rangi, and pierced him quite through the thigh, and he fell.

While Rangi lay wounded he begat his child Kueo (= Moist). The cause of
this name was Rangi's wetting his couch while he lay ill of his wound.
After Kueo, he begat Mimi-ahi, so-called from his making water by the
fireside. Next he begat Tane-tuturi (= straight-leg-Tane), so-called
because Rangi could now stretch his legs. Afterwards he begat
Tane-pepeki (= bent-leg-Tane), so-called because Rangi could sit with
his knees bent. The next child was Tane-ua-tika (= straight-neck Tane),
for Rangi's neck was now straight, and he could hold up his head. The
next child born was called Tane-ua-ha<sup>\[2\]</sup> (=
strong-neck-Tane), for Rangi's neck was strong. Then was born
Tane-te-waiora, (= lively Tane), so called because Rangi was quite
recovered. Then was born Tane-nui-a-Rangi (= Tane great son of Rangi).
And last of all was born Paea, a daughter. She was the last

\[1. This *karakia* is the most antient example of the kind. It is now
applied as suggestive of a peaceable settlement of a quarrel.

2\. Ha = kaha.\]

{p. 20}

of Rangi's children. With Paea they came to an end, so she was named
Paea, which signifies 'closed.'

Some time after the birth of these children the thought came to
Tane-nui-a-Rangi to separate their father from them. Tane had seen the
light of the Sun shining under the armpit of Rangi; so he consulted with
his elder brothers what they should do. They all said, "Let us kill our
father, because he has shut us up in darkness, and let us leave our
mother for our parent." But Tane advised, "Do not let us kill our
father, but rather let us raise him up above, so that there may be
light." To this they consented; so they prepared ropes, and when Rangi
was sound asleep they rolled him over on the ropes, and Paea took him on
her back. Two props were also placed under Rangi. The names of the props
were Tokohurunuku, and Tokohururangi. Then lifting him with the aid of
these two props, they shoved him upwards. Then Papa thus uttered her
farewell to Rangi.

"*Haera ra, e Rangi, ê! ko le wehenga taua i a Rangi.*"

"Go, O Rangi, alas! for my separation from Rangi."

And Rangi answered from above:

"*Heikona ra, e Papa, ê! ko te wehenga taua i a Papa*."

"Remain there, O Papa. Alas! for my separation from Papa."

So Rangi dwelt above, and Tane and his brothers dwelt below with their
mother, Papa.

Some time after this Tane desired to have his mother Papa for his wife.
But Papa said, "Do not turn your inclination towards me, for evil will
come to you. Go to your ancestor Mumuhango." So Tane took {p. 21}
Mumuhango to wife, who brought forth the *totara* tree. Tane returned to
his mother dissatisfied, and his mother said, "Go to your ancestor
Hine-tu-a-maunga (= the mountain maid)." So Tane took Hine-tu-a-maunga
to wife, who conceived, but did not bring forth a child. Her offspring
was the rusty water of mountains, and the monster reptiles common to
mountains. Tane was displeased, and returned to his mother. Papa said to
him "Go to your ancestor Rangahore." So Tane went, and took that female
for a wife, who brought forth stone. This greatly displeased Tane, who
again went back to Papa. Then Papa said "Go to your ancestor Ngaore (=
the tender one). Tane took Ngaore to wife. And Ngaore gave birth to the
*toetoe* (a species of rush-like grass). Tane returned to his mother in
displeasure. She next advised him, "Go to your ancestor Pakoti." Tane
did as he was bid, but Pakoti only brought forth *hareheke* (= phormium
tenax). Tane had a great many other wives at his mother's bidding, but
none of them pleased him, and his heart was greatly troubled, because no
child was born to give birth to Man; so he thus addressed his
mother--"Old lady, there will never be any progeny for me." Thereupon
Papa said, "Go to your ancestor, Ocean, who is grumbling there in the
distance. When you reach the beach at Kura-waka, gather up the earth in
the form of man." So Tane went and scraped up the earth at Kura-waka. He
gathered up the earth, the body was formed, and then the head, and the
arms; then he joined on the legs, and patted down the surface of the
belly, so as to give the form of man; and when he had done this, he
returned to his mother and said, "The

{p. 22}

whole body of the man is finished." Thereupon his mother said, "Go to
your ancestor Mauhi, she will give the *raho*.<sup>\[1\]</sup> Go to
your ancestor Whete, she will give the *timutimu*.<sup>\[2\]</sup> Go to
your ancestor Taua-ki-te-marangai, she will give the
*paraheka*.<sup>\[3\]</sup> Go to your ancestor Punga-heko, she has the
*huruhuru*." So Tane went to these female ancestors, who gave him the
things asked for. He then went to Kura-waka. Katahi ka whakanoho ia i
nga raho ki roto i nga kuwha o te wahine i hanga ki to one: Ka man era.
Muri atu ka whakanoho ia ko to timutimu na Whete i homai ki waenga i nga
raho; muri atu ko to paraheka na Taua-ki-te-marangai i homai ka
whakanoho ki to take o to timutimu: muri iho ko to huruhuru na Pungaheko
i homai ka whakanoho ki runga i to puke. Ka oti, katahi ka tapa ko
Hineahuone. Then he named this female form Hine-ahu-one (= The earth
formed maid).

Tane took Hine-ahu-one to wife. She first gave birth to Tiki-tohua--the
egg of a bird from which have sprung all the birds of the air. After
that, Tikikapakapa was born-a female. Then first was born for Tane a
human child. Tane took great care of Tikikapakapa, and when she grew up
he gave her a new name, Hine-a-tauira (= the pattern maid). Then he took
her to wife, and she bore a female child who was named Hine-titamauri.

One day Hine-a-tauira said to Tane, "Who is my father?" Tane laughed. A
second time Hine-a-tauira asked the same question. Then Tane made a
sign:

\[4\]

\[1. 2. 3. Quaedam partes corporis genitales.

4\. *Katahi ka tohungia e Tane ki tona ure*.\]

{p. 23}

and the woman understood, and her heart was dark, and she gave herself
up to mourning, and fled away to Rikiriki, and to Naonao, to Rekoreko,
to Waewae-te-Po, and to Po.<sup>\[1\]</sup> The woman fled away, hanging
down her head. <sup>\[2\]</sup>Then she took the name of Hine-nui-te-Po
(= great woman of Night). Her farewell words to Tane were--"Remain, O
Tane, to pull up our offspring to Day; while I go below to drag down our
offspring to Night."

\[3\]

Tane sorrowed for his daughter-wife, and cherished his daughter
Hinetitamauri; and when she grew up he gave her to Tiki to be his wife,
and their first-born child was Tiki-te-pou-mua.

\[4\]

The following narrative is a continuation of the history of Hinenuitepo
from another source:--

After Hinenuitepo fled away to her ancestors in the realms of Night, she
gave birth to Te Po-uriuri (= The Dark one), and to Te Po-tangotango (=
The very dark), and afterwards to Pare-koritawa, who married Tawaki, one
of the race of Rangi. Hence the proverb when the sky is seen covered
with small clouds "*Parekoritawa is tilling her garden*." When Tawaki
climbed to Heaven with Parekoritawa, he repeated this *karakia*.:--

Ascend, O Tawaki, by the narrow path,  
By which the path of Rangi was followed;  
The path of Tu-kai-te-uru.

\[1. These were all ancestors of the race of Powers of Night.

2\. *He oti, ka rere te wahine: ka anga ko te pane ki raro, tuwhera tonu
nga kuwha, hamama tonu te puapua*.

3\. "*Heikona, e Tane, hei kukume ake i a taua hua ki te Ao; kia haere
au ki raro hei kukume iho i a taua hua ki te Po*."

4\. Vid. Genealogical Table.\]

{p. 24}

The narrow path is climbed,  
The broad path is climbed,  
The path by which was followed  
Your ancestors, Te Aonui,  
Te Ao-roa,  
Te Ao-whititera.  
Now you mount up  
To your *Ihi*,  
To your *Mana*,  
To the Thousands above,  
To your *Ariki*,  
To your *Tapairu*,  
To your *Pukenga*,  
To your *Whananga*,  
To your *Tauira*.

When Tawaki and Parekoritawa mounted to the Sky, they left behind them a
token--a black moth--a token of the mortal body.

Pare gave birth to Uenuku (= Rainbow). Afterwards she brought forth
Whatitiri (= Thunder). Hence the rainbow in the sky, and the
thunder-clap.
