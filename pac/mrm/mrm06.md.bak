# CHAPTER IV.

### RELIGIOUS RITES OF THE MAORI.

Tantum Relligio potuit suadere.--Lucretius.

You ask me about the customs of *Maori* men, and their origin, how men
came to learn them. This is the source whence men learnt them. Their
knowledge is not from modern times. Papa, Rangi, Tiki were the first to
give rules to men for work of all kinds, for killing, for man-eating,
for *karakia*. In former days the knowledge of the *Maori* was great, in
all matters, from this teaching, and so men learnt how to set rules for
this thing and for that thing. Hence came the ceremony of *Pure* for the
dead, the *karakia* for the new-born infant, for grown men, for battle,
for storming a *Pa*, for eels, for birds, for *makutu*, and a multitude
of other *karakia*. Tiki was the source from which they came down to the
*tupua*, the *pukenga*, the *wananga*, and the *tauira*. The men of
antient days are a source of invocation for the *tauira*. Hence the
*karakia* had its power, and came down from one generation to another
ever having power. Formerly their *karakia* gave men power. From the
time when the *Rongo-pai* (= Gospel) arrived here, and men were no
longer *tapu*, disease commenced. The man of former days was not
afflicted by disease. He died only when bent by age. He died when he
came to the natural end of life.

My writing to you begins with the *karakia* for a mother when her
breasts give no milk. After a child is born, if the mother's breasts
have no milk, her husband

{p. 39}

goes for the *tohunga*. When the *tohunga* arrives the mother and child
are carried to the water-side, and the *tohunga* dipping a handful of
weed in the water, sprinkles it on the mother. The child is taken away
from the mother by the *tohunga*, who then repeats this *karakia*:

Water-springs from above give me,  
To pour on the breast of this woman.  
Dew of Heaven give me,  
To cause to trickle the breast of this woman  
At the points of the breast of this woman;  
Breasts flowing with milk,  
Flowing to the points of the breast of this woman,  
Milk in plenty yielding.  
For now the infant cries and moans,  
In the great night, in the long night.  
Tu the benefactor,  
Tu the giver,  
Tu the bountiful,  
Come to me, to this tauira.

After this the child is dipped in the water, and the mother and child
are kept apart. One whole night they are kept apart, in order that the
*karakia* may take effect. The mother remains alone in her house, while
the *tohunga* seated outside it repeats his *karakia*. The *tohunga*
also instructs the woman thus--"If the points of your breasts begin to
itch, lay open your clothes, and lie naked." Some time after her breasts
begin to itch, and the woman knows that the *karakia* is taking effect.
Afterwards her breasts become painful, and she calls out to the
*tohunga* "my breasts itch and are painful, they are full of milk." Then
the child is brought to the mother. See what power the *karakia* of the
*Maori* possessed.

This is a word, a thought of mine. There has not,

{p. 40}

been any remarkable sign of late years, from the time of the arrival of
the Rongo-pai (= Gospel), like the signs seen in this island when men
were *tapu*, when *karakia* had power. One sign seen in this island was
the Ra-kutia (= the closed sun). At mid-day there was darkness, and the
stars were seen. After two hours perhaps of darkness, daylight returned.
Our fathers saw this sign: but there are now no signs like those of
former days.

### CEREMONY OF TUA.

When a male child is born to a Chief, all his tribe rejoice. The mother
is separated from the inhabitants of the settlement, to prevent her
coming in contact with persons engaged in cultivating the *kumara*, lest
anything belonging to the mother should be accidentally touched by them,
lest the kumara should be affected by her state of *tapu*; for the
sacredness of any *rehu-wahine* is greatly feared.

When the child is about a month old, and strives with its hands to reach
its mother's breast, the ceremony of *Tua* takes place. Two fires are
kindled; one fire for the *Ariki*, one fire for the *Atua*. The food to
be cooked on the fire is fern-root. Then the *tohunga* takes the child
in his arms, and repeats this

karakia

Breathe quick thy lung,  
A healthy lung.  
Breathe strong thy long,  
A firm lung,  
A brave lung.  
Severing<sup>\[1\]</sup> for your bravery,  
    \*   \*  tilling food,

\[1. The severing of umbilical cord is here referred to.\]

{p. 41}

Severing for wielding the weapon,  
    \*   \*  warding off,  
    \*   \*  seizing the first man,  
    \*   \*  storming the Pa.  
&c. &c. &c. &c.  
The boy infant is stept<sup>\[1\]</sup> over,  
    \*   \*  climbed<sup>\[1\]</sup> over,  
    \*   \*  lifted in the arms,  
The boy infant is free from *tapu*,  
He runs freely where food is cooked.  
Cause this *karakia* to flow gently,  
To the *Pukenga*,  
To the *Wananga*,  
To the *Tauira*.

When this *karakia* ends the ceremony of *Poipoi* (= waving) follows.
The *tohunga* takes up the fern-root cooked for the *Atua*, and waving
it over the child repeats these words:--"This is for the *Tipua*, for
the *Pukenga*, for the *Wananga*. Eat it. It is the food cooked for you
to eat." The cooked fern-root is then deposited on the sacred place.
Afterwards the child is taken in the arms of the female *Ariki*, who
waves over it the fern-root cooked on her fire, and touches with it
different parts of the child's body. The *Ariki* is said then to eat
this fern-root, but does not do so in fact. She only spits on it, and
throws it on the sacred place.

If there are several female *Ariki* of the same family of whom one is
absent, a figure is made with weeds to represent her. Then part of the
fern-root is offered to

\[1. The female *Ariki* at these words steps over the child, and then
takes it in her arms.\]

{p. 42}

the figure and is stuck in it. All these ceremonies take place on sacred
ground. The part of the ceremony--that of touching the body of the child
with the food to be eat by the *Ariki*--is named *kai-katoa*. After this
the child is free from *tapu*, so that persons of the family may take it
in their arms.

No further ceremony takes place till the child arrives at youth, when
his hair is cut, and the young person is released from *tapu*. The hair
must be cut in the morning in order to insure a strict observance of
*tapu*; for it is not only the *tohunga* who must be *tapu* on this
occasion, but also the whole tribe. This *tapu* commences in the
morning, and no one must eat food while it lasts. Should any one eat
during that time it will be discovered; for if the skin of the child's
head be cut while cutting the hair, it is known at once that some one
has eat food. This is a sure sign. After the hair is cut the ceremony of
*Poipoi* is again observed, and the *tohunga* then raising up his hands
repeats this *karakia*, and the young person is free--

These hands of mine are raised up,  
And this sacredness here.  
Tu-i-whiwhia, Tu-i-rawea,  
Your freedom from *tapu*  
Make sure the obtaining.  
Make sure the freedom.  
Make it sure to Papa.  
Give me my *tu*:  
Lift up the sacredness  
Lift it up : it prevails.  
My hands here are raised<sup>\[1\]</sup> up,

\[1. As to the custom of raising aloft the hands while praying to the
Gods. compare Hom: Il. Lib. 3 273, and other numerous examples.\]

{p. 43}

To Tiki there these hands of mine,  
To Hine-nui-te-po these hands of mine,  
These now free from *tapu*.  
Freedom. They are free.

### CEREMONIES FOR THE DEAD.

When a man dies his body is placed in a sitting posture, and is bound to
a stake to keep it in a good position. It is seated with its face
towards the sun as it rises from its cave. Then every one comes near to
lament. The women in front, the men behind them. Their clothes are
girded about their loins. In their hands they hold green leaves and
boughs, then the song called *keka* commences thus:--

<table data-cellspacing="0" data-border="0" data-cellpadding="9" width="798">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%" data-valign="MIDDLE"><p><em>Tohunga</em> chants</p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>It is not a man,</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td width="50%" data-valign="MIDDLE"><p>All           "</p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>It is Rangi now consigned to earth,<br />
Alas! my friend.</p></td>

<p>Tohunga   "</p></td>
<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>My evil omen,</p></td>

<td width="50%" data-valign="TOP"><p>The lightning glancing on the mountain peak<br />
All Te Waharoa doomed to death.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

After the *keka*, the *uhunga* or lament commences. The clothes in which
the corpse should be dressed are the *kahuwaero*, the *huru*, the
*topuni*, and the *tatata*. The lament ended, presents are spread to
view, greenstone ornaments, and other offerings for the dead chief. A
carved chest, ornamented with feathers, is also made, and a carved
canoe, a small one resembling a large canoe, which is painted with
*kokowai* (= red-ochre); also a stick bent at the top is set up by the
way-side, in order that persons passing by may see it, and know that a
chief has died. This is called a *hara*. The carved chest is called a
*whare-rangi*. The corpse only is buried, the clothes are placed in the
carved chest which is preserved by the family and descendants as a
sacred relic.

{p. 44}

On the morning following the burial, some men go to kill a small bird of
the swamps called *kokata*, and to pluck up some reeds of *wiwi*. They
return and come near the grave. The *tohunga* then asks "Whence come
you?" The men reply, "From the seeking, from the searching." The
*tohunga* again asks "Ah! what have you got? ah! what have you gained?"
Thereon the men throw on the ground the *kotata* {*sic*} and the *wiwi*.
Then the *tohunga* selects a stalk of *toetoe* or *rarauhe*, and places
it near the grave in a direction pointing towards Hawaiki to be a
pathway for the spirit, that it may go in the straight path to those who
died before him. This is named a *Tiri*, and is also placed near where
he died, in order that his spirit may return as an *Atua* for his living
relations. The person to whom this *Atua* appears is called the
*kaupapa* or *waka-atua*. Whenever the spirit appears to the *kaupapa*
the men of the family assemble to hear its words. Hear the *karakia* of
the *kaupapa* to prevail on the spirit to climb the path of the *Tiri*.

This is your path, the path of Tawaki  
By it he climbed up to Rangi,  
By it he mounted to your many,  
To your Thousands;  
By it you approached,  
By it you clung,  
By it your spirit arrived safely  
To your ancestors.  
I now am here sighing,  
Lamenting for your departed spirit,  
Come, come to me in form of a moth,  
Come to me your *kaupapa*,  
Whom you loved,  
For whom you lamented.  
Here is the *Tiri* for you, {p. 45}  
The *Tiri* of your ancestors,  
The *Tiri* of your Pukenga,  
Of your *Wananga*,  
Of me this *Tauira*.

### THE REINGA OR HADES.

When the spirit leaves the body it goes on its way northward, till it
arrives at two hills. The first of these hills is a place on which to
lament with wailings and cuttings. There also the spirit strips off its
clothes.<sup>\[1\]</sup> The name of this hill is Wai-hokimai. The name
of the other hill is Wai-otioti: there the spirit turns its back on the
land of life, and goes on to the Rerenga-wairua (Spirit's-leap). There
are two long straight roots, the lower extremities of which are
concealed in the sea, while the upper ends cling to a *pohutukawa* tree.
The spirit stands by the upper end of these roots, awaiting an opening
in the sea weed floating on the water. The moment an opening is seen, it
flies down to the Reinga. Reaching the Reinga, there is a river and a
sandy beach. The spirit crosses the river. The name of the newcomer is
shouted out. He is welcomed, and food is set before him. If he eats the
food he can never return to life.

\[2\]

### TALE OF TE ATARAHI.

There was a man named Te Atarahi, who remained five nights and five days
in the Reinga, and then returned to life. On the fifth day after this
man died, two women went out to cut flax leaves. While so employed they

\[1. Spirits on their way to the N. Cape are said to be clothed in the
leaves of the *wharangi*, *makuku*, and *oropito*.

2\. Vid. similar account. "Traditions and Supersitions {*sic*} of the
New Zealanders," p. 150, et seq.\]

{p. 46}

observed the flower stalks of the flax springing up every now and then,
at a little distance from them. Then one of the women remarked to her
companion--"There is some one sucking the juice of the *korari*
flowers." By degrees this person came nearer, and was seen by the woman,
who said "the man is like Te Atarahi, why, it surely is Te Atarahi." Her
companion replied--"It cannot be Te Atarahi, he is dead." Then they both
looked carefully, and saw that the skin of the man was wrinkled and
hanging loose about his back and shoulders, and that the hair of his
head was all gone.

So the women returned to the *Pa*, and told how they had seen Te
Atarahi. "Are you quite sure it was Te Atarahi?" said the men of the
*Pa*. And the women answered, "His appearance was like Te Atarahi, but
the hair of his head was all gone, and his skin hung loose in folds
about his back." Then one was sent to look at the grave where Te Atarahi
had been buried. He found the grave undisturbed, so he returned and said
"Sirs, the body is well buried, it has not been disturbed." Then the men
went, and examined the place carefully on every side, and found an
opening on one side, a little way off. Then they went to the place where
Te Atarahi had been seen by the women, and there found the man seated on
a *ti* tree. They at once knew him to be Te Atarahi; so they sent for
the *tohunga*. The *tohunga*, came and repeated a *karakia*, after
which, the man was removed to the sacred place, and the *tohunga*
remained with him constantly repeating *karakia*, while the people of
the *Pa* stood without looking on. There the man remained many days,
food being brought for him. Time passed, and he began to have again the
appearance of a

Maori

{p. 47}

man. At length he recovered and got quite well. Then he told how he had
been in the Reigna {*sic*}, how his relations came about him, and bid
him not to touch the food, and sent him back to the land of Light, He
spoke also of the excellence of the state in which the people of the
Reigna {*sic*} dwelt, of their food, of their choice delicacy the
*ngaro*, of the numbers of their *Pa*, and the multitude of the dwellers
there, all which agreed with what the *Atua* have said, when they visit
men on earth.

### NGA PATUPAIAREHE OR FAIRIES.

One day while Ruarangi was absent from his house a Patupaiarehe or Fairy
came to it, and finding only the wife of Ruarangi within, carried her
off to the hills. When the husband returned home his wife could not be
found. He, however, traced footsteps to the hills where the Fairies
dwelt, but saw nothing of his wife. Then he felt sure she had been
carried off by the Fairies, and returned sorrowing and thinking of some
plan to recover her. At length, having thought of a plan, he summoned
the *tohunga* of the tribe--those skilled in bringing back love--those
skilled in *makutu*--in short all the *tohunga*. When these all
assembled before him, he said to them -The cause of my calling you is
this. My wife has disappeared." The *tohunga* replied "When it is night,
all of you leave your houses." So when night came every one came forth
from his house as the *tohunga* had ordered. Then the *tohunga* skilled
in restoring love stood up, and after some while discovered that the
lost woman was with the Fairies. So he commenced a *karakia* to make her
love for her *Maori* husband return.

What wind is this blowing softly to your skin:  
Will you not incline towards your companion, {p. 48}  
To whom you clung, when sleeping together,  
Whom you clasped in your arms,  
Who shared your griefs.  
When the wind bears to you this my love,  
Incline hither thy love,  
Sighing for the couch where both slept.  
Let your love burst forth,  
As the water-spring from its source.

When the *tohunga* had ended this *karakia* he said to the husband "Go,
fetch your wife. When she meets you, be quick to rub her all over with
*kokowai* (red-ochre)." So the man went, and when night came he lay down
to sleep by the way side. While he slept he saw his wife coming to meet
him. With this he awoke knowing well that the *tohunga* had spoken
truly. At day-light he went on his way, and after some time came in
sight of the Pa of the Fairies. No one was within the *Pa*. All had gone
forth to look at the *Maori* woman. Now a great desire towards her
*Maori* husband had come to the woman borne to her by the *karakia* of
the *tohunga*, so the woman said to her Fairy husband "Let me go and
visit my new brothers-in-law." This she said deceitfully; for when her
Fairy husband consented, she went straight away to meet her Maori
husband, who, as soon as she came near, rubbed her all over with
kokowai, and hastened home with her.

Meanwhile the Fairy husband awaited her return. He waited a long while,
and at last went to look for her: at length he discovered footsteps of a
man and woman, then he know she had gone off with her husband. So the
war-party of the Fairies assembled, and went to attack the *Maori* *Pa*.
But they found the posts of the *Pa* daubed over with *kokowai*, and the
leaves used in the

{p. 49}

ovens for cooking, thrown on the roofs of the houses: the *Pa* too was
full of the steam of cooked food. As for the woman, she was placed for
concealment in an oven. So the Fairies feared to come near, for how
could they enter the *Pa* in their dread of the *kokowai*, and the steam
of the ovens which filled the court-yard. So great is their dread of
cooked food.

Then the *tohunga* *Maori* all standing up sung a *karakia* to put to
sleep the Fairies.

Thrust aside, thrust afar,  
Thrust aside your sacredness,  
Thrust aside your *tohunga*:  
Let me, let me mark I you,  
Let me mark your brow,  
Give me thereupon your sacredness,  
You *mana*, your *tohunga*,  
Your *karakia* give me,  
To place beside the oven-stones,  
To place beside the cinders,  
To place beside the *kokowai*.  
Now these rest on your head,  
On your sacred places,  
On your female *Ariki*.  
Your sacredness is undone.

By the time this *karakia* came to an end, all the Fairies were seated
on the ground. Their chief then stood up, and sung thus:--

Alas! for this day  
Which now oppresses me.  
I stretched out my hand  
To the mate of Tirini.  
Followed were my footsteps,  
And charmed was returning love,

\[1. With *kokowai*, or red-ochre.\]

{p. 50}

At Pirongia there.  
This the dreaded tribe is undone,  
Tiki<sup>\[1\]</sup> and Nukupouri<sup>\[1\]</sup>  
And Whanawhana<sup>\[1\]</sup>  
And I Rangi-pouri:<sup>\[1\]</sup>  
I carried off the woman,  
I the first aggressor :  
I went to enter the house of Ruarangi,  
To stretch out my hand,  
To touch the *Maori* skin.  
The boundary is oven-marked,  
To prevent its being moved aside,  
To guard the wife in safety.

He thought the power of his *karakia* would appear but it could not
conquer the devices of the *Maori* *tohunga*; for how could it prevail
against the cooked food, and the oven-stoves, and the *kokowai*, and the
many other devices of the *tohunga*. Hence it was seen that the power of
*karakia* was not possessed by the Fairies. The only power given to them
was to smother men.
