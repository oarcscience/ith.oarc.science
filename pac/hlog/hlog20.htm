<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">KE-AO-MELE-MELE, THE MAID OF THE GOLDEN CLOUD</H3>
<P>THE Hawaiians never found gold in their islands. The mountains being of recent volcanic origin do not show traces of the precious metals; but hovering over the mountain-tops clustered the glorious golden clouds built up by damp winds from the seas. The Maiden of the Golden Cloud belonged to the cloud mountains and was named after their golden glow.</P>
<P>Her name in the Hawaiian tongue was Ke-ao-mele-mele (The Golden Cloud). She was said to be one of the first persons brought by the gods to find a home in the Paradise of the Pacific.</P>
<P>In the ancient times, the ancestors of the Hawaiians came from far-off ocean lands, for which they had different names, such as The Shining Heaven, The Floating Land of Kane, The Far-off White Land of Kahiki, and Kuai-he-lani. It was from Kuai-he-lani that the Maiden of the Golden Cloud was called to live in Hawaii.</P>
<P>In this legendary land lived Mo-o-inanea (self-reliant dragon). She cared for the first</P>
<P>{p. 117}</P>
<P>children of the gods, one of whom was named Hina, later known in Polynesian mythology as Moon Goddess.</P>
<P>Mo-o-inanea took her to Ku, one of the gods. They lived together many years and a family of children came to them.</P>
<P>Two of the great gods of Polynesia, Kane and Kanaloa, had found a beautiful place above Honolulu on Oahu, one of the Hawaiian Islands. Here they determined to build a home for the first-born child of Hina.</P>
<P>Thousands of eepa (gnome) people lived around this place, which was called Waolani. The gods had them build a temple which was also called Waolani (divine forest).</P>
<P>When the time came for the birth of the child, clouds and fogs crept over the land, thunder rolled and lightning flashed, red torrents poured down the hillsides, strong winds hurled the rain through bending trees, earthquakes shook the land, huge waves rolled inland from the sea. Then a beautiful boy was born. All these signs taken together signified the birth of a chief of the highest degree--even of the family of the gods.</P>
<P>Kane and Kanaloa sent their sister Anuenue (rainbow) to get the child of Ku and Hina that they might care for it. All three should be the caretakers.</P>
<P>{p. 118}</P>
<P>Anuenue went first to the place where Mo-o-inanea dwelt, to ask her if it would be right. Mo-o-inanea said she might go, but if they brought up that child he must not have a wife from any of the women of Hawaii-nui-akea (great wide Hawaii).</P>
<P>Anuenue asked, "Suppose I get that child; who is to give it the proper name?"</P>
<P>Mo-o-inanea said: "You bring the child to our brothers and they will name this child. They have sent you, and the responsibility of the name rests on them."</P>
<P>Anuenue said good-by, and in the twinkling of an eye stood at the door of the house where Ku dwelt.</P>
<P>Ku looked outside and saw the bright glow of the rainbow, but no cloud or rain, so he called Hina. "Here is a strange thing. You must come and look at it. There is no rain and there are no clouds or mist, but there is a rainbow at our door."</P>
<P>They went out, but Anuenue had changed her rainbow body and stood before them as a very beautiful woman, wrapped only in the colors of the rainbow.</P>
<P>Ku and Hina began to shiver with a nameless terror as they looked at this strange maiden. They faltered out a welcome, asking her to enter their house.</P>
<P>{p. 119}</P>
<P>As she came near to them Ku said, "From what place do you come?"</P>
<P>Anuenue said: "I am from the sky, a messenger sent by my brothers to get your child that they may bring it up. When grown, if the child wants its parents, we will bring it back. If it loves us it shall stay with us."</P>
<P>Hina bowed her head and Ku wailed, both thinking seriously for a little while. Then Ku said: "If Mo-o-inanea has sent you she shall have the child. You may take this word to her."</P>
<P>Anuenue replied: "I have just come from her and the word I brought you is her word. If I go away I shall not come again."</P>
<P>Hina said to Ku: "We must give this child according to her word. It is not right to disobey Mo-o-inanea."</P>
<P>Anuenue took the child and studied the omens for its future, then she said, "This child is of the very highest, the flower on the top of the tree."</P>
<P>She prepared to take the child away, and bade the parents farewell. She changed her body into the old rainbow colors shining out of a mist, then she wrapped the child in the rainbow, bearing it away.</P>
<P>Ku and Hina went out looking up and watching the cloud of rainbow colors floating in the sky. Strong, easy winds blew and carried this</P>
<P>{p. 120}</P>
<P>cloud out over the ocean. The navel-string had not been cut off, so Anuenue broke off part and threw it into the ocean, where it became the Hee-makoko, a blood-red squid. This is the legendary origin of that kind of squid.</P>
<P>Anuenue passed over many islands, coming at last to Waolani to the temple built by the gnomes under Kane and Kanaloa. They consecrated the child, and cut off another part of the navel-cord. Kanaloa took it to the Nuuanu pali back of Honolulu, to the place called Kaipu-o-Lono. Kane and Kanaloa consulted about servants to live with the boy, and decided that they must have only ugly ones, who would not be desired as wives by their boy. Therefore they gathered together the lame, crooked, deformed, and blind among the gnome people. There were hundreds of these living in different homes, and performing different tasks. Anuenue was the ruler over all of them. This child was named Kahanai-a-ke-Akua (the one adopted by the gods). He was given a very high tabu by Kane and Kanaloa. No one was allowed to stand before him and no person's shadow could fall upon him.</P>
<P>Hina again conceived. The signs of this child appeared in the heavens and were seen on Oahu. Kane wanted to send Lanihuli and Waipuhia, their daughters, living near the pali of Waolani</P>
<P>{p. 121}</P>
<P>and Nuuanu. The girls asked where they should go.</P>
<P>Kane said: "We send you to the land Kuai-he-lani, a land far distant from Hawaii, to get the child of Hina. If the parents ask you about your journey, tell them you have come for the child. Tell our names and refer to Mo-o-inanea. You must now look at the way by which to go to Kuai-he-lani.</P>
<P>They looked and saw a great bird--Iwa. They got on this bird and were carried far up in the heavens. By and by the bird called two or three times. The girls were frightened and looking down saw the bright shining land Kuai-he-lani below them. The bird took them to the door of Ku's dwelling-place.</P>
<P>Ku and Hina were caring for a beautiful girl-baby. They looked up and saw two fine women at their door. They invited them in and asked whence they came and why they travelled.</P>
<P>The girls told them they were sent by the gods Kane and Kanaloa. Suddenly a new voice was heard. Mo-o-inanea was by the house. She called to Ku and to Hina, telling them to give the child into the hands of the strangers, that they might take her to Waka, a great priestess, to be brought up by her in the ohia forests of the island of Hawaii. She named that girl Paliula, and explained to the parents that when</P>
<P>{p. 122}</P>
<P>Paliula should grow up, to be married, the boy of Waolani should be her husband. The girls then took the babe. They were all carried by the bird, Iwa, far away in the sky to Waolani, where they told Kane and Kanaloa the message or prophecy of Mo-o-inanea.</P>
<P>The gods sent Iwa with the child to Waka, on Hawaii, to her dwelling-place in the districts of Hilo and Puna where she was caring for all kinds of birds in the branches of the trees and among the flowers.</P>
<P>Waka commanded the birds to build a house for Paliula. This was quickly done. She commanded the bird Iwa to go to Nuumea-lani, a far-off land above Kuai-he-lani, the place where Mo-o-inanea was now living.</P>
<P>It was said that Waka, by her magic power, saw in that land two trees, well cared for by multitudes of servants; the name of one was "Makalei." This was a tree for fish. All kinds of fish would go to it. The second was "Kalala-ika-wai." This was the tree used for getting all kinds of food. Call this tree and food would appear.</P>
<P>Waka wanted Mo-o-inanea to send these trees to Hawaii.</P>
<P>Mo-o-inanea gave these trees to Iwa, who brought them to Hawaii and gave them to Waka. Waka rejoiced and took care of them. The</P>
<P>{p. 123}</P>
<P>bird went back to Waolani, telling Kane and Kanaloa all the journey from first to last.</P>
<P>The gods gave the girls resting-places in the fruitful lands under the shadow of the beautiful Nuuanu precipices.</P>
<P>Waka watched over Paliula until she grew up, beautiful like the moon of Mahea-lani (full moon).</P>
<P>The fish tree, Makalei, which made the fish of all that region tame, was planted by the side of running water, in very restful places spreading all along the river-sides to the seashore. Fish came to every stream where the trees grew, and filled the waters.</P>
<P>The other tree was planted and brought prepared food for Paliula. The hidden land where this place was has always been called Paliula, a beautiful green spot-a home for fruits and flowers and birds in a forest wilderness.</P>
<P>When Paliula had grown up, Waka went to Waolani to meet Kane, Kanaloa, and Anuenue. There she saw Kahanai-a-ke-Akua (the boy brought up by the gods) and desired him for Paliula's husband. There was no man so splendid and no woman so beautiful as these two. The caretakers decided that they must be husband and wife.</P>
<P>Waka returned to the island Hawaii to prepare for the coming of the people from Waolani.</P>
<P>{p. 124}</P>
<P>Waka built new houses finer and better than the first, and covered them with the yellow feathers of the Mamo bird with the colors of the rainbow resting over. Anuenue had sent some of her own garments of rainbows.</P>
<P>Then Waka went again to Waolani to talk with Kane and Kanaloa and their sister Anuenue.</P>
<P>They said to her: "You return, and Anuenue will take Kahanai and follow. When the night of their arrival comes, lightning will play over all the mountains above Waolani and through the atmosphere all around the temple, even to Hawaii. After a while, around your home the leaves of the trees will dance and sing and the ohia-trees themselves bend back and forth shaking their beautiful blossoms. Then you may know that the Rainbow Maiden and the boy are by your home on the island of Hawaii.</P>
<P>Waka returned to her home in the tangled forest above Hilo. There she met her adopted daughter and told her about the coming of her husband.</P>
<P>Soon the night of rolling thunder and flashing lightning came. The people of all the region around Hilo were filled with fear. Kane-hekili (flashing lightning) was a miraculous body which Kane had assumed. He had gone before the boy and the rainbow, flashing his way through the heavens.</P>
<P>{p. 125}</P>
<P>The gods had commanded Kane-hekili to dwell in the heavens in all places wherever the gods desired him to be, so that he could go wherever commanded. He always obeyed without questioning.</P>
<P>The thunder and lightning played over ocean and land while the sun was setting beyond the islands in the west.</P>
<P>After a time the trees bent over, the leaves danced and chanted their songs. The flowers made a glorious halo as they swayed back and forth in their dances.</P>
<P>Kane told the Rainbow Maiden to take their adopted child to Hawaii-nui-akea.</P>
<P>When she was ready, she heard her brothers calling the names of trees which were to go with her on her journey. Some of the legends say that Laka, the hula-god, was dancing before the two. The tree people stood before the Rainbow Maiden and the boy, ready to dance all the way to Hawaii. The tree people are always restless and in ceaseless motion. The gods told them to sing together and dance. Two of the tree people were women, Ohia and Lamakea. Lamakea is a native whitewood tree. There are large trees at Waialae in the mountains of the island Oahu. Ohia is a tree always full of fringed red blossoms. They were very beautiful in their wind bodies. They were kupuas,</P>
<P>{p. 126}</P>
<P>or wizards, and could be moving trees or dancing women as they chose.</P>
<P>The Rainbow Maiden took the boy in her arms up into the sky, and with the tree people went on her journey. She crossed over the islands to the mountains of the island Hawaii, then went down to find Paliula.</P>
<P>She placed the tree people around the house to dance and sing with soft rustling noises.</P>
<P>Waka heard the chants of the tree people and opened the door of the glorious house, calling for Kahanai to come in. When Paliula saw him, her heart fluttered with trembling delight, for she knew this splendid youth was the husband selected by Waka, the prophetess. Waka called the two trees belonging to Paliula to bring plenty of fish and food.</P>
<P>Then Waka and Anuenue left their adopted children in the wonderful yellow feather house.</P>
<P>The two young people, when left together, talked about their birthplaces and their parents. Paliula first asked Kahanai about his land and his father and mother. He told her that he was the child of Ku and Hina from Kuai-he-lani, brought up by Kane and the other gods at Waolani.</P>
<P>The girl went out and asked Waka about her parents, and learned that this was her first-born brother, who was to be her husband because</P>
<P>{p. 127}</P>
<P>they had very high divine blood. Their descendants would be the chiefs of the people. This marriage was a command from parents and ancestors and Mo-o-inanea.</P>
<P>She went into the house, telling the brother who she was, and the wish of the gods.</P>
<P>After ten days they were married and lived together a long time.</P>
<P>At last, Kahanai desired to travel all around Hawaii. In this journey he met Poliahu, the white-mantle girl of Mauna Kea, the snow-covered mountain of the island Hawaii.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, in Kuai-he-lani, Ku and Hina were living together. One day Mo-o-inanea called to Hina, telling her that she would be the mother of a more beautiful and wonderful child than her other two children. This child should live in the highest places of the heavens and should have a multitude of bodies which could be seen at night as well as in the day.</P>
<P>Mo-o-inanea went away to Nuumea-lani and built a very wonderful house in Ke-alohi-lani (shining land), a house always turning around by day and by night like the ever moving clouds, indeed, it was built of all kinds of clouds and covered with fogs. There she made a spring of flowing water and put it outside for the coming child to have as a bath. There she planted the seeds of magic flowers, Kanikawi and Kanikawa,</P>
<P>{p. 128}</P>
<P>legendary plants of old Hawaii. Then she went to Kuai-he-lani and found Ku and Hina asleep. She took a child out of the top of the head of Hina and carried it away to the new home, naming it Ke-ao-mele-mele (the yellow cloud), the Maiden of the Golden Cloud, a wonderfully beautiful girl.</P>
<P>No one with a human body was permitted to come to this land of Nuumea-lani. No kupuas were allowed to make trouble for the child.</P>
<P>The ao-opua (narrow-pointed clouds) were appointed watchmen serving Ke-ao-mele-mele, the Maiden of the Golden Cloud.</P>
<P>All the other clouds were servants: the ao-opua-kakahiaka (morning clouds), ao-opua-ahiahi (evening clouds), ao-opua-aumoe (night clouds), ao-opua-kiei (peeking clouds), ao-opua-aha-lo (down-looking clouds), ao-opua-ku (image shaped clouds rising at top of sea), opua-hele (morning-flower clouds), opua-noho-mai (resting clouds), opua-mele-mele (gold-colored clouds), opua-lani (clouds high up), ka-pae-opua (at surface of sea or clouds along the horizon), ka-lani-opua (clouds up above horizon), ka-makao-ka-lani (clouds in the eye of the sun), ka-wele-lau-opua (clouds highest in the sky).</P>
<P>All these clouds were caretakers watching for the welfare of that girl. Mo-o-inanea gave them their laws for service.</P>
<P>{p. 129}</P>
<P>She took Ku-ke-ao-loa (the long cloud of Ku) and put him at the door of the house of clouds, with great magic power. He was to be the messenger to all the cloud-lands of the parents and ancestors of this girl.</P>
<P>"The Eye of the Sun" was the cloud with magic power to see all things passing underneath near or far.</P>
<P>Then there was the opua-alii, cloud-chief with the name Ka-ao-opua-ola (the sharp-pointed living cloud). This was the sorcerer and astronomer, never weary, never tired, knowing and watching over all things.</P>
<P>Mo-o-inanea gave her mana-nui or great magic power, to Ke-ao-mele-mele--with divine tabus. She made this child the heir of all the divine islands, therefore she was able to know what was being done everywhere. She understood how the Kahanai had forsaken his sister to live with Poliahu. So she went to Hawaii to aid her sister Paliula.</P>
<P>When Mo-o-inanea had taken the child from the head of Hina, Ku and Hina were aroused. Ku went out and saw wonderful cloud images standing near the house, like men. Ku and Hina watched these clouds shining and changing colors in the light of the dawn, as the sun appeared. The light of the sun streamed over the skies. For three days these changing clouds</P>
<P>{p. 130}</P>
<P>were around them. Then in the midst of these clouds appeared a strange land of the skies surrounded by the ao-opua (the narrow-pointed clouds). In the night of the full moon, the aka (ghost) shadow of that land leaped up into the moon and became fixed there. This was the Alii-wahine-aka-malu (the queen of shadows), dwelling in the moon.</P>
<P>Ku and Hina did not understand the meaning of these signs or shadows, so they went back into the house, falling into deep sleep.</P>
<P>Mo-o-inanea spoke to Hina in her dreams, saying that these clouds were signs of her daughter born from the head-a girl having great knowledge and miraculous power in sorcery, who would take care of them in their last days. They must learn all the customs of kilo-kilo, or sorcery.</P>
<P>Mo-o-inanea again sent Ku-ke-ao-loa to the house of Ku, that cloud appearing as a man at their door.</P>
<P>They asked who he was. He replied: "I am a messenger sent to teach you the sorcery or witcheries of cloud-land. You must have this knowledge that you may know your cloud-daughter. Let us begin our work at this time."</P>
<P>They all went outside the house and sat down on a stone at the side of the door.</P>
<P>Ku-ke-ao-loa looked up and called Mo-o-inanea by name. His voice went to Ke-alohi-lani,</P>
<P>{p. 131}</P>
<P>and Mo-o-inanea called for all the clouds to come with their ruler Ke-ao-mele-mele.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>"Arise, O yellow cloud,<BR>
Arise, O cloud-the eye of the sun,<BR>
Arise, O beautiful daughters of the skies,<BR>
Shine in the eyes of the sun, arise!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><P>Ke-ao-mele-mele arose and put on her glorious white kapas like the snow on Mauna Kea. At this time the cloud watchmen over Kuai-he-lani were revealing their cloud forms to Hina and Ku. The Long Cloud told Hina and Ku to look sharply into the sky to see the meaning of all the cloud forms--which were servants of the divine chiefess, their habits of meeting, moving, separating, their forms, their number, the stars appearing through them, the fixed stars and moving clouds, the moving stars and moving clouds, the course of the winds among the different clouds.</P>
<P>When he had taught Ku and Hina the sorcery of cloud-land, he disappeared and returned to Ke-alohi-lani.</P>
<P>Some time afterward, Ku went out to the side of their land. He saw a cloud of very beautiful form, appearing like a woman. This was resting in the sky above his head. Hina woke up, missed Ku, looked out and saw Ku sitting on the beach watching the clouds above him. She went to him and by her power told him that he had the desire to travel and that he might</P>
<P>{p. 132}</P>
<P>go on his journey and find the woman of his vision.</P>
<P>A beautiful chiefess, Hiilei, was at that time living in one of the large islands of the heavens. Ku and Hina went to this place. Ku married Hiilei, and Hina found a chief named Olopana and married him. Ku and Hiilei had a red-skin child, a boy, whom they named Kau-mai-liula (twilight resting in the sky). This child was taken by Mo-o-inanea to Ke-alohi-lani to live with Ke-ao-mele-mele. Olopana and Hina had a daughter whom they called Kau-lana-iki-pokii (beautiful daughter of sunset), who was taken by Ku and Hiilei.</P>
<P>Hina then called to the messenger cloud to come and carry a request to Mo-o-inanea that Kau-mai-liula be given to her and Olopana. This was done. So they were all separated from each other, but in the end the children were taken to Hawaii.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Paliula was living above Hilo with her husband Kahanai-a-ke-Akua (adopted son of the gods). Kahanai became restless and determined to see other parts of the land, so he started on a journey around the islands. He soon met a fine young man Waiola (water of life).</P>
<P>Waiola had never seen any one so glorious in appearance as the child of the gods, so he fell down before him, saying: "I have never seen</P>
<P>{p. 133}</P>
<P>any one so divine as you. You must have come from the skies. I will belong to you through the coming years."</P>
<P>The chief said, "I take you as my aikane [bosom friend] to the last days."</P>
<P>They went down to Waiakea, a village near Hilo, and met a number of girls covered with wreaths of flowers and leaves. Kahanai sent Waiola to sport with them. He himself was of too high rank. One girl told her brother Kanuku to urge the chief to come down, and sent him leis. He said he could not receive their gift, but must wear his own lei. He called for his divine caretaker to send his garlands, and immediately the most beautiful rainbows wrapped themselves around his neck and shoulders, falling down around his body.</P>
<P>Then he came down to Waiakea. The chief took Kanuku also as a follower and went on up the coast to Hamakua.</P>
<P>The chief looked up Mauna Kea and there saw the mountain women, who lived in the white land above the trees. Poliahu stood above the precipices in her kupua-ano (wizard character), revealing herself as a very beautiful woman wearing a white mantle.</P>
<P>When the chief and his friends came near the cold place where she was sitting, she invited them to her home, inland and mountainward.</P>
<P>{p. 134}</P>
<P>The chief asked his friends to go with him to the mountain house of the beauty of Mauna Kea.</P>
<P>They were well entertained. Poliahu called her sisters, Lilinoe and Ka-lau-a-kolea, beautiful girls, and gave them sweet-sounding shells to blow. All through the night they made music and chanted the stirring songs of the grand mountains. The chief delighted in Poliahu and lived many months on the mountain.</P>
<P>One morning Paliula in her home above Hilo awoke from a dream in which she saw Poliahu and the chief living together, so she told Waka, asking if the dream were true. Waka, by her magic power, looked over the island and saw the three young men living with the three maidens of the snow mantle. She called with a penetrating voice for the chief to return to his own home. She went in the form of a great bird and brought him back.</P>
<P>But Poliahu followed, met the chief secretly and took him up to Mauna Kea again, covering the mountain with snow so that Waka could not go to find them.</P>
<P>Waka and the bird friends of Paliula could not reach the mountain-top because of the cold. Waka went to Waolani and told Anuenue about Paliula's trouble.</P>
<P>Anuenue was afraid that Kane and Kanaloa might hear that the chief had forsaken his sister,</P>
<P>{p. 135}</P>
<P>and was much troubled, so she asked Waka to go with her to see Mo-o-inanea at Ke-alohi-lani, but the gods Kane and Kanaloa could not be deceived. They understood that there was trouble, and came to meet them.</P>
<P>Kane told Waka to return and tell the girl to be patient; the chief should be punished for deserting her.</P>
<P>Waka returned and found that Paliula had gone away wandering in the forest, picking-lehua flowers on the way up toward the Lua Pele, the volcano pit of Pele, the goddess of fire. There she had found a beautiful girl and took her as an aikane (friend) to journey around Hawaii. They travelled by way of the districts of Puna, Kau, and Kona to Waipio, where she saw a fine-looking man standing above a precipice over which leaped the wonderful mist-falls of Hiilawe. This young chief married the beautiful girl friend of Paliula.</P>
<P>Poliahu by her kupua power recognized Paliula, and told the chief that she saw her with a new husband.</P>
<P>Paliula went on to her old home and rested many days. Waka then took her from island to island until they were near Oahu. When they came to the beach, Paliula leaped ashore and went up to Manoa Valley. There she rushed Into the forest and climbed the ridges and precipices. {p. 136} She wandered through the rough places, her clothes torn and ragged.</P>
<P>Kane and Kanaloa saw her sitting on the mountain-side. Kane sent servants to find her and bring her to live with them at Waolani. When she came to the home of the gods in Nuuanu Valley she thought longingly of her husband and sang this mele:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>"Lo, at Waolani is my lei of the blood-red rain,<BR>
The lei of the misty rain gathered and put together,<BR>
Put together in my thought with tears.<BR>
Spoiled is the body by love,<BR>
Dear in the eyes of the lover.<BR>
My brother, the first-born,<BR>
Return, oh, return, my brother."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><P>Paliula, chanting this, turned away from Waolani to Waianae and dwelt for a time with the chiefess Kalena.</P>
<P>While Paliula was living with the people of the cold winds of Waianae she wore leis of mokahana berries and fragrant grass, and was greatly loved by the family. She went up the mountain to a great gulch. She lay down to sleep, but heard a sweet voice saying, "You cannot sleep on the edge of that gulch." She was frequently awakened by that voice. She went on up the mountain-ridges above Waianae. At night when she rested she heard the voices again and again. This was the voice of Hii-lani-wai, who was teaching the hula dance to the</P>
<P>{p. 137}</P>
<P>girls of Waianae. Paliula wanted to see the one who had such a sweet voice, so went along the pali and came to a hula house, but the house was closed tight and she could not look in.</P>
<P>She sat down outside. Soon Hii-lani-wai opened the door and saw Paliula and asked her to come in. It was the first time Paliula had seen this kind of dancing. Her delight in the dance took control of her mind, and she forgot her husband and took Hii-lani-wai as her aikane, dwelling with her for a time.</P>
<P>One day they went out into the forest. Kane had sent the dancing trees from Waolani to meet them. While in the forest they heard the trees singing and dancing like human beings. Hii-lani-wai called this a very wonderful thing. Paliula told her that she had seen the trees do this before. The trees made her glad.</P>
<P>They went down to the seaside and visited some days. Paliula desired a boat to go to the island of Kauai. The people told them of the dangerous waters, but the girls were stubborn, so they were given a very small boat. Hii-lani-wai was steering, and Paliula was paddling and bailing out the water. The anger of the seas did not arise. On the way Paliula fell asleep, but the boat swiftly crossed the channel. Their boat was covered with all the colors of the rainbow. Some women on land at last saw</P>
<P>{p. 138}</P>
<P>them and beckoned with their hands for them to come ashore.</P>
<P>Malu-aka (shadow of peace) was the most beautiful of all the women on Kauai. She was kind and hospitable and took them to her house. The people came to see these wonderful strangers. Paliula told Malu-aka her story. She rested, with the Kauai girls, then went with Malu-aka over the island and learned the dances of Kauai, becoming noted throughout the island for her wonderful grace and skill, dancing like the wind, feet not touching the ground. Her songs and the sound of the whirling dance were lifted by the winds and carried into the dreams of Ke-ao-mele-mele.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Ke-ao-mele-mele was living with her cloud-watchmen and Mo-o-inanea at Ke-alohi-lani. She began to have dreams, hearing a sweet voice singing and seeing a glorious woman dancing, while winds were whispering in the forests. For five nights she heard the song and the sound of the dance. Then she told Mo-o-inanea, who explained her dream, saying: "That is the voice of Paliula, your sister, who is dancing and singing near the steep places of Kauai. Her brother-husband has forsaken her and she has had much trouble. He is living with Poliahu on Hawaii."</P>
<P>When Ke-ao-mele-mele heard this, she thought</P>
<P>{p. 139}</P>
<P>she would go and live with her sister. Mo-o-inanea approved of the thought and gave her all kinds of kupua power. She told her to go and see the god Kane, who would tell her what to do.</P>
<P>At last she started on her journey with her watching clouds. She went to see Hina and Olopana, and Ku and Hiilei. She saw Kau-mai-liula (twilight resting in the sky), who was very beautiful, like the deep red flowers of the ohia in the shadows of the leaves of the tree. She determined to come back and marry him after her journey to Oahu.</P>
<P>When she left Kuai-he-lani with her followers she flew like a bird over the waves of the sea. Soon she passed Niihau and came to Kauai to the place where Paliula was dancing, and as a cloud with her cloud friends spied out the land. The soft mists of her native land were scattered over the people by these clouds above them. Paliula was reminded of her birth-land and the loved people of her home.</P>
<P>Ke-ao-mele-mele saw the beauty of the dance and understood the love expressed in the chant. She flew away from Kauai, crossed the channel, carne to Waolani, met Kane and Kanaloa and told them she had come to learn from them what was the right thing to do for the sister and the husband who had deserted her. Kane suggested a visit to Hawaii to see Paliula and the chief,</P>
<P>{p. 140}</P>
<P>so she flew over the islands to Hawaii. Then she went up the mountain with the ao-pii-kai (a cloud rising from the sea and climbing the mountain) until she saw Poliahu and her beautiful sisters.</P>
<P>Poliahu looked down the mountain-side and saw a woman coming, but she looked again and the woman had disappeared. In a little while a golden cloud rested on the summit of the mountain. It was the maid in her cloud body watching her brother and the girl of the white mountains. For more than twenty days she remained in that place. Then she returned to Waolani on Oahu.</P>
<P>Ke-ao-mele-mele determined to learn the hulas and the accompanying songs. Kane told her she ought to learn these things. There was a fine field for dancing at the foot of the mountain near Waolani, and Kane had planted a large kukui-tree by its side to give it shade.</P>
<P>Kane and his sister Anuenue went to this field and sat down in their place. The daughters of Nuuanu Pali were there. Kane sent Ke-ao-mele-mele after the dancing-goddess, Kapo, who lived at Mauna Loa. She was the sister of the poison-gods and knew the art of sorcery, Ke-ao-mele-mele took gifts, went to Kapo, made offerings, and thus for the first time secured a goddess for the hula.</P>
<P>{p. 141}</P>
<P>Kapo taught Ke-ao-mele-mele the chants and the movements of the different hulas until she was very skilful. She flew over the seas to Oahu and showed the gods her skill. Then, she went to Kauai, danced on the surf and in the clouds and above the forests and in the whirlwinds. Each night she went to one of the other islands, danced in the skies and over the waters, and returned home. At last she went to Hawaii to Mauna Kea, where she saw Kahanai, her brother. She persuaded him to leave the maiden of the snow mantle and return to Waolani. Paliula and her friends had returned to the home with Waka, where she taught the leaves of clinging vines and the flowers and leaves on the tender swinging branches of the forest trees new motions in their dances with the many kinds of winds.</P>
<P>One day Kahanai saw signs among the stars and in the clouds which made him anxious to travel, so he asked Kane for a canoe. Kane called the eepa and the menehune people and told them to make canoes to carry Kahanai to his parents.</P>
<P>These boats were made in the forests of Waolani. When the menehunes finished their boat they carried it down Nuuanu Valley to Puunui. There they rested and many of the little folk came to help, taking the canoe down, step by</P>
<P>{p. 142}</P>
<P>step, to the mouth of the Nuuanu stream, where they had the aid of the river to the ocean.</P>
<P>The menehunes left the boat floating in the water and went back to Waolani. Of the fairy people it was said: "No task is difficult. It is the work of one hand."</P>
<P>On the way down Nuuanu Valley the menehunes came to Ka-opua-ua (storm cloud). They heard the shouting of other people and hurried along until they met the Namunawa people, the eepas, carrying a boat, pushing it down. When they told the eepas that the chief had already started on his journey with double canoes, the eepas left their boat there to slowly decay, but it is said that it lasted many centuries.</P>
<P>The people who made this boat were the second class of the little people living at Waolani, having the characters of human beings, yet having also the power of the fairy people. These were the men of the time of Kane and the gods.</P>
<P>Kahanai and his friends were in their boat when a strong wind swept down Nuuanu, carrying the dry leaves of the mountains and sweeping them into the sea. The waves were white as the boat was blown out into the ocean. Kahanai steered by magic power, and the boat like lightning swept away from the islands to the homes of Ku. and Hina. The strong wind and</P>
<P>{p. 143}</P>
<P>the swift current were with the boat, and the voyage was through the waves like swift lightning flashing through clouds.</P>
<P>Ku and Hiilei saw the boat coming. Its signs were in the heavens. Ku came and asked the travellers, "What boat is this, and from what place has it come?"</P>
<P>Kahanai said, "This boat has come from Waolani, the home of the gods Kane and Kanaloa and of Ke-ao-mele-mele."</P>
<P>Then Ku asked again, "Whose child are you?"</P>
<P>He replied, "The son of Ku and Hina."</P>
<P>"How many other children in your family?"</P>
<P>He said: " There are three of us. I am the boy and there are two sisters, Paliula and Ke-ao-mele-mele. I have been sent by Ke-ao-mele-mele to get Kau-mai-liula and Kau-lana-iki-pokii to go to Oahu."</P>
<P>Ku and his wife agreed to the call of the messenger for their boy Kau-mai-liula.</P>
<P>When Kahanai saw him he knew that there was no other one so fine as this young man who quickly consented to go to Oahu with his servants.</P>
<P>Ku called for some beautiful red boats with red sails, red paddles,-everything red. Four good boatmen were provided for each boat, men who came from the land of Ulu-nui-the land of the yellow sea and the black sea of Kane--and obeyed the call of Mo-o-inanea. They had</P>
<P>{p. 144}</P>
<P>kupua power. They were relatives of Kane and Kanaloa.</P>
<P>The daughter of Hina and Olopana, Kau-lana-iki-pokii, cried to go with her brother, but Mo-o-inanea called for her dragon family to make a boat for her and ordered one of the sorcerer dragons to go with her and guard her. They called the most beautiful shells of the sea to become the boats for the girl and her attendants. They followed the boats of Kahanai. With one stroke of the paddles the boats passed through the seas around the home of the gods. With the second stroke they broke through all the boundaries of the great ocean and with the third dashed into the harbor of old Honolulu, then known as Kou.</P>
<P>When the boats of Kahanai and Kau-mai-liula came to the surf of Mamala, there was great shouting inland of Kou, the voices of the eepas of Waolani. Mists and rainbows rested over Waolani. The menehunes gathered in great multitudes at the call of Kane, who had seen the boats approaching.</P>
<P>The menehune people ran down to lift up the boats belonging to the young chief. They made a line from Waolani to the sea. They lifted up the boats and passed them from hand to hand without any effort, shouting with joy.</P>
<P>While these chiefs were going up to Waolani, {p. 145} Ke-ao-mele-mele came from Hawaii in her cloud boats.</P>
<P>Kane had told the menehunes to prepare houses quickly for her. It was done like the motion of the eye.</P>
<P>Ke-ao-mele-mele entered her house, rested, and after a time practised the hula.</P>
<P>The chiefs also had houses prepared, which they entered.</P>
<P>The shell boats found difficulty in entering the bay because the other boats were in the way. So they turned off to the eastern side of the harbor. Thus the ancient name of that side was given Ke-awa-lua (the second harbor, or the second landing-place in the harbor). Here they landed very quietly. The shell boats became very small and Kau-lana and her companions took them and hid them in their clothes. They went along the beach, saw some fish. The attendants took them for the girl. This gave the name Kau-lana-iki-pokii to that place to this day. As they went along, the dragon friend made the signs of a high chief appear over the girl. The red rain and arching bow were over her, so the name was given to that place, Ka-ua-koko-ula (blood rain), which is the name to this day.</P>
<P>The dragon changed her body and carried the girl up Nuuanu Valley very swiftly to the house</P>
<P>{p. 146}</P>
<P>of Ke-ao-mele-mele (the maiden of the golden cloud) without the knowledge of Kane and the others. They heard the hula of Ke-ao-mele-mele. Soon she felt that some one was outside, and looking saw the girl and her friend, with the signs of a chief cover her.</P>
<P>So she called:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>"Is that you, O eye of the day?<BR>
O lightning-like eye from Kahiki,<BR>
The remembered one coming to me.<BR>
The strong winds have been blowing,<BR>
Trembling comes into my breast,<BR>
A stranger perhaps is outside,<BR>
A woman whose sign is the fog,<BR>
A stranger and yet my young sister,<BR>
The flower of the divine home-land,<BR>
The wonderful land of the setting sun<BR>
Going down into the deep blue sea.<BR>
You belong to the white ocean of Kane,<BR>
You are Kau-lana-iki-pokii,<BR>
The daughter of the sunset,<BR>
The woman coming in the mist,<BR>
In the thunder and the flash of lightning<BR>
Quivering in the sky above.<BR>
Light falls on the earth below.<BR>
The sign of the chiefess,<BR>
The woman high up in the heavens,<BR>
Kau-lana-iki-pokii,<BR>
Enter, enter, here am I."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><P>Those outside heard the call and understood that Ke-ao-mele-mele knew who they were. They entered and saw her in all the beauty of her high divine Wood.</P>
<P>They kissed. Kau-lana told how she had come. Ke-ao-mele-mele told the dragon to go</P>
<P>{p. 147}</P>
<P>and stay on the mountain by the broken pali at the head of Nuuanu Valley. So she went to the precipice and became the watchman of that place. She was the first dragon on the islands. She watched with magic power. Later, Mo-o-inanea came with many dragons to watch over the islands. Ke-ao-mele-mele taught her young sister the different hulas and meles, so that they were both alike in their power.</P>
<P>When the young men heard hula voices in the other houses they thought they would go and see the dancers. At the hour of twilight Waolani shook as if in an earthquake, and there was thunder and lightning.</P>
<P>The young men and Anuenue went to the house and saw the girls dancing, and wondered how Kau-lana had come from the far-off land.</P>
<P>Ke-ao-mele-mele foretold the future for the young people. She told Kau-lana that she would never marry, but should have magic medicine power for all coming days, and Kahanai should have the power over all customs of priests and sorcerers and knowledge of sacrifices, and should be the bosom friend of the medicine-goddess. She said that they would all go to Waipio, Hawaii. Kane, Kanaloa, and Anuenue approved of her commands.</P>
<P>Ke-ao-mele-mele sent Kau-lana to Hawaii to tell Paliula to come and live with them at Waipio</P>
<P>{p. 148}</P>
<P>and find Kahanai once more. Kau-lana hastened to Hawaii in her shell boat. She called, "O my red shell boat of the deep blue sea and the black sea, come up to me."</P>
<P>The shell boat appeared on the surface of the sea, floating. The girl was carried swiftly to Hawaii. There she found Waka and Paliula and took them to Waipio. They lived for a time there, then all went to Waolani to complete the marriage of Ke-ao-mele-mele to Kau-mai-liula.</P>
<P>Kane sent Waka and Anuenue for Ku and Hiilei, Hina and Olopana with Mo-o-inanea to come to Oahu.</P>
<P>Mo-o-inanea prepared large ocean-going canoes for the two families, but she and her people went in their magic boats.</P>
<P>Mo-o-inanea told them they would never return to these lands, but should find their future home in Hawaii.</P>
<P>Waka went on Ku's boat, Anuenue was with Hina. Ku and his friends looked back, the land was almost lost; they soon saw nothing until the mountains of Oahu appeared before them.</P>
<P>They landed at Heeia on the northern side of the Nuuanu precipice, went over to Waolani, and met all the family who had come before.</P>
<P>Before Mo-o-inanea left her land she changed it, shutting up all the places where her family</P>
<P>{p. 149}</P>
<P>had lived. She told all her kupua dragon family to come with her to the place where the gods had gone. Thus she made the old lands entirely different from any other lands, so that no other persons but gods or ghosts could live in them.</P>
<P>Then she rose up to come away. The land was covered with rainclouds, heavy and black. The land disappeared and is now known as "The Hidden Land of Kane."</P>
<P>She landed on Western Oahu, at Waialua, so that place became the home of the dragons, and it was filled with the dragons from Waialua to Ewa.</P>
<P>This was the coming of dragons to the Hawaiian Islands.</P>
<P>At the time of the marriage of Ke-ao-mele-mele and Kau-mai-liula, the Beautiful Daughter of Sunset came from the island Hawaii bringing the two trees Makalei and Makuukao, which prepared cooked food and fish. When she heard the call to the marriage she came with the trees. Makalei brought great multitudes of fish from all the ocean to the Koo-lau-poko side of the island Oahu. The ocean was red with the fish.</P>
<P>Makuukao came to Nuuanu Valley with Kau-lana, entered Waolani, and provided plenty of food.</P>
<P>{p. 150}</P>
<P>Then Makalei started to come up from the sea.</P>
<P>Kau-lana-iki-pokii told the gods and people that there must not be any noise when that great tree came up from the sea. They must hear and remain silent.</P>
<P>When the tree began to come to the foot of the pali, the menehunes and eepas were astonished and began to shout with a great voice, for they thought this was a mighty kupua from Kahiki coming to destroy them.</P>
<P>When they had shouted, Makalei fell down at the foot of the pali near Ka-wai-nui, and lies there to this day. So this tree never came to Waolani and the fish were scattered around the island.</P>
<P>Kau-lana's wrath was very great, and he told Kane and the others to punish these noisy ones, to take them away from this wonderful valley of the gods. He said, "No family of these must dwell on Waolani." Thus the fairies and the gnomes were driven away and scattered over the islands.</P>
<P>For a long time the Maiden of the Golden Cloud and her husband, Twilight Resting in the Sky, ruled over all the islands even to the mysterious lands of the ocean. When death came they laid aside their human bodies and never made use of them again-but as aumakuas,</P>
<P>{p. 151}</P>
<P>or ghost-gods, they assumed their divine forms, and in the skies, over the mountains and valleys, they have appeared for hundreds of years watching over and cheering their descendants.</P>
