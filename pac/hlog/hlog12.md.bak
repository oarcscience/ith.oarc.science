### KAUHUHU, THE SHARK-GOD OF MOLOKAI

THE story of the shark-god Kauhuhu has been told under the legend of
"Aikanaka the (Man-eater)," which was the ancient name of the little
harbor Pukoo, which lies at the entrance to one of the beautiful valleys
of the island of Molokai. The better way is to take the legend as
revealing the great man-eater in one of his most kindly aspects. The
shark-god appears as the friend of a priest who is seeking revenge for
the destruction of his children. Kamalo was the name of the priest. His
heiau, or temple, was at Kaluaaha, a village which faced the channel
between the islands of Molokai and Maui. Across the channel the rugged
red-brown slopes of the mountain Eeke were lost in the masses of clouds
which continually hung around its sharp peaks. The two boys of the
priest delighted in the glorious revelations of sunrise and sunset
tossed in shattered fragments of cloud color, and rejoiced in the
reflected tints which danced to them over the swift channel-currents. It
is no wonder that the courage of sky and sea entered into the hearts

{p. 50}

of the boys, and that many deeds of daring were done by them. They were
taught many of the secrets of the temple by their father, but were
warned that certain things were sacred to the gods and must not be
touched. The high chief, or alii, of that part of the island had a
temple a short distance from Kaluaaha, in the valley of the harbor which
was called Aikanaka. The name of this chief was Kupa. The chiefs always
had a house built within the temple walls as their own residence, to
which they could retire at certain seasons of the year. Kupa had two
remarkable drums which he kept in his house at the heiau. His skill in
beating his drums was so great that they could reveal his thoughts to
the waiting priests.

One day Kupa sailed far away over the sea to his favorite
fishing-grounds. Meanwhile the boys were tempted to go to Kupa's heiau
and try the wonderful drums. The valley of the little harbor Aikanaka
bore the musical name Mapulehu. Along the beach and over the ridge
hastened the two sons of Kamalo. Quickly they entered the heiau, found
the high chief's house, took out his drums and began to beat upon them.
Some of the people heard the familiar tones of the drums. They dared not
enter the sacred doors of the heiau, but watched until the boys became
weary of their sport and returned home. {p. 51} When Kupa returned they
told him how the boys had beaten upon his sacred drums. Kupa was very
angry, and ordered his mu, or temple sacrifice seekers, to kill the boys
and bring their bodies to the heiau to be placed on the altar. When the
priest Kamalo heard of the death of his sons, in bitterness of heart he
sought revenge. His own power was not great enough to cope with his high
chief; therefore he sought the aid of the seers and prophets of highest
repute throughout Molokai. But they feared Kupa the chief, and could not
aid him, and therefore sent him on to another kaula, or prophet, or sent
him back to consult some one the other side of his home. All this time
he carried with him fitting presents and sacrifices, by which he hoped
to gain the assistance of the gods through their priests. At last he
came to the steep precipice which overlooks Kalaupapa and Kalawao, the
present home of the lepers. At the foot of this precipice was a heiau,
in which the great shark-god was worshipped. Down the sides of the
precipice he climbed and at last found the priest of the shark-god. The
priest refused to give assistance, but directed him to go to a great
cave in the bold cliffs south of Kalawao. The name of the cave was
Anao-puhi, the cave of the eel. Here dwelt the great shark-god Kauhuhu
and his guardians or watchers, Waka and Mo-o, the great dragons or
reptiles

{p. 52}

of Polynesian legends. These dragons were mighty warriors in the defence
of the shark-god, and were his kahus, or caretakers, while he slept, or
when his cave needed watching during his absence.

Kamalo, tired and discouraged, plodded along through the rough lava
fragments piled around the entrance to the cave. He bore across his
shoulders a black pig, which he had carried many miles as an offering to
whatever power he could find to aid him. As he came near to the cave the
watchmen saw him and said:--

"E, here comes a man, food for the great \[shark\] Mano. Fish for
Kauhuhu." But Kamalo came nearer and for some reason aroused sympathy in
the dragons. "E hele! E hele!" they cried to him. "Away, away! It is
death to you. Here's the tabu place." "Death it may be--life it may be.
Give me revenge for my sons--and I have no care for myself." Then the
watchmen asked about his trouble and he told them how the chief Kupa had
slain his sons as a punishment for beating the drums. Then he narrated
the story of his wanderings all over Molokai, seeking for some power
strong enough to overcome Kupa. At last he had come to the shark-god-as
the final possibility of aid. If Kauhuhu failed him, he was ready to
die; indeed he had no wish to live. The mo-o assured him of

{p. 53}

their kindly feelings, and told him that it was a very good thing that
Kauhuhu was away fishing, for if he had been home there would have been
no way for him to go before the god without suffering immediate death.
There would have been not even an instant for explanations. Yet they ran
a very great risk in aiding him, for they must conceal him until the way
was opened by the favors of the great gods. If he should be discovered
and eaten before gaining the aid of the shark-god, they, too, must die
with him. They decided that they would hide him in the rubbish pile of
taro peelings which had been thrown on one side when they had pounded
taro. Here he must lie in perfect silence until the way was made plain
for him to act. They told him to watch for the coming of eight great
surf waves rolling in from the sea, and then wait in his place of
concealment for some opportunity to speak to the god because he would
come in the last great wave. Soon the surf began to roll in and break
against the cliffs.

Higher and higher rose the waves until the eighth reared far above the
waters. and met the winds from the shore which whipped the curling crest
into a shower of spray. It raced along the water and beat far up into.
the cave, breaking into foam, out of which the shark-god emerged. At
once he took his human form and

{p. 54}

walked around the cave. As he passed the rubbish heap he cried out: "A
man is here. I smell him." The dragons earnestly denied that any one was
there, but the shark-god said, "There is surely a man in this cave. If I
find him, dead men you are. If I find him not, you shall live." Then
Kauhuhu looked along the walls of the cave and into all the
hiding-places, but could not find him. He called with a loud voice, but
only the echoes answered, like the voices of ghosts. After a thorough
search he was turning away to attend to other matters when Kamalo's pig
squealed. Then the giant shark-god leaped to the pile of taro leavings
and thrust them apart. There lay Kamalo and the black pig which had been
brought for sacrifice.

"Oh, the anger of the god!  
Oh, the blazing eyes!"

Kauhuhu instantly caught Kamalo and lifted him from the rubbish up
toward his great mouth. Now the head and shoulders are in Kauhuhu's
mouth. So quickly has this been done that Kamalo has had no time to
think. Kamalo speaks quickly as the teeth are coming down upon him. "E
Kauhuhu, listen to me. Hear my prayer. Then perhaps eat me." The
shark-god is astonished and does not bite. He takes Kamalo from his
mouth and says: "Well for you that you spoke quickly. Perhaps you have a

{p. 55}

good thought. Speak." Then Kamalo told about his sons and their death at
the hands of the executioners of the great chief, and that no one dared
avenge him, but that all the prophets of the different gods had sent him
from one place to another but could give him no aid. Sure now was he
that Kauhuhu alone could give him aid. Pity came to the shark-god as it
had come to his dragon watchers when they saw the sad condition of
Kamalo. All this time Kamalo had held the hog which he had carried with
him for sacrifice. This he now offered to the shark-god. Kauhuhu,
pleased and compassionate, accepted the offering, and said: "E Kamalo.
If you had come for any other purpose I would eat you, but your cause is
sacred. I will stand as your kahu, your guardian, and sorely punish the
high chief Kupa."

Then he told Kamalo to go to the heiau of the priest who told him to see
the shark-god, take this priest on his shoulders, carry him over the
steep precipices to his own heiau at Kaluaaha, and there live with him
as a fellow-priest. They were to build a tabu fence around the heiau and
put up the sacred tabu staffs of white tapa cloth. They must collect
black pigs by the four hundred, red fish by the four hundred, and white
chickens by the four hundred. Then they were to wait patiently for the
coming of Kauhuhu. It was to be a strange coming. On the island Lanai,
far

{p. 56}

to the west of the Maui channel, they should see a small cloud, white as
snow, increasing until it covered the little island. Then that cloud
would cross the channel against the wind and climb the mountains of
Molokai until it rested on the highest peaks over the valley where Kupa
had his temple. "At that time," said Kauhuhu, "a great rainbow will span
the valley. I shall be in the care of that rainbow, and you may clearly
understand that I am there and will speedily punish the man who has
injured you. Remember that because you came to me for this sacred cause,
therefore I have spared you, the only man who has ever stood in the
presence of the shark-god and escaped alive." Swiftly did Kamalo go up
and down precipices and along the rough hard ways to the heiau of the
priest of the shark-god. Gladly did he carry him up from Kalaupapa to
the mountain-ridge above. Quickly did he carry him to his home and there
provide for him while he gathered together the black pigs, the red fish,
and the white chickens within the sacred enclosure he had built. Here he
brought his family, those who had the nearest and strongest claims upon
him. When his work was done, his eyes burned with watching the clouds of
the little western island Lanai. Ah, the days passed by so slowly! The
weeks and the months came, so the legends say, and still Kamalo waited
in patience. At last one day

{p. 57}

a white cloud appeared. It was unlike all the other white clouds he had
anxiously watched during the dreary months. Over the channel it came. it
spread over the hillsides and climbed the mountains and rested at the
head of the valley belonging to Kupa. Then the watchers saw the glorious
rainbow and knew that Kauhuhu had come according to his word.

The storm arose at the head of the valley. The winds struggled into a
furious gale. The clouds gathered in heavy black masses, dark as
midnight, and were pierced through with terrific flashes of lightning.
The rain fell in floods, sweeping the hillside down into the valley, and
rolling all that was below onward in a resistless mass toward the ocean.
Down came the torrent upon the heiau belonging to Kupa, tearing its
walls into fragments and washing Kupa and his people into the harbor at
the mouth of the valley. Here the shark-god had gathered his people.
Sharks filled the bay and feasted upon Kupa and his followers until the
waters ran red and all were destroyed. Hence came the legendary name for
that little harbor--Aikanaka, the place for man-eaters.

It is said in the legends that "when great clouds gather on the
mountains and a rainbow spans the valley, look out for furious storms of
wind and rain which come suddenly, sweeping down the

{p. 58}

valley." It also said in the legends that this strange storm which came
in such awful power upon Kupa spread out over the adjoining lowlands,
carrying great destruction everywhere, but it paused at the tabu staff
of Kamalo, and rushed on either side of the sacred fence, not daring to
touch any one who dwelt therein. Therefore Kamalo and his people were
spared. The legend has been called "Aikanaka" because of the feast of
the sharks on the human flesh swept down into that harbor by the storm,
but it seems more fitting to name the story after the shark-god Kauhuhu,
who sent mighty storms and wrought great destruction.
