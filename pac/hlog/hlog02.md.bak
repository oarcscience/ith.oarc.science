# FOREWORD

The advancement of a people is profoundly influenced by three factors,
namely: the source and quality of their food supply; their contacts and
associations with other peoples; and their religious beliefs and
activities.

It is, perhaps, the last factor that influences people most in matters
respecting their intellectual development, especially when these beliefs
and activities are laid out along rational lines. As intelligence
increases, knowledge is gained concerning the various phenomena of life
and the relation that man bears to the forces of nature that have an
influence over him. Until such a state of intelligence is attained, the
developing race conceives for itself gods, ghosts, and other
supernatural forms to give it the connected relations between itself and
the things and phenomena of nature which cannot be understood. Through
the instrumentality of these supernatural forms, the imagination of a
people is developed. Songs and legends originate, blending accounts of
the lives and exploits of the living and dead with those of the
supernatural beings, and in time these form literature and develop arts
of great value to the people.

The ethnology of the peoples of the Pacific is an interesting and
profitable field for study, and especially is this true of the
Hawaiians, for during the period within the knowledge of man they have
shown capacity for rapid intellectual development. In the dawn of their
history they had no written language, but they were rich in songs and
legends, not only of their own exploits, but also of their relations
with the superior influences that guided their destinies. These were
repeated at fireside and feast, until the imagination of the people
became directive and resourceful. So there should be little wonder that
they learned readily and that their transformation under organized
government and institutions was rapid.

The chapters that follow are replete with the richness of the imagery
peculiar to the Polynesian, and no doubt none will appreciate this
volume of legends more than the people of Hawaii themselves. May it
serve them as a light showing the path they have trod in passing through
the valley of superstition to the high lands of truth and understanding.

The author is to be congratulated because of the patience and
persistence with which he has worked in this little-known field of
ethnology and also for the dearness and completeness of his narrative.
As this part of the world comes

into the full measure of its importance may this book of "Legends of
Ghosts and Ghost-gods" win wide appreciation as a contribution to our
knowledge of the Pacific Islands.
