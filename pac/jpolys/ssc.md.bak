THE SAMOAN STORY OF CREATION—*A 'Tala.'*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span class="small"></span>

   The Polynesian Society is indebted to Dr. John Fraser of Sydney for
permission to reproduce in this Journal his paper originally pnblished
in the "Transactions of the Royal Society, N.S.W.," 1891, on the "Samoan
story of Creation." With equal kindness be lent us the Rev. Mr. Powell's
original MS. text in the Samoan language, which is reproduced here after
correction by the Rev. S. Ella of Sydney and himself. The Samoan text
was not published by the Royal Society, but we have been induced to
produce it here, for the same reason that other papers have been printed
in the native languages in this Journal, *i.e.*, in order that it may be
read by the natives themselves. We thereby hope to induce members of the
native races to contribute original matter bearing on their traditions,
*&c*.

   It appears to us that this "Story of Creation" is of a high order,
and may be classed with the best of the creation myths of other branches
of the Polynesian race.

   The Rev. T. Powell in securing this valuable tradition, the Rev. G.
Pratt in translating it, and Dr. J. Fraser in editing and annotating it,
have conferred a lasting benefit on the Samoans in particular and the
Polynesians in general, which the descendants of the present people will
as time goes on, appreciate more and more when education and refinement
increase amongst them.

   The exalted supremacy ascribed to Tangaloa in this myth, is
characteristic of the Western Polynesians, (and some others—no doubt
derivative) but we venture to suggest that further researches will prove
that other branches of the race ascribed the same high position to Tane,
and that probably the latter are a distinct migration into the
Pacific.—E<span class="small">DITORS</span>.

   I<span class="small">NTRODUCTION</span>—<span
id="text_1"></span>[1](#notes_1.md). All nations have traditions or
speculations as to their own origin, and these often include a
Cosmogony, by which they endeavour to account for the existence of the
world, or at least of their own land, and for the creation of men to be
its inhabitants. Our own Australian blacks, whom some ethnologists
wrongly describe as the lowest of human beings, speak of a great
Creator, known by such tribal names as Baiamai, Punjil, Nuralli, who
made them and all things, and who still lives in the heavens above; in
the work of creation, he carried a great knife, with which to shape the
toil of his hands; in this work he is assisted by a *demiourgos* whom
the <span id="page_185">p. 185</span> Kamalarai tribe call Dharamulan,
and certain birds and animals are also associated with him as agents;
Punjil first made two men each of a lump of clay, which he gradually
fashioned from the feet upwards into the human form; and, as the figures
grew in symmetry and beauty, he danced round them, well satisfied with
his work; then he breathed very hard on them and they lived, and began
to move about as full-grown men. The one had straight hair, and the
other had curly hair.

   <span id="text_2"></span>[2](#notes_2.md). Punjil's brother had control
of all waters, great and small; and so, one day, he brought up by a hook
from a muddy-pool two young women, and they became the companions of the
two men. Some time after, Punjil came down and visited the camp of the
blacks; and, becoming very angry, he used his great knife on the men,
women, and children there, and cut them into very small pieces, which
still lived and wriggled about like worms; these he carried into the
sky, and then dropped them wherever he pleased; the pieces became men
and women, and peopled the whole land. Baiamai gave to the blacks their
sacred songs and their social institutions.

   There is not much of a Cosmogony in this tale, for it tells us only
how men were brought into being, and how Australia came to be occupied
by straight-haired and curly-haired blacks; but I have introduced it
here, because it bears some relation to the Polynesian myth which I am
now to make known to you.

   <span id="text_3"></span>[3](#notes_3.md). The Polynesian race of the
Eastern Pacific has an elaborate system of Cosmogony, which aims at
explaining how the heavens were created and sustained, how gods and men
came to be, how their own islands arose; but the details thereof vary
much as given by the wise men in the various groups. Of the varying
forms of the great Myth of Creation, the one I have here from Sāmoa
seems to me to be the purest and the noblest, and to be the original
from which the others have come. Any one who knows Polynesia would
reasonably expect this to be so, for, in many respects, the Sāmoans are
a nobler people than most of the other islanders; they have a strong
claim to be considered the parents of the race; and their highest chiefs
and priests were the depositories of the old traditions and beliefs. The
present myth was communicated by one of these old chiefs, Taua-nu‘u of
Manu‘a, and as Mr. Powell who got it had his full confidence, I have no
doubt that this is a genuine and uncorrupted record. In estimating
value, we must always bear in mind that natives consider their
traditional records as property which ought not to be shared with
stangers; if circumstances compel them to open their stores against
their will to foreigners, they so abridge or mutilate the narrative that
<span id="page_166">p. 166</span> it is then of little value, and, only
when there is mutual confidence and trust as between friends, will they
consent to tell the tale in its fulness and purity. Now, it is evident
that this condition of friendship existed between Taua-nu‘u and Mr.
Powell. Hence my belief in the genuineness of this record.

   <span id="text_4"></span>[4](#notes_4.md). There is much simple dignity
in the opening sentence of the myth—"The god Tangaloa dwelt in the
Expanse" as the sole intelligence there. He was soon to be the creator
of all things, but as yet there was no sky, no sea, no land. He moved to
and fro in the Expanse.

   It is noticeable that this opening sentence of the myth assumes the
prior existence of three things before the work of creation began—(1) an
Expanse or Firmament, (2) an intelligent and self-existing creative
principle, 'le atua Tagaloa,' the god Tangaloa, and (3) the material
wherewith to form the earth. There is here no notion that the earth was
formed out of nothing. There is, however, an implied belief in the
eternity of matter,—the matter, at least, which became the primitive
*papa*, 'rock.' And also there was an Expanse, a sort of illimitable
space—and that is a necessary belief in every creation-myth, but there
was no sky, that is, no cloud-land or rain-land such as is now over the
earth, and there was Tangaloa, moving to and fro at will in the Expanse.
I therefore take Tangaloa to be the Aether of other cosmogonies,—the
bright and pure principle of light and heat which existed before the
sun, and which spread everywhere in that earliest state of things which
we call Chaos. And, as this myth goes on, we shall find that, according
to Polynesian belief, after the heavens and the earth had been made,
this same Tangaloa places himself in the highest heavens, the Ninth, the
clearest empyrean—where no cloud ever comes,—and there he dwells, calm
and undisturbed, in his fale‘ula, his 'palace of brightness.' So I see
nothing sordid in these three Polynesian ideas; the whole presents
itself to me as a very chaste opening to a Creation-myth.

   In this same sense, Charles Kingsley eloquently says:—"Those
simple-hearted forefathers of ours said within themselves 'Where is the
All-father'? Then they lifted up their eyes to the clear, blue sky, the
boundless firmament of heaven. That never changed; that was always the
same. The clouds and storms rolled far below it, and all the bustle of
this noisy world; but there the sky was still, as bright and calm as
ever. The All-Father must be there, unchangeable in the unchanging
heaven; bright, and pure, and boundless, like the heaven; and like the
heavens too, silent and far off. So they named him after the heaven,
Tuisco—the God who lives in the clear heaven, <span id="page_167">p.
167</span> the heavenly father. He was the Father of Gods and men; and
man was the son of Tuisco and Hertha—heaven and earth."

   Now as to the meaning and derivation of the name Tangaloa, I may call
to your remembrance the fact that the Anglo-Saxon god-name, Tuisco, is
of the same origin as the *Eng*. word day and *Lat*. dies; the old Aryan
root is dyu or div, 'to shine,' which gives other god-names, the *Sans*.
Dyaus and deva, the *Gr*. Zeus and Zēn, and the *Lat*. Jupiter, Jovis,
as well as the common noun divus. The idea common to them all is that of
'bright, lustrous, beaming,' and this fits in with the fact that
Tangaloa dwells in the empyrean above. But, in seeking for a derivation
of the name Tangaloa, I call to mind the Polynesian tradition that
originally the sky lay flat on the lower world, lalo-langi, as they call
it, the 'under-the-sky,' and that the nine heavens, being now propped
up, surround the earth and envelope it on all sides. Therefore I divide
the name Tangaloa into two parts tanga and loa; in Samoan the verb
ta‘ai, that is, takai ( = tangai) means, to 'wind round' like an ulcer
encircling a limb, and ta‘aiga is a 'roll,' of mats or tobacco or the
like. In the Maori dialect, tangai is the 'bark' or 'rind,' that which
'envelopes,' and takai is a 'wrapper'; in Samoan tanga is a 'bag,' that
which 'envelopes' or 'encloses.' I would therefore say that the name was
at first Tanga-la, then lengthened into Tanga-loa,—'the god that
encompasses all things,' 'the encircling Aether'; but, as -la is not a
common formative in Polyesian dialects, at least so far as I know, it is
quite possible that -loa is a separate word, and may be the Samoan loa,
'long,' 'far off.'

   <span id="text_5"></span>[5](#notes_5.md). The myth next goes on to say
that, in his wandering to and fro in the Expanse, Tangaloa one day stood
still, and then there grew up păpă, 'a rock,' for him to rest on. In
another Samoan myth, 'le Solo o le Va,' Tangaloa is, at another time,
weary of flying over the waste of waters, and no sooner does he express
a wish for a resting place, than an island rises up from the deep for
him. In both cases, there is no laborious work of creation ascribed to
him, but his wish or his need at once produces the result desired. There
is certainly some dignity in this.

   The word păpă, in Samoan, means 'rock,' but in other dialects it also
means 'foundation,' 'anything level or flat,' and pala, means 'mud.' Now
I take the myth here to indicate that, by the exercise of his will
alone, Tangaloa caused to spring up, out of chaos, first the solid
foundation-material out of which the Earth, the Sea, the Sky, were
afterwards evolved by separate fiats or acts of creation; for the myth
then declares that he spake to the Rock, saying, 'Be thou split <span
id="page_168">p. 168</span> open,' and there came forth, as if by
successive efforts of parturition, various kinds of foundation-stuff,
then the Earth, then the Sea, and Fresh-water, and the Sky, and
'Prince-Prop-up-sky,' and Immensity, and Space, and Height, and, last of
all, Man, as a physical being, but not yet endowed with intelligence.
Unlike the original papa, all of these come into existence, not at his
will, but by the power of a separate command of evolution for each.

   I am not much concerned to explain how, on natural principles, the
Sea, and the Sky, and Man himself, can have been produced by this papa,
but the succession of ideas in this Samoan myth is consistent; for first
comes the Rock or Foundation—the physical origin of all things—then the
varieties of rock, which are soon united to form the Earth; then the
Sea, 'le tai,' is made to surround the Earth and lave its shores; then
its counterpart, 'le vai,' Fresh-water, appears on the Earth; hitherto
Earth and Sky had been as one, but now the Sky is lifted up above the
earth and secured in its place by props; then the dimensions Length,
Breadth, and Height appeared; and then, all things being ready for him,
Man came upon the scene.

   <span id="text_6"></span>[6](#notes_6.md). But Man was yet a dull, inert
mass of matter; so Tangaloa created Spirit, and Heart, and Will, and
Thought, and put them within him, and thus Man became a living soul.
Here the myth duly recognises the composite nature of man, and that too
with a precision scarcely to be expected from Polynesians.

   <span id="text_7"></span>[7](#notes_7.md). The Kosmos had been, to some
extent, arranged already as Land, Sea, and Sky, but now that Man is to
dwell on earth, Tangaloa proceeds to make him comfortable; and so he
sends Immensity and Space, as a wedded pair, to dwell in the sky above;
he bids another pair, 'Two-clouds' and 'Two-fresh-water-bottles,' attend
to the supply of water from the clouds, and another pair to people the
Sea. Meanwhile the man and his wife are to people the earth on its
southern side. But now a catastrophe seems to have happened, for
Tui-te‘e-langi, the Polynesian Atlas, found himself unable any longer to
support the weight of the sky, and so it fell down on the earth once
more. Then Tui bethought him of two native plants that grow, spread out
a-top like an umbrella; with these he propped up the sky, and it has
never fallen since! In this connection, it is curious to note that our
Australian Aborigines believe similarly that the sky is held up by
props, and they have a tradition that the props once broke, and then the
wizards had great work to do in getting the sky propped up again.

   <span id="text_8"></span>[8](#notes_8.md). The wedded pair, Immensity
and Space, that had a little before been removed from the earth to the
sky, now brought forth children— <span id="page_169">p. 169</span> Night
and Day, and these two, by their united action, produced the Sun and the
Stas; these two dwell in the First Heavens, the region of alternate
darkness and brightness. Immensity and Space next gave birth to
Le-Langi, 'the clear, blue sky'; that is the Second Heavens. Langi then
produces all the other heavens up to the Ninth, and each of these is
peopled by Immensity and Space. All this means that, above the cloud
land of the First Heaven, everything is serene, calm, and clear, and
everywhere there is illimitable extension of space. So it must have
appeared, at all events, to the earliest of myth-makers, when they
turned their thoughts from earth to heaven.

   <span id="text_9"></span>[9](#notes_9.md). Our myth now turns to the
creation of the other gods; every one of these, however, is a Tangaloa,
and is therefore not a seperate and independant being, but only a phase,
as it were, of the supreme Tangaloa—a distinct manifestation of himself
in some one or other of his functions. These he created, but the word
used here fa‘a-tupu, only implies that he 'caused them to grow up' or to
be. Of all these facets of himself, he makes Tangaloa-le-fuli, 'the
immoveable,' to be the chief, for up there, in his domain, the Ninth
Heavens, the clouds 'never roll along' (le fuli), the storms below never
come nigh, and all is tranquility and peace.

   <span id="text_10"></span>10. The myth next shows the Sāmoan pride of
race, for it makes Sāmoa and Manu‘a to be brothers to the Sun and the
Moon. And yet we cannot believe that the Polynesians are akin to the
rulers of the Celestial Empire. After these, the other islands of the
Pacific, as known to Sāmoans,—Tonga and Fiji and the Eastern groups—are
made to spring up at the will of 'Tangaloa-the-creator-of-lands.' This
is a much more dignified account of things than that which is given in
some other Polynesian legends, which say that, while one of the gods was
engaged in fishing in the sea, he pulled up with his line an island here
and there; and that had not the line at last broken with the pull, some
of these islands might have been continents.

   <span id="text_11"></span>[11](#notes_11.md). But the newly-created
islands are, as yet, rough and rugged and unfit for the occupation of
man; and so 'Tangaloa-the-creator' comes down and treads upon them, and
prepares them for people to dwell in. And he looked on all his work, and
said, 'It is good.' To people these lands, he causes Tangaloa-sāváli to
take a native climbing-plant, a Fue, and lay it outside in the sun.
Under the Sun's heat, its juice brought forth a great multitude of
worms; these Tangaloa fashioned into men and women, and gave them
intelligence, and thus he peopled the lands. This Fue must represent
some echo of the original creation of mankind by God, for our myth says,
at its close, <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> that Fue was the son of
Tangaloa, and there is still in Sāmoa a variety of this vine, which is
called Fue-sā, the 'sacred vine.' And, to Sāmoans, such origination of
life is intelligible; for they have experience of animal life as a
product of the sun's heat, to procure oil, they slice their cocoa-nuts
into lumps, and leaving a heap of this 'copra' exposed in a canoe, they
find that it soon produces oil and worms.

   <span id="text_12"></span>[12](#notes_12.md). As a parallel to this
account of the origin of man, I now refer to the Australian tradition
with which I began this introduction. There the creation-god is Baiamai,
that is, Bai-bai, an intensive and therefore honorific name, formed from
the Australian root-word ba, 'to cause to be,' 'to make'; similarly, the
verb punjilko, that is, punjil with the infinitive suffix -ko added,
means 'to cut out,' 'to shape,' 'to make'; hence Baimai and Punjil
simply mean 'the creator.' In his creative work, Punjil uses a knife
wherewith to shape all things; similarly Tangaloa cuts and shapes the
vine-worms 'into member'd forms.' Punjil too, when he wishes the land to
be occupied, cuts the people into small worm-like pieces and scatters
them about. Tangaloa declares himself well pleased with his handiwork;
Punjil, in delight, dances around the clay image of the man which he was
making. Tangaloa gives spirit and heart to animate man; Punjil breathes
hard on his image and the man lives, Tangaloa, in one of his aspects, is
the lord of the sea; Punjil's brother is the lord of all waters. Baiamai
gave to the Australians all their socal regulations; so also, among the
Polynesians, all authority comes from Tangaloa; he gave them kingly
rule, and the right of holding councils, and enjoined them to live in
peace.

   And thus, in folk-lore and in tradition myths, parallel stories may
be found in the most unlikely quarters, all the world over and these
parallels can scarcely have proceeded from merely a similar power of
invention in so many diverse nations; they seem to indicate a common
origin.

TRANSLATION.

   <span id="text_13"></span>[13](#notes_13.md). The god Tangaloa dwelt in
the Expanse; he made all things; he alone was \[there\]; not any sky,
not any country; he only went to and fro in the Expanse; there was also
no sea, and no earth; but, at the place where he stood there grew up a
rock. Tangaloa-fa‘a-tutupu-nu‘u was his name; all things were about to
be made, by him, for all things were not yet made; the sky was not made
nor any thing else; but there grew up a Rock on which he stood.

   <span id="text_14"></span>[14](#notes_14.md). Then Tangaloa said to the
Rock, 'Be thou split up.' Then was brought forth Papa-taoto; after that,
Papa-sosolo; then Papa-lau-a‘au; then Papa-‘ano-‘ano; then Papa-‘ele;
then Papa-tu; then Papa-‘amu-‘amu and his children.

   <span id="text_15"></span>[15](#notes_15.md). But Tangaloa stood facing
the west, and spoke to the Rock. Then Tangaloa struck the Rock with his
right hand, and it split open towards the right side. Then the Earth was
brought forth (that is the parent of all the people in the world), and
the Sea was brought forth. Then the Sea covered the Papa-sosolo; and
Papa-nofo \[that is, Papa-taoto\] said to Papa-sosolo, 'Blessed are you
in \[the possession of\] your sea.' Then said Papa-sosolo 'Don't bless
me; the sea will soon reach you too.' All the rocks in like manner
called him blessed.

   <span id="text_16"></span>[16](#notes_16.md). Then Tangaloa turned to
the right side, and the Fresh-water sprang up. Then Tangaloa spake again
to the Rock, and the Sky was produced. He spake again to the Rock and
Tui-te‘e-langi was brought forth; then came forth Ilu, 'Immensity,' and
Mamao, 'Space,' came (that was a woman); then came Niuao.

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

   <span id="text_17"></span>[17](#notes_17.md). Tangaloa spake again to
the Rock; then Lua‘o, a boy, came forth. Tangaloa spake again to the
Rock, and Lua-vai, a girl, came forth. Tangaloa appointed these two to
the Sā-tua-langi.

   <span id="text_18"></span>[18](#notes_18.md). Then Tangaloa spoke again,
and Aoa-lālā, a boy was born, and \[next\] Ngao-ngao-le-tai, a girl;
then came Man; then came the Spirit; then the Heart; then the Will; then
Thought.

   <span id="text_19"></span>[19](#notes_19.md). That is the end of
Tangaloa's creations which were produced from the Rock; they were only
floating about on the sea<span
id="page_176_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_176_note_*.md); there was was no
fixedness there.

   <span id="text_20"></span>[20](#notes_20.md). Then Tangaloa made an
ordinance to the rock and said:—

   (1) Let the Spirit and the Heart and Will and Thought go on and join
together inside the Man; and they joined together there and man became
intelligent. And this was joined to the earth ('ele-ele'), and it was
called Fatu-ma-le-‘Ele-‘ele, as a couple,<span
id="page_176_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_176_note_dagger.md) Fatu the man,
and ‘Ele-‘ele, the woman.

   (2) Then he said to Immensity and Space, 'Come now; you two be united
up above in the sky with your boy Niuao, then they went up; there was
only a void, nothing for the sight to rest upon.

   (3) Then he said to Lua-‘o and Lua-vai, 'Come now, you two, that the
region of fresh-water may be peopled.'

   (4) But he ordains Aoa-lālā and Ngao-ngao-le-tai to the sea, that
they two may people the sea.

   (5) And he ordains Le-Fatu and Le-‘Ele-‘ele, that they people this
side; he points them to the left-hand side, opposite to Tua-langi.

   (6) Then Tangaloa said to Tui-te‘e-langi, 'Come here now; that you
may prop up the sky.' Then it was propped up; it reached up on high. But
it fell down because he was not able for it. Then Tui-te‘e-langi went to
Masoa and Teve; he brought them and used them as props; then he was
able. (The *masoa* and the *teve* were the first plants that grew, and
other plants came afterwards). Then the sky remained up above, but there
was nothing for the sight to rest upon. There was only the far-receding
sky, reaching to Immensity and Space.

   <span id="text_21"></span>[21](#notes_21.md). Then Immensity and Space
brought forth offspring; they brought forth Po and Ao, 'Night and Day,'
and this couple was ordained by Tangaloa to produce the 'Eye of Sky,'
\[the Sun\]. Again Immensity and Space brought forth Le-Langi; that is
the Second Heavens; for Tui-te‘e-langi went forth to prop it up and the
sky became double; and Immensity and Space remained there, and they
peopled the sky. Then again Langi brought forth, and Tui-te‘e-langi went
forth and propped it up; that was the Third Heavens; that was peopled by
Immensity and Space. Then Langi bore again; that was the Fourth Heavens.
Tui-te‘e-langi went forth to prop it up; that heaven also was peopled by
Ilu and Mamao. Then Langi bore again; that was the Fifth Heavens. Then
went forth Tui-te‘e-langi to prop it up; that heaven also was peopled by
Ilu and Mamao. Langi brought forth again; that was the Sixth Heavens.
And Tui-te‘e-langi went and propped it up; that heaven was peopled by
Ilu and Mamao. Then Langi bore again; that was the Seventh Heavens. And
Tui-te‘e-langi went forth and propped it up; that heaven was peopled by
Ilu and Mamao. Then Langi again brought forth; that was called the
Eighth Heavens. Tui-te‘e-langi went to prop up that heaven; and that
heaven was peopled by Ilu and Mamao. Then again Langi brought forth;
that was the Ninth Heavens; and it was propped up by Tui-te‘e-langi; and
that heaven was peopled by Ilu and Mamao. Then ended the productiveness
of Ilu and Mamao; it reached to the Ninth Heavens.

   <span id="text_22"></span>[22](#notes_22.md). Then Tangaloa sat
\[still\]; he is well known as Tangaloa-fa‘a-tutupu-nu‘u; then he
created Tangaloa-lē-fuli, and Tangaloa-asiasi-nu‘u, and
Tangaloa-tolo-nu‘u, and Tangaloa-sāváli, and Tuli also, and Longonoa.

   <span id="text_23"></span>23. Then said Tangaloa, the creator, to
Tangaloa-lē-fuli, 'Come here; be thou chief in the heavens.' Then
Tangaloa, 'the immoveable,' was chief in the heavens.

   <span id="text_24"></span>[24](#notes_24.md). Then Tangaloa, the
creator, said to Tangaloa-sāváli, 'the messenger,' 'Come here; be thou
ambassador in all the heavens, beginning from the Eighth Heavens down to
the First Heavens, to tell them all to gather together in the Ninth
Heavens, where Tangaloa, the immoveable, is chief. Then proclamation was
made that they should go up to the Ninth Heavens, and then visit below
the children of Night and Day in the First Heavens.

   <span id="text_25"></span>[25](#notes_25.md). Then Tangaloa, the
messenger, went down to Night and Day in the First Heavens, and asked
them thus:—'Have you two any children appointed to you? And they
answered, 'Come here; these two are our children, appointed to us,
Langi-‘uli and Langi-mā.'

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

   <span id="text_26"></span>[26](#notes_26.md). All the stars also were
their offspring, but we do not have the names of all the stars (the
stars had each it own name), for they are forgotten now, because they
dropped out of use. And surely the last injunction of Tangaloa, the
creator, to Night and Day was that they should produce the
Eye-of-the-Sky. That was the reason Tangaloa, the messenger, went down
to ask Night and Day in the First Heavens \[if they had any children\].

   <span id="text_27"></span>[27](#notes_27.md). Then answered Night and
Day, 'Come now; there remain four boys that are not yet
appointed,—Manu‘a, Sāmoa, the Sun, and the Moon.'

   <span id="text_28"></span>[28](#notes_28.md). These are the boys that
originated the names of Sāmoa and Manu‘a; these two were the children of
Night and Day. The name of the one is Sā-tia-i-le-moa, 'obstructed by
the chest'; the meaning of which is this:—the boy seemed as if he would
not be born, because he was caught by the chest; therefore it was he was
called Sā-tia-i-le-moa, that is, Sāmoa; the other was born with one side
abraded ('manu‘a'); then said Day to Night 'Why is this child so greatly
wounded?' therefore the child was called 'Manu‘a-tele.'

   <span id="text_29"></span>29. Then said Tangaloa, the messenger, 'It
is good; come now; go up into the Ninth Heavens, you four; all are about
to gather together there to form a Council; go up you two also.' Then
they all gathered together in the Ninth Heavens,—the place where dwelt
Tangaloa, the creator, and Tangaloa, the immoveable; the Council was
held in the Ninth Heavens; the ground where they held the Council was
Malaē-a-Toto‘a, 'the council ground of Tranquillity.'

   <span id="text_30"></span>[30](#notes_30.md). Then various decrees were
made in the Ninth Heavens; the children of Ilu and Mamoa were appointed
all of them to be builders, and to come down from the Eighth Heavens to
this \[earth\] below; perhaps they were ten thousand in all that were
appointed to be builders; they had one name all were \[called\]
Tangaloa. Then they built houses for the Tangaloa; but the builders did
not reach to the Ninth Heavens—the home of Tangaloa-lē-fuli—which was
called the 'Bright House' \[fale-‘ula\].

   <span id="text_31"></span>31. Then said Tangaloa, the creator, to
Night and Day:—'Let those two boys go down below to be chiefs over the
offsprings of Fatu and ‘Ele-‘ele.' But to the end of the names of the
two boys was attached the name of Tangaloa-lē-fuli who is king ('tupu')
of the Ninth Heavens; hence the \[Samoan\] kings ('tupu') were named
'Tui o Manu‘a-tele ma Samoa atoa.'

   <span id="text_32"></span>[32](#notes_32.md). Then Tangaloa, the
creator, said to Night and Day:—'Let those two boys, the Sun and the
Moon, go and follow you two; when day comes, let the Sun follow; also
when Night comes, the Moon too comes on.' These two are the shades of
Tangaloa; they are well-known in all the world; the Moon is the shade of
Tangaloa; but thus runs the decree of Tangaloa, the creator,—Let there
be one portion of <span id="page_179">p. 179</span> the heavens, in
which they pass along; in like manner also shall the Stars pass along.'

   <span id="text_33"></span>[33](#notes_33.md). Then Tangaloa, the
messenger, went to and fro to visit the land; his visit began in the
place where are (now) the Eastern groups; these groups were made to
spring up; then he went off to cause the group of Fiji to grow up; but
the space between seemed so far off that he could not walk it; then he
stood there and turned his face to the Sky, \[praying\] to Tangaloa, the
creator, and Tangaloa, the immoveable; Tangaloa looked down to Tangaloa,
the messenger; and he made the Tongan group spring up; then that land
sprang up.

   <span id="text_34"></span>[34](#notes_34.md). Then he turns his face to
this Manu‘a; and looks up to the heavens, for he is unable to move
about; then Tangaloa, the creator and Tangaloa, the immovable, looked
down, and caused Savai‘i to spring up; then that land grew up.

   <span id="text_35"></span>[35](#notes_35.md). Then Tangaloa, the
messenger, went back to the heavens, and said—'We have (now) got
countries, the Eastern group and the Fiji group, and the Tongan group,
and Savai‘i.' Then, as all these lands were grown up, Tangaloa, the
creator, went down in a black cloud to look at the countries, and he
delighted in them; and he said, 'It is good;' then he stood on the top
of the mountains to tread them down, that the land might be prepared for
people to dwell in. Then he returned \[on high\]. And Tangaloa, the
creator, said \[to Tangaloa, the messenger\],—'Come now; go back by the
road you came; take people to possess the Eastern groups; take Atu and
Sasa‘e; that is a pair; they were called conjointly Atu-Sasae; these two
people came from the heavens from among the children of Tangaloa.

   <span id="text_36"></span>36. Then Tangaloa, the messenger, went
again to the Fiji group; he also again took two persons, a pair—their
names were Atu and Fiji—from among all the children of Tangaloa; so that
group of islands was called Atu-Fiji.

   <span id="text_37"></span>37. Then he turned his face towards Tonga;
he took \[with him\] a couple; their names were Atu and Tonga; these two
peopled that group of islands; their names were the Atu-Tonga; these two
were the people of Tangaloa.

   <span id="text_38"></span>[38](#notes_38.md). Then Tangaloa, the
messenger, came back to this Manu‘a, to Le-Fatu and Le-‘Ele-‘ele and
their children; because the command of Tangaloa, the creator, \[had gone
forth\] from the heavens, that Le-Fatu and Le-‘Ele-‘ele should go there
to people this side of the world. Then went out Valu‘a and Ti‘ăpă to
people Savai‘i; these two are the children of Le-Fatu and Le-‘Ele-‘ele;
these two people are from this Manu‘a; Savai‘i and this Manu‘a are one;
these two were the parents of I‘i and Sava; I‘i was the girl, and Sava
was the boy; that island was peopled by them, and was named Savai‘i.

   <span id="text_39"></span>[39](#notes_39.md). And Tangaloa, the
messenger, went again to this Manu‘a; then he stood and faced the sky,
as if he were making a prayer; then <span id="page_180">p. 180</span>
Tangaloa, the creator looked down, and the land of Upólu sprang up. Then
Tangaloa, the messenger, stood and again faced the heavens towards
Tangaloa, the creator; and Tangaloa, the creator, looked down from the
heavens, and the land of Tutuila sprang up.

   <span id="text_40"></span>[40](#notes_40.md). Then Tangaloa, the
messenger, turned to the heavens, and said, 'Two lands are now gotten
for me to rest in. And Tangaloa, the creator, said, 'Come now, go you
with the Peopling-vine; take it and place it outside in the sun; leave
it there to bring forth; when you see it has brought forth, tell me.'
Then he took it and placed it in Salēa-au-mua, a council-ground, which
is now called the Malae-of-the-sun. Then Tangaloa, the messenger, was
walking to and fro; and he visited the place where the Fue was; he went
there and it had brought forth. Then he went back again to tell
Tangaloa, the creator, that the Fue had brought forth. Then Tangaloa,
the creator, first went down; he went to it; he looked, and it had
brought forth something like worms; wonderful was the multitude of
worms; then Tangaloa, the creator, shred them into stripes, and
fashioned them into members, so that the head, and the face, and the
hands, and the legs were distinguishable; the body was now complete,
like a man's body; he gave them heart and spirit; four persons grew up;
so this land was peopled; there grew up Tele and Upólu, which are the
children of the Fue; Tutu and Ila, that is a pair; these are the
children of Fue; four persons, Tele and Upólu, Tutu and Ila. Tele and
Upólu were placed to people the land of Upolu-tele; but Tutu and Ila,
they two were to people the land now called Tutuila.

   <span id="text_41"></span>41. Fue, the son of Tangaloa, that came
down from heaven, had two names, Fue-tangata and Fue-sa; he peopled the
two flat lands.

   <span id="text_42"></span>[42](#notes_42.md). Then Tangaloa gave his
parting command thus; 'Always show respect to Manu‘a; if any one do not,
he will be overtaken by calamity; but let each one do as he likes with
his own lands.'

   <span id="text_43"></span>[43](#notes_43.md). \[Here\] the story of the
creation of Sāmoa finishes with this parting command, which was given at
Malae-lā.

NOTES TO THE STORY OF CREATION.

   P<span class="small">AR</span>. <span
id="notes_1"></span>[1](#text_1.md). *Punjil*; for an account of Punjil and
his works, see R. Brough Smyth's "Aborigines of Victoria," Vol. I., and
for Baiamai, see Ridley's "Kamilaroi."

   *Baiamai*; in the text I have given this form of the name, for it is
the common one; but I think that it ought to be written Ba-ye-mai; for
*ba* is the root 'to make,' *ba-yé* means 'one who makes,' and *mai* is
a formative termination.

   *Kamalarai*; this name for a native language and tribe in New South
Wales has always been written Kamilaroi; but the composition of the word
requires the spelling Kámălarai, for it is made up of *ka* (dialect
*kya*) 'not,' -*mal* and -*arai*‘ which are common formative suffixes.

   *Dhara-mulan*; a demiurge figures in many of the ancient cosmogonies.
The Egyptian demiurge Thoth created light for the world, while as yet
there was no sun, and in the Orphic hymns, light exists before the sun;
*cf*. [note 4](#notes_4.md) s. v. *Aether*. <span id="page_181">p.
181</span> In the Kamalarai legends, Dhara-mulan seems to have a
two-fold aspect, and hence the -*mulan* in his name may be the word
*bula*, 'two.'

   *Breathed very hard*; *cf*. "He breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life." The Polynesian here and in other respects agrees with the
Egyptian and the Hebrew Cosmogonies, which commence with chaos, regard
light as anterior to the sun, postulate the moulding hand of a deity in
creation and a divine breath as the source of life. The Polynesian
cosmogony has also, the idea of the unity of God; for the gods are all
Tangaloa. It agrees with the Avesta in tracing creation to the will of a
deity and in ascribing perfection—"it is good"—to the thing created;
Ahuramazda is the sole creator who made heaven and earth and men. In
India also, the Self-existing One *by a thought* made the waters. The
Babylonian Cosmogony considers water as the primal element from which
life came; the Polynesian does not.

   <span id="notes_2"></span>[2](#text_2.md). *Punjil's brother*; *cf*. the
relation of Zeus to Poseidon.

   *Cut into pieces*; *cf*. the Hebrew verb *bârâ*, 'to create,' which
properly means 'to fashion,' 'to shape.'

   *Worms*; *cf*. a subsequent [note on *Fue-tagata*](#notes_40.md).

   <span id="notes_3"></span>[3](#text_3.md). *The details thereof*; for
these, see Rev. Dr. Gill's "Myths and Songs" and Sir George Grey's
"Polynesian Mythology."

   <span id="notes_4"></span>[4](#text_4.md). *Le atua Tagaloa*; this
expression shows that this myth is not modern; for the word *atua*,
'god,' was almost obsolete when the first missionaries went to Samoa.

   *Aether*; some commentators on Gen., I., 1-2 assert that the Ancient
Jews believed the sky to be a solid vault, but that in its original
state (verse 1) it was a liquid expanse; the 'separation' of the
material of heaven and earth took place on the second day of creation
(verses 6-8).

   *Envelopes*; the Polynesian conception of the Heavens does not seem
to include a belief that they encompass the world *all round* like a
circle—not spheres, but crescent-shaped vaults. This also is the Hebrew
notion; *cf*. "He that sitteth upon the circle of the earth; that
stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a
tent to dwell in" (Is. xl., 22). "He walketh in the circuit of heaven"
(Job. xxii., 14).

   *Fale-ula*; *cf*. the 'Solo o le Va.'

   <span id="notes_5"></span>[5](#text_5.md). *Papa*; not a 'rock' in our
sense of the word, but merely 'something flat and solid'; cf. Gen. I.,
6-8. In the sense of 'foundation,' *papa* has numerous correspondences
in the Hebrew Scriptures; *cf*. Isaiah xxxi., 17, "the earth's
foundation quake"—the foundations which support the visible frame of the
earth.

   *Separate fiats*; this cosmogony is thus theistical, not
pantheistical.

   *Prince Prop-up-sky*; Tui-te‘e-langi; his place here, among the
physioal creations of Tangaloa, shows that he is not a god—not a
Tangaloa,—but a sort of physical Atlas.

   *The sky is lifted up*; *cf*. the English word 'heaven' and the
Scotch, 'lift.'

   <span id="notes_6"></span>[6](#text_6.md). *Dull, inert mass*; it had
the worm-life from the Fue-sā, but that was all.

   <span id="notes_7"></span>[7](#text_7.md). *Southern side*; the limited
knowledge which the ancients had of geography led them to regard the
north as hyperborean; and thus the south was to them the habitable part
of the globe.

   <span id="notes_8"></span>[8](#text_8.md). *Sun and stars*; so also in
Genesis I., the sun does not appear till the fourth day. In our myth,
there is no mention of the moon till further on.

   <span id="notes_9"></span>[9](#text_9.md). *Ninth Heavens*; 'three times
three'; *cf*. the notes on this point in the 'Solo o le Va.' In the
"Records of the past," we read of the 'nine gods, the masters of
things,' and of a 'holy nine.' As the basis of their numeration, the
Polynesians have—one, two, three; they have no knowledge of seven as a
perfect number.

   *Tranquillity and peace*; *cf*. the notes on this point in the 'Solo
o le Va.'

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

   *For the occupation of man*; it seems to me that whatever is
essential to the Polynesian idea of creation is contained in this
verse—"He that created (*bârâ*) the heavens" &c. (Is. xlii., 5) see
below, [note 13](#notes_13.md).

   <span id="notes_11"></span>[11](#text_11.md). *Outside in the sun*;
*cf*. the reverence given to the scarabæus, as a product of the Nile mud
under the heat of the sun.

   *Fashioned into men*; *cf*. Heb. *bârâ*, as above.

   <span id="notes_12"></span>[12](#text_12.md). *Into member'd forms*; see
the 'Solo o le Va.'

   <span id="notes_13"></span>[13](#text_13.md). *The god Tangaloa*. He is
the great god of the Polynesians; *cf*. the notes on 'Solo o le Va.'

   *The Expanse*; 'va-nimo-nimo' is the word used here. *Va* means space
between any two things; it may be as small a space as that between two
laths on a partition wall or the planking of a ship's deck; but it may
include as much as the east is distant from the west; *nimo-nimo* means
'far, far distant.' I therefore take *va-nimo-nimo* to mean 'vastly
extended space'—so vast that the mind cannot compass it. In Samoan,
*nimo-nimo* is said of anything that has quite passed from the memory;
and a lark soaring aloft, and thus going out of sight, would be said to
be *nimo-nimo*. The word *mamao*, which occurs further on, also means
'space,' but it seems to differ from *va-nimo-nimo* in that it is used
of a measurable distance between objects; it may be translated
'extension.' The difference may thus be translated, 'extension.' The
difference may thus be that *va-nimo-nimo* is 'unlimited extension,'
whereas *mamao* is 'limited extension.' In Genesis I., 6, the
'firmament' is the Hebrew *rakíā*, that which is 'spread out,' and seems
to correspond with the 'expanse' here. In Genesis I., 2, "the Spirit of
God moved ('brooded') on the face of the waters;" here it is said that
Tangaloa *fe-alu-alu-mai*, 'goes backwards and forwards;' *alu* means to
'go;' the prefix *fe* has a reciprocal force; *alu-alu* is a
reduplication of intensity; the -*mai* is a formative termination. In
the 'Solo o le Va,' Tuli, which is the *ata* or spirit-emblem of
Tangaloa-savali, is tired of moving to and fro, and desires a place to
rest on; forthwith up sprang Manua's Rock. So also in this myth; where
Tangaloa halted from his wandering to and fro, on that spot a Rock
sprang up. In line 32 of that same Solo, the footstool of Tangaloa is
called *taa-tuga*, 'that on which he stands;' with this compare "Heaven
is my throne, earth is my footstool, . . . what is the place of my
rest?" Here comes in the ancient idea that the heavens were a solid
vault; *cf*. *Gr*. 'stereoun,' 'stereoma;' *Lat*. 'firmamentum.'

   *He made all things*, 'na faia mea uma;' with this compare, "And
without him was not anything made that was made."

   *No earth*; the word here is *lau-‘ele‘ele*, which means 'land spread
out;' *‘ele‘ele* elsewhere is merely 'earth, soil, dirt,' the *lau* here
prefixed denotes 'breadth;' *cf*. the 'broad-bosomed earth' of Hesiod.
With the meaning of *lau-‘ele‘ele* compare Isaiah xlii., 5, "Thus saith
God the Lord, he that created (*cf*. Heb. *bârâ*) the heavens, and
stretched them out (*cf*. Samoan *va-nimo-nimo* and Heb. *rakía*); he
that *spread forth* the earth (*cf*. *lau-‘ele‘ele*) and that which
cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it (*cf*.
'Solo o le Va'), and spirit (*cf*. *anga-anga*) to them that walk
therein." The Hebrew verb there, '*rākâ*,' properly signifies to spread
out by 'trampling' on with the feet, or 'beating' into thin plates. In
Samoan, *lau* has a similar reference; for, of its compounds,
*lau-lelei* means 'even, level,' *lau-papa* is a 'board, a plank,'
*lau-tele* is 'wide,' and *lāu* itself, as a prefix to verbs, denotes
'uniformity' and 'universality' as if 'spread out.'

   *T.-fa‘a-tutupu-nu‘u*; here *fa‘a* (dialects *ba-ka*, *fa-ka*,
*wha-ka*) is a causative prefix to verbs, very abundantly used in
Polynesian; *tupu*, as a verb, means 'to grow,' 'to spring up;' *tutupu*
is its plural form; *nu‘u*, means 'a country,' 'a district.' The whole
name thus means 'Tangaloa, the creator of lands.'

   *A rock grew up*; 'tupu ai le papa'

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

   <span id="notes_14"></span>[14](#text_14.md). *Be thou split open*;
'māvae ia,' said of parturition; *māvae*, 'to open as a crack;' hence
*māvava*, 'to yawn.'

   *Brought forth*; the word is *fanau*, which is also applied to the
extrusion of gum from trees. The next acts of creation are in the text
expressed in each case, by *toe fanau*, 'again it brought forth,' but,
for brevity, our translation says only 'after that;' 'then.' With
*fanau* compare: "Before the mountains were brought forth." (*Heb*.
yullād)—Psalm xc., 2.

   *Papa*, 'rock;' it also means 'plain, level, flat,' and that meaning
is in harmony with the 'spread out' of the note above. To the Polynesian
myth-makers, their mountains, being mostly volcanic, do not belong the
earliest stages of creation. The various kinds of 'papa' are indicated
by the epithets attached—viz., *ta‘oto*, 'to lie down;' *sosolo*, 'to
run,' 'to spread like creeping-plants;' *lau-a‘au*, 'resembling a flat
reef' (*a‘au* is a 'reef,' and to 'swim:' *lau* denotes uniformity);
*‘ano-‘ano* is 'honey-comb;' *‘ele* is a sort of volcanic mud or shale,
so soft that it can be cut with an axe; *tu* means 'to stand' (its
derivative, *tugā*, means 'standing in the way,' as a rock in the middle
of the road); *‘amu-‘amu* is a kind of 'branching coral,' branching like
fingers.

   *Children*; the word here is *pau*, not *fanau*, 'offspring.'

   <span id="notes_15"></span>[15](#text_15.md). *Facing the west*; in the
ancient auguries and other ceremonials, the position of the celebrant
was important.

   *Towards the right*. Mr. Powell says here—"In the direction of
*tualagi*, 'the back of the sky' the north," *cf*. Ovid Meta I. 2, 45.
'Right' and 'left' are equivalent to 'north' and 'south,' *cf*. Ps.
lxxxix., 12; Is. liv., 8. To the Kelts of Sootland and Ireland, the
'right' hand is still the 'south' hand (deas for *deaks*, 'right;' *cf*.
*Gr*. dex-ios, *Lat*. dex-ter, 'right'); because when the face is turned
towards the east, the south is on the right. An old custom among
them—said to have come down from the Druids—is called deas-iùil, 'a turn
to the right;' because, in all their solemn processions, the company, in
order to secure a blessing, turns to the right, and, keeping the object
on the right, marches round it 'three times' in the same direction as
the daily course of the sun. The motion in a contrary way is car-tual,
and is considered unlucky; in Lowland Scotch this is called a
widder-sins motion.

   *World*; *lalo-lagi*, 'under-the-sky.'

   *Earth*; *‘ele-‘ele*; this is a reduplication of *‘ele*, 'red-earth,'
'rust,' 'dirt,' 'blood;' see *‘ele-‘ele*. It is interesting to remember
here that the Hebrew word *adâmâh* (*cf*. Adam), 'the earth,' 'the
tilled ground,' comes from a root meaning to be 'red,' and is applied
also to the 'dust' which mourners use.

   *That is the parent, &c.* With this compare, "And the Lord God formed
man of the dust of the ground."

   *The sea*; *sami*, 'the salt water' (Lat. *sal*), not *tai*. In
Genesis i., 10, as here also, 'the seas' (Heb. *yâmim*) are gathered
together when the dry land (Heb. *yâbésh*, 'anything that is dried up or
becomes dry') appears. The Samoan word *tai* means 'the sea, the tide;'
the distinction between it and *sami* seems to be that *tai* is the sea
where it flows upon the land, but *sami* is the big salt ocean.

   *Papa-nofo* probably is 'the rock (or rocks) that remained'
uncovered. The idea of the myth-maker here seems to be that the *sami*
at first had not depth of water enough to cover anything but the
*papa-sosolo*; but that ere long the waters would rise and reach the
other rocks also, and so make them happy (*amuia*, 'blessed,' used in
congratulations).

   <span id="notes_16"></span>[16](#text_16.md). *Fresh-water*, '*vai*;' as
in the 'Solo o le Va,' so here; the *vai* comes immediately after the
*tai*.

   *Your sea*. The word here is *tai*; *cf*. the note on *sami*.

   *Brought forth*; *produced*; *come forth*; in the text these are
always '*fanau*.'

   *Sky*; '*lagi*;' pronounced *langi* (i = Italian i). Everywhere, the
Samoan *g* = *ng*. A cognate word is the Melanesian *laga*, 'clear.'

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

   *Tui-te‘e-lagi*; *tui*, 'a high chief, a prince, a king;' *te‘e*, 'to
prop up;' *lagi*, 'the sky.' The Australian blacks also know that the
sky is propped up; once the props broke, and the wizards (*koráji*) had
the utmost difficulty in putting things right again.

   *Ilu*, &c.; these three, Ilu, Mamao, and Niuao do not come into
existence till after the sky is propped up: hence *mamao*, as I think,
must mean 'limited extension' or 'space' from horizon to horizon, from
sunrise to sunset; *niuao* is formed from *niu*, 'a cocoa-nut tree;' the
Samoans say of a very tall man that he 'a walking cocoa-nut tree;' of
smoke they say *fa‘a-niu tu*, 'it stands like a cocoa-nut tree;' and in
the Samoan Bible the missionaries have applied the expression to the
'pillar of fire' in the wilderness; and so, I think, that *niuao* must
mean 'height.' The Samoan word *ilu* means 'innumerable,' 100,000, or
any vast number; in its place in the text it cannot well refer to the
stars in the sky; we may translate it 'immensity,' and apply it to
distance from north to south. *Ilu*, *Mamao*, and *Niuao* would thus be
the three dimensions formed by the bounding sky—viz., Length, Breadth,
and Height, each of them, however, limited by the sky. *Cf*. the note on
*the Expanse*.

   <span id="notes_17"></span>[17](#text_17.md). *Lua‘o and Luavai*;
*lua-vai* means 'two fresh-waters;' *lua‘o* should, I think, be *luao*,
for *luā-ao*, 'two clouds.'

   *Sā-tua-lagi*; the 'race' at the 'back' of the 'sky;' the north.

   <span id="notes_18"></span>[18](#text_18.md). *Ngao-ngao-le-tai*. 'the
desolate sea.'

   '*Came*;' '*came forth*;' the text has still the same *toe fanau*,
'again was brought forth.'

   *Man*; 'tangata,' the human race. Last to be created was man, and the
elements which are joined together to make up his composite being. These
are—*anga-nga*, 'the spirit,' probably from the same root as *nga‘e*,
'to breathe hard;' hence the 'breath,' the 'spirit,' in the same sense
as the Heb. *ruāch*, Gr. *psuche*, Lat. *spiritus*, *animus*, Sans.
*âtman*; in Samoan *anga-nga* also means 'a disembodied spirit'—*loto*,
the 'heart or affections,' not the physical heart—*finagalo* 'the will,'
also the 'liver;' *finagalo* is a word used only to chiefs; *finagaloa*
means, 'to be angry,' 'choleric.' The next name, *masalo*, properly
means 'doubt,' but this appears to be a secondary meaning, for 'doubt'
arises from that power which enables the mind to cast things to and fro
in reflection, and hence to deliberate; *masalo* is therefore here taken
to be 'thought,' 'the power of thought.' These four Tangaloa causes to
go within man's physical frame, and combine there; and thus man becomes
'intelligent, wise,' See also Ovid, Meta i., 1.

   In Is. xlii., 5—the verse already quoted—the breath and the spirit
(*neshâmâh* and *ruāch*) are distinguished; the one is the animal spirit
or life; the other is the spirit which gives consciousness. Similarly,
the Melanesians and Polynesians believe that man has two spirits—the one
may leave him for a time when he is dreaming or in a faint; the other
finally leaves his body at death.

   <span id="notes_19"></span>[19](#text_19.md). *No fixture*; ua leai se
mea a mau ai, 'there was no thing to be fast to;' ope-opea, 'they
floated about.' *Cf*. "The earth was without form and void;" *cf*. also
Ovid, Meta, i., 1.

   <span id="notes_20"></span>[20](#text_20.md). *An ordinance*; 'tofiga.'
This word comes from the verb *tofi*, 'to divide an inheritance,' 'to
apportion a father's property among children.' Tangaloa's *tofiga* is
thus the exercise of his sovereign pleasure in allotting to his children
their several stations and spheres of action, as indicated in the five
paragraphs which follow.

   *Intelligent*, 'atamai.' As a verb this word means 'to understand;'
as an adjective, 'clever, intelligent, sensible;' as a noun, 'the mind.'
The Samoan *ata* denotes the incorporeal shadow or spirit, as opposed to
the substance of a thing; and *atamai* may be a derivative from it; so
also the French *esprit* and *spirituel* are related. The Sanskrit
*âtman* also means 'the breath, the soul, the undertanding,' <span
id="page_185">p. 185</span> and its derivative *âtmavant* means
'sensible,' 'self-controlled;' *âtman* is supposed to be derived from a
root *ava*, *vâ*; with which compare the Heb. hâvâ 'to breathe.'

   *Fatu-ma-le-‘ele‘ele*; 'seed-stone and earth.' *Fatu* is a word
which, in various forms, is found in all Malaysia, Melanesia, and
Polynesia, in the sense of 'hard,' 'anything hard,' 'the hard kernel or
seed-stone of fruit.' For the meaning of *le-‘ele‘ele*, see above; but
Le-‘Ele‘ele is here regarded as a woman, who, by the ordinance
(*tofiga*) of Tangaloa is united (*fa‘a-tasi*, 'joined,' *lit*.
'made-one') to Fatu, the completed man. Fatu is the seed-giving
principle, and Le ‘Ele‘ele is the receptacle of the seed. With this
compare the tales in classic authors about De-métér ('Mother-earth') and
Zeus.

   *A void*; 'va-nimo-nimo;' see note above. *To rest upon*; lit. 'to
reach to.' All this corresponds with the *Heb*. 'tohu' (chaos) of
creation—a waste in which nothing was defined.

   *Region*; itu, 'a side,' 'a district;' itu i matū, 'the north;' *cf*.
Heb. 'the sides of the north,' *yârekâthaim tzâphôn* (Isaiah xiv., 13)
where *tzâphôn* is the region of 'darkness' (*cf*. Homer, *pros zophon*,
Odys. ix., 25) 'the north quarter,' and *yârekâthaim* is a dual form to
mean 'both sides,' hence 'the buttocks,' 'the back,' 'the remotest parts
of a country.' This agrees with the idea conveyed by *tua-lagi* 'the
back of the sky,' to which Lua‘o and Luavai were appointed, to be
regents there. Fresh-water is 'vai.' In the 'Solo o le Va,' line 21, the
creation of *vai* and *tai* is mentioned. The Polynesians believed that
there were reservoirs of fresh-water up in the sky. In the Biblical
account of the great Flood, it is said that 'the windows of heaven were
opened.'

   *Le Fatu*: see note above. *Ordains*; 'tofia;' *cf*. *ordinance*,
'tofiga.'

   *Points*; tusi, 'to point out' with the index finger.

   *Masoa* and *Teve* are both referred to in the 'Solo o le Va,' lines
73, 75. The *Masoa* (*Tacca pinnatifida*) is the arrow-root tree;
growing on a succulent stem, with leaves only at the top, where they
spread out like the surface of a round table. The *Teve* (*Tacca
amorphophallus*) is another kind of arrow-root tree, very like the
*Masoa*. From their shape they are well fitted for the purpose to which
they are applied in these myths. See also Sir Geo. Grey's "Polynesian
Mythology."

   *There was nothing, &c.*; 'a na leai se mea e taunu‘u i ai le va‘ai.'

   Far-receding sky; 'va-nimo-nimo.' See notes above.

   <span id="notes_21"></span>[21](#text_21.md). *They brought forth*; the
text has 'ua fanau Ao, toe fanau Po;' another reading is, 'ua fanau Po
ma Ao, ua fa‘a-tagata-ina ai le lagi,' 'they brought forth Night and
Day, who caused-to-be-peopled the sky.' The order *Po ma Ao*, 'Night and
Day,' is more consonant with the ideas of the Polynesians who counted by
nights. The word *fa‘atagataina* consists of *fa‘a* the causative prefix
already noticed, and *tagata*, 'man,' 'mankind,' which in another
dialect is *kanaka*, now commonly applied to the 'labour-men' who are
brought from the islands of the South Seas to the northern parts of
Australia.

   *The eye of the sky*; 'le mata o le lagi.' The Malays call the Sun
*mata-ari*, 'the eye of the day.' The Egyptian City, On, (*Heb*.
‘Ir-ha-Heres, *Gr*. Heliopolis) 'the city of the Sun,' got its name from
Ain, Oin, 'the eye'—the emblem of the Sun.

   *The second heavens*. Here the Polynesians believe, like other
nations of old, that the sky originally lay flat on the earth, and
covered it; by the aid of the *Masoa* and the *Teve*, Tui-te‘e-lagi
props it up, and this gives room for Ilu and Mamao to work; this is the
First Heavens; in it are placed the Sun, and Night, and Day. Ilu and
Mamao then bear again, and the Sky ('le lagi'), according to myth, is
produced; this probably means the region above the clouds, for the
Polynesian myth-makers must have noticed the difference between
cloud-land and higher sky; this Tui propped up, and it was the Second
Heavens.

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

   *Remained there*—*i.e.*, in the Third Heavens, which they peopled.
The heavens above the Third are, in the myth, produced (*fanau*) by
Langi, the 'sky' personified, but they were all peopled by Ilu and
Mamao. The notion that the stars in the heavens are gods, and men, and
beasts, and trees, &c., is a very old one.

   <span id="notes_22"></span>[22](#text_22.md). *Tangaloa sat still*. In
the 'Solo o le Va,' he is represented as a quiet, contemplative god, who
delights in tranquillity and peace—the Polynesian Brahmā, the origin and
source of all things. In his active manifestations he is
*fa‘a-tutupu-nuu* (see [note on *par*. 13](#notes_13).md), 'the creator of
lands;' but in his dealings with men he works by intermediary emanations
from himself, which are all of them persons, and called Tangaloa; *le
fuli* is the 'immoveable' (*le* 'not,' *fuli*, 'to turn over,' 'to
capsize'); *asi-asi-nu‘u*, 'the omnipresent' (*asi*, 'to visit;'
*asi-asi*, a frequentative; *nu‘u*, 'a district, a country, a people');
*tolo-nu‘u*, 'the extender of lands, or peoples' (*tolo*, 'to spread
out;' it applies to reefs that run out into the sea, branches that
spread out from the tree, or roots running along on the surface of the
ground); *sāváli*, 'the ambassador or messenger' (*sāváli* means 'to
walk').

   *Tuli* and *Longonoa* both mean 'deaf' or 'deafness,' but that
meaning cannot apply to these workers of Tangaloa. In the 'Solo o le
Va,' *Tuli* is the bird 'ata' or emblem of Tangaloa; so also here, I
believe. As to Longonoa, the simple verb *logo*, means 'to report;'
hence I take Longonoa to be 'the reporter,' the one who carries tidings
up to Tangaloa; *logonoa* means 'to hear,' and *logo-logoā* is 'famous,
renowned.' Logonoa would thus be used as a verbal adjective; and in form
it corresponds with such verbs as *tala-noa* from *tala*. The Longo-noa
here may be the same as the Rongo of other islands.

   <span id="notes_24"></span>[24](#text_24.md). *They should go up*. The
context means that Savali, 'the messenger,' was sent down to summon a
*fono* or council of the gods whose stations had been appointed in the
various heavens below, and tell them that *they should go up* to the
Ninth Heavens to deliberate there. This was a council of chiefs, for
these gods are called *ali‘i*, 'chiefs.' The *fono* determined to send
Savali down with a message to Night and Day.

   <span id="notes_25"></span>[25](#text_25.md). *Langi-uli*, 'the dark,
cloudy heavens;' *Langi-mā*, 'the bright clear heavens,' called also
*Langi-lelei* (*lelei*, 'good, beautiful'). *Uli* means 'black,' 'dark
blue.'

   <span id="notes_26"></span>[26](#text_26.md). *Last injunction*;
mavaega, 'a parting command.'

   <span id="notes_27"></span>[27](#text_27.md). *Manu‘a* and *Samoa*. The
pride of the race comes in here; Manu‘a is the child of Night and Day,
and is the brother of the Sun and Moon. The ruler of the 'Celestial
Empire' even cannot claim a more ancient lineage than that!

   <span id="notes_28"></span>[28](#text_28.md). *Sa-tia-le-moa*. On this
fabulous account of the origin of the names Samoa and Manu‘a, Mr.
Powell's MSS. have this note:—This affair of the names is in a very
confused state. A man, Taua-nu‘u, who is 'keeper of the traditions' for
Taū, told me lately that Tangaloa fell from a precipice on to
Malae-a-Vavāu, and was badly wonnded, and from that circumstance Tau was
called Manu‘a tele, 'greatly wounded.' Several persons told Mr. Pratt
and myself, in 1862, that the whole group is named Sāmoa, from Moa, the
family name of the present King of Manu‘a—Sāmoa or Sā-moa-atoa. Fofo and
Taua-nu‘u still maintain that the account given to Mr. Pratt and myself
is perfectly correct, and that *le atu o Moa* ('the Moa group') includes
Samoa, Tahiti, &c., &c.

   *You two also*; *i.e.*, the father and the mother with their four
boys.

   *Malae-a-toto‘a*. It is a peaceful region, a land of rest and
tranquillity; it is the glassy empyrean, beyond the reach of storms.

   <span id="notes_30"></span>[30](#text_30.md). *Builders*; 'tūfūga.' see
the 'Solo o le Va.'

   *Bright house*. This paragraph seems to mean that the palace in the
Ninth Heavens was not their work, although they built in all the heavens
below. <span id="page_187">p. 187</span> *Fale-‘ula*<span
id="page_187_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_187_note_*.md) is the 'bright house';
*fale*, 'a house,' *‘ula*, 'red,' 'joyful,' 'bright'; hence the name
means 'house of joy,' or 'the house beautiful.'

   *Offspring of Fatu* and *‘Ele‘ele*. All the children of Earth are
placed under the command of these two chiefs, Manu‘a and Sāmoa.

   *Tail of the names*. Chiefs often have the name Tangaloa as the last
part of their own names.

   *Tui, &c.*, 'King of great Manu‘a and all Sāmoa.' Tui also means
'king,' 'high chief.'

   <span id="notes_32"></span>[32](#text_32.md). *Follow*. The sun and the
moon are not here the cause of day and night; they only follow them. The
day breaks, then comes the sun; darkness falls, and ere long the moon
rises.

   *Shades*; ata, 'shade,' 'emblem.' The 'ata' or 'spirit' of Tangaloa
resides in them, as in the Tuli; see [note on *par*. 22](#notes_22.md).

   *Portion of the heavens*; itu, 'side,' see [notes on *par*.
20](#notes_20.md). The moon and the stars always pass along the sky in the
same direction.

   <span id="notes_33"></span>[33](#text_33.md). *Went to and fro*;
'fe-alu-alu-mai'; *cf*. [notes on *par*. 13](#notes_13.md). *To visit the
lands*; 'asi-asi i nu‘u.' Here Savali performs the functions *Tangaloa
asi-asi nu‘u*, another manifestation of the supreme god; in visiting
these lands he assumed the form of the Tuli; *cf*. the 'Solo o le Va.'

   *The Eastern groups*; that is, Tahiti and the adjacent islands.

   *The space between*; 'vasa,' that is, the ocean-space between two
islands.

   *Walk it*; 'savali,' in allusion to his name.

   *Turned his face*; fa‘asaga, 'to direct to,' 'to face to.'

   *The Tongan group*; which is placed as a steppings-stone between the
Eastern group and Fiji. *That land*; 'lau-‘ele‘ele'; see [note on *par*.
13](#notes_13.md).

   <span id="notes_34"></span>[34](#text_34.md). *This Manu‘a*; the land of
the poet's birth.

   *Move about*; 'fe-alu-mai,'—not the frequentative form this time. The
meaning is that Manu‘a was too small an island, and so the land
('lau-‘ele‘ele') of Savai‘i was created. Therefore in poetry, these two
islands are regarded as proceeding from the same act of creation.

   <span id="notes_35"></span>[35](#text_35.md). *Got countries*; nu‘u,
'lands.' Tangaloa, the supreme god, now goes down to examine the lands
just created. *Cf*. "And behold every thing that he had made was very
good." *Delighted in them*, 'fia-fia,' intensive; *said*, 'fetala‘i,' a
chief's word.

   *Black cloud*; 'ao-uli-uli'; this is not a rain-cloud; in the book of
Isaiah (c. iv., 5), the day-cloud, which is a manifestation of Jehovah's
presence, a cloud of smoke (*’anân v’âshân*); *cf*. also 1 Kings, viii.,
10.

   *Trample upon*;<span
id="page_187_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_187_note_dagger.md) 'soli-soli,'
reduplication. As man is now about to come on the scene, the supreme god
prepares the land for him to dwell in and to cultivate.

   *People to possess*; *lit*., 'people to people,' tagata e
fa‘a-tagata.

   *Atu-sasae*; 'atu' means 'group,' and 'sasae' means 'eastern.' Atu,
Sasae, Fiji, Tonga, are all personified here and become mythical
personages. Here, as elsewhere, Fiji, although Melanesian, is included
in the realms of Tangaloa, the Eastern God.

   <span id="notes_38"></span>[38](#text_38.md). *Valu‘a* and *Ti‘apa*;
these heroes are celebrated in another *Solo*.

   *I‘i* and *Sava*; a myth to account for the name Savai‘i. Mr.
Powell's notes add:—"Such is the account given me by Taua-nu‘u of
Manu‘a, the legend-keeper <span id="page_188">p. 188</span> (Oct. 21,
1870). He also stated that Fatu and ‘Ele‘ele were the first pair who
came from heaven; they came down at a place called Malae-a-Vavau, near
the east end of the village of Taū; they gave birth to a boy and a girl
named Ti‘apa and Valu‘a who went and peopled Savai‘i; for they became
the parents of a girl named I‘i and a boy Sava; hence the name Savai‘i."

   *This side of the world*; 'lenei itu lalolagi.'

   <span id="notes_39"></span>[39](#text_39.md). *As if he were making a
prayer*; 'peiseai se talo-talo ua fai'; *talo-talo* is an intensive
reduplication of the verb *tatalo*, 'to pray'; *talo-saga* is 'a
prayer'; *talo* means 'to make signs to,' 'to beckon'; hence 'to stretch
out the hands in prayer.'

   *Land of Upolu*; *Tutuila*; 'land' here is lau-‘ele‘ele, *not* n‘u.

   *To rest*; malolo, 'to be quiescent,' 'to rest,' *not* 'to rest from
work'; *lands*, nu‘u.

   <span id="notes_40"></span>[40](#text_40.md). *The Peopling Vine*; le
Fue-tagata; *cf*. the 'Solo o le Va,' (note 16). Evidently this vine has
some connection with the Sun.

   *A council ground*; that is, a *malae*.

   *Was walking*; eva-eva, *not* fe-alu-alu-mai; eva means 'to walk by
moonlight,' 'to walk or go about leisurely.' His work was done, and so
he could now take a stroll for recreation.

   *Shred them*; 'totosi;' tosi means 'to tear in strips,' though not so
as to separate; 'to draw out,' 'to form.'

   *Four persons*; a myth to account for the names Upolu tele and
Tutuila

   *Fue-sā*, 'the sacred climbing-vine.' Here called also
*Fue-tagata*—an additional particular, not mentioned in the 'Solo o le
Va.'

   *Flat lands*; lau-‘ele‘ele. *Parting command*; 'mavaega.'

   <span id="notes_42"></span>[42](#text_42.md). *Show respect to*; 'le
sopoia;' *lit*. 'do not pass over.'

   *Do as he likes*; pule, 'have authority and full control.'

   <span id="notes_43"></span>[43](#text_43.md). As is usual, the poet, at
the close of his tale, enforces the claim of Manua, to have glory and
honour.

ADDENDUM.

   The Mexican story of Creation may be compared with the Polynesian
'tala;' I therefore quote a few points of resemblance from a French
translation of the "Codex Ramirez," which was written in Spanish soon
after the conquest of Mexico: "The first god and the first goddess were
self-created, and dwelt in the Third Heavens; of their four sons, one
was born red, another was born black.<span
id="page_188_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_188_note_*.md) Two of these sons, by
appointment, proceeded to create first fire, then a half-sun, then a man
and a woman, then the days, then a great fish<span
id="page_188_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_188_note_*.md) like a cayman, out of
which they made the earth. As yet there was no division of time into
years; so the creating gods now made a full sun to shine on the earth.
Then great giants were made, who lived only on acorns, and could carry
trees in their hands. Soon after it rained<span
id="page_188_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_188_note_*.md) so much that the sky
fell down upon the earth. The gods then created four men to help them to
raise the sky again, and two of the gods changed themselves into
trees<span id="page_188_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_188_note_*.md) for the same
end. The Sun now resumed his place in the sky, and, in order that he
might have hearts to feed on,<span
id="page_188_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_188_note_*.md) and blood to drink, men
were compelled to engage in perpetual war. One year after this one of
the four gods took a rod, <span id="page_189">p. 189</span> and with it
struck a rock, from which sprang the 'mountaineers,' who occupied the
country before the Mexicans came there."

   In the introduction to this 'tala,' I have offered a new derivation
of the name Tangaloa. I wish now to add that that derivation has some
support from what we know as the Vedic god Varuna—the same word as the
Greek *ouranos*, 'heaven.' The name Varuna is derived from the Sanskrit
verb *veri*, 'to cover,' 'to surround;' and, in its compounds, 'to
enclose,' 'to overspread;' a participial noun from it means 'a wrapper,'
'a cloak;' with these compare the Polynesian words already cited. In the
Veda Varuna is one of the most ancient of deities; he is sprung from
'Space,' and is the god of the heavens; in some of the later hymns he is
regarded as controlling the waters, both in heaven and on earth; hence
in the later mythologgy his name is synonymous with 'the waters,' 'the
ocean.' For, just as the Vedic Varuna covers and encompasses the
terrestrial sphere, so the Homeric mighty river Okeanos surrounds the
whole of the terrestrial lands. With all this compare the functions of
Tangaloa, who, in some localities in Polynesia, is also lord of the sea.

   In the Greek mythology, Ouranos is the grandfather of Zeus, and
Varuna is thus more venerable and ancient than Dyaus, the lower sky.

<span id="page_176_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_176_fr_*.md) Compare with this
the story of Kahu's discovery of the Chatham Islands: "On the arrival of
the Kahu at this island (Chatham Island) he found it floating about; it
was Kahu who closed (fixed) all this island, including Pitt Island."
There are other Polynesian myths of the same character.—E<span

<span id="page_176_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_176_fr_dagger.md) N<span
class="small">OTE</span>.—Mr. Powell's manuscript, under date March 21,
1871, has this note:—"To-day Taua-nu‘u has explained to me the reason of
his reluctance to disclose his traditions; he is afraid lest contention
arise, when it is found that they place Savai‘i and Upólu in a position
inferior to his own islands of Manu‘a. When I promised due care, he
opened his treasures more fully. He states that (1) ‘Ele-‘ele is
distinct from Fatu-ma-le-‘Ele-‘ele; that was the name given to the first
man, who was only at first floating about on the waters with ‘Ele-‘ele.
Fatu-ma-le-‘Ele-‘ele was formed by the union of Spirit, Heart, Will, and
Thought, and was appointed to people the lands in conjunction with
‘Ele-‘ele 'Earth,' but Le-‘Ele-‘ele was different, and Fatu was
different from ‘Ele-‘ele.

<span id="page_187_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_187_fr_*.md) *Fale-‘ula*, is
the Whare-kura of Maori tradition, which is described as a temple, or
use set apart and strictly *tapu*, where the priests taught the ancient
histories and traditions of the people; it is sometimes called
Whare-maire.—E<span class="small">DITORS</span>.

<span id="page_187_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_187_fr_dagger.md) Compare
with this, the preparations made by Maui, who in most of the myths
referring to his "fishing up" of lands is described as trampling on the
hills to prepare the earth the habitation of man. Had he not been
overtaken by daylight this would have been accomplished and the earth
have presented a level surface.—E<span class="small">DITORS</span>.
