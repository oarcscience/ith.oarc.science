# PART I

### Social and Historical Background

## CHAPTER ONE

#### The Prose Note

THE Hawaiian Kumulipo is a genealogical prayer chant linking the royal
family to which it belonged not only to primary gods belonging to the
whole people and worshiped in common with allied Polynesian groups, not
only to deified chiefs born into the living world, the Ao, within the
family line, but to the stars in the heavens and the plants and animals
useful to life on earth, who must also be named within the chain of
birth and their representatives in the spirit world thus be brought into
the service of their children who live to carry on the line in the world
of mankind. To understand such a family chant, it is necessary to know
what we can of its social and political background, how it came to be
composed, the part it played in the ceremonial life of a chief's
household, its importance as a perquisite of rank.

Some of these questions are answered on the title-pages of the published
text and the queen's translation, others in the prose note affixed to
the Kalakaua text, amplified from the original Hawaiian manuscript by
the insertion of a paragraph, the third, explaining more fully the
family connection of the child to whom the chant is said to have been
dedicated. "A prayer of dedication of a chief, A *Kumulipo* for
Ka-'I-amamao and (passed on by him) to Alapai'i-wahine (woman)," reads
the title-page of the Kalakaua text. Queen Liliuokalani is more
specific. "An ancient prayer for the dedication of the high chief
Lono-i-ka-makahiki to the gods soon after his birth," she writes, a
discrepancy in name explained in the note itself, and she adds the date
1700 for the time of its composition

{p. 8}

and the name of Keaulumoku as its composer. The prose note as translated
under the direction of Mrs. Mary Pukui and checked with the queen's
rendering of certain passages reads as follows:

Hewahewa and Ahukai were the persons who recited this chant to
Alapa'i-wahine at Koko on Oahu. Ke'eaumoku was lying on his deathbed.
The Lono-i-ka-makahiki mentioned in the chant was Ka-'I-'i-mamao.
Lono-i-ka-makahiki was the name given to him by his mother at his birth.
She was Lono-ma-'I-kanaka. It was Keakealaniwahine \[his paternal
grandmother\] who gave him his new name at the time when he was
consecrated and given the Taboo, the Burning, the Fearful, the
Prostrating Taboo, at the time when his naval cord was cut at the heiau
of Kueku at Kahalu'u in Kona, Hawaii. Ka-'I-'i-mamao was the correct
name. That was the true name Keakea gave the child, but the composers of
the chant "Kekoauliko'okea ka Lani" called him by the name of
Ka-lani-nui-'I-'i-mamao. The "Lani-nui" was just inserted by the
composers; Ka-'I-'i-mamao was the correct form. The meaning of the word
\[*mamao*\] is this. When Keawe lived with Lono-ma-'I-kanaka, a new
strain was introduced into the family of 'I the father of Ahu and
grandfather of Lono-ma-'I-kanaka; as if to say that this 'I was greater
than all the other 'Is. This was the meaning of the word "mamao" \["far
off," hence "removed," that is, high in rank\] added to the first half
of the name.

Before his banishment by the commoners of Ka-u for his evil deeds,
\[because of\] his sleeping with his own daughter, with Kaolaniali'i, he
was called by the name of "Wakea." It was under this name that he went
with his kahu, Kapa'ihi-a-Hilina, to Kauai, to Kalihi-by-the-sea and
Kalihi-by-the-streams, and to Hanalei, and he went to the bush country
of Kahihikolo and became demented and wandered about in the uplands.

This was not the Lono-i-ka-makahiki who riddled with Kakuhihewa. A
number of different chiefs were called Lono-i-ka-makahiki and they lived
at different times. There were three Lono-i-ka-makahiki's. The first
Lono-i-ka-makahiki was the son of Keawe-nui-a 'Umi; another was
Lono-i-ka-makahiki the humpbacked. His time came later. He was the son
of Kapulehuwaihele by Makakauali'i. The Lono-i-ka-makahiki whose prayer
this was, that Lono-i-ka-makahiki was the son of
Keawe-i-kekahi-ali'i-o-ka-moku by Lono-ma-'I-kanaka. That was the
Ka-'I-'i-mamao here mentioned,

{p. 9}

the father of Ka-lai-opu'u and the grandparent fifth removed of the King
Kalakaua now on the throne and grandparent fifth and fourth removed of
Ka-pi'o-lani the present Queen Consort.

This chant of Kumulipo is the chant recited by Pu'ou to Lono (Captain
Cook) as he stood while a sacrifice of pork was offered to him at the
heiau of Hikiau at Kealakekua.

The priest had said at the time of Ka-'I-'i-mamao's death that Lono
would come again, that is, Ka-'I-'i-mamao, and would return by sea on
the canoes 'Auwa'alalua.

That was why Captain Cook was called Lono.

Besides explaining the dedication of the chant under two different
names, the prose note seems to connect it with the consecration of
Keawe's son in the temple at the time of his birth, as well as with two
other occasions at which its recitation is definitely stated. The first
of these recitations was at the ceremony in the temple for Captain Cook
when he was received as the god Lono; the second was at the time of
Ke'eaumoku's death. The sacred character of the chant is thus clearly
established. In two instances it was apparently connected with a
religious ceremony within a heiau. In the two instances in which the
reciters are named they are priests and two in number, since a chant of
such importance could not be intrusted to the memory of a single
individual and the technical effort involved must have been of an
exacting nature. The reciters seem also to have been priests of rank. Of
Hewahewa who chanted as Ke'eaumoku lay dying, we are told that he
claimed lineal descent from the priest Paao whom tradition claimed to
have migrated to Hawaii before intercourse with southern groups had
ceased and to have introduced reforms on that island at a time of decay
of the chiefship. After the death of Kamehameha, who had striven to
retain ancient religious practices, and the acceptance by the chiefs of
Christianity, Hewahewa himself is said to have been active in
demolishing the images that embellished the old temple structures.

The death of Ke'eaumoku, dated 1804 by Hawaiian chronology, like that of
Captain Cook's landing on Hawaii in

{p. 10}

1779, falls well within known history. Ke'eaumoku was uncle and
supporter of Kamehameha and father of his favorite wife. The lady
Alapa'i the queen identifies with the child of Ka-'I-'i-mamao by his own
daughter, "a woman chief of the highest rank then at Koko, Oahu." The
alliance had earned for the chief the joking sobriquet of "Wakea" in
allusion to the myth that the original ancestor of the race was child of
the Sky-god Wakea by the daughter born to him by the Earth-mother Papa,
but this does not appear to have been one of the "evil deeds" for which
the chief was banished, such unions seeming to have been accepted among
persons of rank. A younger woman of the same name, granddaughter by his
daughter Kauwa'a of that Alapa'i who was at one time ruling chief of the
island of Hawaii, married John Young the younger, later premier under
Kamahameha III. It may have been a last honor paid to her dying relative
by the chiefess to whom it already belonged, or the younger
Alapa'i-wahine may have been the final inheritor, to whom the family
chant was at this time dedicated, or "named," as the Hawaiians say. To
understand what such a chant contributed to the prestige of a family of
rank, it will be necessary to know something of the terms upon which a
ruling chief held his title to control over land rights and ultimately
over the lives and activities of his followers.
