# CHAPTER FIFTEEN

#### The Nibblers

THE sixth chant describes in a mood of whimsical humor the depredations
of the rat tribe upon the vegetable food crop celebrated in the last
chant. Although rat shooting with bow and arrow was a favorite pastime
of chiefs and comparison to a rat an unlucky sign in word magic, the rat
family were nevertheless in line of descent from gods of the Po and
might appear on earth in offspring endowed with spirit power. Stories
make the rat form to be a stage in the reshaping into human bodies of
those returned to life from the spirit world, a belief not inconsistent
with Hindoo religious philosophy. A Kauai conqueror has a brother born
in the form of a rat. Priests catch and work over the spirit body of a
dead child until he comes to life in a ratlike body. The exploits of the
rat child Piko'i recall the tall tales of our own storytellers.\[1\] On
the other hand, a native kahuna recently condemned a new-built house to
vacancy by calling the shape devised for the doorway a "rat's nest," and
the ancient priest Paao again and again refuses fish caught for
sacrifice on the basis of the same ominous analogy.\[2\]

Today the native rat, *Rattus hawaiiensis*, no longer lives save on
small islets cut off from the main land. His relatives from foreign
lands have taken over the wider ranges. But in old days time was
reckoned by the migration of rats to the shore when wild food plants
failed in the uplands, thus "telling the seasons" to the lowland planter
by the depredations

\[1. Beckwith, *Hawaiian Mythology*; pp. 424-27, 411, 480.

2\. Malo, p. 333.\]

{p. 86}

upon his crop; "nothing in the plains is safe from the rats, everything
is burrowed out by them," complains Kepelino.\[3\]

The relation of the first four lines of the chant serving as a prologue
to what follows is highly debatable. Kua-ka-mano,
"Chief-over-thousands," is reputed to be "a great chief of old" and
Kupu-kapu, "Taboo-sprout," to be similarly the name of the splendid
feather-bound staff or brush, called *kahili*, carried before him as a
sign of rank. All chiefs in old times had such symbols of office, and
each had its distinguishing name of honor. Possibly there is meant here
a sly analogy between the quivering whiskers preceding the approach of a
rat and the stiff feather frill (*kuku*) proclaiming that of the equally
predatory taboo chief.

But Kupihea is probably right in interpreting the spread of the rat
family from upland to shore and their nibbling habits as symbolic of the
rise of new lines of chiefs under whom taboos multiplied. Especially it
refers perhaps to the dividing up of the land to landlords and these
again to subordinate overseers, each taking toll from the crop of the
next lower and all expected to contribute to the head chief, the haku or
"lord," to whom all land was handed down by inheritance from his
predecessor.' This idea as the kaona or theme of the chant I have tried
to bring out in following, generally, Kupihea's translation. The trouble
lies in the interplay of rhetorical devices such as linked rhymes, so
that sound obscures sense. I infer that the multiplication of overseers
went hand in hand with the development of cultivation of the soil for
food crops, perhaps primarily with the introduction of wet taro culture
as described in the chant of the rooting pig. The word *hili* means "to
deviate from the path," hence, according to Parker, "from a settled line
of conduct," and may well apply to social innovations. The word
*mahimahi* looks like a reduplication of the word *mahi*,

\[3. Kepelino, pp. 86, 87.

4\. Ibid., pp. 146-51.\]

{p. 87}

"to dig." *Linalina* is a word applied to wet clayey soil, *holi ana*
means "sprouting," the whole couplet thus agreeing with the idea of
preparation of abundance of vegetable food (*'ai*) with which the line
concludes. But the "diggers" and "scratchers" may be the rats
themselves.

Certainly the rodent family is on the surface the direct subject of the
remainder of the chant, with an eye probably to its analogue within the
social structure. Such lines as

There in hollow places the parents dwell  
There huddle together the little rats,

to quote the queen's rendering, are distinctly so directed. The "lashes
(whiskers?) upstanding," the "trace of the nibbling of these reddish
ones," the "mark left upon the rind" of the so-called "mountain apple"
or *'ohi'a* from a tree whose upland variety bears no fruit, all these
passages bring the rat tribe itself clearly before the eye. The name
Po-hiolo for the male parent may be a play upon Poho-'iole, "Rat-hole,"
and Po-ne'e-aku, for the female, upon the hitching motion, *ne'ene'e*,
of the rat as it turns now this way, now that; a word applied also to
the position in which the common people were obliged to approach the
chiefs, crawling on hands and knees. Possibly the whole is also a play
upon a child's pilfering habits as it begins to creep about, as Pokini
would interpret it.

Many new fines of chiefs spring up  
540. Cultivation arises, full of taboos  
\[They go about scratching at the wet lands  
It sprouts, the first blades appear, the food is ready\] \[?\]  
Food grown by the water courses  
Food grown by the sea  
545. Plentiful and heaped up  
The parent rats dwell in holes  
The little rats huddle together  
Those who mark the seasons  
Little tolls from the land

550\. Little tolls from the water courses  
Trace of the nibblings of these brown-coated ones  
With whiskers upstanding  
They hide here and there  
A rat in the upland, a rat by the sea  
555. A rat running beside the wave  
Born to the two, child of the Night-falling-away  
Born to the two, child of the Night-creeping-away  
The little child creeps as it moves  
The little child moves with a spring  
560. Pilfering at the rind  
Rind of the 'ohi'a fruit, not a fruit of the upland  
A tiny child born as the darkness falls away  
A springing child born as the darkness creeps away  
Child of the dark and child in the night now here  
565.    Still it is night
