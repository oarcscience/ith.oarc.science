# CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

#### Maui the Usurper

THE name song of Maui at the close of the fifteenth section of the
Kumulipo chant tells the story of the struggle for power of a younger
son born into the family through an alien alliance, one entitling him to
a higher-ranking status than the natural heir. Maui is born to a god, as
the phrase goes. His mother is Hina-of-the-fire, his grand parent
Mahui'e is known throughout Polynesia as keeper of underground fire. His
mother sends him back to her own (or his father's) family for a wife,
and his posterity replace the old stock on the line of ruling chiefs who
carry on the family descent.

Stories of the Maui brothers are by no means local to Hawaii alone, but
the name Maui-of-the-loincloth for the trickster hero is used, so far as
I know, only here and in New Zealand; Maui-tikitiki, -ti'iti'i, or
-ki'iki'i he is commonly called. A story to justify the sobriquet is
told in both areas. In the Hawaiian version told at the east end of the
island of Maui, Hina, walking on the beach, picks up a man's loincloth
and, girding herself with it, lies down to sleep. She conceives a child,
and her husband, far from taking the affair badly as in the Wakea chant,
recognizes the offspring of a god and rejoices to have "found our
lord."' One recognizes here a euphemized variant of the subterfuge used
by Tiki to gain access to his daughter by the sand woman as told in the
Stimson manuscript from the Tuamotus. In the New Zealand account from
Nga-i-tahu

\[1. Beckwith, *Hawaiian Mythology*, p. 229.\]

{p. 129}

sources Hine bears an abortion and wrapping it in her bloody "apron"
(*maro*) casts it into the sea, or among brambles in one version, whence
it is rescued by ancestral deities and shaped into a human being.\[2\]
So in the Hawaiian chant of the "Birth of Islands"--

The afterbirth of the child was thrown away  
Into the rolling sea,  
The froth of the heaving sea  
Was found as a loincloth for the child,  
Molokini the island,  
This was an afterbirth.\[3\]

In New Zealand Maui makes himself known to his family in human form. In
the Kumulipo he is born in feathered form as a *moa*, generally
translated "cock." He makes a cry not like a human being but "like an
animal" as the word *Alala* is defined. In the South Pacific the
trickster Maui shifts to the form of a pigeon, a *rupe*. It is in this
form that in New Zealand he visits his ancestors in the underworld. Rupe
in pigeon shape flies to the rescue of his sister in the Hine-Tinirau
tale. In Mangareva, Toa Rupe, daughter of Te Rupe, is mother of the Maui
brothers. Obviously the Hawaiian moa should be a pigeon, but, since the
pigeon was not known to Hawaiians, the composer uses the fighting cock
as feathered symbol of the part the newborn infant is to play in the
world.\[4\] He is to be an *aiwaiwa* child, a word denoting excellence
as an expert but also used in a derogatory sense as we use the word
"notorious." Such double intention in an epithet seems to us like a
contradiction of terms, but to the Polynesian it agrees with the
opposition he observes inherent in human judgments. The character Maui
plays in story cycles throughout the South Seas shifts like his shape.
Some make him a bungler, vainglorious and revengeful;

\[2. White, II, 63, 65, 71, 79.

3\. Fornander, *Collection* ("Memoirs," No. 4), pp. 4, 5; cf. Henry, p.
408.

310.\]

{p. 130}

others, a benevolent culture bringer, using his gifts of magic for the
good of man.

Maui's exploits or *ua* in his struggle for power are listed by number.
So White enumerates the "acts" of Maui under the term *patunga*.\[5\]
The first contest is against his own kindred, those who seem to be
guarding Hina's virginity. The word *ana* probably refers to the cave
dwelling of Hina familiar to Maui stories; one such is still pointed out
on the mountainside back of Waianae village on Oahu. The next five
contests are directed toward the establishment of his claim to the
privileges of high chief rank. Kava drink made of the black-stemmed
variety is sacred to the "gods." The "bamboo" may be the knife used for
the rite of incision, perhaps similarly limited to the chief class. The
*paehumu*, if the corrected text is accepted, is the inclosure within
the heiau set apart for images, to the right of which stood the prayer
scaffold or *anu'u*. From both places all were excluded save those of
high rank.

The struggle for the privileges of rank turns Maui's attention to the
question of his parentage. His mother is evasive and puts him off with
the story of the loincloth. Immediately after, she sends him to his
"father" after "line and hook." Perhaps this is a parent on his mother's
side. At all events the land-fishing expedition upon which she sends him
is to be interpreted, not as so literally exploited in folk tale but as
symbolizing a wooing expedition to win a wife by whom he may unite in
their child the blood of close kin born in lands distant geographically
but drawn together by this bond of family union. A fairy wife who sends
her favorite son to seek a wife among her own kin in a land of deities
is a popular theme in Hawaiian as well as South Sea family story cycles.

The seventh adventure in seizing the sister of Hina in the shape of a
mudhen is the first step in this wooing. The folk

\[5. White, I, 72-73 (text), 79-80.\]

{p. 131}

tale telling how Maui learned from the red-headed mudhens the secret of
fire-making by the use of fire sticks is conspicuously absent from the
enumeration here of Maui's exploits. The reason is obvious; it is not
fire-making but the secret of sex that Maui learns in preparation for
"drawing the islands together" by a propitious marriage. The fishhook
Manai-a-ka-lani is equally a sex symbol. The word *manai* is used for a
sharp needle-like instrument used in stringing flowers for
wreath-making, and in wooing stories the maiden courted is traditionally
given a flower name.

The obscure treatment of the courting story is a good illustration of
poetic courtly style. Seeking a wife among his close kin, he probably
comes incognito and meets opposition in the form of the parent, who
probably does not recognize him, and only after defeating this obstacle
does he win the girl already destined to become his wife by arrangement
among their common parents. The struggle with the sea monster here
represents the obstructions put in his way, sometimes by the girl
herself as the theme is developed in popular romance. The whole courting
episode is here treated with lively humor. The phrase "to live through
the tail" (*Ola ... ma ka pewa* or *ma ka hi'u*) is used when a slim
chance of escape offers itself in a dangerous predicament. Every
Hawaiian knows the story of how, during the great shark war, when the
shark Mikololou was dragged ashore and eaten "all but his tail," or his
"tongue" in some versions, a dog seized the remnant and leaped with it
into the sea, whereupon the shark, feeling itself in its native element,
resumed its full form. "Mikololou died but lived again through his
tongue" is similarly said of one who talks himself out of a dangerous
situation.\[6\]

Maui eventually wins the lady Mahana-ulu-'ehu for whom "love grew." Her
name is paired with his on the

\[6. Pukui, *Ke Awa Lau o Pu'uloa*, pp. 58-59; Beckwith, *Hawaiian
Mythology* p. 139.\]

{p. 132}

genealogy of the Kamokuiki book equivalent to that of the sixteenth
section of the Kumulipo chant, where Hina-ke-aloha-ila is named as wife
of Maui. The two names must hence be pseudonyms for the same lady. Maui
has now concluded his ninth adventure, and from this point the numbering
becomes confused. The scratching-out of the eyes of the eight-eyed
Pe'ape'a who has abducted his mother is declared to be his "last
exploit." But there follows the sun-snaring, introduced by the line
"With Moemoe the strife ended." The story is probably merely another
version of the abduction incident, so well known through popular
retelling as to be scarcely worth repeating. "Everybody knows" is
Ho'olapa's happy rendering of the Hawaiian phrasing. As I heard it many
years ago on the island of Maui, the fight with Moemoe came as the final
episode of the sun-snaring. We were riding from Lahaina toward Kahakaloa
Point, where one strikes the trades across East Maui, and came upon a
huge pillar-like block of stone fallen toward the sea. This was the
"great black rock of Kaanapali" marking the prostrate form of the
overthrown shape shifter who had taunted Maui, some say attempted to
stay him, when he set out from Lahaina to do battle with the Sun. Maui
promised to deal with him on his return, and, with the silencing of the
reviler, Maui's labors ceased.

The whole treatment of this name chant is an excellent example of the
song-master's art; whether it was in its present form originally a part
of the prayer chant it would be difficult to say. The lovemaking is
developed as a comic relief to the drama of strife against the gods,
which is the main theme of Maui's lawless career. Four times their names
occur as a refrain, first when Maui seizes the "bunch of black-stemmed
kava," again with the strife over the "bamboo" of Kane and Kanaloa. With
the hooking of the great fish the two gods are "shaken from their
foundation." Finally, Maui drinks the "yellow water" of Kane and
Kanaloa,  
{p. 133}

an adventure sometimes referred to as a quarrel over the right of
participation in a kava-drinking ritual. The closing lines reciting the
parentage, place of birth, and places of burial sacred to the memory of
a family hero are in the true laconic style of the name song or *inoa*.
At the close is summed up the essential character of the Maui figure in
the terms *ho'upu'upu* and *ho'okala*, the last word more precisely
rendered by "lawless" than by the more generally used "mischievous." In
the final play upon the word *moku* there seems to be, as pointed out by
Ho'olapa, a double application, on the one hand to the land itself, on
the other to the lawless chief who overran it, "a chief indeed."

The Maui cycle as judged from its comparative uniformity of detail, in
spite of individual variations over a wide geographical spread, must
have developed in approximately its present essential form before or
during the migration period. The various forms the story took throughout
the Pacific are fully treated in Dr. Katherine Luomala's recent study of
"Maui-of-a-thousand-tricks." I may be pardoned a digression here to
bring out some of the modern folk tale variants told in the Hawaiian
group that may cast light upon the Kumulipo rendering.

Fornander's version of Kaulu, who sacks the land of Kane and Kanaloa by
means of superior magic and trickery, is an obvious retelling of the
Maui story. Kaulu is "son of Kalana," youngest born of the family and
"born in the shape of a rope," obviously an umbilical cord and probably
that of the favorite brother, to rescue whom he seeks the land of Kane
and Kanaloa, where his brother has been carried away to serve the gods.
There he upsets the order of the gods, sharing their kava cup by a ruse,
wrecking their vegetable garden, turning the land upside down, even
carrying away "the rays of the sun" in his search for his brother, and
finally tearing apart the jaws of the great shark in whose body the
brother has been hidden. This "shark" must be the same

{p. 134}

as Maui's "fish" whose drawing ashore shook Kane and Kanaloa from their
foundation. It appears in Tahiti as "the handsome blue shark of Ta'aroa"
snatched up by the gods from those who would have destroyed it and
placed in the Milky Way, the stream of the water of life (*vai ola*) in
which the gods bathe to renew their youth, where it may be seen today as
a dark patch against the bright belt of light whose diurnal pivoting as
the earth revolves is spoken of in Hawaii as the "turning of the
fish.\[7\]

Maui's fishing feat has its modern version in a tale of
Red-Ku-of-the-sea told me not many years ago by the sheriff of Hana
district, who pointed out on the beach an eel's head turned to stone
with jaws apart, together with other material evidence of the factual
character of the story.\[8\] The hero used, of course, the fishhook
Manai-a-ka-lani, and the device my informant described for drawing the
monster to land by means of ropes attached to the hook and pulling at an
angle from two points on the beach must have been also Maui's procedure.
Such a device was used in handling one of the huge kites of ancient days
and I am told is employed today by fishermen off Lahaina to get a squid
to shore too big to handle otherwise. The point of meeting at which the
ropes are attached is called *hanai*, a word Ho'olapa seemed to connect
with the *manai* of Maui's hook. Rays of the afternoon sun glancing to
the sea in the phenomenon we call "the sun drinking water" are known as
"Maui's lassos" or "snaring ropes," with reference to the sun-snaring
adventure. I think it likely that the fishing-up of islands, the hooking
and drawing to shore of a sea monster, and the modern version of the
sun-snaring myth are all variants from an older legend. Perhaps the myth
of drawing the sun from its underworld hole in order to lighten a
darkened world, told in Hawaii of the famous demigod Kana, was

\[7. Beckwith, *Hawaiian Mythology*, pp. 436-41; Henry, pp. 369, 403,
404.

8\. Beckwith, *Hawaiian Mythology*, pp. 20-22.\]

{p. 135}

the original and more elemental adventure upon which have been imposed
such embellishments as the search after fire, the freeing of abducted
ladies, the fishing after troublesome sea monsters; or perhaps, on the
other hand, the cosmic ad ventures have developed with a growing taste
for symbolism out of a particular incident of human abduction.
