# APPENDIX II

### Textual Notes

Since Hawaiians were not precise in the use of such technical elements
as punctuation and capitalization, I have referred their use to each
particular case without strictly following the printed text. The small
initial *k* in the manuscript, moreover, is often indistinguishable from
the capital. Lists of names, even those of plants and animals, I have
regularly capitalized for emphasis. The difficult question of the
compounds with *po* I have met by referring each to its probable meaning
as a personified generative agent or as a time element and have
capitalized or not accordingly. Punctuation within the line,
occasionally noted in the text, has depended upon the meaning of the
passage. Since in Hawaiian chants each line is, in general, complete in
itself, I follow the usage of the text in omitting altogether end stops.

The insertion of the apostrophe or *hamsa* to indicate the catch in the
voice, by no means lost in Hawaiian speech, where an original voiced
glottal or nasal has become soundless, remained unmarked by the
missionaries who reduced the language to written form and was indicated,
and that unevenly and only when occurring within the word, by Parker's
1922 revision of Andrew's dictionary of 1865 Yet it is of first
importance in distinguishing two unrelated words otherwise spelled alike
but derived from different roots and carrying different meanings. No
Hawaiian today can be an infallible guide for the exact voicing of a
chant no longer to be heard in oral recitation. I have, however,
depended upon native authority, especially upon Mrs. Mary Pukui, for
correction of this omission, with occasional help from Dr. Buck and Dr.
Emory, and with generous assistance in verification by Dr. Elbert,
philologist in charge, with Mrs. Pukui and Dr. Emory, of a new revision
of the Hawaiian dictionary.

Corrections from the Kalakaua text have, on the whole, been
inconsiderable, and variations in this text from the manuscript seldom
occur. Certain passages, such as the star names and the Maui

{p. 242}

name song, are, however, exceptions. They seem to have come from a
different source and to have been set down by an illiterate. Changes
from the text have been made only after careful comparison with variant
texts or on the advice or with the approval of native interpreters.
Important variations in meaning have been based upon the interpretation
of the whole passage. All changes from the Kalakaua text are here noted.
Reference is made to Kukahi's printed version, cited as "Ku"; to the
manuscript source, cited as "MS"; and, for the genealogies, to the
Kamokuiki book, cited as "Kms." In a few cases comparisons are quoted
from the reprint of Kukahi in *Aloha*, from Bastian, and from Poepoe's
rough manuscript, all cited by name. Star names are checked from Mrs.
Makemson's list.
