# CHAPTER TWENTY

#### The Woman Who Bore Children through the Brain

THE long-lived man's genealogy ends with the eleventh section of the
Kumulipo chant as we have it today. The twelfth takes up the genealogy
of a younger branch from Opu'upu'u and continues from another younger
brother called 'Ololo, "Brain." The thirteenth opens with a genealogy
from the elder Paliku branch. This section introduces the figure of the
mysterious form-changing goddess Haumea by whom are "born from the
brain" a brood of offspring, first to the god Kanaloa and then to her
own descendants, a story returned to in still more detail in the
poetical prologue introducing the genealogy of the fifteenth section.
Here, "jealous of her husband's second mate," Haumea "becomes a woman,"
takes a husband among men, and lives up Kalihi valley in the northern
range of mountains on the island of Oahu, finally using her power as a
goddess to disappear into a breadfruit tree: "A breadfruit body, trunk
and leaves she had," says the chant.

The name Ha(na)u-mea, "Sacred-birth," is perhaps derived from the
strange births "from the brain" with which the chant credits her or from
the different forms she takes to "sleep" with children and
grandchildren. It does not appear in any other Hawaiian genealogy so far
as I know, in spite of the important part played by the goddess Haumea
today in folk belief. Haumea is goddess of childbirth and in the
Hawaiian "Book of Medicine" is credited with having saved a chief's
daughter of Oahu from a Caesarean operation

{p. 111}

by giving her an herb medicine to produce natural birth. In view of the
reference in a variant story to a bamboo tree worshiped in her name in
connection with this achievement and the ingenious instruments of bamboo
used in old days for procuring abortion,\[1\] it seems to me likely that
her services in connection with birth were of this nature rather than
the other. Possibly it was she who introduced the custom. The story
written into the medicine book may have been a modern attempt to
whitewash the character of the goddess of birth in the light of
Christian mores.

However this may be, Haumea's children are described not only as "born
from the brain" (ma ka lolo) but as "drivelers." "*Ha'ae wale ka hanauna
lolo*," says the chant, and today Hawaiians call children who drivel at
the mouth "Haumea's children from the brain." The soft spot on an
infant's head, called manawa, they derive from Haumea's form of giving
birth: "*Oia wahine hanau manawa i na keiki*," as the chant puts it.
Even today, if a mother lacks milk for her infant, a mash of sweet
potato bound over the fontanel is supposed to supply nourishment.
Popular legend has localized the life of Haumea up Kalihi Valley and
added details to the story. The old heiau of Kai'ele in Kalihi is
sometimes pointed to as the place where she changed her shape from age
to youth. The spot on the Nu'uanu stream is well known where grew the
breadfruit tree into which she vanished with her husband to escape those
about to put him to death for trespassing upon the chief's taboo
plantings. Another legend makes Haumea controller of wild vegetable food
on Oahu. From her home on the mountain ridges she sends a drought. Men
seek food from other lands and food plants are introduced. Haumea is,
further, a goddess of underground heat, and some call her mother of the
Pele family

\[1. Ellis, IV, 327; Beckwith, *Hawaiian Mythology*, chap. xix.\]

{p. 112}

at the volcano, each member born from a different part of her body, Pele
alone from between her thighs. In her character as goddess of heat she
may become a possessing spirit (*akua noho*).\[2\] Says Ho'olapa, "Taro
greens placed on the back of a person Haumea has entered will cook
there," and he adds, "I have eaten such luau and it was really cooked."

In spite of all these uncouth elements in the Haumea story, its likeness
to that of La'ila'i, notwithstanding its less aristocratic setting, can
scarcely be dismissed as coincidental. La'ila'i is also a shape-shifting
(*paha'oha'o*) woman. She comes from 'Iliponi within 'I'ipakalani, as
Haumea from 'I'ilipo, and both from the land of the gods called
Nu'umealani, to which Papa also retires in one version of her story.
La'ila'i's children by Ki'i come, like Haumea's, "from the brain." The
heat of sexual passion ascribed to La'ila'i in connection with the
aphorism of the fire stick is attributed to Haumea as an indwelling
spirit, although not directly noticed in the chant. La'ila'i's affair in
the "land of Lua" is a close parallel to Haumea's and must belong to a
common tradition, independently elaborated.

Just as Haumea in folk legend has a part in the Pele myth, so La'ila'i's
offspring by Ki'i closely resemble those Hawaiians today called *'ehu*
people, who are believed to belong to the Pele family from the brown
color of their hair and the reddish tint in their skin. The chant of the
ninth section describes them as "ruddy" (*ke aka 'ula*) with "fine
reddish hair at puberty" (*he hua ulu 'i'i*) and red-brown beard
(*huluhulu 'a*) among a dark, black-haired, smooth-faced people. They
are aggressive and "leap to the heavens" (*lele pu i ka lani*), meaning
perhaps that they push their claim to rank. "The Ki'i people give good
jobs to their children," says Ho'olapa. Their advent into the social
order

\[2. Malo, pp. 155-57.\]

{p. 113}

is accompanied by the "trembling of earth" (*ola'i ku honua*) and the
"splitting open of the heavens" (*owa ka lani*), suggesting the
commotion among an established theocracy at the rise of an upstart
branch from an alien source.

The story of Haumea begins at line 1760 of the Paliku genealogy, where
Mulinaha the husband takes to wife 'Ipo'i. The word *'ipo* means
"sweetheart," and the intensive termination gives her first place of her
kind, hence "Sweet-heart-supreme." It is difficult to say whether the
nine women named in the lines following with their respective husbands
are supposed to have been born of these two. All are said to be Haumea
herself in one of her manifold forms, five of them those in which she
"lived with children and grandchildren." There is also some ground for
identifying "Sweetheart-supreme" herself with Haumea, as the lines seem
to read. At all events the break with Ki'o, "from whom spread the
chiefs," may indicate a breakdown, under a new regime, of the social
system set up under the Kanaloa priesthood. The whole treatment of
Haumea as wife of the god Kanaloa in the two chants elaborating her
story can hardly be anything but a symbolic retelling of some such event
in the family history, to be discussed more in detail under the closing
section of the chant. I can only add here a purely speculative
suggestion that the curious birth "from the brain" (*ma ka lolo*) may
derive from a play upon the 'Ololo ("Brain") branch and carry a hint of
some liaison on the elder Paliku line with the younger branch, as of
La'ila'i with Ki'i.

Wrinkled behind, wrinkled before  
Bent and grey the breast, worthless was \[the one of\] Nu'u-mea \[?\]

With Ki'o came forth the chiefs  
He slept with Kamole, with the woman of the woodland

\[The genealogical line follows from Ki'o seven generations to Ki'i at
line 1974. To Ki'i is born by his wife Hinako'ula, a famous name in
Hawaiian romance, the two sons 'Ulu and Nana'ulu, names common to other
Polynesian genealogies of chief line. To one or the other of these two
all Hawaiian chiefs trace their line of descent. The Kumulipo genealogy
continues from 'Ulu. At line 1984 it introduces the parents of the Maui
brothers, and the section concludes with the name song of the Maui born
"on the back of Wakea," presumably the same Maui who heads the closing
genealogy of the sixteenth section.\]
