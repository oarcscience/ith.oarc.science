# CHAPTER EIGHT

#### Prologue to the Night World

T0 ILLUSTRATE, how the slant upon the meaning of a text may affect
translation of a passage, here is the Prologue to the chant of the first
section, to be followed by the various renderings already published or
suggested by my interpreters. The lines read:

O ke au i kahuli wela ka honua  
O ke au i kahuli lole ka lani  
O ke au i kuka'iaka ka la  
E ho'omalamalama i ka malama  
O ke an i Makali'i ka po  
O ka Walewale ho'okumu honua ia  
O ke kumu o ka lipo  
O ke kumu o ka Po i po ai  
O ka Lipolipo, o ka lipolipo  
O ka lipo o ka La, o ka lipo o ka Po  
Po wale ho-i

Bastian, who knew the text from the manuscript alone, was the first to
attempt its analysis. His translation into German gives a poetic turn to
the thought. The first six lines give him the picture of a burnt-out
world just taking shape again out of the mists of night under the first
faint light of the moon. The next four stress the idea of remoteness, at
the very roots where darkness begins, far from the sun, far from the
"night." Bastian is thinking in terms of a European concept, that of a
world conflagration out of which a new world rises. He gets his start
from the word *wela*, meaning "hot, fiery." It is, however, doubtful
whether this Old World concept

{p. 43}

had any place in Polynesian cosmic philosophy. Bastian writes:

Hin dreht der Zeitumschwung zum Ausgebrannten der Welt,  
Zurück der Zeitumschwung nach aufwärts wieder,  
Noch sonnenlos die Zeit verhüllten Lichtes,  
Und schwankend nur im matten Mondgeschimmer  
Aus Makalii's nächt'gem Wolkenschleier  
Durchzittert schaftenhaft das Grundbild künft'ger Welt.  
Des Dunkels Beginn aus den Tiefen (Wurzeln) des Abgrunds,  
Der Uranfang von Nacht in Nacht,  
Von weitesten Fernen her, von weitesten Fernen,  
Weit aus den Fernen der Sonne, weit aus den Fernen der Nacht,  
Noch Nacht ringsumher.\[1\]

Rock translates:

The wheel of time turns to the burnt-out remains of the world,  
Back again, then upwards,  
Time is as yet sunless with a dull light,  
And only floating in the dim moonlight  
From Makalii's awful veil of cloud  
Tremble through in shadowy fashion the outlines of the future world,  
The beginning of darkness from the depths (roots) of the abyss,  
The primordial beginning of night in night  
From far away, far, far away,  
Far from the remoteness of the sun, far from the remoteness of the
night,  
Still night all around.

Here again the thought is European. The wheel was unknown in Polynesia;
still less could the idea of time as a revolving wheel be a genuine
native concept. Nor did the Polynesian poet stand off and view his world
in Miltonic form as trembling "in shadowy fashion" through "an awful
veil of cloud." He thought of it, if at all, as a land mass up heaved
from primeval waters out of a kind of pit leading to underworlds whence
life sprang and to which it might return; arched above also by an
equivalent number of sky

\[1. Bastian, p. 70\]

{p. 44}

worlds inhabited by ancestral gods. In short, neither Bastian nor his
translator has contributed to our understanding of the possible meaning
of the lines with which the Kumulipo chant opens.

With Queen Liliuokalani the case is different. Her literal rendering
keeps fairly within native thought. As an educated Hawaiian of chief
stock, she had ample opportunity to consult those still living who knew
something of the old chant. She was also herself a composer of charming
songs turned in the symbolic style familiar to Hawaiian mele. Her
translation pictures the rise of earth out of slime at the time when the
first light begins to dawn out of darkness before the sun was. She
retains the stylistic features of the original--formal repetition as a
mnemonic device and a play of opposites, in this case the idea of earth
(*honua*) as opposed to heaven (*lani*); of darkness (*po*) used here
with the contrasting word la, meaning the light of day or "sun"; of
illumination, *ho'omalamalama*, used in contrast to "deep darkness" or
"depth of darkness," *lipo*, *lipolipo*. Emphasis upon the dawn of light
bringing heat to earth is conveyed by the word wela, meaning "hot" or
"fiery," upon the light itself by such specific words as "sun" (*la*),
"moon" (*malama*), and in the word *aka* signifying "the first faint
light of the rising moon." These words the queen generally renders by
some more neutral phrase. The native idea of the word lipo is of "dark
from the depth of a cavern, or from the depth of the sea." It implies a
space concept and at the same time one of degree of shade as applied,
for example, to the change in color of the ocean as one gets away from
shore into deep water. As a cosmographic term it describes the ocean
bottom where lies the slime (*walewale*) out of which life emerges. Its
makeup from the words *(u)li po*, "darkness of (the) depth," has already
been suggested. The queen writes:

At the time that turned the heat of the earth  
At the time when the heavens turned and changed

{p. 45}

At the time when the light of the sun was subdued  
To cause light to break forth  
At the time of the night of Makalii \[winter\]  
Then began the slime which established the earth,  
The source of deepest darkness,  
Of the depth of darkness, of the depth of darkness,  
Of the darkness of the sun, in the depth of night,  
    It is night,  
    So was night born.

By smoothing out some rough phrasing and allowing for the running of the
seventh and eighth lines into one line, we get a quite reasonable
version from the cosmic point of view, a character implied also in the
reiteration of the word *kumu*, read as "source," and *ho'okumu*, read
as "established." The relation of "night" to the establishment of earth
is not, how ever, made clear.

The *Aloha* translation from Kukahi's text follows the same train of
thought. The first lines--

The time when the earth was hotly changed  
The time when the heavens separately changed--

suggest the Polynesian myth of the forcible separation of Earth and Sky
to admit the light of day, but I do not know by what authority the idea
is read into the word lole, which means "to turn inside out" and is the
basis for the cataclysm of world forces read into the text by some
commentators, as well as for the idea of the seasonal return of the sun
north ward at the opening of the new year, as in the queen's rendering.
The next lines read:

The time when the sun was rising  
To give light to the moon,

but it is doubtful whether Hawaiians knew that the light of the moon
came from the sun, and if they did so believe, they were too good
observers to represent the sun as "rising" to give such light. In the
sixth line *walewale* is changed to *welawela*, meaning "intense heat"
or "strong emotion" and

{p. 46}

good from the point of view of the link with wela of the first line but
ignored in translation, where the line reads:

Then was the creating of the earth.

In lines seven and eight the word kumu is translated by "reason" in
place of the usual "source" or "beginning," and the lines are written
with inverted commas as if quoting a popular saying,

'The reason for the deep, to get depth,  
The reason for night, to get darkness.'

Poepoe's explanatory notes attached to his roughly penciled text give an
even more explicit cosmic meaning to the lines. The first two he thinks
tell of "the coming of fire from the inside of the earth and leaving in
confusion (inside out) the heavens and the earth." The word *Kuka'iaka*
is "the moon," called "the sun that lighted the period called po."
Makali'i is "the first month of the year," and he adds, "at this time
these materials were made." The phrase *wale ho'okumu honua* he refers
to "the beginning of the earth because of the melting together of the
earthy material and water. They were mixed this way and that, became
melted, and are called the Kumulipo, the slimey beginning of the earth."
Poepoe is here bringing to bear upon the text the scientific knowledge
acquired through foreign culture. He reads into the lines the formation
of earth as a factual process without recognizing such spiritual forces
as become explicit in Tahitian chants and could hardly have been absent
from the thought of ancient Hawaii.

Thus far the cosmic interpretation alone has been illustrated. In the
*Honolulu Advertiser* for November 12, 1936, Theodore Kelsey, born in
Hawaii and familiar with the language, although not himself of Hawaiian
parentage, printed a "combined literal and symbolic interpretation."
Without quoting his whole paraphrase, I wish to point out some ideas it
contains that may throw light upon the underlying meaning. {p. 47} He
distinguishes the literal interpretation--that of the creation of light
and life on earth--from the symbolic, to be found also in the story of
the first man Kumu-honua ("Source-of-earth") and the first woman,
Lalo-honua ("Earth-beneath-the-surface"), the two called in this chant
Kumu-lipo ("Source-of-profundity") and Po'ele ("Darkness"). What is here
symbolically pictured as the "earth" (*honua*) is to be interpreted as
"Hawaii's original royal line, hot with fiercest tabu--*kapu wela*."
Makali'i is the season when seeds sprout, fish spawn, and the Pleiades
(the Makali'i) appear with other stars high in the heavens. At this time
the sun was "like a vital fluid of generation that produced life." As
the line of Wakea's descendants increased in number, its beginnings
stretched far back into the past and this past grew more and more dim in
memory. The poet therefore proceeds to explore back into the profound
depth of the past for the beginning of the royal ancestral line. Kelsey
has here a definite conception of the symbolism under the literal
wording of the lines. Life on earth is engendered by the heat of the
sun. As the sun symbolizes the procreative power whence life proceeds,
whose source is the god of generation in the spirit world, so a chief
descended from the god and "hot with fiercest taboo" carries on through
procreation the continuity of the family line. "Darkness" Kelsey applies
to distance in time rather than in space. The pit idea is absent and
attention fixed upon a genealogical beginning of the chief stock in a
time so remote as to be lost to memory.

Kupihea, keeper of the king's fishponds, rejects the Prologue
altogether. He thinks Kalakaua himself exchanged it for the original two
lines with which the chant opened--

Hanau ka po i ka po, po no,  
Hanau mai a puka i ke ao, malamalama--

to be translated,

Things born in the night are of the dark,  
Things born from and sprung up in the day are of the light.

{p. 48} Dark and light, *po* and *ao*, he would refer to the
intellectual faculties in man as opposed to plants and animals. The
first seven sections of the chant represent the generation of the gods
in the bodies of beings without the light of reason. With the eighth
section man emerges, and the period of the Ao has to do with the
children of men, who multiply on the earth from the first birth of the
god of procreation in the body of man. With man dawned the rational
powers. The Ao is peopled by creatures endowed with power to develop
arts and crafts, all cultural activities; the Po, by creatures
"controlled" by gods alone, that is, born not through man kind but
through the gods. The Po is a spirit world, the Ao a world of living
men.

Still more specific is Pokini Robinson's interpretation of the Prologue.
Her fresh approach, uninstructed save by long familiarity with chant
practice in chief circles, gives her opinion special interest. She
believes, like Kelsey, that the lines herald the birth of the divine
child whose stages of development are followed in the succeeding
sections of the chant. He is called a "fire" (*wela*) because of his
taboo rank, "heavenly one" (*lani*) as a customary mark of honor. The
word *walewale* names the seven-day purification period for the mother
after childbirth as well as the "slime" whence the divine seed sprouted.
The shining of the "sun" (*la*) she refers to the dim opening of the
child's eyes to the light. Thus the child is born in the first line,
"turns over" in the second, "opens its eyes" in the third. The birth
takes place during the month of Makali'i, when the sun returns north
ward and the season of growth begins.

I am not sure whether Pokini would push the symbolism back to an Adamic
birth, origin of the race, or give it a more immediate reference to the
birth of the child for whom the chant was first composed, whether
Keawe's or another. If she would actually refer it to the time now lost
to memory

{p. 49}

when the first Lono was born as a taboo chief on earth, the lines might
be paraphrased something like this:

The time of the birth of the taboo chief,  
The time when the Heavenly One pushed his way out,  
The time when the bright one first saw the light,  
At first faintly like the light of the moon,  
At the season of Makali'i in the far past.  
From the slime of the mother the stock began,  
Began in the spirit world,  
Began in the time of the gods in a world of gods,  
In the far distant past lost in remoteness;  
Long ago was the coming of the bright one into the world of the gods,  
    A world still peopled by gods alone.
