# CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

#### The Woman Who Sat Sideways

IN THIS second half of the Kumulipo chant, called the Ao, the period of
living men, three myths of parenthood of mankind from the gods are
blended. The first is the myth of La'ila'i who became mother of gods and
men through her relations with the god Kane and the man Ki'i. The second
is the myth of Haumea and the god Kanaloa, of Haumea's children born
"from the brain" and her strange renewals of youth to become mother and
wife of children and grandchildren. The third is the myth of Papa and
Wakea; of Wakea's affair with his daughter and the consequent quarrel
with Papa; of his fishing up an underseas woman, from whom sea creatures
are born, a woman whose son usurps the normal succession upon the family
line. In many ways these stories overlap as if they were variants from a
common source. It is possible that they represent the way in which
different branches on the family line have inherited from their masters
of song the story of beginning traditional with their stock.

The. first four sections of the Ao period tell the story of La'ila'i's
relations with Kane the god and Ki'i the man. Kane is the word used for
"man" in his procreative function, equivalent to our word "male"; Ki'i
means "image." So in the Hebrew Scriptures man was created in the
"image" of God. Kanaloa, listed as third in the trio of males born with
the woman La'ila'i at the dawn of human life, disappears from the action
altogether after his birth in the body of an octopus is anonunced
{*sic*} in the eighth ode. This eighth section must be regarded as a
kind of synopsis of the next three,

{p. 100}

although the harmonizing of the four is so extremely uncertain as to be
best left to the intuition of the reader in the light of whatever
information or suggestion can be gleaned further from native sources to
clarify particular obscurities.

In the ninth chant La'ila'i seems to live successively with Kane and
with Ki'i. A period of intermarriage follows among her posterity:
literally, they increase "by forty thousand and by four thousand" (*he
kini, he mano*) corresponding to the sacred numbering of the lesser gods
invoked in temple prayers. The chant closes with the birth of the same
three offspring of La'ila'i as were named in the eighth ode when she
lived "as a woman" in the land of Lua, here called "part of the family
of that woman mentioned above" (*la*). The gist of the story seems to be
that the woman left the land of "the gods in the heavens" and life with
her legitimate mate to wed a mere mortal on earth, whose offspring,
half-god, half-man, are known as the ruddy-faced, bearded stock
traditionally known as "children of Ki'i" and today connected with the
family of the volcano goddess Pele, who thus becomes a fourth in the
variations upon the part played by mother Eve in the Hawaiian genesis
drama.

Two aphorisms used in this chant to describe the part played here by the
"woman who sat sideways" of the eighth chant clearly refer, the one to
the function of sex to insure family survival, the other to the freedom
of woman in sex matters. The line reading *No ka aunaki kuku ahi kanaka*
is an allusion to the common method of starting a fire by means of two
firesticks. One, the hard-grained *aulima*, is held upright in the hand
(*lima*) and rubbed back and forth upon the hollowed surface of the
other, the softer *aunaki*, to produce the spark, the action being a
perfectly understood sex symbol among Hawaiians. Hence the line is to be
literally translated, "From the female firestick comes the fire that
makes man." In other words, woman, impregnated by the male, nurses the
spark of life that develops into a living man.

{p. 101}

The second aphorism reads *I hohole pahiwa ka lau koa* and is rendered
by Kawena: "She stripped the dark leaves of the koa tree." The allusion
is to the branch of the forest *koa* tree, the native acacia set up on
the altar in a school of the hula dance as a prayer for "courage"
(*koa*). The symbolism depends upon word play. *Koa* is the Hawaiian
word for a soldier, used with the same intent. Call him that and he will
be courageous; upon this principle a belief in word magic works. Courage
in a woman depends upon her meeting successfully the challenge of sex
relations, and it was hence the power to excite erotic emotion that
marked the triumph of a hula dancer. Kawena Pukui recalls an old custom
in Ka-u district of forbidding a dancer to refuse a kiss at the close of
a hula performance, however distasteful the person offering the
tribute-doubtless a survival of more intimate advances once encouraged
in the name of the lustful divinity supposed to be directly inspiring
the successful dancer.\[1\] It was this element in the hula tradition
that shocked even a foreigner like Vancouver and made the hula dance a
taboo pastime under missionary influence. With the revival today of the
art, the aim is to merge the erotic element in the aesthetic.

Translation of the tenth chant is involved in considerable difficulty.
Pokini Robinson interpreted it as a prayer for the building of the house
in which a young couple were to start housekeeping together, and this
seems plausible, although the exact bearing of each line upon this
general background is not always evident. According to Pokini, Hawaiians
call the prayer used at each stage of a house-building the Pokinikini,
the name here given to the parent of Kane in his reproductive energy,
Kane of the Night-of-multltudes. The three children born to La'ila'i by
Kane in the lines following, whose names appear also on the Kamokuiki
genealogy, are invoked, says Pokini, as protectors in applying the
thatch-grass

\[1. Pukui, *California Folklore Quarterly*, II, 219.\]

{p. 102}

to complete the house. Kawena translates the names by such suggestively
amorous terms for the girls as "Coquette" and "Fondly-recalled," with
"Fair-haired" for the male of the family.

On this basis, the doubtful opening lines take on a clearer meaning. As
written in the text they name Maila, born to La'ila'i when she lived as
a woman in the land of Lua; but, if read *O mai la*, where *O* replaces
the regular *e* before an imperative, they would summon to a place in
the interior of the new home the gods of procreation, the god Kane of
the Night-of-multitudes and La'ila'i, the goddess who "sat sideways" to
become mother of mankind. This would be in keeping with Polynesian
thought, although we have no confirmation of such an idea in Hawaii.
Firth tells us that in Tikopia "structural members of a building" are
regarded as "actual embodiments of deity"--hence the fixed positions in
the house which were assigned to members of the household. At the house
post sits the male head of the house with his sons and male guests whom
he would honor, since the god is considered to be actually present in
the stone upon which the post rests, while the women range along the
opposite wall.\[2\] If this is true for Hawaii, where is the place of
*Ki'i ka mahu* in the structural setup? The word *mahú* with the accent
on the last syllable is applied to a hermaphrodite; it is also given the
sense of "quiet." Firth tells us that the Tikopians had gods regarded as
double-sexed, not in the physical sense but in the sense that, like the
Indian god Siva, they were able to show themselves in either a male or a
female body. A curious Tahitian chant gives to the god 'Atea such a
shift of sex, a shift that would, if accepted in Hawaii, explain how
Wakea, further on in the Kumulipo chant, lures a water maiden to shore
by setting up images (*ki'i*), or why the god Kauakahi, in a folktale
from Hilo district on Hawaii, is described

\[2. Firth, Work of the Gods in Tikopia, p. 64.\]

{p. 103}

as hiding behind an image of a girl until the unsuspecting water nymph
of whom he is amorous comes within his grasp.\[3\] It is possible that
Ki'i, as "image" of the god, has the power of appearing in either sex,
but I am without evidence that Hawaiians regarded Ki'i as double-sexed
or whether, if they did so regard him, they would give the name *mahu*
to such an attribute. The queen's translation,

Maila, with Lailai for protection  
And Kane of Kapokinikini was support, Kii was helpless,

seems to imply that Ki'i, perhaps representing the danger to a young
wife of a misalliance, is one of the evil spirits to be conjured into
helplessness. On the other hand, the word *mahu*, unaccented, may apply
to a smoldering fire and it would then be possible to think of Ki'i as
personifying the fire of sexual passion, with a place in the interior of
the house at the oven kept smoldering for quick rekindling, were it not
for the fact that Hawaiians built their ovens out of doors and had no
need of house fires for heating. The problem hence remains for further
investigators, and I take refuge in the more general of the suggested
readings.

After the birth of offspring "at Kapapa," La'ila'i returns to Kane the
god and bears to him the three deities who guard. the thatching of the
house. The last half of the chant takes: up the quarrel for the
succession. Kamaha'ina, "First-born" on earth, will take precedence over
Hakea born in the heavens. Ki'i the man, through this first-born, will
establish the long line of chiefs of the forest uplands enumerated in
chant eleven. Again comes the problem whether La'ila'i herself or the
daughter Maila is involved in the scandal. The phrase *lae punia* at
line 698 is said to apply to a father-daughter union like the
traditional Wakea-Papa affair, and the *'ape* which La'ila'i gives to
Ki'i rather than to Kane, to

\[3. Firth, *We the Tikopia*, p. 470; Henry, p. 372; Beckwith, *Hawaiian
Mythology*, pp. 540-41.\]

{p. 104}

refer to the young daughter rather than to the mother. There is no doubt
a historical allusion that escapes us.

Certainly the gossips are set in motion. If all the world loves a lover,
all the world and their wives love a scandal, and a Hawaiian audience is
particularly susceptible to this form of erotic titillation. The
reaction upon outsiders and then that upon the injured husband is
indicated by playing first upon the k sound to express precise forms of
inarticulate disapproval in the head-shaking and kluck-klucking of the
court gossips, then upon sounds in *m* combined with *u* to give the
mood of sulky silence preserved at first by the husband when he begins
to suspect the truth of the matter. The passage is impossible to render
in English, certainly not literally. The fact seems to be that children
are born but by whom Kane is ignorant. He suspects the woman of giving
"the sacred *'apé*" to Ki'i, an expression equivalent to Eve's forbidden
apple and here perhaps symbolizing the importance placed upon virginity
for the wife of a taboo chief whose child is to become his heir.

As a matter of fact, the quarrel turns, not upon the proper jealousy of
a husband for the honor of his wife, a quite unusual situation it would
seem in Hawaiian court life, but upon this question of primogeniture.
Kane sees that his own son will serve the son of Ki'i:

His descendants will hence belong to the younger line,  
The children of the elder will be lord \[?\].

Thus the house-building prayer lays final stress upon a rule of utmost
importance to family standing and to political security, the rule that
gives precedence to a wife's first-born. The story of the "woman who sat
sideways" may have been told at this point as a warning to the young
wife not to lose for her offspring the rank she might preserve for them,
but to give her first-born to the husband with whom she has been
properly mated. It is altogether possible, however, that

{p. 105}

the symbolism here has been deflected to this practical conclusion from
an originally more mythical ending.
