# CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

### Papa and Wakea

WAKEA in the form of Atea or Vatea, replaced in New Zealand by Rangi
(Lani) meaning "Sky," appears as a primary male generative force
throughout eastern Polynesia, the name a symbol of the upper regions of
air, whence descend sunshine and rain to fertilize earth. The wife Papa,
a word applied in Hawaii to a flat surface or layer, symbolizes the warm
upper layer of earth, where lies the fertilized seed awaiting the period
of maturity to spring into life. But to the Polynesian these functions
of sky and earth are themselves direct analogues of the process of human
reproduction. Animate nature manifested in the physical universe is
equally potent, if properly approached, to insure human fertility.
Father Sky and Mother Earth are the first parents of human life on earth
as they are of plant life that springs living from earth under the
influence of sun and rain from heaven and of animal life that feeds upon
it.

At the time of foreign contact Hawaii, too, counted its stock from Wakea
and Papa as the official parent-pair. Their names occur on the earliest
genealogy of the race given out by Hawaiian students at the mission high
school in 1838 and repeated forty years later by Judge Fornander in his
Account of the Polynesian Race. They are quoted by Malo and incorporated
into the report made in 1904 by a committee of native scholars appointed
by the legislature to inquire into the true native tradition of "the
beginning of the Hawaiian people."\[1\]

\[1. *Mo'olelo Hawaii*, p. 36; Fornander, *Polynesian Race*, I, 188-90;
Malo, p. 311; Kepelino, Appendix, p. 182.\]

{p. 118}

Equally on the common tongue, although stoutly repudiated by the
*Mo'olelo Hawaii* and called "doubtful" by Malo, was the story of
Wakea's desire for his youthful daughter, the plan to allay Papa's
suspicions by instituting taboo nights when men should live apart from
their wives, Papa's discovery, her repudiation of Wakea and her taking a
mate in another land, finally her return to Wakea upon hearing that he,
too, had solaced himself with another wife.\[2\] A famous chant of
Kamehameha's day tells the story under the figure of the "birth of
islands," symbolizing by means of the various alliances of the two
parents in the myth the actual rise of ruling chief families on the
islands of the Hawaiian group.\[3\] The sly sobriquet of "Wakea" said to
have been attached to the Ka-'I-'i-mamao to whom the Kumulipo chant was
allegedly dedicated, who took his own daughter to wife, further shows
the myth to have been current at the time that the prose note to the
Kumulipo was written down. More obscurely but with equal consistency was
repeated the name of Haloa, the first living child born to Wakea, some
said by his own daughter, and named from the "long-stalk" (*ha-loa*) of
the taro plant that grew from the body of an earlier embryo child buried
beside the house.\[4\]

Thus heading the genealogy of chiefs, their story woven into chant and
applied to contemporary court life, Wakea and Papa seem to have been in
historic times at least the officially accepted progenitors through
Haloa of the Hawaiian people, if not of the whole race of humankind. The
Mo'olelo Hawaii reads, "Wakea and Papa were the first ancestors of the
Hawaiian people, both chiefs and commoners."

\[2. *Mo'olelo Hawaii*, pp. 37-40; Malo, pp. 314-15; Kepelino, pp.
62-67; Kamakau, *Ke Au Okoa*, October 14, 1869; Fornander, *Collection*
"Memoirs," No. 6), p. 250; Beckwith, *Hawaiian Mythology*, chap. xx.

4\. Malo, p. 320; Kepelino, Appendix, pp. 192-93; Fornander,
*Collection* ("Memoirs." No. 6), p. 319.\]

{p. 119} "This is the genealogy of the Hawaiian people; that is, from
Kumulipo-ka-po to Wakea and Papa," concludes the committee report of
1904. Malo calls Haloa "progenitor of all the peoples of the earth."
"Now you must understand that the children born from Haloa, these are
yourselves," reads a passage from the manuscript notes kept by the
Hawaiian Naua Society, organized during the period of the late monarchy.
It is not difficult to see that by the name "Haloa" the Hawaiian
genealogist is merely symbolizing the male sex organ. It is the genius
of the storyteller, probably stimulated by the habit of concealing under
cover of myth some court incident of his own day, that has woven so rich
a background of fiction about these ancient impersonations of the sex
function invoked to insure permanence in the family succession.

Important as the two seem to be as parent-pair in modern Hawaiian
tradition, in the Kumulipo, Wakea and Papa play an apparently minor
part. Always their names and story come at the end of a section as if
possibly inserted as an afterthought or introduced late into the family
tradition. Still less is the name of Haloa important. The Opu'upu'u
branch of the twelfth section closes with his birth: "Wakea lived
(*noho*) with Haumea, with Papa, with Haohokakalani \[commonly written
Ho'ohokukalani\], Haloa was born," reads the passage. Only in a brief
peroration to Papa at the close of the thirteenth section is the story
noticed of Wakea's deception of Papa, the taboos imposed, and the birth
of the embryo Long-stalk and the living son Haloa. At line 1951 Haloa's
name is thrust into the list of grandchildren with whom Haumea "slept"
(*moe*). Otherwise he has no important place upon the final genealogy
leading to the chief stock with which the chant concludes. Papa and
Wakea do not appear there at all. Papa's traditional life as a woman in
the land of Lua is transferred to Haumea or perhaps originally told of
La'ila'i. Altogether we must suppose

{p. 120}

that Wakea and Papa as parent-pair responsible through Haloa for the
spread of mankind over earth had no initial importance for the family
whose divine ancestors were commemorated in the Kumulipo prayer chant.

In the genealogy of the fourteenth section, certainly, Wakea is rather
fully represented, but here again his story stands at the close rather
than the beginning of the genealogical listing with which the chant
opens. This breaks off at line 1840 with the birth of Wakea under the
name of Pau-pani-a\[wa\]kea, "End-of-the-shutting-out-of-light."
Hawaiians call midday Awakea and the eulogistic title may herald the
light of the midday sun when no shadow is cast and a magician's power is
greatest. It further suggests the myth so fully developed in Tahiti and
New Zealand of the separation of Sky Father and Earth Mother in order to
give light and space for life to expand on earth, or that told in
Mangaia of Vatea carried upward by the wind with his wife Papa into the
upper world of light.\[5\]

Born with Wakea are two others, Lehu'ula, generally written Lihau'ula
and sometimes identified with Kanaloa, and Makulukulu. The three,
according to a perhaps late tradition, represent the ancestors of the
three classes of Hawaiian society: chiefs, priests, and commoners.\[6\]
The chiefs held the land under a single ruling chief who apportioned it,
and each farmed out his share to a succession of overseers whose duty it
was to see that a proportionate share of the produce was brought in as
tribute to his overlord.\[7\] Makulukulu in the trio I take to represent
this function of the commoners, and the "stars hung in the heavens,"
enumerated at length in the lines following to symbolize the "bundles"
brought in as tribute at the Makahiki or some

\[5. Henry, pp. 405-7, 409-13; White, I, 161-62; Smith, pp. 121-22;

{p. 121}

other great festival of the clan, the whole representing, according to
Pokini, the procession arriving with their gifts to lay before the young
heir, made up into a pair of bundles and "swung" over a shoulder pole as
was the customary way of carrying loads in Hawaii.

The Makahiki itself takes its name from the rising of the Pleiades,
known throughout Polynesia as Makali'i, and Makulukulu may perhaps be a
chant name for Makali'i. In the migration legend of the great fisherman
Hawaii-loa, who discovers and renames the islands of the group, Makali'i
is said to be navigator of the fleet and to become ancestor of commoners
as Hawaii-loa is ancestor of a chief stock.\[8\] In fiction Makali'i is
a popular character and always represented in connection with food
supply. He is a chief living on the island of Kauai, or at South Cape on
the island of Hawaii, or "in Kahiki," or in the upper heaven as seer and
caretaker of the vegetable garden of the gods Kane and Kanaloa. His men
have special arts in fishing. He controls vegetable food and is
niggardly with it, "hangs it up in the heavens," as the saying is, when
a drought burns up a crop. Always in the stories there is a thief who
robs the patch or cuts the cords of the net in which his foodstuffs have
been stored away. A string figure called "net of Makali'i" shows the
net, its several divisions, and the exact point where, with a single
cut, the whole figure falls to pieces. One of the ceremonies of the
Makahiki festival was the shaking of a loose-meshed net filled with all
kinds of vegetable foods in order to deter mine by the amount that fell
through the meshes the success of the crop for the coming year.\[9\]

For the identification of stars named in the next fifty lines I am
indebted to Dr. Maud Makemson, who obtained her information from living
Hawaiians or from previously recorded

\[8. Beckwith, *Hawaiian Mythology*, pp. 363-65.

9\. Makemson, pp. 75-84, 129-32; Malo, pp. 197-98; Beckwith, *Hawaiian
Mythology*, pp. 365-69, and see Index.\]

{p. 122}

sources.\[10\] Their appearance in the heavens directly after the birth
of Wakea has ended the "shutting out of light" agrees with the New
Zealand myth, where the covering of the naked expanse of Sky with the
heavenly bodies and of Earth with vegetation follows the Pushing upward
of the sky to let in the light. The list may further be regarded as a
kind of genealogy, since Hawaiians claim that stars are called after
chiefs, although the exact connection has never been fully explained.
The genealogy of beginning quoted by the Committee of 1904 notes the
birth of "men" who "flew to heaven ... after all of whom stars are
named." So in Tahiti an obscure passage in the story of the "Birth of
the Heavenly Bodies" tells how Ta'ura "The red one," a name given to the
star Sirius, took a wife of whom "princes" were born, Matari'i
(Makali'i) being one; then were "created kings of the chiefs of earthly
hosts on one side, and of chiefs in the skies on the other side. All
were royal personages in Fa'ahiti ... from the period of darkness (Po)
and they each had a star. They bore the names of those stars, and those
names have been perpetuated in their temples in this world.\[11\]

Following the star lists comes a passage touching upon the adventures of
Wakea with a goddess celebrated in Hawaiian story as "Hina-of-the-moon,"
she who is known in Tahiti as "Hina-who-stepped-into-the-moon," or, in
Hawaii again, as Lonomuku, "Maimed-Lono" because, if the myth is
correctly interpreted, when she fled to the moon from her earthly
companion she left in his hand as he grasped after her one of her legs,
from which grew the potato. Directly after, Hina-kawe'o-a is named, but
whether the same Hina or another is not made clear. This Hina is
certainly identical with "Hina-of-the-fire" who is mother of Maui in the
chant of the fifteenth section. A Fornander

\[10. Makemson, chap. vii.

11\. Henry, p. 363.\]

{p. 123}

genealogy gives Maui's mother the name of Kawea. The name of
Hina-of-the-fire, Hina-a-ke-ahi, according to one old Hawaiian, is the
fire goddess Pele's sacred name as controlling fire from the earth. In
Tahiti Pere is called "goddess of the heat of the earth, a blond woman"
(*atua vahine no te vera o te fenua, e vahine 'ehu*). The word *we'a* or
its equivalent *we'o* is applied in Hawaii to a red coloring matter, but
I take the name Kawe'oa to come directly from the Tahitian by elision
*te-ve (r)a-(a te fenu)a*.\[12\] The whole treatment of the Wakea story
here suggests a late handling influenced from Tahiti.\[13\]

The first Hina comes floating to Wakea in the form of a bailing gourd, a
trick familiar in South Sea story but there, so far as I know, always
employed by a male shape-shifter to secure passage in a canoe already
refused him.\[14\] Taken into the canoe the bailer becomes a beautiful
woman, hence called "Hina-the-bailer." When he takes her home and "sets
her by the fire," a euphemism for the sex act, strange sea creatures are
born. Next Hina-kawe'o-a "craves food," and Wakea sets up a row of
images (*ki'i*), conceals himself in one of them, and from this union is
born the same "cock on the back of Wakea" whose birth so radically
upsets the established social order at the close of the eleventh
section. This Hina is the "Underseas-woman" or "Woman-born-below"
(Wahine-lalo-hana\[u\]) of myth, who nibbles the bait from a chief's
fishhooks and is lured to shore by the same trick of the images; to whom
her brother brings the stars and moon for food, or, in another version,
whose family overwhelms the land with a flood to avenge her abduction.

Mythology* pp. 449-51.\]

{p. 124}

It is hardly necessary to repeat that both canoe and "image" (*ki'i*)
are perfectly understood male sex symbols and are to be so understood in
the folk-tale versions here noticed. The word *moa*, "cock," is used for
a high chief, especially in connection with a struggle between competing
aspirants, as witness the famous description of a cock fight in the
chant describing Kamehameha's victorious campaign on the island of
Hawaii.\[15\] Since it is death for an inferior to allow even his shadow
to fall upon the sacred head of a taboo chief, the perch of the cock
upon the ridgepole here means that the son claimed higher rank than that
of his parent. The story seems to point to a union with some family of
high rank, either after the migration to Hawaii or somewhere along the
way, whereby an interloping branch gained the position of ruling stock
on the family line. The name song of Hina's son Maui, born in the shape
of a cock, as told in the chant of the next section, certainly
represents such a struggle for position by one born of an alien strain.
This "seed of the High One begotten in the heavens" shakes heaven and
earth "even to the sacred places."
