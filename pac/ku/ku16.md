# CHAPTER FOURTEEN

#### The Night-Digger

IN THE fifth chant of the Night World, shore life is exchanged for the
cultivation of food plants inland, and the rooting pig is used, on the
one hand, as symbol of the planter who prepares the soil for the food
crop, on the other, as an erotic symbol for the function of the male in
the founding of a new family branch upon the old stock.

According to Kupihea, the "new generation" (*makamaka hou*) of "high
chief rank" (*uli iliuli*) celebrated in the chant is again the Uli line
to which belongs the "pig-child" Kamapua'a whose exploits play so large
a part in popular story telling.\[1\] Half-man, half-god, and born in
the shape of a pig, this ravisher of ladies and superhuman warrior in
battle has left his trace upon many a rock formation, misshapen fragment
of earth, or mountain ravine made sacred by such association. He was by
all odds the favorite figure of local legend throughout the group,
during the last fifty years, in dramatic recital leading to high comedy
that left nothing of detail unsaid.

There is strong probability that Kamapua'a belonged to the cult of Lono,
god of fertility, to whose priesthood the Kumulipo chant seems to have
belonged. Possibly this new branch upon the family line introduced taro
culture.\[2\] Certainly whoever brought the black pig to Hawaii must
have stood good chance of candidacy to godhead. The black pig was the
most sacred sacrifice to be offered to the high gods alone. The feeding
of pork to Cook and his companion climaxed

ff.\]

{p. 81}

the honors paid to the bewildered captain in his apotheosis as god of
fertility. Today a feast of pork is the ultimate word in gustatory
satisfaction, a privilege from which women in old days were excluded
under rigid taboo. The pig is the household favorite. No one who has
picnicked on the black sands of Kalapana can forget the sociable
assembling of sharp-backed "porkers of the night" that nuzzle against
visitors like a brood of privileged puppies.

I am indebted especially to Kupihea for the identification of classes
represented in the births of this period. Kawena Pukui has also
furnished particular clarifications. Bastian saw in the pig birth "a
wave of sensual passion" and, in the series following, the "beginning of
reason and judgment resulting in the development of crafts." Pokini
refers the first half-dozen names to the practice of shaping the head
(*po'o*) by manipulation in infancy to conform to the family branch to
which the child belonged. Thus the head might be elongated
(*po'owa'awa'a*), angular (*po'okihikihi*), square (*po'omahakea*),
round (*po'omeumeu*), with retreating forehead (*po'oapahu*), and so
forth. In the whole series she sees pictured the arrival of a train of
followers of a chief bearing gifts to lay before the first-born child
upon the occasion of his presentation to the family clan.

Pokini's vivid and insistent identification of the scene is by no means
contradictory to Kupihea's more generalized explanation. He attaches to
each name the descriptive term characterizing different classes--social,
occupational, or military--belonging to a chief's followers, carried
over from a time even before that of Kamehameha and it may be much
older. Of four terms naming varieties of taro, two are given to certain
lower classes, one to the chief's favorites, a fourth distinguishes the
lowest slave class. A fifth taro name, *Pi'iali'i*, was locally applied
on Kauai to a class of men who trimmed their hair pompadour and held it
up with a comb of shell. The *Hulupi'i* had kinky hair, cropped to stand
up and colored

with lime. The *Pi'ipi'i* were picked men of Kalani-opu'u's army, said
to stand "seven feet six inches" in height, the same who were caught in
ambush at the battle of the sandhills at the time of the invasion of
Maui from Hawaii. "They wore small helmets and short capes and were
great fighters." The *Huelo-maewa* ("Wagging-tails") were "dogs turned
human beings," a class of shape-shifters belonging primarily to the
island of Maui. The *Hululiha*, also called *Hulumanu*, were "retainers
of the king who fought with him," hence a kind of bodyguard.

The ode concludes with a paean of praise for the blossoming period of
the virgin land under the hand of the ancient planter of taro-patch
(*lo'i*) fame, Lo'iloa. The "walling up at the back" and "in front" in
an earlier line, Pokini referred to old methods of potato planting.\[3\]
The word *mohala* here applied to the land "is often used in the best
poetry for the time of maturity in the virgin"; hence it is here applied
to the flowering period of land made productive through cultivation.
*Oma* is a name for a chief's leading official, here assigned to the
Night-digger, Po-kanokano. Under this symbol of the fruitful earth lies
the inner theme or kaona, picturing the rise of a fertile new branch on
the family line multiplying over the land.

The time arrives for Po-kanokano  
To increase the progeny of Po-lalo-uli  
Dark is the skin of the new generation  
Black is the skin of the beloved Po-lalo-uli

The beaked nose that digs the earth is erected  
Let it dig at the land, increase it, heap it up  
Walling it up at the back  
Walling it up in front

Lodges inland in the bush

Long is the line of his ancestry  
The ancient line of the pig of chief blood  
The pig of highest rank born in the time  
The time when the Night-digger lived

The night gave birth

Born were the blonds, their skin was white  
Born were those with retreating foreheads, they were bushy haired

Born were the big bellies, big eaters were they

Born were the family men, they were home lovers

Born were the lousy-headed, they were lice infested  
Born were the war leaders, men followed after them  
Born were the high chiefs, they were ruddy  
Born were the stragglers, they were dispersed

The children of Lo'iloa multiplied

The virgin land sprang into bloom  
The gourd of desire was loosened  
With desire to extend the family line

The generations from the Night-digger  
In that period of the past  
    Still it is night
