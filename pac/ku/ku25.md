# CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE

### The Dedication

THE genealogy of the sixteenth section opens with the names of Maui and
his wife Hina-of-the-love-mole, possibly the same who is called
Mahana-ulu-'ehu in the song of Maui's fishing. The pairs, man and wife,
continue down the line of high chiefs well known to tradition, who ruled
successively on the island of Maui, to the famous name of Pi'ilani,
whose daughter Pi'ikea became one of the wives of 'Umi, ruling chief on
Hawaii. From a son of this union the powerful 'I family of Hilo district
counted descent, and by a daughter of the 'I family there was born to
Keawe the Lono-i-ka-makahiki to whom the Kumulipo chant was allegedly
dedicated. The closing lines of the chant are hence devoted to the
detailing of Pi'ikea's ancestry and the aggrandizement of her immediate
posterity.

No more famous family in Hawaiian annals could a girl claim as her own
than that of Pi'ilani, who succeeded to his father's lands as ruling
chief on the eastern end of the island of Maui. His wife was daughter of
a high taboo chief of Oahu by his father's sister Kelea, a girl whose
dexterity in surfing won her the sobriquet of "fin-bearing" and whose
romantic adventures were a favorite theme of courtly song and
story.\[1\] Abducted while engaged in her favorite sport and carried
away to the island of Oahu by an inland chief of inferior rank, Kelea
wearied of life in the uplands and, leaving home to indulge her passion
for surfing, was seen and taken to wife by the high chief of Ewa
district. To him she bore the daughter La'ielohelohe, and the girl was

{p. 138}

brought up in strict seclusion as a sacred child. In time messengers
came from Maui to ask for her in marriage to the son of her mother's
brother. Again the court romancers found a theme to their liking in the
ceremonies attending this wooing embassy. To Pi'ilani, La'ie bore the
daughter Pi'ikea who became 'Umi's wife. Their grandchild obtained the
rank of *wohi* with the right to the crouching taboo. The right claimed
for his descendant 'I to offer human sacrifice and to cut down *'ohi'a*
wood for images would imply that as ruling chief over the land section
of Pakini, lying in Ka-'u district, he was entitled to erect a war
*heiau*, a right denied to lesser chiefs.

Other famous names appear on this genealogy, some no less well known to
Hawaiian romance than to that of southern groups, from which source they
may well have been brought. One such noted cycle, intrenched at the east
end of the island of Maui, is headed by Ai-kanaka and the stranger wife
who fled back to the moon.\[2\] At line 2070 are born the sons of Palena
and his wife Hikawainui, Hanala'a the great and Little Hanala'a, from
whom important family lines branch on Hawaiian genealogies. The whole
section may well have been added in Kalakaua's day to bring the chant up
to date with his own family claim, but variations in the names prove an
independent source from the Fornander genealogies of a slightly earlier
period.\[3\]
