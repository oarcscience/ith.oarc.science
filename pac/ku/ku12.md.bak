# CHAPTER TEN

#### Birth of Sea and Land Life

THE Prologue for the first section, if read literally, seems to picture
the rising of land out of the fathomless depths of ocean. Along its
shores the lower forms of life begin to gather, and these are arranged
as births from parent to child. Poepoe calls this a device "used by the
composer of the chant in order to get a source of reproduction as we see
it in life," that is, he does not expect the poet to be taken literally.
He writes:

Kumulipo was the husband, Po'ele the wife. To them was born Pouliuli.
This was the beginning of the earth. The coral was the first stone in
the foundation of the earth mentioned in the chant. It was the insect
that made the coral and all things in the sea. This was the beginning of
the period called the first interval of time. During this time grew the
coral, the shellfish (such as the sea cucumber, the small sea urchin,
the flat sea urchin, tiny mussels, the oysterlike mussels, the mussels
of the sea, the clam, the barnacle, the dark sea snail, the cowry, and
so forth). In this interval of time grew the moss and the little plants
on land. It was still dark. The water was made to be a nest that gave
birth and bore all things in the womb of the deep.

Poepoe knows that the coral polyp builds up the coral and that the
shellfish makes its own shell--"it was an insect that made the coral and
all things," says Poepoe, But was this known to the poet? The selection
of hard-coated creatures as the first forms of life on earth harmonizes
with the idea of reproductive power inherent in a stone into which a god
enters, an idea fundamental to Polynesian thought about the structure of
the world. According to a Tahitian chant of

{p. 56}

creation, the building-up of land during the "chaotic period" is due to
"affinity" between rocks of opposite character that "meet and unite."'
Pairs of rocks suggesting in shape male and female sex organs were
worshipped as ancestral gods in old Hawaii, and fertility fish gods in
the shape of stones occur in pairs in old fishponds. Even today the
popular belief lingers. "Where else did all the stones come from?" asked
a child from a well-educated family; and he brought me a box of
so-called "breeding stones," which he assured me would produce young.
But his elders must have interfered; the box disappeared before the test
was completed.\[2\]

Following a series of stanzas pairing land and sea forms comes a
ten-line epilogue, carrying on the idea of a world in its first stages
of fecundity, stimulated to growth by the generative powers at work
during this embryo period of its history. Soft-bodied shellfish have
emerged out of the hard bed of ocean; along the just-risen shore line,
sea plants float in the wash of the waves; delicate land growths stand
rooted in the soil, their slender bodies swaying with the currents of
air. The birth of the climbing pandanus vine, worshiped as a god of
forest growth because of its spike of red at the fruiting point, symbol
of fertility, leads directly to the advent of "the man with the water
gourd," who is "Kane of the generative water," Kane-i-ka-wai-ola,
represented, says Kupihea, in gushing spring water.

"The man with the water gourd, that is a god," begins the passage, and
there follows the softening-up of earth and the increase of plant
growth. The withering vine (*kalina*) is revivified (*ho'oulu*).
Propagation (*ka huli*) causes growth (*ho'oka\[u\]wowo*). Rootlets
(*paia\['a\]*) carry water to bathe and soften the developing tuber.
Earth is pregnant (*piha*) with growth. Earth props up the sky, or, as
Kupihea would read the symbol, commoners (*honua*) serve as staff
(*ko'o*)

\[1. Henry, p. 340.

2\. Beckwith, *Hawaiian Mythology*, pp. 88-90.\]

{p. 57}

to support (*pa'a*) the chiefs (*lani*). May not the familiar Polynesian
myth of the sky pushed apart from earth to let in the light of day,
often forced upward upon the leaves of a growing plant, refer similarly
in a figure to the rise of the chief class in distinction from that of
the commoners? The whole passage, thinks Kupihea, here refers, not to
the spread of vegetation but to the multiplication of a people through
the procreative function symbolized in the "man with the water gourd,"
Kane-i-ka-wai-ola.

The concluding line, "O lewa ke an, ia Kumulipo ka po," with the
reiterated "Po--no" ("Still it is night"), serves to balance the
preceding "O he'e an loloa ka po," where the word *he'e*, I think,
refers rather to the waving, twisting motion of sea growths, "sliding"
(*he'e*) about through the water and of land plants swaying in the
currents of air than to the squid in particular or to sliding sports,
both of which derived ideas have obsessed translators of this passage.
The word *au*, carried over in the first instance from the *auau* of the
line before, may refer to a period of "time" in this unfolding world of
the *po*, perhaps to its "length" (*loloa*) in the first instance, to
Kumulipo as its generative agent in the second. At least, any
translation I have seen of this passage has been so incredibly hopeless
that an attempt to do justice to the poet's conception will not, I
trust, be taken as an indignity to native genius.

Pokini Robinson sees, I think quite justly, in this image of an infant
world with creatures floating in the wash of the waves or swayed by
currents of air a symbol of the uncertain movements of the young child
whose development she considers to be the subject of the whole chant.
The rootlets (*paia\['a\]*) bathing the manawa she would refer to the
veins carrying nourishment to the child through the fontanel (*manawa*)
from which the unborn child is supposed to receive food from the parent
and may still draw nourishment after birth if the mother's milk fails.
