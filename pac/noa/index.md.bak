When I was studying ethnography at UCLA, the instructors spent a lot of
time drumming into us the necessity of being a detached observer. "Going
native" was considered the ultimate slur against a fellow
anthropologist. And yet, some of the best information that we have about
some societies comes from travelers who have "gone native" in a big way.
Case in point, the French artist Paul Gauguin, and his luminous
description of a season in Tahiti in 1891.

This slight travelogue of an artists' journey into the heart of the
primitive both enthralls and informs. Written as a potboiler after he
returned to France, there are two distinct parts of this book. The first
part is an extended narrative of Gauguin's entry into the slow rhythms
of Polynesian village life. [Late in the book](noa01.htm#page_92.md) we hit
folklore paydirt. In an extended passage, Gauguin's Tahitian
child-concubine relates to him the Tahitian cosmogony, with a number of
myths, legendary genealogies, ethnoastronomy, and a deluge story.
Gauguin remarks on how advanced the Polynesian lore seems, particularly
their belief in evolutionary processes and knowledge of the spherical
nature of the Earth. This is consistent with the Hawaiian
[Kumulipo](../ku/index.md). While not a scholarly dissertation by any
means, this portion is a well written discussion of Tahitian beliefs.

The book ends with Gauguin sailing back to France. As foreshadowed here,
he returned to the South seas. He died and was buried in the Marquesas
in 1903.

This text is also available in the French original from [Project
Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11646.md). Because the book has
no chapter divisions and is comparatively small (140Kb) it has been
posted as one big file.
