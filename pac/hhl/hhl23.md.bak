# FIRST HAWAIIAN PRINTING

FOREIGNERS from all over the world called on the Hawaiians and remained
with them forty years before the missionaries came. Their influence was
negative. They did not study the people or help them to study. John
Young, Don Marin and Isaac Davis were notable exceptions in a few
things, but the fact remains that no earnest effort was made by any one
to help the natives intellectually until the missionaries came.

Alexander Campbell, who, in 1809, was left in Honolulu by a whaling ship
on account of frozen feet, revealed the situation. The king Tamaahmaah
(Ka-meha-meha) ordered Boyd, his carpenter, to make a loom for Campbell
to use in weaving cloth for sails. Boyd declined, saying, "The natives
should be taught nothing that would render them independent of
strangers."

Campbell places on record the feeling among the foreigners. "When a
brother of the Queen's, whose name I do not remember--but who was
usually called by the white people John Adams--wished me to teach him to
read, Davis would not permit

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

me, observing, 'They will soon know more than ourselves.'" It is
interesting to note that Gov. Adams, whose native name was Kuakini, did
learn to read and write under the missionaries and has left two short
letters, in both of which he presents a request for saws.

In one he says, "My wife is going away to Hawaii. If perhaps she can
carry, give you to me sahs tools," signed "Gov. Adams." In the other
letter he says he is building a house and wants a "sah tool" which he
will return when the work is done.

The missionaries landed at Kailua on the island Hawaii, April 4, 1820,
and there divided their party, the larger number coming to "Hanaroorah,
Honolulu, April 19."

Mr. Bingham says, "They began at once to teach.--The first pupils were
the chiefs and their favourite attendants and the wives and children of
foreigners." The first instruction was necessarily in English, but the
missionaries used every opportunity to become acquainted with the speech
of the people and make it a written language. They wrote down as
carefully as they could every new word which came to their ears. This
was no small task and was absolutely necessary as the foundation of a
written language.

As soon as the missionaries were sure of the orthography and
pronunciation of a number of words they prepared a primer or spelling
book to be

printed for the schools they were carrying on. Mr. Bingham says : "On
the 7th of January, 1822, we commenced printing the language in order to
give them letters, libraries and the living oracles in their own tongue.
A considerable number was present, and among those particularly
interested was Ke-au-moku (Gov. Cox) who after a little instruction by
Mr. Loomis applied the strength of his athletic arm to the lever of a
Ramage press, pleased thus to assist in working off a few impressions of
the first lessons."

Although these impressions were merely proof sheets, probably, of the
first half of the spelling book, yet the large number printed and put in
use, nearly 100 in all, would make this the first item printed.

This was the first printing done in the Hawaiian islands and along the
North Pacific coast west of the Rocky Mountains. These first sheets
created a new interest among the chiefs. King Liho-liho (Ka-meha-meha
II) visited the press, saw a sheet of clean white paper laid over the
type, then "pulled the lever around and was surprised to see the paper
instantly covered with words in his own language."

While the chiefs were awakened by these proof impressions to
intellectual desires never before experienced, the work was being pushed
of finishing the second "signature" and the complete book of sixteen
pages was printed in an edition of 500 copies. Gov. Adams (Kuakini)
secured one of the

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

first copies of these lessons "and was quickly master of them."

Liho-liho was glad to have the chiefs instructed and took 100 copies of
the first primer for his friends and attendants. Ka-ahu-manu took 40 for
her friends. These probably came from this printing of 500 copies. In
the latter part of September, another printing of 2,000 copies was made
from the same type.

Liho-liho felt a little like the foreigners who did not want the natives
instructed. He wanted the education reserved for the chiefs because,
according to Mr. Bingham, "he would not have the instruction of the
people in general come in the way of their cutting sandalwood to pay his
debts."

Nevertheless, the flood could not be held back and the privilege of
reading and writing rapidly spread among the people. In six years there
was the record--

"Oahu: Mission Press, Nov. 1828; 5 Ed.; 20,000. Total, 120,000."

Meanwhile a great deal of other printed matter had been issued from that
first press.

March 9, 1822, at the request of the king and high chiefs a handbill,
entitled, "Port Regulations," was printed, probably to aid the rulers in
quieting the differences which were continually arising with sea
captains. The fourth item recorded as issued in these islands was in
December, 1823, and is the very rare and unique little book of 60 pages
of

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Hawaiian hymns prepared by Rev. Hiram Bingham
and Rev. William Ellis, an English missionary from Tahiti who resided in
Honolulu at the time, heartily allying himself with the American
missionaries. His previous knowledge of the similar language of Tahiti
made it easy for him to learn Hawaiian. The edition of this hymn book
was 2,000 copies.

The most interesting part of the story of printing in the Hawaiian
Islands belongs to the greatest work accomplished for the good of the
people--the printing of the Bible in the Hawaiian language. This article
has space for only a few facts. The first printed Bible passage was in a
revised spelling book published April, 1825. This was John 3, 16-21.
Then in June, 1825, a booklet, 4 pages, called--"He olelo a ke Akua," or
"Selected Scriptures," was probably printed on the same demy with "He
ui," or "A catechism," 8 pages--each 7,000 copies. In November, 1825,
the hundredth Psalm was "printed on a card for the opening of the church
built by Ka-lai-moku at Honolulu," then in December, 1825, the Ten
Commandments and the Lord's Prayer; in July, 1826, the Good Samaritan,
and in January, 1827, the Sermon on the Mount.

In December, 1827, came the first systematic attempt toward printing the
Bible. Twelve pages of the Gospel of Luke were struck off--10,700
copies. Later the entire book of Luke was printed in Honolulu.

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The other gospels, Matthew, Mark and John, were
printed in 1828 in the United States. A copy of these three gospels,
bound in an elegant and substantial cover, was presented to Ka-pio-lani,
the high chiefess who defied Pele on the brink of the pit-crater of
Kilauea in 1825. This volume now lies in the archives of the Hawaiian
Board. The entire Bible was completed and "the finishing sheet was
struck off May 10, 1839."

An interesting prophecy concerning the completion of the Bible is found
in a writing book, where, under the date April 30, 1827, is the record
of a conversation. Mr. Bingham says that it is the duty of the mission
to complete a translation of the Bible in five years from this time and
thinks that with circumstances as favourable as they now are it will be
done.

Mr. Whitney says: "I say if the whole Bible is in print in the Hawaiian
language in ten years from this time it is as much as I expect, and I
think will be a progress exceeding that of any other mission to any
heathen country having a language not previously written or reduced to
order." It was a little over twelve years after the first pages were
prepared before the complete Bible was in print.
