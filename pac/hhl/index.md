# HAWAIIAN HISTORICAL LEGENDS

## By William D. Westervelt

#### \[1923, copyright not renewed\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the last of Westervelt's six books of Hawaiian lore. Starting in
mythological times, and retelling some of the migration legends, the
book primarily focuses on the period of European contact, Hawaiian
Historical Legends is of interest for anyone studying encounters between
cultures, particularly where one of the cultures has a technological
advantage. The core of the book is set against the background of
consolidation of political authority in the islands (which was already
underway before contact), the fall of the old tapu-bound absolute rule
of the chiefs and the priests, and finally the emergence of modern
Hawaiian civil culture. Of particular interest are Westervelt's
speculations on early contacts, not only between the Hawaiians and the
Europeans, but other Pacific rim cultures such as the Chinese, Japanese
and Native Americans.
