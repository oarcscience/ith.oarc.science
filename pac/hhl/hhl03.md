# PREFACE

FROM mist to sunshine--from fabled gods to a constitution and
legislature as a Territory of the United States--this is the outline of
the stories told in the present volume. This outline is thoroughly
Hawaiian in the method of presentation. The old people rehearsed stories
depending upon stories told before. They cared very little for dates.
This is a book of stories related to each other.

Veiled by the fogs of imagination are many interesting facts concerning
kings and chiefs which have been passed over untouched--such as the
voyages of the vikings of the Pacific, who left names and legends around
the islands. For in-stance, Hilo, in the island of Hawaii, is named
after Whiro, a noted viking who sailed through many island groups with
his brother, Punga, after whom the district of Puna is named.
Ka-kuhi-hewa, ruler of Oahu, was the King Arthur of the Hawaiians, with
a band of noted chiefs around his poi-bowl. Umi was a remarkable king of
the island Hawaii. Many individual incidents of these persons are yet to
be related.

The Hawaiian language papers since 1835, Fornander's Polynesian
Researches, and many of the old Hawaiians have been of great assistance
in searching for these "fragments of Hawaiian history," now set forth in
this book.
