# THE WHARE-WANANGA <span class="small">OR HOUSE OF TEACHING OR LEARNING; THE MAORI COLLEGE.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## CHAPTER I.

> <span class="small">Introduction—The ancient houses of teaching—The
> Whare-wānanga, and its methods—The Pō, or ages, or æons of

\[T<span class="small">HE</span> following is the teaching of Moihi Te
Matorohanga (who will be referred to in the future as 'the Sage'), of
Wai-rarapa, East Coast of New Zealand, on the subject of the Maori
College, in which the young lads who shewed a disposition towards
learning, and had been observed to be accomplished in telling stories,
etc., were taught by the old Priests (or *Tohungas*) all that tended
towards making them accomplished in the higher knowledge that was
necessary to the chiefs and priests.

   This teaching was divided into two branches as follows:—

1\. Te Kauwae-runga       2. Te Kauwae-raro

(the simple translation of which is, the upper-jaw, and the lower-jaw).
These branches were also sometimes designated, Te Kauhanga-runga, and Te
Kauhanga-raro.<span id="page_79_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_79_note_*.md) The
expressions had a clear meaning to the Maoris, the first representing
everything pertaining to the gods, the heavens, the origin of all
things, the creation of man, the science of astronomy, and the record of
time, etc. The second (Te Kauwae-raro) deals with the history, properly
so called, of the people, their genealogies, migrations, the *tapu*, and
all knowledge pertaining to terrestrial matters. We may thus say that
the first represents 'Celestial things,' the second 'Terrestrial
things'; though, as will be seen, the distinction is not always adhered
to.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

   In order to a clear understanding of the Sage's teaching in reference
to the Whare-wānanga, it is necessary to know a good deal of his other
teachings—which follows after this chapter—on the Kauwae-runga. So far
as possible the notes will aid in this.

   The meaning of the words Whare-wānanga is somewhat difficult to
express shortly in English; but probably the nearest meaning is, the
'house of learning,' or 'house of teaching,' with the understanding that
the higher learning is meant—in some cases esoteric learning. Whare, of
course, is a house, a building.<span
id="page_80_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_80_note_*.md) *Wānanga*, means the
higher and sacred knowledge, and to recite that knowledge—it is, in
fact, very similar to the meaning of *Veda* in the Sanskrit, as used in
the name of the Hindu sacred books, the Rig-veda-Samhita.<span
id="page_80_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_80_note_dagger.md)

   In some parts the Whare-wānanga is called Whare-kura (where *Kura*
has the same meaning as wānanga) and Whare-maire. But it will be seen
later on that the Sage makes a considerable distinction between the
first and the last, and rarely mentions the second, though that name is
well-known to many tribes; and the late Mr. John White in his "Ancient
History of the Maori," Vol. I., has described the Maori College under
the name of Whare-kura.

   The Whare-wānanga was an extremely sacred institution, as will be
seen by the Sage's description. Some of the tribes have preserved the
principal names of these institutions right away from the original
Fatherland—indeed, even from the Heavens themselves—down to their
extinction in the middle of the nineteenth century. The Sage gives the
following succession of houses used by his ancestors; but it does not
profess to be a perfect list—only the more important being mentioned:—

<td>Mattangi-reia. This was the original of all the Whare-wānanga, and the pattern from which subsequent ones were built, and from whence came all knowledge, brought from the twelfth heaven—Te Toi-o-nga-rangi—by the god Tāne-matua; this was the temple of the Supreme God Io. It is said to have been situated in the Sun's path in the heavens, the name itself having that meaning.</td>

<td>Rangi-atea. This was another temple in the twelfth heaven, where were deposited the <em>whatu-kura</em> on the <em>Ahu-rewa</em>, or altar, the <em>whatu-kura</em> being the sacred stones connected with the teaching, and were in charge of the male and female guardian spirits (Whata-kura and Marei-kura<span id="page_81_fr_*"></span><a href="#page_81_note_*">*</a>) at that part of the twelfth heaven which was the <em>marae</em>, or court yard, or plaza of Rangiatea, named Rau-roha. Rauroha means a wide space, as of the heavens. Rangi-atea, describes the complete absence of cloud in the skies. The Sage declared this to be "the teaching of the Whare-wānanga, and must not be questioned."</td>

<td>Tawhiri-rangi. This was the temple—not necessarily a Whare-wānanga—in which the spirits of mankind, who were deemed worthy to ascend to the presence of Io, the Supreme God in the twelfth heaven, were purified before their admittance into that heaven. It was situated in the first heaven, below the summit (probably), the entrance to which, was named Pu-motomoto, and opened downward into space. The door of departure of the spirits upwards to Io from this heaven was named Uru-rangi. [Entering-heaven.]</td>

<tr class="odd">

<td>Whakamoe-ariki, was a sacred house (probably) in the twelfth heaven, where dwelt the minor gods, Rua-tau, Aitu-pawa, Rehua, and the spiritual beings named Te Tini-o-Pono-aua (the Pono-aua tribe), who were the servants of the Apas, or messengers of the gods.<span id="page_81_fr_dagger"></span><a href="#page_81_note_dagger">†</a> The three first named were the guardians of the heavenly treasures, and, from their association with Io, the Supreme God, were considered to rank above the other gods.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td data-valign="TOP">   5.</td>
<td>Whare-kura, was a temple situated in Rangi-tamaku, or the first above the lowest heaven (according to one description), and which served as the prototype of the terrestrial temples; from it succeeding temples took their generic name of Whare-kura. In this place were suspended the (emblems of the) teaching of Tāne, together with the <em>whatu</em> or sacred stones brought down by him from the twelfth heaven. The <span id="page_82">p. 82</span> teacher in this house was Uru-te-ngangana (also Nuku-te-aio and Rua-i-te-pukenga).<br />
   [In another place, the Sage states that the second temple named Whare-kura was situated "at Te Hono-i-wairua (the gathering place of spirits) at Tawhiti-pa-mamao (the Fatherland) in the spot where the teaching of the Whare-wānanga originated," (i.e., where man was first taught the doctrines brought down from Heaven by Tāne) "and where were created the land, the great ocean, the forests; the plants of the land, the fish of the sea, according to their kinds, the birds of each kind, the reptiles whether of the land or the sea, and over which temple presided the ancestor Uru-te-ngangana" (who was one of the gods).] It rather seems as if some confusion exists as to whether or not there were two temples of this name.</td>

   It was in these temples, colleges, or houses of learning, that the
priests of old taught the young men of their particular tribes, with the
constant admonition never to depart from what they learned, nor to allow
other subjects than those taught by the tribal priests to be introduced
into the colleges. The Sage states that youths from other tribes might
be taught therein; in which probability he means the series of tribes of
the East Coast who all, more or less, are related to the descendants of
the crew of the "Takitimu" canoe that came here about 1350, and also to
the original *tangata-whenua* people, about whom we shall learn later.
It would seem from the difference in the teachings found in other tribes
that this is so.

   It is to be noted that all the teachings of the Sage on the subject
of the Whare-wānanga are here brought under one heading in the
translation, though the sources of the information are to be found
scattered through his various teachings (in Maori) in other parts which
will follow this. We may now leave the Sage to tell his own story. He
died in 1884, aged about eighty years.\]

 

IN February, 1865, Rei, addressing Te Matorohanga said, "O Moi Explain
to us about the Whare-wānanga and its teachings." The Sage replied,
"What of the Whare-wānanga indeed! It is similar to the \[teaching of
the modern\] church; do not we wash ourselves in the pots used for
cooking \[nowadays\]?"<span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1.md)

   Attention! O Sirs! Listen!: There was no one universal system of
teaching in the Whare-wānanga. Each tribe has its own priests, its own
college, and its own methods. From tribe to tribe this was so the
teaching was diverted from the true teaching by the self-conceit of the
priests which allowed of departure from their own doctrines to those of
other Whare-wānanga. My word to you is: Hold steadfastly to our
teaching: leave out of consideration that of other \[tribes\]. Let their
descendants adhere to their teaching, and you to ours; so that if you
err, it was we \[your relatives\] who declared it unto you \[and you are
not responsible\]; and if you are in the right, it is we who shall leave
to you this valuable property \[and should have the credit thereof\].
The omissions in our discourse, you will be able to adjust, whether it
be of the foundations of knowledge or that which proceeds from it. The
omissions in my teaching, or innovations, the variations, the
interruptions, or divergence from the main argument or <span
id="page_85">p. 85</span> true story, Paratene Te Okawhare<span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2.md) and Nepia Pohuhu<span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3.md) will be able to supply. Their teaching is
the same \[as mine\]—one of them can adjust this. My wish was, if Te Ura
had consented, there should have been only one house of teaching for all
of us together; in that case there would have been no trouble, for one
of us would have laid down the main line of teaching \[and discourse
thereon\], whilst two would have listened in case of any divergence, and
one of them would supplement it, or in case of the 'solution of
continuity' the other would cause the discourse to flow again,<span
id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4.md) and to become reaffixed to the root of the
subject, or supply any emissions. It was thus in the Whare-wānanga—not
less than three teachers took part, not counting the many other
*tohungas* (or priests) present. In this way all went properly. The
*tauira* (or pupils)<span id="fr_5"></span>[5](#note_5.md) are not here
considered, for unto them was poured out the properties (teaching) in
the basket-of-knowledge.<span id="fr_6"></span>[6](#note_6.md) Their
business was to listen, and to firmly fix in their hearts, in their very
roots and origins, all they are taught, with also the strong desire to
retain it all.

   The Whare-wānanga is for use by those young men who are considered by
their tribe to be suitable for learning; who are intelligent and alert,
and display perseverance in learning what is taught them. It is those
\[alone\] who are allowed to enter the Whare-wānanga. They have to
undergo a preliminary teaching amongst their own tribe before entering.
The house of teaching is for such cases, and for all tribes—not for a
single tribe or for one or two only.

   Now, in constructing the Whare-wānanga let the site be outside the
palisaded *pa*, and away from the village, or the food-cultivations, or
the bird-preserves, or canoe-landing places, or distant from paths where
men pass. This was done because the Whare-wānanga was a *whare-tapu*—a
sacred house—and the sacredness extended to the *ahurewa*, or altar, the
*marae*, or court, and the latrines; together with all those who took
part in teaching and learning—all were extremely *tapu*. In case <span
id="page_86">p. 86</span> the dedication *karakias* \[prayers,
incantations, etc.\] only covered as far as the *paepae-awha*,<span
id="fr_7"></span>[7](#note_7.md) it would not render the house sufficiently
*tapu*; a house trodden by the feet of \[ordinary\] men \[in such case\]
would not have sufficient *măna* \[prestige, power, etc.\]. Nothing that
took place within the house during the teaching might be disclosed—it
was sacred. The whole of the *marae* is *tapu*, as well as all belonging
to a properly constituted Whare-wānanga.

   The sleeping houses, cooking houses, store houses of every kind
together with the cooks must all be outside the sacred *marae*; and only
those who are officiating in the Whare-wānanga (or Whare-maire, as some
call it) may enter therein. No one from outside may enter either the
*marae* or the house, lest they be stricken with *mumutu*<span
id="fr_8"></span>[8](#note_8) (or as some call it *take-whenua*.md). No
woman who has cohabited with a man may cook food for the staff, or even
enter the *marae*; the reason being that she has a bloody flux \[and is
hence impure\].<span id="fr_9"></span>[9](#note_9.md)

   The following is the course adopted in the construction of the
Whare-wānanga: The foundation of the house must be carefully cleared and
swept. This done, a commencement is made with the *pou-tua-rongo*, or
rearmost pillar, then the *pou-toko-manawa*, or central pillar, and
lastly the pillar by the door. These three pillars are kept to their
proper height by the *aho-tatai*, or cord stretched from rear to front;
the rear pillar is four fingers breadth lower than the centre one, and
the latter the same below the top of the front pillar. It is the same
with the floor of the house, the rear must be four fingers breadth below
the front \[and, adds the Scribe, the width of the building must be four
fingers breadth greater in front than in rear, and the opening of the
doorway four fingers wider on the inside of the jambs than outside. This
is supposed to allow smoke to escape, and the dimensions have been
decided on from experience. All measurements are always made inside the
house. For particulars of an ordinary Maori house see 'Journal
Polynesian Society,' Vol. V., p. 145, and they do not differ much from a
Whare-wānanga, which averaged about forty feet long by twenty feet wide,
and fifteen to twenty feet high\].

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

   In the process of building, before placing the rearmost pillars in
the ground, there are deposited in the hole three *whatus*,<span
id="fr_10"></span>[10](#note_10.md) of which Rakai-ora \[emblematical for a
green lizard\] is the first; or if none are at hand, then the 'son of
Pekerau,' a *tuatara*.<span id="fr_11"></span>[11](#note_11.md) If that
could not be procured, the 'son of Arawaru,'<span
id="fr_12"></span>[12](#note_12.md) the *karearea* \[or sparrow-hawk\] was
used \[all these things have to be collected before the home is started,
otherwise it would be a *whare-aitua*, or house of ill omen—says the
Scribe\]. Before placing them the whole, the three *whatus* were brought
in a *kete* (basket), and a mat laid down in the middle of the
*kauwhanga*, or passage down the centre of the house, when the second
priest seized the *tuatara*, and the third priest placed them on the
mat. After this the last priest repeated a *karakia*, or prayer, to
*whakanoho*, or place the *whatus* in position on the mat. Two of the
*whatus* are then placed in the hole, the *karearea* remaining. The
green lizard and the *tuatara* having been buried, the post is placed in
position, and when it is upright, the 'son of Arawaru' \[see [note
twelve](#note_12.md)\] is put by the first priest on top of the rearmost
pillar, between it and the ridge pole. He <span id="page_88">p.
88</span> then commences his *karakia*, whilst all pull out a few hairs
from their top-knots and place them on top of the *karearea*. The priest
who has placed the *whatus*, then fills in the first of the earth, and
after that other priests proceed with the work of building the house, by
starting at the right hand comer of the walls. This concludes the
ceremonious part connected with the building of the house.

   After the house is finished it is closed. Let me explain this
further: At daylight the digging of the holes for the three pillars is
started, with the ceremonies already described. When the three pillars
have been firmly rammed, the ridge pole is placed in position; all must
be finished before the sun rises above the horizon; after that the other
work goes on. No woman is allowed in any part of this building \[whilst
it is building, or at any other time\]. The day before the opening of
the house, the priests alone are allowed within, in order to consecrate
it, and to place some small *whatus*, or stones \[see [note
forty-one](#note_41.md)\], at the rearmost pillar; these stones are to be
fed to the pupils who are to be taught the *wānanga* (or syllabus). This
part of the house is called the Ahurewa or (most) sacred spot or
altar.<span id="fr_13"></span>[13](#note_13.md) Let this be quite clear:
The *tuāhu* (or ordinary altar) is outside—not in the house. There are
two (proper) sites for the *tuāhu*, one near the latrine,<span
id="fr_14"></span>[14](#note_14.md) one by side of a tomb—those are the
only proper sites. The reason of this is lest (the *tuāhus*) should be
desecrated by the approach of food, or by food being suspended near
them.<span id="fr_15"></span>[15](#note_15.md) I have heard of *tuāhus*
being placed in other spots. This is correct; but in that case they are
used only for the *uruuru-tapu* \[where witchcraft is taught, or where
the umbilical cord, and hair when cut, is deposited\], or as places
where offerings are made to the gods, purification after touching a dead
body, or removal of the *tapu* from anyone, etc.

   In case the two stones mentioned above cannot be procured \[or in
<span id="page_89">p. 89</span> some other cases\] eleven stones<span
id="fr_16"></span>[16](#note_16.md) of *huka-a-tai*,<span
id="fr_17"></span>[17](#note_17.md) or of *rehu*, are substituted and four
are placed on each side of the Ahurewa, and three at the *takuahi*, or
fireplace of the house.<span id="fr_18"></span>[18](#note_18.md) The reason
they are so placed is that these stones are common ones, carefully sunk
in the ground as seats for the pupils when the College is opened, and
then the priests recite their *karakias* from those stones at the
*takuahi* \[fireplace\], or from the *kauwhanga* or passage of the
house. The eight stones near the rearmost pillar, are used when the
college breaks up in the month of Tapere-wai (September), and the
session ends. The three stones at the *takuahi* are called 'Te
Rongo-taketake<span id="fr_19"></span>[19](#note_19.md) of Rongo-marae-roa'
\[or the abiding-place-of-Rongo-marae-roa—god of all cultivated foods\],
and the eight stones are called 'Nga-whatu-matāki.'

   \[Just before the final ceremony of 'breaking up' (I am informed by
the Scribe) the pupils were told to stand on the mat, already referred
to which was placed; just in front of the Ahurewa, or altar, under which
mat the Whatu-kura (or Stones of Knowledge) were placed; and then all
the priests gathered round them and placed their hands on the pupils
heads, at the same time repeating an invocation to <span id="page_90">p.
90</span> ensure the permanence of what the pupils had learned. The
Whatu-kura were sacred stones, and the Sage says in another place that
they were white, or, failing them, sometimes of basalt of a reddish
brownish color.\] That is all about these stones.

   On the closing of the College, those taught by the priests were taken
to the *paepae*, or bar, of the *turuma*, or latrine of the precincts,
to remove from them the state of *tapu* induced by their sojourn in the
College; and there the pupils bit the *paepae*, or bar.<span
id="fr_20"></span>[20](#note_20.md) After this all proceeded forth from the
*marae* in a state of nudity; their usual clothes were deposited in the
houses outside the *marae*. The clothes worn whilst in the Whare-wānanga
were returned to that building by the priests \[and deposited at the
Ahurewa, or altar\].<span id="fr_21"></span>[21](#note_21.md) This course
was pursued every day whilst the teaching lasted. On the day of final
departure from the precincts of the sacred *marae*, the priests took
from the pupils a lock of their hair, the dirt of the feet, the spital,
the perspiration from under the arms or between the thighs, and carried
them to the rearmost pillar of the house and their buried them. All of
this was done for fear that any such parts should be used in bewitching,
or be a means by which the pupils were made to disclose any of the
teachings they had acquired.<span id="fr_22"></span>[22](#note_22.md) After
all this the pupils were taken to the water and ducked therein \[as a
cleansing from the *tapu*; there was near every village a *wai-tapu*, or
sacred water, used in many ceremonies\].

   But before the final departure of the classes from the sacred *marae*
of the Whare-wānanga, they all stood in rank within the veranda (or
porch) of the house, facing outwards. The door and the window<span
id="fr_23"></span>[23](#note_23.md) were both closed; and the pupils were
confined by the *paepae-awha* <span id="page_91">p. 91</span> \[see
[note 7](#note_7.md)\], or threshold of the porch, whilst the priests stood
in the *marae* in order to address the pupils, the speeches being made
by two of them. The addresses were, firstly, in the nature of
commendation for good behaviour; secondly, exhortations to be careful
how they carried themselves, and to guard what they had been taught;
thirdly, a statement of the month in which they should return \[to
complete their courses\]. This ended they marched, the priests leading,
to the bounds of the *marae*, where they stood facing the direction of
the door of the house; and then one of the priests taking a
*kaunoti*<span id="fr_24"></span>[24](#note_24.md) made a sacred fire,
whilst another priest recited a *karakia*. The reason of this proceeding
was: if the sacred fire burnt, then Pu-oro-rangi or Rangi-whakarara
sounded: the former being the rolling or rumbling thunder, the latter
sharp claps of thunder. Only two claps would be heard.<span
id="fr_25"></span>[25](#note_25.md) It was then that the pupils discarded
their sacred garments and went forth from the *marae*, and only returned
in the month that had been fixed for further teaching.

   \[Each day the lessons commenced at daylight, after the priests had
said a prayer, and ended at *pou-tu-maro*, or high noon; no teaching was
carried on after that, for it was against Maori custom, says the Sage in
another place.\]

 

   Now, when the Whare-wānanga is opened for a session by the priests
and pupils, when all are assembled within, the door is closed, and the
following *karakia* is recited:—

<span class="small">   Here am I with an ardent desire, a perseverance
equal to thine, O Ruatau!<span id="fr_26"></span>[26](#note_26.md)  
   Give to these pupils, to these acolytes \[all knowledge\]  
   close the door of this my house, like  
   Te Rangi-kaupapa, door of the Tawhiri-rangi<span
id="fr_27"></span>[27](#note_27.md)  
    <span id="page_92">p. 92</span> That opens up through the plane of
Te Toi-o-nga-rangi,<span id="fr_28"></span>[28](#note_28.md)  
   O Pawa<span id="fr_26"></span>[26](#note_26.md) eh! shut close Tauru-nui
\[the main entrance\],  
   And Tauru-ata-mai of Whare-kura;<span
id="fr_29"></span>[29](#note_29.md)  
   Cover, cover up thy way, cover the cracks,  
   The apertures, the tiny cracks, with the door of . . . . .  
</span>

(Here he mentions the name of the particular house of teaching in which
they were.)

   <span class="small">By thy ardent learner, by thy acolyte, O Rehua!
and Ruatau!<span id="fr_26"></span>[26](#note_26.md)</span>

   The house is then purified by the priest by the following recitation;
he stands at the rearmost pillar in the midst of the eight stones, those
placed as already referred to; he waits until the first rays of the sun
appear in the sky, and then commences as follows:—

   \[In this, and following *karakias*, I have attempted, with the aid
of the Scribe, to render these exceedingly difficult, cryptic and
elliptical compositions, in a form from which a slight understanding of
the meaning may be gathered, with, however, very little satisfactory
result. No one who has not tried it knows how difficult it is to render
this class of composition into understandable English.\]

<span class="small">   By the occult powers of the dark, of the light,
ages—  
   Such powers as thou, O Rongo-marae-roa!<span
id="fr_30"></span>[30](#note_30.md) can exert.  
   Be fruitful, be plentiful, give the great and enduring power to
remove all evil—  
   The inherent original power, unto me, unto this one.  
</span>

   Here the priest strikes the rearmost pillar of the house with his
hand, and continues his *karakia* thus:—

<span class="small">   Be fruitful thy knowledge as also thy love of
it,  
   Be fruitful as the learned high priests of old,  
   Be fruitful thy memory, as the all-knowing gods,  
   Be fruitful of all things outside, as far as the the thoughts may
extend,  
   Be fruitful of knowledge of the Sacred Heavens—  
   Of the Heavens where first arose the priests,  
   To the distant Heavens, to those divided from the uppermost Heavens  
            O Io-e!  
   
   Disclose thy way, with the ancient and erudite,  
   The way of the gods, O Io-the-origin-of-all-things!  
    <span id="page_93">p. 93</span> Cause to descend without and
beyond—  
   To descend within these pupils; these sons;  
   \[That their memories may acquire the support of the gods\]  
   The ancient learning, the occult learning,  
            By thee, O Io-e!  
   
   Grow, grow, as young sprouts, shooting up like spreading leaves  
   The ardent desire towards thee, O Tāne-the-life-giving!<span
id="fr_31"></span>[31](#note_31.md)  
   Descend \[thy spirit\] into thy offspring, O Tāne! O Rua-tau!<span
id="fr_32"></span>[32](#note_32.md)  
   Inform \[their minds with the spirit\] of
Tāne-the-all-knowing-of-Heaven<span id="fr_31"></span>[31](#note_31.md)  
   With a matured memory, a god's memory, with thoughts of thy
ascent,<span id="fr_33"></span>[33](#note_33.md)  
   \[Hold all within\] thy god-like memory.  
   Be fixed, hold fast, at the back of your strenuous desire—  
   Firmly affix to the inception of thought, thy ardent wishes,  
   To the ancient origin of thy offspring, O Pai!<span
id="fr_34"></span>[34](#note_34.md) O Tāne!  
   
   Enter deeply, enter to the very origins,  
   Into the very foundations of all knowledge,  
            O Io-the-hidden-face—e!  
   Gather as in a great and lengthy net, in the inner recesses of the
ears,  
   As also in the desire, and perseverance, of these thy offspring, thy
sons.  
   Descend on them thy memory, thy knowledge,  
   Rest within the heart, within the roots of origin;  
            O Io-the-learned! O Io-the-determined!  
            O Io-the-self-created!  
</span>

   This prayer of the priest ends here. This invocation is to purify the
house and make it very *tapu*; to call on the gods to exert their
god-like powers; on the Pou-tiri-ao \[or guardian spirits, gods<span
id="fr_35"></span>[35](#note_35.md)\] and their powers; on the Apas \[or
messengers of the gods<span id="fr_35"></span>[35](#note_35.md)\]; on the
company of male gods; to make the ears and the understanding of the
pupils receptive, and also to confirm and strengthen in their minds the
matters taught in their presence.

   When the Whare-wānanga is opened to the pupils, the first thing
taught is that of the *uruuru-matua*. After all that course has been
explained, then follows the branch called *uruuru-tipua*, and then
finally the *uruuru-tawhito*. \[These are the three divisions, or
syllabus, into which the knowledge was divided. An explanation of them
will be found in Chapter III.\] When all these branches have been
explained, it ends the teaching of the Kauwae-runga \[or Celestial
things\], as taught to the young men.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

   After this the priest, or priests, stand forth, and enquire of the
pupils which of the three branches of knowledge for that day the pupils
desire to be taught. When this is settled, they are divided into
classes, and those who desire to be taught the *uruuru-tawhito* \[or
third division\] are taught first; on another day will be explained the
*uruuru-tipua* \[second class\]. The third is occupied in the teaching
of the *uruuru-matua* \[first class\]. And thus it continues until the
end of the months appointed for this purpose.

   \[The Scribe explains, that these three classes are not taught in the
same house, but in separate buildings adjacent to the main
Whare-wānanga. It is here the pupils are taught by a priest told off for
the purpose, the special branch the former have selected. The branch of
knowledge called *uruuru-tawhito* is taught in the main building. Having
passed in that subject the pupil passes to the other branches, and thus
all acquire some knowledge of the branches. Before the end of the
Session an examination is held by the priests, by cross-examining the
pupils on the subjects they have learned. It is thus seen who are
proficient, and these, in the final ceremony, are placed on the stones
at the right-hand side of the rearmost pillar, whilst those less
proficient, and who have to go through a second course, are placed on
the left-hand stones, a process which causes these latter pupils much
sorrow and trouble. Those who turn out to be dunces are placed on the
stones by the fireplace. Hence arised the questions of old days, "Where
were you purified?" (or passed, in this case.) If the one questioned has
passed well, he replies, "By the side of the rearmost pillar, on such
and such a stone"—for each of these stones had a name. It is thus known
that the pupil passed a good examination. The lock of hair taken from
the pupil, as described above, was buried under the stone alongside of
which the pupil stood.\]

 

   Again, the three 'baskets of knowledge are opened,' and those parts
appropriate to the Kauwae-raro \[or Terrestrial things\] are brought
forth \[disclosed\]. The proceedings are similar to those in the
teaching of the Kauwae-runga \[Celestial things\]; but in this second
division are taught \[the origin\] of the 'spark of life' unto 'The
Ao-marama' \[World-of-light\];<span id="fr_36"></span>[36](#note_36.md)
that is, the genealogical descent from the twelve heavens,<span
id="fr_37"></span>[37](#note_37.md) down to Papa-tua-nuku \[the Earth, the
Earth-mother\] from whom \[through Tāne\] was Hine-hau-one \[the first
woman\] made. Papa-tua-nuku and Rangi-tuhaha were conjoined, and we now
live <span id="page_95">p. 95</span> beneath the shade \[or shelter\] of
the Kauwae-runga and the Kauwae-raro. This is outside of that branch of
the subject, that developed to Whakaru-ai-moko, Hine-nui-te-po and
Whiro-te-tipua,<span id="fr_38"></span>[38](#note_38.md) in Te Muri-wai-hou
and Rarohenga.<span id="fr_39"></span>[39](#note_39.md)

   There were seven enterings \[courses of lectures\] in the
Whare-wānanga each year; there were never more and never less. At the
end of the last series the basket, in which the *whatus*—stones—which
are given to the young men to swallow, was taken down from the rearmost
pillar, where it hung, as has been explained. Some of the small stones
are collected by the priests and then deposited in the recepticle of the
two *whatus* that have been mentioned. These stones are in appearance, a
*rehu* \[white, like mist ? chalcedony\]; a *huka-a-tai* \[white, like
sea-foam\]; a *para-karaka* \[reddish, or golden in colour, like the
drupes of the *karaka* tree\], or quartz pebbles, that is, a
*hua-kuru*,<span id="fr_40"></span>[40](#note_40.md) which is green in
colour. These are all suspended in a basket at the rearmost pillar of
the house. The priests take out the stones and place them in the pupils
mouths, one to each.<span id="fr_41"></span>[41](#note_41.md) The pupils
are seated on the floor of the house—these pupils were those who had
been taught the subjects pertaining to the *uruuru-matua*; those taught
the other two subjects were placed on the four stones of the rearmost
pillar, and then part of the incantation abstracted from that of
Tupai<span id="fr_42"></span>[42](#note_42.md) was recited, the first <span
id="page_96">p. 96</span> priest, who directed the teaching, commenced
it, and he who finally ended the teaching took up \[*kapo*<span
id="fr_43"></span>[43](#note_43.md)\] the recitation which is as follows:—

<span class="small">   Cause to descend, outside, beyond  
      \[On these pupils, the power of retaining the acquired
knowledge,  
      Let their understanding be accute and far seeing\]  
   Cause to enter into these offspring, these sons,  
   The ancient prized knowledge, the esoteric learning, O Io—e!  
</span>

   When the end of this part of the prayer is reached where the
invocation \[to the Supreme God Io\] comes in, the pupil must swallow
the stone, and immediately after the priest continues his prayer. This
is it:—

<span class="small">   Be received, be possessed, be it affixed,  
   This esoteric knowledge; be firm in thy thoughts, nor deviote,  
   From the powerful, the ancient, the god-like knowledge,  
   Be fixed in thy root and origin; affixed thy constant attention,  
   Firm be thy inspiration, thy ardent desire,  
   Within the roots, and rootlets of thy thoughts.  
   May it grow, the fullness of this knowledge—  
   This ancient knowledge, this original learning,  
   And be like thine, O Io-omnierudite e, i!  
   Let ardent desire direct from thee, O Io-all-knowing! be his.  
   May thy inspiration grow \[equal to thine\]. O Ruatau-e!  
   And to that of Tāne and of Paia-who-acquired-all-knowledge—  
   And to Tangaroa \[god of ocean\] and Tawhiri-matea \[god of strong
winds\]  
   In the beating and the trembling of the heart.  
   Hold firm, for ever, with desire towards the ways of Tu \[the god of
war\]  
   May he draw forth the abundant knowledge.  
   And entwine in his desires, the ways of Rongo \[the god of peace\]  
   Let them combine with matured inspiration.  
   Be effective, the sanctifying meal of Tu-horo-mata,<span
id="fr_44"></span>[44](#note_44.md)  
   And full advantage be taken of the teaching, by these sons,  
   For they are thy offspring, that desire thee, O Io-the-all-father
e!  
</span>

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

   Then is the thunder of Uruao<span id="fr_45"></span>[45](#note_45.md)
resounded. Those taught in the Whare-wānanga now go forth \[the Session
is ended\]. In the month of Tikaka-muturangi \[April\] they all return
together with others who are desirous \[of learning\].

   The following are the months of the year:—

These are all the names of the months \[*kaupeka*\]; that is, the
*marama* \[moons\]; there are other names given by other priests to
these months \[which are more generally used\].

   The 'properties' \[teaching\] in the 'baskets' called *uruuru-tipua*
and *uruuru-tahito* contain also the *karakia makutu* \[witchcraft
spells\] and other spells for destroying growing food or annulling the
proceedings connected therewith, desired by \[evil-minded\] men; as well
as all matters that may be desired for the well-being of man, or the
tribes. But these \[evil\] works are not approved or taught in the
Whare-wānanga; this \[evil\] branch of knowledge is only taught in the
depths of the forest, by the side of a stream, or on the lower side of
the *turuma* \[or latrine\]. \[The same priests taught *Makutu*, as
those of the Whare-wānanga, but in a different place\]. This is done to
avoid the presence of man. After the sun has disappeared beneath the
horizon, and before it appears in the morning, the teaching ends \[i.e.,
it is taught at <span id="page_98">p. 98</span> night\]. But let my
explanation of this subject end; for my knowledge does not include this
branch of the properties of those 'baskets'; that is, we three, Pohuhu,
Okawhare and myself. I have, however, seen two men, named Whinu and Te
Maka, fed with excrement<span id="fr_47"></span>[47](#note_47.md); those
men were taught at Nuku-taurua \[Te Mahia Peninsula, East Coast, New
Zealand\], below the latrine of Kai-uku.<span
id="fr_48"></span>[48](#note_48.md) It was from that teaching they derived
their \[evil\] name for that kind of work. They obtained the powerful
spells, named "Taru-aitu," "Tunawhea," "Tuarowhea," "Maiki-nui," and
"Maiki-roa."<span id="fr_49"></span>[49](#note_49.md) This evil work ends
in *huhu* and *haha* \[emaciation and shortness of breath\]—they—the
spells—are what gives force to man-killing. But enough of this; let
those who have been initiated into this work explain the foundation of
it and its methods.

   O Sir! My word to you is this: Do not take up this branch of
knowledge; it is the occupation of plebeans. All the evil teaching
contained in the \[branches of knowledge called\] *uruuru-tipua* and
*uruuru-tawhito*,<span id="fr_50"></span>[50](#note_50.md) spring from
Whiro \[god of Hades, of evil\] who descended by the Taheke-roa \[the
long-rapid\], by which way the current of death takes men to Hades.
Hence, never consent to those doctrines—it means affliction both to the
body and to the mind. Rather adhere to the life-giving ritual of man,
and of food. Enough of my teaching on this subject; adhere to
Rongo-marae-roa \[the god of peace\] to bring to you the branch \[of the
ceremonies and arts connected with the\] knowledge of the ocean; the
branch that was given to Lady-ocean and to Para-whenua-mea<span
id="fr_51"></span>[51](#note_51.md); they will respond to appeals. All
things <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> \[gods, etc.\] will be responsive
if properly appealed to by appropriate ritual and prayer.

   The proper time for carrying on the proceedings in connection with
the two 'baskets' referred to above \[i.e., the evil branches of
knowledge\] commences in the month Aho-turuturu \[July\] and ends with
Iho-matua \[August\],<span id="fr_52"></span>[52](#note_52.md) it is never
longer than that. The reason why this is so, is that the great 'war of
the gods,' named Te Pae-rangi, between Whiro-te-tipua and Tu-mata-uenga
and others, commenced in July and ended in August.<span
id="fr_53"></span>[53](#note_53.md) It was then that Whiro \[god of death
and evil\] was defeated, and expened by Tāne and his brethren to the
Muriwai-hou at Rarohenga \[Hades\], and to the following \[summary of\]
names:—Hawaiki-nui \[Great Hawaiki\], Hawaiki-roa \[Long Hawaiki\],
Hawaiki-taketake \[The original Hawaiki\], Puhi-aitu \[Death\],
Puhi-rakerake \[where Spirits separate\], Te Piere-nuku \[where Spirits
ascend to Heaven\], Te Toi-o-te-reinga \[the Uppermost Hades\],
Angiangi-tu \[out of Sight above\], Angiangi-raro \[out of Sight to
Hades\], Whakaoti-nuku \[beyond Earthly influences\], Hou-turu and
Hou-motu \[absolutely divided off from Earthly life\].<span
id="fr_54"></span>[54](#note_54.md)

 

### THE PO, OR AGES, ÆONS OF DARKNESS.

   Now, hence are recited \[or quoted\] the *pos* \[or nights, ages,
æons\] of Tua-nuku \[the Earth-mother\] and of Rangi-nui \[the great
Heaven-father\], in the periods called Whetuki, Whekoki, Maru-aitu. When
these were assigned to the stem \[the origin, the root, to the exact
spot\] of Mahu-tonga \[the home of the winds\], of Para-wera-nui \[the
fierce westerly gales\] and to Tahu-makaka-nui \[the heavy westerly
gales\], to the east and north-east. These were \[otherwise called\]
Paepae-té-irihia, -té kakea, Oi-nuku, Oi-roa; and then ended the *pos*
of that branch \[of cosmogony\]—they were as follows:—

|                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. Te Po-tamaku \[the age smoothed off\]                                       |
| 2\. Te Po-kakarauri \[the age of extreme darkness\]                             |
| 3\. Te Po-aoao-nui \[the age of great dawn\]                                    |
| 4\. Te Po-uriuri \[the age of deep black darkness\]                             |
| <span id="page_100">p. 100</span>                                               |
| 5\. Te Po-kerikeri \[the age of darkness\]                                      |
| 6\. Te Po-tiwhatiwha<span id="fr_55"></span>[55](#note_55.md) \[the age of gloom\] |

   Now, it must be understood that these *po* \[æons\] were assigned to
Pou-tere-rangi \[to the entrance to Hades\] to sweep away the
misfortunes of the long-standing world down to Rarohenga \[Hades\], and
where Te Kuwatawata and his companions are stationed—as will be
explained. \[See Chapter III.\]

   Some of these *po* have been separated off to our woman-kind \[i.e.,
the menstrous periods\]. Another division of these *po* were assigned to
Te Marama-i-whanake,<span id="fr_56"></span>[56](#note_56.md) and its
younger brethren \[the stars\], which has already been explained \[under
the names of the months\]. They are:—

|                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. Te Marama-i-whanake \[the waxing moon\]                                               |
| 2\. Te Marama-i-roa \[the lengthened moon\]                                               |
| 3\. Te Marama-i-whiro \[dark night of the moon\]                                          |
| 4\. Te Marama-whakaata \[moon with faint light\]                                          |
| 5\. Te Marama-waha-roa \[great mouthed moon\]                                             |
| 6\. Te Marama-atua \[the moon of the fifteenth day\]                                      |
| 7\. Te Marama-mutu-whenua \[the last days of moon\]<span id="fr_57"></span>[57](#note_57.md) |

   Enough of my explanation of its names. These are the *po*, or
nights:—

|                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. Te Po-taruaitu \[the night with light faintly seen\]                                        |
| 2\. Te Po-whatu-ao \[the night with the eye of light\]                                          |
| 3\. Te Po-atarau \[the night of moonlight\]                                                     |
| 4\. Te Po-para-uriuri \[the night with fragments of blackness\]                                 |
| 5\. Te Po-turu \[the night confirmed\]                                                          |
| 6\. Te Po-whiro \[the night of darkness before new moon\]<span id="fr_58"></span>[58](#note_58.md) |

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

   Here end the *pos* assigned to 'The Waxing Moon' \[i.e., the Moon
generally\]; and hence were separated the Moon and its elder brother
\[the Sun\], and 'The ridge-of-Lady-ocean'<span
id="fr_59"></span>[59](#note_59.md) was fixed as a termination \[a sphere
of influence ?\] in this world; these are 'Te Moana-waipu' \[the deep
ocean\] and Te Moana-tarahau \[? rough ocean\].

   This is also an explanation: Whakaahu, a star \[Castor, in the
constellation Gemini\] was appointed \[or set up\] at Te
Rono-i-wairua<span id="fr_60"></span>[60](#note_60.md) in Hawaiki. I have
already explained that there were four doors in the temple of
Whare-kura,<span id="fr_61"></span>[61](#note_61.md) one road \[into
which\] the *ara-matua*, or main way was to the south, at one end,
another to the *rawhiti* or east. It was there that Whakaahu \[Castor\]
stood; whilst Puanga \[Rigel of Orion\] was fixed at the east of
Rarohenga \[Hades\].

   Let me explain just here about a discussion amongst the priests of
the Whare-wānanga when we were at Uawa,<span
id="fr_62"></span>[62](#note_62.md) in the college named Rawheoro. Some
held that Puanga \[Rigel\], Kopu \[Venus\] and Tawera \[also Venus\]
were names for one and the same star. Some said that the three names
were all intended for Puanga, and Kopu was a secondary name as the star
appeared suspended above the horizon at daylight, and Tawera was a third
name for it as it rose in the heavens. Enough: this contention remained
unshaken \[with them\]. We held that Puanga was a distinct star; but
Kopu and Tawera are the same \[as is most commonly believed by all
Maoris\].

   \[It may be remarked just here, that, however clear to the Sage may
have been his teaching on the subject of the Pō, or nights, ages, æons,
the subject is very difficult to understand without a much more full and
explicit exposition than is herein given. It seems to the translator
that there has come about in the process of ages of teaching, a
confusion between the one series of *Pōs* relating to the cosmological
ages preceding the birth of the gods, and another series under the same
<span id="page_102">p. 102</span> name, which are more intimately
connected with Astronomical Myth and the nights of the Moon, &c. Much of
this has been lost. The ordinary meaning of *Pō* is night; or a period
of time; or the æons darkness (mental and physical) prior to the birth
of the gods.\]

 

### THE WHARE-MAIRE.

   The Whare-maire<span id="fr_63"></span>[63](#note_63.md) is a house of
witchcraft; men are therein taught the ritual for man-slaying,
destruction of food, blasting of trees or the land, spells for
\[retarding\] men's footsteps, and spells said over weapons in war, or
the ritual for divorce, &c. All these are taught therein besides other
matters; and hence is it called a Whare-maire. A true Whare-maire has
only one *whatu* (stone) in it, at the main pillar; it is the stone
called *mata-waiapu* \[obsidian\], and it is this the pupils have to
bite at first, and after that they are taken outside, and exercised in
the "Tipi-o-Houmea" \[name of a spell\] against a tree; the tree drys
up. After that the same spell is directed against a bird such as a
Miromiro \[wren\] or Pekapeka \[bat\]. If this is successful, the spell
is tried on his mother, or elder-brother, or first-born—and if not one
of them, the spell is directed towards the priest of the Whare-maire
himself. If this is successful, the pupil leaves the *marae* of the
Whare-maire, and thus he has acquired the power of the gods.

   In the event of the victims of his magic being at sea, or on the
water, the Sorcerer calls on the god Ruamano to enforce his spell. But
if on land he applies to the gods Tu-nui-a-te-ika, Maru, or
Uenuku-rangi—besides others. \[These are all minor, or tribal gods;
Maru, particular, is a god of sorcery, and war-god of the West Coast
tribes. It seems probable that they were all deified men, famous in
their time for acts of sorcery, or distinguished in war.\]

 

### THE WHARE-PORUKURUKU.<span id="fr_64"></span>[64](#note_64.md)

   This kind of house is used for the same sort of teaching as in the
Whare-maire, but it pertains to a single family, whilst the Whare-maire
is used by all the neighbouring tribes. It is not like the Whare-wānanga
where only the sons of chiefs are taught, whilst the Whare-marie and
Whare-porukuruku are open to plebeans, and the <span id="page_103">p.
103</span> cult of the evil gods is taught therein. \[The teaching of
these inferior houses\] was a former cause of strife and trouble among
the Maori tribes; the proper course would have been to adhere to the
teaching of the Whare-wānanga alone.

   \[It comes out with tolerable clearness in what is written above, the
broad distinction between two classes of priests of former days. The
one, and the higher class, did not concern themselves with sorcery,
though they had the same (supposed) power over the forces of nature as
the other—or *tohunga-makutu*, i.e., Sorcerers—and used enumerable
incantations for most purposes considered necessary for the tribal
welfare. This distinction is not always emphasised, or properly known of
by writers on the other side of the world who, indeed, have to rely on
the publications of local authors who, themselves, have either not been
aware of the fact, or have not given sufficient prominence to it.\]

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_79">p. 79</span>

<span id="page_79_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_79_fr_*.md) The meaning of
these two terms is not quite clear, but Kauhanga was the name given to
the imaginary plane separating the various heavens from each other, and
in that sense they are approximate to the meaning of the upper and lower
planes.

<span id="footnotes_page_80">p. 80</span>

<span id="page_80_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_80_fr_*.md) In Maori, that is;
for in Rarotonga it has also a collective or plural meaning, as *e are
ariki*, the chiefs, or collection of chiefs; *e are atua*, the company
of gods, etc.

<span id="page_80_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_80_fr_dagger.md) See Prof.
A. A. Macdonell's 'A History of Sanskrit Literature,' p. 29. This is not
a philological work, or we might, perhaps, be able to show that
*Wānanga* and *Veda* come from the same root.

<span id="footnotes_page_81">p. 81</span>

<span id="page_81_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_81_fr_*.md) Whatu-kura is
applied both to the male guardian spirits and to the sacred stones.

<span id="page_81_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_81_fr_dagger.md) It is said
that it was from this temple, a sacred stone called a *papa-tatau* (or
inscribed tablet) was brought to New Zealand by Manaia, Te Ha-tauira and
others, and deposited in a house built at Oakura, nine miles south of
New Plymouth. See "Taranaki Coast," p. 156. This, however, is not
derived from the Sage's teaching.

<span id="footnotes_page_82">p. 82</span>

<span id="page_82_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_82_fr_*.md) Māui-mua was the
elder of the five brothers Māui, the youngest being the Solar hero,
Māui-potiki.

<span id="page_82_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_82_fr_dagger.md) There is a
doubt at present about this Uenuku, for though one of that name is shown
as above at thirty-seven generations back, there is another Uenuku, who
is sometimes called Rangi, who flourished twenty-four generations ago,
when the people were in Tahiti.

<span id="footnotes_page_83">p. 83</span>

<span id="page_83_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_83_fr_*.md) In 'Journal
Polynesian Society,' Vol. IX., p. 229, will be found a similar list of
Whare-marie known to the Nga-Rauru people of the West Coast, Cook's
Straits. They are, however, quite a different tribe to that of the
Sage's, and had their own teachings.

<span id="footnotes_page_84">p. 84</span>

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1.md). The Sage here deplores the
abrogation of all *tapu*, and illustrates his meaning by calling
attention to the fact that men's sacred heads are now washed in the same
utensils in which food has been cooked or placed—a most shocking thing
under the old regîme, and entirely distructive of the *tapu*.

<span id="footnotes_page_85">p. 85</span>

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2.md). This was one of the old priests of
Wairarapa.

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3.md). Nepia Pohuhu's teaching we shall
have largely to draw on later.

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4.md). *Whakarewa* is the word used; i.e.,
to float. But it also means to cause the uprising of a war-party ready
to start on the war-trail, a meaning not found in the Dictionaries. This
is the origin of the name Whakarewa at Rotorua.

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5.md). The pupils are here referred to as
*tauira-horomata*. Tauira is the ordinary word for pupil. But,
*horomata*, is the name for a very small quantity of food—generally
*aruhe*, or fern root—given to the pupils just before the teaching
commenced, to cause their minds to become absorbed in the subjects
taught, known emblematically as Tu-horo-mata.

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6.md). *Kete-wānanga* = basket of
knowledge, used emblematically as the subject taught. It is difficult to
find an English equivalent; syllabus is something like it.

<span id="footnotes_page_86">p. 86</span>

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7.md). The *paepae-awha* is the squared
and carved log which extends from side to side of the house inside the
front gable; it is about two feet high, and over which people step into
the open porch of the house. Outside this is the *marae* or court, or
plaza, where, in ordinary villages, meetings, ceremonies, etc., are
held.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8.md). This is leprosy, otherwise called
*ngerengere* or *take-whenua* (which is the original term). It is called
*mumutu* because the fingers drop off, whence the word.

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9.md). The Scribe states that only those
women who never have *menses* are ever allowed within the *marae*.

<span id="footnotes_page_87">p. 87</span>

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10.md). The *whatu* is some object
buried at the foot of the pillar to ensure sanctity and prestige. In a
high-chief's building this was often a slave who was made to squat in
the hole embracing the pillar, and then buried alive. This was also done
in the case of some of the main posts of the fortified *pas*.—See
'Journal Polynesian Socicty,' Vol. XX., p. 15. It was suggested in the
Introduction to these Chapters, that the Angami tribes of Assam, India,
were a belated branch of the Polynesian people. This ceremony of placing
a *whatu* at the base of the main post of a house was known to them as
well as the Maoris, as the following extract from Vol. XX., No.2.
1909—of "Folk Lore" will show—Mrs. T.C. Hodson therein says: "The head
man of a large and powerful village on the frontier state of Manipur was
engaged in building himself a new house, and to strengthen it seized
this man—a Naga—and forcibly cut off a lock of his hair, which had to be
buried underneath the main post of the house. In olden times the head
would have been put there, but by a refinement of some native theologian
a lock of hair was held to be as good as a whole head." The Angami
people are a branch of the Nagas and live just north of Manipur.

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11.md). A large lizard, twelve to
eighteen inches long, *Sphenadon punctatus*, which, although now only
found on the off islands, was common on the mainland formerly.—See
'Journal Polynesian Society,' Vol. XX., p. 40.

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12.md). The *Whanau a Te Arawaru raua ka
Kau-mahi* (the family of Arawaru and Kau-mahi) were numerous; they
consist of several of the bivalve shell-fish. Their names are given by
the Sage in another part of his teaching as follows.—Te Pipi-toretore,
Te Pipi-taiawa, Te Pipi-pokai, Te Pipi-rapaki, Te Pipi-koura, Te
Pipi-awanga, Te Pipi-koroputa, Te Pipi-tuangi, Te Pipi-peraro, Te
Pipi-kapeo and Tairaki—some, if not all, of which are emblematical
names. The story is that a war once took place between the *Pipi*
(bivalve) family and the *Kuku* (mussel) family at Waiharu, and the
former drove the latter to the *One-tahua*, or beach between the tides.

<span id="footnotes_page_88">p. 88</span>

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13.md). The *Ahurewa* was a most sacred
altar at the back part of the home, near the *pou-tuarongo*. In front of
it was laid a woven mat that had been made sacred. This covered the
*whatu-kuras*, or sacred stones.—See *infra*. The *Ahurewa* was also the
spot where the priests kept their sacred clothing worn during the
teaching, and there also was deposited the *ipu-tapu*, or sacred vessel,
in which 'holy water' was kept, which was offered to the gods by
throwing a few drops over the left shoulder.

<span id="note_14"></span>[14](#fr_14.md). It is strange how sacred a place
the latrine is in all Maori ceremonies; we shall frequently find mention
of it as this narrative progresses. The *Tuāhu* of the Whare-wānanga,
says the Scribe, was the right-hand post of the rail, usually carved,
where people sit to ease themselves.

<span id="note_15"></span>[15](#fr_15.md). It has already been mentioned
that food contaminates or abrogates the *tapu* of all sacred places or
things.

<span id="footnotes_page_89">p. 89</span>

<span id="note_16"></span>[16](#fr_16.md). Probably this number represents
the eleven heavens, exclusive of the twelfth, sacred to the Supreme God
Io.

<span id="note_17"></span>[17](#fr_17.md). Huka-a-tai = Sea-foam, or like
sea-foam. It was explained to me by the Scribe, that this is not a
common stone found on the surface of the earth. Originally it was
believed to have been brought from the heavens, and was the material out
of which the Whatu-kura-a-Tāne and the Whatu-kura-a-Tangaroa were
made—see description of these later on. *Rehu* is sea-foam.

<span id="note_18"></span>[18](#fr_18.md). Takuahi. The ordinary fire-place
of a Maori home is situated near the middle of the floor, and is a
shallow hole with a flat stone on each of its four sides. In the ancient
temple named Hawaiki (from which all subsequent places of that name
derive their origin) there were four *takuahi*, one opposite each door,
but in the centre of the temple, the doors being opposite the four
cardinal directions; it was by these the spirits entered from the four
points of the compass, and it was in this temple spirits of the dead
separated—some to the Supreme God Io, others to the evil spirit, and
fallen god Whiro. See later on. The Scribe says these stones were about
nine inches high, and the pupils who have passed a good examination are
placed on the right-hand stones, those who have to come up again on the
left. Each stone has a different name, as mentioned below.

<span id="note_19"></span>[19](#fr_19.md). Rongo-taketake, is a form of
peace-making between hostile tribes, in which the war-gods of the
opposing parties are supposed to be present, and through their priests,
confirm and consent to such peace. It was the most enduring form of
peace of all. In the Ure-wera country it is known as the
'Tatau-pou-namu' or 'Jadeite-door,' presumably meaning that the peace
was as enduring as a door made of that material—not, however, that this
valuable substance was ever used for such a purpose—the expression was
allegorical. Rongo-taketake as used here implies that the knowledge
gained by the pupils will last; he will never forget.

<span id="footnotes_page_90">p. 90</span>

<span id="note_20"></span>[20](#fr_20.md). This ceremony is often referred
to in Maori history. The act of simulated biting is said to induce the
'hardening,' or remembrance of the teaching. It is also said to shew the
determination of the pupil to adhere to the teaching, a form of
declaration that they were equal to anything, however repulsive, in
order to show their proficiency.

<span id="note_21"></span>[21](#fr_21.md). The clothing consisted of a
short flax kilt, called a *pekerangi*—so called from the fact that when
not in use and hung out to air, they were placed on the *pekerangi*, or
outside palisade of the *pa*.

<span id="note_22"></span>[22](#fr_22.md). As a matter of fact, all but the
*koukou*, or what may be calied a scalp-lock, was close clipped or
shaven in both men and boys, whether being taught or not. It was
considered highly advantageous if the wizard could procure any part of
the victim he intended to bewitch, over which to say his incantations,
and hence the care exercised, as described above.

<span id="note_23"></span>[23](#fr_23.md). The window, in all houses, was
on the right of the door as one entered, and within the door on the left
hand side was the place of honour for guests in an ordinary house. Both
door and window were closed by sliding panels.

<span id="footnotes_page_91">p. 91</span>

<span id="note_24"></span>[24](#fr_24.md). Kaunoti, is the dry stick laid
on the ground and on to which the pointed *kaurimarima* is briskly
rubbed to procure fire—the common Polynesian method. In travelling these
dried sticks (of certain woods only, in which Māui had placed the 'seeds
of fire'), were carried suspended round the neck to keep them dry, and
thus by contact with the body they became *tapu*—so says the Scribe, but
I think the *ahi tapu* means rather a sacred fire, especially generated
in connection with various ceremonies.

<span id="note_25"></span>[25](#fr_25.md). Of course we unbelieving White
people cannot exactly swallow this. There is probably some esoteric
meaning here not explained.

<span id="note_26"></span>[26](#fr_26.md). Ruatau, Aitu-Pawa, and Rehua
were of the minor gods, guardians of the treasures of the uppermost
heavens where Io dwelt, As we shall see in Chapter III., they are
heavenly priests, to whom Io delegated the power of consecration, to
purify Tāne on this ascent to the highest heaven.

<span id="note_27"></span>[27](#fr_27.md). Tawhiri-rangi, see [number
three](#page_81.md) in the list of Whare-wānanga *ante*. Te Rangi-kaupapa
is the name of its door. The reciter asks that the door of the college
may be as closely shut as that of the heavenly house, so that nothing
may be heard of the teaching outside.

<span id="footnotes_page_92">p. 92</span>

<span id="note_28"></span>[28](#fr_28.md). Te Toi-o-nga-rangi, the Twelfth
Heaven, abode of Io and his immediate servitors.

<span id="note_29"></span>[29](#fr_29.md). Whare-kura, see [number
five](#page_81.md) of the list quoted above. Tauru-ata-mai, means to
exclude all evil. The reciter appears to address these learned gods to
inspire the pupil with understanding, and so to close np the place of
teaching that no extraneous matters should divert the attention of the
pupils, etc.

<span id="note_30"></span>[30](#fr_30.md). Rongo-marae-roa, god of peace.

<span id="footnotes_page_93">p. 93</span>

<span id="note_31"></span>[31](#fr_31.md). Tāne, god number sixty-eight.

<span id="note_32"></span>[32](#fr_32.md). Ruatau, one of the guardians of
the heavenly treasures.

<span id="note_33"></span>[33](#fr_33.md). For Tāne's ascent into Heaven
see Chapter III.

<span id="note_34"></span>[34](#fr_34.md). Paia, one of the gods.

<span id="note_35"></span>[35](#fr_35.md). See hereafter as to these
things.

<span id="footnotes_page_94">p. 94</span>

<span id="note_36"></span>[36](#fr_36.md). That is, everyday life of this
terrestrial world.

<span id="note_37"></span>[37](#fr_37.md). The Sage here makes use of the
expression Rarigi-tuhaha, which is a comprehensive term including all
the heavens.

<span id="footnotes_page_95">p. 95</span>

<span id="note_38"></span>[38](#fr_38.md). These three are gods of the
underworld, about which we shall learn later on.

<span id="note_39"></span>[39](#fr_39.md). Names for the underworld or
Hades.

<span id="note_40"></span>[40](#fr_40.md). The name *hua-kuru* is
interesting; it means 'fruit of the bread-fruit-tree,' and is possibly
so called because the stones used in some former habitat bore the
appearance of the green bread-fruit, which, of course does not grow in
New Zealand, though common all over the warmer parts of Polynesia.

<span id="note_41"></span>[41](#fr_41.md). The Scribe tells me that during
this ceremony of stone-swallowing, one of the larger stones deposited at
the rearest pillar was elevated on a kind of stool, called a *pou-turu*,
and in the centre of this stone was a circular hole, over which the
pupil places his left hand, the right hand resting on the shoulder of
the priest, who, then taking one of the small pebbles in his mouth,
recites a *karakia*; after which he places the stone in the month of the
pupil, who swallows it. This pebble is afterwards recovered, and always
retained by the pupil. In cases where he has to recite any of the matter
taught in the College, he places this stone in his mouth whilst
speaking. It is then called a *kohatu-mataki*, or *puaroa*; and the
belief is that by its means the full recollection of all he has learned
in the College comes back to him. One of these stones I saw, was a
little piece of chalcedony, about the size of a walnut, and had probably
been a Moa gizzard stone.

<span id="note_42"></span>[42](#fr_42.md). Tupai was one of those who
accompanied the god Tāne to the uppermost Heaven when he went to obtain
the three 'baskets' of knowledge. It was also the name of one of the
priests that came in the 'Takitimu' canoe to New Zealand *circa* 1350.

<span id="footnotes_page_96">p. 96</span>

<span id="note_43"></span>[43](#fr_43.md). Many of these *karakias* had to
be recited without a break to take breath; a solution of its continuity
destroyed its efficacy. When the first priest's breath was exhausted,
another one would *kapo*, or take up the strain, and carry it on without
break to the end. Such is what the Sage refers to. It is well-known that
the old Hindu priests acted in a similar manner to these Polynesians, in
ancient days, and, that according to them, to be effective the prayers
(*mantras*) must be completed in one breath.

<span id="note_44"></span>[44](#fr_44). See [note five](#note_5.md),
*ante*.

<span id="footnotes_page_97">p. 97</span>

<span id="note_45"></span>[45](#fr_45.md). Uruao, the 'Cloud Piercer': but
the name is also that of the first canoe built by these people in the
Fatherland, of which Tama-rereti was commander, and as we shall see, in
it he explored some countries to the east—probably Indonesia. This
canoe, Te Waka-a-Tama-rereti, is now represented in the Heavens by the
constellation Scorpio. Uruao above means a single clap of thunder. The
Scribe says that the first canoe built by these people was copied from
the constellation. This Celestial vessel is supposed to be laden with
many of the smaller stars, which sometimes fall out, and are then known
as meteors.

<span id="note_46"></span>[46](#fr_46.md). Though the months here start
with January, the Maori year really begins with the rising of the
constellation Matariki \[the Pleiades\] at sunset at the first new moon
in June. Other priests say the year commenced with the rising of the
star Puanga (Rigel); about this much might be said, but this is not the
place.

<span id="footnotes_page_98">p. 98</span>

<span id="note_47"></span>[47](#fr_47.md). This starement will no doubt
cause surprise and disgust. But it was one of the ordeals that a pupil
under instruction in the art of witchcraft had to pass through, as
showing his readiness to undertake any of the other and severe ordeals,
before he became proficient in the art. There is a Maori expression, *he
tangata kai tutae* (a man who would eat excrement), implying that such a
one would face any difficulty in order to accomplish his end—a man who
would fight to the death to secure victory for his side.

<span id="note_48"></span>[48](#fr_48.md). Kaiuku, a name given to a *pa*
at Te Mahia on account of a notable siege in which the inhabitants were
reduced to eating clay—which is the meaning of the word. See "Maori Wars
of the Nineteenth Century," p. 328 (2nd Edition, 1910).

<span id="note_49"></span>[49](#fr_49.md). These spells were supposed to be
all powerful in witchcraft. An example of their (supposed) effect is
well illustrated in the story of "Mahu and Taewa," 'Journal Polynesian
Society.' Vol. VII., p. 127. A very much more complete account of these
incidents, in which the several ordeals are described, will be published
later. Different forms of affliction are also known by the above
emblematical names.

<span id="note_50"></span>[50](#fr_50.md). These will be explained in
Chapter III.

<span id="note_51"></span>[51](#fr_51.md). Para-whenua-mea, emblematical
for one of the gods of the 'Deluge.' The word is also used to represent
the effacement of nature due to the flood. Para-whenua-mea is connected
also with the Hawaiian godess of voloanoes, Pele.

<span id="footnotes_page_99">p. 99</span>

<span id="note_52"></span>[52](#fr_52.md). This statement must not be
confounded with a previous one, where it is said that the Session lasts
from April to October; the Sage is here referring to the months in which
witchcraft is taught.

<span id="note_53"></span>[53](#fr_53.md). This great division of the gods,
known as 'The War of Pae-rangi,' will be fully described in Chapter III.

<span id="note_54"></span>[54](#fr_54.md). Such are the meanings given by
the Scribe. They are no doubt emblematical names used by the priests to
recan certain events or circumstances to their minds. We shall come
across others of a similar nature later on.

<span id="footnotes_page_100">p. 100</span>

<span id="note_55"></span>[55](#fr_55.md). It is difficult to explain in
English (or even to understand) the ideas conveyed by the expressions in
the above paragraphs; but approximately the words express the various
ages or æons of cosmical darkness, during which the Sky-father adhered
closely to the Mother-earth, and during which, and due to which, the
gods were conceived and born. Many other recitations give ten as the
number of æons prior to the coming forth of the gods to the light of the
world. These æons seem to be personified, endowed with semi-personal and
material charaoteristics, as the next paragraph shows. The Scribe says
they are the names of the *po* (nights, ages, &c.) of the Reinga, or
Hades, where no light is ever seen—it is always thus. But compare the
story of Mataora given in Chapter VI., which seems to contradict this.

<span id="note_56"></span>[56](#fr_56.md). The rising or waxing moon, an
expression the Sage often employs for the moon.

<span id="note_57"></span>[57](#fr_57.md). The Scribe states that this
division of the lunar month, is the ancient division into four-day
periods.

<span id="note_58"></span>[58](#fr_58.md). These are other names for
division of the month acoording to brightness of the moon.

<span id="note_59"></span>[59](#fr_59.md). Ridge = *tuahiwi*; The ocean
between New Zealand and Hawaiki is supposed to have a 'ridge' in it,
where boisterous weather, according io tradition, was frequently met
with—it is probably the meeting point of the Trade-winds and the
generally prevailing westerly winds, between latitude 25° and 30°.
Cook's Straits is equally supposed to have a *tuahiwi* in it. But it is
clear that the *tuahiwi* mentioned in the text is far more ancient than
the two here referred to, and refers to that *tuahiwi* in the heavens,
otherwise the Milky Way, which was appointed as a division between the
spheres of the sun and moon, after their strife.—See Chapter V.

<span id="note_60"></span>[60](#fr_60.md). Te Hono-i-wairua, the assemblage
of spirits; where the spirits of the dead gathered at the first Hawaiki
prior to their separation, some to the supreme god Io, others to the
realms of Whiro in the under-world.

<span id="note_61"></span>[61](#fr_61.md). Here assumed to be identical
with Hawaiki, the temple.

<span id="note_62"></span>[62](#fr_62.md). Tologa Bay. East Coast, twenty
miles north of Gisborne. For Rawheoro, see introduction to this Chapter.

<span id="note_63"></span>[63](#fr_63.md). The Scribe says the name *maire*
is derived from the tree of that name, of which weapons were made; and
as the Whare-maire was used for the teaching of witchcraft principally
(according to these tribes, but not to others), leading to death, the
house was so called in consequence.

<span id="note_64"></span>[64](#fr_64.md). This is taken from another part
of Te Matorohanga's teaching. The Whare-porukuruku was a temporary house
of learning, used when the people were away from their permanent homes,
says the Scribe.
