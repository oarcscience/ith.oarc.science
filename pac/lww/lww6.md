\[I<span class="small">N</span> the following two papers from Te
Matorohanga's teaching, we are introduced to incidents connected with
the visits of Māui and Mataora to Hades, and it is perhaps a little
doubtful whether the Sages of old would have considered them as strictly
belonging to the 'Kauwae-runga,' or 'Things Celestial.' But—if we are to
trust to the genealogies and the apparent belief of the old Priests—the
events occurred within a few generations of the birth of man! and
scarcely belong to what we may call the strictly Historical Period—the
'Kauwae-raro,' or the 'Things Terrestrial.'

   Māui is not a god, according to the teaching of the Sages; but a
hero. And yet the circumstances surrounding his adventures carry us back
to a very ancient period; so far back indeed that the legends and myths
partake of much the same character, and include some similar incidents,
to those to be found not only in Aryan Myths, but in those of other
races, e.g., in those of Egypt. We find, for instance, in Gerald
Massey's 'Book of the Beginnings,' p. 145, what is evidently a reference
to Māui as the Solar Hero. He says, "The first Celestial hero was not
the Sun, but the conqueror of the Sun and solar heat;" and it was one of
Māui's first exploits to conquer the Sun.<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1.md) In the Aryan Mythology we may find further
references to the deeds of Māui, e.g., in the Celtic and Scandinavian
myths—not exactly in the same form, it is true, but the ideas are
similar, altered by environment. It has more than once been suggested
that Māui's conquest of the Sun is the mythical belief and dimly
remembered tradition of a time when the forefathers of the Polynesian
race dwelt in a country where the days were very short, as, for
instance, in some Fatherland far north of India, before the Aryan people
migrated into that country. It is likewise a <span id="page_175">p.
175</span> question whether, indeed, Māui's visit to the Pō, or Hades,
described below, was not in reality a visit to the ancient Fatherland in
the north, the word Pō describing the long nights of the Arctic
circle.<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2.md) What follows as to Māui is by
no means a full account of his doings.

   Although the genealogies from this hero Māui show him to be one of
the family of five brothers of that name, the impression derived from
what little we know of this family is, that they flourished about fifty
generations ago in Indonesia, and that in process of time the miraculous
deeds of the solar hero—whether his name was also Māui or not—have
become attached to the historical Māui, who (with his brothers) was
undoubtedly an historical character, and a great explorer and navigator.
It will be noticed in the story which follows that Te Matorohanga had no
belief in the "fishing-up" of various islands.

 

   In the account of Mataora's visit to the Pō, or Hades, which follows,
we have an entirely different description of Hades from that given by
our two Sages, who describe it as a place of everlasting night, of
profound darkness. Whereas in the story of Mataora we are led to infer
that the Pō is a world like this, in which the inhabitants—the
Turehu—were of a more advanced civilization than the Maori people at the
date of the visit, and these people are described as fair in complexion,
with 'flaxen hair.' It would seem that this story is in reality the
account of a visit paid to some country bordering on the Fatherland,
where certain arts were practised not then known to the Polynesians. The
introduction into the story of some features common to the true Hades,
probably indicates that it is so ancient that memory has failed to
preserve the distinction between the two—that in fact in the process of
time, when the name of this country of flaxen-haired people had been
forgotten, it was ascribed to the Pō, the night, oblivion in the mental
sense. Perhaps we may see some confirmation of this in the retention by
the Urewera tribes of the name Mataora as that 'of a very ancient
dwelling-place of the Maori ancestors. It was the place they removed to
after leaving Au-roroa where Tāne and the other gods lived, and from
Mataora they removed to Hawaiki-nui.'<span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3.md)
In this case the hero Mataora's name has been applied to the country or
visa versa. But for the statement that the art of tattooing, by cutting
deep incisions in the flesh, is said to have been brought from the Pō
(or this country, if it be one) we might be induced to suggest that the
'fair <span id="page_176">p. 176</span> race with flaxen hair' is a dim
recollection of such a people dwelling on the borderland of the ancient
Fatherland. And, if as the gradually accumulating evidence seems to
indicate, this Fatherland was India, we might be warranted in suggesting
that this fair race was a part of the Grecian settlers left in Parthia,
to the north-west of India, and who, it is known, in the centuries
before Christ joined the Parthian Armies in warlike incursions into
India. The Grecian noses of the Turehu—so different to those of the
Polynesians—gives perhaps a slight support to this, as does their
dances—again quite different to those of the Polynesians. Moreover, it
will be noticed that the two gods of Hades—Whiro and Whakaru-au-moko—and
the goddess Hine-nui-te-po, are not mentioned in this story of Mataora.
However, this is not the place to dilate on this question.

   The folluwing account of Māui is not to be found in one place in the
Sage's teaching, but they are here gathered together; nor does it
profess to be a full account of that hero's doings.\]

 

ON the 6th March, 1860, Te Matoro-hanga commenced his teaching by
saying, "I will begin by reciting the traditions relating to Māui before
going further:—

   Mahuika married Muri-ranga-whenua, and they had Taranga, who married
Irawhaki, who had the following offspring:—

|                 |                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 1\. Māui-mua    | 4\. Māui-pae            |
| 2\. Māui-roto   | 5\. Māui-tiki-a-Taranga |
| 3\. Māui-taha   |                         |

   Now, there is a long history about these Māuis; but we will take that
of Māui-tiki-a-Taranga, so as to quickly reach the object sought by the
meeting. The above are the Māui family.

   Let us go back to the defeat of the Pekerau family \[see [p.
146](lww4.htm#page_146.md) Chapter IV.\] at the time of the incident named
'Paihau-ka-roha.' Hine-nui-te-po \[goddess of Hades, after the above
defeat\] sent against Māui the descendants of Huriwai, i.e., the
Tini-o-Poto \[the Poto tribe, the sand-fly, mosquito, etc., [p.
128](lww3.htm#page_128.md)\]. When Māui and his companions arrived there,
the Poto tribe struck them on the head and legs; and when Māui slapped
them, they escaped and carried off the blood they had sucked to
Hine-nui-te-po, who was then dwelling at Kautere-rangi in the *pa* of
her relative, Whakaru-au-moko \[god of volcanic forces\] at
Rangi-riri.<span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4.md) Hine-nui-te-po smeared
this blood upon the <span id="page_177">p. 177</span> entrance and door
of the house named Potaka-rongorongo, at the same time reciting the
following words \[as a spell, *hirihiri*, to nullify the object of
Māui's visit\]:—

<table data-align="center">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span class="small">Whose is this house? 'Tis that of Hine-nui-te-po!<br />

The house of anger of Hine-nui-te-po<br />
Within Ngana-te-wareware. Whose is the house?<br />
'Tis my house, named Po-taka-rongorongo!</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   After Hine-nui-te-po had ended this part \[of her precautions\] she
applied \[the same ceremonies\] to the 'door of Rua-i-te-wareware' \[the
Pit-of-oblivion\], to 'Rua-rautoka' \[Pit-of-curses\], to 'Rua-i-nokia'
\[Pit-of-the-overcome\], and to 'Pu-mahara-kore' \[the Very-negation-of
thought\].<span id="fr_6"></span>[6](#note_6.md) Here she finished and then
retired to the innermost pillar of the house and there laid down. She
was overcome with the heat and fell into a deep sleep, with her legs
stretched out far apart. When Māui and his companions \[the three birds
already mentioned\] arrived there they found her still lying at the back
of the house, Potaka-rongorongo, with her legs wide apart. Māui then
assumed the form of a rat, and asked his companions, "How do you think
this will do?" \[In order to understand this story, it must be
remembered that Māui's object was to enter the womb of
Hine-nui-to-po—the first truly human woman—and by passing through her
vitals to her mouth, to destroy death.\] Tatahore replied, "It will not
do at all! It is quite different to what it ought to be. She will be
aroused!" Māui then took on the form of a reptile (*sic*), the worm
called *noke*. Tiwaiwaka said, "She will be waked up by the horns of the
waxing Moon." So Māui then assumed the form of the *moko-huruhuru* \[the
hairy-lizard\] and began squirming about the court-yard. His friends all
laughed at this, and said \[ironically\], "That is better!" Māui now
said, "Enough! My command to you two is, when I enter the womb of
Hine-nui-te-po, you must on no account laugh. When I reach her heart and
begin to gnaw it in order that she may be killed by us, if you see she
begins to squirm then scoop out her eyes!" His friends replied, "That is
well, we will do so!" Māui finally said to his companions, "Be sure that
you do not laugh!"

   So Māui having taken on the form of the *noke* worm then entered the
Paepae-o-Tiki \[the womb\], but as he disappeared within, the parts
<span id="page_178">p. 178</span> of Hine-nui-te-po opened out. At this
Tatahore burst out laughing, whilst Tiwaiwaka rushed out to the
court-yard and began dancing about \[with delight\]. And then was
aroused the 'World-of-light'—life<span id="fr_7"></span>[7](#note_7.md) of
Hine-nui-te-po, and feeling the squirming of the worm within her, she
closed her parts, and strangled the neck of Māui, who was thus killed.
This death is referred to as 'Wai-kumia' and 'Wai-haro-rangi.'

   It will thus be seen that the 'cord-of-death' was not cut off by
Māui. He was the only one who ever attempted to sever the 'current of
death' that ever flows to everlasting night.

   \[At this point one of the audience asked the Sage if he had not
invented the 'worm,' and had this not some other meaning in reality. To
which the Sage replied, "No! That is the true meaning. You may see in
the *noke* worm to this day, on the head, the mark of the strangulation
by which Māui died. If you come across the Tiwaiwaka \[the Fan-tail
bird\] he will not fail to laugh at you and dance about \[which, of
course, is the habit of this sweet little bird\].

 

### MAUI AND THE VOLCANIC FIRE.

   . . . . . . Think also of \[the story of\] Mahuika; from under his
finger nails came forth the original or volcanic fire.<span
id="fr_8"></span>[8](#note_8.md) It was Māui who planted this fire \[in
certain woods\] and thus caused it to be seen on Earth. Māui died at
Wai-kumia \[see above\], but \[was nearly destroyed previously at\]
Tahu-kumia and Tahu-rangi. He called on his ancestors, Iho-rangi (10)
and Tawhiri-matea (7) to withdraw the 'plug' of Mahu-tonga,<span
id="fr_9"></span>[9](#note_9.md) because he was almost overcome by the
Ahi-toro \[the spreading fire\] and the Ahi-turangi \[fire as high as
Heaven\]. And then they \[the above two gods\] sent the snow first of
all—but it did not extinguish the fire; then the rain, which was
effectual. But by the time the fire was extinguished Māui had been much
scorched by 'the fire of Mahuika.' At first \[when in danger of the fire
overtaking him\] he assumed the form of an owl and fled to the depths of
the <span id="page_179">p. 179</span> forest to seek shelter, but the
fire of Mahuika came over the place, so he abandoned that. He then
turned himself into a Sparrow-hawk; it was no use; it was just as
before, he could do nothing but remain in the Great-Forest-of-Tāne. Next
he tried the form of the Kite (Hawk) and soared up to a great height,
and there was able to call on Te Iho-rangi (10) and Tawhiri-matea (7),
hence was Māui saved \[through these gods sending down the heavy rains
which extinguished the 'Fire of Mahuika,' which was destroying the face
of the Earth\]. His narrow escapes at that time are known as
'Wai-haro-rangi' and Te 'Mata-whiti-o-tu'; and the semblance of these
things are perpetuated in the Hawk, the Sparrow-hawk and the Owl to this
day, for the singeing of the fire is shown on their brown feathers.

 

### MAUI THE FISHER-UP-OF-LANDS.

   \[From a different part of the Ruanuku's teaching the following is
taken:—\] On a certain occasion it was decided by the people to go out
to sea to fish. Māui-mua \[the elder brother\] said to his younger
brethren, to Māui-taha, Māui-pae, and Māui-tikitiki, "O Sirs! Go ye all
to catch some fish for us." They consented, and then Māui-mua said unto
Pokopoko, Hou, and Moka, "Go and prepare the lines and hooks, and get
ready the canoe named . . . . ." \[not given\]. Māui-taha then said,
"Māui-tikitiki must remain ashore; he is a mischievous fellow; lest he
play some trick on us." Māui-tikitiki said, "I will not remain ashore!"
This caused much argument between the two; at last Māui-mua said, "Let
your younger brother go with you," and thus Māui-tikitiki was allowed to
go. And so the canoe was soon afloat on the deep ocean.

   When they had got out a long way the elder brothers said to Hou, "Let
go the anchor of the canoe!" But Māui-tikitiki said, "What kind of fish
can be caught here? Let us go further out!" So they went further out,
and after paddling a long way Māui-taha called out, "O, Hou! We are a
very long way out!" But Māui-tikitiki said, "This place is a reef!" and
he let down his line and sinker, and showed them it was quite shallow,
saying, "Look! It is quite shallow; it is a reef. There are none but
little fish here." So the canoe proceeded on a very long way out, and
then Māui-tikitiki said, "We are far enough; let go the anchor." So Hou
let the anchor down, and the lines were soon dropped into the water.
Māui-tikitiki asked his brothers to give him some bait for his hook, but
his elder brothers said, "Where were you, that you did not procure some
bait of your own?" Then Māui-tikitiki said to Hou, Moka, and Pokopoko,
"Give me some bait for my hook!" They replied, "There is not <span
id="page_180">p. 180</span> sufficient for yours and ours too." At this
Māui was much disconcerted, and said to his companions, "I thought in
asking you, you would not treat me thus."

   Then Māui withdrew his fish-hook from his basket, and his companions
saw that his hook was made of human bone<span
id="fr_10"></span>[10](#note_10.md)—a man's jaw-bone, which he fastened on
to his line. His hook was in reality the jaw-bone of his ancestor
Muri-ranga-whenua. His line was named . . . . \[not given\], and the
sinker was called 'Te Whata-a-Kiwa'.<span
id="fr_11"></span>[11](#note_11.md) The hook descended and became fast on
to the bottom. Thus he caught his 'fish'; he began to pull it up—he
could not succeed in doing so. Māui-tikitiki shouted out to Pokopoko,
Moka, and Hou, "Come and help me to haul up my fish!" The elder brothers
ealled out, "Let your fish go; we shall all be destroyed." Māui replied,
"The fish caught by the jaw-bone of my ancestor Muri-ranga-whenua, will
not be allowed to go." And then they all proceeded to haul up the fish;
when it reached the surface, lo! it was Ao-tea-roa \[New Zealand\], that
fish of Māui-tikitiki.<span id="fr_12"></span>[12](#note_12.md)

   The elder brothers now wished to cut up the fish; but Māui said, "Let
the fish remain there quietly until it is cool, and then cut it up." But
the elder brothers and their companions would not listen, and at once
proceeded to cut up the 'fish.' Now hence is the broken nature \[of the
surface\] of the 'fish' with its many mountains. If the elder brethren
had not trampled all over it, the 'fish' would not present the
\[broken\] appearance it does.

   There is another account of this incident which says, that Māui
struck his nose until it bled, and then smeared the blood on his hook,
and this was the bait that fished up the island.

   You now understand this version of the story; but the real meaning
will be seen from the following:—

 

### THE OVERTURNING BY MATAAHO.

   You have all heard of the man named Mata-aho. In his times and those
of Māui, Io-nui \[the Supreme God\], decided to send Rua-tau and
Aitu-pawa<span id="fr_13"></span>[13](#note_13.md) down to Mataaho to
inform him that the springs of Kiwa (52), one of the gods of ocean,
Tawhiri-matea (7), god of tempests, and <span id="page_181">p.
181</span> Te Iho-rangi (10), god of rain, snow, hail, etc., would be
loosened, that the Earth might be drowned<span
id="fr_14"></span>[14](#note_14.md) and overturned down to Hades. After
that Mataaho and Whakaru-an-moko (70) were to separate \[distribute\]
the Earth, so that the head, the sides, the arms, and legs might all be
separated.<span id="fr_15"></span>[15](#note_15.md) The reason of this
decree of Io-nui was, his *pouri* \[sorrow, regret, literally darkness
of heart\] on account of the warfare of Whiro-te-tipua (6) and his
younger brother Tu-mata-uenga (11) at Te Paerangi,<span
id="fr_16"></span>[16](#note_16.md) which was after the separation of the
Sky-father and Earth-mother \[and the evil of which\] still endures even
from that time to the present day. Peace has never been made between
Tāne-nui-a-rangi (68) and Whiro-te-tipua (6)—hence the 'Maiki-roa'
\[sickness, death, all kinds of diseases\] that still visits \[and
causes trouble\] between them and \[the offspring of\] their elder
brethren, and, hence also is 'Taheke-roa,' the 'road of death,' that
descends to everlasting night when \[men's spirits\] pass over to the
Po-tiwha and Po-kerekere \[utter darkness\] to Rarohenga \[Hades\],
which consumes mankind and all else in this world. And, thence are all
the troubles of this world.

   It will now be understood that the \[nature of the\] decree of
Io-tikitiki-o-rangi \[Io-the-exalted-of-heaven\] which he delivered unto
Mata-aho and Whakaru-au-moko (70) that the Earth should be thus treated
at that time. Hence is this called 'Te Hurianga-i-a-Mataaho'
\[the-overturning-in-Mataaho's-time\], which we have all heard of.
Mataaho and Whakaru-au-moko (70) are the two who hold the power over the
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Tawhīri-matea (7) has power over the
winds. Te Ihorangi (10) rules the rain; and Kiwa (52) has the power to
gather the waters, and confine them, or loosen them; to spread them over
all places which they<span id="fr_17"></span>[17](#note_17.md) think
propter. Those mentioned are the directors of the snow-storms, rain, the
waters of the ocean, the earthquakes, volcanoes, and the fogs. These
were all the powers delegated to them by Io-te-wānanga
\[Io-the-omnierudite\].

   The five gods mentioned carried out the decree of Io-taketake
\[Io-origin-of-all-things\], which resulted in 'The
overturning-of-Mataaho' as it is called, and which we all know of. You
are now clear as to the <span id="page_182">p. 182</span> meaning of
that term—it was the original cause of the broken, mountainous,
appearance of the Earth.

   Now, in consequence of this great disturbance by the five gods Māui
said, "Leave my 'fish' \[the Earth\] to me; as a dwelling place for me
and my elder brethren and our descendants." This was the 'taking
possession,' enunciated at that time, and has remained so according to
the covenant of Māui; and Māui's name<span
id="fr_18"></span>[18](#note_18.md) became attached to this island, right
down to the present time. The words of Māui have been fulfilled, for we,
the descendants of those \[five\] Māuis now dwell here. All the people
who dwell here on this island and right away to Hawaiki, are all
descendants of those Māuis.

   As to the story about Māui's 'fishing up' of lands, it is a mere
'Winter Night's Tale,' told by people outside the Whare-wānanga; it is
certainly not a story handed down in that house of learning.

   But enough of my discourse on Māui. Do not ever diverge from what I
have told you. My \[learned\] companions are present and have heard what
I have said \[and if I had been wrong they would have corrected me\].

   Niwareka came up from Hades to this world; she came with a party of
Turehu \[female flaxen-haired people\], and on their arrival here above
they discovered Mataora \[a human being\] asleep in his house named 'Te
Rara-o-te-rangi.' So the party commenced to make fun of Mataora; and the
following discussion took place amongst them; some said he was a man;
others that he was an Apa \[a messenger-god\]; others again thought he
was a Mata-ruai \[meaning not known\]; others said he was a
Poporo-kewa<span id="fr_19"></span>[19](#note_19.md); others thought he was
a Ruao <span id="page_183">p. 183</span> \[meaning not known\], and
others thought he was just a man. Then said Niwareka, "I will have him
for my husband!" Whilst the Turehu were thus discussing, Mataora came
outside his house to look at the strangers, and he said to them, "Are
you females?" They replied by asking him, "Are you a male?" Mataora
turned his back to them, and stooped down, at which all the Turehu burst
out laughing, some saying, "He is a male!"<span
id="fr_20"></span>[20](#note_20.md) Others, "He is a man."

   Mataora now said to the company of Turehu, "Come inside my house so
that I may give you something to eat." The Turehu consented, but said
they would wait outside and the food could be given to them there. So
Mataora went to his store-house to fetch some food for his guests, and
then placed it before the Turehu. It was cooked food. Some of the Turehu
said, "Is it good?" Others said, "It is rotten!" But Mataora replied,
"No! It is quite good," and he ate some himself so that the Turehu might
see it was all right; on which some of them came and opened his mouth,
and said, "A! It is mussels!" Others said, "It is rotten food!" From
this Mataora knew that these people could not eat cooked food; so he
went to his fish pond and brought them some herrings. And then the
company of Turehu made a meal of them.

   Mataora looked on at the people and saw that one of them was
beautiful. When the feast was over, he took his *maipi* \[or halbert\]
and commenced dancing before the Turehus; after which he sat down. And
then the company of Turehus stood up to perform a *haka* \[or
posture-dance\] before Mataora. As they danced, one of the Turehu women
came in front of the others and danced backwards and forwards in
graceful attitudes, singing,

"Thus goes Niwareka, Niwareka,"

in which all the other Turehu joined. Their kind of *haka* was by
holding one another's hands and dancing with high stepping, whilst
others passed in and out under the arms of the rest, at the same time
singing, "Niwareka! Niwareka!" And then the haka of the people
ended.<span id="fr_21"></span>[21](#note_21.md)

   These people all had fair skins, and their hair was like the flowers
of the plant *toetoe* (*Arundo conspicua*, i.e., flaxen-haired); and
were beautifully built, with a straight upright mien. Their garments
were like sea-weed, and worn only as an apron in front. Their hair fell
down to their waists in thick tresses.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

   Mataora asked to have one of these women as his wife. They asked,
"Which of us would you like as a wife?" Mataora pointed out the most
beautiful one, which happened to be the daughter of Ue-tonga and
Manu-tionga; it was she who came before the others and danced backwards
and forwards.

   They were married, and dwelt together a long time. On one occasion
Mataora asked his wife what her name was, she replied, "It is Niwareka.
I am a high-born chieftainess, a daughter of Ue-tonga, I come from
Rarohenga \[Hades\].

   After a long time Mataora became jealous of his elder brother
Tau-toru<span id="fr_22"></span>[22](#note_22.md); he saw that he ardently
desired his wife. In consequence he thrashed his wife Niwareka; which
caused her to flee away to Rarohenga \[Hades\] to the home of her
ancestors and parents. A great sorrow fell on Mataora, and he deeply
lamented his beautiful wife.

 

   The tattooing of mankind in those days was only on the wing of the
nose, the summit or bridge of the nose, and the brow and temples—those
were all the parts tattooed on men. The tattooing on the women was a
single cross on the forehead, and one on each cheek. Another kind was
marks on the wings of the nose—they had no tattooing on the chin or the
lips \[as at present\]. This latter custom is modern and is derived from
the patterns carved on the *tahā* or calabash. All tattooing in those
ancient days was \[in reality only\] painting in blue clay and red clay
\[oxide of iron\]; the very dark skinned people were painted with white
and red clay. The ornamentation on the houses was also all painted—not
carved; and was called *kowaiwai*; or *hopara-makaurangi*; it was
painted in red and white clay, with parts in charcoal; these were the
only and original adornments in former times. Now, you understand what
the ancient tattooing was like.

 

   And now Mataora started off to search for his wife. When he reached
Tahua-roa in the country of Irihia,<span
id="fr_23"></span>[23](#note_23.md) there he found the dwelling of Te
Ku-watawata (23) and his companions at his house named Pou-tere-rangi
\[entrance to Hades\]. The original name of this house was Whare-kura;
the second, Rake-pohutukawa; the third, Hawaiki-o-Maruaroa<span
id="fr_24"></span>[24](#note_24.md) \[Hawaiki-of-the-Solstice\]—those are
all its names. The original name of this part \[of the Fatherland\] was
Rangi-tatau \[the Heavens-are-telling <span id="page_185">p. 185</span>
(or counting)\],<span id="fr_25"></span>[25](#note_25.md) and the second
name given to it was Tahua-roa \[which may be translated, 'the long
plain'\]. When the army of Whiro-te-tipua (6) was defeated at Te
Paerangi (see [p. 134](lww3.htm#page_134)) by Tu-mata-uenga (11.md) and
Tama-kaka (63) \[both names of gods\], the survivors, together with
Whiro himself, descended to Te Muri-wai-hou or Rarohenga \[Hades\], then
was the third name Taheke-roa \[the long rapid, or fall\] applied, as
has been explained. This house \[i.e., Hawaiki, see [p.
112](lww2.htm#page_112.md)\] had four doors, one opposite each cardinal
direction; it was from these doors that came forth the winds,<span
id="fr_26"></span>[26](#note_26.md) that spread forth the offspring of the
Sky-father and Earth-mother over the surface of their mother Earth; and
hence it is that the dead return from each quarter to its own particular
door.

   It was at this period the name Hawaiki-nui \[a name for the
Fatherland\] was given, and it is by that way the spirits pass on to
Taheke-roa. I have already explained that a division takes place within
this house; those spirits who have love for the Earth-mother proceed by
the road of Taheke-roa to Rarohenga \[Hades\], whilst those who love the
Sky-father proceed forth to the eastern door by way of the Ara-tiatia
\[way of steps, clouds, to the Supreme God Io\]. At this time was
finally determined the name of Whare-kura as Hawaiki-nui. But enough of
this.

   When Mataora arrived at Pou-tere-rangi \[the guard-house of Hades\]
he asked of Te Ku-watawata (33), "Did you not see a woman pass this
way?" Te Ku-watawata asked in reply, "What was she like?" Mataora said,
"She had an *ihu-rakau* \[a straight nose, with little or no dent at the
bridge—a Grecian nose, in fact—quite <span id="page_186">p. 186</span>
different to those of the Polynesians\] and long flaxen hair." Te
Ku-watawata replied, "A, yes! She has gone on long ago; she was crying
as she came along." Mataora then said, "Cannot I go to where she is?"
Said Te Ku-watawata, "You can go there quite well." Then he opened the
door of *angi-nuku* \[the door of Hades\] leading down to Hades.

   Mataora then descended, and, arriving at the middle of the descent he
met Ti-waiwaka \[the Fan-tail bird\] and asked, "What are the people
down below doing?" Ti-waiwaka replied, "Some are making the little heaps
of earth for the *kumara* \[Batatas tubers\]; some building houses; some
fishing; some tattooing; some flying kites; some whipping tops." Mataora
asked, "Did you see a woman pass this way?" Ti-waiwaka replied, "She has
gone on; her eyes were swollen, her lips were hanging down."

   So Mataoro went on until he came to a shed, at the village of
Ue-tonga, where were many people. He found Ue-tonga engaged in
tattooing; he sat down there to see the operation, and saw the blood
descending from the cuts in the face. He called out, "Your system of
tattooing the face is all wrong! It is not done in that manner up
above." Ue-tonga said, "This is the custom below here; that above is
quite wrong. That system is called by us *kowaiwai* \[i.e., painted\]."
Mataora in reply said, "*Hopara-makaurangi* is the name above." Ue-tonga
then said, "That kind of *moko* \[or face tattooing\] is used in house
building, and is then called *hopara-makaurangi*, or painting. If the
*moko* is done on a man it is called *tuhi*,<span
id="fr_27"></span>[27](#note_27.md) or painting." Mataora replied, "That is
called carving with us." Then Ue-tonga placed his hand on Mataora's face
and rubbed it—and all the *moko* came off! The people all burst out
laughing, and then Ue-tonga called out, "O ye above! O ye people of
above! Ye are quite wrong in calling it carving. Behold the face is
quite clean from rubbing. That is only painting. What we call carving
\[*whakairo*, also used for ornamentation of other kinds\] is that
practised by the women" \[in the ornamental borders of their mats\].
Ue-tonga then showed the garment on which the *taniko*,<span
id="fr_28"></span>[28](#note_28.md) ornamentation was apparent, at the same
time saying, "This is the woman's branch; whilst the man's branch is
this (showing the carved head of his wooden *maipi*, or halbert). "This
is <span id="page_187">p. 187</span> carving done on wood. If you go to
my house you will see what real carving is. As for that *moko* on you it
is only painting."

   Mataora now said to Ue-tonga, "You have destroyed the *moko* on my
face; you must turn to and tattoo me." Ue-tonga replied, "It is well!
Lie down!" Then Ue-tonga called on the artists to delineate the pattern
on Mataora's face.<span id="fr_29"></span>[29](#note_29.md) When this had
been done Ue-tonga sat down by the side of Mataora with his chisel and
commenced to tattoo him. Great was his pain and his groans. He then sang
his song:

<table data-align="center">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span class="small">Niwareka! that is lost, where art thou?<br />

'Twas love of thee that dragged me down here below,<br />
Niwareka! Niwareka! love eats me up!<br />
Niwareka! Niwareka! thou has bound me tight.<br />
Niwareka! Niwareka! Let us remain in this world,<br />
Niwareka! Niwareka! Leave behind this Hades,<br />
Niwareka! Niwareka, and thus end my pain.</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   When Ue-kuru, the younger sister of Niwareka, heard this, she ran off
to Taranaki where Niwareka was engaged in weaving a garment—named 'Te
Raupapa-nui'—for her father Ue-tonga, in the latter's house named
Aroaro-tea. Ue-kuru said to her sister, "There is a man over there who
is being tattooed; a very handsome man; who, whilst the operation was
going on, was crying and singing. The words of the song often repeated
your name." The female companions of Niwareka all said, "Let us all go
and see!" When Niwareka and her companions reached the court-yard where
the tattooing was going on, Ue-tonga was annoyed at their coming and
said, "What have you come here for?" Niwareka replied to her father, "To
fetch the visitor and take him to the village—he that stoops \[lies\]
there." Niwareka said to her younger sister, Ue-kuru, "Go and fetch him,
and lead him to the village."

   So Mataora was led off; and when they reached a Pohutukawa<span
id="fr_30"></span>[30](#note_30.md) tree growing there, they found the
place spread with mats. Then was heard the welcome of Niwareka and her
lady companions, who became enamoured with the appearance of Mataora.
She said to her friends, "His bearing is that of Mataora, whilst his
garments appear to be my make." When Mataora had sat down on the mats,
Niwareka asked, "Art thou Mataora?" He bowed his head and holding out
his arms towards Niwareka opened and shut his hands \[palm downwards—an
old Maori custom of asking to draw near\]. Niwareka then knew it was
<span id="page_188">p. 188</span> indeed Mataora, and she commenced the
usual *tangi* \[crying, at the meeting between friends\] over Mataora;
the *kauri*<span id="fr_31"></span>[31](#note_31.md) was like laughter!

   After Mataora had dwelt there for some time the news reached
Ranga-ahu, that Mataora was staying at Taranaki. Then \[the spirit of\]
Te Whiriran came to see him—he was a younger brother of Mataora's who
had been killed during the war at Hangarau which, I will explain later
on—this was his spirit. But Mataora would not consent to his brother's
proposal that he should accompany the latter to Ranga-ahu.<span
id="fr_32"></span>[32](#note_32.md) This was due to the custom of Hades;
when the *aroaro-waimate*<span id="fr_33"></span>[33](#note_33.md) of an
invalid in this world is strongly felt towards his relatives who have
preceded him to Rarohenga; those spirits came to fetch the sick man; or
in other cases to return the spirit of the invalid to its house, that
is, to its body. If the spirits of Rarohenga act in the second manner
above, the sick man will not die. But, if their object is to take the
spirit of the invalid with them, that man will surely die. But when the
days elapsing between the birth of any one and the period when his
navel-string drops off, are accomplished, then ends the time of
farewells of the spirits of the invalid to its relatives in this
world,<span id="fr_34"></span>[34](#note_34.md) and then the spirit of he
who is dying turns his face towards Whare-kura, that is, to Hawaiki-nui.
The company of spirits who come to fetch that of the dying man, lead it
to Whare-kura; and on arrival, the spirit is purified by the Pou-tiri-ao
\[or guardians\] of Whare-kura, and they subsequently let it proceed by
Te-ara-nui-a-Tāne \[the great-highway-of-Tāne (or of mankind)\] to
Rarohenga; or otherwise by the way of Te Toi-hua-rewa \[the
suspended-way\] to the conjoint Heavens. If the spirit goes to
Rarohenga, the spirits of that place conduct it. If it \[desires to\]
end in the conjoint Heavens, then the spirits of those Heavens conduct
it by the Toi-hua-rewa \[to Io the Supreme God\].

 

   Mataora, now said to Niwareka, "Let us both return to the Ao-tu-roa"
\[the long-standing-world—the Earth\]. She replied, "The customs of the
upper world are bad.<span id="fr_35"></span>[35](#note_35.md) Rather let us
remain below, <span id="page_189">p. 189</span> and gather our thoughts
and turn them from the evils of the upper world."

   *Mataora*: "We two will be able to effectually arrange that."

   *Niwareka*: "I will not consent without further thinking it over. But
I will talk over with my father and brothers what you say as to our
return."

   *Mataora*: "We two alone are concerned in this matter. Do not let
your father and brothers know of it."

   *Niwareka*: "All the world above, as also here below, has heard about
it already. Leave the course to be taken as I have said."

   So Niwareka told her father and brothers the reason of Mataora's
visit—to take her back to the Ao-tu-roa.

   *Ue-tonga*: "Mataora! Are you thinking about returning above?"

   *Mataora*: "Yes! Niwareka and I."

   *Ue-tonga*: "You go back, O Mataora! Leave Niwareka here. A custom of
the upper world is to beat women, is it not?"

   At this Mataora was consumed with shame. Tauwehe, the brother of
Niwareka, said to him, "Mataora! Abandon the upper world—the home of
evil—altogether, and let us both live down here. Cut off all above and
its evil ways, let all below with its better customs be separate."

   \[The Sage here states that the continuation of this conversation was
very lengthy, and that he did not care to abbreviate it because he might
be accused of ignorance. This led to a discussion, ending in the
omission of much matter.\]

   Mataora replied to Tauwehe, "I will in future adopt the methods of
Rarohenga in the upper-world." Then Ue-tonga said to him, "Mataora! Do
not let a repetition of the evil repute of the upper-world, reach here
below. You must see that the upper-world has its works of darkness,
whilst the under-world is really the 'world of light,' together with its
works." Now, you see from the words of Ue-tonga that in the Ao-tu-roa
\['world-of-long-standing,' or 'the enduring-light,' i.e., this ordinary
world\] alone are all evil and darkness, whilst in Rarohenga there are
none; there is no night there, but light alone and good works. Hence it
is that, even from the time of Hine-ahu-one,<span
id="fr_36"></span>[36](#note_36.md) her descendants, and even down to the
present time, not a single one has ever come back from there to this
world to live.

   After this Niwareka, her father and brother, consented that she and
her husband should return to this world. Ue-tonga said, "Mataora! <span
id="page_190">p. 190</span> Listen! When you return to the world do not
let a repetition of the evil deeds of the world be brought here."
Mataora replied, "Look on my *moko* \[face-tattoo\]; if it had been
painted it might be washed off, but as it is a *moko* cut in the flesh
by you it is permanent and cannot be washed out. I will adopt in future
the ways of this \[lower\] world and its works." After these farewell
words of Ue-tonga to Mataora, the former presented to the latter the
garment named 'Te Rangi-haupapa.'

   I had better complete the history of this garment. It was kept in
Pou-tere-rangi \[guard house of Hades\], and it became the original
pattern for the work of our women, such as can be seen to-day. The belt
named 'Te Ruruku-o-te-rangi' was added to the other garment, and
likewise has become a pattern for all later belts. It was from there
came \[the knowledge of\] these two properties, and one cannot be used
without the other. The garment of ancient days was a *paroha* \[i.e.,
fastened at the throat\], and girded by a belt—it was not like any of
the white-man's clothing put on over the head \[as a shirt\].

   The original patterns of 'Te Rangi-haupapa' was made by Niwareka,
from one belonging to Hine-rau-wharangi, daughter of Hine-ti-tama \[and
Tāne, see [p. 148](lww4.htm#page_148.md)\]. It is said that this garment
was named 'Rena,' and was the same name as that used by Ue-nuku during
his war with Whena, when the \[people of the\] bows of the canoe fought
with those in the stern. This was \[the occurrence called\] 'Iwi-katea,'
but the principal name of this war was 'Te Ra-tu-rua,' in which the
death of Ue-nuku's children was avenged.<span
id="fr_37"></span>[37](#note_37.md)

   So Mataora and Niwareka started to return to this upper world. When
they got to Pou-tere-rangi \[guard-house of Hades\], to the foot of the
ascent, there they found Ti-waiwaka; he was the guardian of the ascent.
Ti-waiwaka asked Mataora, "Where art thou going?" Mataora replied, "We
are returning to the world above." Said Ti-waiwaka, "Go back! The world
is now full of evil; but come again in Orongo-nui \[Summer\]." Mataora
asked, "In what month?" To which Ti-waiwaka replied, "In the month of
Tatau-uru-ora" \[November\].

   Mataora and Niwareka then returned to Taranaki \[a place in Hades\].
In November of the Summer they again went to the ascent where Ti-waiwaka
said to them, "Take our youngsters with you to lead you out—that is
Popoia \[the owl\] and Peka \[the bat\]." So they ascended accompanied
by their guides to the summit at Pou-tea where they found Patatai \[the
land rail\], who said, "Mataora! where art <span id="page_191">p.
191</span> thou going?" "To the world!" Said Patatai, "Take with you my
youngster to the world, and let him go free. You will cherish him, and
let him remain in the corner of the window \[of your house\] as a
dwelling place. O Sir! O Peka! here is thy nephew!" Mataora said,
"Presently he will be chased by the family of Tāne (68) \[Birds\]," to
which Patatai replied, "Leave him at the *tuāhu* \[altar\] of the
latrine, whilst Popoia and Peka, should be relegated to the night so
they may not be worried by the family of Tāne."

   This is the reason why the owl and the bat never appear in the
daylight, but always at night. There are three birds, the owl, the bat,
and the miromiro \[the wren\], which, if one of them appears in an
assemblage of men, it is a warning that some misfortune will happen to
that house. It is the same with the Patatai \[land rail\] and Ti-waiwaka
\[the Fan-tail\]. This is the reason that the two latter visit their
relations mentioned above.<span id="fr_38"></span>[38](#note_38.md) Māui
asked the Patatai, the Ti-waiwaka and the Tatahore to accompany him when
he went to Hades to try and destroy Hine-nui-te-po \[goddess of Hades,
see [p. 146](lww4.htm#page_146.md)\].

   Mataora, Niwareka and their company, now went on towards the
upper-world. When they reached Pou-tere-rangi \[the guard house of
Hades\] they found Te Ku-watawata (23) \[guardian of the entrance to
Hades\] there. He asked them, "Mataora! What are those properties
beneath you?" The latter replied, "The works of the world above are done
in the night; those of the under-world are done in the Ao-turama.<span
id="fr_39"></span>[39](#note_39.md) Night has been separated off to the
upper-world, and the daylight to the under-world. The second properties
are the *moko-whakatara* (wood-carving), *moko-whakanyao*
(face-tattooing), and *whakairo-paepae-roa* (ornamental pattern on the
border of *kaitaka* mats); also the family of Ti-waiwaka and Patatai,
who are travelling with us." Te Ku-watawata then asked Niwareka, "What
is in that bundle on your back?" She replied, "It is nothing; only our
old garments" \[in which she was deceiving her interlocutor.\]

   They now came to the door of Pou-tere-rangi, where Te Ku-watawata
again said, "Mataora! The very origin, sprouts, the roots are henceforth
cut off. The door of Pou-tere-rangi will never again be opened to \[the
living of\] the world. But only those of the night \[the spirits of the
dead\] will pass on to Rarohenga. The body will be separated off \[and
left\] above, the spirit alone shall tread both the upper and the lower
worlds." Mataora asked, "What is the reason for this?" <span
id="page_192">p. 192</span> Te Ku-watawata replied, "Te
Rangi-haupapa<span id="fr_40"></span>[40](#note_40.md) is with you! Why did
you conceal it?" Then Niwareka took the garment out of her bundle,
saying to Te Ku-watawata, "This is 'Te Rangi-haupapa,' leave it at 'the
origin, the sprouts and the roots,' in Pou-tere-rangi there to become a
pattern for the world and for Rarohenga." After these words of Niwareka
Te Ku-watawata said, "It shall remain permanently here, 'Te
Rangi-haupapa' will never be returned to Rarohenga, let it remain as a
pattern for the 'enduring world,'" which ended the matter.

   I will explain the words of Te Ku-watawata to Mataora and Niwareka:
'The very origin, sprouts and roots are henceforth cut off' means that
the door of Pou-tere-rangi leading to the 'Ara-whanui-a-Tāne' \[the
broad way of Tāne\] will never again be trodden by man's \[living\]
body, but rather will it be trodden by the spirits alone of this world
and by those of Rarohenga. Enough for that. Now for Niwareka's speech,
the 'Rangi-hau-papa' would remain permanently within Pou-tere-rangi as a
pattern for the world above; it would never return to Rarohenga. This is
the pattern by which all women are guided in weaving cloaks, that is,
the *taniko* \[pattern on the borders of the *kaitaka* cloaks\]. It was
Niwareka who made the facsimile of 'Te Rangi-haupapa' as has been
explained.

   Let us return to Mataora. After he had brought from Rarohenga that
branch of knowledge relating to carving, he built his *whare-tuahi*,
\[house in which the arts were taught—it was not a *tapu* house\], which
be named Po-ririta. All men gathered here to gaze on the tattooing on
Mataora's face. Tu-tangata said to him, "Would you be able to tattoo me
in the same fashion as your own?" Mataora replied, "I can!" So
Tu-tangata was tattooed by Mataora, and on completion the people <span
id="page_193">p. 193</span> looked at it and then said to Tu-tangata, "O
Tu! The *tiwhana* \[pattern on the temple\] is on your eyebrows! and the
*pihere* on the nostrils! Your tattooing is very badly done!" Hence the
adjunct to Tu-tangata's name, 'Tu-tangata-kino' \[ugly Tu-tangata\].

   After this Maru and Ue-kaihau were tattooed, and then for the first
time was seen the beauty of the work of the *kauri*.<span
id="fr_41"></span>[41](#note_41.md) When the news of this reached Awarau,
Tonga-nui \[? the Tonga group\], Rangi-atea \[? Ra‘iatea of the Society
group\], and Hui-te-rangiora—which are names of islands near
Ta-whiti-nui<span id="fr_42"></span>[42](#note_42.md)—a messenger was sent
asking Mataora to go to Irihia, \[one of the names of the Fatherland\]
to the home of Nuku-wahi-rangi, in order that they might see Mataora and
his tattooing. His tattooing was on the wings of the nose, the *pihere*,
the summit of the nose, and on the temples, which were all the designs
that Mataora brought from Rarohenga. It was this upper world that
completed the existing patterns; they were first carved on the finial
figure of the gable of a house by Nuku-te-aio and Rua-i-te-pupuke who
thus first made them known to the world. At this time Huru-waru the man
of Te Pipi-o-te-rangi was tattooed, and when the latter saw him he said,
"Moko-huruhuru \[hairy-tattoo\] shall be thy name."

   The tattooing of Niwareka was, two \[crosses\] on the forehead, two
on the cheeks; there was neither chin nor lip-tattooing at that time on
the women. In the times of Ti-whana-a-rangi, Ruhiruhi was tattooed on
the lips for the first time. The chin pattern of the women originated
here in this island \[New Zealand\], and was copied from a similar
pattern cut on the neck of the calabashes; it was first tattooed on
Ira-nui by Kahu-kura-nui, the pattern being first sketched by
Kahu-kura-kotare.<span id="fr_43"></span>[43](#note_43.md)

   Here ends my description of the origin of the *moko*
\[face-tattooing\]. I am not clear as to the origin of the tattooing on
the *rape* \[buttocks\]; it was never discussed \[in the
Whare-wānanga\].

*Here ends the 'Kauwae-runga,' the first part of  
'The Lore of the Whare-wānanga.'*

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1.md). It were easy to show from Mr.
Massey's book that there are many striking coincidences in both
incidents and names between Egyptian and Polynesian Myths, but this is
not the place. At the same time one may record here that many of his
Maori synonyms are not true.

<span id="footnotes_page_175">p. 175</span>

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2.md). In this connection a study of
Jnanendralai Majumdar's 'Eagle and the Sun,' published by the Indian
Research Society, should be consulted. The *Manu i te ra* (the bird in
the Sun) of Maori legend is possibly the Eagle of Indian Myth.

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3.md). 'Hawaiki,' 3rd edition, p. 68.

<span id="footnotes_page_176">p. 176</span>

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4.md). Rangi-riri, whether this same one
or not, is not clear, was the place from which all fish originated, and
the name is often quoted in the spells said to cause fish to bite.

<span id="footnotes_page_177">p. 177</span>

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5.md). Ngana-te-irihia has some magical
meaning; the translator's is, persistence-suspended. Ngana-te-wareware
is the same; it is translated, persistent-oblivion.

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6.md). These appear to be magical
expressions denoting the goddess' determination to destroy Māui's mental
powers, and consequently secure his death. Or, it is possible that the
goddess applied these charms to herself to cause a deep sleep.

<span id="footnotes_page_178">p. 178</span>

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7.md). That is, she came back to
consciousness of life from her sleep.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8.md). This account of the fire of Mahuika
is a mere brief illustration, and is not the full story. It is
interesting to note in the Sage's account the reference to volcanic
fire, for this is something quite new in the story hitherto told, and
probably explains the origin of it. It seems to suggest that fire was
originally obtained from a volcanoe, or at any rate that it was obtained
on a certain occasion. Mahuika is the god of volcanoes and earthquakes
amongst some branches of the race. The probability is that the 'Ahitoro'
is the remembrance of some volcanic eruption, when the lava set fire to
the country.

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9.md). The 'house' in the south from
whence came the cold winds, snow, hail, rain, etc.

<span id="footnotes_page_180">p. 180</span>

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10.md). Fish-hooks made with human bones
were supposed to possess great *măna*, or power, in catching fish.

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11.md). 'The Store-house-of-Kiwa'—Kiwa
(52) being one of the gods of ocean.

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12.md). One of the names for New Zealand
is 'Te Ika-a-Māui,' the fish-of-Māui; and this was the name learned by
Captain Cook, in 1769, under the form of 'He hīnga-no-Māui' (a
fishing-of Māui).

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13.md). Two of the guardians of the
'Heavenly treasures,' and special messengers of Io.

<span id="footnotes_page_181">p. 181</span>

<span id="note_14"></span>[14](#fr_14.md). The word used is *takapautia*,
which means, ended. But the Scribe says it means here, drowned.

<span id="note_15"></span>[15](#fr_15.md). The Earth, in these old myths,
takes on the form of a woman's body. In other words it means the four
quarters of the Earth; each people (or nation) was to be henceforth
separate.

<span id="note_16"></span>[16](#fr_16.md). The wars of the gods—see [p.
134](lww3.htm#page_134.md).

<span id="note_17"></span>[17](#fr_17.md). They, probably, includes
Tangaroa, the other god of ocean.

<span id="footnotes_page_182">p. 182</span>

<span id="note_18"></span>[18](#fr_18.md). That is 'Te
Ika-a-Māui'—'Māui's-fish,' a name for New Zealand.

<span id="note_19"></span>[19](#fr_19.md). These are Apa-atua, a species of
gods, dwelling in Te Rangi-tamaku, the next Heaven to the visible one.
This name has, however, in more modern times been applied to a people
dwelling in Fiji or Tonga, and may mean dark or black people, a name
probably applied to the Melanesians.

<span id="footnotes_page_183">p. 183</span>

<span id="note_20"></span>[20](#fr_20.md). *Toa* = male of animals.

<span id="note_21"></span>[21](#fr_21.md). The description of this dance is
entirely foreign to those performed by the Maoris or any other branch of
the Polynesian race I am acquainted with—it is more like some of the old
English dances, the May-pole dance for instance.

<span id="footnotes_page_184">p. 184</span>

<span id="note_22"></span>[22](#fr_22.md). Tautoru is a name for the
constellation of Orion.

<span id="note_23"></span>[23](#fr_23.md). Irihia is one of the names for
the Fatherland.

<span id="note_24"></span>[24](#fr_24.md). This appears to be the fifth
temple mentioned in the introduction to Chapter I.

<span id="footnotes_page_185">p. 185</span>

<span id="note_25"></span>[25](#fr_25.md). Just here we may suggest what is
perhaps a fanciful translation of this name; but anything that serves to
throw light on the former history and the whence of the people, even if
appearing now not quite apposite, may yet be of value in the future. I
suggest the following: Rangi, at one time, evidently meant a district, a
country, a realm, though at the present time it is not known as such,
but is, nevertheless, found in numerous place names where the other
meanings of *rangi* will not apply. Rangi-tatau may therefore mean the
place, or district of counting, and if so, it indicates a place where
the people were at one time enumerated—a census taken. And this points
to a higher civilization—as do many other things—at one time existing
amongst the Polynesians. Rangi-tatau, it will be noticed above is in
Irihia, the Fatherland, not the Heavens.

<span id="note_26"></span>[26](#fr_26.md). *Hau*, wind; but the word with
the causitive *whaka* before it means a 'command.' The Scribe tells me
that the teaching of the old Ruanukas was, that from this 'house'
Hawaiki, mankind spread to the four-quarters of the Earth, and the
spirits of the dead from those four quarters came back there after
death, carried by the wind from the quarters where they died—also a
Greek belief. This is the Hono-i-wairua, the junction, or meeting place
of spirits.

<span id="footnotes_page_186">p. 186</span>

<span id="note_27"></span>[27](#fr_27.md). *Tuhi* is the modern word for
writing; perhaps there is a good deal in the meaning.

<span id="note_28"></span>[28](#fr_28.md). This is the beautiful ornamented
border on the *kaitaka* cloaks, some of which is very handsome and
delicate; it takes a woman a year to weave a piece four feet long by one
foot wide.

<span id="footnotes_page_187">p. 187</span>

<span id="note_29"></span>[29](#fr_29.md). This was done by marking out in
charcoal where the chisel was to follow.

<span id="note_30"></span>[30](#fr_30.md). Pohutu-kawa is the *Metrosideros
tormentosa* tree of New Zealand.

<span id="footnotes_page_188">p. 188</span>

<span id="note_31"></span>[31](#fr_31.md). That is, the tattooing of his
face was beautiful; often the soot of the *kauri* tree is used as the
pigment in tattooing.

<span id="note_32"></span>[32](#fr_32.md). For fear he should not be
allowed to return to the World of Light.

<span id="note_33"></span>[33](#fr_33.md). Explained as the strong desire
of one who knows he has no hope of recovering from his illness—to depart
for the realm of the dead.

<span id="note_34"></span>[34](#fr_34.md). The Scribe says the days of
mourning for the dead are regulated by the length of the above period.
Probably this means for the relatives living with the defunct only.

<span id="note_35"></span>[35](#fr_35.md). It will be remembered she had
been beaten by her husband.

<span id="footnotes_page_189">p. 189</span>

<span id="note_36"></span>[36](#fr_36.md). The first woman; her daughter,
Hine-titama, became goddess of Hades, See [p. 144](lww4.htm#page_144.md).

<span id="footnotes_page_190">p. 190</span>

<span id="note_37"></span>[37](#fr_37.md). This war occurred in the
generation preceeding the emigration of the six well-known canoes to New
Zealand from Tahiti, in *circa* 1350.

<span id="footnotes_page_191">p. 191</span>

<span id="note_38"></span>[38](#fr_38.md). This is not at all clear.

<span id="note_39"></span>[39](#fr_39.md). A peculiar expression for the
light = the torch-lit world, or light-of-the torch.

<span id="footnotes_page_192">p. 192</span>

<span id="note_40"></span>[40](#fr_40.md). The garment given by Ue-tanga to
Mataora.

<span id="footnotes_page_193">p. 193</span>

<span id="note_41"></span>[41](#fr_41.md). *Kauri*-soot is a common pigment
for tattoo. We must suppose that a lengthy period had elapsed—perhaps
centuries—and after the people had arrived in Eastern Polynesia, before
the next incident comes in. Unless, indeed, the names of islands given
were those after which the present ones are named, and this seems
probable.

<span id="note_42"></span>[42](#fr_42.md). Tawhiti-nui, may be Tahiti-nui
of Eastern Polynesia, or, that Tawhiti-nui which was the second station
on the migration from the Fatherland, and which, in the Historical Part
to follow, I have identified with some probability as Borneo—probably
the latter is correct.

<span id="note_43"></span>[43](#fr_43.md). Kahukura-kotare was elder
brother of Tamatea-ariki-nui, high chief and leader of the 'Takitimu'
migration from Tahiti to New Zealand in about 1350.
