<P>[T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> previous two Chapters are from the teaching of Te Matorohanga. We shall in this Chapter follow that of Nepia Te Ika Pohuhu, of the Ngati-Hine-pare tribe, one of those who Te Matorohanga frequently mentions as equally learned with himself. What follows was taught to H. T. Whatahoro in April, and the following months, 1863, who wrote it down from the old priest's dictation. The whole of Pohuhu's teaching has been passed by the Tane-nui-a-rangi Committee, and each page of the original is sealed with their seal, thus showing that it meets with the assent of all the most learned men of the present time belonging to the East Coast tribes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same matter as contained in this Chapter has also been dictated by Te Matorohanga to the same Scribe, a copy of which is deposited in the Dominion Museum; but we have made use of Pohuhu's teaching, because it is not so long as the other; at the same time it contains every essential part of the teaching relating to the gods, and where necessary this Chapter will be illustrated from the matter in the Dominion Museum copy, of which the original from which it was taken, now lies before the Translator. If funds be forthcoming hereafter, Te Matorohanga's teaching may also be printed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pohuhu's teaching on the subject of Io, the Supreme God, is identical with that of Te Matorohanga given in last Chapter, and is therefore not repeated here.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above are the names of the Heavens in their order as they stand above us [the first being the summit; number twelve, the sky above and nearest to the earth]. Those twelve Heavens are where the Apa-atua [the messenger-gods, or, perhaps, the company of gods] of each Heaven move to and fro. There is only one Heaven that cannot be attained by these Apa&#8212;the Toi-o-nga-rangi, or, otherwise, Tikitiki-o-rangi; this is the most sacred of all the Heavens, and Io alone, with the Apa-Whatu-kura [the company of male guardians, or gods] and Apa-Marei-kura [the company of female guardians, or godesses] of that Heaven dwell there. The Marei-kuras and the Whatu-kuras have the entr&eacute;e to all the eleven Heavens, and even down to the earth. It is only when Io sends his messengers to one of the Apas of the twelve Heavens that they are allowed into Tikitiki-o-nga-rangi. They never enter it without permission.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tawhiri-rangi is the name of the house through which entry is obtained into [the uppermost Heaven]. Underneath it is the mouth, or the door, called Te Pu-motomoto-o-Tikitiki-o-rangi; that is, it is the door of entry into Tawhiri-rangi, within which house are the guardians of Te Pu-motomoto&#8212;very numerous are they, viz., the Puhi-tau [general name for the different winds that guard the entrance], Maioro-rangi, [Rampart-of-Heaven], Houere-tu [winds blowing upwards], Houere-tau [fighting winds], and other numerous Apas.<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> None of the Whatu-kura of the other [and lower] Heavens, not a single one, may enter; unless Rua-tau, Aitu-pawa, Rehua, Puhao-rangi or Tau-o-rongo,<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> who alone have the authority, open the circular-window, or the Pu-moto-moto, and allow some one Apa to enter, whether from the eleven Heavens, the earth, or any other place. But there is much about this subject. I am not able to recite it all.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN AND EARTH.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rangi-nui [great sky], which stands above, felt a desire towards Papa-tua-nuku [the earth], whose belly was turned up [towards him]; he desired her as a wife. So Rangi came down to Papa. In that period the amount of light was nil; absolute and complete darkness [<I>po-kutikuti kakarauri</I>] prevailed; there was no sun, no moon, no stars, no clouds, no light, no mist&#8212;no ripples stirred the surface of ocean; no breath of air, a complete and absolute stillness.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so Rangi-nui dwelt with Papa-tua-nuku as his wife; and then he set [<I>hikaia</I> = <I>whakato</I>, to set, plant] plants to cover the nakedness of Papa; for her armpits, her head, and the body; and after that the smaller trees to clothe them both, for the body of the earth was naked. Subsequently he placed the upstanding trees of the forest, and now Papa felt a great warmth, which was all-embracing. After this were placed the insects of all kinds, the <I>aitanga-pekepeketua</I> [the ancestors of the <I>tuatara</I>, great lizard], appropriate to the recesses of the smaller vegetation, the clumps of smaller trees, and the <I>wao-tu-rangi</I>, the great forests [whose heads reach the skies]. Then the crabs, the <I>toitoi</I> [the larger species of univalves], the <I>pipi</I> [the bivalves] the <I>ngakihi</I>,<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#note_3"><FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT></A> the mussel, the haliotis, and similar things, which have shells, were assigned their places to animate the earth and the waters thereof. A great deal might be said on this subject; but let this suffice. Te Matorohanga can fully explain&#8212;I might go wrong.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">CREATION OF THE GODS.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last of all these things had been planted by Rangi-nui and Papa, they then created their [proper] offspring [i.e., the gods]; the eyes were made first,<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#note_4"><FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT></A> and then the 'house' to hold them, i.e., the head. After the head, the bust and body and the bones of the legs, according to their growth [shapes].<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#note_5"><FONT SIZE=1>5</FONT></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Rangi-nui overlaid and completely covered Papa-tua-nuku, the growth of all things could not mature, nor could anything bear fruit [or increase]; they were in an unstable condition, floating about the Ao-pouri [the world of darkness], and this was their appearance: some were crawling [after the manner of lizards], some were upright with the arms held up, some were lying with the knees partly drawn

<!------------------------page 118------------------------>

<A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A>

up, some lying on their sides, some were lying stretched out at full length, some on their backs, some were stooping, some with their heads bent down, some with their legs drawn up, some embracing, some kicking out with legs and arms, some kneeling, some standing, some inhaling deep breaths, some with exhausted breath, some crawling, some walking, some feeling about in the dark, some arising, some gazing, some sitting still, and in many other attitudes&#8212;they were all within the embrace of Rangi-nui and Papa.<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#note_6"><FONT SIZE=1>6</FONT></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is the list of names of [the minor gods] the family of Rangi and Papa:&#8212;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the existence of the gods was such as has been explained [i.e., within the embrace of their parents, and in the attitudes described above]. The names of the P&#333; or ages, or &aelig;ons, during which they dwelt there, are as follows:&#8212;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was after this manner that they dwelt in P&#333;, within the space included in the embrace of their parents. It was very long that condition of affairs existed; until at last a faint glimmering of light, a scintillation like the light of a star was seen, or like the Will-o-the-wisp at night. And now commenced a desire on the part of the family of gods to go forth from between their parents to follow the faint appearance of light. Some of them [the gods] consented, some did not; and thus it became a matter of strife between them. T&#257;ne (68), Tu-pai (69)<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#note_11"><FONT SIZE=1>11</FONT></A> and others said, "Let us seek a means by which we may go forth." The matter was then assented to. Now Uru-te-ngangana (1) the eldest of the family had been persuaded by Whiro-te-tipua's (6) arguments against going forth, and hence they remained until the last.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE GODS GO FORTH TO THE WORLD OF LIGHT.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at a certain time after [that discussion] Ue-poto (28) went to bathe and wash away the clammy feeling arising through the warmth of their dwelling place [within the embrace of their parents]. He was carried away outside on the current of their mother's urine, and found himself outside in a gentle cooling breeze, which was sweet scented in the nostrils of Ue-poto. He thought, this is the best place, here outside, so he called out under the sides of his parents: "O sirs! Come outside, for this is a pleasant place for us."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the menstruous time of their mother Earth came, then T&#257;ne (68) came forth. This was in the seventh P&#333;, or age of their desire to search for the "way of the female"<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#note_12"><FONT SIZE=1>12</FONT></A> in order to go forth. On reaching the outside world, they then saw that it was indeed a pleasant place for them [to dwell]. There was, however, a drawback; for the different kinds of the cold of Heaven [or space], Wero-i-te-ninihi, Wero-i-te-wawana, K&#365;na-wiri, Maeke, and Kotokoto, there spread out their intense cold.<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#note_13"><FONT SIZE=1>13</FONT></A> Hence, did Rangi and Papa closely embrace [to exclude the cold from ther offspring], and, hence, also originated the 'goose-flesh,' and trembling through cold [from which mankind suffers to this day]. These are the enemies that afflicted the family<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#note_14"><FONT SIZE=1>14</FONT></A> of their father. In consequence of this, they sheltered under the sides of their mother, where they found warmth, which they named <I>Whakaruru-taha</I> [shelter-by-the-side], which name came down to us, and is applied to a warm and pleasant place where no winds blow.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, when the ninth and tenth ages had come, Uru-te-nga-ngana (1) and others came forth&#8212;they formed the second party; and then Whiro-te-tipua (6) and his friends were urged to come forth. He did so with anger, and afflicted some of the other gods with baldness on top of the head and the same on the forehead, the eyelashes and eyebrows [which have descended to mankind through Whiro's action]. Great indeed was the wrath of Whiro (6) at T&#257;ne (68) because of his inducing them to come forth from [the shelter of] their parents,to be 'bitten' by Wero-i-te-ninihi, Wero-i-te-wawana, and, Wero-i-te-kokota [the cold of space]&#8212;that was the cause of his anger.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE SEPARATION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time after the foregoing events T&#257;ne (68) said, "Let us now separate our parents that Rangi and Papa may occupy different places." Whiro (6) would not consent to this proposition, and there was much strife in consequence. But T&#257;ne-nui-a-rangi (68) became more urgent; and then Tangaroa (8), Tu-mata-uenga (11), and Tawhiri-matea (7) finally agreed. And now Rangi-nui [the Sky-father], was propped up into the position he now holds. In the propping up by T&#257;ne (68) with the four props, one was placed at the head, one on each side, and one at the legs, making the four that separated Rangi from Papa. [Compare this belief in the four props with the similar one of the Egyptians.] But as the props were lifted and Rangi was still suspended in space, one at the legs and one at the head slipped.<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#note_15"><FONT SIZE=1>15</FONT></A> T&#257;ne called out to Paia,<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#note_16"><FONT SIZE=1>16</FONT></A> "O Pai!" Paia replied, "Here am I!" T&#257;ne said, "Raise him up above." In this uplifting and raising in order that Rangi-nui might float above, he did not quite rise to the position required, because the arms of both Rangi and Papa grasped one another and held fast. Then T&#257;ne called out to Tu-mata-kaka (63) and Tu-mata-uenga (11), telling them to fetch an axe to cut the arms of their parents. Tu-mata-kaka asked, "O T&#257;ne! Where is the source of axes to be found?" T&#257;ne said, "Fetch one from the pillow of our elder brother, Uru-te-ngangana (1), to cut them with. Fetch a handle from Tua-matua (59), who will put a keen edge on the axe and fasten it to its handle." The two axes, named 'Te Awhio-rangi' and 'Te Whiro-nui,' were then fetched<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#note_17"><FONT SIZE=1>17</FONT></A>; and then the arms of Rangi-nui and Papa-tua-huku were severed and they were completely separated. At that time Paia cut off from the neck of Rangi-nui the <I>Ahi-tapu</I>, or sacred fire, which he subsequently used to make fire with, using his <I>karakia</I>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when Rangi-nui had been properly placed in position as is now to be seen, the blood from the arms dripped down on to Papa [the Earth], and hence is the <I>horu</I> [red oxide of iron], and the <I>pukepoto</I> [blue phosphate of iron], that his descendants in this world use in painting.<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#note_19"><FONT SIZE=1>19</FONT></A> And hence also is the red appearance that inflames the skies at sunrise or sunset&#8212;that is the blood of Rangi's arms.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE APAS, OR MESSENGERS OF THE GODS.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now describe the nature of the Apas of each division of the twelve heavens, thus:&#8212;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Apas<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#note_20"><FONT SIZE=1>20</FONT></A> are those that dwell in Te Toi-o-nga-rangi [the highest Heaven] as follows: The Apa-Whatukura are males; the Apa-Marei-kura are females. When these Apas travel it is appropriate to refer to them as the 'Company of Whatu-kuras,' and 'Company of Marei-kuras.' It is these Apas alone who visit Io-nui in Toi-o-nga-rangi [the summit of the heavens]. On Io's command only [can the others] enter there, that is, whenever Io wishes them to do so can they enter the Toi-o-nga-rangi; they will not presume to do so otherwise, because that Heaven is sacred to Io and his particular company [of Apas] as explained before.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Company of Whatu-kuras, and the Apa-Marei-kuras [of the uppermost heaven] are able to [freely] enter any of the other eleven heavens, that is, to enter where they like, whether in the Heavens or the Earth&#8212;they have power to do that. It is just the same with the

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at this time the family of gods proceeded to arrauge the <I>kaupeka</I><A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#note_21"><FONT SIZE=1>21</FONT></A> of Rangi-nui, that is, to direct matters so that they might be able to adopt a course leading to their benefit.

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE SEPARATION OF THE DWELLINGS OF THE GODS.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They now decided to have separate dwelling-places. Whiro-te-tipua (6), Uru-te-ngangana (1), and their immediate friends dwelt in Tu-te-aniwaniwa ['where-stands-the-rainbow']&#8212;that was their house, and the place where they lived.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE SANCTIFICATION OF TANE.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at this period, Io-matua [the supreme god, the father] said unto Rua-matua and Rehua [two of the guardians of the heavenly treasures], "Go ye down to the Earth, and on Maunga-nui [great mountain] command T&#257;ne (68) and Tupai (69) to ascend to ye up the mountain.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these two Whatu-kuras, Rua-tau and Rehua, descended to the summit of Maunga-nui, and commanded T&#257;ne and Tupal to climb up to them. The two [gods] did so, and on reaching Rua-tau and Rehua, they were taken to the 'waters of Rongo' and baptised. Thus were they purified; and now for the first time did T&#257;ne (68) receive his full name of T&#257;ne-nui-a-rangi [Great T&#257;ne-of-the-Heavens], whilst Tupai received that of Tupai-a-tau [? so called after Rua-tau]. After this Rua-tau and Rehua re-ascended to Te Toi-o-nga-rangi [the uppermost Heaven] to Io-mata-ngaro [Io-the-hidden-face], whilst T&#257;ne-nui-a-rangi and Tupai-a-tau returned to their dwelling place at Huaki-pouri.</P>

<TABLE CELLPADDING=10>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.</TD><TD>This was the seventh cause of Whiro-te-tipua's illfeeling; the sanctification, and the baptism of those new names for T&#257;ne-nui-a-rangi and Tupai-a-tau.</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these events Io-taketake [Io-the-origin of all things] said to Rua-tau and Aitu-pawa [Treasure-guardians of heaven]: "Go! Ask of the family of Rangi-nui [the Sky-father] which single one of them will be able to ascend the Toi-hua-rewa<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#note_25"><FONT SIZE=1>25</FONT></A> of the Heavens to Tikitiki-o-rangi [the uppermost heaven] to meet me at Matangi-reia" [the sun's path in the Heavens, the home of Io]. Then these two, Rua-tau and Aitu-pawa, descended to Tu-te-aniwaniwa [one of the separate houses in which the gods dwelt after coming forth from the parental embrace], and laid their mission before Uru-te-ngangana (1) and Whiro (6) and their faction.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whiro informed them that he could climb up by the winds of Heaven, and bring back the <I>w&#257;nanga</I> [all knowledge, etc.]. Rua-tau asked, "By what way wilt thou climb, O Whiro?" The latter answered, "By the 'Taepatanga'<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#note_26"><FONT SIZE=1>26</FONT></A> of the Heavens Will I ascend." "<I>Tai hiti, tai wawa</I>!" replied Aitu-pawa, "You will not succeed, for the winds of the conjoint Heavens are <I>akaaka</I>" [difficult to overcome&#8212;an uncommon word].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two gods then went to Whare-kura [another of the houses of the gods], and Rua-tau asked, "Which of you is able to ascend the conjoint Heavens to the Toi-o-nga-rangi, to Io-the-origin-of-all-things?" Rongo-marae-roa (14) and his faction replied, that T&#257;ne-nui-a-rangi (68) could accomplish it. The two messengers then went to Huaki-pouri [T&#257;ne's house] and asked them, "Which of you will be able to

Then said Ruatau, "By which way will you ascend?" T&#257;ne replied, "I will ascend by the Ara-tiatia, the Toi-hua-rewa<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#note_28"><FONT SIZE=1>28</FONT></A> of the family of my elder brother, Tawhiri-matea (7) [god of winds], who dwells above in Tihi-o-manono."<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#note_29"><FONT SIZE=1>29</FONT></A> Ruatau and &#8216;Pawa then said, "Enough! Ascend to the Pumotomoto [entrance to] Tikitiki-o-rangi [highest Heaven], to Tawhiri-rangi [guard house of] Te Toi-o-nga-rangi-tuhaha [summit of all the Heavens]." After that Ruatau and Aitu-pawa returned.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Hearing of this] Whiro (6) said unto to his elder brethren, "I intend to go and fetch the <I>w&#257;nanga</I> [knowledge] at Te Toi-o-nga-rangi." Uru-te-ngangana (1) and others said, "Leave our younger brother to fetch it&#8212;he who has ascended Maunga-nui and Maunga-roa, and been consecrated to the Au-kume, Au-rona, and Au-ihiihi."<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#note_30"><FONT SIZE=1>30</FONT></A> Whiro was very wroth at this and said, "Who, indeed, has said, that he, a younger son, will ascend above through all the Heavens?"</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE FIRST TEMPLE IS BUILT ON EARTH.<BR>
AND OTHER HOUSES.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&#257;ne-nui-a-rangi (68) now urged his brethren, saying, "Tamakaka (63), Tupai-a-tau (69), Rongo-marae-roa (14) and Tawhiri-matea (7); let us all go to Rangi-tamaku [the eleventh Heaven from the summit] and obtain the design of Whare-kura and build a similar one here [on earth]; in which to deposit the <I>tah&#363;</I><A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#note_31"><FONT SIZE=1>31</FONT></A> of the <I>w&#257;nanga</I> of the Heavens." Tawhire-matea (7) consented to this. When they reached Rangi-tamaku, they carefully copied the design of the temple; it was a temple for dwelling in; they measured the pillars, the length of the ridge and

<A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A>

the house, the width and the height. That house belonged to Nuku-te-aio, father of Rua-i-te-pukenga,<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#note_32"><FONT SIZE=1>32</FONT></A> who disclosed to T&#257;ne the location of that house. That house was a <I>matarua</I>, that is, having two windows, one on each side of the door.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their return they built Whare-kura as a depository for the knowledge which Ruatau and &#8216;Pawa had told one of the family to fetch. So they built and finished it&#8212;[the first Whare-kura or Temple of learning on Earth, from the design of which in succeeding ages all other Temples were built].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this was built Te Whare-rangi, the house of Tamakaka (63), and some others; it had only one window on the right-hand side of the door. This kind of house [in modern times] is called a <I>matahi</I>. Then they built the house of Tupai (69) named Rangi-pukohu. When that was completed they erected a house for T&#257;ne (68) and Tangaroa (8), named Hui-te-ana-nui, a very large house, with four windows, two in front, two behind; such a house is [now] called a <I>mata-wha</I>. This house was richly carved, the pillars, the ridge, the rafters, the barge-boards, the purlins, the battens, the central pillars, the back and front pillars, and the front enclosure of the porch&#8212;all were carved.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then was erected the house of Tu-mata-uenga (11) [god-of-war] named Te Roroku-o-te-rangi. This was the most sacred house of them all, exceedingly great was its <I>tapu</I>, as much so as that of Whare-kura. Here were kept the weapons of war, and all pertaining thereto, and to the ritual or <I>karakia</I> [incantation, etc.], and the gods [images] of that particular profession.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that was built the house of Rongo-marae-roa (14) [god of peace, agriculture, etc.] named Hao-whenua. It was built as a house in which all agricultural implements [? and the teaching thereof] were deposited. These are all I remember.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the events described above, the ascent of T&#257;ne-nui-a-rangi (68) to Te Toi-o-nga-rangi was considered by the gods. Whiro-te-tipua (6) was most urgent that he should go on before; so he proceeded by way of the Taepatanga [edge of the sky] of the Heavens to climb up above. Whiro had proceeded on his way for a long distance, when T&#257;ne told his elder brethren, Tawhiri-matea, Tama-kaka and Tupai-a-tau that they ought to start. So they went, aided by the family of Para-wera-nui ['a mighty southerly tempest.'&#8212;see Journal Polynesian

<P>These then were the families of Tawhiri-matea, who carried T&#257;ne to the Pu-motomoto [the entrance] of Tawhiri-rangi [guard-house to the uppermost heaven]. His companions were Uru-ao (51), Rangi-ihiihi-matua (? 27), Tu-kapua (40), Tawhiri-matea (7), Taka-wai-rangi and Te Ataata-o-te-rangi; these last accompanied Tane to Rangi-naonao-ariki [the third heaven counting downwards] to Kautu and Tapuhi-kura, who were the spirits whose duty it was to take [T&#257;ne] to Tauru-o-te-rangi [the name of the entrance into the third heaven], where T&#257;ne was purified by Kautu and Tapuhi-kura. Tawhiri-matea, Uru-ao and Rangi-ihiihi-matua returned from here to Earth, whilst Te Ataata-o-te-rangi and Taka-wai-rangi carried T&#257;ne to Tiritiri-o-matangi [heaven below the summit].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In the meantime] Whiro had ascended to Rangi-nui and Rangi-tamaku [the two lowest heavens] where he learnt that T&#257;ne had passed on before him; he followed to Rangi-parauri [tenth heaven in descent] but did not overtake him. Here his son-in-law said to him, "Go back! You cannot succeed, for that man [T&#257;ne] has been consecrated above on Maunga-nui by Rua-tau and Rehua."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the above occurrence, T&#257;ne was conducted into Matangi-reia [the house of Io&#8212;Sun's path in the Heavens] where Io was awaiting him. On his arrival Io asked him:&#8212;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is thy companion?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My elder brother, Whiro-te-tipua. He went by way of the Taepatanga of the Heavens, to ascend."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thy elder brother will not succeed; the winds of the conjoint Heavens blow too strongly."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io added, "What is thy reason for ascending here?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacred contents of the 'baskets' pertaining to the Sky-father and Earth-mother to obtain; hence have I ascended up to thee, O Io, &#275; &#299;!"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io then said, "Let us go to the Rauroha" [space outside Io's dwelling, the <I>marae</I> or plaza], and when they got there, then for the first time was seen how numerous were the Whatu-kura [male guardian gods] and Marei-kura [female guardian goddesses] there staying. T&#257;ne was again purified in Rauroha, and after this had been accomplished, they entered the temple Rangiatea [treasure house, and the first of the Whare-w&#257;nanga&#8212;see introduction to Chapter I.]. It was here that the Whatu-kuras gave into T&#257;ne's charge, the three 'baskets' and the two sacred stones. They were 'god-stones' [i.e., endowed with god-like and miraculous powers].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, after the three 'baskets' of the <I>w&#257;nanga</I> [knowledge] and the two stones had been acquired, the Whatu-kuras [gods] escorted T&#257;ne-te-w&#257;nanga (68) and his properties to the next lower Heaven. Rua-tau, Rehua, Aitu-pawa were there, and a numerous host of other Whatu-kuras in the company.

were many others besides. Te Matorohanga will be able to name them all in their ranks.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&#257;ne-matua (68) and his companions, the Whatu-kuras, descended until they reached Rangi-te-wawana [the fourth heaven from the summit] where they were attacked by the war-party of Whiro-te-tipu (6)&#8212;these are their names:&#8212;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the face of Rangi-nui [the sky above, lowest Heaven] flashed forth in brilliant red. Hence did Tupai (69), Uepoto (28), Tamakaka (63), Uru-roa, Tama-te-kapua (? 44), Tu-mata-uenga (11) Tangaroa (8), and Tawhiri-matua (7), know that the <I>w&#257;nanga</I> had been acquired by T&#257;ne-matua (68). Great was the joy, and the rejoicing of the family of gods, even including those at Tu-te-aniwaniwa [the

<A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A>

dwelling-place of Whiro (6) and Uru-te-ngangana (1)]. But Whiro alone was not glad; he was continuously angry and jealous on account of the exceeding <I>m&#259;na</I> [power, prestige] that had accrued to T&#257;ne-matua (68). And now Uru-ao (51) and Tupai took their trumpets and sounded a fanfare; they were named 'Te Wharara-o-te-rangi' [the arch of Heaven] and 'Pu-oro-rangi ' [trumpet sounding in Heaven]. The whole of the family of gods heard the trumpet blasts, and knew thereby that T&#257;ne-matua had succeeded in his quest.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the party arrived at the <I>turuma</I><A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#note_40"><FONT SIZE=1>40</FONT></A> of Whare-kura [the first temple built on earth], and after the purification ceremony, they entered Whare-kura and there suspended the three <I>w&#257;nanga</I> at the back of the temple, where also the two <I>whatu</I> [stones] were deposited. Whiro (6) demanded that the 'baskets' and stones should be delivered up to him. T&#257;ne-matua (68) said to him, "Where are others to be found if we agree to that? It is sufficient that you have some of our elder brethren with you; the 'baskets' must be left with these members of our elder and younger brethren." Rongo-marae-roa (14) and Uru-te-ngangana (1) both consented to this. Whiro was very angry at this and returned home with two of the <I>whatu</I> [stones].<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#note_41"><FONT SIZE=1>41</FONT></A> After this the Whatu-kuras [gods] returned to Te Toi-o-nga-rangi [Uppermost Heaven].</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE GUARDIAN ANGELS OR SPIRITS ARE APPOINTED.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at this period the attention of T&#257;ne-matua (68) and his elder and younger brethren was turned to the separation of the Pou-tiri-ao [Guardian Angels] to their different spheres of action in their separate places, by twos and threes, to each plane of the Earth, the Heavens, and even the Ocean. Thus was the work directed; and the valuable contents of the three 'baskets' were distributed [i.e., as the baskets contained all knowledge and directions for the government of the world and its contents, some branches were allocated to the different guardians to enable them to rule in their separate spheres, and thus become the presiding dieties of different classes of phenomena].

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE WARS OF THE GODS.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the hatred and jealousy of Whiro (6) and his faction towards T&#257;ne-matua (68) had become permanent. Whiro would not give his consent to the appointment of the Pou-tiri-ao to their respective spheres. His elder brethren said to him, "Leave to our younger brother the direction and the power; he has acquired the <I>kauwae-runga</I> [knowledge of Celestial things]. As for you, all you have initiated has ended in disaster, even from the very beginning down to the present time." Much strife ensued, until Uru-te-ngangana [the first born of the gods] separated himself from Whiro, and departed for the home of his younger brother, Rongo-marae-roa (14) [god of agriculture] and his party, and to Huaki-pouri [T&#257;ne's dwelling]. The dissentions between the various factions of the gods now became permanent, leading to actual war; Whiro-te-tipua (6) was defeated; the general name for this war was Pae-rangi, and the names of the different battles were:&#8212;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of it was that Whiro-te-tipua was defeated, and that was the reason he descended to Raro-henga [Hades]&#8212;hence is that fatal descent of his named Taheke-roa [the eternal fall]. The true [or general] name of this [series of] battles is Te Pae-rangi.

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE OVERTURNING OF MOTHER-EARTH.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before T&#257;ne-nui-a-rangi (68) ascended by the Ara-tiatia [the way of steps] to Te Toi-o-nga-rangi-taupuru [the overhanging (overcast) summit of Heaven&#8212;the Uppermost Heaven], and after the Sky-father and Earth-mother had been separated, the face [front] of their mother had been overturned so that she faced Hades. The youngest child of these parents, named Whakaru-ai-moko (70) was at that time a child at the breast. They left this child as a comfort<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#note_44"><FONT SIZE=1>44</FONT></A> for their mother. Now, hence [through Whakaru-ai-moko (70)] are the earthquakes, and volcanic phenomena that constantly war against us in every age.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why they [the gods] overturned the Earth to face downwards to Rarohenga was because she continually lamented for Rangi-nui [the Sky-father], and because Rangi-nui constantly lamented over her; that is, this was the nature of her lamenting, she continuously closed the avenues of light by means of clouds and mists, whilst Rangi-nui constantly obscured things by his tears, both day and night; that is, the rain was constant, never ceasing, as was the snow, the black-frost, the driving snow. The family of gods were perishing with the rain and the snow, and hence did they overturn their mother to face downwards to Rarohenga. After this their condition was much ameliorated. But they still dwelt in [a faint light] like the moonlight of this earth, because neither stars, the moon, nor the sun had been placed in position.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name given by Ruatau [one of the guardians of the heavenly treasures, a messenger of Io's] to this world was this: He said to the Sky-father and Earth-mother "Let your offspring go forth and dwell. Leave them to move about on you two." He added, "Do not continue to enclose them between [your bodies]. Let them go forth to Tahora-nui-a-teu<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#note_45"><FONT SIZE=1>45</FONT></A> and therein move about." Hence, we learn the name given

<!------------------------page 136------------------------>

<A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A>

by Ruatau to this world&#8212;'Tahora-nui-a-Ruatau.'<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#note_46"><FONT SIZE=1>46</FONT></A> It was Hine-titama<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#note_47"><FONT SIZE=1>47</FONT></A> that gave the [commonly used] name of Te Ao-tu-roa [the enduring light] to this world. It was thus that her relative, Te Kuwatawata (23) spoke to her, saying, "O Lady! Return hence! Here ceases the world of light. Beyond me is the-darkness-ever-present."<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#note_48"><FONT SIZE=1>48</FONT></A> Hine-titama replied to him, "Let me remain there that I may catch the living spirit of my descendants [mankind] in the world-of-everlasting-light." We learn by this that Hine-titama gave this world its name [Te-ao-tu-roa].</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE ORDER OF CREATION.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, after the wars of the gods, Whiro (6) and his younger brethren, Tu-mata-uenga (11) and others as above written, the appointment of the Pou-tiri-aos [guardian spirits] to their functions in the planes of Rangi-nui [the Sky-father], Papu-tua-nuku [the Earth-mother], and to Lady-ocean, was duly completed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then they completed the various beings to dwell in the great ocean, the waters of the earth, the trees, not to mention the reptiles [or insects], for they are really the lice of the Earth-mother; hence, are they called Te Whanau-a-Torohuka [the family (or descendants) of Torohuka]. At this time came the command of Rua-tau and Rehua [two of the guardians of the Heavenly treasures and messengers of Io] to T&#257;ne-matua (68) saying: "Honour the offspring of Torohuka and Muhumuhu as friends for you all. Some are evil, some are good." The words of those two Whatu-kuras referred to the <I>ngarara</I> [reptiles, insects]; for they were the first created of all living things. Thus:&#8212;</P>

<P><A NAME="note_8"></A><A HREF="#fr_8">8</A>. The foregoing list has been taken from Te Matorohanga's teaching, for old Pohutu says he had forgotten some, but that the former priest would sure to be right. The numbers opposite each name will enable the reader to identify them in the narratives which follow. Seventy is the proper number of these secondary gods.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_9"></A><A HREF="#fr_9">9</A>. Professors Nettleship and Sandys in their 'Dictionary of Classical Antiquities,' say of Chaos: "Ch&#259;&#335;s, according to Hesiod, the yawning, unfathomable abyss, which was the first of all existing things. From Chaos arose Gaia (Earth), Tat&#259;rus (Hell) and Er&#333;s (Love). Chaos bore Er&#277;bus and Night; from their union sprung &AElig;th&#277;r and H&#275;m&#277;ra (Sky and Day). The conception of Chaos as the confused mass out of which, in the beginning, the separate forms of things arose, is erroneous, and belongs to a later period." We shall see as we proceed how much the Maori belief is like this in many respects.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_10"></A><A HREF="#fr_10">10</A>. These ages do not agree with Te Matorohanga's teaching, which, however, as they give more detail, and hence, perhaps, will aid in understanding their significance, I give at the end of this chapter in an appendix.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_11"></A><A HREF="#fr_11">11</A>. It is nearly always the youngest of the family that is the hero in Maori legends. The youngest of all these gods was at this time a baby at the breast.&#8212;See <I>infra</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_13"></A><A HREF="#fr_13">13</A>. The Scribe tells me that the doctrine of the Whare-w&#257;nanga was, that all space above the earth was subject to intense cold (<I>anu-winiwini</I>), The names given are emblematical for different degrees of cold, for shivering, etc. At the same time the two first are Star names.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_16"></A><A HREF="#fr_16">16</A>. Paia is not mentioned in Te Matorohanga's list of the gods, though it is well-known he was one of them who played an important part; probably, he had another name as well&#8212;possibly Tu-pai.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_17"></A><A HREF="#fr_17">17</A>. In the course of this narrative, in the Historical part, we shall come across these axes again. The Maori belief is, that they were brought to New Zealand in the canoe 'Takitimu,' in A.D. 1350, and the first of the two is still in the possession of the Nga-Rauru tribe, West Coast of North Island.&#8212;See 'Journal Polynesian Society,' Vol. IX., p. 229, for the full history of the axe as far as known, and also the song about it. It is, according to description, quite a different shape, size and material to the ordinary Maori axes. It is so sacred, no white man has been allowed to see it.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_18"></A><A HREF="#fr_18">18</A>. The <I>Ahi-tapu</I> was the fire raised by the ordinary Polynesian method of rubbing a pointed stick (<I>ure</I>) in a grove in another stick (<I>kaunoti</I>). These sticks were habitually carried suspended from the neck either in front or at the back, to keep them quite dry and warm; contact with the body made them <I>tapu</I>, hence, Ahi-tapu, sacred fire. So says the Scribe; but I do not think the term was applied to any ordinary fire, but only to those made for ritualistic purposes.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_19"></A><A HREF="#fr_19">19</A>. <I>Horu</I>, clay permeated by the oxide of iron, when burnt was used to paint houses, canoes, &amp;c., and the face. <I>Pukepoto</I> is a brilliant blue clay, a fossil in fact, permeated by the phosphate (? proto-phosphate) of iron, and was used to paint a blue horizontal streak across the face for adornment. How these old people came to associate the brilliant blue with red blood, is not explained.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_20"></A><A HREF="#fr_20">20</A>. There are two species of Apa: the Apa-atua were minor gods, and were the messengers of the other gods. Apa is also a whirlwind, which is the bodily form of the former, who were spirits. Apa also means a company. It will be noticed that the Sage includes the Whatu-kura and Marei-kura within the class of Apa-atua, or god-Apas.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_21"></A><A HREF="#fr_21">21</A>. The Scribe tells me that this word, which ordinarily means a month, here refers ro the Kaupeka-o-runga (Celestial things), and the Kaupeka-o-raro (Terrestrial things), and that the months derive their names from it. Judging from subsequent statements it here means 'the knowledge of things Celestial and Terrestrial.'</P>

<P><A NAME="note_22"></A><A HREF="#fr_22">22</A>. Tama-kaka is not in Te Matorohanga's list; probably it is a second name&#8212;possibly number sixty-three.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_23"></A><A HREF="#fr_23">23</A>. See previous <A HREF="#note_13">note number thirteen</A>, where emblematical names are given to the cold. The Scribe tells me that Te Matorohanga taught that <I>anu-winiwini</I> (extreme cold) expressed a cold that human beings never experience, that all space above the earth is subject to this extreme cold; and that when Rangi and Papa were separated, the escape of their bodily heat carried the cold upwards.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_24"></A><A HREF="#fr_24">24</A>. This last statement is obscure, but, probably means, they were the most intelligent or daring. Maunga-nui is apparently another name for the sacred mountain in Hawaiki-nui, the Fatherland, called at the end of Chapter II., Tawhiti-nui (the great elevated, or uprising mountain), up which the spirits of the dead on their way to the uppermost Heaven ascended and were there purified. One cannot help noticing the apparent connection of this mountain with the Kailasa, so well described by Sven Haydn in north-west Thibet.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_26"></A><A HREF="#fr_26">26</A>. Taepatanga, is 'where the sky hangs down,' and joins the earth according to Maori ideas, i.e., in modern times, the limit of vision, the horizon and the bounding sky. <I>Tai-hiti, tai-wawa</I>, are expressions for difficulty or impossibility.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_27"></A><A HREF="#fr_27">27</A>. The word used is <I>ahu-turangi</I>, which, says the Scribe, describes the beauty and expanse of Heaven.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_28"></A><A HREF="#fr_28">28</A>. Two names for the ascent. The first is said to have steps, the second means the 'ascending clouds,' according to the Scribe. But I have heard the second name translated as the "swaying line, or rope." It occurs with other traditions.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_29"></A><A HREF="#fr_29">29</A>. This is a place in Rangi-naonao-ariki, the third Heaven from the summit. "It is here the offspring of Tawhiri-matea dwell; they are the various winds"&#8212;says the Scribe. The historical Tihi-o-manono, probably, in Samoa, Fiji, or Tonga, was named after this place.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_30"></A><A HREF="#fr_30">30</A>. These three are the 'currents' by which spirits descend to Hades&#8212;here used, probably, as meaning, let him try, and meet his death.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_32"></A><A HREF="#fr_32">32</A>. Neither of them are of the family of Rangi and Papa. The second name denotes that he was a very learned man; one may venture to translate the name as 'the receptacle of increasing knowledge.'</P>

<P><A NAME="note_33"></A><A HREF="#fr_33">33</A>. The Titi are explained by the Scribe as emblematical names for the ascending whirlwinds, otherwise called <I>awhiowhio</I>. By their aid T&#257;ne ascended by the Ara-tiatia: they were lent to him by Tawhiri-matea, god of winds.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_34"></A><A HREF="#fr_34">34</A>. The introduction of the 'O' before these names is strange and unlike Maori&#8212;it would almost seem that they had been derived from one of the branches of the Polynesians who use 'O' for 'Ko.'</P>

<P><A NAME="note_36"></A><A HREF="#fr_36">36</A>. This is part of the usual ceremonious and polite form of address between two strangers to one another. There are several amusing stories which bear on this.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_38"></A><A HREF="#fr_38">38</A>. All these Titi are emblematical names for different kinds of whirlwinds, by whose aid T&#257;ne ascended to and descended from the uppermost Heaven.</P>

passed to the west on their way to the Fatherland. Tahekeroa means the 'long rapid,' the eternal fall; i.e., of the evil spring Whiro, to eternal banishment in the realms of Hades. The three names connected herewith, Au-rona, Au-miro, and Au-kume&#8212;the wide-spread, dragging and swirling currents&#8212;express the idea of the current of death that is ever active in hauling mankind to death. Muri-wai-hou expresses the idea of the mouth of a river descending iuto a chasm, possibly connected with the Scandinavian and Grecian idea of the river that has to be crossed before Hades is reached&#8212;the Styx. Raro-henga, the utter confusion of mind of those who descend to Hades.</P>
