### CREATION OF THE SPARK OR GERM OF LIFE IN MAN.

NOW, when all these things had been finished by Tāne-matua and his elder
brethren, they asked one another, "By what means shall we raise up
descendants \[to ourselves\] in the 'world-of-light'?" Their elder
brother, Uru-te-ngangana (1) said, "Let us seek a female that may take
on our likeness, and raise up offspring \[for us\] in the
'world-of-light.'" Some suggested they should fetch some of the females
\[Apas, messengers\] of the twelve heavens, that is:—

   The above are the female Apas of the eleven heavens. Uru-te-ngangana
replied to this, "If we fetch our females from there, all our
descendants will be gods like ourselves. Rather let us take of the
Earth, that it may be said they are the descendants of Earth." Hereupon
it was agreed to search for such female.

   The family of gods now dispersed by two and two to search for the
female. All parts of the land and the ocean, the inland waters, and the
dense vegetation were searched. Every place was sought out, but not one
single thing was found suitable to take on the functions of a female
similar to the female Apas of the conjoint heavens. All assembled
again—none had found anything. Hence, is this episode known as: 'Tē
kitea' (the not-seen), 'Tē rawea' (the not-acquired), 'Tē whiwhia' (the
not-possessed).<span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1.md) And this is the
origin of these <span id="page_139">p. 139</span> words; so given in
that form, that the circumstances may be remembered by the *tohungas*
\[priests\], i.e., the commencement of the search for the female.

   It was then decided by the gods to ascertain whether or no \[the
female\] was to be found in any of the \[living\] beings that had been
appointed to dwell in the world \[i.e., the animals, insects, etc.\].
For all females of \[living\] things conceive; and an examination of
their offspring was to be made. Some were found \[partly\] appropriate,
some not. The reptiles have their particular issue in the form of eggs;
they were not suitable on examination, and so were discarded. . . . . .
.<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2.md) It was considered better that
something which produced after its own kind, or bodily shape, should be
adopted—and, hence, offspring by eggs were at this time assigned to
birds. It was now obvious that the \[kind of\] female required from
which the *iho-tangata*<span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3.md) \[the form or
likeness and attributes of man\] could be born, was not to be found.

   So the gods all assembled again in one place at Whare-kura to declare
their various ideas. And then spoke Ro-iho (2), Ro-ake (3), and Hae-puru
(4). (It was these three who felt a great love towards their common
parent, Rangi-nui, when he, their father, was separated from their
mother Earth; and they followed, or adhered, to Rangi-nui at that time;
that is, shortly after \[the separation\].) They said to Tāne-matua
(68), "O Tāne *e*! What is it ye are searching for?" Tāne replied, "We
are searching out the way to the female! That is our object." The three
then said, "Try the earth at Kura-waka, and commence your operations
there. For in that place is the female in a state of virginity and
potentiality; she is sacred, for she contains the likeness of man."

   The gods then went off to seek that earth at Kura-waka.<span
id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4.md) Here they formed a body \[in the likeness
of a woman\], and completed the arrangement of the head, the arms, the
bust, the legs, the back, and the front; and then the bones. Here ended
the work of the elder brethren. Then followed the arrangements of the
flesh, the muscles, the blood and the fat. On the completion of these
parts, the breath of life was assigned to Tāne-matua (68), to place it
in the nostrils, the <span id="page_140">p. 140</span> mouth, and the
ears—that was done. And then for the first time the breath of man came
forth, the eyelids opened, the pupils saw, and the hot breath of the
mouth burst forth, the nose sneezed. "Sneeze living heart to the world
of light; \[thy\] offspring \[shall be\] a man, a female."<span
id="fr_5"></span>[5](#note_5.md) After this the body was taken to the altar
at Muri-takina, where all the proceedings were voided \[i.e., where an
evil influence of earthly origin were removed, and the first woman
became a fit recipient for the germ of life.\]

   Now, it was told by the Rua-nukus \[learned teachers\] of the
Whare-wānanga, the depositories of ancient knowledge, that Hine-hau-one
\[the first woman, a name which may be translated,
'woman-created-of-earth'\] was formed on the *mons veneris* of the
all-mother, of the earth at Kura-waka; her head, her arms, her legs were
made there, also the bust. The breath of life, the lungs, the kidneys,
and the liver were all begged of Io, by Tu-kapua (40) and Tiwhaia,
Punaweko (19) and Hae-matua (5) and others—some parts were \[built up\]
by these, some by others. The parts were \[at first\] all made
separately in different places, but afterwards gathered and joined
together, and on completion it was said to be a human body. It was Io
\[the Supreme God\] and Rehua \[one of Io's messengers\] who implanted
the thoughts and the living spirit.

   When Hine-hau-one had been completely formed after their own
likeness,<span id="fr_6"></span>[6](#note_6.md) in no part different—except
indeed her front alone, which did differ in that she had there the
likeness of the female—it was said that an orifice should be made for
the urine. This was done, it was open; and then one of the eye-pupils of
Tiwhaia was extracted and placed as a door to the *meatus urinarius* of
Hine-hau-one. Some of the hair of Puna-weko (19) was placed as a
concealment for the *meatus* and to adorn it. Such was the origin of the
living-spirit of mankind in the 'world-possessed' or
\['world-of-being'\] and the 'world-of-light.'

   When Hine had been completely formed in the likeness of mankind, she
was delivered over to Tāne-matua (68) in order that procreation might
take place. First the ears were tried, hence the wax in them; then the
eyes, hence the rheum; then the nostrils, hence the mucous; then the
mouth, hence the saliva and the phlegm; then the armpits, hence the
perspiration; then between the thighs, hence the clammy perspiration;
then the *anus*, hence the excreta.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

   Then said the elder brethren, "Act in the water-way of Hine! for
there is the *awa-karihi* \[the *vagina*\] from whence comes forth the
living-spirit, from the fountain of Hine, to the world-of-light." Now
followed the *takutaku* \[incantation\] of Tupai (69) to excite the
*membrim virile* \[emblematical name, Tiki-ahua\] of Tāne; thus:

   The above *karakia* of Tupai's is to cause the two to adhere to one
another, to effect a junction in thought and body, so that there might
be only one husband \[for the woman\], none other beyond the one—Tāne,
or Tāne-nui-a-rangi, or Tāne-matua. His name in youth was Tāne, then
\[he acquired the second\] at his 'naming' above on <span
id="page_142">p. 142</span> Maunga-nui by Rehua and Rua-tau. And the
third when he was appointed a parent of all things \[mankind\] by Io at
the Uppermost Heaven. This was the end; his becoming permanently joined
to Hine as his wife.

   After the above, the *karakia* was taken up by Hae-puru (4) to secure
offspring to Hine-hau-one and Tāne-matua; this is it:—

   \[This *karakia* cannot be translated because it enters into details
of the female anatomy and reproductive powers, the various names of
which are given, but cannot now be identified. The Maoris were
intimately acquainted with the anatomy of the human body, which arose
through experience gained in disecting it for cannibalistic purposes.\]

   Again, Ro-iho (2) and Ro-ake (2) took up the *karakia* to strengthen
Tāne in implanting the 'spark of life' in Hine-hau-one \[which likewise
cannot be translated for the reason given above\].

   . . . . . . . These two *karakias* are both very *tapu*, and have
remained to the present time in use; the first is used in marriage to
cause the man and woman to be faithful to one another. The last one is
used to cause barren women to conceive and bear offspring—hence are they
*tapu*.

   After the above two *karakias*, Hine was taken to the *ahu-rewa*, or
altar, within the sacred house of Whare-kura and there purified—and
after that to the Wai-o-Tahu-rangi \[the sacred waters from Heaven\] and
there bathed.<span id="fr_7"></span>[7](#note_7.md) At this time she
received her \[full\] name, Hine-hau-one.<span
id="fr_8"></span>[8](#note_8.md) Then she was taken to the *turuma*
\[latrine\] of Whare-kura \[the first earthly temple\] where by biting
the rail all the effects of the *tapu* were removed. After this she was
taken to the house that had been specially made for the female before
the gods started out on their quest known as 'Te Kore-te-whiwhia,' etc.
\[see [p. 138](#page_138.md) *ante*\]. It was for this purpose that house
was built by Tāne-matua (68) and Tangaroa-a-mua (8),<span
id="fr_9"></span>[9](#note_9.md) and named Hui-te-ana-nui. It was a carved
<span id="page_143">p. 143</span> house; the pillars, the ends of the
rafters, the purlins, the ridge-pole, and battens at the end, the barge
boards, the sill of the porch and all such other parts that should
properly be so ornamented, were done.

   And then Hine-hau-one became the permanent wife of Tāne-matua. She
became pregnant, and gave birth to a daughter, who was named
Hine-titama; she was followed by Hine-manuhiri \[and others\].

   Those are the descendants of Hine-hau-one that came forth to the
world.

 

### THE PEDIGREE OF MAN.

   \[Athough it is not considered necessary in this part of the work to
print the large number of genealogical tables recited by the two Sages,
the following is introduced as a specimen, illustrating the descent of
man from Tāne-matua (68) down to Nga-Toro-i-rangi, the *tohunga* or
priest of 'Te Arawa' canoe that came to New Zealand about 1350, and the
descendants of whose crew are now to be found scattered all over the Bay
of Plenty, Lake Rotorua, and Lake Taupo. It is no doubt the case that
vast numbers of ancestors are omitted in the early part of the table
following, and only a few are inserted in the *tatai* or recitation, but
probably the correct descent from father to son (or daughter) begins
between the forty-fifth and fiftieth generation back from the year 1900,
as shewn by the figures, This would carry the table back to about the
seventh century, when, as all things seem to indicate, the Polynesians
were on the move from Indonesia into the Pacific. The table is from Te
Matorohanga's teaching.\]

### HINE-NUI-TE-PO, GODDESS OF HADES.

   \[Te Matorohanga says:—\] Hine-titama was the daughter of
Tāne-nui-a-rangi (68) and Hine-hau-one, and Tāne took her \[his
daughter\] unto him as a wife. After a certain time had passed
Hine-titama said unto Tāne, "O Sir! Who is my father?" Tāne replied,
"Ask that question of the pillars of the house!"—of Hui-te-ana-nui
\[which was the name of their house. Tāne said this to put off his
wife's question\]. Hine-titama well knew that the house had been built
by Tāne and Tupai (69), and she further now understood that Tāne was her
father as well as her husband. At this she felt a great pain and intense
horror. When dawn was near she uttered a spell (*tupe*) over her
children that they might sleep heavily, and another over Tāne so that he
might have no strength to follow her, and then she fled.

   Hine-titama fled over the plain of Whiti-naunau<span
id="fr_11"></span>[11](#note_11.md) towards the direction of Pou-tere-rangi
\[the guard-house to Hades\]. When she reached the door she found there
Te Ku-watawata (23) \[the guardian of the entrance\], who asked her,
"Where art thou going?" She <span id="page_145">p. 145</span> replied,
"Let me pass on to the descent" \[into Hades\]. Te Ku-watawata answered,
"Thou art leaving behind thee the world of light and life!" Hine-titama
then said, "Let me proceed to the descent to Muri-wai-hou in order that
I may ever catch the living spirits of my children<span
id="fr_12"></span>[12](#note_12.md) now in the 'everlasting light' \[a name
for this world\]."

   Now, hence arises the fact that the spirits return to this world \[as
explained below\]. So Te Ku-watawata allowed Hine-titama to pass on to
Hades, and as she did so she turned round and beheld her husband, Tāne,
approaching, shedding tears as he came along. Hine called out to him,
"Tāne *e*! Return to our family, for I have cut off the *aho o te ao*
\[the cord of the world\] to you \[and your descendants\], whilst the
cord of Hades remains with me \[for ever\]." And then \[by enchantment\]
Hine-titama caused the Adam's apple to grow in Tāne's throat, and said,
"Let that remain as a distinction between me \[woman\] and thee
\[man\]."<span id="fr_13"></span>[13](#note_13.md) And then Hine turned
away into Pou-tere-rangi and descended into Rarohenga \[Hades\].

   Let me explain this part: Hine-titama was her name in this world, but
changed to Hine-nui-to-po \[Great-lady-of-the-night, goddess of Hades\].
Afterwards she descended to Hades—to the dwelling place of her relative,
Whakuru-au-moko (70) \[god of volcanic forces\]. And now from this time
onward the flow of the 'current of death' of mankind to the 'everlasting
night' became permanent. This was the second; the deaths at Te Paerangi
\[the wars of the gods, see [p. 134](lww3.htm#page_134.md)\] being the
first \[institution of the descent of spirits to Hades\],

   Now, when Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga<span
id="fr_14"></span>[14](#note_14.md) learnt of this law of death, he
declared that he would end it \[and that man should live for ever\]. His
brethren said, "It cannot be done; for Tāne has appointed the
Pou-tiri-ao \[guardian spirits\] each to its separate sphere, its
separate duties, as is known by the demarkation in the service of the
altar."<span id="fr_15"></span>[15](#note_15.md) <span id="page_146">p.
146</span> But Māui would not listen. He then chose as companions the
birds Tatahore, Miro, and Ti-waiwaka, saying, "Come! be my companions."
They then took on the likeness of the sparrow-hawk, and all descended by
Taheke-roa \[the descent into Hades\] until they came to the place named
Kohurau, where they were seen by the family of Paketua \[see [p.
128](lww3.htm#page_128.md) the mosquitoes and other stinging insects\], who
at once went off to communicate the news to Hine-nui-te-po \[goddess of
Hades\], to whom they said, "Here are some from the world-of-light \[the
earth\], they are at Kohurau." Hine-nui-te-po at once understood that
this was a party antagonistic to her \[and her self-imposed duty of
destroying everlasting life in mankind\]. So she said to Pekerau, "Go!
Fetch me the blood of the party." When the Peketua family reached Māui,
he discovered their presence by the noise they made, so he and his
companions struck them with their wings, and the family of Pekerau were
thus defeated, the survivors fleeing to Hine-nui-te-po to inform her
that they had been defeated and many of them killed. This defeat has
always been known as 'Paihau-ka-roha' \[the wings-spread-out. The
continuation of this story will be found at page three, Chapter VI., as
it does not belong to this part\].

   Let me explain here: The words used by Hine to Tāne, i.e., 'the cord
of the world remains with you, the cord of Hades with me'; its meaning
is, the life of everything in the world is with Tāne, but the death of
all things in the world remain with her. That is all about that. The
other words of Hine to Tāne, "Return to our family and retain the
'living-spirit' of our children in the world, until emaciation and
failure of health bring them to me, I will catch the
'living-spirit'"—which means the spirit, soul, of man, will be withheld
\[from extinction\] by her and live again; and, hence it is we see the
spirits \[ghosts\] of men passing along, talking and declaring the signs
of death to the world. Enough of that. The Adam's apple which Hine
'knotted' in the throat of Tāne, was on account of his sin to her \[in
making her, his daughter, his wife\]; it has descended to all his
\[male\] offspring alone. Her side \[the woman's\] has not got it, and
that is the reason there is no Adam's apple in women, only in men.<span
id="fr_16"></span>[16](#note_16.md)

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

   \[Pohuhu adds to the above:\] On the arrival of Hine-titama at Hades,
she found Whakaru-au-moko \[god of volcanic action\] at his home, and
eventually became his wife, and they had twenty-one children \[whose
names are given, but they are of no particular interest; they are
emblematical for all kinds of volcanic phenomena, earthquakes, etc.,
etc.\]. They are the *pou-mataki* of their ancestress Papa-tua-nuku
\[the Earth-mother\].

 

### WHAKARU-AU-MOKO AND ORIGIN OF VOLCANIC FIRES.

   \[Te Matorohanga says:\] The youngest child of the Sky-father and
Earth-mother was Whakaru-au-moko (70) who, when the Earth was turned
over was a child at the breast; it was their last child. After the
separation of Rangi and Papa, Tāne and Paia saw the great love the
Earth-mother bore to the Sky-father; she could not rest in quiet; she
continually turned from side to side. So Tāne, Paia and some other gods,
thought it best to turn the face of their mother downwards to Te
Muriwai-hou, to Raro-henga (Hades), so she might no longer see
Rangi-nui, her Heavenly husband. Paia said unto Tāne, "I am consumed
with love for our younger brother, Whakaru-au-moko (70), let us take him
from the breast of his mother and retain him with us." Tāne replied, "We
cannot do that; leave him to warm and comfort the breast of our
Mother-Earth." It was then agreed by all the gods that Papa should be
turned over with her front or face downwards. Paia, seeing this
agreement in opinion of the other gods, said, "If such is your
determination, let us \[at least\] give unto our younger brother some
fire." To this Tama-kaka (63) consented, and gave some *ahi-komau*
(volcanic-fire—see *infra*) to their youngest brother; it was placed in
the *houama* \[otherwise called the *lohau*, or cork-wood, *Entelea
arborescens*\] and then their mother and young brother were turned over
to Raro-henga (Hades).

   Now, let me explain about the *ahi-komau*: This is so called when
fire is placed in the *houama*. If anyone is departing from his home for
some months, as on a war-party, he will obtain (the stem) of the *ti*
(*Cordyline australis*), and a piece of *tokitoki* (*titoki*) wood, both
quite dry, or a short piece of *matai* wood; they are cut in lengths as
long as a man, and are taken to the side of a hillock, down the face of
which a ditch is dug. The *titoki* leg is then placed in the ditch at
the bottom, and the *ti* above it. The ditch at the upper end is as deep
as a man's knee, the lower end as deep as the waist. A hole must be
arranged with the mouth slanting downward so water cannot enter. A piece
of lighted charcoal is placed on the upper end of the *ti*, and then
gravel is <span id="page_148">p. 148</span> filled into the ditch over
the wood, and over that a coating of clay to cover the whole. This is
what is called an *ahi-komau*. Notwithstanding that one goes away with a
war or other party, on return the fire will be found to be alight.<span
id="fr_17"></span>[17](#note_17.md)

   So Papa and her youngest child were capsized over to Rarohenga;
hence, is the broken up appearance of the Earth at the present time—the
thighs, the arms, the body, the head, all lie in different places.
Whakaru-au-moko (70) grew up to manhood, that is, a god—for it has
already been said the god-side combined with the earth-side when Rangi
and Papa dwelt together, and all their offspring were gods, there was no
human germ at that time. It was only after Tāne cohabited with
Hine-hau-one and Hine-ti-tama was born that the germ of man became man.
Io-mata-ngaro (Io-the-hidden-face) supplied the blood and fat,
Tawhiri-matea (7) gave the lungs to Paia; the Apa-whatu-kuras the
memory. The names given to these operations are, Rua-i-te-hiringa,
Rua-i-te-pukenga, Rua-i-te-mahara, and Rua-i-te-wānanga<span
id="fr_18"></span>[18](#note_18.md); of these three, one was from the
Toi-o-nga-rangi (the Uppermost Heaven), and one from the eleven Apas,
which has been explained as those that are dwelling in the eleven
Heavens. One \[side\] was from the Earth, and the three portions were
combined in one, placed in the water, and so arose the germ of man.
Papa-tua-nuku \[the Earth-mother\] was merely the support \[the
vehicle\], and hence was Hine-hau-one formed at Kura-waka, as a
recepticle for the water, the blood, the flesh and the breath. On the
accomplishment of this, it was said, the female form became permanent.

   The dwelling places of Whakaru-au-moko (70) and his offspring \[in
Rarohenga\] were as follows:—

|                               |                                                 |                               |                                                   |                                |                                                 |
|------------------------------:|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------:|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------:|-------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">1.</span> | <span class="small">Huru-atea</span>            | <span class="small">5.</span> | <span class="small">Whetuki</span>                |  <span class="small">9.</span> | <span class="small">Mauri-oho</span>            |
| <span class="small">2.</span> | <span class="small">Wai-kapuka</span>           | <span class="small">6.</span> | <span class="small">Te Oiroa</span>               | <span class="small">10.</span> | <span class="small">Te Pupuha-o-te-rangi</span> |
| <span class="small">3.</span> | <span class="small">Marua-roa</span>            | <span class="small">7.</span> | <span class="small">Toko-tu-ki-te-rangi</span>    | <span class="small">11.</span> | <span class="small">Marua-nuku</span>           |

   These were the places of Whakaru-au-moko in which were permanently
placed the fire given by Tupai (69) to him in the *houama*, and then
this fire received the name of 'The Ancient Fire' (Te Ahi-tawhio.)

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

 

### OF WHIRO, THE GOD OF EVIL.

   \[Te Matorohenga continued:\] When Whiro-te-tipua (6) was defeated in
the series of battles known as Te Paerangi (see *ante*), he departed
\[from the presence of the other gods\] and descended by way of
Taheke-roa<span id="fr_19"></span>[19](#note_19.md) to Muri-wai-hou, to
Rarohenga (Hades), and then arrived at the dwelling place of
Whakaru-au-moko (70) and his wife Hine-nui-te-po \[former name
Hine-titama\], to the places mentioned above. Now the thought grew in
Whiro and Whakaru-au-moko, that they should have but one object in
common to avenge the illtreatment of their mother (the Earth) and their
father (the Sky). Whakaru-au-moko consented to this proposition, and
then Whiro proposed they should operate above in the Ao-tu-roa \[the
world of light, this ordinary world\] and make war on Tāne (68) and his
elder brethren. Whakaru-au-moko replied to him, "Ye are all from above;
carry on your warfare above. I am from below, and here I will engender
my warfare." Whiro asked, "Where will you find weapons?" The other
replied, "I will make use of Puna-te-waro \[volcanic forces,
earthquakes, eruptions, hot-springs\]; for in it is contained the *ahi
komau* \[volcanic fires\]."

   Hence is the origin of the eruptions, the earthquakes, of Hine-tuoi
\[emblematical for hot-springs\], which agitate both land and sea—even
from those times of ancient strife down to the present. And, now was
given the third name to the 'Ahi-komau' (first), the 'Ahi-tawhito'
(second), the 'Ahi-tipua' (third) of Whakaru-au-moko, which cause the
landslips, and the fall of rocks and trees, of man, of all things, which
Tāne and his brethren had made.

   And thus it is that the illtreatment at Rangi-tau-ngawha \[the name
for the separation of Heaven and Earth\] when Rangi was separated from
Papa, is constantly avenged. Whiro and his companion gods ever continue
the strife of Tahua-roa \[emblematical for the continual warfare of
Whiro towards mankind and all things\], and there he appointed
'Maiki-nui' and 'Maiki-roa' \[misfortunes, catastrophies\] to utterly
destroy all things—the water, the blood, the flesh, and the breath.

   From within the temple of Hawaiki-nui,<span
id="fr_20"></span>[20](#note_20.md) direct flows forth the current of
death, by the way of Taheke-roa; and then is renewed the warfare of
Whiro against his enemies, which has existed even from that ancient time
down to this day; the peace has never been made in the wars of
Whakaru-au-moko (70) and Whiro \[against mankind\].

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

 

### THE FUNCTIONS OF SOME OF THE OTHER GODS.

   \[To continue Nepia Pohuhu's teaching; after repeating a great many
geneological tables and other matter not pertaining to the 'Celestial
Plane,' he returns to the doings of the gods, as follow:—\]

   Let our story now return to certain other origins, and work them out,
which will allow me time to think of some other genealogies relating to
these 'slaves.'<span id="fr_21"></span>[21](#note_21.md) Let us commence
with the following:—

   Uru-te-ngangana (1) married Hine-tu-rama \[first wife, daughter of
Tāne by Hine-hau-one\] and they had:—

|                                                     |                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">1. Kopu (Venus)</span>          | <span class="small">6. Whanui (? Vega)</span>                                             |
| <span class="small">2. Puanga (Rigel)</span>        | <span class="small">7. Pare-a-rau (? Saturn<span id="fr_22"></span>[22](#note_22).md)</span> |
| <span class="small">3. Tautoru (Orion)</span>       | <span class="small">8. Ika-roa (The Milky Way)</span>                                     |
| <span class="small">4. Autahi (Aldebaran)   </span> | <span class="small">9. Kaitahi</span>                                                     |
| <span class="small">5. Matariki (Pleiades)</span>   |                                                                                           |

   All of these were distributed by Tāne to the front of their parent
Rangi-nui \[the Sky-father\]. Now, the son of Tongatonga (42) Matariki
\[the Pleiades\] was taken to the Paeroa-o-Whanui \[one of the names for
the Milky Way\] to guard the *whanau-punga* \[those little stars in the
Milky Way that are just distinguishable as such by the naked eye\], lest
they be cast out by their elder brethren \[the principal stars—stars of
first magnitude\] and fall down below.

   Uru-te-ngangana (1) married a second wife named Iriiri-pua. This
woman was abducted by Whiro (6). She was a most beautiful woman. When
the power of directing the affairs of the gods was obtained by Tāne and
Tupai—who were both younger brothers of Uru-te-ngangana (1),
Tu-mata-uenga (11), Tama-kaka (? 63), Kiwa (52), Tangaroa (8), and
Rongo-marae-rua (14)—there was instituted the following proverb \[as
applicable to the deeds of Whiro, who was supreme in all evil\], "A
depreciating younger brother, a self-extoller, a cunning child."

   Whiro-te-tipua made the mistake of thinking that Iriiri-pua was an
entire stranger to him. It was not so—she was his own daughter, but he
did not know her. Now, here, in consequence of this deadly sin of Whiro,
Uru-te-ngangana finally separated himself from Whiro; and peace was
proclaimed between the former and Tāne and his elder and younger
brethren. It was subsequent to this that the wars of the gods at Te
Paerangi \[see ante Chapter III.\] took place, and Whiro and his <span
id="page_151">p. 151</span> faction fell; and his god-like power became
vested in Tāne and the others. His powers over all things in this world
ceased,<span id="fr_23"></span>[23](#note_23.md) when he and his companions
descended to Raro-henga (Hades), in which place his *marae*<span
id="fr_24"></span>[24](#note_24.md) is lost; it is there he occupied his
time in devising contention amongst and against the descendants of all
people and things in this world, and even up to the realm of the
Sky-father, where it ends in Rangi-tamaku \[next Heaven above the
visible one\].

   It is now clear that the wife of Uru-te-ngangana (1) was abducted by
Whiro-te-tipua (6). This was the first occasion on which a wife was ever
taken from her husband and appropriated by another. Out of this
occurrence arises the proverb: "A woman that leaves her husband is a
woman who commits adultery." All desires towards contention are due
entirely to Whiro; he was the perpetrator of all evil between his
brethren and himself.

   \[There are eleven principal causes of trouble between Whiro and his
brethren, of which seven have been mentioned in Chapter III., [pp. 124,
125](lww3.htm#page_124.md). The Sage now numerates the others. He says:\]

   After all the foregoing events the hatred of Whiro towards his
brethren became permanent; these were the causes of it \[for one to
seven see pp. 124, 125\]:—

|      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  8\. | The persistence of Tāne in ascending to the Uppermost Heaven to fetch the wānanga \[see [p. 126](lww3.htm#page_126.md)\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  9\. | The destruction of his (Whiro's) \[familiar spirits\] pets, and because some were made prisoners, as Tāne descended from highest Heaven \[see [p. 127](lww3.htm#page_127.md)\].                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 10\. | Because Tāne would not consent that the direction of matters in connection with the three 'baskets' \[of knowledge\] and the two stones should be given to Uru-te-ngangana (1) and him, after these things had been given by Io to Tāne within his *pa* of Rau-roha, when taken from the treasure house Rangiatea—the house of the Whatukuras and Marei-kuras \[who guarded them\]. |
| 11\. | The overturning of their Mother-Earth so that she faced Raro-henga (Hades), together with their youngest brother, Whakaru-au-moko (70); he was the one at that time feeding at the breast of their mother.                                                                                                                                                                          |

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

   These were the causes that induced Whiro-te-tipua (6) to fight
against Tāne (68) and his friends; and Te Pae-rangi was the general name
of that series of battles. In these battles, there were two—Whiro (6)
and Tu-mata-uenga (11)—who were eminently brave, and showed great
ability in generalship. But Tu-mata-uenga was the superior of the two;
and hence is the proverb, "A warrior, descendant of Tu-mata-uenga."
Another proverb is, "Thy weapons are those of Tu-mata-uenga." \[Applied
to anyone who distinguishes himself in war.\] Tu-mata-kaka was also a
great warrior, and it was he who assisted Tu-mata-uenga in directing the
fighting. Tupai (69) Tu-mata-huki (67), and Tu-kapua (40), were the
principal *tohungas*, or priests on the side of Tāne-nui-a-rangi (68)
\[during the war\], and they had charge of the sacred fire, and recited
the *karakias* \[or spells\], which caused the fall of Whiro and his
faction.

   When Whiro reached Hades he there continued his war against his
brethren \[and mankind\] by afflicting them with diseases, such as
fevers by which man is destroyed; whilst Whakaru-au-moko continued his
work by causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions by aid of the
*ahi-komau* \[volcanic fires\].

   At the time of the fall of Whiro at Te Paerangi \[see [p.
134](lww3.htm#page_134.md)\], when he descended to Hades, he left his house
named Tu-te-aniwaniwa \[where-stands-the-rainbow\]; and from it Tupai
(69), Tangaroa (8), and Tu-mata-uenga (11) carried off the two axes
named 'Te Awhio-rangi' and' Te Whiro-nui' and the two *whatu-kuras*
\[sacred stones brought down from Heaven by Tāne\] which had there been
deposited \[see *ante* [p. 130](lww3.htm#page_130.md)\], and suspended them
in Whare-kura \[the first earthly temple\]. Whiro returned from Hades to
fetch these things, but found them gone.

 

   Ro-iho (2), Ro-ake (3) and Hae-puru (4), are the gods who made peace
with Tāne-nui-a-rangi (68) and his faction; and hence were they
appointed \[as god-guardians\] to the plane most suited to them, at
Tara-puhi of Matangi-nui, of Matangi-naonao, of Matangi-puhi—hence are
they to be found at Tiritiri-o-Mahurangi.<span
id="fr_25"></span>[25](#note_25.md)

 

   Tawhiri-matea (7), Tu-kapua (40), Te Iho-rangi (10), and
Tawhiri-rangi (15); to them was given the plane of Tauru-rangi \[seventh
Heaven from the summit\], where they are to be seen arched over, heaped
up, as cumulus clouds, in their own *marae* \[court\] at Tarapuhi of
Pakau-rangi-roharoha \[the-wing-spread-over-the-heavens\], <span
id="page_153">p. 153</span> hence are they *tarahuru* \[equally spread
all over—not in single clouds, i.e., overcast\] on the bounds of the
sky.

   Te Mamaru (37) and Mawake-nui (28) were separated off to the extreme
confines of the Heavens, with Iho-rangi (10) also who has been mentioned
before. Their duties were to rule the clouds of the Heavens, and place
them between Heaven and Earth to shield and shade their Mother-Earth.
They call on Hine-moana \[Lady-Ocean\] Hine-wai \[Lady of the Watersl to
send Hine-makohu-rangi \[Lady of the Mists of Heaven\] to act as
clothing for their father the Sky, and to shade Mother-Earth \[from the
rays of the Sun\]. These are the clouds that stand above; they are due
to the warmth of Hine-moana, Hine-wai, and Papa-tua-nuku \[the Earth\];
hence the fogs and mists, the clonds and the rain.<span
id="fr_26"></span>[26](#note_26.md)

 

   Te Ku-watawata (23), Te Akaaka-matua (34) and others were appointed
to the Taheke-roa \[the descent to Hades\] there to watch the family of
Rangi and Papa \[Sky-father and Earth-mother\] and their grandchildren
who descend to Rarohenga, and Te Muri-wai-hou \[names for Hades\]. They
were stationed at Pou-tere-rangi \[the site of the watch-house of
Hades\], the name of the house being Te Rake-pohutu-kawa—that is its
minor name, but the principal name is Hawaiki-nui. There were four doors
to this house, each directed to the cardinal points. It is so, it is
said, because, if anyone dies in the south the spirit enters by the
southern door, and so on for each direction. On entering, those spirits
who have an affection for Rangi-nui \[the Sky-father\], or to the
conjoint Heavens, go forth by the eastern door, and ascend by the
Ara-tiatia \[way of steps\] to the conjoint Heavens. Those spirits that
show love to their mother-earth proceed to the bounds of Hine-moana
\[Lady-ocean\] and there remain. Those that go to the summits of the
mountains remain there, whilst those who show love to Whiro (6) are
separated off to Te Muri-wai-hou and Raro-henga \[Hades\] that is, to
the Reinga, \['jumping off place,' of which there is one in each home of
the Polynesians\]. It is the bad and wicked spirits that are separated
off to the Reinga;<span id="fr_27"></span>[27](#note_27.md) the good ones
are those who go by the Ara-tiatia to the conjoint Heavens.

   Now, before ailing mankind expires, as they lie on their death-beds
the fat of the body, the brains of the head, the \[marrow\] of the
bones, all gather at the heart, and there await dissolution; the water
of the <span id="page_154">p. 154</span> body, of the kidneys, of the
lungs dries up. At this point the spirit (*wairua*) goes away to visit
its relatives; and after that proceeds to Hawaiki.<span
id="fr_28"></span>[28](#note_28.md)

   Now, if Te Ku-watawata \[guardian of the entrance to Hades\] allows
the spirit to proceed to the place assigned to it, the dying body will
die right out. If he does not consent, the spirit is sent back to its
body, and it will live again in this world until it has fulfilled the
remainder of its time, and then it finally dies in reality. That is the
meaning of Hawaiki when the name is mentioned; it is the place meant
when it is said man goes to the Pō \[everlasting night\]—that is Hawaiki
\[i.e., when it is mentioned in connection with death; for there are
plenty of other places in the Polynesian world bearing that name. See
"Hawaiki," 3rd Edition, p. 53\].

 

   Now, Tama-te-uira (44), Tu-mata-kaka (63), and several other gods are
the guardians of the following family:—

|                                                                              |                                                     |                                |                                                |

   There are also others. \[The duty of the gods above named\] is to
moderate the action \[of the lightning\] lest damage is done to the
Earth; that is why they have to be guarded; for they are a dangerous,
mischievous family, ever striving with their elder and younger brethren.

 

   Puna-weko (19), Tāne-te-hokahoka (45), and Huru-manu (21) are the
source of all birds, whether of the sky or the land—they are the
guardians of the birds. But there is no reason why I should enumerate
all the birds, suffice it to say, the birds of every species \[come
under their charge\].

 

   We will now return to Tawhiri-matea (7) and his family that all went
to escort Tāne-nui-a-rangi \[to the upper Heavens, see [p.
128](lww3.htm#page_128.md)\]. These are that family, i.e., their pedigree:—

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

   These last two had the following offspring \[see p. 49 of original.
They are all names for various descriptions of snow, twelve in number\].
These are all the children of Huru-te-ārangi and the god Te Iho-rangi
(10); they are all various kinds of snow, and are the origin of the snow
in this world. They dwell on the summits of Mahu-tonga,<span
id="fr_31"></span>[31](#note_31.md) and frequently are driven up by the
fierce south winds, but it is only their semblances that are sent here
by the 'gale-family' of Tawhiri-matea (7), so that the hail-storms of
winter may alight in the month of Marua-roa \[July—the winter
solstice\], when Tai-ranga, Popo, Toro-huhu, Tara-pokaka, Pawhati, and
Tuke-rangaranga<span id="fr_32"></span>[32](#note_32.md) work their evil on
trees, etc., leaving the forest clear.

   The following is the family of Tawhiri-matea (7) who dwelt with
Para-wera-nui \[the fierce-south-wind\]:—

|                                           |                                    |                                                             |

| <span class="small">Huru-te-ārangi</span> | <span class="small">   =   </span> | <span class="small">Tonga-nui-ka-ea (second husband)</span> |
| <span class="small">┌─────</span>         |   <span class="small">─┘</span>    |                                                             |
| <span class="small">Parawera-nui</span>   | <span class="small">   =   </span> | <span class="small">Tawhiri-matea (7)</span>                |

   \[Their offspring are the twenty-three individual names shown on page
49 of the original Maori, which are the different kinds of winds,
whirlwinds, squalls, tempests, etc.\] They are the family who conveyed
Tāne-nui-a-rangi (68) by way of the Ara-tiatia, that is, the direct way,
to Te Toi-o-nga-rangi \[the highest heaven\].

   There are other grandchildren of Iho-rangi (10) \[says Pohuhu\] as
follows:—

1\. Pāra    2. Koiro (or Ngoiro)    3. Tuna

   These descended down below from the Rangi-tuhaha \[conjoint
Heavens\]; they are not descended from nor were created from
Papa-tua-nuku \[the Earth-mother\]. The following are the *hapus*
\[sub-tribes\] of Tuna \[the eel-fawily, they are seven in number, and
the names will be seen in the original at page 47.\] Pohuhu continues:—

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

   At the period that the Sun and its younger brethren \[the Moon and
Stars\] were assigned to the sky above us, to there move \[in their
courses\], the waters in Rangi-tamaku \[the Heaven above the visible
one\] became heated by the Sun; they passed off in watery mists, and
then became *retoretotia* \[i.e., overgrown with the oval-leafed
water-plant called *retoreto*\]. It was then the following \[heavenly\]
fish descended to Earth:—Tuna, the eel; Pāra, the barracuta; Ngoiro, the
sea-eel; Tuere;<span id="fr_33"></span>[33](#note_33.md) Mangō, the shark;
Piharau, the lamprey; and Inanga, the white-bait. Those are the names of
the families that came down to Earth to search for cold water. After
dwelling a long time here, Pāra, Mangō and Ngoiro turned upon the
offspring of Tuna and the others, and began to eat them. And now arose
great disturbances: Tuna went down into the swamp to hide himself;
Piharau burrowed under the shingle banks; Inanga went to the shallows so
that he might not be eaten by Pāra, Ngoiro and Mangō. These latter then
were starving, and so went forth to the ocean to dwell, where they are
now to be found. Pāra was the first to depart, followed by Ngoiro and
Mangō, the latter on account of its quarrel with Tua-tara \[spiny-back,
the great lizard\]. Mangō said unto Tua-tara, "Welcome! Let us both go
to the ocean and dwell." Tua-tara replied, "Rather let us both dwell
ashore." Mangō said, "No! Let us go to the ocean." And their argument
continued until at last Mangō said, "Enough! Remain you ashore as an
object for man to be disgusted at." Tua-tara replied, "That is alright.
That is my *măna* \[power, prestige, etc., here means power of
preserving his own life\]; that will be my salvation. As for thee, thou
wilt be hauled up and thy mouth torn with a hook, be thrown into the
bottom of a canoe, and thy head broken with a fern-root beater. After
that thou wilt be hung up to dry in the sun, like a menstruous-cloth."
After this the fellows separated. Both their words have come true as
they predicted.

   \[No doubt the above will appear as a mere fable—as indeed it is. But
there is something behind it which connects the fable with old-world
stories. The rivers in the Heaven above that which we see, is no doubt
the river in the constellation of Erydanus of the Greek and other
mythologies—called by the Maoris Waihau. Tuna, the eel, is probably
'Indra, the eel-god parent of the sons of the river'—or it may be that
Iho-rangi (10) represents Indra of Hindu mythology. But we shall learn
more on this subject when we come to the story of Tawhaki.\]

   The Moko-kakariki, the green lizard; the Kumukumu \[the fish <span
id="page_157">p. 157</span> *Trigla-kumu*<span
id="fr_34"></span>[34](#note_34.md)\]; the Tua-tara, great lizard
\[*Sphenodon punctatus*\]; Tu-tangata-kino, a lizard \[or lizard-god,
invoked in witchcraft\]; Moko-titi-a-toa, black and grey spider;
Moko-papa, a lizard; and Moka-moka, an insect; the Whē, the
catterpillar; the Pepe, the butterfly; Pu-rehurehu, a moth; and other
insects of that sort, are all descendants of Peketua \[see story of Māui
*ante* [p. 145](#page_145.md)\]. This is the pedigree:—

Peketua = Mihamiha

and they had the family mentioned above.

   Rangi-tamaku<span id="fr_35"></span>[35](#note_35.md) = Whanui (? the
star Vega)

   Their family were all \[minor\] gods; they are:—

|                               |                                                  |                                |                                                   |

   I cannot gather all this family in my thoughts, for there are very
many of them. They are distributed in the inter-celestial spaces of the
conjoint Heavens, in free companionship. None of their descendants came
down to Earth.

   Rangi-parauri<span id="fr_36"></span>[36](#note_36.md) married
Hine-kohurau \[Lady of the many mists\] and they had:—

|                               |                                                                               |                               |                                        |

   It is said there is a very numerous family of these gods; they are
like the previous ones, are scattered throughout the inter-celestial
spaces.

   Whakarongo-i-ata \[list-to-the-morn\] married Haeata \[the dawn\],
and had Marama-ki-te-rangi \[clearness-in-the-sky\], who married
Tipu-tipu \[growing\], and they had Wahi-rangi. Their descendants came
down to this earth as gods. \[Wahi-rangi was the child of the last
couple mentioned, and he was probably a human being. The descent from
him is given as twenty-five generations to Ruarangi, who married
Rongoue-roa, daughter of Toi-te-hua-tahi, who flourished thirty-one
generations ago, and was an early migrant from Tahiti Island to New
Zealand. Another line of descent from Wahi-rangi gives three generations
to the Māui family of great fame, and then, six <span id="page_158">p.
158</span> more to the hero Tawhaki, nineteen more to Tamatea-ariki-nui,
captain of the 'Takitimu' canoe that brought the ancestors of the two
Sages to New Zealand twenty-two generations ago, or about the year 1350;
or fifty-five generations by one line, fifty-one by the other. It may be
noticed that the name Wahi-rangi (Wahi-lani) is known to the Hawaiian
genealogies, but at not such an ancient date as the one known to the
Maoris.\]

   \[One of the high priests dwelling in the Uppermost Heavens was
Oho-mai-rangi. He was a god also. His immediate ancestors are as shown
below by Pohuhu:—\]

when he went there to secure the *wānanga* \[knowledge\] from the house
named Rangi-atea, within the *pa* of Io-matua \[Io-the-all-father\] at
Rauroha. It was they and some of the Whatu-kuras and Marei-kuras who
were there. Some of the descendants of Oho-mai rangi descended to this
Earth, and were gods and *arikis* \[high-chiefs\] in this world.

   \[It is said Huiarei, the wife of the celebrated Toi-te-huatahi, who
flourished thirty-one generations ago, and was the first migrant from
eastern Polynesia to New Zealand, had a child by the god Oho-mai-rangi,
and whose descendants now live in New Zealand.\]

   Tua-rangaranga was the ancestor of the *taniwhas* \[monsters\] and
things of that kind in the waters, or inland, or in the trees, or
stones, or <span id="page_159">p. 159</span> within the earth, or in the
space \[above\]. That is their origin, and hence it is that they rise up
against man, because they dwell as gods on the Earth.

   Tu-te-ahunga \[? Tu-te-ahuru above\] married Hine-peke and had the
following offspring \[see p. 42 of original Maori. There are twenty-two
of them altogether\]. This family are extremely numerous and cannot be
gathered together here. They are the origin of all insects that can be
seen.

   Aho-rangi married Mata-kupenga and had ten children \[see the names,
p. 43 of original\]. These are all kinds of spiders; there are many more
than named here.

   Takoto-wai<span id="fr_40"></span>[40](#note_40.md) married Tua-matua
\[? the god No. 59\] and they had the following offspring, ten in number
\[see p. 43 of original\], besides others; they are the origin of all
the rocks and stones.

   Raka-hore \[one of the above family\] married Hine-maukuuku, and they
were the origin of the stony reefs and flat rocks \[of the sea\]; and by
his second wife Hine-waipipi, he had all the flat rocks in the rivers,
or in the earth.

   Makatiti \[another of the above family\] married Hine-waipipi, and
his offspring were the sands, gravel, and the Powhatu-one-kokopu, or
gravel used in making the little heaps in which the *kumara* \[Batatas\]
is grown, the fine gravel, white, black, red and all other colors that
are pretty to look at.

   Makatata \[one of Takoto-wai's family\] had other kind of stone
offspring \[as shown p. 43 of original\], seven in number.

   Rangahua \[one of the same family\] married Tu-maunga and they had
the family of stones for grinding axes, etc., seven in number.

   Para-whenua-mea<span id="fr_41"></span>[41](#note_41.md) married Kiwa
(52), the ruler of the water. This was the first wife of Kiwa, and they
made the waters which flow forth and make the ocean. His friend was
Huru-te-arangi, who married Iho-rangi (10) \[see p. 40\], whose
offspring were various sorts of snow. Those two were the friends of Kiwa
(52), who aided in making the waters, and the ocean was named Hine-moana
\[Lady-ocean\], who was a wife of Kiwa's—hence is the name Te
Moana-nui-a Kiwa \[the South Pacific Ocean\].

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

   Now, these works were undertaken before the time when their
Sky-father and Earth-mother were separated; but some were finished
afterwards, and others subsequent to the war at Te Pae-rangi—that of
Whiro (6) and Tu-mata-uenga (11); and when each work had been completed,
then the Pou-tiri-ao \[guardian spirits\] were appointed each to its own
division \[of nature\], and to the Kauhangas \[Planes\] of both Rangi
\[Sky-father\] and Papa-tu-a-nuku \[Earth-mother\].

   Now, enough, O people! You know all that everything about the
Whare-wānanga is extremely *tapu*—its teachings, its priests, everything
about it. In these days of the white-man, everything has become void of
*tapu*; and, hence it is that the learning of old is gradually becoming
lost. We never wished that these \[sacred\] things should fall into the
white-man's hands, lest our ancestors become a source of pecuniary
benefit. All that the white-man thinks of is money; and for these
reasons this ancient knowledge of ours was never communicated to the
Mininsters and Bishops.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_138">p. 138</span>

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1.md). These expressions are frequently to
be found in their *karakias* (prayer spells, etc.)

<span id="footnotes_page_139">p. 139</span>

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2.md). The sentence omitted is so obscure
it cannot be translated.

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3.md). The Scribe says, this means the
'form' of man; and embodies the idea of his descent partly from the
gods, or Heaven, and partly from woman, or the Earth. *Iho* = umbilical
cord, *tangata* = man.

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4.md). It is said that this earth was red
in colour. Adam was supposed to have been formed of red earth. Te
Matorohanga says Kura-waka was in that part of the Earth between the
legs—for, as already pointed out, the Earth was supposed to be shaped
like a woman.

<span id="footnotes_page_140">p. 140</span>

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5.md). This is said to a child when it
sneezes—we do somewhat the same on like occasions. The words are usually
abreviated into *Tihe mauri ora*, Sneeze-living-heart.

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6.md). This statement is one of the few
from which we may gather that the Maori idea of their gods, took the
exact human form.

<span id="footnotes_page_142">p. 142</span>

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7.md). These sacred waters, in this case,
were, according to tradition specially prayed for, when they descended
from Heaven, and were thus quite pure—earthly water was not considered
pure enough for the purpose of the purification of Hine-ahu-one.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8). Hine-hau-one (or Hine-ahu-one.md)
means, 'woman-created-from-earth.'

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9.md). Tangaroa-a-mua (number eight in
list of gods, Chapter III.) was his original name as a god dwelling with
his brethren after the separation of Heaven and Earth. But when he was
appointed guardian of the ocean, with Kiwa, his name was changed to
Tangaro-a-tai, or Tangaroa-whakamau-tai. Te Matorohanga taught that he
was one of the greatest of the gods, only exceeded in power and position
by Tāne. After these two came Tu, and after him Tama-kaka—all offspring
of the Sky-father and Earth-mother. In Samoa, Tahiti, Rarotonga and some
other islands Tangaroa was the principal god of all.

<span id="footnotes_page_143">p. 143</span>

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10.md). Hine-titama, the daughter of the
god Tāne and the Earth-formed woman, Hine-ahu-one, was looked upon as
the first human being, born of woman. Her mother was completed as a
woman through the work of the gods—all but the spirit and life, which
was given her by the Supreme God Io, acting through Tāne. The *Ti-Tama*
seems to express to the old Maori the idea that she was the first of
mankind (though her father was a god). We shall see later on in this
chapter the end of Hine-titama.

<span id="footnotes_page_144">p. 144</span>

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11.md). A name which is emblematical for
wandering aimlessly about in a confused state of mind. It was in after
generations applied to an island which is probably one of the Fiji
group, and is well-known in Rarotongan and Maori traditions.

<span id="footnotes_page_145">p. 145</span>

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12.md). Including all her descendants
down to this day—she refers to the spirits returned to earth, as in the
case of trances or fainting.

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13.md). See the explanation *infra*.

<span id="note_14"></span>[14](#fr_14.md). This Māui is the famous hero
whose miraculous deeds have furnished after generations with abundant
stories, a summary of which, or at least some of them, have been
gathered into a volume—"Māui, the demi-god"—by W. D, Westervelt, of
Honolulu. We have to be careful to distinguish between this Māui—the Sun
hero, the hero who attempted to secure everlasting life to mankind, from
the historical family of that name who flourished about fifty
generations ago, when the Polynesians were dwelling in Indonesia. Māui
is not a god.

<span id="note_15"></span>[15](#fr_15.md). This is not at all clear, but no
doubt means that it was impossible for Māui to alter the decrees of the
gods; for he was not a god, but a hero, a semi-divine hero gifted with
miraculous powers. One proof of this is—as the Scribe tells <span
id="footnotes_page_146">p. 146</span> me—that the genealogies of beings
prior to Māui, were never recited to the common people—they were too
sacred, for they dwell with the gods and their more immediate
descendants, the first of mankind.

<span id="note_16"></span>[16](#fr_16.md). This incident of Māui's attempt
to end death, and thereby allow mankind to live for ever does not
properly belong to this part, but is introduced merely to illustrate
Hine-nui-te-po's character—we shall come across Māui later on.

<span id="footnotes_page_148">p. 148</span>

<span id="note_17"></span>[17](#fr_17.md). This description is of the
modern permanent fire (which is the meaning of the word), and used in
ante-European days. But the original Ahi-komau is supposed to be the
source of the volcanic fires. I am assured that such a fire will
smoulder for at least three months.

<span id="note_18"></span>[18](#fr_18.md). These names beginning with Rua
seem to mean the progressive stages of knowledge, thought, etc.

<span id="footnotes_page_149">p. 149</span>

<span id="note_19"></span>[19](#fr_19.md). The 'long descent' leading to
Hades.

<span id="note_20"></span>[20](#fr_20.md). The great temple with four doors
at the meeting of spirits. See [note 18, p. 89](lww1.htm#note_18.md).

<span id="footnotes_page_150">p. 150</span>

<span id="note_21"></span>[21](#fr_21.md). Only used in a facetious vain,
referring to those on the many lines he had repeated.

<span id="note_22"></span>[22](#fr_22.md). Pare-a-rau is said to be Saturn,
but it is most unlikely that such astute observers as were the Maoris,
and with the knowledge they had of the stars and their motions, should
confound a planet with a fixed star—probably, Pare-a-rau was in reality
one of the fixed stars.

<span id="footnotes_page_151">p. 151</span>

<span id="note_23"></span>[23](#fr_23.md). This requires explanation, for
Whiro's powers of evil and dragging men down to death existed until
Christianity was believed in.

<span id="note_24"></span>[24](#fr_24.md). *Marae*, the open place in a
*pa*, where all matters of importance were discussed, many ceremonies
held, speeches made, etc., etc.

<span id="footnotes_page_152">p. 152</span>

<span id="note_25"></span>[25](#fr_25.md). These are names of places in the
second Heaven from the summit, the home of the Heavenly winds.

<span id="footnotes_page_153">p. 153</span>

<span id="note_26"></span>[26](#fr_26.md). Thie statement illustrates the
knowledge, due to a close study of nature, of the old time Maori.

<span id="note_27"></span>[27](#fr_27.md). It is the treacherous people and
murderers that go to Whiro, says the Scribe.

<span id="footnotes_page_154">p. 154</span>

<span id="note_28"></span>[28](#fr_28.md). Physiologists may object to this
theory; but it is that of the old-time Maori, who, in his experience of
death seems to have been acquainted with the premonition conveyed to
distant relatives, of which we have heard of so many instances.

<span id="footnotes_page_155">p. 155</span>

<span id="note_29"></span>[29](#fr_29.md). The first Heaven above the
visible Heavens.

<span id="note_30"></span>[30](#fr_30.md). Means great space, a name for
the star Vega.

<span id="note_31"></span>[31](#fr_31.md). Mahu-tonga, emblematical for the
south, wherein the cold winds eminate.

<span id="note_32"></span>[32](#fr_32.md). All these names are emblematical
for rot, worm-eating and other affections of the forest trees.

<span id="footnotes_page_156">p. 156</span>

<span id="note_33"></span>[33](#fr_33.md). Tuere is a mythical fish, of the
eel species.

<span id="footnotes_page_157">p. 157</span>

<span id="note_34"></span>[34](#fr_34.md). See the argument between him and
Tua-tara. Journal Polynesian Society, Vol. XX., p. 40.

<span id="note_35"></span>[35](#fr_35.md). First heaven above the lowest.

<span id="note_36"></span>[36](#fr_36.md). Tenth heaven from the summit.

<span id="note_37"></span>[37](#fr_37.md). Eleventh heaven from the summit.

<span id="footnotes_page_158">p. 158</span>

<span id="note_38"></span>[38](#fr_38.md). Brother of Tāne, see offspring
of Rangi and Papa, Chapter III.

<span id="note_39"></span>[39](#fr_39.md). There is a god of that name, see
above list, No. 59, but he was a brother not a son of Tāne.

<span id="footnotes_page_159">p. 159</span>

<span id="note_40"></span>[40](#fr_40.md). Grandchild of Tāne, see above.

<span id="note_41"></span>[41](#fr_41.md). Para-whenua-mea, is emblematical
for the traditional Deluge, and for the destruction of the face of
nature caused thereby. She is also identical with the Hawaiian goddess
Pele (which, through known letter changes, is the same as Para), goddess
of volcanic fires. Kiwa is one of the gods of the ocean, after him the
Pacific Ocean is named—Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa—(the-great-ocean-of-Kiwa).
