## THE LORE OF THE WHARE-WĀNANGA

### note to the hypertext transcription

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This book is presented as the translation of a (Maori) transcript of the
teachings of Maori elders as given in the Whare-Wānanga, or school of
sacred knowledge. There have been aspersions cast on the authenticity of
this book ever since it was published. See
[here](https://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~dominic/io-writn.html) for an
exposition of some of the background of this book and the discussion
surrounding it.

This is only the first (of two) part of 'The Lore'; the second part is
concerned with more strictly historical matter regarding the migration
to and settling of New Zealand by the Maori and is not yet completed. In
the printed text of this book, the original Maori was given in full on
pp. 1-76. The Maori text is not reproduced here. There were also a
number of spelling and punctuating errors and inconsistencies in the
English text. The grossest of these have been corrected, but the careful
reader will still see a good bit of questionable typography.
