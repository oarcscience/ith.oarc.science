(Crying of Adam PUH for paradise)

It was told that Adam (PUH) cried for paradise until it was like great
rivers on his cheeks because of tears, and he stood at the door of Kaba
and his clothes were of the skins of cows and camels and said: O Lord
help me with my mistake and Make repentace upon me and Let me back into
the place that I were in. Then said God, the Exalted one: I helped you,
and Made repentace upon you and I will let you back in the place that I
got you out from. It is doubtless that what we understand and everyone
with the right mind would understand as well that the paradise that Adam
is asking his Lord to be back into is the paradise of eternity, and it
was the place that he were in and got out from, and the clue to that is
the tidings about him viewing the place (level) of Muhammad, 'Ali,
Fâtima, Al-Hasan and Al-Husain (PUT) and that he saw their names written
on the corners of the Throne and it was told that the Throne is the roof
of paradise as mentioned in Hadith, and it is behind heavens and its
roof is the Throne.  
Add to that, the words of revelation that Adam received from his Lord
and Relented toward him were of Muhammad and his Household (PUT) and His
Holy saying "fulfilled them"(Al-Baqarah: 124) meaning until Al-Qâ'im
Al-Mahdi from the Household of Muhammad (PUH), they are the twelve Imams
adding the nine descendants of Al-Husain (PUT).  
Also mentioned that the words that Adam received from his Lord are His
Holy saying "Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves..etc"(Al-A'raf: 23) and
also mentioned they are the prayer of the prophet (PUH): O praise be to
You my Lord and Thanks..etc \[This is a line from a prayer that seems
famous but I didn't get to know\], and other things had been mentioned
also but the probability that all of that is true is not impossible, but
the most common base is what was mentioned by the purified masters that
the words that was received were their names (PUT). As supported by
Al-Mofadhal ben 'Omar he said: Abu 'Abdullah Al-Sâdiq (PUH) said: God,
the Exalted,  may praise be to Him, created the souls before the bodies
by two thousands, and Made the higher of them and the most honourable
are these of Muhammad, 'Ali, Fâtima, Al-Hasan and Al-Husain, and the
rest of the Imams after them (PUT), and Showed them to the heavens and
earth with mounts and their lights covered them all, then God did say to
the heavens and earth with the mounts: these are my judges and rulers
over my creations, for them and for these who follow their path I made
My paradise, and for these who oppose them I made My hell, and whoever
claims their position from Me and their greatness I would torture him
like I did not Do to anyone else, and whoever agreed to be loyal to them
and never claimed their position I shall Let him be with them in
paradise, and being loyal to them is a fidelity to be taken by My
creation..etc. It is a long speech where he mentioned their virtues and
the goodness that would be to these who would be loyal to them and the
damnations on whoever take them as a foe and took over their rights and
helped others over them and whoever does this, God Prepared for him the
shame and torture. Also in it there is a warning for these who wishes
for their places, and that when Adam and Eve (PUT) got down to earth,
Gabriel (PUH) came to them and guided them to ask their Lord by the
right of the names that they saw on the leg of the Throne to Relent
toward them, so then they said: O Lord we ask You by the right of the
closest to You, Muhammd and 'Ali and Fâtima and Al-Hasan and Al-Husain
and the Imams after them to Relent toward us and Have mercy upon us, so
then God relented toward them. All the prophets after that kept this
fidelity then and advised their viceroys and the loyals of their nations
so they denied to claim it for themselves and never forgot about it, and
whoever's soul might get sick and get wicked by his demons to put
himself in such place, damnations he will get from God and torture, and
for this God, the Exalted, did say "Lo! We offered the trust unto the
heavens and the earth and the hills, but they shrank from bearing it and
were afraid of it. And man assumed it. Lo! he hath proved a tyrant and a
fool"(Al-Ahzab: 72).  
And it is never thought of Adam (PUH) being one of these who wished for
their place and so he would be one of these who took their rights, but
No and Never. But what is meant by the previous Holy phrase in "man
assumed it" is assuming this trust (fidelity) without any right for
doing this, as it is mentioned by some famous wisemen with little
difference between each tale (explanation), "Those who do wrong will
come to know by what a (great) reverse they will be
overturned!"(Al-Shu'arâ': 227) \[This paragraph was shortened by the
overall meaning translation\]  
It is told by the holy prophet (PUH) that when Adam (PUH) did the sin, a
call came from the Throne towards him saying: O Adam, leave My vicinity,
because no one stays in and refuses My commandment, then Adam did cry
and the Angels cried with him, then God sent him Gabriel to get him down
to earth with blackened face, then when Angels did see that cried loudly
and lamented and said: O Lord, a creation You did Create and Breathed in
it by Your Spirit and Made Your Angels prostrate before him, so You did
Change his whiteness to blackness with one sin? Then a call came toward
him from heavens: O Adam, fast for your Lord this day, and it was the
thirteenth day of the month, and one third of the blackness was removed
from Adam (PUH), then he was called again in the fourteenth day to fast
for Lord and so two thirds of the blackness went out, and then called
again in the fifteenth day to fast and so he did and all of the
blackness went out, and for this these days were called "Al-Ayam
Al-Beedh" (The White Days) in which Adam retained his whiteness, then a
called from heavens called him: O Adam, these three days I made for you
and your descendants and whoever fasted these three days from each month
he would be as if he had fasted all of his life.  
From the explanation of Al-Imam Al-'Askiri (PUH) in his explanation of
God's saying "but come not nigh this tree..etc"(Al-Baqarah: 35), that it
is the tree of wisdom of Muhammad and his Household that God made it for
them only and it was for them only in special and no one would eat from
it except them, and they were eating from it after they fed the wretch,
the orphan and the prisoner and the revelation of the chapter of Al-Dahr
\[Also called Al-Insân. Al-Dahr means The Life and Al-Insân means The
Man\] about them with the agreement of all interpreters, and so they did
not feel any hunger, thirst, nor tiredness after they ate from it. It is
a tree that was not like any tree in paradise and carried many
charactersitics and has lot of different types of wheat, grape, fig and
the rest of fruits, and this is why many interpreters did interpret the
type of this tree in many ways, so some of them said it is the wheat and
others said it is the grape and so on, so God did say: come not nigh
this tree, meaning you will be seeking the place and level of Muhammad
and his Household and their virtues, and this is something that God made
so special for them only, and it is the tree that whoever eats from by
the will of God, he would be inspired with the knowledge and wisdom of
those of old and those of later time without any need to learn. This
speech and its contents is not a weird because of what was mentioned
about the rights of the Household (PUT) before.  
And then if you meditate fairly and neglected the partisanship and the
love of the self, and looked with the eye of your heart to what was
mentioned for 'Ali and the Household of 'Ali by the special and the
normal people, and asked these of thoughts and fair of your wisemen
about the place and level of 'Ali and the Household of 'Ali and their
knowledge and what God made them special with from virtues and true
characteristics, you would win the great luck and the happiness of the
two lifes \[meaning this life and the after-life\] and you would know
that they are the top of all creatures and they are the path to the God,
and their knowledge is not taken by someone else but was given by God,
the Exalted, and by the prophet (PUH) in a special position that no one
else would be able to count and limit (the knowledge). Look to all what
the wisemen of Islam agreed on about the rightness of what was mentioned
that the holy prophet (PUH) taught 'Ali one thousand doors of knowledge,
from each each door there is one thousand doors are opened to him.
Meditate about this and what does it mean and what is wanted by it, and
do not take it easy and lose.  
Their knowledge is not compared by their age, but it is all equal to
whatever age they are, and whoever took a look into their lives and
history would know that fact clearly. Their hearts never stop praising
God, and they know the most about what people need in their lives, rules
and laws, and the disciplines of all the heavenly religions of rules and
laws, worshippings and policies as revealed in its truthful state.  
Nothing is hidden from them about what people and artists did make of
industries, careers, tiniest inventions and the weirdest sciences to the
fullest and they know more than its inventors in these inventions and
nothing of what mankind did make would be out of their knowledge by the
care of God, the Exalted, and His inspiration, because they are the
rulers by God over His creations by whatever means this word would be
understood, and whoever would deny this would be of incomplete faith,
and there are clues and prooves that cut out the road for the opponent
and narrow his way, and they have the knowledge of troubles and what
happened or what will happen until the doomsday, add to that the
knowledge of the Islamic laws as it was revealed on their grandfather
the Chosen \[meaning the prophet\] (PUH), and 'Ali is the one who tells
about himself the holiness and he's the most truthful sayer after God,
the Exalted and His chosen prophet (PUH) when he said: in here (and
pointing to his holy chest) a great knowledge, if only I can find
someone to bear it. He said also (after he swore by God): I've become to
know a secret that if I told you about you would be diffused as the
robes of buckets in the far distant wells. And he's the sayer also: I
know what are in heavens and earth and I know what is in paradise and
hell, and i know what was and what will be..etc. He said also: ask me
before you lose me, and a lot more of the same sayings and what was been
told about his rights by the holy prophets (PUH) is not countable and
one of the most famous speeches for him (PUH): if I wasn't just afraid
that you would say in 'Ali like what the christians said about Jesus the
son of Mary, I would say something that would make you take the sand
from beneath his feet. And from him (PUH) speaking to 'Ali: O 'Ali, no
one loves you but a believer, and no one hates you but a hypocrite, and
so the love of 'Ali is faith and his hate is hypocrisy. Could anyone
count his virtues and miracles?, here is Nahj Al-Balâghah in front of
you, meditate through it and it will guide you through, and how many
times they did the books and detailed his virtues and miracles and Ahmad
ben Hanbal \[an Islamic wiseman or scholar that created a creed in Islam
known by his name\] did show a lot of these \[Nahj Al-Balâghah: a famous
book that collects lot of 'Ali ben Abi Tâlib's speeches, it is a great
source for anyone that would like to see the magic of Arabic tongue, for
'Ali ben Abi Tâlib was and still one of the greatest personnes that bore
the great knowledges of the Arabic language\].  
Al-Shâfi'i \[another scholar that created another creed\] did make poems
about him ('Ali PUH), add to that me also \[the author of this book\],
and also Ibno Abi Al-Hadeed Abdul-Hameed, and Abdul-Bâqi Al-Omari and
others. The wiseman Al-Hilli issued a book that he called "Kitab
Al-Alfayn" (Book of the two thousands) that contained two thousands
clues by logic and by chained speeches for that 'Ali being an Imam and
protected against the wrong doings and the same for his eleven
descendants one by one until the last of them Al-Mahdi the awaited
absent, may our souls be a ransom to him. It is not a speech to show
their virtues and their levels, however, but it was necessary to show
this in this position.
