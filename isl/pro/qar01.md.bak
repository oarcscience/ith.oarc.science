Getting Back From West to The East

Then Ðul-Qarnain got back with his folks and went to the east to see the
nations in that direction and he did with them as he did with people of
the west, and when he finished his trip to the east he went back to the
north of the lands of Romans as it is mentioned by the holy book: he
found upon their hither side a folk that scarce could understand a
saying(Al-Kahf:93), and they were filling the lands and they are Ya'juj
and Ma'juj (Gog and Magog) and they were like animals, eat and drink and
reproduce and they were made of males and females and they look like
people in their bodies and faces, but they were different in other
points, for their height did not exceed five hand-spans, and all had the
same shape, they were naked, never wear anything or any shoes, and they
had hair like the hair of camels that protected them against hot weather
and coldness, and everyone of them had two ears, one of them had
camel-hair and the other had simple hair and the backs of the ears are
like their fronts as well, and they had paws instead of nails and had
fangs instead of teeth, and when one of them desires to sleep he would
make one ear as a bed and cover his self with the other and they are
enough to cover him, and their food is mostly from the sea with its
various types of foods that it provides them with every year at a
certain time by clouds and so they make a living by that, and when they
get that food they get fertile and fat and reproduce and that would be
enough for them until the next year and they eat nothing else, but if
the sea did not provide them with food for one reason or another then
they would get hungry and wander all over the lands and eat everything
they would face in their way and they are more harmful than plagues and
locusts, and if they got into some lands they would make the people of
the land flee away for they are not bearable for their large numbers and
their strength, and no one can get closer to them for being afraid of
them and because of their bad smell, and if they approached some lands,
their voices would be heard from a distance as far as one hundred
leagues, and they spread terror more than storms and earthquakes would
do for their large numbers, and they got humming sounds like bees but it
is greater, and when they get into a land they would devour its beasts
and insects until nothing is left for they leave nothing without
devouring it.  
They say none of them does not know when to die, because each one of
them die after having one thousand descendants, so whenever one of them
gets one thousand descendants, they get prepared to die and asks no more
for a living, and then when the nations around them sensed their arrival
by their humming sounds and Ðul-Qarnain was close to them, they asked
for his help against Gog and Magog, and said to him: we've known what
God gave you of power and of armies with darkness and light, and we are
the neighbors of Gog and Magog and only these mountains between us, and
they have no other way except one way through two mountains and if they
arrived to our lands they would destroy us all with our animals unless
we escape far away from our lands for they leave nothing unless they eat
it, and they devour the cattles and beasts and insects along with snakes
and worms and scorpions and everything that has a soul and no doubt we
have that they fill the land and make its people flee away, and we are
afraid at any moment that they show up from between these two mountains,
and God gave you the power and wisdom with guidance, so make a barrier
between us. He said to them then: bring me pieces of iron, and he
appointed for them the ores of iron and copper, and he appointed for
them two places on the two mountains to get the ores from and showed
them how to extract them, and when they obtained them they said: by what
power shall we cut iron and copper? He then extracted another mineral
from the ground that was called the Sâmoor, and it is so bright, and if
any of it was dropped on iron or copper or any other mineral it would
cause it to melt, so he made from it some tools that they can use to
make anything they want \[I wonder if this Sâmoor metal is meant to be
Chrome?\].  
With it (Sâmoor), Solomon ben David (PUH) cut the stones for the Temple
and the demons brought him this mineral (metal). Then, however, they
collected whatever they want from iron pieces and copper pieces to make
a barrier, and he (Ðul-Qarnain) made a fire for the iron that they made
like stones between the two mountains and they melted down the copper
upon it, and so the copper had been like the mud between the stones and
the barrier was built, and when they measured the distance they found it
is three miles, almost one league or twelve thousand cubits as measured
by the arms of men, and then he dag a deep base for it that almost
reached the water, and he made the width of the barrier as thick as one
mile, that is four thousand cubits as measured by the arms of the
average man, and it might be as measured by their arms at that time and
only God knows. It is mentioned that they made layers of iron and copper
and filled the gap between the two mountains and it started to reflect
yellow and red colors because of copper with some black color of the
iron, and all of that done by the instructions of Ðul-Qarnain, and Gog
and Magog come to this barrier every year once as they say and that
after they spread over their lands and when they reach the barrier the
stop and begin to dig below it until they become despaired they then get
back to spread all over their lands and they will stay like this until
the doomsday time is near, so when its conditions are near and as they
mentioned it is the appearance of Al-Mahdi (PUH) \[the last viceroy and
Imam for Shiites that will appear with Jesus (PUH) to fill earth with
justice\] may our souls be a ransom for him and may God make his
appearance so soon, at that time maybe God will open it (the barrier)
for them (Gog and Magog) and it might be a sign for the appearance of
him (Al-Mahdi) (PUH) to increase the troubles for people or it might be
a punishment for them for their bad souls and all of that at the end of
time. When Ðul-Qarnain finished building the barrier he got back
wandering and in his wandering he met the Wise Nation that are part of
Moses' nation that order with justice and work with it, and he stayed
with them until his death and he did not have such a long age with them
and he got so old and only God knows, and the period between his
wandering all over the lands and his death was five hundred years as it
is mentioned, and we've something opposite to this and that is another
tale also and God is the Knower.
