(Some tales related to our research)

From Musa ben Jafar (PUH), that a jew came and asked the Prince of
Believers (PUH) about a miracle for the prophet (PUH) like the miracles
of other prophets, and that God made Angels prostrate before Adam so
would that be also for Muhammad (PUH)? so 'Ali (PUH) answered: that was
indeed, but God made the Angels prostrate for Adam not for obeying nor
worshipping Adam instead of God, but it was as a confession from them
for the virtues of Adam (PUH), and for Muhammad (PUH) he was given what
is better than this and higher, and that is because God assigned
blessings upon him in His Highness and ordered the Angels to say the
blessings upon him, and also the believers worship and pray by saying
the blessings upon him &lt;&lt;Don't you say in your prayer and other
prayers: Oh God bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad? and this
is in a place much higher and greater than prostrating before Adam
(PUH), and in the speech of God to the damned Iblis: Art thou too proud
or art thou of the high exalted? (Sad: 75), and in a speech for the
prophet of God (PUH) that these "high exalted" are the prophet himself
(PUH), Muhammad ben 'Abdullah (PUH) and 'Ali, Fâtima, Al-Hasan and
Al-Husain (PUT), then said the prophet (PUH): we were in the awning of
the Throne, sanctifying God and Angels with us, before creating Adam by
two thousands years, and when God created Adam He commanded the Angels
to prostrate before him but Did not command us, and so all the Angels
prostrated except Iblis, so then God said to him: Art thou too proud or
art thou of the high exalted? Meaning of the these five that their names
are written on the awning of the Throne.  
From 'Ali ben Al-Husain (PUH): Adam did look to the apex of the Throne
and saw the lights of our ghosts, so then God said to him: O Adam, these
ghosts are the best of my creation. Then He told him their names and
Told him: By them I take and by them I give and by them I punish and by
them I reward, O Adam ask me by them, and when you are in trouble make
them your intercessors to me, because I decided not to refuse any
requests (prayers) made by them. That's why after that after he and Eve
got into the trouble of the sin, he prayed and asked God by their names
so then God made a repentace upon him.  
From an interpretation from Al-Imam Al-'Askari (PUH) in a long speech
and this is part of it: When God put Al-Husain ben 'Ali (PUH) and these
who were with him under the test by the army that wanted to kill him, he
(Al-Husain PUH) saw their large numbers and saw his folks and knew that
they want not but him, and whenever they would kill him they wouldn't
ask for another, and so he released them (his folks) from their swear of
fealty and commanded them to quit and depart him and said to them: let
me with these. God helps me as He used to be with our ancestors, and his
folks did depart him except few of them. His closer relatives and
household refused to leave and told him: we will not leave you until we
die for thee O Abâ 'Abdullah \[another name for Al-Husain PUH\] and when
he saw their assertiveness and that they would not leave him until they
die for him, he said to them: if you decided for yourselves what I
decided for myself then know that God gives the high places for his
slaves by their patience for the troubles they face and that you will
have that from God's gifts to you, and know that this life is just a
dream and the after life is the real awakening. Shall not I tell you our
beginnings? They answered: for sure O son of the prophet, then he said:
When God created Adam, He told him the names of everything, and when He
showed them to the Angels they said "We have no knowledge saving that
which Thou hast taught us" (Al-Baqarah: 32) and He made the lights of
Muhammad, 'Ali, Fâtima, Al-Hasan and Al-Husain and they are the five
ghosts, at the back of Adam, and their lights were shining in the
horizons of heavens, veils, paradises, the Chair (?) and the Throne, and
God then commanded the Angels to prostrate before Adam as an endearment
for he was but a container for these ghosts that their lights shined in
the horizons, so the Angels did prostrate except Iblis who denied to be
humble for our lights we the Household, after the Angels did humbling
and obeyed the command of God and for this their level got higher and
got the honour, and Iblis was damned and exiled out and shame got upon
him and so he is a foe for Him and His faithful slaves until the
doomsday.  
It was mentioned in some tales of Al-Sâdiqiyah \[here, maybe it meant
tales that was told by Al-Sâdiq PUH\] and also from 'Ali ben Ibrâhim
about the saying of God: Till the Day of appointed time (Al-Hijr: 38),
what is meant here is the time when he (Iblis) gets slaughtered by the
hands of the prophet of God (PUH) on the Rock that is in Jerusalem.
Al-Sayed Al-Jazâ'eri said that he (Iblis) was appointed til the day of
the appearance of Al-Mahdee (PUH) and it is the minor doomsday, and
there are lot of tidings about this matter, and we have explained what
is related to this subject in the introduction of this book that you
read now, and the return of the prophets and messengers and in special
our prophet Muhammad The Chosen (PUH) and the purified Imams (PUT) after
the appearance of the "Awaited Absent" may our souls be in ransom to him
to take revenge of their foes, is something that must be and it is one
of the believes for Shiites, or lets say most of the Muslims in general,
and it is called the minor doomsday, but only after the long journey
with troubles and when most of the created would turn away from the path
and life would be full of wrong and injustice, it is then when we shall
see the release is close and it is the time. May God paces up the
re-appearance of Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and May He make
us one of their supporters and companions, and martyrs between their
hands by the rights of the prophet and his purified Household (PUT)
