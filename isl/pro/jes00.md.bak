Jesus The Son of Mary (PUH)

Jesus is the one born with no father and he is an owner for one of the
general laws and regulations and one of "Those of Will" \[meaning his
message was designed for all nations and not only one nation\], and he
is the owner of the sacred Gospel and his mother is virgin Mary, the
purified and the daughter of Amram ben Mâþân, and he is a descendant of
Solomon ben David (PUH). Amram, the father of Mary, was a great man and
one of the nobels among the Israelites and one of the greatest scholars.
His wife, Hannah the daughter of Qâfuðâ, got pregnant and God inspired
to her husband Amram that He shall give him a child that cures the blind
and the leper and resurrect the dead people by the permission of God, so
Amram brought the good tidings for his wife, and so she vowed whatever
in her womb for the House of God, and at that time whenever they vowed
something they would make it for the Temple and a servant for the
Temple, and then she said what the Quran said: My Lord! I have vowed
unto Thee that which is in my belly as a consecrated (offering). Accept
it from me(Âl-\`Imrân:35), and when she gave birth she said: My Lord!
Lo! I am delivered of a female - Allah knew best of what she was
delivered - the male is not as the female; and lo! I have named her
Mary, and lo! I crave Thy protection for her and for her offspring from
Satan the outcast(Âl-\`Imrân:36).  
As attributed to Al-Sâdiq (PUH) that he said: if we told you something
about a man and it didn't happen but it happened to his descendants then
don't deny such thing, because God inspired to Amram that He shall give
him a male that is blessed and cures the blind and the leper and
resurrect the dead by His permission and He shall make him a prophet to
the Israelites, and he told his wife about that and she thought that she
will give birth to a male, but when she delivered what was in her womb
she found that it was a female and she said: My Lord I am delivered of a
female, and when God gave Jesus to Mary it was him that God inspired
Amram about, and when Mary was born, Zacharias guarded her and took care
of her.  
Al-Ridhâ (PUH) was asked once whether that a prophet would tell
something about God and then comes the opposite and he answered: yes,
and then he mentioned this holy phrase: Go into the holy land which
Allah hath ordained for you..etc(Al-Mâ'idah), and they did not go into
it but their descendants did, and Amram ben Mâþân said: God promised to
give me a prophet son in this year and in this month, and then he went
absent and his wife gave birth to Mary and Zacharias took care of her,
and some people said: the prophet of God said the truth, and some others
said: he lied, and when Mary gave birth to Jesus (PUH), the group that
didn't believe him believed in him and all of them said: this is what
God had promised us. "The opposite" as it is mentioned in the narration
and the answer with "yes" by the Imam, it is understood from all of that
that is it only an apparent opposition. It is mentioned among them
\[maybe the author here meant the Christians\] that the one vowed with
must be in the church (Temple) and never go out of it, and when she gave
birth to a female, she said to God as if she was sorry: My Lord I
delivered a female, and the female has a period and she must be out of
the temple and the one vowed with must not go out of the temple, and
also a female is not like a male in serving the worshippers.  
It is mentioned that the purified virgin used to serve them until she
became an adult and then Zacharias stopped her and made a veil for her
against the others and she was named Mary meaning the Worshipper Woman
\[in fact in Hebrew Mariam means the Pure\]. Her naming was meant to
bring the good luck and to ask for closeness from God and to ask God to
make her infallible and special with His gifts and make her as He likes
so that her name coincide with her deeds. For that God accepted her with
good and planted her with good roots and He made Zacharias as her
guardian and some of that was mentioned in the chapter of Zacharias and
maybe you have to check back. There are many narrations for us that
mention how \`Ali, the prince of believers (PUH) and Fâtimah the
daughter of the prophet (PUH) resembled Zacharias and Mary the daughter
of Amram. As Zacharias used to go to Mary and find some fortune with her
and say to her: from where you got this? and so she answers: it is from
God, He gives anyone without any account for it, so did \`Ali and
Fâtimah and many times he (PUH) went to her and found some fortune and
so \`Ali says: from where you got this? and she answers: it is from God,
He gives anyone without any account for it, and there are amazing
stories related to this matter but we left it out because this is not
the place for them and might cause boredom, and it might be that Amram,
the father of Mary, died and his daughter was so young that she needed
someone to take care of her and for this Zacharias, the father of John
(PUT), did take care of her and guarded her. During that whenever
Zacharias the husband of her sister go to her, he used to find some
fortune with her and asked her: O Mary, from where you got this? so she
answered: this is from God, He gives anyone without any account for it.
It is probable that the angels told her that God chose her and purified
her and saved her from being poluted with impurities and the angels
worked on inducing her to worship and work hard to obey God, because she
had a special high place for God, and so God did say: And when the
angels said: O Mary! Lo! Allah hath chosen thee and made thee pure, and
hath preferred thee above (all) the women of creation, O Mary! Be
obedient to thy Lord, prostrate thyself and bow with those who bow (in
worship).(Âl-\`Imrân:42-43). It is mentioned that the angels used to
talk to her and she used to talk to them and so she is a Speaker
\[meaning someone who did speak with angels\]. The angels used to talk
to her directly and God accepted her from her mother and no female was
accepted before her as far as we know. She worked on obeying her God and
He fulfilled her with fortunes from paradise and He chose her and
purified her against every dirt that comes to women and saved her
against every bad language that could be in the tongue and saved her
against every loss or disadvantage from her hands or her feet and
whatever she eats or drinks and in her dwelling place and her clothing
and whatever she hears or sees and everything related to her feelings.
So she was guided by her God and He sent the angels to her to tell her
what He wants from her and what He wants not, and He made her special
with virtues. Then, she gave birth to Jesus without a father and God
made him speak while he was only a child to clean her against whatever
the jews did charge her with and God made her with her son a miracle for
the people.  
As attributed to Al-Bâqir (PUH) about the meaning of the holy phrase: O
Mary! Lo! Allah hath chosen thee..etc, it means: He chose you from the
descendants of the prophets and purified you against adultery and chose
you to give birth to Jesus (PUH) without a man, so God chose her as a
faithful servant and sincere to God and He wanted her to be so, and so
she was one of the most faithful among them and was preferred above all
the women, and like her was the gift of the prophet (PUH), Al-Zahrâ'
(Fâtimah) (PUH) but she was not born without a father but her father was
the prophet (PUH) and she was preferred above all the women of the
creation, and about God's saying: Lo! Allah preferred Adam and Noah and
the Family of Abraham and the Family of 'Imran above (all His)
creatures, They were descendants one of another. Allah is Hearer,
Knower(Âl-\`Imrân:33-34), He chose them among all the creatures and
chose them for His message and for the spiritual characteristics and for
the knowledgement of what the people would need and what solves their
problems, and God made them special with virtues and lifted their levels
and made them tough against everyone with clues and miracles and their
virtues showed up as a sign of their truthfulness and to show they're
preferred upon everyone even the closest angels, and that doesn't oppose
the idea that they were tested by pagans and hypocrites, and He might
cause them troubles so that people won't make them as deities and gods
instead of God, and there is a wisdom for God with what He is doing: He
is not to be asked and they are to be asked. The family of Abraham:
Ishmael and Isaac and their children, and from the descendants of
Ishmael comes our prophet and his Household (PUT), so the family of
Muhammad (PUH) was added to the family of Abraham, adding to them what
God made them special with of miracles and virtues that no other prophet
or angel is near them but everyone in this universe seems like a servant
for them, and this is not a strange thing because they are the leaders
of the universe without a doubt, \[many phrases come then with the same
meaning\], and the family of \`Imrân (Amram) are Moses and Aaron the
children of Amram ben Yas'hur ben Fâhiþ (Kohath) ben Lâwi (Levi) ben
Jacob ben Isaac ben Abraham (PUT), and Jesus with his mother Mary the
daughter of Amram ben Mâþân that is connected to Solomon ben David (PUH)
that is in return connected to Judah ben Jacob ben Isaac ben Abraham
(PUT). They say that the time between Amram the father of Moses and
Aaron and Amram the father of Mary the mother of Jesus was one thousand
and eight hundred years, and between the birth of Jesus and the birth of
Muhammad (PUT) there were six hundred years, and it is narrated by the
way of the Household that they were five hundred years, and between
Abraham and Moses ben Amram there were five hundred years, and
Abdul-Wâhâb Al-Najjâr mentioned in his tales that Shem ben Noah was born
and his father was five hundred years old, and from that time to the
time of Abraham's birth it was eight hundred and ninety years and
Abraham was (when died) one hundred and seventy five years old, and
after the death of Abraham up to the time of Joseph it was one hundred
years, and after his death up to the time of Moses ben Amram it was four
hundred years, and after his death up to the time of Jesus's birth it
was one thousand and eight hundred years, and after his absence up to
the prophet Muhammad (PUH) it was six hundred years, and from the time
of the birth of Jesus up to our time nowadays it took about one hundred
and seventy one years \[1971, the year of publishing the book\], and son
the total since the time of Shem birth up to nowadays it is around five
thousand three hundred and thirty six (5336) years, and the time since
the birth of Jesus up to our time is checked, and whatever is before the
birth of Jesus is mostly dependant upon what is mentioned in Torah, and
God is the Knower of everything.
