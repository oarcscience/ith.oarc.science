Jacob and Joseph (PUT)

<div style="text-align: left;">

Jacob is the son of Isaac ben Abraham, the friend of God, and his mother
is Rebecca (Rebekah) the daughter of Bethuel, and his mother gave birth
to him with a brother of his that is Esau \[Arabic: Al-\`Ays\] and his
name in Torah is \`Eesu \[\`Esav\], so Esau and Jacob are twins and born
together, with Esau coming first then Jacob, and their mother is Rebecca
the daughter of Bethuel ben Terah ben Nahor ben Serug, and the marriage
of Rebecca and Isaac was mentioned before in the doscussion of the
conditions of Isaac. Some historians said that then happened some
conflict and hate between the two and Esau hated Jacob, and they say
that Esau used to like hunting and had a strong soul, and his brother
Jacob was a gentle man with manners and patience with faith so his
mother Rebecca loved him so much and been afraid that Esau would hurt
him with his wrath, and always been afraid that he would be killed by
him so she suggested for him to go to his uncle Laban ben Bethuel ben
Terah ben Nahor, so he went to Iraq to Padan-Aram and stayed with his
uncle and under his service, then his uncle gave him his daughter Leah
\[Arabic: Liyyâ, Hebrew: Le'ah\] for marriage and he had six children
from her: Rawbeen, Sham\`un, Lâwi, Yahuðâ, Riyâlun and Yashjob \[in
Torah they are actually seven: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar,
Zebulun, and Dinah, the first four names are exact translation of the
names mentioned in Arabic, but the others are not so close in
spelling\], and then Leah died so he got married to her sister Raheel
(Rachel) and she gave birth to Joseph and Benjamin, and he got also four
children from two other maids, one of them is called Zilfah (Zilpah) and
the other called Bilhah, and as mentioned in Torah that Bilhah is a
handmaid of Rachel and gave her to Jacob so he got two children from
her, Dan and Naphtali, and Zilpah is the handmaid of Leah and also gave
her to Jacob and so he got two children from her, Gad and Asher, and so
the children of Jacob are twelve males as mentioned in the stories of
Abdul-Wahâb Al-Najjâr, although there are some differences in the names
of the children of Jacob between Torah and as mentioned by Abdul-Wahâb
Al-Najjâr, but their number is agreeable by all that they are twelve
males, and it might be apparent that all the children were born in
Padan-Aram in Iraq while he (Jacob) was with his uncle Laban taking care
of his cattles, then he got back to the land of Canaan in the lands of
Shem with lot of money and fortune, and when he got back he gave his
brother some while he was afraid that he would kill him but his brother
Esau met him with a nice face and gentleness. They say that the children
born in Iraq were only eleven except of Benjamin that was born in the
land of Canaan. God did say: The same did Abraham enjoin upon his sons,
and also Jacob, (saying): O my sons! Lo! Allah hath chosen for you the
(true) religion; therefore die not save as men who have surrendered, Or
were ye present when death came to Jacob (unto Him)(Al-Baqarah:132-133),
and as attributed to Al-Bâqir (PUH): and Jacob was give the prophecy in
the land of Canaan then went to Egypt and died there and then his body
was carried back to the land of Canaan and buried there.  
In Muruj Al-Ðahab for Al-Mas\`udi: Isaac then ordered his son Jacob to
go to the lands of Shem and told him that he got the prophecy along with
his twelve children and they are: Lâwi, Yahuða, Yessâkhir, Bolon,
Yousef, Binyâmin, Dân, Naftâli, Kân, Eshâr, Sham\`un and Rubeel \[this
list seems closer to the names in Torah: Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun,
Joseph, Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Simeon, Reuben\], and
prophecy with power had been made into four of them: Levi, Judah, Joseph
and Benjamin. Then he said: then Jacob been afraid a lot of his brother
Esau and God made him safe from him, and Jacob had five thousand and
five hundred sheeps, and Jacob gave the tenth of that for his brother
Esau to prevent his evil after that God made him safe away from him, so
God punished him in his children for not holding to his oath and God
inspired to him: did not you believe in My promise to you? Then I will
make the children of Esau rule your children for five hundred and fifty
years, and that was the time period by which Romans took hold of
Jerusalem and destroyed the temples and made the Israelites as slaves
until the time of Omar ben Al-Khattâb \[second caliphate for Sunnites\]
when he invaded Jerusalem.
