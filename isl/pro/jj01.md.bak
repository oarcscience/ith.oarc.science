About Calling Jacob as Israel

<div style="text-align: left;">

As attributed to Ka\`b Al-Ahbâr \[the head master of rabbis for jews\]
in a long speech that Jacob was called Israel because he was serving in
the temple in Jerusalem and he was the first to get in and the last to
get out and used to light up the lamps, but one day he saw them turned
off so he stayed for one night in the temple and then he saw a demon
that turns off the lamps and so then he captivated him by a pillar that
were in the temple, and when the people woke up in the morning they saw
a capticated person, and the demon's name was Eel, and so Jacob was
called Israel for this \[meaning that Isra means "captured", and so the
name would mean "he captured Eel"\], but as attributed from Al-Sâdiq
(PUH) that he said: Jacob and Esau were twins, and Esau was born first
then Jacob, and for this he was called Jacob, because he got out after
his brother \[Arabic: Jacob = Ya\`qoob, \`Aqab = to come after\] and
Jacob is Israel and it means "the slave of God" because "Isra" means
"slave" and "El" means "God" in Hebrew, and in another tale "Isra" means
"power" and so the name would mean "Power of God."
