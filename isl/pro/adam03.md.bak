(Useful Caution)

About what was been told in the Holy phrases of the saying of the damned
which is "Now, because Thou hast sent me astray, verily I shall lurk in
ambush for them on Thy Right Path...etc", it is apparent that the damned
thought God made him astray and this is something can't be accepted by
the right-thinking minds and it is against and opposes the justice and
the holiness that are well-known of God may praise be to Him, and above
all these mistaken words about Him He shall be. And so the damned
appointed to God that He made him astray, and this is what is mentioned
in the creed of Jabarism \[Another coined term by me\] of Al-Ashâ'irah
(?) \[seems a branch of this creed\], and it is one of the corrupted
believes without any doubt about that, because its contents is not
accepted by me, nor others would accept it for themselves.  
Is it possible for someone to accept for himself being mentioned that he
obliged a slave of him to do mischiefs and sins and then punish him for
doing this? No and no, and this is the case here of what had been
appointed to God, The most exalted. May God make shame be with them, as
He made it with their master and director and teacher the damned Iblis
may damnations be upon him. All of the matter was because of his wrong
chosen path, and God exiled him and avoided him from His mercy and
banned him from His paradise, because he rebelled and refused His
command to prostrate to Adam (PUH) with the rest of Angels, and them
(PUT) didn't stop for one moment but prostrated directly as they are
commanded to do and they did not think about a reason for this and
didn't get a pride against it, but instead they did obey the command of
their Lord and don't think about anything else except His command, and
never argue about it.  
When God examined Iblis by prostrating for Adam (PUH), he got so high
with his pride and honour for what he was created of and got rebelled,
and God knew his intention and his perversity, and all of his long
worshipping and praising was only for the sake of life and for what he
wishes and deems, and so he got wicked by his soul and obeyed it and so
it owned him and captivated him away from his Creator. And when God
wanted to put him under the test and wanted him to refuse what his soul
is ordering him to do, he disbelieved in His grace and got ready for
war, and so he is a foe for the Great God, The One of Grace, and then
his greatest foe is this to whom he was ordered to prostrate before him
and that is Adam (PUH) so he sat his hate for him (Adam) and for his
descendants until the time of doomsday.
