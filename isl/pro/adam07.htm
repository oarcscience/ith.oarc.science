(The reason for getting Adam down from paradise to earth)</P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><P>From Mos'adah ben Sadaqah from Al-S&#226;diq (PUH) from the prophet (PUH) that Moses the son of Amram [Arabic: Musa ben Imr&#226;n] (PUH) asked his Lord to let him see Adam (PUH) and so He answered him and made him see Ada</FONT>m, and then Moses did say: O Father! you are the one that God created with His own hands and made you live in His paradise and prohibited you from one tree so you couldn't be patient enough til you fell on earth because of it, and couldn't you control yourself away from it and so Iblis seduced you and you followed him and so you are the one that got us out of paradise because of your sin. Then did say Adam (PUH): O son take it easy on your father for the matter of this tree. O son my foe approached by trick and plot, so he swore to me by God that his opinion is a good advice and he said to me: O Adam I am sad for you, so I said to him: and how is that? he said: I enjoyed being with you and you will be out of what you are in now to what you hate, I asked him: and what to do? he said to me: here is what to do, do you want me to guide you to the tree of eternity and an endless reign so you can eat from it with your wife and then you shall both be in paradise with me for eternity, and he swore to me by God&nbsp; and he was a liar that he has the truthful advice, and O Moses I never thought that someone would swear by God and he is a liar, so I trusted his oath and this is my excuse, so tell me son, do you find out from what had been revealed to you from God that my sin<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> was noted before I get created, then Moses said to him: before a long time. Then said the prophet (Muhammad PUH): and so did Adam overcame Moses in the argument. <BR>
From Al-S&#226;diq (PUH) also: when Adam was put out of paradise, Gabriel (PUH) came down to him</FONT> and said: O Adam, didn't God create you with His hands and Breathed into you of His Spirit and made the Angels prostrate before you, and Got you Eve as a wife and Made you inhabit paradise and Prohibited you directly from eating from that tree but you made the sin? Then Adam (PUH) said: Iblis did swear to me by God, and I never thought that someone from God's creation would swear by Him falsely! And what is understood from the previous conversation between Moses and Adam (PUT) that the sin was something meant to be and predestinated long ago before Adam's creation and from the world of atom [It is believed that everything exists in this life including people existed before becoming alive or born in a world or a dimension where they were just atoms], at the time of creating the spirits before his (Adam) existence by two thousands years, and it is a case which was a battle field for several opinions and many people got doomed for their mis-interpretations and not understanding the truth in it, and it is a case of God's judgement and what He Has predestined for His creation before his existence. <BR>
And the solution for this case for us in general is: God founded in this human the power that could aid him in doing what God appointed to him and Made him able to do, and Left him the selection and Gave him the mind and brain with which he can differentiate between what's wrong and whats true, and what would make God satisfied or dissatisfied. After the knowledge and looking into the path of these faithful to God and their viceroys and every allowed path that leads to it (?), that God knows whatever he chooses or does from wether it be a sin or obeying for His commandments, for He knows the ends of workings and deeds that are done by His slaves and no incidents would happen without His knowledgement before his (the human) existence, by his well or bad chose, and He His Highness the one that knows the the guilt of Adam whatever would be acted by him and whatever he would choose, as it is the case with all His creations and slaves, so from Him may praise be to Him the powers and destinies in doings and not-doings, and the selection is made for these of responsibilities by mind, heart and reality, and He is the one who Knows the ends and what&nbsp; these of responsibilities might choose for themselves, if it was good it is good, and if it an evil it is an evil, and there is no forcing for the slave, but it is something in between, because the force and power is from His Highness, and the full choice for these of responsibilities, and God knows what might the slave choose for himself. </P>
