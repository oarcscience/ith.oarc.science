Moses' Soliloquy With His Lord

I will not be able as long as I live to mention how much did Moses
commune with his Lord but the purpose here is to show some of that
light, so if you understood some of these sermons and measured them with
the scale of the mind with what our prophet (PUH) came with, with his
lightful Quran, and with what Islam had provided you with what the
caller for his religion after him (the prophet) and in special the
master of viceroys (\`Ali ben Abi Tâlib), you shall found them both as
twins or two roads for one destination or like a soul in two bodies, and
you shall know that all the prophets and messangers and their viceroys
do all agree on calling to the true path. As attributed to Ibn \`Abbâs
he said: said the prophet of God (PUH): God communed with Moses ben
Amram with one hundred and twenty four thousand words in three days and
nights and Moses did not eat or drink, and when he went out to the
Israelites and he heard the speech of the human beings he hated them for
the sweetness he heard in the words of God.  
As attributed to the prince of believers (PUH) that he said: God said to
Moses: My advice to you comes in four things, first of them is as long
you do not see your sins forgiven then do not work the sins of others,
and the second of them is as long you do not see My treasures been
finished then do not be sad for what fortune you had, and the third of
them is as long you do not see My kingdom vanish then do not seek
someone else, and the fourth of them is as long you do not see the devil
dead then do not be in safe towards his tricks. As attributed to
Al-Sâdiq (PUH): some of what God did say to Moses is that: O son of
Amram, lied he who claimed to love Me and when night comes he slept away
from Me, does not every lover likes to be alone with his love? Here I Am
O son of Amram watching for My lovers when night comes I flip their
sights from their hearts toward Me and showed them My punishment between
their eyes and they talk to Me about what they see and their presence, O
son of Amram give Me from your heart the solemnity and from your body
the submission and from your eyes the tears at the darkness of the
nights then you shall find Me nearby answering you.  
As attributed to Al-Hâdi (PUH): when God talked to Moses, Moses asked: O
my Lord, what is the reward of who believed that I am Your prophet and
You spoke to me? He answered: O Moses, My angels shall come to him and
bring him the tidings of paradise, then Moses asked: O my Lord, what is
the reward of he who stands between Your hands praying, He said: O Moses
I make pride of him among My angels while he is bowing down and
prostrating, while he is standing or sitting and whoever I show pride of
shall never be punished by Me, then Moses asked: O my Lord, what is the
reward of he who feeds a poor for Your sake, He said: O Moses, I shall
command one to call at the doomsday over all the creations that this man
is avoided from being in hell, Moses then asked: O my Lord, what is the
reward of he who did not forget his relations? He said: O Moses, I shall
span his life more and make the death moment easy passing for him and
the guards of paradise shall call him and say to him come and enter from
any gate you like, Moses then asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of he
who avoids hurting people and doing his best for them? He answered: O
Moses, the hell shall call him at the doomsday and say to him "I have no
power against you", then Moses asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of
he who mentions You by his tongue and his heart? He answered: O Moses, I
shall make shade for him by My Throne and make him under My protection,
he then asked: what is the reward of he who tells Your sermons in secret
and in public? God answered then: O Moses he shall pass over the path
just as lightning, then Moses asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of he
who had patience toward the people's wrong and cursed them by You? He
answered: I shall help him to come over the adversities of the doomsday,
he then asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of he who cried because of
solemnity towards You? He answered: O Moses, I shall protect his face
from the heat of hell and I shall make him safe at the day of the great
fear (doomsday), then Moses asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of he
who avoided betrayal for shyness of You? He answered: O Moses, he shall
be in safe at doomsday, Moses then asked: O my Lord, what is the reward
of he who loved Your faithful servants? He answered: O Moses, I shall
forbid My hell for him, Moses then asked: O my Lord, what is the reward
of he who kills a believer and he means it? He answered: I shall not
look at him and never help him, Moses then asked: O my Lord, what is the
reward of he who calls a disbeliever to be a believer? He answered: O
Moses, I shall give him the permission to permit anyone he likes into
forgiveness, Moses said: O my Lord, what is the reward of he who prayed
a praying at its time? He answered: I shall give him what he asks for
and My paradise is for him, Moses then asked: O my Lord, what is the
reward of he who completed his washing (for praying) for his submission
for You? He answered: I shall resurrect him at doomsday with a light
between his eyes that glances, Moses then asked: O my Lord, what is the
reward of he who fasted during Ramadhan for You? He answered: O Moses, I
shall put him in a place at doomsday that he shall not fear in it, Moses
then asked: O my Lord, what is the reward of he who fasted Ramadhan for
the people? He answered: O Moses, his reward is as the reward of he who
did not fast..etc, this is as copied from Al-Sayid Ni\`matullah
Al-Jazâ'iri, may mercy of God fall upon him.
