<br>In the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful
<br>Introduction of The Second Edition</center>
I did not expect when I started to write my book (The prophet, their lifes
and tales) that it would be so famous and hands will try to get it from
the press before it becomes available in the markets, although I did not
come up with a miracle. But all what I was able to do is to show a complete
summary for the lives of some of the prophets and their tales which was
written with lot of mistakes sometimes and fabricated in other times, so
my style was easy and simplified to be fit for all levels, and that had
the good effects over the readers and this is what I thanked God for, and
after a while all the copies were sold out from markets although it was
printed in the offset without a previous permission and we had a tale with
them, and inspite all of that we got lot of requests to re-print it with
some fixes and corrections, so we answered the call of "Al-Tawjeeh Al-Islami"
press, for they publish the islamic book away from the benefits. May God
help these who run it.
<br>Then I ordered our son, the scholar, Mr. Muhammad 'Ali Al-Hasani to
notice out some chapters and check and correct whatever mistakes did occur
by coincedence in the first edition to let out this new edition in a satisfactory
and proper way compared to the researches of this book, and that it gets
the satisfaction from the readers and the Prevention is for God's only.
<br>I won't exaggerate when I say that when I started writing I've feared
the situation, because the search is in the lives of prophets died thousands
of years ago, and in their lives that was full of action and humanity and
dignity and nobility, and to mention the mysteries of these long times
of their movements and their lives and spreading out the religion that
was assigned to them by God, and for which God did send them and made them
prophets and messengers, but this fear did fade away when I started and
began although it did take lot of my time in looking at the numerous resources
and investigating that needs a time not be considered easy and checking
in some stories and tales that opposes each other sometimes in the life
of each prophet, not as the books I made before and after this book whatever
was printed of them and whatever still written, until God helped me with
success so it came out with this relatively good picture to the existence,
and thanks to God firstly and lastly, asking Him to Accept it from me with
a good acceptance and Give me from His grace, and Make the believers that
avoid the stumbles benefit from it, and God is the Helper.
