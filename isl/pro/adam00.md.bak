About Some Conditions of The Father of Human Beings "Adam" (PUH) and The
Beginning of This Creation

Said God in his Holy Book: And when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I
am about to place a viceroy in the earth, they said: Wilt thou place
therein one who will do harm therein and will shed blood, while we, we
hymn Thy praise and sanctify Thee ? He said: Surely I know that which ye
know not.  
Since "Viceroy" by language and tradition points out to what takes the
place of what was before in time, then there must have been another
Responsible agent before him (Adam), and that is pointed out by the
opposition of the Angels, and this opposition is not done except by them
for they bear the knowledge of the ex-mischiefers because they said
"Wilt thou place therein one who will do harm therein and will shed
blood, while we, we hymn Thy praise and sanctify Thee?" and it was
pointed out by news, tidings and traces that the existence of pre-Adam
creatures did take place and they are the Djinns and others and earth
was full of them. And also pointed out of the existence of lions, beasts
and all of the other animals, and also the existence of rulers and
vicegerents for God, command by His commandment and prohibit by His
prohibition, so they were ordering for Goodness and prohibiting the
Mischiefts, but the Djinn got wicked and rebelled, and they refused the
commandments of God and changed lot of His orders and laws.  
From 'Ali ben Ibrâhim from Albâqir (PUH) from the Prince of Believers,
'Ali ben Abi Tâlib (PUH) that he said: When God wanted to create a
creation by His hand and that was after Djinn and Nesnas spent seven
thousands years on earth, He removed the layers of heavens and Said to
the Angels: Look to the inhabitants of earth from my creation of Djinn
and Nesnas, and when they saw what was done by them (Djinn and Nesnas)
of mischiefs and evils, that grew hard upon them (Angels), and said: our
Lord you are the Almighty, and this is Your weak worthless creation,
live by Your grace and refuse to take your orders and You don't take a
revenge of them? And when He heard that from the Angels He said "Lo! I
am about to place a viceroy in the earth" and he will be a ruler on
earth. The Angels said: Are You going to place someone that will make
mischiefs and evils as the Djinn did? May you make the viceroy one of
us, and we don't refuse Your commandments and "we hymn Thy praise and
sanctify Thee", so the God said: I know what you know not, I want to
make a creation by my Hand and make out of his descendants prophets and
faithful slaves of mine and guiders. I will make them rulers on my
creations in my earth and purify my earth from the Nesnas and move the
rebellious Djinns those who refused my commandments away from my
creation and make them live in the air and shattered across the lands
and make a veil between Djinns and my creation. Angels then said: Our
Lord You command and prohibit, praise to You, no other god than You, and
You have the knowledge of everything. Then they got farthest (Angels)
from the Holy Throne a distant of five hundreds years of travelling.
Until the Imam ('Ali ben Abi Tâlib PUH) said in a long speech: then God
held the clay of Adam (PUH) and worked on it the four natures of air,
mucus, bitterness, and blood. And connected with the air the love of
women, length of hope and caution. And connected with the mucus the love
of food, drinks, goodness, gentleness and easiness. And connected with
bitterness the anger, stupidity, evil, pride, and haste. And connected
with the blood the love of women, pleasure, and doing sins.  
And the summary of some of the tidings is that God created Angels from
light, and created Djinn from fire, and created Adam from clay, then He
ran the light, the fire, the air and water, so with light he saw and
understood and by fire he ate and drank, and if it wasn't the fire in
the stomache (the heat of the stomache) food won't be cooked (digested),
and if it wasn't the air in the body of people to flame the fire, fire
wouldn't be existed, and if it wasn't the water existence to cool it
down and extinguish it, the stomache would have been burnt and the body
would be burnt in return.  
And it has been said that it was meant by the black wind of stomache -or
soul- that it might be the stomache's movements with breathing that
leads to the foundation of cells with the heat of the core (?)  
And the most probable that Adam (PUH) was created from all types of
clays and if he was created with one type only people wouldn't know each
other and all would be with one shape, but instead he was created from
the easiness of the earth and its sadness, bitterness, sweetness, and
saltness, and from all its shapes and colors, from its whiteness,
redness, yellowness, blackness and (blondeness)..etc and that's why you
see human beings differ in their colors and types.  
From the Prince of Muslim (PUH) that God sent Gabriel and ordered him to
bring from the skin of earth (Arabic: Adeem) four clays: white, red,
yellowish and black and that would be from its (earth) easiness and
sadness. Then He ordered him (Gabriel) to bring four types of waters:
sweet, saline, bitter, and stinking. Then He ordered him (Gabriel) to
pour all the waters in the clay so He made the sweet in his throat, the
saline in his eyes, the bitter in his ears and the stinking in his
nose.  
And in "Tawheed Al-Mofadhal ben Omar" (??) from Al-Sâdiq (PUH): The
sweet water was placed in the throat to make him (Adam or the human)
able to eat and taste the food, and the saline water was placed in the
eyes to protect the flesh of the eyes since the flesh will remain when
salt or saline water is placed on it. And for the bitter water in the
ears it is to protect the brain from the attacks of insects and
organisms since they die when they reach the bitter water in the ear.
Maybe they can get pass over the bitter water and reach the brain for
their power and the small quantity of bitter water in the ears and that
might be because of the weak body for it might be a sick man, old man,
or a child. And they brought many cases, tidings and witnesses for the
truthfulness of such analysis and some of those cases were during the
time of Plato and other perfect doctors that found an animal (organism)
that grew up in the brain and didn't find any other way than the ears to
let it reach there.
