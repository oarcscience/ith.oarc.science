Getting Out From The Jail to The King of Egypt

God desired not but to make things go along for a reason, for He said:
We made a reason for everything. When God wanted to release Joseph (PUH)
after many years in jail, He prepared a reason for him, and the king saw
his dream about seven fat cows getting out of the river and went into a
green field, then he saw seven ugly thin cows getting out of the river
also and ate the seven fat cows, then he woke up and slept again and
then he saw seven good ears of grain and behind them seven bad ears of
grain, and the bad grains ate the good ones, and then in the morning the
king became so annoyed about these two dreams. Then he called for the
magicians and priests to interpret this dream, but none could give an
answer, and they said to him: Jumbled dreams! And we are not knowing in
the interpretation of dreams(Yousof:44). At that time the cupbearer
recognized and remembered what happened to him with his friend with
Joseph (PUH) in the prison and so pointed out to the king that only
Joseph can solve this puzzle, and he interpreted their dreams as if he
was looking what will happen by his eyes, and so when he suggested that
to the king and suggested that he goes to Joseph in jail and ask him,
the king sent him to Joseph and when he saw him he said: Joseph! O thou
truthful one! Expound for us the seven fat kine which seven lean were
eating and the seven green ears of corn and other (seven)
dry(Yousof:46). Then Joseph (PUH) interpreted that for him and that is
Egypt will face seven fertile years and then will be followed by dry
seven years that will empty the granaries from grains, and so they have
to manage this so that when the dry seven years come they would find
something to live by until things would get back to normal as it was
before.  
Then the cupbearer got back to the king with his interpretation with
details, and when he heard that he got delighted and knew that it is the
truth for it goes along with the dream's symbols, and also for he knew
before how truthful he is, and also he interpreted the dreams for the
servants and it happened as he said, then the king said: bring him to
me, and when he ordered that, Joseph denied going out of the prison
until he knows that reason for being here in the first place and asked
the king to ask the women that cut their hands before, and so when he
brought them and asked them about Joseph they said: Allah Blameless! We
know no evil of him, God did say about that: And the king said: Bring
him unto me. And when the messenger came unto him, he (Joseph) said:
Return unto thy lord and ask him what was the case of the women who cut
their hands. Lo! my Lord knoweth their guile..etc(Yousof:50). Joseph did
not like going out of the jail with people considering him still as a
criminal, and so he desired not to go out of jail unless with honour and
innocence and never mocked for any mistake, and when all the women
testified that he was innocent then the wife of the king (noble) found
no escape to confess and admit the truth and for this she said: Now the
truth is out. I asked of him an evil act, and he is surely of the
truthful(Yousof:51).  
What we understand that Joseph (PUH) had a high place in jail and
everyone respected him and he became like a ruler for the jail and
everyone that comes in there and this is pointed out by the speech of
the cupbearer of the king and also the king's messenger with Joseph when
he said "Joseph! O thou truthful one!, Expound for us the seven fat
kine..etc." Then when the women testified for the innocence of Joseph
and the wife of the noble (king) saw that the one who put him in prison,
now working on getting him closer, and that the charges made against him
did not change anything of his high place, she became humble for his
high place and gave up her anger against him and became tender towards
him for he had places in her heart, and she got back to the path of
truth after charging him for things he did not do, while she insisted on
that all the past years, and so she confessed what no woman would
confess against herself, and she gave up the secret that she kept away
from her husband and her relatives and said: Now the truth is out. I
asked of him an evil act, and he is surely of the truthful. (Then Joseph
said: I asked for) this, that he (my lord) may know that I betrayed him
not in secret(Yousof:51-52), and she said: I do not exculpate myself.
Lo! the (human) soul enjoineth unto evil(Yousof:53), and when the noble
of Egypt saw the situation and saw how high is Joseph and how he is able
to do what others can not do, and how trustful he is, he ordered for him
to be out of jail and said to him: Lo! thou art to-day in our presence
established and trusted(Yousof:54), and since Joseph did not mind going
out to the king, he went out and answered the king for his request, and
he liked his logic and his wisdom, he (the king) asked him: what job you
like to take that brings happiness to you? So he said: Set me over the
storehouses of the land. Lo! I am a skilled custodian(Yousof:55), and so
God said: Thus gave We power to Joseph in the land. He was the owner of
it where he pleased(Yousof:56). Al-Þa\`labi mentioned in his book
"\`Arâ'is Al-Majâlis" that the king of egypt which was Al-Rayyân ben
Al-Waleed believed in God by the help of Joseph after that he saw how
truthful he was and made Joseph take care of the storehouses in the
land. Also said Al-Þa\`labi: when Al-Rayyân died, Qâbus ben Mos\`ab ben
Al-Rayyân became a king after him, and he did not believe in God and was
a tyrant, and he died, then his brother Abu-Al-\`Abbâs Al-Waleed ben
Mos\`ab ben Al-Rayyân became a king.  
It is seems to be that Al-Rayyân ben Al-Waleed was their grandfather and
the speech of Al-Þa\`labi was about the conditions of Moses (PUH) and it
is a long speech with lot of details, and he mentioned that the pharaohs
that ruled the Israelites were four: Al-Rayyân, the noble of Egypt, and
Qâbus ben Mos\`ab, and his brother Al-Waleed ben Mos\`ab ben Al-Rayyân
and the fourth was the pharaoh of Moses (PUH) and he was the most tyrant
of all, and God knows better.  
About this matter, Torah mentioned what is in summary: Then Joseph said
to them: you must save the fifth of the lands production in the fertile
years for the dry years, and to be ready to face famine, and this should
be done by guards all over the land. Then the pharaoh said to his
soldiers: can we find someone like this man? Then he looked at Joseph
and said: we do not have someone like you in wisdom so you shall manage
all the matters, but I will be higher than you in place, and also said
the pharaoh to him: I've appointed you all over the land of Egypt, and
then took off his ring from his finger and placed it in the hand of
Joseph, and made him wear his clothes and put around his neck a golden
necklace and made him ride in his second chariot and called for the
people to prostrate before him, and he appointed him all over the land
of Egypt and the owner of commands and he made him marry the daughter of
Futi-Fâre\` (Potiphera) the priest of Ur-Asnât (On), and Joseph at that
time was thirty years old when he had the kingdom of Egypt and married
Asnât (Asenath), then Joseph went out all around Egypt to note what
should be done for the hard years and to face the famine, and then he
went on working to order and took care of matters in all the fields and
crafts, and only the king was higher than him.  
What we understand from clues is that after the death of the king of
Egypt all the rule came into the hands of Joseph without anyone opposing
this for they knew how just and wise he was, and there were no bad deeds
for him to mock at him, and so he was a brilliant worker and wise noble,
and so Joseph became the king after the death of the king, and all the
others were his assistors, and it is mentioned that after the death of
the king and that was during the dry years, the wife of the king,
Zalikhâ became so poor and needy, so they said to her: wouldn't you see
the king, and it was Joseph (PUH), she said: I am shy of him, but they
insisted until they made her sit in his way, and so when Joseph
approached with his march she stood for him and said to him: O thanks be
to God that made the kings slaves by the evil acts, and made the slaves
kings by their worshipping, so then Joseph said to her and she was old:
did not you do me this and that? She said then: O prophet of God do not
blame me, I was troubles with three that none was troubled with before,
and he asked: what are they? She said: I was troubled with your love and
God did not create some one like you, and I was troubled with my beauty
for there were no woman as pretty as I was and nor had money as much as
I did, and I was troubled with my husband for he was impotent, so then
Joseph said to her: what is your need? She said: ask God to get me back
my youth, and so he did and her youth was back to her, and then Joseph
married her and she was virgin, and there is another tale about this
matter but incremented with that he mentioned Muhammad (PUH) and
mentioned that he is better than him in creation and so she believed in
him and God ordered him to marry her and so he did.
