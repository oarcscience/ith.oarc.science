<center><font size=+3>Gospel of Mark</font></center>
Notice the book of Muruj Al-Akhb&acirc;r Fi Tar&acirc;jim Al-Abr&acirc;r
that was printed in Beirut in 1880A.D. by Potros Qurm&acirc;j, and notice
what he says about Murqus (Mark), and that he was a levite jew and he was
a pupil of Potros (Peter) the well known, and he is one of the Messiah's
followers and he denied the divinity of the Messiah and was killed in a
jail in Alexandria in 68A.D. by pagans, and they say that he wrote his
gospel by the supervision of his master Peter in 61A.D. to make the nations
profit by it and so they were turned to christians by his services, and
so was mentioned in the book of Al-F&acirc;riq Bayn Al-Makhlooq W'Al-Kh&acirc;liq.
