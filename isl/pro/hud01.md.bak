The Land of A'ad and Their Crafts

In the interpretation of 'Ali ben Ibrâhim: A'ad's land was in the desert
and they had plants and lot of palms, and they had long ages and tall
bodies and worshipped idols so God send to them Hud to call them back to
the rightful religion but they denied and did not believe in Hud and
hurted him so the sky catched its rains from them for seven years until
aridity became over them, and Hud was farmer and was watering the land
when some people came to his door asking for him so then an old woman
with one eye came out for them and asked: who are you and what do you
want? so they answered: we are from a land and our land was affected by
aridity so we came to Hud to pray to God to let the rain come over with
fertility to our lands. So she said to them: If prays of Hud were to be
answered he would pray for himself first, this is his land became arid
and his plants was burnt for the scarcity of water, so they asked: and
where is he? so she told them where he was and they went to him and made
a complaint for him and said to him: O prophet of God, our land became
arid, and we've come here to ask you to pray to God to let rains come
over our lands, so when he heard their complaints, he went to pray and
asked God for what they wanted and then said to them: go back to your
lands, the rain did fall. Then they told him what they saw and heard
from that woman in his house, so he said (PUH): this is my wife and I
pray to God to give her the long age, so they wondered: and how is that?
So he answered: because God never created a believer without an enemy
that hurts him, and she is my enemy, and to have an enemy that I own is
better than having an enemy that owns me.  
So Hud (PUH) kept on calling his people to worship God and deny
worshipping the idols to make them happy in this life and the after-life
and may their lands be fruitful and their fortunes may increase and win
the paradise of the after-life, and it is as God said: And, O my people!
Ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn unto Him repentant; He will
cause the sky to rain abundance on you and will add unto you strength to
your strength. Turn not away, guilty! They said: O Hud! Thou hast
brought us no clear proof and we are not going to forsake our gods on
thy (mere) saying, and we are not believers in thee.(Hud:52-53). So,
when they did not believe God sent upon them the "Sarsar" wind \[sarsar
is the word mentioned in Quran to describe this wind\], and it is the
one of extreme coldness, and it is what God said in the chapter of
Al-Qamar: Lo! We let loose on them a raging wind on a day of constant
calamity(Al-Qamar:19).  
And in the chapter of Al-Haqqah: And as for A'ad, they were destroyed by
a fierce roaring wind, Which He imposed on them for seven long nights
and eight long days so that thou mightest have seen men lying
overthrown, as they were hollow trunks of palm- trees (Al-Haqqah: 6-7),
and so they were continuous \[notice in this line the author is
explaining a word in Arabic that meant to be continuous but the
Pickthall translation used the word "long"\], and the first and the last
of the eight days was Wednesday and it is a day of continuous calamity
(ill-luck).  
And from Al-Kâfi \[book's name\] as reported from Abi Ja'far Al-Bâqir
(PUH) that he said: God has soldiers of winds to torture with it anyone
that He wants of those who denied His commandments and for every wind
there is an angel that controls it, so if God wanted to torture some
people with any type of winds He commands him (the angel that controls
that wind for torture) and the angel commands his wind and it becomes
agitated like a mad lion. Then he said (PUH): for every wind there is a
special name attached to it, don't you hear God's saying about A'ad: Lo!
We let loose on them a raging wind \[sarsar\] on a day of constant
calamity(Al-Qamar:54) ? and His saying: fatal wind \[Al-\`Aqeem\]
(Al-Thâriyat:51), and: a wind wherein is painful torment (Al-Ahqâf:46).
And God did say: a fiery whirlwind striketh it and it is (all) consumed
by fire(Al-Baqara:266).
