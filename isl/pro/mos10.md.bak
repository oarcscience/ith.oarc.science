\[Ash\`abite, I coined this term meaning the adjective of "Ash\`ab."
Ash\`ab was a famous character in the Arabic folklore that resembles
stupidity and also funny stories, and the author here points to the
stupidity or the funny personality of the pharaoh, as to mock at him!\]

The Miracles of Moses and The Ash\`abite Psychology of The Pharaoh

When Moses finished telling his message to the pharaoh and his people
and showed the miracles: the staff, the hand, the dry years, the fruit
corruption, the flood, the locusts, the vermin, the frogs, the blood and
the terror (or pollution), these were miracles that were given in
details, and the pharaoh was a tyrant man made everyone as a servant for
him and the Egyptian nation used to believe in his worshipping and his
holiness, and Moses surprised him with something that he does not
accept, which was meant to be putting him down from the throne of
holiness, so he started to nagotiate and debate with Moses and asked
him: what is the God of the worlds? He said: the Lord of heavens and
earth and what is in between, for He is the Creator for them and for
what is in between and He is the Maker, then the pharaoh turned around
him looking at the people showing signs of surprise and saying: do you
hear? While Moses kept saying: your Lord and the Lord of your fathers as
well, meaning He is the ancient God before the foundation of the pharaoh
and before he becomes worshipped by his folks, so then the pharaoh said
to his folks: the prophet that was sent to you is insane for he is
saying things that we never heard before nor we do believe in, and Moses
kept on saying: the Lord of the east and west and whatever in between
them if you are someone to understand. When Moses and Aaron knew that
the pharaoh was a stubborn man and careless about Moses and his message
and he (the pharaoh) will disbelieve them for sure, they said to him:
we've been inspired that the punishment shall be revealed upon him who
lies, so he said to them: who is your Lord O Moses? He answered: He is
the One that counted everything He had created, for He is the One that
gave you the senses and the mind and created for you everything on earth
and made you viceroys and rulers after rulers and guided you to use
everything you meet for your own benefits, then the pharaoh started to
ask questions while Moses answering them one after another, so he asked
him about the early centuries and said to him: what about the early
centuries? So Moses denoted that only God knows by saying: their
knowledgement is in the hand of my Lord in a book that my Lord shall
never forget nor astray about it, and He will judge every human being
about his deeds, and then Moses made the gifts of God that he was
ignoring clear to him by saying: Who hath appointed the earth as a bed
and hath threaded roads for you therein and hath sent down water from
the sky and thereby We have brought forth divers kinds of
vegetation(TaHa:53), and made it easy for the human being to find what
he eats and for his cattles what they graze upon, and the One who did
such deeds, His deeds must be signs that guide someone with a thoughtful
mind, and earth is our source and to it we shall be back again and from
it we will be produced again to be asked for what we did, so God said:
Thereof We created you, and thereunto We return you, and thence We bring
you forth a second time(TaHa:55).
