Dear reader, notice that Jethro is an approximated name for this
prophet. In the translation of the chapter of Moses you will find that
the author of the book pointing out that Moses did not marry the
daughter of Yiþrun or Yiþri, who was a faithful man or the chief of
Midian, and apparently this name is just Jethro, the name that was
mentioned in Torah. But since muslims believe that Moses married one of
Shu\`ayb's daughter, and since in Torah it is mentioned that Moses
married the daughter of a man called Jethro, I decided to let Jethro as
a representative name for Shu\`ayb since it is more of Latin sense, but
be careful not to mix things together, Jethro is still not meant to be
the same person that Torah pointed out as for muslims do!  
 

Shu\`ayb (Jethro) The Prophet (PUH)

He is Shu\`ayb (Jethro) ben Nowayt ben Ra\`u'eel (Reuel) ben Murrah ben
\`Anqâ' ben Midian ben Abraham (PUH) \[notice: unfortunately I couldn't
find the ancestry of Jethro in Torah to check with the name listed above
in Arabic, but for Nowayt it is close to the name Nahath mentioned in
Torah as one of Reuel sons, but Reuel is a son for Esau and do not
follow the chain mentioned here, but Nahath and Nowayt have some
similarities as you can see\], and his tongue was Arabic and was sent
from the people of Midian as it is mentioned in Muruj Al-Ðahab, and
\`Atâ' \[seems a person's name\] said: He is Shu\`ayb ben Nowayt ben
Midian ben Abraham (PUH) and he was called the Speaker of Prophets for
his billiant ways in debate with his people and his talent in proving
his point against his people and disapprove their clues, and his people
here is meant to be the people of Al-Aykah (the dwellers in the wood),
and some say that he was sent twice, once to Midian and once to Al-Aykah
(and it is a place near Midian with lot of waters and trees). It is
mentioned that he was the first one to measure the balance with his
hands so they were measruing with honesty but then they cheated in their
measures so then they were taken by a great shake and left dead in their
dwelling place, it is mentioned also that he sent some messangers from
his side to the people, and one of his messangers was Shu'ayb ben Sâlih,
he sent him to his (Shu\`ayb ben Sâlih's) people but they killed him and
threw him in a well, and it is possible that he was sent to the lands of
Shem as it is shown by history and traces, and one of his messengers was
Hassân ben Sinân Al-Awzaâ\`ee, he was the messanger of Jethro to the
lands of Africa so he went to them calling for faith in God and work to
fullful His commandments, but they called him a liar and kept him a
prisoner in a hole until he died, and another one was Al-Hâriþ ben
Shu\`yb Al-Ghassâni, and he was Jethro's messanger to Midian but they
called him a liar and killed him as well. Jethro used to cry a lot, and
as attributed to Anas ben Mâlik that he reported from the prophet (PUH)
that he said: Jethro cried for God's love until he became blind, and
then his sightness was brought back to him by God, then he cried again
until he became blind and God brought his sightness again, and so on
until the fourth time when God inspired to him: O Jethro, until what
time you shall be crying? If it was for your fear of hell, then know
that I protected you against it, and if it was for your love for
paradise, then know that I made it for you, so then he said: O my Lord
and Master, You know that I did not cry for the fear of Your hell nor
for the love of Your paradise, but Your love is knotted in my heart and
I can't keep patience to see You, then God inspired to him: if it was
like that then I will send to you my speaker Moses ben Amram (PUH) to
serve you, and this story could have many interpretations, maybe the
most probable of all is that he meant "I will keep crying until I see
you after my death."  
What we understand from all of this is that Jethro was alone and had no
one to believe in him and in his Lord and in the right path, except of
hypocrites, so he was hated by everyone, and had no one to love except
of God, like for someone that has only one child and loving him so much
and afraid to lose him so he keeps on being sad. What is said by the
prophet Jethro to God is exactly in the same meaning of what the prince
of believers, \`Ali ben Abi-Tâlib (PUH) said: I did not worship You for
my fear of Your hell, nor for my love to Your paradise, but I found that
You are the One that to be worshipped and so I did.  
The chapters the mentioned the story of Jethro (Shu\`ayb) are:
Al-A\`râf, Hud, Al-Shu\`arâ', Al-\`Ankabut, and others. God said: And
unto Midian (We sent) their brother, Shu'eyb. He said: O my people!
Serve Allah. Ye have no other Allah save Him. Lo! a clear proof hath
come unto you from your Lord; so give full measure and full weight and
wrong not mankind in their goods, and work not confusion in the earth
after the fair ordering thereof. That will be better for you, if ye are
believers.Lurk not on every road to threaten (wayfarers), and to turn
away from Allah's path him who believeth in Him, and to seek to make it
crooked. And remember, when ye were but few, how He did multiply you.
And see the nature of the consequence for the
corrupters!(Al-A\`râf:85-86), and there are lot of others holy phrases
and the contents are almost the same.  
Midian was the name of his village and there lived his tribe and the
father of the tribe was Midian the son of the Abraham (PUH) and so the
village and the tribe were named after him, for this God did say "And
unto Midian (We sent) their brother, Shu'eyb," meaning that We sent
their brother Shu\`ayb (Jethro) to Midian, and he was sent also to
Al-Aykah (the wood dwellers) and they were also part of his people, and
we've mentioned before that Al-Aykah is near by Midian and it is a place
of lot of waters and trees, and so he came to them with what was
revealed on his grandfather Abraham (PUH) from the Exalted One, he came
to them with the fair laws of His religion with whatever it contains of
regulations and worshipping and what is prohibited and what is allowed
and what would bring them happiness in life and the after-life, so he
ordered them to be fair in their measurements while weighing to give the
right amount by themselves so they don't cheat in their dealings with
others, and not to do mischiefs on earth after being fixed by others
before them, by prophets and messangers and their viceroys with the
faithful men, and not to follow the lusts and doing sins and not to
allow what God forbade and forbid what God allowed just to follow the
lusts. They used to sit on the roads and try to keep the people away
from reaching him for they were afraid that they will leave the
worshipping of the idols, and they used to mock at his way (of guiding)
and warn and threaten everyone that believes in him and wanted to make
the path of God to be crooked, and they did their best to ignore the
calls of Jethro (PUH) and they used to say to him: O Shu'eyb! We
understand not much of that thou tellest(Hud:91), and also they humbled
him by saying: and lo! we do behold thee weak among us(Hud:91), and then
they threatened him by saying: But for thy family, we should have stoned
thee, for thou art not strong against us(Hud:91), but inspite of all of
this he kept on calling for the faith of God until he embarrased his
people by proving the falsehood of their beliefs and proved to them the
righteousness of his path, for he was calling to what they hate of the
faith and to be straight in their dealings and fair, so when they got
annoyed by his clues against their religion, their tyrants gathered
together and threatened him to banish him out of the village with his
followers if they did not get back to their religion, but he answered
them by saying: Even though we hate it? We should have invented a lie
against Allah if we returned to your religion after Allah hath rescued
us from it(Al-A\`râf:88-89), but that would be if God wanted to keep us
away from His closeness. God forbids to make the one who called for Him
and who called to His path astray. So, their only way was to warn their
people not to be tricked and join his religion telling them that they
will be losers if they did so. The most important thing that they were
denying about his religion is that he ordered not to worship what their
fathers used to worship and not to do whatever they like in their money
and in their measurements and dealings with others.  
They mocked at his prayer that orders him with these commands as they
claim and they said to him as to mock at him "thou art the mild, the
guide to right behaviour." After all he kept on being patience and come
to them from time to time and proving their falsehood until God ordered
for them to be destroyed, and the earthquake seized them, and they were
all destroyed as if they did not live there and Jethro with his
followers were saved. Then God sent him to the people of Al-Aykah and it
was close to Midian and there lived some God worshippers, and some said
that it was in the deserts of Midian and Jethro was a foreigner for them
and they used to do as the people of Midian used to do, so when he
commanded them not to do so they said to him: Thou art but one of the
bewitched; Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the
liars(Al-Shu\`arâ':185-186), for they thought that God do not send a
human to human beings to guide them and they did not know that God makes
His message where He desires.  
They asked him for miracles and asked him to make pieces of the sky fall
upon them to prove that he's truthful, and they did not ask him for
guidance to the true path, and so they were taken by the punishment of
the day of gloom, when God revealed upon them an extreme heat for seven
days until their waters were boiled. Then God drove a cloud to them and
they gathered under the shadow of that cloud to avoid the heat and then
the cloud rained them with fire so all were burnt and died and God said
about that day: Lo! it was the retribution of an awful
day(Al-Shu\`arâ':189). Some said that they were destroyed by an
earthquake and some said that God revealed an extreme heat on them that
took their breathes away, so then they went inside their homes but it
got into their homes as well and no shadow nor water could avoid them
that. Then God sent to them a nice breeze and they called each other to
follow that breeze and when they were all out and gathered under the
cloud, God made it rain fire on them and the earth shaked under their
feet and they were burnt like locusts and turned to ashes, and this is
the day of gloom. Some said that God sent to them one shout and they all
turned to be dead.  
It is mentioned that Jethro was sent to two tribes, one of them was
destroyed by the earthquake and the other by the day of gloom, and there
should be no contradictions between the tales since all tales point out
to one thing in general which is their destruction by God for their
rebellious nature against God and His prophet \[2 lines come then but I
did not get what the author meant!\].  
It is mentioned that after the destruction of his people, Jethro went
back to his original place and the dwelling place of his tribe and that
is Midian with his faithful followers and he lived there, and there he
met Moses ben Amram (PUT), and it seems that it was a fertile land and
their people used to live in luxury and they were traders and their land
was a destination for many others, and its location might be in
Palestine and whatever is mentioned about its location saying that it is
between Hijâz and the lands of Shem does not oppose that idea (of being
in Palestine), and we've mentioned before the speech of Al-Sâdiq (PUH)
when he said that God sent only five prophets from Arabs and they were:
Hud, Sâlih, Ishmael, Jethro and Muhammad (PUT), and in a speech for
Al-Bâqir (PUH) he said: God inspired unto Jethro that He will punish one
hundred thousand of his people, forty thousand of their tyrants and
sixty thousand of their good ones, so he (Jethro) asked: and why the
good people O Lord? Then God inspired unto him: for their easiness with
the tyrants and they did not be angry along with My wrath, and as
attributed to Ibn \`Abbas he said that Jethro lived for two hundred and
forty and two years, and some of its relative stories would come in
advance in the chapter that discusses the conditions of Moses ben Amram,
may peace be upon him and upon our prophet (PUT).
