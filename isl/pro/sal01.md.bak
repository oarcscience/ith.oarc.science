Properities of The She-Camel

This she-camel has special properities which make her destinctive from
other she-camels, such as the large size of her body and its attractive
color that is mainly brown with yellow and her dense hair, and her
ability to drink the water of all the people so that nothing of it is
left at the day of her drink, and also giving milk so much that it was
enough for the people at that day, the youngs and adults, to drink, and
also whatever was on earth of plants was a pasture for her and no one
has the right to prohibit her from that, and she didn't use to hurt or
do damage towards anyone either in self or his plants or his trees, and
she did not need a guard, and the rest of the animals used to get afraid
of her and get off her way.  
What is understood from the Holy Phrases about the she-camel is that no
one of Þamud should do harm to her or to her food or her drink that was
appointed for her at her appointed day, and she also don't approach the
water at the day of their drinking, so her meanings and her
characterestics are not obvious except for the One who created her. For
this they were warned and the threat was directed to them whenever they
wanted to harm her, and the punishment will befall on them for the
slightest harm they might do or for killing her, and Sâlih (PUH) did his
best with his people to advice them for he had the pity on them with
sincerity, and carried so much of their cause and had patient with them
to the fullest, and he was lonely with sorrow for them for they were his
people and his tribe and his beloved if only they obeyed God, but what a
sorrow (You would be heard if you were calling a living, but there is no
such life when the one you're calling).  
He used to remind them of the gifts of God to them and try to prohibit
them to do mischiefs on earth and worship other gods instead of the true
God, and also prohibited them to be tyrants on earth with pride, and for
the main heads and tyrants in his people had the pride upon him and they
didn't accept to be governed by the commandments and prohibitions of
Sâlih like the other people and become under his rule after their pride
and their rule, and for them such matter is something not to be
discussed and not to be taken as it is for their pride keeps them from
being under the rule of a man that had no money nor power, and they
never look at what they were worshipping of idols that have no benefits
nor harm, no feelings and don't talk to them or guide them, and they
would know that the Creator is some One else only if they did meditate
and understand.  
Sâlih (PUH) is His messenger to them and his prophecy was proved by the
miracles that none of the creatures would make, and the mischiefers that
had the rule among the people of Sâlih went to the believers that
followed him and asked them as if they were mocking: do you know that
Sâlih was sent from his God? And their answer to them was: we are
believers in whatever he was sent for. Then the tyrants said: we
disbelieve in what you've believed in. We've pointed out before that the
destruction of the people of Sâlih ,for their killing of the she-camel
and refusing the commandments of God and His prophet, was done by the
Cry as was mentioned in the Holy Quran in God's saying: And the (awful)
Cry overtook those who did wrong, so that morning found them prostrate
in their dwellings(Hud:67). Yes, and Quran also mentioned several ways
of punishing them with the quake, the thunders, tyranny..etc as in the
chapters of Al-A\`râf, Al-Ðâriyât, Al-Hâqqah and Al-Sho\`arâ' , and no
doubt that all of the other ways of punishing were revealed all
together, because the Cry which is the great noise, is done by the
thunder and mostly accompanied with the quake and we shall believe that
the conditions for the Cry are all satisfied in the Holy Phrases, and
also the tyranny which is the expansion of the circle of destruction
that was revealed upon them and upon what they used to worship and upon
where they used to live, so tyranny overcame them and their homes as
mentioned in His saying: Then see the nature of the consequence of their
plotting, for lo! We destroyed them and their people, every one, See,
yonder are their dwellings empty and in ruins because they did wrong.
Lo! herein is indeed a portent for a people who have
knowledge(Al-Naml:51-52).  
With no doubt it is apparent that the people of Sâlih were in doubt
about his prophecy and his message and his truthfulness about everything
he claimed about the prophecy and the message of God to them before the
foundation of the she-camel and her weanling, especially the main
tyrants of them, and it is probable that some of them believed just by
calling them back to God with showing them the clues for that as it is
with the rest of the messengers and prophets for such people had wisdom
and kind hearts and the good-will, and mostly they are the weak people
on earth, and they said to the tyrants of the people of Sâlih: Lo! In
that wherewith he hath been sent we are believers(Al-A\`râf:75). Yes,
and when he got with the great miracle of his which was the she-camel
out of the rock as they requested, those who were on faith been even
more faithful, and it is probable that all of them believed in him at
that time if it wasn't for the devil's seducation and the soul that runs
after mischiefs and the stubborness of the harsh disbelievers that
grabbed with them those of weak faith and those who have no working mind
or wisdom. And in a famous speech (Hadith) \[this line probably taken
from a famous Hadith for the prophet Muhammad PUH\]: People are
following their kings religions for their greedness for this life's
wreckage and their fear of power. So from here and there, those of
stubborness got back from being faithful without a clue or a prove, and
been doubting and disbelieving, and said to him: Let whatever you were
promising come over us if you were saying the truth. And as a witness
for this we have God's saying: And as for Thamud, We gave them guidance,
but they preferred blindness to the guidance(Fossilat:17). So, the
she-camel is the miracle to prove the truthfulness of Sâlih and his
message from God to them, and it is a test for them, for God did say:
Lo! We are sending the she-camel as a test for them; so watch them and
have patience(Al-Qamar:27), so by her, the prove was done and the
forbidden happened along with the torture, and all is said and done, and
God did say about this: We never punish until we have sent a
messenger(Al-Isrâ':15).
