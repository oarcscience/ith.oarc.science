And Some Historians Said

It is famous from the speeches of those who deal with the story of A'ad
that they are destroyed after the existance of Abraham (PUH) and the
building of the Holy House in Holy Mecca, and said: it is poissble the
A'ad were the longest living people on earth and also the greatest in
bodies. And who said that A'ad is the son of \`Ewas ben Iram then he got
so far with that, because in such a short time it is not possible for
Iram to generate such a huge tribe that works on earth and be proud of
its strength as A'ad used to be, for they were people of agriculture and
enslaved people as it is mentioned by Hud (PUH) in his saying to them as
been told by the Holy Book: Do ye build a landmark on every high place
to amuse yourselves? And do ye get for yourselves fine buildings in the
hope of living therein (forever)? And when ye exert your strong hand, do
ye do it like men of absolute power? Now fear Allah, and obey me. Yea,
fear Him Who has bestowed on you freely all that ye know. Freely has He
bestowed on you cattle and sons, And Gardens and Springs.
(Al-Sho'arâ':128-134).  
They also mentioned that the headquarter of A'ad and their homes were in
the land of Ahqâf and it is located in the north of Hadramawt, and their
place now is just a sandy location with no one living thing after that
great construction, and Al-Ahqâf means the place of lot of sands as in
the language. And as mentioned before they used to worship the idols
instead of God, the Exalted, as the people of Noah (PUH) used to do. It
is reported from Ibn Abbâs that they had an idol called "Samud" and
another one called "Al-Hattâr", so then God sent to them Hud (PUH) and
he was from a tribe called "Al-Khalood", and he was one of nobles with a
nice-looking face, with a shape and body like them, white with a long
beard, so he called them to worship God and believe in the One and stop
worshipping the idols and doing wrong to people, but they refused to do
so and called him a liar and said: Who's stronger than us? And Hud used
to warn them and give examples for them with the first people of A'ad
and people of Noah (PUH) before them and remind them of the gifts of God
and explained to them that he has no greed for their money and fortunes
but he is only commanded by God to guide them and God only rewards
him.  
As there were people of might and ego among the people the of Hud, there
were also people of faith and mind and believed in him and followed him,
but the people of wrong were much more in number so they refused Hud and
ignored all the clues that he brought for the truth until God destroyed
them and their body turned to be like empty palms' trunks. It is
apparent that the people of Hud were the second A'ad and not the first
as some believed that the second A'ad after the people of Hud are the
people of Sâleh (PUH) and they are Thamud that lived in Yemen from
Qahtân and Saba' (Sheba), and their conditions will come later on, and
only God knows. Some said, and as reported by the people of Hadramut,
that Hud (PUH) lived in Hadramut after the destruction of A'ad until he
died there and buried on the eastern parts of it not far away from the
town of Tareem near the valley of Berhut. So we say, and this is the
right, that Hud (PUH) was buried in the valley of Salâm (valley of
peace) near the shrine of the prince of believers Ali ben Abi-Tâlib
(PUH), and near the graves of Adam and Noah (PUH), and beside him Sâleh
(PUH) with a high dome above them and their shrines underneath it, and
they have their own servants and people visit them in that wide part of
Iraq.  
You should know that Quran mentioned the story of A'ad with Hud (PUH) in
ten Suras (chapters): Al-A\`râf, Hud, Al-Mu'minun, Al-Sho\`arâ',
Fussilat, Al-Ahqâf, Al-Ðâriyât, Al-Qamar, Al-Hâqqah, Al-Fajr. And the
mentioning of Hud (PUH) was included for seven times in them, and might
be the mentioning of A'ad is for the first A'ad like in the chapter of
Al-Fajr, because it is also mentioned with it the city if Iram, the
many-columned. Because both of A'ad of Hud and the one before it were
tyrants, but both of them are different as mentioned before, and for
this purpose He said: Lo! A'ad disbelieved in their Lord. A far removal
for A'ad, the folk of Hud!(Hud:60). This speech is from Him, the
Exalted, is call for their destruction and in it you will find the
reasons for their destruction and the repetition of their story is to
show how awful is their matter, and also for meditating and take the
wisdom from their story and avoid their deeds, and He said "folks of
Hud" to make a destinction betweem them and between the owner of Iram,
the many columned. In the Hadith: people must be filtered and be tested
so their good be known among their bad ones. Look by the eye of your
heart to the story of Hud (PUH) with his people you will see a respected
man with wisdom and high manners with great feelings, worshipper and
ascetic, and also with pride and dignity with a hard faith and believe
in God, the Exalted, for the disbelievers he was the torture and for the
believers he was a passionate father, this is Hud (PUH), and look to the
great evil that was represented in A'ad and their saying to him: Who is
mightier than us in power? Hard in their refusing and in their sayings,
rude and proud, with no manners and filthy tongue, disbelieving in
paradising, but Hud (PUH) never reacted for this evil with evil, but in
the contrary, passion and kindness and sincerity never leave him in his
callings for his people. Look to their saying to him: Lo! we surely see
thee in foolishness, and lo! we deem thee of the liars(Al-A\`râf:66),
and look to his answer to them: He said: O my people! There is no
foolishness in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds. I
convey unto you the messages of my Lord and am for you a true
adviser(Al-A\`râf:67-68). Meditate in this sincerity from a righteous
prophet, mighty in the cause of God with dignity and pity for his people
against the torment of the Almighty and His destruction, and he is
scared for them against His anger for whoever rebel against His will and
did not have mercy for himself by obeying his Lord, so he speaks to them
with the language of passion and kindness and high manners, and they
face him with that savagery, and he reminds them of the gifts of God for
them like the fortunes, the sons, the gardens and watersprings, and
reminds them that they are ignorant to His gifts to them, and He made
them special by giving them the huge bodies and the might with dignity
of the tribe and made them viceroys on earth after the people of Noah,
and reminds them that believing in God will bring to them even more
fortunes and happiness in this life and in after-life, and their answer
to him was that to humilate him and being surprised and wondering about
his message and calls where he called for them to worship one God alone
away from their gods and whatever their fathers used to worship before
them, and even called him a crazy and claimed that some of their gods
revealed mental illness on him as a punishment for his arguments about
their rights and for trying to stop worshipping them, look to this lying
about his honorable place, and they claimed that some of their gods and
not all of them caused him to be with mental illness, but his answer to
them was: I call Allah to witness, and do ye (too) bear witness, that I
am innocent of (all) that ye ascribe as partners (to Allah), Beside Him.
So (try to) circumvent me, all of you, give me no respite, Lo! I have
put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Not an animal but He doth
grasp it by the forelock! Lo! my Lord is on a straight
path(Hud:54-56).  
And let it be known that whatever Hud (PUH) did is a matter that is
should done by everyone that assigned to the mission of ordering by
goodness and prohibiting the bad deeds and guiding people and teaching
them the laws and regulations of the religion and it is matter for every
religious scholar, and we've mentioned before that mentioning such
matters is for guiding and to take the wisdom out of them, and everyone
is a slave for God and His own creation and let the guiders and wisemen
take Hud (PUH) as an example, for he said to his people: And if ye turn
away, still I have conveyed unto you that wherewith I was sent unto you,
and my Lord will set in place of you a folk other than you. Ye cannot
injure Him at all. Lo! my Lord is Guardian over all things(Hud:57).  
And thanks to God the Lord of all and prayers be upon His prophet the
chosen, and his descendants the purified and upon the rest of prophets
and messengers until the time of the doomsday.
