Gospel of Luke

The story of Luke is even weirder than that of Matthew and Mark, and he
was a physician from Antakya (Antioch) and he didn't see the Messiah at
all and he was taught the christianity from Polos (Paul) which was a
fundamentalistic jew against the christians and he didn't see the
Messiah in his life and used to harm christians, and they said that he
found out that it's of no use to harm the christians while he needed
them so he preteneded to be one of them and showed that he believed in
the Messiah and he claimed that he had an epileptic fit and the Messiah
showed himself for him and touched him and ordered him not to harm the
christians, and since that time he believed in him and the Messiah sent
him to spread his gospel, and talking about him would be long and bad to
hear, and he legalized for them to eat the carrion and the wine drinking
and that he knew that faith only is enough to servive without doing
anything, and the writing of the gospel of Luke was after that Mark
wrote his own and that was after the death of Peter and Paul, and some
well-known christian writers wrote about Luke and his gospel: he had
mixed the lies of novels with the truth of the miracles, and some of
them said: Matthew and Mark are different in their writings and if they
agreed then their saying is more probable than the saying of Luke, and
the one who copied these lines, \`Abdul-Wahaâb Al-Najjâr said: let the
reader know that Luke mentioned many things in his gospel adding to what
was mentioned in the gospel of Matthew in some twenty locations, some of
them are miracles and some of them are different stories, and his
additions compared to Mark are counted as so much.
