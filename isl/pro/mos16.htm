<center><font size=+3>Some Historians Said</font></center>
When the folks reached the lands of Sinai peninsula, the sun there was
extremely hot and there were no homes that they can live in and no trees
to be under their shadows, so they complained to Moses about the harshness
they are facing so he prayed to his Lord who brought then a cloud to that
place to make the shade for them and protect them against the sun, and
because their supplies was to be over and they missed the meats with their
fear of being kept in hunger God then sent to them the winds carrying the
manna and the quails, and when they passed from the eastern coast and they
had no water then for their drink and for their cattles, they complained
to Moses and asked for water, so God then commanded him to strike the rock
with his staff and when he did so, twelve springs then gushed out, and
after all of that they were not satisfied what God revealed for them and
what favours He made special for them, so they asked their prophet Moses
(PUH) to have a fine living conditions and asked for what they used to
eat of vegetables and herbs and the various kinds of cucumbers and garlic
and grains for bread and other cookings and lentils and onions and so on,
as if they were cattles just want to eat and to work, and they do not look
back at what they were in of humiliation and slavery for the pharaoh and
his people and how their women were treated like slaves and they were attacked
in their honor and been humilaited more than the folks of Saba' (Sheba),
and their children were used to be killed in front of them with no mercy
for them, and thier men were kept for the hard work and to remove the dirt
and every humiliating job, as tyrants usually do with the slaves, and with
the prophet of God they turned to be free and own themselves and work in
complete freedom and dignity and worship the truthful God, the Lord of
all, without someone to wrong them, under the mercy of the One of Mercy
who saved them from humiliation and turned them to dignity and eternal
happiness, but this did not awaken their determination that was turned
down by the pharaoh and the household of the pharaoh and the adversities
that came over them for long times which made humiliation is a second nature
for them planted in their hearts and their sights and their hearing and
the instinct that has the total control of their feelings, and so on.
<br>The clues for all of this are all provided by the holy quran, so God
said in the chapter of Al-Baqarah: And when ye said: O Moses! We are weary
of one kind of food; so call upon thy Lord for us that He bring forth for
us of that which the earth groweth - of its herbs and its cucumbers and
its corn and its lentils and its onions. He said: Would ye exchange that
which is higher for that which is lower? Go down to settled country, thus
ye shall get that which ye demand(Al-Baqarah:61), and in the chapter of
Al-A`r&acirc;f: And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and
they came unto a people who were given up to idols which they had. They
said: O Moses! Make for us a god even as they have gods. He said: Lo! ye
are a folk who know not. Lo! as for these, their way will be destroyed
and all that they are doing is in vain. He said: Shall I seek for you a
god other than Allah when He hath favoured you above (all) creatures?(Al-A`r&acirc;f:138-140),
And of Moses' folk there is a community who lead with truth and establish
justice therewith. We divided them into twelve tribes, nations; and We
inspired Moses, when his people asked him for water, saying: Smite with
thy staff the rock! And there gushed forth therefrom twelve springs, so
that each tribe knew their drinking-place. And we caused the white cloud
to overshadow them and sent down for them the manna and the quails (saying):
Eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you. They wronged Us
not, but they were wont to wrong themselves (Al-A`r&acirc;f:159-160), and
in the chapter of TaHa: O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your
enemy, and we made a covenant with you on the holy mountain's side, and
sent down on you the manna and the quails, Saying): Eat of the good things
wherewith We have provided you, and transgress not in respect thereof lest
My wrath come upon you: and he on whom My wrath cometh, he is lost indeed.
And lo! verily I am Forgiving toward him who repenteth and believeth and
doeth good, and afterward walketh aright(TaHa:80-82), and so on of many
clues.
