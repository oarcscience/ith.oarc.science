Mu'tamar \`Ulamá' Baghdád  
"The Conference of Baghdad's Ulema"  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*<u>Translator's Word:</u>*

This is a humble translation for the famous story of "Mu'tamar \`Ulamá'
Baghdád" which occurred at the time of the Seljuk king Malikshah I
(Maliksháh Seljuqi), the son of the Seljuk king Alp Arsalan. Along in
this story, the minister or Vizier as was he called, Nizam Al-Mulk, was
the minister of Malikshah I and helped him to organize this event. Both
of them, the king and the minister were assassinated in the same year of
1092 AD (around 485 AH in Islamic calendar). For more information about
the Vizier and the king and also this story, you can refer to
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam_al_Mulk.md).  
It is interesting to see that the entry in wikipedia contains 3 versions
for the story of the assassination of the vizier and the king, and the
last version is linked to this story which you are about to see its
translation.

Before proceeding in reading, it is better to see some terms:  
Ulema: it is used to denote religious scholars who gained a deep insight
into religion and its teachings and laws. In modern language Ulema can
have the same concept of "Scientists." For this reason I will use the
word "Ulema" to denote religious scholars and nothing else.

Ben: A term means "the son of." It was mainly used in old names and
still used in some countries to tell the full name of someone.

Pronunciations:  
" ' " : Simply, a glottal stop.  
" \` " : A hard glottal stop. Like the above but voiced.  
Á: Long vowel like in "car" or "father."  
Gh: Like french "R" sound.  
Kh: Like "CH" in "Bach" or "Loch."  
Ð,ð: Like "TH" in "there"  
\[...\]: These brackets to add my own comments.  
(PUH): Peace Upon Him. It is an expression used by Muslims for every
holy person like the prophet or Jesus or the Household of prophet
Mohammed.  
(PUT): Peace Upon Them  
X:Y : denotes a phrase from Quran. X is the number or order of the
chapter, and Y is the number of the phrase.

The Conference of Ulema of Baghdad

Written by  
Muqátil ben \`Atiyyah

Second Edition  
with corrections and important comments  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've found this precious book written in the library of Rájá Mahmood
Ábád written by the author's own hand, and we got this precious pearl in
the year of 1300 after the immigration of the prophet may peace be upon
him \[meaning 1300 AH\].  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful

Thanks be to God alone and peace be upon him he who was sent as a mercy
for the worlds, Mohammed the arabic prophet and upon his Household, the
purified and upon his true followers.  
And after that: This is the book of (The conference of the Ulema of
Baghdad) that was held between the Sunnis and Shiites that were gathered
by the great king (Maliksháh Seljuqi) under the supervision of the great
scholar and vizier (Nizam Al-Mulk), and the story was like this:  
The king was not an extremist and a blind man, who follow the ancestors
with blindness and racism, but he was a young man with an open mind who
loves wisdom and Ulema and in the same time he used to like
entertainment and hunting.  
His Minister (Vizier) was a virtuous wise man who did not indulge in
life, with a strong will and liked the goodness and its people,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
always investigates after the truth, and liked the Household of the
prophet so much, and he established the Nizamiyyah school -in Baghdad-
and he made for the people of science (wisdom) monthly salaries, and
used to be kind over the poor and the needy.  
Once upon a time, a great scholar named (Al-Husayn ben Ali Al-\`Alawi)
entered before the Malikshah and he was one of the greatest Shiites
Ulema. When the scholar got out from the court of the king some of the
attendance mocked at him, so the king said: why did you mock at him? The
man said: Don't you know O king that he is one of the disbelievers that
God spread his wrath and damnation over them? The king said -surprised-:
and why is that? isn't he a muslim? The man said: no, he is a shiite!
The king said then: and what is the meaning of Shiite? aren't shiites
one part of muslims' creeds? The man said: no, they don't recognize
Abu-Bakr and \`Umar and \`Uthmán as caliphs, the king then said: and is
there a muslim that do not recognize those three as caliphs? The man
said: yes, these are the shiites, the king then said: if they don't
recognize those three companions of the prophet as caliphs then why do
people call them muslims? The man said: that's why I said they are
disbelievers.... The king then thought about it for a moment and then
said: we should call the vizier Nizam Al-Mulk to see the situation.  
The king called Nizam Al-Mulk and asked him about the shiites: are they
muslims? Nizam Al-Mulk said: Sunnis differed in that, some of them said
that they are muslims because they -the shiites- testify: there is no
other god save but Allah, and Mohammed is the prophet of Allah and they
pray and fast (in Ramadan), and some of them say that they are
disbelievers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The king said: and how many are they? Nizam Al-Mulk said: I can't count
them precisely but they make up almost half of the muslims. The king
said: is half of the muslims are all disbelievers? The vizier said: some
scholars claim that they are disbelievers but I don't. The king said:
then can you O vizier call the scholars of shiites and sunnis to
elaborate this matter? The vizier said: this is a difficult task and I'm
afraid over the king and the kingdom! The king said: why? The vizier
said: because the case of shiites and sunnis  is not a simple case, but
it is a case of truth and falsehood and many bloodshed ran for this
matter and libraries were burnt and women were taken captives and there
were many books that were made and wars were started for this matter!!  
The young king was surprised for this weird case, then he thought for a
moment and said: O vizier, you know that God gave us the wide kingdom
and the mighty army so we must thank God for this gift and our thank
should be in the form of investigating about the truth and guide the
astraying person to the rightful path, and one of these two creeds must
be rightful and the other must be wrong, so we must know the truth and
follow it and know the wrong path and leave it, so if you - O vizier -
prepared such a conference with the attendance of the shiites and sunnis
ulema along with the generals and the writers and the rest of the heads
of the state, so if we found out that the truth is with sunnis we should
then force the shiites to get into that creed by force.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
The vizier said: and if the shiites refused to get into the creed of
sunnis then what shall you do? The young king said: we kill them! The
vizier said: is it possible to kill half of the muslims? The king said:
then what is the cure and the solution for this? The vizier said: it is
to leave this matter.  
The conversation finished between the king and his wise minister, but he
remained that night with a busy mind and worried and didn't sleep until
next morning, for how come he can't find a solution for this problem.
And in the early morning he called Nizam Al-Mulk and said to him: we
shall call upon the ulema of the both creeds and we shall see from the
arguments and conversations which one is true, and if the truth was with
the sunnis then we shall invite the shiites by the wisdom and the good
advice and attracted them with money and fortune like how the prophet
(PUH) used to do with non Muslims, and in that way we shall be able to
serve Islam and muslims. Then said the vizier: your opinion is good, but
I'm afraid of this conference! The king said: why the fear? The vizier
said: because I'm afraid the shiites will win over the sunnis and their
clues will rule over us and people will fall in doubt! The king said: is
that possible? The vizier said: yes, because shiites obvious clues from
Quran and the Sunna \[Sunna means the acts of the prophet that were
reported by his companions and followers\] that their creed is correct
and true! But the king was not convinced by such an answer from his
minister (Nizam Al-Mulk) and said to him:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
It is a must to bring the ulema from both creeds to discover the truth
and make it distinct from falsehood. Then the vizier asked for a time
limit of month to prepare the matter, but the young king refused that...
and finally it was decided that the time limit should be of fifteen
days.  
In these days, the vizier (Nizam Al-Mulk) gathered ten men from the
greatest sunni ulema that are dependable for history and laws and hadith
\[hadith: reported speech of the prophet\] and the basics and arguing,
and brought as well ten of the greatest shiites ulema, and that was in
the month of Sha\`bán \[Sha\`bán: 8th month of islamic calendar\] in the
Nizamiyyah school in Baghdad, and the conference was held upon these
conditions:  
First: The research should go on from morning until evening with
exception to the time of prayers, food and break.  
Second: The arguments should depend on assured resources and dependable
books and not on what is heard and rumors.  
Third: The arguments that go on in this conference shall be recorded.

And on the assigned day, the king sat down and his vizier and his
generals and the sunni ulema sat on his right and the shiites ulema sat
on his left, and the vizier made the opening for the conference (by
saying): In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful and peace be
upon Mohammed and his Household and his companions, then he said: the
argument should be just and asking for the truth

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
should be the goal of everyone and none of the companions of the prophet
(PUH) should be insulted.  
Said the great scholar of the sunnis (and his title was Al-\`Abbási): I
can't argue with a creed that make all the companions as disbelievers.  
Said the great scholar of the shiites (and his title was Al-\`Alawi and
his name was Al-Husayn ben Ali): and who are they who make the
companions as disbelievers?  
\`Abbási: you shiites make all the companions as disbelievers.  
\`Alawi: this talk of you is against the reality. Is not Ali ben Abi
Tálib (PUH) and Al-\`Abbás and Salmán and Ibn \`Abbás and Al-Maqdád and
Abu-Ðar and others are all of the companions, so do we shiites make
those companions as disbelievers?  
\`Abbási: I meant by all companions Abu-Bakr and \`Umar and \`Uthmán and
their followers.  
\`Alawi: you rescinded yourself by yourself, did not the people of logic
say that (the partial positive is against the total negative), so you
once say that shiites consider all companions disbelievers and once you
say that shiites consider some companions disbelievers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
And here the vizier wanted to talk but the shiite scholar didn't give
him the chance to do so and said: O great vizier, no one has the right
to talk unless we are unable to answer, otherwise it would be a mix up
in the research and astraying the argument from its path without any
results.  
Then the shiite scholar said: I make it clear to you O \`Abbási that
your claim that shiites consider all the companions disbelievers is an
apparent lie.  
\`Abbási couldn't answer and his face turned red and then he said: leave
that and tell me, do you shiites insult Abu-Bakr and \`Umar and
\`Uthmán?  
\`Alawi: some shiites insult them and some others do not.  
\`Abbási: and you, \`Alawi, in which side are you?  
\`Alawi: I don't insult, but my opinion that those who insult have their
point, and their insults to these three is not a crime and not a
disbelief or a heresy and it is not one of the small sins.  
\`Abbási: did you hear O king what this mean is saying?  
\`Alawi: O \`Abbási, directing the speech to the king is astraying, and
the king brought us here to talk about the clues and proves

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
and not to judge by the force and the weapon.  
The king: it is true what \`Alawi is saying, what is your answer O
\`Abbási?  
\`Abbási: it is obvious that he who curses the companions is a
disbeliever.  
\`Alawi: it is obvious for you and not me. What is the clue that
everyone who curses the companions after investigating and knowing the
truth is a disbeliever? Don't you agree that he who is cursed by the
prophet deserves to be cursed?  
\`Abbási: I do.  
\`Alawi: then the prophet cursed Abu-Bakr and \`Umar.  
\`Abbási: when did he do that? this is an apparent lie against the
prophet.  
\`Alawi: historians of sunnis mentioned that the prophet prepared an
army under the command of Usámah and he made in the army Abu-Bakr and
\`Umar, and he said: God damns he who lags back from the army of Usámah,
and then Abu-Bakr and \`Uthmán lagged from the army of Usámah, so they
were included in the damnation of the prophet, and he who is damned by
the prophet can be damned by any muslim.  
Then \`Abbási looked down and did not say a word.  
Then the king said (to his vizier): is it true what \`Alawi said?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Vizier: historians did mention that.<sup>(1)</sup>  
\`Alawi: And if insulting the companions was a taboo and a disbelief,
then why don't you say that Mu\`áwiyah ben Abi Sufyán \[Muawiyah I, the
first ruler of the Umayyad dynasty\] that he is a disbeliever and you
don't consider him a heretic for cursing imam Ali ben Abi Tálib (PUH)
for 40 years and that extended even further to 70 years!?  
The king: cut that discussion and talk about another subject.  
\`Abbási: one of you innovations you shiites that you don't believe in
Quran!  
\`Alawi: it is but one of your own innovation you sunnis, and the clue
is that you say that Quran was gathered by \`Uthmán, so was the prophet
unwise to do what \`Uthmán did, so that he didn't gather the Quran until
\`Uthmán comes and gather it? Then, how come the Quran was not gathered
at the time of the prophet and the prophet used to order his followers
and companions to

(1): in Tabaqát Ibn Sa\`ad, the second section, Part 2, page41 and in
Táreekh Ibn \`Asákir Part 2, page. 391 and Kanz Al-\`Ummál Part 5, page
312 and Al-Kámil for Ibn Al-Atheer Part 2, page 129.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
read all the Quran and he said: he who reads all of the Quran gets this
and that of such rewards, so is it possible that he orders to read all
of the Quran if it was not already gathered, and were muslims all
astraying until \`Uthman came and saved them? <sup>(1)</sup>  
<sup>The king (to the vizier): is \`Alawi true about what sunnis said
about \`Uthmán gathering Quran?</sup>  
<sup>Vizier: that's what the interpreters and the historians
said.</sup>  
<sup>\`Alawi: you should know O king that shiites say that the Quran was
gathered at the time of the prophet as you see it now, and no single
letter was missed nor added to it, but sunnis say that Quran was added
to and some of it was dropped and the prophet didn't gather it but it
was gathered by \`Uthmán when he became a ruler.</sup>

<sup>(1): historians mention that \`Uthmán gathered the holy books and
then burnt it - to mock at it - and so did Al-Bukhári mention in his
book in the section of virtues of Quran, and Al-Bayhaqi in his book
\[Al-Sunan\] part 2, page 41, and Kanz Al-\`Ummál part 1, page 281, and
Al-Taháwi in Mashkal Al-Áthár part 3, page 4. And Oh my God, is the
burner of the Quran deserves to be a ruler? What crime can be more awful
than this? (the publisher)</sup>  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Abbási (and he wanted to take the opportunity): did you hear O king?
This man doesn't call \`Uthmán a caliph, but he calls him a ruler
\[meaning a ruler like any ruler and not a legal caliph assigned by
muslims\].  
\`Alawi: yes, \`Uthmán was not a caliph.  
The king: why?  
\`Alawi: because shiites believe that the rule of Abu-Bakr and \`Umar
and \`Uthmán is illegal!  
The king (surprised): why?  
\`Alawi: because \`Uthmán became a ruler by the votes of six men
designated by \`Umar and all of them didn't vote for \`Uthmán except of
two or three of them, so the legitimacy of \`Uthmán depends on \`Umar,
and \`Umar became a ruler by the will of Abu-Bakr, so the legitimacy of
\`Umar depends on Abu-Bakr, and Abu-Bakr became a ruler depending on the
votes a small group by threatening and force, so the legitimacy of
Abu-Bakr depends on force and for this \`Umar said about him: the
agreement of people for Abu-Bakr to be a ruler was something of the age
of ignorance \[meaning something barbarous from the era before Islam\],
may God protect muslims against it and if someone did it again then kill
him<sup>(1)</sup> and Abu-Bakr himself used to say:

(1): Al-Sawá\`iq Al-Muhriqah for Ibn Hijr page. 8. Al-Milal Wal-Nihal
for Al-Shahrestáni and others.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
spare me for I'm not the best of you and Ali is the best within
you<sup>(1)</sup> and for this reason shiites believe that the rule of
these is illegal in origin.  
The king (to the vizier): is it true what \`Alawi is saying about the
talk of Abu-Bakr and \`Uthmán?  
Vizier: yes, this is what the historians mentioned!  
The king: then why do we respect these three?  
Vizier: following the steps of the good ancestors!  
\`Alawi (to the king): O king, say to the vizier: is truth worthy to be
followed or the ancestors? Is not following the ancestors is against the
truth as it is included in God's saying (Nay, for they say only: Lo! we
found our fathers following a religion, and we are guided by their
footprints, 43:22)!?  
The king (to \`Alawi): if these three are not the successors of the
prophet of God then who is the (rightful) successor?  
\`Alawi: the successor of the prophet is imam Ali ben Abi Tálib.  
The king: and why he is a caliph?

(1): this speech was mentioned by Al-Qawshaji, the sunni scholar in his
book "Sharh Al-Tajreed."  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Alawi: because the prophet assigned him to be a caliph after
him<sup>(1)</sup> where he (the prophet PUH) pointed out that he (imam
Ali) shall be the caliph many times, and one of these times is when he
(PUH) gathered people in a place between Mecca and Medina called
"Ghadeer Khum" and then he raised the hand of Ali and said to muslims:
he whoever I'm his ruler, then this is Ali his ruler, O God be on the
side of he who is on his side and be an enemy to him who becomes his
enemy and be helps who helps him and let down who lets him down, and the
he (the prophet) got down from the pulpit and said to muslims -who
counted as much as 120,000 persons- : greet Ali by the name of the
caliph of believers, so muslims came one by one and they said to Ali:
peace upon you O prince of believers, and then came Abu-Bakr and \`Umar
and greeted Ali (PUH) by the name of the prince of believers and \`Umar
said: peace upon you O prince of believers, Bakhin Bakhin \[bakhin
bakhin is an expression of congratulating in Arabic\] for you O son of
Abu Tálib, you became my prince and the prince of every believing man
and woman<sup>(2)</sup>. Then: the rightful caliph

(1): sources that mention that the prophet assigned imam Ali ben Abi
Tálib as a caliph are so much and some of them are: Táreekh Ibn Jurayr
part 2, page 62. Kanz Al-\`Ummál part 6, page392. Saheeh Al-Tarmaði and
Saheeh Ibn Májah and Musnad Ahmad ben Hanbal and Mustadrak Al-Saheehayn
and Tafseer Al-Rázi and Al-Sawá\`iq Al-Muhriqah and other of hundreds of
dependable books.

(2): Mentioned by a large number of historians like: Ahmad ben Hanbal in
his Musnad part 4, page281. Al-Rázi in his interpretation, and
Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdádi in Táreekh Baghdád part 8, page 280, and Ibn Hijr
in his book Al-Sawá\`iq Al-Muhriqah page107.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
after the prophet (PUH) is Ali ben Abi Tálib.  
The king (to the vizier): is it true what was mentioned by \`Alawi?  
Vizier: so it was mentioned by interpreters and historians.  
The king: leave this topic and talk about something else.  
\`Abbási: shiites claim that Quran was edited (changed).  
\`Alawi: it is so famous among you - O sunnis - that you say that the
Quran was edited.  
\`Abbási: this is a lie.  
\`Alawi: didn't you say in your own books that some phrases about the
idols were revealed upon the prophet and then these phrases were erased
and canceled out of Quran?  
The king (to the vizier): is it true what \`Alawi is claiming?  
Vizier: yes, that is what was mentioned by historians.  
The king: then how come we depend on a Quran that was changed?  
\`Alawi: you should know O king that we don't say such a thing, but this
is the claim of sunnis, and thus Quran for us is dependable but

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 for sunnis it is undependable.  
\`Abbási: some reported speeches (from the prophet) were mentioned by
your own ulema and in your books.  
\`Alawi: first of all these speeches are few, secondly: they are fake
and were made up by the enemies of shiites to lower down the reputation
of shiites, and thirdly: the reporters of such speeches and their chains
are incorrect, and what is mentioned by some ulema is undependable, but
our great ulema that we depend on do not say such a thing and never
mention that God praised the idols and said (and forbid that He might
say such a thing): these are the great idols, from which forgiveness is
asked.  
The king: leave this topic and talk about something else.  
\`Alawi: also sunnis say about God what is not appropriate for him.  
\`Abbási: like what?  
\`Alawi: like they say: God is a body, and He, like the human being,
laughs and cries and He has a hand and a leg and an eye and a private
part and will get His leg into the hell in judgment's day, and He will
come down from heaven to the earth on a donkey!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Abbási: and what's wrong with that, and Quran says (And thy Lord shall
come, 89:22) and also says (On the day when it He uncovers a leg, 68:42)
\[the English translation of Quran does not mention the word "leg" but
original Quran says the word "leg"\] and also (The Hand of Allah is
above their hands 48:10), and the Sunna mentioned that God will put His
leg into hell!  
\`Alawi: what was mentioned in Sunna and Hadith is false for us and
bunch of lies, because Abu-Hurayrah and his likes lied about the prophet
(PUH) and even \`Umar banned Abu-Hurayrah from reporting Hadith and
restrained him.  
The king (to the vizier): is it true that \`Umar banned Abu-Hurayrah
from reporting Hadith?  
Vizier: yes he did as was mentioned by historians.  
The king: then how come we depend on the reported speeches of
Abu-Hurayrah.  
Vizier: because the ulema depended on his reported speeches.  
The king: then, ulema must know better than \`Umar because \`Umar banned
Abu-Hurayrah from reporting Hadith because he told the lies about the
prophet but the ulema take his fabricated hadith?!  
\`Abbási: suppose - O \`Alawi - that the speeches about God are not
true, but what do you do with the quranic phrases?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Alawi: Quran contains complete phrases and others that are similar and
it has the apparent and the hidden, so the apparent complete is worked
with, but the similar should be interpreted according to the basics of
the language and the figurative speech and antonomasia, otherwise the
meaning will not be acceptable by the mind and the law, so for example:
if you considered the phrase (And thy Lord shall come, 89:22) by its
apparent meaning then you came against the mind and the law, because
mind and law say that God is everywhere and there is no place that is
without God, and the apparent meaning of the phrase tells that God is a
body, and the body occupies a space and a place, and that means if God
is in heavens then He is not on earth and if He is on earth, then
heavens shall be out of Him, and this is not true neither by mind nor
the law.  
\`Abbási got confused by this rightful logic and was puzzled to answer
and then he said: I don't accept this talk, we should take the apparent
meaning of the phrases of Quran.  
\`Alawi: then what do you do with the similar phrases?? Then, you can't
take the apparent meaning of the whole Quran, otherwise your friend
sheikh Ahmad \`Uthmán  (and he was one of the sunni ulema and he was
blind) who is sitting beside you should be in hell?  
\`Abbási: why?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Alawi: because God says (Whoso is blind here will be blind in the
Hereafter, and yet further from the road, 17:72), and since sheikh Ahmad
is blind now in this life then he shall blind in the Hereafter and yet
further from the road, so do you accept that sheikh Ahmad?  
Sheikh Ahmad: no, no, what is meant by "blind" in this phrase is the one
who is astraying away from the path of truth.  
\`Alawi: then, it is proved that one cannot work with the apparent
meaning of the whole Quran.  
Here, the debate was fierce about the apparent meanings of the Quran,
and \`Alawi gave many clues to \`Abbási that made him speechless, until
the king said: leave this topic and move to another.  
\`Alawi: and one of your innovations -you sunnis- about God that you say
that God forces the slaves (humans) to make the sins and the taboo and
then judge them for it?  
\`Abbási: that is true, because God say (He whom Allah sendeth astray,
4:88 and others) and also (Allah hath sealed their hearts, 9:93).  
\`Alawi: about what you said that is it in Quran, the answer to that is:
Quran has many figurative language usages that must be explained,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 so the meaning of "astraying" is that God leaves the wicked person and
does not care about him until he goes astraying, and this is like when
we say (the government spoiled the people), and that means that the
government left the people and did not take care of them , this is
first. Secondly, didn't you hear God's saying (Allah, verily, enjoineth
not lewdness, 7:28) and also (Lo! We have shown him the way, whether he
be grateful or disbelieving, 76:3) also (And guide him to the parting of
the mountain ways, 90:10). Thirdly, it is not acceptable logically that
God orders people to do the sin and then punish for it, because this is
even far away from the habit of the normal people then how come it is
something for God the Exalted and the Just, Exalted He is and Sanctified
from what the disbelievers and the unjust say and High Exalted above
what they say.  
The king: no, no, is it impossible that God forces the human to do the
sin and then punish him, this is exactly the wrong, and God is Exalted
from being unjust and corrupt (Allah is no oppressor of (His) bondmen),
but I don't think that sunnis follow the argument of \`Abbási?  
Then he asked the vizier and said: do sunnis follow that?  
Vizier: yes, this is what is known among the sunnis!  
The king: how come they say what is against the logic?  
Vizier: they have interpretations and clues.  
The king: whatever interpretation and clue is that it is impossible

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
for me to see and accept except of what \`Alawi said about that God
never forces anyone to do the sin and then punishes for it!  
\`Alawi: then, sunnis also say that the prophet (PUH) was doubtful about
his prophecy.  
\`Abbási: this is an apparent lie.  
\`Alawi: don't you say in your own books that the prophet of God said
"every time that Gabriel does not come down for me, I think that he got
down on Ibn Al-Khattáb \[meaning \`Umar\]," and you should know that
there are many holy phrases that points out that God made a covenant
with the prophet Mohammed (PUH) for his prophecy?  
The king (to the vizier): is it true what \`Alawi is saying about this
hadith being in the books of sunnis?  
Vizier: yes, it is in some books<sup>(1)</sup>.  
The king: this is truly a disbelief.  
\`Alawi: and sunnis also say in their books that the prophet (PUH) used
to carry \`Á'ishah \[one of the prophet's wives\] on his shoulders to
watch the flute players and drum players, so is that suitable for the
situations and the level of the prophet of God?

(1): mentioned by Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed Al-Mu\`tazali in Sharh Al-Manhaj,
and others  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Abbási: this is not harmful.  
\`Alawi: do you do that and you are a normal person, do you carry your
wife upon your shoulders to watch the players?  
The king: he who was the least shyness and jealousy won't allow such a
thing, then how is it with the prophet with all his faith. Is it true
that such a thing is there in the books of sunnis?  
Vizier: yes, it is in some books!  
The king: how come we believe in a prophet that doubts about his
prophecy?  
\`Abbási: this hadith should be interpreted?  
\`Alawi: does this hadith require an interpretation? Do you know now O
king that sunnis believe in such innovations and lies?  
\`Abbási: what lies do you mean?  
\`Alawi: I've explained to you now that you say:  
1. God is like human who has a hand and a leg and moves and settles
down.  
2. Quran had been edited.  
3. The prophet does what even normal people never do like carrying
\`Á'ishah on his shoulders.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
4. The prophet was doubtful about his prophecy.  
5. Who came to the throne before Ali ben Abi Tálib, used force and the
sword to prove themselves and they are not legitimate (to be rulers).  
6. Your books tell hadith from Abu-Hurayrah and his likes of liars and
such lies.

The king: leave this topic and move to another.  
\`Alawi: and then, sunnis claim about the prophet (PUH) what is not
appropriate even for the normal man!  
\`Abbási: like what?  
\`Alawi: like claiming that the phrase (He frowned and turned away,
80:1) \[the holy phrases continue and talk about a blind man\] was
revealed about the prophet!  
\`Abbási: and what is wrong with that?  
\`Alawi: it is wrong because God said (And lo! thou art of a tremendous
nature, 68:4) \[and in my own translation the phrase would be more like:
thou art of great manners\] and also (We sent thee not save as a mercy
for the peoples, 21:107). Is it reasonable that the prophet who is
described by God to be of a tremendous nature (manners) and also a mercy
for the peoples, is it reasonable that he does such a inhumane thing
with the faithful blind man??  
The king: it is impossible that such a thing could be done by the
messenger of humanity

------------------------------------------------------------------------

and the prophet of mercy, then \`Alawi about whom these phrases were
revealed?  
\`Alawi: the correct hadiths that we have and are reported by the way of
the Household of the prophet, them who Quran was revealed in their
houses, all these hadiths say that it was revealed about \`Uthmán ben
\`Affán \[the third caliph\], and that was when Ibn Um Maktoom \[who was
a blind man\] met \`Uthmán and \`Uthmán turned back at him.  
Here, Sayed Jamál Al-Deen (and he is one of the shiite ulema and was in
the court) said: an incident happened with me about this phrase and that
was when a christian scholar said to me: our prophet Jesus is better
than your prophet Mohammed, so I said: why? He said: because your
prophet was ill mannered and frowned for the blind men and turns back at
them, while Jesus was good mannered and healed the blind and the leper.
I said: O christian, you should know that we shiites say this phrase was
revealed about \`Uthmán ben \`Affán and not about the prophet (PUH) and
our prophet was good mannered with beautiful manners, and God said about
him (And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature, 68:4) and also (We sent
thee not save as a mercy for the peoples, 21:107). The christian said: I
heard this talk I said to you from a preacher in a mosque in Baghdad!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Alawi: what is known among us is that some of the ill narrators and
those who have no conscious claimed that this story happened with the
prophet to clean the record of \`Uthmán ben \`Affán , so they lied about
the prophet just to make their caliphs and rulers like innocents!  
The king: leave this topic and talk about another.  
\`Abbási: shiites deny that the three caliphs were believers, and this
is not true, because if they were not then why did the prophet allow
them to marry his daughters?  
\`Alawi: shiites believe that these -three- were not believers in heart
and they got into Islam just by the tongue, and the great prophet (PUH)
used to accept the Islam of anyone who testifies the two \[meaning:
testify that God is one and Mohammed is a prophet\] even if he was a
hypocrite and he used to treat all like muslims, so the relation between
them and the prophet was in the way of this logic!  
\`Abbási: what is your clue that Abu-Bakr was not a faithful?  
\`Alawi: the apparent clues are a lot, and one of them is: he betrayed
the prophet many times like when he disobeyed the prophet and didn't
join the army of Usámah, and Quran foretold that he who disobeys the
prophet is not a believer, God says (But nay, by thy Lord, they will not
believe (in truth) until they make thee judge of what is in dispute
between them and find within themselves no dislike of that which thou
decidest, and submit with full submission, 4:65). So, Abu-Bakr disobeyed
the command of the prophet and went against it so he is included in this
holy phrase. Add to that, the prophet (PUH) damned him who lags behind
from the army of Usámah and we mentioned before that Abu-Bakr lagged
behind from the army of Usámah, so does the prophet damn a believer? Of
course: no.  
The king: so the argument of \`Alawi about him \[Abu-Bakr\] that he was
not a believer!  
Vizier: sunnis got interpretations about his lagging.  
The king: does interpretation push away what is prohibited? If we opened
this door then every criminal shall have the excuse for his crime. So
the thief shall say: I've stolen because I'm poor, and the drunk shall
say: I've drunk because I have so much troubles, and the adulterer say
this and that, and so the whole system will be shaken up and the people
will dare more to disobey, no... no... interpretations are not useful
for us.  
The face of \`Abbási turned red and was puzzled, what shall he say, and
finally he said hardly: and what is the clue that \`Umar was not a
believer?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Alawi: there are many clues, one of them is that he himself declared
that he is not faithful!  
\`Abbási: when?  
\`Alawi: when he said (I was not doubtful about the prophecy of Mohammed
like I was at the day of Hudaybiyyah) \[Hudaybiyyah, a place in Saudi
Arabia at which the prophet made a truce with the idolaters of Mecca\]
and his talk denotes that he was always doubtful about the prophecy of
our prophet, and his doubt at the day of Hudaybiyyah was even deeper, so
tell me -O \`Abbási- by God, he who is doubtful about the prophecy of
Mohammed (PUH) is considered a believer?  
\`Abbási went silent and looked down.  
The king (to the vizier): is \`Alawi right about what \`Umar said?  
Vizier: this is what was said by the narrators!  
The king: amazing... so amazing... I used to consider \`Umar one of
first muslims, and used to consider his faith to be a unique one and now
I see that his faith was mixed with doubt!  
\`Abbási: hold on O king and stay on your creed, and don't be tricked by
this lying \`Alawi.  
The king turned his face away from \`Abbási and said with anger: the
vizier

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Nizam Al-Mulk say that \`Alawi is true about his argument, and the talk
of \`Umar is mentioned in the books and this idiot -\`Abbási- say that
he is a liar, isn't that exactly what is meant by stubbornness?  
The court went under a deep silence, because the king was greatly
annoyed by what \`Abbási said... and \`Abbási looked down with the rest
of the sunni ulema... and the vizier went silent... and \`Alawi remained
looking up at the face of the king to see the result.  
They were hard moments for \`Abbási, and he wished that earth would
split and swallow him down, or the angel of death would come down and
take his soul out for the embarrassment and the critical situation, for
the falsehood of his creed showed up in front of the king and the vizier
and the rest of ulema and generals... but what shall he do? The king
brought him here to ask and answer and to know truth from the falsehood,
and for this, he gathered his power and looked up and said: and how do
you say O \`Alawi that \`Uthmán was not a believer at heart while the
prophet made him marry both his daughters Ruqayyah and Um-Kalthoom?
\[notice that recent studies point out that probably the prophet never
hard these daughters but they are merely made up names\].  
\`Alawi: the clues about his ill faith and it is enough to say that
muslims -including the companions- gathered and killed him, and you say

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
that the prophet said: my nation never gathers upon a wrong matter, so
do muslims -including the companions- gather to kill a believer? And
\`Á'ishah used to compare him with jews and ordered to kill him and
said: kill Na\`thal -a name of a jew man- because he is a disbeliever,
kill Na\`thal may God kill him<sup>(1)</sup>, damned he may be. Also,
\`Uthmán beat \`Abdullah ben Mas\`ood the great companion until he got
hernia and made him remain in bed until he died. Also, he deported
Abu-Ðar Al-Ghifári, that great companion that the prophet said about him
(no green cover made a shade for nor the desert carried someone that has
a truthful tongue more than Abu-Ðar), and he deported him away from
Medina to Shám \[Shám: lands of Syria and the surroundings\] for once or
twice and then to Al-Rabaðah, and it is a dry land between Mecca and
Medina - until Abu-Ðar died out of hunger and thirst - at the time that
\`Uthmán was spreading the treasury of muslims over his relatives of
umayyads and marwanids!

(1): Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed Al-Mu\`tazali said in Sharh Nahj Al-Balaghah part
2, page77: everyone who wrote history and made classifications about it
mentioned that \`Á'ishah was one of the fiercest people over \`Uthmán 
and she got one of the prophet's shirts and made a stand for it in her
house and used to say to whoever comes in: this is the shirt of the
prophet did not decay and \`Uthmán made his own clothes decay.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
The king (to the vizier): is \`Alawi true about what he said?  
Vizier: historians mentioned that!<sup>(1)</sup>  
The king: how come then muslims claimed him a caliph?  
Vizier: by voting.  
\`Alawi: wait O vizier, don't say what is untrue!  
The king: what are you saying O \`Alawi?  
\`Alawi: the vizier made a mistake in his talk, because \`Uthmán came to
the throne by the will of \`Umar and the votes of three hypocrites and
they are: Talhah, and Sa\`ad ben Abi Waqás and \`Abdul-Rahmán ben \`Awf,
so do these three resemble all muslims? And then, historians mention
that these who voted, changed their minds about \`Uthmán

(1): Historians mentioned that \`Uthmán gave \`Abdullah ben Khálid ben
Usayd 400,000 dirham, and Al-Hakam ben Al-\`Ás -who was deported by the
prophet- 100,000 dirham, and gave the land of Fadak to Marwán ben
Al-Hakam, and the land of Fadak was for Fatima \[the daughter of the
prophet\] but it was taken by force by Abu-Bakr and \`Umar, and then it
was given by \`Uthmán to Marwán - and also gave \`Abdullah ben Ubay the
fifth of Africa in the same day that he gave Marwán 100,000 dirham, and
all of that was out of the treasury of muslims. Get back to the details
in Sharh Nahj Al-Balaghah for Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed Al-Mu\`tazali part 1, to
find the details. (the publisher)  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
when they saw his tyranny and his disrespect for the companions of the
prophet (PUH) and how he asked for advice about the matters of muslims
from Ka\`b Al-Ahbár the jew \[the great rabbi\] and how he spread the
treasury of muslims among the marwanids, so these three started to stir
up people to kill \`Uthmán!  
The king (to the vizier): is it true what \`Alawi just said?  
Vizier: yes, this is what historians mentioned!  
The king: then how come you said he ruled by voting?  
Vizier: I meant the votes of these three!  
The king: and is choosing three men makes the voting correct?  
Vizier: these three were testified to be in paradise by the prophet
(PUH)!  
\`Alawi: wait O vizier, don't say what is untrue, the hadith of the (10
people in paradise) is just a lie about the prophet (PUH)!  
\`Abbási: how come you say it is a lie and assured narrators mentioned
this?  
\`Alawi: there are lot of clues that tell this hadith is a lie  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
and not true, and I shall mention three of them:  
First: how come the prophet testifies that someone is in paradise for
someone who hurt him and that is Talhah? Some historians and
interpreters mentioned that Talhah said: if Mohammed died we shall marry
his wives after him -or- I shall marry \`Á'ishah, so the prophet was
hurt a lot by the talk of Talhah and God revealed the phrase (And it is
not for you to cause annoyance to the messenger of Allah, nor that ye
should ever marry his wives after him. Lo! that in Allah's sight would
be an enormity, 33:53).  
Second: Talhah and Al-Zubayr fought against imam Ali ben Abi Tálib (PUH)
and the prophet (PUH) said about Ali (O Ali, your war is my war and your
peace is my peace)<sup>(1)</sup>, and also said (he who obeyed Ali had
obeyed me and he who disobeyed Ali had disobeyed me)<sup>(2)</sup>, and
also said (Ali is with the Quran and the Quran is with Ali never
separated until they come back to me at the Fountain) \[the Fountain, a
place at the time of the judgment day when the prophet of Muhammad is
believed to wait for his followers\]<sup>(3)</sup>, and also said (Ali
is with the truth and the truth is with Ali ...

(1): mentioned by Al-Khateeb Al-Khawárizmi in the book of Al-Manáqib
page76, and mentioned by Ibn Hasnaweh and mentioned by Al-Qandoozi in
his book Yanabee\` Al-Mawaddah page130, and lot of other great ulema of
sunnis.  
(2): Kanz Al-\`Ummál Hadith \#1213, and others.  
(3): Kanz Al-\`Ummál Hadith \# 1152, and Al-Sawá\`iq page75 and
Mustadrak Al-Hákim page124.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
and it revolves with him wherever he goes)<sup>(1)</sup>, so, is the one
who fights against the prophet and disobeyed him shall be in paradise?
Is the fighter against the truth and Quran is considered a believer?  
Third: Talhah and Zubayr prepared the way to kill \`Uthmán, so is it
possible that \`Uthmán and Talhah and Zubayr are all in paradise and
they fought against each other, and the prophet (PUH) said (the killer
and the killed are all in hell)??

The king (surprised): is all what \`Alawi said true?  
and here the vizier went silent and didn't say a thing, and \`Abbási
went silent and didn't say a thing. What shall they say? Would they say
the truth? Does Satan allow them to admit the truth? Does the soul who
orders with badness allow itself to be under the truth? Do you think
admitting the truth is an easy task?  
No... it is a hard thing, because it requires neglecting racism

(1): Táreekh Baghdád part 14, page321, and Al-Háfidh Al-Haythami in
Majma\` Al-Zawá'id part 7, page236, and Ibn Qutaybah in Al-Imámah

Jámi\` Al-Tarmaði part 2, page213 and others. (publisher)  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
of the ignorance age and going against the will of the soul, and the
people usually go after the soul and the falsehood except of the
faithful and how few are they!  
... \`Alawi torn out the curtain of silence and said: O king, the vizier
and \`Abbási and all of these ulema know the truth in my speech and talk
and how true is my argument, and if they denied this, then in Baghdad
there are ulema that testify for my argument to be true, and in the
stores of this school there are books that testify that my argument is
true, and resources that announce apparently how truthful is my argument
is... so if they admitted that my argument is true, then this is what is
required, otherwise I'm ready now to bring you the books and the
resources and the witnesses!  
The king (to the vizier): is the talk of \`Alawi about the truthfulness
of his argument in books and resources true?  
Vizier: yes.  
The king: why were you silent in the beginning then?  
Vizier: because I hate to stab in the reputation of the companions of
the prophet (PUH)!  
\`Alawi: amazing! you hate that and God with His prophet (PUH) did not
hate that when God identified some of the companions as "hypocrites"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

and He ordered His prophet to fight them like he fights against the
disbelievers, and the prophet himself damned some of his companions!  
Vizier: didn't you hear O \`Alawi that ulema said: all the prophet's
companions are equal?  
\`Alawi: I heard that, and I know it is a lie, because how come all of
them are equal and God damned some of them and the prophet damned some
of them and some of them damned each other and fought against each other
and some of them cursed each other and some of them killed each other?  
Here, \`Abbási found the door closed in his face, so he came through
some other door and said: O king, ask this \`Alawi, if the caliphs were
not believers then how come muslims chose them to be so and followed
them?  
\`Alawi: first, not all muslims followed them and only sunnis did so.
Second, those who believed in their ruling are divided into two: an
ignorant and a stubborn, as for the ignorant one he does not know their
realities but imagine them as good kind and faithful people, and as for
the stubborn one, clues and proves are not useful with him as long he
insisted on being stubborn and arguing

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
God said (Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not, it is alike for
them, for they believe not, 36:10)!  
Third: those who chose these to be caliphs made a mistake like how
christians made a mistake when they said (the Messiah is the son of God)
and like how jews made a mistake when they said (\`Uzair \[Ezra\] is the
son of God), so the human should obey God and the prophet and follow the
truth, not follow the people with their falsehood and wrong, and God
says (Obey Allah and obey the messenger, 5:92).  
The king: leave this topic and talk about something else.  
\`Alawi: and one of the mistakes of the sunnis and their innovations
that they didn't follow Ali ben Abi Tálib (PUH) and followed others.  
\`Abbási: and why is that?  
\`Alawi: because Ali ben Abi Tálib (PUH) was appointed by the prophet
(PUH) and the other three were not; and he (\`Alawi) continued: O king,
if you appointed someone to succeed you, should the ministers and the
members of the government follow you? or they have the right to isolate
your successor and place someone else in his place?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
The king: no but they should follow my successor who was appointed by
me, and follow him and obey my command about him.  
\`Alawi: this is what shiites did, they followed the successor of the
prophet (PUH) who was appointed by the prophet (PUH) by a command from
God the Exalted, and that is Ali ben Abi Tálib, and they (shiites) left
others.  
\`Abbási: but Ali ben Abi Tálib was not appropriate to be a caliph,
because he was young while Abu-Bakr was older, and Ali ben Abi Tálib
killed the bravest arabs, so arabs wouldn't accept him, while Abu-Bakr
was not like that!  
\`Alawi: did you hear O king? \`Abbási is saying that people know more
than God and His prophet in appointing the best, because he doesn't
follow what was appointed by God and His prophet (PUH) about Ali ben Abi
Tálib, but follows what some people say about Abu-Bakr. Like if God does
not know what is best, until some ignorant people come and choose the
best? Did not God say (And it becometh not a believing man or a
believing woman, when Allah and His messenger have decided an affair
(for them), that they should (after that) claim any say in their affair;
and whoso is rebellious to Allah and His messenger, he verily goeth
astray in error manifest, 33:36)?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Did not God say (O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and the messenger when He
calleth you to that which quickeneth you, 8:24)?  
\`Abbási: no I didn't say that people know better than God and His
prophet (PUH).  
\`Alawi: then your argument has no meaning, if God and the prophet
appointed one person for the caliphate and to be an imam, so you should
follow it, either you are satisfied with it or not!  
\`Abbási: but the qualifications in Ali ben Abi Tálib were few.  
\`Alawi: first, the meaning of your argument is that God did not know
who is Ali ben Abi Tálib exactly, so he didn't know that his
qualifications were few and for this He appointed him as a caliph and
this is obvious disbelief. Secondly, in reality, the qualifications to
be a caliph and an imam were abundant in Ali ben Abi Tálib, while others
did not have such qualifications!  
\`Abbási: and what are these qualifications -for example-?  
\`Alawi: his qualifications are so much, and first of all is that he was
appointed by God and His prophet (PUH). Secondly, he was the most wise
of all the companions, and thus the prophet...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
said (Ali is the most just) and \`Umar ben Al-Khattáb said (Ali is the
most just among us)<sup>(1)</sup>, and the prophet said (I am the city
of knowledge and Ali is its gate, whoever wanted the city shall enter
from its gate)<sup>(2)</sup>, and he himself (PUH) said (the prophet
taught me one thousand sections of knowledge, from each section I get
one thousand sections opened)<sup>(3)</sup>, and obviously the wise one
is advanced over the ignorant, and God says (Are those who know equal
with those who know not?, 9:39). Thirdly, he was not in need of others,
and others were in need of him, did not Abu-Bakr say (spare me for I'm
not the best of you and Ali is the best within you)? Did not \`Umar say
in more than 70 occasions (if it wasn't for Ali,...

(1): Saheeh Al-Bukhári about the interpretation of God's saying (Nothing
of our revelation (even a single verse) do we abrogate or cause be
forgotten... 2:106), and Tabaqát Ibn Sa\`d part 6, page102, and

part 1, page65, and lot of others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 \`Umar surely was doomed)<sup>(1)</sup> and (may God never leave me for
a problem that you are not in it O Abul-Hasan \[meaning imam
Ali\])<sup>(2)</sup> and also (no one shall judge in the mosque while
Ali is present)? Fourthly, Ali ben Abi Tálib never disobeyed God and
never worshipped something else other than God, and never prostrated for
an idol in his life, and these three disobeyed God and worshipped
someone other than God and worshipped idols and God said (My covenant
includeth not wrong-doers, 2:124), and obviously, he who disobeys (God)
is a wrong-doer, so he is not qualified to take the covenant of God,
that is, the prophecy or being caliph. Fifthly: Ali ben Abi Tálib was
one of right mind and an open mind and a right opinion that originated
from Islam, while others had opinions originating from Satan, and so
Abu-Bakr said (I have a satan that wears me) and \`Umar disobeyed the
prophet in many occasions, and \`Uthmán was of weak opinion and affected
by his bad companions like: Al-Wazagh ben

\(1\) Al-Hákim fi Al-Mustadrak, Kitáb Al-Salát part 1, page358,

(2): Taðkirat Al-Sibt page87, Manáqib Al-Khawárizmi page60, and

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Al-Wazagh \[wazagh: an arabic name for some type of lizards\] who was
damned by the prophet and he damned his descendants - except of the
believers and how few are they - (Marwán ben Al-Hakam) and also Ka\`b
Al-Ahbár the jew and others.  
The king: is it true that Abu-Bakr said (I have a satan that wears
me)?  
Vizier: this is found in the books of history! <sup>(1)</sup>  
The king: and is it true that \`Umar disobeyed the prophet?  
Vizier: we shall ask \`Alawi what he means by this?  
\`Alawi: yes, sunni ulema mentioned in assured books that \`Umar
disobeyed the prophet in many occasions, like:  
1. when the prophet wanted to pray upon \`Abdullah ben Ubay, when \`Umar
replied back the prophet with a harsh answer and the prophet was hurt
from that and God says (Those who vex the messenger of Allah, for them
there is a painful doom, 9:61).

Jurayr  part 2 page 440, and Al-Imámah Wal-Siyásah for Ibn Qutaybah
page6, and others. (the publisher)  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
2. when the prophet (PUH) ordered to separate \`Umrat Al-Tamattu\` and
Hajj Al-Tamattu\` \[two duties of pilgrimage\] and he (PUH) allowed that
a man can reach his wife between the both duties, then \`Umar refused
that and said this hideous sentence (shall we prepare for pilgrimage and
our organs are still dropping the semen?) and the prophet answered him:
you never believed in it, and by that sentence the prophet (PUH) made
him know himself that he is one of those who believe in some and neglect
some.  
3. about the Mut\`ah marriage \[Mut\`ah marriage is a type of temporal
marriage\] when he did not believe in it, and when he came to the throne
by force he said (2 Mut\`as that were at the time of the prophet and now
I ban them and punish for them) while God says (And those of whom ye
seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a
duty, 4:24) \[the English translation doesn't bring the real meaning as
in the original Arabic text where the action of Mut\`ah is obvious\],
and interpreters said that it was revealed about allowing Mut\`ah
marriage, and muslims used to do that until the days of \`Umar, and when
\`Umar banned it, adultery increased among muslims<sup>(1)</sup>, and by
doing this \`Umar stopped working with one law of God and His prophet
(PUH) and made the way open for adultery! and got himself included in
the phrases (Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such
are disbelievers...wrong-doers...evil-livers, 5:44,45,47).

(1): as reported from imam Ali ben Abi Tálib (PUH) that he said: if it
was not for \`Umar banning Mut\`ah, then no one would commit adultery
except of the unblest.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
4. in the occasion of Hudaybiyyah as mentioned before.  
and in some other occasions where \`Umar used to refuse the commands of
the prophet and hurt him with his harsh words.  
The king: truly, I don't also accept the idea of Mut\`ah (of women)!  
\`Alawi: do you admit that it is an islamic law or not?  
The king: I don't.  
\`Alawi: then what's the meaning of the phrase (And those of whom ye
seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a
duty, 4:24)? and what is the meaning of \`Umar's saying (2
Mut\`as..etc)? Does not the saying of \`Umar point out that the marriage
of Mut\`ah was allowed during the time of the prophet, and even at the
days of Abu-Bakr, and part of the time of \`Umar and then he banned it?
Adding to that other clues and they are a lot, O king, \`Umar himself
used to marriage in Mut\`ah and \`Abdullah ben Al-Zubayr was born from
Mut\`ah!  
The king: what do you say O vizier?  
Vizier: the clue of \`Alawi is correct, but since \`Umar banned it, we
should follow him.  
\`Alawi: is God and the prophet are better to be followed or \`Umar?
Hadn't you read, O vizier, God's saying (And whatsoever the messenger
giveth you, take it 59:7) and (and obey the messenger, 5:92, and many
others), and also (Verily in the messenger of Allah ye have a good
example, 33:21) and also the famous hadith (the allowed thing of
Mohammed is allowed until the judgment day and the taboo of Mohammed is
taboo until the judgment day)?  
The king: I believe in all of the laws of Islam, but I don't understand
why Mut\`ah is allowed, for does any of you desires to give his daughter
or his sister to a man, to enjoy with her for one hour, isn't that
hideous?  
\`Alawi: and what do you say about that O king: does someone want to
give his daughter or his sister for normal marriage for a man, while he
knows that she will be divorced after one hour?  
The king: I don't want that.  
\`Alawi: although sunnis believe that such normal marriage is correct,
and the divorce in that case is correct too, and the difference between
Mut\`ah and normal marriage is that Mut\`ah is over when its assigned
time is up and the normal marriage is over by divorce, and in other
words: Mut\`ah marriage is like a contract of renting, and normal
marriage is like a contract of ownership, when renting is over by the
end of the assigned time and the ownership could be over by selling -for
example-! Then, allowing Mut\`ah is correct because it is for satisfying
one of the needs of the body.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Like how the normal marriage which ends by divorce is correct because it
is a way to satisfy one of the needs of the body. Then I shall ask you O
king, what do you say about those widows who lost their husbands and
none came to marry them, isn't Mut\`ah is the only solution for them to
protect them from adultery and mischief? Isn't it by Mut\`ah that they
can get some money for themselves and to take care of their orphans? And
what do you say about the young people and the men that their
circumstances doesn't allow them to get married, isn't Mut\`ah is the
only solution for them to get rid of the tremendous sexual force?! And
to protect them against mischief? Isn't Mut\`ah better than adultery,
and sodomy and the secret habit \[masturbation\]? I think - O king -
that every crime of adultery or sodomy or a masturbation that happens
between people is because of \`Umar, and he shares its badness, because
he is the one who banned it! And there are many news that tells how
adultery increased among people since \`Umar banned Mut\`ah!  
and your saying - O king - that you don't want to ...etc, well, Islam
did not force anyone to do so, and did not force you to let your
daughter get married for someone that you know he will divorce her after
one hour of marriage, beside that, your desire and the desire of people
of not wanting this, that is not a base for making something a taboo,
because the law of God is fixed and does not change by opinions and
desires!  
The king (to the vizier): the clue of \`Alawi about Mut\`ah is strong!  
Vizier: but the ulema followed \`Umar.  
\`Alawi: first, the ulema who followed \`Umar are the sunni ones only
and not all of them, second, the law of God and His prophet is the one
to follow or \`Umar's? Third, your ulema went against the law of \`Umar
by themselves.  
Vizier: how?  
\`Alawi: because \`Umar said (2 Mut\`as that were at the time of the
prophet and I ban them: Hajj Al-Tamattu\` and Mut\`ah marriage), so if
the argument of \`Umar was right then why didn't your ulema follow his
argument in Hajj Al-Tamattu\`? While your ulema went against \`Umar and
said that Hajj Al-Tamattu\` is correct, although \`Umar banned it! And
if the argument of \`Umar is false then why did your ulema follow his
argument about Mut\`ah marriage?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
The vizier went silent.  
The king (to the attendance): why don't you answer \`Alawi?  
Then said one of the shiites ulema and his name was sheikh Hasan Qásimi:
the problem of \`Umar and them who followed him is obvious, thus, these
people - O king - have no answer for \`Alawi, may God save him.  
The king: then leave this topic and talk about something else.  
\`Abbási: these shiites claim that \`Umar has no virtue, and it is
enough for him that he made all of these invasions for the islamic
state.  
\`Alawi: we have answers for that:  
first: rulers and kings invade the land to expand their territories, so
is this a virtue?  
second: if we believed that his invasions were a virtue, but do these
invasions excuse him for taking the caliphate by force? And the
situation is that the prophet (PUH) did not assign him to be a caliph
but gave that position to Ali ben Abi Tálib (PUH)... for if you - O king
- assigned a successor for yourself, and then someone came and took that
place instead of your assigned successor, and then he

------------------------------------------------------------------------

made the invasions and did the good deeds, would be satisfied with his
invasions or shall you be angry at him, because he took the place of
your own successor and isolated your successor without your
permission?  
The king: I shall be angry at him and his invasions do not wash his
crime!  
\`Alawi: and so did \`Umar, he took the place of the caliphate and sat
in the place of the prophet without the prophet's permission!  
third: the invasions of \`Umar were wrong and it had a negative effect,
because the prophet (PUH) never attacked anyone, but his wars were for
defence only, and that's why people liked Islam and got into the
religion of God in large numbers because they knew that Islam is a
religion of peace, but as for \`Umar he attacked the lands and got them
into Islam by force and the sword, and for this people hated Islam and
claimed that it is the religion of the sword and the force, and not the
religion of logic and easiness and that was the cause for the many
enemies of Islam, so: the invasions of \`Umar corrupted the reputation
of Islam and gave a negative reversed effect. And if Abu-Bakr and \`Umar
and \`Uthmán did not take the caliphate for themselves from the true
imam, imam Ali (PUH), and if the imam was

------------------------------------------------------------------------

taking care of the caliphate directly after the prophet, then he would
be walking on the steps of the prophet and apply his right methods, and
that would be a source for getting more people into Islam, and the
expansion of Islam would reach the whole earth! But, there is no might
save but by Allah.  
Here, \`Alawi took a deep breath and moaned from the depth of his heart
and hit one hand over the other for his sorrow about Islam and what
happened to it after the death of the prophet (PUH) because of taking
the caliphate from its rightful owner: imam Ali (PUH).  
The king (to \`Abbási): what is your answer to \`Alawi's talk?  
\`Abbási: I've never heard such a thing before!  
\`Alawi: now since you've heard it and knew the truth, leave your
caliphs and follow the rightful caliph for the prophet (PUH) Ali ben Abi
Tálib (PUH). Then he continued: amazing is your logic O sunnis, you
forget the origin and take the branch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Abbási: how is that?  
\`Alawi: because you mention the invasions of \`Umar and forget the
invasions of Ali (PUH)!  
\`Abbási: and what are the invasions of Ali ben Abi Tálib?  
\`Alawi: most of the invasions of the prophet were done by the hand of
Ali ben Abi Tálib like Badr and Khaybar and Hunayn and Uhud and
Al-Khandaq and others... and if it was not for these invasions (battles)
that formed the base for Islam, there wouldn't be \`Umar, nor Islam nor
a faith, and the clue to that is when the prophet (PUH) said -when Ali
went to fight \`Amr ben \`Abd-Wid at the battle of Khandaq- (all the
faith went to all of the disbelief, my Lord, if You want not to be
worshipped then it shall be), meaning that if Ali was killed then the
disbelievers shall dare to kill me and kill all the muslims, and thus
there shall be no faith and no Islam. Also he (PUH) said (the strike of
Ali at the day of Khandaq is better than the worshipping of the two
created \[meaning human, and djinn\])<sup>(1)</sup>, so it is rightful
to say that Islam is Mohammedan in existence...

(1): Al-Fakhr Al-Rázi in Niháyat Al-\`Uqool page104, Mustadrak Al-Hákim
part 3, page32, Táreekh Baghdád part 3, page19, Al-Ðahabi in Talkhees
Al-Mustadrak part 3, page32, Arjah Al-Matálib page481.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
and Alawite in lasting, and thanks be to God and to Ali for the lasting
of Islam!  
\`Abbási: let's suppose that your talk about \`Umar and that he did
change and take the caliphate by force is true, but why do you hate
Abu-Bakr?  
\`Alawi: we hate him for many reasons and I shall mention two:  
first: for what he did to Fatima the daughter of the prophet (PUH)  
second: for not applying the law over the criminal and adulterer: Khalid
ben Al-Waleed.  
The king (surprised): and is Khalid ben Al-Waleed a criminal?  
\`Alawi: yes.  
The king: and what is his crime?  
\`Alawi: his crime is: Abu-Bakr sent him to the great companion Málik
ben Nuwayrah -the one who the prophet (PUH) told him that he shall be in
paradise- and he (Abu-Bakr) ordered hi (Khalid) to kill Málik and his
people, and Málik was out of Medina, so when he saw Khalid coming to him
with a small army, Málik commanded his people to carry the weapons,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
and so they did, and when Khalid reached them he tricked them and lied
and swore to them by God that he is not going to harm them, and said to
them: we are not here to fight you but we are guests for tonight, and so
Málik got relaxed -because Khalid swore- and he put down the weapons
with his people, and when it was the time to pray and Málik with his
people stood up to pray they were attacked by Khalid and his army and
got them tied and then killed them all, and then Khalid got greedy for
the wife of Málik (when he saw that she's beautiful) and he raped her in
the same night in which he killed her husband, and he made the head of
her husband and his people as stones for the kettle to cook the food of
his crime and ate with his army! and when Khalid got back to Medina,
\`Umar wanted to apply the law against him for killing muslims and for
raping the wife of Málik, but Abu-Bakr (the believer!) denied that
extremely, and by his deed he let go of the blood of the muslims and
stopped a law of God!  
The king (to the vizier): is it true what \`Alawi said about Khalid and
Abu-Bakr?  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Vizier: yes this is what historians said!<sup>(1)</sup>  
The king: then why some people call Khalid as "the raised sword of God"
?  
\`Alawi: it is the paralyzed sword of the devil, but since he was an
enemy for Ali ben Abi Tálib and was with \`Umar in burning the door of
the house of Fatima, some sunnis called him the sword of God!  
The king: and are sunnis enemies for Ali ben Abi Tálib?  
\`Alawi: if they are not then why did they praise the one who took the
caliphate by force from him and gathered around his enemies and denied
his virtues, to the limit that they claim that Abu-Tálib \[the father of
Imam Ali\] died as a disbeliever, while the truth is that Abu-Tálib was
a believer and he pushed Islam further in the darkest days and protected
the prophet in his calling \[to Islam\]!  
The king: did Abu-Tálib turn into Islam?  
\`Alawi: Abu-Tálib was not a disbeliever to become a muslim, but he
was...

(1): of them: Abu Al-Fidá' in his history part 1, page158, and Al-Tabari
in his history part 3, page241, and Ibn Al-Atheer in his history part 3,
page149, and Ibn \`Asákir in his history part 5, page105, and Ibn
Katheer part 6, page321, and others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
a faithful man that was hiding his faith, and when the prophet (PUH) was
sent, Abu-Tálib showed his Islam and became the third muslim: the first
was Ali ben Abi Tálib, the second was lady Khadeejah the wife of the
prophet, and the third was Abu Tálib (PUH).  
The king (to the vizier): is it true what \`Alawi is saying about
Abu-Tálib?  
Vizier: yes, some historians mentioned that<sup>(1)</sup>.  
The king: then why it is famous among sunnis that Abu-Tálib died as a
disbeliever?  
\`Alawi: because Abu-Tálib is the father of imam Ali, the prince of the
believers, so the envy of sunnis for Ali ben Abi Tálib (PUH) made them
say that his father died as a disbeliever, as well as their envy also
made them kill his two sons (Ali's) Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, the masters
of youth of paradise, so much that even sunnis that attended Karbala to
kill Al-Husayn said:

(1): Al-Hákim fil-Mustadrak part 2, page623, Sharh Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed
part 3, page313, and Táreekh Ibn Katheer part 3, page87, and Sharh
Al-Bukhári for Al-Qastalani part 2, page227, and Al-Seerah Al-Halabiyyah
part 1, page125, and lot of others. (the publisher)  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
we fight you for our hate to your father and for what he did to our
ancestors in the day of Badr and Hunayn!  
The king (to the vizier): did the killers of Al-Husayn say this to
Al-Husayn?  
Vizier: historians mentioned that they said that to Al-Husayn!  
The king (to \`Abbási): and what is your answer about the story of
Khalid ben Al-Waleed?  
\`Abbási: Abu-Bakr sought the (general) benefit from that!  
\`Alawi (surprised): sanctified is God! and what is that benefit that
allows Khalid to kill the innocents and rape their women and then remain
without a punishment, and even get the leadership of the army, and
Abu-Bakr says about him: he is a sword that God raised, so does the
sword of God kills the disbelievers or the believers? and does the sword
of God save the honor of muslims or rape the women of muslims??  
\`Abbási: suppose - O \`Alawi - that Abu-Bakr made a mistake, but \`Umar
saved the situation!  
\`Alawi: saving the situation is by scourging Khalid for raping, and
killing him for killing innocent believers, and \`Umar did not do that,
so \`Umar made a mistake like Abu-Bakr did before.  
The king: you \`Alawi said in the beginning that Abu-Bakr...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
hurt Fatima the daughter of the prophet (PUH) so what did he do?  
\`Alawi: when Abu-Bakr made himself a ruler by force and terror, he sent
\`Umar and Qunfuð and Khalid ben Al-Waleed and Abu-\`Ubaydah Al-Jarráh
and some others - from the hypocrites - to the house of Fatima and Ali
(PUT) and \`Umar gathered the wood on the door of Fatima (that door that
many times the prophet stood in front of it and said: Peace upon you O
Household of prophecy, and didn't get inside unless he asked for
permission) and he burnt the door with fire, and when Fatima came behind
the door to stop \`Umar from doing this with his followers, he squeezed
her between the wall and the door so hard that she had abortion and a
nail from the door planted in her chest and Fatima screamed: O father, O
messenger of God, look what happened to us after you from Ibn Al-Khattáb
\[meaning \`Umar\] and Ibn Abi-Quháfah \[meaning Abu-Bakr\]! \`Umar then
looked around him and said: beat Fatima, so the lashes came down on the
beloved of the prophet (PUH) until the blood gushed out from her body!
And the effects of this squeeze and this shock remained drilling in the
body of Fatima, and she became sick and sad until she left this life
after her father within some days - thus, Fatima is the martyr of the
Household of the prophecy, and Fatima was killed...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
because of \`Umar ben Al-Khattáb!  
The king (to the vizier): is what \`Alawi saying true?  
Vizier: yes, I saw in some history books what the \`Alawi is talking
about!<sup>(1)</sup>  
\`Alawi: and that's why shiites hate Abu-Bakr and \`Umar!  
\`Alawi added: and the clue that this crime did happen by the hands of
Abu-Bakr and \`Umar, is that historians mentioned that Fatima died and
she was angry at Abu-Bakr and \`Umar and the prophet (PUH) mentioned in
many occasions the hadith (God is satisfied for the satisfaction of
Fatima and angry for her anger) and you O king know exactly what happens
to someone that gets the wrath of God!?  
The king (to he vizier): is that hadith true? and is it true that Fatima
died and she was angry at Abu-Bakr and \`Umar?

\(1\) Kitáb Al-Saqeefah for Abu-Bakr Al-Jawhari and Al-Imámah
wal-Siyásah for Ibn Qutaybah, and Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed in Sharh Nahj
Al-Balaghah part 2, page19. (the publisher)  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Vizier: yes, that was mentioned by scholars of Hadith and history!(1)  
\`Alawi: and the clue for my argument: is that Fatima told Ali ben Abi
Tálib (PUH) to not let Abu-Bakr and \`Umar and the rest of those who
wronged her attend her funeral, so they don't pray upon her, and never
attend her burial, and to hide her tomb so that they don't attend to her
grave, and imam Ali (PUH) did exactly what she asked for!  
The king: this is weird, was such a thing done by Ali and Fatima?  
Vizier: so was mentioned by historians!  
\`Alawi: also, Abu-bakr and \`Umar hurt Fatima in another way!  
\`Abbási: and what is that?  
\`Alawi: they took the land of Fadak by force.  
\`Abbási: what is the clue that they took it by force?

\(1\) Saheeh Al-Bukhári, kitáb Al-Khums, hadith \#2. In it also in the
section of Khaybar invasion and in Kitáb Al-Fará'idh, and Saheeh
Al-Tirmiði part 1, section of what is left of the inheritance of the
prophet of God. Mustadrak Al-Saheehayn part 3, page153. Meezán
Al-I\`tidál part 2, page72. Kanz Al-\`Ummál part 6, page219, and others.
(the publisher)  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Alawi: the books of history mentioned that the prophet of God (PUH)
gave Fadak to Fatima(1) so Fadak was in her hand -at the days of the
prophet- and when the prophet died, Abu-Bakr and \`Umar sent people to
deport the workers of Fatima from Fadak by the sword and the force, and
Fatima protested against Abu-Bakr and \`Umar but they didn't listen to
her, and even restrained her, and for this she never talked to them
until she died with anger on them!  
\`Abbási: but \`Umar ben \`Abdul \`Aziz \[an umayyad ruler, almost ruled
from 717AD-720AD\] turned Fadak back to the children of Fatima -during
his reign-?  
\`Alawi: and what is the use of that? If someone took your home by force
and made you astray and then another man came after you die and gave
back the home to your children, does that clear out the sin of the first
aggressor?  
The king: it is apparent from your speech you two - \`Abbási and \`Alawi
- that you agree that Abu-Bakr and \`Umar took by force the land of
Fadak?

(1): Fadak is a name for a land between Medina and Khaybar and it was
owned by the prophet and he gave it to his daughter Fatima (PUH).  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Abbási: yes, history mentioned that<sup>(1)</sup>.  
The king: and why did they do so?  
\`Alawi: because they wanted to take the caliphate by force, and they
knew that Fadak if it was to remain in the hands of Fatima then its
production will be distributed (120,000 golden dinars as mentioned by
some historians) among the people, and in that way people will gather
around Ali (PUH), and this is what Abu-Bakr and \`Umar hate!  
The king: if these sayings are true then how strange is the situation of
those! And if the leadership of these three was false, then who is the
successor of the prophet (PUH)?  
\`Alawi: the prophet himself -and by a command from God- assigned the
successors after him, in the hadith that is mentioned in the books of
hadith when he said (my successors after me are twelve, as much as the
tribes of the Israelites and all of them from Quraysh) \[Quraysh: the
name of the tribe of the prophet (PUH)\].  
The king (to the vizier): is it true that the prophet said that?

(1): Al-Haythami in his book part 9, page39. Al-Imámah wal-Siyásah and
Sharh Nahj Al-Balaghah for Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed and others. (the
publisher)  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Vizier: yes.  
The king: then who are these twelve?  
\`Abbási: four of them are known and they are: Abu-Bakr, \`Umar,
\`Uthmán and Ali.  
The king: and the rest?  
\`Abbási: there is a debate between the ulema.  
The king: tell me their names.  
\`Abbási went silent.  
\`Alawi: O king, I shall mention their names for you as it was told in
the books of sunnis, and they are: Ali, Al-Hasan, Al-Husayn, Ali,
Muhammad, Ja\`far (Jafar), Musa, Ali, Muhammad, Ali, Al-Hasan, Al-Mahdi
(PUT)<sup>(1)</sup>.

(1): 20 hadith from the prophet (PUH) were mentioned with the names of
the twelve successors, by the way of sunni books, some of them: Fawá'id
Al-Simtayn part 4. Taðkirat Ibn Al-Jawzi page378, Yanabee\` Al-Mawaddah
page442, Al-Arba\`een for Al-Háfidh Abu Muhammad ben Abi Al-Fawáris,
Maqtal Al-Husayn for Abi Al-Mu'ayyad, Minháj Al-Fadhileen page239, Durar
Al-Simtayn, and others. (the publisher)  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Abbási: listen O king: shiites say that Al-Mahdi is alive since 255AH,
and is that possible \[this story happened in 485AH\]? And they say: he
will re-appear at the end of time to fill earth with justice after it
had been full of unjust.  
The king (to \`Alawi): is it true you believe in that?  
\`Alawi: yes that is true, because the prophet said that and it is
mentioned by narrators of both shiites and sunnis.  
The king: and how is it possible for a man to stay alive all that long
time?  
\`Alawi: for now, not a thousand year did pass even from the age of
Al-Mahdi \[of course according to that time\], and God says in Quran
about the prophet Noah (and he continued with them for a thousand years
save fifty years, 29:14), so is God unable to make someone live that
long? Isn't God responsible for death and life and He is the Able over
everything?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
then the prophet said that and he is true and believed in.  
The king (to the vizier): is it true that the prophet foretold about
Al-Mahdi like \`Alawi said?  
Vizier: yes(1).  
The king (to \`Abbási): then why do you deny the facts that was
mentioned by us sunnis?  
\`Abbási: because I'm afraid over the creed of the public to be shaken
up and their hearts might incline towards the shiites!  
\`Alawi: then you \`Abbási are an example for God's saying (Lo! Those
who hide the proofs and the guidance which We revealed, after We had
made it clear to mankind in the Scripture: such are accursed of Allah
and accursed of those who have the power to curse, 2:159) so you are
included in the curse of God.  
then \`Alawi said: O king, ask this \`Abbási: should the scholar...

(1): many sources for that, like: Al-Maláhim Wal-Fitan, section 19.
\`Aqd Al-Durar, hadith \#26. Yanabee\` Al-Mawaddah page491. Taðkirat

Ðakhá'ir Al-\`Uqbá for Al-Sháfi\`i.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
keep the save the book of God and the sayings of the prophet of God, or
should he save the creed of the public that is astraying from the book
and sunna?  
\`Abbási: I save the creed of the public so that they don't incline
toward the shiites because shiites are people of innovation!  
\`Alawi: the respected books tell us that your imam (\`Umar) was the
first one to make an innovation in Islam and he declared that himself
when he said (what a good innovation is this) and that was in the story
of the prayer of Taráweeh \[Taráweeh: a long prayer done during Ramadan
by sunnis in groups after the last prayer at night\] when he ordered
people to pray the Nafilah \[Nafilah: a type of prayer in Islam that is
not part of the five daily prayers but prayed as a donation\] in groups,
while God and the prophet prohibited praying a Nafilah in groups, so the
innovation of \`Umar was an obvious disobedience for God and the
prophet!<sup>(1)</sup> Then, did not \`Umar make an innovation in the
Aðán \[Aðán: the call to pray\] when he dropped (Come to the best of
works)

\(1\) Saheeh Al-Bukhári, section of Taráweeh prayer, Al-Sawá\`iq, and
Al-Qastaláni said in the book of Irshád Al-Sári fi Sharh Saheeh
Al-Bukhári part 5, page4, when he reached \`Umar saying (what a good
innovation is this): he called it an innovation because the prophet of
God did not assign it and it was not there at the time of Abu-Bakr and
it was not at the beginning of the night and not in that much \[meaning
not that much rak\`as, or the number of bows done by the prayer while he
prays\]. I say: yes, the caliph of muslims (!) innovate in religion -
congratulations -.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
and added (prayer is better than sleeping)?<sup>(1)</sup>  
did not he innovate when he canceled the share of non-muslims in
opposition to God and His prophet?  
did not he innovate in banning Hajj Al-Tamattu\` in opposition to God
and His prophet?  
did not he innovate in banning Mut\`ah marriage in opposition to God and
His prophet?  
did not he innovate in not applying the law over the criminal and
adulterer: Khalid ben Al-Waleed, in opposition to the command of God and
His prophet about applying the law against the adulterer and the
murderer?  
and so on with your innovations sunnis who follow \`Umar. So, are you
the people of innovation or is it us shiites?  
The king (to the vizier): is it true what \`Alawi mentioned about the
innovations of \`Umar in religion?

\(1\) Al-Qawshaji mentioned and he is one of the greatest sunni ulema
that \`Umar said: three were at the time of the prophet and I ban them
and punish for them: Mut\`ah marriage, and Hajj Al-Tamattu\` and (come
to the best of works), and imam Málik \[a sunni scholar who established
a sub-school\] said in Al-Mawte' that he got tidings saying that the
caller for the pray came to \`Umar ben Al-Khattáb to tell him that
morning prayer is up and he found him asleep, so he said to him: praying
is better than sleeping, so \`Umar ordered him to make it part of the
call to the morning prayer! I say: oh my God, is \`Umar allowed to add
and drop from the call to the prayer -which is a part of the religion-
by his own desires and thought? (the publisher)  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Vizier: yes, some ulema mentioned that in their books!  
The king: then how do we follow someone that innovated in religion?  
\`Alawi: for this reason, following a person like that is a taboo,
because the prophet (PUH) said (every innovation is a misguide, and
every misguide is in hell), so the people who follow \`Umar in his
innovations - and they know about it - they are - surely - people of
hell!  
\`Abbási: but the imams of the (islamic) schools (creeds) admitted the
deed of \`Umar?  
\`Alawi: this is another innovation O king!  
The king: and how is that?  
\`Alawi: because those who established these schools and they are: Abu
Haneefah, Málik ben Anas, Al-Sháfi\`i, and Ahmad ben Hanbal were not at
the time of the prophet (PUH), but they came after him by almost 200
years, so were the muslims in that time between the prophet and those
people all misguided? and what is the necessity of gathering all the
creeds and ways in these four only and neglecting others? did the
prophet advise so?  
The king: what do you say \`Abbási?  
\`Abbási: those were more wise than others!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
The king: were there no wise man except of those?  
\`Abbási: but shiites also follow the creed of Ja\`far Al-Sádiq \[Jafar
Al-Sádiq: the 6th imam for twelve shiites\]?  
\`Alawi: we follow the school of Jafar because his way is the way of the
prophet of God, because he is one of the Household whom God said about
them (Allah's wish is but to remove uncleanness far from you, O Folk of
the Household, and cleanse you with a thorough cleansing, 33:33),
otherwise we follow all the twelve imams but since imam Jafar Al-Sádiq
(PUH) was able to spread the knowledge and the interpretations and the
holy hadiths more than other imams (because of some of the freedom at
his time), and even 4000 pupils used to attend his school<sup>(1)</sup>,
and even he was able to renew the structure of Islam after the trials of
umayyads and abbasids to erase it, thus for this shiites were called
"jafarites" \[or Ja\`fari\] according to the one who restored the
structure of the creed and that is imam Jafar Al-Sádiq (PUH).  
The king: what is your answer O \`Abbási?  
\`Abbási: following the 4 schools is a habit for us sunnis!

(1): Al-Imám Al-Sádiq wal-Maðáhib Al-Arba\`ah, Táreekh Baghdád, and
others.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Alawi: you were but forced by some rulers, and you followed them like
blind people without a clue!  
\`Abbási went silent.  
\`Alawi: O king, I testify that \`Abbási shall be in hell if he remained
like that.  
The king: and how did you know that he shall be in hell?  
\`Alawi: because it is mentioned by the prophet (PUH) that he said (he
who died and did not know the imam of his time, he shall die like an
ignorant), so ask O king, who is the imam of \`Abbási's time?  
\`Abbási: this hadith was not reported for the prophet.  
The king (to the vizier): was this hadith reported or not?  
Vizier: yes it was!<sup>(1)</sup>  
The king (with anger): I thought you \`Abbási are worthy for my trust
but I've found out you are but a liar!

(1): sources: Al-Háfidh Al-Naysáboori in his Saheeh part 8, page108.
Yanabee\` Al-Mawaddah page117. Nafahát Al-Láhoot page3. Saheeh Muslim,
and others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
\`Abbási: I know the imam of my time!  
\`Alawi: and who is he?  
\`Abbási: the king!  
\`Alawi: you should know O king that he is lying, and he is saying that
to get closer to you!  
The king: yes, I know he is lying, and I know myself that I cannot be
the imam of time for the people, because I don't know anything, and I
spend most of my time in hunting and in managing affairs!  
then said the king: O \`Alawi, then who do you think is the imam of
time?  
\`Alawi: the imam of time in my creed is imam Al-Mahdi (PUH) as we
talked about him before as reported from the prophet (PUH), and whoever
knew him shall die as a muslim and he is in paradise, and he who didn't
know him died as an ignorant and he shall be in hell with the people of
ignorance!  
Here, the face of the king shined, and the signs of happiness appeared
on his face and looked upon the attendance and said:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
you should know O people, that I'm satisfied with this debate (which
lasted for three days) and I am sure now that the truth is with shiites
in everything they say and believe in, and the sunnis are people of a
false creed and an astraying belief, and I am one man that when
recognizes the truth, shall obey it and admit it, and I shall not be a
man of falsehood in this life and a man of hell in the Hereafter. For
this, I announce in front of you that I've become a shiite, and who
loves to be with me let him follow me and be a shiite, by the blessings
of God and His mercy, and let himself be out from the darkness of the
falsehood to the light of the truth!  
Vizier: and I knew that, and shiites are right, and that the right
school is the shiites' only. I knew that since I was a pupil, and for
this I announce that I am too a shiite.

Thus, most of the ulema and the ministers and the generals who attended
in the court (and they counted almost as 70) got into the creed of
shiites.  
The tidings of the turning of the king and the vizier Nizam Al-Mulk and
the ministers and the generals and the writers into shiites, reached all
the lands, and many people got into the creed of shiites, and Nizam
Al-Mulk ordered - and he is the father of my wife - that teachers should
teach the creed of shiites in Nizamiyyah schools in Baghdad!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
But some sunni ulema that insisted on the falsehood remained on their
creed like God said (became as rocks, or worse than rocks, for hardness,
2:74).  
And they started to plot against the king and Nizam Al-Mulk and blamed
him for that because he was the planning mind for the land, until the
dirty hand got him -by the orders of those stubborn sunnis- and they
assassinated him in the 12th of Ramadan, year 485AH, and after that they
assassinated Malikshah Saljuqi (Malikshah I).  
we are to God and we shall get back to Him. They were killed on the way
of God and for the truth and faith, so congratulations for them and for
everyone that gets killed on the way of God and for the truth and the
faith.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
and I made a poem of lamentation for the great sheikh Nizam Al-Mulk and
this is some of it:

the vizier Nizam Al-Mulk was a pearl  
so dear made by the merciful from honor

so dear and days did not know its value  
so He for jealousy turned it back to the shell

he chose the creed of right in a debate  
that showed the truth in an obvious clue

the creed of shiites is a truth with no false  
and everything else is just a mirage with a false portiere

but a deep envy they moved for him  
and the full moon of the night remained in an eclipsed shade

upon him shall be a thousand peace from God that follow  
that are read over his soul in the eternity and the houses (of paradise)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

That, and I was an attendant in the court and the debate, and I've
recorded everything that happened in the court, but I've canceled
additions, and made the story short in this book.  
And thank be to God alone, and peace be upon Muhammad and his good
Household and his true followers.  
I wrote it in Baghdad in Nizamiyyah school.
