### VII

*To the effect that Plato, whose thought has deeply influenced the
mysticism and literature of Islam, followed the sheep's doctrine, and
that we must be on our guard against his theories*. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55)

<span class="smallcaps">Plato</span>, the prime ascetic and sage,  
Was one of that ancient flock of sheep.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

His Pegasus went astray in the darkness of philosophy  
And galloped over the mountains of Being.  
He was so fascinated by the Ideal <span class="margnote">635</span>  
That he made head, eye, and ear of no account.  
"To die," said he, "is the secret of Life:  
The candle is glorified by being put out."  
He dominates our thinking,  
His cup sends us to sleep and takes the world away from us. <span
class="margnote">640</span>  
He is a sheep in man's clothing,  
The soul of the Sufi bows to his authority.  
He soared with his intellect to the highest heaven,  
He called the world of phenomena a myth.  
’Twas his work to dissolve the structure of Life <span
class="margnote">645</span>

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

And cut the bough of Life's fair tree asunder.  
The thought of Plato regarded loss as profit,  
His philosophy declared that being is not-being.  
His nature drowsed and created a dream,  
<span class="margnote">650</span> His mind's eye created a mirage.  
Since he was without any taste for action,  
His soul was enraptured by the non-existent.  
He disbelieved in the material universe  
And became the creator of invisible Ideas.  
<span class="margnote">655</span> Sweet is the world of phenomena to the
living spirit,  
Dear is the world of Ideas to the dead spirit:  
Its gazelles have no grace of movement,  
Its partridges are denied the pleasure of walking daintily.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

Its dewdrops are unable to quiver,  
Its birds have no breath in their breasts, <span
class="margnote">660</span>  
Its seed does not desire to grow,  
Its moths do not know how to flutter.  
Our philosopher had no remedy but flight:  
He could not endure the noise of this world.  
He set his heart on the glow of a quenchèd flame <span
class="margnote">665</span>  
And depicted a world steeped in opium.  
He spread his wings towards the sky  
And never came down to his nest again.  
His phantasy is sunk in the jar of heaven:  
I know not whether it is the dregs or the bricks. <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56) <span class="margnote">670</span>  
The peoples were poisoned by his intoxication:  
He slumbered and took no delight in deeds.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_55"></span>[56:1](iq10.htm#fr_55) The direct influence of
Platonism on Moslem thought has been comparatively slight. When the
Moslems began to study Greek philosophy, they turned to Aristotle. The
genuine writings of Aristotle, however, were not accessible to them.
They studied translations of books passing under his name, which were
the work of Neoplatonists, so that what they believed to be Aristotelian
doctrine was in fact the philosophy of Plotinus, Proclus, and the later
Neoplatonic school. Indirectly, therefore, Plato has profoundly
influenced the intellectual and spiritual development of Islam and may
be called, if not the father of Mohammedan mysticism, at any rate its
presiding genius.

either case. The egg-shaped wine jar is supported by bricks in order to
keep it in an upright position.
