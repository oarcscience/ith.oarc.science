### XI

*Story of a young man of Merv who came to the saint Ali Hujwírí—God have
mercy on him!—and complained that he was oppressed by his enemies*.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> saint of Hujwír was venerated by the
peoples,  
And Pír-i Sanjar visited his tomb as a pilgrim. <span
id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md)  
With ease he broke down the mountain-barriers loss  
And sowed the seed of Islam in India.  
The age of Omar was restored by his godliness,

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

The fame of the Truth was exalted by his words.  
He was a guardian of the honour of the Koran,  
<span class="margnote">1090</span> The house of Falsehood fell in ruins
at his gaze.  
The dust of the Panjáb was brought to life by his breath,  
Our dawn was made splendid by his sun.  
He was a lover, and withal a courier of Love:  
The secrets of Love shone forth from his brow.  
<span class="margnote">1095</span> I will tell a story of his
perfection  
And enclose a whole rose-bed in a single bud.  
A young man, cypress-tall,  
Came from the town of Merv to Lahore.  
He went to see the venerable saint,  
<span class="margnote">1100</span> That the sun might dispel his
darkness.  
I am hemmed in," he said, "by foes;  
I am as a glass in the midst of stones.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

Do thou teach me, O sire of heavenly rank,  
How to lead my life amongst enemies!"  
The wise Director, in whose nature <span class="margnote">1105</span>  
Love had allied mercy with wrath,  
Answered: "Thou art unread in Life's lore,  
Careless of its end and its beginning.  
Be without fear of others!  
Thou art a sleeping force: awake! <span class="margnote">1110</span>  
When the stone was anxious on account of the glass,  
It became glass and got into the way of breaking.  
If the traveller thinks himself weak,  
He delivers his soul unto the brigand.  
How long wilt thou regard thyself as water and clay? <span
class="margnote">1115</span>  
Create from thy clay a flaming Sinai!  
Why be angry with mighty men?  
Why complain of enemies?  
I will declare the truth: thine enemy is thy friend;

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="margnote">1120</span> His existence crowns thee with
glory.  
Whosoever knows the states of the Self  
Considers a powerful enemy to be a blessing from God.  
To the seed of Man the enemy is as a rain-cloud:  
He awakens its potentialities.  
<span class="margnote">1125</span> If thy spirit be strong, the stones
in thy way are as water:  
What reeks the torrent of the ups and downs of the road?  
The sword of resolution is whetted by the stones in the way  
And put to proof by traversing stage after stage.  
What is the use of eating and sleeping like a beast?  
<span class="margnote">1130</span> What is the use of being, unless thou
have strength in thyself?  
When thou mak’st thyself strong with Self,  
Thou wilt destroy the world at thy pleasure.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

If thou wouldst pass away, become free of Self;  
If thou wouldst live, become full of Self! <span
id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84.md)  
What is death? To become oblivious to Self. <span
class="margnote">1135</span>  
Why imagine that it is the parting of soul and body?  
Abide in Self, like Joseph!  
Advance from captivity to empire!  
Think of Self and be a man of action!  
Be a man of God, bear mysteries within!" <span
class="margnote">1140</span>

I will explain the matter by means of stories,  
I will open the bud by the power of my breath.  
"’Tis better that a lovers’ secret  
Should be told by the lips of others." <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_83"></span>[95:1](iq14.htm#fr_83.md) Hujwírí, author of the
oldest Persian treatise on Sufism, was a native of Ghazna in
Afghanistan. He died at Lahore about <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>
1072. Pír-i Sanjar is the renowned saint, Mu’ínuddín, head of the
Chishtí order of dervishes, who died in A. n. 1235 at Ajmír.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[99:1](iq14.htm#fr_84.md) These lines correct the
Súfí doctrine that by means of passing away from individuality the
mystic attains to everlasting life in God.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[99:2](iq14.htm#fr_85.md) *I.e.* allegorically.
This verse occurs in the *Masnaví*.
