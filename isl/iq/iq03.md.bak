### PROLOGUE

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> the world-illuming sun rushed  
upon Night like a brigand,  
My weeping bedewed the face of the rose.  
My tears washed away sleep from the eye of the narcissus,  
My passion wakened the grass and made it grow.  
The Gardener taught me to sing with power, <span
class="margnote">5</span>  
He sowed a verse and reaped a sword.  
In the soil he planted only the seed of my tears  
And wove my lament with the garden, as warp and woof.

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

Tho’ I am but a mote, the radiant sun is mine:  
<span class="margnote">10</span> Within my bosom are a hundred dawns.  
My dust is brighter than Jamshíd's cup, <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md)  
It knows things that are yet unborn in the world.  
My thought hunted down and slung from the saddle a deer  
That has not yet leaped forth from the covert of non-existence.  
<span class="margnote">15</span> Fair is my garden ere yet the leaves
are green:  
Full-blown roses are hidden in the skirt of my garment.  
I struck dumb the musicians where they were gathered together,  
I smote the heartstrings of all that heard me,  
Because the lute of my genius hath a rare melody:  
<span class="margnote">20</span> Even to comrades my song is strange.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

I am born in the world as a new sun,  
I have not learned the ways and fashions of the sky:  
Not yet have the stars fled before my splendour,  
Not yet is my quicksilver astir;  
Untouched is the sea by my dancing rays, <span
class="margnote">25</span>  
Untouched are the mountains by my crimson hue.  
The eye of existence is not familiar with me;  
I rise trembling, afraid to show myself.  
From the East my dawn arrived and routed Night,  
A fresh dew settled on the rose of the world. <span
class="margnote">30</span>  
I am waiting for the votaries that rise at dawn:  
Oh, happy they who shall worship my fire!  
I have no need of the ear of To-day,  
I am the voice of the poet of To-morrow.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="margnote">35</span> My own age does not understand my deep
meanings,  
My Joseph is not for this market.  
I despair of my old companions,  
My Sinai burns for sake of the Moses who is coming.  
Their sea is silent, like dew,  
<span class="margnote">40</span> But my dew is storm-ridden, like the
ocean.  
My song is of another world than theirs:  
This bell calls other travellers to take the road.  
How many a poet after his death  
Opened our eyes when his own were closed,  
<span class="margnote">45</span> And journeyed forth again from
nothingness  
When roses blossomed o’er the earth of his grave!  
Albeit caravans have passed through this desert,  
They passed, as a camel steps, with little sound.

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

But I am a lover: loud crying is my faith:  
The clamour of Judgement Day is one of my minions. <span
class="margnote">50</span>  
My song exceeds the range of the chord,  
Yet I do not fear that my lute will break.  
’Twere better for the waterdrop not to know my torrent,  
Whose fury should rather madden the sea.  
No river will contain my Omán: <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) <span
class="margnote">55</span>  
My flood requires whole seas to hold it.  
Unless the bud expand into a bed of roses,  
It is unworthy of my spring-cloud's bounty.  
Lightnings slumber within my soul,  
I sweep over mountain and plain. <span class="margnote">60</span>  
Wrestle with my sea, if thou art a plain;

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Receive my lightning, if thou art a Sinai.  
The Fountain of Life hath been given me to drink,  
I have been made an adept of the mystery of Life.  
<span class="margnote">65</span> The speck of dust was vitalised by my
burning song:  
It unfolded wings and became a firefly.  
No one hath told the secret which I will tell  
Or threaded a pearl of thought like mine.  
Come, if thou would’st know the secret of everlasting life!  
<span class="margnote">70</span> Come, if thou would’st win both earth
and heaven!  
The old Guru of the Sky taught me this lore,  
I cannot hide it from my comrades.  
O Saki! arise and pour wine into the cup,

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

Clear the vexation of Time from my heart!  
The sparkling liquor that flows from Zemzem— <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) <span class="margnote">75</span>  
Were it a beggar, a king would pay homage to it.  
It makes thought more sober and wise,  
It makes the keen eye keener,  
It gives to a straw the weight of a mountain,  
And to foxes the strength of lions. <span class="margnote">80</span>  
It causes dust to soar to the Pleiades  
And a drop of water swell to the breadth of the sea.  
It turns silence into the din of Judgement Day,  
It makes the foot of the partridge red with blood of the hawk.  
Arise and pour pure wine into my cup, <span class="margnote">85</span>  
Pour moonbeams into the dark night of my thought,

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

That I may lead home the wanderer  
And imbue the idle looker-on with restless impatience;  
And advance hotly on a new quest  
<span class="margnote">90</span> And become known as the champion of a
new spirit;  
And be to people of insight as the pupil to the eye,  
And sink into the ear of the world, like a voice;  
And exalt the worth of Poesy  
And sprinkle the dry herbs with my tears.  
<span class="margnote">95</span> Inspired by the genius of the Master of
Rúm, <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md)  
I rehearse the sealed book of secret lore.  
His soul is the source of the flames,  
I am but as the spark that gleams for a moment.

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

His burning candle consumed me, the moth;  
His wine overwhelmed my goblet. <span class="margnote">100</span>  
The Master of Rúm transmuted my earth to gold  
And clothed my barren dust with beauty.  
The grain of sand set forth from the  desert,  
That it might win the radiance of the sun.  
I am a wave and I will come to rest in his sea, <span
class="margnote">105</span>  
That I may make the glistening pearl mine own.  
I who am drunken with the wine of his song  
Will draw life from the breath of his words.

’Twas night: my heart would fain lament,  
The. silence was filled with my cries to God. <span
class="margnote">110</span>

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

I was complaining of the sorrows of the world  
And bewailing the emptiness of my cup.  
At last mine eye could endure no more,  
Broken with fatigue it went to sleep.  
<span class="margnote">115</span> There appeared the Master, formed in
the mould of Truth,  
Who wrote the Koran of Persia. <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md)  
He said, "O frenzied lover,  
Take a draught of love's pure wine.  
Strike the chords of thine heart and rouse a tumultuous strain,  
<span class="margnote">120</span> Dash thine head against the
cupping-glass and thine eye against the lancet!  
Make thy laughter the source of a hundred sighs,  
Make the hearts of men bleed with thy tears!  
How long wilt thou be silent, like a bud?  
Sell thy fragrance cheap, like the rose!

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

Tongue-tied, thou art in pain: <span class="margnote">125</span>  
Cast thyself upon the fire, like rue! <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md)  
Like the bell, break silence at last, and from every limb  
Utter forth a lamentation!  
Thou art fire: fill the world with thy glow!  
Make others burn with thy burning! <span class="margnote">130</span>  
Proclaim the secrets of the old wine-seller; <span
id="fr_28"></span>[2](#fn_28.md)  
Be thou a surge of wine, and the crystal cup thy robe!  
Shatter the mirror of fear,  
Break the bottles in the bazaar!  
Like the reed-flute, bring a message from the reeds; <span
class="margnote">135</span>  
Give to Majnún a message from Lailá! <span
id="fr_29"></span>[3](#fn_29.md)  
Create a new style for thy song,  
Enrich the feast with thy piercing strains!

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

Up, and re-inspire every living soul!  
<span class="margnote">140</span> Say 'Arise!' and by that word quicken
the living!  
Up, and set thy feet on another path;  
Put aside the passionate melancholy of old!  
Become familiar with the delight of singing;  
O bell of the caravan, awake!"

<span class="margnote">145</span> At these words my bosom was
enkindled  
And swelled with emotion like the flute;  
I rose like music from the string  
To prepare a Paradise for the ear.  
I unveiled the mystery of the. Self  
<span class="margnote">150</span> And disclosed its wondrous secret.

My being was as an unfinished statue,  
Uncomely, worthless, good for nothing.  
Love chiselled me: I became a man  
And gained knowledge of the nature of the universe.

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

I have seen the movement of the sinews of the sky, <span
class="margnote">155</span>  
And the blood coursing in the veins of the moon.  
Many a night I wept for Man's sake  
That I might tear the veil from Life's mysteries,  
And extract the secret of Life's constitution  
From the laboratory of phenomena. <span class="margnote">160</span>  
I who give beauty to this night, like the moon,  
Am as dust in devotion to the pure Faith (Islam)  
A Faith renowned in hill and dale,  
Which kindles in men's hearts a flame of undying song:  
It sowed an atom and reaped a sun, <span class="margnote">165</span>  
It harvested a hundred poets like Rúmí and Attar.  
I am a sigh: I will mount to the heavens;  
I am a breath, yet am I sprung of fire.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

Driven onward by high thoughts, my pen  
<span class="margnote">170</span> Cast abroad the secret of this veil,  
That the drop may become co-equal with the sea  
And the grain of sand grow into a Sahara.  
Poetising is not the aim of this *masnaví*,  
Beauty-worshipping and love-making is not its aim.  
<span class="margnote">175</span> I am of India: Persian is not my
native tongue;  
I am like the crescent moon: my cup is not full.  
Do not seek from me charm of style in exposition,  
Do not seek from me Khánsár and Isfahan. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md)  
Although the language of Hind is sweet as sugar,  
<span class="margnote">180</span> Yet sweeter is the fashion of Persian
speech.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

My mind was enchanted by its loveliness,  
My pen became as a twig of the Burning Bush.  
Because of the loftiness of my thoughts,  
Persian alone is suitable to them.  
O Reader, do not find fault with the wine-cup, <span
class="margnote">185</span>  
But consider attentively the taste of the wine.
