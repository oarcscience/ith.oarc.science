*Story of the bird that was faint with thirst*.

<span class="margnote">1145</span> <span class="smallcaps">A bird</span>
was faint with thirst,  
The breath in his body was heaving like waves of smoke.  
He saw a diamond in the garden:  
Thirst created a vision of water.  
Deceived by the sunbright stone  
<span class="margnote">1150</span> The foolish bird fancied that it was
water.  
He got no moisture from the gem:  
He pecked it with his beak, but it did not wet his palate.  
"O thrall of vain desire," said the diamond,

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

"Thou hast sharpened thy greedy beak on me;  
But I am not a dewdrop, I give no drink, <span
class="margnote">1155</span>  
I do not live for the sake of others.  
Wouldst thou hurt me? Thou art mad!  
A life that reveals the Self is strange to thee.  
My water will shiver the beaks of birds  
And break the jewel of man's life." <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86.md)
<span class="margnote">1160</span>  
The bird won not his heart's wish from the diamond  
And turned away from the sparkling stone.  
Disappointment swelled in his breast,  
The song in his throat became a wail.  
Upon a rose-twig a drop of dew <span class="margnote">1165</span>  
Gleamed like the tear in a nightingale's eye:  
All its glitter was owing to the sun,  
It was trembling in fear of the sun

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

A restless sky-born star  
<span class="margnote">1170</span> That had stopped for a moment, from
desire to be seen;  
Oft deceived by bud and flower,  
It had gained nothing from Life.  
There it hung, ready to drop,  
Like a tear on the eyelashes of a lover who hath lost his heart.  
<span class="margnote">1175</span> The sorely distressed bird hopped
under the rose-bush,  
The dewdrop trickled into his mouth.  
O thou that wouldst deliver thy soul from enemies,  
I ask thee—"Art thou a drop of water or a gem?"  
When the bird melted in the fire of thirst,  
<span class="margnote">1190</span> It appropriated the life of
another.  
The drop was not solid and gem-like;  
The diamond had a being, the drop had none.  
Never for an instant neglect Self-preservation:

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

Be a diamond, not a dewdrop!  
Be massive in nature, like mountains, <span
class="margnote">1185</span>  
And bear on thy crest a hundred clouds laden with floods of rain!  
Save thyself by affirmation of Self,  
Compress thy quicksilver into silver ore!  
Produce a melody from the string of Self,  
Make manifest the secrets of Self! <span class="margnote">1190</span>
