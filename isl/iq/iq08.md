### V

*Showing that when the Self is strengthened by Love it gains dominion
over the outward and inward forces of the universe*.

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> the Self is made strong by Love  
Its power rules the whole world.  
The Heavenly Sage who adorned the sky with stars <span
class="margnote">485</span>  
Plucked these buds from the bough of the Self.  
Its hand becomes God's hand,  
The moon is split by its fingers.  
It is the arbitrator in all the quarrels of the world,  
Its command is obeyed by Darius and Jamshíd. <span
class="margnote">490</span>

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

I will tell thee a story of Bú Ali, <span
id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md)  
Whose name is renowned in India,  
Him who sang of the ancient rose-garden  
And discoursed to us about the lovely rose:  
<span class="margnote">495</span> The air of his fluttering skirt  
Made a Paradise of this fire-born country.  
His young disciple went one day to the bazaar—  
The wine of Bú Ali's discourse had turned his head.  
The governor of the city was coming along on horseback,  
<span class="margnote">500</span> His servant and staff-bearer rode
beside him.  
The forerunner shouted, "O senseless one,  
Do not get in the way of the governor's escort!"

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

But the dervish walked on with drooping head,  
Sunk in the sea of his own thoughts.  
The staff-bearer, drunken with pride, <span
class="margnote">505</span>  
Broke his staff on the head of the dervish,  
Who stepped painfully out of the governor's way,  
Sad and sorry, with a heavy heart.  
He came to Bú Ali and complained  
And released the tears from his eyes. <span
class="margnote">510</span>  
Like lightning that falls on mountains,  
The Sheikh poured forth a fiery torrent of speech.  
He let loose from his soul a strange fire,  
He gave an order to his secretary:  
Take thy pen and write a letter <span class="margnote">515</span>  
From a dervish to a sultan!  
Say, 'Thy governor has broken my servant's head;  
He has cast burning coals on his own life.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

Arrest this wicked governor,  
<span class="margnote">520</span> Or else I will bestow thy kingdom on
another.'"  
The letter of the saint who had access to God  
Caused the monarch to tremble in every limb.  
His body was filled with aches,  
He grew as pale as the evening sun.  
<span class="margnote">525</span> He sought out a handcuff for the
governor  
And entreated Bú Ali to pardon this offence.  
Khusrau, the sweet-voiced eloquent poet, <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md)  
Whose harmonies flow from the creative mind  
And whose genius hath the soft brilliance of moonlight,  
<span class="margnote">530</span> Was chosen to be the king's
ambassador.

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

When he entered Bú Ali's presence and played his lute,  
His song melted the fakir's soul like glass.  
One strain of poesy bought the grace  
Of a majesty that was firm as a mountain.  
Do not wound the hearts of dervishes, <span
class="margnote">535</span>  
Do not throw thyself into burning fire!
