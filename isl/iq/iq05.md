###### II

*Showing that the life of the Self comes from forming desires and
bringing them to birth*.

<span class="smallcaps">Life</span> is preserved by purpose:  
Because of the goal its caravan-bell tinkles.  
Life is latent in seeking,  
Its origin is hidden in desire. <span class="margnote">270</span>  
Keep desire alive in thy heart,  
Lest thy little dust become a tomb.  
Desire is the soul of this world of hue and scent,  
The nature of every thing is faithful to desire.  
Desire sets the heart dancing in the breast, <span
class="margnote">275</span>

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

And by its glow the breast is made bright as a mirror.  
It gives to earth the power of soaring,  
It is a Khizr to the Moses of perception. <span
id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33)  
From the flame of desire the heart takes life,  
<span class="margnote">280</span> And when it takes life, all dies that
is not true.  
When it refrains from forming wishes,  
Its pinion breaks and it cannot soar.  
Desire is an emotion of the Self:  
It is a restless wave of the Self's sea.  
<span class="margnote">285</span> Desire is a noose for hunting
ideals,  
A binder of the book of deeds.  
Negation of desire is death to the living,  
Even as absence of burning extinguishes the flame.  
What is the source of our wakeful eye?  
<span class="margnote">290</span> Our delight in seeing hath taken
visible shape.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

The partridge's leg is derived from the elegance of its gait,  
The nightingale's beak from its endeavour to sing.  
Away from the reed-bed, the reed became happy:  
The music was released from its prison. <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34)  
Why does the mind strive after new discoveries and scale the heavens?
<span class="margnote">295</span>  
Knowest thou what works this miracle?  
’Tis desire that enriches Life,  
And the intellect is a child of its womb.  
What are social organisation, customs, and laws?  
What is the secret of the novelties of <span class="margnote">300</span>
science?  
A desire which broke through by its own strength  
And burst forth from the heart and took shape.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

Nose, hand, brain, eye, and ear,  
Thought, imagination, feeling, memory, and understanding  
<span class="margnote">305</span> All these are weapons devised for
self-preservation  
By him that rides into the battle of Life.  
The object of science and art is not knowledge,  
The object of the garden is not the bud and the flower.  
Science is an instrument for the preservation of Life,  
<span class="margnote">310</span> Science is a means of establishing the
Self.  
Science and art are servants of Life,  
Slaves born and bred in its house.  
Rise, O thou who art strange to Life's mystery,  
Rise intoxicated with the wine of an ideal!  
<span class="margnote">315</span> If thou art an ideal, thou wilt shine
as the dawn

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

And be to all else as a blazing fire.  
If thou art an ideal, thou art higher than Heaven  
Winning, captivating, enchanting men's hearts;  
A destroyer of ancient falsehood,  
Fraught with turmoil, an embodiment of the Last Day. <span
class="margnote">320</span>  
We live by forming ideals,  
We glow with the sunbeams of desire!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_33"></span>[24:1](iq05.htm#fr_33) Cf. Koran, ch. 18, vv.
64-80. Khizr represents the mystic seer whose actions are misjudged by
persons of less insight.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[25:1](iq05.htm#fr_34) *I.e.* the reed was made
into a flute.
