### VIII

*Concerning the true nature of poetry and the reform of Islamic
literature*.

<span class="smallcaps">’Tis</span> the brand of desire makes the blood
of man run warm,  
By the lamp of desire this dust is enkindled.  
<span class="margnote">676</span> By desire Life's cup is brimmed with
wine,  
So that Life leaps to its feet and marches briskly on.  
Life is occupied with conquest alone,  
And the one charm for conquest is desire.  
Life is the hunter and desire the snare,  
<span class="margnote">680</span> Desire is Love's message to Beauty.  
Wherefore doth desire swell continuously

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

The bass and treble of Life's song?  
Whatsoever is good and fair and beautiful  
Is our guide in the wilderness of seeking.  
Its image becomes impressed on thine heart, <span
class="margnote">685</span>  
It creates desires in thine heart.  
Beauty is the creator of desire's spring-tide,  
Desire is nourished by the display of Beauty.  
’Tis in the poet's breast that Beauty unveils,  
’Tis from his Sinai that Beauty's beams arise. <span
class="margnote">690</span>  
By his look the fair is made fairer,  
Through his enchantments Nature is more beloved.  
From his lips the nightingale hath learned her song,  
And his rouge hath brightened the cheek of the rose.

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

<span class="margnote">695</span> ’Tis his passion burns in the heart of
the moth,  
’Tis he that lends glowing hues to love-tales.  
Sea and land are hidden within his water and clay, <span
id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57)  
A hundred new worlds are concealed in his heart.  
Ere tulips blossomed in his brain  
<span class="margnote">700</span> There was heard no note of joy or
grief.  
His music breathes o’er us a wonderful enchantment,  
His pen draws a mountain with a single hair.  
His thoughts dwell with the moon and the stars,  
He creates beauty in that which is ugly and strange.  
<span class="margnote">705</span> He is a Khizr, and amidst his darkness
is the Fountain of Life: <span id="fr_58"></span>[2](#fn_58)

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

All things that exist are made more living by his tears.  
Heavily we go, like raw novices,  
Stumbling on the way to the goal.  
His nightingale hath played a tune  
And laid a plot to beguile us, <span class="margnote">710</span>  
That he may lead us into Life's Paradise,  
And that Life's bow may become a full circle.  
Caravans march at the sound of his bell  
And follow the voice of his pipe;  
But when his zephyr blows in our gardens, <span
class="margnote">715</span>  
We stay loitering amongst tulips and roses.  
His witchery makes Life develop itself  
And become self-questioning and impatient.  
He invites the whole world to his table;  
He lavishes his fire as though it were cheap as air. <span
class="margnote">720</span>  
Woe to a people that resigns itself to death,

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

And whose poet turns away from the joy of living!  
His mirror shows beauty as ugliness,  
His honey leaves a hundred stings in the heart.  
<span class="margnote">725</span> His kiss robs the rose of freshness,  
He takes away from the nightingale's heart the joy of flying.  
Thy sinews are relaxed by his opium,  
Thou payest for his song with thy life.  
He bereaves the cypress of delight in its beauty,  
<span class="margnote">730</span> His cold breath makes a pheasant of
the male falcon.  
He is a fish, and from the breast upward a man,  
Like the Sirens in the ocean.  
With his song he enchants the pilot  
And casts the ship to the bottom of the sea.  
<span class="margnote">735</span> His melodies steal firmness from thine
heart,

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

His magic persuades thee that death is life.  
He takes from thy soul the desire of existence,  
He extracts from thy mine the blushing ruby.  
He dresses gain in the garb of loss,  
He makes everything praiseworthy blameful. <span
class="margnote">740</span>  
He plunges thee in a sea of thought,  
He makes thee a stranger to action.  
He is sick, and by his words our sickness is increased:  
The more his cup goes round, the more sick are they that quaff it.  
There are no lightning-rains in his April, <span
class="margnote">745</span>  
His garden is a mirage of colour and perfume.  
His beauty hath no dealings with Truth,  
There are none but flawed pearls in his sea.  
Slumber he deemed sweeter than waking:

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

<span class="margnote">750</span> Our fire was quenched by his breath.  
By the chant of his nightingale the heart was poisoned:  
Under his heap of roses lurked a snake.  
Beware of his decanter and cup!  
Beware of his sparkling wine!  
<span class="margnote">755</span> O thou whom his wine hath laid low  
And who look’st to his glass for thy rising dawn,  
O thou whose heart hath been chilled by his melodies,  
Thou hast drunk deadly poison through the ear!  
Thy way of life is a proof of thy degeneracy,  
<span class="margnote">760</span> The strings of thine instrument are
out of tune.  
’Tis pampered ease hath made thee so wretched,  
A disgrace to Islam throughout the world.  
One can bind thee with the vein of a rose,

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

One can wound thee with a zephyr.  
Love hath been put to shame by thy wailing, <span
class="margnote">765</span>  
His fair picture hath been fouled by thy brush.  
Thy ill-usage hath paled his cheek,  
Thy coldness hath taken the glow from his fire.  
He is heartsick from thy heart-sicknesses,  
And enfeebled by thy feeblenesses. <span class="margnote">770</span>  
His cup is full of childish tears,  
His house is furnished with distressful sighs. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59)  
He is a drunkard begging at tavern-doors,  
Stealing glimpses of beauty from lattices,  
Unhappy, melancholy, injured, <span class="margnote">775</span>  
Kicked well-nigh to death by the warder;

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

Wasted like a reed by sorrows,  
On his lips a store of complaints against Heaven.  
Flattery and spite are the mettle of his mirror,  
<span class="margnote">780</span> Helplessness his comrade of old;  
A miserable base-born underling  
Without worth or hope or object,  
Whose lamentations have sucked the marrow from thy soul  
And driven off gentle sleep from thy neighbours’ eyes.  
<span class="margnote">785</span> Alas for a love whose fire is
extinct,  
A love that was born in the Holy  
Place and died in the house of idols!  
Oh, if thou hast the coin of poesy in thy purse,  
Rub it on the touchstone of Life!  
Clear-seeing thought shows the way to action,  
<span class="margnote">790</span> As the lightning-flash precedes the
thunder.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

It behoves thee to meditate well concerning literature,  
It behoves thee to go back to the Arabs:  
Thou must needs give thine heart to the Salmá of Araby, <span
id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60)  
That the morn of the Hijáz may blossom  
from the night of Kurdistan. <span id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_61)  
Thou hast gathered roses from the garden of Persia <span
class="margnote">795</span>  
And seen the springtide of India and Iran:

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

Now taste a little of the heat of the desert,  
Drink the old wine of the date!  
Lay thine head for once on its hot breast,  
<span class="margnote">800</span> Yield thy body awhile to its scorching
wind!  
For a long time thou hast turned about on a bed of silk:  
Now accustom thyself to rough cotton!  
For generations thou hast danced on tulips  
And bathed thy cheek in dew, like the rose:  
<span class="margnote">805</span> Now throw thyself on the burning
sand  
And plunge into the fountain of Zemzem!  
How long wilt thou fain lament like the nightingale?  
How long make thine abode in gardens?  
O thou whose auspicious snare would do honour to the Phœnix,  
<span class="margnote">810</span> Build a nest on the high mountains,

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

A nest embosomed in lightning and thunder,  
Loftier than eagle's eyrie,  
That thou mayst be fit for Life's battle,  
That thy body and soul may burn in Life's fire!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_57"></span>[62:1](iq11.htm#fr_57) *I.e.* in his body.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[62:2](iq11.htm#fr_58) Khizr, according to the
legend, discovered the Fountain of Life in the Land of Darkness.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[67:1](iq11.htm#fr_59) In this passage the
author assails the Persian and Urdu poetry so much in favour with his
contemporaries.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[69:1](iq11.htm#fr_60) Arabic odes usually begin
with a prelude in which the poet makes mention of his beloved; and her
name is often Salmá. Here "the Salmá of Araby" refers to the Koran and
the ideals for which it stands.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[69:2](iq11.htm#fr_61) It is related that an
ignorant Kurd came to some students and besought them to instruct him in
the mysteries of Sufism. They told him that he must fasten a rope to the
roof of his house, then tie the loose end to his feet and suspend
himself, head downwards; and that he must remain in this posture as long
as possible, reciting continually some words of gibberish which they
taught him. The poor man did not perceive that he was being mocked. He
followed their instructions and passed the whole night repeating the
words given him. God rewarded his faith and sincerity by granting him
illumination, so that he became a saint and could discourse learnedly on
the most abstruse matters of mystical theology. Afterwards he used to
say, "In the evening I was a Kurd, but the next morning I was an Arab."
