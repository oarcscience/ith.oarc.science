### XIV

*Story of the Sheikh and the Brahmin, followed by a conversation between
Ganges and Himalaya to the effect that the continuation of social life
depends on firm attachment to the characteristic traditions of the
community*.

<span class="smallcaps">At</span> Benares lived a venerable Brahmin,  
Whose head was deep in the ocean of Being and Not-being.  
He had a large knowledge of philosophy  
But was well-disposed to the seekers after God.  
<span class="margnote">1235</span> His mind was eager to explore new
problems,  
His intellect moved on a level with the Pleiades;

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

His nest was as high as that of the Anká; <span
id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87.md)  
Sun and moon were cast, like rue, on the flame of his thought. <span
id="fr_88"></span>[2](#fn_88.md)  
For a long time he laboured and sweated,  
But philosophy brought no wine to his Cup. <span
class="margnote">1240</span>  
Although he set many a snare in the gardens of learning,  
His snares never caught a glimpse of the Ideal bird;  
And notwithstanding that the nails of his thought were dabbled with
blood,  
The knot of Being and Not-being remained untied.  
The sighs on his lips bore witness to his despair, <span
class="margnote">1245</span>  
His countenance told tales of his distraction.  
One day he visited an excellent Sheikh,

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

A man who had in his breast a heart of gold.  
The Sheikh laid the seal of silence on his lips  
<span class="margnote">1250</span> While he lent his ear to the Sage's
discourse.  
Then he said: "O wanderer in the lofty sky,  
Pledge thyself to be true, for a little, to the earth!  
Thou hast lost thy way in wildernesses of speculation,  
Thy fearless thought hath passed beyond Heaven.  
<span class="margnote">1255</span> Be reconciled with earth, O
sky-traveller!  
Do not wander in quest of the essence of the stars!  
I do not bid thee abandon thine idols.  
Art thou an unbeliever? Then be worthy of the badge of unbelief! <span
id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md)

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

O inheritor of ancient culture,  
Turn not thy back on the path thy fathers trod! <span
class="margnote">1260</span>  
If a people's life is derived from unity,  
Unbelief too is a source of unity.  
Thou that art not even a perfect infidel  
Art unfit to worship at the shrine of the spirit.  
We both are far astray from the road of devotion: <span
class="margnote">1265</span>  
Thou art far from Ázar, and I from Abraham. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md)  
Our Majnún hath not fallen into melancholy for his Lailá's sake:  
He hath not become perfect in the madness of love.  
When the lamp of Self expires,  
What is the use of heaven-surveying imagination?" <span
class="margnote">1270</span>  
Once on a time, laying hold of the skirt of the mountain,

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

Ganges said to Himalaya:  
"O thou mantled in snow since the morn of creation,  
Thou whose form is girdled with streams,  
<span class="margnote">1275</span> God made thee a partner in the
secrets of heaven,  
But deprived thy foot of graceful gait.  
He took away from thee the power to walk:  
What avails this sublimity and stateliness?  
Life springs from perpetual movement:  
<span class="margnote">1280</span> Motion constitutes the wave's whole
existence."  
When the mountain heard this taunt from the river,  
He puffed angrily like a sea of fire,  
And answered: "Thy wide waters are my looking-glass;  
Within my bosom are a hundred rivers like thee.

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

This graceful gait of thine is an instrument of death: <span
class="margnote">1285</span>  
Whoso goeth from Self is meet to die.  
Thou hast no knowledge of thine own case,  
Thou exultest in thy misfortune: thou art a fool!  
O born of the womb of the revolving sphere,  
A fallen-in bank is better than thou! <span
class="margnote">1290</span>  
Thou hast made thine existence an offering to the ocean,  
Thou hast thrown the rich purse of thy life to the highwayman.  
Be self-contained like the rose in the garden,  
Do not go to the florist in order to smell sweet!  
To live is to grow in thyself <span class="margnote">1295</span>  
And gather roses from thine own flower-bed.  
Ages have gone by and my foot is fast in earth:

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

Dost thou fancy that I am far from my goal?  
My being grew and reached the sky,  
<span class="margnote">1300</span> The Pleiads sank to rest under my
skirts;  
Thy being vanishes in the ocean,  
But on my crest the stars bow their heads.  
Mine eye sees the mysteries of heaven,  
Mine ear is familiar with angels’ wings.  
<span class="margnote">1305</span> Since I glowed with the heat of
unceasing toil,  
I amassed rubies, diamonds, and other gems.  
I am stone within, and in the stone is fire .  
Water cannot pass over my fire!"  
Art thou a drop of water? Do not break at thine own feet,  
<span class="margnote">1310</span> But endeavour to surge and wrestle
with the sea.  
Desire the water of a jewel, become a jewel!

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

Be an ear-drop, adorn a beauty!  
Oh, expand thyself! Move swiftly!  
Be a cloud that shoots lightning and sheds a flood of rain!  
Let the ocean sue for thy storms as a beggar, <span
class="margnote">1315</span>  
Let it complain of the straitness of thy skirts!  
Let it deem itself less than a wave  
And glide along at thy feet!
