### III

*Showing that the Self is strengthened by Love*. <span
id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md)

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> luminous point whose name is the
Self  
Is the life-spark beneath our dust.  
<span class="margnote">325</span> By Love it is made more lasting,  
More living, more burning, more glowing.  
From Love proceeds the radiance of its being  
And the development of its unknown possibilities.  
Its nature gathers fire from Love,  
<span class="margnote">330</span> Love instructs it to illumine the
world.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

Love fears neither sword nor dagger,  
Love is not born of water and air and earth.  
Love makes peace and war in the world,  
The Fountain of Life is Love's flashing sword.  
The hardest rocks are shivered by Love's glance: <span
class="margnote">335</span>  
Love of God at last becomes wholly God.  
Learn thou to love, and seek to be loved:  
Seek an eye like Noah's, a heart like Job's!  
Transmute thy handful of earth into gold,  
Kiss the threshold of a Perfect Man! <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md)
<span class="margnote">340</span>  
Like Rúmí, light thy candle  
And burn Rúm in the fire of Tabríz! <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md)

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

There is a beloved hidden within thine heart:  
I will show him to thee, if thou hast eyes to see.  
<span class="margnote">345</span> His lovers are fairer than the fair,  
Sweeter and comelier and more beloved.  
By love of him the heart is made strong  
And earth rubs shoulders with the Pleiades.  
The soil of Najd was quickened by his grace  
<span class="margnote">350</span> And fell into a rapture and rose to
the skies. <span id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md)  
In the Moslem's heart is the home of Mohammed,  
All our glory is from the name of Mohammed.  
Sinai is but an eddy of the dust of his house,  
The sanctuary of the Ka‘ba is his dwelling-place.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

Eternity is less than a moment of his time, <span
class="margnote">355</span>  
Eternity receives increase from his essence.  
He slept on a mat of rushes,  
But the crown of Chosroes was under his people's feet.  
He chose the nightly solitude of Mount Hirá,  
And he founded a state and laws and government. <span
class="margnote">360</span>  
He passed many a night with sleepless eyes  
In order that the Moslems might sleep on the throne of Persia.  
In the hour of battle, iron was melted by his sword;  
In the hour of prayer, tears fell like rain from his eye.  
When he was called to aid, his sword answered "Amen" <span
class="margnote">365</span>  
And extirpated the race of kings.  
He instituted new laws in the world,

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

He brought the empires of antiquity to an end.  
With the key of religion he opened the door of this world:  
<span class="margnote">370</span> The womb of the world never bore his
like.  
In his sight high and low were one,  
He sat with his slave at one table.  
The daughter of the chieftain of Tai  
was taken prisoner in battle <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md)  
And brought into that exalted presence;  
<span class="margnote">375</span> Her feet in chains, unveiled,  
And her neck bowed with shame.  
When the Prophet saw that the poor girl had no veil,  
He covered her face with his own veil.  
We are more naked than that lady of Tai,  
<span class="margnote">380</span> We are unveiled before the nations of
the world.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

In him is our trust on the Day of Judgement,  
And in this world too he is our protector.  
Both his favour and his wrath are entirely a mercy:  
That is a mercy to his friends and this to his foes.  
He opened the gates of mercy to his enemies, <span
class="margnote">385</span>  
He gave to Mecca the message, "No blame shall be laid upon you."  
We who know not the bonds of country  
Resemble sight, which is one though it be the light of two eyes.  
We belong to the Hijáz and China and Persia,  
Yet we are the dew of one smiling dawn. <span
class="margnote">390</span>  
We are all under the spell of the eye of the cupbearer from Mecca,  
We are united as wine and cup.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

He burnt clean away distinctions of lineage,  
His fire consumed this trash and rubble.  
<span class="margnote">395</span> We are like a rose with many petals
but with one perfume:  
He is the soul of this society, and he is one.  
We were the secret concealed in his heart:  
He spake out fearlessly, and we were revealed.  
The song of love for him fills my silent reed,  
<span class="margnote">400</span> A hundred notes throb in my bosom.  
How shall I tell what devotion he inspires?  
A block of dry wood wept at parting from him. <span
id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md)  
The Moslem's being is where he manifests his glory:  
Many a Sinai springs from the dust on his path.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

My image was created by his mirror, <span class="margnote">405</span>  
My dawn rises from the sun of his breast.  
My repose is a perpetual fever,  
My evening hotter than the morning of Judgement Day: <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md)  
He is the April cloud and I his garden,  
My vine is bedewed with his rain. <span class="margnote">410</span>  
I sowed mine eye in the field of Love  
And reaped a harvest of delight.  
"The soil of Medina is sweeter than both worlds:  
Oh, happy the town where dwells the Beloved!" <span
id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md)  
I am lost in admiration of the style of Mullá Jámí: <span
class="margnote">415</span>  
His verse and prose are a remedy for my immaturity.  
He has written poetry overflowing with beautiful ideas

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

And has threaded pearls in praise of the Master—  
"Mohammed is the preface to the book of the universe:  
<span class="margnote">420</span> All the world are slaves and he is the
Master."  
From the wine of Love spring many qualities:  
Amongst the attributes of Love is blind devotion.  
The saint of Bistám, who in devotion was unique,  
Abstained from eating a water-melon. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md)  
<span class="margnote">425</span> Be a lover constant in devotion to thy
beloved,  
That thou mayst cast thy noose and capture God.  
Sojourn for a while on the Hirá of the heart, <span
id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44.md)

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

Abandon self and flee to God.  
Strengthened by God, return to thy self  
And break the heads of the Lát and Uzzá of sensuality. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md) <span class="margnote">430</span>  
By the might of Love evoke an army,  
Reveal thyself on the Fárán of Love, <span
id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46.md)  
That the Lord of the Ka‘ba may show thee favour  
And interpret to thee the text, "Lo, I will appoint a vicegerent on the
earth." <span id="fr_47"></span>[3](#fn_47.md)
