### IV

*Showing that the Self is weakened by asking*.

<span class="margnote">435</span> <span class="smallcaps">O thou</span>
who hast gathered taxes from lions,  
Thy need hath caused thee to become a fox in disposition.  
Thy maladies are the result of indigence:  
This disease is the source of thy pain.  
It is robbing thine high thoughts of their dignity  
<span class="margnote">440</span> And putting out the light of thy noble
imagination.  
Quaff rosy wine from the jar of existence!

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

Snatch thy money from the purse of Time!  
Like Omar, come down from thy camel! <span
id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md)  
Beware of incurring obligations, beware!  
How long wilt thou sue for office <span class="margnote">445</span>  
And ride like children on a woman's back?  
A nature that fixes its gaze on the sky  
Becomes debased by receiving benefits.  
By asking, poverty is made more abject;  
By begging, the beggar is made poorer. <span
class="margnote">450</span>  
Asking disintegrates the Self  
And deprives of illumination the Sinai-bush of the Self.  
Do not scatter thy handful of dust;  
Like the moon, scrape food from thine own side!  
Albeit thou art poor and wretched <span class="margnote">455</span>

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

And overwhelmed by affliction,  
Seek not thy daily bread from the bounty of another,  
Seek not waves of water from the fountain of the sun,  
Lest thou be put to shame before the Prophet  
<span class="margnote">460</span> On the Day when every soul shall be
stricken with fear.  
The moon gets sustenance from the table of the sun  
And bears the brand of his bounty on her heart.  
Pray God for courage! Wrestle with Fortune!  
Do not sully the honour of the pure religion!  
<span class="margnote">465</span> He who swept the rubbish of idols out
of the Ka‘ba  
Said that God loves a man that earns his living.  
Woe to him that accepts bounty from another's table

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

And lets his neck be bent with benefits!  
He hath consumed himself with the lightning of the favours bestowed on
him,  
He hath sold his honour for a paltry coin. <span
class="margnote">470</span>  
Happy the man who thirsting in the sun  
Does not crave of Khizr a cup of water! <span
id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md)  
His brow is not moist with the shame of beggary;  
He is a man still, not a piece of clay.  
That noble youth walks under heaven <span class="margnote">475</span>  
With his head erect like the pine.  
Are his hands empty? The more is he master of himself.  
Do his fortunes languish? The more alert is he.  
The beggar's wallet is like a boat tossing in waves of fire;

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

Sweet is a little dew gathered by <span class="margnote">480</span>
one's own hand.  
Be a man of honour, and like the bubble  
Keep thy cup inverted even in the midst of the sea! <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_48"></span>[39:1](iq07.htm#fr_48.md) The Caliph Omar was a man
of simple habits and self-reliant character.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[41:1](iq07.htm#fr_49.md) Khizr is supposed to have
drunk of the Fountain of Life.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[42:1](iq07.htm#fr_50.md) The bubble is compared to
an inverted cup, which of course receives nothing.
