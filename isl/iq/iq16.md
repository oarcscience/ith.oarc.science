*Story of the diamond and the coal*.

<span class="smallcaps">Now</span> I will open one more gate of Truth,  
I will tell thee another tale.  
The coal in the mine said to the diamond,  
"O thou entrusted with splendours everlasting,  
<span class="margnote">1195</span> We are comrades, and our being is
one;  
The source of our existence is the same,  
Yet while I die here in the anguish of worthlessness,  
Thou art set on the crowns of emperors.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

My stuff is so vile that I am valued less than earth,  
Whereas the mirror's heart is rent by thy beauty. <span
class="margnote">1200</span>  
My darkness illumines the chafing-dish,  
Then my substance is incinerated at last.  
Every one puts the sole of his foot on my head  
And covers my stock of existence with ashes.  
My fate must needs be deplored; <span class="margnote">1205</span>  
Dost thou know what is the gist of my being?  
Thou art a condensed wavelet of smoke,  
Endowed with the properties of a single spark;  
Both in feature and nature thou art star-like,  
Splendours rise from every side of thee. <span
class="margnote">1210</span>  
Now thou becom’st the light of a monarch's eye,

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

Now thou adornest the haft of a dagger."  
"O sagacious friend!" said the diamond,  
Dark earth, when hardened, becomes in dignity as a bezel.  
<span class="margnote">1215</span> Having been at strife with its
environment,  
It is ripened by the struggle and grows hard like a stone.  
’Tis this ripeness that has endowed my form with light  
And filled my bosom with radiance.  
Because thy being is immature, thou hast become abased;  
<span class="margnote">1220</span> Because thy body is soft, thou art
burnt.  
Be void of fear, grief, and anxiety;  
Be hard as a stone, be a diamond!  
Whosoever strives hard and grips tight,  
The two worlds are illumined by him.  
<span class="margnote">1225</span> A little earth is the origin of the
Black Stone

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

Which puts forth its head in the Ka‘ba:  
Its rank is higher than Sinai,  
It is kissed by the swarthy and the fair.  
In solidity consists the glory of Life;  
Weakness is worthlessness and immaturity." <span
class="margnote">1230</span>
