*Setting forth the inner meanings of the names of Ali*.

<span class="smallcaps">Ali</span> is the first Moslem and the King of
men, <span class="margnote">965</span>  
In Love's eyes Ali is the treasure of the Faith.  
Devotion to his family inspires me with life  
So that I am as a shining pearl.  
Like the narcissus, I am enraptured with gazing;  
Like perfume, I am straying through his pleasure-garden. <span
class="margnote">970</span>  
If holy water gushes from my earth, he is the source;

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

If wine pours from my grapes, he is the cause.  
I am dust, but his sun hath made me as a mirror:  
Song can be seen in my breast.  
<span class="margnote">975</span> From Ali's face the Prophet drew a
fair omen,  
By his majesty the true religion is glorified.  
His commandments are the strength of Islam:  
All things pay allegiance to his House.  
The Apostle of God gave him the name Bú Turáb;  
<span class="margnote">980</span> God in the Koran called him "the Hand
of Allah."  
Every one that is acquainted with Life's mysteries  
Knows what is the inner meaning of the names of Ali.  
The dark clay, whose name is the body—  
Our reason is ever bemoaning its iniquity.

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

On account of it our sky-reaching thought plods o’er the earth; <span
class="margnote">985</span>  
It makes our eyes blind and our ears deaf.  
It hath in its hand a two-edged sword of lust:  
Travellers’ hearts are broken by this brigand.  
Ali, the Lion of God, subdued the body's clay  
And transmuted this dark earth to gold. <span
class="margnote">990</span>  
Murtazá, by whose sword the splendour of Truth was revealed,  
Is named Bú Turáb from his conquest of the body. <span
id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md)  
Man wins territory by prowess in battle,  
But his brightest jewel is mastery of himself. <span
class="margnote">995</span>  
Whosoever in the world becomes a Bú Turáb  
Turns back the sun from the west; <span id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_76.md)

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

Whosoever saddles tightly the steed of the body  
Sits like the bezel on the seal of sovereignty:  
Here the might of Khaibar is under his feet, <span
id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_77.md)  
And hereafter his hand will distribute  
<span class="margnote">1000</span> the water of Kauthar. <span
id="fr_78"></span>[2](#fn_78.md)  
Through self-knowledge he acts as God's Hand,  
And in virtue of being God's Hand he reigns over all.  
His person is the gate of the city of the sciences:  
Arabia, China, and Greece are subject to him.  
<span class="margnote">1005</span> If thou wouldst drink clear wine from
thine own grapes,  
Thou must needs wield authority over thine own earth.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

To become earth is the creed of a moth;  
Be a conqueror of earth; that alone is worthy of a man.  
Thou art soft as a rose. Become hard as a stone,  
That thou mayst be the foundation of the wall of the garden! <span
class="margnote">1010</span>  
Build thy clay into a Man,  
Build thy Man into a World!  
If thou art unfit to be either a wall or a door,  
Some one else will make bricks of thine earth.  
O thou who complainest of the cruelty of Heaven, <span
class="margnote">1015</span>  
Thou whose glass cries out against the injustice of the stone,  
How long this wailing and crying and lamentation?  
How long this perpetual beating of thy breast?  
The pith of Life is contained in action,  
To delight in creation is the law of Life. <span
class="margnote">1020</span>

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

Arise and create a new world!  
Wrap thyself in flames, be an Abraham! <span
id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md)  
To comply with this ill-starred world  
Is to fling away thy buckler on the field of battle.  
<span class="margnote">1025</span> The man of strong character who is
master of himself  
Will find Fortune complaisant.  
If the world does not comply with his humour,  
He will try the hazard of war with Heaven;  
He will dig up the foundations of the universe  
<span class="margnote">1030</span> And cast its atoms into a new
mould.  
He will subvert the course of Time  
And wreck the azure firmament.  
By his own strength he will produce  
A new world which will do his pleasure.  
If one cannot live in the world as  
<span class="margnote">1035</span> beseems a man,

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

It is true life to give up one's soul.  
He that hath sound intelligence  
Will prove his strength by great enterprises.  
’Tis sweet to use love in hard tasks  
And, like Abraham, to gather roses from flames. <span
id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md) <span class="margnote">1040</span>  
The potentialities of men of action  
Are displayed in willing acceptance of what is difficult.  
Mean spirits have no weapon but spite,  
This is their one rule of life.  
But Life is power made manifest, <span class="margnote">1043</span>  
And its mainspring is the desire for victory.  
Mercy out of season is a coldness of Life's blood,  
A break in the rhythm of Life's music.  
Whoever is sunk in the depths of ignominy  
Calls his weakness contentment. <span class="margnote">1050</span>

'

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

Weakness is the plunderer of Life,  
Its womb is teeming with fears and lies.  
Its soul is empty of virtues,  
Its milk is a fattening for vices.  
<span class="margnote">1055</span> O man of sound judgement, beware!  
This spoiler is lurking in ambush.  
Be not his dupe, if thou art wise:  
Chameleon-like, he changes colour every moment.  
Even by keen observers his form is not discerned:  
<span class="margnote">1060</span> Veils are thrown over his face.  
Now he is muffled in pity and gentleness,  
Now he wears the cloak of humility.  
Sometimes he is disguised as a victim of oppression,  
Sometimes as one whose sins are to be excused.  
<span class="margnote">1065</span> He appears in the shape of
self-indulgence  
And robs the strong man's heart of courage.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

Strength is the twin of Truth;  
If thou knowest thyself, strength is the Truth-revealing glass.  
Life is the seed, and power the crop:  
Power explains the mystery of truth and falsehood. <span
class="margnote">1070</span>  
The false claimant, if he be possessed of power,  
Needs no argument for his claim.  
Falsehood derives from power the authority of truth,  
And by falsifying truth deems itself true.  
Its creative word transforms poison into nectar; <span
class="margnote">1075</span>  
It says to Good, "Thou art bad," and Good becomes Evil.  
O thou that art heedless of the trust committed to thee,  
Esteem thyself superior to both worlds! <span
id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md)

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

Gain knowledge of Life's mysteries!  
<span class="margnote">1080</span> Be a tyrant! Ignore all except God!  
O man of understanding, open thine eyes, ears, and lips! <span
id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82.md)  
If then thou seest not the Way of Truth, laugh at me!
