### ON AVARICE.

#### BY HATEM TAI.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

HOW frail are riches and their joys!  
Morn builds the heap which eve destroys;  
Yet can they leave one sure delight—  
The thought that we've employed them right.

What bliss can wealth afford to me,  
When life's last solemn hour I see?—  
When Mavia's sympathising sighs  
Will but augment my agonies?

Can hoarded gold dispel the gloom  
That death must shed around his tomb?  
Or cheer the ghost which hovers there,  
And fills with shrieks the desert air?

What boots it, Mavia, in the grave,  
Whether I loved to waste or save?  
The hand that millions now can grasp  
In death no more than mine shall clasp.

Were I ambitious to behold  
Increasing stores of treasured gold,  
Each tribe that roves the desert knows  
I might be wealthy, if I chose.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

But other joys can gold impart;  
Far other wishes warm my heart;—  
Ne’er may I strive to swell the heap  
Till want and woe have ceased to weep.

With brow unaltered I can see  
The hour of wealth or poverty:  
I've drunk from both the cups of Fate,  
Nor this could sink, nor that elate.

With fortune blest, I ne’er was found  
To look with scorn on those around;  
Nor for the loss of paltry ore,  
Shall Hatem seem to Hatem poor.
