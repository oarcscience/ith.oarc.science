### KING CAIS AVENGES HIS FATHER'S DEATH.

Cais, the eldest surviving son of King Zoheir, having acceded to the
supreme power, goes forth with his warriors to avenge the death of his
father. But, acting on the advice of Antar's enemies, he leaves the hero
behind. The Absians attack the tribe of Aamir, and are defeated. King
Cais then sends a letter to Antar, begging him to come to their
assistance. Meantime a fierce combat takes place between the young chief
Nazih, on the part of the Absians, and Harith the son of Zalim, a
renegade knight, on the part of the Aamirites. Just as Nazih is about to
succumb to his antagonist, a strange knight makes his appearance,
mounted on a meagre, foundered horse, and poorly armed. This Bedouin
wanderer assails Harith and takes him prisoner; then he overcomes
Jandah—who gave Zoheir his death-blow; and King Cais is the first to
recognise in the person of the uncouth champion Antar himself. The King
strikes off the head of Jandah with the assassin's own sword. After a
period of repose, the Absians again made war upon the Aamirites, who
were ultimately vanquished.
