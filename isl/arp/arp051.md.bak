### TO A FRIEND,

#### ON HIS BIRTHDAY.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

WHEN born, in tears we saw thee drowned,  
  While thine assembled friends around  
  With smiles their joy confessed:  
So live, that at thy parting hour,  
They may the flood of sorrow pour,  
  And thou in smiles be dressed.

</div>
