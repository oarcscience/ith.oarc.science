### ANTAR RESCUES HIS FATHER AND UNCLES.

Antar then learns that his father Shedad and his uncles are gone in
pursuit of a knight, called Kais, who had taken some cattle from their
tribe, and immediately mounts his horse Abjer and sets off to their
assistance. He finds his father and uncles tied ignominiously across
their horses, prisoners of Kais, at which he roared, "Ye dastards!—come
forth!" and Kais no sooner heard the challenge than he pricked on his
horse till he came up to Antar, and thus addressed him:

<span class="smallcaps">I am</span> renowned in every nation for the
thrust of the spear and the blow of the sword.

I am the destroyer of horsemen with the lance, when the spears are
interwoven under the dust.

How many contests have I waged on the day of battle, whose terrors would
turn gray the heads of infants!

Long ago have I drunk the blood of horsemen, with which they fed me
before I was weaned. This day will I prove my words when the blood
streams from my sword.

This foul wretch will I slay with the edge of my sword, that cleaves
through the flesh before the bones.

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

His dwellings shall this eve be found waste and desolate, and I will not
swerve from my word: his body shall lie on the deserts, cut down, and
his face thou mayst see grovelling in the dust.

To these insolent verses Antar replied, saying, "Silence!—may thy mother
bewail thee":—

<span class="smallcaps">Verily</span>, thy spirit has urged thee to
abuse me, and thou hast spoken the words of a vile dastard:

Thou art ignorant of my exploits in every battle, from the land of Irak
to the sacred shrine:

Thou shalt have no time to reply—no justice but the sword; for ignorance
among mankind conducts them to their death.

This is the scene of conflict, and in it doubtless will be proved the
skill of the coward and the base-born.

Let him repent who has only shown his vanity; and let him prefer flight
to resistance.

I am Antar; and my name is far spread for the thrust of my spear and the
blow of my sword.

Having thus exclaimed, Antar "drew forth his sword and struck Kais
between the eyes, and split his helmet and wadding, and his sword worked
down to his thighs, down even to the back of his horse: and he cried
out—'Thou wretch! I will not be controlled! I am still the lover of
Abla!'" He then rushed among the tribe of Dibgan, who fled in dismay,
leaving all their plunder behind.
