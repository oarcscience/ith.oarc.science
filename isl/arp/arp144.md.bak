###### EXTRACTS FROM

## THE LAY OF THE HIMYARITES,

###### BY THE

### KADHI NESHWAN IBN SA’ID, EL-HIMYARY.

###### TRANSLATED AND EDITED

#### <span class="smallcaps">BY Major W. F. Prideaux, F.R.G.S., &c.</span>

\["<span class="smallcaps">Ptolemy</span> mentions the Homerites as a
nation seated in the southern parts of Arabia Felix, and bounded on the
east by the Adramitæ, or province of Hadramaut. His Arabiæ Emporium he
likewise places in their country, as Pliny does his Massala. Some
authors make them the same people with the Sabæans, whilst others
consider them in a different light. For our part, we look upon Sabæi and
Homeritæ to have been different names of the same nation, and are
countenanced herein by the Oriental historians. For these inform us that
the Sabæans were called Hamyarites from Hamyar the son of their great
ancestor Saba; and that they ruled over almost the whole country of
Yaman. Though the kingdom of the Hamyarites, or Homerites, was at length

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

translated from the princes of Hamyar to the descendants of Cahlan his
brother, yet they all retained the title of King of Hamyar. . . . They
made a great figure amongst the ancient Arabs before the time of
Mohammed."—*Ancient Universal History*, vol. xviii. p, 352.

<span class="smallcaps">Major W. F. Prideaux</span> has employed some of
the few leisure hours afforded by his official duties at Sehore, Central
India, in rendering into English the excellent didactic Poem, the "Lay
of the Himyarites," composed in the 12th century <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>, by Neshwân ibn Sa’îd. His work—printed,
for private circulation, at the School Press of Sehore, in 1879, and the
impression limited to 25 copies—presents the original text together with
the prose translation; also Notes, giving the more important variants
found in the texts previously published, and collated with the Miles and
Rich MSS. in the British Museum; to which is added a series of
genealogical tables, "designed to exhibit, at one comprehensive glance,
the various degrees of relationship in which the chiefs and heroes who
are commemorated in the Poem stood to one another."

The "Lay of the Himyarites" is chiefly valuable, as Major Prideaux
remarks, for the light it throws upon the ancient history of that
nation. The opening and closing verses, which are here reproduced, with
the translator's kind permission, will perhaps enable the general reader
to form a tolerably clear notion of the design and character of this
fine Poem, written by a learned and pious descendant of the renowned
princes of Himyar.—<span class="smallcaps">Ed</span>.\]
