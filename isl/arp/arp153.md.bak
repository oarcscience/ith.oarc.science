### THE POEM OF TARAFA.

v\. 6. The Bedouins feed their camels with the leaves of the erak-tree.

vv. 8, 9. Lane, n his "Modern Egyptians," describing the composition of
the black powder, called *kohl*, with which ladies of Cairo paint the
edge of their eyelids, both above and below the eye, mentions the powder
of various kinds of lead-ore (*kohl el-hagar*) as being employed for
this purpose. He also states that "some women, to make their teeth
glisten, tattoo their lips." It would appear from these verses that the
Arab women in like manner employed a preparation of lead-ore in order to
render their teeth more sparkling by contrast with their "dark-coloured
bases."

v\. 30. El-Yemen was famous for the production of red leather.

v\. 41. This verse resembles a couplet in the song of Beshâmeh son of
Hazn of Nahshal, thus rendered by Mr Lyall in his "Songs from the
*Hamâseh* and *Aghânî:*"

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If there should be among a thousand but one of us,  
   and men should call—"Ho! a knight!" he would think that they meant
him.

</div>

vv. 41-48.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

’Tis mine, whene’er the tribes to glory call,  
In deeds of daring to outstrip them all.  
High waves the lash above my camel's head;  
Though sultry vapours o’er the mountains spread,  
Onward she rushes, and her flowing tail  
Floats, like the dancer's garment, on the gale.  
Me you will find, or at the council board,  
Or where the taverns maddening draughts afford:  
Come in the morning, and I'll give a bowl  
Shall warm the prudence of thy chilly soul.  
Come to the council of our tribe, and see  
Its brightest honours showered down on me:  
But, above all, come join the merry ring  
Where gay youths laugh and blooming maidens sing.—*RṚ.*

</div>

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

vv. 48-51. The singing-girls who sang at the drinking-parties of the
ancient Arabs were Greeks, Syrians, or Persians. Until after El-Islâm
the Arabs, though masters of rhythm and metre, had no indigenous system
of singing except the rude song (originally of the camel-driver) called
*rajez*. These girls probably sang for the most part in their own
tongue, and played the music which they had learned in Persian ’Irâk or
Syria; but in the life of En-Nâbigha of Dubyân, as given in the *Aghânî*
(ix. 164), a singing girl of Yethrib (afterwards El-Madîna) is
mentioned, who sang one of that poet's pieces in Arabic, and so enabled
him to detect a fault of prosody.—*Lyall:* Notes on vv. 60, 61, Lebīd's
Mo‘all.

v\. 49. In Lane's "Modern Egyptians," Ed. 1860, p. 378, is an
illustration of two Ghawázee, or public dancing-girls of Cairo, in which
the costume exactly corresponds with Tarafa's description of the
singing-girls’ vests.

v\. 56. This sentiment of the old Arab poet finds a parallel in the
following verse, from the Persian of Omar Khayyam:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

                  What boots it to repeat  
How time is slipping underneath our feet?  
Unborn To-Morrow, and dead Yesterday—  
Why fret about them if To-Day be sweet?

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Poets of all
ages," remarks Nott, in his "Select Odes of Hafiz," "and particularly
those who were voluptuaries, urge the advice of making the best use of
the present moment. The *carpe diem* of Horace is a frequently-quoted
maxim."

In a very different strain does a modern English poet endeavour to
inculcate the lesson of life:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Know’st thou *Yesterday*, its aim and reason?  
  Work’st thou well *To-Day* for worthy things?  
Then calmly wait the *Morrow's* hidden season,  
  And fear not thou what hap soe’er it brings.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The great
American, Longfellow, too, in one of his beautiful prose-poems: "Look
not mournfully into the Past: it comes not back

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

again. Wisely improve the Present: it is thine. Go boldly forth into the
shadowy Future, without fear, and with a manly heart."

v\. 58. The Arabs, like the Greeks and the Romans, commonly drank their
wine diluted with water; and only on extraordinary occasions drank the
lighter kinds pure, and the more heavy wines mixed with a very little
water. (See Mo‘all. of Amru, v. 2. and *Note*.)

vv. 62-68.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If Death be near me, let me quaff the bowl,  
That none to-morrow mourn a thirsty soul.  
The same dark mansions, by an equal fate,  
The noble spirit and the mean await;  
Their mother-Earth impartial seals their doom,  
And one broad stone protects their common tomb.  
Death, the all-conquering, seizes on the bold,  
His proudest prey—then claims the miser's gold.  
Though short my life, I've seen the age of man  
Dwindling, still dwindling, in its narrow span  
The camel-riders, when they loose the rein,  
With firmer grasp the slackened cord retain:  
So, though he spare them for a little space,  
Death holds dominion over all our race.  
Let me then quaff the goblets while I live,  
Nor die unconscious of the joys they give. —*Ret. Rev.*

</div>

vv. 64, 65. Thus Horace, in his well-known ode (Sir Theodore Martin's
translation):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It recks not whether thou  
Be opulent and trace  
Thy birth from Kings, or bear upon thy brow  
Stamp of a beggar's race:  
In rags or splendour, Death at thee alike,  
That no compassion hath for aught of earth, will strike.

</div>

And our English poet Young:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

What though we wade in wealth or soar in fame?  
Earth's highest station ends in "Here he lies!"  
And "dust to dust" concludes the noblest song.

</div>

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And the Persian
Sa‘dī: "When the pure and spotless soul is about to depart, of what
importance is it whether we expire upon a throne or upon the bare
ground?"
