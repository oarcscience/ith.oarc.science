### THE POEM OF AMRU.

v\. 1. "Our morning draught:" see note on v. 74, Amriolkais—"A cheerful
cup of wine in the morning," says Nott, "was a favourite indulgence with
the more luxurious Persians. And it was not uncommon among the Easterns,
to salute a friend by saying: 'May your morning potation be agreeable to
you!'" Thus Hafiz (Nott's translation):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    While the soft lyre and cymbals sound,  
    Pour cheerful melody around;  
Quaff thy enlivening *draught of morning wine;*  
    And as the melting notes inspire  
    Thy soul with amorous desire,  
Kiss thy fair handmaid, kiss her neck divine.

</div>

v\. 2. "Wine diluted with water:" see note on v. 58, Tarafa's Mo‘all.—In
the Romance of Antar, the hero is represented as exclaiming:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give me *pure* wine to drink, or let it be *mixed;*  
Give it me *old*, that I may imagine it was made before the world:  
Give me to drink, and let me hear the song that delights me!

</div>

Amru, in v. 1, and Lebīd, v. 59, also refer to the Arab custom of
hoarding the best wines.—Hafiz, in one of his odes, calls for a draught
of *pure* or unmixed wine: *mi nab*, wine not diluted with water.

vv. 1-4.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Wake, damsel! wake! and bring yon generous wine,  
The joyous soul of Enderina's vine;  
Fill, fill the crimson goblet to the brim,  
Till the wine totters o’er the circling rim: <span id="page_397">p.
397</span>  
Cheered by its smiles, the youth forgets his care,  
His fair one's coldness, and his own despair:  
Cheered by its smiles the doting miser rests  
From the fond worship of his well-filled chests.—*Ret. Rev.*

</div>

v\. 17. It must not be supposed that the poet's special reference to the
well-developed haunches of his fair one in this verse tends to confirm
the notion still generally entertained by Europeans that the Orientals
like large, fat women—a notion utterly erroneous. (See Lane's
translation of "The Thousand and One Nights," Ed. 1859, vol. i, p. 25,
note 19.) It is true that Arabian and other Eastern poets often mention
in terms of admiration the "large and wide hips" of the maidens whose
charms they celebrate; for example, in the poetry of the Romance of
Antar contained in the present volume: p. 229, l. 3; p. 292, l. 1; p.
293, l. 6;—but their slender waists are also invariably praised, as in
this same verse of Amru. And in the following couplet, cited in the
*Anvári Suhaili* of Husain Vā‘iz (a modern Persian version of the Hindoo
*Fables of Vishnusarman*, better known to general readers as the *Fables
of Bidpai*, or Pilpay, the original of the [Arabian](errata.htm#3)
*Kalilah wa Damnah*) the large haunches and slender waist of a maiden
are described by an amusing play upon words:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

How shall I describe her hips and her waist?  
Who has seen a mountain (*Kūh*) suspended by a straw (KIM)?

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is slender
women only who are celebrated in Arabic poetry. The hero-poet Antar
describes his beloved Abla as being "delicately formed"—"like the branch
of the tamarisk"; while the palm-tree, the cypress, and the
well-proportioned spear are common similitudes in Eastern poetry for the
gracefully slender form of a beautiful woman.

v\. 26. Mr Lyall, in a note on one of his translations of Songs from the
*Hamāseh* and the *Agāhnī* (published in the Bengal Asiatic Society's
*Journal*), thus renders the couplet:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Many the Days are ours, long blazed with glory,  
  when we withstood the King and would not serve him.

</div>

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Days" (*Ayyām*),
he explains, is the word used in Arab legend for battles: one says, "the
Day of el-Kuālb," "the Day of Shi‘b Jebeleh," &c., although the fight
may (as it did at el-Kulāb) have lasted longer than one day. (See note
on vv. 25, 26, Hareth's Mo‘all.)

vv. 31, 32. In a note on v. 31 of Zohair's Mo‘all., Mr Lyall gives these
couplets of Amru as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When our war-mill is set against a people,  
  As grain they fall thereunder ground to powder;  
Eastward in Nejd is set the skin beneath it,  
  And the grain cast therein is all Qudâ‘ah;

</div>

and he explains that *thifâl* (rendered "cloth" by Sir W. Jones) is the
mat of skin that is placed beneath the mill to receive the flour.—In the
introductory part of the Romance of Antar, King Jazīmah (the father of
King Zoheir, the hero's friend) thus threatens a hostile tribe: "I shall
command these warriors, numerous as locusts, to assault you, and to
*grind you like grain*." Akin to this comparison of War to a mill is the
similitude in 2 Kings, xiii., 7: "The King of Syria had destroyed them,
and had made them like the dust by threshing." (See Poem of Zohair, v.
31, and *Note*.)

v\. 40. "Our javelins exquisitely wrought of Khathaian reeds," *i.e.*
lances of Khatt: see note on v. 50, Lebeid's Mo‘all.

v\. 45. The syringa-flower.—The tree of Judas, on which the arch-traitor
hung himself after betraying his Master: the tree in consequence is said
to have wept blood, with which its blossoms still remain deeply
dyed.—*Nott:* Odes of Hafiz.—In the Romance of Antar, warriors whose
armour is stained with blood are frequently compared to the flowers of
the Judas-tree; and the hero himself describes cups of wine as mantling
like the Judas-flower. It is the *Cercis Siliquastrum* of botanists,
according to Hamilton, "the flowers of which are of a very bright purple
colour, coming out from the branches and stem on every side in large
clusters and on short peduncles."

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

v\. 66. Colaib Ebn Rabiah governed the Bani Maad (the Saraceni Maadeni
of Procopius), and was so proud that he would not suffer any one to hunt
in his neighbourhood, nor any camels to be watered with his, nor any
fire to be lighted near that which he himself used. He was at last slain
by one Jassas, for shooting a camel, named Sarab, that he found grazing
on a prohibited spot of ground. This camel belonged to an Arab, who had
been entertained by Basus, a near relation of Jassas. The murder of
Colaib Ebn Rebiah occasioned a forty years’ war \[see Argument prefixed
to the Poem of Amru, page [65](arp020.htm#page_65)\], whence came the
Arab proverbs: "a worse omen than Sarab;" "more ominous than Basus."—It
may not be improper here to observe that the kings and chiefs of the
Arabs generally forbade others to bring their flocks upon those places
and pastures which they chose for themselves. In order to ascertain the
limits of these pastures, when they came to a fruitful valley or plain,
they caused a dog to bark, and the whole extent of ground over which he
could be heard they appropriated to themselves.—*Ancient Universal
History*, vol. xviii., p. \[440\].

v\. 97. "They walk with graceful motions, and wave their bodies," &c.
The gait of Arab women is very remarkable: they incline the lower part
of the body from side to side as they step, and with hands raised to the
level of the bosom they hold the edges of their outer covering. Their
pace is slow, and they look not about them, but keep their eyes towards
the ground in the direction to which they are going.—*Lane:* Thousand
and One Nights: *Notes*.

vv. 92-100. The following passage, from Richardson's "Dissertation on
the Languages, Literature, and Manners of Eastern Nations," will serve
as an interesting commentary on these verses: "The military ideas which
prevailed in old Arabia seem to have been peculiarly calculated to
promote a romantic attention to the fair sex. A long cessation of
hostilities was painful to the Arabs: their arms were often turned
against the neighbouring countries, and caravans of travellers; but
oftener against each other. Captives and plunder were the chief objects;

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

and the women were considered as most valuable spoils. To protect them
became in consequence a great point of honour. Those predal wars, in
whatever light we may view them, were considered as highly honourable in
Arabia, and no man was thought in any way accomplished, who could not
boast, in them, some feat of arms. Their expeditions were in general
short. If they found the enemy too powerful, they retired; if
unprepared, they suprised them; if of equal or inferior force, they
attacked them: and one battle was for the most part decisive. A young
warrior returning after a short absence, and laying his laurels, his
captives, and his spoils at the feet of his mistress, would in general
woo with success: and he whose gallant intrepidity had saved his tribe
from rapine and captivity would ever be a favourite of the fair. When
the flower of any tribe were absent upon a distant enterprise, some
hostile neighbours would often attack those they had left behind: and
hence perhaps arose the custom of the Arabian women, even of the highest
rank, attending their husbands, fathers, and brothers in their military
expeditions; and of fighting often with a degree of heroism not inferior
to the fabled achievements of the ancient Amazons."

vv. 103-108.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ours is the world, and all its riches ours;  
None dares resist us ’midst Arabia's powers;  
None dares control—if any vainly try  
To chain our freedom, from the yoke we fly:  
None dares rebuke our valour as unjust,  
Else the rash slanderer should repent in dust;  
One chief we own, and when that chieftain's son  
Swears to maintain the name his sire has won,  
In such frank fealty as becomes the free,  
We bend, and make the nations bend the knee.  
Still will we pour our warriors o’er the plain,  
And still our ships shall rule the boundless main.  
                                                                         *Ret.
Rev.*

</div>

The concluding verses of Amru's oration in praise of his tribe furnish a
fair specimen of the unbounded boasting in which the

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

old Arabs were fond of indulging on such occasions as that which gave
rise to this Poem and the following one, in which the venerable poetical
champion of the tribe of Bekr answers the vain Taglebite.
