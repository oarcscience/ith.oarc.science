### ANTAR PROCLAIMED CHAMPION OF ABS.

At length the hero is duly admitted by the Absian warriors to the honour
and rank of an Arab. King Zoheir causes a great feast to be prepared to
celebrate the overthrow of the Teyans, at which he presents Antar with a
robe worked with gold, girds on him a trusty sword, and placing in his
hand a pike of Khata, and mounting him on a fine Arab horse, proclaims
him the champion of Abs and Adnan. And thus, apparently, was removed the
chief obstacle to Antar's union with Abla; moreover, the maiden's father
had solemnly sworn that she should be married to the hero if he rescued
her from the Teyans. But the treacherous Malik never meant to keep his
word; although, the King favouring Antar's cause, he had no choice but
to profess his willingness to bestow his daughter on the saviour of the
tribe. Old Malik, however, was a perfect master of craft and cozenage;
and he devised a plan of exposing Antar to almost certain death. He
requires him to procure for Abla's dowry a thousand Asafeer camels—the
property of Monzar the son of Massema, king of the Arabs, and lieutenant
of Nushirvan of Persia: if Antar once venture among the tribe of Shiban,
Malik confidently assures his complotters, he will never return to
trouble them again. For such a prize as Abla, however, Antar would
willingly encounter even greater dangers, and therefore he undertakes
the desperate enterprise with alacrity.
