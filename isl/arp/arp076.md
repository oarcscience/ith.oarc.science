#### TO A LADY,

##### WHO ACCUSED HER LOVER OF FLATTERY.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

O, Abla, no—when Selim tells  
Of many an unknown grace that dwells  
    In Abla's face and mien;  
When he describes the sense refined  
That lights thine eye, and fills thy mind,  
    By thee alone unseen,—

’Tis not that, drunk with Love, he sees  
Ideal charms which only please  
    Through Passion's partial veil;  
’Tis not that Flattery's glozing tongue  
Hath basely framed an idle song,  
    But Truth that breathed the tale.

Thine eyes unaided ne’er could trace  
Each opening charm, each varied grace,  
    That round thy person plays:  
Some must remain concealed from thee,  
For Selim's watchful eye to see,  
    For Selim's tongue to praise.

One polished mirror can declare  
That eye so bright, that face so fair,  
    That cheek which shames the rose;.  
But how thy mantle waves behind,  
How float thy tresses on the wind,  
    Another only shows.

</div>
