### THE POEM OF ANTARA.

<span id="img_05400"></span> ![H](img/05400.jpg.md)HAVE the bards who
preceded me left any theme unsung? *What, therefore, shall be my
subject? Love only must supply my lay*. Dost thou then recollect, after
long consideration, the mansion of thy beloved?

2\. O bower of Abla, in the valley of Jiwaa, give me tidings of my love!
O bower of Abla, may the morning rise on thee with prosperity and
health!

3\. There I stopped my camel, large as a tower, the anguish of my
passion having delayed the accomplishment of my bold enterprise,

4\. Whilst Abla was dwelling in Jiwaa, and our tribe *were stationed* in
Hazn, and Samaan, and Motathallem.

5\. Hail, dear ruins! with whose possessors I had old engagements; more
dreary and more desolate *are you become*, after the departure *of my
beloved* Omm Alheitham!

6\. She dwells in the land of my foes, like roaring lions: oh, how
painful has been my search after thee, fair daughter of Makhrem!

7\. I felt myself attached to her at our first interview, although I had
slain her countrymen in battle: I assure thee, by the life of thy
father, that of my attachment there can be no doubt.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

8\. *Thou hast possessed thyself of my heart;* thou hast fixed thy abode
in it (imagine not that I delude thee), and art settled there as a
beloved and cherished inhabitant.

9\. Yet how can I visit *my fair one*, whilst her family have their
vernal mansion in Oneizatain, and mine are stationed in Ghailem?

10\. Surely thou hast firmly resolved to depart from me, since the
camels of thy tribe are bridled even in so dark a night.

11\. Nothing so much alarms me *with a signal of her destined removal*
as my seeing the camels of burden, which belong to her tribe, grazing on
khimkhim-berries in the midst of their tents:

12\. Among them *are* forty-two milch-camels, dark as the plumes of a
coal-black raven.

13\. Then, Antara, she pierced thee to the heart with her well-pointed
teeth exquisitely white, the kiss of which is delicious, and the taste
ravishingly sweet!

14\. From the mouth of this lovely damsel, when you kiss her lips,
proceeds the fragrance of musk, as from the vase of a perfumer;

15\. Or like the scent of a blooming bower, whose plants the gentle
rains have kept in continual verdure, which no filth has sullied, and to
which there has been no resort:

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

16\. Every morning-cloud, clear of hail, has drenched it with a
plentiful shower, and has left all the little cavities in the earth both
round and bright as coins of silver:

17\. Profusely and copiously it descends; and every evening the stream,
which nothing intercepts, gushes rapidly through it.

18\. The flies remain in it with incessant buzzing, and their murmurs
are like the song of a man exhilarated with wine:

19\. Their sound, when they strike their slender legs against each
other, is like the sound of a flint, from which the sparks are forced by
a man with one arm, intent upon his labour.

20\. While thou, *fair* Abla, reclinest both evening and morning on the
lap of a soft couch, I pāss whole nights on the back of a dark-coloured
horse well caparisoned:

21\. My only cushion is the saddle of a charger with firm thick feet,
strong-sided, and large in the place of his girths.

22\. Shall a camel of Shaden bear me to thy tent, *a camel*, far removed
from her country, destitute of milk, and separated from the herd?

23\. She waves her tail in her playful mood, and proudly moves her body
from side to side, even at the end of her nightly excursion: she strikes
the hills with her quickly-moving and firmly-trampling hoofs.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

24\. Thus the bird without ears, between whose feet there is but a small
space, *the swift ostrich* beats the ground in his evening course.

25\. The young ostriches gather themselves around him, as a multitude of
black Yemenian camels assemble round their Abyssinian *herdman*, who is
unable to express himself *in the language of Arabia*.

26\. They follow him, guided by the loftiness of his head, which
resembles the carriage of travelling damsels, raised on high, and
covered like a tent.

27\. His head, *though lofty*, is small: when he is going to visit the
eggs, *which his female left* in Dhulasheira, he looks like an Ethiop
with short ears in a trailing garment of furred hides.

28\. *My camel* drinks the water of Dehradhain, but starts aside with
disdain from the *hostile* rivulets of Dailem.

29\. She turns her right side, as if she were in fear of some
large-headed screamer of the night,—

30\. Of a hideous wild-cat fixed to her body, who, as often as she bent
herself towards him in her wrath, assailed her with his claws and his
teeth.

31\. I continue all day on the well-cemented tower of her back, strongly
raised, and firm as the pillars of him who pitches a tent.

32\. *When she rests*, she crouches on the soft bank of Ridaa, and
groans through fatigue, like the soft sounding reed, which she presses
with her weight.

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

33\. *Her sweat* resembles thick rob or tenacious pitch, which the
kindled fire causes to bubble in the sides of a caldron;

34\. It gushes from behind her ears, when she boils with rage, exults in
her strength, and struts in her pride, like the stallion of her herd,
when his rivals assail him.

35\. O Abla, although thou droppest thy veil before me, yet know, that
by my agility I have made captive many a knight clad in complete armour.

36\. Bestow on me the commendation which thou knowest to be due; since
my nature is gentle and mild, when my rights are not invaded;

37\. But, when I am injured, my resentment is firm, and bitter as
coloquinteda to the taste of the aggressor.

38\. I quaff; when the noontide heat is abated, old wine, purchased with
bright and well-stamped coin;

39\. I quaff it in a goblet of yellow glass variegated with white
streaks, whose companion is a glittering flagon, well secured by its lid
from the blasts of the north:

40\. When I drink it, my wealth is dissipated, but my fame remains
abundant and unimpaired;

41\. And when I return to sobriety, the dew of my liberality continues
as fresh as before: give due honour, therefore, to those qualities which
thou knowest me to possess.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

42\. Many a consort of a fair one, whose beauty required no ornaments,
have I left prostrate on the ground; and the life-blood has run sounding
from his veins, opened by my javelin, like the mouth of a camel with a
divided lip:

43\. With a nimble and double-handed stroke, I prevented his attack; and
the stream that gushed from the penetrating wound bore the colour of
anemones.

44\. Go, ask the warriors, O daughter of Malec, if thou art ignorant of
my valour, *ask them* that which thou knowest not;

45\. *Ask how* I act, when I am constantly fixed to the saddle of an
elegant horse, swimming in his course, whom my bold antagonists
alternately wound;

46\. Yet sometimes he advances alone to the conflict, and sometimes he
stands collected in a multitudinous throng of heroes with strong bows:

47\. *Ask*, and whoever has been witness to the combat will inform thee
that I am impetuous in battle, but regardless of the spoils.

48\. Many a warrior, clad in a suit of mail, at whose violent assault
the boldest men have trembled, who neither had saved himself by swift
flight nor by abject submission,

49\. Has this arm laid prone with a rapid blow from a well-straightened
javelin, firm between the knots:

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

50\. Broad were the lips of the wound; and the noise of the rushing
blood called forth the wolves, prowling in the night, and pinched with
hunger:

51\. With my swift lance did I pierce his coat of mail; and no warrior,
however brave, is secure from its point.

52\. I left him, like a sacrificed victim, to the lions of the forest,
who feasted on him between the crown of his head and his wrists.

53\. Often have I burst the interior folds of a well-wrought habergeon,
worn by a famed warrior appointed to maintain his post;

54\. Whose hands were brisk in casting lots, when winter demands such
recreation: a man censured for his disregard of wealth, and for causing
the wine-merchant to strike his flag, *by purchasing all his store*.

55\. When he saw me descend from my steed, and rush towards him, he
grinned with horror, but with no smile of joy.

56\. My engagement with him lasted the whole day, until his head and
fingers, covered with clotted gore, appeared to be stained with the
juice of idhlim.

57\. Then I fixed him with my lance; I struck him to the heart with an
Indian scimitar, the blade of which was of a bright water, and rapid was
the stroke it gave:

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

58\. A warrior, whose armour seemed to be braced on a lofty tree; a
chief, who, like a king, wore sandals of leather stained with Egyptian
thorn: a hero, without an equal.

59\. O lovely heifer! what a sweet prey was she to a hunter permitted to
chase her! To me she was wholly denied: oh, would to heaven that she had
not been forbidden me!

60\. I sent forth my handmaid, and said to her: "Go, ask tidings
inquisitively of my beloved, and bring me intelligence."

61\. She said: "I have seen the hostile guards negligent of their watch,
and the wild heifer may be smitten by any archer who desires to shoot
her."

62\. Then she turned towards me with the neck of a young roe, well
grown, of an exquisite breed among the gazals of the wood: a roe with a
milk-white face.

63\. I have been informed of a man ungrateful for my kindness; but
ingratitude turns the mind of a benefactor from any more beneficence.

64\. The instructions which my valiant uncle gave me I have diligently
observed; at the time when the lips are drawn away from the bright
teeth,

65\. In the struggle of the fight, into whose deepest gulfs the warriors
plunge themselves without complaint or murmur.

66\. When my tribe has placed me as a shield between them and the
hostile spears, I have not ignobly declined the danger, although the
place where I fixed my foot was too narrow to admit a companion.

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

67\. When I heard the din of Morra raised in the field, and the sons of
Rabeia in the thick dust;

68.\* And the shouts of Dhohol at the moment of assault, when they rush
in troops to the conflict with all their sharp-biting lions;

69\. When even the mildest of the tribes saw the skirmish under their
standards (and Death *spreads havoc* under the standard of the mildest
nation),

70\. Then I knew with certainty, that, in so fierce a contest with them,
many a heavy blow would make the perched birds of the brain fly quickly
from every skull:

71\. As soon as I beheld the legions of our enemies advancing, and
animating one another to battle, I too rushed forward, and acted without
reproach.

72\. The troops called out "Antara!" while javelins, long as the cords
of a well, were forcibly thrust against the chest of my dark steed.

73\. I ceased not to charge the foe with the neck and breast of my
horse, until he was mantled in blood.

74\. My steed, bent aside with the stroke of the lances in his forehead,
complained to me with gushing tears and tender sobbing:

75\. Had he known the art of discourse, he would have addressed me in a
plaintive strain; and had he possessed the faculty of speech, he would
have spoken to me distinctly.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

76\. In the midst of the black dust, the horses were impetuously rushing
with disfigured countenances; every robust stallion and every
strong-limbed short-haired male.

77\. Then my soul was healed, and all my anguish was dispersed by the
cry of the warriors, saying, "Well done, Antara: charge again!"

78\. My camels too are obedient to my will, as often as I desire to
kindle the ardour of my heart, and press it on to some arduous
enterprise.

79\. Yet I fear lest death should seize me before the adverse turn of
war has overtaken the two sons of Demdem:

80\. Men who attacked my reputation, when I had given them no offence,
and vowed, when I had never assailed them, to shed my blood;—

81\. Yes, they injured me: but I have left their father, like a victim,
to be mangled by the lions of the wood, and by the eagles advanced in
years.
