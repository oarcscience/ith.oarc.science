This is an anthology of 19th century Orientalist translations of Arabian
poetry, many of which are very rare, as is this particular book. Most of
the included works either predated Muhammed or were contemporary, so
there are many fascinating bits of pre-Islamic lore. Included is the
Moallakat, or the 'Hanged' Poems, a collection of seven pre-Islamic
poets whose works were once displayed (i.e. 'hanged') in the Ka'ba.
Another highlight is a synopsis of the 'Romance of Antar,' an oral saga
of a brave prince of old Arabia, and many deeds of derring-do. The one
downside here is all of the variant ways of transliterating Arabic
words, which probably will take an specialist in Arabic literature to
sort out.
