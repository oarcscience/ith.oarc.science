# ARABIAN POETRY.

##### *TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH VERSE*,

### BY J. D. CARLYLE, BḌ.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

*As the following translations were attempted at different times and
with different impressions, their execution is, no doubt, very unequal:
in general they will, I trust, be found as literal as the nature of two
languages, so little resembling each other in their structure, will
admit; in some few instances I have indulged myself in a greater
latitude, and have given rather an imitation than a version;—in such a
manner, however, I hope, as not in any place to have lost sight of the
original idea of the writer*.—From the Translator's Preface.
