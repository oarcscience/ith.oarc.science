### HOW ANTAR OBTAINED HIS HORSE ABJER.

At daybreak Antar stole out of the Prince's tent, and mounting his
horse, wandered into the desert, where he chanced to meet forty Absian
horsemen, led by Ghegadh the son of Nasshib, bent on a marauding
enterprise. Antar joins them, and the Absians proceed to the land of
Cahtan, where they saw "a great quantity of cattle, with some high
raised tents and lofty pavilions; many horses running about and camels
grazing; and the people unsuspicious of a reverse of fortune." Antar,
while his companions

were engaged in plundering the tents, drove away the cattle, and had
proceeded some distance, when he discovered a knight, "mounted on a
dark-coloured colt, beautiful and compact; and it was of a race much
prized by the Arabs: his hoofs were as flat as the beaten coin; when he
neighed he seemed as if about to speak; and his ears like quills: his
sire was Wasil, and his dam Hemama." Perceiving the beauty and speed of
the horse, Antar eagerly longed for it, and pursued the rider till
sunset, when the strange knight stopped, and Antar, coming up to him,
made overtures for the purchase of the beautiful steed. The knight,
however, would only part with it in exchange for the cattle taken from
his tribe, to which Antar very readily agreed; and thus he became
possessed of Abjer, the famous horse on which he performed so many
wonderful exploits.
