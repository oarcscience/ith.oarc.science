### MARRIAGE OF ANTAR AND ABLA.

Many more wonderful exploits were performed by Antar in opposing the
enemies of Abs—many illustrious warriors fell beneath the stroke of his
irresistible sword Dhami, before he attained the chief desire of his
heart. At length King Cais, grateful for his services, resolved that
Antar should be married to his darling Abla without further delay, and
his uncle Malik freely gave his consent. And never was there such
another glorious wedding! From the most distant lands came famous

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

knights to honour the nuptials of the renowned son of Shedad and the
beauteous daughter of Malik, and rich and rare were the presents they
brought with them. Each of these illustrious chiefs addressed verses to
Antar, in praise of his prowess, and congratulating him on his marriage.
"It was now the season of spring, and the land was enamelled with the
lustre of new-born flowers." For several days the horsemen jousted with
each other, with blunted spears. And then came the wedding night.

"Now there was a curious custom current among the Arabs at that period.
The night on which a bridegroom should wed his wife, they brought a
quantity of camel pack-saddles, and heaped them one upon the other,
decorating them with magnificent garments. Here they conducted the
bride, and having seated her on high, they said to the bridegroom: 'Come
on—now for thy bride!' And the bridegroom rushed forward to carry her
off; whilst the youths of the tribe, drawn up in line, right and left,
with staves and stones in their hands, as soon as the bridegroom dashed
forward, began beating and pelting him, and doing their utmost to
prevent his reaching his bride. If a rib or so were broken in the
affair, it was well for him; were he killed, it was his destiny. But
should he reach his bride in safety, the people quitted him, and no one
attempted to approach him."

This singular custom was, however, waived in the case of Antar, by order
of the King, who feared lest some enemy of the hero might do him a
mortal injury in the *mēlée*.

“And now, when the Arabs assembled for Antar's marriage had eaten their
dinner, the cups of wine were brought round to them. The men and the
women were promiscuously moving together; the girls came forth, and the
slave-women were amusing themselves, enjoying the happy moments. 'Hola!'
cried the matrons and the virgins, 'we will not remain covered on
Antar's marriage.' They threw aside their veils, and the full moons
appeared in all their lustre; and they flaunted the branches of their
forms in the excess of their delight; and it was a famous day for them.
'By the faith of an Arab,' said the matrons and virgins, 'we will not
remain thus concealed behind

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

these curtains—the doors shall not be shut upon us; we will see Abla in
her magnificence, and we will walk in her train, and make our offerings
to her and Antar, and we will not keep a dirhem or a dinar to ourselves;
for a happier night than this can never be, and no one but a madman
would miss it.'

“When the women of Carad heard this, they were alarmed for the scandal
and censure that would thus be occasioned: so they resolved to finish
Abla's ceremony. They clothed her in most magnificent robes and superb
necklaces; they placed the coronet of Chosroe on her head, and tiaras
round her forehead: Abla was remarkable for her beauty and loveliness:
the tire-women surrounded her, and they requested Antar to let her come
forth in state. He gave them permission, whilst his brothers and slaves
stood round the pavilion with their swords, and javelins, and weapons.
He ordered them to place a lofty throne for Abla in front of the
pavilion. They executed his commands: they lighted brilliant and scented
candles before her, and spread afar the odour of aloes and camphor, and
scattered the perfumes of ambergris and musk; the lights were fixed in
candlesticks of gold and silver—the torches blazed—and whilst the women
shouted and raised their voices to whistles and screams, Abla came forth
in state. In her hand she bore a drawn sword, whose lustre dazzled the
eyesight. All present gave a shout; whilst the malicious and ill-natured
cried: 'What a pity that one so beautiful and fair should be wedded to
one so black!'”

Thus, after all his trials and perils, the renowned son of Shedad was
duly married to his darling Abla, and thus he expressed his satisfaction
at the consummation of his wishes:

<span class="smallcaps">My</span> heart is at rest: it is recovered from
its intoxication. Sleep has calmed my eyelids, and relieved them.

Fortune has aided me, and my prosperity cleaves the veil of night, and
the seven orders of heaven.
