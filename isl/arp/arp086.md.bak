#### THE INTERVIEW.

##### A SONG IN THE RHYTHM OF THE ORIGINAL, WITH THE MUSIC ANNEXED.

<span class="small">\[THE music to this little piece was written down,
by a friend, from, the singing of David Zamir, a native of Bagdad, who
resided with the translator for some time at Cambridge.\]</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

DARKNESS closed around, loud the tempest drove,  
When through yonder glen I saw my lover rove,  
    Dearest youth!  
Soon he reached our cot, weary, wet, and cold,  
But warmth, wine, and I to cheer his spirits strove,  
    Dearest youth!

"How, my love," cried I, "durst thou hither stray  
Through the gloom, nor fear the ghosts that haunt the grove,  
    Dearest youth?"  
"In this heart," said he, "fear no seat can find,  
When each thought is filled alone with thee and love,  
    Dearest maid!"
