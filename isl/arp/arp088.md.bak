*I have only seen the fourteenth volume of this work, which comprises
all that is elegant and noble in composition. So lofty, so various, and
so bold is its style, that I do not hesitate to rank it amongst the most
finished poems*.—Sir W. Jones.

*This is the work, and not, as is generally supposed, the "Thousand and
One Nights," which is the source of the stories that fill the tents and
cottages of Arabia and Egypt*.—Von Hammer.

##### THE

# ROMANCE OF ANTAR.

### EDITOR'S PREFACE.

IT is generally believed that this celebrated Arabian Romance was
composed, in the eighth century, from traditionary tales which had been
long current in the East, by El-Asma’ee, a famous philologist and poet
at the court of Hároon Er-Rasheed. Other authors and sources (for
instance, Johainah and Abu Obeidah) are mentioned in the work, but
these, according to Von Hammer, have been inserted by story-tellers in
the coffeehouses. Lane, in his admirable work on the Modern Egyptians,
remarks that the ’Ulamà (learned men) "in general despise the romance,
and ridicule the assertion that El-Asma’ee was its author": their
opinion, however, on a question of this kind, is of little value.

The complete work is usually bound up in forty-five volumes of various
sizes—presenting a mass sufficient to appal the most indefatigable of
translators; not to speak of the impossibility of finding European
readers who would wade through the translation, if published. An
abridged copy of this voluminous work,

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

done by some learned Syrians (and hence called the *Shamiyeh*, or Syrian
Antar, to distinguish it from the original, which was known as the
*Hijaziyeh*, or Arabian Antar), having been obtained by Mr Terrick
Hamilton, during his residence at Constantinople, in his capacity of
Oriental Secretary to the British Embassy there, he was induced by its
comparative brevity to undertake the task of translating it into
English.

In the year 1819 the first fruits of his labours in this direction
appeared at London in the form of a small octavo volume of about 300
pages, entitled, "Antar, a Bedoueen Romance, translated from the
Arabic," &c., with a short introduction by a friend who had seen the
volume through the press. Next year (1820) three more volumes were
issued, completing the first of the three parts into which Mr Hamilton
intended dividing his translation, and bringing down Antar's adventures
to his marriage with Abla.

The work was very favourably noticed by the leading reviewers of the
day, some of whom ventured to predict for it a popularity in this
country as great as that accorded to the fascinating "Thousand and One
Nights." The anticipations of the translator, and of his friendly
critics, were, however, not realised: the marvellous exploits of the
Absian hero, and the wild and fiery, the tender and beautiful, effusions
of natural poetry with which the narrative is interspersed, had little
interest or charm for the bulk of English readers,—familiar only with
absurd imitations of Eastern fiction, adapted from the French, and
bearing as little resemblance to Oriental story as the stage sailor of
transpontine melodrama bears to the seaman of real life,—and, as a
consequence, the translation of Antar was not completed; but Mr Hamilton
gives an outline of the contents of the remainder, as follows:—

"The Second Part includes the period when the hero suspends his Poem at
Mecca. This grand point he at length attains, not only by the friendly
dispositions of his former associates, and the continuance of his own
heroic deeds, but also by the means of his

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

two sons and a brother, whom he discovers amongst the heroes of the
desert. Encouraged by their counsels, and urged by his own ambition,
after various conflicts and conquests, he resolves to crush the envious
malice of his domestic foes, and in despite of all the machinations
contrived against him, and the hostilities of all the most potent kings
of Arabia, he succeeds in accomplishing this second object of his
ambition.

"The Third Part comprises the death of Antar, and most of his comrades
and relations; in the course of which he wages endless wars against the
more distant tribes,—visits Constantinople and Europe, and invades that
part of Arabia inhabited by the Ethiopians, amongst whom he discovers
his mother's relations, and finds out that she was the daughter of a
mighty monarch, and himself thus descended in both lines from a majestic
race. His last conquest is over his domestic enemies. His death is
consonant with the rules of poetical justice. He falls under the hand of
one whom he might have justly punished with death, but who was the
object of cruelty he had never practised on any one before, not even his
most inveterate foes."

This singular work is the only record of the every-day life of the Arabs
ere yet they had come under the influence of El-Islám. "Even in a
translation," says a judicious critic, "Antar must be perused with
pleasure by those to whom the simple modes of life afford matter of
interesting speculation, and by those who are gratified with flowing and
luxuriant descriptions, united to lively and picturesque sketches of
events and characters." Here the virtues and the vices of these Children
of the Desert are faithfully portrayed: hospitable, brave, vindictive;
at once liberal and avaricious; withal possessing a punctilious sense of
honour: such were the pre-Islamite Arabs, whom the pen of El-Asma’ee has
so vividly delineated. The Poetry with which the work is richly jewelled
is the poetry of nature, abounding in touches of pathos, far beyond the
reach of art.

I regret that I have been unable to obtain any German or French
translation of the account of Antar's suspending his Kasidah on the
Kaaba; but my friend Mr. E. J. W. Gibb, of

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lochwood,
Lanarkshire, a young Orientalist of much promise, has favoured me with a
translation of the Death of Antar—one of the noblest of heroic
poems—from the French version of M. Caussin de Perceval, which is
appended to the following rough sketch of the leading incidents in the
First Part, according to Mr Hamilton's translation.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> adventures of Antar naturally suggest
the question of the origin of romantic fiction, or chivalric romance, in
Europe, which has long been, and perhaps is still, the subject of
dispute among men of learning. By some, romantic fiction is held to be
of purely Gothic origin, brought from the North by the Scalds who
accompanied the army of Rollo into France; others, again, allege that
its introduction into Europe is traceable to the Saracens who settled in
Spain early in the 8th century. The truth seems to be that European
mediæval romances were composed, in unequal parts, of classical tales of
antiquity, Northern legends, and Oriental fictions.

It is far from improbable that the famous Arabian Romance of Antar
furnished the model for the earliest of the regular romances of chivalry
which were current in Europe during the middle ages; indeed a comparison
of incidents in the work of El-Asma’ee with others found in the
so-called Gothic romances will show some very striking parallels,
sufficient of themselves to lead to this conclusion.

Many of the tales and fictions which were popular in Europe in mediæval
times, and which, collected from oral tradition, have been preserved in
such works as the "Clericali Disciplina" of Petrus Alphonsus, and the
"Gesta Romanorum," have been traced to Eastern sources—to Arabia and
Syria, and thence to India, through Persia. These fictions probably came
into Europe, partly through the Saracens of Spain, partly through
intercourse with the East during the Crusades.

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

But in the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries there was free intercourse
between the Eastern and Western countries of the Roman world. Hároon
Er-Rasheed and Charlemagne interchanged presents and messages of
good-will; and the wondrous adventures of Antar may well have become
known to early European writers of Chivalric Romance, when communication
was thus open between Asia and Europe.

If, however, we must seek in the Far East for the cradle of popular
European tales and fictions, the task of tracing back even Eastern
stories to their originals (for regarding popular fictions especially
does Solomon's sweeping assertion hold good—"there is nothing new under
the sun") becomes more complicated as we pursue our researches into
remote antiquity.

We have it on the high authority of Lane that the "Thousand and One
Nights" furnish exact pictures of Arabian manners and customs at the
period when they were composed; but the groundwork of many of these
charming tales is unquestionably of Persian or Indian origin. For
example: the story, familiar to every schoolboy, of El-’Ashshár (the
"Alnaschar" of our common English translation of Galland's garbled
French version) and his basket of glass-ware finds a parallel in the
"Pankatantra," a collection of Sanskrit Fables, where the same story is
told of a Brâhman and his pot of rice. But even in this ancient work we
do not find the true original of the Arabian Tale. Professor Benfey has
proved these Fables to have been borrowed from Buddhistic sources; and
Professor Max Müller thinks "we may go a step farther, and maintain that
not only the general outline of these Fables, but in some cases the very
words, were taken over from Pali into Sanskrit."—The general plan of the
"Thousand and One Nights" is said to have been borrowed from that of a
similar Pehlevi collection of Tales. It is moreover identical in plan
with that of the Parables of Sendabad, of Hindu origin, and known in
various old English versions under the title of the "Seven Wise
Masters."

But it is thought that the Romance of Antar must be essentially
original, since there existed no work of the same kind to serve

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

for a model. This may be true; and yet it appears to me not impossible
that some of the heroic adventures ascribed to Antar in this work may
have been derived indirectly from the old Pehlevi Romances so bitterly
denounced by the Kur’ân. One of these was brought into Arabia by a
merchant on his return from Persia, at the time when the Prophet was
promulgating his new religion. The Arabs, it is said, were charmed with
the stories of giants and dragons, and preferred them to the moral
instructions of Muhammad: hence the passage in the Kur’ân (chapter
xxxi.) against romances and idle tales. The Muslim conquerors of Persia,
it is well known, ruthlessly destroyed nearly all the literary treasures
of that ancient kingdom, and we may be sure that works of fiction were
the objects of their special abhorrence. But oral tradition may have
preserved scenes and incidents from the old Persian Romances; and since
it is said that to the obscurity of time do the ancients owe their
reputation for originality, so to sources, which are now for ever lost,
may El-Asma’ee, whose memory was richly stored with traditionary as well
as with written lore, have been indebted for some of the adventures
described in the Romance of Antar.
