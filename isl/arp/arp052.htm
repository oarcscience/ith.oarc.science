<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">POOR Puss is gone!&#8212;&#8217;tis Fate's decree&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I must still her loss deplore;<br> For dearer than a child was she,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And ne&#8217;er shall I behold her more.</p>  
<p>With many a sad presaging tear,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;This morn I saw her steal away,<br> While she went on without a fear,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that she should miss her prey.</p>  
<p>I saw her to the dove-house climb,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With cautious feet and slow she stept,<br> Resolved to balance loss of time<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;By eating faster than she crept.</p>  
<p>Her subtle foes were on the watch,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And marked her course, with fury fraught;<br> And while she hoped the birds to catch,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;An arrow's point the huntress caught.</p>  
<p>In fancy she had got them all,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And drunk their blood and sucked their breath;<br> Alas! she only got a fall,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And only drank the draught of death.</div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Why, why was pigeon's flesh so nice,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That thoughtless cats should love it thus?<br> Hadst thou but lived on rats and mice,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hadst been living still, poor Puss!</p>  
<p>Cursed be the taste, howe&#8217;er refined,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That prompts us for such joys to wish;<br> And cursed the dainty where we find<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Destruction lurking in the dish!</div></p>
