### THE SONG OF MAISUNA.

\[MAISUNA was a daughter of the tribe of Calab; a tribe, according to
Abulfeda, remarkable both for the purity of dialect spoken in it and for
the number of poets it had produced. She was married, whilst very young,
to the Khalif Mowiah; but this exalted situation by no means suited the
disposition of Maisuna; and, amidst all the pomp and splendour of
Damascus, she languished for the simple pleasures of her native desert.

These feelings gave birth to the following simple stanzas, which she
took the greatest delight in singing, whenever she could find an
opportunity to indulge her melancholy in private. She was unfortunately
overheard one day by Mowiah, who was of course not a little offended,
both with the discovery of his wife's sentiments, and with the
contemptuous manner in which she had expressed herself with regard to
her husband; and, as a punishment for her fault, he ordered her to
retire from court. Maisuna immediately obeyed, and, taking her infant
son Yezid with her, returned to Yemen; nor did she revisit Damascus till
after the death of Mowiah, when Yezid ascended the throne.\]

THE russet suit of camel's hair,  
  With spirits light and eye serene,  
Is dearer to my bosom far  
  Than all the trappings of a queen.

The humble tent, and murmuring breeze  
  That whistles through its fluttering walls,  
My unaspiring fancy please,  
  Better than towers and splendid halls.

Th’ attendant colts, that bounding fly  
  And frolic by the litter's side,  
Are dearer in Maisuna's eye  
  Than gorgeous mules in all their pride.

The watch-dog's voice, that bays whene’er  
  A-stranger seeks his master's cot,  
Sounds sweeter in Maisuna's ear  
  Than yonder trumpet's long-drawn note.

The rustic youth, unspoiled by art,  
  Son of my kindred, poor but free,  
Will ever to Maisuna's heart  
  Be dearer, pampered fool, than thee!
