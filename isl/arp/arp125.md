### ATTEMPTED MURDER OF ABLA.

A fresh plot is formed by Rebia, the brother of Amarah, to thwart
Antar's marriage. Rebia employs a female slave to decoy Abla to the
lake, one evening, on pretence of her meeting with Antar, when she is
carried off, and concealed in the land of Shiban. The slave-girl soon
afterwards discovers the iniquitous affair, and Rebia is compelled to
leave the tribe. He proceeds to Shiban, where he finds Mooferrij, the
friend who had charge of Abla, in terror lest Antar should come to know
of his share in the transaction. They determine to have Abla murdered
and buried in the sand-hills, so as to leave no trace of her. A slave,

named Basharah, accordingly carries Abla into the desert, and is about
to deal her a fatal blow with his poniard, when a man suddenly pounces
upon him, strikes him with a dagger between the shoulders, and the
assassin falls to the earth, bathed in blood.

The deliverer of Abla was Shiboob, who chanced to pass that way in quest
of her. Basharah, however, was not killed, though badly hurt. He
disclosed the chief actors in the murderous plot, and, with Shiboob's
consent, he placed Abla under the care of his own mother, living at a
distant place; and there she remained until Antar found an opportunity
of exposing Rebia's guilt to the King.
