### ON HIS FRIENDS.

#### BY MESKIN ALDARAMY.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

WITH conscious pride I view the band  
Of faithful friends that round me stand;  
With pride exult, that I alone  
Can join these scattered gems in one:  
    For they're a wreath of pearls, and I  
    The silken cord on which they lie.

’Tis mine their inmost souls to see;  
Unlocked is every heart to me;  
To me they cling, on me they rest,  
And I've a place in every breast:  
    For they're a wreath of pearls, and I  
    The silken cord on which they lie.

</div>
