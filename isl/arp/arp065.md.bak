##### ON THE

#### DEATH OF A SON.

##### BY ALI BEN MOHAMMED ALTAHMANY.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

TYRANT of Man! Imperious Fate!  
  I bow before thy dread decree;  
Nor hope in this uncertain state  
  To find a seat secure from thee.

Life is a dark, tumultuous stream,  
  With many a care and sorrow foul;  
Yet thoughtless mortals vainly deem  
  That it can yield a limpid bowl.

Think not that stream will backward flow,  
  Or cease its destined course to keep;  
As soon the blazing spark shall glow  
  Beneath the surface of the deep.

Believe not Fate, at thy command,  
  Will grant a meed she never gave;  
As soon the airy tower shall stand  
  That's built upon a passing wave.

Life is a sleep of threescore years;  
  Death bids us wake and hail the light;  
And man, with all his hopes and fears,  
  Is but a phantom of the night.

</div>
