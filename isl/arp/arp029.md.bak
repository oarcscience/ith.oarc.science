### ON THE BATTLE OF SABLA.

#### BY JAAFER BEN ALBA.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

SABLA, thou saw’st th’ exulting foe  
  In fancied triumphs crowned;  
Thou heard’st their frantic females throw  
  These galling taunts around:

Make now your *choice*—the terms we give,  
  Desponding victims, hear:  
These fetters on your *hands* receive,  
  Or in your *hearts* the spear."

"And is the conflict o’er?" we cried;  
  "And lie we at your feet?  
And dare you vauntingly decide  
  The fortune we must meet?

"A brighter day we soon shall see,  
  Though now the prospect lowers;  
And conquest, peace, and liberty  
  Shall gild our future hours."

The foe advanced;—in firm array  
  We rushed o’er Sabla's sands;  
And the red sabre marked our way  
  Amidst their yielding bands.

Then, as they writhed in Death's cold grasp,  
  We cried, "Our *choice* is made:  
These *hands* the sabres’ hilt shall clasp,  
  Your *hearts* shall have the blade!"

</div>
