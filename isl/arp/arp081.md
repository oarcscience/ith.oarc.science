#### ON LOVE.

##### BY ABU ALI, THE MATHEMATICIAN.

<span class="small">\[ABU ALI flourished in Egypt about <span
class="smallcaps">a.h.</span> 530, and was equally celebrated as a
mathematician and as a poet. In the following odd composition he seems
to have united these two discordant characters.\]</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I NEVER knew a sprightly fair  
  That was not dear to me;  
And freely I my heart could share  
  With every one I see.

It is not *this* or *that* alone  
  On whom my choice would fall:  
I do not more incline to one  
  Than I incline to all.

The circle's bounding line are they;  
  Its centre is my heart;  
My ready love, the equal ray  
  That flows to every part.

</div>
