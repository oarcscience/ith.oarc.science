### THE SATRAP KHOSREWAN SENT TO CHASTISE MONZAR.

Immediately on receiving Monzar's audacious message, the King of Persia
despatched his satrap Khosrewan (the original cause of all the trouble),
with a large army, to chastise his Arabian vassal. On the approach of
the Persians, Monzar collected all the clans of the tribe of Shiban, and
all the Arab hordes, and, giving battle to Khosrewan, was signally
defeated. In his extremity he thought of his prisoner, the lion-slayer.
Antar was freed from his fetters, and brought before Monzar.

"I am now in your power," said the hero; "and I demand of you the
marriage dower of Abla, my uncle's daughter: restore my sword, my
cuirass, my arms, and my horse, and give me a thousand men to defend my
rear; and you shall see what my courage and force will effect against
your foes."

Monzar swore, by the sacred Kaaba, that if Antar proved successful in
destroying the Persian army, all his camels should be at his disposal,
and ordered the hero's horse and arms to be restored to him.

Early on the morrow the Arabs went forth against the Persians, and at
their head was Antar, who, exclaiming, "By thine eyes, O Abla!" received
the attack of the enemy "as the parched ground the first of the rain."
The Persians were mowed

down by the irresistible Dhami: terror seized upon their hearts at the
sound of his voice, "like the thunder's peal"; and his sword-strokes
were more rapid than the flashes of lightning: the army of Monzar was
victorious.
