<div style="margin-left: 32px">

WHEN you told us our glances, soft, timid, and mild,  
  Could occasion such wounds in the heart,  
Can ye wonder that yours, so ungoverned and wild,  
  Some wounds to our cheeks should impart?

The wounds on our cheeks are but transient, I own,  
  With a blush they appear and decay;  
But those on the heart, fickle youths, ye have shown  
  To be even more transient than they.
