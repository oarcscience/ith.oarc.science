*Arabian Poetry*, by W. A. Clouston, \[1881\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[Having reviewed the long line of Himyarite princes, who were, each in
his day, "possessed of power for evil or for good," the Poet thus
moralises in conclusion.\]

### CLOSING VERSES.

129\. The chiefs of Himyar, and their kings, are buried in the dust, to
rest in graves beneath slabs of stones.

130\. They have become dust, they are trodden on like as Death treads
upon the mounds of earth and the pebbles of the watercourse.

131\. The world they lived in submitted to them, then turned away and
smote them with its kicking hoof.

132\. There rained upon them, after the clouds of their prosperity, the
clouds of misfortune in heavy-pouring showers.

133\. The accidents of Time had no regard for them, nor could they
defend themselves from them with swords or lances;

134\. No, not with troops and with palaces; nor with armies, and
fortresses, and weapons.

135\. They have their dwelling in the earth, after *living in* castles,
and delighting themselves with eating and drinking, and the pleasures of
wedlock.

136\. Their castles, which were built on supports of wide-spreading
stone, have become as smouldering wood.

137\. Time mingles its misfortunes with its favours, and affects its
children with misery in *the midst* of joy.

138\. Praise be to <span class="smallcaps">God</span>, whose beneficence
is to be hoped for! may He remain an object of praise in the morning and
the evening!

139\. And may blessings he upon the Prophet and his followers, as long
as the winged pigeon may coo!
