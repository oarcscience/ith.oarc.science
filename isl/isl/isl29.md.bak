#### CHAPTER FIVE

# Kalām: The Statements of the Theologians

The word usually used for scholastic theology--*kalām*--is, like
*sharī’a*, the common term for the Law, late in making its appearance.
This does not mean that there was no early Islamic theology. Rather,
both Law and theology were at first comprised in the term *fiqh*
(in-sight), which embraced right action and right belief. *Fiqh*
contrasted with *‘ilm* (knowledge), which applied chiefly to the
gathering of *Ḥadīth*, biography and history. When it was desirable to
make a distinction between *fiqh* as theology and *fiqh* as law, the
expressions *fiqh fi-al-dīn* (insight in religion) and *fiqh*
*fi-al-‘ilm* (insight in knowledge) were used. The latter term
recognizes the close bond between right action--the Law--and *Ḥadīth*,
the vehicle of the *sunna*.

The elaboration of theology was greatly accelerated in Islam, as in
other religions, by political and social history. During the first two
centuries, more than one segment of the Islamic community separated from
the main body, at times taking up arms against those who differed. Thus
made intensely aware of boundaries, it became necessary for Islamic
thinkers to state what the boundaries were.
