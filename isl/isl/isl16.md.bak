#### CHAPTER THREE

# The Law: *Fiqh*, *Sharī‘a*

The most characteristic activity of Islamic scholarship has not been, as
in other religions, theology, but the study and explication of the Law.
The concept of a divine law is of course a very ancient one in the
Semitic Orient; in Islam the concept of the Law follows naturally enough
from the Qur’ān, where God appears as commanding and forbidding,
rewarding and punishing. In addition, there is the *Ḥadīth*, and the
belief, present from the earliest times, that rules of right behavior
may be found in the example of the Prophet and the practice of the early
Community at Medina. We may add that the early Arab-Muslim Empire found
itself in need of a legal system for the exigencies of political power
and did not have any coherent earlier legal system of its own at its
disposal, as the early Christians did in the legal system of the Roman
Empire. Islam is submission to the will of God; it follows therefore
that the will of God, already partly made explicit in the Qur’ān, is
knowable and that its study is a matter of primary concern for Muslims.

Early Islam made no distinction between law and religion. It is
significant that the word for the legal system of Islam--the
*Sharī‘a*--or "Way"--was relatively late in making an appearance, and
the somewhat earlier word, *fiqh*, as "understanding," was used at first
equally for the study of law and theology, though it has come to have an
almost exclusively legal connotation. God speaks and

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

commands, man submits and obeys. This obedience is not simply a passive
or servile acceptance, however; Muslims conceive of their religion as a
community which says "Yes" to God and His world, and the joyful
performance of the Law, in most areas of the Islamic world, is looked on
as a positive religious value. It is true that important segments of the
Community have registered from early times a protest against the
activities of the lawyers because they felt that the spirit was in
danger of being lost in the legalistic debates of the jurisprudents; one
must submit oneself to God, the mystics argued, not to the *Sharī‘a*.
The lawyers could reply, however, that God is made known by His Word,
and right conduct by the *sunna*; the *Sharī‘a* is only the explication
of the Sacred Law contained in both; moreover, it is necessary for the
right ordinance of the Community.

In later times, the *Sharī‘a* is seen by Muslims primarily as an
all-embracing legal system, which should ideally govern all phases of
Islamic life--though for reasons of public welfare the legists grant the
Muslim rulers the right of suspending the application of certain
portions of the public law and substituting secular law; this has
especially been true for the laws of punishment. Still, the *Sharī‘a* is
not thereby abolished or revoked--one does not revoke Divine Law--it is
merely not enforced, because for temporal reasons it may not be feasible
at that time and place to do so.

The collecting of the *Ḥadīth* and the codification of the Law formed
the chief activity of the Muslim scholars of the first four centuries.
Of the various law-schools, four main tendencies have survived and
absorbed the other schools in *Sunnī* (Traditional) Islam, the orthodoxy
of the Muslim majority, or better, their orthopraxy <span

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

orientalist has penetratingly observed): for Muslims, consonant with
their emphasis on the Law, have been more concerned with what men do
than with what they believe, and very slow to reject any group of
Muslims for wrong doctrine, unless that doctrine led the group to
actively exclude itself, by its deeds, from the Community.

Every *Sunnī* must follow one school (*madhhab*) of the four accepted
schools--Ḥanafī, Mālikī, Shafi‘ī or Ḥanbalī. Its precepts dictate how he
performs religious duties and how he interprets the Law. Though he may
properly feel that his own school is in some sense "better"--and there
have been occasions of religious and political tensions between one
school and another--the official position is that all four are right and
acceptable.

While there is no priesthood or clergy in Islam, properly speaking,
there is a class which has played a clerical role in Islamic society,
and which has acquired social and religious prestige identical in kind
to that exercised by the priests of other religions. This is the
*‘ulamā’* (the "learned") and the *fuqahā’* ("lawyers"), the scholars
and custodians of the Law. It is they who have traditionally decided
what is an "official position."

Perhaps a word is in order about the legal texts which follow. All of
them are the work of medieval *‘ulamā’*, who were revered because their
work was held to indeed explicate the Divine Law in some way. But while
authoritative, they are not held to have been infallible, and they
frequently differed among themselves. Exactly what bearing their
endeavors should have on the life of Muslims today is one of the more
pressing and hotly debated issues of modern Islam. How much of their
work is to be incorporated in the legislation of modern Muslim states is
a matter of earnest questioning among the responsible classes

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

of Muslims, while it still forms an important part of the studies of the
*‘ulamā’*.
