### 3. *He Reveals Himself*

Since the Qur’ān is God's Word, the surest knowledge man can have of Him
is to be found there, and it is by pondering on the Book as a whole
rather than by abstracting or paraphrasing what it says that the Muslim
arrives at knowledge of God. In themselves, the verses seem to be
contradictory. Thus God appears as utterly transcendent, far above ever
being an object of knowledge, and at the same time "nearer to man than
his jugular

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

vein." But both statements about Him are equally true. He sustains men
and is merciful; He teaches and guides them, but if they disbelieve He
"leads them further astray." Muslims who argue for predestination as
well as those who seek to preserve man's free will have each been able
to find support in the Qur’ān for their views. While God has personal
qualities, no Muslim would refer to Him as personal (*shakhsī*). <span

Man is invited to believe, but in the end God is unknowable, except
insofar as He has chosen to reveal Himself; the way to Him lies through
His Book and devoted service to Him, and He enlightens and guides whom
He will.

God--  
there is no god but He, the  
Living, the Everlasting.  
Slumber seizes Him not, neither sleep;  
  to Him belongs  
all that is in the heavens and the earth.  
Who is there that shall intercede with Him  
  save by His leave?  
He knows what lies before them  
  and what is after them,  
and they comprehend not anything of His knowledge  
  save such as He wills.  
His Throne comprises the heavens and earth;  
the preserving of them oppresses Him not;  
He is the All-high, the All-glorious.

No compulsion is there in religion.  
Rectitude has become clear from error.  
So whosoever disbelieves in idols  
and believes in God, has laid hold of  
the most firm handle, unbreaking; God is  
  All-hearing, All-knowing.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

God is the Protector of the believers;  
He brings them forth from the shadows  
  into the light. (2:255-257)

God is the Light of the heavens and the, earth;  
the likeness of His Light is as a niche  
  wherein is a lamp  
  (the lamp in a glass,  
the glass as it were a glittering star)  
  kindled from a Blessed Tree,  
an olive that is neither of the East nor of the West  
whose oil wellnigh would shine, even if no fire touched it;  
  Light upon Light;  
  (God guides to His Light whom he will.)  
  (And God strikes similitudes for men,  
  and God has knowledge of everything.)  
in temples God has allowed to be raised up,  
and His Name to be commemorated therein;  
therein glorifying Him, in the mornings and the evenings,  
are men whom neither commerce nor trafficking  
  diverts from the remembrance of God  
and to perform the prayer, and to pay the alms,  
fearing a day when hearts and eyes shall be turned about,  
that God may recompense them for their fairest works  
  and give them increase of His bounty;  
and God provides whomsoever He will, without reckoning.

  And as for the unbelievers,  
their works are as a mirage in a spacious plain  
  which the man athirst supposes to be water,  
till, when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing;  
  there indeed he finds God,  
and He pays him his account in full; (and God is swift  
  at the reckoning.)  
or they are as shadows upon a sea obscure  
  covered by a billow  
  above which is a billow  
  above which are clouds  
shadows piled one upon another;

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

when he puts forth his hand, wellnigh he cannot see it.  
  And to whomsoever God assigns no light,  
  no light has he. (24:35-40)

God knows the Unseen in the heavens and the earth;  
He knows the thoughts within the breasts.  
It is He who appointed you viceroys in the earth.  
So whosoever disbelieves, his unbelief shall be  
charged against him; their unbelief increases  
the disbelievers only in hate in God's sight;  
their unbelief increases the disbelievers only  
  in loss. (35:38-39)

God is He that looses the winds, that stirs up clouds,  
and He spreads them in heaven how he will, and shatters them;  
then thou seest the rain issuing out of the midst of them,  
and when He smites with it whomsoever of His servants  
  He will, lo, they rejoice,  
although before it was sent down on them before that  
  they had been in despair.

So behold the marks of God's mercy,  
how He quickens the earth after it  
was dead; surely He is the quickener  
of the dead, and He is powerful  
  over everything.  
But if We loose a \[hot\] wind, and they see \[the earth\]  
  growing yellow,  
  they remain after that unbelievers.

Thou shalt not make the dead to hear,  
neither shalt thou make the deaf to hear the call  
  when they turn about, retreating.  
Thou shalt not guide the blind out of their error  
  neither shalt thou make any to hear  
except for such as believe in Our signs, and so surrender.

God is He that created you of weakness, then He appointed  
after weakness strength, then after strength He appointed

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

weakness and grey hairs; He creates what He will, and  
  He is the All-knowing, the All-powerful. (30:48-54)

  That then is God your Lord;  
  there is no god but He,  
  the Creator of everything.  
  So serve Him,  
  for He is Guardian over everything.  
The eyes attain Him not, but He attains the eyes;  
  He is the All-subtle, the All-aware. (6:102-103)
