# Guide to Pronunciation of Terms

The system of transliteration used in this volume for rendering Arabic
and Persian words in Latin letters closely follows standard modern
international practise.

The sounds thus represented may be approximated as follows in standard
English:

*Vowels*

*Short "a"*: between the vowel sounds of "hat" and "fur."

*Long "a"*: (*ā*): like the a in "hard."

*Short "i"*: as in English "pit."

*Long "i"* (*ī*): like the vowel sound in "feet."

*Short "u"*: as in "hook," or "put."

*Long "u"*: (*û*): as in "clue," or the vowel sound in "food."

*Consonants*

*Glottal stop*, or hamza, *represented by* (*’*): can be found in
between two English words ending and beginning with vowels, as: "Iowa
apples," or where the "t’s" should be in "bottle," as it is pronounced
by many New Yorkers.

‘ayn, *represented by* (*‘*): a sort of twang of the vocal cords
preceding or following another letter.

(*q*), *the Arabic* qāf: made by a "k" far back in the throat, at the
uvula.

(*ḥ*), *Arabic* ḥā’: a strongly aspirant "h", made in the throat area
above the windpipe.

(*ṡ*) (*ẓ*) (*ṭ*) (*ḍ*): each is made by darkening the sound of the
corresponding undotted letter. When these dotted consonants are made,
the tongue should lie flat and broad in the mouth, behind the lower
front teeth. The consonant

sound will also slightly alter the quality of any vowel which
immediately precedes or follows it.

(*gh*), *Arabic* ghayn: it is made by a sort of dry gargling like the
Parisian (r).

(*kh*), *Arabic* khā’: much like German "*ch*" in "nicht" or "Nacht," or
the Greek *chi*.
