### 5. *The Dervishes*

The word *darvīsh* (poor) is simply the Persian for the Arabic *faqīr*
(fakir), a word used, along with the North African *marabout*, for Ṡūfī
ascetics and mystics. But "dervish" has come to be applied primarily to
the adherent of a Ṡūfī order, or *ṭarīqa*.

The earliest Ṡūfī shaykhs had had their circle of disciples, and with
the neo-orthodox revival of the eleventh century Saljūq restoration, the
building and endowing of monastic establishments for Sūfīs, as well as
the orthodox madrasa schools, became a favorite activity of Muslim
rulers.

With the thirteenth century A.D. there appeared regular international
orders, with daughter chapters, a rule and a prescribed order of
*dhikr*, or *samā‘*. The first of these was the sober and orthodox
Qādirī *ṭarīqa*, founded about A.D. 1200 at Baghdad by ‘Abd al-Qādir
al-Jīlānī. Others followed: Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī's Mawlāwī, or Mevlevī
order, the Transoxanian Naqshbandīs, with their silent dhikr or prayer
service, the Shādhilī order of North Africa, the Chishtīya of India,
etc.

With the breakdown and transformation of much of organized society
following the Mongol invasions, the *ṭarīqas* provided a convenient form
of social organization, and undertook such disparate duties as civil
defense, public relief and public security. In some areas dervish
brotherhoods governed cities, organized revolutions and converted pagan
tribes. The brilliant Ṡafavī dynasty of

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Persia was founded
by a family of Ṡūfī shaykhs carried to power in the early sixteenth
century by para-military forces organized as a brotherhood among the
nomad Turcoman tribes.

At the same time, the orders popularized the teachings of the Ṡūfīs and
carried them down to the lowest ranks of the population, though not
without some vulgarization and damaging of the original values Ṡūfism
had represented, substituting emotional revivalism for interior
devotion.

Nevertheless, the *ṭarīqas* deserve great credit: few world religions
have tried to teach--or succeeded in teaching--mystical religion to the
masses, and the orders provided valuable social services and comforted
the common man, besides doing much to color the religious life of later
Islam. Professor Gibb puts it succinctly: "Islam in the eighteenth
century was like a richly colored tapestry into whose pattern had gone
not only Qur’ān and *Ḥadīth*, shari’ī puritanism, (non-conformist)
*malāmī* ethics, *Hallājī* exaltation, *bāṭinī* (esoteric)
interpretation, the monism of Ibn al-‘Arabī, the aesthetic sensibility
of Rūmī, and the hypnotic or thaumaturgic rituals of the ecstatic
orders, but also astrology, divination, wonder-working, and above all,
the cult of saints, dead and alive." <span

Almost every male Muslim belonged to one or more *ṭarīqas*, which took
the place of church denomination, social club, Masonic lodge, night
school, burial association and marching society. Every guild was
affiliated with a *ṭarīqa*, and almost every village supported some
resident Ṡūfī holy man.

The core of the *ṭarīqa's* life was the collective dhikr at the lodge,
or *tekke*, where the dervishes under the leader-

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

ship of an adept would contemplate, chant or dance in unison until some
fell into a trance.

Today these *dhikrs* can still be seen in some areas of the Muslim
world; the observer may encounter things which seem to belong in a case
book of abnormal psychology, or witness what looks remarkably like
demonic possession. But unless he is wholly unsympathetic, he may find
also in these sweating ecstatics examples of pure and devoted attendance
upon the Holy.

The dervish was not himself an adept, though he might become one;
rather, by following the example and practice of the Stiff saints, he
attempted to share in their mystical experiences.

While the orders today are everywhere on the retreat, their influence
remains. The manuals of prayer used by the humble faithful in all the
great centers of Islam today, for instruction in prayer which goes
beyond the often mechanical repetition of the official ritual prayers,
were once composed for the dervishes. <span

I have naught but my destitution  
  To plead for me with Thee.  
And in my poverty I put forward that destitution as my plea.  
I have no power save to knock at Thy door,  
And if I be turned away, at what door shall I knock?  
Or on whom shall I call, crying his name,  
If Thy generosity is refused to Thy destitute one?  
Far be it from Thy generosity to drive the disobedient one to despair!  
Generosity is more freehanded than that.  
In lowly wretchedness I have come to Thy door,  
Knowing that degradation there finds help.  
In full abandon I put my trust in Thee,

     \[Attributed to ’Abd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī as well as to Abuyad
al-Tijānī\]

My Master, My Master, if Thou hast shown mercy to any like me, then be
merciful to me. If Thou hast received any like me, then receive me.  
Oh God, Thy pardon of my sin, Thy passing over my errors, Thy covering
of the ugliness of my doings,  
Thy long patience with my many wickednesses  
Whether I did them of error or of set purpose, have  
Made me ask in hope that to which I have no right." <span

     \[‘Alī Zayn al-‘Abidīn\]

O saints of God, to I am sick, and before you is medicine and healing.  
Then of your favor look on me for treatment, and grant me of your
goodness what is needed.  
How many a sick one sought you at your door, and left it, sickness gone
from him in healing.  
How many a chronic sufferer have you helped, bedridden, whom your bounty
has sufficed.  
You are the door, and God is generous.  
He then who comes to you finds grace and health <span

     \[Muhammad ‘Alī, Muftī al-Jazā’ir\]

O Lord of the clear heavens and the light and the darkness in them;  
O Lord of the outspread lands and the creatures and created things in
them:  
O Lord of the steadfast mountains:  
O Lord of the sweeping winds:  
O Lord of the airy clouds balanced between the heavens and the earth:  
O Lord of the stars sent by Thee on their business and flashing in the
air of heaven <span id="fr_131"></span>[52](#fn_131)  
     \[Prayer for the 27th of Ramadān\]

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

Thy truth, Thy righteousness, Thine excellence, Thy might, Thy free
favor have never failed me for a moment since Thou didst send me into
the abode of experience and reflection and discursive thought, to see
what I should bring with me to the lasting abode and the session of the
blessed. I am Thy slave: make me, then, to be Thy freedman. <span
id="fr_132"></span>[53](#fn_132)  
     \[al-Ḥizb al Sayfī\]

O Lord, call down a blessing on Muhammad in the cooing of doves, in the
hovering of birds, in the pasturing of cattle, in the excellence of the
strong, in the might of the full-grown, in the sleeping of slumberers .
. . in the brightening of morning, in the murmur of the winds and in the
tramp of cattle, in the girding on of swords and the brandishing of
lances and in the health of bodies and spirits <span
id="fr_133"></span>[54](#fn_133)  
     \[al-Ṡalāt li-al-Buṡīrī\]

Praise to Thee, glorified be Thy Majesty, while I live, and when I die .
. . and when I am brought forth to Thee astounded by the awful cry
(calling to) the Assembly, and when I stand dumbfounded in Thy presence
at the publishing of the pages of my past life. And when Thou askest me
and my very members are witnesses for Thee against me. . . <span
id="fr_134"></span>[55](#fn_134)  
     \[Prayer for the first day of the New Year\]

My God and my Lord, eyes are at rest, stars are setting, hushed are the
movements of birds in their nests, of monsters in the deep. And Thou art
the Just who knoweth no change, the Equity that swerveth not, the
Everlasting that passes not away. The doors of kings are locked, watched
by their body-guards; but Thy door is open to him who calls on Thee. My
Lord, each lover is now alone with his beloved, and Thou art for me the
Beloved <span id="fr_135"></span>[56](#fn_135)
