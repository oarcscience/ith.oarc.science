### 2. *He Speaks Through the Prophets*

*Abraham*: The Patriarch Abraham, ancestor of the Semites, is seen in
the Qur’ān as the prototype of the Muslim; it is implied that he arrived
at monotheism by pure reason before the revelation came. With his
first-born, Ishmael, he built the Temple of the Ka‘ba at Bekka, or
Mecca, and instituted the rites of pilgrimage. While he has been claimed
by both the Jews and the Christians, he did not belong to either of
these religions, it is said; he was simply a man who submitted himself
to God: a Muslim.

And mention in the Book Abraham;  
surely he was a true man, a Prophet.  
When he said to his father, "Father,  
why worshippest thou that which neither  
hears nor sees, nor avails thee anything?  
Father, there has come to me knowledge  
such as came not to thee; so follow me,  
and I will guide thee on a level path.

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

Father, serve not Satan; surely Satan  
is a rebel against the All-merciful.  
Father, I fear that some chastisement  
from the All-merciful will smite thee,  
so that thou becomest a friend to Satan."  
Said he, "What, are thou shrinking  
from my gods, Abraham? Surely, if thou  
givest not over, I shall stone thee;  
so forsake me now for some while."  
He said, "Peace be upon thee!  
I will ask my Lord to forgive thee;  
surely He is ever gracious to me.  
Now I will go apart from you  
and that you call upon, apart from  
God; I will call upon my Lord,  
and haply I shall not be, in calling  
upon my Lord, unprosperous."  
So, when he went apart from them  
and that they were serving, apart  
from God, We gave him Isaac and  
Jacob, and each We made a Prophet;  
and We gave them of Our mercy,  
and We appointed unto them  
a tongue of truthfulness, sublime. (19:41-50)

Say: "God has spoken the truth; therefore follow  
the creed of Abraham, a man of pure faith  
  and no idolater."  
The first House established for the people  
was that at Bekka, a place holy, and a guidance  
  to all beings.  
Therein are clear signs--the station of Abraham,  
and whosoever enters it is in security.  
It is the duty of all men towards God to come  
to the House a pilgrim, if he is able to  
  make his way there.  
As for the unbeliever, God is All-sufficient  
  nor needs any being. (3:95-97)

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

And they say, "Be Jews or Christians and  
you shall be guided." Say thou: "Nay, rather  
the creed of Abraham, a man of pure faith;  
  he was no idolater."  
Say you: "We believe in God, and  
  in that which has been sent down on us  
and sent down on Abraham, Ishmael,  
Isaac and Jacob, and the Tribes,  
and that which was given to Moses and Jesus  
and the Prophets, of their Lord; we  
make no division between any of them, and  
  to Him we surrender."  
And if they believe in the like of that you  
believe in, then they are truly guided; but if  
they turn away, then they are clearly in schism;  
God will suffice you for them; He is  
  the All-hearing, the All-knowing;  
the baptism of God; and who is there  
that baptizes fairer than God?  
  Him we are serving. (2:135-138)

*Moses*: Moses is one of the most frequently mentioned of the prophets;
he was sent to rescue the children of Ishmael's nephew Israel from
Egypt. However, the Children of Israel became proud and disobeyed God;
they regarded themselves as a Chosen People and wronged their brethren,
and when God sent prophets to warn them, they refused to listen and put
His messengers to death. They are People of the Book, since God gave
them the scriptures, but they have perverted their revelation.

So when Moses had accomplished the term  
and departed with his household, he observed  
on the side of the Mount a fire. He said to his  
household, "Tarry you here; I observe a fire.  
Perhaps I shall bring you news of it,

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

or a faggot from the fire, that haply  
  you shall warm yourselves."  
When he came to it, a voice cried from the right bank  
of the watercourse, in the sacred hollow,  
coming from the tree: "Moses, I am God, the  
  Lord of all Being.  
Cast down thy staff." And when he saw it  
quivering like a serpent, he turned about  
retreating, and turned not back. "Moses,  
come forward, and fear not; for surely thou  
  art in security.  
Insert thy hand into thy bosom, and it will  
come forth white without evil; and press to thee  
thy arm, that thou be not afraid. So these  
shall be two proofs from thy Lord to Pharaoh  
and his Council; for surely they are an  
  ungodly people."  
Said he, "My Lord, I have indeed slain  
a living soul among them, and I fear that  
  they will slay me.  
Moreover my brother Aaron is more eloquent  
than I. Send him with me as a helper  
and to confirm I speak truly, for I fear they  
  will cry me lies."  
Said He, "We will strengthen thy arm by means  
of thy brother, and We shall appoint to you  
an authority, so that they shall not reach you  
because of Our signs; you, and whoso follows you,  
  shall be the victors."  
So when Moses came to them with Our signs,  
clear signs, they said, "This is nothing but a  
forged sorcery. We never heard of this among  
  our fathers, the ancients."  
But Moses said, "My Lord knows very well  
who comes with the guidance from Him, and shall  
possess the Ultimate Abode; surely the evildoers  
  will not prosper."  
And Pharaoh said, "Council, I know not that you  
have any god but me. Kindle me, Haman,

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

a fire upon the clay, and make me a tower, that I  
may mount up to Moses' god; for I think that he is  
  one of the liars."  
And he waxed proud in the land, he and his hosts,  
wrongfully; and they thought they should not be  
  returned to Us.  
Therefore We seized him and his hosts, and cast them  
into the sea; so behold how was the end  
of the evildoers!  
And We appointed them leaders, calling to the  
Fire; and on the Day of Resurrection they  
  shall not be helped;  
and We pursued them in this world with a curse,  
and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be  
  among the spurned.  
And We gave Moses the Book, after that We had  
destroyed the former generations, to be examples  
and a guidance and a mercy, that haply so  
  they might remember. (28:29-43)

Children of Israel, remember My blessing  
wherewith I blessed you, and that I  
have preferred you above all beings;  
and beware of a day when no soul for another  
shall give satisfaction, and no intercession  
shall be accepted from it, nor any counterpoise  
be taken, neither shall they be helped.

And when We delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh  
who were visiting you with evil chastisement,  
slaughtering your sons, and sparing your women;  
and in that was a grievous trial from your Lord.  
And when We divided for you the sea  
and delivered you, and drowned Pharaoh's fold  
  while you were beholding.  
And when We appointed with Moses forty nights  
then you took to yourselves the Calf after him  
  and you were evildoers;

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

then We pardoned you after that, that haply  
  you should be thankful.  
And when We gave to Moses the Book  
and the Salvation, that haply  
  you should be guided. (2:40-53)

And when Moses sought water for his people,  
so We said, "Strike with thy staff the rock";  
and there gushed forth from it twelve fountains;  
all the people knew now their drinking-place.  
"Eat and drink of God's providing, and  
mischief not in the earth, doing corruption."  
And when you said, "Moses, we will not endure  
one sort of food; pray to thy Lord for us, that He  
may bring forth for us of that the earth produces--  
green herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils, onions."  
He said, "Would you have in exchange what is meaner  
for what is better? Get you down to Egypt;  
you shall have there that you demanded."  
And abasement and poverty were pitched upon them,  
and they were laden with the burden of God's anger;  
that, because they had disbelieved the signs of God  
and slain the Prophets unrightfully; that,  
because they disobeyed, and were transgressors.  
Surely they that believe, and those of Jewry,  
and the Christians, and those Sabaeans,  
whoso believes in God and the Last Day, and works  
righteousness--their wage awaits them with their Lord,  
and no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow. (2:60-62)

*Jesus*: John and Jesus are seen as members of the righteous family of
‘Imrān, among the Children of Israel. Jesus holds a place unique among
the prophets in Islam. He is born of a virgin "purified above all
women," he is the promised Messiah, "The Word of God and a Spirit from
Him," an almost superhuman figure who spoke from the

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

cradle and worked great wonders by the power of God; but the central
doctrines of Christianity are set aside. The idea that he is the Son of
God is sternly rejected, the doctrine of the Trinity is held to
contradict God's Oneness, and since Jesus did not die on the cross and
there was no collective guilt of man for which he could atone, there was
no Atonement and no Resurrection. While also People of the Book, the
early Christians are held to have deliberately falsified the scripture
he brought, and to have worshiped the Messiah blasphemously. Later
generations have been perhaps sincere but certainly misguided, so that a
new revelation became necessary. As for Jesus, God took him to Himself
when the Jews rejected him, and will justify him before the end of the
world.

And when the angels said,  
"Mary, God has chosen  
thee, and purified  
thee; He has chosen  
thee above all women.  
Mary, be obedient to  
thy Lord, prostrating  
and bowing before Him."  
(That is of the tidings  
of the Unseen, that We  
reveal to thee; for thou  
wast not with them, when  
they were casting quills  
which of them should have  
charge of Mary; thou  
wast not with them, when  
they were disputing.)  
When the angels said,  
"Mary, God gives thee good  
tidings of a Word from Him  
whose name is Messiah,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

Jesus, son of Mary;  
high honoured shall he be  
in this world and the next,  
near stationed to God.  
He shall speak to men  
in the cradle, and of age,  
and righteous he shall be."  
"Lord," said Mary,  
"how shall I have a son  
seeing no mortal has touched me?" "Even so,"  
God said, "God  
creates what He will.  
When He decrees a thing  
He does but say to it  
'Be,' and it is." (3:42--47)

So she conceived him, and withdrew with him  
  to a distant place.  
And the birthpangs surprised her by  
the trunk of the palm-tree. She said,  
"Would I had died ere this, and become  
  a thing forgotten!"  
But the one that was below her  
called to her, "Nay, do not sorrow;  
see, the Lord has set below thee  
  a rivulet.  
Shake also to thee the palm-trunk,  
and there shall come tumbling upon thee  
  dates fresh and ripe.  
Eat therefore, and drink, and be  
comforted; and if thou shouldst see  
  any mortal,  
say, 'I have vowed to the All-merciful  
a fast, and today I will not speak  
  to any man.'  
Then she brought the child to her folk  
carrying him; and they said,  
"Mary, thou hast surely committed  
  a monstrous thing!

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

Sister of Aaron, thy father was not  
a wicked man, nor was thy mother  
  a woman unchaste."  
Mary pointed to the child then;  
but they said, "How shall we speak  
to one who is still in the cradle,  
  a little child?"  
He said, "Lo, I am God's servant;  
God has given me the Book, and  
  made me a Prophet.  
Blessed He has made me, wherever  
I may be; and He has enjoined me  
to pray, and to give the alms, so  
  long as I live,  
and likewise to cherish my mother;  
He has not made me arrogant,  
  unprosperous.  
Peace be upon me, the day I was born,  
and the day I die, and the day I am  
  raised up alive!"  
That is Jesus, son of Mary,  
in word of truth, concerning which  
  they are doubting.  
It is not for God to take a son  
unto Him. Glory be to Him! When he  
decrees a thing, He but says to it  
  "Be," and it is.  
Surely God is my Lord, and your  
Lord; so serve you Him. This is  
  a straight path. (19:22-36)

And when Jesus perceived their unbelief, he said,  
"who will be my helpers unto God?"  
The Apostles said: "We will be helpers of God,  
We believe in God; witness thou that we \[are Muslims\]. <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md)  
Lord, we believe in what Thou hast sent down,  
And we follow thy Messenger.  
Inscribe us with those who witness to the truth." (3:52-53)

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

Then (his enemies) devised against him,  
And God devised.  
And God is the best of devisers! (3:54)

And for their unbelief, and their uttering  
against Mary a mighty calumny,  
and for their saying, "We slew the Messiah,  
Jesus son of Mary, the Messenger of God"--  
yet they did not slay him, neither crucified him,  
only a likeness of that was shown to them.  
Those who are at variance concerning him surely  
are in doubt regarding him; they have no knowledge  
of him, except the following of surmise;  
and they slew him not of a certainty--  
no indeed; God raised him up to Him; God is  
  All-mighty, All-wise.  
There is not one of the People of the Book  
but will assuredly believe in him before his  
death, and on the Resurrection Day he will be  
  a witness against them. (4:154-159)

People of the Book, go not beyond the bounds  
in your religion, and say not as to God  
but the truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary,  
was only the Messenger of God, and His Word  
that He committed to Mary, and a Spirit from  
Him. So believe in God and His Messengers,  
and say not, "Three." Refrain; better is it  
for you. God is only One God. Glory be  
to Him--that He should have a son!  
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens  
and in the earth; God suffices  
  for a guardian.  
The Messiah will not disdain to be a servant  
of God, neither the angels who are near  
  stationed to Him. (4:171-172)

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

*Muhammad*: Muhammad is the chosen instrument by which God sent the
Eternal Message in its definitive form, "the prophet" par excellence.
The Qur’ān addresses him directly, to assure him that he is not insane,
and to encourage him against men's doubts; it solemnly confirms as true
the visions he has seen. Finally, it is suggested that the truth of his
message may be seen from the faith of the Muslims.

*Nun*

By the Pen, and what they inscribe,  
thou art not, by the blessing of thy Lord,  
  a man possessed.  
Surely thou shalt have a wage unfailing;  
surely thou art upon a mighty morality.  
So thou shalt see, and they will see,  
  which of you is the demented.

Surely thy Lord knows very well  
those who have gone astray from  
His way, and He knows very well  
  those who are guided. (62:1-7)

By the Star when it plunges,  
your comrade is not astray, neither errs,  
  neither speaks he out of caprice.  
This is naught but a revelation revealed,  
taught him by one terrible in power,  
  very strong; he stood poised,  
  being on the higher horizon,  
then drew near and suspended hung,  
two bows'-length away, or nearer,  
then revealed to his servant what he revealed.  
His heart lies not of what he saw;  
what, will you dispute with him what he sees?

Indeed, he saw him another time  
by the Lote-Tree of the Boundary

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

nigh which is the Garden of the Refuge,  
When there covered the Lote-Tree that which covered;  
  his eyes swerved not, nor swept astray.  
Indeed, he saw one of the greatest signs of his Lord. (53:1-18)

*Qaf*

Nay, but they marvel that a warner has come to  
them from among them; and the unbelievers say,  
  "This is a marvellous thing!  
What, when we are dead and become dust? That  
  is a far returning!"  
We know what the earth diminishes of them;  
  with Us is a book recording.  
Nay, but they cried lies to the truth  
when it came to them, and so they are  
  in a case confused.  
What, have they not beheld heaven above them,  
how We have built it, and decked it out fair,  
  and it has no cracks?  
And the earth--We stretched it forth, and cast on it  
  firm mountains,  
and We caused to grow therein of every joyous kind  
  for an insight  
and a reminder to every penitent servant.  
  And We sent down out of heaven  
  water blessed,  
and caused to grow thereby gardens  
  and grain of harvest  
and tall palm-trees with spathes compact,  
  a provision for the servants,  
and thereby We revived a land that was dead.  
  Even so is the coming forth.

Cried lies before them the people of Noah  
  and the men of Er-Rass, and Thamood, and  
Ad and Pharaoh, the brothers of Lot, the  
men of the Thicket, the people of Tubba’.

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

Every one cried lies to the Messengers,  
  and My threat came true.

What, were We wearied by the first creation?  
No indeed; but they are in uncertainty  
  as to the new creation.

We indeed created man; and We know  
what his soul whispers within him,  
and We are nearer to him than the  
  jugular vein. (50:1-17)

And We sent Noah, and Abraham,  
and We appointed the Prophecy and  
the Book to be among their seed; and  
some of them are guided, and many of  
  them are ungodly.

Then We sent, following  
in their footsteps, Our  
Messengers; and We sent,  
following, Jesus son of  
Mary, and gave unto him  
  the Gospel.  
And We set in the hearts of those who  
followed him tenderness and mercy.

And monasticism they invented--We  
did not prescribe it for them--only  
seeking the good pleasure of God; but  
they observed it not as it should be  
observed. So We gave those of them  
who believed their wage; and many of  
  them are ungodly.

O, believers, fear God, and believe  
in His Messenger, and He will give you  
a twofold portion of His mercy, and  
He will appoint for you a light whereby  
you shall walk, and forgive you; God is  
  All-forgiving, All-compassionate;

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

that the People of the Book may know  
that they have no power over anything  
of God's bounty, and that bounty is in  
the hand of God; He gives it unto  
whomsoever He will; and God is of  
  bounty abounding. (57:26-29)

Muhammad is the Messenger of God,  
and those who are with him are hard  
against the unbelievers, merciful  
one to another. Thou seest them  
bowing, prostrating, seeking bounty  
from God and good pleasure. Their  
mark is on their faces, the trace of  
prostration. That is their likeness  
in the Torah, and their likeness  
in the Gospel: as a seed that puts  
forth its shoot, and strengthens it,  
and it grows stout and rises straight  
upon its stalk, pleasing the sowers,  
that through them He may enrage  
the unbelievers. God has promised  
those of them who believe and do deeds  
of righteousness forgiveness and  
  a mighty wage. (48:29)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2"></span>[39:3](isl06.htm#fr_2.md) Since all who submit
themselves to God's will are Muslims, Abraham and the twelve apostles
are Muslims. It would appear preferable to call those Muslims who have
followed Muhammad by the earlier term "Muhammadans," were it not that
they resent the term as implying some sort of idolatrous relationship
with their prophet.
