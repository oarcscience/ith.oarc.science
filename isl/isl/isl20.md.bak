### 4. *The Bidding Unto Good* (Al-amr bi al-Ma‘ruf)

The Law orders men to do good and reject what is reprehensible, and it
is also obligatory for Muslims to enjoin right behavior on their fellows
and deter them from wrong action. This aspect of Islamic ethics (the
*ḥisba*) explains a degree of being one's brother's keeper in Islamic
civilization that would probably have been regarded as officious

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

in other societies. The following regulations are chosen almost at
random.

 

Of *Dhabaḥ*, or ritual slaughter of animals for food: All animals killed
for food except fish and locusts must be slain by *dhabaḥ*, but when
slain by *dhabaḥ* they are lawful, as by means of *dhabaḥ* the unclean
blood is separated from the clean flesh, whence it is that all animals
not eatable (such as rats, dogs, and cats) are rendered clean by
*dhabaḥ* (for medicine, though not for food), except hogs and men. . . .

It is one of the laws of *dhabaḥ* that the person who performs it be
either a Muslim or a Person of the Book. The *dhabaḥ* of a Person of the
Book is therefore lawful, (even) though he should not be a subject of a
Muslim state, providing however that he has done it in the name of God,
for in the Qur’ān we find these words: "The victuals of the People of
the Book are lawful for you."

The *dhabaḥ* is lawful provided the slayer be acquainted with the form
of *tasmīya* or invocation of the name of God, and the method of cutting
the veins of the animal, and it signifies not whether the person be a
man or a woman, an infant or an idiot, a circumcised person or
uncircumcised.

An animal slain by a Zoroastrian is unlawful, because the Prophet has
said: "Ye may deal with them as well as with People of the Book, but ye
must not marry their women or eat of animals slain by them," and also
because a Zoroastrian is a polytheist and does not acknowledge the unity
of God.

The *dhabaḥ* of an idolator is unlawful, because he does not believe in
the prophets. . . .

If the slayer wilfully omit the invocation "in the name of God," the
animal is carrion and must not be eaten. If however he omit the
invocation through forgetfulness, it is lawful. Al-Shāfi‘ī is of the
opinion that it is lawful in either case; Mālik, on the contrary,
maintains that it is unlawful in both, and Muslims and People of the
Book are the same with respect to omission of the invocation. . . . The
opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī in this particular, is opposite to that of all our
sages. . . . <span id="fr_66"></span>[18](#fn_66.md)

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

*Sacrifice*: It is the duty of every free Muslim (male) arrived at the
age of maturity to offer a sacrifice on the *‘Id al-Qurbān* (tenth of
the month of Pilgrimage) if he possesses the requisite amount and is not
a traveller . . . in the opinion of al-Shāfi'ī sacrifice is not an
indispensable duty but only laudable. . . .

The sacrifice established for one person is a goat and that for seven a
cow or camel. . . .

It is lawful for a person who offers a sacrifice either to eat the flesh
or to bestow it on whomever he pleases whether rich or poor, and he may
also lay it up in store. It is most advisable that the third part of the
flesh of a sacrifice be bestowed in charity. <span
id="fr_67"></span>[19](#fn_67.md)

 

*Cultivation of Waste Lands*: Whosoever cultivates waste lands with the
permission of the *Imām* obtains a property in them; whereas if a person
cultivates them without such permission he does not in that case become
a proprietor, according to Abū Ḥanīfa. The two disciples (of Abū Ḥanīfa)
maintain that in this case also the cultivator becomes proprietor,
because of a saying of the Prophet, "Whoever cultivates waste lands does
thereby acquire the property of them." <span
id="fr_68"></span>[20](#fn_68.md)

 

The *Muḥtasib*: Growing out of the *ḥisba* is the office of the
*muḥtasib*, who in premodern times, though scarcely anywhere today, was
custodian of public morals and inspector of markets. The following
excerpts are taken from a manual of instruction for *muḥtasibs* written
by the Egyptian Shāfi'ī lawyer Ibn al-Ukhūwa (died A.H. 729/ A.D. 1329).

 

*Market Regulations*: The *muḥtasib* must order (transporters of goods)
if they stay long in one place to unload the pack animals, for if the
animals stand with loads, it will hurt them, and that is cruelty. The
Messenger of God has forbidden cruelty to animals. The *muḥtasib* should
order the

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

people of the market to keep it clean of filth which collects in it and
will hurt the people . . . and he should allow no one to spy on his
neighbors from the roofs or through windows, or men to sit in the paths
of women needlessly; whoever does something of this sort must be
corrected by the *muḥtasib*. . . . <span id="fr_69"></span>[21](#fn_69.md)

 

*Money Changers*: Earning a living by changing money is a great danger
to the religion of him who practices it; indeed there is no preserving
his religion for him, except after knowledge of the Law so as to avoid
falling into forbidden practices. It is incumbent on the *muḥtasib* to
search out their market and to spy on them, and if he finds one of them
practising usury or doing something illegal in his money-changing, to
punish him. . .  <span id="fr_70"></span>[22](#fn_70.md)

 

*Barber-Surgeons*: . . . They must carry with them tools for
circumcision, razor and scissors, for circumcision is a religious
obligation for men and for women according to the generality of men of
learning. Abū Ḥanīfa says it is confirmed *sunna*, but not obligatory. .
. . Our guide is what is related of the Prophet--the blessing of God and
peace be on him--when he said to a man who had become a Muslim, "Get rid
of the long hair of paganism, and be circumcised," and because also
cutting off a part of the body is a part of God's right on us . . . like
the cutting off the hand of a thief. If this is established, then
circumcision for a man consists of cutting off the foreskin, and for a
woman in (clitoral excision: practiced chiefly by Shāfi'ī school). So it
is obligatory for men and women to do this for themselves and their
children, and if they neglect it, the *Imām* may force them to do it for
it is right and necessary. . .  <span id="fr_71"></span>[23](#fn_71.md)

 

*Ship-Men*: Owners of ships and boats shall be prevented from loading
their vessels above the usual load, for fear of sinking. For the same
reason the *muḥtasib* must forbid them to sail during windstorms. If
they carry women on the same boat with men there must be a partition set
between (men and women).

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

*Sellers of Earthenware and Pottery*: The sellers of earthen-ware jars,
pots and vessels shall not overlay any that are pierced or cracked with
gypsum made into a paste with fat and white of egg and sell them as if
they were sound. If vessels of such description are found with one of
them, they shall be disciplined so as to deter others like them. . .
 <span id="fr_72"></span>[24](#fn_72.md)

 

*Punishments*: Know that the first order of the *ḥisba* is prohibition,
the second admonition and the third deterring and restraining. Deterring
is for the future, punishment for the past, and restraining for the
present and current. It is not for one of the subjects \[common people\]
to do anything more than restrain. . . . What goes beyond stopping
illegal acts . . . pertains to the authorities.

Admonition is useless from one who does not admonish himself, and we say
that one who knows his words will not be accepted, because the people
know of his delinquency, should not undertake the *ḥisba* by
admonishing, since there is no good in his admonishment. How shall one
who is not himself honest make others honest? . . .

The second stage is putting the fear of God (in the culprit) and
threatening him with physical punishment until he is deterred from what
he is doing. . . .

The third is reviling him and upbraiding him with rough words, though
not (libellously) but with words that do not count as moral excess, such
as "Libertine!" "Stupid!" "Ignorant! Will you not fear God?" "Loose of
morals!" and that sort of thing, for if he is a libertine he is
stupid--if he were not, why would he offend God? . .  <span
