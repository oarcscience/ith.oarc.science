### 2. *The Zaydīs*

The Shī‘a began as the partisans of ‘Alī, but it received its greatest
impetus from the violent death of his younger son, al-Ḥusayn. Al-Ḥasan,
the eldest, had been proclaimed 'Alī's successor by the partisans, but
Mu‘āwiya easily persuaded him to exchange his claim for a large pension
and retirement in Medina. In A.D. 669, Ḥasan died, of natural causes
according to the Sunnīs; the Shī‘a hold that he was poisoned. The
headship of the family fell now to his brother Ḥusayn. When he refused
to acknowledge Mu‘āwiya's son Yazid as Caliph in A.H. 61/A.D. 680, the
inhabitants of his father's former capital, Kūfa, offered to make him
Caliph. He set out from Medina across the desert to Iraq, but in the
meantime Yazīd's viceroy put down the insurrection at Kūfa and set
patrols on the approaches to the city. Ḥusayn walked into the trap with
his family and a few retainers at Karbala, some twenty-five miles from
Kūfa. As the Prophet's favorite and only surviving grandson, he
apparently did not expect to be seriously harmed, and refused to
surrender, although surrounded and cut off from water. After ten days,
the little band was cut down to the last man, and Ḥusayn's head sent to
Yazid in Damascus, who seems to have been genuinely shocked by the
affair. Muslims everywhere were appalled, and the "Martyrdom of Karbala"
became the rallying point of all who distrusted the Umawis. With many
moving and pitiful details, the story forms the basis of the "passion
plays" of the Tenth of *Muḥarram*, celebrated

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

by most Shī‘īs and many Sunnīs. Originally an Arab political faction,
the Shī‘a came to differ increasingly in doctrines from the Sunnīs.

Of the three major Shī‘ī sects surviving today, that of the Zaydīs most
preserves its old Arab character and seems to form a bridge between
Sunnī and Shī‘ī practice. Their name is traced to a grandson of
al-Ḥusayn, Zayd ibn ‘Alī Zayn al-‘Abidīn, who was also killed leading an
armed rebellion of the Kūfans, c. A.H. 121/A.D. 739. The sect traces its
law-school back to Zayd, but the real systematizers were two descendants
of al-Ḥasan: Ḥasan ibn Zayd (b. Muhammad b. Ḥasan b. Zayd b. ‘Alī b.
al-Ḥasan) and al-Qāsim al-Rassī, (died A.H. 246/A.D. 860). Ḥasan ibn
Zayd founded a Zaydī state on the mountainous Caspian seacoast of Persia
(c. A.H. 250/A.D. 864) which at least produced claimants to the
*Imāmate* until c. A.H. 520/A.D. 1126. At around the same time another
Zaydī *Imāmate* was founded in the highlands of Yemen, c. A.H. 288/A.D.
901, which with many vicissitudes has endured until the present day,
making it the oldest Muslim state.

Like the other Shī‘ī sects, the Zaydīs were profoundly influenced by
their contacts with the Mu‘tāzila, and believe that God has no eternal
and uncreated attributes, and that the Qur’ān is created. They also for
the most part do not accept predestination.

In law, they hold to a fundamental strictness of observance. Like the
other Shī‘a, they differ in some ritual matters from the Sunnīs: in the
matter of ablutions, and the call to prayer. They are hostile to Ṡūfīsm,
and Ṡūfī orders have been banned in the Yemen. They prohibit mixed
marriages; they will not eat meat slaughtered by a non-Muslim and will
not pray behind any man not of known

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

piety. They consider their wars against Sunnīs as holy wars, but appear
to regard Sunnīs as "rebellious Muslims," rather than apostates.

Most curious is their doctrine of the *Imāmate*, which is midway between
that of the Sunnīs and the other Shī‘a. The *Imām* may not be a child,
or invisible, as in the other Shī‘ī sects; he must be able to lead the
holy war and defend the community, and must be a *mujtahid*. He may be
any descendant of ‘Alī, and the *Imāms* of Yemen have included
descendants of both Ḥasan and Ḥusayn. He is not impeccable or
infallible, and can be and has been deposed. There may be more than one
*Imām* at a time (as in two widely separated Zaydī states).

The traditions on the *Imāmate* are taken from one of the chief Zaydī
legal works, a commentary on the *Majmū‘* ascribed to Zayd ibn ‘Alī. The
second selection is from one of the early *ḥisba* manuals extant,
written by the Zaydī *Imām* al-Nāṡir li-al-Haqq (died A.H. 304/A.D. 917)
of the Caspian area. Not all of its provisions would be enforced today,
of course. The general picture it gives is of a society which must have
seemed excessively puritanical to many Sunnīs of the third century.

*Zaydī Traditions on the Imāmate*

Zayd ibn ‘Alī told me on the authority of his father Zayn al-‘Abidīn
from his grandfather al-Ḥusayn, peace be upon them all, that he said
"Whoever dies with no Imām dies as ignorant carrion, if the Imām (of
that time) is just, good, and pious." . . . And Muslim has published a
ḥadīth of Abū Hurayra, with one of Ibn 'Abbās, that the Prophet, God's
blessing be upon him and his family, and peace, said: "Whoever of you
sees something he dislikes in his commander, let him be patient, for
there is not one who arbitrarily (*shabaran*) abandons the Community
(jamā‘a) but dies as ignorant carrion." . . .

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

and he said "There is no obeying in what is rebellion against God;
obedience is only in the good." . . .

Zayd ibn ‘Alī related on the authority of his father and grandfather
from ‘Alī--peace be upon them all--that he said, "The Imām's duty is to
judge by what God sent down and to be just to the subjects. If he does
that, their duty is to hearken and obey, and to respond to his call, and
if the Imām does not judge by what God sent down, no obedience is due
him."

Zayd related . . . from ‘Alī that the Messenger of God--His blessing be
on him and his family, and peace, said "Wherever any ruler is hesitant
to deal with the needs of his people, God will be hesitant to deal with
his on the Day of Judgment."

I asked Zayd ibn ‘Alī about the Imāmate and he said: "It is among all
the Quraysh, and it may not be established without the oath of
allegiance of the Muslims. When they have taken allegiance, and the Imām
is good and pious, and knowledgeable in what is licit and illicit, then
obedience to him is a duty for the Muslims." <span
id="fr_156"></span>[3](#fn_156.md)

Zayd ibn ‘Alī told me on the authority of his father and grandfather
that ‘Alī (peace be upon them all) said: "There are five things for the
*Imām*: the Friday prayer, the Two Feasts (that of Sacrifice and that of
Fast-breaking), collecting the alms-tax and the *ḥudūd* (Qur’ānic
punishments), and judgment, and retaliation." <span
id="fr_157"></span>[4](#fn_157.md)

 

The *Muḥtasib* must give orders that the doors of the mosques be not
locked, or pictures painted on the mosques, and that they be not
decorated with gold or have appointments like churches and synagogues,
(*ka al-bī‘a*) or have curtains hung in them, or be ornamented with
stucco or otherwise, for all that is objectionable. The minarets of the
mosques shall not be raised higher than their roofs, and he shall order
any crenellations raised above the people's houses to be concealed. It
is related that the Prince of Believers, ‘Alī--the blessings of God be
upon him and his family, and peace--that he said: "The minarets of the
mosque shall not be raised above its walls." . . .

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

The *Muḥtasib* must forbid burial places to be used as mosques,
according to the teaching of the Prophet, God's blessing be upon him and
his family, and peace: "God has cursed the Jews because they take the
tombs of their prophets as mosques." And Ja‘far ibn Muhammad relates
from his ancestors, from ‘Alī--peace be upon him and his family--that he
said: "If you see legend-narrators (*qaṡṡās*) in the mosques, then
good-bye to Islam (*‘ala al-Islām al-Salām*)." . . . And no Jew or
Christian or Zoroastrian shall enter the mosques, even if the governor
is holding hearings there, and menstruating women shall not enter there,
or punishments be administered there. And he shall know the insignia of
all People of the House (of the Prophet), peace be upon them, and see to
it that the people of his district perform the prayers, and say twice at
the end of the prayer-call "There is no God but God" and at the
beginning of the prayer say it once, and drop the saying of "Amen" and
say "Hasten to the best of works" at the prayer-call and the beginning
of the prayers, and make them say "In the name of God the Merciful, the
Compassionate" out loud, and forbid them the *masḥ ‘alā al-khuffayn*
\[merely wiping the socks instead of washing the feet at the ablution;
permitted by some schools.--ED.\] and order them to say "God is most
great," five times at funerals \[instead of four\].

The *Muḥtasib* must also forbid carpenters and turners to make
backgammon and chess sets, and sets for "fourteen," as it is a (sort of)
lottery. It is mentioned of the Prince of Believers (‘Alī), that he
would say "Peace be upon thee" to all who passed by him; even boys, and
Abyssinians wearing necklaces, but he would not greet the owner of a
backgammon-game or a chess-set, and that he once passed some people
playing chess and said, "What are these images to which you apply
yourselves?" and he ordered the chess-set to be broken and burnt the
board on which they played.

And he shall order that they make unto themselves no idol or image or
doll for children, and he shall break whatever he finds of such things.

And they shall not take unto themselves hand-drums or pipes or lutes or
tambourines or mandolines or timbals or

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

any other musical instrument, and whatever is confiscated of this nature
shall be broken; their makers shall be instructed in this, according to
the Prophet's instructions, the benediction of God be upon him and his
family, to "I send you as God sent me, to break flutes and lutes, and to
level heaped-up graves."

Similarly with anything with pictures on it, such as glass or other
things; he shall order them to be rubbed out, and if they cannot be
rubbed out except by breaking them, break them. Likewise with any
pictures on doors or garments; he shall cut off the heads of the
pictures. Similarly he shall break coins minted by foreigners on which
are pictures. And he shall forbid men to mix with women in the markets
and streets. <span id="fr_158"></span>[5](#fn_158.md)
