### 5. *The Rejecting of the Reprehensible* (Al-nāhī ‘an al-munkar)

Among things reprehensible there are degrees: *ḥarām*, which means
positively tabu, and *makrūh*, or disapproved.

 

*Prohibited Liquors*: \[It should be noted that al-Marghinānī, a Ḥanafī,
is taking a particularly liberal view as to what constitutes

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

forbidden beverages, since he indicates that drinks made from honey or
grain may legally be considered as falling outside the prohibition on
wine. Most lawyers do not agree with him.\]

The first of these is *khamr* (wine) meaning, according to Abū Ḥanīfa,
the juice of the grape fermented. . . . Others maintain that *khamr* is
applicable to whatever is of an inebriating quality, because it is
mentioned in the traditions that "Whatever inebriates is *khamr*," and
in another tradition "*Khamr* is produced from two trees, namely the
vine and the date-palm. . . ."

*Khamr* is in itself unlawful whether it be used . . . even in so small
a quantity as not to be sufficient to intoxicate; yet the same law does
not apply to other things of an inebriating quality, for a little of
them, if not sufficient to intoxicate, is not forbidden. Al-Shāfi‘ī,
indeed, is of the opinion that these are likewise unlawful in any
quantity.

*Khamr* is filth in an extreme degree, in the same manner as urine; for
the illegality of it is indisputably proven.

Whosoever maintains *khamr* to be lawful is an infidel (and exposed to
the penalty for apostacy), for he rejects incontestable proof.

It cannot constitute property with a Muslim, and if it is destroyed or
usurped by any person there is no responsibility. The sale of it is
moreover unlawful (for a Muslim, but not for People of the Book). . . .
Whoever drinks *khamr* incurs punishment, although he be not
intoxicated, for it is said in the traditions, "Let him who drinks
*khamr* be whipped, and if he drinks it again, let him be again in the
same manner punished." The whole of the Companions are agreed upon this
point, and the number of stripes prescribed is eighty. . . .

If a person boil *khamr* until two-thirds of it evaporate, it is not
thereby rendered lawful. If, however, a person drink of it after such a
process he is not liable to punishment unless he is intoxicated. . . .

Liquor produced by means of honey, wheat, barley, or millet is lawful,
according to Abū Ḥanīfa and Abū Yūsuf, although it be not boiled,
provided it not be drunk in a wanton manner. The argument they adduce is
the saying of the

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Prophet, "*Khamr*
is the product of these two trees" (meaning the vine and the date-palm).
. . . It has likewise been disputed whether a person who gets drunk with
any of these liquors is to be punished. Some have said he is not; the
learned in the Law, however, have determined otherwise <span

*Disapproved Things*: It is disapproved to distinguish the sentences of
the Qur’ān with marks or insert in it the points or short vowels.
Nevertheless the learned . . . have said it is proper when done for the
use of a non-Arab.

There is no impropriety in a polytheist entering the Inviolate Mosque
(at Mecca). Shāfi‘ī holds it to be disapproved, and Mālik has said it is
improper for such to enter any mosque. The argument of Shāfi‘ī . . . is
that God says: "Those who associate anyone with God are impure, and must
not be permitted to enter the Inviolate Mosque." Another argument (used
by Mālik) is that an unbeliever is never free from impurity as he does
not perform ablution in such a manner as to work a purification, and an
impure man is not allowed to enter (any) mosque. . . . The argument of
our (Ḥanafī) doctors on this point is drawn from a tradition that the
Prophet lodged several of the tribe of Thaqīf who were unbelievers in
his own mosque. As the impurity of an unbeliever lies in his unbelief,
he does not thereby defile a mosque.

. . . It is disapproved for a Muslim to keep eunuchs in his service, as
the employment of them is a motive with men to reduce others to a like
state, a practice which is proscribed in the Law.

. . . There is no impropriety in visiting a Jew or Christian in their
illness . . . the Law does not prohibit us from thus consoling them.

. . . It is disapproved to say in a prayer, "I beseech thee, Oh God, by
the right of (any person or prophet)," because none of His creatures is
possessed of any right with respect to the Creator.

. . . It is disapproved to play at chess, dice, or any other game, for
if anything be staked it is gambling, which is expressly prohibited in
the Qur’ān; or if on the other hand nothing is hazarded, it is useless
and vain. . . . Several of the

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

learned, however, deem the game of chess to be allowed as having a
tendency to quicken the understanding. . . .

There is no impropriety in selling the juice of dates or grapes to a
person whom the seller may know intends making wine of it, for the evil
does not exist in the juice but in the liquor after it has been
essentially changed. The case is different with respect to selling arms
at a time of tumult, since in that instance the evil is established and
exists in the original thing, arms being the instruments of sedition and
rebellion <span id="fr_75"></span>[27](#fn_75.md)
