<A NAME="an_068_001">1</A>&nbsp;Nun. By the pen and that which they write (therewith), </P>
<A NAME="an_068_002">2</A>&nbsp;Thou art not, for thy Lord's favour unto thee, a madman. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_003">3</A>&nbsp;And lo! thine verily will be a reward unfailing. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_004">4</A>&nbsp;And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_005">5</A>&nbsp;And thou wilt see and they will see </P>
<A NAME="an_068_006">6</A>&nbsp;Which of you is the demented. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_007">7</A>&nbsp;Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way, and He is  Best Aware of those who walk aright. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_008">8</A>&nbsp;Therefor obey not thou the rejecters </P>
<A NAME="an_068_009">9</A>&nbsp;Who would have had thee compromise, that they may compromise. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_010">10</A>&nbsp;Neither obey thou each feeble oath-monger, </P>
<A NAME="an_068_011">11</A>&nbsp;Detracter, spreader abroad of slanders, </P>
<A NAME="an_068_012">12</A>&nbsp;Hinderer of the good, transgressor, malefactor </P>
<A NAME="an_068_013">13</A>&nbsp;Greedy therewithal, intrusive. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_014">14</A>&nbsp;It is because he is possessed of wealth and children </P>
<A NAME="an_068_015">15</A>&nbsp;That, when Our revelations are recited unto him, he saith: Mere fables of the  men of old. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_016">16</A>&nbsp;We shall brand him on the nose. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_017">17</A>&nbsp;Lo! We have tried them as We tried the owners of the garden when they  vowed that they would pluck its fruit next morning, </P>
<A NAME="an_068_018">18</A>&nbsp;And made no exception (for the Will of Allah); </P>
<A NAME="an_068_019">19</A>&nbsp;Then a visitation from thy Lord came upon it while they slept </P>
<A NAME="an_068_020">20</A>&nbsp;And in the morning it was as if plucked. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_021">21</A>&nbsp;And they cried out one unto another in the morning, </P>
<A NAME="an_068_022">22</A>&nbsp;Saying: Run unto your field if ye would pluck (the fruit). </P>
<A NAME="an_068_023">23</A>&nbsp;So they went off, saying one unto another in low tones: </P>
<A NAME="an_068_024">24</A>&nbsp;No needy man shall enter it to-day against you. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_025">25</A>&nbsp;They went betimes, strong in (this) purpose. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_026">26</A>&nbsp;But when they saw it, they said: Lo! we are in error! </P>
<A NAME="an_068_027">27</A>&nbsp;Nay, but we are desolate! </P>
<A NAME="an_068_028">28</A>&nbsp;The best among them said: Said I not unto you: Why glorify ye not (Allah) ? </P>
<A NAME="an_068_029">29</A>&nbsp;They said: Glorified be our Lord! Lo! we have been wrong-doers. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_030">30</A>&nbsp;Then some of them drew near unto others, self-reproaching. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_031">31</A>&nbsp;They said: Alas for us! In truth we were outrageous. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_032">32</A>&nbsp;It may be that our Lord will give us better than this in place thereof. Lo! we  beseech our Lord. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_033">33</A>&nbsp;Such was the punishment. And verily the punishment of the Hereafter is  greater if they did but know. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_034">34</A>&nbsp;Lo! for those who keep from evil are gardens of bliss with their Lord. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_035">35</A>&nbsp;Shall We then treat those who have surrendered as We treat the guilty ? </P>
<A NAME="an_068_036">36</A>&nbsp;What aileth you ? How foolishly ye judge! </P>
<A NAME="an_068_037">37</A>&nbsp;Or have ye a scripture wherein ye learn </P>
<A NAME="an_068_038">38</A>&nbsp;That ye shall indeed have all that ye choose ? </P>
<A NAME="an_068_039">39</A>&nbsp;Or have ye a covenant on oath from Us that reacheth to the Day of Judgment,  that yours shall be all that ye ordain ? </P>
<A NAME="an_068_040">40</A>&nbsp;Ask them (O Muhammad) which of them will vouch for that! </P>
<A NAME="an_068_041">41</A>&nbsp;Or have they other gods ? Then let them bring their other gods if they are  truthful </P>
<A NAME="an_068_042">42</A>&nbsp;On the day when it befalleth in earnest, and they are ordered to prostrate  themselves but are not able, </P>
<A NAME="an_068_043">43</A>&nbsp;With eyes downcast, abasement stupefying them. And they had been  summoned to prostrate themselves while they were yet unhurt. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_044">44</A>&nbsp;Leave Me (to deal) with those who give the lie to this pronouncement. We  shall lead them on by steps from whence they know not. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_045">45</A>&nbsp;Yet I bear with them, for lo! My scheme is firm. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_046">46</A>&nbsp;Or dost thou (Muhammad) ask a fee from them so that they are heavily taxed  ? </P>
<A NAME="an_068_047">47</A>&nbsp;Or is the Unseen theirs that they can write (thereof) ? </P>
<A NAME="an_068_048">48</A>&nbsp;But wait thou for thy Lord's decree, and be not like him of the fish, who cried  out in despair. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_049">49</A>&nbsp;Had it not been that favour from his Lord had reached him he surely had  been cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_050">50</A>&nbsp;But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous. </P>
<A NAME="an_068_051">51</A>&nbsp;And lo! those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee with their eyes  when they hear the Reminder, and they say: Lo! he is indeed mad; </P>
<A NAME="an_068_052">52</A>&nbsp;When it is naught else than a Reminder to creation.
