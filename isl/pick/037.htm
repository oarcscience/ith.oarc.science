<A NAME="an_037_001">1</A>&nbsp;By those who set the ranks in battle order </P>
<A NAME="an_037_002">2</A>&nbsp;And those who drive away (the wicked) with reproof </P>
<A NAME="an_037_003">3</A>&nbsp;And those who read (the Word) for a reminder, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_004">4</A>&nbsp;Lo! thy Lord is surely One; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_005">5</A>&nbsp;Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them, and Lord  of the sun's risings. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_006">6</A>&nbsp;Lo! We have adorned the lowest heaven with an ornament, the planets; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_007">7</A>&nbsp;With security from every froward devil. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_008">8</A>&nbsp;They cannot listen to the Highest Chiefs for they are pelted from every side, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_009">9</A>&nbsp;Outcast, and theirs is a perpetual torment; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_010">10</A>&nbsp;Save him who snatcheth a fragment, and there pursueth him a piercing flame. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_011">11</A>&nbsp;Then ask them (O Muhammad): Are they stronger as a creation, or those  (others) whom we have created ? Lo! We created them of plastic clay. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_012">12</A>&nbsp;Nay, but thou dost marvel when they mock </P>
<A NAME="an_037_013">13</A>&nbsp;And heed not when they are reminded, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_014">14</A>&nbsp;And seek to scoff when they behold a portent. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_015">15</A>&nbsp;And they say: Lo! this is mere magic; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_016">16</A>&nbsp;When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth,  be raised (again) ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_017">17</A>&nbsp;And our forefathers ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_018">18</A>&nbsp;Say (O Muhammad): Ye, in truth; and ye will be brought low. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_019">19</A>&nbsp;There is but one Shout, and lo! they behold, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_020">20</A>&nbsp;And say: Ah, woe for us! This is the Day of Judgment. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_021">21</A>&nbsp;This is the Day of Separation, which ye used to deny. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_022">22</A>&nbsp;(And it is said unto the angels): Assemble those who did wrong, together  with their wives and what they used to worship </P>
<A NAME="an_037_023">23</A>&nbsp;Instead of Allah, and lead them to the path to hell; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_024">24</A>&nbsp;And stop them, for they must be questioned. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_025">25</A>&nbsp;What aileth you that ye help not one another ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_026">26</A>&nbsp;Nay, but this day they make full submission. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_027">27</A>&nbsp;And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_028">28</A>&nbsp;They say: Lo! ye used to come unto us, imposing, (swearing that ye spoke  the truth). </P>
<A NAME="an_037_029">29</A>&nbsp;They answer: Nay, but ye (yourselves) were not believers. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_030">30</A>&nbsp;We had no power over you, but ye were wayward folk. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_031">31</A>&nbsp;Now the Word of our Lord hath been fulfilled concerning us. Lo! we are  about to taste (the doom). </P>
<A NAME="an_037_032">32</A>&nbsp;Thus we misled you. Lo! we were (ourselves) astray. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_033">33</A>&nbsp;Then lo! this day they (both) are sharers in the doom. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_034">34</A>&nbsp;Lo! thus deal We with the guilty. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_035">35</A>&nbsp;For when it was said unto them, There is no God save Allah, they were  scornful </P>
<A NAME="an_037_036">36</A>&nbsp;And said: Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_037">37</A>&nbsp;Nay, but he brought the Truth, and he confirmed those sent (before him). </P>
<A NAME="an_037_038">38</A>&nbsp;Lo! (now) verily ye taste the painful doom - </P>
<A NAME="an_037_039">39</A>&nbsp;Ye are requited naught save what ye did - </P>
<A NAME="an_037_040">40</A>&nbsp;Save single-minded slaves of Allah; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_041">41</A>&nbsp;For them there is a known provision, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_042">42</A>&nbsp;Fruits. And they will be honoured </P>
<A NAME="an_037_043">43</A>&nbsp;In the Gardens of delight, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_044">44</A>&nbsp;On couches facing one another; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_045">45</A>&nbsp;A cup from a gushing spring is brought round for them, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_046">46</A>&nbsp;White, delicious to the drinkers, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_047">47</A>&nbsp;Wherein there is no headache nor are they made mad thereby. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_048">48</A>&nbsp;And with them are those of modest gaze, with lovely eyes, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_049">49</A>&nbsp;(Pure) as they were hidden eggs (of the ostrich). </P>
<A NAME="an_037_050">50</A>&nbsp;And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_051">51</A>&nbsp;A speaker of them saith: Lo! I had a comrade </P>
<A NAME="an_037_052">52</A>&nbsp;Who used to say: Art thou in truth of those who put faith (in his words) ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_053">53</A>&nbsp;Can we, when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones - can we  (then) verily be brought to book ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_054">54</A>&nbsp;He saith: Will ye look ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_055">55</A>&nbsp;Then looketh he and seeth him in the depth of hell. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_056">56</A>&nbsp;He saith: By Allah, thou verily didst all but cause my ruin, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_057">57</A>&nbsp;And had it not been for the favour of my Lord, I too had been of those haled  forth (to doom). </P>
<A NAME="an_037_058">58</A>&nbsp;Are we then not to die </P>
<A NAME="an_037_059">59</A>&nbsp;Saving our former death, and are we not to be punished ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_060">60</A>&nbsp;Lo! this is the supreme triumph. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_061">61</A>&nbsp;For the like of this, then, let the workers work. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_062">62</A>&nbsp;Is this better as a welcome, or the tree of Zaqqum ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_063">63</A>&nbsp;Lo! We have appointed it a torment for wrong-doers. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_064">64</A>&nbsp;Lo! it is a tree that springeth in the heart of hell. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_065">65</A>&nbsp;Its crop is as it were the heads of devils </P>
<A NAME="an_037_066">66</A>&nbsp;And lo! they verily must eat thereof, and fill (their) bellies therewith. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_067">67</A>&nbsp;And afterward, lo! thereupon they have a drink of boiling water </P>
<A NAME="an_037_068">68</A>&nbsp;And afterward, lo! their return is surely unto hell. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_069">69</A>&nbsp;They indeed found their fathers astray, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_070">70</A>&nbsp;But they make haste (to follow) in their footsteps. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_071">71</A>&nbsp;And verily most of the men of old went astray before them, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_072">72</A>&nbsp;And verily We sent among them warners. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_073">73</A>&nbsp;Then see the nature of the consequence for those warned, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_074">74</A>&nbsp;Save single-minded slaves of Allah. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_075">75</A>&nbsp;And Noah verily prayed unto Us, and gracious was the Hearer of his prayer </P>
<A NAME="an_037_076">76</A>&nbsp;And We saved him and his household from the great distress, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_077">77</A>&nbsp;And made his seed the survivors, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_078">78</A>&nbsp;And left for him among the later folk (the salutation): </P>
<A NAME="an_037_079">79</A>&nbsp;Peace be unto Noah among the peoples! </P>
<A NAME="an_037_080">80</A>&nbsp;Lo! thus do We reward the good. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_081">81</A>&nbsp;Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_082">82</A>&nbsp;Then We did drown the others. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_083">83</A>&nbsp;And lo! of his persuasion verily was Abraham </P>
<A NAME="an_037_084">84</A>&nbsp;When he came unto his Lord with a whole heart; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_085">85</A>&nbsp;When he said unto his father and his folk: What is it that ye worship ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_086">86</A>&nbsp;Is it a falsehood - gods beside Allah - that ye desire ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_087">87</A>&nbsp;What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_088">88</A>&nbsp;And he glanced a glance at the stars </P>
<A NAME="an_037_089">89</A>&nbsp;Then said: Lo! I feel sick! </P>
<A NAME="an_037_090">90</A>&nbsp;And they turned their backs and went away from him. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_091">91</A>&nbsp;Then turned he to their gods and said: Will ye not eat ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_092">92</A>&nbsp;What aileth you that ye speak not ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_093">93</A>&nbsp;Then he attacked them, striking with his right hand. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_094">94</A>&nbsp;And (his people) came toward him, hastening. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_095">95</A>&nbsp;He said: Worship ye that which ye yourselves do carve </P>
<A NAME="an_037_096">96</A>&nbsp;When Allah hath created you and what ye make ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_097">97</A>&nbsp;They said: Build for him a building and fling him in the red-hotfire. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_098">98</A>&nbsp;And they designed a snare for him, but We made them the undermost. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_099">99</A>&nbsp;And he said: Lo! I am going unto my Lord Who will guide me. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_100">100</A>&nbsp;My Lord! Vouchsafe me of the righteous. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_101">101</A>&nbsp;So We gave him tidings of a gentle son. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_102">102</A>&nbsp;And when (his son) was old enough to walk with him, (Abraham) said: O my  dear son, I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice thee. So look, what thinkest thou  ? He said: O my father! Do that which thou art commanded. Allah willing, thou shalt  find me of the steadfast. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_103">103</A>&nbsp;Then, when they had both surrendered (to Allah), and he had flung him down  upon his face, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_104">104</A>&nbsp;We called unto him: O Abraham! </P>
<A NAME="an_037_105">105</A>&nbsp;Thou hast already fulfilled the vision. Lo! thus do We reward the good. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_106">106</A>&nbsp;Lo! that verily was a clear test. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_107">107</A>&nbsp;Then We ransomed him with a tremendous victim. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_108">108</A>&nbsp;And We left for him among the later folk (the salutation): </P>
<A NAME="an_037_109">109</A>&nbsp;Peace be unto Abraham! </P>
<A NAME="an_037_110">110</A>&nbsp;Thus do We reward the good. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_111">111</A>&nbsp;Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_112">112</A>&nbsp;And we gave him tidings of the birth of Isaac, a prophet of the righteous. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_113">113</A>&nbsp;And We blessed him and Isaac. And of their seed are some who do good, and  some who plainly wrong themselves. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_114">114</A>&nbsp;And We verily gave grace unto Moses and Aaron, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_115">115</A>&nbsp;And saved them and their people from the great distress, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_116">116</A>&nbsp;And helped them so that they became the victors. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_117">117</A>&nbsp;And We gave them the clear Scripture </P>
<A NAME="an_037_118">118</A>&nbsp;And showed them the right path. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_119">119</A>&nbsp;And We left for them among the later folk (the salutation): </P>
<A NAME="an_037_120">120</A>&nbsp;Peace be unto Moses and Aaron! </P>
<A NAME="an_037_121">121</A>&nbsp;Lo! thus do We reward the good. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_122">122</A>&nbsp;Lo! they are two of Our believing slaves. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_123">123</A>&nbsp;And lo! Elias was of those sent (to warn), </P>
<A NAME="an_037_124">124</A>&nbsp;When he said unto his folk: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_125">125</A>&nbsp;Will ye cry unto Baal and forsake the Best of creators, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_126">126</A>&nbsp;Allah, your Lord and Lord of your forefathers ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_127">127</A>&nbsp;But they denied him, so they surely will be haled forth (to the doom) </P>
<A NAME="an_037_128">128</A>&nbsp;Save single-minded slaves of Allah. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_129">129</A>&nbsp;And we left for him among the later folk (the salutation): </P>
<A NAME="an_037_130">130</A>&nbsp;Peace be unto Elias! </P>
<A NAME="an_037_131">131</A>&nbsp;Lo! thus do We reward the good. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_132">132</A>&nbsp;Lo! he is one of our believing slaves. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_133">133</A>&nbsp;And lo! Lot verily was of those sent (to warn). </P>
<A NAME="an_037_134">134</A>&nbsp;When We saved him and his household, every one, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_135">135</A>&nbsp;Save an old woman among those who stayed behind; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_136">136</A>&nbsp;Then We destroyed the others. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_137">137</A>&nbsp;And lo! ye verily pass by (the ruin of) them in the morning </P>
<A NAME="an_037_138">138</A>&nbsp;And at night-time; have ye then no sense ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_139">139</A>&nbsp;And lo! Jonah verily was of those sent (to warn) </P>
<A NAME="an_037_140">140</A>&nbsp;When he fled unto the laden ship, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_141">141</A>&nbsp;And then drew lots and was of those rejected; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_142">142</A>&nbsp;And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_143">143</A>&nbsp;And had he not been one of those who glorify (Allah) </P>
<A NAME="an_037_144">144</A>&nbsp;He would have tarried in its belly till the day when they are raised; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_145">145</A>&nbsp;Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_146">146</A>&nbsp;And We caused a tree of gourd to grow above him; </P>
<A NAME="an_037_147">147</A>&nbsp;And We sent him to a hundred thousand (folk) or more </P>
<A NAME="an_037_148">148</A>&nbsp;And they believed, therefor We gave them comfort for a while. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_149">149</A>&nbsp;Now ask them (O Muhammad): Hath thy Lord daughters whereas they have  sons ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_150">150</A>&nbsp;Or created We the angels females while they were present ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_151">151</A>&nbsp;Lo! it is of their falsehood that they say: </P>
<A NAME="an_037_152">152</A>&nbsp;Allah hath begotten. Allah! verily they tell a lie. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_153">153</A>&nbsp;(And again of their falsehood): He hath preferred daughters to sons. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_154">154</A>&nbsp;What aileth you ? How judge ye ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_155">155</A>&nbsp;Will ye not then reflect ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_156">156</A>&nbsp;Or have ye a clear warrant ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_157">157</A>&nbsp;Then produce your writ, if ye are truthful. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_158">158</A>&nbsp;And they imagine kinship between him and the jinn, whereas the jinn know  well that they will be brought before (Him). </P>
<A NAME="an_037_159">159</A>&nbsp;Glorified be Allah from that which they attribute (unto Him), </P>
<A NAME="an_037_160">160</A>&nbsp;Save single-minded slaves of Allah. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_161">161</A>&nbsp;Lo! verily, ye and that which ye worship, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_162">162</A>&nbsp;Ye cannot excite (anyone) against Him. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_163">163</A>&nbsp;Save him who is to burn in hell. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_164">164</A>&nbsp;There is not one of us but hath his known position. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_165">165</A>&nbsp;Lo! we, even we are they who set the ranks, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_166">166</A>&nbsp;Lo! we, even we are they who hymn His praise </P>
<A NAME="an_037_167">167</A>&nbsp;And indeed they used to say: </P>
<A NAME="an_037_168">168</A>&nbsp;If we had but a reminder from the men of old </P>
<A NAME="an_037_169">169</A>&nbsp;We would be single-minded slaves of Allah. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_170">170</A>&nbsp;Yet (now that it is come) they disbelieve therein; but they will come to know. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_171">171</A>&nbsp;And verily Our word went forth of old unto Our bondmen sent (to warn) </P>
<A NAME="an_037_172">172</A>&nbsp;That they verily would be helped, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_173">173</A>&nbsp;And that Our host, they verily would be the victors. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_174">174</A>&nbsp;So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) awhile, </P>
<A NAME="an_037_175">175</A>&nbsp;And watch, for they will (soon) see. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_176">176</A>&nbsp;Would they hasten on Our doom ? </P>
<A NAME="an_037_177">177</A>&nbsp;But when it cometh home to them, then it will be a hapless morn for those  who have been warned. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_178">178</A>&nbsp;Withdraw from them awhile </P>
<A NAME="an_037_179">179</A>&nbsp;And watch, for they will (soon) see. </P>
<A NAME="an_037_180">180</A>&nbsp;Glorified be thy Lord, the Lord of Majesty, from that which they attribute  (unto Him) </P>
<A NAME="an_037_181">181</A>&nbsp;And peace be unto those sent (to warn). </P>
<A NAME="an_037_182">182</A>&nbsp;And praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds!
