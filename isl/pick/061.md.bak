# 61. as-Saff: The Ranks

<span id="an_061_001">1</span> All that is in the heavens and all that
is in the earth glorifieth Allah, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.

<span id="an_061_002">2</span> O ye who believe! Why say ye that which
ye do not ?

<span id="an_061_003">3</span> It is most hateful in the sight of Allah
that ye say that which ye do not.

<span id="an_061_004">4</span> Lo! Allah loveth them who battle for His
cause in ranks, as if they were a solid structure.

<span id="an_061_005">5</span> And (remember) when Moses said unto his
people: O my people! Why persecute ye me, when ye well know that I am
Allah's messenger unto you ? So when they went astray Allah sent their
hearts astray. And Allah guideth not the evil-living folk.

<span id="an_061_006">6</span> And when Jesus son of Mary said: O
Children of Israel! Lo! I am the messenger of Allah unto you, confirming
that which was (revealed) before me in the Torah, and bringing good
tidings of a messenger who cometh after me, whose name is the Praised
One. Yet when he hath come unto them with clear proofs, they say: This
is mere magic.

<span id="an_061_007">7</span> And who doeth greater wrong than he who
inventeth a lie against Allah when he is summoned unto Al-Islam ? And
Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.

<span id="an_061_008">8</span> Fain would they put out the light of
Allah with their mouths, but Allah will perfect His light however much
the disbelievers are averse.

<span id="an_061_009">9</span> He it is Who hath sent His messenger with
the guidance and the religion of truth, that He may make it conqueror of
all religion however much idolaters may be averse.

<span id="an_061_010">10</span> O ye who believe! Shall I show you a
commerce that will save you from a painful doom ?

<span id="an_061_011">11</span> Ye should believe in Allah and His
messenger, and should strive for the cause of Allah with your wealth and
your lives. That is better for you, if ye did but know.

<span id="an_061_012">12</span> He will forgive you your sins and bring
you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in
Gardens of Eden. That is the supreme triumph.

<span id="an_061_013">13</span> And (He will give you) another
(blessing) which ye love: help from Allah and present victory. Give good
tidings (O Muhammad) to believers.

<span id="an_061_014">14</span> O ye who believe! Be Allah's helpers,
even as Jesus son of Mary said unto the disciples: Who are my helpers
for Allah ? They said: We are Allah's helpers. And a party of the
Children of Israel believed, while a party disbelieved. Then We
strengthened those who believed against their foe, and they became the
uppermost.
