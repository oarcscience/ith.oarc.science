# 44. ad-Dukhan: The Evident Smoke

<span id="an_044_001">1</span> Ha. Mim.

<span id="an_044_002">2</span> By the Scripture that maketh plain

<span id="an_044_003">3</span> Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night -
Lo! We are ever warning -

<span id="an_044_004">4</span> Whereon every wise command is made clear

<span id="an_044_005">5</span> As a command from Our presence - Lo! We
are ever sending -

<span id="an_044_006">6</span> A mercy from thy Lord. Lo! He, even He is
the Hearer, the Knower,

<span id="an_044_007">7</span> Lord of the heavens and the earth and all
that is between them, if ye would be sure.

<span id="an_044_008">8</span> There is no God save Him. He quickeneth
and giveth death; your Lord and Lord of your forefathers.

<span id="an_044_009">9</span> Nay, but they play in doubt.

<span id="an_044_010">10</span> But watch thou (O Muhammad) for the day
when the sky will produce visible smoke

<span id="an_044_011">11</span> That will envelop the people. This will
be a painful torment.

<span id="an_044_012">12</span> (Then they will say): Our Lord relieve
us of the torment. Lo! we are believers.

<span id="an_044_013">13</span> How can there be remembrance for them,
when a messenger making plain (the Truth) had already come unto them,

<span id="an_044_014">14</span> And they had turned away from him and
said: One taught (by others), a madman ?

<span id="an_044_015">15</span> Lo! We withdraw the torment a little.
Lo! ye return (to disbelief).

<span id="an_044_016">16</span> On the day when We shall seize them with
the greater seizure, (then) in truth We shall punish.

<span id="an_044_017">17</span> And verily We tried before them
Pharaoh's folk, when there came unto them a noble messenger,

<span id="an_044_018">18</span> Saying: Give up to me the slaves of
Allah. Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you.

<span id="an_044_019">19</span> And saying: Be not proud against Allah.
Lo! I bring you a clear warrant.

<span id="an_044_020">20</span> And lo! I have sought refuge in my Lord
and your Lord lest ye stone me to death.

<span id="an_044_021">21</span> And if ye put no faith in me, then let
me go.

<span id="an_044_022">22</span> And he cried unto his Lord, (saying):
These are guilty folk.

<span id="an_044_023">23</span> Then (his Lord commanded): Take away My
slaves by night. Lo! ye will be followed,

<span id="an_044_024">24</span> And leave the sea behind at rest, for
lo! they are a drowned host.

<span id="an_044_025">25</span> How many were the gardens and the
watersprings that they left behind,

<span id="an_044_026">26</span> And the cornlands and the goodly sites

<span id="an_044_027">27</span> And pleasant things wherein they took
delight!

<span id="an_044_028">28</span> Even so (it was), and We made it an
inheritance for other folk;

<span id="an_044_029">29</span> And the heaven and the earth wept not
for them, nor were they reprieved.

<span id="an_044_030">30</span> And We delivered the Children of Israel
from the shameful doom;

<span id="an_044_031">31</span> (We delivered them) from Pharaoh. Lo! he
was a tyrant of the wanton ones.

<span id="an_044_032">32</span> And We chose them, purposely, above
(all) creatures.

<span id="an_044_033">33</span> And We gave them portents wherein was a
clear trial.

<span id="an_044_034">34</span> Lo! these, forsooth, are saying:

<span id="an_044_035">35</span> There is naught but our first death, and
we shall not be raised again.

<span id="an_044_036">36</span> Bring back our fathers, if ye speak the
truth!

<span id="an_044_037">37</span> Are they better, or the folk of Tubb'a
and those before them ? We destroyed them, for surely they were guilty.

<span id="an_044_038">38</span> And We created not the heavens and the
earth, and all that is between them, in play.

<span id="an_044_039">39</span> We created them not save with truth; but
most of them know not.

<span id="an_044_040">40</span> Assuredly the Day of Decision is the
term for all of them,

<span id="an_044_041">41</span> A day when friend can in naught avail
friend, nor can they be helped,

<span id="an_044_042">42</span> Save him on whom Allah hath mercy. Lo!
He is the Mighty, the Merciful.

<span id="an_044_043">43</span> Lo! the tree of Zaqqum,

<span id="an_044_044">44</span> The food of the sinner!

<span id="an_044_045">45</span> Like molten brass, it seetheth in their
bellies

<span id="an_044_046">46</span> As the seething of boiling water.

<span id="an_044_047">47</span> (And it will be said): Take him and drag
him to the midst of hell,

<span id="an_044_048">48</span> Then pour upon his head the torment of
boiling water.

<span id="an_044_049">49</span> (Saying): Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth
the mighty, the noble!

<span id="an_044_050">50</span> Lo! this is that whereof ye used to
doubt.

<span id="an_044_051">51</span> Lo! those who kept their duty will be in
a place secured.

<span id="an_044_052">52</span> Amid gardens and watersprings,

<span id="an_044_053">53</span> Attired in silk and silk embroidery,
facing one another.

<span id="an_044_054">54</span> Even so (it will be). And We shall wed
them unto fair ones with wide, lovely eyes.

<span id="an_044_055">55</span> They call therein for every fruit in
safety.

<span id="an_044_056">56</span> They taste not death therein, save the
first death. And He hath saved them from the doom of hell,

<span id="an_044_057">57</span> A bounty from thy Lord. That is the
supreme triumph.

<span id="an_044_058">58</span> And We have made (this Scripture) easy
in thy language only that they may heed.

<span id="an_044_059">59</span> Wait then (O Muhammad). Lo! they (too)
are waiting.
