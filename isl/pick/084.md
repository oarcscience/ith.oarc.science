# 84. al-Inshiqaq: The Rending

<span id="an_084_001">1</span> When the heaven is split asunder

<span id="an_084_002">2</span> And attentive to her Lord in fear,

<span id="an_084_003">3</span> And when the earth is spread out

<span id="an_084_004">4</span> And hath cast out all that was in her,
and is empty

<span id="an_084_005">5</span> And attentive to her Lord in fear!

<span id="an_084_006">6</span> Thou, verily, O man, art working toward
thy Lord a work which thou wilt meet (in His presence).

<span id="an_084_007">7</span> Then whoso is given his account in his
right hand

<span id="an_084_008">8</span> He truly will receive an easy reckoning

<span id="an_084_009">9</span> And will return unto his folk in joy.

<span id="an_084_010">10</span> But whoso is given his account behind
his back,

<span id="an_084_011">11</span> He surely will invoke destruction

<span id="an_084_012">12</span> And be thrown to scorching fire.

<span id="an_084_013">13</span> He verily lived joyous with his folk,

<span id="an_084_014">14</span> He verily deemed that he would never
return (unto Allah).

<span id="an_084_015">15</span> Nay, but lo! his Lord is ever looking on
him!

<span id="an_084_016">16</span> Oh, I swear by the afterglow of sunset,

<span id="an_084_017">17</span> And by the night and all that it
enshroudeth,

<span id="an_084_018">18</span> And by the moon when she is at the full,

<span id="an_084_019">19</span> That ye shall journey on from plane to
plane.

<span id="an_084_020">20</span> What aileth them, then, that they
believe not

<span id="an_084_021">21</span> And, when the Qur'an is recited unto
them, worship not (Allah) ?

<span id="an_084_022">22</span> Nay, but those who disbelieve will deny;

<span id="an_084_023">23</span> And Allah knoweth best what they are
hiding.

<span id="an_084_024">24</span> So give them tidings of a painful doom,

<span id="an_084_025">25</span> Save those who believe and do good
works, for theirs is a reward unfailing.
