# 50. Qaf: Qaf

<span id="an_050_001">1</span> Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an,

<span id="an_050_002">2</span> Nay, but they marvel that a warner of
their own hath come unto them; and the disbelievers say: This is a
strange thing:

<span id="an_050_003">3</span> When we are dead and have become dust
(shall we be brought back again) ? That would be a far return!

<span id="an_050_004">4</span> We know that which the earth taketh of
them, and with Us is a recording Book.

<span id="an_050_005">5</span> Nay, but they have denied the truth when
it came unto them, therefor they are now in troubled case.

<span id="an_050_006">6</span> Have they not then observed the sky above
them, how We have constructed it and beautified it, and how there are no
rifts therein ?

<span id="an_050_007">7</span> And the earth have We spread out, and
have flung firm hills therein, and have caused of every lovely kind to
grow thereon,

<span id="an_050_008">8</span> A vision and a reminder for every
penitent slave.

<span id="an_050_009">9</span> And We send down from the sky blessed
water whereby We give growth unto gardens and the grain of crops,

<span id="an_050_010">10</span> And lofty date-palms with ranged
clusters,

<span id="an_050_011">11</span> Provision (made) for men; and therewith
We quicken a dead land. Even so will be the resurrection of the dead.

<span id="an_050_012">12</span> The folk of Noah denied (the truth)
before them, and (so did) the dwellers at Ar-Rass and (the tribe of)
Thamud,

<span id="an_050_013">13</span> And (the tribe of) A'ad, and Pharaoh,
and the brethren of Lot,

<span id="an_050_014">14</span> And the dwellers in the wood, and the
folk of Tubb'a: every one denied their messengers, therefor My threat
took effect.

<span id="an_050_015">15</span> Were We then worn out by the first
creation ? Yet they are in doubt about a new creation.

<span id="an_050_016">16</span> We verily created man and We know what
his soul whispereth to him, and We are nearer to him than his jugular
vein.

<span id="an_050_017">17</span> When the two Receivers receive (him),
seated on the right hand and on the left,

<span id="an_050_018">18</span> He uttereth no word but there is with
him an observer ready.

<span id="an_050_019">19</span> And the agony of death cometh in truth.
(And it is said unto him): This is that which thou wast wont to shun.

<span id="an_050_020">20</span> And the trumpet is blown. This is the
threatened Day.

<span id="an_050_021">21</span> And every soul cometh, along with it a
driver and a witness.

<span id="an_050_022">22</span> (And unto the evil-doer it is said):
Thou wast in heedlessness of this. Now We have removed from thee thy
covering, and piercing is thy sight this day.

<span id="an_050_023">23</span> And (unto the evil-doer) his comrade
saith: This is that which I have ready (as testimony).

<span id="an_050_024">24</span> (And it is said): Do ye twain hurl to
hell each rebel ingrate,

<span id="an_050_025">25</span> Hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter,

<span id="an_050_026">26</span> Who setteth up another god along with
Allah. Do ye twain hurl him to the dreadful doom.

<span id="an_050_027">27</span> His comrade saith: Our Lord! I did not
cause him to rebel, but he was (himself) far gone in error.

<span id="an_050_028">28</span> He saith: Contend not in My presence,
when I had already proffered unto you the warning.

<span id="an_050_029">29</span> The sentence that cometh from Me cannot
be changed, and I am in no wise a tyrant unto the slaves.

<span id="an_050_030">30</span> On the day when We say unto hell: Art
thou filled ? and it saith: Can there be more to come ?

<span id="an_050_031">31</span> And the Garden is brought nigh for those
who kept from evil, no longer distant.

<span id="an_050_032">32</span> (And it is said): This is that which ye
were promised. (It is) for every penitent and heedful one,

<span id="an_050_033">33</span> Who feareth the Beneficent in secret and
cometh with a contrite heart.

<span id="an_050_034">34</span> Enter it in peace. This is the day of
immortality.

<span id="an_050_035">35</span> There they have all that they desire,
and there is more with Us.

<span id="an_050_036">36</span> And how many a generation We destroyed
before them, who were mightier than these in prowess so that they
overran the lands! Had they any place of refuge (when the judgment came)
?

<span id="an_050_037">37</span> Lo! therein verily is a reminder for him
who hath a heart, or giveth ear with full intelligence.

<span id="an_050_038">38</span> And verily We created the heavens and
the earth, and all that is between them, in six Days, and naught of
weariness touched Us.

<span id="an_050_039">39</span> Therefor (O Muhammad) bear with what
they say, and hymn the praise of thy Lord before the rising and before
the setting of the sun;

<span id="an_050_040">40</span> And in the night-time hymn His praise,
and after the (prescribed) prostrations.

<span id="an_050_041">41</span> And listen on the day when the crier
crieth from a near place,

<span id="an_050_042">42</span> The day when they will hear the (Awful)
Cry in truth. That is the day of coming forth (from the graves).

<span id="an_050_043">43</span> Lo! We it is Who quicken and give death,
and unto Us is the journeying.

<span id="an_050_044">44</span> On the day when the earth splitteth
asunder from them, hastening forth (they come). That is a gathering easy
for Us (to make).

<span id="an_050_045">45</span> We are Best Aware of what they say, and
thou (O Muhammad) art in no wise a compeller over them. But warn by the
Qur'an him who feareth My threat.
