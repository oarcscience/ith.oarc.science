# 68. al-Qalam: The Pen

<span id="an_068_001">1</span> Nun. By the pen and that which they write
(therewith),

<span id="an_068_002">2</span> Thou art not, for thy Lord's favour unto
thee, a madman.

<span id="an_068_003">3</span> And lo! thine verily will be a reward
unfailing.

<span id="an_068_004">4</span> And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature.

<span id="an_068_005">5</span> And thou wilt see and they will see

<span id="an_068_006">6</span> Which of you is the demented.

<span id="an_068_007">7</span> Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who
strayeth from His way, and He is Best Aware of those who walk aright.

<span id="an_068_008">8</span> Therefor obey not thou the rejecters

<span id="an_068_009">9</span> Who would have had thee compromise, that
they may compromise.

<span id="an_068_010">10</span> Neither obey thou each feeble
oath-monger,

<span id="an_068_011">11</span> Detracter, spreader abroad of slanders,

<span id="an_068_012">12</span> Hinderer of the good, transgressor,
malefactor

<span id="an_068_013">13</span> Greedy therewithal, intrusive.

<span id="an_068_014">14</span> It is because he is possessed of wealth
and children

<span id="an_068_015">15</span> That, when Our revelations are recited
unto him, he saith: Mere fables of the men of old.

<span id="an_068_016">16</span> We shall brand him on the nose.

<span id="an_068_017">17</span> Lo! We have tried them as We tried the
owners of the garden when they vowed that they would pluck its fruit
next morning,

<span id="an_068_018">18</span> And made no exception (for the Will of
Allah);

<span id="an_068_019">19</span> Then a visitation from thy Lord came
upon it while they slept

<span id="an_068_020">20</span> And in the morning it was as if plucked.

<span id="an_068_021">21</span> And they cried out one unto another in
the morning,

<span id="an_068_022">22</span> Saying: Run unto your field if ye would
pluck (the fruit).

<span id="an_068_023">23</span> So they went off, saying one unto
another in low tones:

<span id="an_068_024">24</span> No needy man shall enter it to-day
against you.

<span id="an_068_025">25</span> They went betimes, strong in (this)
purpose.

<span id="an_068_026">26</span> But when they saw it, they said: Lo! we
are in error!

<span id="an_068_027">27</span> Nay, but we are desolate!

<span id="an_068_028">28</span> The best among them said: Said I not
unto you: Why glorify ye not (Allah) ?

<span id="an_068_029">29</span> They said: Glorified be our Lord! Lo! we
have been wrong-doers.

<span id="an_068_030">30</span> Then some of them drew near unto others,
self-reproaching.

<span id="an_068_031">31</span> They said: Alas for us! In truth we were
outrageous.

<span id="an_068_032">32</span> It may be that our Lord will give us
better than this in place thereof. Lo! we beseech our Lord.

<span id="an_068_033">33</span> Such was the punishment. And verily the
punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they did but know.

<span id="an_068_034">34</span> Lo! for those who keep from evil are
gardens of bliss with their Lord.

<span id="an_068_035">35</span> Shall We then treat those who have
surrendered as We treat the guilty ?

<span id="an_068_036">36</span> What aileth you ? How foolishly ye
judge!

<span id="an_068_037">37</span> Or have ye a scripture wherein ye learn

<span id="an_068_038">38</span> That ye shall indeed have all that ye
choose ?

<span id="an_068_039">39</span> Or have ye a covenant on oath from Us
that reacheth to the Day of Judgment, that yours shall be all that ye
ordain ?

<span id="an_068_040">40</span> Ask them (O Muhammad) which of them will
vouch for that!

<span id="an_068_041">41</span> Or have they other gods ? Then let them
bring their other gods if they are truthful

<span id="an_068_042">42</span> On the day when it befalleth in earnest,
and they are ordered to prostrate themselves but are not able,

<span id="an_068_043">43</span> With eyes downcast, abasement stupefying
them. And they had been summoned to prostrate themselves while they were
yet unhurt.

<span id="an_068_044">44</span> Leave Me (to deal) with those who give
the lie to this pronouncement. We shall lead them on by steps from
whence they know not.

<span id="an_068_045">45</span> Yet I bear with them, for lo! My scheme
is firm.

<span id="an_068_046">46</span> Or dost thou (Muhammad) ask a fee from
them so that they are heavily taxed ?

<span id="an_068_047">47</span> Or is the Unseen theirs that they can
write (thereof) ?

<span id="an_068_048">48</span> But wait thou for thy Lord's decree, and
be not like him of the fish, who cried out in despair.

<span id="an_068_049">49</span> Had it not been that favour from his
Lord had reached him he surely had been cast into the wilderness while
he was reprobate.

<span id="an_068_050">50</span> But his Lord chose him and placed him
among the righteous.

<span id="an_068_051">51</span> And lo! those who disbelieve would fain
disconcert thee with their eyes when they hear the Reminder, and they
say: Lo! he is indeed mad;

<span id="an_068_052">52</span> When it is naught else than a Reminder
to creation.
