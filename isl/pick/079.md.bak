# 79. an-Nazi\`at: Those Who Pull Out

<span id="an_079_001">1</span> By those who drag forth to destruction,

<span id="an_079_002">2</span> By the meteors rushing,

<span id="an_079_003">3</span> By the lone stars floating,

<span id="an_079_004">4</span> By the angels hastening,

<span id="an_079_005">5</span> And those who govern the event,

<span id="an_079_006">6</span> On the day when the first trump
resoundeth.

<span id="an_079_007">7</span> And the second followeth it,

<span id="an_079_008">8</span> On that day hearts beat painfully

<span id="an_079_009">9</span> While eyes are downcast

<span id="an_079_010">10</span> (Now) they are saying: Shall we really
be restored to our first state

<span id="an_079_011">11</span> Even after we are crumbled bones ?

<span id="an_079_012">12</span> They say: Then that would be a vain
proceeding.

<span id="an_079_013">13</span> Surely it will need but one shout,

<span id="an_079_014">14</span> And lo! they will be awakened.

<span id="an_079_015">15</span> Hath there come unto thee the history of
Moses ?

<span id="an_079_016">16</span> How his Lord called him in the holy vale
of Tuwa,

<span id="an_079_017">17</span> (Saying:) Go thou unto Pharaoh - Lo! he
hath rebelled -

<span id="an_079_018">18</span> And say (unto him): Hast thou (will) to
grow (in grace) ?

<span id="an_079_019">19</span> Then I will guide thee to thy Lord and
thou shalt fear (Him).

<span id="an_079_020">20</span> And he showed him the tremendous token.

<span id="an_079_021">21</span> But he denied and disobeyed,

<span id="an_079_022">22</span> Then turned he away in haste,

<span id="an_079_023">23</span> Then gathered he and summoned

<span id="an_079_024">24</span> And proclaimed: "I (Pharaoh) am your
Lord the Highest."

<span id="an_079_025">25</span> So Allah seized him (and made him) an
example for the after (life) and for the former.

<span id="an_079_026">26</span> Lo! herein is indeed a lesson for him
who feareth.

<span id="an_079_027">27</span> Are ye the harder to create, or is the
heaven that He built ?

<span id="an_079_028">28</span> He raised the height thereof and ordered
it;

<span id="an_079_029">29</span> And He made dark the night thereof, and
He brought forth the morn thereof.

<span id="an_079_030">30</span> And after that He spread the earth,

<span id="an_079_031">31</span> And produced therefrom the water thereof
and the pasture thereof,

<span id="an_079_032">32</span> And He made fast the hills,

<span id="an_079_033">33</span> A provision for you and for your cattle.

<span id="an_079_034">34</span> But when the great disaster cometh,

<span id="an_079_035">35</span> The day when man will call to mind his
(whole) endeavour,

<span id="an_079_036">36</span> And hell will stand forth visible to him
who seeth,

<span id="an_079_037">37</span> Then, as for him who rebelled

<span id="an_079_038">38</span> And chose the life of the world,

<span id="an_079_039">39</span> Lo! hell will be his home.

<span id="an_079_040">40</span> But as for him who feared to stand
before his Lord and restrained his soul from lust,

<span id="an_079_041">41</span> Lo! the Garden will be his home.

<span id="an_079_042">42</span> They ask thee of the Hour: when will it
come to port ?

<span id="an_079_043">43</span> Why (ask they) ? What hast thou to tell
thereof ?

<span id="an_079_044">44</span> Unto thy Lord belongeth (knowledge of)
the term thereof.

<span id="an_079_045">45</span> Thou art but a warner unto him who
feareth it.

<span id="an_079_046">46</span> On the day when they behold it, it will
be as if they had but tarried for an evening or the morn thereof.
