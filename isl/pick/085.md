# 85. al-Buruj: the Constellations

<span id="an_085_001">1</span> By the heaven, holding mansions of the
stars,

<span id="an_085_002">2</span> And by the Promised Day.

<span id="an_085_003">3</span> And by the witness and that whereunto he
beareth testimony,

<span id="an_085_004">4</span> (Self-)destroyed were the owners of the
ditch

<span id="an_085_005">5</span> Of the fuel-fed fire,

<span id="an_085_006">6</span> When they sat by it,

<span id="an_085_007">7</span> And were themselves the witnesses of what
they did to the believers.

<span id="an_085_008">8</span> They had naught against them save that
they believed in Allah, the Mighty, the Owner of Praise,

<span id="an_085_009">9</span> Him unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty
of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is of all things the Witness.

<span id="an_085_010">10</span> Lo! they who persecute believing men and
believing women and repent not, theirs verily will be the doom of hell,
and theirs the doom of burning.

<span id="an_085_011">11</span> Lo! those who believe and do good works,
theirs will be Gardens underneath which rivers flow. That is the Great
Success.

<span id="an_085_012">12</span> Lo! the punishment of thy Lord is stern.

<span id="an_085_013">13</span> Lo! He it is Who produceth, then
reproduceth,

<span id="an_085_014">14</span> And He is the Forgiving, the Loving,

<span id="an_085_015">15</span> Lord of the Throne of Glory,

<span id="an_085_016">16</span> Doer of what He will.

<span id="an_085_017">17</span> Hath there come unto thee the story of
the hosts

<span id="an_085_018">18</span> Of Pharaoh and (the tribe of) Thamud ?

<span id="an_085_019">19</span> Nay, but those who disbelieve live in
denial

<span id="an_085_020">20</span> And Allah, all unseen, surroundeth them.

<span id="an_085_021">21</span> Nay, but it is a glorious Qur'an.

<span id="an_085_022">22</span> On a guarded tablet.
