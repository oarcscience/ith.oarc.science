The Meaning of the Glorious Qur'ân, by M.M. Pickthall, at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 62. al-Jumu\`ah: The Day of Congregation

<span id="an_062_001">1</span> All that is in the heavens and all that
is in the earth glorifieth Allah, the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One, the
Mighty, the Wise.

<span id="an_062_002">2</span> He it is Who hath sent among the
unlettered ones a messenger of their own, to recite unto them His
revelations and to make them grow, and to teach them the Scripture and
wisdom, though heretofore they were indeed in error manifest,

<span id="an_062_003">3</span> Along with others of them who have not
yet joined them. He is the Mighty, the Wise.

<span id="an_062_004">4</span> That is the bounty of Allah; which He
giveth unto whom He will. Allah is of Infinite Bounty.

<span id="an_062_005">5</span> The likeness of those who are entrusted
with the Law of Moses, yet apply it not, is as the likeness of the ass
carrying books. Wretched is the likeness of folk who deny the
revelations of Allah. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.

<span id="an_062_006">6</span> Say (O Muhammad): O ye who are Jews! If
ye claim that ye are favoured of Allah apart from (all) mankind, then
long for death if ye are truthful.

<span id="an_062_007">7</span> But they will never long for it because
of all that their own hands have sent before, and Allah is Aware of
evil-doers.

<span id="an_062_008">8</span> Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Lo! the
death from which ye shrink will surely meet you, and afterward ye will
be returned unto the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, and He
will tell you what ye used to do.

<span id="an_062_009">9</span> O ye who believe! When the call is heard
for the prayer of the day of congregation, haste unto remembrance of
Allah and leave your trading. That is better for you if ye did but know.

<span id="an_062_010">10</span> And when the prayer is ended, then
disperse in the land and seek of Allah's bounty, and remember Allah
much, that ye may be successful.

<span id="an_062_011">11</span> But when they spy some merchandise or
pastime they break away to it and leave thee standing. Say: That which
Allah hath is better than pastime and than merchandise, and Allah is the
Best of providers.
