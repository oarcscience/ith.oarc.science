------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 67. al-Mulk: The Kingdom

<span id="an_067_001">1</span> Blessed is He in Whose hand is the
Sovereignty, and, He is Able to do all things.

<span id="an_067_002">2</span> Who hath created life and death that He
may try you which of you is best in conduct; and He is the Mighty, the
Forgiving,

<span id="an_067_003">3</span> Who hath created seven heavens in
harmony. Thou (Muhammad) canst see no fault in the Beneficent One's
creation; then look again: Canst thou see any rifts ?

<span id="an_067_004">4</span> Then look again and yet again, thy sight
will return unto thee weakened and made dim.

<span id="an_067_005">5</span> And verily We have beautified the world's
heaven with lamps, and We have made them missiles for the devils, and
for them We have prepared the doom of flame.

<span id="an_067_006">6</span> And for those who disbelieve in their
Lord there is the doom of hell, a hapless journey's end!

<span id="an_067_007">7</span> When they are flung therein they hear its
roaring as it boileth up,

<span id="an_067_008">8</span> As it would burst with rage. Whenever a
(fresh) host is flung therein the wardens thereof ask them: Came there
unto you no warner ?

<span id="an_067_009">9</span> They say: Yea, verily, a warner came unto
us; but we denied and said: Allah hath naught revealed; ye are in naught
but a great error.

<span id="an_067_010">10</span> And they say: Had we been wont to listen
or have sense, we had not been among the dwellers in the flames.

<span id="an_067_011">11</span> So they acknowledge their sins; but far
removed (from mercy) are the dwellers in the flames.

<span id="an_067_012">12</span> Lo! those who fear their Lord in secret,
theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward.

<span id="an_067_013">13</span> And keep your opinion secret or proclaim
it, lo! He is Knower of all that is in the breasts (of men).

<span id="an_067_014">14</span> Should He not know what He created ? And
He is the Subtile, the Aware.

<span id="an_067_015">15</span> He it is Who hath made the earth
subservient unto you, so Walk in the paths thereof and eat of His
providence. And unto Him will be the resurrection (of the dead).

<span id="an_067_016">16</span> Have ye taken security from Him Who is
in the heaven that He will not cause the earth to swallow you when lo!
it is convulsed ?

<span id="an_067_017">17</span> Or have ye taken security from Him Who
is in the heaven that He will not let loose on you a hurricane ? But ye
shall know the manner of My warning.

<span id="an_067_018">18</span> And verily those before them denied,
then (see) the manner of My wrath (with them)!

<span id="an_067_019">19</span> Have they not seen the birds above them
spreading out their wings and closing them ? Naught upholdeth them save
the Beneficent. Lo! He is Seer of all things.

<span id="an_067_020">20</span> Or who is he that will be an army unto
you to help you instead of the Beneficent ? The disbelievers are in
naught but illusion.

<span id="an_067_021">21</span> Or who is he that will provide for you
if He should withhold His providence ? Nay, but they are set in pride
and frowardness.

<span id="an_067_022">22</span> Is he who goeth groping on his face more
rightly guided, or he who walketh upright on a straight road ?

<span id="an_067_023">23</span> Say (unto them, O Muhammad): He it is
who gave you being, and hath assigned unto you ears and eyes and hearts.
Small thanks give ye!

<span id="an_067_024">24</span> Say: He it is Who multiplieth you in the
earth, and unto Whom ye will be gathered.

<span id="an_067_025">25</span> And they say: When (will) this promise
(be fulfilled), if ye are truthful ?

<span id="an_067_026">26</span> Say: The knowledge is with Allah only,
and I am but a plain warner;

<span id="an_067_027">27</span> But when they see it nigh, the faces of
those who disbelieve will be awry, and it will be said (unto them): This
is that for which ye used to call.

<span id="an_067_028">28</span> Say (O Muhammad): Have ye thought:
Whether Allah causeth me (Muhammad) and those with me to perish or hath
mercy on us, still, who will protect the disbelievers from a painful
doom ?

<span id="an_067_029">29</span> Say: He is the Beneficent. In Him we
believe and in Him we put our trust. And ye will soon know who it is
that is in error manifest.

<span id="an_067_030">30</span> Say: Have ye thought: If (all) your
water were to disappear into the earth, who then could bring you gushing
water ?
