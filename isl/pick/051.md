# 51. adh-Dhariyat: The Scatterers

<span id="an_051_001">1</span> By those that winnow with a winnowing

<span id="an_051_002">2</span> And those that bear the burden (of the
rain)

<span id="an_051_003">3</span> And those that glide with ease (upon the
sea)

<span id="an_051_004">4</span> And those who distribute (blessings) by
command,

<span id="an_051_005">5</span> Lo! that wherewith ye are threatened is
indeed true,

<span id="an_051_006">6</span> And lo! the judgment will indeed befall.

<span id="an_051_007">7</span> By the heaven full of paths,

<span id="an_051_008">8</span> Lo! ye, forsooth, are of various opinion
(concerning the truth).

<span id="an_051_009">9</span> He is made to turn away from it who is
(himself) averse.

<span id="an_051_010">10</span> Accursed be the conjecturers

<span id="an_051_011">11</span> Who are careless in an abyss!

<span id="an_051_012">12</span> They ask: When is the Day of Judgment ?

<span id="an_051_013">13</span> (It is) the day when they will be
tormented at the Fire,

<span id="an_051_014">14</span> (And it will be said unto them): Taste
your torment (which ye inflicted). This is what ye sought to hasten.

<span id="an_051_015">15</span> Lo! those who keep from evil will dwell
amid gardens and watersprings,

<span id="an_051_016">16</span> Taking that which their Lord giveth
them; for lo! aforetime they were doers of good;

<span id="an_051_017">17</span> They used to sleep but little of the
night,

<span id="an_051_018">18</span> And ere the dawning of each day would
seek forgiveness,

<span id="an_051_019">19</span> And in their wealth the beggar and the
outcast had due share.

<span id="an_051_020">20</span> And in the earth are portents for those
whose faith is sure.

<span id="an_051_021">21</span> And (also) in yourselves. Can ye then
not see ?

<span id="an_051_022">22</span> And in the heaven is your providence and
that which ye are promised;

<span id="an_051_023">23</span> And by the Lord of the heavens and the
earth, it is the truth, even as (it is true) that ye speak.

<span id="an_051_024">24</span> Hath the story of Abraham's honoured
guests reached thee (O Muhammad) ?

<span id="an_051_025">25</span> When they came in unto him and said:
Peace! he answered, Peace! (and thought): Folk unknown (to me).

<span id="an_051_026">26</span> Then he went apart unto his housefolk so
that they brought a fatted calf;

<span id="an_051_027">27</span> And he set it before them, saying: Will
ye not eat ?

<span id="an_051_028">28</span> Then he conceived a fear of them. They
said: Fear not! and gave him tidings of (the birth of) a wise son.

<span id="an_051_029">29</span> Then his wife came forward, making moan,
and smote her face, and cried: A barren old woman!

<span id="an_051_030">30</span> They said: Even so saith thy Lord. Lo!
He is the Wise, the Knower.

<span id="an_051_031">31</span> (Abraham) said: And (afterward) what is
your errand, O ye sent (from Allah) ?

<span id="an_051_032">32</span> They said: Lo! we are sent unto a guilty
folk,

<span id="an_051_033">33</span> That we may send upon them stones of
clay,

<span id="an_051_034">34</span> Marked by thy Lord for (the destruction
of) the wanton.

<span id="an_051_035">35</span> Then we brought forth such believers as
were there.

<span id="an_051_036">36</span> But We found there but one house of
those surrendered (to Allah).

<span id="an_051_037">37</span> And We left behind therein a portent for
those who fear a painful doom.

<span id="an_051_038">38</span> And in Moses (too, there is a portent)
when We sent him unto Pharaoh with clear warrant,

<span id="an_051_039">39</span> But he withdrew (confiding) in his
might, and said: A wizard or a madman.

<span id="an_051_040">40</span> So We seized him and his hosts and flung
them in the sea, for he was reprobate.

<span id="an_051_041">41</span> And in (the tribe of) A'ad (there is a
portent) when we sent the fatal wind against them.

<span id="an_051_042">42</span> It spared naught that it reached, but
made it (all) as dust.

<span id="an_051_043">43</span> And in (the tribe of) Thamud (there is a
portent) when it was told them: Take your ease awhile.

<span id="an_051_044">44</span> But they rebelled against their Lord's
decree, and so the thunderbolt overtook them even while they gazed;

<span id="an_051_045">45</span> And they were unable to rise up, nor
could they help themselves.

<span id="an_051_046">46</span> And the folk of Noah aforetime. Lo! they
were licentious folk.

<span id="an_051_047">47</span> We have built the heaven with might, and
We it is Who make the vast extent (thereof).

<span id="an_051_048">48</span> And the earth have We laid out, how
gracious is the Spreader (thereof)!

<span id="an_051_049">49</span> And all things We have created by pairs,
that haply ye may reflect.

<span id="an_051_050">50</span> Therefor flee unto Allah; lo! I am a
plain warner unto you from him.

<span id="an_051_051">51</span> And set not any other god along with
Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you from Him.

<span id="an_051_052">52</span> Even so there came no messenger unto
those before them but they said: A wizard or a madman!

<span id="an_051_053">53</span> Have they handed down (the saying) as an
heirloom one unto another ? Nay, but they are froward folk.

<span id="an_051_054">54</span> So withdraw from them (O Muhammad), for
thou art in no wise blameworthy,

<span id="an_051_055">55</span> And warn, for warning profiteth
believers.

<span id="an_051_056">56</span> I created the jinn and humankind only
that they might worship Me.

<span id="an_051_057">57</span> I seek no livelihood from them, nor do I
ask that they should feed Me.

<span id="an_051_058">58</span> Lo! Allah! He it is that giveth
livelihood, the Lord of unbreakable might.

<span id="an_051_059">59</span> And lo! for those who (now) do wrong
there is an evil day like unto the evil day (which came for) their likes
(of old); so let them not ask Me to hasten on (that day).

<span id="an_051_060">60</span> And woe unto those who disbelieve, from
(that) their day which they are promised.
