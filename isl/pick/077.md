# 77. al-Mursalat: The Emissaries

<span id="an_077_001">1</span> By the emissary winds, (sent) one after
another

<span id="an_077_002">2</span> By the raging hurricanes,

<span id="an_077_003">3</span> By those which cause earth's vegetation
to revive;

<span id="an_077_004">4</span> By those who winnow with a winnowing,

<span id="an_077_005">5</span> By those who bring down the Reminder,

<span id="an_077_006">6</span> To excuse or to warn,

<span id="an_077_007">7</span> Surely that which ye are promised will
befall.

<span id="an_077_008">8</span> So when the stars are put out,

<span id="an_077_009">9</span> And when the sky is riven asunder,

<span id="an_077_010">10</span> And when the mountains are blown away,

<span id="an_077_011">11</span> And when the messengers are brought unto
their time appointed -

<span id="an_077_012">12</span> For what day is the time appointed ?

<span id="an_077_013">13</span> For the Day of Decision.

<span id="an_077_014">14</span> And what will convey unto thee what the
Day of Decision is! -

<span id="an_077_015">15</span> Woe unto the repudiators on that day!

<span id="an_077_016">16</span> Destroyed We not the former folk,

<span id="an_077_017">17</span> Then caused the latter folk to follow
after ?

<span id="an_077_018">18</span> Thus deal We ever with the guilty.

<span id="an_077_019">19</span> Woe unto the repudiators on that day!

<span id="an_077_020">20</span> Did We not create you from a base fluid

<span id="an_077_021">21</span> Which We laid up in a safe abode

<span id="an_077_022">22</span> For a known term ?

<span id="an_077_023">23</span> Thus We arranged. How excellent is Our
arranging!

<span id="an_077_024">24</span> Woe unto the repudiators on that day!

<span id="an_077_025">25</span> Have We not made the earth a receptacle

<span id="an_077_026">26</span> Both for the living and the dead,

<span id="an_077_027">27</span> And placed therein high mountains and
given you to drink sweet water therein ?

<span id="an_077_028">28</span> Woe unto the repudiators on that day!

<span id="an_077_029">29</span> (It will be said unto them:) Depart unto
that (doom) which ye used to deny;

<span id="an_077_030">30</span> Depart unto the shadow falling
threefold,

<span id="an_077_031">31</span> (Which yet is) no relief nor shelter
from the flame.

<span id="an_077_032">32</span> Lo! it throweth up sparks like the
castles,

<span id="an_077_033">33</span> (Or) as it might be camels of bright
yellow hue.

<span id="an_077_034">34</span> Woe unto the repudiators on that day!

<span id="an_077_035">35</span> This is a day wherein they speak not,

<span id="an_077_036">36</span> Nor are they suffered to put forth
excuses.

<span id="an_077_037">37</span> Woe unto the repudiators on that day!

<span id="an_077_038">38</span> This is the Day of Decision, We have
brought you and the men of old together.

<span id="an_077_039">39</span> If now ye have any wit, outwit Me.

<span id="an_077_040">40</span> Woe unto the repudiators on that day!

<span id="an_077_041">41</span> Lo! those who kept their duty are amid
shade and fountains,

<span id="an_077_042">42</span> And fruits such as they desire.

<span id="an_077_043">43</span> (Unto them it is said:) Eat, drink and
welcome, O ye blessed, in return for what ye did.

<span id="an_077_044">44</span> Thus do We reward the good.

<span id="an_077_045">45</span> Woe unto the repudiators on that day!

<span id="an_077_046">46</span> Eat and take your ease (on earth) a
little. Lo! ye are guilty.

<span id="an_077_047">47</span> Woe unto the repudiators on that day!

<span id="an_077_048">48</span> When it is said unto them: Bow down,
they bow not down!

<span id="an_077_049">49</span> Woe unto the repudiators on that day!

<span id="an_077_050">50</span> In what statement, after this, will they
believe ?
