The Meaning of the Glorious Qur'ân, by M.M. Pickthall, at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 47. Muhammad: Muhammad

<span id="an_047_001">1</span> Those who disbelieve and turn (men) from
the way of Allah, He rendereth their actions vain.

<span id="an_047_002">2</span> And those who believe and do good works
and believe in that which is revealed unto Muhammad - and it is the
truth from their Lord - He riddeth them of their ill-deeds and improveth
their state.

<span id="an_047_003">3</span> That is because those who disbelieve
follow falsehood and because those who believe follow the truth from
their Lord. Thus Allah coineth their similitudes for mankind.

<span id="an_047_004">4</span> Now when ye meet in battle those who
disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed
them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom
till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah
willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is
ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who
are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain.

<span id="an_047_005">5</span> He will guide them and improve their
state,

<span id="an_047_006">6</span> And bring them in unto the Garden which
He hath made known to them.

<span id="an_047_007">7</span> O ye who believe! If ye help Allah, He
will help you and will make your foothold firm.

<span id="an_047_008">8</span> And those who disbelieve, perdition is
for them, and He will make their actions vain.

<span id="an_047_009">9</span> That is because they are averse to that
which Allah hath revealed, therefor maketh He their actions fruitless.

<span id="an_047_010">10</span> Have they not travelled in the land to
see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them ? Allah
wiped them out. And for the disbelievers there will be the like thereof.

<span id="an_047_011">11</span> That is because Allah is patron of those
who believe, and because the disbelievers have no patron.

<span id="an_047_012">12</span> Lo! Allah will cause those who believe
and do good works to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow; while
those who disbelieve take their comfort in this life and eat even as the
cattle eat, and the Fire is their habitation.

<span id="an_047_013">13</span> And how many a township stronger than
thy township (O Muhammad) which hath cast thee out, have We destroyed,
and they had no helper!

<span id="an_047_014">14</span> Is he who relieth on a clear proof from
his Lord like those for whom the evil that they do is beautified while
they follow their own lusts ?

<span id="an_047_015">15</span> A similitude of the Garden which those
who keep their duty (to Allah) are promised: Therein are rivers of water
unpolluted, and rivers of milk whereof the flavour changeth not, and
rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers, and rivers of clear- run
honey; therein for them is every kind of fruit, with pardon from their
Lord. (Are those who enjoy all this) like those who are immortal in the
Fire and are given boiling water to drink so that it teareth their
bowels ?

<span id="an_047_016">16</span> Among them are some who give ear unto
thee (Muhammad) till, when they go forth from thy presence they say unto
those who have been given knowledge: What was that he said just now ?
Those are they whose hearts Allah hath sealed, and they follow their own
lusts.

<span id="an_047_017">17</span> While as for those who walk aright, He
addeth to their guidance, and giveth them their protection (against
evil).

<span id="an_047_018">18</span> Await they aught save the Hour, that it
should come upon them unawares ? And the beginnings thereof have already
come. But how, when it hath come upon them, can they take their warning
?

<span id="an_047_019">19</span> So know (O Muhammad) that there is no
God save Allah, and ask forgiveness for thy sin and for believing men
and believing women. Allah knoweth (both) your place of turmoil and your
place of rest.

<span id="an_047_020">20</span> And those who believe say: If only a
surah were revealed! But when a decisive surah is revealed and war is
mentioned therein, thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease looking
at thee with the look of men fainting unto death. Therefor woe unto
them!

<span id="an_047_021">21</span> Obedience and a civil word. Then, when
the matter is determined, if they are loyal to Allah it will be well for
them.

<span id="an_047_022">22</span> Would ye then, if ye were given the
command, work corruption in the land and sever your ties of kinship ?

<span id="an_047_023">23</span> Such are they whom Allah curseth so that
He deafeneth them and maketh blind their eyes.

<span id="an_047_024">24</span> Will they then not meditate on the
Qur'an, or are there locks on the hearts ?

<span id="an_047_025">25</span> Lo! those who turn back after the
guidance hath been manifested unto them, Satan hath seduced them, and He
giveth them the rein.

<span id="an_047_026">26</span> That is because they say unto those who
hate what Allah hath revealed: We will obey you in some matters; and
Allah knoweth their secret talk.

<span id="an_047_027">27</span> Then how (will it be with them) when the
angels gather them, smiting their faces and their backs!

<span id="an_047_028">28</span> That will be because they followed that
which angereth Allah, and hated that which pleaseth Him. Therefor He
hath made their actions vain.

<span id="an_047_029">29</span> Or do those in whose hearts is a disease
deem that Allah will not bring to light their (secret) hates ?

<span id="an_047_030">30</span> And if We would, We could show them unto
thee (Muhammad) so that thou shouldst know them surely by their marks.
And thou shalt know them by the burden of their talk. And Allah knoweth
your deeds.

<span id="an_047_031">31</span> And verily We shall try you till We know
those of you who strive hard (for the cause of Allah) and the steadfast,
and till We test your record.

<span id="an_047_032">32</span> Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from
the way of Allah and oppose the messenger after the guidance hath been
manifested unto them, they hurt Allah not a jot, and He will make their
actions fruitless.

<span id="an_047_033">33</span> O ye who believe! Obey Allah and obey
the messenger, and render not your actions vain.

<span id="an_047_034">34</span> Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from
the way of Allah and then die disbelievers, Allah surely will not pardon
them.

<span id="an_047_035">35</span> So do not falter and cry out for peace
when ye (will be) the uppermost, and Allah is with you, and He will not
grudge (the reward of) your actions.

<span id="an_047_036">36</span> The life of the world is but a sport and
a pastime. And if ye believe and ward off (evil). He will give you your
wages, and will not ask of you your wordly wealth.

<span id="an_047_037">37</span> If He should ask it of you and importune
you, ye would hoard it, and He would bring to light your (secret) hates.

<span id="an_047_038">38</span> Lo! ye are those who are called to spend
in the way of Allah, yet among you there are some who hoard. And as for
him who hoardeth, he hoardeth only from his soul. And Allah is the Rich,
and ye are the poor. And if ye turn away He will exchange you for some
other folk, and they will not be the likes of you.
