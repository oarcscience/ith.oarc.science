# 56. al-Waqi\`ah: That Which is Coming

<span id="an_056_001">1</span> When the event befalleth -

<span id="an_056_002">2</span> There is no denying that it will befall -

<span id="an_056_003">3</span> Abasing (some), exalting (others);

<span id="an_056_004">4</span> When the earth is shaken with a shock

<span id="an_056_005">5</span> And the hills are ground to powder

<span id="an_056_006">6</span> So that they become a scattered dust,

<span id="an_056_007">7</span> And ye will be three kinds:

<span id="an_056_008">8</span> (First) those on the right hand; what of
those on the right hand ?

<span id="an_056_009">9</span> And (then) those on the left hand; what
of those on the left hand ?

<span id="an_056_010">10</span> And the foremost in the race, the
foremost in the race:

<span id="an_056_011">11</span> Those are they who will be brought nigh

<span id="an_056_012">12</span> In gardens of delight;

<span id="an_056_013">13</span> A multitude of those of old

<span id="an_056_014">14</span> And a few of those of later time.

<span id="an_056_015">15</span> On lined couches,

<span id="an_056_016">16</span> Reclining therein face to face.

<span id="an_056_017">17</span> There wait on them immortal youths

<span id="an_056_018">18</span> With bowls and ewers and a cup from a
pure spring

<span id="an_056_019">19</span> Wherefrom they get no aching of the head
nor any madness,

<span id="an_056_020">20</span> And fruit that they prefer

<span id="an_056_021">21</span> And flesh of fowls that they desire.

<span id="an_056_022">22</span> And (there are) fair ones with wide,
lovely eyes,

<span id="an_056_023">23</span> Like unto hidden pearls,

<span id="an_056_024">24</span> Reward for what they used to do.

<span id="an_056_025">25</span> There hear they no vain speaking nor
recrimination

<span id="an_056_026">26</span> (Naught) but the saying: Peace, (and
again) Peace.

<span id="an_056_027">27</span> And those on the right hand; what of
those on the right hand ?

<span id="an_056_028">28</span> Among thornless lote-trees

<span id="an_056_029">29</span> And clustered plantains,

<span id="an_056_030">30</span> And spreading shade,

<span id="an_056_031">31</span> And water gushing,

<span id="an_056_032">32</span> And fruit in plenty

<span id="an_056_033">33</span> Neither out of reach nor yet forbidden,

<span id="an_056_034">34</span> And raised couches;

<span id="an_056_035">35</span> Lo! We have created them a (new)
creation

<span id="an_056_036">36</span> And made them virgins,

<span id="an_056_037">37</span> Lovers, friends,

<span id="an_056_038">38</span> For those on the right hand;

<span id="an_056_039">39</span> A multitude of those of old

<span id="an_056_040">40</span> And a multitude of those of later time.

<span id="an_056_041">41</span> And those on the left hand: What of
those on the left hand ?

<span id="an_056_042">42</span> In scorching wind and scalding water

<span id="an_056_043">43</span> And shadow of black smoke,

<span id="an_056_044">44</span> Neither cool nor refreshing.

<span id="an_056_045">45</span> Lo! heretofore they were effete with
luxury

<span id="an_056_046">46</span> And used to persist in the awful sin.

<span id="an_056_047">47</span> And they used to say: When we are dead
and have become dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised
again,

<span id="an_056_048">48</span> And also our forefathers ?

<span id="an_056_049">49</span> Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Lo! those
of old and those of later time

<span id="an_056_050">50</span> Will all be brought together to the
tryst of an appointed day.

<span id="an_056_051">51</span> Then lo! ye, the erring, the deniers,

<span id="an_056_052">52</span> Ye verily will eat of a tree called
Zaqqum

<span id="an_056_053">53</span> And will fill your bellies therewith;

<span id="an_056_054">54</span> And thereon ye will drink of boiling
water,

<span id="an_056_055">55</span> Drinking even as the camel drinketh.

<span id="an_056_056">56</span> This will be their welcome on the Day of
Judgment.

<span id="an_056_057">57</span> We created you. Will ye then admit the
truth ?

<span id="an_056_058">58</span> Have ye seen that which ye emit ?

<span id="an_056_059">59</span> Do ye create it or are We the Creator ?

<span id="an_056_060">60</span> We mete out death among you, and We are
not to be outrun,

<span id="an_056_061">61</span> That We may transfigure you and make you
what ye know not.

<span id="an_056_062">62</span> And verily ye know the first creation.
Why, then, do ye not reflect ?

<span id="an_056_063">63</span> Have ye seen that which ye cultivate ?

<span id="an_056_064">64</span> Is it ye who foster it, or are We the
Fosterer ?

<span id="an_056_065">65</span> If We willed, We verily could make it
chaff, then would ye cease not to exclaim:

<span id="an_056_066">66</span> Lo! we are laden with debt!

<span id="an_056_067">67</span> Nay, but we are deprived!

<span id="an_056_068">68</span> Have ye observed the water which ye
drink ?

<span id="an_056_069">69</span> Is it ye who shed it from the raincloud,
or are We the Shedder ?

<span id="an_056_070">70</span> If We willed We verily could make it
bitter. Why then, give ye not thanks ?

<span id="an_056_071">71</span> Have ye observed the fire which ye
strike out;

<span id="an_056_072">72</span> Was it ye who made the tree thereof to
grow, or were We the grower ?

<span id="an_056_073">73</span> We, even We, appointed it a memorial and
a comfort for the dwellers in the wilderness.

<span id="an_056_074">74</span> Therefor (O Muhammad), praise the name
of thy Lord, the Tremendous.

<span id="an_056_075">75</span> Nay, I swear by the places of the stars
-

<span id="an_056_076">76</span> And lo! that verily is a tremendous
oath, if ye but knew -

<span id="an_056_077">77</span> That (this) is indeed a noble Qur'an

<span id="an_056_078">78</span> In a Book kept hidden

<span id="an_056_079">79</span> Which none toucheth save the purified,

<span id="an_056_080">80</span> A revelation from the Lord of the
Worlds.

<span id="an_056_081">81</span> Is it this Statement that ye scorn,

<span id="an_056_082">82</span> And make denial thereof your livelihood
?

<span id="an_056_083">83</span> Why, then, when (the soul) cometh up to
the throat (of the dying)

<span id="an_056_084">84</span> And ye are at that moment looking

<span id="an_056_085">85</span> - And We are nearer unto him than ye
are, but ye see not -

<span id="an_056_086">86</span> Why then, if ye are not in bondage (unto
Us),

<span id="an_056_087">87</span> Do ye not force it back, if ye are
truthful ?

<span id="an_056_088">88</span> Thus if he is of those brought nigh,

<span id="an_056_089">89</span> Then breath of life, and plenty, and a
Garden of delight.

<span id="an_056_090">90</span> And if he is of those on the right hand,

<span id="an_056_091">91</span> Then (the greeting) "Peace be unto thee"
from those on the right hand.

<span id="an_056_092">92</span> But if he is of the rejecters, the
erring,

<span id="an_056_093">93</span> Then the welcome will be boiling water

<span id="an_056_094">94</span> And roasting at hell-fire.

<span id="an_056_095">95</span> Lo! this is certain truth.

<span id="an_056_096">96</span> Therefor (O Muhammad) praise the name of
thy Lord, the Tremendous.
