------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 40. al-Mu'min: The Forgiving One

<span id="an_040_001">1</span> Ha. Mim.

<span id="an_040_002">2</span> The revelation of the Scripture is from
Allah, the Mighty, the Knower,

<span id="an_040_003">3</span> The Forgiver of sin, the Accepter of
repentance, the Stern in punishment, the Bountiful. There is no God save
Him. Unto Him is the journeying.

<span id="an_040_004">4</span> None argue concerning the revelations of
Allah save those who disbelieve, so let not their turn of fortune in the
land deceive thee (O Muhammad).

<span id="an_040_005">5</span> The folk of Noah and the factions after
them denied (their messengers) before these, and every nation purposed
to seize their messenger and argued falsely, (thinking) thereby to
refute the Truth. Then I seized them, and how (awful) was My punishment.

<span id="an_040_006">6</span> Thus was the word of thy Lord concerning
those who disbelieve fulfilled: That they are owners of the Fire.

<span id="an_040_007">7</span> Those who bear the Throne, and all who
are round about it, hymn the praises of their Lord and believe in Him
and ask forgiveness for those who believe (saying): Our Lord! Thou
comprehendest all things in mercy and knowledge, therefor forgive those
who repent and follow Thy way. Ward off from them the punishment of
hell.

<span id="an_040_008">8</span> Our Lord! And make them enter the Gardens
of Eden which thou hast promised them, with such of their fathers and
their wives and their descendants as do right. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art
the Mighty, the Wise.

<span id="an_040_009">9</span> And ward off from them ill-deeds; and he
from whom Thou wardest off ill- deeds that day, him verily hast Thou
taken into mercy. That is the supreme triumph.

<span id="an_040_010">10</span> Lo! (on that day) those who disbelieve
are informed by proclamation: Verily Allah's abhorrence is more terrible
than your abhorrence one of another, when ye were called unto the faith
but did refuse.

<span id="an_040_011">11</span> They say: Our Lord! Twice hast Thou made
us die, and twice hast Thou made us live. Now we confess our sins. Is
there any way to go out ?

<span id="an_040_012">12</span> (It is said unto them): This is (your
plight) because, when Allah only was invoked, ye disbelieved, but when
some partner was ascribed to Him ye were believing. But the command
belongeth only to Allah, the Sublime, the Majestic.

<span id="an_040_013">13</span> He it is Who showeth you His portents,
and sendeth down for you provision from the sky. None payeth heed save
him who turneth (unto Him) repentant.

<span id="an_040_014">14</span> Therefor (O believers) pray unto Allah,
making religion pure for Him (only), however much the disbelievers be
averse -

<span id="an_040_015">15</span> The Exalter of Ranks, the Lord of the
Throne. He causeth the Spirit of His command upon whom He will of His
slaves, that He may warn of the Day of Meeting,

<span id="an_040_016">16</span> The day when they come forth, nothing of
them being hidden from Allah. Whose is the Sovereignty this day ? It is
Allah's, the One, the Almighty.

<span id="an_040_017">17</span> This day is each soul requited that
which it hath earned; no wrong (is done) this day. Lo! Allah is swift at
reckoning.

<span id="an_040_018">18</span> Warn them (O Muhammad) of the Day of the
approaching (doom), when the hearts will be choking the throats, (when)
there will be no friend for the wrong-doers, nor any intercessor who
will be heard.

<span id="an_040_019">19</span> He knoweth the traitor of the eyes, and
that which the bosoms hide.

<span id="an_040_020">20</span> Allah judgeth with truth, while those to
whom they cry instead of Him judge not at all. Lo! Allah, He is the
Hearer, the Seer.

<span id="an_040_021">21</span> Have they not travelled in the land to
see the nature of the consequence for those who disbelieved before them
? They were mightier than these in power and (in the) traces (which they
left behind them) in the earth. Yet Allah seized them for their sins,
and they had no protector from Allah.

<span id="an_040_022">22</span> That was because their messengers kept
bringing them clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty) but they
disbelieved; so Allah seized them. Lo! He is Strong, severe in
punishment.

<span id="an_040_023">23</span> And verily We sent Moses with Our
revelations and a clear warrant

<span id="an_040_024">24</span> Unto Pharaoh and Haman and Korah, but
they said: A lying sorcerer!

<span id="an_040_025">25</span> And when he brought them the Truth from
Our presence, they said: Slay the sons of those who believe with him,
and spare their women. But the plot of disbelievers is in naught but
error.

<span id="an_040_026">26</span> And Pharaoh said: Suffer me to kill
Moses, and let him cry unto his Lord. Lo! I fear that he will alter your
religion or that he will cause confusion in the land.

<span id="an_040_027">27</span> Moses said: Lo! I seek refuge in my Lord
and your Lord from every scorner who believeth not in a Day of
Reckoning.

<span id="an_040_028">28</span> And a believing man of Pharaoh's family,
who hid his faith, said: Would ye kill a man because he saith: My Lord
is Allah, and hath brought you clear proofs from your Lord ? If he is
lying, then his lie is upon him; and if he is truthful, then some of
that wherewith he threateneth you will strike you. Lo! Allah guideth not
one who is a prodigal, a liar.

<span id="an_040_029">29</span> O my people! Yours is the kingdom
to-day, ye being uppermost in the land. But who would save us from the
wrath of Allah should it reach us ? Pharaoh said: I do but show you what
I think, and I do but guide you to wise policy.

<span id="an_040_030">30</span> And he who believed said: O my people!
Lo! I fear for you a fate like that of the factions (of old);

<span id="an_040_031">31</span> A plight like that of Noah's folk, and
A'ad and Thamud, and those after them, and Allah willeth no injustice
for (His) slaves.

<span id="an_040_032">32</span> And, O my people! Lo! I fear for you a
Day of Summoning,

<span id="an_040_033">33</span> A day when ye will turn to flee, having
no preserver from Allah: and he whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there
is no guide.

<span id="an_040_034">34</span> And verily Joseph brought you of old
clear proofs, yet ye ceased not to be in doubt concerning what he
brought you till, when he died, ye said: Allah will not send any
messenger after him. Thus Allah deceiveth him who is a prodigal, a
doubter.

<span id="an_040_035">35</span> Those who wrangle concerning the
revelations of Allah without any warrant that hath come unto them, it is
greatly hateful in the sight of Allah and in the sight of those who
believe. Thus doth Allah print on every arrogant, disdainful heart.

<span id="an_040_036">36</span> And Pharaoh said: O Haman! Build for me
a tower that haply I may reach the roads,

<span id="an_040_037">37</span> The roads of the heavens, and may look
upon the God of Moses, though verily I think him a liar. Thus was the
evil that he did made fairseeming unto Pharaoh, and he was debarred from
the (right) way. The plot of Pharaoh ended but in ruin.

<span id="an_040_038">38</span> And he who believed said: O my people!
Follow me. I will show you the way of right conduct.

<span id="an_040_039">39</span> O my people! Lo! this life of the world
is but a passing comfort, and lo! the Hereafter, that is the enduring
home.

<span id="an_040_040">40</span> Whoso doeth an ill-deed, he will be
repaid the like thereof, while whoso doeth right, whether male or
female, and is a believer, (all) such will enter the Garden, where they
will be nourished without stint.

<span id="an_040_041">41</span> And, O my people! What aileth me that I
call you unto deliverance when ye call me unto the Fire ?

<span id="an_040_042">42</span> Ye call me to disbelieve in Allah and
ascribe unto Him as partners that whereof I have no knowledge, while I
call you unto the Mighty, the Forgiver.

<span id="an_040_043">43</span> Assuredly that whereunto ye call me hath
no claim in the world or in the Hereafter, and our return will be unto
Allah, and the prodigals will be owners of the Fire.

<span id="an_040_044">44</span> And ye will remember what I say unto
you. I confide my cause unto Allah. Lo! Allah is Seer of (His) slaves.

<span id="an_040_045">45</span> So Allah warded off from him the evils
which they plotted, while a dreadful doom encompassed Pharaoh's folk,

<span id="an_040_046">46</span> The Fire; they are exposed to it morning
and evening; and on the day when the Hour upriseth (it is said): Cause
Pharaoh's folk to enter the most awful doom.

<span id="an_040_047">47</span> And when they wrangle in the Fire, the
weak say unto those who were proud: Lo! we were a following unto you;
will ye therefor rid us of a portion of the Fire ?

<span id="an_040_048">48</span> Those who were proud say: Lo! we are all
(together) herein. Lo! Allah hath judged between (His) slaves.

<span id="an_040_049">49</span> And those in the Fire say unto the
guards of hell: Entreat your Lord that He relieve us of a day of the
torment.

<span id="an_040_050">50</span> They say: Came not your messengers unto
you with clear proofs ? They say: Yea, verily. They say: Then do ye
pray, although the prayer of disbelievers is in vain.

<span id="an_040_051">51</span> Lo! We verily do help Our messengers,
and those who believe, in the life of the world and on the day when the
witnesses arise,

<span id="an_040_052">52</span> The day when their excuse availeth not
the evil-doers, and theirs is the curse, and theirs the ill abode.

<span id="an_040_053">53</span> And We verily gave Moses the guidance,
and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit the Scripture,

<span id="an_040_054">54</span> A guide and a reminder for men of
understanding.

<span id="an_040_055">55</span> Then have patience (O Muhammad). Lo! the
promise of Allah is true. And ask forgiveness of thy sin, and hymn the
praise of thy Lord at fall of night and in the early hours.

<span id="an_040_056">56</span> Lo! those who wrangle concerning the
revelations of Allah without a warrant having come unto them, there is
naught else in their breasts save pride which they will never attain. So
take thou refuge in Allah. Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Seer.

<span id="an_040_057">57</span> Assuredly the creation of the heavens
and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind; but most of
mankind know not.

<span id="an_040_058">58</span> And the blind man and the seer are not
equal, neither are those who believe and do good works (equal with) the
evil-doer. Little do ye reflect!

<span id="an_040_059">59</span> Lo! the Hour is surely coming, there is
no doubt thereof; yet most of mankind believe not.

<span id="an_040_060">60</span> And your Lord hath said: Pray unto Me
and I will hear your prayer. Lo! those who scorn My service, they will
enter hell, disgraced.

<span id="an_040_061">61</span> Allah it is Who hath appointed for you
night that ye may rest therein, and day for seeing. Lo! Allah is a Lord
of bounty for mankind, yet most of mankind give not thanks.

<span id="an_040_062">62</span> Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of
all things, There is no God save Him. How then are ye perverted ?

<span id="an_040_063">63</span> Thus are they perverted who deny the
revelations of Allah.

<span id="an_040_064">64</span> Allah it is Who appointed for you the
earth for a dwelling-place and the sky for a canopy, and fashioned you
and perfected your shapes, and hath provided you with good things. Such
is Allah, your Lord. Then blessed be Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!

<span id="an_040_065">65</span> He is the Living One. There is no God
save Him. So pray unto Him, making religion pure for Him (only). Praise
be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!

<span id="an_040_066">66</span> Say (O Muhammad): I am forbidden to
worship those unto whom ye cry beside Allah since there have come unto
me clear proofs from my Lord, and I am commanded to surrender to the
Lord of the Worlds.

<span id="an_040_067">67</span> He it is Who created you from dust, then
from a drop (of seed) then from a clot, then bringeth you forth as a
child, then (ordaineth) that ye attain full strength and afterward that
ye become old men - though some among you die before - and that ye reach
an appointed term, that haply ye may understand.

<span id="an_040_068">68</span> He it is Who quickeneth and giveth
death. When He ordaineth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is.

<span id="an_040_069">69</span> Hast thou not seen those who wrangle
concerning the revelations of Allah, how they are turned away ? -

<span id="an_040_070">70</span> Those who deny the Scripture and that
wherewith We send Our messengers. But they will come to know,

<span id="an_040_071">71</span> When carcans are about their necks and
chains. They are dragged

<span id="an_040_072">72</span> Through boiling waters; then they are
thrust into the Fire.

<span id="an_040_073">73</span> Then it is said unto them: Where are
(all) that ye used to make partners (in the Sovereignty)

<span id="an_040_074">74</span> Beside Allah ? They say: They have
failed us; but we used not to pray to anything before. Thus doth Allah
send astray the disbelievers (in His guidance).

<span id="an_040_075">75</span> (And it is said unto them): This is
because ye exulted in the earth without right, and because ye were
petulant.

<span id="an_040_076">76</span> Enter ye the gates of hell, to dwell
therein. Evil is the habitation of the scornful.

<span id="an_040_077">77</span> Then have patience (O Muhammad). Lo! the
promise of Allah is true. And whether we let thee see a part of that
which We promise them, or (whether) We cause thee to die, still unto Us
they will be brought back.

<span id="an_040_078">78</span> Verily We sent messengers before thee,
among them those of whom We have told thee, and some of whom We have not
told thee; and it was not given to any messenger that he should bring a
portent save by Allah's leave, but when Allah's commandment cometh (the
cause) is judged aright, and the followers of vanity will then be lost.

<span id="an_040_079">79</span> Allah it is Who hath appointed for you
cattle, that ye may ride on some of them, and eat of some -

<span id="an_040_080">80</span> (Many) benefits ye have from them - and
that ye may satisfy by their means a need that is in your breasts, and
may be borne upon them as upon the ship.

<span id="an_040_081">81</span> And He showeth you His tokens. Which,
then, of the tokens of Allah do ye deny ?

<span id="an_040_082">82</span> Have they not travelled in the land to
see the nature of the consequence for those before them ? They were more
numerous than these, and mightier in power and (in the) traces (which
they left behind them) in the earth. But all that they used to earn
availed them not.

<span id="an_040_083">83</span> And when their messengers brought them
clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty) they exulted in the knowledge they
(themselves) possessed. And that which they were wont to mock befell
them.

<span id="an_040_084">84</span> Then, when they saw Our doom, they said:
We believe in Allah only and reject (all) that we used to associate
(with Him).

<span id="an_040_085">85</span> But their faith could not avail them
when they saw Our doom. This is Allah's law which hath ever taken course
for His bondmen. And then the disbelievers will be ruined.
