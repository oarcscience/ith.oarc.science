<A NAME="an_057_001">1</A>&nbsp;All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifieth Allah; and He is the Mighty,  the Wise. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_002">2</A>&nbsp;His is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; He quickeneth and He  giveth death; and He is Able to do all things. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_003">3</A>&nbsp;He is the First and the Last, and the Outward and the Inward; and He is  Knower of all things. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_004">4</A>&nbsp;He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days; then He mounted  the Throne. He knoweth all that entereth the earth and all that emergeth therefrom and  all that cometh down from the sky and all that ascendeth therein; and He is with you  wheresoever ye may be. And Allah is Seer of what ye do. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_005">5</A>&nbsp;His is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and unto Allah (all)  things are brought back. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_006">6</A>&nbsp;He causeth the night to pass into the day, and He causeth the day to pass into  the night, and He is knower of all that is in the breasts. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_007">7</A>&nbsp;Believe in Allah and His messenger, and spend of that whereof He hath  made you trustees; and such of you as believe and spend (aright), theirs will be a great  reward. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_008">8</A>&nbsp;What aileth you that ye believe not in Allah, when the messenger calleth you  to believe in your Lord, and He hath already made a covenant with you, if ye are  believers ? </P>
<A NAME="an_057_009">9</A>&nbsp;He it is Who sendeth down clear revelations unto His slave, that He may  bring you forth from darkness unto light; and lo! for you, Allah is Full of Pity,  Merciful. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_010">10</A>&nbsp;And what aileth you that ye spend not in the way of Allah when unto Allah  belongeth the inheritance of the heavens and the earth ? Those who spent and fought  before the victory are not upon a level (with the rest of you). Such are greater in rank  than those who spent and fought afterwards. Unto each hath Allah promised good.  And Allah is Informed of what ye do. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_011">11</A>&nbsp;Who is he that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan, that He may double it for  him and his may be a rich reward ? </P>
<A NAME="an_057_012">12</A>&nbsp;On the day when thou (Muhammad) wilt see the believers, men and women,  their light shining forth before them and on their right hands, (and wilt hear it said  unto them): Glad news for you this day: Gardens underneath which rivers flow,  wherein ye are immortal. That is the supreme triumph. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_013">13</A>&nbsp;On the day when the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will say  unto those who believe: Look on us that we may borrow from your light! it will be  said: Go back and seek for light! Then there will separate them a wall wherein is a  gate, the inner side whereof containeth mercy, while the outer side thereof is toward  the doom. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_014">14</A>&nbsp;They will cry unto them (saying): Were we not with you ? They will say:  Yea, verily; but ye tempted one another, and hesitated, and doubted, and vain desires  beguiled you till the ordinance of Allah came to pass; and the deceiver deceived you  concerning Allah; </P>
<A NAME="an_057_015">15</A>&nbsp;So this day no ransom can be taken from you nor from those who  disbelieved. Your home is the Fire; that is your patron, and a hapless journey's end. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_016">16</A>&nbsp;Is not the time ripe for the hearts of those who believe to submit to Allah's  reminder and to the truth which is revealed, that they become not as those who  received the scripture of old but the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts  were hardened, and many of them are evil-livers. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_017">17</A>&nbsp;Know that Allah quickeneth the earth after its death. We have made clear  Our revelations for you, that haply ye may understand. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_018">18</A>&nbsp;Lo! those who give alms, both men and women, and lend unto Allah a  goodly loan, it will be doubled for them, and theirs will be a rich reward. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_019">19</A>&nbsp;And those who believe in Allah and His messengers, they are the loyal, and  the martyrs are with their Lord; they have their reward and their light; while as for  those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, they are owners of hell-fire. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_020">20</A>&nbsp;Know that the life of the world is only play, and idle talk, and pageantry, and  boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children; as the likeness of  vegetation after rain, whereof the growth is pleasing to the husbandman, but afterward  it drieth up and thou seest it turning yellow, then it becometh straw. And in the  Hereafter there is grievous punishment, and (also) forgiveness from Allah and His  good pleasure, whereas the life of the world is but matter of illusion. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_021">21</A>&nbsp;Race one with another for forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whereof  the breadth is as the breadth of the heavens and the earth, which is in store for those  who believe in Allah and His messengers. Such is the bounty of Allah, which He  bestoweth upon whom He will, and Allah is of Infinite Bounty. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_022">22</A>&nbsp;Naught of disaster befalleth in the earth or in yourselves but it is in a Book  before we bring it into being - Lo! that is easy for Allah - </P>
<A NAME="an_057_023">23</A>&nbsp;That ye grieve not for the sake of that which hath escaped you, nor yet exult  because of that which hath been given. Allah loveth not all prideful boasters, </P>
<A NAME="an_057_024">24</A>&nbsp;Who hoard and who enjoin upon the people avarice. And whosoever turneth  away, still Allah is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_025">25</A>&nbsp;We verily sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the  Scripture and the Balance, that mankind may observe right measure; and He revealed  iron, wherein is mighty power and (many) uses for mankind, and that Allah may  know him who helpeth Him and His messengers, though unseen. Lo! Allah is Strong,  Almighty. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_026">26</A>&nbsp;And We verily sent Noah and Abraham and placed the prophethood and the  scripture among their seed, and among them there is he who goeth right, but many of  them are evil-livers. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_027">27</A>&nbsp;Then We caused Our messengers to follow in their footsteps; and We caused  Jesus, son of Mary, to follow, and gave him the Gospel, and placed compassion and  mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. But monasticism they invented - We  ordained it not for them - only seeking Allah's pleasure, and they observed it not with  right observance. So We give those of them who believe their reward, but many of  them are evil-livers. </P>
<A NAME="an_057_028">28</A>&nbsp;O ye who believe! Be mindful of your duty to Allah and put faith in His  messenger. He will give you twofold of His mercy and will appoint for you a light  wherein ye shall walk, and will forgive you. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful; </P>
<A NAME="an_057_029">29</A>&nbsp;That the People of the Scripture may know that they control naught of the  bounty of Allah, but that the bounty is in Allah's hand to give to whom He will. And  Allah is of Infinite Bounty.
