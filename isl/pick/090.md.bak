# 90. al-Balad: The City

<span id="an_090_001">1</span> Nay, I swear by this city -

<span id="an_090_002">2</span> And thou art an indweller of this city -

<span id="an_090_003">3</span> And the begetter and that which he begat,

<span id="an_090_004">4</span> We verily have created man in an
atmosphere:

<span id="an_090_005">5</span> Thinketh he that none hath power over him
?

<span id="an_090_006">6</span> And he saith: I have destroyed vast
wealth:

<span id="an_090_007">7</span> Thinketh he that none beholdeth him ?

<span id="an_090_008">8</span> Did We not assign unto him two eyes

<span id="an_090_009">9</span> And a tongue and two lips,

<span id="an_090_010">10</span> And guide him to the parting of the
mountain ways ?

<span id="an_090_011">11</span> But he hath not attempted the Ascent -

<span id="an_090_012">12</span> Ah, what will convey unto thee what the
Ascent is! -

<span id="an_090_013">13</span> (It is) to free a slave,

<span id="an_090_014">14</span> And to feed in the day of hunger.

<span id="an_090_015">15</span> An orphan near of kin,

<span id="an_090_016">16</span> Or some poor wretch in misery,

<span id="an_090_017">17</span> And to be of those who believe and
exhort one another to perseverance and exhort one another to pity.

<span id="an_090_018">18</span> Their place will be on the right hand.

<span id="an_090_019">19</span> But those who disbelieve Our
revelations, their place will be on the left hand.

<span id="an_090_020">20</span> Fire will be an awning over them.
