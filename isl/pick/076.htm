<A NAME="an_076_001">1</A>&nbsp;Hath there come upon man (ever) any period of time in which he was a thing  unremembered ? </P>
<A NAME="an_076_002">2</A>&nbsp;Lo! We create man from a drop of thickened fluid to test him; so We make  him hearing, knowing. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_003">3</A>&nbsp;Lo! We have shown him the way, whether he be grateful or disbelieving. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_004">4</A>&nbsp;Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers manacles and carcans and a raging  fire. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_005">5</A>&nbsp;Lo! the righteous shall drink of a cup whereof the mixture is of Kafur, </P>
<A NAME="an_076_006">6</A>&nbsp;A spring wherefrom the slaves of Allah drink, making it gush forth  abundantly, </P>
<A NAME="an_076_007">7</A>&nbsp;(Because) they perform the vow and fear a day whereof the evil is wide- spreading, </P>
<A NAME="an_076_008">8</A>&nbsp;And feed with food the needy wretch, the orphan and the prisoner, for love  of Him, </P>
<A NAME="an_076_009">9</A>&nbsp;(Saying): We feed you, for the sake of Allah only. We wish for no reward  nor thanks from you; </P>
<A NAME="an_076_010">10</A>&nbsp;Lo! we fear from our Lord a day of frowning and of fate. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_011">11</A>&nbsp;Therefor Allah hath warded off from them the evil of that day, and hath  made them find brightness and joy; </P>
<A NAME="an_076_012">12</A>&nbsp;And hath awarded them for all that they endured, a Garden and silk attire; </P>
<A NAME="an_076_013">13</A>&nbsp;Reclining therein upon couches, they will find there neither (heat of) a sun  nor bitter cold. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_014">14</A>&nbsp;The shade thereof is close upon them and the clustered fruits thereof bow  down. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_015">15</A>&nbsp;Goblets of silver are brought round for them, and beakers (as) of glass </P>
<A NAME="an_076_016">16</A>&nbsp;(Bright as) glass but (made) of silver, which they (themselves) have  measured to the measure (of their deeds). </P>
<A NAME="an_076_017">17</A>&nbsp;There are they watered with a cup whereof the mixture is of Zanjabil, </P>
<A NAME="an_076_018">18</A>&nbsp;(The water of) a spring therein, named Salsabil. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_019">19</A>&nbsp;There wait on them immortal youths, whom, when thou seest, thou wouldst  take for scattered pearls. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_020">20</A>&nbsp;When thou seest, thou wilt see there bliss and high estate. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_021">21</A>&nbsp;Their raiment will be fine green silk and gold embroidery. Bracelets of silver  will they wear. Their Lord will slake their thirst with a pure drink. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_022">22</A>&nbsp;(And it will be said unto them): Lo! this is a reward for you. Your endeavour  (upon earth) hath found acceptance. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_023">23</A>&nbsp;Lo! We, even We, have revealed unto thee the Qur'an, a revelation; </P>
<A NAME="an_076_024">24</A>&nbsp;So submit patiently to thy Lord's command, and obey not of them any guilty  one or disbeliever. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_025">25</A>&nbsp;Remember the name of thy Lord at morn and evening. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_026">26</A>&nbsp;And worship Him (a portion) of the night. And glorify Him through the  livelong night. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_027">27</A>&nbsp;Lo! these love fleeting life, and put behind them (the remembrance of) a  grievous day. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_028">28</A>&nbsp;We, even We, created them, and strengthened their frame. And when We  will, We can replace them, bringing others like them in their stead. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_029">29</A>&nbsp;Lo! this is an Admonishment, that whosoever will may choose a way unto  his Lord. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_030">30</A>&nbsp;Yet ye will not, unless Allah willeth. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise. </P>
<A NAME="an_076_031">31</A>&nbsp;He maketh whom He will to enter His mercy, and for evil-doers hath  prepared a painful doom.
