# 45. al-Jathiyah: The Kneeling

<span id="an_045_001">1</span> Ha. Mim.

<span id="an_045_002">2</span> The revelation of the Scripture is from
Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.

<span id="an_045_003">3</span> Lo! in the heavens and the earth are
portents for believers.

<span id="an_045_004">4</span> And in your creation, and all the beasts
that He scattereth in the earth, are portents for a folk whose faith is
sure.

<span id="an_045_005">5</span> And the difference of night and day and
the provision that Allah sendeth down from the sky and thereby
quickeneth the earth after her death, and the ordering of the winds, are
portents for a people who have sense.

<span id="an_045_006">6</span> These are the portents of Allah which We
recite unto thee (Muhammad) with truth. Then in what fact, after Allah
and His portents, will they believe ?

<span id="an_045_007">7</span> Woe unto each sinful liar,

<span id="an_045_008">8</span> Who heareth the revelations of Allah
recited unto him, and then continueth in pride as though he heard them
not. Give him tidings of a painful doom.

<span id="an_045_009">9</span> And when he knoweth aught of Our
revelations he maketh it a jest. For such there is a shameful doom.

<span id="an_045_010">10</span> Beyond them there is hell, and that
which they have earned will naught avail them, nor those whom they have
chosen for protecting friends beside Allah. Theirs will be an awful
doom.

<span id="an_045_011">11</span> This is guidance. And those who
disbelieve the revelations of their Lord, for them there is a painful
doom of wrath.

<span id="an_045_012">12</span> Allah it is Who hath made the sea of
service unto you that the ships may run thereon by His command, and that
ye may seek of His bounty, and that haply ye may be thankful;

<span id="an_045_013">13</span> And hath made of service unto you
whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; it is all
from Him. Lo! herein verily are portents for a people who reflect.

<span id="an_045_014">14</span> Tell those who believe to forgive those
who hope not for the days of Allah; in order that He may requite folk
what they used to earn.

<span id="an_045_015">15</span> Whoso doeth right, it is for his soul,
and whoso doeth wrong, it is against it. And afterward unto your Lord ye
will be brought back.

<span id="an_045_016">16</span> And verily we gave the Children of
Israel the Scripture and the Command and the Prophethood, and provided
them with good things and favoured them above (all) peoples;

<span id="an_045_017">17</span> And gave them plain commandments. And
they differed not until after the knowledge came unto them, through
rivalry among themselves. Lo! thy Lord will judge between them on the
Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ.

<span id="an_045_018">18</span> And now have We set thee (O Muhammad) on
a clear road of (Our) commandment; so follow it, and follow not the
whims of those who know not.

<span id="an_045_019">19</span> Lo! they can avail thee naught against
Allah. And lo! as for the wrong-doers, some of them are friends of
others; and Allah is the Friend of those who ward off (evil).

<span id="an_045_020">20</span> This is clear indication for mankind,
and a guidance and a mercy for a folk whose faith is sure.

<span id="an_045_021">21</span> Or do those who commit ill-deeds suppose
that We shall make them as those who believe and do good works, the same
in life and death ? Bad is their judgment!

<span id="an_045_022">22</span> And Allah hath created the heavens and
the earth with truth, and that every soul may be repaid what it hath
earned. And they will not be wronged.

<span id="an_045_023">23</span> Hast thou seen him who maketh his desire
his god, and Allah sendeth him astray purposely, and sealeth up his
hearing and his heart, and setteth on his sight a covering ? Then who
will lead him after Allah (hath condemned him) ? Will ye not then heed ?

<span id="an_045_024">24</span> And they say: There is naught but our
life of the world; we die and we live, and naught destroyeth us save
time; when they have no knowledge whatsoever of (all) that; they do but
guess.

<span id="an_045_025">25</span> And when Our clear revelations are
recited unto them their only argument is that they say: Bring (back) our
fathers. then, if ye are truthful.

<span id="an_045_026">26</span> Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Allah
giveth life to you, then causeth you to die, then gathereth you unto the
Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. But most of mankind know
not.

<span id="an_045_027">27</span> And unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty
of the heavens and the earth; and on the day when the Hour riseth, on
that day those who follow falsehood will be lost.

<span id="an_045_028">28</span> And thou wilt see each nation crouching,
each nation summoned to its record. (And it will be said unto them):
This day ye are requited what ye used to do.

<span id="an_045_029">29</span> This Our Book pronounceth against you
with truth. Lo! We have caused (all) that ye did to be recorded.

<span id="an_045_030">30</span> Then, as for those who believed and did
good works, their Lord will bring them in unto His mercy. That is the
evident triumph.

<span id="an_045_031">31</span> And as for those who disbelieved (it
will be said unto them): Were not Our revelations recited unto you ? But
ye were scornful and became a guilty folk.

<span id="an_045_032">32</span> And when it was said: Lo! Allah's
promise is the truth, and there is no doubt of the Hour's coming, ye
said: We know not what the Hour is. We deem it naught but a conjecture,
and we are by no means convinced.

<span id="an_045_033">33</span> And the evils of what they did will
appear unto them, and that which they used to deride will befall them.

<span id="an_045_034">34</span> And it will be said: This day We forget
you, even as ye forgot the meeting of this your day; and your habitation
is the Fire, and there is none to help you.

<span id="an_045_035">35</span> This, forasmuch as ye made the
revelations of Allah a jest, and the life of the world beguiled you.
Therefor this day they come not forth from thence, nor can they make
amends.

<span id="an_045_036">36</span> Then praise be to Allah, Lord of the
heavens and Lord of the earth, the Lord of the Worlds.

<span id="an_045_037">37</span> And unto Him (alone) belongeth Majesty
in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
