# 74. al-Mudathir: The Clothed One

<span id="an_074_001">1</span> O thou enveloped in thy cloak,

<span id="an_074_002">2</span> Arise and warn!

<span id="an_074_003">3</span> Thy Lord magnify,

<span id="an_074_004">4</span> Thy raiment purify,

<span id="an_074_005">5</span> Pollution shun!

<span id="an_074_006">6</span> And show not favour, seeking wordly gain!

<span id="an_074_007">7</span> For the sake of thy Lord, be patient!

<span id="an_074_008">8</span> For when the trumpet shall sound,

<span id="an_074_009">9</span> Surely that day will be a day of anguish,

<span id="an_074_010">10</span> Not of ease, for disbelievers.

<span id="an_074_011">11</span> Leave Me (to deal) with him whom I
created lonely,

<span id="an_074_012">12</span> And then bestowed upon him ample means,

<span id="an_074_013">13</span> And sons abiding in his presence

<span id="an_074_014">14</span> And made (life) smooth for him.

<span id="an_074_015">15</span> Yet he desireth that I should give more.

<span id="an_074_016">16</span> Nay! For lo! he hath been stubborn to
Our revelations.

<span id="an_074_017">17</span> On him I shall impose a fearful doom.

<span id="an_074_018">18</span> For lo! he did consider; then he planned
-

<span id="an_074_019">19</span> (Self-)destroyed is he, how he planned!

<span id="an_074_020">20</span> Again (self-)destroyed is he, how he
planned! -

<span id="an_074_021">21</span> Then looked he,

<span id="an_074_022">22</span> Then frowned he and showed displeasure.

<span id="an_074_023">23</span> Then turned he away in pride

<span id="an_074_024">24</span> And said: This is naught else than magic
from of old;

<span id="an_074_025">25</span> This is naught else than speech of
mortal man.

<span id="an_074_026">26</span> Him shall I fling unto the burning.

<span id="an_074_027">27</span>  - Ah, what will convey unto thee what
that burning is! -

<span id="an_074_028">28</span> It leaveth naught; it spareth naught

<span id="an_074_029">29</span> It shrivelleth the man.

<span id="an_074_030">30</span> Above it are nineteen.

<span id="an_074_031">31</span> We have appointed only angels to be
wardens of the Fire, and their number have We made to be a
stumbling-block for those who disbelieve; that those to whom the
Scripture hath been given may have certainty, and that believers may
increase in faith; and that those to whom the Scripture hath been given
and believers may not doubt; and that those in whose hearts there is
disease, and disbelievers, may say: What meaneth Allah by this
similitude ? Thus Allah sendeth astray whom He will, and whom He will He
guideth. None knoweth the hosts of thy Lord save Him. This is naught
else than a Reminder unto mortals.

<span id="an_074_032">32</span> Nay, by the Moon

<span id="an_074_033">33</span> And the night when it withdraweth

<span id="an_074_034">34</span> And the dawn when it shineth forth,

<span id="an_074_035">35</span> Lo! this is one of the greatest
(portents)

<span id="an_074_036">36</span> As a warning unto men,

<span id="an_074_037">37</span> Unto him of you who will advance or hang
back.

<span id="an_074_038">38</span> Every soul is a pledge for its own
deeds;

<span id="an_074_039">39</span> Save those who will stand on the right
hand.

<span id="an_074_040">40</span> In gardens they will ask one another

<span id="an_074_041">41</span> Concerning the guilty:

<span id="an_074_042">42</span> What hath brought you to this burning ?

<span id="an_074_043">43</span> They will answer: We were not of those
who prayed

<span id="an_074_044">44</span> Nor did we feed the wretched.

<span id="an_074_045">45</span> We used to wade (in vain dispute) with
(all) waders,

<span id="an_074_046">46</span> And we used to deny the Day of Judgment,

<span id="an_074_047">47</span> Till the Inevitable came unto us.

<span id="an_074_048">48</span> The mediation of no mediators will avail
them then.

<span id="an_074_049">49</span> Why now turn they away from the
Admonishment,

<span id="an_074_050">50</span> As they were frightened asses

<span id="an_074_051">51</span> Fleeing from a lion ?

<span id="an_074_052">52</span> Nay, but everyone of them desireth that
he should be given open pages (from Allah).

<span id="an_074_053">53</span> Nay, verily. They fear not the
Hereafter.

<span id="an_074_054">54</span> Nay, verily. Lo! this is an
Admonishment.

<span id="an_074_055">55</span> So whosoever will may heed.

<span id="an_074_056">56</span> And they will not heed unless Allah
willeth (it). He is the fount of fear. He is the fount of Mercy.
