------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 80. \`Abasa: He Frowned

<span id="an_080_001">1</span> He frowned and turned away

<span id="an_080_002">2</span> Because the blind man came unto him.

<span id="an_080_003">3</span> What could inform thee but that he might
grow (in grace)

<span id="an_080_004">4</span> Or take heed and so the reminder might
avail him ?

<span id="an_080_005">5</span> As for him who thinketh himself
independent,

<span id="an_080_006">6</span> Unto him thou payest regard.

<span id="an_080_007">7</span> Yet it is not thy concern if he grow not
(in grace).

<span id="an_080_008">8</span> But as for him who cometh unto thee with
earnest purpose

<span id="an_080_009">9</span> And hath fear,

<span id="an_080_010">10</span> From him thou art distracted.

<span id="an_080_011">11</span> Nay, but verily it is an Admonishment,

<span id="an_080_012">12</span> So let whosoever will pay heed to it,

<span id="an_080_013">13</span> On honoured leaves

<span id="an_080_014">14</span> Exalted, purified,

<span id="an_080_015">15</span> (Set down) by scribes

<span id="an_080_016">16</span> Noble and righteous.

<span id="an_080_017">17</span> Man is (self-)destroyed: how ungrateful!

<span id="an_080_018">18</span> From what thing doth He create him ?

<span id="an_080_019">19</span> From a drop of seed. He createth him and
proportioneth him,

<span id="an_080_020">20</span> Then maketh the way easy for him,

<span id="an_080_021">21</span> Then causeth him to die, and burieth
him;

<span id="an_080_022">22</span> Then, when He will, He bringeth him
again to life.

<span id="an_080_023">23</span> Nay, but (man) hath not done what He
commanded him.

<span id="an_080_024">24</span> Let man consider his food:

<span id="an_080_025">25</span> How We pour water in showers

<span id="an_080_026">26</span> Then split the earth in clefts

<span id="an_080_027">27</span> And cause the grain to grow therein

<span id="an_080_028">28</span> And grapes and green fodder

<span id="an_080_029">29</span> And olive-trees and palm-trees

<span id="an_080_030">30</span> And garden-closes of thick foliage

<span id="an_080_031">31</span> And fruits and grasses:

<span id="an_080_032">32</span> Provision for you and your cattle.

<span id="an_080_033">33</span> But when the Shout cometh

<span id="an_080_034">34</span> On the day when a man fleeth from his
brother

<span id="an_080_035">35</span> And his mother and his father

<span id="an_080_036">36</span> And his wife and his children,

<span id="an_080_037">37</span> Every man that day will have concern
enough to make him heedless (of others).

<span id="an_080_038">38</span> On that day faces will be bright as
dawn,

<span id="an_080_039">39</span> Laughing, rejoicing at good news;

<span id="an_080_040">40</span> And other faces, on that day, with dust
upon them,

<span id="an_080_041">41</span> Veiled in darkness,

<span id="an_080_042">42</span> Those are the disbelievers, the wicked.
