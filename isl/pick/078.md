# 78. an-Naba': The Tidings

<span id="an_078_001">1</span> Whereof do they question one another ?

<span id="an_078_002">2</span> (It is) of the awful tidings,

<span id="an_078_003">3</span> Concerning which they are in
disagreement.

<span id="an_078_004">4</span> Nay, but they will come to know!

<span id="an_078_005">5</span> Nay, again, but they will come to know!

<span id="an_078_006">6</span> Have We not made the earth an expanse,

<span id="an_078_007">7</span> And the high hills bulwarks ?

<span id="an_078_008">8</span> And We have created you in pairs,

<span id="an_078_009">9</span> And have appointed your sleep for repose,

<span id="an_078_010">10</span> And have appointed the night as a cloak,

<span id="an_078_011">11</span> And have appointed the day for
livelihood.

<span id="an_078_012">12</span> And We have built above you seven strong
(heavens),

<span id="an_078_013">13</span> And have appointed a dazzling lamp,

<span id="an_078_014">14</span> And have sent down from the rainy clouds
abundant water,

<span id="an_078_015">15</span> Thereby to produce grain and plant,

<span id="an_078_016">16</span> And gardens of thick foliage.

<span id="an_078_017">17</span> Lo! the Day of Decision is a fixed time,

<span id="an_078_018">18</span> A day when the trumpet is blown and ye
come in multitudes,

<span id="an_078_019">19</span> And the heaven is opened and becometh as
gates,

<span id="an_078_020">20</span> And the hills are set in motion and
become as a mirage.

<span id="an_078_021">21</span> Lo! hell lurketh in ambush,

<span id="an_078_022">22</span> A home for the rebellious.

<span id="an_078_023">23</span> They will abide therein for ages.

<span id="an_078_024">24</span> Therein taste they neither coolness nor
(any) drink

<span id="an_078_025">25</span> Save boiling water and a paralysing
cold:

<span id="an_078_026">26</span> Reward proportioned (to their evil
deeds).

<span id="an_078_027">27</span> For lo! they looked not for a reckoning;

<span id="an_078_028">28</span> They called Our revelations false with
strong denial.

<span id="an_078_029">29</span> Everything have We recorded in a Book.

<span id="an_078_030">30</span> So taste (of that which ye have earned).
No increase do We give you save of torment.

<span id="an_078_031">31</span> Lo! for the duteous is achievement -

<span id="an_078_032">32</span> Gardens enclosed and vineyards,

<span id="an_078_033">33</span> And maidens for companions,

<span id="an_078_034">34</span> And a full cup.

<span id="an_078_035">35</span> There hear they never vain discourse,
nor lying -

<span id="an_078_036">36</span> Requital from thy Lord - a gift in
payment -

<span id="an_078_037">37</span> Lord of the heavens and the earth, and
(all) that is between them, the Beneficent; with Whom none can converse.

<span id="an_078_038">38</span> On the day when the angels and the
Spirit stand arrayed, they speak not, saving him whom the Beneficent
alloweth and who speaketh right.

<span id="an_078_039">39</span> That is the True Day. So whoso will
should seek recourse unto his Lord.

<span id="an_078_040">40</span> Lo! We warn you of a doom at hand, a day
whereon a man will look on that which his own hands have sent before,
and the disbeliever will cry: "Would that I were dust!"
