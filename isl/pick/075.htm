<A NAME="an_075_001">1</A>&nbsp;Nay, I swear by the Day of Resurrection; </P>
<A NAME="an_075_002">2</A>&nbsp;Nay, I swear by the accusing soul (that this Scripture is true). </P>
<A NAME="an_075_003">3</A>&nbsp;Thinketh man that We shall not assemble his bones ? </P>
<A NAME="an_075_004">4</A>&nbsp;Yea, verily. We are Able to restore his very fingers! </P>
<A NAME="an_075_005">5</A>&nbsp;But man would fain deny what is before him. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_006">6</A>&nbsp;He asketh: When will be this Day of Resurrection ? </P>
<A NAME="an_075_007">7</A>&nbsp;But when sight is confounded </P>
<A NAME="an_075_008">8</A>&nbsp;And the moon is eclipsed </P>
<A NAME="an_075_009">9</A>&nbsp;And sun and moon are united, </P>
<A NAME="an_075_010">10</A>&nbsp;On that day man will cry: Whither to flee! </P>
<A NAME="an_075_011">11</A>&nbsp;Alas! No refuge! </P>
<A NAME="an_075_012">12</A>&nbsp;Unto thy Lord is the recourse that day. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_013">13</A>&nbsp;On that day man is told the tale of that which he hath sent before and left  behind. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_014">14</A>&nbsp;Oh, but man is a telling witness against himself, </P>
<A NAME="an_075_015">15</A>&nbsp;Although he tender his excuses. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_016">16</A>&nbsp;Stir not thy tongue herewith to hasten it. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_017">17</A>&nbsp;Lo! upon Us (resteth) the putting together thereof and the reading thereof. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_018">18</A>&nbsp;And when We read it, follow thou the reading; </P>
<A NAME="an_075_019">19</A>&nbsp;Then lo! upon Us (resteth) the explanation thereof. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_020">20</A>&nbsp;Nay, but ye do love the fleeting Now </P>
<A NAME="an_075_021">21</A>&nbsp;And neglect the Hereafter. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_022">22</A>&nbsp;That day will faces be resplendent, </P>
<A NAME="an_075_023">23</A>&nbsp;Looking toward their Lord; </P>
<A NAME="an_075_024">24</A>&nbsp;And that day will other faces be despondent, </P>
<A NAME="an_075_025">25</A>&nbsp;Thou wilt know that some great disaster is about to fall on them. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_026">26</A>&nbsp;Nay, but when the life cometh up to the throat </P>
<A NAME="an_075_027">27</A>&nbsp;And men say: Where is the wizard (who can save him now) ? </P>
<A NAME="an_075_028">28</A>&nbsp;And he knoweth that it is the parting; </P>
<A NAME="an_075_029">29</A>&nbsp;And agony is heaped on agony; </P>
<A NAME="an_075_030">30</A>&nbsp;Unto thy Lord that day will be the driving. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_031">31</A>&nbsp;For he neither trusted, nor prayed. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_032">32</A>&nbsp;But he denied and flouted. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_033">33</A>&nbsp;Then went he to his folk with glee. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_034">34</A>&nbsp;Nearer unto thee and nearer, </P>
<A NAME="an_075_035">35</A>&nbsp;Again nearer unto thee and nearer (is the doom). </P>
<A NAME="an_075_036">36</A>&nbsp;Thinketh man that he is to be left aimless ? </P>
<A NAME="an_075_037">37</A>&nbsp;Was he not a drop of fluid which gushed forth ? </P>
<A NAME="an_075_038">38</A>&nbsp;Then he became a clot; then (Allah) shaped and fashioned </P>
<A NAME="an_075_039">39</A>&nbsp;And made of him a pair, the male and female. </P>
<A NAME="an_075_040">40</A>&nbsp;Is not He (Who doeth so) Able to bring the dead to life ?
