------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 89. al-Fajr: The Dawn

<span id="an_089_001">1</span> By the Dawn

<span id="an_089_002">2</span> And ten nights,

<span id="an_089_003">3</span> And the Even and the Odd,

<span id="an_089_004">4</span> And the night when it departeth,

<span id="an_089_005">5</span> There surely is an oath for thinking man.

<span id="an_089_006">6</span> Dost thou not consider how thy Lord dealt
with (the tribe of) A'ad,

<span id="an_089_007">7</span> With many-columned Iram,

<span id="an_089_008">8</span> The like of which was not created in the
lands;

<span id="an_089_009">9</span> And with (the tribe of) Thamud, who clove
the rocks in the valley;

<span id="an_089_010">10</span> And with Pharaoh, firm of might,

<span id="an_089_011">11</span> Who (all) were rebellious (to Allah) in
these lands,

<span id="an_089_012">12</span> And multiplied iniquity therein ?

<span id="an_089_013">13</span> Therefore thy Lord poured on them the
disaster of His punishment.

<span id="an_089_014">14</span> Lo! thy Lord is ever watchful.

<span id="an_089_015">15</span> As for man, whenever his Lord trieth him
by honouring him, and is gracious unto him, he saith: My Lord honoureth
me.

<span id="an_089_016">16</span> But whenever He trieth him by
straitening his means of life, he saith: My Lord despiseth me.

<span id="an_089_017">17</span> Nay, but ye (for your part) honour not
the orphan

<span id="an_089_018">18</span> And urge not on the feeding of the poor.

<span id="an_089_019">19</span> And ye devour heritages with devouring
greed.

<span id="an_089_020">20</span> And love wealth with abounding love.

<span id="an_089_021">21</span> Nay, but when the earth is ground to
atoms, grinding, grinding,

<span id="an_089_022">22</span> And thy Lord shall come with angels,
rank on rank,

<span id="an_089_023">23</span> And hell is brought near that day; on
that day man will remember, but how will the remembrance (then avail
him) ?

<span id="an_089_024">24</span> He will say: Ah, would that I had sent
before me (some provision) for my life!

<span id="an_089_025">25</span> None punisheth as He will punish on that
day!

<span id="an_089_026">26</span> None bindeth as He then will bind.

<span id="an_089_027">27</span> But ah! thou soul at peace!

<span id="an_089_028">28</span> Return unto thy Lord, content in His
good pleasure!

<span id="an_089_029">29</span> Enter thou among My bondmen!

<span id="an_089_030">30</span> Enter thou My Garden!
