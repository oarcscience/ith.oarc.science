# 81. at-Takwir: The Cessation

<span id="an_081_001">1</span> When the sun is overthrown,

<span id="an_081_002">2</span> And when the stars fall,

<span id="an_081_003">3</span> And when the hills are moved,

<span id="an_081_004">4</span> And when the camels big with young are
abandoned,

<span id="an_081_005">5</span> And when the wild beasts are herded
together,

<span id="an_081_006">6</span> And when the seas rise,

<span id="an_081_007">7</span> And when souls are reunited,

<span id="an_081_008">8</span> And when the girl-child that was buried
alive is asked

<span id="an_081_009">9</span> For what sin she was slain,

<span id="an_081_010">10</span> And when the pages are laid open,

<span id="an_081_011">11</span> And when the sky is torn away,

<span id="an_081_012">12</span> And when hell is lighted,

<span id="an_081_013">13</span> And when the Garden is brought nigh,

<span id="an_081_014">14</span> (Then) every soul will know what it hath
made ready.

<span id="an_081_015">15</span> Oh, but I call to witness the planets,

<span id="an_081_016">16</span> The stars which rise and set,

<span id="an_081_017">17</span> And the close of night,

<span id="an_081_018">18</span> And the breath of morning

<span id="an_081_019">19</span> That this is in truth the word of an
honoured messenger,

<span id="an_081_020">20</span> Mighty, established in the presence of
the Lord of the Throne,

<span id="an_081_021">21</span> (One) to be obeyed, and trustworthy;

<span id="an_081_022">22</span> And your comrade is not mad.

<span id="an_081_023">23</span> Surely he beheld Him on the clear
horizon.

<span id="an_081_024">24</span> And he is not avid of the Unseen.

<span id="an_081_025">25</span> Nor is this the utterance of a devil
worthy to be stoned.

<span id="an_081_026">26</span> Whither then go ye ?

<span id="an_081_027">27</span> This is naught else than a reminder unto
creation,

<span id="an_081_028">28</span> Unto whomsoever of you willeth to walk
straight.

<span id="an_081_029">29</span> And ye will not, unless (it be) that
Allah willeth, the Lord of Creation.
