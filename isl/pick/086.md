The Meaning of the Glorious Qur'ân, by M.M. Pickthall, at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 86. at-Tariq: The Night-Comer

<span id="an_086_001">1</span> By the heaven and the Morning Star

<span id="an_086_002">2</span>  - Ah, what will tell thee what the
Morning Star is!

<span id="an_086_003">3</span> - The piercing Star!

<span id="an_086_004">4</span> No human soul but hath a guardian over
it.

<span id="an_086_005">5</span> So let man consider from what he is
created.

<span id="an_086_006">6</span> He is created from a gushing fluid

<span id="an_086_007">7</span> That issued from between the loins and
ribs.

<span id="an_086_008">8</span> Lo! He verily is Able to return him (unto
life)

<span id="an_086_009">9</span> On the day when hidden thoughts shall be
searched out.

<span id="an_086_010">10</span> Then will he have no might nor any
helper.

<span id="an_086_011">11</span> By the heaven which giveth the returning
rain,

<span id="an_086_012">12</span> And the earth which splitteth (with the
growth of trees and plants)

<span id="an_086_013">13</span> Lo! this (Qur'an) is a conclusive word,

<span id="an_086_014">14</span> It is no pleasantry.

<span id="an_086_015">15</span> Lo! they plot a plot (against thee, O
Muhammad)

<span id="an_086_016">16</span> And I plot a plot (against them).

<span id="an_086_017">17</span> So give a respite to the disbelievers.
Deal thou gently with them for a while.
