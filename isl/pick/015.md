The Meaning of the Glorious Qur'ân, by M.M. Pickthall, at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 15. al-Hijr: The Rock

<span id="an_015_001">1</span> Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verses of the
Scripture and a plain Reading.

<span id="an_015_002">2</span> It may be that those who disbelieve wish
ardently that they were Muslims.

<span id="an_015_003">3</span> Let them eat and enjoy life, and let
(false) hope beguile them. They will come to know!

<span id="an_015_004">4</span> And We destroyed no township but there
was a known decree for it.

<span id="an_015_005">5</span> No nation can outstrip its term nor can
they lag behind.

<span id="an_015_006">6</span> And they say: O thou unto whom the
Reminder is revealed, lo! thou art indeed a madman!

<span id="an_015_007">7</span> Why bringest thou not angels unto us, if
thou art of the truthful ?

<span id="an_015_008">8</span> We send not down the angels save with the
Fact, and in that case (the disbelievers) would not be tolerated.

<span id="an_015_009">9</span> Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and
lo! We verily are its Guardian.

<span id="an_015_010">10</span> We verily sent (messengers) before thee
among the factions of the men of old.

<span id="an_015_011">11</span> And never came there unto them a
messenger but they did mock him.

<span id="an_015_012">12</span> Thus do We make it traverse the hearts
of the guilty:

<span id="an_015_013">13</span> They believe not therein, though the
example of the men of old hath gone before.

<span id="an_015_014">14</span> And even if We opened unto them a gate
of heaven and they kept mounting through it,

<span id="an_015_015">15</span> They would say: Our sight is wrong -
nay, but we are folk bewitched.

<span id="an_015_016">16</span> And verily in the heaven we have set
mansions of the stars, and We have beautified it for beholders.

<span id="an_015_017">17</span> And We have guarded it from every
outcast devil,

<span id="an_015_018">18</span> Save him who stealeth the hearing, and
them doth a clear flame pursue.

<span id="an_015_019">19</span> And the earth have We spread out, and
placed therein firm hills, and caused each seemly thing to grow therein.

<span id="an_015_020">20</span> And we have given unto you livelihoods
therein, and unto those for whom ye provide not.

<span id="an_015_021">21</span> And there is not a thing but with Us are
the stores thereof. And we send it not down save in appointed measure.

<span id="an_015_022">22</span> And We send the winds fertilising, and
cause water to descend from the sky, and give it you to drink. It is not
ye who are the holders of the store thereof.

<span id="an_015_023">23</span> Lo! and it is We, even We, Who quicken
and give death, and We are the Inheritor.

<span id="an_015_024">24</span> And verily We know the eager among you
and verily We know the laggards.

<span id="an_015_025">25</span> Lo! thy Lord will gather them together.
Lo! He is Wise, Aware.

<span id="an_015_026">26</span> Verily We created man of potter's clay
of black mud altered,

<span id="an_015_027">27</span> And the jinn did We create aforetime of
essential fire.

<span id="an_015_028">28</span> And (remember) when thy Lord said unto
the angels: Lo! I am creating a mortal out of potter's clay of black mud
altered,

<span id="an_015_029">29</span> So, when I have made him and have
breathed into him of My Spirit, do ye fall down, prostrating yourselves
unto him.

<span id="an_015_030">30</span> So the angels fell prostrate, all of
them together

<span id="an_015_031">31</span> Save Iblis. He refused to be among the
prostrate.

<span id="an_015_032">32</span> He said: O Iblis! What aileth thee that
thou art not among the prostrate ?

<span id="an_015_033">33</span> He said: I am not one to prostrate
myself unto a mortal whom Thou hast created out of potter's clay of
black mud altered!

<span id="an_015_034">34</span> He said: Then go thou forth from hence,
for lo! thou art outcast.

<span id="an_015_035">35</span> And lo! the curse shall be upon thee
till the Day of Judgment.

<span id="an_015_036">36</span> He said: My Lord! Reprieve me till the
day when they are raised.

<span id="an_015_037">37</span> He said: Then lo! thou art of those
reprieved

<span id="an_015_038">38</span> Till the Day of appointed time.

<span id="an_015_039">39</span> He said: My Lord! Because Thou hast sent
me astray, I verily shall adorn the path of error for them in the earth,
and shall mislead them every one,

<span id="an_015_040">40</span> Save such of them as are Thy perfectly
devoted slaves.

<span id="an_015_041">41</span> He said: This is a right course
incumbent upon Me:

<span id="an_015_042">42</span> Lo! as for My slaves, thou hast no power
over any of them save such of the froward as follow thee,

<span id="an_015_043">43</span> And lo! for all such, hell will be the
promised place.

<span id="an_015_044">44</span> It hath seven gates, and each gate hath
an appointed portion.

<span id="an_015_045">45</span> Lo! those who ward off (evil) are among
gardens and watersprings.

<span id="an_015_046">46</span> (And it is said unto them): Enter them
in peace, secure.

<span id="an_015_047">47</span> And We remove whatever rancour may be in
their breasts. As brethren, face to face, (they rest) on couches raised.

<span id="an_015_048">48</span> Toil cometh not unto them there, nor
will they be expelled from thence.

<span id="an_015_049">49</span> Announce, (O Muhammad) unto My slaves
that verily I am the Forgiving, the Merciful,

<span id="an_015_050">50</span> And that My doom is the dolorous doom.

<span id="an_015_051">51</span> And tell them of Abraham's guests,

<span id="an_015_052">52</span> (How) when they came in unto him, and
said: Peace. He said: Lo! we are afraid of you.

<span id="an_015_053">53</span> They said: Be not afraid! Lo! we bring
thee good tidings of a boy possessing wisdom.

<span id="an_015_054">54</span> He said: Bring ye me good tidings (of a
son) when old age hath overtaken me ? Of what then can ye bring good
tidings ?

<span id="an_015_055">55</span> They said: We bring thee good tidings in
truth. So be not thou of the despairing.

<span id="an_015_056">56</span> He said: And who despaireth of the mercy
of his Lord save those who are astray ?

<span id="an_015_057">57</span> He said: And afterward what is your
business, O ye messengers (of Allah) ?

<span id="an_015_058">58</span> They said: We have been sent unto a
guilty folk,

<span id="an_015_059">59</span> (All) save the family of Lot. Them we
shall deliver every one,

<span id="an_015_060">60</span> Except his wife, of whom We had decreed
that she should be of those who stay behind.

<span id="an_015_061">61</span> And when the messengers came unto the
family of Lot,

<span id="an_015_062">62</span> He said: Lo! ye are folk unknown (to
me).

<span id="an_015_063">63</span> They said: Nay, but we bring thee that
concerning which they keep disputing,

<span id="an_015_064">64</span> And bring thee the Truth, and lo! we are
truth-tellers.

<span id="an_015_065">65</span> So travel with thy household in a
portion of the night, and follow thou their backs. Let none of you turn
round, but go whither ye are commanded.

<span id="an_015_066">66</span> And We made plain the case to him, that
the root of them (who did wrong) was to be cut at early morn.

<span id="an_015_067">67</span> And the people of the city came,
rejoicing at the news (of new arrivals).

<span id="an_015_068">68</span> He said: Lo! they are my guests. Affront
me not!

<span id="an_015_069">69</span> And keep your duty to Allah, and shame
me not!

<span id="an_015_070">70</span> They said; Have we not forbidden you
from (entertaining) anyone ?

<span id="an_015_071">71</span> He said: Here are my daughters, if ye
must be doing (so).

<span id="an_015_072">72</span> By thy life (O Muhammad) they moved
blindly in the frenzy of approaching death.

<span id="an_015_073">73</span> Then the (Awful) Cry overtook them at
the sunrise.

<span id="an_015_074">74</span> And We utterly confounded them, and We
rained upon them stones of heated clay.

<span id="an_015_075">75</span> Lo! therein verily are portents for
those who read the signs.

<span id="an_015_076">76</span> And lo! it is upon a road still
uneffaced.

<span id="an_015_077">77</span> Lo! therein is indeed a portent for
believers.

<span id="an_015_078">78</span> And the dwellers in the wood indeed were
evil-doers.

<span id="an_015_079">79</span> So we took vengeance on them; and lo!
they both are on a high-road plain to see.

<span id="an_015_080">80</span> And the dwellers in Al-Hijr denied (Our)
messengers.

<span id="an_015_081">81</span> And we gave them Our revelations, but
they were averse to them.

<span id="an_015_082">82</span> And they used to hew out dwellings from
the hills, (wherein they dwelt) secure.

<span id="an_015_083">83</span> But the (Awful) Cry overtook them at the
morning hour,

<span id="an_015_084">84</span> And that which they were wont to count
as gain availed them not.

<span id="an_015_085">85</span> We created not the heavens and the earth
and all that is between them save with truth, and lo! the Hour is surely
coming. So forgive, (O Muhammad), with a gracious forgiveness.

<span id="an_015_086">86</span> Lo! Thy Lord! He is the All-Wise
Creator.

<span id="an_015_087">87</span> We have given thee seven of the
oft-repeated (verses) and the great Qur'an.

<span id="an_015_088">88</span> Strain not thine eyes toward that which
We cause some wedded pairs among them to enjoin, and be not grieved on
their account, and lower thy wing (in tenderness) for the believers.

<span id="an_015_089">89</span> And say: Lo! I, even I, am a plain
warner,

<span id="an_015_090">90</span> Such as We send down for those who make
division,

<span id="an_015_091">91</span> Those who break the Qur'an into parts.

<span id="an_015_092">92</span> Them, by thy Lord, We shall question,
every one,

<span id="an_015_093">93</span> Of what they used to do.

<span id="an_015_094">94</span> So proclaim that which thou art
commanded, and withdraw from the idolaters.

<span id="an_015_095">95</span> Lo! We defend thee from the scoffers,

<span id="an_015_096">96</span> Who set some other god along with Allah.
But they will come to know.

<span id="an_015_097">97</span> Well know We that thy bosom is oppressed
by what they say,

<span id="an_015_098">98</span> But hymn the praise of thy Lord, and be
of those who make prostration (unto Him).

<span id="an_015_099">99</span> And serve thy Lord till the Inevitable
cometh unto thee.
