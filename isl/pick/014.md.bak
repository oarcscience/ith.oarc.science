------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 14. Ibrahim: Abraham

<span id="an_014_001">1</span> Alif. Lam. Ra. (This is) a Scripture
which We have revealed unto thee (Muhammad) that thereby thou mayst
bring forth mankind from darkness unto light, by the permission of their
Lord, unto the path of the Mighty, the Owner of Praise,

<span id="an_014_002">2</span> Allah, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is
in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. and woe unto the
disbelievers from an awful doom;

<span id="an_014_003">3</span> Those who love the life of the world more
than the Hereafter, and debar (men) from the way of Allah and would have
it crooked: such are far astray.

<span id="an_014_004">4</span> And We never sent a messenger save with
the language of his folk, that he might make (the message) clear for
them. Then Allah sendeth whom He will astray, and guideth whom He will.
He is the Mighty, the Wise.

<span id="an_014_005">5</span> We verily sent Moses with Our
revelations, saying: Bring thy people forth from darkness unto light.
And remind them of the days of Allah. Lo! therein are revelations for
each steadfast, thankful (heart).

<span id="an_014_006">6</span> And (remind them) how Moses said unto his
people: Remember Allah's favour unto you when He delivered you from
Pharaoh's folk who were afflicting you with dreadful torment, and were
slaying your sons and sparing your women; that was a tremendous trial
from your Lord.

<span id="an_014_007">7</span> And when your Lord proclaimed: If ye give
thanks, I will give you more; but if ye are thankless, lo! My punishment
is dire.

<span id="an_014_008">8</span> And Moses said: Though ye and all who are
in the earth prove thankless, lo! Allah verily is Absolute, Owner of
Praise.

<span id="an_014_009">9</span> Hath not the history of those before you
reached you: the folk of Noah, and (the tribes of) A'ad and Thamud, and
those after them ? None save Allah knoweth them. Their messengers came
unto them with clear proofs, but they thrust their hands into their
mouths, and said: Lo! we disbelieve in that wherewith ye have been sent,
and lo! we are in grave doubt concerning that to which ye call us.

<span id="an_014_010">10</span> Their messengers said: Can there be
doubt concerning Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth ? He
calleth you that He may forgive you your sins and reprieve you unto an
appointed term. They said: Ye are but mortals like us, who would fain
turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring some
clear warrant.

<span id="an_014_011">11</span> Their messengers said unto them: We are
but mortals like you, but Allah giveth grace unto whom He will of His
slaves. It is not ours to bring you a warrant unless by the permission
of Allah. In Allah let believers put their trust!

<span id="an_014_012">12</span> How should we not put our trust in Allah
when He hath shown us our ways ? We surely will endure the hurt ye do
us. In Allah let the trusting put their trust.

<span id="an_014_013">13</span> And those who disbelieved said unto
their messengers: Verily we will drive you out from our land, unless ye
return to our religion. Then their Lord inspired them, (saying): Verily
we shall destroy the wrong-doers,

<span id="an_014_014">14</span> And verily We shall make you to dwell in
the land after them. This is for him who feareth My Majesty and feareth
My threats.

<span id="an_014_015">15</span> And they sought help (from their Lord)
and every froward potentate was bought to naught;

<span id="an_014_016">16</span> Hell is before him, and he is made to
drink a festering water,

<span id="an_014_017">17</span> Which he sippeth but can hardly swallow,
and death cometh unto him from every side while yet he cannot die, and
before him is a harsh doom.

<span id="an_014_018">18</span> A similitude of those who disbelieve in
their Lord: Their works are as ashes which the wind bloweth hard upon a
stormy day. They have no control of aught that they have earned. That is
the extreme failure.

<span id="an_014_019">19</span> Hast thou not seen that Allah hath
created the heavens and the earth with truth ? If He will, He can remove
you and bring (in) some new creation;

<span id="an_014_020">20</span> And that is no great matter for Allah.

<span id="an_014_021">21</span> They all come forth unto their Lord.
Then those who were despised say unto those who were scornful: We were
unto you a following, can ye then avert from us aught of Allah's doom ?
They say: Had Allah guided us, we should have guided you. Whether we
rage or patiently endure is (now) all one for us; we have no place of
refuge.

<span id="an_014_022">22</span> And Satan saith, when the matter hath
been decided: Lo! Allah promised you a promise of truth; and I promised
you, then failed you. And I had no power over you save that I called
unto you and ye obeyed me. So blame not, but blame yourselves. I cannot
help you, nor can ye help me, Lo! I disbelieved in that which ye before
ascribed to me. Lo! for wrong-doers is a painful doom.

<span id="an_014_023">23</span> And those who believed and did good
works are made to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein
abiding by permission of their Lord, their greeting therein: Peace!

<span id="an_014_024">24</span> Seest thou not how Allah coineth a
similitude: A goodly saying, as a goodly tree, its root set firm, its
branches reaching into heaven,

<span id="an_014_025">25</span> Giving its fruit at every season by
permission of its Lord ? Allah coineth the similitudes for mankind in
order that they may reflect.

<span id="an_014_026">26</span> And the similitude of a bad saying is as
a bad tree, uprooted from upon the earth, possessing no stability.

<span id="an_014_027">27</span> Allah confirmeth those who believe by a
firm saying in the life of the world and in the Hereafter, and Allah
sendeth wrong-doers astray. And Allah doeth what He will.

<span id="an_014_028">28</span> Hast thou not seen those who gave the
grace of Allah in exchange for thanklessness and led their people down
to the Abode of Loss,

<span id="an_014_029">29</span> (Even to) hell ? They are exposed
thereto. A hapless end!

<span id="an_014_030">30</span> And they set up rivals to Allah that
they may mislead (men) from His way. Say: Enjoy life (while ye may) for
lo! your journey's end will be the Fire.

<span id="an_014_031">31</span> Tell My bondmen who believe to establish
worship and spend of that which We have given them, secretly and
publicly, before a day cometh wherein there will be neither traffick nor
befriending.

<span id="an_014_032">32</span> Allah is He Who created the heavens and
the earth, and causeth water to descend from the sky, thereby producing
fruits as food for you, and maketh the ships to be of service unto you,
that they may run upon the sea at His command, and hath made of service
unto you the rivers;

<span id="an_014_033">33</span> And maketh the sun and the moon,
constant in their courses, to be of service unto you, and hath made of
service unto you the night and the day.

<span id="an_014_034">34</span> And He giveth you of all ye ask of Him,
and if ye would count the bounty of Allah ye cannot reckon it. Lo! man
is verily a wrong-doer, an ingrate.

<span id="an_014_035">35</span> And when Abraham said: My Lord! Make
safe this territory, and preserve me and my sons from serving idols.

<span id="an_014_036">36</span> My Lord! Lo! they have led many of
mankind astray. But whoso followeth me, he verily is of me. And whoso
disobeyeth me - Still Thou art Forgiving, Merciful.

<span id="an_014_037">37</span> Our Lord! Lo! I have settled some of my
posterity in an uncultivable valley near unto Thy holy House, our Lord!
that they may establish proper worship; so incline some hearts of men
that they may yearn toward them, and provide Thou them with fruits in
order that they may be thankful.

<span id="an_014_038">38</span> Our Lord! Lo! Thou knowest that which we
hide and that which we proclaim. Nothing in the earth or in the heaven
is hidden from Allah.

<span id="an_014_039">39</span> Praise be to Allah Who hath given me, in
my old age, Ishmael and Isaac! Lo! my Lord is indeed the Hearer of
Prayer.

<span id="an_014_040">40</span> My Lord! Make me to establish proper
worship, and some of my posterity (also); our Lord! and accept my
prayer.

<span id="an_014_041">41</span> Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents and
believers on the day when the account is cast.

<span id="an_014_042">42</span> Deem not that Allah is unaware of what
the wicked do. He but giveth them a respite till a day when eyes will
stare (in terror),

<span id="an_014_043">43</span> As they come hurrying on in fear, their
heads upraised, their gaze returning not to them, and their hearts as
air.

<span id="an_014_044">44</span> And warn mankind of a day when the doom
will come upon them, and those who did wrong will say: Our Lord!
Reprieve us for a little while. We will obey Thy call and will follow
the messengers. (It will be answered): Did ye not swear before that
there would be no end for you ?

<span id="an_014_045">45</span> And (have ye not) dwelt in the dwellings
of those who wronged themselves (of old) and (hath it not) become plain
to you how We dealt with them and made examples for you ?

<span id="an_014_046">46</span> Verily they have plotted their plot, and
their plot is with Allah, though their plot were one whereby the
mountains should be moved.

<span id="an_014_047">47</span> So think not that Allah will fail to
keep His promise to His messengers. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Able to Requite
(the wrong).

<span id="an_014_048">48</span> On the day when the earth will be
changed to other than the earth, and the heavens (also will be changed)
and they will come forth unto Allah, the One, the Almighty,

<span id="an_014_049">49</span> Thou wilt see the guilty on that day
linked together in chains,

<span id="an_014_050">50</span> Their raiment of pitch, and the Fire
covering their faces,

<span id="an_014_051">51</span> That Allah may repay each soul what it
hath earned. Lo! Allah is swift at reckoning.

<span id="an_014_052">52</span> This is a clear message for mankind in
order that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that He is
only One God, and that men of understanding may take heed.
