The Meaning of the Glorious Qur'ân, by M.M. Pickthall, at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 69. al-Haqqah: The Inevitable

<span id="an_069_001">1</span> The Reality!

<span id="an_069_002">2</span> What is the Reality ?

<span id="an_069_003">3</span> Ah, what will convey unto thee what the
reality is!

<span id="an_069_004">4</span> (The tribes of) Thamud and A'ad
disbelieved in the judgment to come.

<span id="an_069_005">5</span> As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the
lightning.

<span id="an_069_006">6</span> And as for A'ad, they were destroyed by a
fierce roaring wind,

<span id="an_069_007">7</span> Which He imposed on them for seven long
nights and eight long days so that thou mightest have seen men lying
overthrown, as they were hollow trunks of palm- trees.

<span id="an_069_008">8</span> Canst thou (O Muhammad) see any remnant
of them ?

<span id="an_069_009">9</span> And Pharaoh and those before him, and the
communities that were destroyed, brought error,

<span id="an_069_010">10</span> And they disobeyed the messenger of
their Lord, therefor did He grip them with a tightening grip.

<span id="an_069_011">11</span> Lo! when the waters rose, We carried you
upon the ship

<span id="an_069_012">12</span> That We might make it a memorial for
you, and that remembering ears (that heard the story) might remember.

<span id="an_069_013">13</span> And when the trumpet shall sound one
blast

<span id="an_069_014">14</span> And the earth with the mountains shall
be lifted up and crushed with one crash,

<span id="an_069_015">15</span> Then, on that day will the Event befall.

<span id="an_069_016">16</span> And the heaven will split asunder, for
that day it will be frail.

<span id="an_069_017">17</span> And the angels will be on the sides
thereof, and eight will uphold the Throne of thy Lord that day, above
them.

<span id="an_069_018">18</span> On that day ye will be exposed; not a
secret of you will be hidden.

<span id="an_069_019">19</span> Then, as for him who is given his record
in his right hand, he will say: Take, read my book!

<span id="an_069_020">20</span> Surely I knew that I should have to meet
my reckoning.

<span id="an_069_021">21</span> Then he will be in blissful state

<span id="an_069_022">22</span> In a high garden

<span id="an_069_023">23</span> Whereof the clusters are in easy reach.

<span id="an_069_024">24</span> (And it will be said unto those
therein): Eat and drink at ease for that which ye sent on before you in
past days.

<span id="an_069_025">25</span> But as for him who is given his record
in his left hand, he will say: Oh, would that I had not been given my
book

<span id="an_069_026">26</span> And knew not what my reckoning!

<span id="an_069_027">27</span> Oh, would that it had been death!

<span id="an_069_028">28</span> My wealth hath not availed me,

<span id="an_069_029">29</span> My power hath gone from me.

<span id="an_069_030">30</span> (It will be said): Take him and fetter
him

<span id="an_069_031">31</span> And then expose him to hell-fire

<span id="an_069_032">32</span> And then insert him in a chain whereof
the length is seventy cubits.

<span id="an_069_033">33</span> Lo! He used not to believe in Allah the
Tremendous,

<span id="an_069_034">34</span> And urged not on the feeding of the
wretched.

<span id="an_069_035">35</span> Therefor hath he no lover here this day,

<span id="an_069_036">36</span> Nor any food save filth

<span id="an_069_037">37</span> Which none but sinners eat.

<span id="an_069_038">38</span> But nay! I swear by all that ye see

<span id="an_069_039">39</span> And all that ye see not

<span id="an_069_040">40</span> That it is indeed the speech of an
illustrious messenger.

<span id="an_069_041">41</span> It is not poet's speech - little is it
that ye believe!

<span id="an_069_042">42</span> Nor diviner's speech - little is it that
ye remember!

<span id="an_069_043">43</span> It is a revelation from the Lord of the
Worlds.

<span id="an_069_044">44</span> And if he had invented false sayings
concerning Us,

<span id="an_069_045">45</span> We assuredly had taken him by the right
hand

<span id="an_069_046">46</span> And then severed his life-artery,

<span id="an_069_047">47</span> And not one of you could have held Us
off from him.

<span id="an_069_048">48</span> And lo! it is a warrant unto those who
ward off (evil).

<span id="an_069_049">49</span> And lo! We know that some among you will
deny (it).

<span id="an_069_050">50</span> And lo! it is indeed an anguish for the
disbelievers.

<span id="an_069_051">51</span> And lo! it is absolute truth.

<span id="an_069_052">52</span> So glorify the name of thy Tremendous
Lord.
