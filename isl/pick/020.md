------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 20. Ta Ha: Ta Ha

<span id="an_020_001">1</span> Ta. Ha.

<span id="an_020_002">2</span> We have not revealed unto thee (Muhammad)
this Qur'an that thou shouldst be distressed,

<span id="an_020_003">3</span> But as a reminder unto him who feareth,

<span id="an_020_004">4</span> A revelation from Him Who created the
earth and the high heavens,

<span id="an_020_005">5</span> The Beneficent One, Who is established on
the Throne.

<span id="an_020_006">6</span> Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the
heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and whatsoever is between them,
and whatsoever is beneath the sod.

<span id="an_020_007">7</span> And if thou speakest aloud, then lo! He
knoweth the secret (thought) and (that which is yet) more hidden.

<span id="an_020_008">8</span> Allah! There is no God save Him. His are
the most beautiful names.

<span id="an_020_009">9</span> Hath there come unto thee the story of
Moses ?

<span id="an_020_010">10</span> When he saw a fire and said unto his
folk: Lo! Wait! I see a fire afar off. Peradventure I may bring you a
brand therefrom or may find guidance at the fire.

<span id="an_020_011">11</span> And when he reached it, he was called by
name: O Moses!

<span id="an_020_012">12</span> Lo! I, even I, am thy Lord, So take off
thy shoes, for lo! thou art in the holy valley of Tuwa.

<span id="an_020_013">13</span> And I have chosen thee, so hearken unto
that which is inspired.

<span id="an_020_014">14</span> Lo! I, even I, am Allah, There is no God
save Me. So serve Me and establish worship for My remembrance.

<span id="an_020_015">15</span> Lo! the Hour is surely coming. But I
will to keep it hidden, that every soul may be rewarded for that which
it striveth (to achieve).

<span id="an_020_016">16</span> Therefor, let not him turn thee aside
from (the thought of) it who believeth not therein but followeth his own
desire, lest thou perish.

<span id="an_020_017">17</span> And what is that in thy right hand, O
Moses ?

<span id="an_020_018">18</span> He said: This is my staff whereon I
lean, and wherewith I bear down branches for my sheep, and wherein I
find other uses.

<span id="an_020_019">19</span> He said: Cast it down, O Moses!

<span id="an_020_020">20</span> So he cast it down, and lo! it was a
serpent, gliding.

<span id="an_020_021">21</span> He said: Grasp it and fear not. We shall
return it to its former state.

<span id="an_020_022">22</span> And thrust thy hand within thine armpit,
it will come forth white without hurt. (That will be) another token.

<span id="an_020_023">23</span> That We may show thee (some) of Our
greater portents,

<span id="an_020_024">24</span> Go thou unto Pharaoh! Lo! he hath
transgressed (the bounds).

<span id="an_020_025">25</span> (Moses) said: My Lord! relieve my mind

<span id="an_020_026">26</span> And ease my task for me;

<span id="an_020_027">27</span> And loose a knot from my tongue,

<span id="an_020_028">28</span> That they may understand my saying.

<span id="an_020_029">29</span> Appoint for me a henchman from my folk,

<span id="an_020_030">30</span> Aaron, my brother.

<span id="an_020_031">31</span> Confirm my strength with him

<span id="an_020_032">32</span> And let him share my task,

<span id="an_020_033">33</span> That we may glorify Thee much

<span id="an_020_034">34</span> And much remember Thee.

<span id="an_020_035">35</span> Lo! Thou art ever Seeing us.

<span id="an_020_036">36</span> He said: Thou art granted thy request, O
Moses.

<span id="an_020_037">37</span> And indeed, another time, already We
have shown thee favour,

<span id="an_020_038">38</span> When we inspired in thy mother that
which is inspired,

<span id="an_020_039">39</span> Saying: Throw him into the ark, and
throw it into the river, then the river shall throw it on to the bank,
and there an enemy to Me and an enemy to him shall take him. And I
endued thee with love from Me that thou mightest be trained according to
My will,

<span id="an_020_040">40</span> When thy sister went and said: Shall I
show you one who will nurse him ? and we restored thee to thy mother
that her eyes might be refreshed and might not sorrow. And thou didst
kill a man and We delivered thee from great distress, and tried thee
with a heavy trial. And thou didst tarry years among the folk of Midian.
Then camest thou (hither) by (My) providence, O Moses,

<span id="an_020_041">41</span> And I have attached thee to Myself.

<span id="an_020_042">42</span> Go, thou and thy brother, with My
tokens, and be not faint in remembrance of Me.

<span id="an_020_043">43</span> Go, both of you, unto Pharaoh. Lo! he
hath transgressed (the bounds).

<span id="an_020_044">44</span> And speak unto him a gentle word, that
peradventure he may heed or fear.

<span id="an_020_045">45</span> They said: Our Lord! Lo! we fear that he
may be beforehand with us or that he may play the tyrant.

<span id="an_020_046">46</span> He said: Fear not. Lo! I am with you
twain, Hearing and Seeing.

<span id="an_020_047">47</span> So go ye unto him and say: Lo! we are
two messengers of thy Lord. So let the children of Israel go with us,
and torment them not. We bring thee a token from thy Lord. And peace
will be for him who followeth right guidance.

<span id="an_020_048">48</span> Lo! it hath been revealed unto us that
the doom will be for him who denieth and turneth away.

<span id="an_020_049">49</span> (Pharaoh) said: Who then is the Lord of
you twain, O Moses ?

<span id="an_020_050">50</span> He said: Our Lord is He Who gave unto
everything its nature, then guided it aright.

<span id="an_020_051">51</span> He said: What then is the state of the
generations of old ?

<span id="an_020_052">52</span> He said: The knowledge thereof is with
my Lord in a Record. My Lord neither erreth nor forgetteth,

<span id="an_020_053">53</span> Who hath appointed the earth as a bed
and hath threaded roads for you therein and hath sent down water from
the sky and thereby We have brought forth divers kinds of vegetation,

<span id="an_020_054">54</span> (Saying): Eat ye and feed your cattle.
Lo! herein verily are portents for men of thought.

<span id="an_020_055">55</span> Thereof We created you, and thereunto We
return you, and thence We bring you forth a second time.

<span id="an_020_056">56</span> And We verily did show him all Our
tokens, but he denied them and refused.

<span id="an_020_057">57</span> He said: Hast come to drive us out from
our land by thy magic, O Moses ?

<span id="an_020_058">58</span> But we surely can produce for thee magic
the like thereof; so appoint a tryst between us and you, which neither
we nor thou shall fail to keep, at a place convenient (to us both).

<span id="an_020_059">59</span> (Moses) said: Your tryst shall be the
day of the feast, and let the people assemble when the sun hath risen
high.

<span id="an_020_060">60</span> Then Pharaoh went and gathered his
strength, then came (to the appointed tryst).

<span id="an_020_061">61</span> Moses said unto them: Woe unto you!
Invent not a lie against Allah, lest He extirpate you by some
punishment. He who lieth faileth miserably.

<span id="an_020_062">62</span> Then they debated one with another what
they must do, and they kept their counsel secret.

<span id="an_020_063">63</span> They said: Lo! these are two wizards who
would drive you out from your country by their magic, and destroy your
best traditions;

<span id="an_020_064">64</span> So arrange your plan, and come in battle
line. Whoso is uppermost this day will be indeed successful.

<span id="an_020_065">65</span> They said: O Moses! Either throw first,
or let us be the first to throw ?

<span id="an_020_066">66</span> He said: Nay, do ye throw! Then lo!
their cords and their staves, by their magic, appeared to him as though
they ran.

<span id="an_020_067">67</span> And Moses conceived a fear in his mind.

<span id="an_020_068">68</span> We said: Fear not! Lo! thou art the
higher.

<span id="an_020_069">69</span> Throw that which is in thy right hand!
It will eat up that which they have made. Lo! that which they have made
is but a wizard's artifice, and a wizard shall not be successful to
whatever point (of skill) he may attain.

<span id="an_020_070">70</span> Then the wizards were (all) flung down
prostrate, crying: We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.

<span id="an_020_071">71</span> (Pharaoh) said: Ye put faith in him
before I give you leave. Lo! he is your chief who taught you magic. Now
surely I shall cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and I shall
crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and ye shall know for certain
which of us hath sterner and more lasting punishment.

<span id="an_020_072">72</span> They said: We choose thee not above the
clear proofs that have come unto us, and above Him Who created us. So
decree what thou wilt decree. Thou wilt end for us only this life of the
world.

<span id="an_020_073">73</span> Lo! we believe in our Lord, that He may
forgive us our sins and the magic unto which thou didst force us. Allah
is better and more lasting.

<span id="an_020_074">74</span> Lo! whoso cometh guilty unto his Lord,
verily for him is hell. There he will neither die nor live.

<span id="an_020_075">75</span> But whoso cometh unto Him a believer,
having done good works, for such are the high stations;

<span id="an_020_076">76</span> Gardens of Eden underneath which rivers
flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the reward of him who
groweth.

<span id="an_020_077">77</span> And verily We inspired Moses, saying:
Take away My slaves by night and strike for them a dry path in the sea,
fearing not to be overtaken, neither being afraid (of the sea).

<span id="an_020_078">78</span> Then Pharaoh followed them with his
hosts and there covered them that which did cover them of the sea.

<span id="an_020_079">79</span> And Pharaoh led his folk astray, he did
not guide them.

<span id="an_020_080">80</span> O Children of Israel! We delivered you
from your enemy, and we made a covenant with you on the holy mountain's
side, and sent down on you the manna and the quails,

<span id="an_020_081">81</span> (Saying): Eat of the good things
wherewith We have provided you, and transgress not in respect thereof
lest My wrath come upon you: and he on whom My wrath cometh, he is lost
indeed.

<span id="an_020_082">82</span> And lo! verily I am Forgiving toward him
who repenteth and believeth and doeth good, and afterward walketh
aright.

<span id="an_020_083">83</span> And (it was said): What hath made thee
hasten from thy folk, O Moses ?

<span id="an_020_084">84</span> He said: They are close upon my track. I
hastened unto Thee, my Lord, that Thou mightest be well pleased.

<span id="an_020_085">85</span> He said: Lo! We have tried thy folk in
thine absence, and As-Samiri hath misled them.

<span id="an_020_086">86</span> Then Moses went back unto his folk,
angry and sad. He said: O my people! Hath not your Lord promised you a
fair promise ? Did the time appointed then appear too long for you, or
did ye wish that wrath from your Lord should come upon you, that ye
broke tryst with me ?

<span id="an_020_087">87</span> They said: We broke not tryst with thee
of our own will, but we were laden with burdens of ornaments of the
folk, then cast them (in the fire), for thus As-Samiri proposed.

<span id="an_020_088">88</span> Then he produced for them a calf, of
saffron hue, which gave forth a lowing sound. And they cried: This is
your god and the god of Moses, but he hath forgotten.

<span id="an_020_089">89</span> See they not, then, that it returneth no
saying unto them and possesseth for them neither hurt nor use ?

<span id="an_020_090">90</span> And Aaron indeed had told them
beforehand: O my people! Ye are but being seduced therewith, for lo!
your Lord is the Beneficent, so follow me and obey my order.

<span id="an_020_091">91</span> They said: We shall by no means cease to
be its votaries till Moses return unto us.

<span id="an_020_092">92</span> He (Moses) said: O Aaron! What held thee
back when thou didst see them gone astray,

<span id="an_020_093">93</span> That thou followedst me not ? Hast thou
then disobeyed my order ?

<span id="an_020_094">94</span> He said: O son of my mother! Clutch not
my beard nor my head! I feared lest thou shouldst say: Thou hast caused
division among the Children of Israel, and hast not waited for my word.

<span id="an_020_095">95</span> (Moses) said: And what hast thou to say,
O Samiri ?

<span id="an_020_096">96</span> He said: I perceived what they perceive
not, so I seized a handful from the footsteps of the messenger, and then
threw it in. Thus my soul commended to me.

<span id="an_020_097">97</span> (Moses) said: Then go! and lo! in this
life it is for thee to say: Touch me not! and lo! there is for thee a
tryst thou canst not break. Now look upon thy god of which thou hast
remained a votary. Verily we will burn it and will scatter its dust over
the sea.

<span id="an_020_098">98</span> Your God is only Allah, than Whom there
is no other God. He embraceth all things in His knowledge.

<span id="an_020_099">99</span> Thus relate We unto thee (Muhammad) some
tidings of that which happened of old, and We have given thee from Our
presence a reminder.

<span id="an_020_100">100</span> Whoso turneth away from it, he verily
will bear a burden on the Day of Resurrection,

<span id="an_020_101">101</span> Abiding under it - an evil burden for
them on the Day of Resurrection,

<span id="an_020_102">102</span> The day when the Trumpet is blown. On
that day we assemble the guilty white-eyed (with terror),

<span id="an_020_103">103</span> Murmuring among themselves: Ye have
tarried but ten (days).

<span id="an_020_104">104</span> We are Best Aware of what they utter
when their best in conduct say: Ye have tarried but a day.

<span id="an_020_105">105</span> They will ask thee of the mountains (on
that day). Say: My Lord will break them into scattered dust.

<span id="an_020_106">106</span> And leave it as an empty plain,

<span id="an_020_107">107</span> Wherein thou seest neither curve nor
ruggedness.

<span id="an_020_108">108</span> On that day they follow the summoner
who deceiveth not, and voices are hushed for the Beneficent, and thou
hearest but a faint murmur.

<span id="an_020_109">109</span> On that day no intercession availeth
save (that of) him unto whom the Beneficent hath given leave and whose
word He accepteth.

<span id="an_020_110">110</span> He knoweth (all) that is before them
and (all) that is behind them, while they cannot compass it in
knowledge.

<span id="an_020_111">111</span> And faces humble themselves before the
Living, the Eternal. And he who beareth (a burden of) wrongdoing is
indeed a failure (on that day).

<span id="an_020_112">112</span> And he who hath done some good works,
being a believer, he feareth not injustice nor begrudging (of his wage).

<span id="an_020_113">113</span> Thus we have revealed it as a Lecture
in Arabic, and have displayed therein certain threats, that peradventure
they may keep from evil or that it may cause them to take heed.

<span id="an_020_114">114</span> Then exalted be Allah, the True King!
And hasten not (O Muhammad) with the Qur'an ere its revelation hath been
perfected unto thee, and say: My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.

<span id="an_020_115">115</span> And verily We made a covenant of old
with Adam, but he forgot, and We found no constancy in him.

<span id="an_020_116">116</span> And when We said unto the angels: Fall
prostrate before Adam, they fell prostrate (all) save Iblis; he refused.

<span id="an_020_117">117</span> Therefor we said: O Adam! This is an
enemy unto thee and unto thy wife, so let him not drive you both out of
the Garden so that thou come to toil.

<span id="an_020_118">118</span> It is (vouchsafed) unto thee that thou
hungerest not therein nor art naked,

<span id="an_020_119">119</span> And that thou thirstest not therein nor
art exposed to the sun's heat.

<span id="an_020_120">120</span> But the devil whispered to him, saying:
O Adam! Shall I show thee the tree of immortality and power that wasteth
not away ?

<span id="an_020_121">121</span> Then they twain ate thereof, so that
their shame became apparent unto them, and they began to hide by heaping
on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden. And Adam disobeyed his
Lord, so went astray.

<span id="an_020_122">122</span> Then his Lord chose him, and relented
toward him, and guided him.

<span id="an_020_123">123</span> He said: Go down hence, both of you,
one of you a foe unto the other. But when there come unto you from Me a
guidance, then whoso followeth My guidance, he will not go astray nor
come to grief.

<span id="an_020_124">124</span> But he who turneth away from
remembrance of Me, his will be a narrow life, and I shall bring him
blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection.

<span id="an_020_125">125</span> He will say: My Lord! Wherefor hast
Thou gathered me (hither) blind, when I was wont to see ?

<span id="an_020_126">126</span> He will say: So (it must be). Our
revelations came unto thee but thou didst forget them. In like manner
thou art forgotten this Day.

<span id="an_020_127">127</span> Thus do We reward him who is prodigal
and believeth not the revelations of his Lord; and verily the doom of
the Hereafter will be sterner and more lasting.

<span id="an_020_128">128</span> Is it not a guidance for them (to know)
how many a generation We destroyed before them, amid whose dwellings
they walk ? Lo! therein verily are signs for men of thought.

<span id="an_020_129">129</span> And but for a decree that had already
gone forth from thy Lord, and a term already fixed, the judgment would
have been inevitable (in this world).

<span id="an_020_130">130</span> Therefor (O Muhammad), bear with what
they say, and celebrate the praise of thy Lord ere the rising of the sun
and ere the going down thereof. And glorify Him some hours of the night
and at the two ends of the day, that thou mayst find acceptance.

<span id="an_020_131">131</span> And strain not thine eyes toward that
which We cause some wedded pairs among them to enjoy, the flower of the
life of the world, that We may try them thereby. The provision of thy
Lord is better and more lasting.

<span id="an_020_132">132</span> And enjoin upon thy people worship, and
be constant therein. We ask not of thee a provision: We provided for
thee. And the sequel is for righteousness.

<span id="an_020_133">133</span> And they say: If only he would bring us
a miracle from his Lord! Hath there not come unto them the proof of what
is in the former scriptures ?

<span id="an_020_134">134</span> And if we had destroyed them with some
punishment before it, they would assuredly have said: Our Lord! If only
Thou hadst sent unto us a messenger, so that we might have followed Thy
revelations before we were (thus) humbled and disgraced!

<span id="an_020_135">135</span> Say: Each is awaiting; so await ye! Ye
will come to know who are the owners of the path of equity, and who is
right.
