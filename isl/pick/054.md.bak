# 54. al-Qamar: The Moon

<span id="an_054_001">1</span> The hour drew nigh and the moon was rent
in twain.

<span id="an_054_002">2</span> And if they behold a portent they turn
away and say: Prolonged illusion.

<span id="an_054_003">3</span> They denied (the Truth) and followed
their own lusts. Yet everything will come to a decision

<span id="an_054_004">4</span> And surely there hath come unto them news
whereof the purport should deter,

<span id="an_054_005">5</span> Effective wisdom; but warnings avail not.

<span id="an_054_006">6</span> So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) on the
day when the Summoner summoneth unto a painful thing.

<span id="an_054_007">7</span> With downcast eyes, they come forth from
the graves as they were locusts spread abroad,

<span id="an_054_008">8</span> Hastening toward the summoner; the
disbelievers say: This is a hard day.

<span id="an_054_009">9</span> The folk of Noah denied before them, yea,
they denied Our slave and said: A madman; and he was repulsed.

<span id="an_054_010">10</span> So he cried unto his Lord, saying: I am
vanquished, so give help.

<span id="an_054_011">11</span> Then opened We the gates of heaven with
pouring water

<span id="an_054_012">12</span> And caused the earth to gush forth
springs, so that the waters met for a predestined purpose.

<span id="an_054_013">13</span> And We carried him upon a thing of
planks and nails,

<span id="an_054_014">14</span> That ran (upon the waters) in Our sight,
as a reward for him who was rejected.

<span id="an_054_015">15</span> And verily We left it as a token; but is
there any that remembereth ?

<span id="an_054_016">16</span> Then see how (dreadful) was My
punishment after My warnings!

<span id="an_054_017">17</span> And in truth We have made the Qur'an
easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth ?

<span id="an_054_018">18</span> (The tribe of) A'ad rejected warnings.
Then how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings.

<span id="an_054_019">19</span> Lo! We let loose on them a raging wind
on a day of constant calamity,

<span id="an_054_020">20</span> Sweeping men away as though they were
uprooted trunks of palm-trees.

<span id="an_054_021">21</span> Then see how (dreadful) was My
punishment after My warnings!

<span id="an_054_022">22</span> And in truth We have made the Qur'an
easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth ?

<span id="an_054_023">23</span> (The tribe of) Thamud rejected warnings

<span id="an_054_024">24</span> For they said; Is it a mortal man, alone
among us, that we are to follow ? Then indeed we should fall into error
and madness.

<span id="an_054_025">25</span> Hath the remembrance been given unto him
alone among us ? Nay, but he is a rash liar.

<span id="an_054_026">26</span> (Unto their warner it was said):
To-morrow they will know who is the rash liar.

<span id="an_054_027">27</span> Lo! We are sending the she-camel as a
test for them; so watch them and have patience;

<span id="an_054_028">28</span> And inform them that the water is to be
shared between (her and) them. Every drinking will be witnessed.

<span id="an_054_029">29</span> But they call their comrade and he took
and hamstrung (her).

<span id="an_054_030">30</span> Then see how (dreadful) was My
punishment after My warnings!

<span id="an_054_031">31</span> Lo! We sent upon them one Shout, and
they became as the dry twigs (rejected by) the builder of a cattle-fold.

<span id="an_054_032">32</span> And in truth We have made the Qur'an
easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth ?

<span id="an_054_033">33</span> The folk of Lot rejected warnings.

<span id="an_054_034">34</span> Lo! We sent a storm of stones upon them
(all) save the family of Lot, whom We rescued in the last watch of the
night,

<span id="an_054_035">35</span> As grace from Us. Thus We reward him who
giveth thanks.

<span id="an_054_036">36</span> And he indeed had warned them of Our
blow, but they did doubt the warnings.

<span id="an_054_037">37</span> They even asked of him his guests for an
ill purpose. Then We blinded their eyes (and said): Taste now My
punishment after My warnings!

<span id="an_054_038">38</span> And in truth the punishment decreed
befell them early in the morning.

<span id="an_054_039">39</span> Now taste My punishment after My
warnings!

<span id="an_054_040">40</span> And in truth We have made the Qur'an
easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth ?

<span id="an_054_041">41</span> And warnings came in truth unto the
house of Pharaoh

<span id="an_054_042">42</span> Who denied Our revelations, every one.
Therefore We grasped them with the grasp of the Mighty, the Powerful.

<span id="an_054_043">43</span> Are your disbelievers better than those,
or have ye some immunity in the scriptures ?

<span id="an_054_044">44</span> Or say they: We are a host victorious ?

<span id="an_054_045">45</span> The hosts will all be routed and will
turn and flee.

<span id="an_054_046">46</span> Nay, but the Hour (of doom) is their
appointed tryst, and the Hour will be more wretched and more bitter
(than their earthly failure).

<span id="an_054_047">47</span> Lo! the guilty are in error and madness.

<span id="an_054_048">48</span> On the day when they are dragged into
the Fire upon their faces (it is said unto them): Feel the touch of
hell.

<span id="an_054_049">49</span> Lo! We have created every thing by
measure.

<span id="an_054_050">50</span> And Our commandment is but one
(commandment), as the twinkling of an eye.

<span id="an_054_051">51</span> And verily We have destroyed your
fellows; but is there any that remembereth ?

<span id="an_054_052">52</span> And every thing they did is in the
scriptures,

<span id="an_054_053">53</span> And every small and great thing is
recorded.

<span id="an_054_054">54</span> Lo! the righteous will dwell among
gardens and rivers,

<span id="an_054_055">55</span> Firmly established in the favour of a
Mighty King.
