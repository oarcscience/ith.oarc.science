# 26. ash-Shu\`ara': The Poets

<span id="an_026_001">1</span> Ta. Sin. Mim.

<span id="an_026_002">2</span> These are revelations of the Scripture
that maketh plain.

<span id="an_026_003">3</span> It may be that thou tormentest thyself (O
Muhammad) because they believe not.

<span id="an_026_004">4</span> If We will, We can send down on them from
the sky a portent so that their necks would remain bowed before it.

<span id="an_026_005">5</span> Never cometh there unto them a fresh
reminder from the Beneficent One, but they turn away from it.

<span id="an_026_006">6</span> Now they have denied (the Truth); but
there will come unto them tidings of that whereat they used to scoff.

<span id="an_026_007">7</span> Have they not seen the earth, how much of
every fruitful kind We make to grow therein ?

<span id="an_026_008">8</span> Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most
of them are not believers.

<span id="an_026_009">9</span> And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the
Mighty, the Merciful.

<span id="an_026_010">10</span> And when thy Lord called Moses, saying:
Go unto the wrongdoing folk,

<span id="an_026_011">11</span> The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward
off (evil) ?

<span id="an_026_012">12</span> He said: My Lord! Lo! I fear that they
will deny me,

<span id="an_026_013">13</span> And I shall be embarrassed, and my
tongue will not speak plainly, therefor send for Aaron (to help me).

<span id="an_026_014">14</span> And they have a crime against me, so I
fear that they will kill me.

<span id="an_026_015">15</span> He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain
with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with you, Hearing.

<span id="an_026_016">16</span> And come together unto Pharaoh and say:
Lo! we bear a message of the Lord of the Worlds,

<span id="an_026_017">17</span> (Saying): Let the Children of Israel go
with us.

<span id="an_026_018">18</span> (Pharaoh) said (unto Moses): Did we not
rear thee among us as a child ? And thou didst dwell many years of thy
life among us,

<span id="an_026_019">19</span> And thou didst that thy deed which thou
didst, and thou wast one of the ingrates.

<span id="an_026_020">20</span> He said: I did it then, when I was of
those who are astray.

<span id="an_026_021">21</span> Then I fled from you when I feared you,
and my Lord vouchsafed me a command and appointed me (of the number) of
those sent (by Him).

<span id="an_026_022">22</span> And this is the past favour wherewith
thou reproachest me: that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel.

<span id="an_026_023">23</span> Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of
the Worlds ?

<span id="an_026_024">24</span> (Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and
the earth and all that is between them, if ye had but sure belief.

<span id="an_026_025">25</span> (Pharaoh) said unto those around him:
Hear ye not ?

<span id="an_026_026">26</span> He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your
fathers.

<span id="an_026_027">27</span> (Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who
hath been sent unto you is indeed a madman!

<span id="an_026_028">28</span> He said: Lord of the East and the West
and all that is between them, if ye did but understand.

<span id="an_026_029">29</span> (Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest a god
other than me, I assuredly shall place thee among the prisoners.

<span id="an_026_030">30</span> He said: Even though I show thee
something plain ?

<span id="an_026_031">31</span> (Pharaoh) said: Produce it then, if thou
art of the truthful!

<span id="an_026_032">32</span> Then he flung down his staff and it
became a serpent manifest,

<span id="an_026_033">33</span> And he drew forth his hand and lo! it
was white to the beholders.

<span id="an_026_034">34</span> (Pharaoh) said unto the chiefs about
him: Lo! this is verily a knowing wizard,

<span id="an_026_035">35</span> Who would drive you out of your land by
his magic. Now what counsel ye ?

<span id="an_026_036">36</span> They said: Put him off, (him) and his
brother, and send into the cities summoners

<span id="an_026_037">37</span> Who shall bring unto thee every knowing
wizard.

<span id="an_026_038">38</span> So the wizards were gathered together at
a set time on a day appointed.

<span id="an_026_039">39</span> And it was said unto the people: Are ye
(also) gathering ?

<span id="an_026_040">40</span> (They said): Aye, so that we may follow
the wizards if they are the winners.

<span id="an_026_041">41</span> And when the wizards came they said unto
Pharaoh: Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners ?

<span id="an_026_042">42</span> He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be
of those brought near (to me).

<span id="an_026_043">43</span> Moses said unto them: Throw what ye are
going to throw!

<span id="an_026_044">44</span> Then they threw down their cords and
their staves and said: By Pharaoh's might, lo! we verily are the
winners.

<span id="an_026_045">45</span> Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it
swallowed that which they did falsely show.

<span id="an_026_046">46</span> And the wizards were flung prostrate,

<span id="an_026_047">47</span> Crying: We believe in the Lord of the
Worlds,

<span id="an_026_048">48</span> The Lord of Moses and Aaron.

<span id="an_026_049">49</span> (Pharaoh) said: Ye put your faith in him
before I give you leave. Lo! he doubtless is your chief who taught you
magic! But verily ye shall come to know. Verily I will cut off your
hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you every
one.

<span id="an_026_050">50</span> They said: It is no hurt, for lo! unto
our Lord we shall return.

<span id="an_026_051">51</span> Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will
forgive us our sins because we are the first of the believers.

<span id="an_026_052">52</span> And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away
My slaves by night, for ye will be pursued.

<span id="an_026_053">53</span> Then Pharaoh sent into the cities
summoners,

<span id="an_026_054">54</span> (Who said): Lo! these indeed are but a
little troop,

<span id="an_026_055">55</span> And lo! they are offenders against us.

<span id="an_026_056">56</span> And lo! we are a ready host.

<span id="an_026_057">57</span> Thus did We take them away from gardens
and watersprings,

<span id="an_026_058">58</span> And treasures and a fair estate.

<span id="an_026_059">59</span> Thus (were those things taken from them)
and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.

<span id="an_026_060">60</span> And they overtook them at sunrise.

<span id="an_026_061">61</span> And when the two hosts saw each other,
those with Moses said: Lo! we are indeed caught.

<span id="an_026_062">62</span> He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is
with me. He will guide me.

<span id="an_026_063">63</span> Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite
the sea with thy staff. And it parted, and each part was as a mountain
vast.

<span id="an_026_064">64</span> Then brought We near the others to that
place.

<span id="an_026_065">65</span> And We saved Moses and those with him,
every one;

<span id="an_026_066">66</span> And We drowned the others.

<span id="an_026_067">67</span> Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most
of them are not believers.

<span id="an_026_068">68</span> And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the
Mighty, the Merciful.

<span id="an_026_069">69</span> Recite unto them the story of Abraham:

<span id="an_026_070">70</span> When he said unto his father and his
folk: What worship ye ?

<span id="an_026_071">71</span> They said: We worship idols, and are
ever devoted unto them.

<span id="an_026_072">72</span> He said: Do they hear you when ye cry ?

<span id="an_026_073">73</span> Or do they benefit or harm you ?

<span id="an_026_074">74</span> They said: Nay, but we found our fathers
acting on this wise.

<span id="an_026_075">75</span> He said: See now that which ye worship,

<span id="an_026_076">76</span> Ye and your forefathers!

<span id="an_026_077">77</span> Lo! they are (all) an enemy unto me,
save the Lord of the Worlds,

<span id="an_026_078">78</span> Who created me, and He doth guide me,

<span id="an_026_079">79</span> And Who feedeth me and watereth me.

<span id="an_026_080">80</span> And when I sicken, then He healeth me,

<span id="an_026_081">81</span> And Who causeth me to die, then giveth
me life (again),

<span id="an_026_082">82</span> And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive
me my sin on the Day of Judgment.

<span id="an_026_083">83</span> My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite
me to the righteous.

<span id="an_026_084">84</span> And give unto me a good report in later
generations.

<span id="an_026_085">85</span> And place me among the inheritors of the
Garden of Delight,

<span id="an_026_086">86</span> And forgive my father. Lo! he is of
those who err.

<span id="an_026_087">87</span> And abase me not on the day when they
are raised,

<span id="an_026_088">88</span> The day when wealth and sons avail not
(any man)

<span id="an_026_089">89</span> Save him who bringeth unto Allah a whole
heart.

<span id="an_026_090">90</span> And the Garden will be brought nigh for
those who ward off (evil).

<span id="an_026_091">91</span> And hell will appear plainly to the
erring.

<span id="an_026_092">92</span> And it will be said unto them: Where is
(all) that ye used to worship

<span id="an_026_093">93</span> Instead of Allah ? Can they help you or
help themselves ?

<span id="an_026_094">94</span> Then will they be hurled therein, they
and the seducers

<span id="an_026_095">95</span> And the hosts of Iblis, together.

<span id="an_026_096">96</span> And they will say, when they are
quarrelling therein:

<span id="an_026_097">97</span> By Allah, of a truth we were in error
manifest

<span id="an_026_098">98</span> When we made you equal with the Lord of
the Worlds.

<span id="an_026_099">99</span> It was but the guilty who misled us.

<span id="an_026_100">100</span> Now we have no intercessors

<span id="an_026_101">101</span> Nor any loving friend.

<span id="an_026_102">102</span> Oh, that we had another turn (on
earth), that we might be of the believers!

<span id="an_026_103">103</span> Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet
most of them are not believers!

<span id="an_026_104">104</span> And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the
Mighty, the Merciful.

<span id="an_026_105">105</span> Noah's folk denied the messengers (of
Allah),

<span id="an_026_106">106</span> When their brother Noah said unto them:
Will ye not ward off (evil) ?

<span id="an_026_107">107</span> Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,

<span id="an_026_108">108</span> So keep your duty to Allah, and obey
me.

<span id="an_026_109">109</span> And I ask of you no wage therefor; my
wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.

<span id="an_026_110">110</span> So keep your duty to Allah, and obey
me.

<span id="an_026_111">111</span> They said: Shall we put faith in thee,
when the lowest (of the people) follow thee ?

<span id="an_026_112">112</span> He said: And what knowledge have I of
what they may have been doing (in the past) ?

<span id="an_026_113">113</span> Lo! their reckoning is my Lord's
concern, if ye but knew;

<span id="an_026_114">114</span> And I am not (here) to repulse
believers.

<span id="an_026_115">115</span> I am only a plain warner.

<span id="an_026_116">116</span> They said: If thou cease not, O Noah,
thou wilt surely be among those stoned (to death).

<span id="an_026_117">117</span> He said: My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny
me.

<span id="an_026_118">118</span> Therefor judge Thou between us, a
(conclusive) judgment, and save me and those believers who are with me.

<span id="an_026_119">119</span> And We saved him and those with him in
the laden ship.

<span id="an_026_120">120</span> Then afterward We drowned the others.

<span id="an_026_121">121</span> Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet
most of them are not believers.

<span id="an_026_122">122</span> And lo, thy Lord, He is indeed the
Mighty, the Merciful.

<span id="an_026_123">123</span> (The tribe of) A'ad denied the
messengers (of Allah).

<span id="an_026_124">124</span> When their brother Hud said unto them:
Will ye not ward off (evil) ?

<span id="an_026_125">125</span> Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,

<span id="an_026_126">126</span> So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.

<span id="an_026_127">127</span> And I ask of you no wage therefor; my
wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.

<span id="an_026_128">128</span> Build ye on every high place a monument
for vain delight ?

<span id="an_026_129">129</span> And seek ye out strongholds, that haply
ye may last for ever ?

<span id="an_026_130">130</span> And if ye seize by force, seize ye as
tyrants ?

<span id="an_026_131">131</span> Rather keep your duty to Allah, and
obey me.

<span id="an_026_132">132</span> Keep your duty toward Him Who hath
aided you with (the good things) that ye know,

<span id="an_026_133">133</span> Hath aided you with cattle and sons.

<span id="an_026_134">134</span> And gardens and watersprings.

<span id="an_026_135">135</span> Lo! I fear for you the retribution of
an awful day.

<span id="an_026_136">136</span> They said: It is all one to us whether
thou preachest or art not of those who preach;

<span id="an_026_137">137</span> This is but a fable of the men of old,

<span id="an_026_138">138</span> And we shall not be doomed.

<span id="an_026_139">139</span> And they denied him; therefor We
destroyed them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not
believers.

<span id="an_026_140">140</span> And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the
Mighty, the Merciful.

<span id="an_026_141">141</span> (The tribe of) Thamud denied the
messengers (of Allah)

<span id="an_026_142">142</span> When their brother Salih said unto
them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ?

<span id="an_026_143">143</span> Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,

<span id="an_026_144">144</span> So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.

<span id="an_026_145">145</span> And I ask of you no wage therefor; my
wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.

<span id="an_026_146">146</span> Will ye be left secure in that which is
here before us,

<span id="an_026_147">147</span> In gardens and watersprings.

<span id="an_026_148">148</span> And tilled fields and heavy-sheathed
palm-trees,

<span id="an_026_149">149</span> Though ye hew out dwellings in the
mountain, being skilful ?

<span id="an_026_150">150</span> Therefor keep your duty to Allah and
obey me,

<span id="an_026_151">151</span> And obey not the command of the
prodigal,

<span id="an_026_152">152</span> Who spread corruption in the earth, and
reform not.

<span id="an_026_153">153</span> They said: Thou art but one of the
bewitched;

<span id="an_026_154">154</span> Thou art but a mortal like us. So bring
some token if thou art of the truthful.

<span id="an_026_155">155</span> He said: (Behold) this she-camel. She
hath the right to drink (at the well), and ye have the right to drink,
(each) on an appointed day.

<span id="an_026_156">156</span> And touch her not with ill lest there
come on you the retribution of an awful day.

<span id="an_026_157">157</span> But they hamstrung her, and then were
penitent.

<span id="an_026_158">158</span> So the retribution came on them. Lo!
herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.

<span id="an_026_159">159</span> And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the
Mighty, the Merciful.

<span id="an_026_160">160</span> The folk of Lot denied the messengers
(of Allah),

<span id="an_026_161">161</span> When their brother Lot said unto them:
Will ye not ward off (evil) ?

<span id="an_026_162">162</span> Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,

<span id="an_026_163">163</span> So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.

<span id="an_026_164">164</span> And I ask of you no wage therefor; my
wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.

<span id="an_026_165">165</span> What! Of all creatures do ye come unto
the males,

<span id="an_026_166">166</span> And leave the wives your Lord created
for you ? Nay, but ye are froward folk.

<span id="an_026_167">167</span> They said: If thou cease not, O Lot,
thou wilt soon be of the outcast.

<span id="an_026_168">168</span> He said: I am in truth of those who
hate your conduct.

<span id="an_026_169">169</span> My Lord! Save me and my household from
what they do.

<span id="an_026_170">170</span> So We saved him and his household,
every one,

<span id="an_026_171">171</span> Save an old woman among those who
stayed behind.

<span id="an_026_172">172</span> Then afterward We destroyed the others.

<span id="an_026_173">173</span> And We rained on them a rain. And
dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned.

<span id="an_026_174">174</span> Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet
most of them are not believers.

<span id="an_026_175">175</span> And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the
Mighty, the Merciful.

<span id="an_026_176">176</span> The dwellers in the wood (of Midian)
denied the messengers (of Allah),

<span id="an_026_177">177</span> When Shu'eyb said unto them: Will ye
not ward off (evil) ?

<span id="an_026_178">178</span> Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,

<span id="an_026_179">179</span> So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.

<span id="an_026_180">180</span> And I ask of you no wage for it; my
wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.

<span id="an_026_181">181</span> Give full measure, and be not of those
who give less (than the due).

<span id="an_026_182">182</span> And weigh with the true balance.

<span id="an_026_183">183</span> Wrong not mankind in their goods, and
do not evil, making mischief, in the earth.

<span id="an_026_184">184</span> And keep your duty unto Him Who created
you and the generations of the men of old.

<span id="an_026_185">185</span> They said: Thou art but one of the
bewitched;

<span id="an_026_186">186</span> Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo!
we deem thee of the liars.

<span id="an_026_187">187</span> Then make fragments of the heaven fall
upon us, if thou art of the truthful.

<span id="an_026_188">188</span> He said: My Lord is Best Aware of what
ye do.

<span id="an_026_189">189</span> But they denied him, so there came on
them the retribution of the day of gloom. Lo! it was the retribution of
an awful day.

<span id="an_026_190">190</span> Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet
most of them are not believers.

<span id="an_026_191">191</span> And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the
Mighty, the Merciful.

<span id="an_026_192">192</span> And lo! it is a revelation of the Lord
of the Worlds,

<span id="an_026_193">193</span> Which the True Spirit hath brought down

<span id="an_026_194">194</span> Upon thy heart, that thou mayst be
(one) of the warners,

<span id="an_026_195">195</span> In plain Arabic speech.

<span id="an_026_196">196</span> And lo! it is in the Scriptures of the
men of old.

<span id="an_026_197">197</span> Is it not a token for them that the
doctors of the Children of Israel know it ?

<span id="an_026_198">198</span> And if We had revealed it unto one of
any other nation than the Arabs,

<span id="an_026_199">199</span> And he had read it unto them, they
would not have believed in it.

<span id="an_026_200">200</span> Thus do We make it traverse the hearts
of the guilty.

<span id="an_026_201">201</span> They will not believe in it till they
behold the painful doom,

<span id="an_026_202">202</span> So that it will come upon them
suddenly, when they perceive not.

<span id="an_026_203">203</span> Then they will say: Are we to be
reprieved ?

<span id="an_026_204">204</span> Would they (now) hasten on Our doom ?

<span id="an_026_205">205</span> Hast thou then seen, if We content them
for (long) years,

<span id="an_026_206">206</span> And then cometh that which they were
promised,

<span id="an_026_207">207</span> (How) that wherewith they were
contented naught availeth them ?

<span id="an_026_208">208</span> And We destroyed no township but it had
its warners

<span id="an_026_209">209</span> For reminder, for We never were
oppressors.

<span id="an_026_210">210</span> The devils did not bring it down.

<span id="an_026_211">211</span> It is not meet for them, nor is it in
their power,

<span id="an_026_212">212</span> Lo! verily they are banished from the
hearing.

<span id="an_026_213">213</span> Therefor invoke not with Allah another
god, lest thou be one of the doomed.

<span id="an_026_214">214</span> And warn thy tribe of near kindred,

<span id="an_026_215">215</span> And lower thy wing (in kindness) unto
those believers who follow thee.

<span id="an_026_216">216</span> And if they (thy kinsfolk) disobey
thee, say: Lo! I am innocent of what they do.

<span id="an_026_217">217</span> And put thy trust in the Mighty, the
Merciful.

<span id="an_026_218">218</span> Who seeth thee when thou standest up
(to pray)

<span id="an_026_219">219</span> And (seeth) thine abasement among those
who fall prostrate (in worship).

<span id="an_026_220">220</span> Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the
Knower.

<span id="an_026_221">221</span> Shall I inform you upon whom the devils
descend ?

<span id="an_026_222">222</span> They descend on every sinful, false
one.

<span id="an_026_223">223</span> They listen eagerly, but most of them
are liars.

<span id="an_026_224">224</span> As for poets, the erring follow them.

<span id="an_026_225">225</span> Hast thou not seen how they stray in
every valley,

<span id="an_026_226">226</span> And how they say that which they do not
?

<span id="an_026_227">227</span> Save those who believe and do good
works, and remember Allah much, and vindicate themselves after they have
been wronged. Those who do wrong will come to know by what a (great)
reverse they will be overturned!
