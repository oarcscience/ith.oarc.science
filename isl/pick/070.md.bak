# 70. al-Ma\`arij: The Ladders

<span id="an_070_001">1</span> A questioner questioned concerning the
doom about to fall

<span id="an_070_002">2</span> Upon the disbelievers, which none can
repel,

<span id="an_070_003">3</span> From Allah, Lord of the Ascending
Stairways

<span id="an_070_004">4</span> (Whereby) the angels and the Spirit
ascend unto Him in a Day whereof the span is fifty thousand years.

<span id="an_070_005">5</span> But be patient (O Muhammad) with a
patience fair to see.

<span id="an_070_006">6</span> Lo! they behold it afar off

<span id="an_070_007">7</span> While we behold it nigh:

<span id="an_070_008">8</span> The day when the sky will become as
molten copper,

<span id="an_070_009">9</span> And the hills become as flakes of wool,

<span id="an_070_010">10</span> And no familiar friend will ask a
question of his friend

<span id="an_070_011">11</span> Though they will be given sight of them.
The guilty man will long to be able to ransom himself from the
punishment of that day at the price of his children

<span id="an_070_012">12</span> And his spouse and his brother

<span id="an_070_013">13</span> And his kin that harboured him

<span id="an_070_014">14</span> And all that are in the earth, if then
it might deliver him.

<span id="an_070_015">15</span> But nay! for lo! it is the fire of hell

<span id="an_070_016">16</span> Eager to roast;

<span id="an_070_017">17</span> It calleth him who turned and fled (from
truth),

<span id="an_070_018">18</span> And hoarded (wealth) and withheld it.

<span id="an_070_019">19</span> Lo! man was created anxious,

<span id="an_070_020">20</span> Fretful when evil befalleth him

<span id="an_070_021">21</span> And, when good befalleth him, grudging;

<span id="an_070_022">22</span> Save worshippers.

<span id="an_070_023">23</span> Who are constant at their worship

<span id="an_070_024">24</span> And in whose wealth there is a right
acknowledged

<span id="an_070_025">25</span> For the beggar and the destitute;

<span id="an_070_026">26</span> And those who believe in the Day of
Judgment,

<span id="an_070_027">27</span> And those who are fearful of their
Lord's doom -

<span id="an_070_028">28</span> Lo! the doom of their Lord is that
before which none can feel secure -

<span id="an_070_029">29</span> And those who preserve their chastity

<span id="an_070_030">30</span> Save with their wives and those whom
their right hands possess, for thus they are not blameworthy;

<span id="an_070_031">31</span> But whoso seeketh more than that, those
are they who are transgressors;

<span id="an_070_032">32</span> And those who keep their pledges and
their covenant,

<span id="an_070_033">33</span> And those who stand by their testimony

<span id="an_070_034">34</span> And those who are attentive at their
worship.

<span id="an_070_035">35</span> These will dwell in Gardens, honoured.

<span id="an_070_036">36</span> What aileth those who disbelieve, that
they keep staring toward thee (O Muhammad), open-eyed,

<span id="an_070_037">37</span> On the right and on the left, in groups
?

<span id="an_070_038">38</span> Doth every man among them hope to enter
the Garden of Delight ?

<span id="an_070_039">39</span> Nay, verily. Lo! We created them from
what they know.

<span id="an_070_040">40</span> But nay! I swear by the Lord of the
rising-places and the setting-places of the planets that We verily are
Able

<span id="an_070_041">41</span> To replace them by (others) better than
them. And we are not to be outrun.

<span id="an_070_042">42</span> So let them chat and play until they
meet their Day which they are promised,

<span id="an_070_043">43</span> The day when they come forth from the
graves in haste, as racing to a goal,

<span id="an_070_044">44</span> With eyes aghast, abasement stupefying
them: Such is the Day which they are promised.
