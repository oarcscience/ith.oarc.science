The First Part  
In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful

When Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) got into the morning of the day of Ashurah,
he stood up and preached to his companions after the noon's prayer and
thanked Allah and praised Him and said: verily Allah, sanctified He is
and Exalted had destined you and I to be killed in this day, so be
patient and fight. Then he ranked them for the war and they were seventy
seven between knights and foot soldiers and some said they were more
than that. So he made Zohayr ben Al-Qayn on the right hand and
<u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir on the left hand and gave his banner to his
brother Al-\`Abbás (PUH) \[the brother of Al-<u>H</u>usayn but from a
different mother\] and he remained (PUH) with his Household in the
heart. They made the tents at their backs and he ordered to bring some
wood and sticks to be put behind the tents in a trench that they have
made there at some time at night and ordered to set fire to it so that
to avoid attacks from the back and it was useful for them.  
Then, \`Umar ben Sa\`d marched towards Al-<u>H</u>usayn ben \`Ali (PUT)
(with at least 30,000) and he put on the right hand \`Amr ben
Al-<u>H</u>ajjáj Al-Zobaydi, and on the left hand Shimr ben Ðil-Jawshan,
and head of the knights was \`Urwah ben Qays and the head over the foot
soldiers was Shabth ben Rab\`ee and the banner was with his slave
Dorayd, and they all came besieging the tents and saw the fire in the
trench, and then Shimr called: O <u>H</u>usayn, you hurried on to the
fire before the judgement day? Al-<u>H</u>usayn then said: who is that,
seems like it is Shimr, and they answered him yes!! He then replied: O
son of the goat shepherdess you are better for being burnt with it.  
Then Muslim ben \`Awsajah wanted to shoot an arrow at him but
Al-<u>H</u>usayn ordered him not to and said: I hate to start the
battle, and when Al-<u>H</u>usayn looked at their crowds like the raging
flood he raised his hands for praying and said:  
Allahoma \[O my Lord\] Thou art my trust in every adversity, and my hope
in every trial, and Thou art for me in every matter a trust and a
support. How many adversity weakens the core and lessens the plans and
in which the friend lets down and the enemy turns happy for it I would
rely (for it) on Thee and complained about it to Thee for my desire to
Thee among all of the others, and Thou hath made it easy for me. Thou
art the Owner of every favor and the Owner of every reward and the end
of every desire. Then he asked for his camel and he rode it and called
with a loud voice and most of them heard it, and he said: O people
listen to my speech and don't be in a hurry until I preach for you for
what is your right upon me and until I apologise for my arrival to you,
thus if you accepted my apology and believed in my speech and gave me my
rights you shall be happier with that and then you would have no reasons
against me, and if you didn't accept my apology and didn't give the
rights then gather up with your partners and don't let your matter be a
cloudy one over you and then tell me what did you decide, and my support
is Allah who revealed the book and He cares for the faithful.  
When the women heard that from him they shouted and cried out loud and
their voices raised up, so he sent to them his brother Al-\`Abbás and
his son \`Ali and said to them: make them go silent, by my life their
cries shall be more, and when they went silent, he thanked Allah and
praised Him and blessed Mo<u>h</u>ammed and his Household and said the
peace over the angels and the prophets and said so many uncountable
things, and no speaker before him or after him was heard with such
eloquence:

He who brought the eloquent speech is a reporter  
from them or otherwise he steals  
They were made equals for the book of Allah  
although it is silent and they are the book that speaks

Then he said: Thank be to Allah who created life and made it a home of
vanishing and extinction, controling its people from one situation to
another, and the proud is the one who was deceived by it and the
wretched is the one who got swayed with it, so do not be deceived by
this life because it cuts the hopes of those who take refuge in it and
disappoint the greed of those who wish for it. I see you and you've
gathered for something that Allah turned angry with you for it and
turned His glorious Face away from you and revealed His wrath upon you
and avoided you from His mercy. Thus, praised He is our God and evil is
what bondmen are you. You've swore fealty and obedience and believed in
the messanger Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH) and then you've crawled towards his
descendants and his Household desiring their killing. Verily the devil
had taken over you and made you forget to mention the name of Allah the
Great, so woe to you and to what you are asking for. We are to Allah and
we shall turn back to Him. These are people that disbelieved after their
believing and a far removal for wrongdoing folk! Then he said: and then,
retrace my ancestry and see who am I, and then turn back to yourselves
and blame yourselves and see are you allowed to kill me and violate my
own property. Am I not the son of the daughter of your own prophet and
the son of his successor and his cousin and (the son of) the first one
who believed in the messanger of Allah for what he had brought from his
God, is not <u>H</u>amzah the master of martyrs is my father's uncle? Is
not Ja\`far Al-<u>T</u>ayyár who is in paradise with two wings is my
uncle? Did you not hear what the prophet (PUH) said about me and my
brother "these are the masters of youth of paradise," so if you believed
me in what I am saying and it is the truth, by Allah then I didn't lie
for a purpose since I knew that Allah hate liars, and if you didn't
believe in me there are people among you whom if you asked shall tell
you about this matter. Ask Jábir ben \`Abdullah Al-An<u>s</u>ári and Abá
Sa\`eed Al-Khidri and Sahl ben Sa\`d Al-Sá\`idi and Zayd ben Arqam and
Anas ben Málik and Al-Borá' ben \`Ázib, they shall tell you that they
heard such speech from the prophet (PUH) about me and my brother, shall
not this avoid you from killing me? Then Shimr ben Ðil-Jawshan said to
him: he is a true worshipper who understood what you are saying, and
then <u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir replied back at him and said: by Allah I
see you worship Allah for seventy folds and I testify that you are
saying the truth, you don't know what he (Al-<u>H</u>usayn) is saying
because Allah had blackened your heart.  
Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to them: if you are in doubt about
that, do you doubt that I am the son of the daughter of your prophet? By
Allah there is no son of daughter of a prophet like me in between the
east and west and no one in others other than you. Woe to you, are you
after me for a victim that I've killed? Or a fortune of you that I've
used? Or for a revenge for some injury that I've made? But no one
answered him.  
Then he called: O Shabth ben Rab\`ee, O <u>H</u>ajjár ben Abjar, O Qays
ben Al-Ash\`ath, O Zayd ben Al-<u>H</u>árith, didn't you all write to me
that the fruit had ripened and the fields turned green, and if you come
you shall find soldiers that are made for you?  
They said: we did not! He (PUH) said then: Sanctified is Allah! Yes by
Allah you did, then he said: O people, if you hate me then let me leave
to my safe place on the lands.  
Then Qays ben Al-Ash\`ath said to him: don't you come down under the
rule of your cousin? \[meaning Yazeed\] They will show you only what you
like and never hurt you, then Al-<u>H</u>usayn said to him: you are the
brother of your own brother, do you want the hashimites to ask after
more than the blood of Muslim ben \`Aqeel, no by Allah, I shall not give
you my hand like a humble and shall not run away like a slave. O bondmen
of Allah, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest ye stone me
to death, I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every scorner who
believeth not in a Day of Reckoning. Then he kneeled down his camel and
ordered \`Uqbah ben Sam\`án to tie it:

I did not forget him when he preached to them  
while they have no words to say  
Calling am I not the son of the daughter of your prophet  
and your refuge if the life went to astray  
Did I make some innovations in the religion of the prophet  
or was I in doubt of what its laws say  
Did not the prophet advise for us by his will  
and left among you the Household and the book's way  
If you did not believe in the judgement day  
then turn back to your ancestry if you were arabs I say  
And they turned away puzzled and see nothing  
for his preach except the spears and arrows replying the say

And then the crowds started to crawl towards him. Among them there was
\`Abdullah ben <u>H</u>awzah Al-Tamimi who shouted and said: is
Al-<u>H</u>usayn among you? In the third \[seems he shouted 3 times\]
the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn replied back and said: this is
Al-<u>H</u>usayn what do you want? He said: O <u>H</u>usayn I bring you
the tidings of hell, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn said: you lied, but I shall
come forward before a forgiving and obeyed God, who are you? He said:
Ibn <u>H</u>awzah, then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) raised his hands high
until the whiteness of his armpit showed up and said: Allahoma \[O my
Lord\] take him to the hell! Then Ibn <u>H</u>awzah turned angry and
rode the horse towards him while there was a stream between them, but
his leg got hanged on the stirrup and the horse toured him in that way
until he fell down from the horse and his leg was amputated along with
his ankle and his thigh and his other half remained hanged with the
stirrup and the horse knocked his body with every tree and every stone
until he died. Masrooq ben Wá'il Al-Hadhrami said: I was at the head of
the horses that went to fight Al-<u>H</u>usayn for I was wishing for the
head of Al-<u>H</u>usayn and thus I might catch a fortune from Ibn Ziyád
\[the viceroy of Yazeed over Kufa\] and when I saw what happened to Ibn
<u>H</u>awzah I realized that the Household had a great honor and a
great place by Allah, and then I left the people and said (to myself): I
shall not fight them and become in hell!  
Then Zohayr ben Al-Qayn went out for them on a horse with his weapon and
he said: O people of Kufa, this is a warning for you against the wrath
of Allah. This is a warning that a muslim has the right of advice over
his muslim brother, and we are with you still on one religion as long as
the sword did not fall in between us, and you are deserving for the
advice and when the sword falls down, thus the bondage will be cut and
we shall be a nation and you shall be another nation. Allah had verily
tested us with the Household of His prophet Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH) to see
what we and you shall do about them. We are calling you to be victorious
to them, and to let down the tyrant Yazeed and \`Ubaydilláh ben Ziyád
for you do not realize from them except of their bad rule, to take out
your eyes and amputate your hands and legs and cut you into pieces and
raise you up over the palms and kill people like you and the best of you
who could read (Quran) like <u>H</u>ijr ben \`Adiy and his companions
and Háni ben \`Urwah and his likes!! Then they cursed him and praised
\`Ubaydilláh ben Ziyád and prayed for him and said: we shall not leave
until we kill your partner (Al-<u>H</u>usayn) and whoever was with him
or we shall send him with his companions to \`Ubaydilláh ben Ziyád in
peace!!  
Then Zohayr ben Al-Qayn said: O bondmen of Allah, the son of Fatima
deserves loyalty and to be victorious for more than the son of Somayyah
\[Yazeed\], and if you are not willing to be victorious for them then I
shall take refuge by Allah not to kill them, so leave this man and
Yazeed for by my life he (Yazeed) accepts your obedience without killing
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH).  
Then Shimr shot an arrow at him and said: shut up, my Allah shut off
your voice! You've bored us with your so much talking, then Zohayr said:
O son of him who pisses on his heels I am not talking to you, you are
but a beast! by Allah, I don't think you are able to acknowledge two
phrases from the book of Allah (Quran) so be glad with the shame on the
judgement day and the harsh punishment, then Shimr said: Allah shall
kill you with your partner (Al-<u>H</u>usayn) after some time, then
Zohayr said: are you scaring me with death? By Allah, dying with him is
more beloved to me than being eternal with you, then he went towards the
crowds and said in a loud voice: O bond men of Allah, don't let this
harsh man his likes make you astray from your religion, by Allah, a
nation that spread the blood of the Household of Mo<u>h</u>ammed and his
descendants and killed their companions and those who protect their
harem will never receive the intercession of Mo<u>h</u>ammed.  
Then a man from the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn called him and said:
Abá \`Abdilláh (Al-<u>H</u>usayn) say to you: come back, for by my life,
if the believer man of the Pharaoh's family advised his people and
prayed much, then you've advised those people. \[The believer man of the
Pharaoh's family is a story mentioned in Quran about a faithful man who
believed in Moses and was among the Pharaoh's family and maybe his
minister\]  
Then Borayr ben Khodhayr asked for a permission from Al-<u>H</u>usayn to
talk to the people and he allowed him, and he was a faithful old man and
a reader of Quran and one of the sheiks of Kufa and was a noble man
among the (tribe of) hamadanites.  
So he stopped near them and called: O people, verily Allah sent
Mo<u>h</u>ammed with good tidings and warnings and a caller for Allah by
His permission and an enlightening light, and this is the water of
Al-Forát (Euphrates) which is open to the black boars and dogs but
blocked away from the son of the propht of Allah, is that the reward of
Mo<u>h</u>ammed? They replied: O Borayr, you've talked too much so stop
it, by Allah Al-<u>H</u>usayn shall get thirsty like those who were
before him!  
He said: O people, the heaviness of Mo<u>h</u>ammed is now over your
backs, and these are his Household and descendants and his daughters and
harem, so show what do you have and what do you want to do with them?  
They said: we want to force them down to the prince \`Ubaydilláh ben
Ziyád so that he decides about them. He replied: don't you accept for
them to return back to where they came from? Woe to you! O people of
Kufa did you forget your letters and covenants that you've sent and made
Allah a witness over them? Woe to you! did you invite the Household of
your prophet and claimed that you would kill yourselves for them and
when they arrive at you, you give them to Ibn Ziyád and blocked their
way to Al-Forát? Evil is what you've done with the Household of your
prophet! What happened to you? May Allah never make you drink on the
judgement day, evil is the kind of people you are. Then some of them
said: O man, we don't understand what you are saying, and he replied:
thank be to Allah who increased in my insight among you, Allahoma \[O my
Lord\] verily I make myself clear from the deeds of those people!
Allahoma throw the arrows among them until they meet You and You angry
with them.  
Then the people started to shoot arrows at Borayr and he stepped back,
and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn rode his horse and took the Quran and put over
his head and stood in front of the crowds and shouted out loud: by Allah
do you know me? They said: yes, you are the son of the daughter of the
prophet and his grandson, then he said: by Allah, do you that my
grandfather is the prophet of Allah? They said: yes. He said: by Allah,
do you know that my father is \`Ali ben Abi-<u>T</u>álib (PUH)? They
said: yes, he said then: by Allah, do you know that my mother is Fatima
the daughter of the prophet of Allah? They said: yes, then he said: by
Allah, do you know that my grandmother is Khadeejah bent Khowaylid \[the
mother of Fatima who was a noble woman as well in Mecca\] the first
woman to become a muslim in this nation? They replied: yes, then he
said: by Allah, do you know that <u>H</u>amzah the master of martyrs is
my father's uncle? They replied: yes, then he said: by Allah, do you
know that Ja\`far Al-<u>T</u>ayyár in paradise is my uncle? They said:
yes, then he said: by Allah, do you know that this is the sword of the
prophet of Allah that I'm holding in my hand? They said: yes, then he
said: by Allah, do you know that this is the turban of the prophet of
Allah that I am wearing? They replied: yes, then he said: by Allah, do
you know that \`Ali \[his father\] was the first man in this nation to
become a muslim and the most wise of all and the greatest with patience
and he is the viceroy over every believer? They said: yes, then he said:
then why are you running to kill me? And my father is the protector, and
the banner shall be in the hands of my father in the day of judgement,
they said: we knew all of that and we shall never leave you until you
die out of thirst.  
In a narration, that he (PUH) rode over his camel and went out to the
crowds and asked them to listen by they denied to do so, until he said
to them: woe to you, why don't you listen to me and I am calling you to
the rightful path and whoever obeyed me shall be guided and whoever
disobeyed me shall be doomed and all of you will disobey my orders and
would never listen to me, and that is because your abdomens are full of
the taboo and your hearts were blackened, woe to you don't you listen,
and then the companions of \`Umar ben Sa\`d blamed each other and then
they said: listen to him.  
Then he (PUH) praised Allah and blessed Mo<u>h</u>ammed and the angels
and the prophets and extended with his eloquent speech and then he said:
woe to you O people when you called for us with urge and we came to you
in a hurry, you've raised a sword upon us that was for us and kept a
fire that we kept for our enemy and yours and thus you've became united
with your enemies against your rulers for no justice that they might
have spread among you nor for a hope that was made for you within them,
except of the taboo in this life that they will give you and a low
living that you've been greedy for, for nothing that we've done and no
opinion was offered. Did you like the woes? You left us and the swords
are raised and the self is feeling safe, and the opinion should be for
the wise, but you went in a hurry for it and came to it like the
butterflies, then woe to you O slaves of this nation and the strangers
of the parties and haters of the (holy) book and falsifiers of the
speeches, you gangs of sins and the breath of the devil and the turners
of the Sunna and killers of the children of the prophets and the
terminators of the Households of the viceroys and followers of the
adulterers in their lineage, and you who hurt the believers and the
screams of the scoffers, those who break the Quran into parts, and woe
to them for what their souls commited and in the hell they shall be
eternal. Woe to you! Do you nourish those? and let us down? Yes by
Allah, it is an old habit of you (to betray)! and your lineages have
grown with that and your descendants took it over, and your hearts grown
stable with it and your chests were blackened, thus you've become the
most evil fruit that ripened and an easy food for the aggressor, may
Allah damned the betrayers who break the covenant after the agreement
and you've made Allah a witness over you, by Allah yes you are (like
that)! The bastard, the son of the bastard \[meaning Ibn Ziyád\] had
chosen two, either to fight or to humiliate, and far it would be for us
to be humiliated, for Allah fobids this for us as well as His prophet
and the believers, and the kind ancestry (of us) and the purified laps
(who bore us) and dignified noses and the free souls, all deny this for
us and to like to follow the mean rather than die with dignity.  
Verily, I've warned you. Verily, I shall go on with this family with the
few numbers and the numbered enemies and without nourishers, and then he
said those lines of poetry for Farwah ben Mosayk Al-Morádi:

If we are defeated, we are the victorious in advance  
and if we are taken over we are not of defeats  
Verily we are not satisfied with cowardice  
but it is our deaths and the state of others  
If the death is taken away from some people  
verily then it will settle on some others  
And that vanished the trees of my people  
as it vanished as well the old centuries  
Thus if the kings were eternal we shall be too  
and if they remained alive we would have long lives  
Then say to those malevolents, stay awake  
verily the malevolents will face like we did face

Then by Allah, you shall not remain after this for long and once you
ride the horses until it (the life) shall turn around with you like the
stone handmill and turned around on you, this is a covenant that my
father made to me as well as my grandfather (the prophet) made it to
him, then gather up your partners and deicde, and don't let it a clouded
matter for you, and tell me what did you decide.  
Verily, I've depended on Allah, my God and your God, no single living
creature unless He shall take it back, verily my God is on a straight
path. Then he raised his hands and said: Allahoma, catch away from them
the drops of the heavens, and send over them some years like the years
of Joseph and make the kid of Thaqeef rule over them \[meaning
Al-Mokhtár who revenged for Al-<u>H</u>usayn\] and make them drink from
a bitter cup, who shall not leave one of them unless he would kill him
with one type (of killing) and hit him with one type (of hitting) who
shall take revenge for me and for my companions and my Household and my
followers from them, for they tricked us and lied to us and let us down,
and You are our Lord, we've depended on You, and to You shall end the
destiny.  
Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) called for \`Umar ben Sa\`d, and they called
him to the meeting and he hated to come and meet him, and then he said:
O \`Umar, you will kill me and you claim that the bastard, the son of
the bastard will give you the rule of Al-Ray and Jorján? \[areas in
Iran\] By Allah, you shall be happy with that at all, it is a covenant
that was made, do whatever you want to do, you shall not be happy in
this life or the Hereafter, as if I see your head being on a stick that
stands in Kufa and the kids shall play with it. Then, \`Umar ben Sa\`d
turned his face away with anger and then he called his companions and
said: what are you waiting for? Fight all together at once it is but
only one bite.  
When Al-<u>H</u>ur ben Yazeed Al-Riyá<u>h</u>ee \[the man who blocked
the way of Al-<u>H</u>usayn and delivered him into Karbala\] saw that
the crowds insisted on fighting A-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), he said to \`Umar
ben Sa\`d: will you fight this man? He replied: yes by Allah, a fight in
which at least the heads would fall down with the hands! He
(Al-<u>H</u>ur) said then: aren't you satisfied with what he offered? He
replied: if it was in my hands I would be (satisfied), but your prince
\[Ibn Ziyád\] denied that. Then Al-<u>H</u>ur left him and he advanced
in front of the crowds with a man from his tribe called Qorrah ben Qays,
and he said (to him): O Qorrah, did you water your horse today? He
replied: no I didn't, then he said: don't you want to water him? Qorrah
said: by Allah, I thought he wanted to stay from the battle and the
fight, and didn't want me to see that if he did, so I said to him: I
didn't water my horse and I shall go to water it, and I left that place
in which he was, and by Allah if he showed me what he desired then I
would go out with him to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH). Then Al-<u>H</u>ur
began to approach towards Al-<u>H</u>usayn a little by little, and then
Al-Mohájir ben Aws said to him: what do you want O son of Yazeed? Do you
want to fight? But he didn't answer and his body started to shake, and
Al-Mohájir then said to him: your situation is doubtful, by Allah I've
never saw you like that before and if I was asked who is the bravest
among the people of Kufa I wouldn't choose anyone but you! So what is
that that I see from you? Then Al-<u>H</u>ur: by Allah, verily I'm
giving the options for myself to choose between paradise and te hell,
and by Allah I shall not choose anything but the paradise, even if I was
to be cut into pieces and burnt.  
Then he struck his horse towards Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and put his hand
over his head and said: Allahoma to You I go, have mercy upon me for I
scared the hearts of Your viceroys and the children of Your own prophet
(PUH), and then he said to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): may I be a ransom for
you O son of the prophet of Allah, I am the one who kept you away from
turning back and marched with you all the way and made you settle in
this land, and I don't think the crowds will answer your offer and never
reach closer to you, by Allah if I knew they are planning to do this, I
wouldn't have done what I've done already, and here I am I've came to
you to repent to my Lord for what I did, and sacrficing myself for you
until I die between your hands, so do you see any forgiving for me? Then
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said: yes, Allah shall forgive you so come down,
but he replied: I am better for you on my horse rather than on my foot,
and I shall fight them over my horse for some time and then at the end I
shall come down, so then Al-<u>H</u>usayn to him: do whatever you see
may Allah have mercy upon you. Then he stepped in front of
Al-<u>H</u>usayn and said: O people of Kufa, did you invite this
faithful man and when he arrived you tried to capture him, and you
claimed that you are willing to kill yourselves to protect him and then
stepped with aggression towards him to kill him, and imprisoned him and
surrounded him from all the sides to keep him away from going on the
wide lands of Allah, so he became like the hostage between your hands
and has no power for himself and blocked his away with his women and
children and his family from the water of Al-Forát which goes on and
jews with christians and the magians drink from it as well as the black
boars and the dogs roll in it, and here are they killed by the thirst,
evil is what you've done to the Household of Mo<u>h</u>ammed after him,
may Allah never make you drink when you become thirsty. Then some men
shot arrows on him so he stepped back until he stood in front of
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and then said to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): if I was
the first one to come out to fight you, then let me be the first one to
get killed before your hands, may I be one of those who shall shake the
hands with your grandfather Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH) tomorrow in the
judgement day, so Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) gave him the permission, and he
attacked the fellows of \`Umar ben Sa\`d while saying:

Verily I am Al-<u>H</u>ur the safe place of the guest  
and I shall strike your necks with the sword  
Defending the purest who stepped on Al-Khayf \[spot in Mecca\]  
I shall strike you and see no lesser to this word

Then he fought severely until he killed around 40 men of them, and he
was attacking with Zohayr ben Al-Qayn, thus whenever one man attacks and
went deep inside them, the other would attack to rescue his partner.
Then the foot soldiers attacked Al-<u>H</u>ur and surrounded him in
great numbers until they killed him, and the companions of
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) carried his body until they put it between the
hands of Al-<u>H</u>uysan (PUH) while his soul still not released and
his blood was gushing out, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) rubbed the dust
off his face and said: Bakhen Bakhen \[expression to congratulate\] for
you O <u>H</u>ur, you are Al-<u>H</u>ur like your mother named you, you
are free in this life and the Hereafter. \[<u>H</u>ur means "the free
man" or "free" in Arabic\].  
Then \`Umar ben Sa\`d stepped towards the camp of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH)
and put an arrow in his bow and shot at the camp and said: testify for
me at the court of the prince that I am the first to shoot, and then the
crowds started to shoot and the arrows arrived from the crowds like the
rain and no single companion of Al-<u>H</u>usayn was spared, and then
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to his companions: stand up may the mercy of
Allah befall upon you, to the death that is awaiting, for these arrows
are the messages of the crowds to you.  
There was among the fellows of Ibn Sa\`d \[\`Umar\] a man called Yazeed
ben Al-Mohájir Al-Kindi and his title was Abul-Sha\`thá', and when the
crowds replied back at the offer of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) he went to
his camp and fought between his hands while saying:

I am Yazeed and my father is Al-Mohájir  
braver than a lion in his own lair  
O my Lord I am a nourisher for Al-<u>H</u>usayn  
and for Ibn Sa\`d I shall leave forever

then he sat down before Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and shot 100 arrows and 5
hit the target, and every time he shot an arrow Al-<u>H</u>usayn used to
say to him: Allahoma, make his shot in the target and let his reward be
the paradise, so he killed 5 of the fellows of \`Umar ben Sa\`d with his
arrows and he was the first to kill.  
Then the crowds battled and fought for some time and when the dust was
cleared out, they found 50 companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn dead, then
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) held his beard with his hand and said: Allah got
angry over the jews for they made up a son for Him, and got angry over
the christians for they made Him the third of three, and got angry over
the magians for worshipping the sun and the moon instead of Him, and got
angry over some people that agreed to kill the son of the daughter of
their prophet. By Allah, I shall not answer them for what they desire
until I meet Allah the Exalted painted with my blood.  
Then Yasár the slave of Ziyád showed up, and Sálim the slave of
\`Ubaydilláh ben Ziyád as well and they said: who shall combat, and then
<u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir and Borayr ben Khodhayr stood up, but
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to them: sit down, and then \`Abdulláh ben
\`Umayr Al-Kalbi stood up and took the permission from Al-<u>H</u>usayn
(PUH) to combat with them, and he was a tall man with wide shoulders,
and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) looked at him and said: verily I think he is
a killer of people of his likes, and he gave him the permission (and he
went out of Kufa at night with his wife Um-Wahab for Al-<u>H</u>usayn
(PUH) because when he saw the soldiers among the palm trees going to
fight Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), he said then: by Allah I am cautious to
fight the disbelievers and I hope that fighting those people that are
going to fight the son of the daughter of their prophet is not any less
in rewards from that fighting with the disbelievers, and he told his
wife about it and she said: you are right, go out and let me go out with
you).  
Then when he went out, Yasár faced him and said to him: who are you? So
he mentioned for him his lineage and ancestry \[a habit of Arabs in
combat to mention the ancestry of each side before fighting\], then he
said to him: I don't know you, let Zohayr ben Al-Qayn get out for me or
let <u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir or Borayr ben Khodhayr, and then Ibn
\`Umayr \[\`Abdulláh\] said: O son of the adulteress, are you afraid to
face some people in a combat? No one goes out to combat with you unless
he is better than you. Then he (\`Abdulláh) went down on him with his
sword and while he was busy with him (with Yasár), Sálim attacked him as
well and his companions shouted out loud: the slave is attacking you,
but he didn't care about it and then Sálim went down with his sword on
him but he received it with his hand and his fingers were amputated and
then Ibn \`Umayr attacked him until he killed him so got back (to the
camp) and he killed both of them while he was saying:

If you deny me then I tell you I am the son of Ibn Kalb  
the lineage of my ancestry is with He who knows the ancestry  
I am someone of bitterness and sharp (like a sword)  
and not a coward at the time of the adversity  
I am promising you O Um-Wahab  
to stab them truely and beat them as well accordingly

Then Um-Wahab his wife took a pillar and went towards him and said to
him: may my father and mother be a ransom for you, fight for the sake of
the purified, the Household of Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH), and he wanted to
get her back to the tent  but she didn't go along with him and started
to hold his clothes and said: I shall not leave you until I die with
you, and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn called her and said: may you be rewarded
from the Household of your prophet with goodness, get back to the tent
for women are not supposed to fight, and so she got back.  
Then \`Abdulláh ben \`Umayr fought bitterly until he killed another two,
and then he was killed by Háni ben Thobayt Al-<u>H</u>adhrami and Bakeer
ben <u>H</u>ay Al-Tamimi.  
Then \`Umar ben Khálid Al-<u>S</u>aydáwi stood up to fight and then
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to him: advance, we shall be after you after
some time, then he fought with his slave Sa\`d and with Jábir ben
Al-<u>H</u>árith Al-Salmáni and Majma\` ben \`Abdulláh Al-\`Á'iði and
all of them attacked the crowds of Kufa, and when they went deep inside
them, they turned around them and blocked them away from their partners,
and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) sent to them his brother Al-\`Abbás and
he saved them by his sword, and they were all injured, and on the way
back the enemy approached them so they raised their swords with all the
injuries they had and fought until they all got killed in one place.  
Then when the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) looked at how much
men they lost, men started to take permissions from Al-<u>H</u>usayn to
protect him and defend the harem in groups, while they protect each
other from the attacks of the enemy. Thus, two young men came to him and
they are: Sayf ben Al-<u>H</u>árith ben Saree\` and Málik ben \`Abdulláh
ben Saree\` and they were cousins and brothers from the mother side, and
they took the permission from him to fight before him, and
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) allowed them to, and they fought bitterly until
they got killed.  
And then the two Ghafáris \[their tribe name is Al-Ghafári\], and they
are: \`Abdulláh and \`Abdul-Ra<u>h</u>mán the sons of \`Urwah and they
said to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): peace upon you O Abá-\`Abdilláh, we've
come to fight before you and defend you, and he said: welcome, and then
he asked them to get closer to him, and so they did while they were
crying, and he said: what makes you cry O children of my brother? By
Allah, I hope you shall be satisfied and happy after some time from now,
and they said: may Allah make us a ransom for you, we are not crying for
ourselves but we are crying for you, we see you surrounded by enemies
and we cannot help you, so he said then: may Allah reward you O children
of my brother for your sacrifice with goodness as best as it can be,
then they stepped forward and said: peace upon you O son of the prophet
of Allah, and then he said: and peace upon you (two) and the mercy of
Allah and His blessings, and then they fought close by until they got
killed.  
Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) shouted out loud: aren't there any helper
that would help us for the sake of Allah, aren't there any defender that
would defend the house of the prophet of Allah, and the women and
children heard him and started to scream out loud.  
Then, Sa\`d ben Al-<u>H</u>árth Al-An<u>s</u>ári Al-\`Ajaláni and his
brother Abul-<u>H</u>otoof heard the call of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and
the screams of his children and they were with \`Umar ben Sa\`d, so they
raised their swords with Al-<u>H</u>usayn against his enemies and
started to fight until they killed some men and injured some others
until they got killed together.  
Then, the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn when they became less in number
and their shortage of men began to show up, man after another started to
show up and fight, and they killed so many of the kufans.  
Then, \`Amr ben Al-<u>H</u>ajjáj shouted at his companions and said: do
you know who are you fighting? you are fighting the knights of the land
and the people of the insight and people that don't care about death! No
one would go out to fight with them unless he got killed although they
are just a few, by Allah if you don't stone them you won't kill them.  
Then, \`Umar ben Sa\`d said: the truth you've said! The opinion is what
you've said, so send the orders to the crowd not a single a man shall
fight with them for if you go on in singles for sure they will terminate
you.  
Then, \`Amr ben Al-<u>H</u>ajjáj attacked the right wing of
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) but they were stable against him and they kneeled
down and raised the spears so the horses couldn't advance, and when the
horses went to get back, the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn shot the
arrows at them, so they killed some of them and injured some others.
Then \`Amr ben Al-<u>H</u>ajjáj attacked from the direction of Al-Forát
and they fought for some time, and there where Muslim ben \`Awsajah
Al-Asdi fought, and attacked them Muslim ben \`Abdilláh Al-Dhabábi and
\`Abdulláh Al-Bajali, and the heavy dust turned into the air from the
fierce battle, and when it was cleared out they found Muslim ben
\`Awsajah on the ground with some life in him. So, Al-<u>H</u>usayn
walked to him with <u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir Al-Asdi, and
Al-<u>H</u>usayn said to him: may Allah have mercy upon you O Muslim!
Some of them have paid their vow by death (in battle), and some of them
still are waiting; and they have not altered in the least, and then
<u>H</u>abeeb got closer to him and said: your death is hard for me! O
Muslim be glad in paradise! Then Muslim said in a faint voice: may Allah
bring the good tidings to you. Then <u>H</u>abeeb said to him: if I
wasn't sure that I will be after you in few moments, I would like to ask
you to recommend for me whatever you like, then Muslim replied: verily,
I recommend this for you, and he pointed to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) so
fight before him until you die. Then <u>H</u>abeeb said to him: verily I
shall make you glad! Then he died may Allah be pleased with him.

They nourished you alive and also when they were dead  
each partner recommend for the other to nourish you  
Ibn \`Awsajah recommended to <u>H</u>abeeb and said  
fight before him until the fierce death comes after you

Then a maid for him (\`Awsajah) shouted: Alas! my master! Alas! Ibn
\`Awsajah! Then the companions of Ibn Sa\`d shouted in happiness: we've
killed Muslim ben \`Awsajah, and then Shabth ben Rab\`ee said: may your
mothers bereave you, verily you are killing yourselves by your own hands
and humiliate yourselves for the others, are you glad that you killed
Muslim ben \`Awsajah? By the One that I've been muslim for, how many
good deeds he had among the muslims, and I saw him at the day of
Azerbaijan killing 6 disbelievers before the horses of the muslims are
cured.  
Then, Shimr ben Ðil-Jawshan attacked with his companions on the
companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), and Zohayr ben Al-Qayn attacked
them back with 10 men from the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) so
they made them stay away from the tents and they killed Abá \`Aðrah
Al-Dhabábi, one of the companions of Shimr, and then Shimr turned around
on them so they killed some of them and the rest turned back to their
positions, and Abu-Thomámah Al-<u>S</u>á'idi \[or Al-<u>S</u>aydáwi\]
killed one of his cousins who was an enemy of his.  
Then, the time of the noon's prayer arrived, and Abu-Thomámah
Al-<u>S</u>aydáwi said to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): O Abá \`Abdilláh,
myself for yourself to be a ransom, these got closer to you and by Allah
you shall not be killed until I die before you and I like to meet Allah
after praying this prayer. Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) raised his head
into the sky and said: you've remembered the prayer time may Allah make
you one of the prayers and the sanctifiers, yes this is the beginning of
its time, and then he said: ask them to stop so that we can pray, and so
they did. Then Al-<u>H</u>o<u>s</u>ayn ben Tameem said to them: it shall
not be accepted \[meaning the prayer shall not be accepted before
Allah\].  
Then <u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir said to him: you've claimed that the
prayer is not accepted from the Household of the prophet (PUH) and their
nourishers and shall be accepted from you O jackass? Then
Al-<u>H</u>o<u>s</u>ayn attacked him and <u>H</u>abeeb attacked as well
and he struck the face of his horse with the sword and
Al-<u>H</u>o<u>s</u>ayn fell down, and shouted for help from his
companions and so they did and they attacked <u>H</u>abeeb and he killed
one man of them.  
Then, Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to Zohayr ben Al-Qayn and Sa\`eed ben
\`Abilláh Al-<u>H</u>anafi: stand in front of me to let me pray the
noon's prayer, and so they did with half of the companions until he
prayed the prayer of Fear, then one arrow reached Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH)
and Sa\`eed ben \`Abdilláh stood to protect him against the arrows by
his body and he remained like that while arrows kept on coming to him
until he fell down on the ground and said: Allahoma, damn them like the
damnations of \`Ád and Thamood, Allahoma, tell Your prophet the peace
from me and tell him what I saw of painful injuries, for verily I wanted
Your reward for protecting the Household of Mo<u>h</u>ammed (and in some
other narrations he said: Allahoma, nothing of what You desire is
impossible for You, so tell Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH) how I nourished and
protected Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and make me be with him in the
eternity). Then he died, may Allah be pleased with him, and they found
out 13 arrows planted in his body, adding to that the strikes of swords
and spears. Then, Sowayd ben \`Amr ben Abi-Mo<u>t</u>á\` advanced and he
was a noble and a faithful man of many prayers, and he said:

Defend Al-<u>H</u>usayn today and you shall meet Mo<u>h</u>ammed  
and your lord \`Ali, the man of the virtues  
And <u>H</u>asan like the moon in its full shape  
and your uncle the eager for flesh and the pious  
<u>H</u>amzah the lion of Allah verily called the lion  
and the one with the one of two wings got place so glorious  
in the paradise going there in the high places  
\[one of two wings is Jafar the uncle of Al-<u>H</u>usayn\]

So he fought like the brave lion and had the great patience over the
adversities until he fell down with the dead with so many injuries, and
he remained like that without any movement until he heard them later on
saying that Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) got killed so he carried himself
hardly and got a knife out of his sandal and fought until he got killed,
may Allah be pleased with him.  
Then, Zohayr ben Al-Qayn got out saying:

Verily I am Zohayr and I am the son of Al-Qayn  
I shall fight you with the sword to defend Al-<u>H</u>usayn  
Verily Al-<u>H</u>usayn is one of the Grandsons \[of the prophet\]  
from the Household of the virtuous and the most fine  
Verily that is the prophet of Allah  
and I shall strike you and see no harm within  
O how I wish my soul would be splitting

Then he fought fiercly until he killed as some narrations go, 120 men,
and then he was attacked by \`Abdulláh Al-Tamimi and Mohájir ben Aws
Al-Tamimi and they killed him. Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said when
Zohayr got killed: may Allah not make you far away O Zohayr and may He
damn your killer like He damned those who mutated into monkeys and
boars.  
Then, \`Ábis ben Shabeeb Al-Shákiri came with Shawðab, the slave of Bani
Shákir, and he said: O Shawðab what do you have in mind to do? He
replied: what to do? I shall fight with you defending the son of the
daughter of the prophet of Allah (PUH) until I get killed. He replied:
this is my thought about you, so step before Abá \`Abdilláh to recognize
you like he did with the others, and to recognize you me myself for this
is a day that we should ask for the rewards in by everything we can do,
for there are no deeds after that, it is but the judgement after that.
Then Shawðab stepped forward and said: peace upon you O Abá \`Abdilláh
and the may the mercy of Allah befall upon you and His blessings, I
shall leave you with Allah. Then he fought until he got killed.  
Then \`Ábis stepped forward and said: O Abá \`Abdilláh verily by Allah
there is no one on the face of earth from far away or near by that can
be more dear to myself than you, and if I could defend you against the
unjust and being killed by something dearer than my soul and blood I
would have done that, peace upon you O Abá \`Abdilláh, and I make Allah
a testifier for that I am on your path and the path of your father, then
he went with his sword towards them directly and he had a mark on his
forehead. Rabee\` ben Tameem Al-<u>H</u>arithi said: when I saw him
coming I knew him and I saw him many times in wars and he was one of the
bravest people so I said (to the crowds): O people this is the lion of
the lions the son of Shabeeb, the mighty, no one shall go out to combat
with him, stone him, and so they did, and then \`Ábis called: one man
for one man, but the people avoided him for his bravery, and Ibn Sa\`d
\[\`Umar\] then said: stone him severly, and they stoned him from all
the sides, and when he saw that he dropped down his shield and his
helmet and attacked the crowds and defeated them. The narrator said: by
Allah, I saw him knocking out more than 200 from the crowds, and then
they surrounded him from all sides and they killed him, then I saw his
head at the hands of some men with their weapons, each of them say that
he killed him, then Ibn Sa\`d said: don't fight now, this man is not
killed by one single man, so he resolved that issue among them.  
Then <u>H</u>abeeb ben Mozháhir Al-Asdi showed up and said:

I am <u>H</u>abeeb and my father is Mozháhir  
a knight of the wars and the fire that burns  
Verily you are great in numbers  
but we have the higher hands  
And you betray at the time of loyalty  
and we are more loyal than you and have the patience  
Verily, we are more faithful than you all and better

Then, he fought bitterly and he killed a man from (the tribe of) Bani
Tameem that was called Bodayl ben <u>S</u>oraym, and another man from
Tameem attacked him and stabbed him, so he wanted to get up, then he
received a strike from Al-<u>H</u>o<u>s</u>ayn ben Tameem on his head
with the sword and he fell down, and then the man of Tameem came down to
him and beheaded him, and his death shocked Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and
he said: by Allah I shall recognize myself and the protectors of my
companions. Then Al-<u>H</u>o<u>s</u>ayn said to the man of Tameem: I am
your partner in killing him (<u>H</u>abeeb), the man replied: no by
Allah (you're not). He said: give me the head to hang it on the neck of
my horse to let the people see that I'm your partner in killing him and
then take it back for I don't have any benefit from whatever Ibn Ziyád
would give you. So, he gave him the head and he toured among the people
with it and then returned it back to him and when he returned to Kufa he
hanged it on the neck of his horse.  
Then a turkish slave for Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) that was called Aslam,
and he was a Quran reader, he went out to fight while saying:

The sea is burning from my stabbing and hitting  
and the air is full of my arrows and darts  
When my sword is in my right hand raising up  
The heart of the envious noble shall be torn in parts

Then he killed 70 men and fell down on the ground, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn
(PUH) then came to him and cried and then put his cheek on his cheek,
and then Aslam opened his eyes and saw Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), then he
smiled and his soul got out of his body.  
Then, Borayr ben Khodhayr Al-Hamadáni got out and he was a faithful man
and considered the best reader of Quran at his time and he was called
"the master of readers" and he said:

I am Borayr and my father is Khodhayr  
verily there is no blessings for him who has no goodness

Then he started to attack the crowds while saying: get closer to me you
O killers of the believers, get closer to me O killers of the sons of
those who were in Badr, get closer to me you O killers of the prophet's
sons and his Household. Then, Yazeed ben Ma\`qal got out for him and
said: O Borayr how do you see what Allah has done with you? He replied:
verily He made the goodness with me and the evil with you, then Yazeed
said: you lied, and you were not a liar before this day, do you remember
when I was walking with you among Bani Lawáðin and you were saying:
\`Uthmán was a squanderer over himself and Mo\`áwiyah is astraying and
made people astray, and the true leader of the guidance is \`Ali ben Abi
<u>T</u>álib, then Borayr said: I testify that this is my saying and
this is my opinion, and then Yazeed said: I testify that you are an
astraying man. Then Borayr said: come on and let's pray humbly and
invoke the curse of Allah over the liar (between us), and so they did
and then they made a combat and struck each other two times, thus Yazeed
hit Borayr lightly and did not harm him but Borayr struck him hardly on
his helmet and made the sword go through until it reached his brain, so
he fell down and the sword remained in his head. Then Radhi ben Monqið
Al-\`Abdi attacked Borayr and hugged him and fought for some time, and
then Borayr threw him to the ground and sat on his chest, and Ka\`b ben
Jábir Al-Azdi stabbed him on his back with his spear, so Borayr got down
from Ibn Monqið after biting his nose and cutting it, and then \`Afeef
ben Zohayr ben Abi Al-Akhnas shouted at him (at Ka\`b): this is Borayr
ben Khodhayr the reader, the one who was reading Quran to us in Kufa
mosque, but he (Ka\`b) didn't look at him and struck him with the sword
until he killed him, may Allah be pleased with him.  
And when Ka\`b ben Jábir returned back from the battle later on, his
wife said to him: you've helped against the son of Fatima and killed
Borayr the master of the readersm verily I shall never talk to you
again, and then he said:

\[here comes a long poem describing how he is proud in fighting
Al-<u>H</u>usayn\]

And then, Wahab ben <u>H</u>abbáb Al-Kalbi raised and he was a
christian, but turned into Islam by the hands of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH)
and he was with his mother and his wife, and his mother said: raise up O
son and nourish the son of the daughter of the prophet of Allah (PUH),
and he said: I shall do mother and not any less, so he raised up and
said:

If you deny me then I am the son of Al-Kalbi  
you shall see me and see my beating  
And my attacks and fight in the war  
after the revenge of my partners my revenge I shall be chasing  
I shall push away the adversity in the face of the adversity  
and my fighting in the war is verily not playing

Then he attacked until he killed some of them and got back to his wife
and his mother, and he said: O mother, are you satisfied yet? She
replied: I'm not satisfied unless you are killed defending
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), and his wife said: by Allah, don't frighten me
with yourself, and his mother said: O son, neglect her saying and get
back to fight before the son of the daughter of your prophet, and you
shall receive the intercession of his grandfather at the day of the
judgement. He got back and fought until his both hands were amputated!!
Then his wife took a pillar and ran towards him and said: may my father
and my mother be ransoms for you, defend the kind people the Household
of the prophet of Allah (PUH), and he said to her: you were advising me
to stop fighting and now you're here to fight with me, and then she
said: O Wahab, don't blame me, verily the cries of Al-<u>H</u>usayn have
broken my heart. He asked: what did you hear him say? She said: O Wahab
I saw him sitting at the enterance of the tent while he was crying and
saying: Alas! No nourisher!! Then Wahab cried a lot and said to her: get
back to the women may Allah have mercy upon you, but she denied and then
Wahab shouted: my lord Abá \`Abdilláh, let her get back to the tent, and
so the imam did.  
Then the people gathered around him and killed him, and his mother
walked to him, and some say it was his wife, and sat down beside him
rubbing the blood off his body and say: congratulations for you got the
paradise, and I ask Allah who gave you the paradise to let me go with
you.  
Then Shimr said to his slave Rostom, hit her head, and so he did, and
she died in her place and she was the first woman to die from the
companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn.  
Then \`Amr ben Qorzhah Al-An<u>s</u>ári raised up and took the
permission from Al-<u>H</u>usayn and he allowed him to go, so he went
and said:

Verily the phalanx of Al-An<u>s</u>ári knew  
that I shall protect the boundaries of honor  
Strikes of a kid that doesn't run away  
and for Al-<u>H</u>usayn shall be my life and home

So then he fought like someone waiting for the reward until he killed so
many of them, and no single arrow would arrive at Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH)
that he wouldn't receive with his hand, or a sword that he wouldn't
receive with his heart and so no harm reached Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH)
until he was thickened with injuries and then he looked at
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and said: O son of the prophet of Allah, did I
fullfil? He replied: yes, you are in front of me in paradise, so tell
the prophet of Allah (PUH) my greetings and tell him that I will be
there soon too. Then he fought until he got killed, may Allah be pleased
with him. He had a brother who was with \`Umar ben Sa\`d who said to
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): you've tricked my brother until you killed him?
Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to him: Allah did not trick your
brother but verily He guided him and made you astray, and he said: may
Allah kill me if I didn't kill you or I shall die, so he attacked but
his way was blocked by Náfi\` ben Hilál who stabbed him and got him
down, and then companions saved him.  
Then a young man whose father got killed in the battle raised up and his
mother was with him, and she said to him: get out O son and fight before
the son of the prophet of Allah (PUH), and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH)
said: this is a young man whose father got killed in the battle maybe
his mother hates to see him out there, then the young man said: my
mother is the one who ordered me to go out! So he got out and said:

my prince is <u>H</u>usayn and what a prince is he  
the gladness of the heart of the omen and warner  
\`Ali and Fatima are his parents  
do you know anyone to him like similar  
He has a face like the sun of the noon  
and he has a beard like the bright moon

And then he fought until he got killed and got beheaded and his head was
thrown towards the camp of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), so his mother then
carried his head and said: good deed you've done my son, O the gladness
of my heart and the gladness of my eyes. Then she threw the head of her
son towards a man and she got him killed, and she took the pillar of the
tent and attacked them while saying:

I am an old woman for my lord and weak  
empty and thin I am and unable  
I shall strike you bitterly  
defending the sons of Fatima the honorable

And she struck two men and killed them, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn  ordered to
get her back and he prayed for her.  
Then \`Amr ben Khálid Al-<u>S</u>aydáwi raised up and said to
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH): O Abá \`Abdilláh, verily I am now to follow my
partners and I hated to leave and see you alone and dead, so
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to him: advance, verily we shall follow you
in some time. So he advanced and fought until he got killed.  
Then, <u>H</u>anzhalah ben As\`ad Al-Shibámi came before
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) to protect him against the arrows and the spears
and the swords by his face and his neck. Then he called and said: O
people, I am afraid for you a day like the day of the parties \[day of
parties a name of a battle that was between muslims and disbelievers\],
like the deeds of the people of Noah and \`Ád and Thamood and those who
came after them, and verily Allah doesn't wrong the bondmen. And, O
people, I fear for you a Day of Summoning, when you run away and have
nothing to protect you against Allah, O people don't kill
Al-<u>H</u>usayn for verily Allah will destroy you by His punishment,
and he shall be disappointed whoever spread the lies. Then
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to him: O son of As\`ad may Allah have mercy
upon you, verily they deserved the punishment when they answered your
calls previously and raised up to curse you with your companions, how is
it now and they killed your faithful companions. He replied: you are
right, may I be a ransom for you, shouldn't we go to our Lord and follow
our brothers? He (Al-<u>H</u>usayn) said: for sure, go to something
better from this life and what is in it and to an eternal fortune. He
then said: peace upon you O son of the prophet of Allah (PUH) and upon
your Household and may we be together in heaven, and then
Al-<u>H</u>usayn replied: Amen, Amen. So he went out to the crowds and
fought bitterly until he got killed.  
Then Náfi\` ben Hilál Al-Jamli raised up and fought fiercely and he was
shooting the crowds with poisoned arrows and his name was written on
them and he was saying:

I shall throw it and their tops are marked  
and the soul shall see no benefit from its fearing  
Poisoned that goes within its heart  
to fill the land from its spreading

And he kept on shooting at them until he had no more, and then he held
his sword and took it out and said:

I am the kid of Al-Jamali from Yemen  
verily the creed of <u>H</u>usayn and \`Ali is my creed  
If I got killed this day, this is my hope  
and this is what I see and shall meet my deed

So they broke his two arms and he was taken a prisoner, and Shimr took
him to Ibn Sa\`d, and Ibn Sa\`d said to him: woe to you!  O Náfi\` what
made you do that with yourself? He replied: my Lord knows better what I
wanted, and the blood was going down on his beard and his face and then
he said: I've killed 12 men from you adding to that those I've injured
and if I had an arm left you wouldn't be able to capture me, then Shimr
took his sword out to kill him and Náfi\` said to him: by Allah if you
were a muslim it would be so horriblefor you to meet Allah with our
blood, so praise be to Allah that He made our deaths by the most
devilish creatures of His creations, and then Shimr killed him.  
Then, Jawn \[not John\] the slave of Abá Ðar Al-Ghifári raised up and he
was a black slave, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to him: you have my
permission to stay away, you've followed us for goodness so don't be
troubled in our own way, so he said: O son of the prophet of Allah (PUH)
I lick your dishes in the good times, and in adversity I shall let you
down? Then by Allah my smell shall be disgusting! and my ancestry shall
be the most devilish! And verily my color shall be black! So, breath on
me from the paradise, thus my smell would be the nicest and my ancestry
shall be the best! And my face shall be the whitest! No by Allah, I
shall never leave you until this black blood get mixed with your own
bloods, and then he raised up and said:

How do the disbelievers see the beats of the black  
by the sword I beat defending the Household of Mo<u>h</u>ammed  
I shall protect them by the tongue and by the hand  
and seek the paradise later at the day of judgement

Then he battled until he got killed, and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH)
stood up and said: Allahoma, make his face white! And turn his smell
into good! and make him with the faithful, and make him meet the
Household of Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH).  
Then one man after the other from the companions of Al-<u>H</u>usayn
(PUH) used to come to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and say: peace upon you O
son of the prophet of Allah, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) would say: and
peace upon you and we shall be behind you, and then say: Some of them
have paid their vow by death (in battle), and some of them still are
waiting. So, until all of them were killed and only Al-<u>H</u>usayn was
left with his family only and they are the children of \`Ali (PUH) and
the sons of Ja\`far (PUH) \[the brother of imam \`Ali\], and the sons of
\`Aqeel (PUH) \[the brother of imam \`Ali\], and the sons of imam
Al-<u>H</u>asan (PUH) \[the brother of imam Al-<u>H</u>usayn\], and the
sons of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), so they gathered together to pay
farewell for each other, and decided to fight, and they were 17 men and
some say there were more.  
Then \`Ali ben Al-<u>H</u>usayn Al-Akbar (PUH) raised up, and his mother
was Laylá bent Abi-Morrah ben \`Urwah ben Mas\`ood, and her mother was
Maymoonah bent Abi Sufyán ben <u>H</u>arb, and he was one with a bright
face and people never see like him, and had the nicest manners and his
age was 18 and some say it was 25, and he was married and was a target
for poets, and some said about him

The eye never saw someone like him  
who walks with bare foot and with sandals  
I mean the son of Laylá the noble  
I mean the son of the daughter of the great lineages  
This life is nothing for his faithfulness  
and never give the truth in change of the false

Then he asked for his father's permission to fight, and he gave him the
permission and then looked at him a look of someone despaired of him,
and then he closed his eyes and cried, and then raised his index finger
to the sky and said: Allahoma, testify over them that they are fighting
a young man who is the most like of the prophet in shape and manners and
in speech, and whenever we liked to see Your prophet we would look at
him. Allahoma, forbid them the blesses of the earth and separate them
into bands and tear them severely, and make them torn into groups and
never make the viceroys satisfied with them, for they called us to
nourish us and then they've been aggressive towards us to fight us.  
Then he shouted: O Ibn Sa\`d, may Allah cut off your lineage and may He
never bless you in your matters and may He appoint someone to kill you
after me while you're on your bed, like the way you cut off my lineage
and did not save my closeness from the prophet of Allah (PUH).  
Then he raised his voice and said: Lo! Allah preferred Adam and Noah and
the Family of Abraham and the Family of 'Imran above (all His)
creatures. They were descendants one of another. Allah is Hearer,
Knower.  
Then \`Ali attacked the crowds and he was saying:

I am \`Ali ben Al-<u>H</u>usayn ben \`Ali  
we and the House of Allah are better for the prophet  
by Allah the son of the bastard shall not rule us  
and I shall strike with the sword defending my father  
like the strikes of a hashimite, an \`Alawite

Then he attacked them and then returned back to his father and said: O
father, the thirst killed me and the heaviness of the iron made me
exhausted, any way for a sip of water? Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) cried
and said: Alas! any help! O son, from where should I get the water?
Fight a little for you will see your grandfather Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH)
in a while, and he shall make you drink from his abundant cup such a
drink that you will never become thirsty at all. Then he started to
fight one time after the other and the kufans were avoiding killing him,
and then Morrah ben Monqið Al-\`Abdi looked him and said: may the
burdens of Arabs be over my back if he did what he is doing and passed
me by and I wouldn't bereave his mother! Then he passed by attacking the
crowds like he used to do and Morrah ben Monqið blocked his way and hit
him and some say he stabbed him with a spear and killed him, and then he
called: O father peace upon you, this is my grandfather saying peace
upon you and asking you to come in a hurry (to us), and then the people
surrounded him and cut him with their swords, and then Al-<u>H</u>usayn
(PUH) came until he stood over his body and said: may Allah kill the
people who killed you O son, how dare are they against the Merciful and
for attacking the Household of the prophet; verily life after you is
nothing. Then Zaynab bent \`Ali (PUH) \[the sister of Al-<u>H</u>usayn\]
went out calling: Alas! my beloved! Alas! the son of my brother! She
came and dropped herself down over him, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) came
to her and took her hand and turned her back to the tent, and then
called his sons and asked them to carry their brother from his place of
death, until they put him in front of the tent that they were fighting
in front of it.  
Then, \`Abdullah ben Muslim ben \`Aqeel ben Abi <u>T</u>álib, and his
mother was Roqayyah bent \`Ali ben Abi <u>T</u>álib, he raised up and
said:

Today I shall meet Muslim and he is my father  
and some men that were killed before the prophet's religion  
They are not some people that were some liars  
but the best of people and the best of lineage  
from Háshim the masters and people of the ancestry

So he killed some people in 3 campaigns, and then Zayd ben Warqá' shot
an arrow at him and he received with his hand, and it got hanged to his
forehead and he couldn't remove it from his forehead, and then he said:
Allahoma, they let us down and humiliated us, so kill them like they
killed us, and then he shot another arrow at him, and another man
stabbed him with his spear in the heart, and so he died peace upon
him.  
Then Mo<u>h</u>ammed ben Muslim ben \`Aqeel (PUH) raised up and fought
until he got killed. He was killed by Abu-Jorhom Al-Azdi and
Laqee<u>t</u> ben Yásir Al-Johani.  
Then Mo<u>h</u>ammed ben Abi-Sa\`eed ben \`Aqeel (PUH) raised and fought
until he got killed. He was killed by Laqee<u>t</u> ben Yásir Al-Johani
by an arrow.  
Then Ja\`far ben \`Aqeel (PUH) raised while saying:

I am the man from <u>T</u>álib  
from people of Háshim and Ghálib  
We are truely the masters of honor  
and this is Al-<u>H</u>usayn the best of the best  
From the Household of the faithful and the victorious

So he killed 15 knights and two men, and then he got killed by
\`Abdulláh ben \`Urwah Al-Khath\`imi.  
Then \`Abdul-Ra<u>h</u>mán ben \`Aqeel (PUH) raised while saying:

My father is \`Aqeel so know my place  
in Háshim and Háshim are my brothers  
Old men of truth and the masters of their likes  
This is Al-<u>H</u>usayn like the greatest structures  
And the master of the old men with the youth

So he killed 17 knights, and then \`Uthmán ben Khálid Al-Johani with
Bishr ben Saw<u>t</u> attacked him and killed him.  
Then \`Abdullah Al-Akbar ben \`Aqeel (PUH) raised up and fought fiercely
and then got killed by \`Uthmán ben Khálid Al-Johani with Bishr ben
Saw<u>t</u>.  
Then Mo<u>h</u>ammed ben \`Abdulláh ben Ja\`far ben Abi <u>T</u>álib
(PUH) and his mother was Al-Khaw<u>s</u>á' who was from the tribe of
Tayyim Al-Lát ben Tha\`labah, he raised up and said:

Verily I complain to Allah from the aggression  
(I am) the killer of people that are blind in the war  
They departed the meanings of the Quran  
and the revealed laws and teachings  
And showed the disbelieving and the agression

Then he fought until he killed 10 of them, then he was attacked by
\`Ámir ben Nahshal Al-Tamimi and got killed.  
Then his brother \`Awn ben \`Abdulláh ben Ja\`far (PUH) and his mother
was Zaynab the daughter of the prince of the believers (PUH) raised up
and said:

If you deny me verily I am the son of Ja\`far  
the martyr of the truth and in paradise he blossoms  
He shall fly in it with a green wing  
this is enough for pride at the day of judgement

Then he fought until he killed 3 knights and 18 men, and then was
attacked by \`Abdulláh ben Qo<u>t</u>bah and got killed.  
Then Al-Qásim ben Al-<u>H</u>asan ben \`Ali ben Abi <u>T</u>álib (PUT)
raised up, and he was a young kid, and when Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) saw
him raising up to fight, he hugged him and both of them cried until then
fell into coma. Then he asked his uncle for a permission to fight, but
he denied to do so, and the kid kept kissing his hands and his feet
until he decided to give a permission for him, so he went out and his
tears upon his cheeks and said:

If you deny me then I am the son of Al-<u>H</u>asan  
the grandson of the prophet the chosen and the entrusted  
This is <u>H</u>usayn like the prisoner who kept as a hostage  
among people that shall not be watered by the clouds

And he fought bitterly, and he killed despite his young age 35 men.
<u>H</u>ameed ben Muslim said: a kid went out towards us and his face
was like the moon, and there was a sword in his hand, and wearing a
shirt and a cloth on his loin and sandals in his feet, and the tie of
one of his sandals was cut and I don't forget that it was the left, and
then \`Amr ben Sa\`d ben Nofayl Al-Azdi said to me: the burdens of Arabs
shall be on my back if I didn't bereave his uncle Al-<u>H</u>usayn when
he passes me by doing this, and I said: sanctified is Allah, and what do
you want by that? by Allah if he beat me I shall not raise my hand
towards him! Leave him alone, those who surround him are enough, and he
replied: by Allah I shall attack him. Then he attacked him and hit his
head with the sword and killed him, and the kid fell down to the ground
on over his face and shouted: O uncle! And Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) showed
up like the hawk and attacked like the angry lion and hit \`Amr ben
Sa\`d ben Nofayl with the sword and he received it with his elbow and it
was amputated and screamed out loud that all the camp heard him, and
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) turned away from him and the kufans came to
rescue him but the horses stepped over \`Amr with their hooves until he
died, and the dust cleared out and there was Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH)
standing over the head of the kid while he was striking with his legs
while Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) was saying: Far be they those people who
killed you, and those whose their opponent about you is your grandfather
and your father.  Then he (PUH) said: it is hard for your uncle not to
call him and he wouldn't respond or respond and no voice would help you,
by Allah there are many of his killers and so few are his nourishers.
Then he took him and put his chest over his chest and like I can see the
legs of the kid touching the ground, and he took him until he put him
down with his son \`Ali Al-Akbar and the rest of the dead from his own
family. Then he said: Allahoma make them few in numbers and kill them to
their last and never leave single on of them, and when I asked about the
kid they told me: this is Al-Qásim ben Al-<u>H</u>asan ben \`Ali ben Abi
<u>T</u>álib (PUH).  
Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) shouted in that situation: O patience
children of my brothers, O patience O people of my Household, by Allah
you shall not see a humiliating day ever after this day.  
Then Abu-Bakr ben Al-<u>H</u>asan ben \`Ali ben Abi <u>T</u>álib (PUH)
raised up and fought until he got killed. He was shot by an arrow by
\`Abdulláh ben \`Uqbah Al-Ghanawi and some say <u>H</u>armalah ben
Káhil.  
Then the brothers of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) raised up desiring to die
before him! The first to raise was: Abu-Bakr ben \`Ali ben Abi
<u>Tá</u>lib and his name was \`Ubaydilláh and his mother was Laylá bent
Mas\`ood, from the tribe of Nahshal. So he advanced while saying:

My sheik is \`Ali of the longest proud lineage  
from Háshim he is, of the truth and the grace  
This is <u>H</u>usayn the son of the prophet who was sent  
and we shall protect him with the sharp swords  
My life shall be ransom for him O what a brother of mine

Then he fought until he got killed by Zajr ben Badr Al-Nakh\`ee.  
Then his brother \`Umar ben \`Ali (PUH) raised after him while saying:

I shall beat you without any mercy  
that bastard verily he disbelieved the prophet  
O Zijr O Zijr come closer to \`Umar  
verily you'll meet today the hell of Saqar  
\[Saqar is one of the names of hell\]

Then he attacked Zijr the killer of his brother and he killed him. Then
he received the crowds and started to beat them with his sword bitterly
while saying:

Go away O enemies of Allah go away from \`Umar  
go away from the lion that crushes and frawns  
Shall strike you with the sword and never run away  
and not in war like the coward that returns

So he kept fighting until he got killed, may the peace of Allah be upon
him.  
Then Mo<u>h</u>ammed Al-A<u>s</u>ghar ben \`Ali ben Abi <u>T</u>álib
(PUH) raised up, and he was shot by an arrow by a man from Tameem, from
the children of Abán ben Dárim, so he killed him and brought his head.  
Then \`Abdulláh ben \`Ali (PUH) raised up and his mother was Laylá bent
Mas\`ood from Nahshal, and he fought until he got killed.  
Then when Al-\`Abbás ben \`Ali (PUH) saw the large number of deads among
his family he said to his brothers by his father and mother and they
are: \`Abdulláh and Ja\`far and \`Uthmán and their mother was
Um-Albaneen bent Khálid ben <u>H</u>ozám from the tribe of Kiláb, and
her original name was Fatima, he said to them: O children of my mother,
advance so I can see you in good for the sake of Allah and His
prophet.  
Then \`Abdulláh ben \`Ali (PUH) raised and he was 25 years old and was
saying:

I am the son of him of the help and the virtues  
that is \`Ali the good, the one of the deeds  
The sword of the prophet of Allah that is fierce  
every day verily is showing his fierce deeds

Then he fought with Háni ben Thobayt Al-<u>H</u>adhrami and he got
killed by Háni.  
Then after him his brother Ja\`far ben \`Ali (PUH) raised up while
saying:

I am Ja\`far one of the high places  
the son of \`Ali the good man of the deeds  
My ancestry by my uncle and my (motherly) uncle is the proudest

Then he was attacked by Háni ben Thobayt Al-<u>H</u>adhrami as well and
he killed him and brought his head, and some say he was shot by Khiwallá
on his head or in his eye.  
Then his brother \`Uthmán ben \`Ali raised up and took the place of his
brothers and he was 21 years old and he was saying:

Verily I am \`Uthmán the one of the pride  
my sheik is \`Ali the one of the purified deeds  
This is <u>H</u>usayn the kindest of the kindest  
and the master of the great men and the humbles  
After the prophet he is the viceroy and the nourisher

Then Khiwallá ben Yazeed Al-A<u>s</u>ba<u>h</u>i shot an arrow at his
forehead and he fell down from his horse and then a man from the tribe
of Abán ben Dárim came and killed him and beheaded him.  
Then after them, their brother Al-\`Abbás (PUH) raised up and he was the
eldest and as 34 years old and his title was Abul-Fadhl, and was called
also "The Water Bringer" and "The Moon of The Hashimites" and he was the
owner of the banner of Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), and he was handsome and
pretty with a huge body, if he rode the horse, his legs would touch he
ground, and he was the last one to stay with Al-<u>H</u>usayn, so he
asked for a permission from his brother A-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) to fight,
and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said to him: O my brother, you are owner of
my banner, and Al-\`Abbas (PUH) said: my chest is getting narrow and I
want to take the revenge from those hypocrites, and then
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said: then, go and bring some water for these
children. Then Al-\`Abbás when to the crowds and warned them against the
wrath of the Almighty but that was not useful! Then he got back to
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) to tell him what happened, but he heard the
children shout: the thirst! the thirst! So he took his horse and took
the skin (for water) and reached Al-Forát, and then he was surrounded by
4 thousands and they started shooting arrows at him but he didn't care
about their gatherings and was not afraid of their numbers and he said:

I am the who is known by the fierce shout  
known as the son of \`Ali, who is called <u>H</u>aydarah

And he turned them away from the banks and then he got into the water
and took a sip in his hand to drink, but he remembered the thirst of
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), so he dropped the water from his hand and said:

O my soul be lowered down after Al-<u>H</u>usayn  
and after him you shall not ever be  
This is Al-<u>H</u>usayn the drinker of the death  
and you want to drink the cold water?  
by Allah this is not the deeds of my creed  
and not the deeds of a man of true belief

Then he filled the skin with water and headed to the camp and they
blocked his way, so he started to beat them and say:

I am not afraid of death if death shows up  
until I get buried by the sharpened swords  
I am Al-\`Abbás and I shall go with the water  
and I am not afraid of the evil at battles  
And my soul shall be a shield for the purified grandson of the prophet

Then he turned them away from his way, and Zayd ben Warqá' Al-Johani
hided behind a palm tree, and struck him on his right hand and amputated
it, so he took the sword with his left hand and attacked while saying:

By Allah if you cut my right  
verily I shall protect my creed forever  
And defend an imam truthful in belief  
the son of the prophet, the purified and the entrusted

Then <u>H</u>akeem ben <u>T</u>ofayl hided behind a palm tree, and
struck him on his left and amputated it, so he hugged the banner to his
chest and said:

O my soul don't be afraid of the disbelievers  
and be glad with the mercy of the Almighty  
With the prophet, the chosen master  
by their sinful manners they cut off my left  
So my Lord make them feel the fire of hell

Then they gathered around him and the arrows arrived at him like the
rain, and one arrow struck the skin and the water poured down, and
another one struck his chest and another one struck his eye, and then a
man struck him with a pillar on his head and he fell down to the ground
while calling: peace upon you from me O Abá \`Abdilláh, and some say
that he said: peace upon you from me O Abá \`Abdillah, help me O
brother.  
And then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) came to him and saw his both hands
amputated and thickened with injuries, and then he bent over him and
cried out loud and said: now verily my backbone had been broken and my
tricks are not much to be done.  
Then he attacked the enemies and struck them right and left and all of
them escaped before him like the goat that escapes from the wolf, while
he was saying: to where are you escaping and you killed my brother?
where to you escape and you've killed my helper, until he turned the
enemies away from Abul-Fadhl, and while Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) was
sitting beside his brother Al-\`Abbás, his (Al-\`Abbás') soul got
released and Al-<u>H</u>usayn left him at that place.  
Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn stood up and went back to the camp with a broken
back and sadness and crying, and cleaning his tears from his eyes with
his sleeves, and then Sokaynah \[his daughter\] came to him and asked
about her uncle (Al-\`Abbás), and he told her that he got killed, and
Zaynab heard him saying that so she shouted: Alas! my brother! Alas!
\`Abbás! Alas! how are we lost after you! And the women cried and
Al-<u>H</u>usayn cried with them and said: Alas! how are we lost after
you! And when Al-\`Abbás got killed, Al-<u>H</u>usayn looked around and
so no one that would nourish him, and he looked at his family and his
companions and they were all butchered like the sheeps, while he was
hearing the women and children cry out loud, and then he called out
loud: any one that would nourish the Household of the prophet (PUH)? Any
believer that would fear Allah for us? Any helper that likes to meet
Allah by helping us? Any helper that likes what Allah has for him for
helping us? And the voices of the women raised with crying.  
Then he went to the enterance of the tent and said to Zaynab: give me my
infant to pay him the farewell, and they brought him his son \`Abdulláh,
and his mother was Al-Rabáb bent Imri' Al-Qays Al-Kalbi, so he took him
and put him in his lap and bent over him to kiss him, but
<u>H</u>armalah ben Káhil Al-Asdi shot him with an arrow that got into
his neck and killed him, and then he said to Zaynab: take him, and he
took the blood with his hand and when it was full he threw the blood
towards the sky \[and some say no drop came down to earth\] and said: (O
Allah) make it easy for me what happened with him verily it is under the
eyes of Allah, Allahoma don't let him be lower in value than
Fa<u>s</u>eel \[the breed of the camel of the prophet <u>S</u>álih.
Check the prophets in islamic literature\]. Then he carried him and put
him with the dead people of his Household, and some say that he dug a
grave for him by the edge of his sword and buried him there.  
Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) advanced toward the crowds and raising his
sword and despaired of life and called the people for a combat, and he
killed everyone that met him, until he killed so many of them. Then he
attacked the right wing and said:

To be killed is better than being ashamed  
and the shame is better than going to hell  
by Allah this and that are not my companions

Then he attacked the left wing and said:

I am Al-<u>H</u>usayn ben \`Ali  
I've sworn not to bend  
I shall protect the children of my father  
and go on with the way of the prophet

some narrators said: by Allah, we've never seen a bereaved man that lost
all his children and his Household and his companion in his likes of
bravery, by Allah I've never seen one like him before or after him, and
when the men gather around him to attack he would strike them with his
sword and make them tear away from his right and left like the goat that
is attacked by the wolf! He was attacking them and their numbers
completed the 30 thousands and all of them are defeated before like the
locusts and then he would return to the center and say: verily there is
no power except by Allah.  
When Shimr saw that, he ordered the knights to be at the back of the
foot soldiers and then ordered the archers to shoot at him and so they
did until his shield became like a hedgehog, and then Shimr came with
some fellows and blocked the way between him and his harem! Then
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) shouted: woe to you! O followers of Abu-Sufyán,
if you have no religion and were not afraid of the judgement day then be
free in this life and turn back to your ancestries if you were Arabs as
you claim, then Shimr called him and said: what are you saying O son of
Fatima? Then he replied: I say, I am fighting you and you are fighting
me and the women have no guilt, so turn away your ignorant people and
your tyrants and don't let them attack my harem as long I am alive. Then
Shimr said: you've got that O son of Fatima, and then he shouted: stay
away from the harem of the man and point at him directly, by my life he
is a graceful man! So they pointed at him for fighting and Shimr was
stirring up the people to fight Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH), and they
attacked him and he would attack them back and they turn away from his
way, and he was asking for a drop of water but couldn't find any.  
Then he attacked in the direction of Al-Forát, against \`Amr ben
Al-<u>H</u>ajjáj with 4 thousands men, and he exposed them away from the
water, and got into the water with the horse, and when the horse started
to drink, Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) said: you are thirsty and I am thirsty
and I shall not drink until you drink, and horse raised his head up like
if he understood the talk! Then when Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) extended his
arm to drink the water, a man called him and said: do you drink the
water while your harem is exposed? Then he dropped the water and didn't
drink and heading to the tent (to protect his harem), and then he (PUH)
got back to fight the enemies of Allah and remained in the fight until
he was injured with 72 injuries. Then he stood to take a rest and he was
weak to continue fighting, and while he was standing, Abul-<u>H</u>otoof
Al-Jo\`fi threw a stone t him, and some say with an arrow, and it hit
his forehead, so he took a cloth to clean the blood from his forehead,
and while doing so a poisoned arrow with three heads arrived into his
heart! Then he (PUH) said: by the name of Allah and by Allah, and on the
way of the prophet of Allah, then he raised his head to the sky and
said: O my Lord, verily You know that they are killing a man that has no
likings on earth, and then he took the arrow and got him out from his
back and the blood gushed out like the rain! The blood gushing made him
exhausted so he sat on the ground and turning his neck around, and in
that situation, Málik ben Al-Nisr Al-Kindi came to him and cursed him
and hit his honorable head with the sword, and there was a cloak over
his head, and the cloak got filled with blood, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn
(PUH): may you never eat with your hand neither drink, and may Allah
gather you with the wrong people, and then he threw the cloak away and
put his hood.  
And in that situation, \`Abdulláh ben Al-<u>H</u>asan (PUH) got out and
he was a lad of 11 years, and he went to his uncle Al-<u>H</u>usayn, and
Zaynab then went after him to keep him away, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH)
said to her: O my sister keep him away, but the lad denied fiercely and
came to his uncle Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and stood beside him and said:
I shall not leave my uncle, then Ba<u>h</u>r ben Ka\`b wanted to wind
his sword to Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and the lad said to him: woe to you!
O son of the bad woman! you want to kill my uncle! Then Ba<u>h</u>r ben
Ka\`b struck him with the sword and he received it with his hand and it
was amputated to the skin and remained hanged up, and the kid called:
Alas! my uncle! or Alas! O my mother! And then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH)
took him and hugged him to his chest and said: O son of my brother be
patient for the adversities that befell upon you and wait for the
goodness, for verily Allah will make you follow your good fathers and
the prophet of Allah (PUH) and \`Ali (PUH) and <u>H</u>amzah and Ja\`far
and Al-<u>H</u>asan (PUT), and then <u>H</u>armalah ben Káhil threw at
him an arrow and killed him in the lap of his uncle, and then
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) raised his hand and said: Allahoma forbid them
the rains of the skies and forbid them the blessings of the earth,
Allahoma if you made them live for a while then let them be separated
severely and make them tear apart in bands, and never make their rulers
be satisfied with them, for they have invited us to support us and then
attacked us to kill us.  
Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) remained on the ground for some time
although they could have killed him, but every tribe was depending on
the other and hated to do so.  
Hilál ben Náfi\` said: I was standing with the fellows of \`Umar ben
Sa\`d when a caller shouted: O be happy prince, this is Shimr killed
Al-<u>H</u>usayn, so I went out between the two rows and took a look at
him and I've seen him protecting himself, and by Allah, I've never seen
a man that got dipped in his blood that would be better than him, and no
one with a face brighter than his, and I was busy looking at the halo of
his face and the beauty of his shape and didn't think of killing him,
and while he was in that situation he asked for water, and I heard a man
saying: by Allah you shall not drink the water until you go to hell and
drink from its fire, and I heard him reply: I shall go to hell and drink
of its fire? No by Allah, I shall go to my grandfather the prophet of
Allah (PUH) and shall live with him in his own home in a firmly
established in the favour of a Mighty King, and I shall drink a water
that is not dirty and I shall complain to him about you've done to me,
and all of them got angry like if Allah never planted anything of mercy
in their hearts.  
Then Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) raised his hand to the sky and said:
Allahoma, O You of the High Place, of the Mighty Power, of the Great
Wisdom, not in need of the creatures, and high in His Pride, verily You
are Able for whatever You desire, close in mercy, and true with the
promise, and Graceful with His favors, and a Tester of goodness, close
whenever You are called, and surrounding whatever You have created, and
verily You accept the repenting for those who repent, and verily You are
Able for what You desire, and verily You get whatever You want, Thankful
if You have been praised, and You mention those who mention You, and I
pray to You for my need, and ask You for my necessity, and go toward You
when I am afraid and cry for my adversities, and I seek help from You
when I am weak, and I depend on You when I am satisfied, Allahoma, judge
between us and between those people for they have tricked us and let us
down and betrayed us and killed us, and we are the Household of Your
prophet, and the children of Your beloved Mo<u>h</u>ammed (PUH), the one
who You have chosen him for the Message, and made him to receive the
inspirations, so make for us, O Lord, a relief from our matter O You the
most Merciful of all. Patience over what You have destined O Lord, no
other god but You, O Helper of those who need the help.  
Then Shimr shouted at the knights and the foot soldiers: woe to you!
what do you wait from the man? Kill him may your mothers be bereaved,
and so they attacked him from all the sides and Zor\`ah ben Shorayk hit
him on his left shoulder, and Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) hit Zor\`ah and
killed him. Then another man hit him on his holy shoulder with his sword
and made him fall on his face, and he was sitting. Then he started to
stand up and fall down, and then Sinán ben Anas Al-Nakh\`ee stabbed him
in his throat and took the spear out and stabbed him in his chest, and
threw him with an arrow into his neck, so he then fell down and sat on
the ground and took the arrow out from his neck and started to collect
the blood with his hands and whenever they were full he would paint his
head and his beard with it while saying: this is how shall I meet Allah,
painted with blood and my rights have been taken.  
Then \`Umar ben Sa\`d said to Sinán ben Anas: get down woe to you! go to
Al-<u>H</u>usayn (PUH) and make him rest, and then Sinán said to
Khiwallá ben Yazeed: go and behead him, and Khiwallá went to do so but
he got weakened and shocked, so Sinán said to him and some say Shimr
said to him: may Allah disolve you arms, why are you shaking? Then Sinán
got down and some say it was Shimr and he killed him and amputated his
holy head while saying: I behead you and I know you are the master and
the son of the prophet of Allah and the best of people from mother's and
father's side, and then he gave the head to Khiwallá and said to him:
take it to the prince \`Umar ben Sa\`d.  
Then the crowds came to steal whatever he (PUH) had, thus his shirt was
taken by Is-<u>h</u>áq ben Khawiyyah Al-Hadhrami, and his pants were
taken by Ba<u>h</u>r ben Ka\`b and his turban was taken by Al-Akhnas,
and his shield was taken by \`Umar ben Sa\`d, and his clothes were taken
by a brother of Is-<u>h</u>áq ben Khawiyyah, and his velvet was taken by
Qays ben Al-Ash\`ath ben Qays, and his cloak was taken by Málik ben
Nisr, and his sword was taken by Al-Faláfis Al-Nahshali from the tribe
of Dárim, and his sandals were taken by Al-Aswad ben Khálid, and his
ring was taken by Bajdal ben Saleem Al-Kalbi who amputated the finger
with the ring.
