His supplication for the twenty-sixth of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Bless Muhammad and the Progeny of Muhammad. I beseech

You, O the Lord of the seven Heavens, seven Earths, the things in them

and in between them, the Lord of all seven quatrains (Surah-e-Hamd)

and the great Quran, the Lord of Jibraeel, Mikaeel, Israfil, Lord of all
the

Angels, Lord of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) the last of the Prophets and the

Messengers and the Lord of the whole creation. O Allah! I beseech You

with Your name with which the Heavens remain well set in their places

and so do the Earth, with the blessing of that name, and through that

name You have kept in Your knowledge the measurement of the

oceans, and the weight of the mountains, and with it You cause death to

the living, and give life to the dead, and with that name You create the

clouds, and through it You send forth the wind, and through it provide

the bondsmen with sustenance, and reckoned through it the particles of

sand, and do what You wish and whereby You say to a thing "Be" and it

comes into existence, so remove my poverty with Your Needlessness,

and accept my invocation, and bestow on me my wants, and fulfill my

hopes, and favour me with happiness as a blessing for me out of Your

Mercy, and grant me peace in place of fears, and keep me alive with

perfect bounties, comfort, the best of sustenance, affluence and a happy

life. And enable me to offer thanks to You for what You have bestowed

upon me, and continue this without any break throughout my life till You

change it with the bounties of the Hereafter. O Allah! Lies within Your

control the destiny of the World, Hereafter, the day and night, the life

and death and so also the success, failure, virtue and vice are
controlled

by You. O Allah! Bless me in Faith on which depends my affair and

bless me in this world the source of my livelihood, and bless me in my

Hereafter to which is my return and bless me in all my affairs. O Allah!

You are Allah, There is no god save You. Your promise is true and so is

our presence before You. I seek refuge with You from the evils of life

and death. I seek refuge with You from the abhorrent affairs of the
world

and those of the Hereafter. And I seek refuge with You from the evils of

Dajjal. And I seek refuge with You against skepticism, vices, slackness

and defeat. And I seek refuge with You from miserliness and prodigality.

O Allah! It has passed what was to happen as a sequel to my past

deeds performed against my own self. O my Lord! You are my Lord, You

have control over me and I do not have. O my Lord! You created me

helpless and I am nothing but due to You. There is no goodness except

from You and I could never avert any evil save that which You dispelled.

To dispel the evil was neither within my power nor could I think of
doing

so. O my Lord! You took me where I could not hope to reach and

bestowed upon me O' my Lord! that for which I had lost all hopes Praise

be therefore to You. O the Forgiver of sins! Forgive me and cast into my

heart Your pleasure so as to render easy for me the most difficult

situations in the world O my Lord! Bestow upon me all the means of

happiness, comfort and goodness. O Allah! Grant me such means and

guide me towards it and show me the way to get out of the difficulties.
O

Allah! From those of Your bondsmen to whom You delegated power to

exercise on me and authority to settle my affair, You take that control

from them within Your possession from their hearts, tongues, ears eyes,

from their front, from behind them, from above them, from underneath

their feet, from their right, from their left, and from where You wish,
and

in the manner You desire till none can reach me with evil intention. O

Allah! Keep me under Your protection and near You for Your nearness

is honoured, Your praise is great. There is no god save You. You are all

peace and peace emanates from You. O the Glorious and Gracious! I

beseech You to save me from the Hell-fire and accommodate me in the

abode of peace. O Allah! I request You to grant me all the good of this

world and of the Hereafter, and I seek refuge with You against all the

evils of this world and that of the Hereafter known to me or not. And I

ask You all the good requested for and all the good not requested for.

And I seek Your protection against all evils I fear or I have not feared

thereof. And grant me sustenance from sources I can think of and from

sources I cannot think of. O Allah! I am Your bondsman the son of Your

bondsman and the son of Your maid. Within Your control is my destiny.

Your decisions are just. I beseech You with every name of Yours

whereby You have named Yourself, or which You have sent down in

any of Your revealed Books, or taught anyone of Your Creation, or

Preserved it in the Knowledge of the Unseen with You. Bless

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.), Your Ummi Prophet, bondsman, Messenger and

the chosen one from Your Creation, and his pure and virtuous Progeny,

and have mercy on Muhammad and his Progeny and have mercy on

them in the manner You blessed, favoured and showed mercy to Ibrahim

and his Progeny, verily You are Praiseworthy and Glorious. And make

the Quran the light for my heart soul, and through it make easy for me

my affairs, and expand my chest through it, and make it a delight of my

heart, consolation of my grief, and through it dispel my sadness and

worries, and make pleasant by its blessing my eating and drinking, and

guide me through it in my hearing and seeing, and make it a light for my

mind, bones, nerves hairs, nails, and skin, in front of me, above me,

below me, on my right and on my left. And let it act as light at my
death,

and a light in my grave, and a light at the time of reckoning, and a
light in

everything till You convey me to Paradise, O the Illuminator of the

Heavens and the Earth. You are as You have praised Yourself in Your

Book. Allah is the Illuminator of the Heavens and the Earth; the

similitude of His Light is as a niche in which is a lamp. The lamp is in
a

glass; the glass is as it were a star shinning bright, lit from blessed
olive

tree, neither eastern nor western, the oil whereof almost glows forth of

itself, and even though fire touches it not. Light upon Light Allah
guides

to His Light whomsoever He wills. Allah sets parables for people and

Allah is All-Aware of all things. O Allah! Guide me through Your Light

and appoint on the day of resurrection a light in front of me, behind
me,

on my right side, and on my left side, to guide me to the abode of
peace,

O the Glorious and the Gracious! O Allah! I seek forgiveness and

comfort for me for my people, for my children, and protection for my

wealth in this world and in the Hereafter. O Allah! Bless Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and protect me from the front, from the back,

from the right side, from the left side, from above, and from below. I
seek

refuge with You. O Allah! Master of the realm! You give the realm to

whomsoever You like, and take away the realm from whomsoever You

like, in Your hands lies all the good; verily! You are over all things

Mighty. You cause the night to pass into the day and You cause the day

to pass into the night. You bring forth the living out of the dead and
You

bring forth the dead out of the living, and You give sustenance to

whomsoever You like without measure. O the beneficent and the

Merciful in this world and the Hereafter! You bestow Your beneficence

and Mercy on whomsoever You like withhold the same for whomsoever

You like. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and have mercy

on me, repay my loan, forgive my sins and fulfill my needs, verily! You

are Powerful over all things. O Allah! I beseech You for You are the

Master of everything and what You wish does happen. O Allah I seek

from You true belief strong conviction without any skepticism, humility

with no element of pride in it, mercy which should lead me to the honour

of Your grace in this world and in the Hereafter. Verily You are
Powerful

over all things. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure and purified

Progeny with Your mercy, O the most Merciful!
