<p>His supplication seeking the opinion of Allah</p>  
<p>(Istekhara)</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>Whatever Allah wills, happens. O Allah! I seek goodness from You like a</p>  
<p>person who has put his affairs in Your hands, put his soul in Your</p>  
<p>control, and awaits Your order in his affairs, has turned to You, and</p>  
<p>when calamities befall he has relied on You. O Allah! Let goodness be in</p>  
<p>my affair and not against me, for my benefit, not for my loss, grant me</p>  
<p>help and let not this help be against me. My help must be in my favour</p>  
<p>and not against me. Make me strong and do not let others overpower</p>  
<p>me. Guide me towards goodness, save me from deviation, make me</p>  
<p>agreeable on Your judgment and satisfied on Your power because</p>  
<p>whatever You wish is done and You have Power over all things. O Allah!</p>  
<p>If this transaction is good for me and if it carries goodness for me in this</p>  
<p>world and the Hereafter make it easy for me, and if there is anything</p>  
<p>other than it, make it away for me. O Most Merciful of all the mercifuls.</p>  
<p>Surely You have power over all the things and Allah is sufficient for us</p>  
<p>and most excellent is the protector.</p>
