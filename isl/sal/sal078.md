His supplication for achieving martyrdom in

the way of Allah

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! You have shown a way out of many ways and have approved

of it. Have called Your pious people on it, and have termed it as a best

way which is beneficial for us and is a door of Your forgiveness and a

way of acceptance, then on that path the soul of the believers will be

purchased and Heaven will be their compensation, these will be the

people who wage a Holy War, are killed and Your promise is truth which

is mentioned in Torah, Bible and the Quran. Therefore include me

among those who sell their souls to You and whatever transactions they

do, they fulfill it, without turning their faces or doing any changes in
it

and it is only adhering to Your promise, and have done to achieve Your

love and nearness. Send blessings on Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)

and his progeny and make him a supplement for my deeds and for You

a witness of belief in Your oneness. I do it in such a way that it
becomes

a source of Your pleasure and a way for pardoning my sins. And grant

me the position of those living, who have succeeded. With the banner of

truth fighting against Your oppressors and tyrants, with firm steps and

have never expressed doubts, and I seek refuge from that which erases

good deeds.
