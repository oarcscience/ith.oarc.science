<p>His supplication for the twenty-eighth of the</p>  
<p>month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! I seek refuge with You against everything other than You. O</p>  
<p>Allah! You are the Greatest. O Allah! Deprive me not of the goodness of</p>  
<p>what You have bestowed and make me not suffer any evil what You</p>  
<p>have not bestowed. O Allah! I beseech You to bestow upon me family,</p>  
<p>wealth, faith, trust, and various children better than bestowed upon Your</p>  
<p>bondsmen. O Allah! I am dependent on You, and am afraid of You, and</p>  
<p>seek protection from You. O Allah! Protect me against any change in my</p>  
<p>name, and disfigure not my body, involve me not in trials, and impose</p>  
<p>not on me calamities after calamities. O Allah! I seek refuge with You</p>  
<p>from riches leading me to any revolt against You, from egoistic</p>  
<p>inclinations of any ruining and from disgracing performances. O Allah!</p>  
<p>Forgive my sins, accept my penitence, make me manifest my arguments,</p>  
<p>conceal my defects and make Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his chosen</p>  
<p>Progeny my Masters and solicitors of Your Mercy for me. O Allah! I seek</p>  
<p>refuge with You against any utterance leading me to disobedience to</p>  
<p>You and to seek pleasure of other than You. O Allah! I seek refuge with</p>  
<p>You that any person other than me should become more auspicious in</p>  
<p>respect of what You have bestowed on me. O Allah! I seek refuge with</p>  
<p>You from the evil of Satan, from the evil of those in power and from the</p>  
<p>orders promulgated by the writing of pens. And I beseech You for</p>  
<p>virtuous deeds, life full of bliss and sustenance flowing abundantly. O</p>  
<p>Allah! You record the sin, and are well aware of our secrets, and</p>  
<p>intervene between the hearts, and the hearts are turned towards You,</p>  
<p>and our secrets are manifest before You. Verily, Your command, when</p>  
<p>You intend anything, is only that You say it "Be" and there it is. O Allah! I</p>  
<p>beseech You in the name of Your Mercy to infuse the spirit of obedience</p>  
<p>to You, in every part of my body that I may act obediently, and then</p>  
<p>never take this spirit away. O Allah! I beseech You in the name of Your</p>  
<p>Mercy to remove disobedience to You from all the parts of my body that</p>  
<p>may abstain from disobedience to You and let it not ever return to me. O</p>  
<p>Allah! You are a symbol of kindness, and You like forgiveness, so</p>  
<p>please forgive me. O Allah! You were and nothing was there to be</p>  
<p>perceived and You will survive everything. You are Ever-living,</p>  
<p>Self-subsisting. The eyes sleep and the stars set down but neither</p>  
<p>slumber nor sleep seizes You. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his</p>  
<p>Progeny, and dispel my grief and anxiety, and enable me to come out</p>  
<p>from every affair that grieves me, and make me firm in the belief in</p>  
<p>making You my centre of hopes so as to dissuade me from entertaining</p>  
<p>any hope from Your creation, and that I trust none save You. O Allah!</p>  
<p>Drive me neither to a ruining place nor bring me nearer to it nor include</p>  
<p>me among the unmindful persons. O Allah! I seek refuge with You</p>  
<p>against my misguiding Your bondsmen and against entertaining any</p>  
<p>uncertainty about Your accepting any invocation. O Allah! Your Book</p>  
<p>has recorded my sins and Your knowledge has encompassed them and</p>  
<p>Your awareness has gone to the detail of it. I am miscreant sinner and</p>  
<p>You are Forgiving, Benevolent Lord. I am ready of offer my penitence to</p>  
<p>You. I confess what has passed. Kindly overlook what has happened</p>  
<p>and forgive my past sins. For Verily, You turn mercifully toward Your</p>  
<p>bondsmen. O Allah! None can be better than You in showing Mercy to</p>  
<p>me, so kindly be compassionate to me, and impose not anyone in this</p>  
<p>world and in the Hereafter on me who may not show mercy towards me.</p>  
<p>O Allah! Call me not to account for the misdeeds of mine which You</p>  
<p>have kindly concealed so as to punish me on the Day of Resurrection</p>  
<p>and let not Your entire creation mock at me. O my Lord! Forgive me in</p>  
<p>both the worlds for You are All-forgiving, Merciful. O Allah! I deserve not</p>  
<p>to reach Your Mercy but Your Mercy can reach me and take me under</p>  
<p>its shelter for it has taken everything within its fold; it should therefore</p>  
<p>take me under its fold, O the Most Merciful! O Allah! There are some of</p>  
<p>Your privileged bondsmen who obey Your Commands and carry out that</p>  
<p>for which You have created them. This ability of theirs is under Your</p>  
<p>obligation, bestowed by none other than You. O the Most Merciful! Your</p>  
<p>Blessing them with Your Mercy preceded their obedience to You. O</p>  
<p>Allah! O my Master! O my Lord! O my Allah! O my Shelter! O my</p>  
<p>Protection! O my Strength! O the Comfort of my heart! O my Creator! O</p>  
<p>my Providence! Bless me with the privilege given to them with ability to</p>  
<p>perform which they were made able and show to me All-embracing</p>  
<p>Perfect Mercy as shown to them, O the Most Merciful! O You! Whom</p>  
<p>multiple voices do not confuse O You! Whom the requests of the</p>  
<p>seekers do not put in the wrong. O You! Whom the pressing solicitations</p>  
<p>of persistent requesters do not annoy, make me taste the coolness of</p>  
<p>Your Forgiveness and Sweetness of Your Remembrance and Your</p>  
<p>Mercy. O Allah! I beseech You for Your Forgiveness of my sins for which</p>  
<p>I turned penitent to You but committed the same again. And I seek</p>  
<p>forgiveness for disobedience to You, the strength thereof I derived with</p>  
<p>Your Bounties bestowed on me. And I seek Your forgiveness for all such</p>  
<p>deeds performed to derive Your pleasure but got me mingled with the</p>  
<p>things which did not befit You. And I seek Your forgiveness for the</p>  
<p>promise which I made but I broke my promise. And I seek Your</p>  
<p>forgiveness for deeds committed under the urge of my self-seeking soul</p>  
<p>to take advantage of the respite granted by You, through the</p>  
<p>performance of such deeds during the respite is not permitted, O the</p>  
<p>Glorious and the Gracious! O You! Who bestowed upon me the</p>  
<p>knowledge of His Self, occupy me not in anyone else other than You,</p>  
<p>and entrust me not to anyone save You, and make me independent of</p>  
<p>Your creation save You, O the Most Merciful! Bless Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) and his purified Progeny.</p>
