His Dua expressing sincere attention

towards Allah

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! You love most those who have love for Your Apostles. You are

more sufficient for one who believes in You. You know their secret what

is in their hearts and You know the hidden secrets of their behaviour.

This knowledge is of their disconcertments, that is why their secrets
are

disclosed for You and their hearts are full of sorrow. When they are

horrified of travels they remember You and if they are in disaster, they

beseech for help because they know all matters are in Your control and

the way of escape depends on Your will. O Allah! If I fail to ask about
my

desire show me the correct way and keep my mind towards it because it

is not improbable from Your guidance not surprising of Your leadership.

O my Lord! Make me ready for Your pardon and not for justice (It is

difficult to escape without forgiveness) O Allah! You have revealed Your

Holy book on Your Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and said: (1) They slept very
little

in the night and prayed for Your forgiveness in the morning. So I also

ask You for forgiveness and I turn towards You. (2) You are great and

Superior and have said: Follow the people from where they go and pray

for pardon from Allah. Indeed Allah is forgiving and merciful. And I ask
for

pardon and repent (3) You are Great and Superior and have said: O

Prophet! Forgive them and accept their repentance and make them

aware of it and when you intend to do, have faith on Allah because Allah

likes the faithful. I also ask for ablution and repent. (4) Allah You
are the

great and superior You have said those who showed high handedness,

would come to you and ask for absolution from You and Your Prophet

(s.a.w.a.), they would have found that Allah is merciful and Forgiving.
I

also ask for forgiveness and repent (5) Allah You are the great and have

said: One who commits bad deeds and is unjust and then pray for

forgiveness, Allah forgives him. He is Merciful. Now I repent and ask
for

forgiveness. (6) Allah, You are Great and Superior and have said: Why

don't they repent and why don't they pray for pardon? Allah is Forgiving

and Merciful. And I pray for Pardon and repent. (7) Allah, You are Great

and have said: Allah will not chastise them as long as the Apostle is
with

them. Allah will not curse them until they beg pardon of Allah. And now
I

beg pardon of Him and repent (8) Allah You are Great and Superior and

You have said: O my Apostle! You ask pardon for them or do not ask for

the pardon for them. If you will pray seventy times Allah will not
accept. I

beg for Your pardon and repent. (9) Allah, You are Great and Superior

and have said: The Prophet and his believers have no right to pray for

forgiveness for polytheists, not even if they related to them. They are

considered the inmates of Hell. And I seek for forgiveness and repent

\(10\) And You are the great and Superior and have said: Ibrahim’s
(a.s.)

prayer for forgiveness was only for Azar for his given promise and

because of the given promise he asked forgiveness from Allah. And I

seek pardon from You and repent. (11) Allah, You are the Great and

Superior and have said: You all seek forgiveness of Allah and repent.

He will bestow You the benefits from His excellent treasures. He will

bestow the robe of honour to all. I seek for forgiveness and repent.

Allah, You are the Great and have said: Seek forgiveness from Allah and

then repent. Allah will send rain from the sky and increase your
strength

and do not be disobedient like the culprits. And I seek pardon from You

and repent. (12) Allah, You are the Great and Superior and said: Allah

has created you from dust and settled you on it. So ask forgiveness from

Allah and repent. No doubt He is very near to you and accepts your

prayer. And I seek forgiveness and repent. You have said: You are the

Great and ask for forgiveness and then repent. Indeed, My Lord is

merciful and a Great lover. And I beseech forgiveness and repent. (13)

And You have said: You are the Master of Honour and excellent. And

asked the woman to ask forgiveness for your sin because certainly you

are a sinner. And I beseech pardon for my sin and repent. (14) And You

have said You are honorable and Superior. O my honourable parents,

beseech pardon from Allah for our sins. As we are sinners and we

beseech for pardon and repent (15) And You have said You are the

Great and Honourable. We shall beseech pardon from Allah for you

because He is the Forgiving and Merciful. And I beseech pardon and

repent (16) And You have said: You are the Master of blessings and the

High. Who has prevented the people to believe in God after guidance

and seek forgiveness from God? And I beseech Pardon from You and

repent. (17) And You have said: You are the Great and Superior

(Ibrahim (a.s.)) Peace be with you. I shall beseech pardon for you very

soon as Allah is very kind with me. And I beseech pardon and repent.

\(18\) And You have said: You are the Great and Excellent. Allow anyone

if you like and beseech pardon for him. Without doubt Allah is the

Concealer of Faults and I beg pardon from You. (19) And You have said

You are the Great and Honourable. O people why do you haste to turn

towards the evil before good, and why don't you ask for Allah's

blessings? Certainly He would show kindness to you. (20) I beseech

forgiveness from You and repent. And You have said: You are Great

and magnificent. And Dawood (a.s.) knew that I was taking a trial so he

beseeched for pardon and bowed down and fell and repented. I

beseech for repentance. (21) And You have said: You are the Great and

Superior. Those Angels who raise the empyrean and repeated

invocation of Allah's name around His empyrean with faith and beseech

pardon for the pious. And I beseech pardon and repent. (22) And You

have said: You are the Great and magnificent. Have patience as Allah's

promise is true and beg for pardon of Your sins and invoke Allah's name

day and night. I beg pardon from You and repent. (23) And You have

said: You are Great and Magnificent: Believe in God and be firm and

beseech for pardon. I beseech pardon and repent (24) And You have

said: You are the Great and Magnificent. And the Angels praise God and

beseech blessings for the worldly people and yes, Certainly Allah is

Merciful and Forgiving. And I beg for blessings and repent. And You

have said - You are the Great and Magnificent. Remember! Certainly He

is Allah and there is no other God except Him. And beg from Allah to

forgive your sins and for all other pious persons. Allah knows all your

activities. I beg for blessings and repent. (25) And You have said - You

are the Great and Superior. Very soon Bedouins will say: O Messenger

of Allah (s.a.w.a.) our children and wealth kept us busy. So pray Allah
to

forgive us. I beseech for blessings and repent. (26) And You have said -

You are the Great and Magnificent. Till you believe in Allah the One.

Except that Ibrahim (a.s.) had promised his father (Uncle Azar (a.s.))
that

he will pray for him but I do not have authority from Allah about you. O

My Lord! We believe in You and require attention from You and we shall

return to You. And I beseech forgiveness and repent. (27) And You have

said You are Great And Magnificent: And when they are informed the

Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) will beseech absolution for You, they

bowed down their heads. And You will see those people who disobey

Your orders because they are proud. And I beseech forgiveness and

repent (28) And You have said - You are the Great and superior. You

are alike for them. As you wished forgiveness for them but do not pray

for forgiveness for them. Allah will never forgive them. I beseech

forgiveness from You and repent. (29) And You have said - You are the

Great and Superior: And beseech for forgiveness from your Lord. He is

Forgiving. I repent and beseech for forgiveness. And You have said -

You are Honourable and Respectable. He is worthy competent. And

beseech forgiveness. Indeed He is the Concealer of Faults. I beseech

for forgiveness and repent. And You have said - You are the Great and

Superior. Be devoted to God and ask for forgiveness because He is an

accepter of repentance. And I beseech forgiveness and repent in Your

court.
