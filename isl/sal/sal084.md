\(83\)

His supplication when someone praised him

in his presence

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! You know me better than I know myself and I am more aware of

myself than these people. O Allah make me as good as they think and

forgive my deeds, which they are ignorant of.
