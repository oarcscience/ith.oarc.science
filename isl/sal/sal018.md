Dua recited in morning prayers at the time

of Dawn

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Although my sins are such that deserve severing of relations

but I don't desire to sever relations due to my sins, neither can I
speak

anything about Your happiness nor can I take refuge due to my wants,

nor due to my weakness can I repent fully. I have come, so that You

overlook my drawbacks. Your mercy is my source. Bless Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and bestow honour on me by Your

forgiveness. (Then recite 300 times "Al Afw").
