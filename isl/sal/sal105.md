\(104\)

Another of His supplication after the

morning prayers

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I have recited this prayer not with any desire or fulfilling of
any

hopes but it is only for the obedience of Your commands. O Allah if
there

is any deficiency, whether in intention or in standing position or in

recitation or in bowing on in prostration do not hold me responsible but

accept it and bestow forgiveness and oblige me, by Your mercy, O most

merciful of all the mercifuls.
