His supplication when turning sideways on

bed

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

There is no god but Allah. He is the living, the self Existing. Glory be
to

Allah Lord of the Prophets and Messengers. Glory be to Allah, Lord of

the Heavens and everything in it and he is the Lord of the Great Throne

and peace be upon the Messenger and praise be to Allah, Lord of the

Worlds.
