\(102\)

His supplication after the five daily prayers.

Recite Surah Tauheed twelve times then spread your hands and

recite the following Dua:

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I beseech You by Your safe, concealed, pure and blessed

names and I seek Your great names and Your great strength that You

bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, and grant me respite from

fire, and remove me from this world peacefully and make me enter the

heaven cleansed of all sins. And make the beginning of my prayers a

success and the middle a success and the end filled completely with

goodness, as surely You understand the concealed things clearly.
