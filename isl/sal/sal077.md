His supplication when he was aggrieved

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Look at me attentively with the eyes, which never sleep, and

help me with the power, which is never subdued, and forgive me by

Your Grace. O Lord! When You are my hope I can never be destroyed.

O Lord! You are far greater and above to the one whom I fear, I seek

success from Allah and I turn through the means of Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) the messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny). O

the sufficient and the protector of Prophet Ibrahim and O the one to
save

Moosa from the clutches of PHAROH, save me from these problems.

Allah is my nourisher and I do not ascribe a partner to Him. Sufficient
is

He as a nourisher for all other nourishers, the Creator for all the

creations and the one to stop from prohibited things. Allah is
sufficient

except Whom there no God and one on Whom I rely. He is the Lord of

the great throne.
