<p>Another His supplication famous as</p>  
<p>"Supplication of grief"</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! Do not make me love the things which You detest neither make</p>  
<p>me away from the things which You love. O Allah! I seek refuge that I</p>  
<p>agree to Your wrath or I disagree to Your wishes, or I reject Your</p>  
<p>commands, or I mix with Your enemies and transgress Your laws. O</p>  
<p>Allah! Make me adhere to Your laws of permissible things which bring</p>  
<p>me near to You and make me away from prohibited things which makes</p>  
<p>me away from You. O Most Merciful of all the mercifuls. O Allah! I seek</p>  
<p>of You to grant me a tongue, which remembers, and a heart that thanks</p>  
<p>You. A sincere faith and a humble body. Grant me Your love, and let</p>  
<p>Your love be firm in my heart. O Allah if You bestow Mercy on me then</p>  
<p>my faith is good, and if Your wrath descends on me then it is the result</p>  
<p>of my oppression, tyranny and excesses done on myself. Neither I have</p>  
<p>an opportunity to offer an excuse nor I think of a way to amend it. O</p>  
<p>Allah! When death approaches me and my days are over because it is</p>  
<p>necessary to be present in Your Presence. You will surely place me in</p>  
<p>Paradise. O Allah! The present and the past dependents will envy me</p>  
<p>after which there will be no repentance and after this friendship there will</p>  
<p>be no friends, and make my place in the Heaven, honourable. O Allah!</p>  
<p>Clothe me with the dress of faith and honour, before the degradation</p>  
<p>and humiliation in hell. O Allah! I praise You a lot so that my examination</p>  
<p>becomes easy. O Allah! Bestow upon me Your help, Your support, Your</p>  
<p>grace and Your bounties. Bestow upon me the love of Your meeting,</p>  
<p>grant me success by Your help, that I taste it in my heart and I have the</p>  
<p>desire to change my companions because You are attentive and</p>  
<p>listening to me and my companions; and no affair of mine is hidden from</p>  
<p>You. O Allah! I ask from You the help which You have bestowed on Your</p>  
<p>Prophets by which they differentiated between truth and falsehood, by</p>  
<p>which religion was perfected and Your Proof (Holy Prophet) was</p>  
<p>successful. O the one Who is with me at all the places!</p>
