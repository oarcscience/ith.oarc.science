His supplication for the tenth of the month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O my Allah! Many were the things to which I was inattentive, but You

created awareness in me. Thus You made it easy for me to draw

benefits therefrom and removed the ill effects thereof and saved me from

total deprivations therefrom. Without myself knowing it, You protected

me. There is no power or might but You. So praise be to You for Your

kindness and favours. O Allah! Many, many were the matters of which I

was unaware, but You guided me, corrected my ideas about them,

favoured me with good insight, made me successful in my aims and

made help available to me, so praise be to You beyond all measures, O

Lord of the Worlds! O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) the Ummi

Prophet, agreeable, pleased, holy, pious, blessed, clean, sacrosanct,

guarding against evil, pure and faithful and also bless his holy and

virtuous progeny as You blessed Ibrahim (a.s.) and his children. Verily

You are Praiseworthy and sublime. O Allah! I beseech You in the name

of all Your attributes to bestow Your Blessings on Muhammad, Your

prophet and his Progeny and to kindly forgive all my sins whether past

or present, big or small, open or secret, known or unknown to me which

You have reckoned with but I have forgotten. O Allah! O Allah! O the

Beneficent! O the Beneficent! O the Merciful! O the Merciful! Hallowed

are You O Allah! with Your praise. There is no god save You. I ask Your

forgiveness and turn penitent towards You. You are my Allah, the place

to lodge all complaints and for all needs. You have commanded Your

bondsmen to invoke You and You have promised to accept the same,

Verily You are ever Nigh and ready Answerer. O my Allah! Hallowed are

You. You are with all praise: and there is no god except You. How lofty

is Your name amidst the dwellers of Heavens and how Praiseworthy are

Your deeds amongst the inhabitants of the Earth! How profusely are

Your bounties diffused on the earth and in the Oceans! O Allah! praise

be to You. There is no god save You. I seek forgiveness from You and

turn penitent to You. You are affectionate and to You one should turn
for

help. You caused the rain to fall from the clouds and bestow livelihood.

You distribute the sustenance, decide about the ages, bestow upon

mankind their requirements, irrigate the land, grow the fruits. You are
the

possessor of great blessings. O Allah! Praise be to You. There is no

God beside You. I seek mercy and turn penitent towards You. You are

hearer of complaints and the object of our inclination. You cause the
rain

to fall. The thunder and the angles glorify You with praise out of fear
for

You. The Arsh, the low columns of the sky, the winds, things in between

them and below, under the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars,

illuminations, the darkness, the light, the shadow, pleasant shades of

Heaven and the heat of the Hell, all praise You. Glory be to You. You

set the mountains in motion and blow that winds. Hallowed are You.

There is no god save You and I seek Your pardon and to You I turn

penitent. Hallowed are You. I beseech You for the sake of Your

reverential name, in the name of the establishers of Your Arsh, those in

Your Heavens and Earth, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, the

darkness, the turbulent seas, those in the abyss, and those between the

east and west. Glory be to You. O Allah! Praise be to You. There is no

god save You. I seek forgiveness and turn penitent to You. Glory be to

You. There is no God except You. I pray to You for the grant of my

solicitations and for enabling me to thank You in weal and woe. Glory be

to You for There is no god save You. When You glanced at the skies,

their layers became solidified and when You glanced at the pillars of
the

earth, their ends trembled. Glory be to You. When You looked at what is

in the oceans and their storms, they began foaming. You are Glorified.

All this happened because of fear and awe from You. You are Holy. You

glance at East and West and at what is between them in the

atmosphere, which You are encompassing, made them submit with

humility towards the glory of the most glorious face of Yours. Glory be
to

You for there was none to help You in raising the skies and in

establishing Your sublime Authority. Glory be to You for there was none

present when You spread and stretched forth the earth, and then made

it a resting place. Who can excel You in Your powers? None. Glory be to

You. Who was there to have seen You when You established the

mountains and blessed Your creatures by making them strong and firm?

None. Glory be to You. Who was there to have helped You when You

set the seas in motion surrounding the earth? None. Hallowed are You.

There is no god save You. Praise be to You. There is nothing that can

be Your equal or rival. There is nothing that can escape from You or can

get rid of Your powers. O Allah! Glory be to You. There is no god beside

You. When my insight thinks of Your awe the eyes weep on the

unawareness of my heart. Glory be to You. How great is Your

forbearance, how nicely Your order is in force and how beautiful is the

creation created by You! Glory be to You! There is no god save You.

None can reach the limit of Your praise or the essence of Your reality,
or

know the extent of Your realm. Glory be to You. In Your presence eyes

become bewildered and hearts get filled with fright of You and are

awe-struck with Your grandeur. Glory be to You O Allah! There is no

god save You. Praise be to You. How forbearing! How Just, and how

Compassionate and Merciful! And how Great Listener and what an

All-knowing You are. Glory be to You! There is no god but You.

Disappoint me not of Your mercy and take me not to task. I beseech

Your mercy. O the Lord of the Worlds, Grant this Prayer!
