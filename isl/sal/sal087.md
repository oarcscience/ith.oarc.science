\(86\)

His supplication when leaving for a journey

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I seek refuge from undergoing the hardships of travels, and

from the bad condition of my family. O Allah! You be my companion in

my journey and my leader in my family and both these things are found

in nobody except You, because he who is left to guard the house cannot

accompany, and he who is a companion cannot be expected to guard

the house.
