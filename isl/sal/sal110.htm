<p>His supplication recited standing in Watr</p>  
<p>prayer.</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O my Lord! I am a sinner, I have done oppression on my self, and</p>  
<p>whatever I have done is wrong, now both these hands are presented for</p>  
<p>punishment, and the neck is bowed down due to my sins and now I have</p>  
<p>presented myself in Your presence. So for my sake snatch away the</p>  
<p>happiness from me, so that You love my actions and then I never repeat</p>  
<p>such deeds again. (Then recite 300 times) 'Al-Afw' (forgive me) then say</p>  
<p>- O Allah pardon me, have Mercy on me, accept my repentance, as You</p>  
<p>are the only one to accept repentance and bestow Mercy.</p>
