His supplication for the twenty-first of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Make me of those who believe in the Unseen, establish prayer

and give in charity of that which You have bestowed on them. Guide me

to the right path. Reckon me as one of those who have received

guidance from You. Teach me those words which You taught to Adam

whereby his repentance was granted. Doubtlessly You are Beneficent

and Merciful. O Allah! Reckon me amongst those who establish prayer,

and pay Zakat. Regard me as one of those humble people who seek

Your help with patience and prayers. Reckon me amongst those who

have no fear and grief. O Allah! Take me as one of those who act with

patience and when any calamity befalls them, they say: Verily we are

from Allah and to Him we shall return. Send Your Blessings and Peace

on me and reckon me amongst those who have been guided aright. O

Allah! Keep me steadfast in my belief in the life here as well as in the
life

of Hereafter and reckon me not amongst the unjust one. O Allah!

Regard me as one of those whom the angels take away from this world

in a good state and the Angels while receiving them will say: Peace be

on You; enter you the garden of Paradise for what you were doing.

Make me one of those who have shown patience and who put their trust

in Allah. O Allah! Grant me good in this world and good in the
Hereafter,

save me from the torment of the Hell-fire and regard me as one of those

who guarded themselves and as one of the virtuous ones. Glory be to

You, verily I was of the unjust ones. Accept my invocation and save me

from the Hell-fire, O the Most Merciful! O Allah! Make me one of the

virtuous who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts get thrilled with
awe

of His Glory and remain steadfast on what befalls them and the

establishers of prayers and of what we have provided them with they

spend benevolently. O Allah! Make me one of those who in their prayers

are humble, and who keep themselves aloof from what is vain, and

those who act for purification, and those who guard their private parts

except from their wives, or those whom their right hands possess for

them. Reckon me amongst those who keep their trust, verily they are not

blamable. O Allah! And make me one of those who keep well their trust,

and honour their promises and those who take care of the regularity in

their prayers. O Allah! Make me of those who are the heirs who inherit

Paradise; they shall abide therein and those who are afraid of Your
fear.

O Allah! You have included me amongst those who believe in Your

sings and of those who associate not anything with their Lord. O Allah!

You therefore include me also amongst those who give in charity while

their hearts thrilled for fear that to their Lord they must return. O
Allah!

Make me of those who hasten to good things and they are the foremost

to attain them. O Allah! Include me in Your party, verily Your party,
shall

alone be successful. O Allah! Include me in Your army, verily Your army

shall be the victorious one. O Allah! Provide me to quaff of pure drink

which shall be sealed to others, the seal being of Musk. For that may

aspire all those who wish to aspire for bliss. O Allah! Grant me a drink

from Tasneem, a spring in Paradise, from which will drink those who

enjoy nearness to You. O Allah! I am of the unjust ones, if You do not

forgive me and be Merciful to me, surely I will be of the losers. O
Allah!

Grant me happiness after hardships and bestow on me an unending

recompense. O our Lord! We have indeed heard the voice of an

announcer calling us to faith saying: Believe you in Your Lord! And we

did believe. O our Lord! Therefore forgive us then our sins and remove

away from us our evil deeds, and cause us to die with the virtuous ones.

O our Lord! Give us what You promised us through Your Messenger

and disgrace us not on the day of resurrection. Verily You do not break

Your promise. O Allah! Raise me to a higher rank and increase my

lawful sustenance. O Allah! Make me of those who fulfill the covenant

with You, and break not their pledge and of those who establish what

Allah has bidden to be established, and they fear their Lord and dread

the terrible reckoning. O Allah! Make me of those who are forbearing

amidst trials seeking the pleasure of their Lord, and establish prayer
and

spend benevolently of what You have provided them with secretly and

openly, and they turn away evil with good, for them is the happy

attainment of the eternal abode. O our Lord! Grant us good in this world

and good in the Hereafter and save us from the torment of he Hellfire.
