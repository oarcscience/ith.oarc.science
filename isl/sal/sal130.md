His supplication for the sixth of the month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O God! Praise be to You in a manner that might bring me closer to Your

pleasure and enable me to offer thanks to You thereby making myself

more deserving of Your bounties. Praise be to You for You grant mercy

despite having knowledge of our sins and praise be to You for Your

pardon despite having power to punish. O Allah! Praise be to You as

You have bestowed on us Your bounties after bounties. Praise be to

You for selecting Islam as religion for us and praise be to You for

bestowing the Holy Quran. Praise be to You for favouring us with wealth

and offspring as well as granting us pardon. Praise be to You in times
of

hardship and those of comfort, during affluence as well stringency and

under all conditions. O Allah! Praise be to You as You deserve; in the

manner that is befitting Your glorious Countenance. O my Lord! Praise

be to You as numerous as are the numbers of hair, of leaves and trees,

of pebbles and bricks, of the particles of the desert sand, of the days
of

this world, of Hereafter and the stars of the Heaven. O my Allah! We

thank You for what You have done for us. Praise be to You for every

command You issue when You intend anything and say, to it "Be", it

takes shape. Praise be to Allah Who forgets him not who remembers

Him. Praise be to Allah for He disappoints him not who invokes Him.

Allah that who entrusts Him is not entrusted to anyone beside Him for

support. Praise be to Allah Who grants goodness in return of goodness

and deliverance in return of patience. Praise be to Allah Who wards off

when I seek his protection although I may be advancing towards things

that are harmful to me. Praise be to Allah Who succours me when I seek

His help. O Allah! Praise be to Allah that when I call Him, He responds;

and when I seek His aid, He helps me. Praise be to Allah that when I ask

him, He bestows His favours despite my miserliness at His call for loan.

Praise be to Allah Whom I call whenever I wish for the fulfillment of my

needs. Praise be to Allah Who shows absolute mercy towards me as if I

have no sinful deeds. Praise be to Allah Who shows love towards me.

Praise be to Allah Who has not entrusted me to ordinary people

otherwise they would have put me to disgrace. Praise be to Allah Who

has favoured us by sending His Messenger, Muhammad (s.a.w.a.). All

praise be to Allah Who carried us in the land and on the sea and

provided us with sustenance of good things and exalted us by several

degrees over most of those whom He has created by degree of

exaltation. Praise be to Allah Who dispelled our fears. Praise be to

satiation in hunger. All praise be to Allah Who overlooked our faults.

Who secured us against fear. Praise be to Allah Who disgraced our

enemies. Praise be to Allah Who caused affection between our hearts.

All praise be to Allah Who is the Master of the Realm and Guardian of

the ship. Praise be to Allah Who disperses the winds and cleaves the

dawn and Who is the most High and Overwhelming. All praise be to

Allah Who being hidden is All-knowing. Praise be to Allah Who is

encompassing everything through His Knowledge and takes account of

everything. Praise to be to Allah Whose powerful insight pervades

through everything. Praise be to Allah Whose knowledge embraces

everything and for Whom is meant all dignified praise and exalted

beautiful names. All praise be to Allah from Whose command there is no

escape. Praise be to Allah from Whom there is no place of refuge; rather

to Him is the return and reward. Praise be to Allah Who never becomes

unmindful of anything, nothing engages Him. Glory be to Allah from

Whom neither fortresses can protect nor the walls can hide nor the

oceans can carry afar from them and everything will have to return to

Him. All praise be to Allah Whose promise is firm. Whose devotee is

helped and He alone defeats the armies. Praise be to Allah Who gives

life to the dead and puts to death those alive and Who is Powerful over

everything. Praise be to Allah for His plentiful bestowal. Whose

decisions are final and Whose boons are outstripping. Praise be to

Allah, the Lord of the Earth and the Heavens, Who is deserving the

praise most amongst all those that are Praiseworthy and deserving the

honour most amidst all honourable. Praise be to Allah Whose Might

wanes not. O my Lord! All praise be to You in the Night when it spreads.

All praise be to You in the day when the sun shines. Praise be to You in

this world and in the Hereafter. Praise be to You high up in the

Heavens, in the Earths below and in the lowest of the low below the

Earth. O Allah! Praise be to You in an ever increasing and endless

manner that never diminishes. Praise be to You such that always

mounts and never exhausts, that should always stay and never end, that

should be permanent and everlasting. It is You Who are praised and for

You is the sovereignty over the earth and its populace, O the Generous

one!
