His supplication to be written on the deer's

skin to avert black magic

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

In the name of Allah and by Allah, glorified is Allah in the name of
Allah

and there is no power or strength except Allah the most High, the Great.

Moosa (a.s.) said to them: What you have brought is deception, surely

Allah will make it naught; surely Allah does not make the work of

mischief-makers to thrive. And Allah will show the truth to be the truth
by

His words, though the guilty may be averse (to it). So the truth was

established, and what they did became null. Thus they were vanquished

there, and they went back abased. (Surah Yunus: 81-82, Surah Araaf:

118-119)
