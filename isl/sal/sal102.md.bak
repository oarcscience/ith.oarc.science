\(101\)

His supplication recited after entering the

mosque and before commencing the

prayers

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O the one Whom everything in the Heavens and the Earth questions,

and Who is in the same condition all the time. O Allah! By Your power

listen to my request and in this condition grant me my request. O Allah!
I

request You to free me from hell, and put Your Honoured attention on

me.

After this, raise the hands towards the skies and say: Allah is great!

Allah is great! Allah is great! Sanctified, exalted, venerable. All
Praise is

for Allah, Who has not taken a son and Who has no partner in the

kingdom, and Who has no helper to save Him from disgrace and

proclaim His greatness magnifying Him. Allah is Great and He deserves

greatness, praise, divine decree and there is no god except Allah and

Allah is great. He begets not, nor is He begotten and none is like Him.

Allah is great. There is no partner for Him and I swear by His greatness

and Honour and say I seek refuge through You from the Satan the

stoned one.

(Set both the feet on the ground put them together and without looking

here and there and with full concentration recite the following prayer
in

the 1st unit after Surah Hamd, recite Surah Ikhlas (Chapter 112) Surah

Sajdah (Chapter 32) and Surah Ha Meem Sajdah or any other Surah, or

as much it is possible, then in the 2nd unit recite Surah Yasin (Chapter

36\) then in 3rd unit recite Ha Meem Dukhaan (Chapter 44) and then in

4th unit recite Surah Mulk (Chapter 67) or any of the chapters which one

remembers when he completes the 1st unit, before bowing for Ruku, he

should recite the below mentioned prayer 15 times).

There is no god except Allah and Allah is great. Praise is for Allah,

Glorification is for Allah and for Him is the praise and Allah is
Honoured.

There is no might or Power, but with Allah, nor a place of refuge except

with Allah. Glorified is Allah, and Allah is great and there is no god
but

Allah equal to the number of evens and odds to the number of pebbles

and to the number of raindrops and to the number of complete and pure

words of Allah.

(After that lift the hand upto the shoulders then recite Takbir i.e.
Allah is

great then bow down (do Ruku) and then in bowing position recite 10

times then raise the head and recite 10 times then recite Takbir and go

in prostration and recite 10 times then get up from prostration and in

sitting position recite 10 times. Again go in prostration and recite 10

times then get up for second unit and before reciting Surah Hamd recite

the above prayer 10 times and complete the second unit as the first one:

And Allah is Great, Allah is Great, Allah is Great as he had said in 1st

unit and after Tashhahud recite this prayer):

In the name of Allah, O Allah! By the help of this prayer I approach You

attentively and sincerely. You have no partner. You are Pure and Praise

belongs to You. Those who revolt against You are liars. Complete Islam

and prayers are for Allah, O Allah make this prayer free from show off

and classify it as Pure, and chaste in Your presence. O the guardian of

the believers, bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and all Your

Prophets, then confer upon Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny a

special blessings from those blessings and grant protection to Your

special appointed angel; specially Jibraeel, Israfil and Mikaeel send on

them Your exclusive blessings. Then bestow double blessings upon

Your selected believers and friends and on all of them and also on me,

my parents and on all believers bestow Your Mercy and blessings.

(And after Salaam say)

O Allah! I appoint You as a witness and sufficient are You as a witness,
I

confess that You are my Lord and truly Your Prophet Muhammad

(peace and blessings of Allah be on him and his progeny) is my prophet

and the religion which You have fixed for him is my religion and surely

the book which You have revealed on him is my guide. And I testify that

Your promise and Your judgment is truth and certainly Your Generosity

is true and just, Your Heaven is truth and Your Hell is truth and surely

You will give death to the living and You will give life to the dead.
And

You will bring forth the dwellers of grave and will gather all the
people

on that day for which no there is doubt and no one will be exempted

from it, surely You don't breach Your promise. O Allah! I hold You as a

witness and sufficient You are as a witness for me. O Allah be a witness

that surely You are my well wisher and no one else, and You are my

Lord by Whom the bounties bestowed on me are completed. Forgive me

with such a forgiveness after which no sin is left, and Your help, after

which I don't go near the prohibitions. Grant me such an obedience after

which there is no trouble left. O Allah! Grant me such a guidance after

which there is no deviation. And whatever work is assigned to me make

it beneficial for me and bestow on me the love of it which is not
against

me. Grant me permissible sustenance in abundance, and make me

contented on it, accept my repentance. O Allah! O Allah! O Allah! O the

Beneficial O the bestower of mercy, guide me. Have mercy on me with

regards to hell and whatever differences are there in truth, guide me in

those by Your orders, surely You guide whomsoever You wish on the

right path, save me from evil and stoned Shaitan. Convey my salutations

with honour to Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be on him and

his progeny. O Lord of the Universe please accept this supplication from

me.
