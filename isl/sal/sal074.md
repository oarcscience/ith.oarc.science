His supplication in the Battlefield of Siffin

before lifting the Holy Quran on spears and

when the people did not pay any heed Ali

(a.s.) recited thus:

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I seek forgiveness from the difficulties of examination and
from

the evil designs of the enemy. O Allah! Forgive my sins make my actions

pure, ward away my sins because in front of those whom You have

bestowed power, I am totally helpless, grant me such a tolerance that

the doors of ignorance are closed, bestow on me that knowledge by

which ignorance goes away. Give me that certainty by which the doubts

are dispelled. Grant me that understanding which brings me out from the

corruptions. Bestow on me that light by which I can bring understanding

in people and can seek guidance from darkness. O Allah! Reform my

ears, eyes, intellect, heart, such reforms which remain; and which also

reforms the other parts of the body. I ask You for ease at the time of

death and forgiveness at the time of accounting. O Allah! I love all
those

actions which are dear to You and accepted by You, always involve me

in such deeds and honour me by those deeds which are close to You,

and grant me sincerity and steadiness in those deeds, after which I

continue doing those deeds throughout my life and whatever You have

bestowed upon Your pious creatures make it as a support for me, make

it in such a way that I never sell it at any cost throughout my life,
neither I

exchange it for something, in ease or difficulties, either forgetfully
or

intentionally so much so that I die in this state. Grant me a great

martyrdom in Your way; in helping You and Your Prophet. I can buy the

life of the hereafter with the life of the world and gain Your Pleasure.
O

Allah! I ask from You such a heart which is tranquil and steadfast, safe

and praying, which can understand recognition and adhere to it, does

not love evil and be away from it, neither it is a transgressor, nor

wretched nor uncertain. O the one to spread mercy. O the one Whose

mercy precedes His Wrath. I request You to let my life proceed towards

goodness and let death be a means of clearing all the defects. Complete

my deeds on martyrdom. O my supporter in difficulties, O my Lord at

times of need and O the Lord of my bounties. Make me thankful on the

bounties, patience on calamities, agreeable on destiny, trust on the

covenants, grace for protecting the laws of Islam, piety, reliance on

Yourself, relation with You, attachment with Your book, insight of Your

right, strength for Your worship, delight in Your remembrance, must be

destined for me till the time You keep me on Your earth and when death

comes make my death as being killed in Your way, and that too by the

worst of Your creatures, and my past life like those who while living

received sustenance from Your kingdom. O Allah! Bestow light in my

eyes, certainty in my heart, and fear in my soul and Your remembrance

on my tongue. O Allah! Grant me that pleasure which Your beloved ones

had when they were seeking from You and I fear Your wrath as Your

beloved ones used to fear You. O Allah! Bestow on me Your Happiness

and obedience, to such an extent that except You, I don't fear any of

Your creature and leave Your obedience. O Allah! When You grant me

bounties also bestow on me the power to thank You by which I

remember You and those bounties which are away from me. You find

me needing it. Grant me reward and patience on it. O Allah! Dispel

poverty from me in the world and let me not be unmindful of Your

worship, don't let me be away from Your remembrance, and do not divert

my attention from the rewards which are with You. O Allah! I seek refuge

from the sorrow, helplessness, laziness, cowardice, miserliness, and

bad behaviour, excess of debts, overpowering and enmity of the people,

trouble of days, evil deeds of the inhabitants of the earth, and the

intolerable things. And I seek Your safety from all those things which

become a barrier between You and me or which makes me away from

You or divert my attention from You. Or minimize my share from You and

I seek Your Protection from my sins, my oppression upon myself,

following my soul may prevent Your Mercy and Promises from me. O

Allah! I seek refuge from an evil companion whose heart even is inclined

to me, and eyes set on me, his ears are hearing me, but when he sees

goodness he conceals it from me and if he sees evil he reveals it to me,

and I seek refuge from this greed which brings us closer to another

greed. I seek refuge from the deviation, which destroys me and that

corruption which ruins me, and from that sin after which there is no

repentance and from the destruction of progeny and wealth, which is

visible at the time of death, and I seek Your protection from
Polytheism,

disobedience, prejudice and anger. And I seek refuge from those things

that makes me rebellious and from the poverty which destroys me and

from the desires which annihilate me and those deeds which debase

me, and from friend who deviate me. O Allah! I seek Your protection

from the day whose beginning is fear and end is restlessness in which

faces turn black and heart becomes dry and of those sins that seize the

good deeds which is not forgiven by You and of the sins which prevents

good deeds and with the hope which refuses good deeds, and from that

life which refrains from good death, I seek refuge from ignorance and

from vain talks, foul language and evil deeds, from that diseases which

keeps me busy, from that health which makes me forget You, I seek

refuge from fatigue and tiredness, from sorrow and hardships, from

deviation and cheating, from disgrace, poverty and ego, from doing

actions for showing off, from shame and sorrow, from revolt and

mischief, from all calamities and evil, from the calamities of this
world

and the hereafter. With Your help I wish to be saved from all
absurdities,

from the whispering of the hearts and from all those words and actions

which You do not approve of and by Your help I wish to be saved from

the Jinns, people, cheating, calamities of the day and night, from the
evil

of Jinns and the evil eyes of the people. O Allah! I seek protection
from

You, save me from the evil of the heart, evil of the tongue, evil of the

ears, and mischief of the eyes. I supplicate to You, save me from the

stomach which never fills, and from the heart which is not afraid of You

and from the supplication which is not worth hearing and from the prayer

which is rejected. O Allah! Do not put me in the smallest chastisement

and do not let me stray into misguidance. O Allah! Save me from Your

severest control, High power, Honour and Kingdom and from all the

harms of Your entire creation.
