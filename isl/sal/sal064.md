His supplication for repayment of debts

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! O the averter of sorrows. O the dispeller of grief! O the one
to

ward off the sorrow and O the one to accept the prayers of uneasy

people. O the Beneficent in this world and the Hereafter. You are my

only hope, and O the one to show mercy on everything, have mercy on

me. Shower such a mercy on me which excels every other mercy and

free me from all the debts.
