His supplication seeking refuge from

show-off

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I seek refuge from You in being with goodness among people

and my inner self is full of defects in Your presence. I conceal my
inner

self just to portray my outer self to the people but You are aware of
the

true position better than me. It is as if I show people goodness and my

evil defects are clear to You, so that I am beloved of Your creatures
and

far away from Your Pleasure.
