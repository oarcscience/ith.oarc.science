<p>His supplication for the sixteenth of the</p>  
<p>month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! There is no god save You. I ask You for the sake of Your name</p>  
<p>with which You had resolved to create seven Heavens, seven Earths</p>  
<p>and things in them and seek refuge with that name. There is no god</p>  
<p>save You, I invoke You through that name. There is no god save You, I</p>  
<p>rely on You through that name. There is no god save You, O Allah! I</p>  
<p>seek Your succour through that name. There is no god save You, O</p>  
<p>Allah! In You I believe through that name. There is no god save You, O</p>  
<p>Allah! I seek nearness to You through that name. There is no god save</p>  
<p>You, O Allah! I seek strength through that name. There is no god save</p>  
<p>You, O Allah! I express my humility through that name. There is no god</p>  
<p>save You, O Allah! There is no god save You, O Allah! O Allah! O Allah!</p>  
<p>You have no associate. O the Generous! O the Generous! O the</p>  
<p>Generous! I ask You in the name of Your Generosity, Greatness,</p>  
<p>Benevolence, Excellence, Magnanimity, Affection, Forgiveness,</p>  
<p>Mercifulness, Handsomeness, Grandeur, Excellency and Sublimity</p>  
<p>which You have reserved for Yourself for which mercy has been</p>  
<p>particularised by You. You Yourself have said: "I have blessed O my</p>  
<p>bondsman with safety which you sought from Me and I have made it</p>  
<p>permanent for you during the period I keep you alive when I will take you</p>  
<p>away from this world pleased and comfortable in a state of gratefulness</p>  
<p>for My bounties." There is no god beside You, O Allah! I seek refuge</p>  
<p>with You. There is no god beside You, O Allah! I seek deliverance by</p>  
<p>You. There is no god beside You, O Allah! I lodge my complaints with</p>  
<p>You. There is no god beside You, O Allah! I rely on You. There is no</p>  
<p>god beside You, O Allah! I believe in You. There is no god beside You,</p>  
<p>O Allah! I seek nearness to You. There is no god save You, O Allah! I</p>  
<p>love to be inclined towards You. There is no god save You, O Allah! I</p>  
<p>invoke You only. There is no god save You, O Allah! I present myself</p>  
<p>with all meekness before You. There is no god save You, O Allah! I</p>  
<p>request You only for all my wants. There is no god save You, O Allah! I</p>  
<p>beseech You in the name of Your Glorious Countenance. O the</p>  
<p>Bountiful! O the Bountiful! O the Bountiful! O the Beneficent! O the</p>  
<p>Beneficent! O the Beneficent! There is no deity save You. I ask You O</p>  
<p>Allah! For There is no god save You. O Merciful! O Merciful! O Merciful!</p>  
<p>There is no deity save You. As there is no god except You. I beseech</p>  
<p>You with all the oaths of Yours taken by You and mentioned in the</p>  
<p>opening chapter, in the hidden Book, in the scriptures of the ancient</p>  
<p>Prophets, in the Book of Psalms, in the Guarded Tablet, in the Evangel,</p>  
<p>in the Manifest Book or in the Great Quran. O the Beneficent! O the</p>  
<p>Merciful! There is no god save You. As there is no god except You I turn</p>  
<p>to You in the name of Your Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure,</p>  
<p>purified and virtuous Progeny. O Allah! Bless them. O Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.)! May my parents be sacrificed for you. I turn through you for</p>  
<p>my present needs towards Allah your Lord and my Lord the Beneficent</p>  
<p>and the Merciful. There is no god except Him. I beseech You with that</p>  
<p>name. There is no god save You. As there is no god beside You, I</p>  
<p>beseech You. O the Eternal! You have no beginning, O the Everlasting!</p>  
<p>with no end. O the ever living! Giving life to the dead. You are All aware</p>  
<p>of what one earns out of his deeds, O the Merciful! There is no god</p>  
<p>save You. As There is no god save You, I ask You with that name. O</p>  
<p>Allah! You are the One! the Unique! the Peerless! O the Most High!</p>  
<p>This name of Yours has filled the Heavens and the Earth. And I beseech</p>  
<p>You in Your name, Unique to which nothing is equal, O the Beneficent!</p>  
<p>O the Merciful! I beseech You with the name. There is no god save You.</p>  
<p>As There is no god save You, I beseech You O the Lord of mankind! O</p>  
<p>the Lord of Ibrahim! O the Lord of Muhammad bin Abdullah, the Seal of</p>  
<p>the Prophets, to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and to</p>  
<p>have mercy on me, my parents, my people, my children, my brothers</p>  
<p>from among the believers. O the Most Merciful! For I believe in You,</p>  
<p>Your Prophets, Your Messenger, Paradise, Hell, in Your raising the</p>  
<p>people from graves and Your collecting them together on the day of</p>  
<p>reckoning, Your promise, Your chastisement, Your Books. And I confirm</p>  
<p>what came from You and I am pleased with Your decree. I bear witness</p>  
<p>that There is no god save You. There is no associate with You</p>  
<p>Peerless. You are without an equal, a rival, an adviser, a spouse, a son,</p>  
<p>a like or a similitude unto You and there is none to have the namesake</p>  
<p>as eyes cannot perceive You and You are Subtle and All-aware. And I</p>  
<p>bear witness that Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) is Your Bondsman and</p>  
<p>Messenger. May Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure and</p>  
<p>purified Progeny, Peace and Mercy from Him be on them. There is no</p>  
<p>god save You as There is no god save You. I beseech You O Allah! O</p>  
<p>very Compassionate! O the Great Benefactor! O the Glorious and O my</p>  
<p>Allah! O my Master! O the Ever-living! O the Self-subsistent! O the</p>  
<p>Generous! O the All-sufficing! O the Ever-living! There is no god save</p>  
<p>You. O the Beneficent! O the Compassionate! There is not associate</p>  
<p>with You. O my Allah! O my Master! All praise with thanks be to You and</p>  
<p>all praise with thanks be to You. Kindly therefore respond to all with</p>  
<p>what I request You and have mercy to save me from the hellfire! O the</p>  
<p>Most Merciful! Bless our Master Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny.</p>  
<p>May Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure and purified</p>  
<p>progeny. Peace and Mercy from Him be on them. O Allah! Kindly make</p>  
<p>me the best of Your bondsmen in the receipt of every good that You will</p>  
<p>distribute this morning be it from Light with which You guide, or mercy</p>  
<p>which You will shower, or comfort which You bestow, or livelihood which</p>  
<p>You distribute, or the sin You forgive, or any virtuous deed for which</p>  
<p>You enable any body to perform, or any enemy whom You repel, or</p>  
<p>calamity You dispel, or any unguarded thing You turn auspicious. O the</p>  
<p>Most Merciful!</p>
