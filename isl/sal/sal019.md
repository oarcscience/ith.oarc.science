Dua seeking Pardon

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I seek forgiveness of all those sins of which You have

knowledge of either it is of my good deeds or evil deeds, knowledge of

my whole life, or from first to last, knowingly or unknowingly or the

knowledge of my sins that I have committed erroneously whether little or

great, big or small, old and new, secret or open and those sins of which
I

am guilty of. And I ask forgiveness of You and request You to bless

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and the progeny of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and

forgive all my excesses which I have done on Your creation and is in

Your knowledge because their rights are incumbent on me and I am

responsible of it. But You can forgive them as You desire. O the most

merciful of all the mercifuls!
