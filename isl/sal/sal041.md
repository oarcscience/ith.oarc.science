His supplication for fits

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O the winds, I recite the supplication, which Ali son of Abi Talib upon

whom be peace and the Prophet of Allah, peace be on him and his

progeny recited on the jinns in the valley of Sufia. So those jinns
obeyed

the commands. Then O wind why don't you obey and leave the body of

so and so, son of so and so?
