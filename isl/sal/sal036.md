\(35\)

His supplication in the first 10 days of Zilhajj

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

There is no god save Allah, in the midst of the multitude of nights and

days; there is no god save Allah, in the midst of the repeating
concourse

of the waves moving across the surface of the oceans; there is no god

save Allah, His loving kindness out balances their addition put
together;

there is no god save Allah, in the midst of the plentitude of plants and

leaves; There is no god save Allah, in the midst of countless pores and

mass of hairs; there is no god save Allah, in the midst of numerous

stones and particles in heaps; there is no god save Allah, in the midst
of

quite a many flashes of the eyes; there is no god save Allah, in the

hours of every night when darkness begins to deepen and at every

daybreak when light shines bright; there is no god save Allah, in the

midst of thousands of winds blowing over the plains and mountains;

there is no god save Allah, from today to the day of "blowing of the
horn"

(the final call).
