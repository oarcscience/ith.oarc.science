<p>(101)</p>  
<p>His supplication recited after entering the</p>  
<p>mosque and before commencing the</p>  
<p>prayers</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O the one Whom everything in the Heavens and the Earth questions,</p>  
<p>and Who is in the same condition all the time. O Allah! By Your power</p>  
<p>listen to my request and in this condition grant me my request. O Allah! I</p>  
<p>request You to free me from hell, and put Your Honoured attention on</p>  
<p>me.</p>  
<p>After this, raise the hands towards the skies and say: Allah is great!</p>  
<p>Allah is great! Allah is great! Sanctified, exalted, venerable. All Praise is</p>  
<p>for Allah, Who has not taken a son and Who has no partner in the</p>  
<p>kingdom, and Who has no helper to save Him from disgrace and</p>  
<p>proclaim His greatness magnifying Him. Allah is Great and He deserves</p>  
<p>greatness, praise, divine decree and there is no god except Allah and</p>  
<p>Allah is great. He begets not, nor is He begotten and none is like Him.</p>  
<p>Allah is great. There is no partner for Him and I swear by His greatness</p>  
<p>and Honour and say I seek refuge through You from the Satan the</p>  
<p>stoned one.</p>  
<p>(Set both the feet on the ground put them together and without looking</p>  
<p>here and there and with full concentration recite the following prayer in</p>  
<p>the 1st unit after Surah Hamd, recite Surah Ikhlas (Chapter 112) Surah</p>  
<p>Sajdah (Chapter 32) and Surah Ha Meem Sajdah or any other Surah, or</p>  
<p>as much it is possible, then in the 2nd unit recite Surah Yasin (Chapter</p>  
<p>36) then in 3rd unit recite Ha Meem Dukhaan (Chapter 44) and then in</p>  
<p>4th unit recite Surah Mulk (Chapter 67) or any of the chapters which one</p>  
<p>remembers when he completes the 1st unit, before bowing for Ruku, he</p>  
<p>should recite the below mentioned prayer 15 times).</p>  
<p>There is no god except Allah and Allah is great. Praise is for Allah,</p>  
<p>Glorification is for Allah and for Him is the praise and Allah is Honoured.</p>  
<p>There is no might or Power, but with Allah, nor a place of refuge except</p>  
<p>with Allah. Glorified is Allah, and Allah is great and there is no god but</p>  
<p>Allah equal to the number of evens and odds to the number of pebbles</p>  
<p>and to the number of raindrops and to the number of complete and pure</p>  
<p>words of Allah.</p>  
<p>(After that lift the hand upto the shoulders then recite Takbir i.e. Allah is</p>  
<p>great then bow down (do Ruku) and then in bowing position recite 10</p>  
<p>times then raise the head and recite 10 times then recite Takbir and go</p>  
<p>in prostration and recite 10 times then get up from prostration and in</p>  
<p>sitting position recite 10 times. Again go in prostration and recite 10</p>  
<p>times then get up for second unit and before reciting Surah Hamd recite</p>  
<p>the above prayer 10 times and complete the second unit as the first one:</p>  
<p>And Allah is Great, Allah is Great, Allah is Great as he had said in 1st</p>  
<p>unit and after Tashhahud recite this prayer):</p>  
<p>In the name of Allah, O Allah! By the help of this prayer I approach You</p>  
<p>attentively and sincerely. You have no partner. You are Pure and Praise</p>  
<p>belongs to You. Those who revolt against You are liars. Complete Islam</p>  
<p>and prayers are for Allah, O Allah make this prayer free from show off</p>  
<p>and classify it as Pure, and chaste in Your presence. O the guardian of</p>  
<p>the believers, bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and all Your</p>  
<p>Prophets, then confer upon Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny a</p>  
<p>special blessings from those blessings and grant protection to Your</p>  
<p>special appointed angel; specially Jibraeel, Israfil and Mikaeel send on</p>  
<p>them Your exclusive blessings. Then bestow double blessings upon</p>  
<p>Your selected believers and friends and on all of them and also on me,</p>  
<p>my parents and on all believers bestow Your Mercy and blessings.</p>  
<p>(And after Salaam say)</p>  
<p>O Allah! I appoint You as a witness and sufficient are You as a witness, I</p>  
<p>confess that You are my Lord and truly Your Prophet Muhammad</p>  
<p>(peace and blessings of Allah be on him and his progeny) is my prophet</p>  
<p>and the religion which You have fixed for him is my religion and surely</p>  
<p>the book which You have revealed on him is my guide. And I testify that</p>  
<p>Your promise and Your judgment is truth and certainly Your Generosity</p>  
<p>is true and just, Your Heaven is truth and Your Hell is truth and surely</p>  
<p>You will give death to the living and You will give life to the dead. And</p>  
<p>You will bring forth the dwellers of grave and will gather all the people</p>  
<p>on that day for which no there is doubt and no one will be exempted</p>  
<p>from it, surely You don't breach Your promise. O Allah! I hold You as a</p>  
<p>witness and sufficient You are as a witness for me. O Allah be a witness</p>  
<p>that surely You are my well wisher and no one else, and You are my</p>  
<p>Lord by Whom the bounties bestowed on me are completed. Forgive me</p>  
<p>with such a forgiveness after which no sin is left, and Your help, after</p>  
<p>which I don't go near the prohibitions. Grant me such an obedience after</p>  
<p>which there is no trouble left. O Allah! Grant me such a guidance after</p>  
<p>which there is no deviation. And whatever work is assigned to me make</p>  
<p>it beneficial for me and bestow on me the love of it which is not against</p>  
<p>me. Grant me permissible sustenance in abundance, and make me</p>  
<p>contented on it, accept my repentance. O Allah! O Allah! O Allah! O the</p>  
<p>Beneficial O the bestower of mercy, guide me. Have mercy on me with</p>  
<p>regards to hell and whatever differences are there in truth, guide me in</p>  
<p>those by Your orders, surely You guide whomsoever You wish on the</p>  
<p>right path, save me from evil and stoned Shaitan. Convey my salutations</p>  
<p>with honour to Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be on him and</p>  
<p>his progeny. O Lord of the Universe please accept this supplication from</p>  
<p>me.</p>
