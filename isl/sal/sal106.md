\(105\)

His supplication after every prayer for

protection and safety

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Glory be to Him, Who does not treat the citizens of His kingdom unjustly

and harshly. Glory be to Him Who does not let torment and pain come

suddenly upon mankind. Glory be to the compassionate, the Merciful. O

Allah! Fill my heart and mind with true enlightenment, discerning

intelligence, quick understanding and knowledge. Verily You have power

over all things.
