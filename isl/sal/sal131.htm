<p>His supplication for the seventh of the</p>  
<p>month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! Praise be to You such that it&#146;s beginning is unknown, it may not</p>  
<p>end at any stage and it does not fall short of the limits of Your Throne.</p>  
<p>Praise be to You such that it may not remain concealed from You and</p>  
<p>fail to reach You and invoke Your pleasure. All praise be to Allah for</p>  
<p>Whose command there is obedience and the disobedience in not</p>  
<p>without His knowledge. All praise be to Allah Whose justice is frightening</p>  
<p>and praise be to Allah Whose benevolence is the sources of hope.</p>  
<p>Praise be to Allah that those who obey Him receive His bounties, and</p>  
<p>praise be to Allah that those who disobey have been forewarned. Praise</p>  
<p>be to Allah that if He grants favour to anyone amongst His creatures, it is</p>  
<p>His blessing and if He punishes anyone, it is His justice. Praise be to</p>  
<p>Allah that those near Him have no escape and those away from Him are</p>  
<p>not far off. All praise be to Allah Who said words of praise about Himself</p>  
<p>and ordered that world also to do so. Praise be to Allah Who</p>  
<p>commenced His book with praise, made it the concluding prayers of the</p>  
<p>dwellers of Heaven and ended His decisions on it. Praise be to Allah,</p>  
<p>praise which has been since eternity and will remain till eternity, Who is</p>  
<p>the forerunner of everything, before Whom there was no room for</p>  
<p>anything to exist, Who is that First before Whom nothing existed and that</p>  
<p>Last after which nothing could survive. He is such Eternal that has</p>  
<p>neither end nor mortality. All praise be to Allah the dignity of Whose</p>  
<p>attributes cannot be perceived even by imagination, the human wisdom</p>  
<p>is defeated in reaching the height of His greatness, except in the way He</p>  
<p>Himself has praised the qualities of His Might, Generosity and</p>  
<p>Benevolence. Praise be to Allah Who made the sky a barrier for the</p>  
<p>Wind, spread the Earth on water and chose for Himself dignified</p>  
<p>beautiful names. Praise be to Allah Who is One without similitude, Who</p>  
<p>keeps Himself informed of everything without any media, Who is Eternal</p>  
<p>without any endeavour, Who is the Creator without any feeling of</p>  
<p>weariness, Whose attributes are His Self and Who is universally known</p>  
<p>but has not set limits. Praise be to Allah, Master of the seven skies, of</p>  
<p>the great Heavenly Throne, of the messengers and the Prophets, of the</p>  
<p>firsts and the lasts; Who is One alone and fully independent. He begets</p>  
<p>not nor is He begotten and there is none like Him. He is the King of the</p>  
<p>Kings by virtue of His own power, turned the Lords His slaves by his</p>  
<p>own might and is the Lord of great people on account of His power. He</p>  
<p>has created greatness and pride for His own Self and has reserved to</p>  
<p>Himself Benevolence, Generosity and Excellence. He is the shelter, for</p>  
<p>those seeking shelter, place of safety for the frightened, confidence for</p>  
<p>the believers and the centre for fulfilling the needs of those devoted to</p>  
<p>His worship. O my Lord! All praise be to You for all Your attributes which</p>  
<p>we know or know not. Praise be to You such that it be befitting what You</p>  
<p>have bestowed on us and You shall bestow in future. Praise be to You</p>  
<p>such that is greater that the praises of all Your creatures. Praise be to</p>  
<p>You such that can make me closer to Your pleasure and enable me to</p>  
<p>offer my thanks, thereby making myself more deserving in Your Eyes. O</p>  
<p>Allah! Praise be to You that You do not take notice of our sins despite</p>  
<p>having knowledge and forgive despite having power to punish, O You</p>  
<p>the most Forgiving and Most Merciful!</p>
