<p>His supplication for the eighteenth of the</p>  
<p>month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>I say "There is no god but Allah" as numerously as to achieve His</p>  
<p>pleasure. I say "There is no god but Allah" as numerously as the number</p>  
<p>of His creatures. I say "There is no god but Allah" as many times as it</p>  
<p>equals the number of His words. I say "There is no god but Allah" as</p>  
<p>many times as it equals the weight of His heavenly Throne Arsh. I say</p>  
<p>"There is no god but Allah" as numerously as it equals to the capacity of</p>  
<p>His Heavens and Earth. There is no god but Allah, the Praiseworthy, the</p>  
<p>Glorious, the Forgiving, the Merciful, the Deliverer from ignorance, the</p>  
<p>Guardian, the Mighty, All prevalent, the Great. There is no god but Allah,</p>  
<p>the Withholder, the Amplifier of sustenance, the High, the Fulfiller, the</p>  
<p>Matchless, the One, the Unique, the Needless, All-dominant over His</p>  
<p>bondsmen, the Loving, the Merciful. There is no god but Allah, the First,</p>  
<p>the Last, the Manifest, the Hidden, the Hearer of Complaints, the Near,</p>  
<p>the Creator. There is no god but Allah, All-forgiving, the Appreciator of</p>  
<p>thanks, the Subtle, All-aware. There is no god but Allah, the Truthful, the</p>  
<p>First, All-knowing, the Most High. There is no god but Allah, the seeker</p>  
<p>of explanation from His bondsmen, the Dominant, the Light, the</p>  
<p>Glorious. There is no god but Allah, the Exalted, the Provider, the</p>  
<p>Innovator the Contriver. There is no god but Allah, the Needless, the</p>  
<p>Grantor of reward, the Most High. There is no god but Allah, the</p>  
<p>Creator, the Sufficer, the Eternal, the Merciful. There is no god but Allah,</p>  
<p>the Honourer the Disgracer, the Excellent, the Liberal, the Honoured.</p>  
<p>There is no god but Allah, the Defender, the Beneficial, the Honourer,</p>  
<p>the Disgracer. There is no god but Allah, the Eternal, the Immortal, the</p>  
<p>Exalted, the All-comprehending. There is no god but Allah, the Succorer,</p>  
<p>the Hearer of Complaints, the Merciful, the Ever-living, Whom death</p>  
<p>touches not. There is no god but Allah, the Creator, the Originator, the</p>  
<p>Fashioner. For Him, are all beautiful excellent names. All that is in the</p>  
<p>Heavens and Earth glorify Him. He is Mighty and All-wise. He is</p>  
<p>All-compelling in His Eternity. He is Peerless, none can praise Him</p>  
<p>befitting His worth. Nothing can equal Him and none can resemble Him.</p>  
<p>There is nothing like the like unto Him. He is All-hearing, All-seeing,</p>  
<p>Subtle and All-aware. He is the swiftest of Reckoners, the Most liberal in</p>  
<p>Bestowing, Answerer of the distressed and the seekers. I beseech You</p>  
<p>in the name of Your Glorious Countenance, in the name of the Most</p>  
<p>Highly perfected Words of Yours, in the name of Your Mighty, Power,</p>  
<p>Authority and Your Greatness to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his</p>  
<p>progeny and fulfill my needs with Your mercy, O the Most Merciful.</p>
