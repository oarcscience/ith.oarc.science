<p>Dua-e-Jaameah</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>There is no god except Allah. Only in knowing Him is His extreme</p>  
<p>pleasure. There is no god but Allah after knowing Him is His extreme</p>  
<p>pleasure. There is no god except Allah with this knowing Him is His</p>  
<p>extreme pleasure. And Allah is the greatest in knowing this is Allah's</p>  
<p>greatest pleasure. Allah is great with this certainty is Allah's pleasure.</p>  
<p>Praise is for Allah in knowing it is the greatest pleasure of Allah. Praise if</p>  
<p>for Allah after knowing it is the greatest pleasure of Allah. Praise is for</p>  
<p>Allah with knowing it is the greatest pleasure of Allah. Glory be to Allah</p>  
<p>in knowing it is the greatest pleasure of Allah. Praise is for Allah with all</p>  
<p>its excellence upon all it's bounties and Allah is pure and He deserves</p>  
<p>the Praise. In knowing it, this Lord has extreme pleasure and Allah is</p>  
<p>great and true and for Him. There is no god but Allah Who is Forbearing</p>  
<p>and Generous. There is no god but Allah Who is the High, the</p>  
<p>Magnificent. There is no god but Allah Who is the light for seven</p>  
<p>Heavens and seven earths and the light of the Magnificent Throne.</p>  
<p>Recite, there is no god but Allah that no one can imagine it except Allah.</p>  
<p>He is before everyone, with everyone, after everyone. Allah is great,</p>  
<p>recite in such a manner that no one can be categorised in it. He is</p>  
<p>before everyone, with everyone and after everyone. Glory be to Allah</p>  
<p>and repeat it so often that no on can count it but Him. He is before</p>  
<p>everyone, with everyone and after everyone. Glory be to Allah recite so</p>  
<p>much that none can calculate it. You are before everyone, with everyone</p>  
<p>and after everyone. O Allah I make You a witness of my faith that Your</p>  
<p>words, are truth, for me, Your action are truth and certainly Your</p>  
<p>promises are true, Your magnificence is truth, and Your appointed</p>  
<p>messengers are truth and Your Compassion is truth, Your Paradise is</p>  
<p>truth, Your Fire is truth, Your Day of Reckoning is truth. You are the</p>  
<p>bestower of life to dead. You will raise those buried in the grave and</p>  
<p>You will gather them together on the day about which there is no doubt.</p>  
<p>You never breach Your promises. O Allah I make You a witness which is</p>  
<p>sufficient. You are my witness that You and only You is my Lord, that</p>  
<p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) peace be upon him and his progeny is Your</p>  
<p>Messenger, and a Prophet for me. And after him from his progeny are</p>  
<p>my Imams. And the religion sent by You in form of laws is my religion,</p>  
<p>and without doubt the book which You have revealed on Your Prophet</p>  
<p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) peace be on him and his progeny is light for me.</p>  
<p>O Allah I make You a witness and You are sufficient as a witness that</p>  
<p>You will be rewarding me there is no benefactor other than You. Praise</p>  
<p>is for You and it is accepted that by Your bounties the good deeds reach</p>  
<p>perfection, recite there is no god but Allah so much that only Your</p>  
<p>knowledge can perceive it and in such numbers that only Your</p>  
<p>knowledge can count it. And to such an extent that only Your knowledge</p>  
<p>can overpower it, and to such an extent that only Your knowledge can</p>  
<p>comprehend it. And to such a high level that only Your knowledge can</p>  
<p>know it. Allah is great, all praise is for Allah, Give me in such quantity</p>  
<p>which Your knowledge comprehends. As much Your knowledge is</p>  
<p>aware of, to that extent which Your knowledge can account more than</p>  
<p>what Your knowledge can estimate. I recite glory be to You so much that</p>  
<p>only Your knowledge can confine it, in that way which only Your way</p>  
<p>can know to such an extent that only Your knowledge can comprehend</p>  
<p>it. In such a quantity that only Your power can know it. There is no god</p>  
<p>other than Allah. Allah is great, Glory be to Him, and praise is for Allah</p>  
<p>and His is the Praise and Allah's position is High and Exalted and there</p>  
<p>is no power or might except Allah and there is none who can save from</p>  
<p>Allah except Allah the numbers and Power and the numbers of the word</p>  
<p>of my Lord which are pure, complete and blessed. Allah the great spoke</p>  
<p>the truth and all His messengers were true.</p>
