\(112\)

His supplication when prostrating for

thanking Allah (s.w.t.)

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O my Lord! You have refrained me from evil, but I did not stop. You had

restricted me from prohibited things but I did not pay any heed. You

covered me up in Your bounties but I never thanked You. I seek Your

Pardon! I seek Your Pardon! O the Merciful I seek ease at the time of

death and forgiveness at the time of accounting.
