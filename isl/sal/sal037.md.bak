His supplication when he was ill

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Whenever You bestow a bounty upon me, my thanks is always

less and whenever You tried me in calamities, my patience was scanty.

Then O’ the one Who never made my thanksgiving being low, and O the

one Who, when He sent the calamities, my patience was very less yet

He never deprived me of anything and O’ He Who sees me doing sins

but never degrades me. And O’ He that saw me openly committing sins

but never punished me. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny.

Forgive me my sins and grant me cure from my sickness. Indeed You

have power over all things.
