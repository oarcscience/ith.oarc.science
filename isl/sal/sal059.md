His supplication for seeking sustenance

(to be recited every morning after morning prayers)

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Praise is for Allah Who gave me the power to recognize myself and have

not blinded my heart. Praise is for Allah Who included me in the nation

of Muhammad, peace of Allah be on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure

progeny. Praise be to Allah Who has kept my sustenance in His hands

and not left it in the hands of people. Praise is for Allah Who has

concealed my defects and has not degraded me among the people.

Praise is for Allah the unique.
