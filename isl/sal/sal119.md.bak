His Supplication as taught to Imam Hasan

(a.s.)

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O my weapon during my troubles, O my Listener in my trials, O my

Helper in my bounties, O the One to make me successful at the time of

my need, O the one to give me salvation at the time of my destruction, O

the one to keep a watch over me in solitude, forgive my sins, and ease

for me my affairs. Grant me peace at the time of troubles, grant me

success in supplications, reformation in my condition and protection in

all the things which worry me. Rectify my affairs. Never take away

protection from me, whether I am alive or dead and also in the
hereafter.

By Your Mercy, O most Merciful of all the Mercifuls.
