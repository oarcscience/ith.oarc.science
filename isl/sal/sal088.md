His supplication while going to Yemen

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I put my attention on You because I do not have trust on

anyone else, nor any hope that someone will make my destination

nearer, nor any strength, which can be trusted. Nor any excuse which

can be used. Only seeking Your grace, facing Your grandeur and

seeking contentment by good ethics. And You are fully aware of all the

goodness or evil committed by me, because all those transactions,

which pertains to me, includes Your examination whatever is worth the

praise and Your Judgment is commendable. You destroy whatever You

wish and make whatever You wish and in Your control is on the source

of the book. O Allah avert from me all the calamities and misfortunes

away from me, cover me with the shade of Your mercy, grant me the

vastness of Your grace and the honour of Your forgiveness so where

You have delayed I should not prefer haste, and those things in which

You have hastened, I prefer delay and with this I pray that You protect

my family and all those who are near me in such a way that You have

protected a believer who is not present, protection from every sin,

covering of defects, forgiveness for every disobedience away from all

those things which causes Your displeasure and grant me the tawfeeq

to thank You and to have Your remembrance upon this and the best

worship and Your satisfaction on Your decree. O the Guardian of the

believers! Gather me, my children, my believing friends and those who

are under my care, consider them under Your control, such that it is not

overpowered by anyone and keep them under Your guarantee that no

one can precede, under Your protection which cannot break, under Your

curtain which never opens up, because he who comes under Your

control Your Protection and Your care, is safe and satisfied and Power

and strength is just for Allah the great and honoured.
