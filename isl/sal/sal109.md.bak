\(108\)

His supplication after completing eight

rakats (units) of midnight prayers

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I ask You by the honour of that person who has sought refuge

in You and the refuge of Your Honour rested in the shade of Your

Majesty and was familiar with Your ways and had no hopes from anyone

else. O the giver of great rewards. O the one to free the indigents, O
the

one Who has praised Himself with generosity and has named himself

"Wahab" (the bestower) and that I call on You, in fear and anxiety in

greed and success, in helplessness and freedom, in gains and loses,

standing and sitting, in bowing and prostrating, in walking and
mounting,

coming and going, so much so that in all conditions I ask You to send

Your mercy and blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny

(ask for Your needs over here).
