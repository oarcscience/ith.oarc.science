<p>(145)</p>  
<p>His supplication for the twenty-second of</p>  
<p>the month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah! Make me of those who will present themselves before You as</p>  
<p>believers who performed good deeds, and whom You will accommodate</p>  
<p>in the Gardens of Eternity beneath them flow rivers. O Allah! Make me of</p>  
<p>those who remember You and say: O our Lord! We believe, so forgive</p>  
<p>us and have mercy on us, verily You are the best of forgivers and best</p>  
<p>of the Merciful Ones. O Allah! Make me of those of Your bondsmen who</p>  
<p>walk on the earth humbly and when the ignorant address them, they say</p>  
<p>'Salaam' (Peace on you), and those who pass the night in prostration in</p>  
<p>obeisance to their Lord and standing; and those who pray, O our Lord!</p>  
<p>Turn away from us the torment of the Hell, verily the torment of it is a</p>  
<p>lasting affliction. Verily it is an evil abode and evil station. And make me</p>  
<p>of those who when they spend are neither extravagant nor niggardly but</p>  
<p>are stationed between the two extremes. And those who call not with</p>  
<p>Allah any other gods and slay not a soul which Allah has forbidden to do</p>  
<p>it, save with a right to do so, and who commit not adultery, and</p>  
<p>whosoever does this shall find a requital of sin. For him shall be</p>  
<p>doubled, the torment on the Day of Resurrection; and forever shall they</p>  
<p>abide in it in ignominy. And of those who bear not witness to what is</p>  
<p>false and when they pass by what is vain, they pass in dignity. And of</p>  
<p>those who when admonished by the signs of their Lord; fall not down the</p>  
<p>deaf and blind. O Allah! Make me of those who say: O our Lord! grant</p>  
<p>us from our wives and our offspring coolness of the eyes and make us</p>  
<p>the Imams for the pious ones. O Allah! Make me of those who shall be</p>  
<p>rewarded with high stations in Paradise as reward for their forbearance</p>  
<p>and they shall meet therein with honours and salutations. O Allah! Make</p>  
<p>me of those whom You will place by Your grace in an abode to abide</p>  
<p>forever, neither toil will touch them nor any fatigue will affect them. O</p>  
<p>Allah! take me to the gardens of bliss, to the gardens and fountains</p>  
<p>beneath which flow rivers. O Allah! Take me to the gardens of bliss, to</p>  
<p>gardens and river in the true realm of the Sovereign Omnipotent Lord. O</p>  
<p>Allah! Protect me from the evil of myself, forgive me, my parents and the</p>  
<p>persons who entered my house believing in You, and the believers men</p>  
<p>and women, and increase not to the unjust ones in ought save perdition!</p>  
<p>O our Lord! Forgive me, my parents and the believers on the day of</p>  
<p>reckoning. O Allah! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us</p>  
<p>in faith and create not in our hearts any ill will towards those who</p>  
<p>believe. O our Lord! Verily You are Ever-kind, All merciful! O Allah! And</p>  
<p>make me of those who fulfill their vows and fear the day the woe of</p>  
<p>which stretches far and wide. O Allah! And name me of those, while</p>  
<p>needing it for themselves, who give away food out of love for Him to the</p>  
<p>poor, the orphan and the captive, say: we feed you only for Allah's sake</p>  
<p>we intend not of you any recompense nor even thanks thereof. Verily we</p>  
<p>dread from our Lord, a stern day of distress. O Allah! save me from the</p>  
<p>evil of that day in the manner You save them and bestow on me</p>  
<p>freshness and pleasure and give me recompense of garden to abide</p>  
<p>and silk to wear. O Allah! Make me recline therein on exalted couches,</p>  
<p>there will neither be seen Sun, nor any intense cold will be felt. And thick</p>  
<p>trees would shade over them and the clusters of fruits thereof shall be</p>  
<p>bowing down within easy reach, and shall pass round among them</p>  
<p>vessels of silver and goblets of crystal bright as glass made of silver;</p>  
<p>measure they to a well-measure. And they shall be supplied with the</p>  
<p>drink therein of a cup tempered with Zanjabeel (ginger). O Allah! Supply</p>  
<p>me with a drink in the manner You provided them with a pure and</p>  
<p>wholesome drink, and cover me in the manner You provided them with</p>  
<p>the robes of fine green silk and rich brocade, and make me fortunate as</p>  
<p>You made them for tunate by accepting their endeavour with</p>  
<p>appreciation. O our Lord! Suffer not our hearts to perverse after You</p>  
<p>have guided them aright, and grant us from Your mercy, for verily You</p>  
<p>and You alone are the Ever bestower. And make me of the forbearing,</p>  
<p>the truthful, the devout and of those who spend in the way of Allah, and</p>  
<p>those who seek forgiveness at dawn. O our Lord! Hold us not</p>  
<p>responsible if we forget or make a mistake. O our Lord! Lay not on us a</p>  
<p>burden as You did lay on those before us, and lay not on us that which</p>  
<p>we have not the strength to bear, pardon us, and forgive us, and have</p>  
<p>mercy on us; You are our Lord, so help us then against the people who</p>  
<p>are unbelievers. O Allah! I request You to end my life with deeds of</p>  
<p>virtue and bestow upon me what I have beseeched You for, O the Doer</p>  
<p>of good deeds! Glory be to the Lord of Majesty, to Him alone is due the</p>  
<p>true prayer, and those to whom they pray besides Him give not any</p>  
<p>answer to them but they are like one who stretches his two hands</p>  
<p>towards water that it may reach his mouth but it will not reach; and the</p>  
<p>prayer of the infidels does nothing but leads far astray. And whatever is</p>  
<p>in the Heavens and the Earth, willingly or by constraint, does prostate in</p>  
<p>worship to Allah, so do their shadows at morning and evening. O Allah! I</p>  
<p>beseech You to have compassion and mercy on me, O the</p>  
<p>compassionate! O the Most Merciful. Do they not see what Allah has</p>  
<p>created that everything turns its shadow to the right and to the left,</p>  
<p>prostrating in obedience to Allah while they lie abased? And whatever is</p>  
<p>in the Heavens and whatever is in the Earth, and of the moving</p>  
<p>creatures, and the angels too prostate in obedience to Allah and the</p>  
<p>Angels pride not. The Angels fear their Lord supreme above them and</p>  
<p>do what they are commanded. O Allah! Make me of those who believe in</p>  
<p>the Unseen, and establish the prayers, and pay the Zakat, and believe</p>  
<p>in that which You have sent down, and You have revealed the Quran in</p>  
<p>Arabic with Truth; and say: believe in it or believe not; verily those who</p>  
<p>are already given the knowledge from before when it is recited to them,</p>  
<p>they fall down on their faces prostrating in obedience, and they say:</p>  
<p>Glorious is our Lord, verily the promise of our Lord was a certainty to be</p>  
<p>fulfilled and they fall down on their face weeping and the listening to the</p>  
<p>Quran increases their humility. O Allah! Make me of those on whom You</p>  
<p>bestowed Your bounties from among the Prophets of the posterity of</p>  
<p>Adam; and of those who we carried with Nuh, and the posterity of</p>  
<p>Ibrahim and Israel. O Allah! Make me of those on whom You bestowed</p>  
<p>Your bounties from among the Prophets, the truthfuls, the martyrs and</p>  
<p>the righteous ones and excellent are these as companions! O Allah!</p>  
<p>Make me of those whom You guided and chose, and of those who when</p>  
<p>verses of Rahman are recited on them, fall down prostrating in</p>  
<p>obedience and weeping. O Allah! Make me of those who glorify You by</p>  
<p>night and the day, they intermit not in their utterances of Your</p>  
<p>remembrance, and they get not tired in their devotional worship to You.</p>  
<p>They glorify You and to You prostrate in obedience. O Allah! And make</p>  
<p>me of those who remember You standing and sitting, and reclining on</p>  
<p>their sides, and ponder seriously in the creation of the Heavens and</p>  
<p>Earth; saying: O our Lord! You have not created all this in vain. Glory be</p>  
<p>to You. Save us from the torment of the Hellfire!. O our Lord!</p>  
<p>Whomsoever You cause to enter the Hell, surely You have disgraced</p>  
<p>him. There is not for the unjust any of the helper. O our Lord! We have</p>  
<p>indeed heard the voice of a crier, the Messenger, calling us to faith,</p>  
<p>saying: "Believe in Your Lord" and we did believe. O our Lord! You</p>  
<p>therefore forgive us our sins, and remove away from us our evil deeds,</p>  
<p>and cause us to die with the virtuous ones. O our Lord! And give us</p>  
<p>what You promised us through Your Messenger, and disgrace us not on</p>  
<p>the day of resurrection; Verily, You break not Your promise. Do you not</p>  
<p>see that Allah is He to Him prostrates whatsoever is in the Heavens, and</p>  
<p>whatsoever is in the Earth, and the Sun, and the moon, and the stars,</p>  
<p>and the mountains, and the trees, and animals, and many of the people;</p>  
<p>and many there are to whom chastisement has became due and</p>  
<p>whomsoever Allah abases, there is none to honour him, verily Allah does</p>  
<p>what He wills. It is He Who created the Heavens and the Earth and what</p>  
<p>is between them in six days, and then firmly established on the Throne</p>  
<p>His authority; the Beneficent; You ask about Him from the one who is</p>  
<p>aware. And when it is said to them "prostrate you in obedience to</p>  
<p>'Rahman' (the Beneficent i.e. Allah)", they say: shall we prostrate in</p>  
<p>obedience to what you bid us? and it only adds to their flight from the</p>  
<p>truth. O Allah! O the Friend of the virtuous! I beseech You to end my life</p>  
<p>with good deeds, and to accept my invocation, and grant me my request,</p>  
<p>and succour me in the affair that distresses me, O the Most Merciful!</p>
