His Supplication mentioning Isme Azam

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah I beseech You by that name which is preserved in the hidden

treasurers, which is the greatest and the most important, Proof, Truth,

Protector, Pure, which is light and is from light. It's light is with
the light,

and that light is above all lights, light filled with lights, brightness
in

brightness. That light by which all the darkness was illuminated, which

destroyed all the compellers which could not be controlled by the

Heavens or the Earth. O He through Whom the fear of a fearful can be

averted, the magic of the magician be cast away, the conspiracy of

conspirer can be void, the jealousy of every jealous be finished, the

rebellion of every rebel is stopped, in Presence of His Greatness the

mountain, the earth, the seas split open and if spoken then the Angels

protect and by it on a ship, the stormy waves cannot reach it, with it

every transgressor and enemy and disobedient devil is controlled and it

is Your Majestic and Greatest name which You have used for Yourself,

by which You are on the Holy Throne and on Your Exalted chair. O Allah

Who is Greater and the Greatest, O Allah the honoured light,

unparalleled Creator of the Heavens and the Earth. O Lord of Majesty

and Generosity I beseech You by Your Honour and Your Majesty and

Your Power and Your Abundance and by the Position of Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) and his pure progeny (a.s.). I supplicate to You by You and
by

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny that bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)

and his progeny and free me, my parents and the believing men and

women from the fire of Hell and bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his

progeny. Surely You are the Praised, the Glorious.
