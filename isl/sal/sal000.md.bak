This is an English translation for the famous book of "Al-Saheefah
Al-Alawiyah" or "The Alawite Book," which is a collection of prayers and
supplications (Duas) recited by the prince of believers and the cousin
of prophet Mohammed and his son-in-law, imam Ali bin Abi-Talib (PUH).

This translation was found, thus I did not translate it myself but it is
done by, as it seems, an Indian scholar. Thus, the terms and
abbreviations used in this translation are different from the ones I
used in my previous translations. However, the English used in this text
is far more better than the simple English I used to translate with.
Unfortunately, lot of Arabic names and titles were not translated into
English and the reader is urged to check the meanings and learn more.
Since the translator is an Indian (or a Persian maybe), thus there are
some terms that are not indeed Arabic, like the word "Namaz" which means
"prayer" and other words.

This book is considered as if it is the first volume of another book.
The other one is called "Al-Saheefah Al-Sajjadiyah" or "The Sajjad's
Book" which is another collection of prayers and supplications recited
by imam Ali bin Al-Husain, the grandson of imam Ali the prince of
believers, who had many titles like Al-Sajjad \[one who prostrates so
much\] and Zainul-\`Abideen \[the best of worshippers\].

In this book, you will encounter many Duas and supplications, including
the famous prayer of morning "Dua Al-Sabah" and "Dua Komail" (which I
translated before, but here it is translated in a better form).

Hope you enjoy reading!
