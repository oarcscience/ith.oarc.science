Another His supplication famous as

"Supplication of grief"

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Do not make me love the things which You detest neither make

me away from the things which You love. O Allah! I seek refuge that I

agree to Your wrath or I disagree to Your wishes, or I reject Your

commands, or I mix with Your enemies and transgress Your laws. O

Allah! Make me adhere to Your laws of permissible things which bring

me near to You and make me away from prohibited things which makes

me away from You. O Most Merciful of all the mercifuls. O Allah! I seek

of You to grant me a tongue, which remembers, and a heart that thanks

You. A sincere faith and a humble body. Grant me Your love, and let

Your love be firm in my heart. O Allah if You bestow Mercy on me then

my faith is good, and if Your wrath descends on me then it is the result

of my oppression, tyranny and excesses done on myself. Neither I have

an opportunity to offer an excuse nor I think of a way to amend it. O

Allah! When death approaches me and my days are over because it is

necessary to be present in Your Presence. You will surely place me in

Paradise. O Allah! The present and the past dependents will envy me

after which there will be no repentance and after this friendship there
will

be no friends, and make my place in the Heaven, honourable. O Allah!

Clothe me with the dress of faith and honour, before the degradation

and humiliation in hell. O Allah! I praise You a lot so that my
examination

becomes easy. O Allah! Bestow upon me Your help, Your support, Your

grace and Your bounties. Bestow upon me the love of Your meeting,

grant me success by Your help, that I taste it in my heart and I have
the

desire to change my companions because You are attentive and

listening to me and my companions; and no affair of mine is hidden from

You. O Allah! I ask from You the help which You have bestowed on Your

Prophets by which they differentiated between truth and falsehood, by

which religion was perfected and Your Proof (Holy Prophet) was

successful. O the one Who is with me at all the places!
