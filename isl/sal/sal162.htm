<p>Another of his Supplication (Munajat)</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>Here I am! Here I am! You are the Master!</p>  
<p>Have mercy on this helpless creature whose</p>  
<p>refuge is Your realm.</p>  
<p>O the Owner of heights I have faith in You.</p>  
<p>Blesses is the one whose Master You are.</p>  
<p>Fortunate is the one who is himself repentant</p>  
<p>and who keeps awake at night.</p>  
<p>And mentions his afflictions to the Lord of</p>  
<p>Majesty and Honor.</p>  
<p>He neither has a sickness nor a disease.</p>  
<p>One who has collected the treasure of his</p>  
<p>Master.</p>  
<p>When he prays with fervour in loneliness in the</p>  
<p>dark nights.</p>  
<p>Allah accepts his supplications and says</p>  
<p>Labbaik. (Here I am).</p>  
<p>One of his Dua in Nahjul Balagha</p>  
<p>O&#146; my Allah! You are the most attached to Your lovers and the</p>  
<p>most ready to assist those who trust in You. You see them in</p>  
<p>their concealments, know whatever is in their consciences, and</p>  
<p>are aware of the extent of their intelligence. Consequently, their</p>  
<p>secrets are open to You and their hearts are eager for You. If</p>  
<p>loneliness bores them, Your remembrance gives them solace. If</p>  
<p>distresses befall them, they beseech Your protection, because</p>  
<p>they know that the reins of affairs are in Your hands, and that their</p>  
<p>movements depend upon Your commands.</p>  
<p>O&#146; my Allah! If I am unable to express my request or cannot see</p>  
<p>my needs, then guide me towards my betterment and take my</p>  
<p>betterment and take my heart towards the correct goal. This is not</p>  
<p>against (the mode of) Your guidance nor anything new against</p>  
<p>Your ways of support.</p>  
<p>O&#146; my Allah! Deal with me through Your forgiveness and do not</p>  
<p>deal with me according to Your justice.</p>  </div>  </BODY>
