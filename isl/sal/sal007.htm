<p>His prayers mentioning the names of Allah.</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah, You are Allah, and You are the Merciful. (These are Your</p>  
<p>names) You are the Compassionate, the Sovereign, the Holy, the</p>  
<p>Flawless, the Giver of faith, the Guardian, the Incomparable, the</p>  
<p>Compeller, the Proud, the First, the Last, the Manifest, the Hidden, the</p>  
<p>Praised, the Glorious, the Beginner, the Restorer, the Loving, the</p>  
<p>Witness, the Ancient, the Highest, the Truthful, the Element, the</p>  
<p>Compassionate, the Rewarder of thankfulness, Concealer of faults, the</p>  
<p>Incomparable, the Wise, Lord of power and glory and greatness, the</p>  
<p>Firm, the Vigilant, the Protector, Lord of power, the Firm, the Vigilant, the</p>  
<p>Protector, Lord of Majesty and Generosity, the Magnificent, the Rich, the</p>  
<p>Governor, the Victorious, the Dispeller of problems, the Giver of peace,</p>  
<p>the Restrainer and bestower of sustenance, Just by the truth, firm on the</p>  
<p>covenant, the clear truth, the Creator, the Sustainer, the Bestower of</p>  
<p>rewards, the Lord, the Trustee, the Subtle, the Aware, the All-Hearing,</p>  
<p>the All-seeing, the Rewarder of deeds, the Exalted, the near, the</p>  
<p>Acceptor of Supplications, the One to send the Prophets, the True</p>  
<p>Master, Owner of the amptitude and continuance. Alive and without</p>  
<p>decline Who has no death, the Self-existing, the Light, the Forgiver, the</p>  
<p>Unique, the Vanquisher, the One, the Self-sufficient, the One Who</p>  
<p>neither begets, nor is He Begotten, and there is none like unto Him.</p>  
<p>Possessor of rewards, Aware of the unseen powers, the first one to</p>  
<p>create (the world), unparalleled inventor, holder of the convocation</p>  
<p>visible and sustainer, one Who redresses the grievances, wards the</p>  
<p>calamities and raises the position. One Who has control over loses and</p>  
<p>gains. One Who has the power to Honour and degrade and oblige one</p>  
<p>to bestow the right sustenance, the rewarder, the protector. The One to</p>  
<p>Honour and oblige. The doer of good, the rewarder, the possessor of</p>  
<p>Grace, the bestower of life and death. The one to do what He wishes,</p>  
<p>Master of the Kingdom. You give the kingdom to whomsoever You like,</p>  
<p>and take away the Kingdom from whomsoever You like. You exalt</p>  
<p>whomsoever You like and degrade whomsoever You like, in Your hands</p>  
<p>is all good. Surely You have power over all things. You cause the night</p>  
<p>to pass into the day and You cause the day to pass into the night, You</p>  
<p>bring forth the living out of the dead, and You bring forth the dead out of</p>  
<p>the living, and You give sustenance to whomsoever You like without</p>  
<p>measure (3:25-26). The One to break the dawn, the One to break upon</p>  
<p>the seed. Whatever is in the Heavens and the Earth Glorifies You. You</p>  
<p>are Incomparable, the Wise. O my Lord! Whatever I have spoken and</p>  
<p>whatever paths I have taken in this day and night I intend to have Your</p>  
<p>will in it, so that whatever You wish may materialize and whatever You</p>  
<p>do not wish may not materialize. Ward off these calamities from me only</p>  
<p>by Your Power and strength Because there is no might or Power except</p>  
<p>that of Allah, the High and the Mighty. O Allah! By these names which</p>  
<p>are acceptable to You, bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny</p>  
<p>(a.s.) and forgive me, have mercy on me, accept my repentance and my</p>  
<p>deeds, improve my condition, ease for me my affairs and increase my</p>  
<p>sustenance. By Your independent existence make me free of wants from</p>  
<p>this world, save my face, hands, tongue and chastity so that I do not ask</p>  
<p>from anyone other than You. Make ways in my dealings and make the</p>  
<p>ways vast, as You are the Knower and I am ignorant. You are possessor</p>  
<p>of Power and I am feeble and You have power over all things. By Your</p>  
<p>mercy O most Merciful of all the mercifuls. And bless the leader of all the</p>  
<p>Prophets, our leader Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) the messenger and his</p>  
<p>progeny (a.s.) the pure.</p>
