\(109\)

His supplication recited standing in Watr

prayer.

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O my Lord! I am a sinner, I have done oppression on my self, and

whatever I have done is wrong, now both these hands are presented for

punishment, and the neck is bowed down due to my sins and now I have

presented myself in Your presence. So for my sake snatch away the

happiness from me, so that You love my actions and then I never repeat

such deeds again. (Then recite 300 times) 'Al-Afw' (forgive me) then say

\- O Allah pardon me, have Mercy on me, accept my repentance, as You

are the only one to accept repentance and bestow Mercy.
