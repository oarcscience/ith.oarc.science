\(90\)

His supplication after four units of prayer

In every rakat recite Surah Hamd once and Surah

Tauheed five times.

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Glory be to the One Whose signs can never be erased. Pure is He

Whose treasure never depletes. Glory be to Him Whose property cannot

be destroyed. Pure is He Whose help never ceases, pure is He who is

without a partner in His affair, glorified be He for whom there is no
one

but Allah (worth worshipping).
