His supplication for the twentieth of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, shower Your

Mercy on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and favour Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) and his progeny with abundance in the manner You blessed,

bestowed Mercy and favoured Ibrahim and his progeny. Verily You are

Praiseworthy and Glorious. This invocation to You to bestow blessings

upon Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, should lead us to Your

pleasure and Paradise and protect us from Your wrath and Hell-fire. O

Allah! Exalt our Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) to a praised position,

which may be longed by the people of the ancient period and the people

of the last period. O Allah! Bestow Your blessings on Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and greet them with a worthy greeting.

Reserve for him the best of merits, best of leadership and favour him

with the most honoured position amongst the honoured people. O Allah!

Reserve for Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) a remembrance worthy of fame and

reserve for him a cistern full of water. O Allah! Exalt his foundation
and

bless honour to his arguments and bless us with a drink with his cup,

convey us to his cistern and include us in his party that we may not be
of

the disgraced, repentants, complainants, the innovators, the

covenant-breakers, the doubters, the deniers, the tried one, misguided

and misguiding ones. We are pleased with the Heavenly reward and

convinced of Your chastisement. This is a special bounty from You.

Verily You are Mighty and Bestower. O Allah! Bless Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, the guiding Imam towards goodness and the

leader of virtue. O the Most Merciful! Amplify his blessings on all Your

bondsmen, in all lands, all animals and vegetables. O Allah! Bestow on

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) better merits than other merit, bounties better than

all other bounties, circumstances easier than all other circumstances,

gifts better than all other gifts, fortune better than other fortunes,
till none

of Your Creation becomes nearer to You, better in status near You,

better intercessor, more honoured before You, more distinguished in

status and intercession that Muhammad (s.a.w.a.). Grant him a life full
of

bliss, everlasting bounties perfect in merits, honoured leadership,

tranquility and pleasure in discarding the egotistic tendencies. All
this

honour granted by You to him should be matchless. O Allah! Grant

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) a Means and bestow upon him, loftiness,

excellence, eminence amongst the dominant people, love towards him

amongst the chosen ones, highest rank amongst the near ones to You.

And we bear witness for him that he preached to the people as Your

Messenger, admonished Your bondsmen, recited Your verses to them,

and established Your law, explained minutely the details of Your

behests, and enforced Your Commands, fulfilled the Covenant with You,

endeavoured his utmost in Your way and devoted sincerely to Your

worship till death overtook him. And he commanded his people to obey

only You. He himself remained obedient to You and forbade the people

from disobedience to You, abstaining himself from it. He loved Your

friend whom You desired to be love; He was an enemy to Your enemy to

whom You wanted him to be an enemy. O Lord of the Worlds! May Your

Blessings be on him and on his progeny, the leader (Imam) of the pious,

the last of the Prophets, the best of the Messengers and Your

Messenger. O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny

during the night when it enshrouds. O Allah! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)

and his Progeny during the day when it shines, and bless him in the

Hereafter and world and be pleased with him and increase this pleasure.

O Allah! Cool the eyes of our Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) through his

followers of the Ummat, his wives, his progeny and his companions and

through us, the members of the Holy House, all his people (Ummat), our

family members and one love for whom You have made obligatory on us

living or dead, cool his eyes. O Allah! Also cool our eyes by a glimpse
of

him and then never cause a separation between us and him. O Allah!

Carry us to his cistern and a drink, in his cup, include us in his group

under his banner and disappoint us not his companionship. Verily You

are Powerful over all things. Peace, Blessings, Mercy and Favours from

Allah be on him and on his pure and virtuous Progeny. O Allah! the Lord

of death and life, Lord of Heavens and Earth, Lord of the Worlds, our

Lord and Lord of our forefathers, You are One Needless, begot You not,

nor You are begotten and there is none like to You, You are the Master

of the sovereigns through Your power. You have made the masters Your

slaves through Your might. You are the Leader of the honoured people

through Your generosity and You dispersed the nobles through Your

might, and razed the mountains through Your greatness, and reserved

the Pride and greatness exclusively for Yourself. The praise and

applause became exclusively Yours. Glory and Honour are Your special

attributes. None can reach the height of Your attributes and none can

equal You in Your might. You are refuge for those seeking refuge with

You. You are the hiding place for those who want to hide, You are the

place of confidence for the believers, and the way for fulfillment of
needs

for the seekers. I beseech You to have mercy on me and to keep me firm

in my beliefs in the times of every misguiding calamity. You are the
place

for me to lodge my complaints and a place of fulfillments of my wants.

There is none like the like of You and none to equal You in Your Might.

You are greater, more glorious, more generous, mightier, loftier, more

sublime, nobler more honoured and liberal than Your whole creation.

You have praised Your own Self, O the Master of the Day of Judgment!

O Allah! I beseech in the name which is for You, and You desire to be

invoked through that name, and I beseech You through every invocation

which found acceptance with You, through which You were invoked by

anyone of Your Creation from the people of the ancient epoch and the

people of the last epoch, to forgive all my sins past and present, minor

and major, committed secretly and openly, known to me or unknown,

which You have reckoned and preserved them and I have personally

forgotten. O Allah! forgive me and be Merciful to me and turn to me

compassionately! Verily You turn compassionately towards Your

bondsman, O the Most Merciful!
