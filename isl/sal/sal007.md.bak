are acceptable to You, bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny

this world, save my face, hands, tongue and chastity so that I do not
ask

ways vast, as You are the Knower and I am ignorant. You are possessor

of Power and I am feeble and You have power over all things. By Your

mercy O most Merciful of all the mercifuls. And bless the leader of all
the

Prophets, our leader Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) the messenger and his

progeny (a.s.) the pure.
