month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! There is no god save You. I ask You for the sake of Your name

Benevolence, Excellence, Magnanimity, Affection, Forgiveness,

Mercifulness, Handsomeness, Grandeur, Excellency and Sublimity

which You have reserved for Yourself for which mercy has been

particularised by You. You Yourself have said: "I have blessed O my

bondsman with safety which you sought from Me and I have made it

permanent for you during the period I keep you alive when I will take
you

away from this world pleased and comfortable in a state of gratefulness

for My bounties." There is no god beside You, O Allah! I seek refuge

with You. There is no god beside You, O Allah! I seek deliverance by

You. There is no god beside You, O Allah! I lodge my complaints with

You. There is no god beside You, O Allah! I rely on You. There is no

god beside You, O Allah! I believe in You. There is no god beside You,

O Allah! I seek nearness to You. There is no god save You, O Allah! I

invoke You only. There is no god save You, O Allah! I present myself

with all meekness before You. There is no god save You, O Allah! I

request You only for all my wants. There is no god save You, O Allah! I

Beneficent! O the Beneficent! There is no deity save You. I ask You O

Allah! For There is no god save You. O Merciful! O Merciful! O Merciful!

There is no deity save You. As there is no god except You. I beseech

You with all the oaths of Yours taken by You and mentioned in the

opening chapter, in the hidden Book, in the scriptures of the ancient

Prophets, in the Book of Psalms, in the Guarded Tablet, in the Evangel,

in the Manifest Book or in the Great Quran. O the Beneficent! O the

Merciful! There is no god save You. As there is no god except You I turn

to You in the name of Your Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure,

purified and virtuous Progeny. O Allah! Bless them. O Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.)! May my parents be sacrificed for you. I turn through you for

my present needs towards Allah your Lord and my Lord the Beneficent

and the Merciful. There is no god except Him. I beseech You with that

name. There is no god save You. As there is no god beside You, I

beseech You. O the Eternal! You have no beginning, O the Everlasting!

with no end. O the ever living! Giving life to the dead. You are All
aware

of what one earns out of his deeds, O the Merciful! There is no god

save You. As There is no god save You, I ask You with that name. O

Allah! You are the One! the Unique! the Peerless! O the Most High!

This name of Yours has filled the Heavens and the Earth. And I beseech

You in Your name, Unique to which nothing is equal, O the Beneficent!

O the Merciful! I beseech You with the name. There is no god save You.

As There is no god save You, I beseech You O the Lord of mankind! O

the Lord of Ibrahim! O the Lord of Muhammad bin Abdullah, the Seal of

the Prophets, to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and to

have mercy on me, my parents, my people, my children, my brothers

from among the believers. O the Most Merciful! For I believe in You,

Your Prophets, Your Messenger, Paradise, Hell, in Your raising the

people from graves and Your collecting them together on the day of

reckoning, Your promise, Your chastisement, Your Books. And I confirm

what came from You and I am pleased with Your decree. I bear witness

that There is no god save You. There is no associate with You

Peerless. You are without an equal, a rival, an adviser, a spouse, a
son,

a like or a similitude unto You and there is none to have the namesake

as eyes cannot perceive You and You are Subtle and All-aware. And I

bear witness that Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) is Your Bondsman and

Messenger. May Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure and

purified Progeny, Peace and Mercy from Him be on them. There is no

god save You as There is no god save You. I beseech You O Allah! O

very Compassionate! O the Great Benefactor! O the Glorious and O my

Allah! O my Master! O the Ever-living! O the Self-subsistent! O the

Generous! O the All-sufficing! O the Ever-living! There is no god save

You. O the Beneficent! O the Compassionate! There is not associate

with You. O my Allah! O my Master! All praise with thanks be to You and

all praise with thanks be to You. Kindly therefore respond to all with

what I request You and have mercy to save me from the hellfire! O the

Most Merciful! Bless our Master Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny.

May Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure and purified

progeny. Peace and Mercy from Him be on them. O Allah! Kindly make

me the best of Your bondsmen in the receipt of every good that You will

distribute this morning be it from Light with which You guide, or mercy

which You will shower, or comfort which You bestow, or livelihood which

You distribute, or the sin You forgive, or any virtuous deed for which

You enable any body to perform, or any enemy whom You repel, or

calamity You dispel, or any unguarded thing You turn auspicious. O the

Most Merciful!
