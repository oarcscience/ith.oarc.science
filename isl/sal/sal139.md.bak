His supplication for the fifteenth of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! There is no god save You. I ask You in Your name - the

Matchless, the One, the Needless, the Unique, the Exalted the name

with its effect on everything. And I ask You for the sake of Your unique

name which has no parallel. I ask You through Your Most Sublime name

and request You for the sake of Your name - Most Glorious and

beseech You in Your name - Most Gracious and ask You with Your

name - La Ilaha Illa Hu (There is no God but He) the Knower of the

Unseen and the Manifest, the Beneficent, the Merciful. And I ask You

through Your names - the Most Holy, the peace Loving, the Saviour, the

Guardian, the Ever prevalent, the Supreme, the Great Absolute,

Hallowed You are O Allah! You are far above from what they ascribe to

You And I ask You for the sake of Your name, the Generous, the Mighty,

for You are Allah with no god beside You. You are the Creator, the

Originator, the Fashioner. For You have all beautiful names. Whatever is

in the Heavens and the Earth glorifies You. You are Mighty and Wise.

And I ask You through Your name Secret and Hidden. There is no god

save You. And I ask You through Your name with which if You are

invoked You respond and You bestow upon him when one entreats You

with that name. And I ask You through the name with which asked You

Your bondsman who had some knowledge of the Book and You brought

to him the throne of Bilquees ere to twinkling of his eyes. I beseech
You

with it and I invoke You. O Allah! You accepted the invocation, when

You were invoked with it. Kindly therefore accept, O Allah!, my

invocation for what I invoke You ere my eye twinkles. O Allah! I beseech

You with "Laa Ilaha Illa Anta" as there is no deity save You the

Ever-living, the self-subsistent. Slumber seizes You not nor the sleep.

And I ask You O Allah! There is no god save You in the name of the

ancient scripture and through the names of Yours mentioned therein and

through the invocation which finds acceptance with You when one

invokes You. And I beseech You O Allah! For the sake of Psalm-Book

(Zaboor) and through the names of Yours mentioned therein and

through the invocation which finds acceptance with You when one

invokes You. There is no god save You! I beseech You O Allah! In the

name of Evangel and through the names of Yours mentioned therein

and through the invocation which finds acceptance with You when one

invokes You. There is no god save You! I beseech You O Allah! In the

name of Torah and through the names of Yours mentioned therein and

through the invocation which finds acceptance with You when one

invokes You. There is no god save You! I beseech You O Allah! In the

name of Great Quran and through the names of Yours mentioned

therein and through the invocation which finds acceptance with You

when one invokes You. There is no god save You! I beseech You O

Allah! In the name of every Book You have revealed to anyone of Your

creation in the seven Heavens and seven Earths and the Creation in

between them. There is no god save You! I beseech You O Allah!

Through every name, which You have reserved exclusively for Yourself,

or the names with which You have apprised anyone from Your creation

or the name with which You have apprised none of Your creation. There

is no god save You! I beseech You O Allah! Through the invocation with

which Your virtuous bondsmen invoked You and You accepted their

invocations. O Allah! I therefore beseech You with all these with a

request to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his pure and purified

Progeny, O the Lord of the Worlds! And to grant me my request through

it, O my Master! Verily You are Hearer of the invocation and Merciful to

the bondsmen.
