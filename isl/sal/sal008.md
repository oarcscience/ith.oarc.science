inspired Scriptures, or Which You have inscribed in Your knowledge of

the unknown; and (I beseech You) in the name of the honored and

exalted positions of Your Throne, and in the name of the utmost extent

of Your Mercy as expressed in Your Book (the Quran) and in the name

of that which "If all the trees on earth were to become pens and all the

seven seas ink, the Words of Allah could not be fully written down."

"Verily Allah is the Honored, the Wise"; And I beseech You with the help

of Your Beautiful Names which You has praised in Your Book, saying:

Unto Allah belong the beautiful names -- so call ye Him by Them; And

You have said "Call unto Me and I shall answer You; and You has said,

"And when My servants ask something of Me, lo, I am near, and I grant

the prayer of the supplicant when he asks anything of Me, so pray ye

unto Me and believe in Me, that ye may be made perfect; And You has

said, "O My servants who have wronged yourselves, despair not of the

Mercy of Allah; verily Allah forgives all the sins; verily He is the

Forgiving, the Merciful." Therefore I pray unto You, My God, and I ask

You, My Cherisher and Sustainer, and I hope from You, my Chief, and I

crave Your acceptance of my prayer, O my Protector, even as You have

promised me, and I call upon You even as You have commanded me --

So, do unto me what pleases You to do, O Generous One! (Here the

Devotee should pray for the fulfillment of his valid desires.) And all

Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds, and the

blessings of Allah be upon Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and all His Holy

Descendants.
