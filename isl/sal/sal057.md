His supplication seeking protection from

the enemies

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Say: O Allah, Master of the Kingdom. You give the kingdom to

whosoever You please and take away the kingdom from whomsoever

You please and You exalt whom You please and abase whom You

please, in Your hand is the good, surely You have power over all things.

You make the night to pass into the day and You make the day to pass

into the night and You bring forth the living from the dead and You
bring

forth the dead from the living and You give sustenance to whom You

please without measure. Allah is great! Allah is great! Allah is great!
In

front of His Majesty the entire creation has bowed before Him. And in

front of His Honour every great thing feels humiliated. No one from

among them can reach me whereas Allah has dispersed them into parts,

their arrogance destroyed them. Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the

dawn from the evil of what He has created and from the evil of utterly

dark night when it comes. And from the evil of those who blow on knots,

and from the evil of the envious when he envies. And say: I seek refuge

in the Lord of men the king of men, the God of men from the evil of the

whisperings of the slinking (Shaitan) who whispers into the hearts of

men from among the jinn and the men. O enemies the doors in front of

me are closed for the people of future and past, now all of them are

deviated and accursed. I rebuke and scold you by the effect of the

chapters of 'Saffat' and 'Zariyaat' and 'Mursalat' and 'Naziyaat'. You
all

turn into dust, so that neither you can lay your hands on me nor on any

other believer. We would seal their mouths and their hands would speak

and their legs would witness about what they have earned. This is the

day on which they shall not speak and permission shall not be given to

them so that they should offer excuses. Their eyes will be blinded,

tongues will be tied and the neck bowed for the Creator King of the

universe. O Allah by the letter 'Meem' and 'Ain' and 'Faa' and the light
of

the body and the shining of the morning and whatever is destined for

me. O the possessor of Power, save me from the awe and fear of the

tyrants. Allah is overpowering and no one can run away from His domain

when help of Allah comes the victory is near and if Allah helps you no

one can overpower you. Allah has decided that He and His prophets will

be overpowering everybody. Without any doubt Allah is strong and the

possessor of power, whoever seeks refuge in Allah is safe and no one

can give strength except Allah the great.
