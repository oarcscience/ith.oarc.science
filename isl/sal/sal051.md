His supplication for warding off calamities

and seeking protection

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! By the means of Your light I wish to hide from my enemies. By

Your majesty and grandeur I wish to be hidden from the plans of my foes

and by Your Supreme Power I seek refuge from every strength and from

every evil power and satans. And O my Lord I seek Your bounties and

high rewards, why should I be scared of anyone when my hope is on

Allah and why should anyone trouble me when my complete reliance is

on You. I have entrusted my life and all my transactions to You. I have

relied on You at all times. O Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his

pure progeny. And cure me of my troubles and grant me protection and

those things, which want to overpower me, make me overpower them, O

the One Who is never subdued. Chain the enemy who stares at me,

every oppressor who oppresses, every jealous one and every enemy. In

the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. Say He is Allah the
one;

Allah is He on Whom all depend. He begets not, nor is He begotten. And

none is like Him. As Allah is our Lord. Allah is sufficient for us and
an

excellent guardian and a strong protector.
