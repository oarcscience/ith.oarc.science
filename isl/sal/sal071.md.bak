His supplication for victory over the

enemies

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

And there is no strength or Power except with Allah the great and high.

O Allah we worship You and from You only we seek help. O Allah! O

Merciful! O Compassionate! O the one! O the self-sufficient! O God of

Muhammad! (Peace of Allah be on him and his progeny). In Your

Domain feet are moving ahead and with the presence of heart, eyes are

awaiting, necks are stretched high, where desires are asked and hands

are lifted. O Allah! You judge between us and our nation with truth, as

You are the best of the judges. (Then repeat three times). There is no

god except Allah and Allah is great.
