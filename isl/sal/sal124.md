\(123\)

His Supplication after completing the Holy

Quran

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Expand my heart by the Holy Quran, and make me use my body

for the Holy Quran, illuminate my eyes with the Holy Quran, make my

tongue speak the Holy Quran, and give me Your grace to adhere to its

commands the whole life, for surely there is no power or might except in

You.
