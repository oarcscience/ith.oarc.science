<p>His supplication when people gathered</p>  
<p>around him</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Lord of the high skies which is hung and safe whom You have made a</p>  
<p>jungle for the Sun and Moon and the positions of the planets and the</p>  
<p>stars a place for goodness and evil and in it You have made Angels,</p>  
<p>who are never tired of Your worship. And O the Lord of the earth Who</p>  
<p>has made it a resting place for man and animals and for small creatures</p>  
<p>who are known and unknown, seeing and unseeing and for big things. O</p>  
<p>Lord of the mountains whom You have made pegs for the earth and</p>  
<p>treasure for the times, and O the owner of the moving seas Who has</p>  
<p>covered the earth like a storm. And O the owner of the clouds, which are</p>  
<p>hanging between the earth and the skies. O the savior of ships, which</p>  
<p>are used to carry profitable goods. If You make us overpower our</p>  
<p>enemies then save us from arrogance. Keep us on the right path and if</p>  
<p>You give the enemies victory over us then grant us martyrdom and save</p>  
<p>my other companions from mischief.</p>
