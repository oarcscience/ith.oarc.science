\(66\)

His supplication, which is curse for the

enemies

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah I seek Your refuge from that I abhor enmity of Your friends and
I

befriend Your enemies or I agree to Your eternal chastisement. O Allah I

pray for Your Mercy on those whom You have bestowed Your favours

and my curses on him whom You curse. O Allah grant me safety from

the one, on whose death there is happiness and the believers are at rest

and grant us something good in exchange of it, so that whatever we

know about Your acceptance of supplication, we can witness it with our

eyes, O most merciful of all the mercifuls.
