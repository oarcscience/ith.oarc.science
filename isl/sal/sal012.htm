<p>Dua-e-Mazkoor</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>There is no lord but Allah. Again there is no lord but Allah and again</p>  
<p>there is no lord but Allah and that there is no lord except Allah. As He</p>  
<p>Himself says that there is no lord except Allah as His creatures testify.</p>  
<p>And Allah is great as His creatures have testified it. And Allah is Pure as</p>  
<p>His creatures have glorified Him. And the Praise is for Allah as His</p>  
<p>Throne has Praised Him and there is no lord but Allah in the way His</p>  
<p>Throne and the things below the throne have testified it. Allah is the</p>  
<p>greatest as is testified by His throne and the things below it. And praise</p>  
<p>be to Allah in the manner as He is praised in the heavens and the earth.</p>  
<p>I mention the purity of Allah as His angels have glorified Him and there is</p>  
<p>no lord but Allah as His angels have testified it. Allah is great, in the way</p>  
<p>as the angels narrate it. In this manner the Praise is for Allah as His</p>  
<p>heavens testify it. Allah is the Greatest as His Throne glorifies and this</p>  
<p>knowledge circles everyone. Praise is for Allah in the way the ocean</p>  
<p>prays and all the things in it. And there is no lord but Allah as is testified</p>  
<p>by the ocean and things in it. Praise is for Allah in the manner the</p>  
<p>Hereafter and this world and its inhabitants praise Him. And Allah is</p>  
<p>greatest as is testified by the Hereafter, this world and its inhabitants.</p>  
<p>Praise is for Allah to such an extent by which He is pleased and is an</p>  
<p>adornment for His throne to the extent of eternal happiness and in an</p>  
<p>unparallel manner. Praise is for Allah before everything, with everything</p>  
<p>and equal to all the number. Praise if for Allah equal to His verses and to</p>  
<p>His Names, to the number of inhabitants of Heaven and Hell. And there</p>  
<p>is no lord but Allah to the extent of the verses and His Names and the</p>  
<p>inhabitants of Heaven and Hell. Praise be to Allah, to the extent it</p>  
<p>becomes uncountable by imagination or by numbers. Glory be to Allah!</p>  
<p>Purified be He to the extent which cannot be measured by strength or by</p>  
<p>numbers. And Allah is the greatest to such an extent, which cannot be</p>  
<p>imagined by numbers, strength or imagination. Praise is for Allah to the</p>  
<p>extent of stars, water in the sea, leaves on the trees and hair on the</p>  
<p>head. There is no lord but Allah to the extent of stars, water in the sea,</p>  
<p>leaves on the tree and hair on the head. Praise be to Allah to the</p>  
<p>numbers of pebbles, seeds, earth, and jinns and men. Allah is the</p>  
<p>greatest to the extent of pebbles, seeds, earth, jinns and men. Glory be</p>  
<p>to Allah to the numbers of pebbles, seeds, earth, jinns and men. I wish to</p>  
<p>praise Allah to such an extent, after which there is no praise left in the</p>  
<p>knowledge of the Lord. I say there is no lord but Allah in such a way that</p>  
<p>there is no way left for expressing the oneness of Allah. I say Allah is</p>  
<p>greatest in such a way that in the knowledge of Lord there is no other</p>  
<p>way of expressing it. I glorify Allah to such an extent and mention His</p>  
<p>purity in such a way that there is no glorification left in the knowledge of</p>  
<p>the Lord. Praise is for Allah till the end of the worship, before the</p>  
<p>worship and after the worship and there is no lord but He, till the end of</p>  
<p>worship, before the worship and after the worship and Allah is the</p>  
<p>greatest which is the extent of worship will remain before and after the</p>  
<p>worship and Praise is for Allah equal to the number of all the praises and</p>  
<p>as compared to such examples is manifold times, still this Praise and</p>  
<p>Glorification is little for Allah. He is far more great as compared to the</p>  
<p>number of all these glorification and all these are nothing as compared</p>  
<p>to Him. And I say, "There is no Power or majesty save Allah" so many</p>  
<p>times that to the extent of above mentioned things nay, more than that in</p>  
<p>reality, still it is less for Him. And Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and</p>  
<p>his Progeny to the extent of above-mentioned things. And a request of</p>  
<p>repentance and forgiveness from Allah other than Whom there is no</p>  
<p>god. He is living and Self-subsisting, this is also equal to the number of</p>  
<p>things mentioned earlier, and I request in His Presence for every sin</p>  
<p>which is present in my deeds every disobedience which I have</p>  
<p>committed, this repentance is also equal to the number of things</p>  
<p>mentioned earlier. O Allah! O the Protector! O the One to give life! O</p>  
<p>Great! O the Possessor of Power! O the Possessor of Glory! You are</p>  
<p>Pure and High from the associates of the polytheists. O Allah! O the</p>  
<p>possessor of Majesty! O the possessor of Grace! O Allah! O Lord of</p>  
<p>generosity! O Allah! O the giver of life and the Resurrector on the Day of</p>  
<p>Judgment! O Allah! O Self sufficient! O the highly praised one. O Allah!</p>  
<p>O the bestower of bounties! O the responder to prayers! O Allah! O the</p>  
<p>most knowledgeable and the present. O Allah! The Forbearer the</p>  
<p>Generous! O Allah! The clement the compassionate! O Allah! O the</p>  
<p>Concealer of faults! O the rewarder of thankfulness! O the one to be</p>  
<p>pleased by the smallest of deeds! O the Concealer of evil deeds! O the</p>  
<p>bestower of bounties in abundance! O the forgiver of great sins! O the</p>  
<p>one to do what He pleases! O the possessor of victory, power and</p>  
<p>majesty! O Allah! O the possessor of greatness! O Allah! O the</p>  
<p>possessor of Holiness and exalted! O Allah! O the High and Pure! O the</p>  
<p>Great Allah! O the ever-living Allah! O the possessor of Power. O Allah!</p>  
<p>O the one to overpower all! O the possessor of pardon! O Allah! O the</p>  
<p>One and Unique having no parallel or similarity! O Allah! O the one to</p>  
<p>increase and decrease the sustenance! O Allah! The Creator, the</p>  
<p>Sustainer! O Allah the One Who gives life! And the guardian of the</p>  
<p>Universe! O Allah the Possessor of Grace! O Allah the bestower of</p>  
<p>favours and goodness! O Allah the One to accept to good deeds! The</p>  
<p>One to have power over all things! O Allah! Lord of the desires! O the</p>  
<p>refuge for the one who seeks refuge! O the One nearer to the doers of</p>  
<p>good! O the most merciful of all the mercifuls! O the one Who hears the</p>  
<p>grievances of the grief stricken! O the bestower of bounties! O the</p>  
<p>remover of worries from the grieved! O the averter of the greatest</p>  
<p>calamities! O the light is only Your light! In it is the truth of Allah! O the</p>  
<p>Beneficent! By these names I ask of You which are perfect! O Allah! O</p>  
<p>Beneficent! I ask in these names which are mighty and wise! O Allah! O</p>  
<p>Beneficent! I take the help of these names, which are great and liked (by</p>  
<p>You). O Allah! O Beneficent! I call You by those names in which Your</p>  
<p>pleasure is included! O Allah! O Beneficent! Before everything, after</p>  
<p>everything and in the measure of everything. Bless Muhammad</p>  
<p>(s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny to the extent that no one can understand the</p>  
<p>measure except You. Bestow blessings to the extent of number of things</p>  
<p>present and to the extent of things mentioned in Your book, which Your</p>  
<p>knowledge encompasses, and deal with me by your standards and not</p>  
<p>by any standards. I seek from You the necessities of this world and the</p>  
<p>Hereafter if Allah wishes and Mercy and blessing of Allah on His</p>  
<p>appointed and chosen Muhammad who is the chief of the Prophets and</p>  
<p>on his progeny and peace be on them.</p>
