His Supplication as taught to Imam Husain

(a.s.)

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I praise You for every bounty, and thank You on every

goodness. And for every sin I seek forgiveness from You, I ask for every

goodness and I seek refuge from You after every evil and there is no

might or power except Allah, the mighty and the great.
