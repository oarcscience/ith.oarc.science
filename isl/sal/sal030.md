His supplication on sighting the New Moon

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I seek from You goodness, victory, protection and munificence

in sustenance in this month and I wish for all the goodness in the next

month and grant me safety in this month and the next from all
calamities.

O Allah make this month safe for me in which there is protection and

excessive piety and give me grace for those actions which makes You

pleased with me.
