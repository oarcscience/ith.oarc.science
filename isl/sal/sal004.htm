<p>Honour that none over power. You are possessor of knowledge, never</p>  
<p>learnt anything from anyone. You are strong and can never be weak.</p>  
<p>You are a tolerant knowing everything. You can never be ignorant. You</p>

<p>different languages in times of various needs! One thing does not deter</p>  
<p>You from another. You are the one Who will never perish and the world</p>  
<p>cannot destroy You, nor change You, nor can encircle You. Neither</p>  
<p>laziness nor sleep can overcome You. Nor can You be compared to</p>  
<p>anything. Because You are the creator of everything, there is no lord</p>  
<p>other than You. Everything will perish except You Who will remain. Your</p>  
<p>self is the most honoured than all other selves. Your remembrance is</p>  
<p>pure. Your command is above all defects. You right is obligatory. Your</p>  
<p>decision is implemented. Your obedience is compulsory. O Allah, bless</p>  
<p>Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny (a.s.). Make my affairs easy in</p>  
<p>which there is a fear of impossibility and ward away from me the sorrow,</p>  
<p>which I and the other believers fear, whose troubles I am afraid of. Make</p>  
<p>it easy for me. And save me from the calamities which may destroy me.</p>  
<p>O most merciful of all the mercifuls. O the owner of greatness and glory.</p>  
<p>There is no god but You, Glory be to You, verily I am of the unjust ones.</p>  
<p>And peace be upon Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny (a.s.) the</p>  
<p>pure and chaste.</p>
