His Supplication known as "Kalimaatil

Faraj"

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

There is no god except Allah, the forbearing, the Generous. There is no

god except Allah the Highest, the Magnificent. Glory be to Allah, the

Lord of the seven skies and Lord of the seven earths and of all that is
in

them, and all that is between them, and all that is beneath them and You

are the Lord of the great throne. Peace of Allah be on all the

Messengers and Praise is for Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
