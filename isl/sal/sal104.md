\(103\)

His supplication after every obligatory

prayer

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O the one Whose hearing of one side does not restrict him to hear the

other side and those who question Him do not put Him in fallacy and

those who seek from Him are not afraid of Him. Bestow on me Your

forgiveness and the sweetness of Your Bounties.
