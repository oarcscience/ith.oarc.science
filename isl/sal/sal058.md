His supplication for seeking sustenance

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Grant me wealth and save my honour, do not make me

dependent and degrade me that I seek sustenance from those whom

You sustain. Or I divert my hopes from Your mischievous creatures and

praise them and I am tested by these things. Although You are far

greater and above such things. Surely You have power over everything.
