<p>His supplication, which is curse for the</p>  
<p>enemies</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O Allah I seek Your refuge from that I abhor enmity of Your friends and I</p>  
<p>befriend Your enemies or I agree to Your eternal chastisement. O Allah I</p>  
<p>pray for Your Mercy on those whom You have bestowed Your favours</p>  
<p>and my curses on him whom You curse. O Allah grant me safety from</p>  
<p>the one, on whose death there is happiness and the believers are at rest</p>  
<p>and grant us something good in exchange of it, so that whatever we</p>  
<p>know about Your acceptance of supplication, we can witness it with our</p>  
<p>eyes, O most merciful of all the mercifuls.</p>
