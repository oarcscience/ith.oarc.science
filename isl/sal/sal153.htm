<p>His supplication for the twenty-ninth of the</p>  
<p>month</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>There is no god but Allah, the Clement, the Generous. There is no deity</p>  
<p>but Allah, the Most High, the Sublime. Glory be to Allah, the Lord of</p>  
<p>seven Heavens and seven Earths, and things in them and in between</p>  
<p>them, and the Lord of the Magnificent Throne. And all praise be to Allah,</p>  
<p>the Lord of the Worlds. And Blessed be Allah the Best of Creators. And</p>  
<p>there is no might and power but with Allah the High, the Sublime. O</p>  
<p>Allah! Bestow on me peace to make my life pleasant so that my past</p>  
<p>sins may not harm me, and be sufficient for me against the hardships of</p>  
<p>this world and those of the Hereafter, till You cause me to enter</p>  
<p>Paradise with Your Mercy. Verily, You are Powerful over all things. O</p>  
<p>Allah! You are aware of the condition of my heart, so kindly accept my</p>  
<p>apology. And You know my wants, so kindly fulfill my needs and You</p>  
<p>know whatever is my self, so kindly forgive my sins. O Allah! You know</p>  
<p>my desires and You know my sins, so kindly fulfill all my desires, and</p>  
<p>forgive all my sins. O Allah! You are my Cherisher and I am the</p>  
<p>cherished, and You are my Master and I am Your slave. You are</p>  
<p>Honoured and I am disgraced. You are ever-living and I am mortal. You</p>  
<p>are Mighty and I am weak. You are Needless and I am needy towards</p>  
<p>You. You are Everlasting and I will perish. You are the Grantor and I am</p>  
<p>the seeker. You are All-forgiving and I am miscreant. You are my Lord</p>  
<p>and I am Your bondsman. You are All-knowing and I am ignorant. I</p>  
<p>disobeyed because of my ignorance. I committed sins because of my</p>  
<p>ignorance. I became unmindful of Your remembrance because of my</p>  
<p>ignorance. I got inclined to the world because of my ignorance. I was</p>  
<p>deceived by the pomp of this world because of my ignorance. And You</p>  
<p>are more Merciful to me than I am to myself, and You can vouchsafe for</p>  
<p>me better than I can do for myself. You kindly therefore forgive me and</p>  
<p>have mercy on me and overlook that which You know about me. You</p>  
<p>and only You are most Honoured and Generous. O Allah! Guide me</p>  
<p>towards the most correct affairs and protect me against my own evil. O</p>  
<p>Allah! Increase my livelihood, prolong my life, forgive my sins, and</p>  
<p>include me among those who fight in Your way for religion, and replace</p>  
<p>me not by someone else. O the Sympathetic! O the Great Benefactor! O</p>  
<p>the Ever-living! O the Self-subsisting! Keep busy my heart exclusively</p>  
<p>for Your remembrance. O Allah! The Lord of seven Heavens and the</p>  
<p>Lord of seven Earths, and things in them and things in between them,</p>  
<p>the Lord of seven oft repeated verses (i.e. Surah-e-Hamd) and of the</p>  
<p>Great Quran, the Lord of Jibraeel, Mikaeel, Israfeel, the Lord of all</p>  
<p>Angels, Lord of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) the last of the Prophets and</p>  
<p>messengers, bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, and keep me</p>  
<p>independent of the employment by Your creation, and give me ability for</p>  
<p>devotional worship to You, grant me ease for worship, and keep me</p>  
<p>under Your care, bestow on me contentment, and the true belief in</p>  
<p>reliance on You. O Allah! I beseech You through that great name of</p>  
<p>Yours with which the Heavens, the earth, things in them and in between</p>  
<p>them remain well set in their places, through the blessings of that name</p>  
<p>You give life to the dead and cause death to the living, and through that</p>  
<p>name You have kept in Your knowledge the reckoning of periods, the</p>  
<p>weight of mountains and measurement of oceans. And with that name</p>  
<p>You honour the disgraced and with it You disgrace the honoured. And</p>  
<p>through that name You do what You wish and say to a thing "Be" and</p>  
<p>then there it is. And when the seekers request You with that name You</p>  
<p>grant their requests and when the invokers invoke Your with that name,</p>  
<p>You accept their invocations, and when the seekers of refuge seek</p>  
<p>refuge with that name, You give protection to them, and You remove the</p>  
<p>distress when those in distress invoke You for the sake of that name.</p>  
<p>And when the intercessors intercede with You, You accept their</p>  
<p>intercessions. And You help the criers for help when they cry for help</p>  
<p>from You with that name. And when those who present themselves</p>  
<p>before You with that name, You listen to their utterances and help them.</p>  
<p>And when the repentants come with that name, You accept their</p>  
<p>penitence. And I beseech You O my Master! O my Lord! O My Allah! O</p>  
<p>my Strength! O my Hope! O my Refuge! O my Pride! O the Treasure for</p>  
<p>my religion, my world and my Hereafter. And I beseech You with the</p>  
<p>greater of the greatest and most sublime name of Yours, and I invoke</p>  
<p>You with it for my sins which none can forgive save You, and for my</p>  
<p>affliction which none can dispel save You, and for the damage which</p>  
<p>none can remove from me save You, and for those misdeeds with which</p>  
<p>I disobeyed You and felt not ashamed at the time of committing them.</p>  
<p>Here I come therefore before You as a sinner and miscreant. Surely the</p>  
<p>earth is straitened for me with all its extensiveness. My power of</p>  
<p>discernment is lost and it has dawned on me that there is neither</p>  
<p>protection nor refuge anywhere but with You. And here I am before You</p>  
<p>in a state well-entangled by sins and misdeeds and find none save You</p>  
<p>as forgiver, nor anyone to repair my loss except You, nor anyone to</p>  
<p>dispel my harm save You. And I say what was uttered by Your</p>  
<p>bondsman Yunus when You responded to him and delivered him from</p>  
<p>his grief, with a hope to turn mercifully towards me and free me from the</p>  
<p>sins. O my Master! There is no God but You, glory be to You surely I</p>  
<p>was of the unjust ones. And I beseech You with Your sublime name to</p>  
<p>accept my invocation, and to fulfill my wants, and to hasten relief for me</p>  
<p>with Your mercy, and to change my fears into mental peace in perfect</p>  
<p>bounties, the best sustenance with affluence and residence, and keep</p>  
<p>me happy by its constant flow to me. O Allah! Grant me ability to offer</p>  
<p>my thanks to You for what You have given me, and let this be</p>  
<p>accomplished in perfect manners till You keep me alive and forgive me</p>  
<p>my sins, errors, my lavishment and my crimes at the time of death (i.e.</p>  
<p>when You take me away from the world), till You convey me to the</p>  
<p>happiness of this world and of the world Hereafter. O Allah! Under Your</p>  
<p>control is the destination of the night and day, sun and moon, and so</p>  
<p>also You control vice and virtue. O Allah! So please bless me in my</p>  
<p>Faith, world, hereafter and in all my affairs! O Allah! There is no god</p>  
<p>save You, Your promise is true and so is our attendance before You.</p>  
<p>Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and end my life with best</p>  
<p>of performances till You take me away from this world in a state that You</p>  
<p>be pleased with me. O the Ever-living! O the Self-subsisting! O the</p>  
<p>Dispeller of great agony! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny</p>  
<p>and increase for me agreeable sustenance in accordance with Your</p>  
<p>generosity for verily You have taken the responsibility on Yourself to</p>  
<p>provide me and every living creature with livelihood. O the Best to be</p>  
<p>invoked! O the Best to seek from! O the Most Liberal Bestower! O the</p>  
<p>Best centre of hopes! So kindly increase sustenance for me and for my</p>  
<p>family. O Al lah! I beseech You to wri te in the book of Your</p>  
<p>predestination, and decree of inevitable, and wise affairs which You</p>  
<p>decide in the Night of Greatness (Lailatul Qadr) and which neither could</p>  
<p>be reversed nor could be changed, my name as one of the pilgrims of</p>  
<p>Your Sacred House whose performances of the pilgrim rites are</p>  
<p>accepted, their efforts are appreciated, their sins are forgiven, their</p>  
<p>misdeeds are erased, who have plenty of livelihood, their bodies are</p>  
<p>healthy, and their fears are allayed, and prolong my life, increase my</p>  
<p>sustenance. O the Ever-present! Present prior to the presence of</p>  
<p>Everything! O the Creator of Everything! The eyes sleep, the stars set</p>  
<p>down, but You are Ever-living, Self-subsisting, neither slumber nor sleep</p>  
<p>overtakes You. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, show</p>  
<p>mercy to them and bestow Your favours on them in the manner You</p>  
<p>Blessed, bestowed Your favours and showed mercy to Ibrahim and his</p>  
<p>Progeny. Verily Your are Praiseworthy and Great. O Allah! I beseech</p>  
<p>You in the name of Your Glory, Forbearance, Greatness and</p>  
<p>Generosity, to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny , and to</p>  
<p>forgive me, my parents and have all-embracing mercy on them as they</p>  
<p>nurtured me when I was little, O the Most Merciful! O Allah! I beseech</p>  
<p>You for You are an absolute sovereign. Verily You are Powerful over</p>  
<p>everything, and happens what You will, so forgive me, my believer</p>  
<p>brothers and sisters. Verily You are Ever-kind and Merciful. All praise be</p>  
<p>to Allah Who fed us among the hungry. All praise be to Allah Who</p>  
<p>granted us safety among the frightened ones. All praise be to Allah Who</p>  
<p>made us guided among the ignorant ones. O the Hope of the believers!</p>  
<p>Disappoint me not in my expectation! O the Succourer of the believers!</p>  
<p>Help me! O the Succourer of those who seek help from You! Come to</p>  
<p>my rescue. O the Acceptor of penitence! Turn mercifully towards me!</p>  
<p>Verily You turn mercifully towards Your bondsmen. My Lord suffices me</p>  
<p>as a Cherisher better than the cherished ones. My Creator is sufficient</p>  
<p>for me as compared to the created. My Master is better for me than the</p>  
<p>servants. My sustainer is more liberal for me than those who are</p>  
<p>sustained by Him. Sufficient is He for me Who is Eternal. Sufficient,</p>  
<p>Sufficient is He Who suffices me. Allah is sufficient for me as the Best</p>  
<p>Protector. Sufficient for me is Allah. Save Him there is no God and on</p>  
<p>Him I rely and He is the Lord of the Great Throne. There is no god save</p>
