His supplication for cure from dropsy

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

In the name of Allah and by Allah, I seek refuge from the Honoured name

of Allah, by the great name and with its help. I seek refuge from all
the

blood supplying veins and from all the heat of every fire.
