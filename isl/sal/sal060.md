His supplication, which he used to recite

three times in the morning

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Glory is to Allah, the Holy king (repeat it thrice). O Allah I seek
refuge

from the declining of Your bounties, I seek refuge from Your mercy being

turned away, I seek protection from Your immediate displeasure, I seek

forgiveness from my wretched actions, I seek Your refuge from the

mischief of the day and night. O Allah! I request You for the sake of
Your

Honour, Power, Holiness and Your Power on Creation and blessings on

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and the progeny of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) (then

ask your wishes).
