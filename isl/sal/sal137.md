His supplication for the thirteenth of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Glorified is Allah the Most High, Who ordained death for His bondsmen.

Glory be to Allah Who judges with equity. Glory be to Allah the Powerful

Sovereign, Praiseworthy. Glory be to Allah the Everlasting and Eternal

and Who would increase the value of good deed for rewards while

pronouncing the judgments. Glory be to Him befitting His glorious

Countenance, the honour of His grandeur and His great rewards. Glory

be to Him before Whose greatness everything lies prostrate. Glory be to

Him before Whose power everything submits with acquiescence. Glory

be to Him under Whose absolute Realm everything is humiliated.

Glorified is He in Whose control are the reins of all matters. Glory be
to

Him Whose sanctity is evident in the earth. Hallowed is He Who

dispelled all darkness with His Light. Glorified is Allah beside Whose

religion no other religion is binding. Glory be to Him Who By His

Omnipotence fixed a measure for everything, but none could measure

His omnipotence. Glory be to Him Whose beginning is a command

beyond all praise and the end of His every Command is the Knowledge

which will never be lost. Glory be to Him Who is All-knowing, Whose

informations are independent of any material media. Glory be to Him for

Whom no secrecy is hidden Who knows the reckoning of sins and from

Whom nothing belonging to the heaven and the earth is hidden.

Glorified is Allah, Who is loving, Glory be to Him the only One. Glory
be

to the Most Sublime. Glory be to Him Who is Merciful and is not hasty.

Glory be to Him Who is steadfast and not neglecting. Glory be to Him

the generous and not miserly. It is You with Your sublimity in the

heavens, Your omnipotence in the earth, Your astounding creation in

the oceans and Your Light in the darkness. Glory be to You beside

Whom there is no god, verily I was of the unjust ones. Glory be to
Allah,
