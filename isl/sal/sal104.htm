<p>His supplication after every obligatory</p>  
<p>prayer</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>O the one Whose hearing of one side does not restrict him to hear the</p>  
<p>other side and those who question Him do not put Him in fallacy and</p>  
<p>those who seek from Him are not afraid of Him. Bestow on me Your</p>  
<p>forgiveness and the sweetness of Your Bounties.</p>
