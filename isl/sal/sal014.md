His supplication, invoking peace on Prophet

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! O the one to move the moving things, and the one to hold the

things without any support (viz. skies), O the one to shape the hearts
to

their inner instinct which has the power of goodness and evil. Send Your

abundant blessings on Your special and selected servant Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) and his progeny who will make the preceeding religion reach

its climax, and will reveal the concealed things, will proclaim the
truth by

truth, who will eradicate evil, break the power of deviation which was

entrusted to him. He fulfilled his covenant in a right way, was firm on

Your commands, was always desiring Your wish, neither he retreated

nor was there any laxity in his intentions. He was attentively hearing

Your revelations, was a protector of Your covenant, the one to

prosecute Your commands so much that for the seekers of light, it

illuminated, was a way for the deviated ones, the heart after being

involved in corruption and ignorance, found guidance. With the help of

Your signs, and clear laws he has illuminated everything. Now He is

Your protected one and the trustee of Your Guarded Knowledge, Your

witnesses on the day of reward and Your appointed one with truth is

Your Prophet towards the creatures. O Allah grant him a high place in

Your mercy, by Your grace grant him the greatest reward. Raise him in

the highest ranks as compared to all of those whom You will raise. Make

his status more holy, complete the light (of Your Wilayat) for him. In
lieu

of appointing him as a Prophet, make his witness accepted, and his

speech a delight. Make his speech decisive, gather us together in the

life’s pleasantness, at the stage of bounties, at the desire of the
wishes,

the facilities of the abodes of satisfaction of the desires, heights of

contentment and with the gifts of Miracles.
