Supplication the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)

taught him and he recited it at the time of

ending the fast

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Lord of the great light, possessor of the high throne, Master
of

the moving seas, Owner of the great intercession, Owner of the holy

light, Lord of the TORAH, BIBLE and PSALMS, and of the great Furqan

(Quran). You are Allah for the creatures of Heaven and Earth. There is

no other Lord in the entire Universe. You are dominating the creatures

of the skies and the earth and there is no king other than You. By Your

great name and by the light of Your generous face, and by Your

ever-existing kingdom, I seek from You, O the living, O the ever living!
O

the living, O the ever living! O the living, O the ever living! I
beseech

You in that name by which You have illuminated the Heavens and the

Earth, and by that name with which the earlier nations attained

salvation, and by which the future nations will achieve forgiveness. O

the living before the existence of every living and the living after the

extinction of every living. O the living except Whom there is no god.

Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and the progeny of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.),

forgive my sins, make my affairs easy for me, grant me peace and

tranquility at the earliest and keep me on the religion of Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) and his progeny. On the guidance of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)

and his progeny and on the tradition of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his

progeny. Grant my deeds a high status and worthy of acceptance, and

grant me the things which You have granted to Your pious and close

servants because I have faith on You, I have relied on You and I am

pleading with You, and have presented myself in Your presence then

gather me and my parents, my household and all pious offspring

together at one place and keep sorrow away from me, and my parents,

and my offspring and from all my children. My Lord You are very

generous unmatched Creator of the Heavens and the earth. You give to

whomsoever You wish and withhold from whomsoever You wish. O most

merciful of the mercifuls by the sake of Your mercy have mercy on me.
