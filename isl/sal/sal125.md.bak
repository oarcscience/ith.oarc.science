His supplication for the first day of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

All praise is for Allah Who has created the heavens and the earth and

appointed the darkness and the light. Yet the idolaters ascribe partners

to Him. It is He Who has created you from clay. Your span of life is
fixed

and the specified time is in His knowledge. Notwithstanding this, doubt

persists in your minds. He is Allah in the Heavens and on Earth, knows

whatever is manifest and hidden in you and is aware of your actions and

deeds. All praise be to Him Who relieved us from oppressors. All praise

be to Him Who elevated us over many of His believing servants. All

praise is exclusively for Allah Who blessed me with Ismail and Ishaq in

spite of my old age. Surely my Lord listens to prayers. O my Lord!

Reckon me and my offspring among those who are steadfast in Your

prayers, bless our prayers with acceptance and forgive my parents, the

believers and me on the day of accounting. Praise be to Allah, the Lord

of the Heavens and the Earth, and the Lord of the Worlds. He is Mighty

and Wise. It is He Who deserves all praise, for whatever is in the

Heavens and on Earth belongs to Him. In the world Hereafter, all praise

is exclusively for Him. He is All-wise, the Knower (of everything). He

knows whatever enters the Earth and whatever comes out (therefrom),

whatever descends from the sky and whatever ascends towards it. He is

Merciful and Forgiving. Praise be to Allah, the Originator of the
Heavens

and Earth. He appointed the Angels as messengers who possess two,

three and four wings. He increases in the creation whatever He wishes.

Verily, Allah is powerful over everything. There is none to stop His

blessing made commonly available to mankind nor can anyone to grant

that which He withholds. He is most High and All wise. O Mankind!

Remember the Bounties, which He has bestowed on you. Is there any

other God save Allah Who grants you sustenance from the Earth and

sky? There is no God except Him. Why then do these people level

(false) charges against Him? Praise be to Allah Who is the Lord of the

Worlds. He is living. The one Who does not die. He is everlasting hence

no diminution can occur to Him. He is the (eternal) Monarch; therefore

downfall cannot be ascribed to Him. He is Just; hence no slackness can

be attributed to Him. He is such a Sovereign Who never commits

oppression. He is sublime, and nothing is hidden from Him. His bounties

are limitless. He bestows on anyone whatever He chooses. He is the

Forerunner Who has no predecessor. He is so Manifest that nothing is

clearer than Him. He is such a Secret that nothing can equal Him in

secrecy. His knowledge encompasses everything and He has reckoned

everything with a clear reckoning. O my Lord! Bestow Your Blessings on

Muhammad and his Progeny. Let my tongue praise You! Grant me

success in my aims through prayers. Fulfill my desires and help in

achieving my goals. Protect me and bless me through these prayers.

Accomplish Your Bounties on me. Grant my prayers the Lord of the

worlds. Purify my actions so that You may have pity on my helplessness

and my complaints. I beseech You to show mercy on me. Be pleased

with me and accept my prayer. Praise be to Allah Who has created the

heavy clouds. The thunder and the Angels praise Him. It is He Who

flashes the lighting that harms those whom He wishes. The truth is clear

as daylight, yet the people believe not and argue about their God.

Whosoever is proclaimed as God besides Him is false. He is the most

High and the Great. Glory be to Allah Who raises up the souls when

men are dead. He also raises up the souls of those alive when they go

to sleep. Then He detains the souls of those whom He commands to die

and releases the souls of the rest of them for the specified time.
Surely

there are His signs in it for those who may reflect. Glory be to Allah

Whose Throne extends over the Heavens and the Earth, and the

preservation of them both tires Him not. He is most exalted and Great.

Praise be to Allah, the Knower of what is manifest and what is hidden,

Beneficent and Merciful. There is no God beside Him. He is the King the

most Holy the Bestower of conviction, the Guardian, the Supreme, the

Great. He is above what is attributed to Him. He is the Creator, Maker

and Fashioner. O Allah! Yours are the beautiful names. Everyone in the

Heavens and on the Earth praises Him. He is Ever prevalent and All

wise. All praise is for Him Who has neither any son nor any associate in

His Realm. He has no helper against humiliation. And Glorify Him,

magnifying His Praise.
