all good. He is Powerful over everything. I bear witness that there is
no

god save Allah, the One with no associate, the One, Unique, Needless,

under all circumstances forever, during my youth before old age and

during old age after youth that there is no god but Allah, the One with
no

associate. I bear witness under all circumstances forever, during the
free

period before the period of occupation and during the period of

occupation after the free period that there is no god but Allah. I bear

witness under all circumstances forever, during the performances by my

hands and when there is no performance by my hands that there is no

god but Allah, the One with no partner. I bear witness under all

circumstances forever, during the period my ears heard and when they

heard not anything that there is no god except Allah, the One with no

associate. I bear witness under all circumstances forever; during the

period my eyes saw when they saw not anything that there is no god but

Allah, the One with no associate. I bear witness under all circumstances

forever, during the period my tongue uttered anything and when it

uttered not anything that there is no god but Allah, the One with no

associate. I bear witness under all circumstances forever, during the

entry into the grave that there is no god but Allah, the One without

associate. I bear witness during the night when it enshrouds and during

the day when it shines that there is no god but Allah, the One with no

associate. I bear witness in the Hereafter and in world that there is
deity

but Allah, the One with no associate. I bear witness that there is no
deity

but Allah, the One with no associate, a witness that may be my treasure

of protection from the terror of the Day of Judgment. My witness that

there is no god save Allah, the One without a partner, is a confession
of

Truth with all sincerity. The witness that there is no god but Allah,
the

One without an associate, is a witness also my ears, eyes, flesh, blood,

hair, skin, nails, brain, bones, nerves and by everything my legs carry.

With my witness that there is no god but Allah, the One with no

associate, I hope from Allah at the departure of the soul from my body
to

keep my tongue perfect in its action of uttering words till my life ends

with good deeds. Accept this invocation, O the Lord of the Worlds!
