His Dua mentioning the Holy Prophet

(s.a.w.a.)

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

All Praise our for Allah, Lord of the worlds and peace be on the Pure

Messenger, Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) son of Abdullah son of Abdul Muttalib,

owner of greatness, the chosen one. O Lord give Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)

praiseworthy mentions and a pond (Kauthar), which is visible and seen.

O Lord bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny appoint him as an

intermediary and raise his status, and make his love common among

Your appointed people and raise his status High and grant him miracle

among Your trusted and close people. O Allah grant Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) all the types of miracles which are distinguished among them

and that bounty which is the greatest of all, and of all the givings is
the

greatest of givings and among all the eases it is that ease which lasts

the longest. And of all the distribution it is the largest share, so
that

among Your Creations no one is more nearer to You than him, and no

one is higher in status than him. Nor any right greater than him, and no

one is more nearer than Muhammad peace and blessings be on him and

his progeny. Who is a caller towards goodness who is a blessing for all

the creatures of Allah and is a mercy for entire creation of Allah. O
Allah

gather us together with Muhammad peace and blessings be on him and

his progeny in this life continued satisfaction on bounties, desires of
the

soul hopes and wishes, pleasures of the bounties, witnessing the

satisfaction, the chief of the miracles, wetness of the eyes, freshness

and perfection of the bounties, and that pleasure which has no equal in

the universe. Gather us in those ranks with Muhammad and his progeny

(peace be upon them all). I witness that he (The prophet propagated

Your message with sincerity, endeavoured for the people, bore

hardships in Your way, struggled in Your way, worshipped You to the

extent of certainty, so send blessings on the Prophet and his progeny. O

the Lord of the sanctified land, O the Lord of the Rukn and Yaman (two

corners of Kaaba), O Lord of the great mosque. O Lord of the sanctuary

of Mecca, make our salutations reach Muhammad (peace be on him and

his progeny). O Allah send blessings on all the Divine and honoured

angels, messengers, Prophets and on the angels who record our

actions. And send Your bounties and blessings on Your obedient

servants in seven Heavens and seven earths from all the believers.
