His supplication on sighting the moon of the

month of Ramazan recited facing the Qibla

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! Make this moon as a faith and protection for us in it we are
safe

and sustenance is increased and the sick are cured. O Allah! By Your

grace, grant us the power to fast, pray and recite the Quran in it. O

Allah! Make it safe for us and from our side and grant us Your
protection

in this month.
