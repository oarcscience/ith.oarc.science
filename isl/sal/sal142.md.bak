His supplication for the eighteenth of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

I say "There is no god but Allah" as numerously as to achieve His

pleasure. I say "There is no god but Allah" as numerously as the number

of His creatures. I say "There is no god but Allah" as many times as it

equals the number of His words. I say "There is no god but Allah" as

many times as it equals the weight of His heavenly Throne Arsh. I say

"There is no god but Allah" as numerously as it equals to the capacity
of

His Heavens and Earth. There is no god but Allah, the Praiseworthy, the

Glorious, the Forgiving, the Merciful, the Deliverer from ignorance, the

Guardian, the Mighty, All prevalent, the Great. There is no god but
Allah,

the Withholder, the Amplifier of sustenance, the High, the Fulfiller,
the

Matchless, the One, the Unique, the Needless, All-dominant over His

bondsmen, the Loving, the Merciful. There is no god but Allah, the
First,

the Last, the Manifest, the Hidden, the Hearer of Complaints, the Near,

the Creator. There is no god but Allah, All-forgiving, the Appreciator
of

thanks, the Subtle, All-aware. There is no god but Allah, the Truthful,
the

First, All-knowing, the Most High. There is no god but Allah, the seeker

of explanation from His bondsmen, the Dominant, the Light, the

Glorious. There is no god but Allah, the Exalted, the Provider, the

Innovator the Contriver. There is no god but Allah, the Needless, the

Grantor of reward, the Most High. There is no god but Allah, the

Creator, the Sufficer, the Eternal, the Merciful. There is no god but
Allah,

the Honourer the Disgracer, the Excellent, the Liberal, the Honoured.

There is no god but Allah, the Defender, the Beneficial, the Honourer,

the Disgracer. There is no god but Allah, the Eternal, the Immortal, the

Exalted, the All-comprehending. There is no god but Allah, the Succorer,

the Hearer of Complaints, the Merciful, the Ever-living, Whom death

touches not. There is no god but Allah, the Creator, the Originator, the

Fashioner. For Him, are all beautiful excellent names. All that is in
the

Heavens and Earth glorify Him. He is Mighty and All-wise. He is

All-compelling in His Eternity. He is Peerless, none can praise Him

befitting His worth. Nothing can equal Him and none can resemble Him.

There is nothing like the like unto Him. He is All-hearing, All-seeing,

Subtle and All-aware. He is the swiftest of Reckoners, the Most liberal
in

Bestowing, Answerer of the distressed and the seekers. I beseech You

in the name of Your Glorious Countenance, in the name of the Most

Highly perfected Words of Yours, in the name of Your Mighty, Power,

Authority and Your Greatness to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his

progeny and fulfill my needs with Your mercy, O the Most Merciful.
