His supplication when he used to fight the

enemy

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! My heart is present in Your Domain and the head is bowed

down and eyes are fixed at You, feet are trembling and the body has

become weak, old enmities are manifested; pots of malice are boiling

out. O Allah! I complain to You of the absence of our Prophet and the

abundance of the enemies, and the colorful desires. O Allah! Grant truth

a victory between my enemies, and me, as You are the best of those

Who bestow victory.
