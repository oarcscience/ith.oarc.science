\(111\)

His supplication at the time of mid-day

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

I wish to seek proximity to You by Your grace and generosity and by

Your servant and Prophet, Muhammad peace be on him and his

progeny and through You and through the angels who are near to You

and Your Prophet. O Allah, self-sufficiency belongs to You and for me is

the dependency in Your Presence. You are rich and I am indigent.

Forgive my laxities, conceal my sins, and today fulfill my desires, and

whatever sins You are aware of, don't chastise me, but put me in Your

mercy and Generosity.

(Then go in Sajdah and recite)

O the center of piety, O the possessor of forgiveness, O the most

generous for the doers of good. You are more generous than my father,

my mother and all the creatures. Pass my life in fulfilling my desires.

Accept my prayers, have mercy on my voice, You have averted various

types of difficulties from me.
