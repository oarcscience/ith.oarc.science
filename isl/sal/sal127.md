His supplication for the third of the month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

All praise be to Allah, Eternal with Constant activity, the Wise, Kind,

Foremost, Everlasting, Manifest, Hidden, the Only One, the Matchless,

Needless, He begets none nor is he begotten. There is none like Him.

Glory be to Allah Who is the real Guide, the Truth, the Justice,
Manifest,

Lord of Mighty Grace, Magnificent, Most Honoured, Bestower, he grants

poverty and affluence to Who He wishes. He is the Lord of the

invulnerable strength, Excellent and Grantor of favour. Praise be to
Allah

the Heir, the Guardian, Witness, Seer, Watchful, Listener of prayers.

Encompassing, Protector, Withholder, Opener, Provider, Giver of life

and death. The Glorious and Gracious, Worthy to be feared and worthy

to seek refuge to, the Lord of Ascents, unto Him ascend the Angels and

the Spirit. All Praise be to Allah Who is the Sustainer and Creator,

Merciful, His mercy is all embracing, Total Blessing and Absolute Proof.

Whose similitudes are most exalted and names are most beautiful.

Whose powers are invincible, the Cleaver of the dawn. The splitter of

grain seed and the date stone. He brings forth the living from the dead

and the dead from the living. He regulates the affairs of the Universe.
He

is the Cleaver of the dawn; and has made the night for rest and the sun

and the moon for reckoning time. This is the measuring of the Almighty,

the All-knowing Lord. All Praise be to Allah, the most exalted, Lord of
the

Heavenly Throne; sends forth He the Spirit at His own behest on

whomsoever He wishes of his servants that he may warn men of the day

of meeting, all good emanates from Him, Lord of mankind, Lord of

Lands. To Him is the return of all. He it is Who is at the zenith of
vision,

knows He whatever any living being earns, Forgiver of sin, acceptor of

repentance, severe to chastise, the Lord of bounty. There is no god but

Allah, unto Him is the ultimate and end of the life journey of
everything.

He is Mighty in prowess, Swift in reckoning, Firm in justice. When He

decrees an affair He only says to it "Be" and it is. He is full of good,
and

is Bestower of good as He wishes. He never disappoints him who

beseeches Him, nor puts him to shame who is hopeful of Him. Neither

His blessings shrink nor can His bounties be counted. His promise is

just and right. He is the greatest amongst all the judges and the
quickest

amidst all reckoners, Most Generous of all bountifuls, liberal in
granting

bounties but stern in punishment. His decisions are just and He alone

deserves praise. He is true to His promise and Bestower of good.

Justice is the basis of His decisions. He guides towards the true path

and leads to straight path whomever He wishes. He is infinite in His

mercy. There is nothing whatsoever the like of Him. He created the sky,

the Earth, death and life that he may try of you which of you is best in

deeds. He alone is Almighty, forgiving, handsomely praised; He tests the

believers by gracious trial. Hearer of prayers and Just in His
decisions.

He acts as He wishes and creates what He pleases. Might and Praise is

for Him. And for Him is Greatness, Pride and Sublimity. He sends down

rain, knows the "Unseen". He increases the sustenance of whom He

wishes, causes the wind to blow and raises He the heavy clouds and

regulates He the affairs of the Universe. He answers the distressed

when he calls Him, listens to the people's prayers, removes their

difficulties and satisfies the seeker. None can stop that which He

bestows nor can anyone give that which He withholds. There is nothing

whatsoever the like of Him. He is All-hearing and of All-seeing. His

names are secured. To create and to command are His domains.

Hallowed is He the Lord of Worlds. Great is His praise and all embracing

is His mercy manifested or hidden by His grace. Allah is most merciful.
