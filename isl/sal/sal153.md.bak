His supplication for the twenty-ninth of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

There is no god but Allah, the Clement, the Generous. There is no deity

but Allah, the Most High, the Sublime. Glory be to Allah, the Lord of

seven Heavens and seven Earths, and things in them and in between

them, and the Lord of the Magnificent Throne. And all praise be to
Allah,

the Lord of the Worlds. And Blessed be Allah the Best of Creators. And

there is no might and power but with Allah the High, the Sublime. O

Allah! Bestow on me peace to make my life pleasant so that my past

sins may not harm me, and be sufficient for me against the hardships of

this world and those of the Hereafter, till You cause me to enter

Paradise with Your Mercy. Verily, You are Powerful over all things. O

Allah! You are aware of the condition of my heart, so kindly accept my

apology. And You know my wants, so kindly fulfill my needs and You

know whatever is my self, so kindly forgive my sins. O Allah! You know

my desires and You know my sins, so kindly fulfill all my desires, and

forgive all my sins. O Allah! You are my Cherisher and I am the

cherished, and You are my Master and I am Your slave. You are

Honoured and I am disgraced. You are ever-living and I am mortal. You

are Mighty and I am weak. You are Needless and I am needy towards

You. You are Everlasting and I will perish. You are the Grantor and I am

the seeker. You are All-forgiving and I am miscreant. You are my Lord

and I am Your bondsman. You are All-knowing and I am ignorant. I

disobeyed because of my ignorance. I committed sins because of my

ignorance. I became unmindful of Your remembrance because of my

ignorance. I got inclined to the world because of my ignorance. I was

deceived by the pomp of this world because of my ignorance. And You

are more Merciful to me than I am to myself, and You can vouchsafe for

me better than I can do for myself. You kindly therefore forgive me and

have mercy on me and overlook that which You know about me. You

and only You are most Honoured and Generous. O Allah! Guide me

towards the most correct affairs and protect me against my own evil. O

Allah! Increase my livelihood, prolong my life, forgive my sins, and

include me among those who fight in Your way for religion, and replace

me not by someone else. O the Sympathetic! O the Great Benefactor! O

the Ever-living! O the Self-subsisting! Keep busy my heart exclusively

for Your remembrance. O Allah! The Lord of seven Heavens and the

Lord of seven Earths, and things in them and things in between them,

the Lord of seven oft repeated verses (i.e. Surah-e-Hamd) and of the

Great Quran, the Lord of Jibraeel, Mikaeel, Israfeel, the Lord of all

Angels, Lord of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) the last of the Prophets and

messengers, bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, and keep me

independent of the employment by Your creation, and give me ability for

devotional worship to You, grant me ease for worship, and keep me

under Your care, bestow on me contentment, and the true belief in

reliance on You. O Allah! I beseech You through that great name of

Yours with which the Heavens, the earth, things in them and in between

them remain well set in their places, through the blessings of that name

You give life to the dead and cause death to the living, and through
that

name You have kept in Your knowledge the reckoning of periods, the

weight of mountains and measurement of oceans. And with that name

You honour the disgraced and with it You disgrace the honoured. And

through that name You do what You wish and say to a thing "Be" and

then there it is. And when the seekers request You with that name You

grant their requests and when the invokers invoke Your with that name,

You accept their invocations, and when the seekers of refuge seek

refuge with that name, You give protection to them, and You remove the

distress when those in distress invoke You for the sake of that name.

And when the intercessors intercede with You, You accept their

intercessions. And You help the criers for help when they cry for help

from You with that name. And when those who present themselves

before You with that name, You listen to their utterances and help them.

And when the repentants come with that name, You accept their

penitence. And I beseech You O my Master! O my Lord! O My Allah! O

my Strength! O my Hope! O my Refuge! O my Pride! O the Treasure for

my religion, my world and my Hereafter. And I beseech You with the

greater of the greatest and most sublime name of Yours, and I invoke

You with it for my sins which none can forgive save You, and for my

affliction which none can dispel save You, and for the damage which

none can remove from me save You, and for those misdeeds with which

I disobeyed You and felt not ashamed at the time of committing them.

Here I come therefore before You as a sinner and miscreant. Surely the

earth is straitened for me with all its extensiveness. My power of

discernment is lost and it has dawned on me that there is neither

protection nor refuge anywhere but with You. And here I am before You

in a state well-entangled by sins and misdeeds and find none save You

as forgiver, nor anyone to repair my loss except You, nor anyone to

dispel my harm save You. And I say what was uttered by Your

bondsman Yunus when You responded to him and delivered him from

his grief, with a hope to turn mercifully towards me and free me from
the

sins. O my Master! There is no God but You, glory be to You surely I

was of the unjust ones. And I beseech You with Your sublime name to

accept my invocation, and to fulfill my wants, and to hasten relief for
me

with Your mercy, and to change my fears into mental peace in perfect

bounties, the best sustenance with affluence and residence, and keep

me happy by its constant flow to me. O Allah! Grant me ability to offer

my thanks to You for what You have given me, and let this be

accomplished in perfect manners till You keep me alive and forgive me

my sins, errors, my lavishment and my crimes at the time of death (i.e.

when You take me away from the world), till You convey me to the

happiness of this world and of the world Hereafter. O Allah! Under Your

control is the destination of the night and day, sun and moon, and so

also You control vice and virtue. O Allah! So please bless me in my

Faith, world, hereafter and in all my affairs! O Allah! There is no god

save You, Your promise is true and so is our attendance before You.

Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and end my life with best

of performances till You take me away from this world in a state that
You

be pleased with me. O the Ever-living! O the Self-subsisting! O the

Dispeller of great agony! Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny

and increase for me agreeable sustenance in accordance with Your

generosity for verily You have taken the responsibility on Yourself to

provide me and every living creature with livelihood. O the Best to be

invoked! O the Best to seek from! O the Most Liberal Bestower! O the

Best centre of hopes! So kindly increase sustenance for me and for my

family. O Al lah! I beseech You to wri te in the book of Your

predestination, and decree of inevitable, and wise affairs which You

decide in the Night of Greatness (Lailatul Qadr) and which neither could

be reversed nor could be changed, my name as one of the pilgrims of

Your Sacred House whose performances of the pilgrim rites are

accepted, their efforts are appreciated, their sins are forgiven, their

misdeeds are erased, who have plenty of livelihood, their bodies are

healthy, and their fears are allayed, and prolong my life, increase my

sustenance. O the Ever-present! Present prior to the presence of

Everything! O the Creator of Everything! The eyes sleep, the stars set

down, but You are Ever-living, Self-subsisting, neither slumber nor
sleep

overtakes You. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny, show

mercy to them and bestow Your favours on them in the manner You

Blessed, bestowed Your favours and showed mercy to Ibrahim and his

Progeny. Verily Your are Praiseworthy and Great. O Allah! I beseech

You in the name of Your Glory, Forbearance, Greatness and

Generosity, to bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny , and to

forgive me, my parents and have all-embracing mercy on them as they

nurtured me when I was little, O the Most Merciful! O Allah! I beseech

You for You are an absolute sovereign. Verily You are Powerful over

everything, and happens what You will, so forgive me, my believer

brothers and sisters. Verily You are Ever-kind and Merciful. All praise
be

to Allah Who fed us among the hungry. All praise be to Allah Who

granted us safety among the frightened ones. All praise be to Allah Who

made us guided among the ignorant ones. O the Hope of the believers!

Disappoint me not in my expectation! O the Succourer of the believers!

Help me! O the Succourer of those who seek help from You! Come to

my rescue. O the Acceptor of penitence! Turn mercifully towards me!

Verily You turn mercifully towards Your bondsmen. My Lord suffices me

as a Cherisher better than the cherished ones. My Creator is sufficient

for me as compared to the created. My Master is better for me than the

servants. My sustainer is more liberal for me than those who are

sustained by Him. Sufficient is He for me Who is Eternal. Sufficient,

Sufficient is He Who suffices me. Allah is sufficient for me as the Best

Protector. Sufficient for me is Allah. Save Him there is no God and on

Him I rely and He is the Lord of the Great Throne. There is no god save
