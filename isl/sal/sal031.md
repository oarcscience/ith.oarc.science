Another of his supplication on sighting the

Moon

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O the one who is continuously obedient, the one that comes and goes

on the places fixed by destiny and on the heavens of determination. I

have brought faith in Him, the One Who turned darkness into light

through you and illuminated darkness, appointed you as a sign of His

power, tested you by growing, lessening, rising, setting, shining and by

eclipse. In all these you were obedient to Allah and strictly followed
the

commands. How pure is Allah, how much amazing laws He has passed

for you. How the wise creation was created by Him and appointed you

as a moon for every new month. May Allah appoint you among the safe,

and faithful and peaceful moons. That moon from which there is safety

from deviation and protection from evils. O Allah! Make me the most

guided one among all those upon whom it shone. Make it the most pious

for all those who see, and blessings of Allah be on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.)

and his progeny (ask for your wishes and then say) O the most merciful
