His supplication like a fort

It should be written and tied on the right arm

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

And you were not on the western side when We revealed to Musa his

commandment, and you were not among the witnesses. Get out by the

order of Allah, O’ the vicious one, by the Honour of Allah; Lord of the

Worlds, or else you will be imprisoned. Be away from here, as you have

no right to move freely over here. Go forth surely you are one of the

abject ones. Go out as you are degraded and rebuked and stoned as

Allah had cursed the violators of Sabbath and command of Allah shall be

executed. Blessed is Allah the best of the creators. O life, O life in
the

name of Allah Who is eternal which is written on the forehead of
Israfeel

be away from the one who has worn this talisman whether you are jinn

or fairy, devil or devils, male or female, male or female magician,
ghost

or witch or any other thing who plays with the son of Adam or Eve.

There is no power or strength except for Allah the exalted and High. And

O Allah bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny, the pure and

infallible ones.
