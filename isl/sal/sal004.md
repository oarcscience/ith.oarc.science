His Prayer in Praise and Eulogy of Allah for

all important affairs and problems

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! You are ever-living Who will never die, You are the truthful
Who

never lies, Overpowering everything and no one overpowers You.

Creator Who does not take anybody's help. You are since inception and

will never be annihilated. You are near and never far. You are strong no

one can overpower You. You are forgiving and is never unjust. You are

self sufficient no one sustains You. You are unparalleled and are not

Honour that none over power. You are possessor of knowledge, never

learnt anything from anyone. You are strong and can never be weak.

You are a tolerant knowing everything. You can never be ignorant. You

are great and no one can praise You. You always fulfill the promises

and never break the promises. You are just, You can never oppress.

You overpower everything, nothing can overpower You. You are self

sufficient You can never be dependent. You are great You can never be

small. You never exceed in Your judgment. You take care of everyone

and don't despise anyone. You are safe, none can harm You. You are

famous, none can be ignorant about You. You are Unique Who doesn’t

need a helper. You are incomparable. You do not take anybody's

opinion. You are the giver without being stingy. You listen to
everything

without forgetting anything. You are generous without being a miser.

You are omnipotent and cannot be degraded. You are the protector and

can never be negligent. You are responsible, knowledgeable and You

never forget. You have existed by Yourself and You never sleep. You

are forbearing and never hasty. You see whatever is veiled and You

cannot be seen. You are Eternal and can never be destroyed. You will

the one Who is near! O the one Who replies! O the most High! O the

possessor of Majesty! O the possessor of Blessings! O Believer! O

Protector! O Honoured! O Possessor of Honour! O Possessor of Power!

O One Who overpowers everything! O Magnanimous! O the owner of

Magnanimity! O the Pure! O the Chaste! O Powerful! O the possessor

of Power! O the one Who can be called from the depth (of the heart) in

different languages in times of various needs! One thing does not deter

You from another. You are the one Who will never perish and the world

cannot destroy You, nor change You, nor can encircle You. Neither

laziness nor sleep can overcome You. Nor can You be compared to

anything. Because You are the creator of everything, there is no lord

other than You. Everything will perish except You Who will remain. Your

self is the most honoured than all other selves. Your remembrance is

pure. Your command is above all defects. You right is obligatory. Your

decision is implemented. Your obedience is compulsory. O Allah, bless

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny (a.s.). Make my affairs easy in

which there is a fear of impossibility and ward away from me the sorrow,

which I and the other believers fear, whose troubles I am afraid of.
Make

it easy for me. And save me from the calamities which may destroy me.

O most merciful of all the mercifuls. O the owner of greatness and
glory.

There is no god but You, Glory be to You, verily I am of the unjust
ones.

And peace be upon Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny (a.s.) the

pure and chaste.
