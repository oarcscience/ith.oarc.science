His supplication when sustenance becomes

scarce

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! So and so son of so and so does not have the strength to bear

the calamities nor to endure poverty. O Allah send blessing on

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny and do not cut down his

sustenance and do not curtail Your obligations on him. Do not make him

away from Your grace, do not make him unsuccessful from Your

uncountable bounties. Do not entrust him upon Your creatures nor leave

him upon himself because he would not be able to take care of himself.

On the contrary You Yourself ward off the troubles, which are

surrounding him. Only You guide him, be attentive on all his

transactions, because if You entrust him upon Your creatures, they

would not be able to benefit him, and if You leave him with his friends

then they will not give him his due and if they ever give, it will be
very

less and if they do not give it would be nothing at all. And if they
behave

miserly I would be affected. O Allah! Make so and so son of so and so

self-sufficient by Your grace and do not neglect him because he is

restless in Your presence, and he is fully dependent on the things,

which are in Your power, and are You unaware? You are fully aware

and knowing it. And whoever relies on Allah then it is sufficient for
him

without any doubt Allah will fulfill his desires. Allah has appointed a
fix

term for everyone. Surely every trouble is accompanied by ease. Surely

with every hardship there is ease, and whoever fears Allah, Allah makes

a way for him and he is bestowed from where he had least expected.
