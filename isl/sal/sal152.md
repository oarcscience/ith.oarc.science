His supplication for the twenty-eighth of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah! I seek refuge with You against everything other than You. O

Allah! You are the Greatest. O Allah! Deprive me not of the goodness of

what You have bestowed and make me not suffer any evil what You

have not bestowed. O Allah! I beseech You to bestow upon me family,

wealth, faith, trust, and various children better than bestowed upon
Your

bondsmen. O Allah! I am dependent on You, and am afraid of You, and

seek protection from You. O Allah! Protect me against any change in my

name, and disfigure not my body, involve me not in trials, and impose

not on me calamities after calamities. O Allah! I seek refuge with You

from riches leading me to any revolt against You, from egoistic

inclinations of any ruining and from disgracing performances. O Allah!

Forgive my sins, accept my penitence, make me manifest my arguments,

conceal my defects and make Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his chosen

Progeny my Masters and solicitors of Your Mercy for me. O Allah! I seek

refuge with You against any utterance leading me to disobedience to

You and to seek pleasure of other than You. O Allah! I seek refuge with

You that any person other than me should become more auspicious in

respect of what You have bestowed on me. O Allah! I seek refuge with

You from the evil of Satan, from the evil of those in power and from the

orders promulgated by the writing of pens. And I beseech You for

virtuous deeds, life full of bliss and sustenance flowing abundantly. O

Allah! You record the sin, and are well aware of our secrets, and

intervene between the hearts, and the hearts are turned towards You,

and our secrets are manifest before You. Verily, Your command, when

You intend anything, is only that You say it "Be" and there it is. O
Allah! I

beseech You in the name of Your Mercy to infuse the spirit of obedience

to You, in every part of my body that I may act obediently, and then

never take this spirit away. O Allah! I beseech You in the name of Your

Mercy to remove disobedience to You from all the parts of my body that

may abstain from disobedience to You and let it not ever return to me. O

Allah! You are a symbol of kindness, and You like forgiveness, so

please forgive me. O Allah! You were and nothing was there to be

perceived and You will survive everything. You are Ever-living,

Self-subsisting. The eyes sleep and the stars set down but neither

slumber nor sleep seizes You. Bless Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his

Progeny, and dispel my grief and anxiety, and enable me to come out

from every affair that grieves me, and make me firm in the belief in

making You my centre of hopes so as to dissuade me from entertaining

any hope from Your creation, and that I trust none save You. O Allah!

Drive me neither to a ruining place nor bring me nearer to it nor
include

me among the unmindful persons. O Allah! I seek refuge with You

against my misguiding Your bondsmen and against entertaining any

uncertainty about Your accepting any invocation. O Allah! Your Book

has recorded my sins and Your knowledge has encompassed them and

Your awareness has gone to the detail of it. I am miscreant sinner and

You are Forgiving, Benevolent Lord. I am ready of offer my penitence to

You. I confess what has passed. Kindly overlook what has happened

and forgive my past sins. For Verily, You turn mercifully toward Your

bondsmen. O Allah! None can be better than You in showing Mercy to

me, so kindly be compassionate to me, and impose not anyone in this

world and in the Hereafter on me who may not show mercy towards me.

O Allah! Call me not to account for the misdeeds of mine which You

have kindly concealed so as to punish me on the Day of Resurrection

and let not Your entire creation mock at me. O my Lord! Forgive me in

both the worlds for You are All-forgiving, Merciful. O Allah! I deserve
not

to reach Your Mercy but Your Mercy can reach me and take me under

its shelter for it has taken everything within its fold; it should
therefore

take me under its fold, O the Most Merciful! O Allah! There are some of

Your privileged bondsmen who obey Your Commands and carry out that

for which You have created them. This ability of theirs is under Your

obligation, bestowed by none other than You. O the Most Merciful! Your

Blessing them with Your Mercy preceded their obedience to You. O

Allah! O my Master! O my Lord! O my Allah! O my Shelter! O my

Protection! O my Strength! O the Comfort of my heart! O my Creator! O

my Providence! Bless me with the privilege given to them with ability to

perform which they were made able and show to me All-embracing

Perfect Mercy as shown to them, O the Most Merciful! O You! Whom

multiple voices do not confuse O You! Whom the requests of the

seekers do not put in the wrong. O You! Whom the pressing solicitations

of persistent requesters do not annoy, make me taste the coolness of

Your Forgiveness and Sweetness of Your Remembrance and Your

Mercy. O Allah! I beseech You for Your Forgiveness of my sins for which

I turned penitent to You but committed the same again. And I seek

forgiveness for disobedience to You, the strength thereof I derived with

Your Bounties bestowed on me. And I seek Your forgiveness for all such

deeds performed to derive Your pleasure but got me mingled with the

things which did not befit You. And I seek Your forgiveness for the

promise which I made but I broke my promise. And I seek Your

forgiveness for deeds committed under the urge of my self-seeking soul

to take advantage of the respite granted by You, through the

performance of such deeds during the respite is not permitted, O the

Glorious and the Gracious! O You! Who bestowed upon me the

knowledge of His Self, occupy me not in anyone else other than You,

and entrust me not to anyone save You, and make me independent of

Your creation save You, O the Most Merciful! Bless Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) and his purified Progeny.
