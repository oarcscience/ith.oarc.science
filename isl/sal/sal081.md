His supplication for the return of the one

who flees the battlefield

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Or like utter darkness in the stormy seas. There is wave upon wave,

above which is a Cloud, (layers of) utter darkness one above another;

when a man holds out his hand, he is unable to see it; and for

whomsoever Allah does not create light, he has no light.
