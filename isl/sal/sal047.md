His supplication to save from drowning or

burning

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

Surely my guardian is Allah Who revealed the Book and He loves the

doer of good. These (Jews) people did not care for Allah although the

whole earth and the skies are in the control of Allah, and He is far

greater than what people ascribe to Him.
