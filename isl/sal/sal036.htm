<p>His supplication in the first 10 days of Zilhajj</p>  
<p><i>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</i></p>  
<p>There is no god save Allah, in the midst of the multitude of nights and</p>  
<p>days; there is no god save Allah, in the midst of the repeating concourse</p>  
<p>of the waves moving across the surface of the oceans; there is no god</p>  
<p>save Allah, His loving kindness out balances their addition put together;</p>  
<p>there is no god save Allah, in the midst of the plentitude of plants and</p>  
<p>leaves; There is no god save Allah, in the midst of countless pores and</p>  
<p>mass of hairs; there is no god save Allah, in the midst of numerous</p>  
<p>stones and particles in heaps; there is no god save Allah, in the midst of</p>  
<p>quite a many flashes of the eyes; there is no god save Allah, in the</p>  
<p>hours of every night when darkness begins to deepen and at every</p>  
<p>daybreak when light shines bright; there is no god save Allah, in the</p>  
<p>midst of thousands of winds blowing over the plains and mountains;</p>  
<p>there is no god save Allah, from today to the day of "blowing of the horn"</p>  
<p>(the final call).</p>
