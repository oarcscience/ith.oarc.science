His Supplication in Praise of Allah

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O One Who is nearer to me than the jugular vein. O One Who fulfills all

He wishes. O One Who is in between a man and his heart. O One Who

is at the highest place of manifestation. O One Who has no parallel.
