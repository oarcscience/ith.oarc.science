His supplication for the twenty-fifth of the

month

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

I seek refuge with the perfect words of Allah from the influence of
which

neither the pious nor the vicious can escape, from the evil of
Everything

that grows in the earth or comes out of it, or descends down from the

Heavens, or ascends towards it, and from the evil of the misfortune of

the day and night (i.e. vicissitude of fortune), and from every mishap

save the mishap behind which is hidden good luck. O the Beneficent! O

the Most Merciful! O Allah! I aspire to have such a faith after which
there

should be no turning to faithlessness, and aspire to have an everlasting

bounty and companionship of the Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and of

his virtuous and purified Progeny in the eternal garden of Paradise with

the Prophets, the truthfuls, the martyrs and the virtuous ones and

excellent are these as companion. O Allah! Give me peace in exchange

of fears and put a veil against my defects and overlook my lapses, for

You are Allah, There is no god save You - You are One and there is no

associate with You, for You is the absolute kingdom and for You is all

praise. And You are Powerful over everything. O Allah! I entreat You for

You are entreated, You are the praised, believed as One, Adorable, the

great Benefactor with eternal good, Originator of the Heavens and the

Earth, Glorious and Gracious, to forgive all my sins minor, major

committed intentionally or in unawareness and those which I have

forgotten personally, but You have preserved them. Verily You are

Merciful and turn towards Your bondsmen mercifully. O Allah! O the

Originator of the Heavens and the Earth! O the Glorious and the

Gracious! O the Succourer of those who seek Your help! O the

Redresser of grievances and the centre for those who love to be

inclined towards You. You are the Dispeller of the Agony of those in

distress. You are the Bestower of pleasure to the sad. You are the

Answerer to the call of those in distress. You are devotedly worshipped

by the Worlds! You are the Most Merciful. You are Dispeller of every

affliction and the destination for achievement of the desires. Bless

Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny and treat me in the way that

befits Your honour. There is no deity save You my Lord. You are my

Master and I am Your slave, son of Your slave and son of Your maid. My

destiny is within Your control. I have been unjust to myself and I
confess

my sins and misdeeds. I beseech You for it is Your right to bestow

favours, O the Great Benefactor! O the Innovator of the Heavens and

the Earth! O the Glorious and the Gracious! Bestow upon Muhammad

(s.a.w.a.) Your Bondsman and messenger and on his Progeny, the best

of Your blessings never bestowed on anyone of Your Creation. I

beseech You in the name of Your Power, whereby You split the sea for

the children of Israel, to protect me from every rebel, envious person,
the

enemy and opponent. And I beseech You with the name of Yours with

which You shook the mountain over as if it were a covering, and people

thought that it was going to fall down upon them, to protect me against

what I fear. O Allah! With Your help I avert my fear for them. And I
seek

refuge with You from their evil and seek Your protection against them. I

seek help from You against them. O Allah! Allah is my Lord - I associate

none with Him nor do I accept anyone as my Master. O Allah! Send Your

Blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Progeny. Ameen.
