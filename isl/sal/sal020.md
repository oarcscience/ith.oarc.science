His Dua seeking forgiveness

*In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful*

O Allah I seek forgiveness from those things which I have repeated after

repenting for it and I repent to You for those things which were
intended

for You but while doing them the intention changed which was not for

You. And I seek Your forgiveness from those bounties which were

bestowed for Your obedience but I used them for Your disobedience and

I repent for it that there is no one other than Allah, He is the living,
the

self existing, Knower of the unseen and Omnipresent, the Beneficent the

Merciful. I seek forgiveness for all those sins which I have committed

and of all those sins which I have initiated. O Allah give me perfect

intelligence and enlighten my wishes and intellect, clean heart,

abundance knowledge, clear ethics, all these things which are beneficial

to me and not harmful to me. O the One Who is most Beneficial by Your

mercy (then recite five times) "I seek refuge in Allah there is no lord

except Him, the living, the self existent. To Him do I repent. (I seek

forgiveness from Allah Who is without a heir and is alive, and the

supporter of the universe and I turn to Him in repentance.)
