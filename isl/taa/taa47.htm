<p>1. The full moon appeared in the night of hair, and the black narcissus bedewed the rose.</p>  
<p>2. A tender girl is she: the fair women were confounded by her, and her radiance outshone the moon.</p>  
<p>3. If she enters into the mind, that imagination wounds her: how, then, can she be perceived by the eye?</p>  
<p>4. She is a phantom of delight that melts away when we think of her: she is too subtle for the range of vision.</p>  
<p>5. Description sought to explain her, but she was transcendent, and description became dumb.</p>  
<p>6. Whenever it tries to qualify her, it always retires baffled.</p>  
<p>7. If one who seeks her will give rest to his beasts, others will not give rest to the beast of reflection.</p>  
<p>8. She is a joy that transports from the rank of humanity every one who burns with love of her,</p>  
<p>9. From jealousy that her clear essence should be mingled with the filth which is in the tanks.</p>  
<p>10. She excels the sun in splendour: her form is not to be compared with any.</p>  
<p>11. The heaven of light is under the sole of her foot: her diadem is beyond the spheres.</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. 'The full moon,' etc., i.e. the Divine manifestation appeared in the unseen world of mysterious knowledge.</p>  
<p>'And the black narcissus,' etc., i.e. the weeping eye bedewed the red cheeks. He means to say that the centre of Essential manifestation replenished the Divine names.</p>  
<p>2. 'The fair women,' i.e. the attendant Names.</p>  
<p>7. 'One who seeks her,' i.e. the gnostic who is aware that he cannot reach her.</p>  
<p>'His beasts,' i.e. his aspirations.</p>  
<p><a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="green">p. 131</font></A></p>  
<p>'Others,' i.e. men of understanding who assert that God is known by logical demonstration.</p>  
<p>8. 'Transports from the rank of humanity,' i.e. to the next world, in which the disembodied spirits assume different forms (###).</p>  
<p>9. 'The filth which is in the tanks,' i.e. the impurity and darkness of nature in the corporeal world.</p>  
<p>11. Cf. Kor. xx, 4, and the Tradition that God, before He created the Throne, was in a dense cloud, and neither above it nor beneath it was any air.</p>
