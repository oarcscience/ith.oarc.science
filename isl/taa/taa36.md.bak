*The Tarjuman al-Ashwaq*, by Ibn al-Arabi, tr. Reynold A. Nicholson,
\[1911\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XXXIII

1\. I respond with diverse notes of grief to every cooing dove perched
upon a bough in a grove.

2\. She weeps for her mate without tears, but from my eyelids the tears
of sorrow are streaming.

3\. I say to her, when my eyelids have shed their abundant tears in
token of my inward state,

4\. 'Hast thou any knowledge of those whom I love, and did they rest at
midday in the shadows of the branches?'

#### COMMENTARY

1\. 'Every cooing dove,' i.e. subtle spiritual essences which appear in
forms of the intermediate world.

2\. 'From my eyelids,' etc.: because of my bodily existence.

4\. 'Did they rest,' etc., i.e. did they show themselves in the shades
of this natural organism, so that I may seek them there?
