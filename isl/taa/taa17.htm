<p>1. He saw the lightning in the east and he longed for the east, but if it had flashed in the west he would have longed for the west.</p>  
<p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></A></p>  
<p>2. My desire is for the lightning and its gleam, not for the places and the earth.</p>  
<p>3. The east wind related to me from them a tradition handed down successively from distracted thoughts, from my passion, from anguish, from my tribulation,</p>  
<p>4. From rapture, from my reason, from yearning, from ardour, from tears, from my eyelid, from fire, from my heart,</p>  
<p>5. That 'He whom thou lovest is between thy ribs; the breaths toss him from side to side'.</p>  
<p>6. I said to the east wind, 'Bring a message to him and say that he is the enkindler of the fire within my heart.</p>  
<p>7. If it shall be quenched, then everlasting union, and if it shall burn, then no blame to the lover!'</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. He refers to the vision of God in created things, viz. the manifestation in forms, and this causes him to cleave to phenomena, because the manifestation appears in them.</p>  
<p>'The east,' i.e. the place of phenomenal manifestation.</p>  
<p>'If it had flashed in the west,' i.e. if it had been a manifestation of the Divine essence to the lover's heart, he would have longed for that purer manifestation in the world of purity and mystery.</p>  
<p>2. He says, 'I desire the forms in which the manifestation takes place only in so far as they are a <i>locus</i> for the manifestation itself.'</p>  
<p>3. The world of breaths (###) communicated to me the inward meaning of these phenomenal forms.</p>  
<p>4. 'Rapture' (literally, 'intoxication,' ###): the fourth degree in the manifestations. The first degree is ###, the second ###, and the third ###.</p>  
<p>'From my reason,' because intoxication transports the reason and takes away from it whatever it has.</p>  
<p>5. 'The breaths,' etc., i.e. the overwhelming awe inspired by this manifestation produces in him various ecstasies (###).</p>  
<p>7. He says, 'If the awful might of this manifestation shall be veiled through the permanence of the Divine</p>  
<p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></A></p>  
<p>substance, then the union will be lasting; but if the manifestation be unchecked, it will sweep away all that exists in its <i>locus</i>, and those who perish are not in fault.' This is the saying of one possessed and mastered by ecstasy.</p>
