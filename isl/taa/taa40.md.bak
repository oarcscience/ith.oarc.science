*The Tarjuman al-Ashwaq*, by Ibn al-Arabi, tr. Reynold A. Nicholson,
\[1911\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XXXVII

1\. O my two comrades, approach the guarded pasture and seek Najd and
yonder sign that marks the way,

2\. And come down to a well at the tents of the curving sand and beg
shade of its *ḍál* and *salam* trees.

3\. And whenever ye come to the valley of Mind—for then ye have come to
that in which is my heart's being—

4\. Deliver to all who dwell there the greetings of love from me, or
only say, 'Peace be with you!'

5\. And hearken what they will reply, and tell how one who is heartsick

6\. Complains of the ardours of love, while he is hiding nothing,
seeking information, and asking questions.
