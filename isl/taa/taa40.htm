<p>1. O my two comrades, approach the guarded pasture and seek Najd and yonder sign that marks the way,</p>  
<p>2. And come down to a well at the tents of the curving sand and beg shade of its <i>&#7693;&aacute;l</i> and <i>salam</i> trees.</p>  
<p>3. And whenever ye come to the valley of Mind&#8212;for then ye have come to that in which is my heart's being&#8212;</p>  
<p>4. Deliver to all who dwell there the greetings of love from me, or only say, 'Peace be with you!'</p>  
<p>5. And hearken what they will reply, and tell how one who is heartsick</p>  
<p>6. Complains of the ardours of love, while he is hiding nothing, seeking information, and asking questions.</p>
