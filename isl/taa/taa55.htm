<p>1. I am content with Ra&#7693;w&aacute; as a meadow and a lodging-place, for it has a pasture in which is cool water.</p>  
<p>2. May be, those whom I love will hear of its fertility, so that they will take it as an abode and lodging-place.</p>  
<p>3. For lo, my heart is attached to them and listens silently whenever the camel-driver urges them on with his chant.</p>  
<p>4. And if they call to one another to set out and cross the desert, thou wilt hear its wailing behind their camels.</p>  
<p>5. And if they make for az-Zawr&aacute;, it will be in front of them, and if they are bound for al-Jar&#8216;&aacute;, it will alight there.</p>  
<p>6. No fortune is found except where they are and where they encamp, for the bird of Fortune has fledglings in their tribe.</p>  
<p>7. Fear for myself and fear for her sake battled with each other, and neither gave way to its adversary.</p>  
<p>8. When her splendours dazzle mine eyes, the sound of my sobbing deafens her ears.</p>
