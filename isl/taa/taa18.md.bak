*The Tarjuman al-Ashwaq*, by Ibn al-Arabi, tr. Reynold A. Nicholson,
\[1911\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XV

1\. They left me at al-Uthayl and an-Naqá shedding tears and complaining
of the fire (that consumed me).

2\. My father be the ransom of him for whose sake I melted with anguish!
My father be the ransom of him for whose sake I died of fear!

3\. The blush of shame on his cheek is the whiteness of dawn conversing
with the redness of eve.

4\. Patience decamped and grief pitched tents, and I lie prostrate
between these two.

5\. Who will compose my distracted thoughts? Who will relieve my pain?
Guide me to him! Who will ease my sorrow? Who will help a passionate
lover?

6\. Whenever I keep secret the torments of desire, my tears betray the
flame within and the sleeplessness.

7\. And whenever I say, 'Give me one look!' the answer is, 'Thou art not
hindered but for pity's sake.'

8\. It cannot be that one look from them will avail thee. Is it aught
but the glimpse of a levin that flashed?

9\. I am not forgetting the time when the camel-driver, wishing for
separation and seeking al-Abraq, urged them on.

10\. The ravens of separation croaked at them—may God not preserve a
raven that croaked!

11\. The raven of separation is only a camel which carried away the
loved ones with a swift wide-stepping pace.

#### COMMENTARY

1\. He laments the departure of his companions, viz. the spiritual
angelic beings who suffer no natural bondage, whilst he is left a
prisoner in this body, occupied with governing it and prevented from
wandering freely through the celestial spheres.

'Al-Uthayl,' his natural constitution (\#\#\#).

'An-Naqá,' his body.

2\. 'My father,' i.e. the Highest Spirit (\#\#\#) which is his real
father in the world above and his phenomenal mother in the world below.

'Of him for whose sake I melted with anguish': he refers to the Divine
mystery contained in his heart.

'Of fear,' i.e. fear of the radiance of the Divine majesty.

6\. The love that is revealed is stronger and more passionate, for there
is no good in a love that is ruled by reason.

7\. God in His mercy veils the splendours of His face from His
creatures.

8\. The more the Beloved looks on thee, the more is thy anguish
increased. Vision is possible only in moments of ecstasy.

9\. 'The camel-driver,' i.e. the voice of God calling those exalted
spiritual beings to ascend towards Him.

'Separation,' i.e. their departure from the phenomenal world.

'Al-Abraq,' the place where God is manifested in His essence.

10\. 'The ravens of separation,' i.e. considerations affecting his
phenomenal existence, which hinder him from the ascent to God.

11\. 'A camel,' i.e. the ravens of separation are really a man's
aspirations (\#\#\#), since aspiration bears him aloft and unites him
with the object of his search.
