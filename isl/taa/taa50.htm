<p>1. O dove on the <i>b&aacute;n</i> tree at Dh&aacute;t al-Gha&#7693;&aacute;, I am oppressed by the burden thou hast laid upon me.</p>  
<p>2. Who can support the anguish of love? Who can drain the bitter draught of destiny?</p>  
<p>3. I say in my grief and burning passion, 'O would that he who caused my sickness had tended me when I am sick!'</p>  
<p>4. He passed by the house-door mocking, hiding himself, veiling his head and turning away.</p>  
<p>5. His veiling did me no hurt; I was only hurt by his having turned away from me.</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. 'O dove,' i.e. the Absolute Wisdom.</p>  
<p>'Dh&aacute;t al-Gha&#7693;&aacute;,' referring to states of self-mortification.</p>  
<p>'The burden': cf. Kor. xxxiii, 72.</p>  
<p>4. 'He passed,' etc., referring to Divine thoughts which flash upon the mind and are gone in a moment.</p>  
<p>5. i.e. I am necessarily veiled from God, but God's turning away from me is caused by some quality in me of which I am ignorant and which I cannot remove until God enables me to know what it is.</p>
