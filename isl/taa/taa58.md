### LV

1\. I am absent, and desire makes my soul die; and I meet him and am not
cured, so ’tis desire whether I am absent or present.

2\. And meeting with him creates in me what I never

imagined; and the remedy is a second disease of passion,

3\. Because I behold a form whose beauty, as often as we meet, grows in
splendour and majesty.

4\. Hence there is no escape from a passion that increases in
correspondence with every increase in his loveliness according to a
predestined scale.

#### COMMENTARY

1-4. He is continually tormented, for in the anguish of absence he hopes
to be cured by meeting his Beloved, but the meeting only adds to his
pain, because he is always moving from a lower state to a higher, and
the latter inevitably produces in him a more intense passion than the
former did.
