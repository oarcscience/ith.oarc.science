my kindling fire for them by rubbing the *‘afár* and the *markh*

#### COMMENTARY

1-3. He says: 'Our praise of God (\#\#\#), telling of the Divine
Revelation, recalls to me the time of pilgrimage in the station where
the veils were rent and lifted from me by acts of devotion that produced
spiritual feelings and aspirations of which I was unconscious, and
brings me back from my present state of acting in unveiledness and
without being conscious of consciousness to the former state of acting
in which I was veiled.'

4\. 'My kindling fire,' etc., i.e. the things generated by veiled
secondary causes whereby the reality is doubly disguised.
