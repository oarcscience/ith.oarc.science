*The Tarjuman al-Ashwaq*, by Ibn al-Arabi, tr. Reynold A. Nicholson,
\[1911\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### LIII

1\. Whenever we meet to take farewell thou wouldst deem us, as we clasp
and embrace, to be a doubled letter.

2\. Although our bodies are dual, the eye sees only a single one.

3\. This is because of my leanness and his light, and were it not for my
moaning, I should have been invisible to the eye.

#### COMMENTARY

1-2. The doubled letter is two letters, one of which is concealed in the
other. The soul, bidding farewell to the body, says, 'We are in this
case, for though we are really two, we appear to be one.' The soul loves
the body because all her knowledge of God is gained through her
imprisonment in the body and through her making use of it in order to
serve God. The author also refers to the verse, 'I am he whom I love and
he whom I love is I.'

The mention of 'farewell' indicates a distinction between the qualities
which properly belong to the lover and those which properly belong to
the Beloved.

3\. 'My leanness,' i.e. I am of the spiritual world.

'And his light,' i.e. on account of the intensity of his light his eye
cannot perceive either his own radiance or my subtlety.

'And were it not,' etc.: so Mutanabbí says, 'Were it not that I speak to
thee, thou wouldst not see me.'
