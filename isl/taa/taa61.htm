<p>1. Oh, is there any way to the damsels bright and fair? And is there anyone who will show me their traces?</p>  
<p>2. And can I halt at night beside the tents of the curving sand? And can I rest at noon in the shade of the <i>ar&aacute;k</i> trees?</p>  
<p>3. The tongue of inward feeling spoke, informing me that she says, 'Wish for that which is attainable.'</p>  
<p>4. My love for thee is whole, O thou end of my hopes, and because of that love my heart is sick.</p>  
<p>5. Thou art exalted, a full moon rising over the heart, a moon that never sets after it hath risen.</p>  
<p>6. May I be thy ransom, O thou who art glorious in beauty and pride! for thou hast no equal amongst the fair.</p>  
<p>7. Thy gardens are wet with dew and thy roses are blooming,</p>  
<p><a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="green">p. 145</font></A></p>  
<p>and thy beauty is passionately loved: it is welcome to all.</p>  
<p>8. Thy flowers are smiling and thy boughs are fresh: wherever they bend, the winds bend towards them.</p>  
<p>9. Thy grace is tempting and thy look piercing: armed with it the knight, affliction, rushes upon me.</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. 'The damsels bright and fair,' i.e. the knowledge derived from the manifestations of His Beautiful Name.</p>  
<p>2. 'The tents of the curving sand,' i.e. the stations of Divine favour.</p>  
<p>'The shade of the <i>ar&aacute;k</i> trees,' i.e. contemplation of the pure and holy Presence.</p>  
<p>3. This station is gained only by striving and sincere application, not by wishing. 'Travel that thou mayst attain' (###).</p>  
<p>5. 'A moon that never sets,' etc.: he points out that God never manifests Himself to anything and then becomes veiled from it afterwards.</p>  
<p>7. 'Thy gardens are wet with dew,' i.e. all Thy creatures are replenished by the Divine qualities which are revealed to them.</p>  
<p>'Thy roses are blooming,' in reference to a particular manifestation which destroys every blameworthy quality.</p>  
<p>'It is welcome,' i.e. it is loved for its essence (###).</p>  
<p>8. 'Thy flowers,' etc., i.e. Thy knowledge is welcome to the heart.</p>  
<p>'Thy boughs,' i.e. the spiritual influences which convey Thy knowledge (###).</p>
