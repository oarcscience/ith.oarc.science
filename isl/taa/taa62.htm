<p>1. &#7788;ayba hath a gazelle from whose witching eye (glances like) the edge of a keen blade are drawn,</p>  
<p>2. And at &#8216;Araf&aacute;t I perceived what she desired and I was not patient,</p>  
<p>3. And on the night of Jam&#8216; we had union with her, such as is mentioned in the proverb.</p>  
<p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 146</font></A></p>  
<p>4. The girl's oath is false: do not confide in that which betrays.</p>  
<p>5. The wish I gained at Min&aacute;, would that it might continue to the last hour of my life!</p>  
<p>6. In La&#8216;la&#8216; I was transported with love for her who displays to thee the splendour of the bright moon.</p>  
<p>7. She shot R&aacute;ma and inclined to dalliance at a&#7779;-&#7778;ab&aacute; and removed the interdiction at al-H&aacute;jir.</p>  
<p>8. And she watched a lightning-gleam over B&aacute;riq with a glance swifter than a thought that passes in the mind.</p>  
<p>9. And the waters of al-Gha&#7693;&aacute; were diminished by a blazing fire which passion kindled within his ribs.</p>  
<p>10. And she appeared at the <i>b&aacute;n</i> tree of an-Naq&aacute; and chose (for her adornment) the choicest of its superb hidden pearls.</p>  
<p>11. And at Dh&aacute;t al-A&#7693;&aacute; she turned backward in dread of the lurking lion.</p>  
<p>12, At Dh&uacute; Salam she surrendered my life-blood to her murderous languishing glance.</p>  
<p>13. She stood on guard at the guarded pasture and bent at the sand-bend, swayed by her all-cancelling decisive resolution.</p>  
<p>14. And at &#8216;&Aacute;lij she managed her affair (in such a way) that she might escape from the claw of the bird.</p>  
<p>15. Her Khawarnaq rends the sky and towers beyond the vision of the observer.</p>  <h4 align="center">COMMENTARY</h4>  
<p>1. '&#7788;ayba (Medina) hath a gazelle,' referring to a Mu&#7717;ammadan degree (###), i.e. a spiritual presence belonging to the station of Mu&#7717;ammad.</p>  
<p>3. 'On the night of Jam&#8216;': he says, 'we abode in the station of proximity (###) and He concentrated me upon myself' (###).</p>  
<p>'In the proverb,' namely, 'He did not salute until he bade farewell' (###), i.e. they parted as soon as they met.</p>  
<p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 147</font></A></p>  
<p>4. He says, 'Put no trust in an Attribute that is not self-subsistent and depends on One who may not always accomplish its desires.'</p>  
<p>7. 'She shot R&aacute;ma,' i.e. she shot that which she was seeking (###), because she regarded the thing as being the opposite of what it was and of what she believed it to be.</p>  
<p>'And inclined to dalliance at a&#7779;-&#7778;ab&aacute;,' i.e. she desired to manifest herself.</p>  
<p>8. 'A lightning-gleam,' i.e. a locks of manifestation for the Essence.</p>  
<p>10. 'And chose,' etc., i.e. she revealed herself in the most lovely shape.</p>  
<p>11. 'Dh&aacute;t al-A&#7693;&aacute;,' i.e. the place of illumination.</p>  
<p>'She turned backward,' etc., i.e. she returned to her natural world for fear that that fierce light should consume her.</p>  
<p>12. Gnostics are annihilated by their vision of the Truth, but this does not happen to the vulgar, because they lack knowledge of themselves.</p>  
<p>13. 'The guarded pasture,' i.e. the station of Divine glory.</p>  
<p>'Bent,' i.e. inclined with Divine mercy. This refers to her investing herself with Divine qualities (###).</p>  
<p>14. 'That she might escape,' etc., i.e. she was unwilling to receive from the spirits, for she wished to receive only from God, by intuitive feeling (###), not by cognition (###). God sometimes bestows His gifts by the mediation of the exalted spirits, and sometimes immediately.</p>  
<p>15. 'Her Khawarnaq,' i.e. the seat of her kingdom.</p>
