<p>3. When the heart is purged of its ignorance, then must. the angel descend.</p>  
<p>4. He made Himself master of me and I of Him, and each of us hath possessed the other.</p>  
<p>5. My being His property is evident, and my possessing Him is (proved by) His saying, 'Come hither.'</p>  
<p>6. O camel-driver, let us turn aside and do not lead the travellers past D&aacute;r al-Falak.</p>  
<p>7. A house on a river-bank near al-Musann&aacute; caused thee to fall sick and did not make thee forget thy sickness.</p>  
<p>8. Would that the lord of desire had laid on thee (O my censor!) my pain and the burden of love that was laid on me!</p>  
<p>9. For neither Zar&uacute;d nor H&aacute;jir nor Salam is an abode that emaciated thee.</p>  
<p>10. From the burning grief of the journey (towards Him) thou wert seeking the rain-clouds of union, but they did not o&#8217;ershadow thee.</p>

<p>1. 'The suns are in the heavenly sphere,' i.e. the Divine radiance is in the heart.</p>  
<p>2. Cf. Kor. xv, 29, and xx, 4.</p>  
<p>3. 'The angel,' i.e. the most sublime spiritual essences.</p>  
<p>4. 'He made Himself master of me,' inasmuch as I am limited by Him.</p>  
<p>'And I of Him,' inasmuch as the Divine Names are manifested only in contingent being.</p>  
<p>5. 'Come hither' (Kor. xii, 23), i.e. in order that the Names may be manifested, which is impossible unless I receive them.</p>  
<p>6-7. 'Dar al-Falak,' a convent for pious women at Baghd&aacute;d on the bank of the Tigris near al-Musann&aacute;, which is the residence of the Im&aacute;m&#8212;on whom be peace! The author refers to the heart, because it is the Temple of Divine manifestation.</p>  
<p>'Al-Musann&aacute;,' the station of the Qu&#7789;b, since it was the Caliph's palace.</p>  
<p>'To fall sick,' i.e. to fall in love.</p>  
<p>'And did not make thee forget thy sickness,' i.e. gave thee no relief.</p>  
<p>9. He says that the passion of his soul was not kindled by anything contingent or finite.</p>
