*The Tarjuman al-Ashwaq*, by Ibn al-Arabi, tr. Reynold A. Nicholson,
\[1911\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### L

1\. Oh, the traitress! She has left bitten by her viper-like locks one
who would fain approach her,

2\. And she bends her soft eye and melts him and leaves him sick on his
bed.

3\. She shot the arrows of her glances from the bow of an eyebrow, and
on whatever side I came I was killed.

#### COMMENTARY

1\. 'The traitress,' i.e. a deceitful Attribute, which caused one who
sought her to become enamoured of the mysterious sciences derived from
the Divine majesty and beauty.

2\. 'His bed,' i.e. his body.

3\. He describes the 'passing away' produced by contemplation of the
Divine Ideas.
