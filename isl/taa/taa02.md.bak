### PREFACE

<span class="smallcaps">Whatever</span> view may be taken of the
respective merits of Arabic and Persian poetry, I think it will
generally be allowed by those familiar with the mystical literature of
both nations that the Arabs excel in prose rather than in verse, while
the Persian prose-writers on this subject cannot be compared with the
poets. Farídu’ddín ‘Aṭṭár, Jalálu’ddín Rúmí, Ḥáfiẓ, and Jámi—to mention
only a few of the great Persian poets whose works, translated into
various languages, have introduced the religious philosophy of Ṣúfiism
to a rapidly widening circle of European culture—are as much superior to
their Arab rivals, including even the admirable Ibn al-Fáriḍ, as the
*Futúḥát al-Makkiyya* and the *Fuṣúṣ al-Ḥikam* are superior to similar
treatises in Persian. The *Tarjumán al-Ashwáq* is no exception to this
rule. The obscurity of its style and the strangeness of its imagery will
satisfy those austere spirits for whom literature provides a refined and
arduous form of intellectual exercise, but the sphere in which the
author moves is too abstract and remote from common experience to give
pleasure to others who do not share his visionary temper or have not
themselves drawn inspiration from the same order of ideas. Nevertheless,
the work of such a bold and subtle genius deserves, at any rate, to be
studied, and students will find, as a reward for their labour, many
noble and striking thoughts and some passages of real beauty. The
following lines are often quoted. They express the Ṣúfí doctrine that
all ways lead to the One God.

'My heart has become capable of every form; it is a pasture for gazelles
and a convent for Christian monks,  
And a temple for idols and the pilgrim's Ka‘ba and the tables of the
Tora and the book of the Koran.  
I follow the religion of Love: whatever way Love's camels take, that is
my religion and my faith.' <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

The present edition was designed in the first instance for the Journal
of the Royal Asiatic Society, and is now published in its original
shape. I will not repeat or expand what I have said in my brief
introduction concerning the date of composition, the different
recensions of the text, the method of interpretation, and the general
character of these remarkable odes, but it may be useful to indicate in
a few words some of the principal theories which are shadowed forth
symbolically in the text and revealed more explicitly in the author's
commentary. Although the *Tarjumán al-Ashwáq* affords material for an
essay on Ibn al-‘Arabí's theosophy, I feel, speaking for myself, that
further study of his works is necessary before such a task can be
attempted with advantage. Much valuable information is contained in a
treatise on Monism by Ali b. Sultan Muḥammad al-Qárí al-Harawí <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)—a polemic directed against Ibn al-‘Arabí and
his followers who held that all Being is essentially one with God,
notwithstanding its apparent diversity. This pamphlet was written in
answer to a champion of Ibn al-‘Arabí, who had collected under
twenty-four heads various passages in the *Futúḥát* and the *Fuṣúṣ* to
which objection was taken by orthodox theologians, and had endeavoured
to justify the author against his critics. ‘Alí al-Qárí regards Ibn
al-‘Arabí as a dangerous infidel and gives him no quarter. Of course the
offending passages admit of more than one interpretation, and the author
would doubtless have repudiated the construction put upon them by
theologians. Their pantheistic import, however, cannot be explained
away. I have classified the following examples for the sake of
convenience and have added a few references to the commentary on the
*Tarjumán*.

1\. *God and the World*. Ibn al-‘Arabí says in the *Futúḥát*, 'Glory to
God who brought all things into existence, being Himself their substance
(\#\#\#). He is the

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

substance of every object in manifestation, although He is not the
substance of objects in their essences.' <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) And again, in the *Fuṣúṣ*, 'God manifests
Himself in every atom of creation: He is revealed in every intelligible
object and concealed from every intelligence except the intelligence of
those who say that the Universe is His form and ipseity (\#\#\#),
inasmuch as He stands in the same relation to phenomenal objects as the
spirit to the body.'

2\. *God and Man*. 'Man is the form of God and God is the spirit of
Man.' 'Man is to God as the pupil to the eye: by means of him God
beholds the objects which He has created.' 'Man's origin is both
temporal and eternal; he is an organism durable and everlasting.' 'Man
is the substance of every attribute wherewith he endows God: when he
contemplates God he contemplates himself, and God contemplates Himself
when He contemplates Man. Hence Abú Sa‘íd al-Kharráz said that he was a
face and tongue of God, who is called by the name of Abú Sa‘íd
al-Kharráz and also by other temporal names, because God unites all
opposites in Himself.'

God dwells in the heart of Man (vi, 1), and Man, invested with Divine
qualities, is a mirror which displays God to Himself (x, 2). Divine
qualities may justly be attributed to anyone who is so transported from
himself that God becomes his eye and his ear (x, 1). Although union with
God is not possible while the body exists (v, 2), Ibn al-‘Arabí, like
Plotinus, holds that 'deification' is attainable (xxiv, 3). <span
id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md) Elsewhere he says that knowledge of God is
the utmost goal that can be reached by any contingent being (xvii, 5).
This knowledge is gained solely by means of Faith and Contemplation,
which Reason may serve if it consents to lay aside its reflective
faculty (iii, 2, 5). What, then, is the end of knowledge? Apparently, a
state of Nirvana or transcendental unconsciousness, \#\#\#

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (v, 6). The
phenomenal vanishes in presence of the Eternal (xx, 19).

3\. *Religion*. Since all things are a manifestation of the Divine
substance, it follows that God may be worshipped in a star or a calf or
any other object, and that no form of positive religion contains more
than a portion of the truth. 'Do not attach yourself,' Ibn al-‘Arabí
says, 'to any particular creed exclusively, so that you disbelieve in
all the rest; otherwise you will lose much good, nay, you will fail to
recognize the real truth of the matter. Let your soul be capable of
embracing all forms of belief. God, the omnipresent and omnipotent, is
not limited by any one creed, for He says, "Wheresoever ye turn, there
is the face of Allah" (Kor. ii, 109); and the face of a thing is its
reality.' It is vain to quarrel about religion. 'Everyone praises what
he believes; his god is his own creature, and in praising it he praises
himself. Consequently he blames the beliefs of others, which he would
not do if he were just, but his dislike is based on ignorance. If he
knew Junayd's saying—"the water takes its colour from the vessel
containing it"—he would not interfere with the beliefs of others, but
would perceive God in every form and in every belief.' <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) The Divine substance remains unchanged and
unchangeable amidst all the variety of religious experience. 'Those who
worship God in the sun behold a sun, and those who worship Him in living
things see a living thing, and those who worship Him in inanimate
objects see an inanimate object, and those who worship Him as a Being
unique and unparalleled see that which has no like' (xii, 13). In a
noteworthy passage Ibn al-‘Arabí seeks to harmonize Islam with
Christianity. The Christian Trinity, he says, is essentially a Unity
which has its counterpart in the three cardinal Names whereby God is
signified in the Koran, viz. Allah, ar-Raḥmán, and ar-Rabb (xii, 4).
Islam is peculiarly the religion of Love (xi, 15), and God's mercy is
denied to none, be he Moslem or infidel, who invokes Him in the
extremity of his need. Even if it

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

so be that the unbelievers shall remain in Hell for ever, they will at
last feel its fiery torments a pleasure and delight. Ibn al-‘Arabí is
said to have claimed that he was the Seal of the Saints, as Muḥammad was
the Seal of the Prophets, and also that the Saints are superior to the
Prophets, but it is very doubtful whether these accusations are well
founded. He seems to have maintained that the Prophets, in so far as
they are Saints, derive their knowledge from the Seal of the Saints, and
that the Prophets in virtue of their saintship are superior to the
Prophets in virtue of their prophetic dignity (cf. iv, i; xviii, 8). He
does assert, however, that he had reached a spiritual degree which was
not attained by any of his peers (xxiv, 4).

I desire gratefully to acknowledge the valuable assistance of Sir
Charles Lyall, who read the text and translation in manuscript, and made
a number of suggestions, nearly all of which I have inserted in the book
while it was passing through the press. The fact that it has undergone
his criticism enables me to offer it to students of Arabic poetry with
more confidence than would otherwise have been possible. My thanks are
due also to the Librarian of the University of Leiden, who caused two
MSS. of the *Tarjumán* to be sent to Cambridge, and allowed them to
remain there as long as they were required.
