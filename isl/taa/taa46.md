### XLIII

1\. Let me never forget my abode at Wána and my saying to camel-riders
as they departed and arrived,

2\. 'Stay beside us a while that we may be comforted thereby, for I
swear by those whom I love that I am consoled (by thinking of you).'

3\. If they set out they will journey with the most auspicious omen, and

4\. ’Twas in the glen of the valley of Qanát I met them, and my last
sight of them was between an-Naqá and al-Mushalshal.

5\. They watch every place where the camels find pasturage, but they pay

6\. O camel-driver, have pity on a youth whom you see breaking colocynth
when he bids farewell,

7\. Laying his palms crosswise on his bosom to still a heart that

8\. They say, 'Patience!' but grief is not patient. What can I do, since
patience is far from me?

9\. Even if I had patience and were ruled by it, my soul would not be
patient. How, therefore, when I have it not?

5\. 'Every place where the camels find pasturage,' i.e. the objects to
which our aspirations tend.

6\. 'O camel-driver': he addresses the Divine voice which calls the
aspirations towards it.

7\. 'Breaking colocynth,' i.e. having his face distorted with anguish
(for when colocynth is broken its pungent smell

causes the eyes to water). Imru’u ’l-Qays says (cf. Ahlwardt, *The
Díwáns*, 204, No. 26): \#\#\#
