### VIII

1\. Their abodes have become decayed, but desire of them is ever new in
my heart and decayeth not.

2\. These tears are shed over their ruined dwellings, but souls are ever
melted at the memory of them.

3\. Through love of them I called out behind their riding-camels, 'O ye
who are rich in beauty, here am I, a beggar!

4\. I have rolled my cheek in the dust in tender and passionate
affection: then, by the true love which I owe to you, I, do not make
hopeless

5\. One who is drowned in his tears and burned in the fire of sorrow
with no respite!'

6\. O thou who wouldst kindle a fire, be not hasty! Here is the fire of
passion. Go and take of it!

#### COMMENTARY

1\. 'Their abodes have become decayed': he says, 'the places of
austerities and mortifications, where the Divine Names made works
(\#\#\#) their abode, have become decayed through age and loss of
youthful strength.' The word \#\#\# is used in reference to the
springtide (\#\#\#) of human life.

3\. 'Behind their riding-camels,' i.e. the powers of youth and the
delights of the commencement (\#\#\#).

4\. 'I have rolled my cheek in the dust,' i.e. desiring to be united
with you, for God says, 'Seek access to Me by means of that which I have
not,' viz. abasement and indigence.

6\. 'Here is the fire of passion,' i.e. in my heart.
