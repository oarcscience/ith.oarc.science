### Qur'an

The Qur'an is the primary text of Islam, revealed to the Prophet
Muhammed beginning in the year 610 C.E. It was canonicalized between 644
and 656. The Qur'an is required reading for anyone who wants to
understand Islam. Qur'an means "The Recital" in Arabic; according to the
story, the angel Gabriel commanded Muhammed to "Recite!".

<span id="hadith"></span>

### Hadith

The Hadith, second only to the Qur'an in importance and authority, are
collections of Islamic traditions and laws (*Sunna*). This includes
traditional sayings of Muhammed and later Islamic sages. By the ninth
century over 600,000 Hadith had been recorded; these were later edited
down to about 25,000.

### <span id="sufi">Sufi Texts</span>

Sufism is a mystical Islamic belief system. It is renowned for its
contributions to world literature: beautiful symbolic poetry and
devotional story-telling, much of which was translated in the 19th
century by European scholars and travellers.

**<span id="note">IMPORTANT NOTE</span>**

It is our policy to preserve the original text and titles of books
transcribed for this site. This has some theological implications in
this section. Some Muslims do not believe that any text other than the
actual Arabic text of the Quran (even a transliteration or an Arabic
text with vowels) can strictly be called 'the Qur'an'. This is because
the Arabic text is considered canonical and there can be no other
versions of it. The phrase 'the meaning of the Quran' is typically used
to describe texts which would otherwise be described as 'translations'.
Please be aware of this issue where this site presents or refers to a
'translation,' 'translator' or 'transliteration' of the Quran. In
addition, many of these books were originally written by Europeans
during the 19th century and use the term 'Mohammedan' to refer to
Muslims (by analogy with 'Buddhist,' 'Christian' etc.) Most Muslims
deprecate this term today because the founder of Islam is considered a
human prophet, rather than an entity to be worshipped, as the term could
be taken to imply. In the interest of archival accuracy this terminology
has been retained in the etexts; in text that we've written, we have
attempted to avoid it, except in quotations. No disrespect to Islam or
Muslims is intended thereby.
