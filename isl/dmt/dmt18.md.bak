### I

### ASH-SHAHRASTANI ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF MUSLIM SECTS

Then I applied myself to what of arrangement was easy of attainment and
to what of attainment was easy of arrangement, until I had crowded them
\[the different opinions\] into four fundamentals, which are the great
principles. The first fundamental concerns the Qualities (*sifat*) with
the Unity (*tawhid*); it embraces the question of the eternal (*azali*)
Qualities, affirmed by some and denied by others, and of the exposition
of the essential Qualities (*sifat adh-dhat*) and of the active
Qualities (*sifat al-fi‘l*) and of what is necessary in God Most High
and what is possible for Him and what is impossible; it involves the
controversies between the Ash‘arites and the Karramites and the
Anthropomorphists (*mujassims*) and the Mu‘tazilites. The second
fundamental concerns decree (*qadar*) and justice (*adl*); it embraces
the question of destiny (*qada*) and decree (*qadar*); of force (*jabr*)
and acquisition

(*kasb*); of the willing of good and of evil and of the decreed and the
known, affirmed by some and denied by others; it involves the
controversies between the Qadarites and Najjarites and Jabarites and
Ash‘arites and Karramites. The third fundamental concerns promise
(*wa‘d*) and the decisions (*hukms*); it embraces the question of faith
(*iman*) and repentance (*tawba*) and threatening (*wa‘id*) and
postponing (*irja*) and pronouncing anyone an unbeliever (*takfir*) and
leading anyone astray (*tadlil*), affirmed by some and denied by others;
it involves the controversies between the Murji’ites and the Wa‘idites
and the Mu‘tazilites and the Ash‘arites and the Karramites. The fourth
fundamental concerns tradition (*sam*) and reason (*aql*) and the
prophetic mission (*risala*) and the imamate; it embraces the questions
of the determination of actions as good (*tahsin*) or vile (*taqbih*);
of the advantageous (*salah*) and most advantageous (*aslah*); of
benignity (*lutf*); of the prophets being guarded against sin (*isma*);
of the condition of the imamate, by statute (*nass*) according to some
and by agreement (*ijma*) according to others, and how it is transferred
on the view of those who say it is by statute, and how it is fixed on
the view of those who say it is by agreement; it involves the
controversies between the Shi‘ites and the Kharijites and the
Mu‘tazilites and the Karramites and the Ash‘arites.--*Translated from
Cureton's Arabic text, p*. 4.
