### INTRODUCTION

SHAIKH MUSLIH-UD-DIN SADI, the celebrated Persian poet, was born at
Shiraz between the years 1175 and 1193 of the Christian era. His father,
whose name was Abdullah, is generally supposed to have held some minor
post about the Court of the Atabak ruler of Fars, by name Sa’d bin Zangi
(A.D. 1195–1226), from whom was derived the poetical *nom de plume* of
Sadi.

He commenced his studies in his native city, whence after a while he
removed to the Muhammadan College of Baghdad, where it chanced that a
rich native gentleman, being informed of the young student's

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

want of means, befriended the lad, who was fortunate enough to obtain
assistance, also, from a Professor in the College. In due course Sadi
gained a fellowship. He thereupon abandoned himself to a contemplative
life and the study of divinity, while his pious and devotional
aspirations found vent in a pilgrimage to Mecca—an act of holy zeal
which he repeated no less than fourteen times, chiefly on foot. Of a
religious disposition, Sadi in due course obtained a reputation for
holiness, which culminated in the title of "Shaikh" (a man of dignity
and position), by which he became generally known. For many years his
life was devoted largely to travel; this, indeed, may be gathered from
his own words: "I have wandered to various regions of the world, and
everywhere have I mixed freely with the inhabitants. I have gathered
something in each corner,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I have gleaned an
ear from every harvest." <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

On another occasion we learn from his own narrative that he was so
enraged at the pagan rites practised at the renowned temple of Somnath
in Gujarat that he incontinently threw the priest headlong into a well.

An anecdote related by himself reveals the next important event in his
career. "Weary of the society of my friends at Damascus, I fled to the
barren wastes of Jerusalem and associated with brutes, until I was made
captive by the Franks, <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) and forced to
dig clay, along with Jews, in the fortifications of Tripoli. One of

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

the nobles of Aleppo, my ancient friend, happened to pass that way, and
recollected me. He said, 'What a state is this to be in! how farest
thou?' I answered, 'Seeing that I could place confidence in God alone, I
retired to the mountains and wilds, to avoid the society of man. But
judge what must be my situation, now that I am confined in a stall in
company with wretches who deserve not the name of men. To be chained by
the feet with friends is better than to be free to walk in a garden with
strangers.' He took compassion on my forlorn condition, ransomed me from
the Franks for ten dinars, and took me with him to Aleppo. My friend had
a daughter, to whom he married me, and presented me with one hundred
dinars <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

as her dower. After some time my wife unveiled her disposition, which
was ill-tempered, quarrelsome, obstinate, and abusive; so that the
happiness of my life vanished. It has been well said, 'A bad woman in
the house of a virtuous man is his hell—even in this world.' Take care
how you connect yourself with a bad woman. Save us, O Lord, from this
fiery trial!"

Sadi was an adept at repartee—two instances will suffice. Once his wife
reproached him with the following taunt: "Art not thou the creature whom
my father ransomed from captivity amongst the Franks for ten dinars?"
"Yes," was the rejoinder; "he redeemed me for ten dinars, and enslaved
me to you for a hundred."

On another occasion, when a poet at Tabriz, taking offence at the
intrusion of

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

his rival Sadi, asked the latter, somewhat abruptly, "Whence come you?"
"From the delightful soil of Shiraz," was the rejoinder. "Indeed," was
the sarcastic retort of the questioner; "the Shirazis in Tabriz are more
numerous than dogs." "The very reverse of our city," so spake the
quick-witted poet of Shiraz, "where Tabrizis are of less account than
dogs." The contest of satire was not however at an end, and after a
pause the man of Tabriz renewed the attack by drawing attention to the
baldness of his rival's head. Turning up a vessel that chanced to be in
his hand, "How comes it," said he, "that the heads of the Shirazis are
bald like the bottom of this bowl?" "By the same rule," was the prompt
and bitter rejoinder, "that the heads of the Tabrizis are as empty as
the hollow of the bowl."

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

Nothing daunted by the misfortunes attendant on his first marriage, Sadi
during his travels in Arabia wedded a second spouse, with whom it may
perhaps be surmised he lived on affectionate terms—judging, at least,
from the anguish of soul with which he recorded the death of his
youthful child, the offspring of this union.

It is, however, open to doubt whether Sadi experienced a very large
measure of domestic happiness, inasmuch as in one of his poems he gives
the advice, "Choose a fresh wife every spring—on New Year's Day; for the
almanack of last year is good for nothing."

His liberality in entertaining guests was so great and lavish, that on
one occasion a rival poet, whom he had regaled with most princely
hospitality, despairing of returning in any adequate manner the profuse
generosity of his former host,

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

set before the man of letters, now a guest, the plainest and simplest of
dishes. The explanation of this proceeding was couched in somewhat
remarkable language. "I should have found great difficulty in giving you
even one day's dinner in the sumptuous style that reigned at your
hospitable board during the three days which I had the happiness of
passing with you. But in this, my economical mode of entertainment, I
could indulge myself for years in the pleasure of your society, without
feeling the expense."

In the latter part of his life Sadi retired to a cell near Shiraz, where
he passed his time in pious devotions, and in receiving visits from the
noblest of the land.

"It was the custom of his illustrious visitants," writes Sir Gore
Ouseley, "to take with them meats and all kinds of viands, of which,
when Sadi and his

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

company had partaken, the Shaikh always put what remained in a basket
suspended from his window, that the poor woodcutters of Shiraz, who
daily passed his cell, might occasionally satisfy their hunger. It is
said, and firmly believed in Persia, that one day a man dressed as a
wood-cutter approached the basket, with the intent of plundering, but
ere his hand reached its contents it dried up and withered. Concluding
that it was a miracle worked by the Shaikh, the offender cried out to
him for assistance. The holy man, in a reproving tone, said, 'If thou
art a wood-cutter, where are thy blistered hands, thy wounds from
thorns, and thy labour-worn frame? Or if a robber, where is thy
climbing-rope, thy arms, and thy hardened boldness that should have
restrained thee from thus moaning and crying?' He however took
compassion on the hapless culprit, offered

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

up a prayer for the restoration of his arm, and even bestowed upon him,
with a proper admonition, a portion of the viands which he had in vain
attempted to carry off by stealth."

When the Atabaks were replaced by the Mughal dynasty of Persia (A.D.
1256), it chanced that the military commander of Shiraz compelled the
greengrocers and market people of the city to purchase at the hands of
their rulers, for a large amount, some dates which had but a nominal
value. The matter was brought to the notice of Shaikh Sadi, who
thereupon addressed a letter in verse to the Mughal governor, pointing
out that the poet's brother was so poor that "he has no trousers on his
legs, and yet he has been compelled to buy dates at an exorbitant price.
A worse misfortune than this," it was added, "there is not." The appeal
was successful, and

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

not only were dates given free of charge to the Shaikh's impoverished
brother, but "a paltry sum" was placed at his disposal as a gift from
the governor on "learning that the man was poor."

When the second of the Mughal monarchs of Persia ascended the throne
(A.D. 1265) he chanced one day, in company with some of his ministers,
to meet Sadi, and was astonished to find that the poet received at the
hands of these ministers more consideration than was extended to
himself, albeit a royal personage. Enquiring the cause of a circumstance
so strange, his Majesty was asked in return whether he had not heard of
the great Shaikh whose poetry was famous throughout the world. The
result was that the Shaikh was summoned to the royal presence and
requested to "give some counsel." "Thou canst bear nothing with thee
from this world to the next,"

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

was the rejoinder, "save a recompense or a punishment, and the choice
now rests with thee." The monarch felt the reproach, so the Shaikh on
leaving whispered in the royal ear the following verses:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"A monarch is the shadow of God;  
 The shadow should be a close companion of its substance.  
 The vulgar soul is incapable of good, If the sword be not king.  
 All the right that appears in the world  
 Is evidence of the monarch's rectitude.  
 A kingdom derives no advantage from him  
 Whose every thought is an error."

</div>

During the same reign one of the ministers submitted to Sadi five
questions, to which a reply was invited. (1) Is a demon or a man the
better? (2) How should I act if my enemy will not be reconciled to me

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (3) Is one who
performs the pilgrimage to Mecca better than one who has neglected that
duty? (4) Is a descendant of Ali <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)
better than other people? (5) Would the poet be pleased to accept a
present of a turban and 500 dinars as subsistence money for his birds?
The messenger, the bearer of the letter, thought that he might with
advantage be considered as one of the "birds," and accordingly put into
his own pocket 150 dinars, leaving a balance of no more than 350 dinars.
The reply of Sadi, which betokened that he had detected the theft, ran
thus:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Thou hast sent me an honoured present and money.  
 May thy wealth increase, and thine enemies be trodden under foot!  
 For each dinar may a year of life be thine, <span id="page_22">p.
22</span>  
 So that thou mayest continue to live three hundred and fifty years."

</div>

On receipt of this poetic effusion the minister gave an order on the
treasury for no less than 10,000 dinars; but the treasurer had in the
meantime passed away, a circumstance which the poet brought to the
notice of his patron. When the latter learnt what had occurred, he
increased the donation to no less than 50,000 dinars, with a suggestion
that some portion of the money should be devoted to the erection of a
house at Shiraz for the accommodation of travellers. Four of the
questions propounded appear to have remained unanswered.

Shaikh Sadi died at a very advanced age in Shiraz, A.D. 1291. His tomb,
originally held in much esteem and decked with extracts from his own
poems, has more

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

or less fallen into decay, though enough it is believed remains to mark
the resting-place of one of Persia's most gifted poets and men of
letters.

"Sadi," such is the description of him by a native annalist, "was short,
and not very handsome. His head was extremely long, truly indicative of
a grave and saintly aspect. His dress was eminently simple, consisting
of a turban, a long blue gown worn over his undercoat, and a stick in
his hand. The character of this venerable bard was highly noble and
becoming a great person. He was extremely courteous and affable to his
friends, and generous towards his enemies. In wit he surpassed every
author of his age, and his humour was so successful that he could make
the most silent and melancholy face laugh in his company. He was a boy
among the circle of experienced youths, a sage among a society of

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

divines. In a word, he was an accomplished scholar, an excellent master
of pure Persian eloquence, an unsullied instructor of divinity, and a
consummate painter of life and manners."

The works by which Shaikh Sadi—"the nightingale of a thousand songs"—is
best known are:

\(a\) The *Bustan*, an exquisite poem embodying moral precepts and rules
of life;

\(b\) The *Gulistan*, possibly the most widely read book in Persian
literature. Well indeed did Eastwick, when publishing a translation of
this charming volume, write, "The school-boy lisps out his first lessons
in it, the man of learning quotes it, and a vast number of the
expressions have become proverbial. When we consider, indeed, the time
in which it was written the first half of the

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

thirteenth century—a time when gross darkness brooded over Europe, at
least darkness which might have been, but, alas! was not felt the
justness of many of its sentiments, and the glorious views of the Divine
attributes contained in it, are truly remarkable,"

\(c\) The *Pand Namah*, or *Scroll of Wisdom*, <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) a small volume of poetry embodying precepts
which would do no discredit to the philosophy of this, the twentieth
century of the Christian era. Concise and elegant, the work is most
popular throughout the length and breadth of the Persian-speaking East.
This may indeed well be the case, inasmuch as, in addition to beauty of
diction, it is written in a metre which flows in easy cadence, and fixes
the words

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

of the poem on the mind. Hence the lines are committed to memory to an
extent that is probably not surpassed by any work in the Persian
language. Byron's lines known as the "Lover's Last Adieu" may be quoted
as an example of rhythm identical with that of Sadi's *Scroll of
Wisdom*. The two may with advantage be quoted side by side.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The roses of love glad the garden of life."  
"Karima ba bakhsha ya bar hal i-ma."

</div>

It only remains to add that no translation of *The Scroll of Wisdom* has
been published in this country during the last hundred years (Gladwin's
text—in itself somewhat imperfect was issued with an appended
translation in 1801), though in Bombay some twenty years ago in

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indian scholar
rendered it into English. Both works are out of print, and for all
practical purposes it may be said that a translation is not procurable
by the British public. Perhaps, therefore, no apology is needed for the
present work.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[11:1](ssw03.htm#fr_0.md) Well indeed may he have
penned these words, inasmuch as he traversed Asia Minor, Barbary,
Abyssinia, Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Armenia, Arabia, the various
provinces of Iran, and portions of India. Even in these days of extended
travel Sadi's wanderings would not be without repute.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[11:2](ssw03.htm#fr_1.md) That is the Crusaders.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[12:1](ssw03.htm#fr_2.md) In the coinage of the
present day, 100 dinars are worth about one penny of English money; but
in Sadi's time a dinar was equivalent to about 7 or 8 shillings.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[21:1](ssw03.htm#fr_3.md) The son-in-law of the
Prophet, and the first caliph according to the tenets of the Persians.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[25:1](ssw03.htm#fr_4.md) It may, however, be
explained that the earlier MSS. do not contain this work, which was
first ascribed to Sadi about A.D. 1438.
