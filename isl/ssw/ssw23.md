### IN EXPLANATION OF PATIENCE

If patience is thy helper  
Thou wilt attain everlasting happiness.  
Patience is the attribute of prophets;  
Those who practise religion turn not aside from this direction.  
Patience openeth the door of the desires of friends,  
For save patience there is no key for them.  
Patience giveth thee the desire of thine heart,  
For at the hands of mankind thy difficulties are solved.  
Patience is best in every case,  
For in this sentence is much meaning. <span id="page_55">p. 55</span>  
Patience giveth thee thy desire,  
It relieveth thee from pain and misfortune.  
Patience is the key of the door of thine aspirations,  
The enlarger of the kingdom of desire.  
Exercise patience if thou art religious,  
For haste is the attribute of devils.
