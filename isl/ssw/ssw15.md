### IN CONDEMNATION OF OPPRESSION

The world witnesseth desolation owing to failure of justice,  
As it were a beautiful garden from the autumn gale.  
Do not give way to oppression in any case,  
Lest the sun of monarchy suffer decline.  
He who raiseth the fire of oppression in the world  
Occasioneth a sigh on the part of the people of the land.  
If a tyrant raiseth a sigh from the soul  
The anguish createth a flame over land and water.  
Do not oppress poor helpless people,  
Without further thought as to the narrowness of the grave.  
Be not disposed towards the market-place of oppression; <span
id="page_43">p. 43</span>  
Be not neglectful of the smoke of men's hearts.  
O man of haste! be not an oppressor of humanity,  
For of a sudden the wrath of God will overtake thee.  
Do not oppress the poor humble people,  
For without doubt the tyrant passeth to perdition.
