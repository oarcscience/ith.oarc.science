### ON THE VICISSITUDES OF FORTUNE AND DIFFERENCES OF STATION

Regard this globe, resplendent like gold,  
The roof of which is firm without pillars!  
Regard the curtain of the revolving sphere!  
Regard its glittering lamps! <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12)  
One is a shepherd, and another a sovereign;  
One is a suppliant for justice, another covets a throne;  
One is happy, and another miserable;  
One is prosperous, and another unfortunate;  
One is a payer of taxes, and another sits on a throne;  
One is exalted, and another debased;  
One sitteth on a mat, and another upon a throne;  
One is in rags, and another is clad in silk;  
One hath no bread, and another revels in wealth; <span id="page_58">p.
58</span>  
One is disappointed, and another prosperous;  
One is afflicted, and another rolleth in riches;  
One hath a transient fate, and another is established throughout
eternity;  
One is full of health, and another is sickly;  
One is full of years, and another is a mere stripling;  
One is filled with righteousness, and another lives in sin;  
One is given to prayer, and another is addicted to deceit;  
One is upright and religious,  
Another is immersed in an ocean of crime and wickedness;  
One is of good disposition, and another is of hasty temper;  
One is patient, and another is quarrelsome;  
One is at ease, another in pain;  
One is in difficulties, another is prosperous;  
One is a chieftain in the world of luxury, <span id="page_59">p.
59</span>  
Another is a captive in the snares of adversity;  
One is established in the rose garden of comfort,  
Another is associated with anguish, pain, and distress;  
One is like a rose resplendent with joy,  
Another is distressed at heart, and pained in soul;  
One girdeth his loins with obedience,  
Another bringeth his life to an end in sin;  
One passeth day and night with the Koran in his hands,  
Another sleepeth intoxicated in the corner of a wine shop;  
One is fixed firm as a peg at the door of religion,  
Another is a sinner in the way of infidelity;  
One is prosperous, learned, and intelligent,  
Another is unfortunate, ignorant, and abashed; <span id="page_60">p.
60</span>  
One is a champion, agile, and a warrior,  
Another is faint-hearted, indolent, and without courage;  
One exceedeth all limits in the possession of wealth,  
Another is in want of bread and means for his family;  
One hath the taper of joy resplendent,  
To another bright daylight is as night.
