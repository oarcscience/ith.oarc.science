# ON DREAMS OF HANDICRAFTSMEN.

A cook means great riches, just as a butcher means that one's affairs
are. ruined. A physician is pain and sickness, especially to one who is
wretched and needy. The tailor is the man in virtue of whom troubles and
affliction are all changed to good-fortune. A bootmaker and shoemaker
and cobbler are among the heritages of one who will possess a secret. A
draper, a goldsmith, and a druggist mean a successful undertaking and
great wealth. A vintner, a musician, and a dancer bring, joy and
gladness; a horse-doctor and horse-breaker and oculist point like a
finger-post to ruin. To see a hunter in a dream brings trickery and
deceit into one's path. A maker of swords indicates affliction; so too
an arrow-maker, preparing arrows. A water-carrier, a potter, and a
porter, all three are to be considered as indicating wealth.
