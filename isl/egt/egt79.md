# \[OF HIS MERCY.\]

Malice and rancour are far removed from His attributes: for hate belongs
to him who is under command. It is not permissible

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

to speak of anger in respect of God, for God has no quality of anger;
anger and hatred are both due to constraint by superior force, and both
qualities are far distant from God. Anger and passion and reconciliation
and hatred and malice are not among the attributes of the one sole God;
from God the Creator all is mercy; He is the Veiler of His slaves; of
His mercy He gives thee counsel; He draws thee to Himself by the
kindness of the noose. If thou comest not, He calls thee towards
Himself, He offers thee Paradise in His kindness, but because thou
livest in this abode of sorrow thou of thy folly hast taken the road of
flight. Thou art as a shell for the pearl of the belief in the Unity;
thou art a successor of the newly-created Adam; if thou lose that pearl
of thy belief, in being dispossessed of it thou wilt be parted from thy
substance; but if thou guard that pearl, thou shalt raise thy head
beyond the seven (*planets*) and the four (*elements*); thou shalt reach
eternal happiness, and no created thing shall harm thee; thou shalt be
exalted in the present time, and upon the plain of eternity thou shalt
be as a hawk; thy alighting-place shall be the hand of kings, thy feet
shall be freed from the depths of the, mire.
