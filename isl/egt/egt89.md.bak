# ON THE GREATNESS OF THE QUR'ÂN,--VERILY IT CONSISTS NOT IN ITS DIVISION INTO 'TENS' AND 'FIVES.'

To attract a handful of boys thou hast made its honour to consist in the
'tens,' and 'fives'; thou hast abrogated the authority of every

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

verse which abrogates another, art still unlearned in its doctrines the
intricate passages seem to thee plain, while in its plain teachings thou
hast no faith; thou hast abandoned the light of the Qur'ân, and for the
sake of the multitude hast made its outward form the tool of thy
hypocrisy for a measure of barley and two plates of chaff. Now thou
intonest its cadences, now recitest its stories; sometimes thou makest
of it a weapon for strife; sometimes in thy irreverence throwest it into
disorder, sometimes esteemest it a prodigy; now thou interpretest it
according to thine own conjecture, and again determinest to the contrary
of that; now in thy fancy thou takest the conclusion of its passages for
the beginning, now absurdly turnest its meaning inside out; again thou
expoundest it by thine own opinion, and explainest it according to thine
own knowledge; amongst the thirty caskets of the Qur'ân thou wanderest
not except with railing.

Sometimes thou sayest to a foolish friend, perhaps a lazy clothweaver,
"If I write thee a charm, keep it clean, O youth, and soil it not; but
there must be a sacrifice in the morning,--the blood of a black bird is
required." All this deceit for a diram or two, a supper or a breakfast
for thy belly!

Thou hast wasted thy life in folly; what can I say? begone, and shame to
thee! Thou creepest into some mosque or other in thy appetite, thy
throat full of wind, like a pipe or a bell; shame on thy

religion and thy faith for this appetite! May either wisdom be thy
portion, or death! Shame on thee for such a nature, such accomplishments
and science,--they bring thee no esteem!
