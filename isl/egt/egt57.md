# ON DREAMS OF BEASTS.

An ass is a servant, but a lazy one, who refuses to work. A horse, O
thou of unparalleled wisdom! is a woman; both are suitable possessions
for a man. A mule is bad for him whose wife is pregnant; a child will
not be born to him. A journey comes to thee in a dream as a camel,--a
terrible journey, grievous and painful. A cow points to a year of
plenty; the owl grows arrogant before the king.
