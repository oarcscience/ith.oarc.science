# ON GIVING THANKS.

Ingratitude's only seat is the door of sorrow; thankfulness arrives with
certainty at the treasure. (Qur. 14:7) Utter thy thanks for the sake of
increase, of the hidden world, and of the sight of God; then when

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

thou hast become patient of His decree He will name thee 'giver of
thanks'; whoso presses forwards towards God, speaks not without uttering
his thanks to God. Who can tell the sweetness of giving thanks to Him?
Who can pierce the pearl of the celebration of His name? He bestows, and
He gives the reward; He speaks, and He imparts the answer. Whatsoever He
took away from thee of kindness or show of love, the same or more than
that He gives back to thee. (Qur. 2:100) If every hair became a tongue,
and each an interpreter at thanksgiving's door to swell thereby His
thanks, they could not utter due thanks for the divine grace of the
power to give thanks.

Then let men seek to give thanks for His mercies; if they utter them, it
is even through Him they do so,--body and soul drunk with His decree,
the heart singing "*O Lord, thanks!*" And if not, then as far as regards
the path of knowledge and prudence, woman and man, young and old, are
blind of eye in the world of lust, are naked of body like ants and
flies.
