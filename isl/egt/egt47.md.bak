# ON RENUNCIATION AND STRENUOUS ENDEAVOUR.

Whoso desires to be lord of his isolation and whoso seeks to guard his
seclusion, must take no ease within, nor adorn himself without;

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

that praise which is bestowed on outward seeming imports the abandonment
of true praise and adornment. The beggar asks bread at the door of the
king; so the lover begs food for his soul. On the path, naked and
fearless, he has cast water and fire and earth to the winds. Standing on
the plain of the signposts of time, what matter fools to him, what the
philosopher of the age? O brother, hold thy liver as roast meat in the
fire of renunciation, not a broth. The mean-spirited dog seeks a bone;
the lion's whelp seeks the marrow of life. The lovers have sacrificed
soul and heart, and day and night have made His memory their food.

The man of high resolves seeks not bondage; a dog is a dog, made happy
by a bite.

If revelation become a restraint on thee, make of it a shoe and beat thy
head with it; talk fewer superfluities, and keep thy weakness before
thee; leave the bone to the dogs. In virtue of thy essential nature thou
hast obtained a high station; then why be mean in spirit like a dog? On
the man of high endeavour both worlds are bestowed; but whoso is
mean-spirited like a dog, like a dog runs about after a meal.

If thou desirest to possess thy soul free from the body, *Lâ* is as a
gallows,--keep company with it. How can pure Divinity admit thee till
thy humanity has been uplifted on the gallows?--for on the path to
divinity thy souls will suffer many crucifixions. Put an end to all
imitation and speculation, that thy heart may become the house of God.
As long as thy existence is with thee in thy soul, the ka\`ba is a
tavern, though thou serve Him; but if thy soul has parted from thy
existence, through thee an idol temple becomes the Inhabited House.

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

O seeker of taverns, full of wretchedness, thou art but an ass's son,
and asses are thy fathers! Thy understanding is muddied with thy Self
and thy Existence; thy reason's sight is dark before that other world.
Thine own soul it is that distinguishes unbelief and true religion; of
necessity it colours thy vision. Selflessness is happy, selffulness most
unhappy; cast away the cat from under thy arm. In the Eternal, unbeliefs
and religions are not; such things exist not if the nature be pure.
