# ON CHARITY AND GIFTS.

Whatsoever thou hast, relinquish it for the sake of God; for charity is
the greater marvel when it comes from beggars. Bestow thy life and soul,
for the endeavour of the poor is the best gift of mortal clay; the
prince and chief of the family of the cloak was honoured by the Sûra
"*Does there not come*,"--such regard he found with God from those three
poor barley-cakes.
