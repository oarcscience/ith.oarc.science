# II.--MANUSCRIPTS AND LITHOGRAPHS.

I have used the following manuscripts and lithographs in the preparation
of the text:--

\(1\) Br. Mus. Add. 25329. Foll. 298, 7 ¾" x 4 ¾", 15 ll. 2 3/8" long,
in small Nestalik, with gold headings, dated Safar A.H. 890 (A.D. 1485)
\[Adam Clarke\].

There are marginal additions by two other hands; f. 1 is on different
paper, by a different and later hand. The letters \#, \#, \#, \# are
often not distinguished, \# never; \# and \# are often not distinguished
from \# and \#; the small letters are often without dots; the scribe
usually writes the modern undotted \# with three dots below. There are
large omissions as compared with later MSS. and the lithographs.

I denote this MS. by C.

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

\(2\) Br. Mus. Or. 358. Foll. 317, 6 ¾" x 3 ¾", 17 ll. 2" long, in small
Nestalik, in two gold-ruled columns, with two \`unvâns, apparently
written in the 16th cent. \[Geo. Wm. Hamilton\].

There are many marginal additions, mostly by one, a later, hand,: the
MS. as a whole has been subjected to a great many erasures and
corrections. The writing is good, the pointing of the letters fairly
complete; the scribe usually writes and the \# and \#, the \# rarely
appears with three dots below. The MS. contains the prefaces of Raqqâm
and of Sanâ'î himself, but, like the preceding, shows omissions as
compared with later MSS. and the lithographs.

I denote this MS. by H.

\(3\) Br. Mus. Add. 16777. Foll. 386, 10 ¾" x 6 ¼", 15 ll., 3 ½" long,
in fair Nestalik, with gold-ruled margins, dated A.H. 1076 (A.D. 1665)
\[Win. Yule\].

This is a clearly written MS., the pointing of the letters usually full,
\#, and, \# are frequently distinguished by their dots, and the pure \#
usually written with three dots below. Erasures are not frequent; the
marginal corrections usually by the original hand. This MS. gives a very
large number of divergent readings as compared with the others; its
order is very different from that of the others; it is, as regards its
extent, not so much defective as redundant, long passages appearing
twice, and some passages not to be found in any of my other sources are
also included. Some of these latter I have found in subsequent chapters
of the <u>H</u>adîqa, and it is possible that a more thorough search
might have shown that they are all contained there.

This MS. is denoted by M.

\(4\) Ind. Off. 918. Ff. 395, 2 coll. each ll. 15; Nasta\`lîk; the last
four pp. written by another hand; 9 ½" by 5 ½". Written at
I<u>s</u>fahân A.H. 1027 (A.D. 1618); occasional short glosses on the
margin.

A clearly written and well-preserved MS., closely related to the
following. The letters \# and \#, are frequently distinguished; the sign
*madda*, is usually omitted.

I denote this MS. by I.

\(5\) Ind. Off. 923. The description given in the Catalogue is as
follows --"Shar<u>h</u>-<u>H</u>adî<u>k</u>ah. The revised and collated
edition of Sanâ'î's <u>H</u>adî<u>k</u>ah with a commentary and marginal
glosses by \`Abd-alla<u>t</u>îf bin \`Abdallâh al-\`Abbâsî, who is best
known by his revised

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

and annotated edition of Jalâl-aldîn Rûmi's Mathnawî, his commentaries
on the same poem, and a special glossary, La<u>t</u>â\`'f-allughât
(lithogr. Lucknow under title Farhang-i-Mathnawî 1877). He died 1048 or
1049 (A.D. 1638, 1639) in Shahjahân's reign. The present copy, which is
the author's autograph, was finished by him 20th Jumâdâ alawwal A.H.
1044 (=Nov. 11th, 1634), and represents an abridgement from a larger
commentary of his, the La<u>t</u>â'if al <u>H</u>adâ'i<u>k</u>, from
which also the glosses are taken (marked \#). According to the dîbâca he
began the larger work 1040 and completed it 1042 (1630-33) supported by
his friend Mîr \`Imâd-aldîn Ma<u>h</u>mûd al Hamadânî, with the
takhallu<u>s</u> Ilâhî, the author of the well-known tadhkirah of
Persian poets the Khazîna-i-Ganj.'

The following is an account of the contents of this MS. First comes a
short preface by \`Abdu'l-La<u>t</u>îf, introducing Sanâ'î's own
preface, which is stated to have been written to the complete collection
of his writings; it is frequently, states \`Abdu'l-La<u>t</u>îf, not to
be found in copies of his works. After Sanâ'î's preface comes another,
called *Râsta-i <u>kh</u>iyâbân*, by \`Abdu'l-La<u>t</u>îf, described as
a short preface to this writer's commentary; this concludes with a
reference to Ilâhî and his share in the work, and two *târî<u>kh</u>s*
by Ilâhî, giving A.H. 1040 as the date of its commencement, and 1042 as
that of its completion. A few more lines by \`Abdu'l-La<u>t</u>îf
introduce the work itself. The original numbering of the folia commences
with the text; there is also a pencil numbering, in English characters,
beginning with the first preface The poem closes with 59 verses, in the
same metre, which form an address to Abû'l-<u>H</u>asan \`Alî b.
Nâ<u>s</u>ir al <u>Gh</u>aznawî, named Biryângar, sent to him at
Ba<u>gh</u>dâd, because of the accusations of the traducers of the book.
The date of completion of the text is given as A.H. 535; and, in a
triangular enclosure of gold lines, it is stated that "this honoured
copy was completed 20th Jumâdâ al-awwal, 1044 A.H." A few pages at the
end, written by the same hand, give an account of how the book was sent
to Biryângar at Ba<u>gh</u>dâd, on account of the accusations that were
brought against it; how it was found to be orthodox, and a reply sent to
<u>Gh</u>aznî.

This MS. I denote by A.

\(6\) The Lucknow lithograph published by the Newal Kishore Press, dated
A.H. 1304 (A.D. 1886). This is an edition of the whole,

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

work, including prefaces and \`Abdu'l-La<u>t</u>îf's commentary. It
comprises 860 pp., of 15 verses to a page; the paper, as usual, is
somewhat inferior; the text is on the whole easily legible, but the same
cannot always be said for the commentary, written in the margins and in
a much smaller hand. It contains first a list of the titles of all the
sections of all the chapters, followed by some verses setting forth the
subjects of the ten chapters each as a whole. The ornamental title-page
follows, stating that the *<u>H</u>adîqa* of Sanâ'î is here accompanied
by the commentary *La<u>t</u>â'ifu'l-<u>H</u>adâ'iq* of
\`Abdu'l-La<u>t</u>îf al-\`Abbâsî. On p. 2 begins the 'First Preface',
called *Mirâtu'l-<u>H</u>adâ'iq*, by 'Abdu'l-La<u>t</u>îf, dated 1038 A.
H.; this is not included in A; an abstract of it is given later (v. p.
xxi). After this comes Sanâ'î's preface with \`Abdu'l-La<u>t</u>îf's
introductory words, as in A; this is called the 'Second Preface'. The
'Third Preface', which is \`Abdu'l-La<u>t</u>îf's *Râsta-i
<u>kh</u>iyâbân*, is here written in the margins of the ' Second
Preface'. Then comes the text with marginal commentary, introduced as in
A by a few more words from \`Abdu'l-La<u>t</u>îf. At the conclusion of
the work is the address to Biryângar; and finally some *qi<u>t</u>\`as*
on the dates of commencement and completion of the printing of the book.

I denote this lithograph by L.

\(7\) I obtained from Bombay, from the bookshop of Mirzâ Mu<u>h</u>ammad
<u>Sh</u>îrâzî, another lithograph, which comprises only the first
chapter of the work accompanied by a copious marginal commentary. Pp. 15
+ 4 + 31 + 188, 15 ll. to a page; published at Lûhârû (near <u>H</u>i

<u>ss</u>ar, Punjab) 1290 A.H. (1873 A.D.). The title-page states that
this is the commentary on Sanâ'î's <u>H</u>adîqa by Nawâb Mirzâ
\`Alâu'd-Dîn A<u>h</u>mad, <u>Kh</u>ân Bahâdur, chief (\#\#\#) of
Lûhârû, called \`Alâ'î, the scribe being Maulavî Mu<u>h</u>ammad
Ruknu'd-Dîn of <u>H</u>i

<u>ss</u>ar. Ruknu'd-Dîn states (p. 2) that he himself was doubtful of
many words, and did not understand a number of the verses; he took his
difficulties to \`Alâ'î, who explained all; and "Praise be to God, there
never has been such a commentator of the <u>H</u>adîqa, nor will be; or
if there is, it will be an imitation or a theft from this king of
commentators." This reads rather curiously when considered in connection
with the fact, to be mentioned hereafter, that the authors have
incorporated in their commentary the whole of that of
\`Abdu'l-La<u>t</u>îf, and that their original contributions to the
elucidation of the

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

text are of slight value. Ruknu'd-Dîn was asked one day by the printers
(\#\#\#) to bring them his copy (\#\#\#) of the *<u>H</u>adîqa* on its
completion, for printing and publication. Pp. 4-10 are occupied by an
Arabic preface by Ruknu'd-Dîn, again in extravagant praise of \`Alâ'î
and his accomplishments as a commentator. There follows (pp. 11-14)
another title-page, and a short poem by \`Alâ'î; and then (p. 15) a
*qi<u>t</u>\`a*, giving the dates of commencement and completion of the
work. Four pages of introduction (pp. 1-4) follow, and again with
separate paging, 31 pp. of commentary on the first 28 pp. of the text,
the reason apparently being that the whole of the commentary on these
pages could not conveniently be written in the margins. The text
comprises 186 pp., and includes (though I cannot find this stated
anywhere) only the first book of the complete *<u>H</u>adîqa*; the
volume is concluded by some lines of \`Alâ'î in praise of
Mu<u>h</u>ammad, and a benediction. At the end of the marginal notes on
every page is written "*\`Alâ'î sallamahu," or "Maulânâ \`Alâ'î
sallamahu Allâhu ta\`âla*."
