# ON HIS KINDNESS AND BOUNTY.

O Lord, the Enduring, the Holy, whose kingdom is not of touch or sense;
by Thee we conquer, without Thee we fail; in Thee we are content, apart
from Thee unsatisfied. Though none amongst us is of any avail, is not
Thy kindness a sufficient messenger of promise? Thou hast given us our
religion, give us a sure belief in it; though we have the faith, give us
yet more. Checkmated on the chessboard of

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

our passions as we are, we thirst for the heavenly valley; none of us
can tell the good from ill,--give us what Thou knowest to be good. O
Thou, desire of the desirous, O Thou, the hope of those who hope, O Thou
who seest what is manifest, who knowest what is hidden, Thou surely
accomplishest my hope; all my hope is in Thy mercy,--life and daily
bread, all is of Thy bounty. From the river of the true religion give to
my thirsty heart a draught full of the light of the Truth.

Not by wisdom and not by skill can I obtain other intercessor with Thee
than Thyself. All that Thy decree has written for me is well; it is not
ill. I can dispense with ever thine,--all that is; but Thou art
indispensable to me; receive me Thou In the rose-tree of the search the
nightingale of love trills its song of "Thou art all!" The falcon of my
glory flies up from the path of lowliness higher than the sidra-tree. He
rules empires who presses on towards Thee; but whoso makes not for this
door, wretched is he.

Who shall give me speech but Thou? Who shall save me from myself but
Thou? Thou buyest not perfume and paint and deceit; save me from all
this, O Thou who art all! Thou buyest weakness and helplessness and
feebleness, but not indolence and stupidity and uncleanness. Pain
becomes ease at Thy court, silence is perfect eloquence. Kill everything
(i.e., All our desires, passions, follies and impurities) and, for it
all, to be received by Thee will be sufficient blood-money. To turn the
reins of hope away from Thee,--what is that but the sign and mark of a
fall? Thy vengeance

takes shape in the soul of whoso seeks aught but to be beloved of Thy
presence; O Guardian of the mysteries, save our inward nature from the
impress which marks the wicked!
