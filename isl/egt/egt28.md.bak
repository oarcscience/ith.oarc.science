# THE PARABLE OF THOSE WHO HEED NOT.

A fool saw a camel grazing, and said, Why is thy form all crooked? Said
the camel, In disputing thus thou censurest the sculptor;

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

beware! Look not on my crookedness in disparagement, and kindly take the
straight road away from me. My form is thus because it is best so, as
from a bow's being bent comes its excellence. Begone hence with thy
impertinent interference, an ass's ear goes well with an ass's head.

The arch of the eyebrow, though it displease thee, is yet a fiting
cupola over the eye; by reason of the eyebrow, the eye is able to look
at the sun, and in virtue of the bloom of its strength becomes an
adornment to the face. Evil and good, in the estimation of the wise, are
both exceeding good; from Him there comes no evil; whatever thou seest
to come from Him, though evil, it were well thou look on it all as good.
To the body there comes its portion of ease and of pain; to the soul
ease is as a treasure secured; but a twisted snake is over it, the hand
and foot of Wisdom are at its side.
