# OF THE MULTITUDE; THEY ARE LIKE CATTLE--NAY. THEY ARE MORE ERRING.

On the colt that is full three years old the breaker puts the saddle and
bridle; he gives him a training in manners, and takes his restiveness
out of him; he makes him obedient to the rein,--what is called a hand
horse. Then he is fit for kings to ride, and they deck him with gold and
jewels.

If that colt had not experienced these necessary hardships, he would
have been of less use than an ass, only fit to carry millstones; and
would have been perpetually in pain from his loads, bearing now the
Jew's baggage, now the Christian's, in pain and sorrow and tribulation.

The man who has never undergone hardship has not, so think tile wise,
received a full measure of blessing; he is Hell's food, is in terror;
even in Hell he is no more than a stone; his is the place of fear

and dread; it is read in His incontrovertible book, "*Whose fuel is
men*." (Qur. 2:22)

Though thou canst neither purpose nor compass aught without Him, yet
religion's task is not to be accomplished without thee, ally more than
without Him; religion's task is not all easy business, God's religion is
always a thing of heaviness. God's religion is a man's crown and diadem;
does a crown befit a worthless man?, Guard thy religion, so mayest thou
attain thy kingdom; otherwise, know that without religion thou art a man
of naught. Tread the path of religion, for if thou do so, thou shalt not
tremble like a branch in nakedness. Sweet is religion's path and God's
decree! leave the black mire, lift thy feet out of it.
