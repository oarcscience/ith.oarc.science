# ON THE TRUST IN GOD SHOWN BY OLD WOMEN.

When <u>H</u>âtim set out for the sanctuary,--he whom thou callest

82

A

<u>s</u>amm,--when he set out for the <u>H</u>ijâz and the Sacred House,
making towards the tomb of the Prophet (*on whom be peace!*), there
remained behind a colt of his household, with no supplies whatever and
owning nothing; he left his wife alone in the house, with no means of
support, and set forth on the road; alone and in trouble he left her,
her life or death the same to him. Her womanhood was a fellow-traveller
with him towards trust in God, for she knew her Provider; she had a
friend behind the curtain, being a sharer in God's secret.

The men of the quarter assembled, and all went cheerily to the woman;
when they saw her alone and in trouble, they all began at once to ask
her her affairs, and by way of advice and counsel, in sympathy said,
"When thy husband set out for \`Arafât did he leave thee any means of
support?" She said, "He did; I am quite contented,--my maintenance is
what it was before." Again they said, "How much is thy maintenance? for
thy heart is contented and happy." She said, "However long my life
lasts, He has given into my hands all the support I need." The other
said, "Thou knowest not aught thyself, and what does he know, about thy
life?"

She said, "The Giver of my daily bread knows; while life lasts, He will
not take away my sustenance." They answered, "He does not give it apart
from means; He never gives dates from the willow-tree; thou hast no sort
of earthly possessions, and He will not send

thee a wallet from heaven." She said, O ye of clouded minds! How long
will ye utter folly and perversity? He needs to use a wallet who owns no
piece of land; but His are heaven and earth entirely; what He wills He
does; His is the authority. He brings it to pass as He desires;
sometimes He gives increase, sometimes He takes away."

How long wilt thou talk of trust in God? Thou hearest the name of a man,
but art less than a woman. Since on thy journey thou comportest thyself
not as men do, go learn how to journey from the women. Thou hast chosen
sloth, O body of woman! Alas for the man who is less than a woman!

Look to thy soul, and abandon thy lower nature, for this is as a hawk,
and that a heron; that in that place, where it conies to comprehend
'*We*' and '*Thou*', when it has been wholly burnt, '*He*' and '*He*'
shall remain. Reason, that, living in this world, cannot like soul
attain to aught, arrives but as far as itself and reaches not to Him.

The ears of the head are two, the ear of love one; this is for religion,
those for doubt; though the ear of the head listens to innumerable
things, the ear of love listens only to the story of the One. Those two
ears are set on each side of thy head like waterspouts, why dost thou
still cry and howl? Thou art but a child;--go, turn thine eyes away from
the devil, lest he put ears on the sides of thy head.
