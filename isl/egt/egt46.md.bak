# ON AFFECTION AND ISOLATION.

The lovers are drunk in His Presence, their reason in their sleeve

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

and their soul in their hand. Lo, when they urge the Burâq of their
heart on towards Him, they cast all away under his feet; they throw down
life and heart in His path. and make themselves of His company. In the
face of his belief in the Unity, there exists for him no old or new; all
is naught, naught; He alone is. What worth have reason and life in his
eyes? the heart and the true faith pursue the road together. The veil of
the lovers is very transparent; the tracings on these veils are very
delicate. Love's conqueror is he who is conquered by love; '*love*'
inverted will itself explain this to thee.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

When the clouds fall away from the Sun, the world of love is filled with
light. The cloud is dark and murky as a Magian, but water may be useful
as well as harmful;--a little of it is man's life, but his life is
destroyed by too much of it; so he who believes in the Unity is the
beloved of His Presence, though affection, too, is a veil over His
glory.

He is not in evil plight to whom He addresses His instruction. What then
is evil?--to be the friend who toils. Look at the letters

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

of *ma<u>h</u>abbat* (friendship); the very word *mi<u>h</u>nat*
(labour) is shown in its characters. O thou who lovest the Beauty of the
Presence of the Invisible, till thou seek for the meeting with His face
thou wilt never drink the draught of communion with Him, nor taste the
sweetness of inward converse with Him. Since thou knowest the One, and
assertest the One, why search after the two, and three, and four?
Together with *alif* go *be* and *te*,--count *be* and *te* an idol, and
*alif* God.

Continue to ply hand and foot in search; when thou reachest the sea,
talk not of the rill. Since glory and shame have made of thee a slave, O
youth, what hast thou to do with the Eternal? Thou art but newly come
into existence,--talk not of the Eternal, thou who dost not know thy
head from thy foot. There are a hundred

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

thousand obstructions in thy path; thy courage fails, and falls short;
thy talk is trickery still, still thou remainest in the snare. Betake
thyself at once to the ocean of righteousness and true religion, thy
body naked like wheat-grains, or like Adam; that so He may approve thy
complete renunciation; then see that thou meddle not again with these
useless encumbrances. Thou art as yet a follower of Satan; how canst
thou become a man without repenting?

When He admits thee in His court, ask from Him no object of desire,--ask
Himself; when thy Lord has chosen thee for friendship, thy unabashed eye
has seen all there is to see. The world of love suffers not
duality,--what talk is this of Me and Thee?

When thy Thee-ness leaves thee, fortune will uplift thy state and seat;
in a compact of intimacy it is not well to claim to be a friend, and
then-still *Me* and *Thee*! How shall he that is free become a slave?
How canst thou fill a vessel already full? Go thou, all of thee, to His
door; for whoso in the world shall present himself there in part only,
is wholly naught. When thou hast reached to the kiss and love-glance of
the Friend, count poison honey from Him, and the thorn a flower.

For the rust on the mirror of the free, *No* is the nail-parer,---with
it cut off existence. Be not filled with thy incapacity time

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

after time, as a boat is filled; dost thou not read in God's book that
those who die are not dead but living? (Qur. 3:164)

Receive alike good and evil, fair and foul; whatever God sends thee,
take it to thy soul. Did not \`Azâzîl, receiving from God both His mercy
and His curse, deem them both alike? Whatsoever he obtained from God,
good or evil, he held both equal. But the likeness of him who waits at
the door of princes is as a sail in unskilled hands.
