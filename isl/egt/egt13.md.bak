# ON GOD AS FIRST CAUSE.

The course of time is not the mould whence issues His eternal duration,
nor temperament the cause of His beneficence; without His word, time and
temperament exist not, as apart from His favour the soul enters not the
body. This and that both are wanting and worthless; that and this both
are foolish and impotent. 'Old' and 'new' are words inapplicable to His
essence; He is, for He consists not of any existences except Himself.
His kingdom cannot be known to its limits, His nature cannot be
described even to its beginning; His acts and His nature are beyond
instrument and direction, for His Being is above '*Be*' and '*He*'.

Before thou wert in existence a greater than thou for thy sake brought
together the causes that went to form thee; in one place

under the heavens by the command and act of God were the four
temperaments prepared; I their gathering together is a proof of His
power; His power is the draughtsman of His wisdom. He who laid down the
plan of thee without pen can also complete it without colours; within
thee, not in yellow and white and red and black, God has pourtrayed His
work; and without thee He has designed the spheres; of what?--of wind
and water and fire and earth. The heavens will not for ever leave to
thee thy colours,--yellow and black and red and white; the spheres take
back again their gifts, but the print of God remains for ever; He who
without colours drew thy outlines will never take back from thee thy
soul. By His creative power He brought thee under an obligation, for His
grace has made thee an instrument I of expression of Himself; He said,
'I was a hidden treasure; creation was created that thou mightest know
me; the eye like to a precious pearl through *kâf* and *nûn* He made a
mouth filled with Yâ în.

Sew no purse and tear not thy veil; lick no plate and buy not
blandishment. All things are contraries, but by the command of God all
travel together on the same road; in the house of non-existence the plan
of all is laid down for all eternity by the command of the Eternal; four
essences, through the exertion of the seven stars, become the means of
bodying forth the plan. Say, The world of evil and of good proceeds not
except from Him and to Him, nay, is Himself. All objects receive their
outline and forms from Him, their material basis as well as their final
shape. Element and material substance, the form and colours clothing the
four elements,--all things know as limited and finite, as but a ladder
for thy ascent to God.
