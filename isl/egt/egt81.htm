<P>On the colt that is full three years old the breaker puts the saddle and bridle; he gives him a training in manners, and takes his restiveness out of him; he makes him obedient to the rein,--what is called a hand horse. Then he is fit for kings to ride, and they deck him with gold and jewels.</P>
<P>If that colt had not experienced these necessary hardships, he would have been of less use than an ass, only fit to carry millstones; and would have been perpetually in pain from his loads, bearing now the Jew's baggage, now the Christian's, in pain and sorrow and tribulation.</P>
<P>The man who has never undergone hardship has not, so think tile wise, received a full measure of blessing; he is Hell's food, is in terror; even in Hell he is no more than a stone; his is the place of fear</P>

<P>and dread; it is read in His incontrovertible book, "<I>Whose fuel is men</I>." (Qur. 2:22)</P>
<P>Though thou canst neither purpose nor compass aught without Him, yet religion's task is not to be accomplished without thee, ally more than without Him; religion's task is not all easy business, God's religion is always a thing of heaviness. God's religion is a man's crown and diadem; does a crown befit a worthless man?, Guard thy religion, so mayest thou attain thy kingdom; otherwise, know that without religion thou art a man of naught. Tread the path of religion, for if thou do so, thou shalt not tremble like a branch in nakedness. Sweet is religion's path and God's decree! leave the black mire, lift thy feet out of it.</P>
