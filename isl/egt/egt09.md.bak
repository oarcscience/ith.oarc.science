# VI.--SANÂ'Î'S PREFACE.

The author's Preface to the work, given in A and L, and occupying in the
latter nearly thirteen closely printed pages, is here given in abstract.
It was not, as will appear, written specially as an introduction to the
*<u>H</u>adîqa*, but to his collected works.

After an opening section in praise of God, the author introduces the
tradition, "*When a son of Adam dies, his activity ceases, except in
three things; a permanent bequest, and knowledge by which men are
benefited, and pious sons who invoke blessings on him after his death*."
Considering these words one day, and reflecting that none of the three
conditions was applicable to himself, he became sorrowful,

<span id="page_xxxi">p. xxxi</span>

and continued for some time in a state of grief and depression. one, day
while in this condition, he was visited by his friend A<u>h</u>mad b.
Mas\`ûd, who inquired the cause of his sorrow. The author told him that,
not fulfilling any one of the above conditions, he was afraid to die;
possessing not one of these three advocates at court, he would stand
without possessions or adornment in the Presence of the Unity. His
friend then began to comfort him, saying, "First let me tell you a
story." Sanâ'î replied, "Do so."

A<u>h</u>mad b. Mas\`ûd then related how one day a company of women
wished to have audience with Fâ<u>t</u>ima, Mu<u>h</u>ammad's daughter.
Mu<u>h</u>ammad gave permission; but Fâ<u>t</u>ima, weeping, said, "O
Father, how long is it since I have had even a little shawl for my head?
and that mantle that I had pieced together in so many places with
date-leaves is in pledge with Simeon the Jew. How can I receive them?"
But Mu<u>h</u>ammad said, "There is no help; you must go." Fâ<u>t</u>ima
went ashamed to the interview, and came back in sorrow to her father;
who was comforting her when the rustle of Gabriel's wings was heard.
Gabriel looked at Fâ<u>t</u>ima and asked, "What is this sorrow? Ask the
women, then, what garments they had on, and what thou." Mu<u>h</u>ammad
sent a messenger to the women, who returned, and said, "It was so, at
the time when the Mistress of Creation bestowed beauty on that assembly,
that the onlookers were astounded; though clothed, they seemed to
themselves naked; and among themselves they were asking 'Whence came
this fine linen, and from which shop this embroidery? What skilful
artificers, what nimble-fingered craftsmen!'" Fâ<u>t</u>ima said, "O my
father, why didst thou not tell me, that I might have been glad?" He
answered, "O dear one, thy beauty consisted in that which was concealed
inside thyself."

"By my life," continued A<u>h</u>mad, "such modesty was allowable in
Fâ<u>t</u>ima, brought up in seclusion; but here we have a strong and
able man of happy fortune, one who is known as a pattern to others in
both practice and theory! Though thou hast considered thyself naked, yet
they have clothed thee in a robe from the wardrobe of Eternity. Is it
proper for this robe to be concealed, instead of being displayed for the
enlightenment of others? " And adverting to the saying, "*When a son of
Adam dies, his work is cut short, except in three things*," he takes the
three one by one. First,

a continuing

<span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span>

alms; but '*Every kindness is an alms; and it is a kindness that thou
meet thy brother with a cheerful countenance, and that thou empty thy
bucket into the pots of thy brother*;' that is, alms does not wholly
consist in spreading food before a glutton, or giving some worthless
thing to a pauper; it is a truer alms and a more imperishable
hospitality to wear a cheerful countenance before one's friends, " and
if others have the outward semblance of alms, thou hast its inward
essence; and if they have set forth a table of food before men, thou
hast set forth a table of life before their souls; so much for what thou
sayest, 'I am excluded from a continuing alms!'"

A<u>h</u>mad b. Mas\`ûd then takes up the second point, knowledge that
benefits; and quotes, "*We take refuge with God from knowledge which
does not benefit*" and "*Many a wise man is destroyed by his ignorance
and his knowledge which does not advantage him*." As examples of
knowledge that does not benefit he takes the science of metaphysics, a
science tied by the leg to desire and notoriety, lying under the
opprobrium of "*He who learns the science of metaphysics is a heretic,
and flys in circles in the air*;" as well as of the saying "*A science
newly born, weak in its credentials*"--"I have perfected it for the sake
of heresy, and so peace." Then similarly the science of calculation, a
veil which diverts attention from the Truth, a curtain in front of the
subtilties of religion; and the science of the stars, a science of
conjectures and the seed of irreligion, for "*Whoso credits a soothsayer
has become an infidel*." After a tirade against the ordinary type of
learned man, he proceeds, "All their falsifyings and terrorizings and
imaginings and conjecturings are limited by their own defects; that
philosophy of the law is cherished which is notorious over all the
quarters and regions of the world; there is your '*knowledge that men
benefit by*'! From earth to Pleiades who is there sees any benefit in
our doctors?" He then tells Sanâ'î that he is master of a more excellent
wisdom; "*the poets are the chiefs of speech*;" "*the gift of the poets
comes from the piety of the parents*;" "*verily from poetry comes
wisdom*;" and will have none of such sayings as "*poetry is of the
affairs of Satan*."

As to the third part of the tradition, *and pious descendants to invoke
blessings on him after his death*, A<u>h</u>mad says, "The sons which
suffice are thy sons; what son born in the way of generation

<span id="page_xxxiii">p. xxxiii</span>

and begetting is dearer than thy sons, or more honoured? Who has ever
seen children like thine, all safe from the vicissitudes of time? The
sons of poets are the poets' words, as a former master has said--

'A learned man never desires son or wife  
Should the offspring of both these fail, the scholar's offspring would
not be cut off.'

A son according to the flesh may be a defilement to a family; but the
son of intelligence and wisdom is an ornament to the household. These
sons of yours you cannot disown."

He then asks Sanâ'î why he has thus become a recluse, and indolent and
languid. This languidness is indeed preferable to a total heedlessness
and forgetfulness of God, though Mutanabbi has said--

"*I have not seen anything of the faults of men like the failure of
those who are able to reach the end*."

He asks Sanâ'î not to bring forward the saying, "*Laziness is sweeter
than honey*," but to bestir himself and collect and complete his
poetical works.

Sanâ'î tells us that he submitted himself to the advice of his friend,
but brought forward the difficulties of house and food, since the work
could not be performed friendless and homeless. A<u>h</u>mad b. Mas\`ûd
thereupon built him a house, gave him an allowance for his maintenance
for one year, and sent also a supply of clothing. He was therefore
enabled to complete and arrange his writing's free from all care and
anxiety. The preface ends with the praise of his generous friend.
