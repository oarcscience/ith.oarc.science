# ON THE JUSTICE OF THE PRINCE AND THE SECURITY OF HIS SUBJECTS.

\`Umar one day saw a group of boys on a certain road all engaged in play
and everyone boasting of himself; everyone was in haste to wrestle,
having duly bared his head in Arab fashion. When \`Umar looked towards
the boys, fear of him tore the curtain of their gladness; they all fled
from him in haste, except \`Abdu'l-lâh b. Zubair. \`Umar said to him,
"Why didst thou not fly from before me?" He said, "Why should I fly from
before thee, O beneficent one? Thou art not a tyrant, nor I guilty."

If a prince is pious and just, his people, are glad in his justice but
if his inclination is towards tyranny, he plunges his country in ruin.
When thou hast provisioned thyself with justice, thy steed has passed
beyond both halting-places.

What matters acceptance or rejection, good or evil, to him who knows his
own virtue? Be virtuous,--thou wilt escape an aching head; if thou be
bad, thou breakest the whole compact. So stand in wonder at His justice
that thou losest memory of all else but of Him.
