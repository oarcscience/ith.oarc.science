# A STORY.

An old man put forth his head, and seeing his field dried up I spoke
thus:--"O Lord of both new and old, our food is in Thy hands, do what
thou wilt. The sustenance Thou givest to fair and foul depends not on
tears of cloud nor smiles of field; I well know Thou art the Uncaused
Sustainer; my life and my food, all comes from Thee. Thy one is better
than thousands of thousands, for Thy little is not a little."

A flame from Him, and a hundred thousand stars appear; a drop from Him,
and a hundred thousand palm-trees spring up. He who is in fear about his
daily food is not a man,--truly he is less than a woman.
