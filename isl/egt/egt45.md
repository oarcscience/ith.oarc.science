# \[ON THE DESIRE FOR GOD.\]

So long as thou art a stranger to the light of Moses, thou art blind to
the day, like the bird of Jesus; since thou hast no knowledge of the
path of poverty, thou art in hiding, like the inside of an onion. First,
for the sake of His comforting love, do thou make thy head thy foot,
like the reed, and continue seeking Him; that by thy perfect search thou
mayest reach that place, where thou knowest thou needest seek no more.

Did not an indolent one, when he heard murmurs of sloth on his heart's
tongue, ask \`Alî, "Say, O Prince, illuminer of the soul, is the dark
night better, or the day?" Murta<u>z</u>â said, "Hear, O questioner;
yield not to this backsliding; for to the lovers in this soul-inflaming
path the fire of the secret is better than the splendour of the day." He
whose soul the path has fired stays not behind on foot at the
halting-place; in that world where love tells the secret, thou no longer
art, thy reason no longer endures.
