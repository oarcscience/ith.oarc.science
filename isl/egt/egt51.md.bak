# ON TRUST IN GOD.

Set not thy foot in His court with hypocrisy. The men of the Path walk
in trust; if thou hast a constant trust in Him, why not also in His
feeding thee? Bring then thy belongings to the street of trust in God;
then fortune will come out to meet thee. Listen to a story concerning
trust. in God, so that thou remain not a pledge in the hand of the
devil; and learn the law of the Path from a woman besides whom a
braggart man shows but contemptibly.
