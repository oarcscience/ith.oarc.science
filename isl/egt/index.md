Technical Note: Due to the limitations of optical character recognition,
the extensive footnotes in the body of the text had to be omitted; I
have manually inserted a few parenthetical notes, particularly the
references to the Qur'an. In addion, Arabic characters are written using
\# signs throughout; I may add Unicode entities at some point.
