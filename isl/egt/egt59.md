# ON DREAMS OF LIGHTS AND STARS.

To see the sun in a dream is said in every case to mean a king. The moon
is as a counsellor; another has said, No, it is a woman. The globe of
Mars or Saturn in a dream brings trial and grief and torment; Mercury
represents a writer; Jupiter comes as a treasurer and minister of state;
Venus is the origin of joy, of pleasure, of desire and of ease. And the
other stars deem thou brothers; when thou interpretest them pronounce
them such, for thus Ya\`qûb, who established this method of
interpretation, disclosed the secrets of this science to his son; the
sun and moon were his father and mother, the stars represented his
brothers.

Has anyone seen the sorrowing ones perplexed like we have? Now we will
leave the dreams of those who wake; to awaken a sleeper is easy, but the
heedless is like one dead. Make an end of divination and augury and
interpretation: pass hence,--thou hast finished thy recital.
