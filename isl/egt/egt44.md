# A STORY.

Hast thou not heard how in a rainless time some birds received their
food from a Magian's door? Many Muslims spoke to him, and among them one
clever and eloquent--"Though the little birds take your corn, yet this
generosity of yours will not find acceptance." Said the Magian, "If He
does not choose me, still He sees my toil; since He himself is kind and
generous, He does not think the same of niggardliness as of liberality."

Ja\`far sacrificed his arm in His Path; instead of arms God gave him
wings. None shall discover thy work but God; truly nothing can happen to
thee from men. Pay no heed to the doing and bustling of men, fasten thy
mind on Him, and thou hast escaped from sorrow and bondage. So far as
thou canst, take thou no friend but Him; take men not into thy account
at all. Your bread is laid up in God's eternity; His friendship He gives
you,--it is your life; know that both of these are represented in the
world of love and search by the Persian *water* and the Arabic *father*.
