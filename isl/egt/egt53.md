and versed in transformations, for the twenty-four letters; the *qâf* of

of life, the other half the twelve zodiacal constellations of the
heavens of the faith; the caskets are full of the pearls of hope, the
zodiac filled by the moon and sun:--not the pearls of any sea of this
world, not the moon and sun of these heavens; but the pearls of the
ocean of the world of Power, the moon and sun of the heaven of peace.
