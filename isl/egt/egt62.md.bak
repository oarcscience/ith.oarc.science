# \[ON STRIVING IN GOD'S PATH.\]

If thou wouldst possess the pearl, O man, leave the barren waste and
wander by the sea; and if thou obtainest not from the sea its pellucid
pearl, at least thou shalt find that thou hast not failed to reach the
water. Strive in God's path, O soldier; if thou hast no ambition, thou
shalt have no honour; saddle and get ready thy horse for the journey to
the Court of the Blest. The man who disowns in shame the dust and water
of his being rides on the air like fire; crown not thy head with the
heavens, so mayest thou receive the diadem from Gabriel; thine shall be
the angels' crown, while the crown of the firmament shall be cast down.

The true believer ever labours; for merely to hint at labour is a sick
man's prayer. What knowest thou of contempt of life, having no will to
show thyself a warrior? When thou hast laid low the

head of pride then hast thou prostrated thyself before the door of the
search; the heart's ka\`ba has become God's dwelling-place. But the
dog's ambition extends only to its bone.
