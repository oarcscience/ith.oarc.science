# ON THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF THE TWO ABODES.

The sun and earth produce the day and night; when thou hast passed
beyond, neither the one nor the other will exist for thee.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

O thou in whose imagination desire and desirer are two, know that the
duality belongs to thy understanding, and belongs not to the Unity.
Since in the Presence of One such as He all things are one, if thou wilt
listen to my words, then seek not thou duality; know that in duality is
pain and opposition, in Unity Rustam and a catamite are alike.

Till on the battlefield of purity and in the court of the soul, standing
above thy life and treading on thy earthly body, thou cast away thy
sword, thou wilt not become a shield; till thou lay aside the crown thou
wilt not become a leader. So long as thy soul is a slave to the crown,
thy acts will ever be wrong; when thou no longer heedest crown and zone,
then art thou chief over the chiefs of the age. To abandon the world is
to mount the horse of God's favour; its repudiation is the establishment
of pure truth. The death of the soul is the destruction of life; the
death of the life is salvation for the

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

soul. By no means stand still on this path; become
non-existent,--non-existent too as regards becoming non-existent; when
thou hast abandoned both individuality and understanding, then for thee
this world changes to that one.

Every desire that springs up in thee, strike that moment at its head, as
thou dost with the lamp, the candle, and pen; for every head that comes
in sight is on this Path meet to be cutoff. To be headless before heroes
is due respect; for ever a chief seeks a cap of honour. To lose thy head
brings thee a head again for its fruit; by reason of its headlessness
the pomegranate is a casket full of pearls.

Though a crown is a protection to a bald head, with such a head it is
wrong to wear a crown. Thou hast corruption under thy cap,

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

--then canst thou not possibly pass the bridge of fire. Better for a man
than earthly fortune is a well; a bald man becomes arrogant when he
receives a crown; so is it well that while on this night-journey, when
thou puttest thy hand to thy head, thou shouldest find no crown thereon;
for while the baldheaded man desires a crown to cover his defect, the
man of the Path seeks for the invisible. If the crown hurts thee, no
less too inverted it destroys thy life; the head that is a slave to the
crown is a prisoner, like Bî<u>zh</u>an, in a well. Then own neither
head nor crown on the Path; if thou dost, thou wilt have thy heart
aflame like wax; and if thou must needs have a crown, take one of fire,
like the candle; for he who in

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

his love is the light of the Path, like a candle has a crown of fire.

If thou demandest Yûsuf's place and power, invert thyself before God,
like a well; guard like Sulaimân the perfectness of the Path: like Yûsuf
look upon the well as beautiful; till thy bodily form becomes a dweller
in the well, thy hidden figure will not be of God.

Arise, and leave this ignoble world to find the ineffable God abandon
body and life and reason and religion; and in His path get for thyself a
soul. Know, that whatso is of the true essence of learning and knowledge
is all mere falsehood to him who is learned in attributes. Form, and
attribute, and essence,--the first is like the womb; the next the
membranes, the last the child; thy outward form covers in thy
attributes, thy attributes again are a rampart around thy inmost
essence; that, like a lamp, is bright in itself, while the other two are
as a glass and a niche in the wall.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

Till on that road thou hast endured distress, thou hast two souls,
though thy effigy is single. O thou, who art related to phenomenal
existence but as soul is to body, whose soul is related to thy
individuality but as a man to his name, exertion originates in the body,
attraction in the soul; but the search begins in leaving both of these.
Contingent existence is for ever an infant before the Eternal; but he
who has been purified is free from these dregs.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

So long as the race of man endures, there are two mansions prepared for
him; this, for pain and want, that one, for blessing and delight. While
earth is the habitation of the sons of men, the tent of their daily
supplies is erected over them; esteem then this earth a guest-house, but
count man the master of a family; though till he has suffered pain on
this dust-heap he will not reach the treasure of that mansion.

I ask thee, since thou art heir to the knowledge of philosophy and law,
their principles and deductions, (religion ever flees from form, that
she may constrain men from evil),--give me an answer truly, if thou art
not dead, nor art asleep: Since thou hast been constituted with a soul,
is not the soul a sufficient reward for thee in exchange for thyself.?
