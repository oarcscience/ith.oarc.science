<H3>22. Miserable condition of the uncircumcised in that a dog is better than they.</H3>

<P>The disciples questioned Jesus on that day, saying: 'O master, why didst thou make such answer to the woman, saying that they were dogs?'</P>

<P>Jesus answered: 'Verily I say unto you that a dog is better than an uncircumcised man.' Then were the disciples sorrowful, saying: 'Hard are these words, and who shall be able to receive them?'</P>

<P>Jesus answered: 'If ye consider, O foolish ones, what the dog doth, that hath no reason, for the service of his master, ye will find my saying to be true. Tell me, doth the dog guard the house of his master, and expose his life against the robber? Yea, assuredly. But what receiveth he? Many blows and injuries with little bread, and he always showeth to his master a joyful countenance. Is this true?'</P>

<P>'True it is, O master,' answered the disciples.</P>

<P>Then said Jesus: 'Consider now how much God hath given to man, and ye shall see how unrighteous he is in not observing the covenant of God made with Abraham his servant. Remember that which David said to Saul king of Israel, against Goliath the Philistine: "My lord," said David, "while thy servant was keeping thy servant's flock there came the wolf, the bear, and the lion and seized thy servant's sheep: whereupon thy servant went and slew them, rescuing the sheep. And what is this uncircumcised one but like unto them? Therefore will thy servant go in the name of the Lord God of Israel, and will slay this unclean one that blasphemeth the holy people of God."</P>

<P>Then said the disciples: 'Tell us, O master, for what reason man must needs be circumcised?"</P>

<P>Jesus answered: 'Let it suffice you that God hath commanded it to Abraham, saying: "Abraham, circumcise thy foreskin and that of all thy house, for this is a covenant between me and thee for ever."'</P>
