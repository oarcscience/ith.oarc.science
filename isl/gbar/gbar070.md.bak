### 70.

Jesus departed from Jerusalem after the Passover, and entered into the
borders of Caesarea Philippi. Whereupon, the angel Gabriel having told
him of the sedition which was beginning among the common people, he
asked his disciples, saying: 'What do men say of me?'

They said: 'Some say that thou art Elijah, others Jeremiah, and others
one of the old prophets.'

Jesus answered: 'And ye; what say ye that I am?'

Peter answered: 'Thou art Christ, son of God.'

Then was Jesus angry, and with anger rebuked him, saying: 'Begone and
depart from me, because thou art the devil and seekest to cause me
offence!'

And he threatened the eleven, saying: 'Woe to you if ye believe this,
for I have won from God a great curse against those who believe this.'

And he was fain to cast away Peter; whereupon the eleven besought Jesus
for him, who cast him not away, but again rebuked him, saying: 'Beware
that never again thou say such words, because God would reprobate thee!'

Peter wept, and said: 'Lord, I have spoken foolishly: beseech God that
he pardon me.'

Then said Jesus: 'If our God willed not to show himself to Moses his
servant, nor to Elijah whom he so loved, nor to any prophet, will ye
think that God should show himself to this faithless generation? But
know ye not that God hath created all things of nothing with one single
word, and all men have had their origin out of a piece of clay? Now, how
shall God have likeness to man? Woe to those who suffer themselves to be
deceived of Satan!'

And having said this, Jesus besought God for Peter, the eleven and Peter
weeping, and saying: 'So be it, so be it, O blessed Lord our God.'

Afterwards Jesus departed and went into Galilee, in order that this vain
opinion which the common folk began to hold concerning him might be
extinguished.
