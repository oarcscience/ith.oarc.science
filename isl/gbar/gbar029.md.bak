### 29.

Then said Philip: 'Great is the mercy of God upon whoso loveth him. Tell
us, O master, how Abraham came to the knowledge of God.'

Jesus answered: 'Having arrived nigh unto the house of his father,
Abraham feared to go into the house; so he removed some distance from
the house and sat under a palm tree, where thus abiding by himself he
said: "It needs must be that there is a God who hath life and power more
than man, since he maketh man, and man without God could not make man."
Thereupon, looking round upon the stars, the moon, and the sun, he
thought that they had been God. But after considering their variableness
with their movements, he said: "It needs must be that God move not, and
that clouds hide him not: otherwise men would be brought to naught."
Whereupon, remaining thus in suspense, he heard himself called by name,
"Abraham!" And so, turning round and not seeing anyone on any side, he
said: "I have surely heard myself called by name, 'Abraham.'" Thereupon,
two other times in like manner, he heard himself called by name,
"Abraham!"

'He answered: "Who calleth me!"

'Then he heard it said: "I am the angel of God, Gabriel."

'Therefore was Abraham filled with fear; but the angel comforted him,
saying: "Fear not, Abraham, for that thou art friend of God; wherefore,
when thou didst break in pieces the gods of men, thou wert chosen of the
God of the angels and prophets; insomuch that thou art written in the
book of life."

'Then said Abraham: "What ought I to do, to serve the God of the angels
and holy prophets?"

'The angel answered: "Go to that fount and wash thee, for God willeth to
speak with thee."

'Abraham answered: "Now, how ought I to wash me?"

'Then the angel presented himself unto him as a beautiful youth, and
washed himself in the fount, saying: "Do thou in turn likewise to
thyself, O Abraham." When Abraham had washed himself, the angel said:
"Go up that mountain, for God willeth to speak to thee there."

'He ascended the mountain as the angel said to Abraham, and having sat
down upon his knees he said to himself: "When will the God of the angels
speak to me?"

'He heard himself called with a gentle voice: "Abraham!"

'Abraham answered Him: "Who calleth me?"

'The voice answered: "I am thy God, O Abraham."

'Abraham, filled with fear, bent his face to earth, saying: "How shall
thy servant hearken unto thee, who is dust and ashes!"

'Then said God: "Fear not, but rise up, for I have chosen thee for my
servant, and I will to bless thee and make thee increase into a great
people. Therefore go thou forth from the house of thy father and of thy
kindred, and come to dwell in the land which I will give to thee and to
thy seed."

'Abraham answered: "All will I do, Lord; but guard me that none other
god may do me hurt."

'Then spake God, saying: "I am God alone, and there is none other God
but me. I strike down, and make whole; I slay, and give life; I lead
down to hell, and I bring out thereof, and none is able to deliver
himself out of my hands." Then God gave him the covenant of
circumcision; and so our father Abraham knew God.'

And having said this, Jesus lifted up his hands, saying 'To thee be
honour and glory, O God. So be it!'
