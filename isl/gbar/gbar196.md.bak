### 196.

Jesus rejoiced when he heard this, and said: 'See now how good a thing
it is to die! Lazarus hath died once only, and hath learned such
doctrine as is not known to the wisest men in the world that have grown
old among books! Would to God that every man might die once only and
return to the world, like Lazarus, in order that men might learn to
live.

John answered: 'O master, is it permitted to me to speak a word?'

'Speak a thousand,' answered Jesus, 'for just as a man is bound to
dispense his goods in the service of God, so also is he bound to
dispense doctrine: and so much the more is he bound so to do inasmuch as
the word hath power to raise up a soul to penitence, whereas goods
cannot bring back life to the dead. Wherefore he is a murderer who hath
power to help a poor man and when he helpeth him not the poor man dieth
of hunger; but a more grievous murderer is he who could by the word of
God convert the sinner to penitence, and converteth him not, but
standeth, as saith God, "like a dumb dog." Against such saith God: "The
soul of the sinner that shall perish because thou hast hidden my word, I
will require it at thy hands, O unfaithful servant."

'In what condition, then, are now the scribes and Pharisees who have the
key and will not enter, nay hinder them who would fain enter, into
eternal life?

'Thou askest me, O John, permission to speak one word, having listened
to an hundred thousands words of mine. Verily I say unto thee, I am
bound to listen to thee ten times for every one that thou hast listened
to me. And he who will not listen to another, every time that he shall
speak he shall sin; seeing that we ought to do to others that which we
desire for ourselves, and not do to others that which we do not desire
to receive.'

Then said John: 'O master, why hath not God granted this to men, that
they should die once and return as Lazarus hath done, in order that they
might learn to know themselves and their creator?'
