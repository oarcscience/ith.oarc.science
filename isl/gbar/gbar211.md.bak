### 211.

Jesus, being in the house of Nicodemus beyond the brook Cedron,
comforted his disciples, saying: 'The hour is near that I must depart
from the world; console yourselves and be not sad, seeing that where I
go I shall not feel any tribulation.

'Now, shall ye be my friends if ye be sad at my welfare? Nay, assuredly,
but rather enemies. When the world shall rejoice, be ye sad, because the
rejoicing of the world is turned into weeping; but your sadness shall be
turned into joy and your joy shall no one take from you; for the
rejoicing that the heart feeleth in God its creator not the whole world
can take away. See that ye forget not the words which God hath spoken to
you by my mouth. Be ye my witnesses against every one that shall corrupt
the witness that I have witnessed with my gospel against the world, and
against the lovers of the world.
