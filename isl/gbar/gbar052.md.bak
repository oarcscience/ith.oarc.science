### 52.

'The judgment day of God will be so dreadful that, verily I say unto
you, the reprobates would sooner choose ten hells than go to hear God
speak in wrath against them. Against whom all things created will
witness. Verily I say unto you, that not alone shall the reprobates
fear, but the saints and the elect of God, so that Abraham, shall not
trust in his righteousness, and Job shall have no confidence in his
innocence. And what say I? Even the messenger of God shall it fear, for
that God, to make known his majesty, shall deprive his messenger of
memory, so that he shall have no remembrance how that God hath given him
all things. Verily I say unto you that, speaking from the heart, I
tremble because by the world I shall be called God, and for this I shall
have to render an account. As God liveth, in whose presence my soul
standeth, I am a mortal man as other men are, for although God has
placed me as prophet over the house of Israel for the health of the
feeble and the correction of sinners, I am the servant of God, and of
this ye are witness, how I speak against those wicked men who after my
departure from the world shall annul the truth of my gospel by the
operation of Satan. But I shall return towards the end, and with me
shall come Enoch and Elijah, and we will testify against the wicked,
whose end shall be accursed.' And having thus spoken, Jesus shed tears,
whereat his disciples wept aloud, and lifted their voices, saying:
'Pardon, O Lord God, and have mercy on thy innocent servant.' Jesus
answered: 'Amen, Amen.'
