### 169.

Jesus answered: 'Hearken, and I will tell you of what manner is
paradise, and how the holy and the faithful shall abide there without
end, for this is one of the greatest blessings of paradise, seeing that
everything, however great, if it have an end, becometh small, yea
nought.

'Paradise is the home where God storeth his delights, which are so great
that the ground which is trodden by the feet of the holy and blessed
ones is so precious that one drachm ofit is more precious than a
thousand worlds.

'These delights were seen by our father, David, prophet of God, for God
showed them unto him, seeing he caused him to behold the glories of
paradise; whereupon, when he returned to himself, he closed his eyes
with both his hands, and weeping said: "Look not any more upon this
world, O mine eyes, for all is vain, and there is no good!"

'Of these delights said Isaiah the prophet: "The eyes of man have not
seen, his ears have not heard, nor hath the human heart conceived, that
which God hath prepared for them that love him." Know ye wherefore they
have not seen, heard, conceived such delights? It is because while they
live here below they are not worthy to behold such things. Wherefore,
albeit our father David verily saw them, I tell you that he saw them not
with human eyes, for God took his soul unto himself, and thus, united
with God, he saw them with light divine. As God liveth, in whose
presence my soul standeth, seeing that the delights of paradise are
infinite and man is finite, man cannot contain them; even as a little
earthen jar cannot contain the sea.

'Behold, then how beautiful is the world in summer-time, when all things
bear fruit! The very peasant, intoxicated with gladness by reason of the
harvest that is come, maketh the valleys and mountains resound with his
singing, for that he loveth his labours supremely. Now lift up even so
your heart to paradise, where all things are fruitful with fruits
proportionate to him who hath cultivated it.

'As God liveth, this is sufficient for the knowledge of paradise,
forasmuch as God hath created paradise for the home of his own delights.
Now think ye that immeasurable goodness would not have things
immeasurably good? Or that immeasurable beauty would not have things
immeasurably beautiful? Beware, for ye err greatly if ye think he have
them not.
