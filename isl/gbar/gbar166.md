### 166.

Andrew replied: 'But how is that to be understood which God said to
Moses, that he will have mercy on whom he willeth to have mercy and will
harden whom he willeth to harden?'

Jesus answered: 'God saith this in order that man may not believe that
he is saved by his own virtue, but may perceive that life and the mercy
of God have been granted him by God of his bounty. And he saith it in
order that men may shun the opinion that there be other gods than he.

'If, therefore, he hardened Pharaoh he did it because he had afflicted
our people and essayed to bring it to nought by destroying all the male
children in Israel: whereby Moses was nigh to losing his life

'Accordingly, I say unto you verily, that predestination hath for its
foundation the law of God and human free will. Yea, and even if God
could save the whole world so that none should perish he would not will
do so lest thus he should deprive man of freedom, which he preserveth to
him in order to do despite to Satan, in order that this \[lump of\] clay
scorned of the spirit, even though it shall sin as the spirit did, may
have power to repent and go to dwell in that place whence the spirit was
cast out. Our God willeth, I say, to pursue with his mercy man's free
will, and willeth not to forsake the creature with his omnipotence. And
so on the day of judgement none will be able to make any excuse for
their sins, seeing that it will then be manifest to them how much God
hath done for their conversion, and how often he hath called them to
repentance.
