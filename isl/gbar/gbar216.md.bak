### 216.

Judas entered impetuously before all into the chamber whence Jesus had
been taken up. And the disciples were sleeping. Whereupon the wonderful
God acted wonderfully, insomuch that Judas was so changed in speech and
in face to be like Jesus that we believed him to be Jesus. And he,
having awakened us, was seeking where the Master was. Whereupon we
marvelled, and answered: 'Thou, Lord, art our master; hast thou now
forgotten us?'

And he, smiling, said: 'Now are ye foolish, that know not me to be Judas
Iscariot!'

And as he was saying this the soldiery entered, and laid their hands
upon Judas, because he was in every way like to Jesus.

We having heard Judas' saying, and seeing the multitude of soldiers,
fled as beside ourselves.

And John, who was wrapped in a linen cloth, awoke and fled, and when a
soldier seized him by the linen cloth he left the linen cloth and fled
naked. For God heard the prayer of Jesus, and saved the eleven from
evil.
