### 218.

Then returned each man to his house. He who writeth, with John and James
his brother, went with the mother of Jesus to Nazareth.

Those disciples who did not fear God went by night \[and\] stole the
body of Judas and hid it, spreading a report that Jesus was risen again;
whence great confusion arose. The high priest then commanded, under pain
of Anathema, that no one should talk of Jesus of Nazareth. And so there
arose a great persecution, and many were stoned and many beaten, and
many banished from the land, because they could not hold their peace on
such a matter.

The news reached Nazareth how that Jesus, their fellow-citizen, having
died on the cross was risen again. Whereupon, he that writeth prayed the
mother of Jesus that she would be pleased to leave off weeping, because
her son was risen again. Hearing this, the Virgin Mary, weeping, said:
'Let us go to Jerusalem to find my son. I shall die content when I have
seen him.'
