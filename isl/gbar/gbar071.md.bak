### 71.

Jesus having arrived in his own country, it was spread through all the
region of Galilee how that Jesus the prophet was come to Nazareth.
Whereupon with diligence sought they the sick and brought them to him,
beseeching him that he would touch them with his hands. And so great was
the multitude that a certain rich man sick of the palsy, not being able
to get himself carried through the door, had himself carried up to the
roof of the house in which Jesus was, and having caused the roof to be
uncovered, and himself let down by sheets in front of Jesus. Jesus stood
for a moment in hesitation, and then he said: 'Fear not, brother, for
thy sins are forgiven thee.'

Everyone was offended hearing this, and they said: 'And who is this who
forgiveth sins?'

Then said Jesus: 'As God liveth, I am not able to forgive sins, nor is
any man, but God alone forgiveth. But as servant of God I can beseech
him for the sins of others: and so I have besought him for this sick
man, and I am sure that God hath heard my prayer. Wherefore, that ye may
know the truth, I say to this sick man: "In the name of the God of our
fathers, the God of Abraham and his sons, rise up healed!"' And when
Jesus had said this the sick man rose up healed, and glorified God.

Then the common people besought Jesus that he would beseech God for the
sick who stood outside. Whereupon Jesus went out unto them, and, having
lifted up his hands, said: 'Lord God of hosts, the living God, the true
God, the holy God, that never will die; have mercy upon them!' Whereupon
every one answered: 'Amen.' And this having been said, Jesus laid his
hands upon the sick folk, and they all received their health.

Thereupon they magnified God, saying: 'God hath visited us by his
prophet, and a great prophet hath God sent unto us.'
