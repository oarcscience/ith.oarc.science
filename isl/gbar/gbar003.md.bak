### 3. Wonderful birth of Jesus and appearance of angels praising God.

There reigned at that time in Judaea Herod, by decree of Caesar
Augustus, and Pilate was governor in the priesthood of Annas and
Caiaphas. Wherefore, by decree of Augustus, all the world was enrolled;
wherefore each one went to his own country, and they presented
themselves by their own tribes to be enrolled. Joseph accordingly
departed from Nazareth, a city of Galilee, with Mary his wife, great
with child, to go to Bethlehem (for that it was his city, he being of
the lineage of David), in order that he might be enrolled according to
the decree of Caesar. Joseph having arrived at Bethlehem, for that the
city was small, and great the multitude of them that were strangers
there, he found no place, wherefore he took lodging outside the city in
a lodging made for a shepherds' shelter. While Joseph abode there the
days were fulfilled for Mary to bring forth. The virgin was surrounded
by a light exceeding bright, and brought forth her son without pain,
whom she took in her arms, and wrapping him in swaddling-clothes, laid
him in the manger, because there was no room in the inn. There came with
gladness a great multitude of angels to the inn, blessing God and
announcing peace to them that fear God. Mary and Joseph praised the Lord
for the birth of Jesus, and with greatest joy nurtured him.
