### 137.

'Then shall the messenger of God say: "O Lord, there are of the faithful
who have been in hell seventy thousand years. Where, O Lord, is thy
mercy? I pray thee, Lord, to free them from those bitter punishments."

'Then shall God command the four favourite angels of God that they go to
hell and take out every one that hath the faith of his messenger, and
lead him into paradise. And this they shall do.

'And such shall be the advantage of the faith of God's messenger, that
those that shall have believed in him, even though they have not done
any good works, seeing they died in this faith, shall go into paradise
after the punishment of which I have spoken.'
