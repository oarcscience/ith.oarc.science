### 8. Jesus is carried in flight to Egypt, and Herod massacres the innocent children.

Herod seeing that the magi did not return, believed himself mocked of
them; whereupon he determined to put to death the child that was born.
But behold while Joseph was sleeping there appeared to him the angel of
the Lord, saying: 'Arise up quickly, and take the child with his mother
and go into Egypt, for Herod willeth to slay him.' Joseph arose with
great fear, and took Mary with the child, and they went into Egypt, and
there they abode until the death of Herod; who, believing himself
derided of the magi, sent his soldiers to slay all the new-born children
in Bethlehem. The soldiers therefore came and slew all the children that
were there, as Herod had commanded them. Whereby were fulfilled the
words of the prophet, saying: 'Lamentation and great weeping are there
in Ramah; Rachel lamenteth for her sons, but consolation is not given
her because they are not.'
