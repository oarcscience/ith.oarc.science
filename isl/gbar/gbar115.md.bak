### 115.

'Let man say somewhat to me. What hath he brought into the world, by
reason of which he would live in idleness? Certain it is that he was
born naked, and incapable of anything. Hence, of all that he has found,
he is not the owner, but the dispenser. And he will have to render an
account thereof in that dreadful day. The abominable lust, that maketh
man like the brute beasts, ought greatly to be feared; for the enemy is
of one's own household, so that it is not possible to go into any place
whither thine enemy may not come. Ah, how many have perished through
lust! Through lust came the deluge, insomuch that the world perished
before the mercy of God and so that there were saved only Noah and
eighty-three human persons.

'For lust God overwhelmed three wicked cities whence escaped only Lot
and his two children.

'For lust the tribe of Benjamin was all but extinguished. And I tell you
verily that if I should narrate to you how many have perished through
lust, the space of five days would not suffice.'

James answered: 'O Master, what signifieth lust?'

Jesus answered: 'Lust is an unbridled desire of love, which, not being
directed by reason, bursts the bounds of man's intellect and affections;
so that the man, not knowing himself, loveth that which he ought to
hate. Believe me, when a man loveth a thing, not because God hath given
him such thing, but as its owner, he is a fornicator; for that the soul,
which ought to abide in union with God its creator, he hath united with
the creature. And so God lamenteth by Isaiah the prophet, saying: "Thou
hast committed fornication with many lovers; nevertheless, return unto
me and I will receive thee."

'As God liveth in whose presence my soul standeth, if there were not
internal lust within the heart of man, he would not fall into the
external; for if the root be removed the tree dieth speedily.

'Let a man content himself therefore with the wife whom his creator hath
given him, and let him forget every other woman.'

Andrew answered: 'How shall a man forget the women if he live in the
city where there are so many of them?'

Jesus replied: 'O Andrew, certain it is he who liveth in the city, it
will do him harm; seeing that the city is a sponge that draweth in every
iniquity.
