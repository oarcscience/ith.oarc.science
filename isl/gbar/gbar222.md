### 222.

After Jesus had departed, the disciples scattered through the different
parts of Israel and of the world, and the truth, hated of Satan, was
persecuted, as it always is, by falsehood. For certain evil men,
pretending to be disciples, preached that Jesus died and rose not again.
Others preached that he really died, but rose again. Others preached,
and yet preach, that Jesus is the Son of God, among whom is Paul
deceived. But we, as much as I have written, that preach we to those who
fear God, that they may be saved in the last day of God's Judgment.
Amen.
