### 172.

'God saith thus to him that loveth him, and serveth him faithfully: "Go
and consider the sands of the sea, O my servant, how many they are.
Wherefore, if the sea should give thee one single grain of sand, would
it appear small to thee? Assuredly, yea. As I, thy creator, live, all
that I have given in this world to all the princes and kings of the
earth is less than a grain of sand that the sea would give thee, in
comparison of that which I will give thee in my paradise."'
