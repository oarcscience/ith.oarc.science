<P>'Tell me, brother, thou that art a doctor learned in the law&#8212;in whom was the promise of the Messiah made to our father Abraham? In Isaac or in Ishmael?'</P>

<P>The scribe answered: 'O master, I fear to tell thee this, because of the penalty of death.'</P>

<P>Then said Jesus: 'Brother, I am grieved that I came to eat bread in thy house, since thou lovest this present life more than God thy creator; and for this cause thou fearest to lose thy life, but fearest not to lose the faith and the life eternal, which is lost when the tongue speaketh contrary to that which the heart knoweth of the law of God.'</P>

<P>Then the good scribe wept, and said: 'O master, if I had known how to bear fruit, I should have preached many things which I have left unsaid lest sedition should be roused among the people.'</P>

<P>Jesus answered: 'Thou shouldst respect neither the people, nor all the world, nor all the holy ones, nor all the angels, when it should cause offence to God. Wherefore let the whole [world] perish rather than offend God thy creator, and preserve it not with sin. For sin destroyeth and preserveth not, and God is mighty to create as many worlds as there are sands in the sea, and more.'</P>
