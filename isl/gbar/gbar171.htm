<P>'What think ye,' said Jesus to his disciples, 'of paradise? Is there a mind that could comprehend such riches and delights? Man must needs have a knowledge as great as God's if he would know what God willeth to give to his servants.</P>

<P>'Have ye seen when Herod maketh a present to one of his favourite barons, in what sort he presenteth it?'</P>

<P>John answered: 'I have seen it twice; and assuredly the tenth part of that which he giveth would be sufficient for a poor man.'</P>

<P>Said Jesus: 'But if a poor man shall be presented to Herod what will he give to him?'</P>

<P>John answered: 'One or two mites.'</P>

<P>'Now let this be your book wherein to study the knowledge of paradise,' [said Jesus]: 'because all that God hath given to man in this present world for his body is as though Herod should give a mite to a poor man; but what God will give to the body and soul in paradise is as though Herod should give all that he hath, yea and his own life, to one of his servants.'</P>
