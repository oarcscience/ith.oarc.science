### 175.

'God saith thus in Isaiah the prophet, pouring contempt on the
reprobate: "My servants shall sit at my table in mine house and shall
feast joyfully, with gladness and with the sound of harps and organs,
and I will not suffer them to have need of anything. But ye that are
mine enemies shall be cast away from me, where ye shall die in misery,
while every servant of mine despiseth you."
