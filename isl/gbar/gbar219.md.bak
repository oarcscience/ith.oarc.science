### 219.

The Virgin returned to Jerusalem with him who writeth, and James and
John, on that day on which the decree of the high priest went forth.

Whereupon, the Virgin, who feared God, albeit she knew the decree of the
high priest to be unjust, commanded those who dwelt with her to forget
her son. Then how each one was affected!—God who discerneth the heart of
men knoweth that between grief at the death of Judas whom we believed to
be Jesus our master, and the desire to see him risen again, we, with the
mother of Jesus, were consumed.

So the angels that were guardians of Mary ascended to the third heaven,
where Jesus was in the company of angels and recounted all to him.

Wherefore Jesus prayed God that he would give him power to see his
mother and his disciples. Then the merciful God commanded his four
favorite angels, who are Gabriel, Michael, Rafael, and Uriel, to bear
Jesus into his mother's house, and there keep watch over him for three
days continually, suffering him only to be seen by them that believed in
his doctrine.

Jesus came, surrounded with splendour, to the room where abode Mary the
Virgin with her two sisters, and Martha and Mary Magdalen and Lazarus,
and him who writeth, and John and James and Peter. Whereupon, through
fear they fell as dead. And Jesus lifted up his mother and the others
from the ground, saying: 'Fear not, for I am Jesus; and weep not for I
am alive and not dead.' They remained every one for a long time beside
himself at the presence of Jesus, for they altogether believed that
Jesus was dead. Then the Virgin, weeping, said: 'Tell me, my son,
wherefore God, having given thee power to raise the dead, suffered thee
to die, to the shame of thy kinsfolk and friends, and to the shame of
thy doctrine? For every one that loveth thee hath been as dead.'
