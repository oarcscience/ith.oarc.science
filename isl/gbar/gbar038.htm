<P>Then answered John: 'Master, let us wash ourselves as God</P>
<P>commanded by Moses.'</P>

<P>Jesus said: 'Think ye that I am come to destroy the law and</P>
<P>the prophets? Verily I say unto you, as God liveth, I am not come to</P>
<P>destroy it, but rather to observe it. For every prophet hath observed</P>
<P>the law of God and all that God by the other prophets hath spoken.</P>
<P>As God liveth, in whose presence my soul standeth, no one that</P>
<P>breaketh one least precept can be pleasing to God, but shall be least</P>
<P>in the kingdom of God, for he shall have no part there. Moreover I</P>
<P>say unto you, that one syllable of the law of God cannot be broken</P>
<P>without the gravest sin. But I do you to wit that it is necessary to</P>
<P>observe that which God saith by Isaiah the prophet, with these</P>
<P>words: "Wash you and be clean, take away your thoughts from</P>
<P>mine eyes."</P>

<P>'Verily I say unto you, that all the water of the sea will not wash</P>
<P>him who with his heart loveth iniquities. And furthermore I say unto</P>
<P>you, that no one will make prayer pleasing to God if he be not washed,</P>
<P>but will burden his soul with sin like to idolatry.</P>

<P>'Believe me, in sooth, that if man should make prayer to God</P>
<P>as is fitting, he would obtain all that he should ask. Remember</P>
<P>Moses the servant of God, who with his prayer scourged Egypt,</P>
<P>opened the Red Sea, and there drowned Pharaoh and his host.</P>
<P>Remember Joshua, who made the sun stand still, Samuel, who</P>
<P>smote with fear the innumerable host of the Philistines, Elijah, who</P>
<P>made the fire to rain from heaven, Elisha raised a dead man, and so</P>
<P>many other holy prophets, who by prayer obtained all that they</P>
<P>asked. But those men truly did not seek their own in their matters,</P>
<P>but sought only God and his honour.'</P>
