### 163.

Jesus went into the wilderness beyond Jordan with his disciples, and
when the midday prayer was done he sat down near to a palm-tree, and
under the shadow of the palm-tree his disciples sat down.

Then said Jesus: 'So secret is predestination, O brethren, that I say
unto you, verily, only to one man shall it be clearly known. He it is
whom the nations look for, to whom the secrets of God are so clear that,
when he cometh into the world, blessed shall they be that shall listen
to his words, because God shall overshadow them with his mercy even as
this palm-tree overshadoweth us. "Yea, even as this tree protecteth us
from the burning heat of the sun, even so the mercy of God will protect
from Satan them that believe in that man.'

The disciples answered, 'O Master, who shall that man be of whom thou
speakest, who shall come into the world?'

Jesus answered with joy of heart: 'He is Mohammed, messenger of God, and
when he cometh into the world, even as the rain maketh the earth to bear
fruit when for a long time it hath not rained, even so shall he be
occasion of good works among men, through the abundant mercy which he
shall bring. For he is a white cloud full of the mercy of God, which
mercy God shall sprinkle upon the faithful like rain.'
