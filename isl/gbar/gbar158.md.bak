### 158.

The man born blind went to find Jesus, who comforted him saying: 'At no
time hast thou been so blessed as thou art now, for thou art blest of
our God who spake through David, our father and his prophet, against the
friends of the world, saying: "They curse and I bless"; and by Micah the
prophet he said: "I curse your blessing." For earth is not so contrary
to air, water to fire, light to darkness, cold to heat, or love to hate,
as is the will that God hath contrary to the will of the world.'

The disciples accordingly asked him, saying: 'Lord, great are thy words;
tell us, therefore, the meaning, for as yet we understand not.'

Jesus answered: "When ye shall know the world, ye shall see that I have
spoken the truth, and so shall ye know the truth in every prophet.

'Know ye, then, that there be three kinds of worlds comprehended in a
single name: the one standeth for the heavens and the earth, with water,
air and fire, and all the things that are inferior to man. Now this
world in all things followeth the will of God, for, as saith David,
prophet of God: "God hath given them a precept which they transgress
not."

'The second standeth for all men, even as the "house of such an one"
standeth not for the walls, but for the family. Now this world, again,
loveth God; because by nature they long after God, forasmuch as
according to nature every one longeth after God, even though they err in
seeking God. And know ye wherefore all long after God? Because they long
every one after an infinite good without any evil, and this is God
alone. Therefore the merciful God hath sent his prophets to this world
for its salvation.

'The third world is man's fallen condition of sinning, which hath
transformed itself into a law contrary to God, the creator of the world.
This maketh man become like unto the demons, God's enemies. And this
world our God hateth so sore that if the prophets had loved this
world—what think ye? Assuredly God would have taken from them their
prophecy. And what shall I say? As God liveth, in whose presence my soul
standeth, when the messenger of God shall come to the world, if he
should conceive love towards this evil world, assuredly, God would take
away from him all that he gave him when he created him, and would make
him reprobate: so greatly is God contrary to this world.'
