### 24. Notable example how one ought to flee from banqueting and feasting.

Having said this, Jesus wept, saying: 'Woe to those who are servants to
their flesh, for they are sure not to have any good in the other life,
but only torments for their sins. I tell you that there was a rich
glutton who paid no heed to aught but gluttony, and so every day held a
splendid feast. There stood at his gate a poor man by name Lazarus, who
was full of wounds, and was fain to have those crumbs that fell from the
glutton's table. But no one gave them to him; nay, all mocked him. Only
the dogs had pity on him, for they licked his wounds. It came to pass
that the poor man died, and the angels carried him to the arms of
Abraham our father. The rich man also died, and the devils carried him
to the arms of Satan; whereupon, undergoing the greatest torment, he
lifted up his eyes and from afar saw Lazarus in the arms of Abraham.
Then cried the rich man: "O father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send
Lazarus, who upon his fingers may bring me a drop of water to cool my
tongue, which is tormented in this flame."

'Abraham answered: "Son, remember that thou receivedst thy good in the
other life and Lazarus his evil: wherefore now thou shalt be in torment,
and Lazarus in consolation."

'The rich man cried out again, saying: "O father Abraham, in my house
there are three brethren of mine. Therefore send Lazarus to announce to
them how much I am suffering, in order that they may repent and not come
hither."

'Abraham answered: "They have Moses and the prophets, let I them hear
them."

'The rich man answered: "Nay, father Abraham; but if one dead shall
arise they will believe."

'Abraham answered: "Whoso believeth not Moses and the prophets will not
believe even the dead if they should arise."

'See then whether the poor are blessed,' said Jesus, 'who have patience,
and only desire that which is necessary, hating the flesh. O wretched
they, who bear others to the burial, to give their flesh for food of
worms, and do not learn the truth. So far from it that they live here
like immortals, for they build great houses and purchase great revenues
and live in pride."
