### 10. Jesus, at the age of thirty years, on Mount Olives, miraculously receiveth the gospel from the angel Gabriel.

Jesus having come to the age of thirty years, as he himself said unto
me, went up to Mount Olives with his mother to gather olives. Then at
midday as he was praying, when he came to these words: 'Lord, with
mercy...,' he was surrounded by an exceeding bright light and by an
infinite multitude of angels, who were saying: 'Blessed be God.' The
angel Gabriel presented to him as it were a shining mirror, a book,
which descended into the heart of Jesus, in which he had knowledge of
what God hath done and what hath said and what God willeth insomuch that
everything was laid bare and open to him; as he said unto me: 'Believe,
Barnabas, that I know every prophet with every prophecy, insomuch that
whatever I say the whole hath come forth from that book.'

Jesus, having received this vision, and knowing that he was a prophet
sent to the house of Israel, revealed all to Mary his mother, telling
her that he needs must suffer great persecution for the honour of God,
and that he could not any longer abide with her to serve her. Whereupon,
having heard this, Mary answered: 'Son, ere thou wast born all was
announced to me; wherefore blessed be the holy name of God.' Jesus
departed therefore that day from his mother to attend to his prophetic
office.
