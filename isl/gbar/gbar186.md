### 186.

'When Obadiah desired to teach anyone how to pray, he would call Haggai
and say: "Recite here thy prayer so that every one may hear thy words."
Then Haggai would say: "Lord God of Israel, with mercy look upon thy
servant, who calleth upon thee, for that thou hast created him.
Righteous Lord God, remember thy righteousness and punish the sins of
thy servant in order that I may not pollute thy work. Lord my God, I
cannot ask thee for the delights that thou grantest to thy faithful
servants, because I do nought but sins. Wherefore, Lord, when thou
wouldst give an infirmity to one of thy servants, remember me thy
servant, for thine own glory."

'And when Haggai did so,' said the scribe, 'God so loved him that to
every one who in his time stood by him God gave \[the gift of\]
prophecy. And nothing did Haggai ask in prayer that God withheld.'
