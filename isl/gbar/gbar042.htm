<P>Then the disciples wept after this discourse, and Jesus was weeping, when they saw many who came to find him, for the chiefs of the priests took counsel among themselves to catch him in his talk. Wherefore they sent the Levites and some of the scribes to question him, saying: 'Who art thou?'</P>

<P>Jesus confessed, and said the truth: 'I am not the Messiah.'</P>

<P>They said: 'Art thou Elijah or Jeremiah, or any of the ancient prophets?'</P>

<P>Jesus answered: 'No.'</P>

<P>Then said they: 'Who art thou? Say, in order that we may give testimony to those who sent us.'</P>

<P>Then said Jesus: 'I am a voice that crieth through all Judea, and crieth: "Prepare ye the way for the messenger of the Lord," even as it is written in Esaias.'</P>

<P>They said: 'If thou be not the Messiah nor Elijah, or any prophet, wherefore dost thou preach new doctrine, and make thyself of more account than the Messiah?'</P>

<P>Jesus answered: 'The miracles which God worketh by my hands show that I speak that which God willeth; nor indeed do I make myself to be accounted as him ofwhom ye speak. For I am not worthy to unloose the ties of the hosen or the latchets of the shoes of the messenger of God whom ye call "Messiah," who was made before me, and shall come after me, and shall bring the words of truth, so that his faith shall have no end.'</P>

<P>The Levites and scribes departed in confusion, and recounted all to the chiefs of the priests, who said: 'He hath the devil on his back who recounteth all to him.'</P>

<P>Then said Jesus to his disciples: 'Verily I say unto you, that the chiefs and the elders of our people seek occasion against me.'</P>

<P>Then said Peter: 'Therefore go not thou any more into Jerusalem.'</P>

<P>Therefore said Jesus unto him: 'Thou art foolish, and knowest not what thou sayest, for it is necessary that I should suffer many persecutions, because so have suffered all the prophets and holy ones of God. But fear not, for there be that are with us and there be that are against us.'</P>

<P>And having said this, Jesus departed and went to the mount Tabor, and there ascended with him Peter and James and John his brother, with him who writeth this. Whereupon there shone a great light above him, and his garments became white like snow and his face glistened as the sun, and lo! there came Moses and Elijah speaking with Jesus concerning all that needs must come upon our race and upon the holy city.</P>

<P>Peter spake, saying: 'Lord, it is good to be here. Therefore, if thou wilt, we will make here three tabernacles, one for thee and one for Moses and the other for Elijah.' And while he spake they were covered with a white cloud, and they heard a voice saying: 'Behold my servant, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.'</P>

<P>The disciples were filled with fear, and fell with their face upon the earth as dead. Jesus went down and raised up his disciples, saying: 'Fear not, for God loveth you, and hath done this in order that ye may believe on my words.'</P>
