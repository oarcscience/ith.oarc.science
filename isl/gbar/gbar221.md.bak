### 221.

And Jesus turned himself to him who writeth, and said: 'See, Barnabas,
that by all means thou write my gospel concerning all that hath happened
through my dwelling in the world. And write in like manner that which
hath befallen Judas, in order that the faithful may be undeceived, and
every one may believe the truth.'

Then answered he who writeth: 'All will I do, if God will, O Master; but
how it happened unto Judas, I know not, for I saw not all.'

Jesus answered: 'Here are John and Peter who have seen all, and they
will tell you all that has passed.'

And then Jesus commanded us to call his faithful disciples that they
might see him. Then did James and John call together the seven disciples
with Nicodemus and Joseph, and many other of the seventy-two, and they
ate with Jesus.

The third day Jesus said: 'Go to the Mount of Olives with my mother, for
there will I ascend again unto heaven, and ye will see who shall bear me
up.'

So there went all, saving twenty-five of the seventy-two disciples, who
for fear had fled to Damascus. And as they all stood in prayer, at
mid-day came Jesus with a great multitude of angels who were praising
God: and the splendour of his face made them sore afraid, and they fell
with their faces to the ground. But Jesus lifted them up, comforting
them, and saying: 'Be not afraid, I am your master.'

And he reproved many who believed him to have died and risen again,
saying: 'Do ye then hold me and God for liars? For God hath granted to
me to live almost unto the end of the world, even as I said unto you.
Verily I say unto you, I died not, but Judas the traitor. Beware, for
Satan will make every effort to deceive you, but be ye my witnesses in
all Israel, and throughout the world, of all things that ye have heard
and seen.'

And having thus spoken, he prayed God for the salvation of the faithful,
and the conversion of sinners. And, his prayer ended, he embraced his
mother, saying: 'Peace be unto thee, my mother, rest thou in God who
created thee and me.' And having thus spoken, he turned to his
disciples, saying: 'May God's grace and mercy be with you.'

Then before their eyes the four angels carried him up into heaven.
