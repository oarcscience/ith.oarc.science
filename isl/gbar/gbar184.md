### 184.

'Tell me, is this true?' said Jesus.

The disciples and the scribe answered: 'It is most true.'

Then said Jesus: 'He who in truth of heart recognizeth God as the author
of all good, and himself as the author of sin, shall be truly humble.
But whoso shall speak with the tongue as the child speaketh, and shall
contradict \[the same\] in act, assuredly he hath false humility and
true pride.

'For pride is then at its height when it maketh use of humble things,
that it be not reprehended and spurned of men.

'True humility is a lowliness of the soul whereby man knoweth himself in
truth; but false humility is a mist from hell which so darkeneth the
understanding of the soul that what a man ought to ascribe to himself,
he ascribeth to God, and what he ought to ascribe to God, he ascribeth
to himself. Thus, the man of false humility will say that he is a
grievous sinner, but when one telleth him that he is a sinner he will
wax wroth against him, and will persecute him.

'The man of false humility will say that God hath given him all that he
hath, but that he on his part hath not slumbered, but done good works.

'And these Pharisees of this present time, brethren, tell me how they
walk.'

The scribe answered, weeping: 'O master, the Pharisees of the present
time have the garments and the name of Pharisees, but in their heart and
their works they are Canaanites. And would to God they usurped not such
a name, for then would they not deceive the simple! O ancient time, how
cruelly hast thou dealt with us, that hast taken away from us the true
Pharisees and left us the false!'
