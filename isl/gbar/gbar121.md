### 121.

'When the governor hath arrested a prisoner whom he examineth while the
notary writeth down \[the case\], tell me, how doth such a man talk?'

The disciples answered: 'He talketh with fear and to the point, so as
not to give suspicion of himself, and he is careful not to say anything
that may displease the governor, but seeketh to speak somewhat whereby
he may be set free.'

Then answered Jesus: 'This ought the penitent to do, then, in order not
to lose his soul. For that God hath given two angels to every man for
notaries, the one writing the good, the other the evil that the man
doth. If then a man would receive mercy let him measure his talking more
than gold is measured.
