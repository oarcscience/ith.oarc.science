### 179.

Then came the angel Gabriel to Jesus and showed him a mirror shining
like the sun, wherein he beheld written these words: 'As I live
eternally, even as paradise is greater than all the heavens and the
earth, and as the whole earth is greater than a grain of sand, even so
am I greater than paradise; and as many times more as the sea hath
grains of sand, as there are drops of water upon the sea, as there are
\[blades of\] grass upon the ground, as there are leaves upon the trees,
as there are skins upon the beasts; and as many times more as the grains
of sand that would go to fill the heavens and paradise and more.'

Then said Jesus: 'Let us do reverence to our God, who is blessed for
evermore.' Thereupon they bowed their heads an hundred times and
prostrated themselves to earth upon their face in prayer. When the
prayer was done, Jesus called Peter and told him and all the disciples
what he had seen. And to Peter he said: 'Thy soul, which is greater than
all the earth, through one eye seeth the sun, which is a thousand times
greater than all the earth.'

Then said Jesus: 'Even so, through \[the eye of\] paradise, shalt thou
see God our Creator.' And having said this, Jesus gave thanks to God our
Lord, praying for the house of Israel and for the holy city. And every
one answered: 'So be it, Lord.'
