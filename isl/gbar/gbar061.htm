<P>Having thus said, Jesus washed himself, with his disciples, according to the law of God written in the book of Moses; and then they prayed. And the disciples seeing him thus sad spake not at all to him that day, but each stood terror-struck at his words.</P>

<P>Then Jesus opening his mouth after the evening [prayer], said: 'What father of a family if he knew that a thief meant to break into his house, would sleep? None assuredly; for he would watch and stand prepared to slay the thief. Do ye not know then that Satan is as a roaring lion that goeth about seeking whom he may devour. Thus he seeketh to make man sin. Verily I say unto you, that if man would act as the merchant he should have no fear in that day, because he would be well prepared. There was a man who gave money to his neighbors that they might trade with it, and the profit should be divided in a just proportion. And some traded well, so that they doubled the money. But some used the money in the service of the enemy of him who gave them the money, speaking evil of him. Tell me now, when the neighbor shall call the debtors to account how shall the matter go? Assuredly he will reward those who traded well, but against the others his anger shall vent itself in reproaches. And then he will punish them according to the law. As God liveth, in whose presence my soul standeth, the neighbor is God, who has given to man all that he hath, with life itself, so that, [man] living well in this world, God may have praise, and man the glory of paradise. For those who live well double their money by their example, because sinners, seeing their example, are converted to repentance; wherefore men who live well shall be rewarded with a great reward. But wicked sinners, who by their sins halve what God has given them, by their lives spent in the service of Satan the enemy of God, blaspheming God and giving offence to others,&#8212;tell me what shall be their punishment?'</P>

<P>'It shall be without measure,' said the disciples.</P>
