### 9. Jesus, having returned to Judaea, holds a wondrous disputation with the doctors, having come to the age of twelve years.

When Herod was dead, behold the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to
Joseph, saying: 'Return into Judaea, for they are dead that willed the
death of the child.' Joseph therefore took the child with Mary (he
having come to the age of seven years), and came to Judaea; whence,
hearing that Archelaus, son of Herod, was reigning in Judaea, he went
into Galilee, fearing to remain in Judaea; and they went to dwell at
Nazareth.

The child grew in grace and wisdom before God and before men.

Jesus, having come to the age of twelve years, went up with Mary and
Joseph to Jerusalem to worship there according to the law of the Lord
written in the book of Moses. When their prayers were ended they
departed, having lost Jesus, because they thought that he was returned
home with their kinsfolk. Mary therefore returned with Joseph to
Jerusalem, seeking Jesus among kinsfolk and neighbors. The third day
they found the child in the temple, in the midst of the doctors,
disputing with them concerning the law. And every one was amazed at his
questions and answers, saying: 'How can there be such doctrine in him,
seeing he is so small and hath not learned to read?'

Mary reproved him, saying: 'Son, what hast thou done to us? Behold I and
thy father have sought thee for three days sorrowing.' Jesus answered:
'Know ye not that the service of God ought to come before father and
mother?' Jesus then went down with his mother and Joseph to Nazareth,
and was subject to them with humility and reverence.
