### 56.

'God shall open the book in the hand of his messenger, and his messenger
reading therein shall call all the angels and prophets and all the
elect, and on the forehead of each one shall be written the mark of the
messenger of God. And in the book shall be written the glory of
paradise.

'Then shall each pass to the right hand of God; next to whom shall sit
the messenger of God, and the prophets shall sit near him, and the
saints, and the angel shall then sound the trumpet, and shall call Satan
to judgment.
