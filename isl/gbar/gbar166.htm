<P>Andrew replied: 'But how is that to be understood which God said to Moses, that he will have mercy on whom he willeth to have mercy and will harden whom he willeth to harden?'</P>

<P>Jesus answered: 'God saith this in order that man may not believe that he is saved by his own virtue, but may perceive that life and the mercy of God have been granted him by God of his bounty. And he saith it in order that men may shun the opinion that there be other gods than he.</P>

<P>'If, therefore, he hardened Pharaoh he did it because he had afflicted our people and essayed to bring it to nought by destroying all the male children in Israel: whereby Moses was nigh to losing his life</P>

<P>'Accordingly, I say unto you verily, that predestination hath for its foundation the law of God and human free will. Yea, and even if God could save the whole world so that none should perish he would not will do so lest thus he should deprive man of freedom, which he preserveth to him in order to do despite to Satan, in order that this [lump of] clay scorned of the spirit, even though it shall sin as the spirit did, may have power to repent and go to dwell in that place whence the spirit was cast out. Our God willeth, I say, to pursue with his mercy man's free will, and willeth not to forsake the creature with his omnipotence. And so on the day of judgement none will be able to make any excuse for their sins, seeing that it will then be manifest to them how much God hath done for their conversion, and how often he hath called them to repentance.</P>
