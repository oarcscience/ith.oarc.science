### 98.

And having said this, the multitude departed with the priest and the
governor with Herod, having great disputations concerning Jesus and
concerning his doctrine. Whereupon the priest prayed the governor to
write unto Rome to the senate the whole matter; which thing the governor
did; wherefore the senate had compassion on Israel, and decreed that on
pain of death none should call Jesus the Nazarene, prophet of the Jews,
either God or son of God. Which decree was posted up in the temple,
engraved upon copper.

When the greater part of the crowd had departed, there remained about
five thousand men, without women and children; who being wearied by the
journey, having been two days without bread, for that through longing to
see Jesus they had forgotten to bring any, whereupon they ate raw
herbs—therefore they were not able to depart like the others.

Then Jesus, when he perceived this, had pity on them, and said to
Philip: 'Where shall we find bread for them that they perish not of
hunger?'

Philip answered: 'Lord, two hundred pieces of gold could not buy so much
bread that each one should taste a little.' Then said Andrew: 'There is
here a child which hath five loaves and two fishes, but what will it be
among so many?'

Jesus answered: 'Make the multitude sit down.' And they sat down upon
the grass by fifties and by forties. Thereupon said Jesus: 'In the name
of God!' And he took the bread, and prayed to God and then brake the
bread, which he gave to the disciples, and the disciples gave it to the
multitude; and so did they with the fishes. Everyone ate and every one
was satisfied. Then said Jesus: 'Gather up that which is over. So the
disciples gathered fragments, and filled twelve baskets. Thereupon every
one put his hand to his eyes, saying: 'Am I awake, or do I dream?' And
they remained, every one, for the space of an hour, as it were beside
themselves by reason of the great miracle.

Afterwards Jesus, when he had given thanks to God, dismissed them, but
there were seventy-two men that willed not to leave him; wherefore
Jesus, perceiving their faith, chose them for disciples.
