### 109.

Jesus answered: 'Even so I tell you that ye ought to watch with the soul
by the sun of justice \[which is\] our God, and not to boast yourselves
of the watchings of the body. It is most true, therefore, that bodily
sleep is to be avoided as much as is possible, but \[to avoid it\]
altogether is impossible, the sense and the flesh being weighed down
with food and the mind with business. Wherefore let him that will sleep
little avoid too much business and much food.

'As God liveth, in whose presence standeth my soul, it is lawful to
sleep somewhat every night, but it is never lawful to forget God and his
fearful judgement: and the sleep of the soul is such oblivion.'

Then answered he who writeth: 'O master, how can we always have God in
memory? Assuredly, it seemeth to us impossible.'

Said Jesus, with a sigh: 'This is the greatest misery that man can
suffer, O Barnabas. For man cannot here upon earth have God his creator
always in memory; saving them that are holy, for they always have God in
memory, because they have in them the light of the grace of God, so that
they cannot forget God. But tell me, have ye seen them that work
quarried stones, how by their constant practice they have so learned to
strike that they speak with others and all the time are striking the
iron tool that worketh the stone without looking at the iron, and yet
they do not strike their hands? Now do ye likewise. Desire to be holy if
ye wish to overcome entirely this misery of forgetfulness. Sure it is
that water cleaveth the hardest rocks with a single drop striking there
for a long period.

'Do ye know why ye have not overcome this misery? Because ye have not
perceived that it is sin. I tell you then that it is an error, when a
prince giveth thee a present, O man, that thou shouldst shut thine eyes
and turn thy back upon him. Even so do they err who forget God, for at
all times man receiveth from God gifts and mercy.
