### 220.

Jesus replied, embracing his mother: 'Believe me, mother, for verily I
say to thee that I have not been dead at all; for God hath reserved me
till near the end of the world.' And having said this he prayed the four
angels that they would manifest themselves, and give testimony how the
matter had passed.

Thereupon the angels manifested themselves like four shining suns,
insomuch that through fear every one again fell down as dead.

Then Jesus gave four linen cloths to the angels that they might cover
themselves, in order that they might be seen and heard to speak by his
mother and her companions. And having lifted up each one, he comforted
them, saying: 'These are the ministers of God: Gabriel, who announceth
God's secrets; Michael, who fighteth against God's enemies; Rafael, who
receiveth the souls of them that die; and Uriel, who will call every one
to the judgment of God at the last day.'

Then the four angels narrated to the Virgin how God had sent for Jesus,
and had transformed Judas, that he might suffer the punishment to which
he had sold another.

Then said he who writeth: 'O Master, is it lawful for me to question
thee now, as it was lawful for me when thou dwelledst with us?'

Jesus answered: 'Ask what thou pleasest, Barnabas, and I will answer
thee.'

Then said he who writeth: 'O Master, seeing that God is merciful,
wherefore hath he so tormented us, making us to believe that thou wert
dead? And thy mother hath so wept for thee that she hath been nigh to
death; and thou, who art an holy one of God, on thee hath God suffered
to fall the calumny that thou wert slain amongst robbers on the Mount
Calvary?'

Jesus answered: 'Believe me, Barnabas, that every sin, however small it
be, God punisheth with great punishment, seeing that God is offended at
sin. Wherefore, since my mother and my faithful disciples that were with
me loved me a little with earthly love, the righteous God hath willed to
punish this love with the present grief, in order that it may not be
punished in the flames of Hell. And though I have been innocent in the
world, since men have called me "God," and "Son of God," God, in order
that I be not mocked of the demons on the day of judgment, hath willed
that I be mocked of men in this world by the death of Judas, making all
men to believe that I died upon the cross. And this mocking shall
continue until the advent of Mohammed, the messenger of God, who, when
he shall come, shall reveal this deception to those who believe in God's
law.'

Having thus spoken, Jesus said: 'Thou art just, O Lord our God, because
to thee only belongeth honour and glory without end.'
