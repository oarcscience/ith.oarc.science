### 214.

Having gone forth from the house, Jesus retired into the garden to pray,
according as his custom was to pray, bowing his knees an hundred times
and prostrating himself upon his face. Judas, accordingly, knowing the
place where Jesus was with his disciples, went to the high priest, and
said: 'If ye will give me what was promised, this night will I give into
your hand Jesus whom ye seek: for he is alone with eleven companions.'

The high priest answered: 'How much seekest thou?'

Said Judas, 'Thirty pieces of gold.'

Then straightway the high priest counted unto him the money, and sent a
Pharisee to the governor to fetch soldiers, and to Herod, and they gave
a legion of them, because they feared the people; wherefore they took
their arms, and with torches and lanterns upon staves went out of
Jerusalem.
