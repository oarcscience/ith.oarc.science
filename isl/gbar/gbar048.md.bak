### 48.

At that time the army of the Romans was in Judea, our country being
subject to them for the sins of our forefathers. Now it was the custom
of the Romans to call god and to worship him that did any new thing of
benefit to the common people. And so \[some\] of these soldiers finding
themselves in Nain, they rebuked now one, now another, saying: 'One of
your gods hath visited you, and ye make no account of it. Assuredly if
our gods should visit us we should give them all that we have. And ye
see how much we fear our gods, since to their images we give the best of
all we have.' Satan did so instigate this manner of speaking that he
aroused no small sedition among the people of Nain. But Jesus tarried
not at all in Nain, but turned to go into Capernaum. The discord of Nain
was such that some said: 'He is our God who hath visited us'; others
said: 'God is invisible, so that none hath seen him, not even Moses, his
servant; therefore it is not God, but rather his son.' Others said: 'He
is not God, nor son of God, for God hath not a body to beget withal; but
he is a great prophet of God.'

And so did Satan instigate that, in the third year of the prophetic
ministry of Jesus, great ruin to our people was like to arise therefrom.

Jesus went into Capernaum: whereupon the citizens, when they knew him,
assembled together all the sick folk they had, and placed them in front
of the porch \[of the house\] where Jesus was lodging with his
disciples. And having, called Jesus forth, they besought him for the
health of them. Then Jesus laid his hands upon each of them, saying:
'God of Israel, by thy holy name, give health to this sick person.'
Whereupon each one was healed.

On the sabbath Jesus entered into the synagogue, and thither ran
together all the people to hear him speak.
