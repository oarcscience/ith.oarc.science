### 32.

One skilled in the law invited Jesus to supper, in order to tempt him.
Jesus came thither with his disciples, and many scribes, to tempt him,
waited for him in the house. Whereupon, the disciples sat down to table
without washing their hands. The scribes called Jesus, saying:
'Wherefore do not thy disciples observe the traditions of our elders, in
not washing their hands before they eat bread?'

Jesus answered: 'And I ask you, for what cause have ye annulled the
precept of God to observe your traditions? Ye say to the sons of poor
fathers: "Offer and make vows unto the temple." And they make vows of
that little wherewith they ought to support their fathers. And when
their fathers wish to take money, the sons cry out: "This money is
consecrated to God"; whereby the fathers suffer. O false scribes,
hyprocrites, doth God use this money? Assuredly not, for God eateth not,
as he saith by his servant David the prophet: "Shall I then eat the
flesh of bulls and drink the blood of sheep? Render unto me the
sacrifice of praise, and offer unto me thy vows; for if I should be
hungry I will not ask aught of thee, seeing that all things are in my
hands, and the abundance of paradise is with me." Hypocrites! ye do this
to fill your purse, and therefore ye tithe rue and mint. Oh miserable
ones! for unto others ye show the most clear way, by which ye will not
go.

'Ye scribes and doctors lay upon the shoulders of others weights of
unbearable weight, but ye yourselves the while are not willing to move
them with one of your fingers.

'Verily I say unto you, that every evil hath entered into the world
under the pretext of the elders. Tell me, who made idolatry to enter
into the world, if not the usage of the elders? For there was a king who
exceedingly loved his father, whose name was Baal. Whereupon, when the
father was dead, his son for his own consolation, caused to be made an
image like unto his father, and set it up in the marketplace of the
city. And he made a decree that every one who approached that statue
within a space of fifteen cubits should be safe, and no one on any
account should do him hurt. Hence the malefactors, by reason of the
benefit they received therefrom, began to offer to the statue roses and
flowers, and in a short time the offerings were changed into money and
food, insomuch that they called it god, to honour it. Which thing from
custom was transformed into a law, insomuch that the idol of Baal spread
through all the world; and how much doth God lament this by the prophet
Isaiah, saying: "Truly this people worshippeth me in vain, for they have
annulled my law given to them by my servant Moses, and follow the
traditions of their elders."

'Verily I say unto you, that to eat bread with unclean hands defileth
not a man, because that which entereth into the man defileth not the
man, but that which cometh out of the man defileth the man.'

Thereupon, said one of the scribes: 'If I shall eat pork, or other
unclean meats, will they not defile my conscience?'

Jesus answered: 'Disobedience will not enter into the man, but will come
out of the man, from his heart; and therefore will he be defiled when he
shall eat forbidden food.'

Then said one of the doctors: 'Master, thou hast spoken much against
idolatry as though the people of Israel had idols, and so thou hast done
us wrong.'

Jesus answered: 'I know well that in Israel to-day there are not statues
of wood; but there are statues of flesh.'

Then answered all the scribes in wrath: 'And so we are idolaters?'

Jesus answered: 'Verily I say unto you, the precept saith not "Thou
shalt worship," but "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy soul,
and with all thy heart, and with all thy mind." Is this true?' said
Jesus.

'It is true,' answered every one.
