### 209.

At this time, while the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus, was standing in
prayer, the angel Gabriel visited her and narrated to her the
persecution of her son, saying: 'Fear not, Mary, for God will protect
him from the world.' Wherefore Mary, weeping, departed from Nazareth,
and came to Jerusalem to the house of Mary Salome, her sister, seeking
her son.

But since he had secretly retired beyond the brook Cedron she was not
able to see him any more in this world; save after the deed of shame,
for that the angel Gabriel, with the angels Michael, Rafael, and Uriel,
by command of God brought him to her.
