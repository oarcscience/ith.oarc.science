### 204.

Having said this, Jesus said again: 'Know ye not that there be other
sick folk? As God liveth, they be fewer in Jerusalem that have their
soul sound than they that be sick in body. And in order that ye may know
the truth, I say unto you, O sick folk, in the name of God, let your
sickness depart from you!

And when he had said this, immediately they were healed.

The men wept when they heard of the wrath of God upon Jerusalem, and
prayed for mercy; when Jesus said: "'If Jerusalem shall weep for her
sins and do penance, walking in my ways," saith God, "I will not
remember her iniquities any more, and I will not do unto her any of the
evil which I have said. But Jerusalem weepeth for her ruin and not for
her dishonouring of me, wherewith she hath blasphemed my name among the
nations. Therefore is my fury kindled much more. As I live eternally, if
Job, Abraham, Samuel, David, and Daniel my servants, with Moses, should
pray for this people, my wrath upon Jerusalem will not be appeased."'
And having said this, Jesus retired into the house, while every one
remained in fear.
