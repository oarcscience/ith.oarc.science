### 13. The remarkable fear of Jesus and his prayer, and the wonderful comfort of the angel Gabriel.

Some days having passed, Jesus having in spirit perceived the desire of
the priests, ascended the Mount of Olives to pray. And having passed the
whole night in prayer, in the morning Jesus praying said: 'O Lord, I
know that the scribes hate me, and the priests are minded to kill me,
thy servant; therefore, Lord God almighty and merciful, in mercy hear
the prayers of thy servant, and save me from their snares, for thou art
my salvation. Thou knowest, Lord, that I thy servant seek thee alone, O
Lord, and speak thy word; for thy word is truth, which endureth for
ever.'

When Jesus had spoken these words, behold there came to him the angel
Gabriel, saying: 'Fear not, O Jesus, for a thousand thousand who dwell
above the heaven guard thy garments, and thou shalt not die till
everything be fulfilled, and the world shall be near its end.'

Jesus fell with his face to the ground, saying: 'O great Lord God, how
great is thy mercy upon me, and what shall I give thee, Lord, for all
that thou hast granted me?'

The angel Gabriel answered: 'Arise, Jesus, and remember Abraham, who
being willing to make sacrifice to God of his only-begotten son Ishmael,
to fulfill the word of God, and the knife not being able to cut his son,
at my word offered in sacrifice a sheep. Even so therefore shalt thou
do, O Jesus, servant of God.

Jesus answered: 'Willingly, but where shall I find the lamb, seeing I
have no money, and it is not lawful to steal it?'

Thereupon the angel Gabriel showed unto him a sheep, which Jesus offered
in sacrifice, praising and blessing God, who is glorious for ever.
