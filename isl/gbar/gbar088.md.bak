### 88.

'But beware that thou hold not thyself for better; rather shalt thou say
thus: "Peter, Peter, if God helped thee not with his grace thou wouldst
be worse than he."'

Peter answered: 'How must I correct him?'

Jesus answered: 'In the way that thou thyself wouldst fain be corrected.
And as thou wouldst fain be borne with, so bear with others. Believe me,
Peter, for verily I say unto thee that every time thou shalt correct thy
brother with mercy thou shalt receive mercy of God, and thy words shall
bear some fruit; but if thou shalt do it with rigour, thou shalt be
rigorously punished by the justice of God, and shalt bear no fruit. Tell
me, Peter: Those earthen pots wherein the poor cook their food—do they
wash them, perchance, with stones and iron hammers? Nay, assuredly; but
rather with hot water. Vessels are broken in pieces with iron, things of
wood are burned with fire; but man is amended with mercy. Wherefore,
when thou shalt correct thy brother thou shalt say to thyself: "If God
help me not, I shall do to-morrow worse than all that he hath done
today."'

Peter answered: 'How many times must I forgive my brother, O master?'

Jesus answered: 'As many times as thou wouldst fain be forgiven by him.'

Said Peter: 'Seven times a day?'

Jesus answered: 'Not only seven, but seventy times seven thou shalt
forgive him every day; for he that forgiveth, to him shall it be
forgiven, and he that condemneth shall be condemned.'

Then said he who writeth this: 'Woe unto princes! for they shall go to
hell.'

Jesus reproved him, saying: 'Thou art become foolish, O Barnabas, in
that thou hast spoken thus. Verily I say unto thee, that the bath is not
so necessary for the body, the bit for the horse, and the tiller for the
ship, as the prince is necessary for the state. And for what cause did
God give Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, and Solomon, and so many others
who passed judgement? To such hath God given the sword for the
extirpation of iniquity.'

Then said he who writeth this: 'Now, how ought judgement to be given,
condemning and pardoning?'

Jesus answered: 'Not every one is ajudge: for to the judge alone it
appertaineth to condemn others, O Barnabas. And the judge ought to
condemn the guilty, even as the father commandeth a putrified member to
be cut off from his son in order that the whole body may not become
putrified.'
