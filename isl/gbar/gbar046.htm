<H3>46.</H3>

<P>Again spake Jesus, saying: 'I set before you an example. There was a householder who planted a vineyard, and made a hedge for it in order that it should not be trampled down of beasts. And in the midst of it he built a press for the wine, and thereupon let it out to husbandmen. Whereupon, when the time was come to collect the wine he sent his servants; whom when the husbandmen saw, they stoned some and burned some, and others they ripped open with a knife. And this they did many times. Tell me, what will the lord of the vineyard do to the husbandmen?'</P>

<P>Everyone answered: 'In evil wise will he make them to perish, and his vineyard will he give to other husbandmen.'</P>

<P>Therefore said Jesus: 'Know ye not that the vineyard is the house of Israel, and the husbandmen are the people of Judah and Jerusalem? Woe to you; for God is wroth with you, having ripped open so many prophets of God; so that at the time of Ahab there was not found one to bury the holy ones of God!'</P>

<P>And when he had said this the chiefpriests wished to seize him, but they feared the common people, which magnified him.</P>

<P>Then Jesus, seeing a woman who from her birth had remained with her head bent toward the ground, said: 'Raise thy head, O woman, in the name of our God, in order that these may know that speak truth, and that he willeth that I announce it.'</P>

<P>Then the woman raised herself up whole, magnifying God.</P>

<P>The chief of the priests cried out, saying: 'This man is not sent of God, seeing he keepeth not the sabbath; for today he hath healed an infirm person.'</P>

<P>Jesus answered: 'Now tell me, is it not lawful to speak on the sabbath day, and to make prayer for the salvation of others? And who is there among you who, if on the sabbath his ass or his ox fell into the ditch, would not pull him out on the sabbath? Assuredly none. And shall I then have broken the sabbath day by having given health to a daughter of Israel? Of a surety, here is known thy hypocrisy! Oh, how many are there today that fear the smiting of a straw in another's eye, while a beam is ready to cut off their own head? Oh, how many there are that fear an ant, but reck not of an elephant!'</P>

<P>And having said this, he went forth from the temple. But the priests chafed with rage among themselves, because they were not able to seize him and to work their will upon him, even as their fathers have done against the holy ones of God.</P>
