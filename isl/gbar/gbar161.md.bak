### 161.

'Have ye heard all?' said Jesus.

The disciples answered: 'Yea, Lord.'

Whereupon Jesus said: 'Lying is indeed a sin, but murder is a greater,
because the lie is a sin that appertaineth to him that speaketh, but the
murder, while it appertaineth to him that committeth it, is such that it
destroyeth also the dearest thing that God hath here upon earth, that
is, man. And lying can be remedied by saying the contrary of that which
hath been said; whereas murder hath no remedy, seeing it is not possible
to give life again to the dead. Tell me, then, did Moses the servant of
God sin in slaying all whom he slew?'

The disciples answered: 'God forbid; God forbid that Moses should have
sinned in obeying God who commanded him!'

Then said Jesus: 'And I say, God forbid that that angel should have
sinned who deceived Ahab's false prophets with the lie; for even as God
receiveth the slaughter of men as sacrifice, so received he the lie for
praise. Verily, verily, I say unto you, that even as the child erreth
which causeth its shoes to be made by the measure of a giant, even so
erreth he who would subject God to the law, as he himself as man is
subject to the law. When, therefore, ye shall believe that only to be
sin which God willeth not, ye will find the truth, even as I have told
you. Wherefore, because God is not composite nor changeable, so also is
he unable to will and not will a single thing; for so would he have
contradiction in himself, and consequently pain, and would not be
infinitely blessed.'

Philip answered: 'But how is that saying of the prophet Amos to be
understood, that "there is not evil in the city that God hath not
done"?'

Jesus answered: 'Now here see, Philip, how great is the danger of
resting in the letter, as do the Pharisees, who have invented for
themselves the "predestination of God in the elect," in such wise that
they come to say in fact that God is unrighteous, a deceiver and a liar
and a hater of judgment (which shall fall upon them).

'Wherefore I say that here Amos the prophet of God speaketh of the evil
which the world calleth evil: for if he had used the language of the
righteous he would not have been understood by the world. For all
tribulations are well, either for that they purge the evil that we have
done, or are well because they restrain us from doing evil, or are well
because they make man to know the condition of this life, in order that
we may love and long for life eternal. Accordingly, had the prophet Amos
said: "There is no good in the city but what God hath wrought it," he
had given occasion for despair to the afflicted, as they beheld
themselves in tribulation and sinners living in prosperity. And, what is
worse, many, believing Satan to have such sovereignty over man, would
have feared Satan and done him service, so as not to suffer tribulation.
Amos therefore did as doth the Roman interpreter, who considereth not
his words as one speaking in the presence of the high-priest, but
considereth the will and the business of the Jew that knoweth not to
speak the Hebrew tongue.
