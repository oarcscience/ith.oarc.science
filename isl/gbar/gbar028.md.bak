### 28.

'When every one had departed from the temple, the priests closed the
temple and went away. Then Abraham took the axe and cut off the feet of
all the idols, except the great god Baal. At its feet he placed the axe,
amid the ruins which the statues made, for they, through being old and
composed of pieces, fell in pieces. Thereupon, Abraham, going forth from
the temple, was seen by certain men, who suspected him of having gone to
thieve something from the temple. So they laid hold on him, and having
arrived at the temple, when they saw their gods so broken in pieces,
they cried out with lamentation: "Come quickly, O men, and let us slay
him who hath slain our gods!" There ran together there about ten
thousand men, with the priests, and questioned Abraham of the reason why
he had destroyed their gods.

'Abraham answered: "Ye are foolish! Shall then a man slay God? It is the
great God that hath slain them. See you not that axe which he hath near
his feet? Certain it is that he desireth no fellows."

'Then arrived there the father of Abraham, who, mindful of the many
discourses of Abraham against their gods, and recognizing the axe
wherewith Abraham had broken in pieces the idols, cried out: "It hath
been this traitor of a son of mine, who hath slain our gods! for this
axe is mine." And he recounted to them all that had passed between him
and his son.

'Accordingly the man collected a great quantity of wood, and having
bound Abraham's hands and feet put him upon the wood, and put fire
underneath.

'Lo! God, through his angel, commanded the fire that it should not burn
Abraham his servant. The fire blazed up with great fury, and burned
about two thousand men of those who had condemned Abraham to death.
Abraham verily found himself free, being carried by the angel of God
near to the house of his father, without seeing who carried him and thus
Abraham escaped death.'
