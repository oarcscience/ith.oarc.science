### 83.

Whilst the woman was talking with Jesus came his disciples, and
marvelled that Jesus was speaking so with a woman. Yet no one said unto
him: 'Why speakest thou thus with a Samaritan woman?'

Whereupon, when the woman was departed, they said: 'Master, come and
eat.'

Jesus answered: 'I must eat other food.'

Then said the disciples one to another: 'Perchance some wayfarer hath
spoken with Jesus and hath gone to find him food.' And they questioned
him who writeth this, saying: 'Hath there been anyone here, O Barnabas,
who might have brought food to the master?'

Then answered he who writeth: 'There hath not been here any other than
the woman whom ye saw, who brought this empty vessel to fill it with
water.' Then the disciples stood amazed, awaiting the issue of the words
of Jesus. Whereupon Jesus said: 'Ye know not that the true food is to do
the will of God; because it is not bread that sustaineth man and giveth
him life, but rather the word of God, by his will. And so for this
reason the holy angels eat not, but live nourished only by the will of
God. And thus we, Moses and Elijah and yet another, have been forty days
and forty nights without any food.'

And lifting up his eyes, Jesus said: 'How far off is the harvest?'

The disciples answered: 'Three months.'

Jesus said: 'Look now, how the mountain is white with corn; verily I say
unto you, that to-day there is a great harvest to be reaped. And then he
pointed to the multitude who had come to see him. For the woman having
entered into the city had moved all the city, saying: 'O men, come and
see a new prophet sent of God to the house of Israel'; and she recounted
to them all that she had heard from Jesus. When they were come thither
they besought Jesus to abide with them; and he entered into the city and
abode there two days, healing all the sick, and teaching concerning the
kingdom of God.

Then said the citizens to the woman: 'We believe more in his words and
miracles than we do in what thou saidst; for he is indeed a holy one of
God, a prophet sent for the salvation of those that shall believe on
him.'

After the prayer of midnight the disciples came near unto Jesus, and he
said to them: 'This night shall be in the time of the Messiah, messenger
of God, the jubilee every year—that now cometh every hundred years.
Therefore I will not that we sleep, but let us make prayer, bowing our
head a hundred times, doing reverence to our God, mighty and merciful,
who is blessed for evermore, and therefore each time let us say: "I
confess thee our God alone, that hast not had beginning, nor shalt ever
have end; for by thy mercy gavest thou to all things their beginning,
and by thy justice thou shalt give to all an end: that hast no likeness
among men, because in thine infinite goodness thou art not subject to
motion nor to any accident. Have mercy on us, for thou hast created us,
and we are the works of thy hand."'
