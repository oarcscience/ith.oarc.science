### 199.

'God is so rich in mercy that, albeit the water of a thousand seas, if
so many were to be found, could not quench a spark of the flames of
hell, yet a single tear of one who mourneth at having offended God
quencheth the whole of hell, by the great mercy wherewith God succoureth
him. God, therefore, to confound Satan and to display his own bounty,
willeth to call merit in the presence of his mercy every good work of
his faithful servant, and willeth him so to speak of his neighbor. But
of himself a man must beware of saying: "I have merit"; for he would be
condemned.'
