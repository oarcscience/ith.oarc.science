### 12. First sermon of Jesus delivered to the people: wonderful in doctrine concerning the name of God.

The whole city of Jerusalem was moved by these words, wherefore they all
ran together to the temple to see Jesus, who had entered therein to
pray, so that they could scarce be contained there. Therefore the
priests besought Jesus, saying: 'This people desireth to see thee and
hear thee; therefore ascend to the pinnacle, and if God give thee a word
speak it in the name of the Lord.'

Then ascended Jesus to the place whence the scribes were wont to speak.
And having beckoned with the hand for silence, he opened his mouth,
saying: 'Blessed be the holy name of God, who of his goodness and mercy
willed to create his creatures that they might glorify him. Blessed be
the holy name of God, who created the splendour of all the saints and
prophets before all things to send him for the salvation of the world,
as he spake by his servant David, saying: "Before Lucifer in the
brightness of the saints I created thee." Blessed be the holy name of
God, who created the angels that they might serve him. And blessed be
God, who punished and reprobated Satan and his followers, who would not
reverence him whom God willeth to be reverenced. Blessed be the holy
name of God, who created man out of the clay of the earth, and set him
over his works. Blessed be the holy name of God, who drove man out of
paradise for having transgressed his holy precept. Blessed be the holy
name of God, who with mercy looked upon the tears of Adam and Eve, first
parents of the human race. Blessed be the holy name of God, who justly
punished Cain the fratricide, sent the deluge upon the earth, burned up
three wicked cities, scourged Egypt, overwhelmed Pharaoh in the Red Sea,
scattered the enemies of his people, chastised the unbelievers, and
punished the impenitent. Blessed be the holy name of God, who with mercy
looked upon his creatures, and therefore sent them his holy prophets,
that they might walk in truth and righteousness before him: who
delivered his servants from every evil, and gave them this land, as he
promised to our father Abraham and to his son for ever. Then by his
servant Moses he gave us his holy law, that Satan should not deceive us;
and he exalted us above all other peoples.

'But, brethren, what do we, to-day, that we be not punished for our
sins?'

And then Jesus with greatest vehemence rebuked the people for that they
had forgotten the word of God, and gave themselves only to vanity; he
rebuked the priests for their negligence in God's service and for their
worldly greed; he rebuked the scribes because they preached vain
doctrine, and forsook the law of God; he rebuked the doctors because
they made the law of God of none effect through their traditions. And in
such wise did Jesus speak to the people, that all wept, from the least
to the greatest, crying mercy, and beseeching Jesus that he would pray
for them; save only their priests and leaders, who on that day conceived
hatred against Jesus for having thus spoken against the priests,
scribes, and doctors. And they meditated upon his death, but for fear of
the people, who had received him as a prophet of God, they spake no
word.

Jesus raised his hands to the Lord God and prayed, and the people
weeping said: 'So be it, O Lord, so be it.' The prayer being ended Jesus
descended from the temple; and that day he departed from Jerusalem, with
many that followed him.

And the priests spoke evil of Jesus among themselves.
