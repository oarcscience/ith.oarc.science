### 122.

'As for avarice, that must be changed into almsgiving. Verily I say unto
you, that even as the plummet hath for its end the centre, so the
avaricious hath hell for his end, for it is impossible for the
avaricious to possess any good in paradise. Know ye wherefore? for I
will tell you. As God liveth, in whose presence my soul standeth, the
avaricious, even though he be silent with his tongue, by his works
saith: "There is no other God than I." Inasmuch as all that he hath he
is fain to spend at his own pleasure, not regarding his beginning or his
end, that he is born naked, and dying leaveth all.

'Now tell me: if Herod should give you a garden to keep, and ye were
fain to bear yourselves as owners, not sending any fruit to Herod, and
when Herod sent for fruit ye drove away his messengers, tell me, would
ye be making yourselves kings over that garden? Assuredly yea. Now I
tell you that even so the avaricious man maketh himself god over his
riches which God hath given him.

'Avarice is a thirst of the sense, which having lost God through sin
because it liveth by pleasure, and being unable to delight itself in
God, who is hidden from it, surroundeth itself with temporal things
which it holdeth as its good; and it groweth the stronger the more it
seeth itself deprived of God.

'And so the conversion of the sinner is from God, who giveth the grace
to repent. As said our father David: "This change cometh from the right
hand of God."

'It is necessary that I should tell you of what sort man is, if ye would
know how penitence ought to be done. And so to-day let us render thanks
to God, who hath given us the grace to communicate His will by my word.'

Whereupon he lifted up his hands and prayed, saying: 'Lord God almighty
and merciful, who in mercy hath created us, giving us the rank of men,
thy servants, with the faith of thy true messenger, we thank thee for
all thy benefits and would fain adore thee only all the days of our
life, bewailing our sins, praying and giving alms, fasting and studying
thy word, instructing those that are ignorant of thy will, suffering
from the world for love of thee, and giving up our life unto the death
to serve thee. Do thou, O Lord, save us from Satan, from the flesh and
from the world, even as thou savedst thine elect for love of thine own
self and for love of thy messenger for whom thou didst create us, and
for love of all thy holy ones and prophets.'

The disciples ever answered: 'So be it,' 'So be it, Lord,' 'So be it, O
our merciful God.'
