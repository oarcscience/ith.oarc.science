### 203.

'"O city, hard-hearted and perverse of mind, I have sent to thee my
servant, to the end that he may convert thee to thine heart, and thou
mayest repent; but thou, O city of confusion, hast forgotten all that I
did upon Egypt and upon Pharaoh for love of thee, O Israel. Many times
weepest thou that my servant may heal thy body of sickness; and thou
seekest to slay my servant because he seeketh to heal thy soul of sin.

'"Shalt thou, then, alone remain unpunished by me? Shalt thou, then,
live eternally? And shall thy pride deliver thee from my hands?
Assuredly not. For I will bring princes with an army against thee, and
they shall surround thee with might, and in such wise will I give thee
over into their hands that thy pride shall fall down into hell.

'"I will not pardon the old men or the widows, I will not pardon the
children, but I will give you all to famine, the sword, and derision,
and the temple whereon I have looked with mercy, I will make desolate
with the city, insomuch that ye shall be for a fable, a derision, and a
proverb among the nations. So is my wrath abiding upon thee, and mine
indignation sleepeth not."'
