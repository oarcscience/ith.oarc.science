### 103.

'The weeping of the sinner ought to be as that of a father who weepeth
over his son nigh to death. Oh madness of man, that weepest over the
body from which the soul is departed, and weepest not over the soul from
which, through sin, is departed the mercy of God!

'Tell me, if the mariner, when his ship hath been wrecked by a storm,
could by weeping recover all that he had lost, what would he do? It is
certain that he would weep bitterly. But I say unto you verily, that in
every thing wherein a man weepeth he sinneth, save only when he weepeth
for his sin. For every misery that cometh to man cometh to him from God
for his salvation, so that he ought to rejoice thereat. But sin cometh
from the devil for the damnation of man, and at that man is not sad.
Assuredly here ye can perceive that man seeketh loss and not profit.'

Said Bartholomew: 'Lord, what shall he do who cannot weep for that his
heart is a stranger to weeping?' Jesus answered: 'Not all those who shed
tears weep, O Bartholomew. As God liveth, there are found men from whose
eyes no tear hath ever fallen, and they have wept more than a thousand
of those who shed tears. The weeping of a sinner is a consumption of
earthly affection by vehemence of sorrow. Insomuch that just as the
sunshine preserveth from putrefaction what is placed uppermost, even so
this consumption preserveth the soul from sin. If God should grant tears
to the true penitent as many as the sea hath waters he would desire far
more and so this desire consumeth that little drop that he fain would
shed, as a blazing furnace consumeth a drop of water. But they who
readily burst into weeping are like the horse that goeth the faster the
more lightly he is laden.'
