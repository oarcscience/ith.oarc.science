### True Gospel of Jesus, called Christ, a new Prophet sent by God to the world: according to the description of Barnabas his apostle.

Barnabas, apostle of Jesus the Nazarene, called Christ, to all them that
dwell upon the earth desireth peace and consolation.

Dearly beloved, the great and wonderful God hath during these past days
visited us by his prophet Jesus Christ in great mercy of teaching and
miracles, by reason whereof many, being deceived of Satan, under
pretence of piety, are preaching most impious doctrine, calling Jesus
son of God, repudiating the circumcision ordained of God for ever, and
permitting every unclean meat: among whom also Paul hath been deceived,
whereof I speak not without grief; for which cause I am writing that
truth which I have seen and heard, in the intercourse that I have had
with Jesus, in order that ye may be saved, and not be deceived of Satan
and perish in the judgement of God. Therefore beware of every one that
preacheth unto you new doctrine contrary to that which I write, that ye
may be saved eternally.

The great God be with you and guard you from Satan and from every evil.
Amen.
