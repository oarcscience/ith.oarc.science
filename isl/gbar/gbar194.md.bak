### 194.

The scribes and Pharisees took counsel with the high priest to slay
Lazarus; for many renounced their traditions and believed in the word of
Jesus, because the miracle of Lazarus was a great one, seeing that
Lazarus had conversation with men, and ate and drank. But because he was
powerful, having a following in Jerusalem, and possessing with his
sister Magdala and Bethany, they knew not what to do.

Jesus entered into Bethany, into the house of Lazarus, and Martha, with
Mary, ministered unto him.

Mary, sitting one day at the feet of Jesus, was listening to his words,
whereupon Martha said to Jesus: 'Lord, seest thou not that my sister
taketh no care for thee, and provideth not that which thou must eat and
thy disciples?'

Jesus answered: 'Martha, Martha, do thou take thought for that which
thou shouldst do; for Mary hath chosen apart which shall not be taken
away from her for ever.

Jesus, sitting at a table with a great multitude that believed in him,
spake, saying: 'Brethren, I have but little time to remain with you, for
the time is at hand that I must depart from the world. Wherefore I bring
to your mind the words of God spoken to Ezekiel the prophet, saying: "As
I, your God, live eternally, the soul that sinneth, it shall die, but if
the sinner shall repent he shall not die but live."

'Wherefore the present death is not death, but rather the end of a long
death: even as the body when separated from the sense in a swoon, though
it have the soul within it, hath no other advantage over the dead and
buried save this, that the buried \[body\] awaiteth God to raise it
again, but the unconscious waiteth for the sense to return.

'Behold, then, the present life that it is death, through having no
perception of God.
