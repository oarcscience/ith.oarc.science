### 215.

When the soldiers with Judas drew near to the place where Jesus was,
Jesus heard the approach of many people, wherefore in fear he withdrew
into the house. And the eleven were sleeping.

Then God, seeing the danger of his servant, commanded Gabriel, Michael,
Rafael, and Uriel, his ministers, to take Jesus out of the world.

The holy angels came and took Jesus out by the window that looketh
toward the South. They bare him and placed him in the third heaven in
the company of angels blessing God for evermore.
