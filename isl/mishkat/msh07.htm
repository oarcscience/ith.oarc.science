<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">III. A GHAZZALIAN PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION</H3>
<P>On the whole it is the final section on the Veils-Tradition which, though really of the nature of an appendix, contains the most numerous and the most interesting problems for the study of Ghazz&acirc;l&icirc;'s inner life, thought, and convictions. This tradition speaks of "Seventy Thousand Veils of Light and Darkness" which veil pure Godhead from the human soul. The origin of the tradition is, it is safe to hazard, Neoplatonic, and it therefore lent itself completely to the gnostic and theosophical mode of</P>
<P>{p. 7}</P>
<P>thought which so soon invaded Muslim <U>S</U>&ucirc;fism after its less successful effort to capture orthodox Christianity. Accordingly Muslim mystics seem to have seized upon the tradition with avidity, though they interpret it variously. For an entirely Neoplatonic, theosophical interpretation, as expounded by Rif&acirc;`i dervishes, the translator's "'Way' of a Mohammedan Mystic" may be consulted.[1] According to this version, the soul, in its upward Seven-fold Way to Union with pure Deity, is at every stage stripped of 10,000 of these Veils, the dark ones first and then the bright. After that the naked soul stands face to face with naked Deity, with Absolute Being, with an unveiled Sun, with unadulterated Light. Ghazz&acirc;l&icirc;'s treatment is different. According to him, these Veils are various according to the varieties of the natures which they veil from the One Real. And it is the classification of these natures, which is thus involved, that supplies rich material for an unusually inside view of Ghazz&acirc;l&icirc;'s real views concerning men, doctrines, religions, and sects. It</P>

<P>is not the orthodox schoolman, the fierce dogmatist, the rigid <I>mutakallim</I>, who is now speaking. We have the sensation of overhearing Ghazz&acirc;l&icirc; as he speaks aloud to his own soul, or to a circle of initiates. It is hardly less than an outline of a philosophy of religion with which we have to do. He divides mankind into four classes: those veiled with veils of pure darkness; those veiled with veils of mixed darkness and light; those veiled with veils of pure light; and those who attain to the vision of the Unveiled. Every line of this part of the work merits and requires the closest study. It is not possible to give this detailed study here--it has been given elsewhere, and to that the reader must be referred.[1] But a summary of Ghazz&acirc;l&icirc;'s classification of souls and creeds may be given here, for thus, even more effectively than by an extended study, may a vivid preliminary appreciation be gained of the importance of this section for students of the Ghazz&acirc;l&icirc; problem. He begins at the bottom and works up the light-ladder, rung by rung, to the very top, thus giving a gradation of</P>

<P>human natures and human creeds in respect of their approach to absolute truth. Sometimes the grades are definitely identified by the author. In other cases they may be certainly, or nearly certainly, identified from the description he gives. In the following summary Ghazz&acirc;l&icirc;'s <I>own</I> identifications are given between round brackets; <I>inferred</I> identifications certain or nearly certain, between square brackets.</P>
