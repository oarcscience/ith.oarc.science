# INTRODUCTION

The references in square brackets are to the pages of the Cairo Arabic
edition, and to the present English translation.

THE MISHKÂT AL-ANWAR\[1\] is a work of extreme interest from the
viewpoint of al-Ghazzâlî's\[2\] inner life and esoteric thought. The
glimpses it gives of that life and thought are remarkably, perhaps
uniquely, intimate. It begins where his autobiographical *Al-Munqidh min
al-<u>D</u>alâl* leaves off. Its esotericism excited the curiosity and
even the suspicion of Muslim thinkers from the first, and we have deeply
interesting allusions to it in Ibn <u>T</u>ufaill and Ibn Rushd,\[4\]
the celebrated philosophers of Western Islam, who flourished within the
century after al-Ghazzâlî's death in 1111 (A.H. 505)--a fact which,
again, increases its importance and interest for us.

\[1. The *Mishkât al-Anwâr* is numbered No. 34 in Brockelmann's
*Geschichte der Arabischen Literatur* (vol. i, p. 423). It was printed
in Cairo (ma<u>t</u>ba\`at a<u>s</u> <u>S</u>idq, A. H. 1322), to which
edition the references in the present work are made. There is another
edition in a collection of five opuscules of Ghazzâlî under the title of
the first of the five, *Fai<u>s</u>al al-Tafriqa*.

2\. The Algazal of the Schoolmen.

3\. The Abubacer of the Schoolmen.

4\. The Averroes of the Schoolmen.\]
