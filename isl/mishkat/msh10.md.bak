### VI. ONE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF THE VICEGERENT

In the absence of "the book" into which Ghazzâlî put these secret
opinions, or inconceivable mysteries, including, we may suppose, the
secret of this mysterious Vicegerent, we are not likely to reach any
authoritative settlement of the question: nor, even if we be put on the
right track, clear up the whole of the mystery. For want of direct help
from our author, therefore, the only thing to be done is to examine
minutely *al-Mishkât* itself, to see if it yields any indirect help. It
would seem that from this examination two possible solutions emerge. In
this section the first of these will be discussed.

This solution, which was first suggested to the writer by the
distinguished French Orientalist, M. Louis Massignon, identifies the
mysterious figure of this Vicegerent, *al-Mu<u>t</u>â\`*, with the
*Qu<u>t</u>b* ("Axis") or some other Supreme Adept. According to the
developed doctrine, this *Qu<u>t</u>b* was an earthly Mystic of
supremest attainment, who during his lifetime administered

{p. 25}

the affairs of the heavens and the earth. There was nothing about him,
during his lifetime, to suggest to any observer that he was, engaged in
so stupendous a task, and it was not known till after his death that he
had been "the Axis of his time" (*qu<u>t</u>bu zamânihi*).

The beginnings of this doctrine go back far beyond al-Ghazzâlî--a
rudimentary form of it was held by even the ultra-orthodox
<u>H</u>anbalites,\[1\] and a developed form of the conception is
expressed quite definitely in al-<u>H</u>ujwîrî's *Kashf
al-Ma<u>h</u>jûb*,\[2\] and must have been widely held, in orthodox
circles too, in the fifth century, at the close of which our treatise
was written.

Moreover, at least from the time of al-Hallâj, to whom, as we shall see,
our author in. this treatise refers in terms by no means of repudiation,
the very word under discussion, *al-Mu<u>t</u>â\`* or some other form of
the same verb, occurs in significant connexion with supreme sainthood.
One of the accusations levelled against al-Hallâj was that he taught
that "having

\[1. Massignon, *Passion d' al-<u>H</u>allâj*, p. 754.

2\. p. 214 of trans.\]

{p. 26}

attained to sainthood the Adept becomes *al-Mutâ\`* he who says to a
thing 'Be!' and it becomes".\[1\] It sounds startling enough, but it was
a true accusation, though it has to be taken in connexion with the whole
of <u>H</u>allâj's philosophy of mystical union with the Divine. For he
did definitely adopt from a predecessor, Ibn \`Iyâ<u>d</u>, the aphorism
"*Man a<u>t</u>â\`a Allaha a<u>t</u>â\`a<u>h</u>u kullu shay'*",\[3\] an
aphorism which received a later redaction (quite in the spirit of
<u>H</u>allâj, as has been shown), "*man hudhdhiba ... fa ya<u>s</u>îru
mu<u>t</u>â\`an, yaqûlu lish shay'i \`Kun' fa yakûn*," "He who has
passed through the mystic askesis becomes Obeyed; he says to this or
that, 'Be!' and it is."\[4\]

Since then al-<u>H</u>allâj did so teach, and did use this very word,
and since al-Ghazzâlî in this treatise betrays a very considerable
admiration of al-<u>H</u>allâj, and a sort of tremulous half-assent to
his wildest utterances, including the notorious

\[1. Massignon, op. cit., p. 791; ib., p. 472.

2\. The sense in which he *did* use the expression, and the proof that
it did not in his thought mean self-deification, is given very clearly
in Massignon, op. cit., 519-521.

3\. Op. cit., p. 472.

4\. *Al-Avnî on al-Istakhrî*., quoted in a letter by M. Massignon to the
writer.\]

{p. 27}

"*Ana-l <u>H</u>aqq*" itself, it would seem that a strong prima-facie
case has been made out for identifying the *Mu<u>t</u>â\`* of our
treatise, in spite of the cosmic nature of his functions, with some
supreme Adept. But only a prima-facie case. To make out the thesis
itself, the treatise itself must be interrogated; for it by no means
follows that because a <u>H</u>allâj held an opinion a Ghazzâlî adopted
it.

There are, certainly, some passages that do suggest that the solution is
along this line.

\(1\) The description of the adventures of a soul in highest state of
Union (*Mish*., p. \[24\]) tends to bear out the Identification, or the
general idea underlying it. The person there described is a supreme
Adept, and in particular al-Hallâj himself. Having reached Union with
the One divine Real, he ascends in and with Him "to the throne of the
Divine Unity and from thenceforth administers the Command throughout His
(or 'his,' for in this extraordinary passage the pronouns remain the
same throughout) storied Heavens." The words translated "administers the
Command", *yudabbîru-l amr*, are remarkable, for they contain an Arabic

{p. 28}

word (*amr*) which, as we shall see presently, is to the last degree
significant, being the very word used in the *Mu<u>t</u>â\`* passage (p.
\[55\]), where Ghazzâlî confesses it is an obscure mystery. The
*Mu<u>t</u>â\`* (Commander) is said to move the outermost Heaven by
precisely the *amr* (command). The words *yudabbîru-l amr* could no
doubt be translated in a less significant way, owing to the troublesome
double meaning of *amr*, ("affair," "command"), namely, "he disposes
things." But in view of the fact that this *amr* was a notable
<u>S</u>ûfî term, and a mysterious problem alluded to by Ghazzâlî in
this very treatise, it seems inevitable to take it as "command" here.
And a "Command" necessitates an "Obeyed".

\(2\) On p. \[23\], where the reference throughout is purely general,
and presumably applies to *anyone* who has the necessary qualifications
and attains this supreme mystical "state", Ghazzâlî says that when the
mystic Ascent is complete, "if there be indeed any change, it is by way
of 'the Descent into the Lowest Heaven', the radiation from above
downwards." This also suggests supreme divine activity in the Universe

{p. 29}

below, especially if the word *ishrâq* refers, as it probably does, to
causative activity.

\(3\) On pp. \[ 13, 14\] occurs another passage which strongly supports
the general identification, though it leaves its particular and personal
reference still obscure. In this the adepts, who in their mystical
Ascent (*mi\`râj*) "attained to that supreme attainment", are said to be
"*the Prophets*", who "from thence looked down upon the entire World
Invisible \[precisely the world of the Heavens\]; for he who is in the
world of the Realm Supernal is which Allah, *and hath the keys of the
Unseen*. I mean that *from where he is descend the causes of existing
things*; for the world of sense *is one of the effects of yonder-world
of causes*", etc. This looks almost like a reasoned, philosophic
doctrine behind the mystical one, that to attain to the world of Reality
is *ipso facto* to attain to the fount of causation; which involves the
ability to direct the Causes which control all the Effects in the
Heavens below and the Earth beneath. The Vicegerent does no more than
this.

A close scrutiny of these passages leaves, one, nevertheless, with thc
impression that the

{p. 30}

Adepts whose celestial adventures are there described are too
generalized, or perhaps one should say too pluralized, to be
identifiable with this single, solitary figure of *al-Mu<u>t</u>â\`* as
he is presented in our passage. As far as these three passages go, this
assumption of the reins of the Universe is only granted to Adepts in
their mystic "States", to Prophets in their highly exceptional "Ascent".
There is nothing to show that two or more such Attainers might not exist
at one time, or that even one must always be existing; in other words,
there is no trace of the *complete* and fully developed *Qu<u>t</u>b*
doctrine in this treatise. But these considerations make it impossible
to identify any one of these Adepts, or all of them together, with the
cosmic *al-Mu<u>t</u>â\`*, whose function, related as it is to the very
mechanism of the Heavens, is ceaseless, and coextensive with Time
itself. And these last four words suggest a further consideration which
in itself seems fatal to the proposed identification; namely, that
*al-Mu<u>t</u>â\`* was Vicegerent *from the very foundation of the
world*; he is the one "who commanded the Heavens to be moved" (p. \[55,
1. 12\]). No

{p. 31}

Hallâj, no Adept, no *Qu<u>t</u>b*, no Prophet even, ever claimed, or
had claimed for him, such priority as this,\[1\] or even priority at
all. But if not, none of them--and, if so, no terrestrial being at
all--can claim to fill the role of this Vicegerent. The three passages
were probably intended only to assert and account for the *karâmât* of
the Saints in their wonder-working which was parallel to that of the
Koranic Jesus.

The a-priori question of our author's attitude to the *Qu<u>t</u>b*
doctrine--whether, consistently with his published writings, he *could*
have sustained such a doctrine in this work--is one which can only be
indicated here. Professors R. Nicholson and D.S. Macdonald have both
communicated to the writer, in reference to the passage under
discussion, their opinion that there is an a-priori impossibility. To
al-Ghazzâlî the doctrine was tainted with Imâmism, his special *bete
noire* (see his attack on the Ta\`lîmites in his *Munqidh*;\[2\] that
since an omnipotent.

\[1. The question of the priority claimed by a certain school for
Mohammed, and of the *nûr Mu<u>h</u>ammadi*, will be considered, later.

2\. See Nicholson, The Idea of Personality in <u>S</u>ûfism, p. 46\]

{p. 32}

Administrator must also be an infallible Guide (whom Ghazzâlî would not
have at any price), there is no room for the former in Ghazzâlî's
thought (thus Professor Macdonald). If the *Mu<u>t</u>â\`* is not
Mohammed, he is certainly no Saint (thus Professor Nicholson).

Be this as it may, the above considerations, drawn from the study of the
text itself, and from the passages which prima facie seemed to point to
the *Qu<u>t</u>b-Mu<u>t</u>â\`* identification, seem finally, when more
closely examined, to rule that identification out.
