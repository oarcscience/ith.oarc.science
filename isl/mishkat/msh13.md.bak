### IX. ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND THEOMORPHISM IN AL-MISHKAT

The doctrine of *mukhâlafa*--that the divine essence and characteristics
wholly and entirely "differ from" the human-appears to be

\[1. Tah., p. 60. Quoted in the writer's article in *Der Islâm*, see pp.
134-6, 151, 152, where parts of the subject are gone into in greater
detail.\]

{p. 51}

assorted, as this treatise's *last* word, in its most extreme and
intransigent form. For the conclusion of the whole matter, the end of
the quest for truth for those who "Arrive", is "an Existent who
transcends ALL that is comprehensible by human Insight . . .
transcendent of and separate from every characterization that in the
foregoing we have made."\[1\]

Nevertheless, the *Mishkât* itself seems to be one long attempt to
modify or even negate this its own bankrupt conclusion. Indeed, it goes
unusual lengths in asserting a certain ineffable *likeness* between
Allâh and man. It is true that the usual anthropomorphic
expressions--the Hand, the Sessions on the Throne, the Descent to the
Lowest Sphere, etc., those

\[1. In Ghazzâlî the most extreme Agnosticism and the most extreme
Gnosticism meet, and meet at this point; for, as he says (p \[25\]),
things that go beyond one extreme pass over to the extreme opposite."
For him "Creed because Incredible" becomes "Gnosis because Agnoston".
What saved the *Universe* for him from his nihilistic theologizing was
his ontology (see below, pp. 108 seqq.). What saved *God* for him from
his obliterating agnosticism was the experience of the mystic leap, his
own personal *mi\`râj*. This may have been non-rational, but it was to
him experience. Even those who regard the sensational experience of
<u>S</u>ûfism as having been pure self-hypnotism cannot condemn them and
the sense of reality they brought, in relation to the man who had
thought his way out of both atheism and pantheism, and yet would nave
been left at the end of the quest, by his thinking alone, with an
Unknown and Unknowable Absolute.\]

{p. 52}

perennial sources for Mohammedan theologizing-are used and are
discounted in the usual way. But they are, in reality, only discounted
by being replaced by a <u>S</u>ûfî system of theomorphism. This has
three main aspects--

\(1\) a quasi-Platonic doctrine of terrestrial type and celestial
antitype;

\(2\) the relation of the divine and human

rû<u>h</u> (spirit);

\(3\) the relation of the divine and human *<u>s</u>ûra* ("image,"
"form").

\(1\) The whole of the first two parts of the treatise are practically
an exposition of an Islamico-Platonic typology. It is not explicitly
said that earthly things are more or less faint copies of "the patterns
of things in the heavens," though this is probably implicit in what is
said, namely, that the heavenly realities (*haqâ'iq*), (*ma\`ânî*), all
have their symbols on earth. These symbols or types, as their Arabic
term itself suggests (*amthâl*), do possess a "resemblance" to their
celestial antitypes, for, as al Ghazzâlî remarks, "the thing compared
(*al-mushabbah*, the antitype) is in some sort parallel, and bears
resemblance, to the thing compared therewith (*al-mushabbah bihi*, the
type

{p. 53}

or symbol), whether that resemblance be remote or near; a matter again
which is unfathomably deep."\[1\] Ghazzâlî. can hardly be allowed to
elude the application of this true principle to Allâh Himself,
considering that this very Koran-verse which it is the object of the
entire treatise to expound begins with a simile. "Light" is the chosen,
or rather the God-given symbol, wherewith Allah is "compared", and which
therefore He must "in some sort resemble". This analogy of light floods
the whole book. Now Allah is the Sun: now the Light of lights: and at
the end, in the same breath in which Abu <u>H</u>âmid, with the
incorrigible inconsistency which so angered Averroes, denied the
validity of the similitude, description, relation, or even predication
in regard to Allâh, we are told that He stands in relation to His
Vicegerent (or "wakeel" in a parallel passage) as the pure Light-essence
to the sun, or as the Elemental Fire to a glowing coal. Theomorphism has
"in some sort" been admitted.

\(2\) In the *I<u>h</u>yâ' al \`Ulûm* Ghazzâlî speaks of the human

rû<u>h</u> as *amr rabbâni* "a divine

\[1. M., p. \[14\].\]

{p. 54}

affair" (*amr* must surely bear here its other meaning); and he is there
very anxious, not to say agitated, over the esoteric character of the
doctrine; it must be kept a dead secret from the Many! it must not be
set forth in a book!\[1\] "The specific characteristic which
differentiates humanity \[from the lower creation\] is something which
it is not lawful to indite in a book."\[2\] The thing that agitates him
is the relation of this human

rû<u>h</u> to the Spirit of God, *rû<u>h</u> Allâh*, and its relation to
Allâh. The matter is esoteric--it is to be "grudged" to the
"commons"--because it is dangerous ground. It is dangerous ground
because one has to talk warily in order to avoid a violation of the
uniqueness of Allâh, which would involve confusing Creator with created,
and so passing gradually to *ishrâk*, which is the worst "infidelity."

This particular anxiety is not reflected in the present treatise; it is
strange that the mystery of

rû<u>h</u> does not figure in the list (see above, p. 5) over which the
author's *favete linquis*! is

\[1. See *Mizân*, p. 214, quoted above.

2\. *I<u>h</u>yâ*, iv, p. 294, quoted in a letter to the writer from
Professor R. Nicholson.\]

{p. 55}

inscribed.\[1\] He is mainly occupied with working out what the New
Testament calls the "operations", rather than the nature of the spirit.
In so doing the singular "spirit" becomes plural "spirits",

arwâ<u>h</u>, which, as already observed, happens also in the Book of
the Revelation. Ghazzâlî works out the theory of the several "spirits"
of the human psychology; then the graded "spirits" of the heavenly
hosts; and then the Neoplatonic or theosophic idea of the gradation of
all these (in *maqâmât*), and the way in which they are "lit"
(*muqtabasa*) from each other in order: we must not say "derived", for
that would involve him in the emanationism be was ever anathematizing
yet, for ever incurring the suspicion of.\[2\] In all this his tone is
open, easy, confident. The special mystery of The Spirit had been
already discounted in the Koran, so that was harmless. As for the
identification of *Rû<u>h</u> Mu<u>t</u>â\`*, if our theory is correct,
that was a grand secret. But that secret he never intended even to hint
at, and it would really seem as if we had surprised and betrayed a *sirr
maknûn*!

\[1. The human *'aql* does figure on that list, pp. \[6, 7\].

2\. See the writer's op. cit. in *Der Islâm*, pp. 138-141.\]

{p. 56}

\(3\) It was the *<u>s</u>ûra* tradition,\[1\] "ALLAH CREATED ADAM AFTER
HIS IMAGE," that above all else led Moslem thinkers into temptation--the
temptation of trenching on the uniqueness of Allâh. Its very riskiness
seems, however, to have fascinated them supremely from the very outset.
Not one of them could let it alone. In this very treatise Ghazzâlî
returns to it again and again. Perhaps it would accord with inner truth
to say rather that both he and others returned to that tradition not so
much as moths fascinated by a dangerous glare, but as those who are
feeling cold return for warmth and cheer to even an alien fire. The
aphorism, sacred as a Koran text, was the assertion and pledge that man
somehow is, or may become, "like God." The word *<u>s</u>ûra* became the
symbol and the guarantee of theomorphism.

In the first allusion in the *Mishkât* to this tradition (p. \[9\]), the
point of the similarity is the human intelligence (*\`aql*). In virtue
of his intelligence, Ghazzâlî hints, man is "after the image of Allâh."
The \`aql is "Allâh's balance-scale

\[1. Gen. i. 27, though Islâm ignores the parentage.\]

{p. 57}

upon earth."\[1\] In its own sphere it is infallible.\[2\] From the
*\`aql*, as from a firm "taking-off" place, souls make their mystic
Ascension to the heavenlies.\[3\] It is because it is thus the
specifically human faculty that it is a determinative element in the
human *<u>s</u>ûra*.\[4\]

The second allusion (M., p. \[23\]) carries us very much further--even
to that verge from which Moslem mystics so often looked dizzily down,
but from which they so seldom fell, into the pantheistic abyss. Behold a
human soul in completest Union (*jam\`*) with Deity, sitting on The
Throne, and administering all things in heaven and earth! "Well might
one," says our author, "in looking upon such an one," get a new view of
this tradition. Is not such a uniate, indeed, "after the image of
Allâh"? But, he continues\[5\], "after contemplating that word more
deeply one becomes aware that it has an interpretation like
\[al-<u>H</u>allâj's\] 'I am the One Real.'"\[5\] Unfortunately he has
omitted to

\[1. M., p. \[29\].

2\. Ib., p. \[10\].

3\. Ib., p. \[24\]

4\. Ib., \[40\].

5\. How {to} translate this "*Ana-l-<u>H</u>aqq*"? Not by Jesus, "I am
the Truth", tempting though this is. "I am the Absolute" would be a
parallel rendering in modern philosophic parlance. Professor Nicholson's
"I am God" is startling, but illuminating because perfectly justifiable:
for *al-<u>H</u>aqq* and Allâh are mutually and exclusively
convertible.\]

{p. 58}

indicate what precisely that interpretation is. We have a tantalizing
author to deal with.

What was that interpretation?

Probably we do not find it in the third passage (pp. \[34, 35\]), though
it is deeply influenced by <u>H</u>allâjian thought. There is in the
celestial world something which "developpe, modalise, et concerte entre
elles les creations divines ... une certaine structure interne
particuliere a l'acte createur".' This living order, this organised
"Presence" (*<u>h</u>a<u>d</u>ar*), is symbolized by the word *Image*,
or *Form*. And this macrocosmic *<u>h</u>a<u>d</u>ra* has its earthly
counterpart in an analogous human form, or *<u>s</u>ûra*, which has the
same "structure interne particuliere" (it is alluded to on p. \[22, l.
1\], and p. \[34, 1. 3\], and described in detail on pp. \[39-41\]).
Therefore, man, formed in this Form, is "after the Form, the Image, of
this Merciful One (*al Ra<u>h</u>mân*)". Ghazzâlî's explanation of his
preference for this variation of the tradition, to which, however, he by
no means always adheres, is difficult to follow.

\[1. Massignon, op. cit., p, 519, describing <u>H</u>allâj's doctrine of
the divine

rû<u>h</u>, and exactly hitting off Ghazzâlî's difficult thought on p.
\[24, ll. 2, 3\], (cf. p, \[22, l. 2\]). But from this point of view

rû<u>h</u> and *<u>s</u>ûra* merge into each other, as a careful
comparison of the two Mishkât passages just cited shows.\]

{p. 59} But the general idea clearly is that "but for this 'mercy'
\[i.e. of these two correlative and coincident Forms\] every son of Adam
would have been powerless to know his Lord, for 'only he who knows
himself knows his Lord". The wheel has, indeed, brought us round a
strange circle! Through the eternal grace of theomorphism we win back to
a higher anthropomorphism, so that the proper study of God is--man! And
this from the writer whose last word is that Allah must not have so much
as an attribute predicated of Him, or the divine uniqueness will be
violated! Truly, thus the whirligig of thought brings in his revenges.

We have already seen many indications that before he wrote this treatise
Ghazzâlî must have been deep in the study of al-<u>H</u>allâj; and the
passage we have just been considering may be added to these indications.
Yet there is no overt trace in it, or elsewhere in the *Mishkât*, of
al-<u>H</u>allâj's profoundest thought on this matter of the
Divine-Adamic; no trace of that strange Figure--that Epiphany of
humanized Deity, or Apotheosis of ideal-Humanity--which was presented by
Allah to the angels for worship

{p. 60}

or ever the first man was created, and in which He Himself, on behalf of
the human race, swore unto Himself the Covenant (*mîthâq*) of
allegiance. For this conception, which has the closest interrelations
with all the moments of the above discussion--

rû<u>h</u>, *amr*, *<u>s</u>ûra*, *nûr-Mu<u>h</u>ammadî*--the reader
must be referred to the grand work which has brought to light so many
hidden things, A Louis Massignon's *La Passion d' Al
<u>H</u>osayn-ibn-Man<u>s</u>our al-Hallaj*.\[l\] Ghazzâlî's silence on
this so remarkable development of the *<u>S</u>ûra* tradition would
suggest that it was precisely here that he felt it dangerous to follow
al-<u>H</u>allâj. What was possible for the seer might send the
theologian over the line where Islam ends and pantheism begins. On the
other hand, is it possible that here we have the explanation of our
author's embarrassed words on p. \[55\] "on account of a Mystery which
it is not in the competence of this book to reveal"? His inmost

\[1. Pages 485, 599-602. In a note Massignon hazards the tentative
suggestion that this epiphanized God (called by al-<u>H</u>allâj
*al-Nâsût*) in contra-distinction from the unknowable *al-Lâhût*) is
analogical to, or suggestive of Ghazzâlî's *Vicegerent* (p. 601, n. 5).
The suggestion is thrilling, as we see. It must be repeated that there
is no overt trace of the doctrine in M.\]

{p. 61}

thought may have been, "Perhaps al-Hallâj has penetrated here to
something of what the Koran itself \[in the Spirit-Verse\] left obscure.
I neither assert, nor deny. *Allâhu a\`lam*!"

Thus we come to the ultimate question--the ultimate question with every
<u>S</u>ûfî writer and book--does he and it escape pantheism? What light
comes from this "Niche for Lights" upon this obscure question?
