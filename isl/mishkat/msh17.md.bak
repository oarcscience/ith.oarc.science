### PART II.--THE SCIENCE OF SYMBOLISM,

PROLEGOMENA TO THE EXPLANATION OF THE SYMBOLISM OF THE NICHE, THE LAMP,
THE GLASS, THE TREE, THE OIL, AND THE FIRE

The exposition of this symbolism involves, first of all, two cardinal
considerations, which afford limitless scope for investigation, but to.
which I shall merely allude very briefly here.

First, the science and method of symbolism; the way in which the spirit
of the ideal form\[1\] is captured by the mould of the symbol; the
mutual relationship of the two; the inner nature of this correspondence
between the

\[1. Or Idea = in practically the Platonic sense.\]

{p. 122}

world of Sense (which supplies the clay of the moulds, the material of
the symbolism) and the world of the Realm Supernal from which the Ideas
descend.\[1\]

Second, the gradations of the several spirits of our mortal clay, and
the degree \[p. 28\] of light possessed by each. For we treat of this
latter symbolism in order to explain the former.

(*i*) THE OUTWARD AND THE INWARD IN SYMBOLISM: TYPE AND ANTITYPE

The world is Two Worlds, spiritual and material, or, if you will, a
World Sensual and a World Intelligential; or again, if you will, a World
Supernal and a World Inferior. All these expressions are near each
other, and the difference between them is merely one of viewpoint. If
you regard the two worlds in themselves, you use the first expression;
if in respect of the organ which apprehends them, the second; if in
respect of their mutual relationship, the third. You may, perhaps, also
term

\[1. (By Ghazzâlî.) In this Light-Verse, in Ibn Mas'ûd's reading, the
words "in the heart of the believer, "follow the words "of His light".
And Ubayy b. Ka\`b's instead of "the similitude of His light", has "the
similitude of the light of the heart of him who believes is like".
etc.\]

{p. 123}

them the World of Dominance and Sense-perception, and, the World of the
Unseen and the Realm Supernal. It were no marvel if the students of the
realities underlying the terminology were puzzled by the multiplicity of
these terms, and imagined a corresponding multiplicity of ideas. But he
to whom the realities beneath the terms are disclosed makes the ideas
primary and the terms secondary: while inferior minds take the opposite
course. To them the term is the source from which the reality proceeds.
We have an allusion to these two types of mind in the Koran, "*Whether
is the more rightly guided, he who walks with his face bent down, or he
who walks in a straight Way, erect*?"\[1\]

1\.

The two Worlds: their types and antitypes

Such is the idea of the Two Worlds. And the next thing for you to know
is, that the supernal world of "the Realm" is a world invisible to the
majority of men; and the world of our senses is the world of perception,
because it is perceived of all. This World Sensual

\[1. S. 67, 22.\]

{p. 124}

is the point from which we ascend to \[p. 29\] the world Intelligential:
and, but for this connexion between the two, and their reciprocal
relationship, the way upward to the higher sphere would be barred. And
were this upward was impossible, then would the Progress to the Presence
Dominical and the near approach to Allah be impossible too. For no man
shall approach near unto Allah, unless his foot stand at the very centre
of the Fold of the Divine Holiness. Now by this World of the "Divine
*Holiness*" we mean the world that *transcends* the apprehension of the
senses and the imagination. And it is in respect of the law of that
world--the law that the soul which is a stranger to it neither goeth out
therefrom, nor entereth therein--that we call it the Fold of the Divine
Holiness and Transcendence. And the human spirit, which is the channel
of the manifestations of the Transcendence, may be perhaps called "*the
Holy Valley*".\[1\]

Again, this Fold comprises lesser folds, some of which penetrate more
deeply than others into the ideas of the Divine Holiness.

\[1. S. 20, 12.\]

{p. 125}

But the term Fold embraces all the gradations of the lesser ones; for
you must not suppose that these terms are enigmas, unintelligible to men
of Insight. But I cannot pursue the subject further, for I see that my
preoccupation with citing and explaining all this terminology is turning
me from my theme. It is for you to apply yourself now to the study of
the terms.

To return to the subject we were discussing: the visible world is, as we
said, the point of departure up to We world of the Realm Supernal; and
the "Pilgrim's Progress of the Straight Way"\[1\] is an expression for
that upward course, which may also be expressed by "The Faith," "the
Mansions of Right Guidance." Were there no relation between the two
worlds, no inter-connexion at all, then all upward progress would be
inconceivable from one to the other. Therefore, the divine mercy gave to
the World Visible a correspondence with the World of the Realm Supernal,
and for this reason there is not a single thing in this world of sense
that is not a symbol of something in yonder one. It may well hap

\[1. See S. 1, 4.\]

{p. 126}

that some one thing in this world may symbolize several things in the
World of the Realm Supernal, and equally well that some one thing in the
latter may have several symbols \[p. 30\] in the World Visible. We call
a thing typical or symbolic when it resembles and corresponds to its
antitype under some aspect.

A complete enumeration of these symbols would involve our exhausting the
whole of the existing things in both of the Two Worlds! Such a task our
mortal powers can never fulfil; or human faculties have not sufficed to
comprehend it in the past; and with our little lives we cannot expound
it fully in the present. The utmost I can do is to explain to you a
single example. The greater may then be inferred from the less; for the
door of research into the mysteries of this knowledge will then lie open
to you.

2\.

An Example of Symbolism, from the Story of Abraham in the Koran

Listen now. If the World of the Realm Supernal contains
Light-substances, high and lofty, called "Angels", from which substances
the various lights are effused upon the various

{p. 127}

mortal spirits, and by reason of which these angels are called "lords,"
then is Allah "Lord of lords," and these lords will have differing,
grades of luminousness. The symbols, then, of these in the visible world
will be, preeminently, the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars.

And the Pilgrim of the Way rises first of all to a degree corresponding
to that of a star. The effulgence of that star's light appears to him.,
It is disclosed to him that the entire world beneath adores its
influence and the effulgence of its light. And so, because of the very
beauty and superbness of the thing, he is made aware of something which
cries aloud saying, "This is my Lord?"\[1\] He passes on; and as he be.
comes conscious of the light-degree next above. it, namely, that
symbolized by the moon, lo! in the aerial canopy he beholds that star
set, to wit, in comparison with its superior; and he saith, "*Nought
that setteth do I adore!*" And so he rises till he arrives at last at
the degree symbolized by the sun. This, again, he sees is greater and
higher than the former, but nevertheless admits of comparison therewith,
in,

\[1. See for this whole passage S. 6, 75-8.\]

{p. 128}

virtue of a relationship between the two. \[31\] But to bear
relationship to what is imperfect carries with it imperfection-the
"setting" of our allegory. And by reason thereof he saith: "*I have
turned my face unto That Who made the heavens and the earth! I am a true
believer, and, not of those who associate other gods with Allah!*" Now
what is meant to be conveyed by this "THAT WHO" is the vaguest kind of
indication, destitute of all relation or comparison. For, were anyone to
ask, "What is the symbol comparable with or corresponding to this That?'
no answer to the question could be conceived. Now He Who transcends all
relations is ALLAH, the ONE REALITY. Thus, when certain Arabs once asked
the Apostle of God, "To what may we relate Allah?' this reply was
revealed, "*Say, He, Allah is one! His days are neither ended nor begun;
neither is He a father nor a son; and none is like unto Him, no not
one*\[1\]; the meaning of which verse is simply that He transcends
relation. Again, when Pharaoh said to Moses: "*What, pray, is the Lord
of the Universe?*" as though demanding

\[1. S. 112.\]

{p. 129}

to know His essence, Moses, in his reply, merely indicated *His works*,
because these were clearer to the mind of his interrogator; and
answered, "*The Lord of the heavens and the earth*."\[1\] But Pharaoh
said to his courtiers, "*Ha! marked ye that*!" as though objecting to
Moses' evasion of his demand to be told Allah's essential nature. Then
Moses said, "*Your Lord, and your first fathers' Lord.*" Pharaoh then
set him down as insane. He had demanded an analogue, for the description
of the divine Essence, and Moses replied to him from His works. And so
Pharaoh said, "*Your prophet who has been sent you is insane.*"

3\.

Fundamental Examples of Symbolism especially from the Story of Moses in
the Koran

Let us now return to the pattern we selected for illustrating the
symbolic method. The science of the Interpretation of Visions determines
for us the value of each kind of symbol; for "Vision is a part of
Prophecy." It is clear, is it not, that the *sun*, when seen in a
vision,

\[1. For this passage see S. 26, 24-7, and for the whole
thought--compare pp. \[54, 55\]. 9\]

{p. 130}

must be interpreted by a Sovereign Monarch, because of their mutual
resemblance and their share in a common spiritual idea, to wit,
sovereignty over all, and the emanation or effusion of influence and
light on to all. The antitype of the *moon* will be that Sovereign's
Minister; for it is through the moon that the sun sheds his light on the
world in its own absence; and even so, it is through his own Minister
that the Sovereign \[p. 32\] makes his influence felt by subjects who
never beheld the royal person. Again, the dreamer who sees himself with
a ring on his finger with which he seals the mouths of men and the
secrets of women, is told that the sign means the early Call to Prayer
in the month of Ramadan.\[1\] Again, for one who sees himself pouring
olive oil into an olive-tree the interpretation is that the slave-girl
he has wedded is his mother, unrecognized by him. But it is impossible
to exhaust the different ways by which symbols of this description may
be interpreted, and I cannot set myself the task of enumerating them. I
can merely say that just as certain

\[1. Because after the *idhân*, just before morning, food and sexual
intercourse are fasted from till the next sunset.\]

{p. 131}

beings of the Spirit-World Supernal are symbolized by Sun, Moon and
Stars, others may be typified by different symbols. when the Point of
connexion is some characteristic other than light.

For example, if among those beings of that Spirit-World there be
something that is fixed and unchangeable; great and never diminishing;
from which the waters of knowledge, the excellencies of revelations,
issue into the heart, even as waters well out into a valley; It would be
symbolized by the *Mountain*.\[1\] Further, if the beings that are the
recipients of those excellencies are of diverse grades, they would be
symbolized by the *Valley*; and if those excellencies, on reaching the
hearts of men, pass from heart to heart, these hearts are also
symbolized by *Valleys*.\[2\] The head of the Valley will represent the
hearts of Prophet, Saint, and Doctor, followed by those who come after
them. So, then, if these valleys are lower than the first one, and are
watered from it, then that first one will certainly be the "*Right*"
Valley,\[3\] because

\[1. S. 28, 29. 46.

2\. S. 13, 18.

3\. S. 28, 30. See S. 19, 53, and 10, 82.\]

{p. 132}

of its signal rightness\[1\] and superiority. And finally will come the
lowest valley which receives its water from the last and lowest level of
that "Right" Valley, and is accordingly watered from "*the margin of the
Right Valley*",\[2\] not \[p. 33\] from its deepest part and centre.

But if the spirit of a prophet is typified by a lighted *Lamp*, lit by
means of Inspiration ("*We have inspired thee with* \[*a*\] *Spirit from
Our power*"),\[3\] then the symbol of the source of that kindling is
*Fire*. If some of those who derive knowledge from the prophets live by
a merely traditional acceptance of what they are told, and others by a
gift of insight, then the symbol for the former, who investigate
nothing, is a *Fire-brand* or a *Torch* or a *Meteor*; while the man of
spiritual experience, who has therefore something in some sort common
with the prophets, is accordingly symbolized by the *Warming of Fire*,
for a man is not warmed by hearing about fire but by being close to it.

\[1. Ghazzâlî here plays on the word *ayman*, the root of which means
*dexter* or *felix*.

2\. S. 28, 30.

3\. S. 42, 52.\]

{p. 133}

If the first stage of prophets is their translation into the World of
Holy Transcendence away from the disturbances of senses and imagination,
that stage is symbolized by "*the Holy Valley*".\[1\] And if the Holy
Valley may not be trodden save after the doffing of the Two Worlds (that
is, this world and the world beyond) and the soul's turning of her face
towards the One Real (for this world and the world beyond are
co-relatives and both are accidentia of the human light-substance, and
can be doffed at one time and donned at another), then the symbol of the
putting-off of these Two Worlds is the *doffing of his two sandals* by
the pilgrim to Mekka,\[2\] what time he changes his worldly garments for
the pilgrim's robe and faces towards the holy Kaaba.

Nay, but let us now translate ourselves to the Presence Dominical once
more, and speak of its symbols. If that Presence hath something whereby
the several divine sciences are engraven on the tablets of hearts
susceptible to them, that something will be symbolized by the
*Pen*.\[3\] That Within those hearts whereon those

\[1. S. 20, and 79, 16.

2\. S. 20, 12.

3\. S. 68.\]

{p. 134}

things are engraved will be typified by the *Tablet*,\[1\] *Book*,\[2\]
and *Scroll*.\[3\] \[p. 34\] If there be, above the pen that writes,
something which constrains it to service, its type will be the
*Hand*.\[4\] If the Presence which embraces Hand and Tablet, Pen and
Book, is constituted according to a definite order, It will be typified
by the *Form* or *Image*.\[5\] And if the human form has its definite
order, after that likeness, then is it created "in the Image, the Form,
of the Merciful One". Now there is a difference between saying, "In the
image of the *Merciful* One," and, "In the image of *Allâh*." For it was
the Divine Mercy that caused the image of the Divine Presence to be in
that "Image." And then Allâh, out of His grace and *mercy*, gave to Adam
a summary "image" or "form," embracing every genus and species in the
whole world, inasmuch that it was as if Adam were all that was in the
world, or were the summarized copy of the world. And Adam's form--this
summarized "image"--was inscribed in the

\[1. S. 85, 22 and 7, 44.

2\. S. 2, 1.

3\. S. 25, 3,

4\. S. 48, 36.

5\. S. 82, 8; cf. 64, 3.

6\. There must, I think, be some corruption in the text here. I suggest
reading \#\#\# for \#\#\#.\]

{p. 135}

handwriting of Allâh, so that *Adam* is the Divine handwriting, which is
not the characters of letters (for His Handwriting transcends both
characters and letters, even as His Word transcends sound and syllables,
and His Pen transcends Reed and Steel, and His Hand transcends flesh and
bone). Now, but for this *mercy*, every son of Adam would have been
powerless to know his Sovereign-Lord; for "only he who knows himself
knows his Lord." This, then, being an effect of the divine mercy, it was
"in the image *of the Merciful One*," not "in the image of Allâh," that
Adam was created. So, then, the Presence of the Godhead is not the same
as the Presence of The Merciful One, nor as the Presence of The
Kingship, nor as the Presence of the Sovereign-Lordship; for which
reason He commanded us to invoke the protection of all these Presences
severally. "*Say, I invoke the protection of the Lord of mankind, the
King of mankind, the Deity of mankind*!"\[1\] If this idea did not
underlie the expression \[p. 35\] "Allâh created man in the image of the
Merciful," the words

\[1. S. 114.\]

{p. 136}

would be linguistically incorrect; they should then have run, "after His
image."' But the words, according to Bokhari, run, "After the image of
the Merciful."

But as the distinction between the Presence of the Kingship and the
Presence of the Lordship call for a long expression, we must pass on,
and be content with the foregoing specimen of the symbolic method. For
indeed it is a shoreless sea.

But if you are conscious of a certain repulsion from this symbolism, you
may comfort yourself by the text, "*He sent down from heaven rain, and
it flowed in the valleys, according to their capacity*;"\[2\] for the
commentaries on this text tell us that the Water here is *knowledge*,
and the Valleys are *the hearts of men*.

4\.

The Permanent Validity of the Outward and Visible Sign: an Example

Pray do not assume from this specimen of symbolism and its method that
you have any

\[1. And so they are quoted on p. \[7\].

2\. S. 13, 19.\]

{p. 137}

licence from me to ignore the outward and, visible form, or to believe
that it has been annulled; as though, for example, I had asserted that
Moses had not really shoes on, did not, really hear himself addressed by
the words, "*Put thy shoes from off thy feet*."\[1\] God forbid!--The
annulment of the outward and visible sign is the tenet of the
Spiritualists (*Bâ<u>t</u>iniyya*), who, looked, utterly one-sidedly, at
one world, the, Unseen, and were grossly ignorant of the balance that
exists between it and the Seen. This aspect they wholly failed to
understand. Similarly annulment of the inward and invisible meaning in
the opinion of the Materialists. (*<u>H</u>ashawiyya*). In other words,
whoever abstracts and isolates the outward from the whole is a
Materialist, and whoever abstracts. the inward is a Spiritualist, while
he who joins the two together is catholic, perfect. For this reason the
Prophet said, "The Koran has an outward and an inward, an ending and a
beginning" (a Tradition which is, however, possibly, traceable to 'Alî,
as its pedigree stops short at his name). I assert, on the contrary,
that

\[1. S. 20, 12.\]

{p. 138}

'Moses understood from the command "*Put off thy shoes*" the Doffing of
the Two Worlds, and obeyed the command *literally* by putting off his
two sandals, and *spiritually* by putting off the Two Worlds. Here you
just have this cross-relation between the two, \[p. 36\] the crossing
over from one to the other, from outward word to inward idea. The
difference between the true and false positions may be thus illustrated.
One man hears the word of the Prophet, "The angels of Allâh enter not a
house wherein is a dog or a picture," and yet keeps a dog in the house,
because, he says, "The outward sense is not what was meant; but the
Prophet only meant, 'Turn the dog of Wrath out of the house of the
Heart, because Wrath hinders the knowledge which comes from the Lights
Angelical; for anger is the demon of the heart."' While the other
*first* carries out the command literally; and *then* says, "Dog is not
dog because of his visible form, but because of the inner idea of
dog--ferocity, ravenousness. If my house, which is the abode of my
person, of my body, must be kept clear of doggishness in concrete form,
how much more must the house of

{p. 139}

my heart, which is the abode of man's true and proper essence, be kept
clear of doggishness in spiritual idea!" The man, in fact, who combines
the two things, he is the perfect man; which is what is meant when it is
said, "The perfect man is the one who does not let the light of his
knowledge quench the light of his reverence." In the same way he is
never seen permitting himself to ignore one single ordinance of
religion, for all the perfection of his spiritual Insight. Such a thing
is grievous error; an example of which is the evil which befell some
mystics, who called it lawful to put by literal prescriptions of the
Shariat as you roll up and put-by a carpet; insomuch that one of them
perhaps went so far as to give up the ordinance of prayer, saying,
forsooth, that he was always at prayer in his heart! But this is
different from the error of those fools of Antinomians
(*Ibâ<u>h</u>iyya*) who trifle with sophisms, like the saying of one,
"Allah has no need of our works"; or of another, "The heart is full of
vices from which it cannot possibly be cleansed," \[p. 37\] and did not
even desire to eradicate anger and lust, because he believes he is

{p. 140}

\[not\] (?) commanded to eradicate them. These last, verily, are the
follies of fools; but, as for the first-named error, it reminds one of
the stumble of a high-bred horse, the error of a mystic whom the devil
has diverted from the way and "*drawn him with delusion as with
cords*".\[1\]

To return to our discussion of "the Putting-off of the Shoes." The
outward word wakens one to the inward signification, the Putting-off of
the Two Worlds. The outward symbol is a real thing, and its application
to the inward meaning is a real truth. Every real thing has its
corresponding real truth. Those who have realized this are the souls who
have attained the degree of the Transparent Glass (we shall see the
meaning of this presently). For the Imagination, which supplies, so to
speak, the clay from which the symbol is formed, is hard and gross; it
conceals the secret meanings; it is interposed between you and the
unseen lights. But once let it be clarified, and it becomes like
transparent glass, and no longer keeps out the light, but on the
contrary becomes a light-conductor. nay, that which keeps that light
from being put out.

\[1. S. 7, 21.\]

{p. 141}

by gusts of wind. The story of the Transparent Glass, however, is
coming; meanwhile, remember that the gross lower world of the
imagination became to the Prophets of God like a transparent "glass"
shade and "a niche for lights"; a strainer, filtering clear the divine
secrets; a stepping-stone to the World Supernal. Whereby we may know
that the visible symbol is real: and behind it lies a mystery. The same
holds good with the symbols of "the Mountain," "the Fire," and the rest.

5\.

Another Example of this Two-sided and Equal Validity of Outward and
Inward

When the Prophet said, "I saw Abdul-Ra<u>h</u>mân enter Paradise
crawling," you are not to suppose that he did not see him thus with his
own eyes. No, awake he saw him, as a sleeper might see him in a dream,
even though the person of Abdul-Ra<u>h</u>mân b. \`Awf was at the time
asleep in his house. \[p. 38\] The only effect of sleep in this and
similar visions is to suppress the authority of the senses over the
soul, which is the inward light divine; for the senses preoccupy the
soul, drag it back to the -Sense-world, and turn a man's face away from

{p. 142}

the world of the Invisible and of the Realm Supernal. But, with the
suppression of sense, some of the lights prophetical may become
clarified and prevail, inasmuch as the senses are no longer dragging the
soul back to their own world, nor occupying their whole attention. And
so it sees in waking what others see in sleep. But if it has attained
absolute perfection, it is not limited to apprehending the visible form
merely; it passes direct from that to the 'inner idea, and it is
disclosed to such an one that faith is drawing the soul of an
Abdul-Ra<u>h</u>mân to the World Above (described by the word
"Paradise"), while wealth and riches are drawing it down to this present
life, the World Below. If the influences which draw it to the
preoccupations of this world are more stubborn than those which draw it
to the other world, the soul is wholly turned away from its journey to
Paradise. But if the attraction of faith is stronger, the soul is merely
occasioned difficulty, or retarded, in its course, and the symbol for
this in the world of sense is *a crawl*. It is thus that mysteries are
shown forth from behind the crystal transparencies

{p. 141}

of the imagination. Nor is this limited to the Prophet's judgment about
Abdul Ra<u>h</u>mân only, though it was only him he saw at that time. He
passess judgment therein on; every man whose spiritual vision is strong,
whose faith is firm, but whose wealth has so much multiplied that it
threatens to crowd out his faith, only failing to do so because the
power of that faith more than counterbalances it. This example
illustrates to you the way in, which prophets used to see concrete
objects, and have immediate vision of the spiritual, ideas behind them.
Most frequently the idea, is presented to their direct inward vision
first, and then looks down from thence on to \[p. 39\] the imaginative
spirit and receives the imprint of some concrete object, analogous to
the idea. What is conferred by inspiration in sleeping vision or dreams
needs interpretation.\[1\]

(*ii*) THE PSYCHOLOGY OR THE HUMAN SOUL: ITS FIVE FACULTIES OR SPIRITS

The gradations of human Spirits Luminous;

\[1. (*Note by Ghazzâlî*.) The proportion borne by dreams to the other
characteristics of prophethood is as one to forty-six. That borne by
waking vision has a greater ratio-as one to three, I believe, for it has
been revealed to us that the prophetic characteristics fall definitely
into three categories, and of these three one is waking vision.\]

{p. 144}

in knowing which we may know the symbolism of the Light-Verse in Koran.

The *first* of these is the *sensory spirit*. This is the recipient of
the information brought in by the senses; for it is the root and origin
of 'the animal spirit, and constitutes the differentia, of the animal
genus. It is sound in the infant at the breast.

The *second* is the *imaginative spirit*. This .is the recorder of the
information conveyed by the senses. It keeps that information filed and
ready to hand, so as to present it to the intelligential spirit above
it, when the information is called for. It is not found in the infant at
the beginning of its evolution. This is why an infant wants to get hold
of a thing when he sees it, while he forgets about it when it is out of
his sight. No conflict of desire arises in his soul for something out of
sight until he gets a little older, when he begins to cry for it and
asks to have it, because its image is still with him, preserved in his
imagination, This faculty is possessed by some, but not all animals. It
is not found, for example, in the moth which perishes

{p. 145}

in the flame. \[p. 40\] The moth makes for the flame, because of its
desire for the sunlight, and, thinking that the flame is a window
opening to the sunlight, it hurries on to the flame, and injures itself.
Yet, if it flies on into the dark, back it comes again, time after time.
Now had it the mnemonic spirit, which gives permanence to the sensation
of pain that is conveyed by the tactile sense, it would not return to
the flame after being hurt once by it. On the other hand, the dog that
has received one whipping runs away whenever it sees the stick again.

Third, the *intelligential spirit*. This apprehends ideas beyond the
spheres of sense and imagination. It is the specifically human faculty.
It is not found in the lower animals, nor yet in children. The objects
of its apprehension are axioms of necessary and universal application,
as we mentioned in the section in which the light of intelligence was
given precedence over that of the eye.

Fourth, the *discursive spirit*. This takes the data of pure reason and
combines them,

{p. 146}

arranges them as premises, and deduces from them informing knowledge.
Then it takes, for example, two conclusions thus learned, combines them
again, and learns a fresh conclusion; and so goes on multiplying itself
*ad infinitum*.

Fifth, the *transcendental prophetic spirit*. This is the property of
prophets and some saints. By it the unseen tables and statutes of the
Law are revealed from the other world, together with several of the
sciences of the Realms Celestial and Terrestrial, and pre-eminently
theology, the science of Deity, which the intelligential and discursive
spirit cannot compass. It is this that is alluded to in the text, "*Thus
did We inspire thee with a spirit from Our power. Thou didst not know
what is the Book, nor what is Faith*, \[p. 41\] *but we made that spirit
a light wherewith we guide whom We will of our vassals. And thou,
verily, dost guide into a straight way*."\[1\] And here, a word to thee,
thou recluse in thy rational world of the intelligence! Why should it be
impossible that beyond reason there should be a further plane, on

\[1. S. 42, 52.\]

{p. 147}

which appear things which do not appear on the plane of the
intelligence, just as it is possible for the intelligence itself to be a
plane above the discriminating faculty and the senses; and for relations
of wonders and marvels to be made to it that were beyond the reach of
the senses and the discriminative faculty? Beware of making the ultimate
perfection stop at thyself! Consider the intuitive faculty of poetry, if
thou wilt have an example of everyday experience, taken from those
special gifts which particularize some men. Behold how this gift, which
is a sort of perceptive faculty, is the exclusive possession of some;
while it is so completely denied to others that they cannot even
distinguish the scansion of a typical measure from that of its several
variations. Mark how extraordinary is this intuitive faculty in some
others, insomuch that they produce music and melodies, and all the
various grief-, delight-, slumber-, weeping-, madness-, murder-, and
swoon-producing modes! Now these effects only occur strongly in one who
has this original, intuitive sense. A person destitute of it hears the
sounds just as much as the other, but

{p. 148}

the emotional effects are by him only very faintly experienced, and he
exhibits surprise at those whom they send into raptures or swoons. And
even were all the professors of music in the world to call a conference
with a view of making him understand the meaning of this musical sense,
they would be quite powerless to do so. Here, then, is an example taken
from the gross phenomena which are easiest for you to understand. Apply
this now to this peculiar prophetical sense. And strive earnestly to
become one of those who experience mystically something \[p. 42\] of the
prophetic spirit; for *saints* have a specially large portion thereof.
If thou canst not compass this, then try, by the discipline of the
syllogisms and analogies set forth or alluded to in a previous page, to
be one of those 'who have knowledge of it scientifically. But if this,
too, is beyond thy powers, then the least thou canst do is to become one
of those who simply have faith in it ("*Allâh exalts those that have
faith among you, and those who acquire knowledge in their several
ranks*").\[1\] Scientific knowledge is above faith, and mystic
experience is above knowledge. The province of mystic experience

\[1. S. 58, 11.\]

{p. 149}

is feeling; of knowledge, ratiocination, and of faith, bare acceptance
of the creed of one's fathers, together with an unsuspicious attitude
towards the two superior classes.

You now know the five human spirits. So we proceed: they are all of them
*Lights*, for it is through their agency that every sort of existing
thing is manifested, including objects of sense and imagination. For
though it is true that the lower animals also perceive these said
objects, mankind possesses a different, more refined, and higher species
of those two faculties they having been created in man for a different,
higher, and more noble end. In the lower animals they were only created
as an instrument for acquiring food, and for subjecting them to mankind.
But in mankind they were created to be a net to chase a noble quarry
through all the present world; to wit, the first principles of the
religious sciences. For example, a man may, in perceiving with his,
visual sense a certain individual, apprehend, through his intelligence,
a universal and absolute idea, as we saw in our example of Abdul Rahmân
the son of \`Awf.
