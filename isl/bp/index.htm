<P>
This celebrated Sufi poem,
also known as <CITE>Conference of the Birds</CITE>,
by the 12th century Persian poet Farid ud-Din Attar,
is a tale of a journey of a group of thirty birds to the summit of the
world mountain, Qaf.
An allegory of the Sufi journey to realization of the nature of God,
each bird has a particular signficance, a special fault, and a tale to tell.
</P>
<P>
In spite of its significance for world literature and the study of religion,
Attar's poem was not translated in its entirety until the mid-twentieth
century, and the standard English translations are
hence not in the public domain.
However Edward FitzGerald, best known as the translator of
<A HREF="../khayyam.txt">The Rubayyat of Omar Khayyam</A> 
worked on this abridged translation of the <CITE>Bird Parliament</CITE>
through 1857.
It is little known today, primarily because it was only published
posthumously (FitzGerald died in 1883),
in <CITE>Letters and Literary Remains</CITE>, edited by
William Aldis Wright, in 1889.
This is the first time an etext of FitzGerald's translation of this work has
been posted on the Internet.
