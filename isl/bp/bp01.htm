<p>Once on a time from all the Circles seven <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT></span><br> Between the stedfast Earth and rolling Heaven<br> THE BIRDS, of all Note, Plumage, and Degree,<br> That float in Air, and roost upon the Tree;<br> And they that from the Waters snatch their Meat,<br> And they that scour the Desert with long Feet;<br> Birds of all Natures, known or not to Man,<br> Flock'd from all Quarters into full Divan,<br> On no less solemn business than to find<br> Or choose, a Sultan Khalif of their kind, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT></span><br> For whom, if never theirs, or lost, they pined.<br> The Snake had his, 'twas said; and so the Beast<br> His Lion-lord: and Man had his, at least:<br> And that the Birds, who nearest were the Skies,<br> And went apparell'd in its Angel Dyes.<br> Should be without&#151;under no better Law<br> Than that which lost all other in the Maw&#151;<br> Disperst without a Bond of Union&#151;nay,<br> Or meeting to make each the other's Prey&#151;<br> This was the Grievance&#151;this the solemn Thing <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT></span><br> On which the scatter'd Commonwealth of Wing,<br> From all the four Winds, flying like to Cloud<br> That met and blacken'd Heav'n, and Thunder-loud<br> With Sound of whirring Wings and Beaks that clash'd<br> Down like a Torrent on the Desert dash'd:<br> Till by Degrees, the Hubbub and Pell-mell<br> Into some Order and Precedence fell,<br> And, Proclamation made of Silence, each<br> In special Accent, but in general Speech<br> That all should understand, as seem'd him best, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT></span><br> The Congregation of all Wings addrest.</p>  
<p>And first, with Heart so full as from his Eyes<br> Ran weeping, up rose Tajidar the Wise;<br> The mystic Mark upon whose Bosom show'd<br> That He alone of all the Birds THE ROAD<br> Had travell'd: and the Crown upon his Head<br> Had reach'd the Goal; and He stood forth and said:</p>  
<p>'O Birds, by what Authority divine<br> I speak you know by <i>His</i> authentic Sign,<br> And Name, emblazon'd on my Breast and Bill: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT></span><br> Whose Counsel I assist at, and fulfil:<br> At His Behest I measured as he plann'd<br> The Spaces of the Air and Sea and Land;<br> I gauged the secret sources of the Springs<br> From Cloud to Fish: the Shadow of my Wings<br> Dream'd over sleeping Deluge: piloted<br> The Blast that bore Sulayman's Throne: and led<br> The Cloud of Birds that canopied his Head;<br> Whose Word I brought to Balkis: and I shared<br> The Counsel that with Asaf he prepared. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT></span><br> And now you want a Khalif: and I know<br> Him, and his whereabout, and How to go:<br> And go alone I could, and plead your cause<br> Alone for all: but, by the eternal laws,<br> Yourselves by Toil and Travel of your own<br> Must for your old Delinquency atone.<br> Were you indeed not blinded by the Curse<br> Of Self-exile, that still grows worse and worse,<br> Yourselves would know that, though <i>you</i> see him not,<br> He is with you this Moment, on this Spot, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT></span><br> Your Lord through all Forgetfulness and Crime,<br> Here, There, and Everywhere, and through all Time.<br> But as a Father, whom some wayward Child<br> By sinful Self-will has unreconciled,<br> Waits till the sullen Reprobate at cost<br> Of long Repentance should regain the Lost;<br> Therefore, yourselves to see as you are seen,<br> Yourselves must bridge the Gulf you made between<br> By such a Search and Travel to be gone<br> Up to the mighty mountain Kaf, whereon <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT></span><br> Hinges the World, and round about whose Knees<br> Into one Ocean mingle the Sev'n Seas;<br> In whose impenetrable Forest-folds<br> Of Light and Dark "Symurgh" his Presence holds;<br> Not to be reach'd, if to be reach'd at all<br> But by a Road the stoutest might apal;<br> Of Travel not of Days or Months, but Years&#151;<br> Life-long perhaps: of Dangers, Doubts, and Fears<br> As yet unheard of: Sweat of Blood and Brain<br> Interminable&#151;often all in vain&#151;<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">80</FONT></span><br> And, if successful, no Return again:<br> A Road whose very Preparation scared<br> The Traveller who yet must be prepared.<br> Who then this Travel to Result would bring<br> Needs both a Lion's Heart beneath the Wing,<br> And even more, a Spirit purified<br> Of Worldly Passion, Malice, Lust, and Pride:<br> Yea, ev'n of Worldly <i>Wisdom</i>, which grows dim<br> And dark, the nearer it approaches <i>Him</i>,<br> Who to the Spirit's Eye alone reveal'd, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">90</FONT></span><br> By sacrifice of Wisdom's self unseal'd;<br> Without which none who reach the Place could bear<br> To look upon the Glory dwelling there.'</p>  
<p>One Night from out the swarming City Gate<br> Stept holy Bajazyd, to meditate<br> Alone amid the breathing Fields that lay<br> In solitary Silence leagues away,<br> Beneath a Moon and Stars as bright as Day.<br> And the Saint wondering such a Temple were,<br> And so lit up, and scarce one worshipper, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">100</FONT></span><br> A voice from Heav'n amid the stillness said:<br> 'The Royal Road is not for all to tread,<br> Nor is the Royal Palace for the Rout,<br> Who, even if they reach it, are shut out.<br> The Blaze that from my Harim window breaks<br> With fright the Rabble of the Roadside takes;<br> And ev'n of those that at my Portal din,<br> Thousands may knock for one that enters in.'</p>  
<p>Thus spoke the Tajidar: and the wing'd Crowd,<br> That underneath his Word in Silence bow'd, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">110</FONT></span><br> Clapp'd Acclamation: and their Hearts and Eyes<br> Were kindled by the Firebrand of the Wise.<br> They felt their Degradation: they believed<br> The word that told them how to be retrieved,<br> And in that glorious Consummation won<br> Forgot the Cost at which it must be done.<br> 'They only <i>long'd</i> to follow: they would go<br> Whither he led, through Flood, or Fire, or Snow'&#151;<br> So cried the Multitude. But some there were<br> Who listen'd with a cold disdainful air, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">120</FONT></span><br> Content with what they were, or grudging Cost<br> Of Time or Travel that might all be lost;<br> These, one by one, came forward, and preferr'd<br> Unwise Objection: which the wiser Word<br> Shot with direct Reproof, or subtly round<br> With Argument and Allegory wound.</p>  
<p>The <i>Pheasant</i> first would know by what pretence<br> The Tajidar to that pre-eminence<br> Was raised&#151;a Bird, but for his lofty Crest<br> (And such the Pheasant had) like all the Rest&#151;<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">130</FONT></span><br> Who answer'd&#151;'By no Virtue of my own<br> Sulayman chose me, but by <i>His</i> alone:<br> Not by the Gold and Silver of my Sighs<br> Made mine, but the free Largess of his Eyes.<br> Behold the Grace of Allah comes and goes<br> As to Itself is good: and no one knows<br> Which way it turns: in that mysterious Court<br> Not he most finds who furthest travels for't.<br> For one may crawl upon his knees Life-long,<br> And yet may never reach, or all go wrong: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">140</FONT></span><br> Another just arriving at the Place<br> He toil'd for, and&#151;the Door shut in his Face:<br> Whereas Another, scarcely gone a Stride,<br> And suddenly&#151;Behold he is Inside!&#151;<br> But though the Runner win not, he that <i>stands</i>,<br> No Thorn will turn to Roses in <i>his</i> Hands:<br> Each one must do his best and all endure,<br> And all endeavour, hoping but not sure.<br> Heav'n its own Umpire is; its Bidding do,<br> And Thou perchance shalt be Sulayman's too.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">150</FONT></span></p>  
<p>One day Shah Mahmud, riding with the Wind<br> A-hunting, left his Retinue behind,<br> And coming to a River, whose swift Course<br> Doubled back Game and Dog, and Man and Horse,<br> Beheld upon the Shore a little Lad<br> A-fishing, very poor, and Tatter-clad<br> He was, and weeping as his Heart would break.<br> So the Great Sultan, for good humour's sake<br> Pull'd in his Horse a moment, and drew nigh,<br> And after making his Salam, ask'd why <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">160</FONT></span><br> He wept&#151;weeping, the Sultan said, so sore<br> As he had never seen one weep before.<br> The Boy look'd up, and 'O Amir,' he said,<br> 'Sev'n of us are at home, and Father dead,<br> And Mother left with scarce a Bit of Bread:<br> And now since Sunrise have I fish'd&#151;and see!<br> Caught nothing for our Supper&#151;Woe is Me!'<br> The Sultan lighted from his horse. 'Behold,'<br> Said he, 'Good Fortune will not be controll'd:<br> And, since Today yours seems to turn from you, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">170</FONT></span><br> Suppose we try for once what mine will do,<br> And we will share alike in all I win.'<br> So the Shah took, and flung his Fortune in,<br> The Net; which, cast by the Great Mahmud's Hand,<br> A hundred glittering Fishes brought to Land.<br> The Lad look'd up in Wonder&#151;Mahmud smiled<br> And vaulted into Saddle. But the Child<br> Ran after&#151;'Nay, Amir, but half the Haul<br> Is yours by Bargain'&#151;'Nay, Today take all,'<br> The Sultan cried, and shook his Bridle free&#151;<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">180</FONT></span><br> 'But mind&#151;Tomorrow All belongs to Me&#151;'<br> And so rode off. Next morning at Divan<br> The Sultan's Mind upon his Bargain ran,<br> And being somewhat in a mind for sport<br> Sent for the Lad: who, carried up to Court,<br> And marching into Royalty's full Blaze<br> With such a Catch of Fish as yesterday's,<br> The Sultan call'd and set him by his side,<br> And asking him, 'What Luck?' The Boy replied,<br> '<i>This</i> is the Luck that follows every Cast, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">190</FONT></span><br> Since o'er my Net the Sultan's Shadow pass'd.'</p>  
<p>Then came <i>The Nightingale</i>, from such a Draught<br> Of Ecstasy that from the Rose he quaff'd<br> Reeling as drunk, and ever did distil<br> In exquisite divisions from his Bill<br> To inflame the Hearts of Men&#151;and thus sang He&#151;<br> 'To me alone, alone, is giv'n the Key<br> Of Love; of whose whole Mystery possesst,<br> When I reveal a little to the Rest,<br> Forthwith Creation listening forsakes <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">200</FONT></span><br> The Reins of Reason, and my Frenzy takes:<br> Yea, whosoever once has quaint this wine<br> He leaves unlisten'd David's Song for mine.<br> In vain do Men for my Divisions strive,<br> And die themselves making dead Lutes alive:<br> I hang the Stars with Meshes for Men's Souls:<br> The Garden underneath my Music rolls.<br> The long, long Morns that mourn the Rose away<br> I sit in silence, and on Anguish prey:<br> But the first Air which the New Year shall breathe <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">210</FONT></span><br> Up to my Boughs of Message from beneath<br> That in her green Harim my Bride unveils,<br> My Throat bursts silence and <i>her</i> Advent hails,<br> Who in her crimson Volume registers<br> The Notes of Him whose Life is lost in hers.<br> The Rose I love and worship now is here;<br> If dying, yet reviving, Year by Year;<br> But that you tell of, all my Life why waste<br> In vainly searching; or, if found, not taste?'</p>  
<p>So with Division infinite and Trill <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">220</FONT></span><br> On would the Nightingale have warbled still,<br> And all the World have listen'd; but a Note<br> Of sterner Import check'd the lovesick Throat.</p>  
<p>'O watering with thy melodious Tears<br> Love's Garden, and who dost indeed the Ears<br> Of men with thy melodious Fingers mould<br> As David's Finger Iron did of old:<br> Why not, like David, dedicate thy Dower<br> Of Song to something better than a Flower?<br> Empress indeed of Beauty, so they say, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">230</FONT></span><br> But one whose Empire hardly lasts a Day,<br> By Insurrection of the Morning's Breath<br> That made her hurried to Decay and Death:<br> And while she lasts contented to be seen,<br> And worshipt, for the Garden's only Queen,<br> Leaving thee singing on thy Bough forlorn,<br> Or if she smile on Thee, perhaps in Scorn.'</p>  
<p>Like that fond Dervish waiting in the throng<br> When some World-famous Beauty went along,<br> Who smiling on the Antic as she pass'd&#151;<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">240</FONT></span><br> Forthwith Staff, Bead and Scrip away he cast,<br> And grovelling in the Kennel, took to whine<br> Before her Door among the Dogs and Swine.<br> Which when she often went unheeding by,<br> But one day quite as heedless ask'd him&#151;'Why?'&#151;<br> He told of that one Smile, which, all the Rest<br> Passing, had kindled Hope within his Breast&#151;<br> Again she smiled and said, 'O self-beguiled<br> Poor Wretch, at whom and not on whom I smiled.'</p>  
<p>Then came the subtle <i>Parrot</i> in a coat <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">250</FONT></span><br> Greener than Greensward, and about his Throat<br> A Collar ran of sub-sulphureous Gold;<br> And in his Beak a Sugar-plum he troll'd,<br> That all his Words with luscious Lisping ran,<br> And to this Tune&#151;'O cruel Cage, and Man<br> More iron still who did confine me there,<br> Who else with him whose Livery I wear<br> Ere this to his Eternal Fount had been,<br> And drunk what should have kept me ever-green.<br> But now I know the Place, and I am free <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">260</FONT></span><br> To go, and all the Wise will follow Me.<br> Some'&#151;and upon the Nightingale one Eye<br> He leer'd&#151;'for nothing but the Blossom sigh:<br> But I am for the luscious Pulp that grows<br> Where, and for which the Blossom only blows:<br> And which so long as the Green Tree provides<br> What better grows along Kaf's dreary Sides?<br> And what more needful Prophet <i>there</i> than He<br> Who gives me Life to nip it from the Tree?'</p>  
<p>To whom the Tajidar&#151;'O thou whose Best <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">270</FONT></span><br> In the green leaf of Paradise is drest,<br> But whose Neck kindles with a lower Fire&#151;<br> O slip the collar off of base Desire,<br> And stand apparell'd in Heav'n's Woof entire!<br> <i>This</i> Life that hangs so sweet about your Lips<br> But, spite of all your Khizar, slips and slips,<br> What is it but itself the coarser Rind<br> Of the True Life withinside and behind,<br> Which he shall never&nbsp;never reach unto<br> Till the gross Shell of Carcase he break through?' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">280</FONT></span></p>  
<p>For what said He, that dying Hermit, whom<br> Your Prophet came to, trailing through the Gloom<br> His Emerald Vest, and tempted&#151;'Come with Me,<br> And Live.' The Hermit answered&#151;'Not with Thee.<br> Two Worlds there are, and <i>This</i> was thy Design,<br> And thou hast got it; but The <i>Next</i> is mine;<br> Whose Fount is <i>this</i> life's Death, and to whose Side<br> Ev'n now I find my Way without a Guide.'</p>  
<p>Then like a Sultan glittering in all Rays<br> Of Jewelry, and deckt with his own Blaze, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">290</FONT></span><br> The glorious Peacock swept into the Ring:<br> And, turning slowly that the glorious Thing<br> Might fill all Eyes with wonder, thus said He.<br> 'Behold, the Secret Artist, making me,<br> With no one Colour of the skies bedeckt,<br> But from its Angel's Feathers did select<br> To make up mine withal, the Gabriel<br> Of all the Birds: though from my Place I fell<br> In Eden, when Acquaintance I did make<br> In those blest days with that Sev'n-headed Snake, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">300</FONT></span><br> And thence with him, my perfect Beauty marr'd<br> With these ill Feet, was thrust out and debarr'd.<br> Little I care for Worldly Fruit or Flower,<br> Would you restore me to lost Eden's Bower,<br> But first my Beauty making all complete<br> With reparation of these ugly Feet.'</p>  
<p>'Were it,' 'twas answer'd, 'only to return<br> To that lost Eden, better far to burn<br> In Self-abasement up thy plum&eacute;d Pride,<br> And ev'n with lamer feet to creep inside&#151;<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">310</FONT></span><br> But all mistaken you and all like you<br> That long for that lost Eden as the true;<br> Fair as it was, still nothing but the shade<br> And Out-court of the Majesty that made.<br> That which I point you tow'rd, and which the King<br> I tell you of broods over with his Wing,<br> With no deciduous leaf, but with the Rose<br> Of Spiritual Beauty, smells and glows:<br> No plot of Earthly Pleasance, but the whole<br> True Garden of the Universal Soul.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">320</FONT></span></p>  
<p>For so Creation's Master-Jewel fell<br> From that same Eden: loving which too well,<br> The Work before the Artist did prefer,<br> And in the Garden lost the Gardener.<br> Wherefore one Day about the Garden went<br> A voice that found him in his false Content,<br> And like a bitter Sarsar of the North<br> Shrivell'd the Garden up, and drove him forth<br> Into the Wilderness: and so the Eye<br> Of Eden closed on him till by and by. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">330</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then from a Ruin where conceal'd he lay<br> Watching his buried Gold, and hating Day,<br> Hooted <i>The Owl</i>.&#151;'I tell you, my Delight<br> Is in the Ruin and the Dead of Night<br> Where I was born, and where I love to wone<br> All my Life long, sitting on some cold stone<br> Away from all your roystering Companies,<br> In some dark Corner where a Treasure lies;<br> That, buried by some Miser in the Dark,<br> Speaks up to me at Midnight like a Spark; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">340</FONT></span><br> And o'er it like a Talisman I brood,<br> Companion of the Serpent and the Toad.<br> What need of other Sovereign, having found,<br> And keeping as in Prison underground,<br> One before whom all other Kings bow down,<br> And with his glittering Heel their Foreheads crown?'</p>  
<p>'He that a Miser lives and Miser dies,<br> At the Last Day what Figure shall he rise?'</p>  
<p>A Fellow all his life lived hoarding Gold,<br> And, dying, hoarded left it. And behold, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">350</FONT></span><br> One Night his Son saw peering through the House<br> A Man, with yet the semblance of a Mouse,<br> Watching a crevice in the Wall&#151;and cried<br> 'My Father?'&#151;'Yes,' the Musulman replied,<br> 'Thy Father!'&#151;'But why watching thus?'&#151;'For fear<br> Lest any smell my Treasure buried here.'<br> 'But wherefore, Sir, so metamousified?'<br> 'Because, my Son, such is the true outside<br> Of the inner Soul by which I lived and died.'</p>  
<p>'Aye,' said <i>The Partridge</i>, with his Foot and Bill <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">360</FONT></span><br> Crimson with raking Rubies from the Hill,<br> And clattering his Spurs&#151;'Wherewith the Ground<br> I stab,' said he, 'for Rubies, that, when found<br> I swallow; which, as soon as swallow'd, turn<br> To Sparks which though my beak and eyes do burn.<br> Gold, as you say, is but dull Metal dead,<br> And hanging on the Hoarder's Soul like Lead:<br> But Rubies that have Blood within, and grown<br> And nourisht in the Mountain Heart of Stone,<br> Burn with an inward Light, which they inspire, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">370</FONT></span><br> And make their Owners Lords of their Desire.'</p>  
<p>To whom the Tajidar&#151;'As idly sold<br> To the quick Pebble as the drowsy Gold,<br> As dead when sleeping in their mountain mine<br> As dangerous to Him who makes them shine:<br> Slavish indeed to do their Lord's Commands,<br> And slave-like aptest to escape his Hands,<br> And serve a second Master like the first,<br> And working all their wonders for the worst.'</p>  
<p>Never was Jewel after or before <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">380</FONT></span><br> Like that Sulayman for a Signet wore:<br> Whereby one Ruby, weighing scarce a grain<br> Did Sea and Land and all therein constrain,<br> Yea, ev'n the Winds of Heav'n&#151;made the fierce East<br> Bear his League-wide Pavilion like a Beast,<br> Whither he would: yea, the Good Angel held<br> His subject, and the lower Fiend compell'd.<br> Till, looking round about him in his pride,<br> He overtax'd the Fountain that supplied,<br> Praying that after him no Son of Clay <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">390</FONT></span><br> Should ever touch his Glory. And one Day<br> Almighty God his Jewel stole away,<br> And gave it to the Div, who with the Ring<br> Wore also the Resemblance of the King,<br> And so for forty days play'd such a Game<br> As blots Sulayman's forty years with Shame.</p>  
<p>Then <i>The Shah-Falcon</i>, tossing up his Head<br> Blink-hooded as it was&#151;'Behold,' he said,<br> 'I am the chosen Comrade of the King,<br> And perch upon the Fist that wears the Ring; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">400</FONT></span><br> Born, bred, and nourisht, in the Royal Court,<br> I take the Royal Name and make the Sport.<br> And if strict Discipline I undergo<br> And half my Life am blinded&#151;be it so;<br> Because the Shah's Companion ill may brook<br> On aught save Royal Company to look.<br> And why am Ito leave my King, and fare<br> With all these Rabble Wings I know not where?'&#151;</p>  
<p>'O blind indeed'&#151;the Answer was, 'and dark<br> To any but a vulgar Mortal Mark, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">410</FONT></span><br> And drunk with Pride of Vassalage to those<br> Whose Humour like their Kingdom comes and goes;<br> All Mutability: who one Day please<br> To give: and next Day what they gave not seize:<br> Like to the Fire: a dangerous Friend at best,<br> Which who keeps farthest from does wiseliest.</p>  
<p>A certain Shah there was in Days foregone<br> Who had a lovely Slave he doted on,<br> And cherish'd as the Apple of his Eye,<br> Clad gloriously, fed sumptuously, set high, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">420</FONT></span><br> And never was at Ease were <i>He</i> not by,<br> Who yet, for all this Sunshine, Day by Day<br> Was seen to wither like a Flower away.<br> Which, when observing, one without the Veil<br> Of Favour ask'd the Favourite&#151;'Why so pale<br> And sad?' thus sadly answer'd the poor Thing&#151;<br> 'No Sun that rises sets until the King,<br> Whose Archery is famous among Men,<br> Aims at an Apple on my Head. and when<br> The stricken Apple splits. and those who stand <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">430</FONT></span><br> Around cry "Lo! the Shah's unerring Hand!"<br> Then He too laughing asks me "Why so pale<br> And sorrow-some? as could the Sultan fail,<br> Who such a master of the Bow confest,<br> And aiming by the Head that he loves best."'</p>  
<p>Then on a sudden swoop'd <i>The Phoenix</i> down<br> As though he wore as well as gave The Crown:<br> And cried&#151;'I care not, I, to wait on Kings,<br> Whose crowns are but the Shadow of my Wings!'</p>  
<p>'Aye,' was the Answer&#151;'And, pray, how has sped, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">440</FONT></span><br> On which it lighted, many a mortal Head?'</p>  
<p>A certain Sultan dying, his Vizier<br> In Dream beheld him, and in mortal Fear<br> Began&#151;'O mighty Shah of Shahs! Thrice-blest'&#151;<br> But loud the Vision shriek'd and struck its Breast,<br> And 'Stab me not with empty Title!' cried&#151;<br> 'One only Shah there is, and none beside,<br> Who from his Throne above for certain Ends<br> Awhile some Spangle of his Glory lends<br> To Men on Earth; but calling in again <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">450</FONT></span><br> Exacts a strict account of every Grain.<br> Sultan I lived, and held the World in scorn:<br> O better had I glean'd the Field of Corn!<br> O better had I been a Beggar born,<br> And for my Throne and Crown, down in the Dust<br> My living Head had laid where Dead I must!<br> O wither'd, wither'd, wither'd, be the Wing<br> Whose overcasting Shadow made me King!'</p>

<p>When Yusuf from his Father's Home was torn,<br> The Patriarch's Heart was utterly forlorn, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">520</FONT></span><br> And, like a Pipe with but one stop, his Tongue<br> With nothing but the name of 'Yusuf' rung.<br> Then down from Heaven's Branches flew the <i>Bird<br> Of Heav'n</i> and said 'God wearies of that word:<br> Hast thou not else to do and else to say?'<br> So Jacob's lips were seal&eacute;d from that Day.<br> But one Night in a Vision, far away<br> His darling in some alien Field he saw<br> Binding the Sheaf; and what between the Awe<br> Of God's Displeasure and the bitter Pass <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">530</FONT></span><br> Of passionate Affection, sigh'd 'Alas&#151;'<br> And stopp'd&#151;But with the morning Sword of Flame<br> That oped his Eyes the sterner Angel's came<br> 'For the forbidden Word not utter'd by<br> Thy Lips was yet sequester'd in that Sigh.'<br> And the right Passion whose Excess was wrong<br> Blinded the aged Eyes that wept too long.</p>

<p>Shah Mahmud, absent on an Enterprise,<br> Ayas, the very Darling of his eyes,<br> At home under an Evil Eye fell sick,<br> Then cried the Sultan to a soldier 'Quick! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">650</FONT></span><br> To Horse! to Horse! without a Moment's Stay,&#151;<br> The shortest Road with all the Speed you may,&#151;<br> Or, by the Lord, your Head shall pay for it!'&#151;<br> Off went the Soldier, plying Spur and Bit&#151;<br> Over the sandy Desert, over green<br> Valley, and Mountain, and the Stream between,<br> Without a Moment's Stop for rest or bait,<br> Up to the City&#151;to the Palace Gate&#151;<br> Up to the Presence-Chamber at a Stride&#151;<br> And Lo!

The Sultan guess'd<br> His Thought and smiled. 'Indeed your Best you did,<br> The nearest Road you knew, and well you rid:<br> And if <i>I</i> knew a shorter, my Excess<br> Of Knowledge does but justify thy Less.'</p>  
<p>And then, with drooping Crest and Feather, came<br> Others, bow'd down with Penitence and Shame.<br> They long'd indeed to go; 'but how begin,<br> Mesh'd and entangled as they were in Sin <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">670</FONT></span><br> Which often-times Repentance of past Wrong<br> As often broken had but knit more strong?'<br> Whom the wise Leader bid be of good cheer,<br> And, conscious of the Fault, dismiss the Fear,<br> Nor at the very Entrance of the Fray<br> Their Weapon, ev'n if broken, fling away:<br> Since Mercy on the broken Branch anew<br> Would blossom were but each Repentance true.</p>  
<p>For did not God his Prophet take to Task?<br> 'Sev'n-times of Thee did Karun Pardon ask; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">680</FONT></span><br> Which, hadst thou been like Me his Maker&#151;yea,<br> But present at the Kneading of his Clay<br> With those twain Elements of Hell and Heav'n,&#151;<br> One prayer had won what Thou deny'st to Sev'n.'</p>  
<p>For like a Child sent with a fluttering Light<br> To feel his way along a gusty Night<br> Man walks the World: again and yet again<br> The Lamp shall be by Fits of Passion slain:<br> But shall not He who sent him from the Door<br> Relight the Lamp once more, and yet once more? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">690</FONT></span></p>  
<p>When the rebellious Host from Death shall wake<br> Black with Despair of Judgment, God shall take<br> Ages of holy Merit from the Count<br> Of Angels to make up Man's short Amount,<br> And bid the murmuring Angel gladly spare<br> Of that which, undiminishing his Share,<br> Of Bliss, shall rescue Thousands from the Cost<br> Of Bankruptcy within the Prison lost.</p>  
<p>Another Story told how in the Scale<br> Good Will beyond mere Knowledge would prevail. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">700</FONT></span></p>  
<p>In Paradise the Angel Gabriel heard<br> The Lips of Allah trembling with the Word<br> Of perfect Acceptation: and he thought<br> 'Some perfect Faith such perfect Answer wrought,<br> But whose?'&#151;And therewith slipping from the Crypt<br> Of Sidra, through the Angel-ranks he slipt<br> Watching what Lip yet trembled with the Shot<br> That so had hit the Mark&#151;but found it not.<br> Then, in a Glance to Earth, he threaded through<br> Mosque, Palace, Cell and Cottage of the True <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">710</FONT></span><br> Belief&#151;in vain; so back to Heaven went<br> And&#151;Allah's Lips still trembling with assent!<br> Then the tenacious Angel once again<br> Threaded the Ranks of Heav'n and Earth&#151;in vain&#151;<br> Till, once again return'd to Paradise,<br> There, looking into God's, the Angel's Eyes<br> Beheld the Prayer that brought that Benison<br> Rising like Incense from the Lips of one<br> Who to an Idol bowed&#151;as best he knew<br> Under that False God worshipping the True. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">720</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And then came others whom the summons found<br> Not wholly sick indeed, but far from sound:<br> Whose light inconstant Soul alternate flew<br> From Saint to Sinner, and to both untrue;<br> Who like a niggard Tailor, tried to match<br> Truth's single Garment with a worldly Patch.<br> A dangerous Game; for, striving to adjust<br> The hesitating Scale of either Lust,<br> That which had least within it upward flew,<br> And still the weightier to the Earth down drew, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">730</FONT></span><br> And, while suspended between Rise and Fall,<br> Apt with a shaking Hand to forfeit all.</p>  
<p>There was a Queen of Egypt like the Bride<br> Of Night, Full-moon-faced and Canopus-eyed,<br> Whom one among the meanest of her Crowd<br> Loved&#151;and she knew it (for he loved aloud),<br> And sent for him, and said 'Thou lov'st thy Queen:<br> Now therefore Thou hast this to choose between:<br> Fly for thy Life: or for this one night Wed<br> Thy Queen, and with the Sunrise lose thy Head.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">740</FONT></span><br> He paused&#151;he turn'd to fly&#151;she struck him dead.<br> 'For had he truly loved his Queen,' said She,<br> 'He would at once have giv'n his Life for me,<br> And Life and Wife had carried: but he lied;<br> And loving only Life, has justly died.'</p>  
<p>And then came one who having clear'd his Throat<br> With sanctimonious Sweetness in his Note<br> Thus lisp'd&#151;'Behold I languish from the first<br> With passionate and unrequited Thirst<br> Of Love for more than any mortal Bird. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">750</FONT></span><br> Therefore have I withdrawn me from the Herd<br> To pine in Solitude.

<p>But he was sternly checkt. 'I tell thee this:<br> Such Boast is no Assurance of such Bliss:<br> Thou canst not even fill the sail of Prayer<br> Unless from <i>Him</i> breathe that authentic Air<br> That shall lift up the Curtain that divides <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">760</FONT></span><br> His Lover from the Harim where <i>He</i> hides&#151;<br> And the Fulfilment of thy Vows must be,<br> Not from thy Love for Him, but His for Thee.'</p>  
<p>The third night after Bajazyd had died,<br> One saw him, in a dream, at his Bedside,<br> And said, 'Thou Bajazyd? Tell me O Pyr,<br> How fared it there with Munkar and Nakyr?' <br> And Bajazyd replied, 'When from the Grave<br> They met me rising, and "If Allah's slave"<br> Ask'd me, "or collar'd with the Chain of Hell?" <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">770</FONT></span><br> I said "Not I but God alone can tell:<br> My Passion for his service were but fond<br> Ambition had not He approved the Bond:<br> Had He not round my neck the Collar thrown<br> And told me in the Number of his own;<br> And that He only knew. What signifies<br> A hundred Years of Prayer if none replies?"'</p>  
<p>'But,' said Another, 'then shall none the Seal<br> Of Acceptation on his Forehead feel<br> Ere the Grave yield them on the other Side <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">780</FONT></span><br> Where all is settled?'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Chief replied&#151;<br> 'Enough for us to know that who is meet<br> Shall enter, and with unreprov&eacute;d Feet,<br> (Ev'n as he might upon the Waters walk)<br> The Presence-room, and in the Presence talk<br> With such unbridled Licence as shall seem<br> To the Uninitiated to blaspheme.'</p>  
<p>Just as another Holy Spirit fled,<br> The Skies above him burst into a Bed<br> Of Angels looking down and singing clear <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">790</FONT></span><br> 'Nightingale! Nightingale! thy Rose is here!'<br> And yet, the Door wide open to that Bliss,<br> As some hot Lover slights a scanty Kiss,<br> The Saint cried 'All I sigh'd for come to <i>this</i>?<br> I who lifelong have struggled, Lord, to be<br> Not of thy Angels one, but one with Thee!'</p>  
<p>Others were sure that all he said was true:<br> They were extremely wicked, that they knew:<br> And much they long'd to go at once&#151;but some,<br> They said, so unexpectedly had come <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">800</FONT></span><br> Leaving their Nests half-built&#151;in bad Repair&#151;<br> With Children in&#151;Themselves about to pair&#151;<br> 'Might he not choose a better Season&#151;nay,<br> Better perhaps a Year or Two's Delay,<br> Till all was settled, and themselves more stout<br> And strong to carry their Repentance out&#151;<br> And then'&#151;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And then, the same or like Excuse,<br> With harden'd Heart and Resolution loose<br> With dallying: and old Age itself engaged<br> Still to shirk that which shirking we have aged: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">810</FONT></span><br> And so with Self-delusion, till, too late,<br> Death upon all Repentance shuts the Gate;<br> Or some fierce blow compels the Way to choose,<br> And forced Repentance half its Virtue lose.'</p>  
<p>As of an aged Indian King they tell<br> Who, when his Empire with his Army fell<br> Under young Mahmud's Sword of Wrath, was sent<br> At sunset to the Conqueror in his Tent;<br> But, ere the old King's silver head could reach<br> The Ground, was lifted up&#151;with kindly Speech, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">820</FONT></span><br> And with so holy Mercy reassured,<br> That, after due Persuasion, he abjured<br> His idols, sate upon Mahmud's Divan,<br> And took the Name and Faith of Musulman.<br> But when the Night fell, in his Tent alone<br> The poor old King was heard to weep and groan<br> And smite his Bosom; which, when Mahmud knew,<br> He went to him and said 'Lo, if Thou rue<br> Thy lost Dominion, Thou shalt wear the Ring<br> Of thrice as large a Realm.' But the dark King <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">830</FONT></span><br> Still wept, and Ashes on his Forehead threw<br> And cried 'Not for my Kingdom lost I rue:<br> But thinking how at the Last Day, will stand<br> <i>The</i> Prophet with <i>The Volume</i> in his Hand,<br> And ask of me "How was't that, in thy Day<br> Of Glory, Thou didst turn from Me and slay<br> My People; but soon as thy Infidel<br> Before my True Believers' Army fell<br> Like Corn before the Reaper&#151;thou didst own<br> His Sword who scoutedst <i>Me</i>."

<p>Then after cheering others who delay'd,<br> Not of the Road but of Themselves afraid,<br> The Tajidar the Troop of those address'd,<br> Whose uncomplying Attitude confess'd<br> Their Souls entangled in the old Deceit,<br> And hankering still after forbidden Meat&#151;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'O ye who so long feeding on the Husk<br> Forgo the Fruit, and doting on the Dusk<br> Of the false Dawn, are blinded to the True: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">850</FONT></span><br> That in the Maidan of this World pursue<br> The Golden Ball which, driven to the Goal,<br> Wins the World's Game but loses your own Soul:<br> Or like to Children after Bubbles run<br> That still elude your Fingers; or, if won,<br> Burst in Derision at your Touch; all thin<br> Glitter without, and empty Wind within.<br> So as a prosperous Worldling on the Bed<br> Of Death&#151;"Behold, I am as one," he said,<br> "Who all my Life long have been measuring Wind, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">860</FONT></span><br> And, dying, now leave even that behind"&#151;<br> This World's a Nest in which the Cockatrice<br> Is warm'd and hatcht of Vanity and Vice:<br> A false Bazaar whose Wares are all a lie,<br> Or never worth the Price at which you buy:<br> A many-headed Monster that, supplied<br> The faster, faster is unsatisfied;<br> So as one, hearing a rich Fool one day<br> To God for yet one other Blessing pray,<br> Bid him no longer bounteous Heaven tire <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">870</FONT></span><br> For Life to feed, but Death to quench, the Fire.<br> And what are all the Vanities and Wiles<br> In which the false World decks herself and smiles<br> To draw Men down into her harlot Lap?<br> Lusts of the Flesh that Soul and Body sap,<br> And, melting Soul down into carnal Lust,<br> Ev'n that for which 'tis sacrificed disgust:<br> Or Lust of worldly Glory&#151;hollow more<br> Than the Drum beaten at the Sultan's Door,<br> And fluctuating with the Breath of Man <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">880</FONT></span><br> As the Vain Banner flapping in the Van.<br> And Lust of Gold&#151;perhaps of Lusts the worst;<br> The mis-created Idol most accurst<br> That between Man and Him who made him stands:<br> The Felon that with suicidal hands<br> He sweats to dig and rescue from his Grave,<br> And sets at large to make Himself its Slave.</p>

<p>So Sultan Mahmud, coming Face to Face<br> With mightier numbrs of the swarthy Race,<br> Vow'd that if God to him the battle gave,<br> God's Dervish People all the Spoil should have.<br> And God the Battle gave him; and the Fruit<br> Of a great Conquest coming to compute,<br> A Murmur through the Sultan's Army stirr'd <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1010</FONT></span><br> Lest, ill committed to one hasty Word,<br> The Shah should squander on an idle Brood<br> What should be theirs who earn'd it with their Blood,<br> Or go to fill the Coffers of the State.<br> So Mahmud's Soul began to hesitate:<br> Till looking round in Doubt from side to side<br> A raving Zealot in the Press he spied,<br> And call'd and had him brought before his Face,<br> And, telling, bid him arbitrate the case.<br> Who, having listen'd, said&#151;'The Thing is plain: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1020</FONT></span><br> If Thou and God should never have again<br> To deal together, rob him of his share:<br> But if perchance you should&#151;why then Beware!'</p>  
<p>So spake the Tajidar: but Fear and Doubt<br> Among the Birds in Whispers went about:<br> Great was their Need: and Succour to be sought<br> At any Risk: at any Ransom bought:<br> But such a Monarch&#151;greater than Mahmud<br> The Great Himself!

<p>'The Road!

<p>Then cried the Spokesman, 'Be it even so:<br> Let us but see the Fount from which we flow,<br> 'And, seeing, lose Ourselves therein!' and, Lo!<br> Before the Word was utter'd, or the Tongue<br> Of Fire replied, or Portal open flung.<br> They were <i>within</i>&#151;they were before the <i>Throne</i>, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1370</FONT></span><br> Before the Majesty that sat thereon,<br> But wrapt in so insufferable a Blaze<br> Of Glory as beat down their baffled Gaze.<br> Which, downward dropping, fell upon a Scroll<br> That, Lightning-like, flash'd back on each the whole<br> Past half-forgotten Story of his Soul:<br> Like that which Yusuf in his Glory gave<br> His Brethren as some Writing he would have<br> Interpreted; and at a Glance, behold<br> Their own Indenture for their Brother sold! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1380</FONT></span><br> And so with these poor Thirty: who, abasht<br> In Memory all laid bare and Conscience lasht,<br> By full Confession and Self-loathing flung<br> The Rags of carnal Self that round them clung;<br> And, their old selves self-knowledged and self-loathed,<br> And in the Soul's Integrity re-clothed,<br> Once more they ventured from the Dust to raise<br> Their Eyes&#151;up to the Throne&#151;into the Blaze,<br> And in the Centre of the Glory there<br> Beheld the Figure of&#151;<i>Themselves</i>&#151;as 'twere <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1390</FONT></span><br> Transfigured&#151;looking to Themselves, beheld<br> The Figure on the Throne en-miracled,<br> Until their Eyes themselves and That between<br> Did hesitate which <i>S&euml;er</i> was, which <i>Seen</i>;<br> They That, That They: Another, yet the Same:<br> Dividual, yet One: from whom there came<br> A Voice of awful Answer, scarce discern'd<br> From <i>which</i> to Aspiration <i>whose</i> return'd<br> They scarcely knew; as when some Man apart<br> Answers aloud the Question in his Heart&#151;<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1400</FONT></span><br> 'The Sun of my Perfection is a Glass<br> Wherein from <i>Seeing</i> into <i>Being</i> pass<br> All who, reflecting as reflected see<br> Themselves in Me, and Me in Them: not Me,<br> But all of Me that a contracted Eye<br> Is comprehensive of Infinity:<br> Nor yet <i>Themselves</i>: no Selves, but of The All<br> Fractions, from which they split and whither fall.<br> As Water lifted from the Deep, again<br> Falls back in individual Drops of Rain <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1410</FONT></span><br> Then melts into the Universal Main.<br> All you have been, and seen, and done, and thought,<br> Not <i>You</i> but <i>I</i>, have seen and been and wrought:<br> I was the Sin that from Myself rebell'd:<br> I the Remorse that tow'rd Myself compell'd:<br> I was the Tajidar who led the Track:<br> I was the little Briar that pull'd you back:<br> Sin and Contrition&#151;Retribution owed,<br> And cancell'd&#151;Pilgrim, Pilgrimage, and Road,<br> Was but Myself toward Myself: and Your <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">1420</FONT></span><br> Arrival but <i>Myself</i> at my own Door:<br> Who in your Fraction of Myself behold<br> Myself within the Mirror Myself hold<br> To see Myself in, and each part of Me<br> That sees himself, though drown'd, shall ever see.<br> Come you lost Atoms to your Centre draw,<br> And <i>be</i> the Eternal Mirror that you saw:<br> Rays that have wander'd into Darkness wide<br> Return, and back into your Sun subside.'&#151;</p>
