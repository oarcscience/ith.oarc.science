### THE DEVIL

CHAPTER XV., Verse 29.—And when thy Lord said to the angels, "Verily, I
am creating a mortal from crackling clay of black mud wrought into
shape;

\(30\) "And when I have fashioned it, and breathed into it of my spirit,
then fall ye down before it, adoring."

And the angels adored all of them together, save Iblîs, who refused to
be among those who adored.

He said, "O Iblîs! what ails thee that thou art not among those who
adore?"

Said he, "I would not adore a mortal whom Thou hast created from
crackling clay of black mud wrought into form."

He said, "Then get thee forth therefrom, and, verily, thou art to be
pelted! (35) And, verily, the curse is upon thee until the day of
judgment."

Said he, "O my Lord! respite me until the day when they shall be
raised." He said, "Then, verily, thou art of the respited until the day
of the noted time."

He said, "O my Lord! for that Thou hast seduced me, I will surely make
it seem seemly for them on earth, and I will surely seduce them

all together; (40) save such of Thy servants amongst them as are
sincere." Said He, "This is a right way against Me. Verily, my servants
thou hast no authority over, save over those who follow thee of such as
are seduced; and, verily, Hell is promised to them all together!"
