### PRAYER

CHAPTER II., Verse 182.—When my servants ask thee concerning me, then,

So let them ask Me for an answer, and let them believe in me; haply they
may be directed aright.

Chapter IV., Verse 104.—But when ye have fulfilled your prayer, remember
God standing and sitting and lying on your sides; and when ye are in
safety then be steadfast in prayer; verily, prayer is for the believers
prescribed and timed!

Chapter VI., Verse 71.—Say, "Verily, God's guidance is the guidance, and
we are bidden to resign ourselves unto the Lord of the worlds, and be ye
steadfast in prayer and fear Him, for He it is to whom we shall be
gathered."

Chapter XIV., Verse 36.—Say to my servants who believe, that they be
steadfast in prayer.

and hold fast by God; He is your sovereign, and an excellent sovereign,
and an excellent help!

Chapter II., Verse 144.—From whencesoever thou comest forth, there turn
thy face towards the sacred mosque, for it is surely truth from thy
Lord; God is not careless about what ye do. (145) And from whencesoever
thou comest forth, there turn thy face towards the sacred mosque, and
wheresoever ye are, turn your faces towards it, that men may have no
argument against you, save only those of them who are unjust; and fear
them not, but fear Me and I will fulfil my favours to you, perchance ye
may be guided yet.

Chapter VII., Verse 29.—O sons of Adam! take your ornaments to every
mosque; and eat and drink, but do not be extravagant, for He loves not
the extravagant.
