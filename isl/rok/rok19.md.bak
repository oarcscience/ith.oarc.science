### MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE

CHAPTER IV., Verse 3.—Marry what seems good to you of women, by twos, or
threes, or fours; and if ye fear that ye cannot be equitable, then only
one, or what your right hands possess. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md) That keeps you nearer to not being partial.

Chapter XXXIII., Verse 49.—O thou prophet! verily we make lawful for
thee thy wives to whom thou hast given their hire (i.e. dowry), and what
thy right hand possesses out of the booty that God has granted thee.

Chapter II., Verse 226.—Those who swear off from their women they must
wait four months; but if they break their vow God is forgiving and
merciful.

And if they intend to divorce them, verily, God hears and knows.

Divorce (may happen) twice; then keep them in reason, or let them go
with kindness. It is not lawful for you to take from them anything of
what you have given them, unless both fear that they cannot keep within
God's bounds.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

(230).—But if he divorce her (a third time) she shall not be lawful to
him after that, until she marry another husband; but if he divorce her
too, it is no crime in them both to come together again, if they think
that they can keep within God's bounds. These are God's bounds which He
explains to a people who know.

When ye divorce women, and they have reached the prescribed time, then
keep them kindly, or let them go in reason, but do not keep them by
force to transgress; for whoso does that, he is unjust to his own soul.

It is no crime in you if ye divorce your women ere ye have yet touched
them, or settled for them a settlement. But provide maintenance for
them—the wealthy according to his power, and the straitened in
circumstances according to his power, must provide in reason; a duty
this upon the kind.

And if ye divorce them before ye have touched them, but have already
settled for them a settlement, the half of what ye have settled, unless
they remit it, or he in whose hand is the marriage tie remits it; and
that ye should remit is nearer to piety, and forget not liberality
between you. Verily, God on what ye do doth look.

And divorced women should have a maintenance in reason—a duty this on
those that fear.

Chapter IV., Verse 24.—But if ye wish to exchange one wife for another,
and have given one of them a talent, then take not from it anything.

Chapter XXXIII., Verse 46.—O ye who believe!

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

when ye wed believing women, and then divorce them before ye have
touched them, ye have no term that ye need observe; so make them some
provision, and let them go handsomely at large.

Chapter LXV., Verse 2.—And when they have reached their appointed time,
then retain them with kindness, or separate from them with kindness; and
bring as witnesses men of equity from among you; and give upright
testimony to God. That is what He admonishes him who believes in God and
the last day; and whosoever fears God, He will make for him a (happy)
issue, and will provide for him from whence he reckoned not.
