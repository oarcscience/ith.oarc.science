### GENII OR JINNS

CHAPTER VI., Verse 112.—So have we made for every prophet an
enemy—devils of men and jinns; some of them inspire others with specious
speech to lead astray; but had thy Lord pleased, they would not have
done it; so leave them with what they do devise.

… Verse 127.—And on the day when He shall gather them all together, "O
assembly of the jinns! ye have got much out of mankind!" And their
clients from among mankind shall say; "O our Lord! much advantage had we
one from another; but we reached our appointed time which thou hadst
appointed for us." Says He, "The fire is your resort, to dwell therein
for aye! save what God pleases; verily, thy Lord is wise and knowing."

Chapter XI., Verse 120.—"I will surely fill Hell with jinns and mankind
altogether."

Chapter XV., Verse 28.—And the jinns had we created before of smokeless
fire.

Chapter LI., Verse 55.—And I have not created the jinn and mankind save
that they may worship Me.

I do not desire any provision from them, and I do not wish them to feed
Me.

Chapter LXXII., Verse 1.—In the name of the Merciful and Compassionate
God.

Say, "I have been inspired that there listened a company of the jinn,
and they said, "We have heard a marvellous Koran that guides to the
right direction; and we believe therein, and we join no one with our
Lord, for, verily, He—may the majesty of our Lord be exalted!—has taken
to Himself neither consort nor son.

"And, verily, a fool among us spake against God wide of the mark!

\(5\) "And we thought that men and jinn would never speak a lie against
God.

"And there are persons amongst men who seek for refuge with persons
amongst the jinn; but they increase them in their perverseness. And they
thought, as ye thought, that God would not raise up any one from the
dead.

"But we touched the heavens and found them filled with a mighty guard
and shooting-stars, and we did sit in certain seats thereof to listen;
but whoso of us listens now finds a shooting-star for him on guard.

\(10\) "And, verily, we know not whether evil be meant for those who are
in the earth, or if their Lord means right by them.

"And of us are some who are pious, and of us are some who are otherwise;
we are in separate bands.

"And we thought that we could not frustrate God in the earth, and could
not frustrate Him by flight.

"But, verily, when we heard the guidance we believed therein; and he who
believes in his Lord shall fear neither diminution nor loss.

"And, verily, of us are some who are Muslims, and of us some are
trespassers; but those of us who are Muslims, they strive after right
direction (15) and as for the trespassers they are fuel for Hell."
