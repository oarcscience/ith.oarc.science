<p>Soon as the Lord of Heav&#8217;n had sprung his Horse<br> Over the Horizon into the Blue Field,<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span> rose drunk with the Wine of Sleep,<br> And set himself a-stirrup for the Field;<br> He and a Troop of Princes&#8212;Kings in Blood,<br> Kings too in the Kingdom-troubling Tribe of Beauty,<br> All Young in Years and Courage, Bat in hand<br> Gallop&#8217;d a-field, toss&#8217;d down the Golden Ball<br> And chased, so many Crescent Moons a Full;<br> And, all alike Intent upon the Game,<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span> still would carry from them all<br> The Prize, and shouting "H&aacute;l!" drive Home the Ball.<br> This done, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span> bent him as a Bow<br> To Shooting&#8212;from the Marksmen of the World</p>  
<p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></A></p>  
<p>Call&#8217;d for an unstrung Bow&#8212;himself the Cord<br> Fitted unhelpt, and nimbly with his hand<br> Twanging made cry, and drew it to his Ear:<br> Then, fixing the Three-feather&#8217;d Fowl, discharged.<br> No point in Heaven's Azure but his Arrow<br> Hit; nay, but Heaven were made of Adamant,<br> Would overtake the Horizon as it roll&#8217;d;<br> And, whether aiming at the Fawn a-foot,<br> Or Bird on wing, his Arrow went away<br> Straight&#8212;like the Soul that cannot go astray.</p>  
<p>When Night came, that releases Man from Toil,<br> He play&#8217;d the Chess of Social Intercourse;<br> Prepared his Banquet Hall like Paradise,<br> Summon&#8217;d his Houri-faced Musicians,<br> And, when his Brain grew warm with Wine, the Veil<br> Flung off him of Reserve. Now Lip to Lip<br> Concerting with the Singer he would breathe<br> Like a Messias Life into the Dead;<br> Now made of the Melodious-moving Pipe<br> A Sugar-cane between his Lips that ran<br> Men's Ears with Sweetness: Taking up a Harp,<br> Between its dry String and his Finger fresh<br> Struck Fire; or lifting in his arms a Lute</p>  
<p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></A></p>  
<p>As if a little Child for Chastisement,<br> Pinching its Ear such Cries of Sorrow wrung<br> As drew Blood to the Eyes of Older Men.<br> Now sang He like the Nightingale alone,<br> Now set together Voice and Instrument;<br> And thus with his Associates Night he spent.</p>  
<p>His Soul rejoiced in Knowledge of all kinds;<br> The fine Edge of his Wit would split a Hair,<br> And in the Noose of Apprehension catch<br> A Meaning ere articulate in Word;<br> His Verse was like the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pleiads</span>; his Discourse<br> The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mourners of the Bier</span>; his Penmanship,<br> (Tablet and running Reed his Worshippers,)<br> Fine on the Lip of Youth as the First Hair,<br> Drove Penmen, as that Lovers, to Despair.</p>  
<p>His Bounty was as Ocean's&#8212;nay, the Sea's<br> Self but the Foam of his Munificence,<br> For it threw up the Shell, but he the Pearl;<br> He was a Cloud that rain&#8217;d upon the World<br> Dirhems for Drops; the Banquet of whose Bounty<br> Left H&aacute;tim's Churlish in Comparison&#8212;</p>
