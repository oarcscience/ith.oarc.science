### XX.

When by and bye <span class="smallcaps">The Shah</span> was made aware  
Of that Soul-wasting absence of his Son,  
He reach’d a Cry to Heav’n—his Eyelashes

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

Wept Blood—Search everywhere he set a-foot,  
But none could tell the hidden Mystery.  
Then bade he bring a Mirror that he had,  
A Mirror, like the Bosom of the Wise,  
Reflecting all the World, and lifting up  
The Veil from all its Secret, Good and Evil.  
That Mirror bade he bring, and, in its Face  
Looking, beheld the Face of his Desire.  
He saw those Lovers in the Solitude,  
Turn’d from the World, and all its ways, and People,  
And looking only in each other's Eyes,  
And never finding any Sorrow there.  
<span class="smallcaps">The Shah</span> beheld them as they were, and
Pity  
Fell on his Eyes, and he reproach’d them not;  
And, gathering all their Life into his hand,  
Not a Thread lost, disposed in Order all.  
Oh for the Noble Nature, and Clear Heart,  
That, seeing Two who draw one Breath, together  
Drinking the Cup of Happiness and Tears  
Unshatter’d by the Stone of Separation,  
Is loath their sweet Communion to destroy,  
Or cast a Tangle in the Skein of Joy.

The Arrows that assail the Lords of Sorrow  
Come from the Hand of Retribution.  
Do Well, that in thy Turn Well may betide Thee;

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

And turn from Ill, that Ill may turn beside Thee.

<span class="smallcaps">Firhád</span>, Moulder of the Mountain,  
Love-distracted look’d to <span class="smallcaps">Shírín</span>,  
And <span class="smallcaps">Shírín</span> the Sculptor's Passion  
Saw, and turn’d her Heart to Him.

Then the Fire of Jealous Frenzy  
Caught and carried up the Harvest  
Of the Might of <span class="smallcaps">Kai Khusrau</span>.

Plotting with that ancient Hag  
Of Fate, the Sculptor's Cup he poison’d,  
And remained the Lord of Love.

So—But Fate that Fate avenges  
Arms <span class="smallcaps">Shirúeh</span> with the Dagger,  
That at once from <span class="smallcaps">Shírín</span> tore him,  
Hurl’d him from the Throne of Glory.
