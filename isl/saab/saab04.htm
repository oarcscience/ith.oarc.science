<p>And yet how long, J&aacute;mi, in this Old House<br> Stringing thy Pearls upon a Harp of Song?<br> Year after Year striking up some new Song,<br> The Breath of some Old Story? Life is gone,<br> And yet the Song is not the Last; my Soul<br> Is spent&#8212;and still a Story to be told!<br> And I, whose Back is crook&eacute;d as the Harp<br> I still keep tuning through the Night till Day!<br> That Harp untun&#8217;d by Time&#8212;the Harper's hand<br> Shaking with Age&#8212;how shall the Harper's hand<br> Repair its cunning, and the sweet old Harp<br> Be modulated as of old? Methinks<br> &#8217;Tis time to break and cast it in the Fire;<br> Yea, sweet the Harp that can be sweet no more,<br> To cast it in the Fire&#8212;the vain old Harp<br> That can no more sound Sweetness to the Ear,<br> But burn&#8217;d may breathe sweet Attar to the Soul,<br> And comfort so the Faith and Intellect,<br> Now that the Body looks to Dissolution.<br> My Teeth fall out&#8212;my two Eyes see no more<br> Till by Feringhi Glasses turn&#8217;d to Four;<br> Pain sits with me sitting behind my knees,</p>

<p>From which I hardly rise unhelpt of hand;<br> I bow down to my Root, and like a Child<br> Yearn, as is likely, to my Mother Earth,<br> With whom I soon shall cease to moan and weep,<br> And on my Mother's Bosom fall asleep.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>The House in Ruin, and its Music heard<br> No more within, nor at the Door of Speech,<br> Better in Silence and Oblivion<br> To fold me Head and Foot, remembering<br> What that <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Beloved</span> to the Master whisper&#8217;d:&#8212;<br> "No longer think of Rhyme, but think of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Me</span>!"&#8212;<br> Of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Whom</span>?&#8212;of Him whose Palace <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Soul</span> is,<br> And Treasure-House&#8212;who notices and knows<br> Its Income and Out-going, and <i>then</i> comes<br> To fill it when the Stranger is departed.<br> Whose Shadow being <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kings</span>&#8212;whose Attributes<br> The Type of Theirs&#8212;their Wrath and Favour His<br> Lo! in the Celebration of His Glory.<br> The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">King</span> Himself come on me unaware,<br> And suddenly arrests me for his own.<br> Wherefore once more I take&#8212;best quitted else<br> The Field of Verse, to chaunt that double Praise,<br> And in that Memory refresh my Soul<br> Until I grasp the Skirt of Living Presence.</p>
