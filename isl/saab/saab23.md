*Salaman and Absal*, by Jami, tr. Edward Fitzgerald, \[1904\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XXI.

But as the days went on, and still <span class="smallcaps">The
Shah</span>  
Beheld <span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> how sunk in <span
class="smallcaps">Absál</span>,  
And yet no Hand of better Effort lifted;  
But still the Crown that shall adorn his Head,  
And still the Throne that waited for his Foot,  
Trampled from Memory by a Base Desire,  
Of which the Soul was still unsatisfied—  
Then from the Sorrow of <span class="smallcaps">The Shah</span> fell
Fire;  
To Gracelessness Ungracious he became,  
And, quite to shatter his rebellious Lust,  
Upon <span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> all his <span
class="smallcaps">Will</span> discharged.  
And Lo! <span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> to his Mistress turn’d,  
But could not reach her—look’d and look’d again,  
And palpitated tow'rd her—but in Vain!

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

Oh Misery! what to the Bankrupt worse  
Than Gold he cannot reach! To one Athirst  
Than Fountain to the Eye and Lip forbid!—  
Or than Heaven opened to the Eyes in Hell!—  
Yet, when <span class="smallcaps">Salámán's</span> Anguish was
extreme,  
The Door of Mercy open’d in his Face;  
He saw and knew his Father's Hand outstretcht  
To lift him from Perdition—timidly,  
Timidly tow'rd his Father's Face his own  
He lifted, Pardon-pleading, Crime-contest,  
As the stray Bird one day will find her Nest.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A Disciple ask’d a Master,  
"By what Token should a Father  
"Vouch for his reputed Son?"  
Said the Master, "By the Stripling,  
"Howsoever Late or Early,  
"Like to the reputed Father  
"Growing—whether Wise or Foolish."

"Lo the disregarded Darnel  
"With itself adorns the Wheat-field,  
"And for all the Early Season  
"Satisfies the Farmer's Eye;  
"But come once the Hour of Harvest,  
"And another Grain shall answer,  
"'Darnel and no Wheat, am I.'"
