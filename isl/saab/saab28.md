### XXVI.

Then <span class="smallcaps">The Sage</span> counsell’d, and <span
class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> heard,  
And drew the Wisdom down into his Heart;  
And, sitting in the Shadow of the Perfect,  
His Soul found Quiet under; sweet it seem’d,  
Sweeping the Chaff and Litter from his own,  
To be the very Dust of Wisdom's Door,  
Slave of the Firmán of the Lord of Life.  
Then <span class="smallcaps">The Sage</span> marvell’d at his
Towardness,  
And wrought in Miracle in his behalf.  
He pour’d the Wine of Wisdom in his Cup,  
He laid the Dew of Peace upon his lips;  
And when Old Love return’d to Memory,  
And broke in Passion from his Lips, <span class="smallcaps">The
Sage</span>,  
Under whose waxing <span class="smallcaps">Will</span> Existence rose  
Responsive, and, relaxing, waned again,  
Raising a Fantom Image of <span class="smallcaps">Absál</span>,  
Set it awhile before <span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span>'s Eyes,  
Till, having sow’d the Seed of Quiet there,  
It went again down to Annihilation.  
But ever, for the Sum of his Discourse,  
<span class="smallcaps">The Sage</span> would tell of a Celestial
Love;  
"<span class="smallcaps">Zuhrah</span>," he said, "the Lustre of the
Stars  
"'Fore whom the Beauty of the Brightest wanes;

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

"Who were she to reveal her perfect Beauty,  
"The Sun and Moon would craze; <span class="smallcaps">Zuhrah</span>,"
he said,  
"The Sweetness of the Banquet—none in Song  
"Like Her—her Harp filling the Ear of Heaven,  
"That Dervish-dances at her Harmony."  
<span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> listen’d, and inclin’d—again  
Repeated, Inclination ever grew;  
Until <span class="smallcaps">The Sage</span> beholding in his Soul  
The <span class="smallcaps">Spirit</span> quicken, so effectually  
With <span class="smallcaps">Zuhrah</span> wrought, that she reveal’d
herself  
In her pure Beauty to <span class="smallcaps">Salámán's</span> Soul,  
And washing <span class="smallcaps">Absál's</span> Image from his
Breast,  
There reign’d instead. Celestial Beauty seen,  
He left the Earthly; and, once come to know  
Eternal Love, he let the Mortal go.
