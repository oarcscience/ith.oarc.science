*Salaman and Absal*, by Jami, tr. Edward Fitzgerald, \[1904\], at

### XIII.

While a Full Year was counted by the Moon,  
<span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Absál</span> rejoiced together,  
And for so long he stood not in the face  
Of <span class="smallcaps">Sage</span> or <span
class="smallcaps">Shah</span>, and their bereavéd Hearts  
Were torn in twain with the Desire of Him.  
They question’d those about him, and from them  
Heard something; then Himself in Presence summon’d,

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

And, subtly sifting on all sides, so plied  
Interrogation till it hit the Mark,  
And all the Truth was told. Then <span class="smallcaps">Sage</span> and
<span class="smallcaps">Shah</span>  
Struck out with Hand and Foot in his Redress.  
And First with <span class="smallcaps">Reason</span>, which is also
Best;  
<span class="smallcaps">Reason</span> that rights the
Retrograde—completes  
The Imperfect—<span class="smallcaps">Reason</span> that unties the
Knot:  
For <span class="smallcaps">Reason</span> is the Fountain from of old  
From which the Prophets drew, and none beside.  
Who boasts of other Inspiration lies—  
There are no other Prophets than <span class="smallcaps">The
Wise</span>.
