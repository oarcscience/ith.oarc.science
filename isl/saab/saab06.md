### IV.

### THE STORY.

<span class="smallcaps">A Shah</span> there was who ruled the Realm of
Yún,  
And wore the Ring of Empire of Sikander;  
And in his Reign <span class="smallcaps">A Sage</span>, who had the
Tower  
Of Wisdom of so strong Foundation built  
That Wise Men from all Quarters of the World  
To catch the Word of Wisdom from his Lip  
Went in a Girdle round him.—Which <span class="smallcaps">The
Shah</span>  
Observing, took him to his Secresy;

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

Stirr’d not a Step nor set Design afoot  
Without that Sage's sanction; till, so counsel’d,  
From Káf to Káf reach’d his Dominion:  
No Nation of the World or Nation's Chief  
Who wore the Ring but under span of his  
Bow’d down the Neck; then rising up in Peace  
Under his Justice grew, and knew no Wrong,  
And in their Strength was his Dominion Strong.

The <span class="smallcaps">Shah</span> that has not Wisdom in
Himself,  
Nor has a Wise Man for his Counsellor,  
The Wand of his Authority falls short,  
And his Dominion crumbles at the Base.  
For he, discerning not the Characters  
Of Tyranny and Justice, confounds both,  
Making the World a Desert, and the Fount  
Of Justice a Seráb. Well was is said,  
"*Better just Káfir than Believing Tyrant*."

<span class="small">God said to the Prophet David,—  
"David, speak, and to the Challenge  
"Answer of the Faith within Thee.  
a Even Unbelieving Princes,  
"Ill-reported if Unworthy,  
"Yet, if They be Just and Righteous,  
"Were their Worship of <span class="smallcaps">The Fire</span>—  
"Even These unto Themselves  
"Reap glory and redress the World."</span>
