<p>Now was <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span> in his Prime of Growth,<br> His Cypress Stature risen to high Top,<br> And the new-blooming Garden of his Beauty<br> Began to bear; and Abs&aacute;l long&#8217;d to gather;<br> But the Fruit grew upon too high a Bough,<br> To which the Noose of her Desire was short.<br> She too rejoiced in Beauty of her own<br> No whit behind <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span>, whom she now<br> Began enticing with her Sorcery.<br> Now from her Hair would twine a musky Chain,<br> To bind his Heart&#8212;now twist it into Curls<br> Nestling innumerable Temptations;<br> Doubled the Darkness of her Eyes with Surma<br> To make him lose his way, and over them<br> Adorn&#8217;d the Bows that were to shoot him then;<br> Now to the Rose-leaf of her Cheek would add<br> Fresh Rose, and then a Grain of Musk lay there,<br> The Bird of the Belov&eacute;d Heart to snare.</p>

<p>Now with a Laugh would break the Ruby Seal<br> That lockt up Pearl; or busied in the Room<br> Would smite her Hand perhaps&#8212;on that pretence<br> To lift and show the Silver in her Sleeve;<br> Or hastily rising clash her Golden Anclets<br> To draw the Crown&eacute;d Head under her Feet.<br> Thus by innumerable Bridal wiles<br> She went about soliciting his Eyes,<br> Which she would scarce let lose her for a Moment;<br> For well she knew that mainly by <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Eye</span><br> Love makes his Sign, and by no other Road<br> Enters and takes possession of the Heart.</p>
