### XXIII.

Ah the poor Lover!—In the changing Hands  
Of Day and Night no wretcheder than He!  
No Arrow from the Bow of Evil Fate  
But reaches him—one Dagger at his Throat,  
Another comes to wound him from behind.  
Wounded by Love—then wounded by Reproof  
Of Loving—and, scarce stauncht the Blood of Shame  
By flying from his Love—then, worst of all,  
Love's back-blow of Revenge for having fled!

<span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> heard—he rent the Robe of Peace  
He came to loathe his Life, and long for Death,

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

(For better Death itself than Life in Death)  
He turn’d his face with <span class="smallcaps">Absál</span> to the
Desert—  
Enter’d the deadly Plain; Branch upon Branch  
Cut down, and gather’d in a lofty Pile,  
And fired. They look’d upon the Flames, those Two  
They look’d, and they rejoiced; and hand in hand  
They sprang into the Fire. <span class="smallcaps">The Shah</span> who
saw,  
In secret all had order’d; and the Flame,  
Directed by his Self-fulfilling <span class="smallcaps">Will</span>,  
Devouring utterly <span class="smallcaps">Absál</span>, pass’d by  
<span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> harmless—the pure Gold return’d  
Entire, but all the baser Metal burn’d.
