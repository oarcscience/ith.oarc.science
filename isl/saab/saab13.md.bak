### XI.

Thus day by day did <span class="smallcaps">Absál</span> tempt <span
class="smallcaps">Salámán</span>,  
And by and bye her Wiles began to work.  
Her Eyes Narcissus stole his Sleep—their Lashes  
Pierc’d to his Heart—out from her Locks a Snake  
Bit him—and bitter, bitter on his Tongue  
Became the Memory of her honey Lip.  
He saw the Ringlet restless on her Cheek,  
And he too quiver’d with Desire; his Tears  
Turn’d Crimson from her Cheek, whose musky spot  
Infected all his soul with Melancholy.  
Love drew him from behind the Veil, where yet  
Withheld him better Resolution-  
"Oh, should the Food I long for, tasted, turn  
"Unwholesome, and if all my Life to come  
"Should sicken from one momentary Sweet!"

<span class="small">On the Sea-shore sat a Raven,  
Blind, and from the bitter Cistern  
Forc’d his only Drink to draw.  
Suddenly the Pelican  
Flying over Fortune's Shadow  
Cast upon his Head, and calling—  
"Come, poor Son of Salt, and taste of  
Sweet, sweet Water from my Maw."  
Said the Raven, "If I taste it  
Once, the Salt I have to live on  
May for ever turn to Loathing;  
And I sit a Bird accurst  
Upon the Shore to die of Thirst."</span>
