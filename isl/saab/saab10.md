### VIII.

Soon as the Lord of Heav’n had sprung his Horse  
Over the Horizon into the Blue Field,  
<span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> rose drunk with the Wine of
Sleep,  
And set himself a-stirrup for the Field;  
He and a Troop of Princes—Kings in Blood,  
Kings too in the Kingdom-troubling Tribe of Beauty,  
All Young in Years and Courage, Bat in hand  
Gallop’d a-field, toss’d down the Golden Ball  
And chased, so many Crescent Moons a Full;  
And, all alike Intent upon the Game,  
<span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> still would carry from them all  
The Prize, and shouting "Hál!" drive Home the Ball.  
This done, <span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> bent him as a Bow  
To Shooting—from the Marksmen of the World

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

Call’d for an unstrung Bow—himself the Cord  
Fitted unhelpt, and nimbly with his hand  
Twanging made cry, and drew it to his Ear:  
Then, fixing the Three-feather’d Fowl, discharged.  
No point in Heaven's Azure but his Arrow  
Hit; nay, but Heaven were made of Adamant,  
Would overtake the Horizon as it roll’d;  
And, whether aiming at the Fawn a-foot,  
Or Bird on wing, his Arrow went away  
Straight—like the Soul that cannot go astray.

When Night came, that releases Man from Toil,  
He play’d the Chess of Social Intercourse;  
Prepared his Banquet Hall like Paradise,  
Summon’d his Houri-faced Musicians,  
And, when his Brain grew warm with Wine, the Veil  
Flung off him of Reserve. Now Lip to Lip  
Concerting with the Singer he would breathe  
Like a Messias Life into the Dead;  
Now made of the Melodious-moving Pipe  
A Sugar-cane between his Lips that ran  
Men's Ears with Sweetness: Taking up a Harp,  
Between its dry String and his Finger fresh  
Struck Fire; or lifting in his arms a Lute

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

As if a little Child for Chastisement,  
Pinching its Ear such Cries of Sorrow wrung  
As drew Blood to the Eyes of Older Men.  
Now sang He like the Nightingale alone,  
Now set together Voice and Instrument;  
And thus with his Associates Night he spent.

His Soul rejoiced in Knowledge of all kinds;  
The fine Edge of his Wit would split a Hair,  
And in the Noose of Apprehension catch  
A Meaning ere articulate in Word;  
His Verse was like the <span class="smallcaps">Pleiads</span>; his
Discourse  
The <span class="smallcaps">Mourners of the Bier</span>; his
Penmanship,  
(Tablet and running Reed his Worshippers,)  
Fine on the Lip of Youth as the First Hair,  
Drove Penmen, as that Lovers, to Despair.

His Bounty was as Ocean's—nay, the Sea's  
Self but the Foam of his Munificence,  
For it threw up the Shell, but he the Pearl;  
He was a Cloud that rain’d upon the World  
Dirhems for Drops; the Banquet of whose Bounty  
Left Hátim's Churlish in Comparison—
