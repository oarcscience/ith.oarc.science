### XII.

Now when <span class="smallcaps">Salámán's</span> Heart turn’d to <span
class="smallcaps">Absál</span>,  
Her Star was happy in the Heavens—Old Love  
Put forth afresh—Desire doubled his Bond:  
And of the running Time she watch’d an Hour  
To creep into the Mansion of her Moon  
And satiate her soul upon his Lips.  
And the Hour came; she stole into his Chamber  
Ran up to him, Life's offer in her Hand—  
And, falling like a Shadow at his Feet,  
She laid her Face beneath. <span class="smallcaps">Salámán</span> then  
With all the Courtesies of Princely Grace  
Put forth his Hand—he rais’d her in his Arms  
He held her trembling there—and from that Fount  
Drew first Desire; then Deeper from her Lips,  
That, yielding, mutually drew from his  
A Wine that ever drawn from never fail’d—

So through the Day—so through another still—  
The Day became a Seventh—the Seventh a Moon—  
The Moon a Year—while they rejoiced together,  
Thinking their Pleasure never was to end.

But rolling Heaven whisper’d from his Ambush,  
"So in my License is it not set down.  
"Ah for the sweet Societies I make  
"At Morning and before the Nightfall break;  
"Ah for the Bliss that with the Setting Sun  
"I mix, and, with his Rising, all is done!"

<span class="small">Into Bagdad came a hungry  
Arab—after many days of waiting  
In to the Khalífah's Supper  
Push’d, and got before a Pasty  
Luscious as the Lip of Beauty,  
Or the Tongue of Eloquence.  
Soon as seen, Indecent Hunger  
Seizes up and swallows down;  
Then his mouth undaunted wiping—  
"Oh Khalífah, hear me Swear,  
"Not of any other Pasty  
"Than of Thine to sup or dine."  
The Khalífah laugh’d and answer’d;  
"Fool! who thinkest to determine  
"What is in the Hands of Fate—  
"Take and thrust him from the Gate!"</span>
