<p>Six days <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span> on the Camel rode,<br> And then Remembrance of foregone Reproach<br> Abode not by him; and upon the Seventh<br> He halted on the Seashore, and beheld<br> An Ocean boundless as the Heaven above,<br> That, reaching its Circumference from K&aacute;f<br> To K&aacute;f, down to the Back of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gau</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mani</span><br> Descended, and its Stars were Creatures&#8217; Eyes.<br> The Face of it was as it were a Range<br> Of moving Mountains; or as endless Hosts<br> Of Camels trooping from all Quarters up,<br> Furious, with the Foam upon their Lips.<br> In it innumerable glittering Fish<br> Like Jewels polish-sharp, to the sharp Eye<br> But for an Instant visible, glancing through<br> As Silver Scissors slice a blue Brocade;<br> Though were the Dragon from its Hollow roused,<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Dragon</span> of the Stars would stare Aghast.<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span> eyed the Sea, and cast about<br> To cross it&#8212;and forthwith upon the Shore<br> Devis&#8217;d a Shallop like a Crescent Moon,<br> Wherein that Sun and Moon in happy Hour<br> Enter&#8217;d as into some Celestial Sign;<br> That, figured like a Bow, but Arrow-like<br> In Flight, was feather&#8217;d with a little Sail,<br> And, pitcht upon the Water like a Duck,<br> So with her Bosom sped to her Desire.</p>

<p>When they had sail&#8217;d their Vessel for a Moon,<br> And marr&#8217;d their Beauty with the wind o&#8217; th&#8217; Sea,<br> Suddenly in mid Sea reveal&#8217;d itself<br> An Isle, beyond Description beautiful;<br> An Isle that all was Garden; not a Bird<br> Of Note or Plume in all the World but there;<br> There as in Bridal Retinue array&#8217;d<br> The Pheasant in his Crown, the Dove in her Collar;<br> And those who tuned their Bills among the Trees<br> That Arm in Arm from Fingers paralyz&#8217;d<br> With any Breath of Air Fruit moist and dry<br> Down scatter&#8217;d in Profusion to their Feet,<br> Where Fountains of Sweet Water ran, and round<br> Sunshine and Shadow chequer-chased the Ground.<br> Here Iram Garden seem&#8217;d in Secresy<br> Blowing the Rosebud of its Revelation;<br> Or Paradise, forgetful of the Day<br> Of Audit, lifted from her Face the Veil.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n</span> saw the Isle, and thought no more<br> Of Further&#8212;there with <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abs&aacute;l</span>, he sat down,<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abs&aacute;l</span> and He together side by side<br> Rejoicing like the Lily and the Rose,<br> Together like the Body and the Soul.<br> Under its Trees in one another's Arms<br> They slept&#8212;they drank its Fountains hand in hand&#8212;</p>

<p>Sought Sugar with the Parrot&#8212;or in Sport<br> Paraded with the Peacock&#8212;raced the Partridge<br> Or fell a-talking with the Nightingale.<br> There was the Rose without a Thorn, and there<br> The Treasure and no Serpent to beware&#8212;<br> What sweeter than your Mistress at your side<br> In such a Solitude, and none to Chide!</p>
