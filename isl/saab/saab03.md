# SALÁMÁN AND ABSÁL

### I.

### PROLOGUE.

Oh Thou whose Memory quickens Lovers’ Souls,  
Whose Fount of Joy renews the Lover's Tongue,  
Thy Shadow falls across the World, and They  
Bow down to it; and of the Rich in Beauty  
Thou art the Riches that make Lovers mad.  
Not till thy Secret Beauty through the Cheek  
Of <span class="smallcaps">Laila</span> smite does she inflame <span
class="smallcaps">Majnún</span>,  
And not till Thou have sugar’d <span class="smallcaps">Shírín's</span>
Lip  
The Hearts of those Two Lovers fill with Blood.  
For Lov’d and Lover are not but by Thee,  
Nor Beauty;—Mortal Beauty but the Veil  
Thy Heavenly hides behind, and from itself  
Feeds, and our Hearts yearn after as a Bride  
That glances past us Veil’d—but ever so  
As none the Beauty from the Veil may know.  
How long wilt thou continue thus the World  
To cozen with the Fantom of a Veil

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

From which Thou only peepest?—Time it is  
To unfold thy perfect Beauty. I would be  
Thy Lover, and Thine only—I, mine Eyes  
Seal’d in the Light of Thee to all but Thee,  
Yea, in the Revelation of Thyself  
Self-Lost, and Conscience-quit of Good and Evil.  
Thou movest under all the Forms of Truth,  
Under the Forms of all Created Things;  
Look whence I will, still nothing I discern  
But Thee in all the Universe, in which  
Thyself Thou dost invest, and through the Eyes  
Of <span class="smallcaps">Man</span>, the subtle Censor scrutinize.  
To thy Harím <span class="smallcaps">Dividuality</span>  
No Entrance finds—no Word of <span class="smallcaps">This</span> and
<span class="smallcaps">That</span>;  
Do Thou my separate and Derivéd Self  
Make one with thy Essential! Leave me room  
On that Diván which leaves no Room for Two;  
Lest, like the Simple Kurd of whom they tell,  
I grow perplext, Oh God! ’twixt "I" and "<span
class="smallcaps">Thou</span>;"  
If I—this Dignity and Wisdom whence?  
If <span class="smallcaps">Thou</span>—then what this abject Impotence?

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">A Kurd perplext by Fortune's Frolics  
Left his Desert for the City.  
Sees a City full of Noise and  
Clamour, agitated People,  
Hither, Thither, Back and Forward  
Running, some intent on Travel,  
Others home again returning,  
Right to Left, and Left to Right,  
Life-disquiet everywhere!  
Kurd, when he beholds the Turmoil,  
Creeps aside, and, Travel-weary,  
Fain would go to Sleep; "But," saith he,  
"How shall I in all this Hubbub  
"Know myself again on waking?"  
So by way of Recognition  
Ties a Pumpkin round his Foot,  
And turns to Sleep. A Knave that heard him  
Crept behind, and slily watching  
Slips the Pumpkin off the Sleeper's  
Ancle, ties it round his own,  
And so down to sleep beside him.  
By and by the Kurd awaking  
Looks directly for his Signal—  
Sees it on another's Ancle—  
Cries aloud, "Oh Good-for-Nothing  
"Rascal to perplex me so!  
"That by you I am bewilder’d,  
"Whether I be I or no!  
"If I—the Pumpkin why on <span class="smallcaps">You</span>?  
"If <span class="smallcaps">You</span>—then Where am I, and <span
class="smallcaps">Who</span>?"</span>

</div>

Oh God! this poor bewilder’d Kurd am I,  
Than any Kurd more helpless!—Oh, do thou  
Strike down a Ray of Light into my Darkness!  
Turn by thy Grace these Dregs into pure Wine,  
To recreate the Spirits of the Good!  
Or if not that, yet, as the little Cup  
Whose Name I go by, not unworthy found  
To pass thy salutary Vintage round!
