### INTRODUCTION

#### CHARACTERS OF ALFARABI'S PHILOSOPHY

Alfarabi is a Neo-Platonist inasmuch as his mystic tendencies are
numerous in his Metaphysics, Psychology and Political thought. As a
Neo-Platonist, he follows the groundwork of the Neo-Platonic doctrine
made of religious Mysticism and Emanatist Monism. Thus, Alfarabi's
philosophy is entirely theocentric in the sense that it holds God as the
center of the universe. God is One; this One is the Absolute which
transcends everything. From the One flows the plurality of things
gradually coming down the scale of perfection to the existence of
matter. The goal of man is to return to God. This return is to be
accomplished by virtue and philosophical thought.

Like the Neo-Platonists, Alfarabi holds in his treatise on *The
Agreement Between Plato and Aristotle*, that there is no essential
difference between the philosophy of Plato and that of Aristotle. <span

the reconciliation of Plato and Aristotle may be regarded as the
outstanding features which make Alfarabi's philosophy depend on

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

that of Plotinus. But outside of these Neo-Platonic features, all the
philosophy of Alfarabi may he said to be saturated with Aristotelism
which, by its empirical method, suited better his scientific mind.

#### WHAT MUST PRECEDE THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY

Alfarabi lays down several rules for teachers honestly striving to train
youth in philosophy. No youth should start the study of philosophy
before he is well acquainted with the natural sciences. For, human
nature requires a gradual rise from the imperfect to the perfect.
Mathematics is a very important subject in training the mind of the
young philosopher because it helps him pass easily from the sensible to
the intelligible, and also because it familiarizes his mind with exact
demonstrations. <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)

The study of Logic, as an instrument to distinguish the true from the
false, is of great educational value before beginning the study of
philosophy proper. <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md)

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

The training of one's own character, instincts and tendencies must come
before entering into philosophy, for unless that is done, the chances
are that the student will never fully grasp the higher and more solid
truths, because his mind is still clouded by sensibility. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md)

Philosophy is studied primarily to obtain a knowledge of God as the
Creator and Efficient Cause of all things, the One, Immovable. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md)

The student of philosophy must be instructed in the sources from which
the different philosophies take their names. For example, he should be
told that some philosophies derive their names from the manner in which
they are taught, such as the philosophy of Peripateticism, which was
discussed with students while walking up and down a garden. He should be
taught that other philosophies take their names from the author, such as
Platonism from Plato and Aristotelism from Aristotle; and that others
take their names from the goal they propose, such as Epicurism, setting
pleasure as an end. <span id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md)

In teaching, two extremes must be avoided. The teacher must be neither
excessively strict nor excessively lenient. For, if he is too strict he
errs through excess and if he is too lenient, he errs through defect. If
the teacher becomes unpopular be-cause of his severity, his excessive
leniency will also tend to make him unworthy of respect. The teacher,
therefore, should avoid excess as well as defect. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md)

The young man must be persuaded to persevere in the study of philosophy
by calling his attention now and then to the old Arabic saying, "The
drop wears away the stone",--"Gutta cavat lapidem". <span
id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md)

The teacher should see that his student attends only to one

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

thing at a time. For, only one thing can be well mastered at a time. The
reason for this rule is to have the student concentrate his attention
upon the object of study and make a success of it. <span
id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md)

#### DEFINITION AND DIVISION OF PHILOSOPHY

For Alfarabi, philosophy is nothing else than thought, that is, the
science of concepts. The end of philosophy is to know God as the Creator
of heaven and earth.

Alfarabi's philosophy can be divided into Logic, Theoretical philosophy
and Practical philosophy. The Theoretical could be subdivided into
Metaphysics and Psychology, while the Practical philosophy into Ethics
and Politics.

I LOGIC

II THEORETICAL

                  --Metaphysics

                  --Psychology

III PRACTICAL

                  --Ethics

                  --Politics

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[xiii:1](palf05.htm#fr_0.md) Alfarabi, *On The
Agreement Between Plato and Aristotle*, in Collection of various
treatises. Arabic ed. Cairo 1907. Muhammad Ismail, pp. 1-39.

The main theories of Plato and Aristotle that need to be reconciled are
the following:

a\) Some thought that a world of difference existed between Plato and
Aristotle, because Plato, in his *Timaeus*, says that the noblest
substance is the nearest to the soul and intellect, and therefore the
farthest from the senses. Aristotle, on the other hand, says that the
noblest substance is the individual (first substance). Here the
disagreement between Plato and Aristotle, in Alfarabi's mind, is not
real, because both of them speak of the same thing from a different
point of view. For Aristotle the individual is nobler in Logic, because
in Logic he sees beings lying in the region of the senses, and from them
he abstracts the universal, the rational, the intelligible. For Plato
the universal is nobler in Metaphysics, because there he sees beings
that cannot change and will not change. \[op. cit. pp. 8-10\]

b\) With regard to the theory of knowledge, Alfarabi interpreted the
Platonic hypothesis of reminiscence in an empiric sense. He says <span
id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span> that Aristotle proved in Analytics that our
ideas are acquired by means of the senses, and because of that, they are
by no means a reminiscence. Their formation, however, occurs so rapidly
and unconsciously that the soul comes to imagine it has had them all the
time, so that thinking of them would seem to the soul like recollecting
or remembering them. According to Alfarabi, Plato held the same opinion
when he said that to think is to recollect, for the person who thinks
tries to get at what experience has written on his mind, and once he
finds the object of his thought, then it looks to him as if he had
recollected. \[op. cit. pp 23-25\]

c\) Alfarabi does not agree with the opinion of his contemporaries, who
hold that Aristotle believed in the existence of the world *ab aeterno*,
while Plato did not. According to him, the true teaching of Aristotle
was that time is the measurement of the motion of the world, and
consequently, the product of motion. That explains why he was obliged to
believe that God created the world without time, and that time is the
result of the motion of the world. \[op. cit. pp. 26-27\]
