### CONCLUSION

After studying the philosophy of Alfarabi, one comes to three
conclusions; first, that Alfarabi brought about the first penetration of
Arabism into Hellenism and of Hellenism into Arabism.

Second, that Alfarabi exerted a great influence on medieval thinkers.
This is made clear by the fact that Albertus Magnus quotes Alfarabi, and
evidently he could not quote him unless he had known his writings.
Hence, the knowledge of the works of Alfarabi gave Albertus Magnus and
his pupil, St. Thomas, an opportunity to do some sifting in the sense
that they were enabled to throw out the theories that conflicted with
Christian teaching and take in at the same time those that appeared to
them as logically sound and reconcilable with Christianity.

Third, that Alfarabi improved many Aristotelian theories, solved many
problems till then unsolved, and enriched Scholasticism with new
philosophical terms, such as quiddity, a necessary being, a contingent
being, the speculative and practical intellects, etc.

We have considered the philosophy of Alfarabi under a three-fold aspect:
the philosophy of being (Metaphysics), the philosophy of thinking
(Psychology), and the philosophy of acting (Ethics).

In the philosophy of being, Alfarabi taught that the most universal
concept is being, which cannot be defined, nor re-solved into simpler
concepts. Hence, the simplicity of being of the Latin Schoolmen.

The problem of universals which occupied the minds of medieval thinkers
was solved by Alfarabi in the words: "Universale

est unum de multis et in multis." Hence, the traditional definition of
the universal, "Aptum praedicari de pluribus."

He also believed that the nature of reality is being in becoming, that
is, potentiality and actuality, substance and accident, essence and
existence, matter and form, cause and effect. Is all reality that way?
Certainly not. For, there is a reality which is beyond all change, and
this is God. In comparing the Theodicy of Alfarabi with that of St.
Thomas, we found that the latter depends on the former for the first
three arguments proving God's existence, and also for the way in which
God's nature is known (Via remotionis et eminentiae. )

Furthermore, Alfarabi, three hundred years before St. Thomas, taught in
clear and distinct words, that the essence and existence in created
things differ as different entities, while they are identical in God.
This means that the Saint who came out with the same theory three
hundred years later, must certainly have borrowed it from Alfarabi.

In the philosophy of thinking, he describes the history of our
speculative intellect. At first it is in potentiality to all things
intelligible. It passes from potentiality to act through the action or
illumination coming down from above, namely, the active intellect.

In the philosophy of acting, he shows how every human activity tends to
happiness. Happiness is the cause that prompts man to live in society,
thus creating the state. The model state is the universal state that
puts the whole world under one political organization.

In conclusion, there is a unity of thought throughout the philosophy of
Alfarabi, who spared no efforts to make the various parts of his
philosophical vision converge towards one living God, on Whom the one
and the many, being and becoming, are essentially dependent.
