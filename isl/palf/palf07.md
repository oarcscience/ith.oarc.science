# Part II. Theoretical Philosophy

### Chapter II

### METAPHYSICS

#### MEANING AND DIVISION

"Particular sciences," says Alfarabi, "restrict themselves to one or
several departments of being. For instance, physics is the science of
being as affected by physical properties. Mathematics is the science of
being which deals with quantities and numbers. Medicine is the science
of being insofar as it is healthy or sick. Metaphysics, however, knows
no such restrictions. Its field is all reality, namely, Being. And it is
all equally extensive with the concept of Being (One, True,
Good.)" <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22)

Metaphysics, in the opinion of Alfarabi, treats of things which are
separate from matter. In this connection he distinguishes two kinds of
immaterial: the first, *immaterial quoad esse* or immaterial beings,
such as God and the human soul, which exist without matter; and the
second, *immaterial quoad conceptum*, or concepts, such as substance,
accident, cause, quality, the content of which is free from all matter.

Metaphysics, insofar as it treats of immaterial concepts, of those
general notions in which matter is not included, may be called General
Metaphysics or Ontology, that is, the science of Being. And because it
treats of immaterial beings, it may be called Special Metaphysics. It
could then be divided into three parts: Metaphysical Theology, which
deals with God and His attributes; Metaphysical Cosmology, which treats
of the ultimate principles of the universe; and finally Metaphysical
Psychology, which treats of the human soul.

Since Alfarabi holds that immaterial may be *quoad esse* and *quoad
conceptum*, his whole metaphysical thought may be divided accordingly,
that is, into Ontology, Metaphysical Theology, Metaphysical Cosmology
and Metaphysical Psychology.

#### ONTOLOGY

#### UNIVERSALS

The mind, in all its operations, exerts the function of synthesizing the
many in the one. In fact, we cannot understand the meaning of a scene
presented to our senses unless we unite its parts into a perceived
whole. Perception is an act of the mind which involves synthesizing. The
act of imagination involves both analysis and synthesis in the sense
that nothing can be imagined without synthesizing the many in the one.
The act of judgment, whereby one thing is affirmed or denied of another,
cannot be had except by synthesizing both terms, subject and predicate,
in one act of comparison. Syllogism, too, is simply the synthesis of two
judgments in a third one. Of all these operations of the mind, the
concept, more than all others, represents the synthesizing function of
the mind, for the concept is by definition the apprehension of the one
in the many.

For Alfarabi the concept means exactly that and nothing more. "The
concept," he says, "has a content signifying the synthetic, the
universal, the one. The universal in reference to the particular is like
the genus and species in reference to individuals. The individuals,
called "First Substances," precede the universal, called "Second
Substances." The former alone have substantial existence, and because of
that, one is led to think that First Substances are more substances than
the Second Substances. On the other hand, the universal, being permanent
and subsistent, has more right to the name of substance than mortal
individuals." <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23)

"How do universals exist?" asks Alfarabi. "The universals

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

do not exist in act," he says, "that is, they are not things existing in
themselves, but they exist only in individuals, and their existence is
accidental in the sense that they are subject to the existence of
individuals. That does not mean, however, that universals are accidents,
but merely that their existence in act can take place only per
accident."

As to the definition of universals, Alfarabi says that "The universal is
*unum de multis et in multis* (the one found in many and affirmed of
many). The inference is that the universal has no existence apart from
the individual (non habet esse separatum a multis)." <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24) Here we must recall that Albertus Magnus
quotes the Alfarabian definition of the universal, a fact which proves
beyond all doubt that both he and his pupil, St. Thomas, were acquainted
with the writings of our philosopher. \[See Albertus Magnus, De praed.
II, 5\]

Some may ask, "Is the opinion of Alfarabi on the nature of universals
right or wrong?" I hold that it is right, because he believes that the
universal exists really in the individuals, and not in the manner in
which it is abstracted from individual characteristics. All Christian
philosophers in the Middle Ages maintained the same solution on the
question of the universals. In fact, St. Thomas writes: "Universalia non
habent esse in rerum natura ut sint universalia, sed solum secundum quod
sunt individuata." (*De Anima*, art. 1.) In another place he says:
"Universalia non sunt res subsistentes, sed habent esse solum in
singularibus." (*Contra Gentiles*, Lib. I, cap LXV).

I do not agree with Munk who thinks that all Arabian philosophers are
Nominalists concerning the question of universals. Alfarabi, for
example, is not a Nominalist, because he holds unequivocally that the
universal is blended with the individual. That some Arabian thinkers,
such as Moses Maimonides, are Nominalists, I admit: but that they all
are so, I cannot grant. \[See Munk, *Melanges de philosophic juive et
arabe*, Paris, 1859, A. Franck, p. 327\]

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

DESCRIPTION OF BEING

"The most universal concept," says Alfarabi, "is Being and what is
coextensive with Being itself (One, True, Good)." "Being cannot be
defined," he says, "for it is self-evident, fixed in the mind, precedes
all other concepts and is the simplest of all. It is the simplest,
because to define a concept is to analyze its content, and Being, having
the least content, resists all efforts to resolve it into simpler
thought elements. To try to define it by words serves only to make our
mind attentive and directed to it, and not to explain the concept which
is clearer than the words by which it is defined." He goes on to say
that "Just as in the demonstration of a proposition it is imperative
that the judgments be coordinated in order to arrive at an ultimate
judgment-principle, in like manner in the definition of a concept, it is
necessary that the concept be resolved into other simpler concepts until
one arrives at the simplest and most universal concept, which is
Being." <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25) Now, St. Thomas describes
Being in much the same way. Not only does he unfold the same ideas as
those of Alfarabi, but the suprising thing is that the ideas are couched
in exactly the same words as those of Alfarabi. A glance at the writings
of both Alfarabi and St. Thomas bears this out.

Here is what St. Thomas says about Being:

Illud autem quod primo intellectus concipit quasi notissimum, et in quo
omnes conceptiones resolvit, est ens. <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26)

In another place he says:

Videlicet, ens, unum, verum, bonum; quae re idem sunt, sed ratione
distinguuntur. Sicut enim in demonstrationibus resolvere oportet omnes
propositiones usque ad principia ipsa, ad quae necesse est stare
rationem, ita in apprehensione praedictorum oportet stare ad ens quod in
quolibet cognito naturaliter cognoscitur, sicut et principium in omnibus
propositionibus que sunt post principia. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27)

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

#### TRANSCENDENTAL PROPERTIES OF BEING

For Alfarabi ens, unum, verum et bonum convertuntur. By that he means
that the concept of Being coincides with that of unity, truth and
goodness, and that every being is one, true and good. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28)

#### DIVISION OF BEING INTO NECESSARY AND CONTINGENT

According to Alfarabi, *Necessary Being* is that which exists in itself
or that which cannot but exist. *Contingent Being* is that which
receives its being from another, and whose non-existence is
possible. <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29)

#### METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLES OF BEING POTENTIALITY AND ACTUALITY

*Potentiality* is the capability to exist. Every created being, before
it existed, had only a possibility to exist: it was in potentiality.
*Actuality* is that which exists in reality. That which is in act is
perfect, and that which is in *potentiality* is imperfect. Potentiality
and actuality constitute the nature of reality, which means that reality
is being in becoming. This theory of potentiality and actuality is the
central point in Metaphysics, toward which substance and accident,
essence and existence, matter and form converge, and upon which their
own value depends.

A thing, though actual at any given moment, is in potentiality in
respect to future modifications. Hence, *substance* and *accident*.
*Substance* is that which exists in itself and is the foundation of
certain accidents or accidental differences. Its fundamental
characteristic is to exist in itself and not in another as its
subject. <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30) *Accident* is that which
needs a subject in which

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

and by which it may exist. For example, a coat is a substance, because
it exists in itself; white or black are accidents, because they do not
exist without a substance in which they may inhere. <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31)

In every created being there are two constituent principles, *essence*
and *existence*, which are conceived as actuality and potentiality
respectively. *Essence* is the reason why a thing is what it is.
*Existence* is the actuality of essence. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32)

To the question, "What is the nature of the distinction between essence
and existence in created substances?" Alfarabi replies that "A real
distinction occurs here and that existence is one thing and essence is
another. If essence and existence were one thing, then we should be
unable to conceive the one without conceiving the other. But, in fact,
we are able to conceive essence in itself. If it is true that man has
existence by essence, this would be like saying that to conceive man's
essence is to imply his existence." He continues with the same idea
saying that "If existence should enter into composition with the essence
of man like one entering into the essence of two, this would mean that
it is impossible to conceive perfectly the essence of man without his
existence as a part of the essence. Just as the essence of two would be
destroyed by taking away a unity from it, so would the essence of man be
destroyed by taking away existence from it. But this is not true,
because existence does not enter into composition with the essence of a
thing, for it is possible to understand the essence of man, and not to
know whether it exists in reality. On the other hand, if there was no
distinction between essence and existence in created beings, then these
could be said to exist by their essence. But there is one being alone
whose essence is His very existence, and that is God. <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33)

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

The distinction between essence and existence in. all created beings is
brought in by Alfarabi to differentiate these substances from God, Who
is absolutely simple and pure act. It reveals the true genius of
Alfarabi, from whom St. Thomas drew the following:

Omnis autem essentia vel quidditas intelligere potest sine hoc, quod
aliquid intelligatur de esse suo facto: possum enim intelligere quid est
homo, et tamen ignorare an esse habeat in rerum natura. Ergo patet, quod
esse est aliud ab essentia vel quidditate, nisi forte sit aliqua res,
cujus quidditas sit suum esse, et haec res non potest esse nisi una et
prima. <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34)

The finite, concrete thing is composed of two other principles, *matter*
and *form*. *Matter* is nothing but a reality indeterminate as body.
Because of its indetermination, it has only the aptitude to become, by
virtue of the form, this or that body. *Form* is the principle that
determines matter to be actually such a body. Neither matter can exist
without form, nor form without matter. As long as the wood remains
indifferent to being a cradle, it is a cradle in potentiality, and
becomes a cradle in actuality the very moment it receives the form of a
cradle. Furthermore, all finite beings are capable of receiving not only
the form proper to them, but also the opposite. Matter and form are real
elements or principles of being, and together they form a real and
integral whole. If either were taken away, there would be no concrete
thing at all. That is the reason why form is immanent in matter. <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35)

#### THE FIRST PRINCIPLES

Closely related with the concept of being are the laws of

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

thought and reality. If the concept of being is true, likewise the first
principles are true. If the concept of being is based on reality, so are
the first principles, which are not only the laws of thought, but also
of reality. In fact, every first principle implies the fundamental idea
of being.

*The principle of contradiction* is: It is impossible for the same thing
to be and not to be at the same time.

*The principle of excluded middle* is: A thing either is or is not.

*The principle of causality* is thus formulated by Alfarabi: "Whatever
exists after having not existed, must be brought into being by a cause;
nothing (not-being) cannot be the cause of being." <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36) Alfarabi arrived at the principle of
causality through the analysis of the idea of motion. Motion or change
involves a transition from not-being into being, from potentiality into
actuality. And since not-being of itself cannot rise to being, we
legitimately infer a something which causes the change. Change, like
limitation, implies a something beyond itself, something to which change
is due. That explains precisely the axiom, "Quidquid movetur, ab alio
movetur", namely, that change implies a real and objective cause, of
which Alfarabi and the Schoolmen felt very certain.

It is to be noted that Alfarabi, after having formulated the principle
of causality in a philosophical way, wound up in mystic tendencies. He
says,

In the world of created things we do not find either produced
impressions or free choice unless it is the result of a cause. Man
cannot do a thing without relying on external causes, which are not of
his choice, and these causes rely on the order, and the order on the
decree, and the decree on the judgment, and the judgment comes from the
commandment. And so everything is de-creed. <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37)

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It should be
noted, however, that apart from these mystic tendencies, Alfarabi is
quite Aristotelian and deserves much credit and praise for passing on to
us the following ontological truths:

Being cannot be defined. All subsequent philosophers, both Arabian and
Scholastic, accepted it and made it their own.

Reality is being in becoming, actuality in potentiality, unity in
difference. Hence, the different concepts of substance and accident,
essence and existence, matter and form, cause and effect.

Concepts are not merely symbols or names, but on the contrary, they have
real significance, and their primary function is to synthesize the many
in the one. For him, therefore, concepts stand for the universal and the
one, applicable to many and found in many (unum de multis et in multis)
.

Finally, every event must have a cause. This is a proposition that
expresses the essential dependence of every effect on some cause. We can
now see how the Ontology of Alfarabi treats of that which is, the nature
of which is actuality in potentiality.

#### METAPHYSICAL THEOLOGY

The Theodicy of Alfarabi, which considers God in Himself, does not
differ much from the Christian both in the arguments proving God's
existence, as well as in the exposition of the various attributes which
constitute His nature. There are, undoubtedly, certain flaws here and
there on some non-essential points, but as a whole I can say that one
who reads his Theodicy gets the impression of reading an essay written
by a Christian Father. In this section we shall deal at length, not only
with the arguments by which Alfarabi proves God's existence, but also
with each of the attributes of God as he considers them, in order to
bring out the perfect similarity that exists between Christian Theodicy
and the Theodicy of Alfarabi.

#### THE KNOWABILITY OF GOD

One of the preliminary questions which confronted Alfarabi was whether
or not God is knowable. On this question he could not make up his mind,
and consequently, he was hesitant to give a definite answer. Perhaps his
hesitancy arose from his failure to distinguish between what is simply
self-evident and that which is self-evident to us. In fact, he says:

It is very difficult to know what God is because of the limitation of
our intellect and its union with matter. Just as light is the principle
by which colors become visible, in like manner it would seem logical to
say that a perfect light should produce a perfect vision. Instead, the
very opposite occurs. A perfect light dazzles the vision. The same is
true of God. The imperfect knowledge we have of God is due to the fact
that He is infinitely perfect. That explains why His infinitely perfect
being bewilders our mind. But if we could strip our nature of all that
we call 'matter; then certainly our knowledge of His being would be
quite perfect. <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38)

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

In another place he says:

God is knowable and unknowable, evident and hidden, and the best
knowledge of Him is to know that He is something the human mind cannot
thoroughly understand. <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39)

A glance, however, into Alfarabi's later teaching leads us to the
conclusion that he must have implicitly admitted the proposition, "God
is", to be self-evident in itself, because he states repeatedly that
God's essence is His existence, thus identifying the predicate with the
subject. But since our mind is unable to understand the selfsame thing
of both these terms, the implication is that Alfarabi must have come to
the tacit conclusion that this proposition, "God is", is self-evident in
itself, although not to us, and what is not evident to us can be
demonstrated. <span id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40) According to him, the
knowledge of God is the object of philosophy, and the duty of man is to
rise, as far as is humanly possible, up to the likeness of God. <span
id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41)

#### PROOFS OF GOD'S EXISTENCE

The arguments brought forth by Alfarabi to prove that there is a God,
are three. These will be placed side by side with those of St. Thomas in
order to aid the reader in comparing them. He will thus see the great
similarity between them.

| In contemplating the changeable world, one sees that it is composed of beings which have a cause, and this cause, in turn, is the cause of another. Now, in the series of efficient causes it is not possible to proceed to infinity. For, if A were the cause of B, B of C, C of D, and so on, here A would be the cause of it-self, which is not admissible. Therefore, outside the series of efficient causes, there must be an uncaused efficient cause, and this is God. <span id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44) | In the world of sense we find there is an order of efficient causes.

| have a cause. To this effect Alfarabi makes a distinction between a necessary being and a contingent being. "Contingent beings," he says, "have had a beginning. Now, that which begins to exist must owe its existence to the action of a cause. This cause, in turn, either is or is not contingent. If it is contingent, it also must have received its existence by the action of another cause, and so on. But a series of contingent beings which would produce one another cannot proceed to infinity or move in a circle. Therefore, the series of causes and effects must arrive at a cause that holds its existence from itself, and this is the first cause (ens primum)." <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47) | be ... But it is impossible for these always to exist ... Therefore, not all beings are merely possible, but there must exist something, the existence of which is necessary. But every necessary being either has its necessity caused by another or not. Now, it is impossible to go on to infinity in necessary things which have their necessity caused by another. Therefore, we can-not but postulate the existence of some being having of itself its own necessity, and not receiving it from another, but rather causing in others their necessity. This all men speak of as God. <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48) |

 

The different arguments brought forth by Alfarabi to prove God's
existence are really so many statements of one and the same argument
which is commonly called the "cosmological" argument. This argument
derives its validity from the principle of causality. And if the
principle of causality is validly used by the scientists to explain the
phenomena of physics, likewise it must be regarded as validly employed
by the philosopher to explain the universe. Hence, the cosmological
argument is valid because the principle of causality is valid.

The proof of an immovable mover by Aristotle, which leads to the
conclusion that God is a designer and not a creator, was improved and
corrected by Alfarabi nearly three hundred years before St. Thomas was
born. Starting out from the Aristotelian idea of change, Alfarabi was
able to arrive at an Ens Primum to whom that change is due, while He
Himself does not change, because He is pure act.

The proofs of causality and contingence as given by St. Thomas are
merely a repetition of Alfarabi's proofs. This is said,

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

not because of any bias against St. Thomas, but rather because this is
evident to anyone after studying the works of both Alfarabi and of St.
Thomas.

The main idea running through all the proofs of Alfarabi is being. That
which begins to exist implies a self-existent being. A finite and
contingent being, that is, a being which has not given itself existence,
implies a Being that holds its existence from itself. A being which
begins to exist must have a cause for its existence.

An analysis of the proofs adduced by Alfarabi shows how he was able to
arrive at their formulation. In each of his three proofs he starts out
from a fact, applies a principle, and arrives at the conclusion. The
fact is *change*, *caused being* and *contingence*. The principle is:
that which is moved, is moved by another; the effect implies a cause;
the contingent implies the necessary. The conclusion is that God exists.

#### HOW MAN ACQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF GOD'S NATURE AND OF HIS ATTRIBUTES

Since man knows only what he finds out by his own senses and
intelligence, it follows that he has no other way of knowing the divine
nature except by observation. And observing the visible world, he
perceives certain perfections and imperfections in it. To the first
class belong such perfections as being, life, intelligence, truth,
goodness and so on, which of themselves con-note perfection. To the
second class belong all imperfections as non-being, non-living,
non-intelligence, which necessarily con-note imperfection. While it
cannot be said that God is non-living, non-intelligent, it can be said
that He is infinitely good, intelligent and wise. While imperfections
are removed from God, perfections can be attributed to Him eminently,
namely, whatever positive being they express belongs to God as their
cause in a much higher sense and in a more excellent way than to the
creatures in which they exist. Another way of saying this is: given an
infinite cause and finite effects, whatever pure perfection is
discovered in the effects must first exist in the cause \[Via
Affirmationis\], and at the same time whatever imperfection

Remotions\]. Alfarabi agrees with the foregoing explanation, saying that

We can have some knowledge of the nature of God by means of a two-fold
process: first, by exclusion \[Via Remotionis\], by which we remove from
God whatever implies defect, as limitation, dependence, mutability; and
second, by pre-eminence \[Via Eminentiae\], by which we attribute to God
in an infinite degree all perfections, such as goodness, wisdom,
etc. <span id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49)

Concerning the method to be followed in determining God's nature, St.
Thomas says exactly the same thing in the following words:

We have some knowledge thereof (divine essence) by knowing what it is
not: and we shall approach all the nearer to the knowledge thereof
according as we shall be enabled to remove by our intellect a greater
number of things therefrom. <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50)

In another place St. Thomas says: "Quaelibet creatura potest in Deum
venire tribus modis, scilicet, per causalitatem, remotionem,
eminentiam." <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51)

The following are the attributes of God as considered by Alfarabi and
St. Thomas.

| Neither can there be that kind of composition known as metaphysical, which results from the union of two different concepts so referred to the same real thing that neither one by itself signifies the whole reality as meant by their union. Thus, every contingent being is a metaphysical composite of essence and existence. Essence, as such, in reference to a contingent being, implies its conceivableness or. possibility, and abstracts from actual existence; while existence, as such, must be added to essence before we can speak of the being as actual. But the composite of essence and existence in a contingent being can-not be applied to the self-existent or infinite being in whom essence and existence are one. Therefore, there is no composition of essence and existence in God. <span id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54) | Existence denotes a kind of actuality ... Now everything to which an act is becoming, and which is distinct from that act, is related thereto as potentiality to act ... Accordingly if the divine essence is distinct from its existence, it follows that His essence and existence are mutually related as potentiality and act. Now it has been proved that in God there is nothing of potentiality, and that He is pure act. Therefore God's essence is not distinct from His existence. <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55) |

The foregoing is but a summary of Alfarabi's teaching about God and His
attributes. My conclusion is that his Theodicy shows a scholarly,
closely reasoned work. For, he has given us a carefully worked out
treatise on the question of God's existence and His attributes. On the
question of God's existence, he improved the Aristotelian proof of the
first mover, adding to it two other proofs, that of efficient causes and
of contingence. On the other hand, the attributes of God are dealt with
so perfectly from the Christian viewpoint that the whole topic seems to
have been written by a Christian Father, rather than by a Mohammedan.
That Alfarabi's Theodicy exerted a great influence on Medieval thinkers
is evident, because, upon comparing the teachings of Alfarabi with those
of St. Thomas, we see without doubt the influence of the former on the
latter, but not vice versa.

### METAPHYSICAL COSMOLOGY

#### RELATION OF GOD TO THE WORLD

That God exists is a proven truth; that the world was made is another
truth. The most arduous question, however, which man tries to solve is
this: What relation is there between God and the world, the Infinite and
the finite? What connection is there between God and matter? Is there a
bridge thrust from one side to the other over which God might pass to
give matter a determinate form? The dualism of spirit and matter,
infinite and finite, constitutes the cosmological problem of
Metaphysics. In an effort to explain the action of God on matter,
Alfarabi placed the intellects of the Spheres between God and the world.
Thus, he made the many proceed from the One by *emanation*. His theory
is as follows:

From the First Being (the One) comes forth the first intellect called
the First Caused. From the first intellect thinking of the First Being
flows forth a second intellect and a sphere. From the second intellect
proceeds a third intellect and a sphere. The process goes on in
necessary succession down to the lowest sphere, that of the moon. From
the moon flows forth a pure intellect, called *active intellect*. Here
end the separate intellects, which are, by essence, intellects and
intelligibles. Here is reached the lower end of the supersensible world
(the world of ideas of Plato).

These ten intellects, together with the nine spheres, constitute the
second principle of Being. The active intellect, which is a bridge
between heaven and earth, is the third principle. Finally matter and
form appear as the fifth and sixth principles, and with these is closed
the series of spiritual existences.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

Only the first of these principles is unity, while the others represent
plurality. The first three principles, God, the intellects of the
spheres and the active intellect, remain spirit *per se*, namely, they
are not bodies, nor are they in direct relation with bodies; neither are
the last three (soul, form, matter) bodies by themselves, but they are
only united to them.

There are six kinds of bodies: the celestial, the rational animal, the
irrational animal, the vegetal, the mineral and the four elements (air,
water, fire, earth). All of these principles and bodies taken together
make up the universe. <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78)

The theory of separate intellects such as taught by Alfarabi and other
Arabian philosophers is simply a mixture of Aristotelian theories on the
motion of heavenly spheres (Met. XII, cap. 7 and 8) and of the
neo-Platonic doctrine of emanation. The student of philosophy may be
surprised to hear such a strange and ridiculous theory. But, should he
delve into its origin, he would certainly find that the belief in the
animation of stars is just a particular case of what men formerly
believed, namely, the animation of nature.

#### ETERNITY OF MATTER AND ETERNITY OF THE WORLD

Alfarabi firmly believed that the world is the workmanship of an
eternal, intelligent being; and thus God is the first principle or the
efficient cause. He also believed that God, in order to make the world,
must have had materials to work upon. From this he inferred that an
eternal, uncreated matter must have been the material cause of the
universe. But this matter, he believed,

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

had no form, though it contained many forms in potentiality. This is
what he says:

When people say that God created the world, they simply mean that God
produced the world out of matter by clothing it with a determinate form.
The world is certainly God's work, and though it comes after Him as a
world-form, yet it is equal to Him in time or eternal, insofar as He
could not begin to work on it in time. The reason for this is that God
is to the world exactly what a cause is to its effect. Since the cause
in this case is inseparable from the effect, it follows that He could
not, in a given moment, start making it. For, if He could, that would
simply imply imperfection on His part while He had been trying to
achieve His goal. This, of course, is incompatible with the absolute
perfection of God. <span id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79)

The eternity of the world and of matter as held by Alfarabi and Avicenna
was rejected by Averroes and Maimonides, who taught the "creatio mundi
ex nihilo." From the latter St. Thomas borrowed the proposition that the
world was created from nothing.

#### DUALISM OF GOOD AND EVIL

According to neo-Platonists, the dualism of spirit and matter gives rise
to the existence of two principles, the principle of good and the
principle of evil. For them, evil is linked with matter. Fortunately,
the neo-Platonic teaching on this problem did not have much influence on
Alfarabi. For, he says:

God's providence is exercised over all things. Hence, whatever happens
in the world is not to be attributed to chance. Evil is under divine
control and is united to corruptible things. That evil exists in the
world is good accidentally, because if it did not exist, a great deal of
good in the world would never come about. <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80)

In conclusion, it should be noted that Alfarabi's Metaphysical

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cosmology is not
original at all, but rather it is a mixture of Aristotelian theories
(motion of the spheres, eternity of matter) and of neo-Platonic
emanation.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

#### METAPHYSICAL PSYCHOLOGY

In this part Alfarabi discusses the various problems concerning the
human soul.

#### THE SOUL IS A BEING QUITE DISTINCT FROM THE BODY

Alfarabi holds that the human soul is essentially distinct from the
body, simply because he accepts the Aristotelian definition of the soul
as the entelechy or the substantial form of the body. By this he means
that the soul is the principle of life in man, a principle by which he
thinks, feels and wills, and by which his body is animated. <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81) This is also borne out by the fact that

Man is composed of two principles, body and soul. The body is composed
of parts, limited by space, measurable, divisible; while the soul is
free from all bodily qualities. The former is a product of the created
world, while the latter is simply the product of the last separate
intellect of the supersensible world. <span
id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82)

#### SPIRITUALITY OF THE HUMAN SOUL

The soul of man is not only simple and indivisible, but it is also
spiritual. That is, it is in itself independent of matter and can
subsist apart from the body. He says:

The spirituality of the soul is demonstrated by its specific operations,
which are intellection and volition. The operation of a being is
according to the nature of the being itself (*Actio sequitur esse*).
Now, intellect and will may attain to the abstract and immaterial;
therefore, the soul itself must also be independent of matter.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

In addition to this, he says:

*Omne agens agit sibi simile*, which means that the effect must resemble
its cause, for the soul can give to its operations only what it has
itself. Therefore, the spiritual operations of the soul give us true
knowledge of the nature of the soul itself. <span
id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83)

#### IMMORTALITY OF THE HUMAN SOUL

Alfarabi held that the human soul cannot exist before the body, as Plato
had said. Nor can it migrate from one body to another, as taught by the
author of Metempsychosis. <span id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84) However,
it is very doubtful whether Alfarabi believed in the immortality of the
human soul. For, he wrote passages for and against immortality. Against
immortality we find the following passages:

The only thing that survives the dissolution of the body is the active
intellect, the *dator formarum* which is incorruptible. <span
id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85)

And in his lost commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics, he is reported by
Averroes to have said that

The supreme good of man is in this life, and anything meant to attain it
in the life to come is but folly; it is an old wives' tale.

In fact, toward the end of his treatise on the Passive Intellect and its
union with the Active, Averroes quotes Alfarabi as saying in the
commentary mentioned above that

Man's supreme good in this life is to attain knowledge. But to say that
man after death becomes a separate form is an old wives' tale; for
whatever is born and dies is incapable of becoming immortal.

This statement of Alfarabi brought much reproof on him, and

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

for it Immanuel Ben Solomon, in his *Final Judgment*, consigns him to
the infernal regions. <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86)

However, in contrast with these passages, we find one in favor of
immortality. "After death," he says, "the human soul will be happy or
unhappy according to its merits or demerits." <span
id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87) In the face of these statements for and
against the immortality of the soul, it is difficult indeed to tell
whether or not Alfarabi believed in it. Most probably he did not.
