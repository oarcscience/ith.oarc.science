# PART I. LOGICAL

### Chapter I

### LOGIC

In Logic Alfarabi follows Aristotle. He has, however, his own original
views. His Logic deals with concepts, judgments and reasoning.

#### MENTAL OPERATIONS

According to Alfarabi, a concept is an idea that represents the
objective essence or the essential notes of a thing. It is the object of
the first mental operation, called conception. "Concepts," says
Alfarabi, "are determined by definition; definition declares what a
thing is. Through definition concepts are so arranged and systematized
that they imply one another until we arrive at the most universal ones,
which do not presuppose others, such as Being, Necessary Being,
Contingent Being. Such concepts are self-evident. A man's mind may be
directed to them and his soul may be cognizant of them, but they cannot
be demonstrated to him. Nor can they be explained by deriving them from
what is known, since they are already clear in themselves, and that with
the highest degree of certitude." <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md)

For Alfarabi, judgment is the combination of a particular entity with a
universal idea. The synthesis of the particular with the universal is
never evident of itself. That explains why we must seek a second
universal with which the first universal and the particular agree. Once
we find a second universal with which the two terms of the judgment
agree, both of these will agree too, between themselves, according to
the principle which is the supreme law of every syllogism, "Two things
which are equal to the same thing, are equal to each other." Thus, for
instance, the judgment, "The world is made" is not so clear as to permit
the union of the particular "world" with the universal "made". There is
a term of mediation for both, and this is the universal
"Composed". <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md)

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

In Alfarabi's opinion, the process of reasoning by which we start from
what is known and well established and proceed to a knowledge of the
unknown, is Logic strictly speaking. <span
id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) Philosophy, therefore, is mediation,
reasoning and demonstration. Is philosophy only that and nothing else?
Certainly not. There is something that cannot be mediated or
demonstrated, namely, the First Principles.

The First Principles are those of Contradiction, Causality and of
Excluded Middle. Such principles are self-evident, be-cause they have in
themselves their own demonstration.

#### THE CATEGORIES

All our concepts could be classified under ten headings, called
categories. For, the categories are a complete enumeration of everything
that can enter into judgment, either as a subject or predicate.
Alfarabi, following Aristotle, enumerates ten: Sub-stance, Quantity,
Quality, Relation, Place, Time, Action, Passion, Posture and Having.
Such categories, in Alfarabi's view, have been empirically gathered by
Aristotle. Observing the things which make the universe, Aristotle found
that some of them exist in themselves and are basis of certain accidents
or differences. The things existing in themselves he called "substances"
and the differences he called "accidents."

Aristotle then asked, "How many kinds of accidents are there?" He
noticed that substance is divisible and therefore capable of more or
less; thus he named Quantity the first accident-category. Realizing that
substance has capacity of acquiring certain characteristics, like,
"Peter is good," Paul is a philosopher," Aristotle lost no time in
selecting Quality as the second accident-category.

Because substances are inter-related in the sense that the concept of
one implies the other, Aristotle lost no time in choosing

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Relation as the
third accident-category. The relation between time and a thing in time
led him to name Time in the fourth place. Because of the relation
between different objects in space or the relation between place and the
thing placed, Aristotle set aside Place as the fifth accident-category.
The ability of substance to take various positions helped him select
Posture as the sixth accident-category. The physical influence of
substance on the production of another substance made him call Action as
the seventh accident-category. Since substance is influenced by the
efficient cause, he chose Passion as the eighth accident-category.
Finally the relation of the thing having and the thing had made him pick
Having as the ninth accident-category. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md)

#### CERTAIN QUESTIONS ON THE CATEGORIES

In treating the Categories, Alfarabi gave the answer to certain
questions that had worried the Logicians of his time. First of all, he
believes that not all the ten Categories are absolutely simple. Each is
simple when compared with those that are below it. But only four are
absolutely simple, namely, Sub-stance, Quality, Quantity and Posture.
Action and Passion come from substance and quality; time and place from
substance and quantity; Having occurs between two substances; Relation
between two of the ten categories. <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md)

There are degrees in the simplicity of the Categories. For instance,
Quantity and Quality depend directly on substance, so much so that to
exist both need only a substance. On the contrary, Relation needs
several things, perhaps two substances, or a substance and an accident,
or two accidents. <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md)

When asked whether Action and Passion, which are found together, should
be classified in the category of Relation, Alfarabi

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

answers in the negative. For "when we find one thing always with
another," he says, "it does not follow that there is a dependence of
relation between them." For example, we find respiration only with the
lungs, the day only with sunrise, accident only with substance, the
spoken word only with the tongue. Now all these things are not to be
classified in the dependence of Relation, but rather in that of
necessity. Necessity may be essential necessity, as that of the birth of
the day upon the rising of the sun; and accidental necessity as that of
the departure of Zeid upon the arrival of Amron. Furthermore, there is
complete necessity when one thing exists by reason of the other, as
father and son; while it is incomplete necessity when the dependence of
relation is unilateral, as one and two, the two depends on the one, but
the one does not depend on the two. <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md)

We ask whether the Equal and the Unequal are a property of Quantity, and
the Similar and Dissimilar a property of Quality. According to Alfarabi,
each of the two terms Equal and Unequal, taken separately, is a property
of Quantity, while if both terms are taken together, they are
descriptive of Quantity. The same is true of Similar and Dissimilar in
reference to Quality. <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md)

In regard to the theory of Contraries, Alfarabi makes some very profound
observations. "Is the contrary the absence (privation) of its contrary?
Is white the absence of black?" asks Alfarabi. He answers saying, "It is
not. For, white is something and not merely the absence of black. Since
the absence of black is a fact in the existence of white, we are led to
say that every contrary is the absence of its contrary." <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md)

People say that the science of the contraries is one. But Alfarabi says
that a distinction must be made, for "If we deal with the science of
something which happens to have a contrary, then that science is not
identical with that of its contrary. The

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

science of the Just is not that of the Unjust, the knowledge of White is
not the knowledge of Black. On the other hand, if we deal with the
science of something insofar as it has a contrary, then this science is
one with that of its contrary, because in this sense the two contraries
are really and truly two relatives." <span
id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md)

"Opposites and Contraries differ and must be distinguished one from the
other," says Alfarabi. "Opposites are two things which cannot exist in
the same object at the same time and in the same respect, as the quality
of father and son. Opposites are a part of Relatives proper. Contraries
are odd and even, affirmation and negation, sight and blindness." <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md)

Some ask how many things are necessary to the knowledge of the unknown.
"Two things are necessary and sufficient," answers Alfarabi. "If there
are more than two, this means that they are not necessary to the
knowledge of the object under investigation." <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md)

"Is the proposition, "Man exists" a judgment with or without a
predicate?" asks Alfarabi. "If man is considered from the natural and
objective viewpoint," he answers, "the judgment is without a predicate
because the fact of existence is one with man and cannot be
distinguished from him, while the predicate denotes distinction from the
thing to which it is referred. From a logical point of view, the
judgment has a predicate, because it is made up of two terms which may
be either true or false." <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md)

In Logic too Alfarabi makes some brilliant and original observations,
and gives evidence of a great knowledge of the Organon and Isagoge.
