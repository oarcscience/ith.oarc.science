### CHAPTER IV

### ETHICS

#### ACTIONS--GOOD, BAD, INDIFFERENT

On the subject of human actions Alfarabi says:

The end of human actions is happiness. Happiness is something all men
desire. The voluntary actions by which man attains the end of his
existence are called good, and from them proceed the habits of doing
good, known as virtues; while the voluntary actions which prevent man
from attaining his end are called evil, and from them flow the habits of
doing evil, known as vices. Good actions deserve reward, whereas bad
actions deserve punishment. <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md)

And he continues:

In addition to good and bad actions there are actions that are
indifferent. These possess a morality without significance to merit or
demerit, and because of this they are called indifferent or
amoral. <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)

Finally, man will attain full happiness only when he becomes free from
the obstacles of the body.

Beyond these fundamental ideas we know very little of Alfarabi's Ethics,
simply because his commentary on the *Nicomachean Ethics*, which
represents his ethical thought, has been lost. However, these few ideas
show perfectly well the general trend of his thought.
