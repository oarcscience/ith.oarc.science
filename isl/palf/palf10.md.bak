### CHAPTER V

### POLITICAL SOCIETY

Man needs the help of his fellowmen to attain the perfection proper to
his nature. Unlike the brute, man is not equipped by nature with all
that is necessary for the preservation and development of his being. It
is only through society that he finds a complete satisfaction of his
physical, intellectual and moral needs. Hence, it follows, that society
is natural to man.

These are Alfarabi's words. And according to him society is either
perfect or imperfect. Perfect society is of three kinds: the highest,
the intermediate and the lowest. The highest is the whole inhabited
earth coming under one political organization. The intermediate is a
nation occupying a specific place of the inhabited earth. The lowest is
a city which represents a fraction of the territory of a nation.

Imperfect society is of three kinds: the village, the suburb of a city
and the home. These are merely steps leading to the organization of the
state. <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md)

#### DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL STATE

Alfarabi describes the organization of a model state in these words:

Just as the world is one harmonious whole ruled by the highest authority
of God; just as the stars and the sub-lunar world are linked up and
follow one another; just as the human soul is one in different powers;
just as the human body is an organized whole moved by the heart; in like
manner the state is to be regulated and patterned after these noble
models.

In the model state there must be a hierarchy of rulers coming under the
control of a supreme head or prince. This prince, head of the model
state or of the whole

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

earth, must possess certain traits: great intelligence, excellent
memory, eloquence, firmness without weakness, firmness in the
achievement of good, love for justice, love for study, love for truth,
aversion to falsehood, temperance in food, drink and enjoyments, and
contempt for wealth.

All these traits must be found in one man alone placed in charge of
directing the complicated machinery of the state. In case all these
traits cannot be found in one man alone, then inquiry should be made to
determine whether there are two or more who possess the required traits
jointly. If there are two, they should both rule the model state. If
there are three, then these three should rule. If more are needed, more
should rule. <span id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md)

Thus the government by one man alone winds up in an aristocratic
republic.

He continues:

Opposed to the model state are: the ignorant state, the perverted state
and the mistaken state. The ignorant state is the state that has no
knowledge of true happiness, and very often exchanges it for health,
wealth and pleasure. Thus, it is the ignorant state which has for its
end the acquisition of things, such as food, clothing and shelter; it is
the ignorant state which has for its end the enjoyment of eating and
drinking, sensual pleasures, amusements and games; it is the ignorant
state which has for its end the seeking of praise and the making of a
name; it is the ignorant state which believes in false liberty, by which
everyone can do as he pleases; it is the ignorant state which pursues
imperial-ism as a national policy, namely, the will of conquering people
and nations by fire and sword.

The perverted state is the state that maintains a conduct similar to
that of the ignorant state, even though it knows what is true happiness
and perfection.

The mistaken state is the state that has wrong ideas about God and
happiness. <span id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md)

Alfarabi, in his conception of the state, shows a mystico-philosophical
belief in the absorption of the human spirit into the world spirit, and
finally into God. In fact, he says:

The goal of the model state is not only to procure the

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

material prosperity of its citizens, but also their future destiny. The
souls of the citizens of the ignorant state are devoid of reason, and
will return to the material elements as sensible forms in order to be
united again to other beings, animals or plants.

In both the perverted and mistaken states, the ruler alone is to be held
responsible, and he will be punished accordingly in the world hereafter;
and the souls which have been led into error share the fate of the
citizens of the ignorant state. On the other hand, the good souls will
enter the world of pure spirits, and the higher their knowledge in this
life, the higher their position after death. <span
id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md)

I cannot help quoting the following passage where Alfarabi shows these
good souls in possession of their supreme good:

When a great number of men have passed away, and their bodies are
annihilated, and their souls made happy, other men will follow them.
When these have also passed away and attained the happiness they longed
for, each of them joins the one he is similar to in kind and degree.
These souls join one another as an intelligible joins an intelligible.
In proportion as the souls in-crease in number and are united to one
another, in the same proportion their happiness increases, for, each
one, thinking of his substance, thinks of a great many similar
substances, and the object of such thinking goes on increasing
indefinitely with the arrival of new souls. <span
id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md)

The political theory of Alfarabi is a mixture of Platonic and
Aristotelian elements. The main Platonic element is to put all humanity
in one universal state. For him, the state as it exists now, is not the
model state. The model state, not yet realized, is organized humanity
which is not circumscribed by national boundaries. It is likened to a
family which has in heaven the same Creator and Father, and on earth the
same forebears. In such a family there can be no wars, simply because
the vision now of each and everyone is not a particular nation, but
humanity; not a particular king, but God.

Such a political conception on the part of Alfarabi might surprise the
reader, for, we are wont to think that no one could

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

ever dream of putting the whole world under one political organization,
unless that came as a result of the progress of civilization. But it is
not so. Just as the idea of political universality was contained in the
imperialism of Alexander the Great, and later in the Roman imperialism,
in like manner it was contained in the theocratic Moslem conception. And
history bears this out.

Furthermore, Alfarabi tempers the ideal state of Plato with some
Aristotelian elements, such as private property and the monarchic form
of government. This, however, could be easily changed to an aristocratic
republic if the required intellectual and moral traits of the chief
executive cannot be found but in a few persons.

In one word, our philosopher envisaged the many nations of the world as
welded together into one political organization under a wise ruler.
