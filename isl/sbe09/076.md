### THE CHAPTER OF MAN.

### (LXXVI. Mecca)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

Does there not come on man a portion of time when he is nothing worth
mentioning <span id="fr_450"></span>[2](#fn_450.md)?

Verily, we created man from a mingled clot, to try him; and we gave him
hearing and sight. Verily, we guided him in the way, whether he be
grateful or ungrateful.

Verily, we have prepared for those who misbelieve chains and fetters and
a blaze!

\[5\] Verily, the righteous shall drink of a cup tempered with
Kâfûr <span id="fr_451"></span>[3](#fn_451.md), a spring from which God's
servants shall drink and make it gush out as they please!

They who fulfil their vows, and fear a day, the evil

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

which shall fly abroad, and who give food for His love to the poor and
the orphan and the captive. 'We only feed you for God's sake; we desire
not from you either reward or thanks; \[10\] we fear from our Lord a
frowning, calamitous day!'

And God will guard them from the evil of that day and will cast on them
brightness and joy; and their reward for their patience shall be
Paradise and silk! reclining therein upon couches they shall neither see
therein sun nor piercing cold <span id="fr_452"></span>[1](#fn_452.md); and
close down upon them shall be its shadows; and lowered over them its
fruits to cull; \[15\] and they shall be served round with vessels of
silver and goblets that are as flagons--flagons of silver which they
shall mete out! and they shall drink therein a cup tempered with
Zin*g*abîl <span id="fr_453"></span>[2](#fn_453.md), a spring therein named
Silsabîl! and there shall go round about them eternal boys; when thou
seest them thou wilt think them scattered pearls; \[20\] and when thou
seest them thou shalt see pleasure and a great estate! On them shall be
garments of green embroidered satin and brocade; and they shall be
adorned with bracelets of silver; and their Lord shall give them to
drink pure drink! Verily, this is a reward for you, and your efforts are
thanked.

Verily, we have sent down upon thee the Qur’ân. Wherefore wait patiently
for the judgment of thy Lord, and obey not any sinner or misbeliever
amongst them. \[25\] But remember the name of thy Lord morning, and
evening, and through the

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

night, and adore Him, and celebrate His praises the whole night long.

Verily, these love the transitory life, and leave behind them a heavy
day!

We created them and strengthened their joints; and if we please we can
exchange for the likes of them in their stead. Verily, this is a
memorial, and whoso will, let him take unto his Lord a way.

\[30\] But ye will not please except God please! Verily, God is knowing,
wise.

He makes whomsoever He pleases to enter into His mercy; but the unjust
He has prepared for them a grievous woe!
