### THE CHAPTER OF THE ZODIACAL SIGNS.

### (LXXXV. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.  
By the heaven with its zodiacal signs <span
id="fr_474"></span>[2](#fn_474.md)!  
And the promised day!  
And the witness and the witnessed <span
id="fr_475"></span>[3](#fn_475.md)!  
The fellows of the pit were slain;  
\[5\] And the fire with its kindling,  
When they sat over it  
And witnessed the while what they were doing with  
  those who believed <span id="fr_476"></span>[4](#fn_476.md).

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

And they took not vengeance on them save for  
  their belief in God,  
The mighty, the praiseworthy,  
Whose is the kingdoms of the heavens  
  and the earth;  
For God is witness over all!

\[10\] Verily, those who make trial of the believers, men and women, and
then do not repent, for them is the torment of hell, and for them is the
torment of the burning!

Verily, those who believe and act aright, for them are gardens beneath
which rivers flow,--that is the great bliss!

Verily, the violence of thy Lord is keen!

Verily, He produces and returns, and He is the forgiving, the loving,
\[15\] the Lord of the glorious throne; the doer of what He will!

Has there come to thee the story of the hosts of Pharaoh and Thamûd?

Nay, those who misbelieve do say it is a lie; \[20\] but God is behind
them--encompassing!

Nay, it is a glorious Qur’ân in a preserved tablet <span
id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_477.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_474"></span>[326:2](085.htm#fr_474.md) Literally, 'towers.'

<span id="fn_475"></span>[326:3](085.htm#fr_475.md) Various interpretations
are given of these words, the most probable perhaps being that 'the
witness' is Mohammed, and 'the witnessed' the faith.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[326:4](085.htm#fr_476.md) Alluding to the
persecution of the Christians at Ne*g*rân by <span id="page_327">p.
327</span> DHu ’n Navvâs, king of Yemen, who had embraced the Jewish
religion, and who commanded all his subjects who would not do the same
to be flung into a pit filled with fire, and burnt to death.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[327:1](085.htm#fr_477.md) See Part I, p. 2, note
2.
