### THE CHAPTER OF THE CONFEDERATES <span id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166.md).

### (XXXIII. Medînah.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

O thou prophet! fear God and obey not the misbelievers and hypocrites;
verily, God is ever knowing, wise!

But follow what thou art inspired with from thy Lord; verily, God of
what you do is ever well aware. And rely upon God, for God is guardian
enough.

God has not made for any man two hearts in his inside; nor has He made
your wives,--whom you back away from,--your real mothers <span
id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_167.md); nor has He

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

made your adopted sons your real sons. That is what ye speak with your
mouths; but God speaks the truth and He guides to the path!

\[5\] Call them by their fathers' names; that is more just in God's
sight; but if ye know not their fathers, then they are your brothers in
religion and your clients. There is no crime against you for what
mistakes ye make therein; but what your hearts do purposely--but God is
ever forgiving and merciful.

The prophet is nearer of kin to the believers than themselves, and his
wives are their mothers. And blood relations are nearer in kin to each
other by the Book of God than the believers and those who fled <span
id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_168.md); only your doing kindness to your
kindred, that is traced in the Book.

And when we took of the prophets their compact <span
id="fr_169"></span>[2](#fn_169.md), from thee and from Noah, and Abraham,
and Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary, and took of them a rigid compact,
that He might ask the truth-tellers of their truth. But He has prepared
for those who misbelieve a grievous woe.

O ye who believe! remember God's favours towards you when hosts came to
you and we sent against them a wind and hosts <span
id="fr_170"></span>[3](#fn_170.md) that ye could not see;--and God knew
what ye were doing.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

\[10\] When they came upon you from above you and from below <span
id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_171.md) you, and when your eyesights were
distracted and your hearts came up into your throats, and ye suspected
God with certain suspicions.

There were the believers tried and were made to quake with a severe
quaking.

And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was sickness said,
'God and His Apostle have only promised us deceitfully.' And when a
party of them said, 'O people of Yathreb <span
id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_172); there is no place for you (here.md) <span
id="fr_173"></span>[3](#fn_173), return then (to the city.md).' And a part
of them asked leave of the prophet (to return), saying, 'Verily, our
houses are defenceless;' but they were not defenceless, they only wished
for flight.

But had they been entered upon from its environs and then been asked to
show treason they would have done so; but they would only have tarried
there a little while <span id="fr_174"></span>[4](#fn_174.md).

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

\[15\] They had covenanted with God before, that they would not turn
their backs; and God's covenant shall be enquired of.

Say, 'Flight shall avail you naught; if ye fly from death or slaughter,
even then ye shall be granted enjoyment only for a little!'

Say, 'Who is it that can save you from God, if He wish you evil, or wish
you mercy?' but they will not find beside God a patron or a helper.

Say, 'God knows the hinderers amongst you, and those who say to their
brethren, "Come along unto us," and show but little valour;--covetous
towards you <span id="fr_175"></span>[1](#fn_175.md).' When fear comes thou
wilt see them looking towards thee, their eyes rolling like one fainting
with death; but when the fear has passed away they will assail you with
sharp tongues, covetous of the best <span
id="fr_176"></span>[2](#fn_176.md). These have never believed, and God will
make vain their works, for that is easy with God.

\[20\] They reckoned that the confederates would never go away; and if
the confederates should come they would fain be in the desert with the
Arabs, asking for news of you! and if they were amongst you they would
fight but little.

Ye had in the Apostle of God a good example for him who hopes for God
and the last day, and who remembers God much.

And when the believers saw the confederates they said, 'This is what God
and His Apostle promised us; God and His Apostle are true!' and it only
increased them in faith and resignation.

Amongst the believers are men who have been

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

true to their covenant with God, and there are some who have fulfilled
their vow <span id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_177.md), and some who wait and
have not changed <span id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_178.md) with fickleness.

That God might reward the truthful for their truth, and punish the
hypocrites if He please, or turn again towards them;--verily, God is
forgiving, merciful!

\[25\] And God drove back the misbelievers in their rage; they gat no
advantage;--God was enough for the believers in the fight, for God is
strong, mighty!

And He drove down those of the people of the Book who had helped
them <span id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_179.md) from their fortresses <span
id="fr_180"></span>[4](#fn_180.md) and hurled dread into their hearts; a
part ye slew and ye took captive a part: and He gave you their land, and
their dwellings, and their property for an inheritance, and a land ye
had not trodden, for God is ever mighty over all.

O thou prophet! say to thy wives, 'If ye be desirous of the life of this
world and its adornments, come, I will give you them to enjoy and I will
let you range handsomely at large! But if ye be desirous of God and His
Apostle and of the abode of the hereafter, verily, God has prepared for
those of you who do good a mighty hire <span
id="fr_181"></span>[5](#fn_181.md)!'

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

\[30\] O ye women of the prophet! whosoever of you commits manifest
fornication, doubled shall be her torment twice; and that is easy unto
God!

But that one of you who is devoted to God and His Apostle and does right
we will give her her hire twice over, and we have prepared for her a
noble provision.

O ye women of the prophet! ye are not like any other women; if ye fear
God then be not too complaisant in speech, or he in whose heart is
sickness will lust after you; but speak a reasonable speech.

And stay still in your houses and show not yourselves with the
ostentation of the ignorance of yore; and be steadfast in prayer, and
give alms, and obey God and His Apostle;--God only wishes to take away
from you <span id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_182.md) the horror as people of
His House and to purify you thoroughly.

And remember what is recited in your houses of the signs of God and of
wisdom; verily, God is subtle and aware!

\[35\] Verily, men resigned and women resigned <span
id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_183.md), and believing men and believing women,
and devout men and devout women, and truthful men and truthful women,
and patient men and patient women, and humble men and humble women, and
almsgiving men and almsgiving women, and fasting men and fasting women,
and men who guard their private parts and women who guard their private
parts, and

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

men who remember God much, and women who remember Him,--God has prepared
for them forgiveness and a mighty hire.

It is not for a believing man or for a believing woman, when God and His
Apostle have decided an affair, to have the choice in that affair; and
whoso rebels against God and His Apostle has erred with an obvious
error.

And when thou didst say to him God had shown favour to and thou hadst
shown favour to, 'Keep thy wife to thyself and fear God;' and thou didst
conceal in thy soul what God was about to display; and didst fear men,
though God is more deserving that thou shouldst fear Him; and when Zâid
had fulfilled his desire of her <span id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_184.md) we
did wed thee to her that there should be no hindrance to the believers
in the matter of the wives of their adopted sons when they have
fulfilled their desire of them: and so God's bidding to be done <span
id="fr_185"></span>[2](#fn_185.md).

There is no hindrance to the prophet about what God has ordained for
him;--(such was) the course of God with those who have passed away
before,--and God's bidding is a decreed decree! Those who

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

preach God's messages and fear Him and fear not any one except God,--but
God is good enough at reckoning up.

\[40\] Mohammed is not the father of any of your men, but the Apostle of
God, and the Seal of the Prophets; for God all things doth know!

O ye who believe! remember God with frequent remembrance, and celebrate
His praises morning and evening.

He it is who prays <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_186.md) for you and His
angels too, to bring you forth out of the darkness into the light, for
He is merciful to the believers.

Their salutation on the day they meet Him shall be 'Peace!' and He has
prepared for them a noble hire.

O thou prophet! verily, we have sent thee as a witness and a herald of
glad tidings and a warner, \[45\] and to call (men) unto God by His
permission, and as an illuminating lamp.

Give glad tidings then to the believers, that for them is great grace
from God. And follow not the unbelievers and the hypocrites; but let
alone their ill-treatment <span id="fr_187"></span>[2](#fn_187.md), and
rely upon God, for God is guardian enough.

O ye who believe! when ye wed believing women, and then divorce them
before ye have touched them,

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

ye have no term that ye need observe; so make them some provision, and
let them go handsomely at large.

O thou prophet! verily, we make lawful for thee thy wives to whom thou
hast given their hire <span id="fr_188"></span>[1](#fn_188.md), and what
thy right hand possesses <span id="fr_189"></span>[2](#fn_189.md) out of
the booty that God has granted thee, and the daughters of thy paternal
uncle and the daughters of thy paternal aunts, and the daughters of thy
maternal uncle and the daughters of thy maternal aunts, provided they
have fled with thee, and any believing woman if she give herself to the
prophet, if the prophet desire to marry her;--a special privilege this
for thee, above the other believers.

\[50\] We knew what we ordained for them concerning their wives and what
their right hands possess, that there should be no hindrance to thee;
and God is forgiving, merciful.

Put off <span id="fr_190"></span>[3](#fn_190.md) whomsoever thou wilt of
them and take to thyself whomsoever thou wilt, or whomsoever thou
cravest of those whom thou hast deposed <span
id="fr_191"></span>[4](#fn_191.md), and it shall be no crime against thee.
That is nigher to cheering their eyes and that they should not grieve,
and should be satisfied with what thou dost bring them all; but God
knows best what is in their hearts; and God is knowing, clement.

It is not lawful to thee to take women after (this), nor to change them
for (other) wives, even though their beauty please thee; except what thy
right hand possesses, for God is ever watchful over all.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

O ye who believe! do not enter the houses of the prophet, unless leave
be given you, for a meal,--not watching till it is cooked! But when ye
are invited, then enter; and when ye have fed, disperse, not engaging in
familiar discourse. Verily, that would annoy the prophet and he would be
ashamed for your sake <span id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_192.md), but God is
not ashamed of the truth <span id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_193.md).

And when ye ask them <span id="fr_194"></span>[3](#fn_194.md) for an
article, ask them from behind a curtain <span
id="fr_195"></span>[4](#fn_195.md); that is purer for your hearts and for
theirs. It is not right for you to annoy the prophet of God, nor to wed
his wives after him ever; verily, that is with God a serious thing.

If ye display a thing or conceal it, verily, God all things doth know.

\[55\] There is no crime against them <span
id="fr_196"></span>[5](#fn_196.md) (if they

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

speak unveiled) to their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or
their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or what
their right hands possess; but let them fear God,--verily, God is
witness over all.

Verily, God and His angels pray for the prophet. O ye who believe! pray
for him and salute him with a salutation <span
id="fr_197"></span>[1](#fn_197.md)!

Verily, those who annoy God and His Apostle, God will curse them in this
world and the next, and prepare for them shameful woe!

And those who annoy the believers for what they have not earned, such
have to bear (the guilt of) calumny and obvious sin.

O thou prophet! tell thy wives and thy daughters, and the women of the
believers, to let down over them their outer wrappers; that is nearer
for them to be known and that they should not be annoyed; but God is
forgiving, merciful.

\[60\] Surely if the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a sickness
and the insurrectionists in Medînah do not desist, we will surely incite
thee against them. Then they shall not dwell near thee therein save for
a little while. Cursed wherever they are found,--taken and slain with
slaughter!

God's course with those who have passed away before: and thou shalt
never find in God's course any alteration.

The folk will ask thee about the Hour; say, The knowledge thereof is
only with God, and what is to make thee perceive that the Hour is haply
nigh?'

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

Verily, God has cursed the misbelievers and has prepared for them a
blaze!

\[65\] To dwell therein for ever and for aye; they shall not find a
patron or a helper!

On the day when their faces shall writhe in the fire they shall say, 'O,
would that we had obeyed God and obeyed the Apostle!'

And they shall say, 'Our Lord! verily, we obeyed our chiefs and our
great men and they led us astray from the path! Our Lord! give them
double torment and curse them with a great curse!'

O ye who believe! be not like those who annoyed Moses; but God cleared
him of what they said, and he was regarded in the sight of God <span
id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_198.md).

\[70\] O ye who believe! fear God and speak a straightforward speech. He
will correct for you your works, and pardon you your sins; for he who
obeys God and His Apostle has attained a mighty happiness.

Verily, we offered the trust <span id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_199.md) to
the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to bear
it, and shrank from it; but man bore it: verily, he is ever unjust and
ignorant. That God may torment the hypocritical men and hypocritical
women, and the idolaters and idolatresses; and that God may turn
relenting towards the believing men and believing women; verily, God is
ever forgiving, merciful.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_166"></span>[138:1](033.htm#fr_166.md) When this sûrah was
written Medînah was besieged by a confederation of the Jewish tribes
with the Arabs of Mecca, Ne*g*d and Tehâmah, at the instigation of the
Jewish tribe of Na.dhîr, whom Mohammed had expelled from Mecca the year
before. The event took place in the fifth year of the Hi*g*rah.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[138:2](033.htm#fr_167.md) The Arabs were in the
habit of divorcing their wives on certain occasions with the words, 'Thy
back is to me as my <span id="page_139">p. 139</span> mother's back,'
after which they considered it as unnatural to approach them as though
they were their real mothers. This practice Mohammed here forbids. They
used also to consider their adopted children in the same light as real
children of their body; in forbidding this practice also, Mohammed
legalised his marriage with Zâinab, the divorced wife of his freedman
Zâid, who was also his adopted son.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[139:1](033.htm#fr_168.md) The Muhâ*g*erîn.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[139:2](033.htm#fr_169.md) See Part I, p. 57, note
1.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[139:3](033.htm#fr_170.md) Of angels.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[140:1](033.htm#fr_171.md) On the approach of the
confederate army, to the number of 12,000, Mohammed, by the advice of
Selmân the Persian, ordered a deep trench to be dug round Medînah, and
himself went out to defend it with 3,000 men. The two forces remained
for nearly a month in their respective camps without coming to an actual
conflict: until one night a piercing east wind blew so violently, and
made such disorder in the camp of the besiegers, that a panic seized
upon them, and they retired precipitately. Some of them had been
encamped on the heights to the east of the town, the others in the lower
part of the valley.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[140:2](033.htm#fr_172.md) The ancient name of the
city; it was only called ’El Medînah, 'the city,' after it had become
famous by giving shelter to Mohammed.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[140:3](033.htm#fr_173.md) In the trenches.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[140:4](033.htm#fr_174.md) I.e. if the
confederates had effected an entry, these half-hearted persons would
have listened to their proposals, and have deserted the prophet.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[141:1](033.htm#fr_175.md) I.e. chary of helping
you, but greedy of the spoils.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[141:2](033.htm#fr_176.md) I.e. the best share of
the spoils.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[142:1](033.htm#fr_177.md) I.e. their vow to fight
till they obtained martyrdom.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[142:2](033.htm#fr_178.md) I.e. changed their
mind.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[142:3](033.htm#fr_179.md) I.e. who had helped the
confederates.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[142:4](033.htm#fr_180.md) The Qurâi*th*ah Jews,
whom Mohammed attacked after the siege of Medînah had been raised, and
punished for their treachery in having joined the confederates although
in league with him at the time.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[142:5](033.htm#fr_181.md) Mohammed being annoyed
by the demands made by his wives for costly dresses and the like,
offered them the choice of divorce or of being content with their usual
mode of living. They chose the latter.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[143:1](033.htm#fr_182.md) Here the pronoun is
changed from feminine to masculine, and the passage is appealed to by
the Shiahs as showing the intimate relations that existed between
Mohammed and ‘Alî, for they say that by 'his household' are particularly
meant Fa*t*imah and ‘Alî. In the next paragraph the feminine is again
used.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[143:2](033.htm#fr_183.md) I.e. Muslims; see Part
I, p. 15, note 1.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[144:1](033.htm#fr_184.md) I.e. divorced her.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[144:2](033.htm#fr_185.md) Zâid was Mohammed's
freedman and adopted son. Mohammed had seen and admired Zâid's wife
Zâinab, and her husband at once offered to divorce her: this Mohammed
dissuaded him from until the transaction was sanctioned by the verse.
The relations of the Arabs to their adopted children were, as has been
remarked before, [p. 138](032.htm#page_138.md), note 2; very strict; and
Mohammed's marriage with Zâinab occasioned much scandal among his
contemporaries. This passage and those at the commencement of the
chapter abrogate all these inconvenient restrictions. Zâid and Abu
Laheb, Sarah CXI, are the only two persons of Mohammed's acquaintance
who are mentioned in the Qur’ân by name.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[145:1](033.htm#fr_186.md) The same word is used
as is rendered 'pray' in all the other passages in the Qur’ân, though
the commentators interpret it here as meaning 'bless.' So, too, in the
formula which is always used after Mohammed's name, zalla ’llâhu ‘alâihi
wa sallam, 'may God bless and preserve him!' is literally, 'may God pray
for him and salute him!'

<span id="fn_187"></span>[145:2](033.htm#fr_187.md) Either, 'do not
ill-treat them,' or, 'take no notice of their ill-treating thee.'

<span id="fn_188"></span>[146:1](033.htm#fr_188.md) I.e. dowry.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[146:2](033.htm#fr_189.md) Slave girls.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[146:3](033.htm#fr_190.md) I.e. from her turn of
conjugal rights.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[146:4](033.htm#fr_191.md) I.e. divorced.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[147:1](033.htm#fr_192.md) He would be reluctantly
obliged to ask you to leave.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[147:2](033.htm#fr_193.md) The tent of an Arab
chief is looked upon as a place of general entertainment, and is always
besieged by visitors. The advent of a stranger, or indeed any occasion
that demands the preparation of food or any form of entertainment, is
the signal for every adult male of the encampment to sit round it, and
wait for an invitation to partake of the meal. This becomes a very
serious tax upon the sheikh, as the laws of Arab hospitality
imperatively require every person present to be [invited](errata.htm#0.md)
to join in the repast. The translator has often witnessed
scenes--especially among the Arabs of Edom and Moab--which gave a very
living significance to these words of the Qur’ân. Mohammed's
exceptionally prominent position exposed him in a peculiar manner to
these irruptions of unbidden guests. Another saying bearing upon the
point is traditionally ascribed to him, zur *g*hibban tazdâd ‘hubban,
'visit seldom and you will get more love.'

<span id="fn_194"></span>[147:3](033.htm#fr_194.md) The prophet's wives.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[147:4](033.htm#fr_195.md) The women to the
present day always remain behind a curtain which screens off their part
of the tent from the rest, but freely converse with their husband and
his guests, and hand over the dishes and any other articles that may be
required by the company.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[147:5](033.htm#fr_196.md) The prophet's wives.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[148:1](033.htm#fr_197.md) See p. 145, note 1.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[149:1](033.htm#fr_198.md) The occasion of the
revelation of this verse is said to have been that Mohammed being
accused of unfairly dividing certain spoils, said, 'God, have mercy on
my brother Moses; he was wronged more than this, and bore it patiently.'

<span id="fn_199"></span>[149:2](033.htm#fr_199.md) That is, 'the faith.'
