### THE CHAPTER OF THE CONTENTION ABOUT NUMBERS.

### (CII. Place of origin doubtful.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.  
The contention about numbers deludes you till ye visit the tombs <span
id="fr_497"></span>[2](#fn_497)!  
Not so! In the end ye shall know! And again not so! In the end ye shall
know!  
\[5\] Not so! Did ye but know with certain knowledge!  
Ye shall surely see hell! And again ye shall surely see it with an eye
of certainty.  
Then ye shall surely be asked about pleasure <span
id="fr_498"></span>[3](#fn_498)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_497"></span>[340:2](102.htm#fr_497) The commentators say
that in one of the frequent contentions about the respective nobility of
the Arab tribes, that the Abu Menaf clan disputed with that of Sahm,
which was the most numerous, and the latter, having lost many men in
battle, declared that their dead should be taken into account as well as
the living.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[340:3](102.htm#fr_498) That is, the pleasures
of this life.
