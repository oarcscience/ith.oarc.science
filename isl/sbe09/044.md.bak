### THE CHAPTER OF SMOKE.

### (XLIV. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

‘H. M. By the perspicuous Book! verily, we have sent it down on a
blessed night;--verily, we had given warning--wherein is decided every
wise affair, as an order from us. Verily, we were sending
(apostles)--\[5\] a mercy from thy Lord; verily, He both hears and
knows: from the Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between
the two, if ye were but sure. There is no god but, He, He quickens and
He kills--your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore! Nay, they in
doubt do play!

But expect thou the day when the heaven shall bring obvious smoke \[10\]
to cover men--this is grievous torment!

Our Lord! remove from us the torment; verily, we are believers.

How can they have the reminder (now), when they have had a plain
apostle, and when they turned their backs away from him and said,
'Taught! mad!' Verily, we will remove the torment a little, (but) ye
will surely return!

\[15\] On the day when we will assault with the great assault, verily,
we will take vengeance.

And we already tried the people of Pharaoh when there came to them a
noble apostle: 'Send back to

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

me God's servants; verily, I am to you a faithful apostle;' and, 'Exalt
not yourselves above God; verily, I come to you with obvious authority.
And, verily, I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord, that ye stone me
not. \[20\] And if ye believe not in me then let me alone!'

Then he called upon his Lord, 'Verily, these are a sinful people.' So
journey with my servants by night--verily, ye will be pursued. But leave
the sea in quiet--verily, they are a host to be drowned! How many
gardens and springs have they left, \[25\] and corn lands and a noble
place, and comfort wherein they did enjoy themselves!

Thus--and we gave them for an inheritance to another people. And the
heaven wept not for them, nor the earth, nor were they respited.

But we saved the children of Israel from shameful woe!--\[30\]--from
Pharaoh; verily, he was haughty, one of the extravagant! And we did
choose them, wittingly, above the worlds; and we gave them signs wherein
was an obvious trial!

Verily, these <span id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_278.md) say, 'It is but our
first death <span id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_279.md), so bring our fathers,
if ye do speak the truth!'

\[35\] Are they better than the people of Tubbâ’h <span
id="fr_280"></span>[3](#fn_280.md), and those before them? We destroyed
them--verily, they were sinners!

Nor did we create the heavens and the earth, and what is between the two
in sport: we did but create them in truth, though most of them know it
not!

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

\[40\] Verily, the day of separation is their appointed term; the day
when master shall not avail client at all, nor shall they be helped;
save whomsoever God shall have mercy on; verily, He is the mighty, the
merciful!

Verily, the Zaqqûm tree (shall be) the food of the sinful: \[45\] as it
were melting <span id="fr_281"></span>[1](#fn_281.md), shall it boil in
their bellies like the boiling of hot water!--'Take him and hale him
into the midst of hell! then pour over his head the torment of hot
water!--Taste! verily, thou art the mighty, the honourable! \[50\]
Verily, this is that whereon ye did dispute!'

Verily, the pious shall be in a safe place! in gardens and springs, they
shall be clad in satin and stout silk face to face. Thus!--and we will
wed them to bright and large-eyed maids! \[55\] They shall call therein
for every fruit in safety. They shall not taste therein of death save
their first death, and we will keep them from the torment of hell! Grace
from thy Lord, that is the grand bliss!

And we have only made it easy for thy tongue, that haply they may be
mindful. 'Then watch thou; verily, they are watching too!
