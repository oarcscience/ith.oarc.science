### THE CHAPTER OF THE TRIED.

### (LX. Medînah.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

O ye who believe! take not my enemy and your enemy for patrons,
encountering them with love for they misbelieve in the truth that is to
come to you; they drive out the Apostle and you for that ye believe in
God your Lord  <span id="fr_390"></span>[2](#fn_390.md)!

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

If ye go forth fighting strenuously in my cause and craving my good
pleasure, and secretly show love for them, yet do I know best what ye
conceal and what ye display! and he of you who does so has erred from
the level path.

If they find you they will be enemies to you, and they will stretch
forth against you their hands and their tongues for evil, and would fain
that ye should disbelieve; neither your kindred nor your children shall
profit you upon the resurrection day; it will separate you! but God on
what ye do doth look!

Ye had a good example in Abraham and those with him, when they said to
their people, 'Verily, we are clear of you and of what ye serve beside
God. We disbelieve in you: and between us and you is enmity and hatred
begun for ever, until ye believe in God alone!'

But not <span id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_391.md) the speech of Abraham to
his father, 'Verily, I will ask forgiveness for thee, though I cannot
control aught from God!' O our Lord! on thee do we rely! and unto thee
we turn! and unto thee the journey is!

\[5\] Our Lord! make us not a trial for those who misbelieve; but
forgive us! Our Lord! verily, thou art mighty, wise!

Ye had in them a good example for him who

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

would hope in God and the last day. But whoso turns his back, verily,
God, He is rich and to be praised.

Mayhap that God will place love between you and between those of them ye
are hostile towards <span id="fr_392"></span>[1](#fn_392.md): for God is
powerful, and. God is forgiving, compassionate.

God forbids you not respecting those who have not fought against you for
religion's sake, and who have not driven you forth from your homes, that
ye should act righteously and justly towards them; verily, God loves the
just!

He only forbids you to make patrons of those who have fought against you
for religion's sake, and driven you forth from your homes, or have aided
in your expulsion; and whoever makes patrons of them, they are the
unjust!

\[10\] O ye who believe! when there come believing women who have fled,
then try them: God knows their faith. If ye know them to be believers do
not send them back to the misbelievers;--they are not lawful for them,
nor are the men lawful for these;--but give them <span
id="fr_393"></span>[2](#fn_393.md) what they have expended <span
id="fr_394"></span>[3](#fn_394.md), and it shall be no crime against you
that ye marry them, when ye have given them their hire. And do not ye
retain a right over misbelieving women; but ask for what ye have spent,
and let them ask for what they have spent. That is God's judgment: He
judges between you, for God is knowing, wise!

And if any of your wives escape from you to the

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

misbelievers, and your turn comes, then give to those whose wives have
gone away the like of what they have spent; and fear God, in whom it is
that ye believe.

O thou prophet! when believing women come to thee and engage with thee
that they will not associate aught with God, and will not steal, and
will not fornicate, and will not kill their children, and will not bring
a calumny which they have forged between their hands and feet <span
id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_395.md), and that they will not rebel against
thee in what is reasonable, then engage with them and ask forgiveness
for them of God;--verily, God is forgiving, compassionate.

O ye who believe! take not for patrons a people whom God is wroth
against; they despair of the hereafter, as the misbelievers despair of
the fellows of the tombs <span id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_396.md)!

<span id="fn_389"></span>[277:1](059.htm#fr_389.md) See Introduction, p.
lxvii.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[277:2](060.htm#fr_390.md) ‘Hâ*t*îb ibn abi
Balta’hah had given the Meccans warning of an <span id="page_278">p.
278</span> intended surprise by Mohammed, and on his letter being
intercepted, excused himself by saying that he had only done so in order
to make terms for his family, who were at Mecca, and that he knew that
the information would be of no avail. Mohammed pardoned him, but the
verse in the text prohibits such conduct for the future.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[278:1](060.htm#fr_391.md) I.e. they are not to
imitate Abraham's speech to his father, and ask forgiveness for their
infidel friends. Cp. Part I, p. 189, verse 115.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[279:1](060.htm#fr_392.md) I.e. by their becoming
converted to Islâm.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[279:2](060.htm#fr_393.md) I.e. to their infidel
husbands.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[279:3](060.htm#fr_394.md) The dowries.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[280:1](060.htm#fr_395.md) This is said by some
commentators to mean foisting spurious children on to their husbands.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[280:2](060.htm#fr_396.md) I.e. of the
resurrection of the dead.
