### THE CHAPTER OF THOSE WHO TEAR OUT.

### (LXXIX. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

By those who tear out violently!

And by those who gaily release <span id="fr_456"></span>[1](#fn_456)!

And by those who float through the air!

And the preceders who precede <span id="fr_457"></span>[2](#fn_457)!

\[5\] And those who manage the affair!

On the day when the quaking <span id="fr_458"></span>[3](#fn_458) quakes
which the following one shall succeed! Hearts on that day shall tremble;
eyes thereon be humbled!

\[10\] They say, 'Shall we be sent back to our old course?--What! when
we are rotten bones?' they say, 'That then were a losing return!'

But it will only be one scare, and lo! they will be on the surface!

\[15\] Has the story of Moses <span id="fr_459"></span>[4](#fn_459) come
to you? when his Lord addressed him in the holy valley of *T*uvâ, 'Go
unto Pharaoh, verily, he is outrageous; and say, "Hast thou a wish to
purify thyself, and that I may guide thee to thy Lord, and thou mayest
fear?"'

\[20\] So he showed him the greatest signs; but

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

he called him a liar and rebelled. Then he re-treated hastily, and
gathered, and proclaimed, and said, 'I am your Lord most High!' \[25\]
but God seized him with the punishment of the future life and of the
former.

Verily, in that is a lesson to him who fears!

Are ye harder to create or the heaven that He has built? He raised its
height and fashioned it; and made its night to cover it, and brought
forth its noonday light; \[30\] and the earth after that He did stretch
out. He brings forth from it its water and its pasture.

And the mountains He did firmly set, a provision for you and for your
cattle.

And when the great predominant calamity shall come, \[35\] on the day
when man shall remember what he strove after, and hell shall be brought
out for him who sees!

And as for him who was outrageous and preferred the life of this world,
verily, hell is the resort!

\[40\] But as for him who feared the station of his Lord, and prohibited
his soul from lust, verily, Paradise is the resort!

They shall ask thee about the Hour, for when it is set. Whereby canst
thou mention it? Unto thy Lord its period belongs.

\[45\] Thou art only a warner to him who fears it. On the day they see
it, it will be as though they had only tarried an evening or the noon
thereof.
