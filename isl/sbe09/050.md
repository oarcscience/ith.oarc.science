### THE CHAPTER OF Q.

### (L. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

Q. By the glorious Qur’ân! nay, they wonder that there has come to them
a warner from amongst themselves; and the misbelievers say, 'This is a
wondrous thing! What, when we are dead and have become dust?--that is a
remote return!'

We well know what the earth consumes of them, for with us is a book that
keeps (account).

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

\[5\] Nay, they call the truth a lie when it comes to them, and they are
in a confused affair <span id="fr_315"></span>[1](#fn_315).

Do not they behold the heaven above them, how we have built it and
adorned it, and how it has no flaws?

And the earth, we have stretched it out and thrown thereon firm
mountains, and caused to grow thereon every beautiful kind.

An insight and a reminder to every servant who repents!

And we sent down from the heaven water as a blessing, and caused to grow
therewith gardens and the harvest grain!

\[10\] And the tall palm trees having piled up spathes, for a provision
to (our) servants; and we quickened thereby a dead land; thus shall the
resurrection be!

Before them the people of Noah and the fellows of ar Rass <span
id="fr_316"></span>[2](#fn_316) and Thamûd and ‘Âd and Pharaoh called
the apostles liars; and the brethren of Lot and the fellows of the
Grove <span id="fr_317"></span>[3](#fn_317) and the people of
Tubbâ’h <span id="fr_318"></span>[4](#fn_318) all called the prophets
liars, and the threat was duly executed.

Were we then fatigued with the first creation? nay! but they are in
obscurity concerning the new creation.

\[15\] But we created man, and we know what his

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

soul whispers; for we are nigher to him than his jugular vein!

When the two meeters meet <span id="fr_319"></span>[1](#fn_319), sitting
the one on the right and the other on the left, not a word does he
utter, but a watcher is by him ready!

And the agony of death shall come in truth!--'that is what thou didst
shun!'

And the trumpet shall be blown!--that is the threatened day!

\[20\] And every soul shall come--with it a driver and a witness!

'Thou wert heedless of this, and we withdrew thy veil from thee, and
to-day is thine eyesight keen <span id="fr_320"></span>[2](#fn_320)!'

And his mate shall say, 'This is what is ready for me (to attest).

'Throw into hell every stubborn misbeliever <span
id="fr_321"></span>[3](#fn_321)!--who forbids good, a transgressor, a
doubter! \[25\] who sets other gods with God--and throw him, ye twain,
into fierce torment!'

His mate shall say, 'Our Lord! I seduced him not, but he was in a remote
error.'

He shall say, 'Wrangle not before me; for I sent the threat to you
before. The sentence is not changed with me, nor am I unjust to my
servants.'

On the day we will say to hell, 'Art thou full?' and it will say, 'Are
there any more?'

\[30\] And Paradise shall be brought near to the pious,--not far off.

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

This is what ye are promised, to every one who turns frequently (to God)
and keeps His commandments: who fears the Merciful in secret and brings
a repentant heart.

'Enter into it in peace: this is the day of eternity!' They shall have
what they wish therein, and increase from us!

\[35\] How many a generation have we destroyed before them, mightier
than they in prowess!

Pass through the land, is there any refuge <span
id="fr_322"></span>[1](#fn_322)? Verily, in that is a reminder to
whomsoever has a heart, or gives ear, and is a witness thereto.

We did create the heavens and the earth and what is between the two in
six days, and no weariness touched us <span
id="fr_323"></span>[2](#fn_323).

Be thou patient then of what they say, and celebrate the praises of thy
Lord before the rising of the sun and before the setting. And through
(some) of the night celebrate His praise and the additional
adorations <span id="fr_324"></span>[3](#fn_324).

\[40\] And listen for the day when the crier shall cry from a near
place <span id="fr_325"></span>[4](#fn_325);--the day when they shall
hear the shout <span id="fr_326"></span>[5](#fn_326) in truth--that is
the day of coming forth!

Verily, we quicken and we kill, and unto us the journey is!

On the day when the earth shall be cleft asunder

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

from them swiftly;--that is a gathering together which is easy to us!

We know what they say; nor art thou over them one to compel.

\[45\] Wherefore remind, by the Qur’ân, him who fears the threat.
