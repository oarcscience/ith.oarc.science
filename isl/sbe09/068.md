### THE CHAPTER OF THE PEN.

### (LXVIII. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

N. <span id="fr_417"></span>[1](#fn_417.md) By the pen, and what they
write, thou art not, by God's grace, mad! and, verily, thine is a hire
that is not grudged! \[5\] and, verily, thou art of a grand nature <span
id="fr_418"></span>[2](#fn_418.md)!

But thou shalt see and they shall see which of you is the infatuated.

Verily, thy Lord He knows best who errs from His way; and He knows best
those who are guided.

Then obey not those who call thee liar; they would fain that thou
shouldst be smooth with them, then would they be smooth with thee!

\[10\] And obey not any mean swearer <span
id="fr_419"></span>[3](#fn_419.md), a backbiter,

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

a walker about with slander; a forbidder of good, a transgressor, a
sinner; rude, and base-born too; though he have wealth and sons!

\[15\] When our signs are recited to him he says, 'Old folks’ tales!'

We will brand him on the snout!

Verily, we have tried them as we tried the fellows of the garden when
they swore, 'We will cut its fruit at morn!'

But they made not the exception <span id="fr_420"></span>[1](#fn_420.md);
and there came round about it an encompassing calamity from thy Lord the
while they slept; \[20\] and on the morrow it was as one the fruit of
which is cut.

And they cried to each other in the morning, 'Go early to your tilth if
ye would cut it!'

So they set off, saying privily to each other, 'There shall surely enter
it to-day unto you no poor person!'

\[25\] And they went early deciding to be stingy <span
id="fr_421"></span>[2](#fn_421.md).

And when they saw it they said, 'Verily, we have erred! Nay, we are
forbidden (its fruit)!'

Said the most moderate of them, 'Said I not to you, "unless ye celebrate
God's praises!"'

Said they, 'Celebrated be the praises of our Lord! verily, we were
unjust!'

\[30\] And they approached each other with mutual blame.

Said they, 'O woe to us! verily, we have been outrageous! Haply our Lord
may give us instead a better than it; verily, we unto our Lord do
yearn,'

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

Thus is the torment, but, verily, the torment of the hereafter is
greater, if ye did but know!

Verily, for the pious with their Lord are gardens of pleasure!

\[35\] Shall we then make the Muslims like the sinners? What ails you?
how ye judge!

Or have ye a book in which ye can study, that ye are surely to have what
ye may choose?

Or have ye oaths binding on us until the judgment day that ye are surely
to have what ye may judge?

\[40\] Ask them, which of them will vouch for this?

Or have they partners, then let them bring their partners if they do
speak the truth?

On the day when the leg shall be bared <span
id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_422.md); and they shall be called to adore and
shall not be able!

Lowering their looks, abasement shall attack them, for they were called
to adore while yet they were safe!

But let me alone with him who calls this new discourse a lie. We will
surely bring them down by degrees from whence they do not know.

\[45\] And I will let them have their way! for my device is sure.

Or dost thou ask them a hire for it while they are burdened with debts?

Or have they the knowledge of the unseen, so that they write?

But wait patiently for the judgment of thy Lord, and be not like the
fellow of the fish <span id="fr_423"></span>[2](#fn_423.md), when he cried
out as he was choking with rage.

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

Had it not been that grace from his Lord reached him, he would have been
cast out on the naked (shore) and blamed the while!

\[50\] But his Lord elected him, and made him of the pious.

The misbelievers well-nigh upset thee with their looks when they hear
the reminder, and they say, 'Surely he is mad!'

And yet it is but a reminder to the worlds!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_417"></span>[295:1](068.htm#fr_417.md) The Arabic name of the
letter nûn signifies both 'a fish' and 'an inkstand;' the symbol is by
some supposed to refer to Jonah, mentioned in verse 48, and by others to
writing on the eternal tablets (see Part I, p. 2, note 2), to which the
first words of the chapter apply.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[295:2](068.htm#fr_418.md) For bearing so meekly
the insults of the misbelievers.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[295:3](068.htm#fr_419.md) The person meant is,
probably, Walîd ibn Mu*g*hâirah, the inveterate enemy of the prophet.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[296:1](068.htm#fr_420.md) I.e. they did not add,
'If God please!'

<span id="fn_421"></span>[296:2](068.htm#fr_421.md) Or, according to
another interpretation, 'with a determined purpose.'

<span id="fn_422"></span>[297:1](068.htm#fr_422.md) An expression
signifying any great calamity or battle, because the non-combatants gird
up their loins to be ready for flight.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[297:2](068.htm#fr_423.md) Jonah.
