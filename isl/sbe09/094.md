### THE CHAPTER OF 'HAVE WE NOT EXPANDED?'

### (XCIV. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.  
Have we not expanded for thee thy breast <span
id="fr_490"></span>[1](#fn_490)? and set down from thee thy load which
galled thy back? and exalted for thee thy renown?  
\[5\] Verily, with difficulty is ease! verily, with difficulty is
ease!  
And when thou art at leisure then toil, and for thy Lord do thou yearn!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_490"></span>[335:1](094.htm#fr_490) I.e. expanded it for
the reception of the truth. Taking the words literally some Muslims have
supposed it to refer to the legend, that the angel Gabriel appeared to
Mohammed while he was a child, and having cut open his breast took out
his heart, and cleansed it from the black drop of original sin. This
explanation is, however, rejected by the more sensible of the orthodox
Muslim divines.
