### THE CHAPTER OF VICTORY.

### (XLVIII. Medînah.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

Verily, we have given thee an obvious victory! that God may pardon thee
thy former and later sin <span id="fr_294"></span>[1](#fn_294.md), and may
fulfil His favour upon thee, and guide thee in a right way, and that God
may help thee with a mighty help.

It is He who sent down His shechina <span
id="fr_295"></span>[2](#fn_295.md) into the hearts of the believers that
they might have faith added to their faith;--and God's are the hosts of
the heavens and the earth, and God is knowing, wise--\[5\] to make the
believers, men and women, enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow,
to dwell therein for aye; and to cover for them their offences; for that
with God is a grand bliss: and

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

to torment the hypocrites, men and women, and the idolaters, men and
women, who think evil thoughts of God;--over them is a turn of evil
fortune, and God will be wrath with them and curse them, and has
prepared for them hell, and an evil journey shall it be!

God's are the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and God is mighty,
wise!

Verily, we have sent thee as a witness, and a herald of glad tidings,
and a warner;--that ye may believe in God and His Apostle, and may aid
Him and revere Him and celebrate His praises morning and evening!

\[10\] Verily, those who swear allegiance to thee do but swear
allegiance to God;--God's hand is above their hands! and whoso perjures
himself does but perjure himself against himself; but he who fulfils
what he has covenanted with God, God shall bring him mighty hire.

The desert Arabs who were left behind <span
id="fr_296"></span>[1](#fn_296.md) shall say, 'Our wealth and our people
occupied us; ask pardon then for us!'--they speak with their tongues
what is not in their hearts!

Say, 'Who can control for you aught from God, if He wish you harm or
wish you advantage?' Nay, God of what ye do is well aware!

Nay, ye thought that the Apostle and the believers would not ever return
again to their families; that was made seemly in your hearts! and ye
thought evil thoughts, and ye were a corrupt people.

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

Whoso believes not in God and His Apostle--we have prepared for the
unbelievers a blaze!

God's is the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth. He pardons whom He
pleases, and torments whom He pleases; and God is forgiving, merciful.

\[15\] Those who were left behind <span id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_297.md)
shall say when ye have gone forth to spoils that ye may take, 'Let us
follow you;' they wish to change God's words. Say, 'Ye shall by no means
follow us; thus did God say before!'

They will say, 'Nay! but ye envy us!' Nay! they did not understand save
a little.

Say to those desert Arabs who were left behind, 'Ye shall be called out
against a people endowed with vehement valour <span
id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_298.md), and shall fight them or they shall
become Muslims. And if ye obey, God will give you a good hire; but if ye
turn your backs, as ye turned your backs before, He will torment you
with grievous woe!'

There is no compulsion on the blind, and no compulsion on the lame, and
no compulsion on the sick, but whoso obeys God and His Apostle, He will
make him enter gardens beneath which rivers flow; but whoso turns his
back He will torment with grievous woe.

God was well pleased with the believers when

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

they did swear allegiance to thee beneath the tree <span
id="fr_299"></span>[1](#fn_299.md); and He knew what was in their hearts,
and He sent down His shechina <span id="fr_300"></span>[2](#fn_300.md) upon
them and rewarded them with a victory nigh at hand <span
id="fr_301"></span>[3](#fn_301.md), and many spoils for them to take; for
God is mighty, wise!

\[20\] God promised you many spoils and hastened this on for you, and
restrained men's hands from you; and it may be a sign for the believers
and guide you in a right way;--and other (spoils) which ye could not
gain; but God has encompassed them; for God is mighty over all.

And had those who misbelieved fought you, they would have turned their
backs; then they would have found neither patron nor helper!--God's
course which has been followed before, and thou shalt find no change in
the course of God!

He it was who restrained their hands from you, and your hands from them
in the mid-valley of Mecca <span id="fr_302"></span>[4](#fn_302.md) after
He had given you the victory over them; for God on what ye do doth look!

\[25\] Those who misbelieved and turned (you) away from the Sacred
Mosque, and (turned away) the offering, kept from arriving at its
destined place <span id="fr_303"></span>[5](#fn_303.md); and had it not
been for believing men and believing women whom ye knew not, whom ye
might have trampled on, and so a crime might have

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

occurred to you on their account without your knowledge--that God may
make whomsoever He pleases enter into His mercy. Had they been distinct
from one another, we would have tormented those of them who misbelieved
with grievous woe.

When those who misbelieved put in their hearts pique--the pique of
ignorance <span id="fr_304"></span>[1](#fn_304.md)--and God sent down His
shechina upon His Apostle and upon the believers, and obliged them to
keep to the word of piety <span id="fr_305"></span>[2](#fn_305.md), and
they were most worthy of it and most suited for it; for God all things
doth know.

God truly verified for His Apostle the vision <span
id="fr_306"></span>[3](#fn_306.md) that ye shall verily enter the Sacred
Mosque, if God please, in safety with shaven heads or cut hair, ye shall
not fear; for He knows what ye know not, and He has set for you, beside
that, a victory nigh at hand <span id="fr_307"></span>[4](#fn_307.md).

He it is who sent His Apostle with guidance

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

and the religion of truth to set it above all religion; for God is
witness enough!

Mohammed is the Apostle of God, and those who are with Him are vehement
against the misbelievers,--compassionate amongst themselves; thou mayest
see them bowing down, adoring, craving grace from God and His
goodwill,--their marks are in their faces from the effects of
adoration;--that is their similitude in the law <span
id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_308.md) and their similitude in the gospel; as a
seedling puts forth its sprouts and strengthens it, and grows stout, and
straightens itself upon its stem, delighting the sower!--that the
misbelievers may be angry at them;--God has promised those of them who
believe and do right--forgiveness and a mighty hire.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_294"></span>[233:1](048.htm#fr_294.md) Some of the
commentators take this to mean sins committed by Mohammed before his
call and after; others refer the word to the liaison with the Coptic
handmaiden Mary, and to his marriage with Zâinab the wife of his adopted
son Zâid. See Introduction, pp. xxix and xl.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[233:2](048.htm#fr_295.md) Or tranquillity; see
Part I, p. 38, note 2.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[234:1](048.htm#fr_296.md) Alluding to certain
tribes who held aloof from the expedition of ‘Hudâibîyeh.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[235:1](048.htm#fr_297.md) In an expedition
against the Jews of Khâibar, which Mohammed undertook shortly after his
return from ‘Hudâibîyeh, and obtained considerable booty, which he
shared only with those who had accompanied him on the previous occasion.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[235:2](048.htm#fr_298.md) The followers of
Musâilimah, Mohammed's rival, and the tribes that had apostatized from
Islâm. Some think it refers to the Greeks and Persians.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[236:1](048.htm#fr_299.md) At ‘Hudâibîyeh.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[236:2](048.htm#fr_300.md) See Part I, p. 38, note
2.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[236:3](048.htm#fr_301.md) Either the success at
Khâibar or the taking of Mecca.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[236:4](048.htm#fr_302.md) Alluding to the truce
concluded at ‘Hudâibîyeh.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[236:5](048.htm#fr_303.md) Mohammed having only
set out with the intention of peaceably performing the pilgrimage,
carried cattle with him to sacrifice in the valley of Minâ, but was
obliged by the Qurâi*s* to turn back. See Introduction, pp. xxxix, xl.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[237:1](048.htm#fr_304.md) Suhail ibn ‘Amr, who
concluded the truce with Mohammed at ‘Hudâibîyeh, objected to the
formula 'In the name of the merciful and compassionate God,' with which
the prophet ordered ‘Alî to commence the document, and insisted on the
heathen formula 'In Thy name, O God!' He also refused to admit the words
'Mohammed, the Apostle of God,' saying, that if they had granted so much
they would not have opposed him; the words 'Mohammed the son of
Abdallah' were therefore substituted. These objections were so annoying
to the Muslims, that it was with difficulty that Mohammed could restrain
them from an immediate breach of the peace.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[237:2](048.htm#fr_305.md) The Mohammedan
profession of faith, 'There is no god but God, and Mohammed His servant
is the Apostle.' Or it may be the initial formula which the unbelieving
Meccans rejected.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[237:3](048.htm#fr_306.md) Mohammed dreamed that
he would accomplish the pilgrimage to Mecca with all its rites; the
affair at ‘Hudâibîyeh disappointed his followers, but in the following
year it was fulfilled.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[237:4](048.htm#fr_307.md) I.e. that of Khâibar.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[238:1](048.htm#fr_308.md) Or the Pentateuch.
