### THE CHAPTER OF NOAH.

### (LXXI. Mecca.)

IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.

Verily, we sent Noah to his people, 'Warn thy people before there come
to them a grievous torment!'

Said he, 'O my people! verily, I am to you an obvious warner, that ye
serve God and fear Him and obey me. He will pardon you your sins, and
will defer you unto an appointed time; verily, God's

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

appointed time when it comes will not be deferred, did ye but know!'

\[5\] Said he, 'My Lord! verily, I have called my people by night and
day, and my call did but increase them in flight; and, verily, every
time I called them, that Thou mightest pardon them, they placed their
fingers in their ears and tried to cover themselves with their garments
and persisted, and were very big with pride. Then I called them openly;
then I published to them and I spoke to them in secret, and I said, "Ask
forgiveness of your Lord, verily, He is very forgiving. \[10\] He will
send the rain upon you in torrents, and will extend to you wealth and
children, and will make for you gardens, and will make for you rivers.
What ails you that ye hope not for something serious from God, when He
has created you by steps <span id="fr_433"></span>[1](#fn_433.md)? Do ye
not see how God has created the seven heavens in stories, \[15\] and has
set the moon therein for a light, and set the sun for a lamp? and God
has made you grow out of the earth, and then He will make you return
thereto, and will make you come forth therefrom; and God has made for
you the earth a carpet that ye may walk therein in broad paths."'

\[20\] Said Noah, 'My Lord! verily, they have rebelled against me, and
followed him whose wealth and children have but added to his loss, and
they have plotted a great plot, and said, "Ye shall surely not leave
your gods: ye shall surely neither leave Wadd, nor Suwâ’h, nor
Ya*g*hûTH, nor Ya’ûq, nor Nasr <span id="fr_434"></span>[2](#fn_434.md).
and they led astray many."' And thou

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Mohammed) wilt
only increase the unjust in their error--\[25\] because of their sins
they were drowned and made to enter into the fire, and they found no
helpers against God!

And Noah said, 'My Lord! leave not upon the earth one dweller of the
misbelievers. Verily, Thou, if Thou shouldst leave them, they will lead
astray Thy servants, and they will only bear for children sinners and
misbelievers. My Lord! pardon me and my two parents, and whomsoever
enters my house believing, and (pardon) the believers men and women--but
Thou shalt only increase the unjust in loss.'
