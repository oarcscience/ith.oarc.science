<p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
<p>When the heaven is rent asunder and gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful!</p>  
<p>And when the earth is stretched out and casts forth what is in it, and is empty, [5] and gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful!</p>  
<p>O man! verily, thou art toiling after thy Lord, toiling; wherefore shalt thou meet Him!</p>  
<p>And as for him who is given his book in his right hand, he shall be reckoned with by an easy reckoning; and he shall go back to his family joyfully.</p>  
<p>[10] But as for him who is given his book behind his back&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_472"></A><A HREF="#fn_472"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he shall call out for destruction, but he</p>

<p>shall broil in a blaze! Verily, he was amongst his family joyful. Verily, he thought that he should never return to God.</p>  
<p>[15] Yea, verily, his Lord on him did look!<br> I need not swear by the evening glow,<br> Or by the night, and what it drives together,<br> Or by the moon when it is at its full,<br> Ye shall be surely transferred from state to state&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_473"></A><A HREF="#fn_473"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!</p>  
<p>[20] What ails them that they do not believe? and, when the Qur&#8217;&acirc;n is read to them, do not adore? Nay, those who misbelieve do say it is a lie, but God knows best the (malice) that they hide.</p>  
<p>So give them the glad tidings of grievous woe! [25] save those who believe and act aright, for them is hire that is not grudged!</p>
