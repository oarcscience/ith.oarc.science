# THE ALCHEMY OF HAPPINESS

## INTRODUCTION

KNOW, O beloved, that man was not created in jest or at random, but
marvellously made and for some great end. Although he is not from
everlasting, yet he lives for ever; and though his body is mean and
earthly, yet his spirit is lofty and divine. When in the crucible of
abstinence he is purged from carnal passions he attains to the highest,
and in place of being a slave to lust and anger becomes endued with
angelic qualities. Attaining that state, he finds his heaven in the
contemplation of Eternal Beauty, and no longer in fleshly delights. The
spiritual alchemy which operates this change in him, like that which
transmutes base metals into gold, is not easily discovered, nor to be
found in the house of every old woman. It is to explain that alchemy and
its methods of operation that the author has undertaken this work, which
he has entitled, *The Alchemy of Happiness*. Now the treasuries of God,
in which this

{p. 18}

alchemy is to be sought, are the hearts of the prophets, and he, who
seeks it elsewhere will be disappointed and bankrupt on the day of
judgment, when he hears the words, "We have lifted the veil from off
thee, and thy sight to-day is keen."

God has sent on earth a hundred and twenty-four thousand prophets\[1\]
to teach men the prescription of this alchemy, and how to purify their
hearts from baser qualities in the crucible of abstinence. This alchemy
may be briefly described as turning away from the world to God, and its
constituents are four:

1\. The knowledge of self.

2\. The knowledge of God.

3\. The knowledge of this world as it really is.

4\. The knowledge of the next world as it really is.

We shall now proceed to expound these four constituents in order.

\[1. This is the fixed number of the prophets according to Muhammadan
tradition.\]
