Textual Heritage

### TRANSLATOR'S PREFATORY NOTE.

This edition of Dr. DE BOER'S recent work is produced in the hope that
it may prove interesting to not a few English readers, and especially
that it may be of service to younger students commencing to study the
subject which is dealt with in the following pages. The translator has
aimed at nothing more than a faithful reproduction of the original. His
best thanks are due to the accomplished author, for his kindness in
revising the proof-sheets of the version, as it passed through the
Press.
