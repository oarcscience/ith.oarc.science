### PREFACE.

The following is the first attempt which has been made, since the
appearance of Munk's excellent sketch <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md),
to present in connected form a History of Philosophy in Islam. This work
of mine may therefore be regarded as a fresh initiation,--not a
completion of such a task. I could not know of all that had been done by
others, in the way of preliminary study in this field; and when I did
know of the existence of such material, it was not always accessible to
me. As for manuscript assistance, it was only in exceptional cases that
this was at my disposal.

Conforming to the conditions which I had to meet, I have in the
following account refrained from stating my authorities. But anything
which I may have taken over, nearly word for word or without testing it,
I have marked in foot-references. For the rest, I deeply regret that I
cannot duly indicate at present how much I owe, as regards appreciation
of the sources, to men like Dieterici, de Goeje, Goldziher, Houtsma,
Aug. Müller, Munk, Nöldeke, Renan, Snouck Hurgronje, van Vloten, and
many, many others.

Since the completion of this volume an interesting monograph on Ibn
Sina <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) has appeared, which farther
extends

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

its survey over the earlier history of Philosophy in Islam. It gives
rise to no occasion, however, to alter substantially my conception of
the subject.

For all bibliographical details I refer the reader to "die Orientalische
Bibliographie", Brockelmann's "Geschichte der Arabischen Litteratur",
and Ueberweg--Heinze's "Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie"
II<sup>8</sup>, p. 213 *sqq*. In the transcription of Arabic names I
have been more heedful of tradition and German pronunciation, than of
consistency. Be it noted only that *z* is to be pronounced as a soft
*s*, and *th* like the corresponding English sound <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md). In the Index of Personal Names, accents
signify length.

As far as possible I have confined myself to Islam. On that ground Ibn
Gebirol and Maimonides have received only a passing notice, while other
Jewish thinkers have been entirely omitted, although, philosophically
considered, they belong to the Muslim school. This, however, entails no
great loss, for much has been written already about the Jewish
philosophers, whereas Muslim thinkers have hitherto been sadly
neglected.
