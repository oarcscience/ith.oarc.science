<span class="small">This smallish book is a collection of Islamic
stories of the prophets, a genre which has been perrenially popular in
the world of Islam. Most of the characters present in the stories are
the same prophets which are familiar from the Bible and other Jewish and
Christian sources. (Notable exceptions to this are [Hud and
Salih](bkt06.md), and Al Chidhr, who appears in the story of
[Moses](bkt09)..md) Although the selections and translations appear to be
fair and accurate enough, the commentary is hostile to Islam throughout,
rendering the omnipresent editorial hand suspect. More recent printed
versions of the stories, which are more comprehensive and sympathetic,
are: *The Tales of the Prophets of al-Kisa’i*, translated by W. M.
Thackston, Jr., and *Legends and Narratives of Islam: The Biblical
Personalities*, by Khaled Sanadiki. The first is a translation of an
enduring twelfth century (of the Christian era) classic version of the
tales (and was one of the sources used by Weil for this book); the
second is a more modern restatement.</span>
