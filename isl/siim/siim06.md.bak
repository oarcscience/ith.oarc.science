#### III.

Ṣúfisim is at once the religious philosophy and the popular religion of
Islam. The great Mohammedan mystics are also saints. Their lives belong
to the Legend and contain, besides their lofty and abstruse
speculations, an account of the miracles which they wrought. They are
the object of endless worship and adoration, their tombs are holy
shrines whither men and women come as pilgrims to beseech their
all-powerful aid, their relics bring a blessing that only the rich can
buy. Whilst still living, they are canonised by the people; not
posthumously by the Church. Their title to saintship depends on a
peculiarly intimate relation to God, which is attested by fits of
ecstasy and, above all, by thaumaturgic gifts (*karámát* = χαρίσματα,
grazie). Belief in such gifts is almost universal, but there is
disagreement as to the importance which should be attached to them. The
higher doctrine, that they are of small value in comparison with the
attainment of spiritual perfection, was ignored by the mass of Moslems,
who would have considered a saint without miracles to be no saint at
all. Miracles there must be; if the holy man failed to supply them, they
were invented for him. It is vain to inquire how far the miracles of Abú
Sa‘íd may have been the work of popular imagination, but the following
extracts show that the question is not an irrelevant one, even if we
take for granted the reality of these occult and mysterious powers.

It is related by Ustád ‘Abdu ’l-Raḥmán, who was Abú

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sa‘íd's principal
Koran-reader (*muqrí*), that when Abú Sa‘íd was living in Níshápúr a man
came to him and saluted him and said:

"I am a stranger here. On my arrival I found the whole city full of thy
fame. They tell me thou art a man who has the gift of miracles and does
not hide it. Now show me one." Abú Sa‘íd replied: "When I was at Ámul
with Abú ’l-‘Abbás Qaṣṣáb, some one came to him on the same errand and
demanded of him the same thing which you have just demanded of me. He
answered, 'What do you see that is not miraculous? A butcher's son
(*pisar-i qaṣṣábí*), whose father taught him his own trade, has a
vision, is enraptured, is brought to Baghdád and falls in with Shaykh
Shiblí; from Baghdád to Mecca, from Mecca to Medina, from Medina to
Jerusalem, where Khaḍir appears to him, and God puts it in Khaḍir's
heart to accept him as a disciple; then he is brought back here and
multitudes turn towards him, coming forth from taverns and renouncing
wickedness and taking vows of penitence and sacrificing wealth. Filled
with burning love they come from the ends of the world to seek God from
me. What miracle is greater than this?' The man replied that he wished
to see a miracle at the present moment. 'Is it not a miracle,' said Abú
’l-‘Abbás, 'that a goat-killer's son is sitting in the seat of the
mighty and that he does not sink into the earth and that this wall does
not fall upon him and that this house does not tumble over his head?
Without goods and gear he possesses saintship, and without work or means
of support he receives his daily bread and feeds many people. Is not all
this a gift of miracles?' Good sir (Abú Sa‘íd continued), your
experience with me is the same as that man's with Abú ’l-‘Abbás Qaṣṣáb."
"O Shaykh!" said he, "I ask thee for miracles and thou tellest of Shaykh
Abú ’l-‘Abbás." Abú Sa‘íd said, "Whosoever belongs entirely to the Giver
(*Karím*), all his acts are gifts (*karámát*)."

Then he smiled and said in verse:

Every wind that comes to me from the region of Bukhárá  
Breathes the perfume of roses and musk and the scent of jessamine.  
Every man and woman on whom that wind is blowing  
Thinks it is surely blowing from Khoten.  
Nay, nay! From Khoten bloweth no such delicious gale: <span
id="page_67">p. 67</span>  
That wind is coming from the presence of the Beloved.  
Each night I gaze towards Yemen, that thou mayst rise;  
For thou art Suhayl (Canopus), and Suhayl rises from Yemen.  
Adored One! I endeavour to hide thy name from all,  
In order that thy name may not come into folk's mouths;  
But whether I will or no, whenever I speak to any one,  
Thy name is the first word that comes to my lips.

When God makes a man pure and separates him from his selfhood, all that
he does or abstains from doing, all that he says and all that he feels
becomes a wondrous gift (*karámát*). God bless Mohammed and the whole of
his Family <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_198.md).

In another passage the extraordinary feats performed by saints are
reduced to their proper insignificance.

They said to him, "So-and-so walks on the water." He replied, "It is
easy enough: frogs and waterfowl do it." They said, "So-and-so flies in
the air." "So do birds and insects," he replied. They said, "So-and-so
goes from one town to another in a moment of time." "Satan," he
rejoined, "goes in one moment from the East to the West. Things like
these have no great value"; and he proceeded to give the definition of
the true saint which has been quoted already <span
id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_199.md)—a man who lives in friendly intercourse
with his fellow-creatures, yet is never forgetful of God <span
id="fr_200"></span>[3](#fn_200.md).

Abú Sa‘íd looked with disfavour on the composition of marvellous tales
concerning himself. One day he summoned his famulus, Khwája ‘Abdu
’l-Karím, and inquired what he had been doing. ‘Abdu ’l-Karím answered
that he had been writing some anecdotes of his master for a certain
dervish who wanted them. "O ‘Abdu ’l-Karím!" said the Shaykh, "do not be
a writer of anecdotes: be such a man that anecdotes will be told of
thee." The biographer observes that Abú Sa‘íd's fear lest a legend of
his miracles should be published and widely circulated accords with the
practice of the most eminent Ṣúfís, who have always concealed their
mystical experiences <span id="fr_201"></span>[4](#fn_201.md). Abú Sa‘íd
placed the hidden and unrecognised saint above the saint manifest and
known to the people: the former is he whom God loves, the latter he who
loves God <span id="fr_202"></span>[5](#fn_202.md).

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

Such protests may have retarded, although they did not check, the
constantly increasing glorification of popular saints by themselves and
their devotees. At any rate, the ancient Lives of Abú Sa‘íd are modest
and subdued if we compare them with some famous legends of the same
kind.

As I have mentioned, his recorded miracles are mostly instances of
*firása*, a term equivalent to clairvoyance. Being an effect of the
light which God sets in the purified heart, *firása* is reckoned among
the "gifts" (*karámát*) of the saint and is accepted as evidence of
holiness. There were two friends, a tailor and a weaver, who obstinately
asserted that Abú Sa‘íd was an impostor. One day they said, "This man
pretends to have the gift of miracles. Let us go to him, and if he knows
what trade each of us follows, we shall then know that his claim is
true." They disguised themselves and went to the Shaykh. As soon as his
eye fell on them, he said:

On the *falak* are two craftsmen <span
id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_203.md),  
One a tailor, one a weaver.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then he said,
pointing to the tailor:

This one fashions robes for princes.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And pointing to
the weaver:

This one weaves black woollens only.

Both were covered with confusion and fell at the Shaykh's feet and
repented of their disbelief <span id="fr_204"></span>[2](#fn_204.md).

Moslems attribute to *firása*, and therefore to a divine source, all the
phenomena of telepathy, thought-reading, and second sight. In the course
of this essay I have had occasion to translate several testimonies that
Abú Sa‘íd was richly endowed with these "gifts" and that he made his
reputation as a saint by exhibiting them in public. That he really
possessed them or, at least, persuaded a great number of people to think
so, is beyond dispute—otherwise, traditions attesting

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

them would not have occupied so much of his legend; but when we come to
examine particular cases, we find that the evidence is weak from a
scientific point of view as well as on common grounds of probability.
Such considerations, I need hardly say, not only have no influence upon
the Moslem's belief in occult phenomena but do not even enter his mind.
Many stories illustrating Abú Sa‘íd's powers of *firása* occur in the
preceding pages, and it would be useless to give further specimens. The
following extracts commemorate some miracles of a different class.

<span class="small">In Níshápúr there lived a woman of noble family,
whose name was Íshí Nílí. She was a great ascetic, and on account of her
piety the people of Níshápúr used to seek blessings from her. It was
forty years since she had gone to the warm baths or set foot outside of
her house. When Abú Sa‘íd came to Níshápúr and the report of his
miracles spread through the city, she sent a nurse, who always waited
upon her, to hear him preach. "Remember what he says," said she, "and
tell me when you come back." The nurse, on her return, could recollect
nothing of Abú Sa‘íd's discourse, but repeated to her mistress some
bacchanalian verses she had heard him recite <span
id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_205.md). Íshí cried, "Go and wash your mouth! Do
ascetics and divines speak such words as these?" Now, Íshí was in the
habit of making eye-salves which she gave to the people. That night she
saw a frightful thing in her sleep and started up. Both her eyes were
aching. She treated them with eye-salves, but was no better; she betook
herself to all the physicians, but found no cure: she moaned in pain
twenty days and nights. Then one night she slept and dreamed that if she
wished her eyes to be better, she must satisfy the Shaykh of Mayhana and
win his exalted favour. Next day she put in a purse a thousand dirhems,
which she had received as alms, and bade the nurse take it to Abú Sa‘íd
and present it to him as soon as he should have finished his sermon.
When the nurse laid it before him, he was using a toothpick—for it was
his rule that at the end of the sermon a disciple brought some bread and
a toothpick, which he would use after eating the bread. He said to her,
as she was about to depart, "Come, nurse, take this toothpick and give
it to thy lady. Tell her</span>

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

that she must stir some water with it and then wash her eyes with the
water, in order that her outward eye may be cured. And tell her to put
out of her heart all suspicious and unfriendly feelings towards the
Ṣúfís, in order that her inward eye too may be cured." Íshí carefully
followed his directions. She dipped the toothpick in water and washed
her eyes and was cured immediately. Next day she brought to the Shaykh
all her jewelry and ornaments and dresses, and said, "O Shaykh! I have
repented and have put every hostile feeling out of my heart." "May it
bring thee blessing!" said he, and bade them conduct her to the mother
of Bú Ṭáhir <span id="fr_206"></span>[1](#fn_206.md), that she might robe
her in the gaberdine (*khirqa*). Íshí went in obedience to his command
and donned the gaberdine and busied herself with serving the women of
this fraternity (the Ṣúfís). She gave up her house and goods, and rose
to great eminence in this Path, and became a leader of the Ṣúfís <span
id="fr_207"></span>[2](#fn_207.md).

During the time when Abú Sa‘íd was at Níshápúr, disciples came to him of
all sorts, well and ill bred. One of his converts was a rough peasant
with iron-soled mountain-shoes, which made a disagreeable noise whenever
he entered the monastery; he was always knocking them against the wall
and annoying the Ṣúfís by his rudeness and violence. One day the Shaykh
called him and said, "You must go to a certain valley (which he named—it
lies between the hills of Níshápúr and Tús, and a stream descending from
it falls into the Níshápúr river). After going some distance you will
see a big rock. You must perform an ablution on the bank of the stream
and a prayer of two genuflexions on the rock, and wait for a friend of
mine, who will come to you. Give him my greeting, and there is something
I wish you to tell him, for he is a very dear friend of mine: he has
been with me seven years." The dervish set off with the utmost
eagerness, and all the way he was thinking that he was going to see one
of the saints or one of the Forty Men who are the pivot of the world and
upon whom depends the order and harmony of human affairs. He was sure
that the holy man's blessed look would fall on him and make his fortune
both in this world and in the next. When he came to the place indicated
by the Shaykh, he did what the Shaykh had ordered; then he waited a
while. Suddenly there was a dreadful clap and the mountain quaked. He
looked and saw a black dragon,

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

the largest he had ever seen: its body filled the whole space between
two mountains. At the sight of it his spirit fled; he was unable to move
and fell senseless to the earth. The dragon advanced slowly towards the
rock, on which it laid its head reverently. After a little while, the
dervish recovered himself somewhat, and observing that the dragon had
come to a halt and was motionless, he said, though in his terror he
scarcely knew what he said, "The Shaykh greets thee." The dragon with
many signs of reverence began to rub its face in the dust, whilst tears
rolled from its eyes. This, and the fact that it attempted nothing
against him, persuaded the dervish that he had been sent to meet the
dragon; he therefore delivered the Shaykh's message, which it received
with great humility, rubbing its face in the dust and weeping so much
that the rock where its head lay became wet. Having heard all, it went
away. As soon as it was out of sight, the dervish came to himself and
once more fell in a swoon. A long time passed before he revived. At last
he rose and slowly descended to the foot of the hill. Then he sat down,
picked up a stone, and beat the iron off his clogs. On returning to the
monastery, he entered so quietly that none was aware of his coming, and
spoke the salaam in such a low voice that he was barely heard. When the
elders saw his behaviour, they desired to know who was the Pír to whom
he had been sent; they wondered who in half a day had wrought in his
pupil a change that can generally be produced only by means of long and
severe discipline. When the dervish told the story, every one was
amazed. The elder Ṣúfís questioned the Shaykh, who replied, "Yes, for
seven years he has been my friend, and we have found spiritual joy in
each other's society." After that day none ever saw the dervish behave
rudely or heard him speak loudly. He was entirely reformed by a single
attention which the Shaykh bestowed on him <span
id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_208.md).

When Shaykh Abú Sa‘íd was at Níshápúr, holding splendid feasts and
musical entertainments and continually regaling the dervishes with
luxurious viands, such as fat fowls and *lawzína* and sweetmeats, an
arrogant ascetic came to him and said, "O Shaykh! I have come in order
to challenge you to a forty days' fast (*chihila*)." The poor man was
ignorant of the Shaykh's novitiate and of his forty years’ austerities:
he fancied that the

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
class="small">Shaykh had always lived in this same manner. He thought to
himself, "I will chasten him with hunger and put him to shame in the
eyes of the people, and then I shall be the object of their regard." On
hearing his challenge, the Shaykh said, "May it be blessed!" and spread
his prayer-rug. His adversary did the like, and they both sat down side
by side. While the ascetic, in accordance with the practice of those who
keep a fast of forty days, was eating a certain amount of food, the
Shaykh ate nothing; and though he never once broke his fast, every
morning he was stronger and fatter and his complexion grew more and more
ruddy. All the time, by his orders and under his eyes, the dervishes
feasted luxuriously and indulged in the *samá‘*, and he himself danced
with them. His state was not changed for the worse in any respect. The
ascetic, on the other hand, was daily becoming feebler and thinner and
paler, and the sight of the delicious viands which were served to the
Ṣúfís in his presence worked more and more upon him. At length he grew
so weak that he could scarcely rise to perform the obligatory prayers.
He repented of his presumption and confessed his ignorance. When the
forty days were finished, the Shaykh said, "I have complied with your
request: now you must do as I say." The ascetic acknowledged this and
said, "It is for the Shaykh to command." The Shaykh said, "We have sat
forty days and eaten nothing and gone to the privy: now let us sit forty
days and eat and never go to the privy." His adversary had no choice but
to accept the challenge, but he thought to himself that it was
impossible for any human being to do such a thing <span
id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_209.md).</span>

In the end, of course, the Shaykh proves to be an overman, and the
ascetic becomes one of his disciples.

It is related that an eminent Shaykh who lived in Abú Sa‘íd's time went
on a warlike expedition to Rum (Asia Minor), accompanied by a number of
Ṣúfís. Whilst he was marching in that country, he saw Iblís. "O accursed
one!" he cried, "what art thou doing here?—for thou canst not cherish
any design against us." Iblís replied that he had come thither
involuntarily. "I was passing by Mayhana," said he, "and entered the
town. Shaykh Abú Sa‘íd came out of the mosque. I met him on the way to
his house and he gave a sneeze which cast me here <span
id="fr_210"></span>[2](#fn_210.md)."

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

A tomb and sepulchre (*turbatí ú mashhadí*) was the only memorial of Abú
Sa‘íd in his native town that the Ghuzz hordes did not utterly
destroy <span id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_211.md). Concerning his relics,
that is to say, garments and other articles which were venerated on
account of some circumstance that gave them a peculiar sanctity or
simply because they once had belonged to him, we find valuable details
in three passages of the *Asrár*.

One day, whilst Shaykh Abú Sa‘íd was preaching at Níshápúr, he grew warm
in his discourse and being overcome with ecstasy exclaimed, "There is
naught within this vest (*jubba*) except Allah!" Simultaneously he
raised his forefinger (*angusht-i musabbiḥa*), which lay on his breast
underneath the *jubba*, and his blessed finger passed through the
*jubba* and became visible to all. Among the Shaykhs and Imáms present
on that occasion were Abú Muḥammad Juwayní, Abú ’l-Qásim Qushayrí,
Ismá‘íl Ṣábúní, and others whom it would be tedious to enumerate. None
of them, on hearing these words, protested or silently objected. All
were beside themselves, and following the Shaykh's example they flung t
away their gaberdines (*khirqaná*). When the Shaykh descended from the
pulpit, his *jubba* and their gaberdines were torn to pieces (and
distributed) <span id="fr_212"></span>[2](#fn_212.md). The Shaykhs were
unanimously of opinion that the piece of silk (*kazhpára*) which bore
the mark of his blessed finger should be torn off from the breast of the
*jubba* and set apart, in order that in the future all who came or went
might pay a visit to it. Accordingly, it was set apart just as it was,
with the cotton and lining, and remained in the possession of Shaykh Abú
’l-Fatḥ and his family. Those who came from all parts of the world as
pilgrims to Mayhana, after having visited his holy shrine used to visit
that piece of silk and the other memorials of the Shaykh and used to see
the mark of his finger, until the Ghuzz invasion, when that blessing and
other precious blessings of his were lost <span
id="fr_213"></span>[3](#fn_213.md).

Bú Naṣr Shirwání, a rich merchant of Níshápúr, was converted by Abú
Sa‘íd. He gave the whole of his wealth to the Ṣúfís and

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

showed the utmost devotion to the Shaykh. When the latter left Níshápúr
to return to Mayhana, he bestowed on Bú Naṣr a green woollen mantle
(*labácha*) of his own, saying, "Go to thy country and set up my banner
there." Accordingly Bú Naṣr went back to Shirwán, became the director
and chief of the Ṣúfís in that region, and built a convent, which exists
to-day and is known by his name. The Shaykh's mantle is still preserved
in the convent, where Bú Naṣr deposited it. Every Friday at prayer-time
the famulus hangs it from a high place in the building, and when the
people come out of the Friday mosque they go to the convent and do not
return home until they have paid a visit to the Shaykh's mantle. No
citizen neglects this observance. If at any time famine, pestilence, or
other calamity befall the country, they place the mantle on their heads
and carry it afield, and the whole population go forth and reverently
invoke its intercession. Then God, the glorious and exalted, in His
perfect bounty and in honour of the Shaykh removes the calamity from
them and brings their desires to pass. The inhabitants of that country
say that the mantle is a proved antidote (*tiryák-i mujarrab*) and they
make immense offerings to the followers of the Shaykh. At the present
time, through the blessings of the Shaykh's spirit (*himma*) and the
people's excellent belief in the Ṣúfís, this province can show more than
four hundred well-known monasteries, where dervishes obtain
refreshment <span id="fr_214"></span>[1](#fn_214.md).

When the fame of Abú Sa‘íd reached Mecca, the Shaykhs of the Holy City,
wishing to know what kind of man he was, sent Bú ‘Amr Bashkhwání, who
was a great ascetic and had resided in Mecca for thirty years, to
Mayhana in order that he might bring back a trustworthy report of Abú
Sa‘íd's character and mystical endowments. Bú ‘Amr journeyed to Mayhana
and had a long conversation with Abú Sa‘íd in private. After three days,
when he was about to return to Mecca, Abú Sa‘íd said to him, "You must
go to Bashkhwán: you are my deputy in that district. Ere long the bruit
of your renown will be heard in the fourth heaven." Bú ‘Amr obeyed and
set out for Bashkhwán. As he was taking leave, Abú Sa‘íd gave him three
toothpicks which he had cut with his own blessed hand, and said, "Do not
sell one of these for ten dínárs nor for twenty, and if thirty dínárs
are offered"—(here he stopped short and Bú ‘Amr went on his way). On
arriving at Bashkhwán,

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

<span class="small">he lodged in the room which is now (part of) his
convent, and the people honoured him as a saint. Every Thursday he began
a complete recitation of the Koran, in which he was joined by his
disciples and the men of Bashkhwán and all the notables of the
neighbouring hamlets; and when the recitation was finished, he would
call for a jug of water and dip in it one of the toothpicks which he had
received from Shaykh Abú Sa‘íd. The water was then distributed amongst
the sick, and it healed them by means of the blessed influence of both
Shaykhs. The headman of Bashkhwán, who was always suffering from colic,
begged Bú ‘Amr to send him some of the holy water. No sooner had he
drunk it than the pain ceased. Next morning he came to Bú ‘Amr and said,
"I hear that you have three of these toothpicks. Will you sell me one,
for I am very often in pain?" Bú ‘Amr asked him how much he would give.
He offered ten dínárs. " It is worth more," said Bú ‘Amr. "Twenty
dínárs." "It is worth more." "Thirty dínárs." "No, it is worth more."
The headman said nothing and would not bid any higher. Bú ‘Amr said, "My
master, Shaykh Abú Sa‘íd, stopped at the same amount." He gave him one
of the toothpicks in exchange for thirty dínárs, and with that money he
founded the convent which now exists. The headman kept the toothpick as
long as he lived. On his deathbed he desired that it should be broken
and that the pieces should be placed in his mouth and buried with him.
As regards the two remaining toothpicks, in accordance with Bú ‘Amr's
last injunctions they were placed in his shroud and interred in his
blessed tomb <span id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_215.md).</span>

I have set before my readers a picture of Abú Sa‘íd as he appears in the
oldest and most authentic documents available. These do not always show
him as he was, but it would be absurd to reproach his biographers with
their credulity and entire lack of critical judgment: they write as
worshippers, and their work is based upon traditions and legends which
breathe the very spirit of unquestioning faith. Only an alloy can be
extracted from such materials, however carefully they are analysed. The
passages in which Abú Sa‘íd describes his early life, conversion, and
novitiate are perhaps less open to suspicion than the numerous anecdotes
concerning his

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

miracles. Here pious invention plays a large part and is not limited by
any sense of natural law. Even the sceptics converted by Abú Sa‘íd feel
sure that miracles occur, and only doubt his ability to perform them.
The mystical sayings attributed to him have a power and freedom beyond
speculative theosophy and suggest that he owed his fame, in the first
instance, to an enthusiastic personality and to the possession of
"psychic" gifts which he knew how to exhibit impressively. He was a
great teacher and preacher of Ṣúfisim. If the matter of his doctrine is
seldom original, his genius gathered up and fused the old elements into
something new. In the historical development he stands out as a leading
exponent of the pantheistic, poetical, anti-scholastic, and antinomian
ideas which had been already broached by his predecessor, Báyazíd of
Bisṭám, and Abú ’l-Ḥasan Kharaqání. It may be said of Abú Sa‘íd that he,
perhaps more than any one else, gave these ideas the distinctive form in
which they are presented to us by the later religious philosophy of
Persia. Their peculiarly *Persian* character is just what we should
expect, seeing that Báyazíd, Abú ’l-Ḥasan, and Abú Sa‘íd himself were
born and passed their lives in Khurásán, the cradle of Persian
nationalism. Abú Sa‘íd also left his mark on another side of Ṣúfisim,
its organisation as a monastic system <span
id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_216.md). Although he founded no Order, the
convent over which he presided supplied a model in outline of the
fraternities that were established during the 12th century; and in the
ten rules which he, as abbot, drew up and caused to be put into
writing <span id="fr_217"></span>[2](#fn_217.md) we find, so far as I know,
the first Mohammedan example of a *regula ad monachos*.
