### CHAPTER I

### ABÚ SA‘ÍD IBN ABI ’L-KHAYR

<span class="smallcaps">Abú Sa‘íd</span> and Omar Khayyam are associated
in the history of Persian literature by the circumstance that each of
them is the reputed author of a famous collection of *rubá‘íyyát* in
which his individuality has almost disappeared. That these collections
are wholly, or even mainly, the work of Abú Sa‘íd and Omar no one who
examines the evidence is likely to assert: they should rather be
regarded as anthologies—of which the nucleus, perhaps, was formed by the
two authors in question—containing poems of a particular type composed
at various periods by many different hands. It is possible, no doubt,
that Omar's view of life and his general cast of thought are more or
less reflected in the quatrains attributed to him, but we can learn from
them nothing definite and distinctive. The same considerations apply
with equal force to the mystical *rubá‘ís* passing under the name of Abú
Sa‘íd. In his case, however, we possess excellent and copious
biographical materials which make us intimately acquainted with him and
throw a welcome light on many aspects of contemporary Persian mysticism.

The oldest of these documents is a short treatise on his life and
sayings, which is preserved in a manuscript of the British Museum (Or.
249). It bears neither title nor indication of authorship, but Zhukovski
in his edition of the text (Petrograd, 1899) identifies it with the
*Ḥálát ú Sukhunán-i Shaykh Abú Sa‘íd ibn Abi ’l-Khayr*, a work composed
about a century after Abú Sa‘íd's death by one of his descendants whose
name is unknown. He was a cousin of Muḥammad ibnu ’l-Munawwar, the
great-great-grandson of Abú Sa‘íd.

Using the *Ḥálát ú Sukhunán* as a foundation, Muḥammad ibnu ’l-Munawwar
compiled a much larger biography of his ancestor which he entitled
*Asráru ’l-tawḥíd fí maqámáti ’l-Shaykh Abí Sa‘íd* (ed. by Zhukovski,
Petrograd, 1899) and dedicated to the Ghúrid prince, Ghiyáthu’ddín
Muḥammad

ibn Sám (*ob*. <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1203). The author,
like Abú Sa‘íd himself, was a native of Mayhana or Mihna in Khurásán.
From his earliest youth it had been a labour of love for him to gather
the sayings of the Saint and to verify the records and traditions which
were handed down in his family and were still fresh in the minds of his
fellow-townsmen. The task was undertaken not a moment too soon. In <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1154 the Turcoman tribe of the Ghuzz swept
over the borders of Khurásán and carried fire and sword through that
flourishing province. Everywhere the population was massacred; the
author tells us that 115 descendants of Abú Sa‘íd, young and old, were
tortured to death in Mayhana alone, and that no memorial of him was left
except his tomb. Religion, he says, fell into utter ruin; the search
after Truth ceased, unbelief became rampant; of Islam only the name, and
of Ṣúfisim only the form survived. Impelled by divine grace, he complied
with the request of some novices that he should write an account of the
spiritual experiences and memorable sayings of Shaykh Abú Sa‘íd, for the
encouragement of those who desired to enter upon the Path (*ṭaríqa*) and
for the guidance of those who were travelling on the road of the Truth
(*ḥaqíqa*) <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md). Abú Sa‘íd died in <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1049, and the *Asráru ’l-tawḥíd* was
probably completed not less than 120 or more than 150 years later. As
Zhukovski points out, it is almost the first example in Persian of a
separate work having for its subject the life of an individual mystic.
The portrait of Abú Sa‘íd amidst the circle of Ṣúfís and dervishes in
which he lived is drawn with extraordinary richness of detail, and gains
in vividness as well as in value from the fact that a great part of the
story is told by himself. Although the Mohammedan system of oral
tradition by which these autobiographical passages have been preserved
forbids us to suppose that we have before us an exact transcript of Abú
Sa‘íd's words as they were spoken to the original reporter, there is no
reason to doubt that in most cases the substance of them is given
correctly. His own veracity is not incontestable, but this question,
which leads at once into the darkest abysses of psychology, I must leave
in suspense.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

The *Ḥálát ú Sukhunán* and the *Asráru ’l-tawḥíd* render the more recent
biographies of Abú Sa‘íd all but superfluous <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](siim04.htm#fn_3.md). A certain amount of new material
is found in the Supplement to Farídu’ddín ‘Aṭṭár's *Tadhkiratu
’l-Awliyá* (vol. II of my edition, pp. 322-337) and Jámí's *Nafaḥátu
’l-Uns* (ed. by Nassau Lees, No. 366) <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](siim04.htm#fn_4.md).

For the sake of clearness, I have divided the following study into three
sections, of which the first deals with the life of Abú Sa‘íd, the
second with his mystical sayings and doctrines, and the third with
miracles and other matter belonging to his legend.
