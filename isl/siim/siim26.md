(707 <span id="fr_869"></span>[707](#fn_867).md) Even thus (like the
showman) I was letting down between me and myself the curtain that
obscures the soul in the light of darkness,

\(708\) That in producing my actions at intervals I might appear to my
sensation gradually, thereby accustoming it (and preparing it for
complete illumination).

\(709\) I joined the play (illusion) thereof to my work (reality),

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

in order to bring near to thy understanding the ends of my far-off
purposes.

\(710\) Although his (the showman's) case is not (essentially) like
mine, there is a resemblance between us in regard to the two forms of
manifestation:

\(711\) His figures (puppets) were the forms in which, with the aid of a
screen, he displayed his action: they became naught and withdrew when he
revealed himself;

(712 <span id="fr_870"></span>[712](#fn_868).md) And my soul resembles him
in action, for my sensation is like the figures (puppets), and the
(bodily) vesture is my screen.

(713 <span id="fr_871"></span>[713](#fn_869).md) When I removed the screen
from me, as he removed it (from him), so that my soul appeared to me
without any veiling

\(714\) And already the sun of contemplation had risen, and all
existence was illumined, and through myself the knots of the
tethering-rope (of sense-perception) were untied

\(715\) I slew the youth, my soul, while on the one hand I was setting
up the wall (of consciousness) to safeguard my laws and on the other
staving in my (bodily) boat,

(716 <span id="fr_872"></span>[716](#fn_870).md) And turned to shed my
replenishing grace over every created being according to my actions at
every time;

(717 <span id="fr_873"></span>[717](#fn_871).md) And were I not veiled by
my attributes, the objects in which I manifest myself would be consumed
by the splendour of my glory.

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

Once the illusion of selfhood is destroyed, nothing remains but "the
Master of the Show," the one real person in the drama

Which, for the Pastime of Eternity,  
He doth Himself contrive, enact, behold.

\(718\) The tongues of all beings, wilt thou but hearken, bear eloquent
witness to my unity.

(719 <span id="fr_874"></span>[719](#fn_872).md) And touching my oneness
(*ittiḥád*) there hath come down a sure Tradition, whose transmission by
(oral) relation (from the Prophet) is not infirm,

\(720\) Declaring that God loves (His creatures) after they draw nigh
unto Him by voluntary works of devotion or by the observance of that
which is obligatory;

\(721\) And the point that the doctrine bids us mark is made as clear as
the light of noon by the words " I am to him an ear."

(722 <span id="fr_875"></span>[722](#fn_873).md) I used the (religious and
devotional) means to reach unification until I found it (unification),
and the agency of the means was one of my guides (thereto);

(723 <span id="fr_876"></span>[723](#fn_874).md) And I unified in respect
of the means until I lost them, and the link of (this) unification was
the way of approach (to unity) that availed me best;

(724 <span id="fr_877"></span>[724](#fn_875).md) And I stripped my soul of
them both, and she became single (detached from the world of
relations)—yet had she never at any time been other than single (in her
real nature);

\(725\) And I dived into the seas of union, nay, I plunged into them in
my aloneness and brought out many a peerless pearl,

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

(726 <span id="fr_878"></span>[726](#fn_876).md) That I might hear mine
acts with a seeing ear and behold my words with a hearing eye.

\(727\) So if the nightingale lament in the grove, whilst the birds in
every tree warble a response to her,

\(728\) And if the flute-player make music in accord with the strings
touched by the hand of a singing-girl

(729 <span id="fr_879"></span>[729](#fn_877).md) Who chants tender poetry,
so that the souls (of the hearers) mount to their Paradisal lote-tree at
each trill—

\(730\) I take delight in the effects of mine own art, and I ever
declare my union and society to be free from partnership with others.

It follows from the doctrine of *ittiḥád* that all forms of worship are
essentially divine. Even dualism and polytheism represent certain
aspects in which God expresses Himself. This passage (*vv*. 73 I-49)
should be compared with the views set forth by Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí and Jílí
(see pp. [130](siim13.htm#page_130) foll. and [157](siim16.htm#page_157.md)
foll.).

(731 <span id="fr_880"></span>[731](#fn_878).md) Through me the assembly of
them that praise my name is (attentive like) the ear of one reading (a
book), and for my sake the wine-seller's shop is (open like) the eye of
a scout;

(732 <span id="fr_881"></span>[732](#fn_879).md) And virtually no hand but
mine tied the infidels’ girdle; and if it be loosed in acknowledgement
of me, ’twas my hand that loosed it.

\(733\) And if the niche of a mosque is illuminated by the Koran, yet is
no altar of a church made vain by the Gospel;

\(734\) Nor vain are the books of the Torah revealed to Moses for his
people, whereby the Rabbis converse with God every night.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

\(735\) And if a devotee fall down before the stones in an idol-temple,
there is no reason for religious zeal to take offence;

\(736\) For many a one who is clear of the shame of associating others
with God by means of idolatry is in spirit a worshipper of money.

(737 <span id="fr_882"></span>[737](#fn_880).md) The warning from me hath
reached those whom it sought, and I am the cause of the excuses put
forward in every faith.

(738 <span id="fr_883"></span>[738](#fn_881).md) Not in any religion have
men's eyes been awry, not in any sect have their thoughts been perverse.

\(739\) They that heedlessly fell in love with the sun lost not the way,
forasmuch as its brightness is from the light of my unveiled splendour;

(740 <span id="fr_884"></span>[740](#fn_882).md) And if the Magians adored
the Fire—which, as history tells, was not quenched for a thousand years

\(741\) They intended none but me, although they took another direction
and did not declare the purpose they had formed.

\(742\) They had once seen the radiance of my light and deemed it a
fire, so that they were led away from the true light by the rays.

(743 <span id="fr_885"></span>[743](#fn_883).md) And but for the screen of
existence, I should have said it out: only my observance of the laws
imposed on phenomena doth keep me silent.

(744 <span id="fr_886"></span>[744](#fn_884).md) So this is no aimless
sport, nor were the creatures created to stray at random, albeit their
actions are not right.

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

(745 <span id="fr_887"></span>[745](#fn_885).md) Their affairs take a
course according to the brand of the Names; and the wisdom which endowed
the Essence with (diverse) attributes caused them to take that course in
consequence of the Divine decree,

(746 <span id="fr_888"></span>[746](#fn_886).md) Disposing them in two
handfuls—"and I care not…and I care not"—one destined for happiness and
one for misery.

(747 <span id="fr_889"></span>[747](#fn_887).md) Oh, let the soul know that
the case stands thus, or else let her not (seek to) know (at all), for
according to this the Koran is recited every morning.

(748 <span id="fr_890"></span>[748](#fn_888).md) And her knowledge arises
from herself: ’twas she that dictated to my senses what I hoped (of
mystic knowledge).

(749 <span id="fr_891"></span>[749](#fn_889).md) Had I singled, I should
have swerved (from the truth) and been stripped of the signs of my union
(*jam‘*) through associating my handiwork (as an equal partner) with
myself.

Protesting that he is not to be blamed for having divulged the sublime
mysteries with which the grace of God illuminated him, the poet bids his
disciple farewell. Let him follow in his master's footsteps and be one
with the Essence, even as he is one.

(759 <span id="fr_892"></span>[759](#fn_890).md) In the world of
reminiscence the soul hath her ancient knowledge—my disciples beg it of
me as a boon.

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

\(760\) Do thou, therefore, make haste to enjoy my eternal union, in
virtue of which I found the full-grown men of the tribe (of Ṣúfís no
wiser than) little babes.

\(761\) For my contemporaries drink only the dregs of what I left; and
as for those before me, their (vaunted) merits are my superfluity.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_867"></span>[260:707](siim26.htm#fr_869) (707.md) The body is
dark, inasmuch as it belongs to the world of appearance, but also light,
in so far as knowledge of reality first comes to the soul through
sense-perception. Regarded as faculties of the soul, the senses are
capable of receiving gradual illumination.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[261:712](siim26.htm#fr_870) (712.md) The soul
acts on the senses through a corporeal medium in the same way as the
showman uses a screen in order to act on his puppets.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[261:713](siim26.htm#fr_871) (713-5.md) These
lines describe the states of *faná* and *baqá*—the lifting of the bodily
veil and the consequent union with reality—which are here indicated by
means of metaphors strange to us but easy for any Moslem to understand,
since they refer to a famous passage in the Koran (18, 64-81). "I slew
the youth, my soul," *i.e.* I died to self (*faná*). "While…I was
setting up the wall…to safeguard my laws," *i.e.* my living (*baqá*) in
and through God was accompanied by the maintenance of the religious law.
The perfect mystic, after having "staved in his boat," *i.e.* having
destroyed his individual existence, nevertheless in his unitive state
"makes the Law his upper garment and the Path his inner garment": cf.
The *Mystics of Islam*, p. 163.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[261:716](siim26.htm#fr_872) (716.md) The unified
soul is one with the eternal source of energy whence the existence of
phenomena is diffused and perpetually renewed. *Imdád* in this verse has
its usual meaning: see *vv*. 403-4.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[261:717](siim26.htm#fr_873) (717.md) A paraphrase
of the celebrated Tradition concerning the 70,000 veils of light and
darkness which hide the face of Allah.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[262:719](siim26.htm#fr_874) (719.md) The poet
refers to another and equally apocryphal Ḥadíth (see [p.
5](siim04.htm#page_5) *supra*.md), the gist of which lies in the statement
that those whom God loves are one with Him, so that He is their organ of
sight, hearing, and speech.

<span id="fn_873"></span>[262:722](siim26.htm#fr_875) (722.md) Although the
mystic at the beginning of his unification values devotional exercises
as a means of attaining to union with God, he ultimately comes to know
that the attainment of union does not depend on secondary causes, which
are non-existent in reality, or on any act that he may ascribe to
himself. Cf. *Kashf al-Maḥjúb*, p. 202 foll.; The *Mystics of Islam*,
p.74 foll.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[262:723](siim26.htm#fr_876) (723.md) "I unified
in respect of the means," *i.e.* I perceived that God is the real agent
in every act.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[262:724](siim26.htm#fr_877) (724.md) "I stripped
my soul of them both," *i.e.* both of my regard for the means themselves
(*v*. 722) and of my regard for my unification of them (*v*. 723). Even
in the latter there is still a remnant of dualism, inasmuch as the
unification is attributed to the individual self.

<span id="fn_876"></span>[263:726](siim26.htm#fr_878) (726.md) In union
(*jam‘*) each attribute is identical with every other attribute and with
the Essence.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[263:729](siim26.htm#fr_879) (729.md) The words
"mount to their Paradisal lote-tree" depict the highest rapture of which
the soul is capable, as the *sidratu ’l-muntaná* (Koran, 53, 54) marks
the boundary of the seventh heaven, and neither prophet nor angel may
pass beyond it.

<span id="fn_878"></span>[263:731](siim26.htm#fr_880) (731.md) "The
assembly of them that praise my name" alludes to Ṣúfís who meet together
for the purpose of *dhikr* (see The *Mystics of Islam*, p. 45 foll.).
Every student of Persian mystical poetry knows what is meant by "the
wine-seller's shop": others may consult the *Gulshani Ráz* of Maḥmúd
Shabistarí, ed. by E. H. Whinfield, p. 78 foll. of the English
translation.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[263:732](siim26.htm#fr_881) (732.md) Christians,
Jews and Zoroastrians under Mohammedan rule wore a girdle round the
waist to distinguish them from the Faithful; hence their "loosing" it
would be a sign of their conversion to Islam.

<span id="fn_880"></span>[264:737](siim26.htm#fr_882) (737.md) Those who
disobeyed the Divine message delivered by the prophets are to be excused
on the ground that God did not create in them the spiritual capacity
which would have enabled them to understand and obey.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[264:738](siim26.htm#fr_883) (738.md) God in one
aspect or another is the real object of every religious belief.

<span id="fn_882"></span>[264:740](siim26.htm#fr_884) (740.md) The
extinction of the sacred Fire of the Persians, after it had burned
unceasingly for a thousand years, is recorded amongst the portents that
occurred on the night of the Prophet's birth (<span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 572-3).

<span id="fn_883"></span>[264:743](siim26.htm#fr_885) (743.md) "Were it not
that I appear under the form of externality, as a creature dependent on
the Divine will and subject to the Divine law, I should have said
plainly that nothing exists in reality except One Being, who manifests
Himself in every thought and action."

<span id="fn_884"></span>[264:744](siim26.htm#fr_886) (744.md) The language
of this verse is borrowed from Kor. 23, 117: "Did ye think that We
created you in idle sport?" and 75, 36: "Doth man think he shall be left
uncontrolled?" The existence of evil, *i.e.* relative imperfection,
follows by necessity from the self-manifestation of the Absolute. See
pp. 85, 93, 131.

<span id="fn_885"></span>[265:745](siim26.htm#fr_887) (745.md) Good and
evil, salvation and perdition, are effects determined by the Divine
Names, *e.g.* *al-Hádí* (He that guides aright), *al-Muḍill* (He that
leads astray), and by the Divine Attributes, *e.g.* *i‘záz* (*exaltare
humiles*) and *idhlál* (*deponere potentes*).

<span id="fn_886"></span>[265:746](siim26.htm#fr_888) (746.md) Ibnu
’l-Fáriḍ refers to the Tradition that when God created Adam, He drew
forth his posterity from his loins in two handfuls, one white as silver
and one black as coal, and said, "These are in Paradise and I care not;
and these are in Hell-fire and I care not."

<span id="fn_887"></span>[265:747](siim26.htm#fr_889) (747.md) "For
according to this," *e.g.* in Kor. 16, 95: "Allah misguides whomso He
pleaseth and leads aright whomso He pleaseth."

<span id="fn_888"></span>[265:748](siim26.htm#fr_890) (748.md) Cf. *v*. 671
and *vv*. 675-6.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[265:749](siim26.htm#fr_891) (749.md) "Had I
singled," *i.e.* if I had limited the action of the soul by singling out
and assigning to her the attributes of beauty (which are the source of
good), while I deprived her of the attributes of majesty and awe (which
are the source of evil), then I should have set up beside her a rival
Being in whom these latter attributes and the effects proceeding from
them must, *ex hypothesi*, subsist.

<span id="fn_890"></span>[265:759](siim26.htm#fr_892) (759.md) This is the
Platonic doctrine of ἀνάμνησις. In dreams and in moments of ecstasy the
soul recovers the knowledge of true being which is hidden from her
during her bodily existence. Cf. *vv*. 428-9 and 664 foll.
