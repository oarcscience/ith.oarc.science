#### VII. RELIGION, REVELATION AND PROPHECY.

Religious belief may be defined as man's thought about God, and we have
learned that all things and thoughts in the universe are attributes of
God, *i.e.*, aspects in which He reveals Himself to human minds.
Moreover, the attributes are identical with the Essence in so far as
they are nothing but the Essence regarded from every possible point of
view. Therefore God is the essence of all thought; and all thought is

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

about God. In the light of such principles the author's philosophy of
religion is easy to understand.

Divine worship, he says, is the end for which all things are
created <span id="fr_411"></span>[1](#fn_409.md), and therefore belongs to
their original nature and constitution. The different forms of worship
result from the variety of Names and Attributes by which God manifests
Himself in creation. Every Name and Attribute produces its own
characteristic effect. For example, God is the true Guide (*al-Hádí*);
but He is also the Misleader (*al-Muḍill*), for the Koran says, "Allah
shall lead the wicked into error." He is the Avenger (*al-Muntaqim*) as
well as the Forgiver (*al-Mun‘im*). If any one of His Names had remained
ineffectual and unrealised, His self-manifestation would not have been
complete. Therefore He sent His prophets, in order that those who
followed them might worship Him as the One who guides mankind to
salvation, and that those who disobeyed them might worship Him as the
One who leads mankind to perdition <span
id="fr_412"></span>[2](#fn_410.md).

All God's creatures worship Him in accordance with His will, and every
form of worship expresses some aspect of His nature. Infidelity and sin
are effects of the Divine activity and contribute to the Divine
perfection. Satan himself glorifies God, inasmuch as his disobedience is
subordinate to the eternal will. Yet some aspects in which God shows
Himself, such as Majesty and Wrath, are relatively less perfect than
others, such as Beauty and Mercy. And, again, the more completely and
universally the idea of God is presented in any form of worship, the
more perfect that form must be. Religions revealed through a prophet
contain the fullest measure of truth, and amongst these the most
excellent is Islam.

Jílí mentions ten principal "religious" sects from which all the rest
are derived <span id="fr_413"></span>[3](#fn_411.md). It is an odd
catalogue, comprising (1) the Idolaters or Infidels; (2) the Physicists,
who worship the four natural properties, namely, heat, cold, dryness and
moisture; (3) the Philosophers, who worship the seven planets; (4) the
Dualists, who worship light and darkness;

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (5) the Magians,
who worship fire; (6) the Materialists (*Dahriyyún*), who abandon
worship entirely; (7) the Brahmans (*Baráhima*), who claim to follow the
religion of Abraham; (8) the Jews; (9) the Christians; (10) the
Mohammedans.

The author proceeds to explain that God is the truth or essence of all
these forms of belief <span id="fr_414"></span>[1](#fn_412.md). The
Infidels disbelieved in a Lord, because God, who is their essence, has
no lord over Him, but on the contrary is Himself the absolute Lord. They
worshipped God according to the necessity of their essential natures.
Idolaters worship Him as the Being who permeates every atom of the
material world without infusion or commixture. God is the "truth" of the
idols which they worship, and they worship none but Him. This is the
mystery of their following the Truth in themselves <span
id="fr_415"></span>[2](#fn_413.md), because their hearts bore witness to
them that the good lay in their so doing. On account of that spirit of
belief in the reality of their worship, the thing as it really is shall
be revealed to them in the next world. "Every sect is rejoicing in that
which it hath" (Koran, 23, 55), *i.e.*, here they rejoice in their acts,
and hereafter they shall rejoice in their spiritual states. Their joy is
everlasting <span id="fr_416"></span>[3](#fn_414.md). Therefore, even if
the Infidels had known the torment which they must suffer in consequence
of their worship, they would have persisted in it by reason of the
spiritual delight which they experience therein; for when God wills to
punish any one with torment in the life to come, He creates for him in
that torment a natural pleasure of which his body becomes enamoured; and
God does this in order that the sufferer may not have an unquestionable
right to take refuge with Him from the torment, but may remain in
torment so long as the pleasure continues to be felt by him. When God
wills to alleviate his torment, He causes him to lose the sense of
pleasure, and he then takes refuge in the mercy of God, "who answers the
sorely distressed when they pray to Him" (Koran, 27, 63) <span
id="fr_417"></span>[4](#fn_415.md).

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

Similarly, the Physicists really worship the four essential attributes
of God, namely, Life, Knowledge, Power, and Will; the Philosophers
worship His names and attributes as manifested in the planets; the
Dualists worship Him as Creator and creature in one; the Magians worship
Him as the Unity in which all names and attributes pass away, just as
fire destroys all natural properties and transmutes them to its own
nature; the Materialists, who deny the existence of a Creator and
believe in the eternity of Time, worship God in respect of His He-ness
(*Huwiyya*), in which He is only potentially, but not actually,
creative; the Brahmans worship Him absolutely, without reference to
prophet or apostle <span id="fr_418"></span>[1](#fn_416.md).

As regards the future life, since all worship God by Divine necessity,
all must be saved. But the seven sects above-mentioned (unlike the Jews,
Christians and Moslems, who received their religions from a prophet)
invented their forms of worship for themselves. Consequently, they are
doomed to misery hereafter. That which constitutes their misery is the
fact that their felicity, though ultimately assured, is far off and is
not revealed to them until they have suffered retribution. On the other
hand, those who worship God according to the mode ordained by a prophet
enjoy immediate felicity, which is revealed to them continuously and
gradually. It is true that the Jews and Christians suffer misery, but
why is this? Because they have altered God's Word and substituted
something of their own. Otherwise, they would have come under the rule
that God never sent a prophet to any people without placing in his
apostolic mission the felicity of those who followed him <span
id="fr_419"></span>[2](#fn_417.md).

Here, perhaps, it will not be inopportune to give some details of the
author's eschatology. We must remember that in his view all experience
is perception by the human spirit

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

of the nature and destiny eternally stamped upon it. "I Myself am Heaven
and Hell."

"Life" denotes the spirit's contemplation of its bodily form: the spirit
assumes the form of the object contemplated, just as sunbeams falling on
green or red glass take the form and colour of the glass. After death,
*i.e.*, after the withdrawal of the spirit's gaze from the body, the
spirit remains wholly in the spiritual world, while wearing the same
corporeal aspect as it had before <span id="fr_420"></span>[1](#fn_418.md).
Those mystics who deny the resurrection of the body are in the wrong.
"We know by Divine information that bodies are raised from the dead with
their spirits." The death of the spirit consists in its detachment from
the body and resembles the dreamless sleep which is akin to
not-being <span id="fr_421"></span>[2](#fn_419.md), since the sleeper has
neither perception of the sensible nor vision of the unseen <span
id="fr_422"></span>[3](#fn_420.md).

During the intermediate state (*barzakh*) between death and resurrection
every one moves in a world of phantasy (*khayál*) peopled by the forms,
ideas, and essential characters of the actions which he or she committed
in their earthly life <span id="fr_423"></span>[4](#fn_421.md). The
drunkard quaffs fiery wine in a cup of fire; the sinner whom God has
forgiven passes into forms of good works, each fairer than the last; and
he whose good works have been done in vain becomes imbued with the form
of his eternal fate, ever-changing images of woe which his resurrection
shall reveal to him as realities <span id="fr_424"></span>[5](#fn_422.md).
The present, intermediate, and future states are one existence (*wujúd
wáḥid*), and you by virtue of your inmost nature (*huwiyya*) are the
same in them all, but while the things of this world are free
(*ikhtiyárí*), the things hereafter are determined by what happens
here <span id="fr_425"></span>[6](#fn_423.md).

The world, having been created, must die: its death is its

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

passing away (*faná*) under the might of the Divine Reality which
manifests itself in the guise of individuals; and its resurrection is
the manifestation of that Reality with the signs foretold in the
Koran <span id="fr_426"></span>[1](#fn_424.md). The universal or greater
resurrection (*al-sá‘atu ’l-kubrá*) includes the particular or lesser
resurrection (*al-sá‘atu ’l-ṣughrá*), *i.e.*, the resurrection of every
individual, and their signs correspond. For example, Dajjál (Antichrist)
is an emblem of the flesh (*nafs*): as Dajjál shall be slain by Christ
(the Spirit of God, *Rúḥ Allah*), so shall the flesh be destroyed by the
spirit (*rúḥ*) <span id="fr_427"></span>[2](#fn_425.md). Again, the coming
of the Mahdí, who shall reign for forty years, symbolises the perfection
of the Perfect Man uniting and consummating the forty grades of
existence <span id="fr_428"></span>[3](#fn_426.md). God beholds this world
through the medium of Man; therefore, after the Resurrection, it will
not exist otherwise than in God's knowledge, even as Paradise and Hell
exist in His knowledge to-day. But when Man shall have been removed to
the next world, God will behold Paradise and Hell through him, and they
will then exist actually <span id="fr_429"></span>[4](#fn_427.md).

<span class="small">God created the Form of Mohammed (*al-ṣúratu
’l-Muḥammadiyya*) from the light of His Name the Almighty Maker
(*al-Badí‘u ’l-Qádir*), and regarded it with His Name the All-subduing
Giver (*al-Mannánu ’l-Qáhir*); then He displayed Himself to it in His
Name the Gracious Pardoner (*al-Laṭífu ’l-Gháfir*). Thereupon, because
of this illumination, it split in two halves, and God created Paradise
from the half on the right hand, and Hell from the half on the left
hand <span id="fr_430"></span>[5](#fn_428.md).</span>

Jílí's description of the Eight Paradises is not specially
interesting <span id="fr_431"></span>[6](#fn_429.md). In the first Paradise
good works are rewarded, in the second good thoughts and beliefs
concerning God. The third, which is gained solely by Divine grace,
surpasses all the rest in magnitude and contains persons of every
religion, sect, and nationality. Theoretically it is possible for any
human being to enter this Paradise, if such fortune be vouchsafed to him
in some Divine illumination, but the

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

author adds: "We saw in mystical vision that only a few of each sect are
there <span id="fr_432"></span>[1](#fn_430.md)." The four highest Paradises
have no trees, pavilions, or houris, and are inhabited (except the
highest of all) by contemplatives and saints in an ascending scale of
holiness. The floor of the eighth Paradise is the roof of the Throne of
God (*al-‘Arsh*). Thither none may come—for it is the Paradise of the
Essence, "the Lauded Station" (*al-Maqám al-maḥmúd*) which, as the
Tradition tells us, was promised by God to Mohammed.

With the people of Paradise every idea immediately becomes an object of
sensation. When Adam, whose form is a copy of the form of Mohammed, went
down from Paradise, he lost the life of his form, *i.e.*, the power of
materialising his thoughts. In the present world this power depends on
the spirit, and since most of mankind are dead spiritually, belongs only
to mystics endued with God's everlasting life <span
id="fr_433"></span>[2](#fn_431.md).

Hell is the manifestation of Divine Majesty (*jalál*). When God created
the Fire, He revealed Himself to it seven times, appearing each time in
a different Name. These theophanies clove the Fire into seven valleys,
which are the limbos of Hell. <span id="fr_434"></span>[3](#fn_432.md).

Pantheism cannot allow evil to be permanent. Jílí cites the Tradition,
"My Mercy preceded My Wrath," and infers that while the latter attribute
is a mode of Divine Justice, Mercy is essential and prevails in the
end <span id="fr_435"></span>[4](#fn_433.md). Hell, according to him, is a
temporary state <span id="fr_436"></span>[5](#fn_434.md), and not
necessarily an altogether

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

undesirable one. Of course, he had been there in his visions, and he
tells of a meeting with Plato, "whom the formal theologians account an
infidel, but I saw that he filled the unseen world with light, and that
his rank was such as few amongst the saints possess <span
id="fr_437"></span>[1](#fn_435.md)." Some of the damned are more excellent
than many of the Paradisal folk: God has placed them in Hell, that He
may be revealed to them therein <span id="fr_438"></span>[2](#fn_436.md).
Jílí expatiates on the variety of pleasures enjoyed by those who burn in
the Fire <span id="fr_439"></span>[3](#fn_437.md). Some feel a pleasure
comparable to the joy of battle, for although the soldier is conscious
of pain he often has a keen delight in the fray into which " the
Lordship lurking in his soul " impels him to plunge. Another of their
pleasures resembles that felt when any one rubs an itch, even if he
should chance to break the skin. Then they have subtler pleasures, like
the self-satisfaction of the fanatic who persists in a wrong way of
thinking, or the philosopher's happy sense of superiority in preferring
his own wretched condition to the rich man's luxury and ignorance.

Their states are diverse: some, notwithstanding that they suffer the
most intense torment, would not exchange it for Paradise; some long for
a breath of the air of Eden and a draught of its water; some, having no
pleasure in their pain, feel the utmost bitterness of loathing in
themselves.

 

It is well known that Mohammed asserted the essential unity of
Revelation. From the beginning of the world, as he believed, one and the
same faith had been revealed to mankind through a succession of
prophets, of whom he himself was the last. Abraham, Moses, David, and
Jesus taught the same religion, the religion of Islam. It followed, in
the first place, that the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and the Gospel are
identical

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

in substance with the Koran, and secondly, that since the Jews and
Christians would neither accept Islam nor acknowledge Mohammed as the
prophet foretold in their books, they must be giving a false account of
what these books actually contained. The *argumentum ad homines* needed
firm handling. Uninspired Moslems would rather say that the books in
their present form are corrupt or incomplete. From quite another
standpoint the Ṣúfís agree with their Prophet that the Word of God is
essentially one. For them, indeed, all that exists is His Word, which is
revealed to His prophets and saints under different aspects and in
varying degrees of perfection. The historical and temporal is only a
symbol of the mystical and eternal revelation. As, in the former,
Christianity occupies the middle place between Judaism and Islam, so in
the latter, where these religions typify the progressive ascent of the
soul to God, the Illumination of the Names is denoted by the Pentateuch,
the Illumination of the Attributes by the Gospel, and the Illumination
of the Essence by the Koran <span id="fr_440"></span>[1](#fn_438.md).

No one who reads the *Insánu ’l-Kámil* can fail to discern that its
author was profoundly influenced by Christian ideas, though it is not
always possible to separate these from the Jewish, Gnostic and other
elements with which they are intermingled <span
id="fr_441"></span>[2](#fn_439.md). I need only allude to the Trinitarian
basis of the Divine nature <span id="fr_442"></span>[3](#fn_440.md) and the
prominence given to the Holy Spirit as the source and, in relation to
man, the organ and

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

sustaining principle of spiritual life <span
id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_441.md). Jílí criticises the Christian doctrine,
but so mildly and apologetically that one passage of his work is
declared by the Moslem editor to be an interpolation which only a
heretic could have written <span id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_442.md). The
Pentateuch, he says, was sent down to Moses in nine tables <span
id="fr_445"></span>[3](#fn_443.md), two of which, containing the mysteries
of Lordship and Power, he was forbidden to communicate to any one; and
as the Jews remained ignorant of their contents, Moses was the last of
that people to gain perfect knowledge of God. On the other hand, both
Jesus and Mohammed revealed the mystery of Lordship; but whereas
Mohammed cloaked it in symbols and made it an esoteric matter <span
id="fr_446"></span>[4](#fn_444.md), Jesus proclaimed it openly, with the
result that his followers became infidels and worshipped him as the
third of three Divine Persons, namely, the Father, the Mother, and the
Son <span id="fr_447"></span>[5](#fn_445.md). This form of Trinity, by the
way, appears in the Koran <span id="fr_448"></span>[6](#fn_446.md); it is
not a grotesque blunder on the part of Mohammed, but a Christian heresy
which still survives amongst the tribes of the Syrian desert <span
id="fr_449"></span>[7](#fn_447.md).

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> While Jesus spoke
the Truth allegorically, the Christians have taken his words
literally <span id="fr_450"></span>[1](#fn_448.md). Polytheists as they
are, God after punishing them for their error will pardon them because
of the inward sincerity of their belief, for " they acted in accordance
with the knowledge which He bestowed upon them: therefore blame them
not, since their polytheism was essentially belief in One God (*al-siḥru
’l-‘álí*) <span id="fr_451"></span>[2](#fn_449.md)." It is this sentence
and others of like tenor that the editor would erase, and we can
understand his indignation, though Jílí is simply applying to a special
case the monistic doctrine which has been explained already. Of all
non-Islamic religious communities he holds that the Christians are
nearest to God, for while they worship Him in Jesus, Mary, and the Holy
Ghost, they assert the indivisibility of the Divine nature and that God
is prior to His existence in the created body of Christ. Thus they
recognise the two complementary sides of true belief concerning God,
namely that from the one point of view (*tanzíh*) He is above all
likeness and that from the other (*tashbíh*) He reveals Himself in the
forms of His creatures <span id="fr_452"></span>[3](#fn_450.md). But, in
addition to the grave error of anthropomorphism (*tajsím*), they are at
fault in restricting the Divine self-manifestation to these three. God
said, "I breathed My Spirit into Adam <span
id="fr_453"></span>[4](#fn_451.md)," and here the name "Adam" signifies
every human individual <span id="fr_454"></span>[5](#fn_452.md). The
contemplation of those who behold God in Man is the most perfect in the
world. Something of this vision the Christians possess, and their
doctrine about Jesus will lead them at last, "when the Thing

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

shall be discovered as it really is <span
id="fr_455"></span>[1](#fn_453.md)," to the knowledge that mankind are like
mirrors set face to face, each of which contains what is in all; and so
they will behold God in themselves and declare Him to be absolutely
One <span id="fr_456"></span>[2](#fn_454.md).

Jílí concludes his work with a mystical interpretation of Islam, "the
crown of religions <span id="fr_457"></span>[3](#fn_455.md)." Much of what
he says has no interest except for specialists, *e.g.*, his definitions
of technical terms used by Ṣúfís and his explanations of the esoteric
meanings which he finds under every detail of Mohammedan ritual. He is
careful to guard against antinomianism. Certain Ṣúfí saints claimed to
have outdistanced the prophets <span id="fr_458"></span>[4](#fn_456.md),
but Jílí decides in favour of the latter. He admits that saintship—the
revelation of the Divine attributes to man—is the essence of prophecy,
and that the prophet qua saint is superior to the prophet *quâ* prophet.
Every prophet has "the prophecy of saintship" (*nubuwwatu ’l-wiláyat*),
although some, like Jesus and al-Khaḍir, have nothing more <span
id="fr_459"></span>[5](#fn_457.md); others, like Moses and Mohammed, have
also "the prophecy of institution" (*nubuwwatu ’l-tashrí‘*), *i.e.*,
they were sent to promulgate and establish a new religious code. The
Ṣúfí Shaykhs, whom God brings back from the state of trance (*faná*) in
order that they may guide the people to Him, are vicegerents (*khulafá*)
of Mohammed and, as such, are invested with "the prophecy of saintship"
and bound to observe the laws of the last of the institutional prophets,
Mohammed, who in both respects is supreme and unique <span
id="fr_460"></span>[6](#fn_458.md). Jílí must be called a pantheist in so
far as he takes "There is no god but Allah" in the sense of "Nothing
really exists but the Divine Essence with its creative and creaturely
modes of being." These modes are unified in the abstraction of intellect
as well as in the mystic's flight to God, but the author of the *Insánu
’l-Kámil* is neither a pure philosopher at any time nor an ecstatic
always. "Perception of the Essence," he writes, "consists

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

in thy knowing that thou art He and that He is thou, and that this is
not identification or incarnation, and that the slave is a slave and the
Lord a Lord, and that the slave does not become a Lord nor the Lord
become a slave <span id="fr_461"></span>[1](#fn_459.md)." Even the Perfect
Man is *a* reality (*ḥaqq*), not *the* Reality (*al-Ḥaqq*) which
displays itself in the mirror of his consciousness as God and Man <span
id="fr_462"></span>[2](#fn_460.md).

come to them from God but was written by Abraham himself. Jílí says that
it contains five parts. The fifth part on account of its profundity is

According to Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí (*Fuṣúṣ*, 90 foll.), the gnostic (*‘árif*)
creates by means of his meditation (*himma*) ideas which have an
objective existence in sensation, phantasy, or higher planes of
perception. His creative power differs from that of God, inasmuch as his
consciousness is not universal, *i.e.*, it does not comprehend every
plane of perception simultaneously. Cf. Massignon, *Kitáb al-Ṭawásín*,

<span id="fn_434"></span>[136:5](siim14.htm#fr_436.md) "Whenever God
creates torment (*‘adháb*) by Hell-fire, He also creates in the
sufferers the power of enduring it, for otherwise they would perish and
so escape. Hence, their skins are periodically renewed (Koran, 4, 59),
and they receive fresh powers of endurance, in virtue of which they feel
a presentiment of new torments; but the powers with which they endured
the former torments do not cease, inasmuch as these powers are given to
them by God, and God never takes back His gifts. Thus their powers of
endurance <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> continue to grow, until
there appears in them a Divine power which extinguishes the Fire,
because no one is doomed to misery after the Divine attributes become
manifest in him" (K II. 38, 6 fr. foot and foll.). Elsewhere, on the
ground that Hell-fire is an eternal object of God's knowledge, Jílí
denies that it is extinguished absolutely (M 44 *b*). "You may say, if
you -wish, that it remains as it was, but that the torment of the damned
is changed to pleasure" (K II. 40, 2).

<span id="fn_439"></span>[138:2](siim14.htm#fr_441.md) Naturally, the main
original source is Philo, from whom many parallels might be quoted. The
Logos, made in the image of God, is described both as an ἀρχέτυπος ἰδέα
and as a seal (σφραγίς, χαρακτὴρ) impressing itself on things. He is
called an archangel, the instrument (ὄργανον) of creation, the heavenly
man (cf. Corinthians, 15, 45 foll.), God's interpreter and prophet
ἑρμηνεὺς καὶ προφήτης). As a mediator between man and God, he is
compared with the High-priest (ἀρχιερεὺς) who, like the Moslem saint,
passes away in God: "he shall be no man when he goeth in to the Holy of
Holies," according to Philo's rendering of Leviticus, 16, 17 (Siegfried,
Philo von Alexandria, p. 224 foll.).

<span id="fn_440"></span>[138:3](siim14.htm#fr_442.md) Cf. Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí's
verse (*Tarjumán al-ashwáq*, XII. 4): "My Beloved is three although He
is one, even as the (three) Persons (of the Trinity) are made one Person
in essence"; and his statement that of all the Divine names only three
are cardinal, *viz*., Allah, al-Raḥmán, and al-Rabb (*op. cit.* p. 71).
For his doctrine of "triplicity" (*tathlíth*) see Appendix II.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[139:1](siim14.htm#fr_443.md) Massignon points out
(*Kitáb al-Ṭawásín*, p. 134, note 3) that in the treatises of the
Ikhwánu ’l-Ṣafá, (Bombay, <span class="smallcaps">a.h.</span> 1306, Iv.
107 fol.) "the in-breathing of the Spirit" (*nafkhu ’l-Rúḥ*) is
mentioned as a doctrine specially characteristic of Christian mysticism.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[139:2](siim14.htm#fr_444.md) K I. 105. Ibnu
’l-‘Arabí (*Fuṣúṣ*, 176 foll.) is more critical and orthodox than Jílí.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[139:3](siim14.htm#fr_445.md) Amongst the matters
contained in the fourth table Jílí mentions (K I. 101, 13 foll.) the
science of High Magic (*al-siḥru ’l-‘álí*), which resembles the miracles
of the saints and does not depend on drugs, formulae, etc., but solely
on the magical powers in man. "In the way of Divine unity," he says, "I
have had some experience of this, and if I had desired I could have
assumed any shape in the world and done any deed, but I knew it to be
pernicious and therefore abandoned it. Then God endowed me with the
secret potency which He placed between K and N" (*i.e.* His creative
Word, *Kun* =" Be!").

<span id="fn_444"></span>[139:4](siim14.htm#fr_446.md) There is a Tradition
to the effect that Mohammed, on the night of his ascension, received
three kinds of knowledge: one kind (external religion) he was commanded
to impart to his people, another (the spiritual doctrine) he was left
free to communicate or not, and the last (concerning the mysteries of
the Godhead) he was forbidden to divulge. Some, however, learn it by
mystical revelation (K I. 99, 10 foll.).

<span id="fn_445"></span>[139:5](siim14.htm#fr_447.md) K I. 97, 15 foll.
According to Jílí, the Gospel was revealed to Jesus in Syriac, and its
opening words are *Bismi ’l-ab wa ’l-umm wa ’l-ibn*, "In the name of the
Father and the Mother and the Son" (K I. 105, 15 foll.).

<span id="fn_446"></span>[139:6](siim14.htm#fr_448.md) Kor. 5, 116.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[139:7](siim14.htm#fr_449.md) Musil, *Arabia
Petraea*, III. 91.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[140:1](siim14.htm#fr_450.md) "The Christians
supposed that the Father was the Spirit (*al-Rúḥ*), the Mother Mary, and
the Son Jesus; then they said 'God is the Third of Three,' not knowing
that 'the Father' signifies the Name Allah, and that 'the Mother'
signifies the *Ummu ’l-Kitáb* ('the Mother of the Book,' an expression
generally understood as meaning the fundamental part of the Koran),
*i.e.*, the ground of the Essence, and that 'the Son' signifies the
Book, which is Absolute Being because it is a derivative and product of
the aforesaid ground" (K I. 105, 17 foll.).

<span id="fn_450"></span>[140:3](siim14.htm#fr_452.md) K II. 105, 16 foll.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[140:4](siim14.htm#fr_453.md) Koran, 15, 29. Jílí
declares that the entire Gospel is contained in this verse, and that the
Moslems alone have fulfilled the true doctrine of the Gospel, which is
"the manifestation of the Creator (*al-Ḥaqq*) in the creatures
(*al-khalq*)."

Jílí cites an assertion of the superiority of the saints by his
ancestor, ‘Abdu ’l-Qádir al-Jílání.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[141:5](siim14.htm#fr_459.md) On the other hand,
Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí says that the Jews believed in Jesus until he, as an
apostle, reformed the Mosaic law (*Fuṣúṣ*, 205).

<span id="fn_458"></span>[141:6](siim14.htm#fr_460.md) K II. 109, 5 foll.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[142:2](siim14.htm#fr_462.md) K I. 26, 5 from
foot. So the Logos of Philo is θεός, but not ὁ Θεός (Bigg, *Christian
Platonists of Alexandria*, 2nd ed., p. 42, note 2). Cf. Ibnu ’l-‘Arabí,
cited by Massignon, *Kitáb al-Ṭawásín*, p. 284.
