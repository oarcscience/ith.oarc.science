*Saqatní ḥumayya ’l-ḥubbi ráḥatu muqlatí  
wa-ka’sí muḥayyá man ‘ani ’l-ḥusni jallati*

(1 <span id="fr_619"></span>[1](#fn_617).md) The hand of mine eye gave me
love's strong wine to drink, when my cup was the face of Her that
transcendeth beauty,

(2 <span id="fr_620"></span>[2](#fn_618).md) And in my drunkenness, by
means of a glance I caused my comrades to fancy that it was the quaffing
of their wine that gladdened my inmost soul,

(3 <span id="fr_621"></span>[3](#fn_619).md) Although mine eyes made me
independent of my cup, and my inebriation was derived from her
qualities, not from my wine;

(4 <span id="fr_622"></span>[4](#fn_620).md) Therefore in the tavern of my
intoxication was the hour of my thanksgiving to youths through whom my
love was completely hidden notwithstanding my celebrity (as a lover).

(5 <span id="fr_623"></span>[5](#fn_621).md) And when my sobriety was
ended, I sought union with her, and no restraint of fear affected me in
my boldness towards her,

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

(6 <span id="fr_624"></span>[6](#fn_622).md) And in the privacy of bridal
unveiling, when no continuance of self-regard was beside me as a
watcher, I declared to her that which I felt,

(7 <span id="fr_625"></span>[7](#fn_623).md) And I said—my state bearing
witness to my ardent love, and my finding her (in my heart) effacing me,
whilst my losing her brings me back to myself

(8 <span id="fr_626"></span>[8](#fn_624).md) "Bestow on me the glance of
one who turns for a moment, ere Love makes pass away what remains in me
(of self-existence) to see thee by.

(9 <span id="fr_627"></span>[9](#fn_625).md) And if thou forbid that I see
thee, favour mine hearing with, 'Thou shalt not (see me)': this word was
sweet to another before me;

(10 <span id="fr_628"></span>[10](#fn_626).md) For, because of my
drunkenness, I have need of a recovery (from drunkenness) which, but for
passion, would not break my heart.

(11 <span id="fr_629"></span>[11](#fn_627).md) Had the mountains felt what
I suffer, and were Sinai amongst them, they would have been razed to the
earth ere the revelation

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

\(12\) A passion that only tears betrayed, and an inward ardency that
increased the burning heats whose maladies brought me to ruin.

(13 <span id="fr_630"></span>[13](#fn_628).md) The Flood of Noah is like my
tears, when I lament, and the blazing of Abraham's fire is like my
bosom's glow.

\(14\) But for my sighs, I should be drowned by my tears; and but for my
tears, I should be burned by my sighs.

\(15\) That (grief) which Jacob uttered is the least of my sorrow, and
all the woe of Job is but a part of my affliction;

\(16\) And the last sufferings of those who loved unto death are but a
part of what I suffered in the beginning of my tribulation.

(17 <span id="fr_631"></span>[17](#fn_629).md) Had the ear of my guide
heard my moaning caused by pains of love-sickness which wasted my body,

\(18\) My grief would have called to his memory the bitter distress of
travellers left behind, when the camels are reined (and ready for the
journey).

\(19\) Anguish hath sorely oppressed and naughted me, and emaciation
hath laid bare the secret of my true being;

(20 <span id="fr_632"></span>[20](#fn_630).md) And in complaining of my
leanness I made him who spied upon me my confidant, acquainting him with
the sum of my inmost feelings and with the particulars of my way (in
love).

(21 <span id="fr_633"></span>[21](#fn_631).md) I appeared to him as an
idea, while my body was in such case that he saw it not, because of the
woeful burning of love that consumed it;

(22 <span id="fr_634"></span>[22](#fn_632).md) And though my tongue spake
not, the hidden conceptions of my soul revealed to his ear the mystery
of that which my soul had concealed from him,

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

\(23\) And his ear became for my thought a mind, so that my thought was
moving in his ear, which thereby stood him in stead of ocular vision;

(24 <span id="fr_635"></span>[24](#fn_633).md) And he gave news of me to
those in the tribe, setting forth my inward state, for he knew me well.

\(25\) ’Twas as though the Recording Angels had come down to his heart
to inspire him with knowledge of what was written in my book (the book
of my experience).

\(26\) He would not have known what I was covering and what was the
guarded secret that my bosom hid,

\(27\) But the drawing aside of the bodily veil disclosed the secret,
which it had screened from him, of my inmost soul.

\(28\) And I should have been invisible to him in respect of my secret
unless my groans arising from the weakness of emaciation had divulged
it,

(29 <span id="fr_636"></span>[29](#fn_634).md) So that I was made visible
by a malady that hid me from him: there is no strange thing but Love
brings it to pass.

(30 <span id="fr_637"></span>[30](#fn_635).md) A sore anguish o’erwhelmed
me, at whose stroke the suggestions of my soul—suggestions that betrayed
me, like tears—vanished into nothingness.

\(31\) If hateful death had sought me, it would not have known where I
was, since I was concealed by concealing my love for thee (or 'by thy
love's concealing me').

(32 <span id="fr_638"></span>[32](#fn_636).md) Betwixt yearning and longing
I passed away, whilst thou didst either avert thyself in repulse or
display thyself in presence.

(33 <span id="fr_639"></span>[33](#fn_637).md) And were my heart sent back
to me from thy court, to redeem my passing-away, it would not desire the
abode of my exile.

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

\(34\) That whereof I declare unto thee a part is (only) the
frontispiece of my state: ’tis beyond my power to express what lies
underneath;

(35 <span id="fr_640"></span>[35](#fn_638).md) And, being unable, I refrain
from (speaking of) many matters; they shall not be recounted by my
speech, and even if I told them, they would be few.

(36 <span id="fr_641"></span>[36](#fn_639).md) My cure drew nigh unto
death; nay, passion decreed that it should die, since the cooling of my
thirst finds the heat of my burning drought (still remaining).

(37 <span id="fr_642"></span>[37](#fn_640).md) And my heart is more
threadbare than the garments of my endurance; nay, my selfhood is linked
with my pleasure in respect of its being reduced to naught.

(38 <span id="fr_643"></span>[38](#fn_641).md) Had God revealed me to my
visitors (as I really am), and had they ascertained from the Tablet how
much of me Love had allowed to survive,

(39 <span id="fr_644"></span>[39](#fn_642).md) Their eyes would not have
beheld anything of me except a spirit pervading the garments of a dead
man.

(40 <span id="fr_645"></span>[40](#fn_643).md) And ever since my tracks
were obliterated and I wandered distraught, I had vain imaginings about
my existence, but my thought could not lay hold upon it.

(41 <span id="fr_646"></span>[41](#fn_644).md) And after this, my feelings
(of love) for thee became self-subsistent

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (independent of my
phenomenal being): my proof is the fact that my spirit existed before my
mortal frame.

\(42\) I told how I fared in my love of thee, not because impatience
made me weary of my sufferings, but in order to assuage my grief.

\(43\) ’Tis good to show fortitude towards enemies, but in the presence
of loved ones aught save weakness is unseemly.

\(44\) The excellence of my patience keeps me from complaining, though
if I complained to my enemies of what I feel, they would do away with my
complaint.

\(45\) And the issue of my patience in loving thee is praiseworthy if I
endure the sorrows thou layest on me; but if I endure to be separated
from thee, it is not praiseworthy.

(46 <span id="fr_647"></span>[46](#fn_645).md) Whatever woe befalls me is a
favour, inasmuch as my purpose holds firm against breaking my vows;

\(47\) So for every pain in love, when it arises from thee, I give
thanks instead of complaining.

\(48\) Ay, and if the agonies of passion do me despite, yet are they
reckoned in love as a kindness;

(49 <span id="fr_648"></span>[49](#fn_646).md) And my unhappiness, nay, my
tribulation is a bounty when wrought by thee, and my raiment of hardship
worn for thy sake is the most ample of felicities.

(50 <span id="fr_649"></span>[50](#fn_647).md) My ancient fealty to thee
caused me to regard the worst of slaves, who were bestowed on me (by
thee), as the best of treasures.

(51 <span id="fr_650"></span>[51](#fn_648).md) One of them a railer and one
a slanderer: the former leads

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

me astray because of vainglory, while the latter talks foolishness about
me because of jealousy.

(52 <span id="fr_651"></span>[52](#fn_649).md) I oppose that one in his
blame, from fear (of God), and I ally myself with this one in his
meanness, from caution.

\(53\) And my face was not turned from thy path by dread of that which I
encountered, nor by any harm that smote me therein,

\(54\) Although in bearing what hath befallen me on account of thee I
have no patience that tends to praise of me or to the lauding of my
love;

(55 <span id="fr_652"></span>[55](#fn_650).md) But thy beauty, which calls
to thee (every heart), ordained that I should endure all that I have
told and all the sequel of my tale to its farthest length.

\(56\) It was only because thou appearedst to mine eye with the most
perfect qualities, surpassing (mortal) loveliness;

\(57\) And thou madest my tribulation an ornament to me and gavest it a
free hand over me, and coming from thee it was the most glorious of
distinctions;

(58 <span id="fr_653"></span>[58](#fn_651).md) For when one is snared by
Beauty, methinks his soul (even) from the most delicious life is
(gladly) rendered up to death.

\(59\) A soul that thinks to meet with no suffering in love, when it
addresses itself to love, is spurned.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

(60 No spirit that was given repose ever gained love, nor did any soul
that desired a tranquil life ever win devotion.

(61 <span id="fr_654"></span>[61](#fn_652).md) Tranquillity! how far is it
from the life of a lover! The garden of Eden is compassed about with
terrors.

(62 <span id="fr_655"></span>[62](#fn_653).md) Mine is a noble soul—a soul
that would not forget thee even though thou shouldst offer it, on
condition of forgetting thee, what is beyond its wishes;

\(63\) A soul that would not let go the true love I bear, even though it
were removed far (from thee) by scorn and absence and hatred and the
cutting off of hope.

\(64\) I have no way of departing from my Way in love, and if ever I
shall turn aside from it, I shall abandon my religion;

\(65\) And had a thought of fondness towards any one save thee come into
my mind unawares, I should have pronounced myself a heretic.

\(66\) ’Tis for thee to give judgment in my case. Do as thou wilt, for
my feeling towards thee was ever desire, not aversion.

\(67\) I swear by the firm pact of love between us, which was not
alloyed with any imagination of annulment—and ’tis the best of oaths—

\(68\) And by thy taking the covenant of troth in a place where I did
not appear in such a form that my soul was clothed in the shadow of my
clay,

(69 <span id="fr_656"></span>[69](#fn_654).md) And by the primal pledge
that never was changed since I

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

plighted it, and by the succeeding bond that was too solemn for any
frailty to loose,

(70 <span id="fr_657"></span>[70](#fn_655).md) And by the rising of thy
radiant countenance, whose splendour caused all the full moons to become
invisible,

(71 <span id="fr_658"></span>[71](#fn_656).md) And by the attribute of
perfection in thee, from which the fairest and shapeliest form in
creation drew support,

\(72\) And by the quality of thy majesty with which my torment is
pleasant to me and my being slain is sweet;

\(73\) And by the mystery of thy beauty, whereby all loveliness in the
world is manifested and fulfilled;

\(74\) And by thy comeliness which captivates the mind and which guided
me to a love wherein my abasement for thy glory's sake was comely;

(75 <span id="fr_659"></span>[75](#fn_657).md) And by an idea in thee
beyond comeliness—an idea which I beheld through itself, too subtle to
be apprehended by the eye of perception:

\(76\) Verily, thou art the desire of my heart, and the end of my
search, and the goal of my aim, and my choice and my chosen.

(77 <span id="fr_660"></span>[77](#fn_658).md) I disrobed myself of modesty
and deprecation, clothing myself in shamelessness, rejoicing in my
disrobing and in my robe;

\(78\) And ’tis my duty to cast off modesty for thy sake, even though my
folk shrink from approaching me; and shamelessness is my law.

(79 <span id="fr_661"></span>[79](#fn_659).md) And no folk of mine are
they, so long as they find fault with my recklessness and show hatred
and deem it right to abuse me for thy sake.

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

(80 <span id="fr_662"></span>[80](#fn_660).md) My fellows in the religion
of love are those who love; and they have approved my ignominy and
thought well of my disgrace.

(81 <span id="fr_663"></span>[81](#fn_661).md) Let who will be wroth, save
only thee: there is no harm (in their anger), when the noble of my kin
are pleased with me.

(82 <span id="fr_664"></span>[82](#fn_662).md) If the ascetics are
fascinated by some of the beauties that are thine, everything in thee is
the source of my fascination.

(83 <span id="fr_665"></span>[83](#fn_663).md) And I never was bewildered
until I chose love of thee as a religion. Woe is me for my bewilderment,
had it not been on account of thee!"

\(84\) She said, "Another's love thou hast sought and hast taken the
wrong path, forsaking in thy blindness the highway unto me.

\(85\) And the imposture of a soul that cherished vain desires beguiled
thee so that thou saidst what thou saidst, putting on thereby the shame
of falsehood,

(86 <span id="fr_666"></span>[86](#fn_664).md) And didst covet the most
precious of boons with a soul that crossed its bound and trespassed.

\(87\) How wilt thou win my love, which is the best of affections, by
means of pretence, which is the worst of qualities?

(88 <span id="fr_667"></span>[88](#fn_665).md) Where is Suhá to a man blind
from birth who in his

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

confusion has forgotten what he seeks? Nay, thy vain hopes have duped
thee,

(89 <span id="fr_668"></span>[89](#fn_666).md) So that thou stoodest in a
position to which thy rank was inferior, on a foot that overstepped not
its own province,

\(90\) And soughtest a thing towards which how many stretched out their
necks and were beheaded!

(91 <span id="fr_669"></span>[91](#fn_667).md) Thou didst come to tents
which are not entered by their back parts and whose doors are closed
against the knocking of one like thee;

(92 <span id="fr_670"></span>[92](#fn_668).md) And thou didst lay (as an
offering) before thy converse (with me) mere tinsel, aiming thereby at a
glory whose ends are hard to reach;

(93 <span id="fr_671"></span>[93](#fn_669).md) And thou camest to woo my
pure love with a shining face, not letting thine honour be lost in this
world or in the next;

(94 <span id="fr_672"></span>[94](#fn_670).md) But hadst thou been with me
as the *kasra* below the dot of the letter b, thou wouldst have been
raised to a rank that thine own effort did not gain for thee,

\(95\) Where thou wouldst see that what thou didst (formerly) regard is
not worth a thought, and that what thou didst provide is no (sufficient)
provision.

(96 <span id="fr_673"></span>[96](#fn_671).md) To those who are rightly
guided the straight road unto me is plain, but all men are made blind by
their desires.

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

\(97\) It is time that I reveal (the nature of) thy love, and who it is
that hath wasted thee, by a denial of thy claim to love me.

(98 <span id="fr_674"></span>[98](#fn_672).md) Thou art sworn to love, but
to love of self: amongst my proofs (of this) is the fact that thou
sufferest one of thy attributes to remain in existence.

(99 <span id="fr_675"></span>[99](#fn_673).md) For thou lov’st me not, so
long as thou hast not passed away in me; and thou hast not passed away,
so long as my form is not seen within thee.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_617"></span>[199:1](siim19.htm#fr_619) (1.md) *I.e.* "my love
arose from contemplation of Divine Beauty, which transcends phenomenal
beauty" (*ḥusn*). Cf. p. 90, note 1.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[199:2](siim19.htm#fr_620) (2.md) "In order to
disguise my love and to guard myself against reproach, I let my
comrades, *i.e.* the worshippers of material beauty, suppose that my
love was of the same kind as theirs."

<span id="fn_619"></span>[199:3](siim19.htm#fr_621) (3.md) "But in fact my
vision of Divine Beauty took away all desire to behold the form in which
material beauty is contained, like wine in a cup." So K. rightly
explains the verse, regarding *al-ḥadaq* (properly, "the blacks of the
eyes") as equivalent to *ḥadaqí*, "my eyes." N., however, understands by
*al-ḥadaq* "the darkness of phenomenal being" and by *qadaḥí* ("my cup")
the Divine Essence (cf. verse 1). According to his interpretation, the
poet means to say that whereas he formerly saw only the Divine Reality,
and not phenomena, he had now reached the higher stage of seeing
phenomena in their true relation to that Reality—a relation symbolised
by his description of them as the black of the all-encompassing Divine
eye.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[199:4](siim19.htm#fr_622) (4.md) "I render thanks
to the votaries of vulgar love"—the "youths" are the "comrades" of verse
2—"because my being confused with them enables me to hide my love from
the ignorant, though its real nature is well-known to mystics." N. gives
an unsuitable explanation, *viz*. "In my ecstasy I praised the
illustrious theosophists who taught me the mysteries of Divine Love,
which are hidden from the vulgar."

<span id="fn_621"></span>[199:5](siim19.htm#fr_623) (5.md) The intoxication
of ecstasy is associated with unreserve (*basṭ*); restraint (*qabḍ*) is
characteristic of the return to consciousness (sobriety).

<span id="fn_622"></span>[200:6](siim19.htm#fr_624) (6.md) Prof. Nallino
(*op. cit.* p. 68) proposes to take *baqá* as an accusative of duration,
but this seems to me unnecessary. The poet likens the continuance of
self-regard—*ḥaẓẓ* = *ḥaẓẓu ’l-nafs* (see Glossary to the *Kitáb
al-Luma‘*)—to the watcher (*raqíb*) who prevents the lover from gaining
access to the beloved.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[200:7](siim19.htm#fr_625) (7.md) The illuminated
mystic suffers an effacement (*maḥw*) of his human attributes. The
restoration (*ithbát*) of these attributes coincides with the
occultation of the Divine light in his heart.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[200:8](siim19.htm#fr_626) (8.md) "Let me behold
thee, ere my rapture makes me one with thee, so that I can no more
behold thee."

<span id="fn_625"></span>[200:9](siim19.htm#fr_627) (9.md) "If thou wilt
not grant me vision, at least let me hear thee deny it to me, as thou
didst once deny it to Moses (Kor. 7, 139)."

<span id="fn_626"></span>[200:10](siim19.htm#fr_628) (10.md) "Inasmuch as I
desire vision, which cannot be attained in the state of drunkenness
(entire loss of self-consciousness), I have need of a return to
sobriety; yet sobriety brings with it repentance (*tawba*)—as Moses, on
coming out of his swoon, cried, 'Glory to thee! I turn to thee with
repentance' (Kor. 7, 140)—and a renewal of the anguish of love"
(described in the following verses). The "recovery" which the poet
desires is not the heartbreaking relapse into normal consciousness after
ecstasy, but the state of *abnormal* consciousness and clairvoyance
(technically known as "the second sobriety" or "the second separation")
which is characteristic of the unitive life at its highest level. Cf.
notes on *vv*. 213-4. 233-5, 479.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[200:11](siim19.htm#fr_629) (11.md) This verse
alludes to the same passage of the Koran: "And when Moses came at our
appointed time and his Lord spake unto him, Moses said, 'O Lord! let me
see, that I may behold thee.' God answered, 'Thou shalt not see me, but
look towards the mountain: if it stand firm in its place, then shalt
thou see me.' But when his Lord revealed himself to the mountain, he
razed it to the earth, and Moses fell in a swoon."

<span id="fn_628"></span>[201:13](siim19.htm#fr_630) (13.md) Abraham,
having broken his people's idols, was cast into a burning fire, which by
the command of God became cold and did him no harm (Kor. 21, 52 foll.).

<span id="fn_629"></span>[201:17](siim19.htm#fr_631) (17.md) K. explains
that the "guide" is the person who reproaches the lover and tries to
induce him to forget his beloved. According to N., the "guide" is "the
perfect spiritual director."

<span id="fn_630"></span>[201:20](siim19.htm#fr_632) (20.md) The spy
(*muráqib*) apparently signifies here the judgment or estimative faculty
(*wahm*). Cf. verse 137. "My way of love" is K.'s rendering of *síratí*.
N. defines it more explicitly as "my outward state," *i.e.*, acts of
worship and devotion, asceticism, piety and thanksgiving.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[201:21](siim19.htm#fr_633) (21.md) Or, reading
*waṣfan* for *ma‘nan*, "I appeared to him only in virtue of my external
attributes, such as my acts of devotion" (N.).

<span id="fn_632"></span>[201:22](siim19.htm#fr_634) (22.md) N. says: "This
is the practice of the Nagshbandís at the present day. Whilst engaged in
silent meditation, they converse spiritually and understand each other
though no word is uttered."

<span id="fn_633"></span>[202:24](siim19.htm#fr_635) (24.md) "The tribe,"
*i.e.* my Ṣúfí brethren.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[202:29](siim19.htm#fr_636) (29.md) "A malady that
hid me from him": cf. verse 21.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[202:30](siim19.htm#fr_637) (30-33.md) In these
verses the poet describes the passing-away (*faná*) of the phenomenal
self in the rapture of love. "Like tears": cf. verse 12.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[202:32](siim19.htm#fr_638) (32.md) His ecstasy
was the result of successive states of Divine manifestation (*tajallí*)
and occultation (*tawallí*). Instead of "presence" (*ḥaḍra*) N. reads
"favour" (*ḥuẓwa*).

<span id="fn_637"></span>[202:33](siim19.htm#fr_639) (33.md) According to
K., "the abode of my exile" means this phenomenal existence by which the
heart is separated from God. N., taking *li-faná’i* in the sense of *ilá
faná’i*, paraphrases the verse as follows: "If my heart were sent back
from the sphere of thy most beautiful Names (the Divine Attributes) to
the original state of non-existence in which I was before I manifested
the light of thy real Being, which is the sphere of the most beautiful
Names, it would not desire the home of my exile (*i.e.* my original
non-existence)." The poet (he says) describes this original state as
"exile," <span id="page_203">p. 203</span> because, if he returned to
it, it would seem strange to him after his long absence—a very forced
interpretation, I think.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[203:35](siim19.htm#fr_640) (35.md) "Few," *i.e.*
in comparison with the whole. Another rendering is "they would be
little," *i.e.* less than they are in reality, but this does not
preserve the natural antithesis of *kathirat<sup>in</sup>* and *qallat*.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[203:36](siim19.htm#fr_641) (36.md) "My cure was
on the point of death" (K.) or "became incurable" (N.), *i.e.* I could
not possibly be cured, because the presence of the beloved, which
relieves pain, also kindles in me a fiercer flame of love.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[203:37](siim19.htm#fr_642) (37.md) "My *faná* is
so complete that not only do I feel no pleasure but my very selfhood
(*dhát*) has vanished."

<span id="fn_641"></span>[203:38](siim19.htm#fr_643) (38.md) The "visitors"
are the sick man's friends who come to see how he is. On the Guarded
Tablet (*al-Lawḥu ’l-maḥfúẓ*) are inscribed the archetypes of all things
past, present and future.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[203:39](siim19.htm#fr_644) (39.md) "Eyes," *oculi
cordis*. "The garments of a dead man": K. says, "*i.e.* the members of
my body, which are the vesture of my dead soul (*nafs*)." The word for
"garments" (*athwáb* or *thiyáb*) sometimes has this meaning in
non-mystical Arabic poetry. Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ indicates that Love has left
in him nothing except what is immortal and incorruptible, namely, his
spirit (*rúḥ*), which belongs to the Unseen World.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[203:40](siim19.htm#fr_645) (40.md) " Since my
passing-away (*faná*) my thought searches in vain after my lost self."

<span id="fn_644"></span>[203:41](siim19.htm#fr_646) (41.md) "My love of
God is not a property of my perishable self (*nafs*), but of my spirit
(*rúḥ*); otherwise the *rúḥ* would be dependent on the (*nafs*), which
<span id="page_204">p. 204</span> is not the case, for it existed before
the creation of the body." Cf. the Tradition, "God created the spirits
two thousand years before the bodies." According to N., the poet
associates his love with his original state of nonexistence, *i.e.* when
he existed only in the eternal knowledge of God. This verse explains why
love continues after the passing-away (*faná*) of the lover.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[204:46](siim19.htm#fr_647) (46.md) The clause,
"inasmuch as, etc." conveys an intimation that it is only to the
constant lover that afflictions are favours in disguise.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[204:49](siim19.htm#fr_648) (49.md) K. says: "He
rejects the word 'unhappiness' (*shaqá*) and substitutes 'tribulation'
(*balá*), because the sufferings of love are not an unhappiness, but a
trial and probation, which is a mark of regard (*iltifát*) on the part
of the Beloved towards the lover and is therefore the very essence of
happiness."

<span id="fn_647"></span>[204:50](siim19.htm#fr_649) (50.md) "My ancient
fealty": see note on verse 69. "The best of treasures," because they
were the predestined means by which my love was tried.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[204:51](siim19.htm#fr_650) (51.md) This verse is
variously read. I translate *li-‘izzat<sup>in</sup>* in the first
hemistich and *li-ghayrati* in the second. According to K., the "railer"
is <span id="page_205">p. 205</span> the Devil, who in the guise of a
candid friend seeks to draw the pilgrim into the path of sensuality,
while the "slanderer" is the Angel, who exhorts him to piety and
other-worldliness, thereby diverting him from his love of the Divine
Essence. Cf. the passage in the Koran (2, 28), where the angels, being
jealous of Adam, maligned him and said to God, "Wilt Thou place on the
earth (as Thy vicegerent) one who will do evil there?" See also note on
verse 400.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[205:52](siim19.htm#fr_651) (52.md) "I resist the
Devil because I should be separated from God, if I were to succumb to
his wiles; but not the Angel, because I am afraid of letting him know my
real aspiration." The Angel is described as "mean," for he attributes
the love and wrath of God to secondary causes, such as obedience and
disobedience—he thinks, *e.g.*, that Adam's sin was the cause of his
incurring the Divine anger—whereas in truth God's love and wrath are
eternal and uncaused. The poet, though professing to agree with the
Angel, keeps to himself the higher knowledge to which none but mystics
can attain, who love God not as the Lord of Paradise, but as the Essence
of all that exists.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[205:55](siim19.htm#fr_652) (55-57.md) " Thy
beauty called me to union with thee, and since union with thee requires
complete detachment from the phenomenal self—a result which cannot be
secured without much suffering—thou didst cause my suffering to appear
to me in the form of thy beauty."

<span id="fn_651"></span>[205:58](siim19.htm#fr_653) (58.md) "Death,"
*i.e.* *faná*.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[206:61](siim19.htm#fr_654) (61.md) "The garden of
Eden, etc.": this sentence is borrowed from a Tradition of the
Prophet—"Paradise is encompassed with things disliked, and Hell with
things desired," *i.e.* Paradise is reached only by passing through
painful experiences.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[206:62](siim19.htm#fr_655) (62.md) "A noble
soul": literally, "the soul of a free man." Freedom (*ḥurriyya*), as a
mystical term, denotes emancipation from the bondage of creatureliness.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[206:69](siim19.htm#fr_656) (69.md) K. identifies
"the primal pledge" with "the covenant of troth" mentioned in the
preceding verse. This refers to a passage of the Koran (7, 171) where it
is written that God, having drawn forth from the loins of Adam all the
future generations of mankind, said to them, "Am not I your Lord?" and
received the answer, "Yea," which (according to the Ṣúfí interpretation)
sealed the covenant of mutual love between God and His creatures. "The
succeeding bond," into which they entered after their souls had been
joined to their bodies, is the bond of Islam contracted through the
mediation of the prophets. N. most unreasonably explains "the primal
pledge" as the pledge given by Mohammed's vicegerents and companions to
accept his religion, and "the succeeding bond" as the solemn vow made by
Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ to his spiritual directors that he would be steadfast in
the Mohammedan faith.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[207:70](siim19.htm#fr_657) (70.md) As the moon is
hidden by its nearness to the sun on the last night of the lunar month,
so the Divine attributes are eclipsed by the splendour of the Essence
which reveals them.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[207:71](siim19.htm#fr_658) (71-73.md) In these
verses the poet describes the three main aspects, in one or other of
which all the Divine attributes, except those that are purely essential,
may be regarded: *viz*. perfection (*kamál*), majesty (*jalál*), and
beauty (*jamál*). "The fairest and shapeliest form" is the Perfect Man
(*al-insánu ’l-kámil*), who was created in God's image. "Fulfilled,"
*i.e.* through the love that Divine beauty inspires.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[207:75](siim19.htm#fr_659) (75.md) "An idea in
thee beyond comeliness" (*ḥusn*). *i.e.* Absolute Beauty (*jamál*).

<span id="fn_658"></span>[207:77](siim19.htm#fr_660) (77.md) K. omits this
verse, which is certainly spurious (see Nallino, *op. cit.* p. 56).
Having translated it, I let it stand, as its removal would alter the
numeration of the verses from this point to the end of the poem.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[207:79](siim19.htm#fr_661) (79.md) "They who find
fault, etc." *i.e.* the exoteric Ṣúfís, who devote themselves to
asceticism and religious works and dislike mystical enthusiasm.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[208:80](siim19.htm#fr_662) (80.md) The
commentators say that Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ alludes here to the school of Ṣúfís
who are known as the Malámatís, because they deliberately acted in such
a way as to incur blame (*malámat*). See *Kashf al-Maḥjúb*
(translation), pp. 62-9.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[208:81](siim19.htm#fr_663) (81.md) According to
K., the words "when the noble of my kin, etc." are a half-verse composed
by another poet and inserted by Ibnu ’l-Fáriḍ as a quotation (*taḍmín*).

<span id="fn_662"></span>[208:82](siim19.htm#fr_664) (82.md) While ascetics
love God for His mercy and for the blessings which He bestows on them
now and hereafter, true mystics love Him for all His attributes, since
they behold the beauty of His essence in all His manifestations—in His
wrath and vengeance no less than in His mercy and forgiveness.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[208:83](siim19.htm#fr_665) (83.md) Bewilderment
(*ḥayra*) when caused by letting the eye wander in different directions,
is pernicious; but praiseworthy, when it is the result of gazing
concentratedly on the beauty of the Beloved. The latter is
characteristic of one who has lost himself in Divine contemplation. "O
Lord, increase my bewilderment!" was a famous Ṣúfí's prayer.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[208:86](siim19.htm#fr_666) (86.md) "The most
precious of boons," *i.e.* Divine Love. "Crossed its bound," because the
appetitive soul (*nafs*) has no object beyond its own gratification.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[208:88](siim19.htm#fr_667) (88.md) To win Divine
Love by false pretences is as impossible as to be blind and see the star
Suhá, which is so small and obscure that only the keenest sight can
descry it.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[209:89](siim19.htm#fr_668) (89.md) "On a foot,
etc." *i.e.* relying on thy lower self (*nafs*), which never transcends
the sphere of its selfish interests.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[209:91](siim19.htm#fr_669) (91.md) Cf. Kor. 2,
185: "It is not righteousness that ye should come into houses (tents) by
the back parts thereof." The back parts of the House of Love, through
which none can enter it, are egoism and self-conceit; the door that lets
in those worthy of admission is self-abandonment (*faná*).

<span id="fn_668"></span>[209:92](siim19.htm#fr_670) (92.md) " Instead of
being ready to sacrifice thy existence as an individual in the hope of
attaining unto me, thou broughtest me nothing but thine own acts and
words and feelings."

<span id="fn_669"></span>[209:93](siim19.htm#fr_671) (93.md) The true lover
has no regard for his name and fame. Cf. the Tradition, "Spiritual
poverty is blackness of the face in both worlds."

<span id="fn_670"></span>[209:94](siim19.htm#fr_672) (94.md) "As the
*kasra*, etc." *i.e.* having no independent existence, but subsisting
only through God. *Kasra* is the vowel *i*, which is always written
under the consonant that it belongs to. The letter *b* (ب) denotes the
form of phenomenal being, just as the letter *a* (ا) denotes the form of
Real Being; while the dot of the *b* symbolises contingency as opposed
to absoluteness. Hence the mystical saying, "Existence was manifested by
means of *b*, and the worshipper was distinguished from the Worshipped
by means of the dot."

<span id="fn_671"></span>[209:96](siim19.htm#fr_673) (96.md) "The straight
road," *i.e.* selflessness (*faná*).

<span id="fn_672"></span>[210:98](siim19.htm#fr_674) (98.md) "One of thy
attributes," because an attribute implies a subject in which it inheres;
and that subject is thy "self" (*nafs*), one of whose attributes is the
desire to enjoy vision and contemplation of God. N. quotes the saying of
Abú ’l-Ḥasan al-Shádhilí, "The desire of union with God is one of the
things that most effectually separate from God."

<span id="fn_673"></span>[210:99](siim19.htm#fr_675) (99.md) Real love is
nothing less than *faná*, which is here defined as the appearance of
Divine attributes in the lover (K.) or God's unveiling Himself in the
mystic's heart (N.).
