Not many primary Shiite texts were translated into English during the
19th century. The following are translations of Shiite documents,
prepared by a volunteer for sacred-texts \[TJ\]. The views expressed are
those of the translator, and the translations are presented without any
editing. The copyright status of these texts is dubious, so these files
are made available here for research purposes only, not for
republication.
