<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">What</span> pleasure shall the dead in heart take in beauty's display?<br> With Layl&#257;'s blandishments, what shall Majn&#363;n's image do?</p>  
<p>When, like unto the gazelle, they will not be familiar with any one,<br> What shall the effect of constancy with those bright eyes do?</p>  
<p>The appliances of joy and pleasure were useless, unto the forsaken:<br> With the arrival of the morning's breeze, what shall the turban's chaplet do?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_349"></A><A HREF="#fn_349"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Since, like unto the dawn of morning, his garment may be rent,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_350"></A><A HREF="#fn_350"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A><br> How can one, as this so infamous, his condition conceal?</p>  
<p>They never derive any share whatever of hands and feet,<br> What then shall the world of fishes with the &#7717;inn&#257;'s bright dye do?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_351"></A><A HREF="#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Folly and vanity have made thee lighter even than the bubble:<br> What shall the foaming of the ocean towards thy weight and power do?</p>

<p>Nourish not the hope, O Alexander! that it will to thee be constant:<br> Behold, what the vicissitudes of fortune shall unto Darius do!</p>  
<p>By the violence of its ravages, the whole hath been to ruin brought,<br> Otherwise, in the desert, what doth the litter of its camel do?</p>  
<p>Did he, like unto a falcon, soar in air, then it might avail;<br> But what shall the restraint of that net, now, unto <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span> do?</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">II.</h3>  
<p>Obtain for thy requirements the dun steed of the waves!<br> In the arena of the flood, practice the horsemanship of the waves!</p>  
<p>The meek and humble, like the oyster, have the pearl acquired;<br> But naught of pearl's merchandise, beareth the caravan of the waves.</p>  
<p>The lowly and humble are more powerful than the haughty and proud:<br> In the bonds of ocean, for ever confined, will be the rolling of the waves.</p>  
<p>The obstinate and refractory are by the meek and humble subdued:<br> The ground-kisser unto the sea-shore is the tempest of the waves.</p>  
<p>See, at what time they will swallow the dark earth altogether,<br> On the water's rolling throne seated, the kings of the waves.</p>  
<p>Trouble not the inexperienced and incompetent with thy affairs:<br> For upon the target of the waters, become bent the arrows of the waves.</p>  
<p>Woe and affliction are salutary to the mind of the heart-broken;<br> For firmly fixed, the flood upon, is the foundation of the waves.</p>  
<p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="green">p. 310</font></A></p>  
<p>They are the ups and downs of the world: O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span>, behold them!<br> Rising and falling, without ceasing, is the world of the waves!</p>  <h4 align="center">III.</h4>  
<p>Thou hast cast loose the dark tresses about that fair face of thine:<br> Thou hast, time after time, desolated the world's dwelling-places!</p>  
<p>Thou hast not left one unscathed, the whole land within;<br> With the sword of amorous glances armed, whom now smitest thou?</p>  
<p>Since from the sun of thy beauty, the veil hath been drawn aside,<br> The mart of love, the world within, thou wilt with bustle fill again.</p>  
<p>Thou hast subdued the whole land with thy beauty and goodness:<br> Thy slaves thou wilt make all the fair ones of Hind.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>My phrenzy, O physician! will not in the least decrease:<br> Thine own rose thou wilt make even spring itself for me.</p>  
<p>Since upon the target of the heart they so like straight ones strike,<br> How many wilt thou cause to groan from thine eyelashes&#8217; crooked darts?</p>  
<p>Worthless himself, thou wilt draw demented <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span> to thy side again,<br> Shouldst thou even fill thy skirt with stones equal to a mountain in bulk.</p>  <h4 align="center">IV.</h4>  
<p>Art thou come again in search of roses, thou seller of flowers!<br> That not a bird of the parterre ceaseth lamentation to make?</p>

<p>A bubble of the broad ocean is every one of its bells:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> The kar-w&#257;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> moveth along silently, this desert within.</p>  
<p>In its desire to attain it, with its own blood it became tinged;<br> Yet still Both not the ruby reach unto the lobe of the ear?</p>  
<p>Sometimes rising, sometimes falling, like the Pleiades they go:<br> How many inebriated ones have from thy banquet gone forth?</p>  
<p>For thy sake, I would dye my garment of the colour of the rose;<br> Still, like unto perfume, it would from my bosom escape.</p>  
<p>Draw near, and behold the black intoxication of her tresses,<br> That without the shoulder,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> cannot proceed a step on the road.</p>  
<p>The heart of the vortex like unto a millstone might split;<br> Since fortune, towards <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span>, hath so unrelenting become!</p>  <h4 align="center">V.</h4>  
<p>Everywhere the lords of love have become disgraced and dishonoured;<br> And neither tone nor harmony, absolutely, hath the rebeck of love.</p>  
<p>Like as the dew, the mountain of &#7730;&#257;f it will displace also,<br> If the sun of love should rise over the head thereof.</p>  
<p>What shall I say unto thee regarding this wave of calamity,<br> When equal to the firmament itself is the bubble of love?</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>That heart, which may for itself love's ermine acquire,<br> The vicissitudes of it are changed into peace and repose.</p>  
<p>The thoughts of her, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span>! will never leave my heart;<br> For such a countenance I have beheld in the dream of love!</p>  <h4 align="center">VI.</h4>  
<p>Again thou bringest thy dishevelled tresses thy face about:<br> Or the hyacinth, in the spring, disordereth its curled petals.</p>  
<p>It must have been the insolence of the comb, and the wind's pertness;<br> For the locks of the dear one are not without cause deranged.</p>  
<p>Look at them! what a wondrous moon-like circle are they!<br> The curls wreathed round the face of that gay, but imperious one.</p>  
<p>To-day, from the arena, a new source of evil hath come;<br> Since thou hast brought the curls of dust upon thy face.</p>  
<p>Like unto the comb, acquire a conception discerning;<br> For the ringlets of my rhymes a hair-like fineness have.</p>  
<p>Although, from their exceeding length, they reach the ground,<br> Still, through coquetry, they place not their feet straight the path upon.</p>  
<p>In what way shall <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span> become released from their noose,<br> When the curls, with a single hair, the lions of the forest bind?</p>  <h4 align="center">VII.</h4>  
<p>In such manner, am I happy from the world apart,<br> That, like the forest's beasts, I am happy the desert within.</p>  
<p><a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="green">p. 313</font></A></p>  
<p>Rather than that I should behold the land of the sea-shore,<br> Like the billow, I am happy, wandering the waters upon.</p>  
<p>When from the morsels thereon the hungry flies are driven,<br> With an invitation to that table, how can I happy be?</p>  
<p>Since, like unto the sun's, its countenance is not warm,<br> I swear by thy head if, with the &#7716;um&#257;'s shadow,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> I am happy!</p>  
<p>When, like unto the partridge, it confined me in a cage,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A><br> Than such laughter, with lamentation, I am more happy by far.</p>  
<p>Though, like unto a picture, it awakened not from its sleep,<br> In this state, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span>! with mine own lot, I am happy.</p>  <h4 align="center">VIII.</h4>  
<p>Since, like the reed-pen, I have my head resigned,<br> I am now in search of these fair and charming ones.</p>  
<p>This fire is from the glances of those bright eyes of thine,<br> Whereby I am burnt as black as those their dark lashes.</p>  
<p>From the time when my heart became the home of these brunettes,<br> Behold me! I am, as it were, a new Hind&#363;st&#257;n grown!</p>  
<p>I vow by the hundred-times-rent vitals of the comb,<br> That I am more disordered even than the curls, in grief for thee!</p>  
<p>From terror of the autumn, I am unable to look upon the rose:<br> I am shaking in this flower-garden, like the willow unto.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></A></p>  
<p>Though my flight is in the air; yet I was not released:<br> I am still of that graceful cypress the neck-enchained slave.</p>  
<p>Like unto dust she carried me away, and showed no concern:<br> Of such a fiery steed as this, the attached skirt-holder am I.</p>  
<p>With Indian requital, such acts she practiseth on me&#8212;<br> Me, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span>! who in heart am a poor simple Af<u>gh</u>&#257;n of Roh.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  <h4 align="center">IX.</h4>  
<p>Since from their complainings, its bells have not ceased,<br> The caravan must still be wandering this desert within.</p>  
<p>What can beauty's splendour, with defective sight effect?<br> The mirror itself is amazed and astonished at the world.</p>  
<p>From their eyes' wildness their intimacy cannot be gained:<br> The herd of gazelles, at the sight of the shepherd, taketh to flight.</p>  
<p>What! hath Farhad&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> caused the covey of partridges to weep,<br> That from the mountains they come&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> with eyes all inflamed?</p>  
<p>I perceive the manner of her gait, like unto the zephyr:<br> She is again stepping gracefully, and is on slaughter bent.</p>  
<p>From the time I became occupied in regarding the spring,<br> Naught was gained by me thereby, save sorrow and regret.</p>  
<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="green">p. 315</font></A></p>  
<p>Many were the wailings from its rose-trees&#8217; every branch;<br> In sorrow and mourning for it, many were the garments rent.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_361"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Like unto the waves, it riseth and falleth continually:<br> How then, from the world, canst thou aught of constancy hope?</p>  
<p>Like unto the bubble, he wandereth in every direction, all forlorn;<br> Since <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span> from his home and friends a wanderer became!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="#fn_362"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  <h4 align="center">X.</h4>  
<p>Unto the trysting-place my charmer very slowly cometh;<br> And the verdant spring to the parterre very slowly cometh.</p>  
<p>Now and then I perceive kindness beaming from her eyes:<br> Thou wouldst say that the languid&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> ever very slowly cometh.</p>  
<p>The dread of ill is a far greater slaughterer than ill itself:<br> The sanguinary one, to shed my blood very slowly cometh.</p>  
<p>The partridge, for this reason, hath from laughing become purple,<br> That to make him her game, the graceful one very slowly cometh.</p>  
<p>What! can separation, of his vigour, poor Farhad have deprived,<br> That the cries and wails from his mountain very slowly come?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Under the weight of her majesty, the strength of Gulg&#363;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_365"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;&sect;</FONT></A> was lost;<br> Hence that Scythian&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">**</FONT></A> of graceful mien very slowly cometh.</p>

<p>Give not utterance, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span>, without reflection, to a word;<br> For every parrot, to speaking well, very slowly cometh.</p>  <h4 align="center">XI.</h4>  
<p>Although every drop of dew should be the seed of a rose,<br> The nightingales&#8217; hearts would not be satiated with beholding it.</p>  
<p>When like unto that of the rose it hath not a face so lovely,<br> What shall one then do with the hyacinth's black locks?</p>  
<p>About my dark destiny what shall I unto any one say?<br> For my forehead, like the sun's, is fit only to be branded.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_367"></A><A HREF="#fn_367"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Is it the poor wayfarer hindered by night coming on,<br> Or my heart enthralled the noose of her tresses within?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>She hath made calamity's sword as sharp as fate itself:<br> With hands imbrued she goeth about, both night and day.</p>  
<p>From the sea's cold-heartedness, the bubble bursteth and breaketh;<br> Hence it behoveth thee, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span>! to abandon all hope from thy kin.</p>  <h4 align="center">XII.</h4>  
<p>The habitations of this world behold, and begone!<br> A nest like that of the Ph&#339;nix behold, and begone!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A></p>

<p>The old in years, like little infants sport and play:<br> This very wonderful spectacle behold, and begone!</p>  
<p>Should the sun, O &#7716;um&#257;! upon my brow ever rest,<br> Do thou, in that case, my independence behold, and begone!</p>  
<p>With the torch of thine own mind, in this darkness,<br> Lightning-like, the road to follow behold, and begone!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The fish have no share in the benefit of hands or feet;<br> But their swimming in the waters behold, and begone!</p>  
<p>The wine-flask's one short hour in the convivial party,<br> With this full mouth laughing,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> behold, and begone!</p>  
<p>Every day it deceiveth <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span> with its friendship:<br> The friendship and constancy of fortune behold, and begone!</p>  <h4 align="center">XIII.</h4>  
<p>Without a meeting I shall not recover: come and sit by me!<br> Make thyself acquainted with my state: come and sit by me!</p>  
<p>Even the wild by nature have, at last, become tamed:<br> O thou gazelle, by nature wild! come and sit by me!</p>  
<p>At the desire of the nightingale, thou, faithless rose!<br> After a year comest splendid again; then come and sit by me!</p>  
<p>Like one dying, from other wounds, I ease obtain:<br> No napkin do I ask of thee; then come and sit by me!</p>

<p>With those arched eyebrows, and eyes at all times dark&#8212;<br> Thou evening and new moon of thy lover, come and sit by me!</p>  
<p>That we may together recall the days when we knew not sorrow,<br> For one short hour, dear friend! come and sit by me!</p>  
<p>The charms and beauty of thy beloved, in sweetest strains rehearse,<br> O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span>! thou of imagination fine, come and sit by me!</p>  <h4 align="center">XIV.</h4>  
<p>No sooner did spring acquainted become, with garden and with mead,<br> Than with eyes inflamed from weeping, it was separated again from them.</p>  
<p>When the gate of the caravansary of the bud shall become unclosed,<br> The caravan of dyes and perfumes departeth, and morning's breeze setteth in.</p>  
<p>The smoke of a world consumed, by the name of sky thou termest:<br> Of thy erroneous idea what shall I say? it is mere illusion and error.</p>  
<p>That which even yet remaineth a source of amazement to the world&#8212;<br> Even Majn&#363;n's name, hath come to behold the spectacle I am.</p>  
<p>From thy well-directed aim, the arrow was pointed so truly,<br> That thou wert, neither of its flight, nor of its wounding aware.</p>  
<p>It is beyond all possibility, O foolish one! to people it again;<br> For the prosperous city of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;'s</span> heart that was, hath utterly desolate become!</p>  
<p><a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="green">p. 319</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">XV.</h4>  
<p>Thou hast again unclosed those lips of thine to speak,<br> Or the parrot hath, for its dole of sugar, come again.</p>  
<p>Unto the lot of the dark-hearted falleth not ecstasy's gem:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> Where is the lump of steel? the burnished mirror where?</p>  
<p>Like as the pearl-oyster, open it at once to bestow,<br> When the indigent, at thy door, may his hand stretch forth.</p>  
<p>The rose of thy cheek is, for thy tresses, all sufficient:<br> Neither for attar, nor for ambergris, hath it any need.</p>  
<p>They, of open countenance, manifest no awe of the great;<br> For the mirror looketh even Alexander straight in the face.</p>  
<p>All praise be unto the nakedness of that bare head,<br> Which hath neither under turban nor diadem bent!</p>  
<p>From warmth, like unto quicksilver, she fleeth from me:<br> How, then, shall come to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;'s</span> arms that impassioned one?</p>  <h4 align="center">XVI.</h4>  
<p>Since I have turned my back home and family unto,<br> For other chattels or effects, what necessity have I?</p>  
<p>That for ever smooth, and without wrinkle, thy forehead may be,<br> All these troubles make thou over unto the sovereign of <u>Ch</u>&#299;n.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_373"></A><A HREF="#fn_373"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>

<p>The blood of my own heart I am well pleased to drink;<br> For the fly never approacheth near unto this tray of mine.</p>  
<p>It would not, with its consent, in the garden stay a moment:<br> &#8217;Tis well the thorn seized the rose's garment by the hem.</p>  
<p>Do hearts then trip along in the direction of thy curls;<br> Or doth the caravan of R&#363;m&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_374"></A><A HREF="#fn_374"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> unto India wend its way?</p>  
<p>How shall those eyes of thine a glance on the humble bestow,<br> When thine eyelashes, thro&#8217; arrogance, to the heavens are upturned?</p>  
<p>In those worldly dwellings of thine, may all happiness be;<br> But wandering <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span> is going to the deserts and wilds!</p>  <h4 align="center">XVII.</h4>  
<p>Thou art welcome again thou fresh festival of spring!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_375"></A><A HREF="#fn_375"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A><br> Thou hast brought joy unto every wild, and every bed of flowers!</p>  
<p>Like unto the bird within a cage, the lovelorn nightingale,<br> Even whilst yet within the egg, longeth on the wing to be.</p>  
<p>The folks&#8217; garments have been dyed of such a saffron-like hue,<br> That every bird to the parterre, filled with laughter, hath come.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_376"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Look at the rosy-bodied one in this garment arrayed,<br> Like unto the sun when he approacheth the time of his setting.</p>

<p>In the turban of every pilgrim a bouquet it will place,<br> When morning's dawn scattereth flowers into its own skirt.</p>  
<p>The nightingale's heart towards the gaudy rose is inclined,<br> Or the flask hath approached the goblet, to pour out its wine.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_377"></A><A HREF="#fn_377"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The rain of perspiration shall fall through shame therefrom,<br> When the lightning shall behold the gorgeous crop of flowers.</p>  
<p>In the same manner as the rose, the beholders of this spring<br> Have not the least necessity for attar their garments upon.</p>  
<p>The musician increaseth twofold wine's intoxicating strength,<br> When the bacchanals sit down the banquet to begin.</p>  
<p>Why, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span>! termest thou it, the oyster of the deep profound?<br> When the pearl unto thy sweet strains its ear hath given.</p>  <h4 align="center">XVIII.</h4>  
<p>What peace, in this world, doth the heart acquire,<br> Which ever quaketh and trembleth from dread of fortune's ills?</p>  
<p>Thro&#8217; separation from the departed water, O thoughtless people!<br> Like the vortex, you have made strong your hearts, your breasts within.</p>  
<p>Let not thy heart ever be unto this world's parterre given;<br> Since even the rose-bud, at last, left it heart-disordered behind.</p>  
<p>Approach! behold the weeping of agony in tears of blood:<br> Like the wine-flask, my heart to shed blood I have brought.</p>

<p>The fissure therein, by the waters, was not filled up again;<br> And the whirlpool, like an anvil, hardened its heart unto pain.</p>  
<p>Thou shalt, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span>! for flight, wings and feathers acquire,<br> If thou in the nest, like the egg, thine heart pure and spotless make.</p>  <h4 align="center">XIX.</h4>  
<p>I possess none of the chattels of tranquillity, the encampment within;<br> Since I have a tent, like the bubble, upon the face of the deep.</p>  
<p>If thou art not the owner of a single straw, grieve not thereat;<br> For then, the village-consuming fire will in thy &#7716;aram&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_378"></A><A HREF="#fn_378"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> expire.</p>  
<p>When thy face became bedewed with perspiration, by thy head I vow,<br> That therein the rose-scattering splendour of dew I beheld.</p>  
<p>'When wert thou ever shrouded the veil of retirement within?<br> Thou art manifest in all the world, like a Ph&#339;nix unto.</p>  
<p>Her eyes show not even as much regard towards me,<br> As the wild gazelle that looketh round ere it taketh to flight.</p>  
<p>&#8217;Tis needless to apply any salve to my all-sufficient wound:<br> How can the recovery' of the slaughtered be brought about?</p>  
<p>Morning and evening&#8212;day and night&#8212;with sable dress, and garment rent,<br> Like unto time itself,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_379"></A><A HREF="#fn_379"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> in sorrow and mourning my existence is spent.</p>

<p>The beautiful lineaments of her face are most amazing:<br> In this writing there is no work soever for any one's pen.</p>  
<p>His life perpetually from danger, how shall <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span> guard;<br> When the snaky curls are in total darkness shrouded ever?</p>  <h4 align="center">XX.</h4>  
<p>When thy beauty, like the sun's, bursteth forth,<br> My garment, like the morning's, becometh rent.</p>  
<p>In the society of thee, my bright-checked one!<br> My whole body, like the candle's, melteth away.</p>  
<p>That person shall never die, whose head shall be<br> Struck off, like the candle's, by the sword of love.</p>  
<p>Thy curly locks have drawn my heart towards thee:<br> The fish, by the hook, are always from the water drawn.</p>  
<p>Call him not, hard-hearted one! a statue of the hall,<br> Who in dust and blood writheth in death's agony.</p>  
<p>When, throughout the night, the rain of tears falleth,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_380"></A><A HREF="#fn_380"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> From its effects at last appeareth the dawn of day.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_381"></A><A HREF="#fn_381"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>He hath no strength to complain, who is by thy curls stricken;<br> Like unto one by a snake stung, he is speechless rendered.</p>  
<p>The desert will rend its garment's skirt to tatters,<br> Should the trembling one from thy bonds escape.</p>  
<p>Graceful words shall they write, their tablets upon,<br> Whose hearts, like the pen's, may crack and split.</p>

<p>On this account, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span> cannot look upon a comb;<br> For the derangement of thy curly locks is seen therein.</p>  <h4 align="center">XXI.</h4>  
<p>In the rolling of thine eyes the universe may have sunk,<br> Or its inhabitants may be submerged in the eddies of a flood.</p>  
<p>Since they showed no mortification at thy lips and teeth;<br> Why should not the coral and pearl thus be in ocean engulphed?</p>  
<p>I am a cotemporary of the water of those good blades,<br> Whose eyelashes may ever be in bloody tears submerged.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_382"></A><A HREF="#fn_382"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Good men hold it far preferable to the perspiration of shame,<br> That they may be swallowed in &AElig;umm&#257;n's dark waves.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_383"></A><A HREF="#fn_383"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>

<p>Upon the raft of the bier unto the shore will approach,<br> The kings who may have sunk in the throne's troubles and cares.</p>  
<p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span>! no effort to escape maketh the master-mariner,<br> Whose eyes may be submerged the ocean of tears within.</p>  <h4 align="center">XXII.</h4>  
<p>Since, like the sun, thou art the possessor of gold and silver,<br> Why art thou standing, every morning, at the door of others?</p>

<p>As with the candle, no one for my redemption endeavoureth;<br> And thou, like the snuffers, art a seeker after my head.</p>  
<p>As doth shadow on the sun's setting, follow the eyes&#8217; dark shade,<br> If thou, for a pretty one, with sunny face, a candidate art!</p>  
<p>By the slaughter of whom wilt thou, of roseate hue, thy garment dye,<br> That, to-day again, thy waist, like the rose-bud's, is girded?</p>  
<p>Like unto mince-meat, wound after wound I receive;<br> Then, wherefore art thou of my state and my case unaware?</p>  
<p>Thou didst depart like the bubble on the back of the flood<br> Than myself, O my home! a greater wanderer art thou!</p>  
<p>Thou beautiful brunette! O thou of figure so graceful!<br> The straight and verdant pine, of whose grove art thou?</p>  
<p>If in adversity thou bendest not thine head unto any one,<br> In the loftiness of thy spirit, like a dark beetling mountain art thou.</p>  
<p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><u>Sh</u>aid&#257;</span>! thou art that parrot with Indian disposition endowed,<br> That art with the confection of thine own words&#8217; roses content.</p>
