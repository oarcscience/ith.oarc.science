#### <u>KH</u>WĀJAH MUḤAMMAD, BANGA<u>SH</u>.

THE materials for a notice of this poet are extremely meagre. Little is
known about him, except that he lived in the reign of the Mu<u>gh</u>al
Emperor, Aurangzeb, and belonged to the Banga<u>kh</u> or
Banga<u>s’h</u> tribe of Af<u>gh</u>āns, who hold the valley of that
name, and of which Kohā<u>tt</u> is the chief town. The Banga<u>s’h</u>
tribe, in bygone days, made a great figure in India; and from a peasant
of it, the Nawwābs of Farru<u>kh</u>ābād, in that country, traced their
descent. <span id="fr_385"></span>[\*](#fn_385.md)

<u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad lived the life of a Darwe<u>sh</u>, in poverty
and religious abstraction, and followed the tenets of the <u>Ch</u>astī
sect. He was a disciple of Æabd-ur-Raḥīm, who was a disciple of Mī’ān
Panjū, a celebrated Ṣūfi teacher, who came originally from

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hindūstān, and
dwelt for many years in Af<u>gh</u>ānistān. He is said to have traced
his descent from the Arab devotee, Muæīn-ud-Dīn, the founder of the
<u>Ch</u>astī sect. <span id="fr_386"></span>[\*](#fn_386.md)

<u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad appears to have been a man of some learning; and
passed most of his time with his teacher or spiritual guide, already
mentioned. It is not known whether he left any descendants; for although
I despatched a person, specially, into the Banga<u>s’h</u> country to
make inquiry, I cannot now discover, with any certainty, either his
place of birth, residence, or the branch of the tribe to which he
belonged. He is known, however, to have performed the pilgrimage to
Makka and Madīnah; and that, after his return thence, he gave up writing
poetry. His Dīwān, or Collection of Odes, from which the following poems
have been selected, is a very rare book; in fact, scarcely procurable;
for, as far as I can discover, the copy to which I had access is the
only one known.

His writings are deeply tinged with the mysticisms of the Ṣūfis; but
occasionally he devotes a poem to the remembrance of lost friends, and
laments his bereavement from them.

The place and time of his decease are uncertain; and the whereabouts of
the grave in which he was buried is not now known.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_385"></span>[326:\*](spa20.htm#fr_385.md) Little did I
imagine, whilst stationed in the Panjāb a few years since, when I was
penning the notes for this short notice of a poet of the tribe, that I
should behold the last of the Nawwābs, escorted by a party of my own
regiment, conducted, on foot, with fetters on his legs, through the
streets of Nassick, in Western India (where I then was stationed in
command of a detachment), on his way to undergo perpetual banishment at
Makka, for the share he took in the massacre at Farru<u>kh</u>ābād,
during the late rebellion in India. He had been sentenced to death; but
his punishment was commuted to perpetual exile, in any place he might
select. He chose Makka in Arabia, where, I have since heard, he subsists
on alms. I spoke a few words to the wretched man at Nassick; the first
he had heard in kindness, he said, for many long days. He appeared to be
any thing but what one might expect, from all that has been proved
against him. He was rather fair, slightly made, and about thirty years
of age. To me, he appeared very wretched and heart-broken. He was only
an Af<u>gh</u>ān in name: the centuries of admixture of Indian blood, by
intermarriage with the people of the country, had left little of the
Af<u>gh</u>ān blood remaining.
