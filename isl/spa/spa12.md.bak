### A<u>SH</u>RAF <u>KH</u>ĀN, <u>KH</u>A<u>TT</u>AK.

<span class="smallcaps">A<u>sh</u>raf <u>Kh</u>ān</span>, eldest son of
<u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl <u>Kh</u>ān, the subject of the preceding notice,
was born in the year <span class="smallcaps">h.</span> 1044 (<span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1634); and when the war, which had been
carried on by his father and other Af<u>gh</u>ān chieftains, against the
Mu<u>gh</u>al Emperor, died out, <u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl, wholly
disgusted with the world, resigned the chieftainship of the
<u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>ak tribe in favour of A<u>sh</u>raf, <span
class="smallcaps">a.h.</span> 1093 (<span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>
1681.) The circumstances, which brought these matters about, having been
related at length in the notice preceding <u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl's
poems, need not be repeated here.

A<u>sh</u>raf endeavoured for some time to carry on the government of
his clan, and also to perform his duties towards the Mu<u>gh</u>al
Government, by aiding the Pe<u>s’h</u>āwar authorities in the
administration of the affairs of that province; but he was opposed and
thwarted in all his endeavours by his brother Bahrām, the same who
endeavoured to take the life of his father, who styles him "Bahrām the
Degenerate," and "The Malignant;" and by whose machinations,
A<u>sh</u>raf was, at last, betrayed into the hands of Aurangzeb, in the
year <span class="smallcaps">h.</span> 1095 (<span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1683). The affairs of the Dakhan having
called for the presence of that monarch, who continued in that part of
India for several years, the <u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>ak chief was taken along
with him, as a state prisoner; and was subsequently sent to the strong
fortress of Bijāpūr, situated in what is, at present, termed the
Southern Mahārata country, where he continued to languish in exile for
the remainder of his life. He died in the year <span
class="smallcaps">h.</span> 1105 (<span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>
1693), and in the 60th year of his age.

A<u>sh</u>raf used, occasionally, to devote some of his leisure time to
poetry, before he assumed the government of his clan, incited,
doubtless, by the example of his brave old father, and his brothers
Æabd-ul-Ḳādir and Ṣadr <u>Kh</u>ān, who were also gifted with the
"*cacoëthes scribendi*." During his exile he wrote a great number of
poems, and collected the whole, as they now stand, in the form of a
Dīwān, or Alphabetical Collection. According to the usual custom among
Eastern poets, A<u>sh</u>raf assumed the name of "The Severed" or
"Exiled;" and many of his poems, written in the most pathetic style,
plainly tell where, and under what circumstances, they were composed.
The original Dīwān, or Collection, arranged and written by himself, at
Bijāpūr, is still in the possession of his descendants, and from it the
following poems were extracted; indeed, I am not aware that any other
copy of his poems exists. A<u>sh</u>raf is regarded by the
Af<u>gh</u>āns as a good poet; but his effusions are, without reason
apparently, considered difficult and abstruse.

When Afẓal <u>Kh</u>ān, his son, became firmly established in the
chieftainship, he caused the remains of his father to be removed from
Bijāpūr to Sarā’e—where the <u>Kh</u>a<u>tt</u>ak chiefs have been
usually interred—a distance of some fifteen hundred miles.
