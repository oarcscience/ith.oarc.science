<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">O thou</span>, for ever, with the cares of the flesh, distracted!<br> Why awaken for thy soul, sleeping misfortune and calamity?</p>  
<p>The wise act not according to the counsels of their enemies:<br> Then why takest thou the advice of the devil, carnality?</p>  
<p>Have some degree of shame for this white beard of thine!<br> And, moreover, in broad day, robbery cannot be effected.</p>  
<p>Look thou well to this thine own fast fleeting breath;<br> Since to depart, every respiration raiseth the cry&#8212;Begone!</p>  
<p>For what evil are worldly goods accumulated with thee?<br> When the bees fill the comb, they are of the honey deprived.</p>  
<p>In the sight of God, as a man among men, thou art well;<br> But not, in the world's eye, a self-made <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> and Mull&#257;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>When the pus exudeth from the sore, the invalid ease obtaineth;<br> But thou, at the passing away of this world, bewailest.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p>The hand of despair he will soon place upon his hip,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> Who girdeth up his loins, in the world's people confiding.</p>  
<p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span>! the fostering of the flesh's lusts is improper;<br> For no one, surely, showeth affection for an inveterate foe!</p>  <h4 align="center">II.</h4>  
<p>This world, O friend, is neither mine nor thine!<br> It is to be left behind, and to endure after every one!</p>  
<p>Fallen into the arms of one, it laugheth and flirteth with another:<br> What an immodest, wanton harlot, indeed, is this world!</p>  
<p>Although it seemeth pretty and attractive, what then?<br> Intrinsically, and inherently, this world is a black calamity.</p>  
<p>Since there is no generous, no disinterested friendship in it,<br> Though it may seem a friend, it is an enemy, in reality.</p>  
<p>It will very speedily dash from the mountain's summit<br> Them, with whom &#8217;tis hand in glove, and cheek by jowl.</p>  
<p>It ridiculeth to their faces, its own followers, at all times;<br> For ever practising mockery and derision, is this world.</p>  
<p>In any one place of it, there is never, either rest, or tranquillity;<br> For like unto a mere shadow, and naught else, is this world.</p>  
<p>No one's affairs can be brought to completion by the light of it;<br> For this world is as the lightning, and the light of the sky.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="green">p. 89</font></A></p>  
<p>Absurdly, thou attachest thine heart to the sounds of its drum;<br> For the world is a bridal procession&#8212;the mere guest of an hour.</p>  
<p>No one hath become a gainer, by its trade and its traffic;<br> For the world is a seller of barley, though an exposer of wheat.</p>  
<p>It is not meet, that the good and great bend their steps towards it;<br> For this world is a spectacle&#8212;a mere children's show.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span>, who laugheth and is merry therein, but laugheth at himself;<br> For, indeed, the world is only a place of sorrow and of grief.</p>  <h4 align="center">III.</h4>  
<p>I know not, in the least, whether this is love, or whether fire:<br> Do I consume in it of my own choice, or is this compulsion?</p>  
<p>Is this the incurable agony of the tender passion, that thus killeth me,<br> Or a viper, for whose sting, there is neither antidote nor charm?</p>  
<p>Since I have no pretty and lovable companion by my side,<br> This is, in reality, no dwelling; it is, verily and truly, a grave!</p>  
<p>Be not disturbed, shouldst thou be reviled, on love's account;<br> For such like abuse is the acme of all greatness whatsoever.</p>  
<p>Since thou severest my heart's fibres, and leavest none sound,<br> Are these the arched eyebrows of the beloved, or a reaping-hook?</p>  
<p>Is it, indeed, the stigma attendant upon the dark-eyes&#8217; glances,<br> Which, notwithstanding loss of life and goods, leaveth me not?</p>  
<p>Do not be in any way abashed, by the censure love bringeth on;<br> For it is the embroidered decorations of existence itself.</p>  
<p><a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></A></p>  
<p>Since it hath preserved me safely, from mine own sorrows,<br> Is this love's anguish, or is it my sympathizing consoler?</p>  
<p>Whoever entereth on love's path must, indeed, endure its pangs;<br> For this is an excellent present to send after the bride.</p>  
<p>When I beheld <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span> over head and ears in love's affairs,<br> I found him mad&#8212;in sooth, Majn&#363;n's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> elder brother.</p>  <h4 align="center">IV.</h4>  
<p>Love, assuredly, is both profit, as well as traffic,<br> Hence, why the candle yieldeth its head with a smile.</p>  
<p>The <u>ch</u>ikor hath dyed red its legs,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> and laugheth heartily,<br> Because, alone in its roost, it found happiness and joy.</p>  
<p>Inasmuch as life and goods are staked upon it,<br> This trade is, certainly, constituted to some advantage.</p>  
<p>Though, the lover's appearance seemeth wretched, what then?<br> This beggar in rags, swayeth the sceptre of dominion.</p>  
<p>Where is wandering in the desert? where sauntering in hamlets?<br> Where the hale and healthy? where the crazy and mad?</p>  
<p>Zul&#299;<u>kh</u>&#257;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> abandoned, entirely, the cushion of sovereignty,<br> When the first inception of love's passion she acquired.</p>  
<p>Those lovers who, from affection, openly, weep and wail,<br> Merely conceal, by so doing, their transports and their joy.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></A></p>  
<p>When the beloved accordeth her society with willingness,<br> The lovers say, unto themselves, now are we repaid!</p>  
<p>Because thou, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span>! hast made but a beginning in thy love,<br> Hence, towards me, thy endearments thus so trifling are.</p>  <h4 align="center">V.</h4>  
<p>In such wise have the fair made away with my heart,<br> As if, indeed, it had never, at any time, been mine own.</p>  
<p>Though I summon back, this stag-eye captured heart;<br> Yet, like the deer, it heedeth not any calling of mine.</p>  
<p>Whereas my beloved inflicteth one wound upon another,<br> The medicine-chest of the physician is useless unto me.</p>  
<p>Since thoughts of the rosy-cheeked, are the light of my eye,<br> It is objectionable, unto the rose, this gazing of mine.</p>  
<p>Whatever part shall be found, free from headaches for the fair,<br> There's the befitting spot where my head should be smitten.</p>  
<p>Whether I die or live, my head is laid at the portal of the beloved;<br> Save that threshold, there is no other place of existence for me.</p>  
<p>Should I draw the whole of the world's beauties to my side,<br> I could not derive from another, the good I gain from thee.</p>  
<p>There cannot exist between any lover and his beloved,<br> Such cruel treatment as thine, and endurance like mine.</p>  
<p>If other folks groan under the tyranny of the Mu<u>gh</u>als,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> The Almighty hath made my grief for thee, the Mu<u>gh</u>al to me.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="green">p. 92</font></A></p>  
<p>Both the moth and the taper have often consumed themselves;<br> But they have no conception, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span>, of this consuming of thine!</p>  <h4 align="center">VI.</h4>  
<p>How shall I stroll in the garden, without thee at my side?<br> What shall I do with the jasmine and the lily, without thee?</p>  
<p>Since thou art the light of mine eyes, when thou art absent,<br> How shall I, the view of the parterre and its fragrant flowers, enjoy?</p>  
<p>When every tulip, to a live coal turneth, and I burn thereon,<br> Let me not see them; for what were Yaman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> without thee?</p>  
<p>No one yearneth after Paradise, save the Deity's face to behold:<br> What then is home, or hamlet, or country to me, without thee?</p>  
<p>Forasmuch as it cannot reach the dimpled well of thy chin,<br> What shall I do with the short thread of life, without thee?</p>  
<p>As a mendicant monk, in the dust at thy door, I am happy;<br> But what were <u>Kh</u>ut&#x324;an's sovereignty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> to me, without thee?</p>  
<p>Since I am carried to the fire, perpetually, like meat for the roast,<br> Of what use to me is existence, like slaughter, without thee?</p>  
<p>Say then unto me, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span>, whom thou, so cruelly, leavest&#8212;<br> Unto him of the sightless eyes say, what shall I do without thee.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="green">p. 93</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">VII.</h4>  
<p>Do not become, like the bubble, wholly vain and inflated;<br> For, from such vanity thou wilt, to ruin and perdition go.</p>  
<p>Ask not from the Almighty, the rank and dignity of man;<br> Since, like the brutes, thou art occupied, in eating and drinking.</p>  
<p>Even the beast, in the plough, goeth uniform to the furrow;<br> Wherefore then, quittest thou, thus sinfully, the Law's precepts?</p>  
<p>Every breath thou drawest, without remembering thy Creator,<br> Consider, that thou swallowest a live coal, by the same computation.</p>  
<p>Seeing that thou knowest nothing, save sleeping and eating,<br> In what respect art thou superior to the beasts of the field?</p>  
<p>Why writhe in agony, at the bare thoughts of Hell's pangs,<br> When thou wanderest about tormented by carnality's cares?</p>  
<p>Follow not, thus presumptuously, the vanities of the world;<br> For in this, like the lightning, thou wilt soon lose thyself.</p>  
<p>If, in the accounts here below, there shall no errors be,<br> There will be none, in those, of the account-book above.</p>  
<p>Be not concerned, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span>, regarding thy daily bread;<br> For that Causer of Causes, the Infinite, existeth!</p>  <h4 align="center">VIII.</h4>  
<p>A spoiled son taketh not to discipline and instruction;<br> And a shaded palm-tree yieldeth not ripe dates.</p>  
<p><a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="green">p. 94</font></A></p>  
<p>Let not that boy be ever taken unto thy embrace,<br> Who may not take, also, to his lessons and his school.</p>  
<p>Certainly, the ass and mule are in their place, in the stable;<br> But not a blockhead, without application, in the house.</p>  
<p>When one degenerate creature appeareth in a family,<br> He bringeth disgrace on his lineage, both present and past.</p>  
<p>"According to the son's good or bad actions, the father is remembered,"<br> Is a saying that hath been verified, throughout the world.</p>  
<p>The finger is pointed towards the rider, and to him only,<br> Whose horse, the bridle's guidance doth not properly obey.</p>  
<p>In heart, affection&#8212;on tongue, asperity; it behoveth, with the son:<br> What an excellent axiom&#8212;"Where the blow is, there is respect."</p>  
<p>Joseph, then, became fit for the exercise of sovereignty,<br> When he received the blows of displeasure, and of wrath.</p>  
<p>Like the flies, every worthless creature buzzeth about him,<br> When sugar-lipped <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span> reciteth his sweet strains.</p>  <h4 align="center">IX.</h4>  
<p>I am sunk in care, to this degree, on account of the fair,<br> Like unto a stone, submerged at the bottom of &AElig;m&#257;n's sea.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>For this reason, all peace and tranquillity are lost unto me,<br> That my tears have engulphed the goods and chattels of patience.</p>  
<p>Those unacquainted with the case, call it the sunset's redness,<br> Though by weeping blood, I even, the sky itself, submerge.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="green">p. 95</font></A></p>  
<p>Be not misled by the honied words of the deceitful fair;<br> For they, by this witchery, have whole peoples o&#8217;erwhelm&#8217;d.</p>  
<p>Thus, under the mask of fondness, they slay and destroy one,<br> Like as though <u>Kh</u>izr&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> were drowned, in immortality's fount.</p>  
<p>In such wise, they keep me at a distance, when in their presence,<br> Like one thirsting for a draught of water, in solicitude drowned.</p>  
<p>The pearl of the ocean of their coyness cannot be found,<br> Though I engulph, without number, the ships of patience therein.</p>  
<p>Love's lighted taper, unto the tomb, he hath borne away,<br> Who carried the arrow of separation, embedded in his heart.</p>  
<p>The paper boats of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d's</span> cares and anxieties,<br> The world hath, in the fathomless ocean of amazement, o&#8217;erwhelmed.</p>  <h4 align="center">X.</h4>  
<p>In what manner shall I hush the sighs of this seared heart?<br> The nightingales will not be mute, among the roses of the parterre!</p>  
<p>The tongue becometh again extricated, like a hero from the mel&eacute;e,<br> However strongly I seize it with my teeth, that it may silent remain,</p>  
<p>Through crudeness and rawness, fermentation, from the vessel ariseth;<br> But the wise, from their own shrewdness, will taciturn be.</p>  
<p>With water only, shall the lamp of thy desire become lighted,<br> Shouldst thou, like the pearl-oyster, silence, with patience, thy tongue.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="green">p. 96</font></A></p>  
<p>When the seed is concealed in the earth, it becometh an ear of corn;<br> Therefore, lock up thine anguish, within the recesses pf thy breast.</p>  
<p>The nightingale's wailings, about the rose, are not befitting;<br> For the moths consume themselves, in silence, on the red flame.</p>  
<p>Like as the straw and the yellow amber&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> attract each other,<br> Thus, with silent tongue, do loving friends, each other invoke.</p>  
<p>As the mother, the innocent cause of her infant's death, mourneth silently;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A><br> So, inaudibly, the heart-enamoured utter their sighs and wails.</p>  
<p>How could he entertain honourably his sugar-mouthed guest,<br> Should <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d's</span> sweetness-raining, thoughtful strains be hushed?</p>  <h4 align="center">XI.</h4>  
<p>My heart hath gone out, as a help in the fight, a look to obtain;<br> And to the right and to the left are discharged the arrows of sight.</p>  
<p>With the ardour I am filled with, my heart throbeth and beateth,<br> Like as the infant springeth and boundeth, in its mother's arms.</p>  
<p>By the hand of the forsaken, peace of mind cannot be grasped&#8212;<br> When do the heart-scorched, from a handful of water, find relief?</p>  
<p>The stars, in their gladness, at my union with the beloved,<br> The tamborine beating, have thrust their fingers through.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="green">p. 97</font></A></p>  
<p>By the recollection, every moment, of the mole of my beloved,<br> A musk-pod, as it were, becometh broken upon my head,</p>  
<p>The Rustams&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> of patience and abstinence, like little children,<br> Take shelter, in retirement, from the crushing blow of love.</p>  
<p>At the fountain of union's attainment, I die, with lips parched,<br> From the burning fever of the dread of separation.</p>  
<p>Since the self-willed, like <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span>, they have made humble,<br> Love's pomp and grandeur are not without mishaps and blows.</p>  <h4 align="center">XII.</h4>  
<p>From the fire and fever of separation defend us!<br> Preserve us, O God, from the fierce flames of Hell!</p>  
<p>They make earth and heaven tremble on man's account<br> Shield us, alas! from the great tyranny of the fair!</p>  
<p>Evil destiny made it my grievous lot, unto life's end,<br> To be ever departing, alas! from the sweet-lipped ones.</p>  
<p>Though I, through reverence, cannot look upon her face;<br> Yet, for the courtesy of the ungracious ones, alas! alas!</p>  
<p>The lot of the love-born, in comparison with the damned,<br> Is, alas! very many times more horrid and abominable.</p>  
<p>Who deem the tormenting of lovers to be a virtuous act&#8212;<br> O, guard us, and defend from this creed of the fair!</p>  
<p>Who cannot utter, with the tongue, what the heart wisheth&#8212;<br> From the desires of such lovers, O save and rescue us!</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></A></p>  
<p>The morning, whose dawn is called the morn of doom&#8212;<br> From the night of such morning, O save us, and preserve!</p>  
<p>Thou sayest, that <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span> should be debarred from the fair&#8212;<br> Alas, O monitor, that thou shouldst speak such monstrous words!</p>  <h4 align="center">XIII.</h4>  
<p>O necessity! what a terrible calamity art thou,<br> That changest man's nature into that of the dog!</p>  
<p>The Mu&#7717;ammadan, thou makest follow Hind&#363; rites,<br> And the Hind&#363;, the usages of the Faithful to observe,</p>  
<p>Kings and Princes thou makest stand at the door,<br> Of their crowns deprived, and from their thrones driven.</p>  
<p>Even the free and unrestrained birds of the air also,<br> Thou entanglest, helpless and paralyzed in the net.</p>  
<p>The tutor likewise, in the sight of his own scholar,<br> Thou makest even more contemptible than the fowl.</p>  
<p>Since by them, man cannot be exempted<br> From the tax of necessity's urgent demands,</p>  
<p>Say then, from all power and dominion soever,<br> And in empire's sway, what advantage is there?</p>  
<p>Unto the opulent, infinite Deity, this is exclusive,<br> That He is wanting in nothing, whatsoever it be.</p>  
<p>The raising up of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span>, too, shall be effected,<br> From out of the waves of affliction, and of grief!</p>  
<p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="green">p. 99</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">XIV.</h4>  
<p>The friendship of this world's friend is false and hollow:<br> From the tulip thou seekest permanence, unavailingly.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Like unto one who vainly calleth to a goose for a porringer,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A><br> So absurd, hath become, the hope of any constancy.</p>  
<p>Since no one is the gainer from a friend's friendship,<br> Let not this unprofitable, gainless trade be entered on.</p>  
<p>He, who in his necessities, craveth aught from fate's revolutions,<br> Unavailingly, runneth after the lightning's bright gleams.</p>  
<p>To-morrow, thy manliness will be, from thy acts, seen;<br> Therefore, in boasting, raise no foolish noise, to-day.</p>  
<p>Speaking, without acting, is mere trouble and vexation:<br> The kernel of desire, by this absurdity, cannot be obtained.</p>  
<p>He, who may open his mouth unto the mean and base,<br> Rendereth the pearls of his own speech worthless, altogether.</p>  
<p>When, thereby, its own rent garment it cannot gather together,<br> The rose, unreasonably, laugheth, at the weeping of the dew.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Since, in the flame, O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span>! the moth uttereth no cry,<br> The wailing of the nightingale for the rose, is utterly vain.</p>

<p>Keep thy face for ever wet with the water of thy tears;<br> For in these waters can be seen, the lustre of the pearl.</p>  
<p>The lamp of Joseph's countenance at that time became lighted,<br> When his brethren made it red, by their cuffs and blows.</p>  
<p>The tree that is obscured, will be backward in giving fruit,<br> Until it shall be brought, face to face, with the sun.</p>  
<p>Like the rose, thy face shall glow before every one,<br> If thou but wash the face of the heart with blood.</p>  
<p>The darksome stain of thy eagerness will not disappear,<br> Till, with patience's pearl-powder, thou cleanse not the face.</p>  
<p>The patient and submissive, from prudence and bashfulness,<br> Are unable to look upon their own faces, the mirror within.</p>  
<p>He who beareth the blister of toil and labour, upon his hand,<br> Will gaze, without apprehension, on the surface of the gem.</p>  
<p>Unto the wise, a display of knowledge is a great defect<br> The lustre of the gem changeth the mirror to an earthen plate.</p>  
<p>If thou seek after distinction in the court of the adored,<br> Like as the mirror, smear over thy face with ashes and dust.</p>  
<p>The ardent longing of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&#7716;am&#299;d</span> containeth naught of sinfulness;<br> It only seeketh everywhere, for that which it hath lost.</p>  <h4 align="center">XVI.</h4>  
<p>Since the world's pomps and vanities are accounted nothing,<br> Only the worthless man will boast of such nothingness.</p>  
<p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="green">p. 101</font></A></p>  
<p>The existence of the transitory world is as the lightning's flash;<br> And by the light of a meteor, no affairs can be disposed of.</p>

About this time, the marriage of Jal&#257;l, son of Jam&#257;l, was about to be celebrated; and the &#7778;&#363;bah-d&#257;r himself sent the sum of two thousand rupees towards its expenses. &AElig;sau, however, bent upon taking revenge, and Jam&#257;l's clan being weak in proportion to his own, he sent his spies to bring him intelligence when his enemy should be occupied in his son's nuptial ceremonies, to fall upon him. On the night of the marriage, therefore, he assembled his friends and clansmen, and came upon Jamal's village. Jamul, though totally unprepared for such an attack, came out to meet his enemies; but having been badly wounded, he had to seek shelter within the walls of his own dwelling. On this, &AElig;sau set it on fire; and Jamal, with his son and family, and the parties assembled at the celebration of the wedding, to the amount of upwards of eighty men, women, and children, were consumed.
