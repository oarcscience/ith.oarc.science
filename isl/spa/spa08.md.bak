### ÆABD-UL-ḤAMĪD.

<span class="smallcaps">Æabd-ul-Ḥamīd</span>, the author of the
following poems, was born at Mā<u>sh</u>ū <u>Kh</u>el, a small village
belonging to the Kudrīzī clan, or branch, of the Af<u>gh</u>ān tribe of
Mohmand, one of the purely Af<u>gh</u>ān tribes at present dwelling in
the Pe<u>s’h</u>āwar district. Hence, Ḥamīd, like Raḥmān, was a Mohmand,
but of a different clan. The exact year of his birth I have been unable
to discover, but it was certainly about the middle of the last half of
the seventeenth century. He was brought up to the priesthood, and is
said to have been endowed with a considerable amount of learning, which
he acquired at Pe<u>s’h</u>āwar; and students from all parts of the
surrounding districts sought his instruction.

He is the cynical poet of the Af<u>gh</u>āns—the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>
Sāædī of the Pu<u>s’h</u>to language—and the beauty of his compositions
is fully acknowledged, even amongst a nation so rich in poets as the
Persians, by whom he is styled "Ḥamīd the Hair-splitter." His poetry,
though generally of a moral tendency, and breathing contempt of the
world and its vanities, is still tinged with Ṣūfi doctrines, as all
Muḥammadan poetry, in whatever language written, more or less is. He was
the author of three works—a poem entitled "Nairang-i-Æi<u>sh</u>ḳ," or
"Love's Fascination;" "<u>Sh</u>āh Gadā," or "The King and the Beggar;"
and a Collection of Odes, entitled "Dur-o-Marjān," or "Pearls and
Corals," from which the following translations have been selected.

The year of the poet's decease is, like that of his birth, somewhat
uncertain; but the people of his native village account his death

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

to have taken place about the year <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>
1732; and his descendants, on inquiring of them, state, that four
generations have passed since that event occurred, which, at the usual
computation of thirty years for each generation, agrees within five
years with the period mentioned. An aged man of the same village, who
died about twenty years since, in the 107th year of his age, had been,
repeatedly, heard to say, by the people of the hamlet, that he had, in
his youthful days, seen Mull Ḥamīd frequently, who, at that time, was
upwards of fifty years old. Another patriarch, Malīk Æazīz <u>Kh</u>ān,
who is about a century old, states, that he had heard his father and
grandfather relate, that they remembered Ḥamīd well; and that he was
just coming into notice as a poet, towards the close of Raḥmān's life;
and some of Ḥamīd's odes having reached the ear of Raḥmān, he sent for
the poet to come and visit him; and was so pleased with his modesty and
humility, that he gave him his blessing, and prayed that his verses
might be sweet unto all men, and that no one might ever excel him in
Af<u>gh</u>ān poetry. Up to the present day, certainly, Ḥamīd has not
been surpassed.

The poet's grave is still pointed out by the people of his native
village. Some of his descendants continue to dwell at Mā<u>sh</u>ū Khel,
and some are dispersed in other villages. The dwelling in which Ḥamīd
was born, lived, and died, is now in ruins.
