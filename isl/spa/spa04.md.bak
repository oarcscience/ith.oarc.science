### ÆABD-UR-RAḤMĀN.

<span class="smallcaps">Mullā Æabd-ur-Raḥmān</span> is one of the most
popular, and probably the best known, of all the Af<u>gh</u>ān poets.
His effusions are of a religious or moral character, and chiefly on the
subject of divine love, being, like the poetical compositions of all
Muḥammadan poets, tinged with the mysticisms of Ṣūfi-ism, already
described in the Introductory Remarks; but there is a fiery energy in
his style, and a natural simplicity, which will be vainly sought for
amongst the more flowery and bombastic poetry of the Persians.

Raḥmān belonged to the <u>Gh</u>orīah <u>Kh</u>el clan or sub-division,
of the Mohmand tribe of the Af<u>gh</u>āns, and dwelt in the village of
Hazār-<u>Kh</u>ānī, in the *tapah* or district of the Mohmands, one of
the five divisions of the province of Pe<u>s’h</u>āwar. He was a man of
considerable learning, but lived the life of a Darwe<u>sh</u>, absorbed
in religious contemplation, and separated from the world, with which,
and with its people, he held no greater intercourse than necessity and
the means of subsistence demanded. He is said to have been passionately
fond of hearing religious songs, accompanied by some musical instrument,
which the <u>Ch</u>astī sect of Muḥammadans <span
id="fr_23"></span>[\*](#fn_23.md) appears to have a great partiality for.
After a time, when the gift of poesy was bestowed upon him, he became a
strict recluse,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

and was generally found by his friends in tears. Indeed, he is said to
have been in the habit of weeping so much, as in course of time to have
produced wounds on both his cheeks. His strict retirement, however, gave
opportunity to a number of envious Mullās to belie him; and they began
to circulate reports to the effect, that Raḥmān had turned atheist or
heretic, since he never left his dwelling, and had even given up
worshipping at the mosque along with the congregation—a matter strictly
enjoined on all orthodox Muḥammadans. At length, by the advice and
assistance of some of the priesthood, more liberal and less bigoted than
his enemies, he contrived to escape from their hands, by agreeing, for
the future, to attend the place of public worship, and to pray and
perform his other religious duties, along with the members of the
congregation. He thus, whether agreeable to himself or not, was obliged
in some measure to mix with the world; and this, doubtless, gave rise to
the ode at page [29](spa05.htm#page_29.md), to which the reader is
referred.

Raḥmān appears to have been in the habit of giving the copies of his
poems, as he composed. them, from time to time, to his particular
friends, which they, unknown to each other, took care to collect and
preserve, for the express purpose of making a collection of them after
the author's death. This they accordingly carried out, and it was not
until Raḥmān's decease that these facts became known. It then appeared
also, that some of these pseudo friends had, to increase the bulk of
their own collection of the poet's odes, mixed up a quantity of their
own trashy compositions with Raḥmān's, and had added, or rather forged,
his name to them in the last couplets. In this manner two of these
collections of odes were made, and were styled Raḥmān's first and
second. Fortunately for his reputation, these forgeries were discovered
in time, by some of the dearest of the poet's friends, who recognised or
remembered the particular poems of his composition;

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

and they accordingly rejected the chaff, retaining the wheat only, in
the shape of his Dīwān, or alphabetical collection of odes, as it has
come down to the present day. Still, considerable differences exist in
many copies, some odes having a line more or a line less, whilst some
again contain odes that are entirely wanting in others. This caused me
considerable trouble when preparing several of them for insertion in my
"Selections in the Af<u>gh</u>ān Language;" but it was attended with a
proportionate degree of advantage, having altogether compared some sixty
different copies of the poet's works, of various dates, some of which
were written shortly after Raḥmān's death, when his friends had
succeeded in collecting the poems in a single volume.

By some accounts, the poet would appear to have been a co-temporary of
the warrior-poet, <u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl <u>Kh</u>ān; <span
id="fr_24"></span>[\*](#fn_24.md) and it has been stated, that on two or
three occasions they held poetical disputations together. This, however,
cannot be true; for it seems that although Raḥmān was living towards the
latter part of that brave chieftain's life, yet he was a mere youth, and
was, more correctly speaking, a cotemporary of Afẓal <u>Kh</u>ān's, the
grandson and successor of <u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl, and the author of that
rare, excellent, and extensive Af<u>gh</u>ān history, entitled,
"Tārī<u>kh</u>-i-Muraṣṣaæ," and other valuable works. A proof of the
incorrectness of this statement is, that the tragical end of Gul
<u>Kh</u>ān and Jamal <u>Kh</u>ān, which Raḥmān and the poet Ḥamīd also
have devoted a long poem to, <span id="fr_25"></span>[†](#fn_25.md) took
place in the year of the Hijrah 1123 (<span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1711), twenty-five years after the death
of <u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl. Another, and still stronger proof against the
statement of poetical disputations having taken place between them, is
the fact of Raḥmān's retired life, and his humble position, as compared
with that of <u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl, the chief of a powerful tribe, and
as good a poet as himself.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

Some descendants of Raḥmān, on his daughter's side, dwell at present in
the little hamlet of Deh-i-Bahādur (the Hamlet of the Brave), in the
Mohmand district; but the descendants on the side of his only son have
long been extinct.

The poet's tomb may still be seen in the graveyard of his native
village.
