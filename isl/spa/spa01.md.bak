### TO THE READER.

DURING my lengthened researches in, and long study of the Pu<u>s’h</u>to
language, for so many years past, and particularly when making
selections for my work entitled "<span
class="smallcaps">Gul<u>sh</u>an-i-Roh</span>," <span
id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md) I could not fail being much struck with the
beauty of some of the poetry of the Af<u>gh</u>āns; so much so, indeed,
that I long since determined, and, at length, now venture to submit to
the European reader, a literal translation of several poems of the most
celebrated of the Af<u>gh</u>ān poets—together with a brief notice of
each author—in an English dress.

It must be remembered, that these poems are the effusions of men who
never enjoyed any of what we call the luxuries of life; yet how refined
are the generality of their sentiments! Of men who lived in a state,
such as our own Borderers lived in, five hundred years ago, in violence
and in strife, and whose descendants live so still; yet how exquisitely
pathetic are many of their poems, and how high-souled and benevolent
their sentiments and ideas! Inhabiting a fine country, with grand and
lofty mountains, and green and fertile valleys, but with nought more
than the bare necessaries of life attainable, how simple and how perfect
are their similes, and how true to nature! What a patriotic ardour; what
a true spirit of freedom, and a love of country, much of their poetry
displays!

It must also be borne in mind, that the greater number of the

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

writers of the following poems, except Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh, and
<u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl <u>Kh</u>ān, and his sons, were either men, who
during their life-time had scarcely left the precincts of their native
village, or who had devoted their lives to poverty and religious
abstraction. Men, who never wrote for fame; and who never contemplated
that the inmost thoughts which had occupied their hearts, would ever
meet the eyes of more than a few dear and admiring friends, after they
had, themselves, passed from the scene for ever. Never did they imagine
that they would appear before any Public, much less a European one, in
the Saxon tongue, and translated by a <span
class="smallcaps">Farangī</span>!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Far from the maddening world's ignoble strife,  
   Their sober wishes never learn’d to stray;  
 Along the cool sequester’d vale of life,  
   They kept the noiseless tenour of their way."

</div>

I have been very careful to render the poems as literal as possible; and
have, it will be perceived, endeavoured to preserve the rhyming words,
as they occur, in the English as well, more particularly when each
couplet ends in the same word throughout.

It will also, no doubt, be observed, that two nominatives sometimes
occur, one in each line of a couplet; which is occasioned by the first
hemistich of the couplets being put first, where we should, if we
considered the English idiom only, put it last. This may cause a seeming
quaintness in the translation; but I considered it necessary to follow
the original as near as possible, in order to preserve the literal style
I had, from the outset, adopted.

The reader should also understand, that Af<u>gh</u>ān books exist only
in manuscript, as was the case in Europe before the invention of
printing; and the following poems have been translated from such. Copies
of the works of some of the authors herein contained are rare, and
seldom to be met with, even in Af<u>gh</u>ānistān, such as the poems of
Aḥmad <u>Sh</u>āh, <u>Kh</u>wājah Muḥammad, and (except in the
Pe<u>s’h</u>āwar district) <u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl <u>Kh</u>ān, and his
sons; whilst the

<span id="page_vii">p. vii</span>

original manuscript of <u>Sh</u>aidā's poems, as they were first
collected and arranged into a volume, and richly illuminated, is in my
possession; and no copy of them, that I am aware of, exists, save that
which I permitted the descendants on his brother's side to make from my
manuscript, which I sent some hundreds of miles for them to examine.
Although he was celebrated as a poet, they had never seen his poems
before, he having died in India.

Greater variety will be noticed in the poems of <u>Kh</u>u<u>sh</u>ḥāl
<u>Kh</u>ān, than in those of the other Af<u>gh</u>ān poets contained in
this volume; for, like the poets of the West, no subject seems to have
been foreign to him; and, amongst other things, he does not spare the
failings of his own countrymen, as he found them two centuries since;
and probably he will on this account be the favourite with the general
reader.

All I can say in conclusion is, that what is good in the following pages
must be credited to the authors; and all the failings and imperfections,
which are very many, I fear, to their English translator, who,
therefore, prays for the indulgence and forbearance of his readers.
