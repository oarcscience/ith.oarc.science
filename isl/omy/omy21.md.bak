### CHAPTER IV.

#### OF THE UPWARD PROGRESS OR ASCENT OF MAN.

<span class="margnote">Man's upward Progress.</span>WHEN Man has become
assured of the truth of Revelation he has reached the stage of Belief,
and has the name of *Múmin*, "Believer." When he further acts in
obedience to the will of God, and apportions the night and day for
earnest prayer, he has reached the stage of worship, and is called an
*’Abid*, or "Worshipper." When he has expelled the love of this world
from his heart, and occupies himself

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

with a contemplation of the mighty Whole, he reaches the next stage, and
becomes a Záhid, or "Recluse." When in addition to all this he knows
God, and subsequently learns the mysteries of nature, he reaches the
stage of Acquaintance, and is called *’Árif*, "One who knows." The next
stage is that in which he attains to the love of God, and is called a
*Welí* or "Saint." When he is moreover gifted with inspiration and the
power of working miracles, he becomes a *Nebí*, "Prophet;" and when
entrusted next with the delivery of God's own message, he is called an
"Apostle," *Rusúl*. When he is appointed to abrogate a previous
dispensation and preach a new one, he is called *Ulu ’l ’Azm*, "One who
has a mission." When this mission is final he has arrived at the stage
called *Khatm*, or "the Seal." This is the Upward Progress of Man. The
first stage is the "Believer," the last the "Seal."

After separation from the body, the soul of <span
class="margnote">Destination of the soul,</span> Man returns to that
Heaven which corresponds to the stage which he has attained; thus the
Believer at last dwells in the first or lowest Heaven, and the Seal in
the Heaven of Heavens; for it will be noticed that the stages of upward
progress correspond to the number of degrees in the Heavenly Spheres,
namely, seven inferior and two superior.

The metaphysicians say that these stages and <span
class="margnote">metaphysically explained.</span> degrees do not in
reality exist, but that the Heavenly Intelligence which corresponds to
the degree of intelligence attained by Man attracts and absorbs his soul
into itself after separation from the body.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thus every one who
has attained intelligence corresponding to that of the highest sphere,
his soul returns thereto; and he who has attained intelligence
corresponding to the lowest sphere, his soul in like manner returns to
that; those who have not attained intelligence corresponding to any of
these will be placed in Hell, which is situate below the lowest sphere.

As each of the Heavenly Spheres is furnished with knowledge and purity
in proportion to its position, the rank of Man's soul in the future
state will, according to this last account, be in proportion to his
degree of knowledge and purity of life while upon the earth.

The Upward Progress infinite.}The Unitarians say that man's Upward
Progress has no end, for if he strive for a thousand years, each day
will teach him something that he knew not before, inasmuch as the
knowledge of God has no limit. So Mohammed says, "He who progresses
daily is yet of feeble mind."

<span class="margnote">Simile illustrating the foregoing. </span>The
religious account says that the soul of every man returns to an
individual place after separation from the body. This the metaphysicians
deny; for how, say they, can the soul of a man return to a certain place
when it has not originally come from a certain place? The soul of man is
the Primal Spirit, and if a thousand persons live, it is the same spirit
that animates them all; and in like manner if a thousand die, the same
spirit returns to itself, and is not lessened or diminished. If a myriad
persons build houses and make windows therein the same

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

sun illumines them all, and though every one of them should be
destroyed, the sun would not be lessened or diminished. The sun is the
lord of the sensible world, and the exponent of the attributes of the
Primal Spirit. The Primal Spirit is the lord of the invisible world and
the exponent of the Nature of God <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md).

When the heart of man has been revivified and <span
class="margnote">Intelligence the aim of the Upward
Progress.</span>illumined by the Primal Spirit, he has arrived at
Intelligence; for Intelligence is a light in the heart, distinguishing
between truth and vanity, Until he has been so revivified and illumined,
it is impossible for him to attain to intelligence at all. But having
attained to intelligence, then, and not till then, is the time for the
attainment of knowledge, for becoming Wise. Intelligence is a Primal
Element, and knowledge the attribute thereof. When from knowledge he has
successively proceeded to the attainment of the Divine Light, and
acquaintance with the mysteries of nature, his last step will be
Perfection, with which his Upward Progress concludes.

But dive he ever so deeply into the treasury of <span
class="margnote">Retrogression how avoided.</span>

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

mysteries and knowledge, unless he examine himself and confess that
after all he knows naught, all that he has acquired will slip through
his hands, and leave him far poorer than before. His treasure of to-day
should as much exceed the treasure of yesterday as an ocean exceeds a
drop; but this can never be, unless he, leaving all else for
contemplation and self-examination, have freedom and leisure to learn
how poor he really is, and how much he needs the saving help of God.

<span class="margnote">Unitarian account.</span>One class of Unitarians
explain the Upward Progress of Man thus. They say that every atom of
existent beings is filled with light;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Arise and look around, for every atom that has
birth  
Shines forth a lustrous beacon to illumine all the earth:</span>

</div>

but that man walks abroad in darkness, blinded by the lusts of life, and
laments the want of light that would, were he but aware of it, involve
him in the glorious sheen of brightest day:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">’Twere well to catch the odours that about our
senses play,  
For all the world is full of blasts to bear the sweets away.</span>

</div>

<span class="margnote">Upward Progress</span>What they mean is this,
that all existent beings are compounded of two things, darkness and
light, which are indistinguishably blended together. The light belongs
to the Invisible, and the darkness to the Sensible world; but the two
are intimately connected, and the former exercises a paramount influence
upon the latter. The object of man, according to them, is to separate
the light from the darkness, that its nature and attributes may be
understood, and in this consists his Upward Progress.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

Although the light and the darkness can never be entirely separated, for
the one is as it were the veil of the other, the light can be made to
prevail, so that its attributes may become manifest.

Now it is possible to separate thus far the light from the darkness in
certain cases; in the bodies of men and animals, for instance, there are
certain organs always at work, whose sole object is this separation.
Thus, when food is introduced <span class="margnote">consists in the
separation of Light and Darkness.</span>into the stomach, the liver
receives the cream and essence of it and transmits it to the heart; the
heart, in like manner, extracts the essence of this, which is the life,
and transmits it to the brain; lastly, the brain extracts the essence of
this, and transforms it into the elixir of life, the real light of all.

The elixir evolved by the brain is the instinctive spirit, and is as it
were a lamp in a lantern; but it gives forth after all but a flickering
and cloudy light, and man's object should therefore be to strengthen and
purify it by Renunciation and Contemplation, until it give forth the
true light which is the Spirit of Humanity. When man has attained to
this he necessarily becomes free from all that is evil, and is adorned
instead with every good and noble quality.

The body of man is like a lantern, the Vegetative <span
class="margnote">Man likened to a lamp.</span> Spirit is the lamp, the
Animal Spirit is the wick, the Instinctive Spirit the oil, and the
Spirit of Humanity the fire that kindles all. "Verily its oil would
almost shine even though no fire kindled it." (Cor. cap. 24, v. 35). In
other words, the Instinctive

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Spirit should feed
and supply the Spirit of Humanity, as the oil feeds and supplies the
flame in a lamp. The Traveller must aim at completing this lamp, so that
his heart may be illumined, and he may see things as they really are.
When the Spirit of Humanity a "light upon light" (Cor. cap. 24, y. 35)
has thus kindled the Instinctive Spirit, God "guideth whom He pleaseth
to His own light" (idem), that is, to the divine light of His own
nature, reaching which the Traveller's Upward Progress is complete; for
"from Him they spring, and unto Him return."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_31"></span>[61:1](omy21.htm#fr_31.md) The following from
Tennyson's *In Memoriam* forms a beautiful protest against the ideas
here set forth:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

That each who seems a separate whole  
  Should move his rounds, and fusing all  
  The skirts of self again, should fall  
Remerging in the general soul,

Is faith as vague as all unsweet:  
  Eternal form shall still divide  
  The eternal soul from all beside;  
And I shall know him when we meet.
