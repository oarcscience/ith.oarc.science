### Footnotes

<span id="fn_32"></span>[74:1](omy23.htm#fr_32.md) Tholuck in his SUFISMUS
(Berolini, MDCCCXXI), p. 105, explains this as follows: "*Cincinnorum
circuli*, Sic divina dicunt mysteria, nemini præter Deum ipsum nota."
This, however, is the interpretation of *zulf* (tresses), not *khan i
zulf*. The verse quoted above, in page [41](omy15.htm#page_41.md),

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"One glimpse I gave them of my glorious face,"

</div>

affords a good illustration of this. The words of the original being

<span id="img_07400"></span> ![](img/07400.jpg)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"I showed them a hair's point of my *tresses* (*zulf*)."

</div>

<span id="fn_33"></span>[79:1](omy23.htm#fr_33.md) Cf. the answer of the
Delphic oracle to Crœsus, Herod. I. 47. 4:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

καὶ κωφοῦ συνίημι, καὶ οὐ φωνεῦντος ἀκούω.

</div>
