# PART IV.

### CHAPTER I.

#### ON THE INFLUENCE OF EARLY PREJUDICE UPON BELIEF.

THE influence and example of parents and teachers <span
class="margnote">Influence of Parents and Teachers.</span> are paramount
in the formation of the character, and in nothing is this more
conspicuous than in the matter of religious belief. Doctrines mistily
blended with the earliest recollections of life, daily inculcated as
truths by those on whose wisdom and affection the child instinctively
and implicitly relies, surrounded by a halo of sanctity that he has been
ever taught to regard with awe and veneration, to sully which by the
slightest breath of doubt he has been led to believe the deadliest of
sins, doctrines such as these become in after years part and parcel of
the nature of the man, and are not to be lightly cast aside for systems
more attractive to the reason or the sense.

The Traveller who has been so trained will <span class="margnote">Its
practical effects.</span> confess, and unreservedly believe, the
principles of

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

his religion, and will act up to the practice of it, with more
conscientious earnestness than he who at the outset of his journey
constructs a scheme for himself upon the basis of his elders’ counsel,
or the conclusions of his own unaided reasoning powers.

<span class="margnote">Its insufficiency without evidence and
Grace.</span>Early prejudice is an external influence, and that which is
external is far more practical and active than that which is internal.
For which cause much earnestness and devotion and faith in the outward
attributes of God is found amongst Travellers of this class, but the
light of evidence and Divine Grace is still wanting to make them fully
understand that His Knowledge, Will and Power comprehend and pervade the
whole range of natural causes and effects. <span class="margnote">God as
the Causer of Causes.</span> They fail to observe that causes as well as
effects yield and are subservient to His will, and attribute every event
to the action of some natural law. This class of Travellers will lay
great stress upon the efficacy of energy and exertion, and care little
for submission and resignation; thus their aspirations are checked by
worldly thoughts and desires, and relying upon themselves rather than
upon God, they can never hope to attain to a true and full knowledge of
Him.

The next class, however, whose early faith has been ripened into
conviction by the rays of evidence and proof, recognize God as the
Causer of Causes, and relying fully upon Him, rather than upon their own
energy and efforts, or upon the things of this world, pass their lives
in submission and resignation to His Will. He is their only hope and
stay, and

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

the only object of their affections and desires, nor are they ever
distracted by the whisperings of doubt or shaken by superstitious fears.
If beneath the weight of overpowering misery, or in the intoxication of
unwonted prosperity, they should waver for a moment in their belief,
they atone for their error by a long and earnest course of penitence and
prayer. But when the Traveller has reached that higher Stage where he is
illumined by the Divine Grace, then the day of resurrection dawns for
him, the earthly clouds roll away, the Heavens are opened, and God in
all His glory bursts upon his dazzled view.

Like those of the former class, he confesses with <span
class="margnote">Faith a Divine gift.</span> his tongue and believes in
his heart, but his faith proceeds not from the precepts of others, or
the convictions of his own reason; it flows from a higher source, the
fountain-head of grace itself. These are the true Unitarians, for they
know and see the Unity of God with a clear and certain eye. They are
superior to every consideration, to energy and exertion, to resignation
and submission alike, for with them God is all in all.

As a specimen of the arguments by which faith is to be strengthened into
conviction, I may instance those of the Unitarians. They maintain that
there neither is nor can be any other existence save that of God, and
explain this position by a simile thus: Had there never been night, and
had men dwelt always in continual day, they would never have known what
day really was, but from the constantly <span class="margnote">Evidence
from analogy.</span> recurring contrast of night they can form a

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

clear conception of day; so had there been other than God, God would
have been known, and man could have formed a clear conception of Him;
but as he cannot do this, it follows that there is no other than God.
Firdausi, the celebrated author of the Sháh-náma, says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The height and depth of all the world is centered,
Lord, in Thee:  
I know not what Thou art, Thou art what Thou alone canst be <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28).</span>

</div>

The following little parable is also a common-place with them, and
points to the same idea.

THE PARABLE OF THE FISHES.

<span class="margnote">A parable.</span>Once upon a time the fishes of a
certain river took counsel together, and said, "They tell us that our
life and being is from the water, but we have never seen water, and know
not what it is." Then some among them wiser than the rest said: "We have

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

heard that there dwelleth in the sea a very wise and learned fish who
knoweth all things; let us journey to him, and ask him to shew us water,
or explain unto us what it is." So several of their number set out upon
their travels, and at last came to the sea wherein this sage fish
resided. On hearing their request he answered them thus:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Oh ye who seek to solve the knot!  
Ye live in God, yet know him not.  
Ye sit upon the river's brink,  
Yet crave in vain a drop to drink.  
Ye dwell beside a countless store,  
Yet perish hungry at the door.</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then they thanked
him, and said, "Forasmuch as thou hast shown us what water is not, we
now know perfectly what it is." And they departed to their own homes
satisfied.

Another class of Unitarians maintain that there <span
class="margnote">Life a dream.</span> are, it is true, two existences,
but one is real, which is of God, and the other imaginative, which is
but a mirage, and a reflection of the real. Thus neither the world nor
the vicissitudes of human life have any real existence; they are mere
reflections of the existence of God, beheld as it were in the changing
diorama of a fleeting dream.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_28"></span>[48:1](omy17.htm#fr_28) It was this couplet
which his enemies made use of when accusing the poet before Sháh Mahmúd
of heresy and Sufiism. The Sultan in consequence refused Firdausi the
full reward which he had promised him for the composition of his
Sháh-náma, and compelled him to seek safety in flight from Ghazní. This
conduct called forth from Firdausi the spirited satire which is so much
admired in the East, and in which he defends himself as follows:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Men fain would call me infidel or worse,  
 And say that heresy defiles my verse;  
 And sure no viler caitiff ere was born  
 Than he whose soul religious truths would scorn.  
 They lie! I serve my God and Prophet still;  
 Aye! though a tyrant would my life-blood spill!  
 Ne’er shall my soul from duty's path be led,  
 Not were thy sword uplifted o’er my head."</span>

</div>
