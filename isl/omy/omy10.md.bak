### CHAPTER VI.

#### CONCERNING COUNSEL.

ALL counsel may be summed up in the simple <span
class="margnote">Counsel.</span> words, My friend, rely not on life,
health, or riches. Nothing over which the firmament of heaven revolves
maintains an unchanged existence, but every hour assumes some new form.
Every moment a fresh picture is presented to the view; and one
appearance is scarce complete ere another supervenes, obliterating all
traces of the first, as wave follows wave upon the shore. No wise man
would seek to build his house upon the waves, or hope to find a
foundation for it there. To quote the words of Hafiz:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">In hope's unstable palace no foundations shalt thou
find,  
Then seize the passing hour, for life but rests upon the wind.</span>

</div>

The wisest of mankind are those who have renounced all worldly desires,
and chosen the calm and peaceful lot of a recluse's life. Behind every
pleasure lurk twenty pains; far better is it then to forego one fleeting
joy and spare oneself a lifetime of regret. Life, health, riches, and
happiness, may be our portion to-day; but God alone knows what the
morrow may bring forth.
