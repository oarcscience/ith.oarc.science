### CHAPTER III.

#### OF THE INTELLECTUAL AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT OF MAN.

EVERY animal possesses a vegetative spirit, a living<span
class="margnote">The Spirit of Humanity.</span> spirit, and an
instinctive spirit; but man has an additional inheritance, namely the
Spirit of Humanity. Now this was breathed by God into man directly from
Himself, and is therefore of the same character as the Primal Element:
"And when I have fashioned him and breathed My spirit into him." (Cor.
cap. 15, v. 29). The Sufis do not interpret this of the Life, but of the
Spirit of Humanity, and say that it is frequently not attained until a
late period of life, thirty or even eighty years. Before man can <span
class="margnote">how acquired.</span> receive this Spirit of Humanity he
must be furnished with capacity, which is only to be acquired by
purifying oneself from all evil and immoral qualities and dispositions,
and adorning oneself with the opposite ones. Sheikh Muhíy-uddín ibn ul
’Arabí <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md), in his "Investigations"
(<span id="img_05500"></span> ![](img/05500.jpg)), says that the words
"and when I have fashioned him," refer to this preparation, and the rest
of the sentence, "and breathed My spirit into him," refers to the
accession of the Spirit of Humanity.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

Two conditions are therefore imposed upon the Traveller, first, to
attain Humanity, second, to acquire capacity.

There are three developments of character that must be suppressed before
man can attain to Humanity; the animal, the brutal, and the fiendish. He
who only eats and sleeps, and gives way to lust, is mere animal; if
besides these he gives way to anger and cruelty, he is brutal; and if in
addition to 'all these he is crafty, lying, and deceitful, he is
fiendish.

If the Traveller is moderate in his food, rest, and desires, and strives
to attain a knowledge of himself and of God, then is the time for
acquiring capacity by freeing himself from all that is evil and base,
and adorning himself with the opposite qualities; after that by prayer
he may obtain the Spirit of Humanity. <span class="margnote">constitutes
real immortality.</span> Some one has truly said that there is none of
the perfection, essence, or immortality of man, save only among such as
are "created with a godly disposition." When the Traveller has once been
revivified by the Spirit of Humanity he becomes immortal, and inherits
everlasting life. This is why it has been said that "man has a beginning
but no end."

<span class="margnote">The Divine Light.</span>If when he has attained
this Spirit of Humanity, he is earnest, and does not waste his life in
trifling, he soon arrives at the Divine Light itself. For "God guideth
whom He pleaseth unto His Light." The attainment of this light is the
completion of Man's upward progress, but no one can attain to it but
those who are pure in spirit and in their lives.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mohammed asserted
that he himself had attained it, "To the light have I reached, and in
the light I live;" now this light is the Nature of God; wherefore he
said " who seeth me seeth God."

The germ that contains the Primal Element of <span class="margnote">The
Origin and Return of Man.</span> Man is the lowest of the low, and the
Divine Light is the highest of the high; it is between these extremes
that the stages of man's upward or downward progress lie. "We have
created man in the fairest of proportions, and then have thrown him back
to be the lowest of the low, save only such as believe and act with
righteousness; and verily these shall have their reward." (Cor. cap. 95,
v. 4). This reward is said by the Sufis to be defined by the word
*ajrat*, "reward," itself. This word contains three radical letters
<span id="img_05700"></span> ![](img/05700.jpg) <span
id="img_05701"></span> ![](img/05701.jpg) and <span
id="img_05702"></span> ![](img/05702.jpg); <span id="img_05700"></span>
![](img/05700.jpg) stands for <span id="img_05703"></span>
![](img/05703.jpg) "return," <span id="img_05701"></span>
![](img/05701.jpg) for <span id="img_05704"></span> ![](img/05704.jpg)
"paradise" and <span id="img_05702"></span> ![](img/05702.jpg) for <span
id="img_05705"></span> ![](img/05705.jpg), that is "those who have
handed down the faith." Their acting righteously is their return to the
Nature of God, for when they have finished their upward progress, and
reached this they are in Paradise, and in the presence of their God. He
therefore is a man, in the true sense of the word, who being sent down
upon earth strives upward towards Heaven. These aspirations are
indispensable to man; he might by the Almighty Power of God exist
without all beside, even had the Heavens and the elements themselves
never been; but these things are the aim and want of all.

It has been said that the Primal Element or <span class="margnote">The
Spirit of Humanity identical with the Primal Element.</span>
constructive spirit as well as the Spirit of Humanity

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

proceed direct from God. They are therefore identical, and are both
included by the Sufis in the one term Concomitant Spirit. Now this
Spirit, although distinct and individual, comprehends and governs the
entire Universe. The Simple Natures are its administrators and
exponents; of these the Seven Sires beget, and the Four Mothers conceive
from the incarnation of this spirit in them, and their offspring is the
triple kingdom, Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal. And so it is with the
Lesser World of Man.

Now this Spirit hath two functions, external and internal; the external
is revealed in the material generation just alluded to, the internal
abides in the heart of man. Whosoever purifies his heart from worldly
impressions and desires reveals this internal function of the Spirit
within him, and illumines and revivifies his soul.

Thus the Spirit at once comprehends the Universe and dwells in the heart
of man.
