## <span id="INTRODUCTION"></span>INTRODUCTION

   WHEN Mohammad established Islâm in Arabia he insisted that he was not
proclaiming a new religion, for he believed that all the prophets who
preceded him had brought the same message. From time to time God had
sent prophets and had revealed His will in sacred books; but men were
rebellious, and so it was necessary for Him periodically to send a new
prophet to lead them back to the truth. Mohammad had no sense of any
gradual development in the knowledge of God, for he held that a
knowledge of the true religion had been given to man from the beginning.
The reason why God needed to send prophets with fresh revelations was
because men had fallen away from the truth and required to be called
back to it. Thus men like Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and himself had all the
same task set before them, and none of them was essentially different
from any other. God might authorise one to abrogate certain practices
which had been commanded by a predecessor, but in essential matters they
were all engaged in the same task, which was to proclaim the unity of
God and summon men to worship Him alone.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

   This being Mohammad's belief, it naturally follows that he was unable
to accept what Christians taught regarding the person of Jesus. To him
Jesus was no more than a prophet, even though He is accorded a dignity
which is given to no other. The <u>K</u>orân speaks of the Virgin Birth;
calls Jesus God's Word and a spirit from Him; declares that He is
"eminent in this world and the next, and one of those who approach God's
presence;" and attributes wonderful miracles to Him. But Mohammad could
not admit that He was anything more than other men. He understood the
doctrine of His Sonship in a carnal sense, and therefore he very
naturally denied it vigorously. As an example of the Muslim rejection of
this doctrine, one might quote the argument of Abû \`Othman \`Amr Ibn
Ba<u>h</u>r al Jâ<u>h</u>i<u>z</u>, who lived in the ninth century of
our era. He said that if God is a Father, He must also be a grandfather
and an uncle; and insisted that the birth of Jesus was not so unique as
that of Adam and Eve, for they had neither father nor mother.

   The purpose of this volume is to present an account of Jesus as He
appears in the works of Muslim writers. I have collected the relevant
passages from the <u>K</u>orân, of which I give my own translation, and
I hope that it will not be found that I have inadvertently omitted any.
I have confined myself to those passages which <span id="page_9">p.
9</span> make a definite reference to Jesus, omitting those which are
merely directed towards Christians with no particular reference to
Jesus. No attempt has been made to arrange these passages so as to give
a chronological account of the life and teaching of Jesus; they are
presented in the order in which they occur in the <u>K</u>orân. I have
added a few selections from Tha\`labî's *<u>K</u>i<u>s</u>as al Anbiyâ´*
(Stories of the Prophets), along with one passage from Abû al Fidâ's
*Universal History*. The ultimate source of this latter work is Tabarî's
history, but I have chosen Abû al Fidâ's account rather than Tabari's
because it is shorter.

   The main part of this volume consists of sayings attributed to Jesus
and stories about Him which are found in the writings of various Muslim
writers. Professor Margoliouth collected 77 passages, 71 of which are
from Ghazâlî's *I<u>h</u>yâ´ \`Ulûm ad Dîn* (Revival of the Religious
Sciences), and 6 from other sources. These were published in five parts
in vol. v of the *Expository Times* (1893-4). Michaël Asin y Palacios,
the professor of Arabic in Madrid University, has published a work in
two parts, entitled *Logia et Agrapha nomini Jesu apud Moslemicos
Scriptores, asceticos præsertim, usitata*, which contains 233 passages.
It is published in *Patrologia Orientalis*, vols. xiii and xix. The
first volume deals with Ghazâlî's work referred <span id="page_10">p.
10</span> to above, with the addition of parallel passages from other
writers; and the second consists of passages from various writers.
Margoliouth's collection gives a translation of the passages with
occasional explanatory notes; Asin gives the Arabic text of all but the
last eight passages, with a Latin translation and notes in Latin. Asin
includes some passages which refer to John the Baptist, Zechariah, and
Mary which I have not translated, as they do not come within the purpose
of this book. I have also omitted variants and the passages of which the
Arabic text is not given. In both these collections the passages are
given in the order in which they occur in the sources from which they
are taken, but I have not followed this order. For the sake of showing
various aspects of the Muslim representation of Jesus, I have attempted
to group the passages under several headings.

   Both collections number the passages, so I have indicated the numbers
for the benefit of those who care to refer to them. To save space, "A."
is used for Asin's collection, and "M." for Margoliouth's. References
are also given to the other passages. The numbers of the surahs and the
verses in the <u>K</u>orân are given. "Th." stands for Tha\`labî's
stories, the pages to which reference is made being those in the edition
which I used, that printed in Cairo in 1310 A.H. (1892 A.D.). "A.F."
stands for Abû al Fidâ, the <span id="page_11">p. 11</span> edition
referred to being Fleischer's, published in Leipzig in 1831.

   In the passages which are translated in this volume it will be seen
that Jesus is treated as merely a prophet and teacher, who is not
necessarily better than other pious people. One should beware of laying
too much stress on the title "Spirit of God" by which He is frequently
addressed, for this is merely an echo of words used in the <u>K</u>orân.
He is represented as feeling Himself less worthy to pray for rain than a
man who had plucked out his eye because it had looked at a woman ([A.
10](#A10), p. 95.md); He is described as being gloomy in contrast to John
the Baptist, who was cheerful, and whom God commends as being the more
attractive ([A. 121](#A121), p. 108.md); He is rebuked by God for failing
to understand the piety of a simple man ([A. 208](#A208), p. 125.md); He
takes warning when He finds that Satan has discovered some evil in Him
([A. 174](#A174) *bis*, p. 76.md). All this is quite in keeping with the
Muslim conception of His person; but it naturally raises a question as
to whether there can be any element of genuineness in such passages.

   The problem of determining the origin of the sayings and stories is a
difficult one. In some instances it is obvious that the writer had
access to the New Testament, or more probably had a second-hand
knowledge of it, and so made a fairly accurate quotation, e.g. [A.
55](#A55), p. 46, <span id="page_12">p. 12</span> [A. 65](#A65.md), p. 47.
In dealing with other sayings one hesitates to pronounce an opinion as
to their genuineness or otherwise. It is important to notice that Asin
is convinced that some of the sayings are genuine, although he does not
commit himself absolutely to this position. When he comes to a saying
which he feels is genuine, his favourite phrase is "Agraphum mihi
videtur." The Rev. R. Dunkerley published two excellent articles in the
*Expository Times* of January and February 1928, on "The Muhammadan
Agrapha," in which he is inclined to support Asin's feeling that some
sayings are genuine; and he gives four reasons for doing so. (1) It is
reasonable to expect that unrecorded sayings of Jesus had long been
cherished in out-of-the-way parts of Arabia and Mesopotamia. (2) When
the ascription to Jesus is definite, unchallenged, and of early date,
and when several witnesses agree, there are grounds for holding a saying
to be genuine. (3) If a passage contains teaching alien to or opposed to
Islâm it may be taken as coming from a Christian source. (4) If a saying
has the aptness and precision characteristic of Gospel sayings, we may
be disposed to accept it. These are sound principles of judgment, but
there must always be a doubt.

   In many instances, however, one need have little doubt about
rejecting the genuineness of passages. The wonderful stories of the
raising <span id="page_13">p. 13</span> of the dead, a speaking skull,
etc., are obvious fictions. Such a story as [A. 148](#A148.md), p. 114,
which speaks of a mountain bewailing the fact that idols had been hewn
from it, is clearly of Muslim origin, as it is based on some words from
the <u>K</u>orân. But [A. 215](#A215.md), p. 93, is strange, for while it
quotes words which are attributed to Jesus in the <u>K</u>orân, it adds
to them something which would seem to have a Christian origin.

   The large number of ascetic passages may surprise some readers, but
one must remember that the Nestorian Church in Mesopotamia laid great
emphasis on asceticism, and that many of their monks secluded themselves
in the deserts of Arabia. It may well be that one source of these
sayings is to be found in this region. Another point to note is that
there is a greater element of asceticism in the sayings of Jesus
recorded in the New Testament than one commonly recognises. But even
allowing for these considerations, one cannot help feeling that a great
amount of this group of sayings is the growth of a later age when
asceticism was regarded by many as necessary for salvation.

   As regards Tha\`labî's stories, and also some passages in the
<u>K</u>orân, one is able to suggest an origin for some of them in
apocryphal Gospels. For example, the story of Jesus being sent to learn
the trade of dyeing has a parallel in the Gospel of Thomas, where He is
said to have <span id="page_14">p. 14</span> accompanied Mary on a visit
to a dyer. The same Gospel has a story in which Jesus changed some
children into goats, which suggests an origin for Tha\`labî's story of
their being changed into swine. There is a passage in the Book of James,
or Protevangelium, which speaks of the priests using rods to see who
should have charge of Mary, which corresponds to the <u>K</u>orânic
story. In the same book Mary is rebuked for unchastity, but this differs
from the <u>K</u>orânic passage in that it speaks of this as happening
before the birth of Jesus. The <u>K</u>orân speaks of Jesus making a
bird of clay, while the Gospel of Thomas speaks of His having made
twelve sparrows of clay. The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew says that when
Mary was on her way to Egypt, a palm-tree bowed down to let her pluck
its fruit and a spring burst forth, which is reminiscent of the
<u>K</u>orânic story where, before the birth of Jesus, a streamlet
appears and Mary is told that if she shakes the trunk of a palm-tree it
will drop fresh dates. The Gospels of Thomas and of Pseudo-Matthew have
also a story similar to that found in [A. 206](#A206.md), p. 92. These are
only a few parallels which have come to my notice, but they suggest that
many of the sayings and stories may have come through Christian
channels, and have been accepted in good faith by Muslims, although such
as the above are clearly apocryphal. But this indicates that <span
id="page_15">p. 15</span> even if a Christian source can be found for
many of the passages, it does not necessarily follow that they give us
genuine words of Jesus or genuine stories about him.

   E. J. Jenkinson, in an article on "Jesus in Moslem Tradition" in the
*Moslem World* of July 1928, gives a parallel from Jewish tradition of
Tha\`labî's story of the blind man and the lame man, which raises the
question as to whether some of the passages are not to be attributed to
Jewish sources; and in this connection it is interesting to note that
Asin has here and there indicated that sayings which are attributed to
Jesus are reminiscent of passages in the Old Testament. And again, it is
not unlikely that certain aphorisms or moral stories which had come down
for generations were attached to Jesus, although originally they had no
connection with Him.

   While this discussion necessarily deals very indefinitely with the
question of origins, it should be pointed out that Muslims had ample
opportunity of coming into contact with Christians from whom they may
well have learned some of their traditions. In the time of Mohammad
Arabia was surrounded by a number of Christian communities. From
Mesopotamia and Syria Christianity extended to the peoples of
<u>H</u>ira and Ghassân in North Arabia, and to some of the tribes of
the neighbourhood. In the south <span id="page_16">p. 16</span>
Christianity had long been represented; and about the time of Mohammad's
birth an attempt was made to divert the worship of the Arabs from the
ka\`ba in Mecca to a Christian church which had been built in San\`â´ in
the Yemen; but the expedition was a failure. In Nejrân there was a
Christian church which had undergone severe persecution not long before
this.

   When Islâm gained in strength, members of Christian tribes were
gradually absorbed into the new religion, and before long Christianity
was wiped out of Arabia. But as the conquests extended beyond the bounds
of Arabia the Muslims came into contact with other Christian
communities. Christians were given the alternative of accepting Islâm or
paying tribute; and while many adopted Islâm, many others retained their
religion. The Christians were commonly given very fair treatment, and,
especially in the early days, many of them were employed in Government
offices.

   Thus the Muslim community had in its midst two groups from whom it
was possible to gather information regarding Jesus: the Christian
communities and converts from Christianity to Islâm.

 

   *Note*.--In addition to the passages mentioned on p. 10, it has been
found necessary to omit A. 218, 219, 224 owing to considerations of
space.

PASSAGES FROM THE <u>K</u>ORÂN

   <span id="II:81"></span>*II*, 81.--And We have brought Moses the Book
and sent the apostles after him. And We have brought Jesus, son of Mary,
the proofs, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit.

   <span id="II:254"></span>*II*, 254.--And We brought Jesus, son of
Mary, the proofs, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit.

   <span id="III:31"></span>*III*, 31.--When the wife of \`Imrân said,
"My Lord, verily I have vowed to Thee that which is in my womb,
dedicated \[to Thee\], so accept \[it\] from me; verily Thou art He who
hears and knows." Then when she gave birth she said, "My Lord, verily I
have given birth to a female" (and God knew well what she had given
birth to); "and a male is not like a female; and verily I have called
her Mary, and verily I commend her and her offspring to Thy protection
from the accursed Satan."

   <span id="III:37"></span>*III*, 37-52.--And when the angels said, "O
Mary, verily God has chosen you and purified <span id="page_18">p.
18</span> you and chosen you above the women of the worlds. O Mary, obey
your Lord, and worship and bow down with those who bow down." That is
one of the pieces of information regarding the unseen which We reveal to
you, although you were not with them when they were casting their reeds
\[to see\] which of them should have charge of Mary, and were not with
them when they were disputing. When the angels said, "O Mary, verily God
gives you good news of a Word from Him, whose name shall be the Messiah,
Jesus, son of Mary, eminent in this world and the next, and one of those
who approach God's presence. And he shall speak to men in the cradle and
when he is grown up, and shall be one of the upright." She said, "My
Lord, how can I have a son when no man has touched me?" He said, "Thus
God creates what He wills; when He decrees a thing, He only says to it,
'Be,' and it comes into being. And He will teach him the Book, and
wisdom, and the Torah, and the Gospel; and \[will appoint him\] an
apostle to the Children of Israel, \[saying\], 'I have brought you a
sign from your Lord. Verily I will create for you of clay something like
a bird and will blow into it, and it will become a bird by God's
permission; and I will cure the blind from birth and the leper, and will
raise the dead by God's permission, and will inform you about what you
shall eat and what <span id="page_19">p. 19</span> you shall store up in
your houses. Verily in that is a sign for you, if you are believers. And
\[I come\] confirming what is before me with respect to the Torah, and
to make lawful for you some of that which has been forbidden you. And I
have brought you a sign from your Lord; so fear God and obey me. Verily
God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him; this is a straight path.'"
But when Jesus perceived their unbelief he said, "Who will be my helpers
towards God?" The disciples said, "We will be God's helpers; we believe
in God and witness that we are Muslims. O our Lord, we believe in what
Thou hast sent down, and we have followed the apostle; so write us down
with those who bear witness." And they plotted, but God plotted, and God
is the best of plotters. When God said, "O Jesus, verily I will cause
you to die, and will raise you to Myself, and will cleanse you from
those who are unbelievers, and will put those who followed you above
those who were unbelievers until the Day of Resurrection; then to Me
will be your return. \[*This last phrase is not addressed to Jesus, as
the pronoun is plural.*\] And I will judge between you about that in
which you disagree. Then as regards those who were unbelievers, I will
punish them severely in this world and the next, and they shall have no
helpers." And as regards those who believed and did good deeds, He will
pay <span id="page_20">p. 20</span> them their rewards, for God does not
love the unjust. That do We recite to you of the signs and the wise
reminder. Verily Jesus in the sight of God is like Adam whom He created
of earth, then said to him, "Be," and he came into being.

   <span id="IV:154"></span>*IV*, 154-157.--Because of their unbelief
and their speaking great slander against Mary, and their saying, "Verily
we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, God's apostle." But they
did not kill him, and they did not crucify him, but one was made to
appear to them like him. And verily those who disagreed about him are in
doubt regarding him; they have no knowledge of him but the following of
opinion, and they did not really kill him. On the contrary, God raised
him to Himself; and God is mighty and wise. And there shall not be any
of the people of the Book who will not believe in him before his death;
and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.

   <span id="IV:169"></span>*IV*, 169, 170.--O people of the Book, do
not be fanatical in your religion, and do not say anything but the truth
about God. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, is only God's apostle and
His Word which He cast into Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in
God and His apostles, and do not say, "\[He is\] three." Abstain, and it
will be better for you. God is only one God. Far be it from Him that He
should have a son! <span id="page_21">p. 21</span> What is in the
heavens and what is in the earth are His, and God suffices as Governor.
The Messiah does not scorn to be a servant of God, nor do the angels who
are near His presence. All those who scorn His worship and are proud
will He gather to Himself.

   <span id="V:19"></span>*V*, 19.--They have disbelieved who said,
"Verily God is the Messiah, son of Mary." Say, "Who could prevent God at
all if He wished to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother,
and all who are in the earth?"

   <span id="V:50"></span>*V*, 50, 51, \[following on reference to
previous prophets\].--And we made Jesus, son of Mary, follow in their
traces, verifying what was before him respecting the Torah; and we
brought him the Gospel in which is guidance and light; and \[he was\]
verifying what was before him with respect to the Torah, and was a
guidance and warning to the God-fearing. And let the people of the
Gospel judge by what God has sent down in it; but whoever does not judge
by what God has sent down, those are the impious.

   <span id="V:76"></span>*V*, 76-79.--They have disbelieved who said,
"Verily God is the Messiah, son of Mary," when the Messiah said, "O
Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord." Verily he who
takes a partner to God, God has forbidden Paradise to him, and his
destination will be hell, and the unjust will have no helpers. They have
disbelieved who said, "Verily God is the third <span id="page_22">p.
22</span> of three," when there is no God but one God; and if they do
not abstain from what they say, a painful punishment will befall those
of them who disbelieved. Will they not turn to God in repentance and ask
His pardon? For God is forgiving and compassionate. The Messiah, son of
Mary, was only an apostle--the apostles have passed away before him--and
his mother was an upright woman; they were both eating food.

   <span id="V:82"></span>*V*, 82.--Those of the Children of Israel who
disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of David and of Jesus, son of
Mary. That was because they were disobedient and were transgressors.

   <span id="V:109"></span>*V*, 109-118.--When God said, "O Jesus, son
of Mary, remember my favour to you and to your mother when I
strengthened you by the Holy Spirit; you were speaking to men in the
cradle and when grown up; and when I taught you the Book and wisdom, and
the Torah and the Gospel; and when you were creating from clay something
like a bird by My permission and were blowing into it and it was
becoming a bird by My permission; and you were curing the blind from
birth and the leper by My permission; and when you were raising the dead
by My permission; and when I turned away the Children of Israel from you
when you brought them the proofs, then those of them who disbelieved
said, 'This is nothing but clear magic;' and when I revealed to the
disciples, 'Believe <span id="page_23">p. 23</span> in Me and My
apostles,' they said, 'We believe and witness that we are Muslims.'"

   When the disciples said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, is your Lord able to
send down to us a table from heaven?" he said, "Fear God if you are
believers." They said, "We wish to eat of it that our hearts may be at
rest, and that we may know that you have spoken the truth to us, and
that we may be witnesses to it." Jesus, son of Mary, said, "O God our
Lord, send down to us a table from heaven which will be a feast for us,
for the first of us and the last of us, and a sign from Thee. And give
us provision, for Thou art the best of providers." God said, "Verily I
am sending it down to you, so whoever of you disbelieves afterwards, I
will punish him in a way in which I will not punish anyone in the
worlds."

   And when God said, "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to men, 'Take
me and my mother as gods besides God?'" he said, "Praise be to God! It
is not fitting for me to say what is not mine by right. If I had said it
Thou wouldest have known it; Thou knowest what is in my soul, but I do
not know what is in Thy soul; verily Thou art the Knower of hidden
things. I said to them only what Thou commanddest me, 'Worship God, my
Lord and your Lord,' and I was a witness against them as long as I was
among them. If Thou punishest them, they are Thy servants; and if Thou
<span id="page_24">p. 24</span> forgivest them, Thou art the mighty and
the wise One."

   <span id="VI:84"></span>*VI*, 84-90.--And We gave him \[Abraham\]
Isaac and Jacob, both We guided, and Noah We guided formerly; and of his
seed were David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron, and
thus do We reward those who do good; and Zechariah and John and Jesus
and Elijah, all were of the upright; and Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah
and Lot, and we favoured them all above the worlds; and some of their
fathers and offspring and brethren, and We chose them and guided them to
a straight path. That is God's guidance with which He guides those of
His servants whom He wills; but if they had been idolaters, what they
were doing would have been fruitless. Those were they to whom We brought
the Book and authority and prophecy; so if these disbelieve in it, We
will put it in trust of a people who will not disbelieve in it. Those
are they whom God guides, so follow their guidance.

   <span id="IX:30"></span>*IX*, 30-32.--The Jews said, "Ezra is the son
of God;" and the Christians said, "The Messiah is the son of God." That
is their saying with their mouths. They imitate what former disbelievers
said. God fight with them! How are they turned away! They have taken
their doctors and monks as lords besides God, and the Messiah, son of
Mary, when they were commanded to worship only one God. There is <span
id="page_25">p. 25</span> no God but He. Far be He from what they
associate with Him! They wish to extinguish God's light with their
mouths, and God refuses but to perfect His light, even if the
unbelievers dislike it.

   <span id="XIX:16"></span>*XIX*, 16-34.--And mention in the Book Mary,
when she withdrew from her people in an eastern place and took a veil
apart from them. Then We sent Our spirit to her, and he appeared to her
as a well-formed man. She said, "Verily I take refuge in the Merciful
from you if you are God-fearing." He replied, "I am only the messenger
of your Lord to give you a pure boy." She said, "How can I have a boy
when no man has touched me, and I am not a prostitute?" He replied,
"Thus has your Lord said, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a
sign to men and a mercy from Us, and it is a matter that is decreed.'"
Then she conceived him and withdrew with him to a remote place; and the
pangs of child-birth made her come to the trunk of a palm-tree. She
said, "Would that I had died before this and had been forgotten and
unremembered!" Then he called to her from under her, "Do not grieve;
your Lord has put a streamlet below you; and shake towards you the trunk
of the palm-tree, and it will let fresh, ripe dates fall on you; so eat
and drink and refresh yourself. And if you see anyone, say, 'Verily I
have vowed a fast to the Merciful, <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> so I
will not speak to a human being to-day.'" Then she brought him to her
people, carrying him. They said, "O Mary, you have brought an
extraordinary thing. O sister of Aaron, your father was not a bad man
and your mother was not a prostitute." Then she pointed to him. They
said, "How can we speak to one who is a boy in the cradle?" He said,
"Verily I am God's servant. He has brought me the Book and has made me a
prophet and made me blessed wherever I am, and has enjoined on me prayer
and alms as long as I live and filial piety to my mother, and He has not
made me proud and miserable. And peace be upon me the day I was born and
the day I die and the day I am raised up alive!" This is Jesus, son of
Mary, the Word of truth, about whom they doubt. It was not fitting for
God that He should beget any son. Praise be to Him! When He decrees
anything, He only says to it, "Be," and it comes into being.

   <span id="XXI:91"></span>*XXI*, 91.--And \[remember\] her who
preserved her chastity and in whom We breathed of Our spirit, and made
her and her son a sign to the worlds.

   <span id="XXIII:52"></span>*XXIII*, 52.--And We made the son of Mary
and his mother a sign, and gave them shelter in a hill possessed of
security and running water.

   <span id="XXXIII:7"></span>*XXXIII*, 7.--And \[remember\] when We
received from the prophets their covenant, and <span id="page_27">p.
27</span> from you, and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus, son
of Mary; and We received from them a strong covenant.

   <span id="XLII:11"></span>*XLII*, 11.--He has ordained to you with
respect to religion what He enjoined on Noah and what We revealed to
you, and what We enjoined on Abraham and Moses and Jesus, viz.
"Establish the religion, and do not divide concerning it."

   <span id="XLIII:57"></span>*XLIII*, 57-65.--And when the son of Mary
was quoted as an example, behold! your people were turning away from
him, and they said, "Are our gods better, or he?" They have only quoted
him out of skill in argument; verily they are a quarrelsome people. He
is only a servant on whom We bestowed favour and whom We made an example
to the Children of Israel. And if We pleased, We could make from among
you angels succeeding you in the earth; And verily he is a sign \[*lit*.
knowledge\] of the \[last\] hour; so do not doubt it, and follow me.
This is a straight path. And let not the devil turn you away; verily he
is to you a sure enemy. And when Jesus brought the proofs he said, "I
have brought you wisdom, and will make clear to you some of that about
which you differ; so fear God and obey me. Verily God is my Lord and
your Lord, so worship Him. Verily this is a straight path." Then the
parties among them disagreed. So woe to those who did unjustly, because
of the punishment of a painful day!

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

   <span id="LVII:26"></span>*LVII*, 26, 27.--And We have sent Noah and
Abraham and have put in their offspring prophecy and the Book, and some
of them were rightly guided, but many of them were impious. Then We
caused Our apostles to follow in their traces and We caused Jesus, son
of Mary, to follow; and We brought him the Gospel and put gentleness and
compassion in the hearts of those who followed him. But as for the
monastic state, they invented it. We prescribed for them only desire for
the acceptance of God; but they did not observe it as it ought to be
observed. So We gave their reward to those of them who believed, but
many of them were impious.

   <span id="LXI:6"></span>*LXI*, 6.--And when Jesus, son of Mary, said,
"O Children of Israel, verily I am God's apostle to you verifying what
was before me with respect to the Torah and bringing good news of an
apostle who will come after me whose name will be A<u>h</u>mad." Then
when he brought them the I proofs they said, "This is clear magic."

   <span id="LXI:14"></span>*LXI*, 14.--O you who believe, be God's
helpers, as Jesus, son of Mary, said to the disciples, "Who will be my
helpers towards God?" The disciples said, "We will be God's helpers."
Then a section of the Children of Israel believed, but a section
disbelieved; and God strengthened those who believed against their
enemy, and they became conquerors.

TRADITIONAL STORIES

   *Th.*, p. 243.--Ka\`b al A<u>h</u>bâr said: Jesus, son of Mary, was a
ruddy man, inclined to white; he did not have long hair, and he never
anointed his head. Jesus used to walk barefoot, and he took no house, or
adornment, or goods, or clothes, or provision except his day's food.
Wherever the sun set he arranged his feet in prayer till the morning
came. He was curing the blind from birth and the leper and raising the
dead by God's permission and was telling his people what they were
eating in their houses and what they were storing up for the morrow
\[cf. [<u>K</u>orân III, 43](#III:37.md)\], and he was walking on the
surface of the water in the sea. His head was dishevelled and his face
was small; he was an ascetic in the world, longing for the next world
and eager for the worship of God. He was a pilgrim in the earth till the
Jews sought him and desired to kill him. Then God raised him up to
heaven; and God knows best.

   *Th.*, pp. 241, 242. \[The following is a version of the story of the
Wise Men from the East.\]--That night people went out repairing to him
<span id="page_30">p. 30</span> because of a star which had risen. They
had been told formerly in the Book of Daniel that the rising of that
star would be one of the signs of him who was to be born. So they went
out seeking him, and took with them gold, myrrh, and frankincense. They
passed one of the kings of Syria who asked them, "Where are you making
for?" and they told him about that. He said, "What is the meaning of the
myrrh, gold, and frankincense? Will you present him with these things?"
They replied, "Those represent him, because gold is the lord of all
goods, similarly this prophet (God bless him and grant him peace!) is
the lord of the people of his time; and because what is broken and
wounded is put right with myrrh, similarly God will heal by this prophet
(God bless him and grant him peace!) all who are infirm and ill; and
because the smoke of frankincense and no other smoke enters heaven,
similarly God will raise this prophet (God bless him and grant him
peace!) and no other prophet of his time to heaven." When they said that
to that king he decided to kill him, so he said to them, "Go away, and
when you learn where he is, tell me about that, for I wish the same with
respect to him as you do." They set off until they came to Mary and gave
her (Peace be upon her!) the present that was with them. And they
desired to return to that king to tell him where he was, but an angel
met them and <span id="page_31">p. 31</span> said to them, "Do not
return to him and do not tell him where he is, for he only wanted to
kill him." So they went off another way.

   *Th.*, pp. 243, 244.--Wahb said: The first sign which the people saw
from Jesus was that his mother was living in the house of a village
headman in the land of Egypt, to which Joseph the carpenter had brought
her when he went with her to Egypt, and the poor used to repair to that
headman's house. Some money belonging to that headman was stolen from
his treasury, but he did not suspect the poor, and Mary was grieved over
the affliction of that headman. When Jesus saw his mother's grief over
her host's affliction he said to her, "Mother, do you want me to guide
him to his money?" She replied, "Yes, my son." He said, "Tell him to
gather the poor for me in his house." So Mary said that to the headman
and he gathered the poor for him. When they had collected he went to two
of them, one of whom was blind and the other lame, and lifted the lame
man on to the blind man's shoulder, and said to him, "Rise up with him."
The blind man replied, "I am too weak for that." Jesus said to him, "How
were you strong enough for it yesterday?" When they heard him saying
that, they beat the blind man till he arose, and when he stood up the
lame man reached to the window of the treasury. Then Jesus said to the
headman, <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> "Thus they schemed against your
property yesterday, because the blind man sought the help of his
strength and the lame man of his eyes." Then the blind man and the lame
man said, "He has spoken the truth, by God! " and restored all his money
to the headman. He took it and put it in his treasury and said, "O Mary,
take half of it." She replied, "I was not created for that." The headman
said, "Then give it to your son." She replied, "He is greater in rank
than I."

   Soon after the headman gave a marriage-feast for a son of his. He
prepared a feast for him and gathered all the people of Egypt to it and
was feeding them for two months. Then when that came to an end some
people from Syria visited him, but the headman did not know about them
till they arrived, and that day he had no wine. When Jesus saw his
concern about that, he entered one of the headman's houses in which were
two rows of jars and Jesus passed his hand over their mouths while he
was walking by; and every time he passed his hand over a jar it became
full of wine, until Jesus came to the last of them. And at that time he
was twelve years old.

   Another sign. As Sadî said: When Jesus (Peace be upon him!) was in
the school, he used to tell the boys what their fathers were doing; and
he would say to a boy, "Go \[home\], for <span id="page_33">p. 33</span>
your people have been eating such and such and have prepared \[?\] such
and such for you and they are eating such and such." So the boy would go
home to his people and would cry till they gave him that thing. Then
they would say to him, "Who told you about this?" and he would say,
"Jesus." So they shut away their boys from him and said, "Do not play
with this magician." So they gathered them in a house, and Jesus came
looking for them. Then they said, "They are not here." He said to them,
"Then what is in this house?" They replied, "Swine." He said, "Let them
be swine." So when they opened the door for them, lo! they were swine.
That spread among the people, and the Children of Israel were troubled
about it. So when his mother was afraid concerning him she put him on an
ass of hers and went in flight to Egypt.

   *Th.*, p. 244.--\`Atâ´ said: When Mary had taken Jesus from the
school, she handed him over to various trades, and the last to which she
entrusted him was to the dyers; so she handed him over to their chief
that he might learn from him. Now the man had various clothes with him,
and he had to go on a journey, so he said to Jesus, "You have learned
this trade, and I am going on a journey from which I shall not return
for ten days. These clothes are of different colours, and I have marked
every one of them with the <span id="page_34">p. 34</span> colour with
which it is to be dyed, so I want you to be finished with them when I
return." Then he went out. Jesus (Peace be upon him!) prepared one
receptacle with one colour and put all the clothes in it and said to
them, "Be, by God's permission, according to what is expected of you."
Then the dyer came, and all the clothes were in one receptacle, so he
said, "O Jesus, what have you done?" He replied, "I have finished them."
He said, "Where are they?" He replied, "In the receptacle." He said,
"All of them?" He replied, "Yes." He said, "How are they all in one
receptacle? You have spoiled those clothes." He replied, "Rise and
look." So he arose, and Jesus took out a yellow garment and a green
garment and a red garment until he had taken them out according to the
colours which he desired. Then the dyer began to wonder, and he knew
that that was from God (Great and glorious is He!). Then the dyer said
to the people, "Come and look at what Jesus (Peace be upon him!) has
done." So he and his companions, and they were the disciples, believed
on him; and God (Great and glorious is He!) knows best.

   *Th.*, p. 245.--His prayer by which he was curing the sick and
bringing the dead to life was: O God, Thou art the God of those who are
in heaven and of those who are on earth; there is no god in them other
than Thee. And Thou art <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> the almighty One
of those who are in the heavens and the almighty One of those who are on
earth; there is no almighty one in them other than Thee. And Thou art
the King of those who are in the heavens and the King of those who are
on earth; there is no king in them other than Thee. And Thou art the
Judge of those who are in the heavens and of those who are on earth;
there is no judge in them other than Thee. Thy power on earth is like
Thy power in heaven, and Thy authority on earth is like Thy authority in
heaven. I ask Thee by Thy noble names. Verily Thou art omnipotent.

   *Th.*, p. 245.--Ibn \`Abbâs said: They \[the disciples\] were
fishermen who were catching fish, and Jesus passed them and said to
them, "What are you doing?" They replied, "We are catching fish." He
said to them, "Will you not come with me that you may catch men?" They
replied to him, "How do you mean?" He said, "We will summon men to God."
They replied, "And who are you?" He said, "I am Jesus, son of Mary,
God's servant and apostle." They asked, "Is any of the prophets above
you?" He replied, "Yes, the Arabian prophet." So those men followed him
and believed on him and set out with him. As Sadî said: They were
sailors. Ibn Ar<u>t</u>ât said: They were fullers and were called that
\[<u>H</u>awârîyûn\] because they made clothes white.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

   Ibn Fat<u>h</u>awaih told us in his tradition from Mus\`ab as
follows: The disciples were twelve men who followed Jesus; and when they
were hungry they said, "O Spirit of God, we are hungry;" then he would
strike the ground with his hand, whether on the plain or on a mountain,
and two loaves would appear for each man and they would eat them. And
when they were thirsty they said, "O Spirit of God, we are thirsty;"
then he would strike the ground with his hand, whether on the plain or
on a mountain, and water would appear and they would drink. They said,
"O Spirit of God, who is better off than we are? When we wish you feed
us, and when we wish you give us drink, and we believe in you and have
followed you." He replied, "He is better off than you who works with his
hand and eats what he has earned." The narrator said: So they began to
make clothes for wages.

   *Th.*, p. 246.--It is related that Jesus (Peace be upon him!) passed
a monastery in which were two blind men and said, "What are these?" The
reply was given to him, "These are people who sought death and blinded
themselves with their hands." So he said to them, "What urged you to
this?" They replied, "We feared the punishment of death, so we did what
you see ourselves." Then he said, "You are the learned and the wise and
the monks and the excellent <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> ones. Rub
your eyes with your hands and say, 'In the name of God.'" So they did
that, and lo! they were both standing seeing.

   *Th.*, p. 247.--Al Kalbî said, "Jesus was raising the dead by means
of "O Living One! O Eternal One!"

   *Th.*, p. 247.--It is related that he went out one day in his
wandering accompanied by one of his companions who was a short man who
attached himself greatly to Jesus. Then when Jesus came to the sea he
said, "In the name of God, with health and certainty;" then he walked on
the surface of the water. Then the short man said, "In the name of God,
with health and certainty;" and he walked on the surface of the water.
Then wonder entered him and he said, "This is Jesus, the Spirit of God,
walking on the water, and I am walking on the water." The narrator said:
Then he sank in the water and appealed to Jesus, so Jesus reached out to
him from the water and took him out and said to him, "What did you say,
O short one?" He told him what had pervaded his mind and Jesus said to
him, "You have put yourself in a place other than that in which God put
you and God abhorred you on account of what you said; so turn to God in
repentance for what you said." So the man repented and returned to the
rank in which God had placed him. So fear God and do not envy one
another.

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

   *Th.*, pp. 247, 248.--The imâm Abû Man<u>s</u>ûr al Khamshâwî told us
in his tradition from Ma\`âdh, son of Jabal, that the apostle of
God--i.e. Mohammad (God bless him and grant him peace!)--said, "If you
really knew God you would have learned the knowledge after which there
is no ignorance, but no one has ever attained to that." They said, "Not
even you, O apostle of God?" He replied, "Not even I." They said, "O
apostle of God, it has reached us that Jesus, son of Mary, walked on the
water." He said, "Yes, and if he had had more fear and certainty, he
would have walked on the air." They said, "O apostle of God, we were not
thinking that the apostles came short." He replied, "Verily God (Exalted
is He!) has too high a rank for anyone to reach His rank."

   **A.*F.*, pp. 58-62. \[After mentioning the names of the
disciples.\]--These are they who asked him for the descent of the table.
So Jesus asked his Lord (Great and glorious is He!) and He sent down to
him a red tray covered with a napkin in which was a broiled fish
surrounded by vegetables with the exception of the leek, with salt at
its head and vinegar at its tail; and along with it were five loaves on
some of which were olives and on the others pomegranates and dates. A
great number of people ate of them and they did not diminish; and
whenever a diseased person ate of them he was cured. And it was <span
id="page_39">p. 39</span> coming down one day and disappearing the next
for the space of forty nights.

   Ibn Sa\`îd said: And when God informed the Messiah that he was going
from the world he was disturbed at that, and called the disciples and
prepared food for them and said, "Come to me to-night, for I have need
of you." Then when they gathered at night, he gave them supper and rose
to serve them; and when they had finished eating he began to wash their
hands and wipe them with his clothes; but they disdained that, so he
said, "Whoever rejects anything of what I do is not one of mine." Then
they left him alone until he finished. Then he said, "I have only done
this that you should have in me an example of serving one another. And
as regards my need of you, it is that you should strive for me in prayer
to God that my end may be delayed." But when they wished to do that, God
cast sleep on them, so that they were incapable of prayer; and the
Messiah began to waken them and rebuke them, but they only increased in
sleep and laziness and told him that they were too overcome for that.
Then the Messiah said, "Praise be to God! The shepherd is taken away and
the sheep are scattered." Afterwards he said to them, "Verily I say unto
you, one of you will deny me before the cock crows, and one of you will
sell me for a small sum of money and will consume my price." And the
Jews had been <span id="page_40">p. 40</span> energetic in searching for
him; then one of the disciples came to Herod, the governor of the Jews,
and to a company of the Jews and said, "What will you assign me if I
guide you to the Messiah?" They assigned him thirty dirhems, and he took
them and guided them to him. Then God (Exalted is He!) raised the
Messiah to Himself and cast his likeness on him who led them to him.

   Ibn al Athîr said in the Kâmil: The learned have differed concerning
his death before his being raised up. Some say, "He was raised up and
did not die." Others say, "No, God made him die for three hours." Others
say, "For seven hours, then He brought him back to life." And those who
say this are expounding His saying (Exalted is He!), "Verily I will
cause you to die and will raise you to Myself." \[[<u>K</u>orân III,
48.](#III:37.md)\]

   And when the Jews seized the person who had been made to resemble
him, they bound him and began to lead him with a rope and say to him,
"You were raising the dead. Can you not save yourself from this rope?"
And they were spitting in his face and putting thorns on him; and they
crucified him on the cross for six hours. Then Joseph the carpenter
asked for him from the governor who was over the Jews, whose name was
Pilate and whose title was Herod, and buried him in a grave which the
aforementioned <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> Joseph had prepared for
himself. Then God sent down the Messiah from heaven to his mother, Mary,
when she was weeping for him, and he said to her, "Verily God has raised
me to Himself and nothing but good has befallen me." And he gave her
instructions, and she gathered the disciples to him and he sent them
through the earth as messengers from God and he ordered them to convey
from him \[the message which\] God had commanded him. Then God raised
him to Himself and the disciples scattered where he commanded them. The
Messiah's raising up was three hundred and thirty-six years after
Alexander's conquest of Darius.

   Al Shahrastânî said: Then four of the disciples, Matthew, Luke, Mark,
and John, came together, and each of them collected a Gospel, and the
end of the Gospel of Matthew is that the Messiah said, "Verily I have
sent you to the nations as my Father sent me to you; so go and summon
the nations in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost."

grant him peace!) said, "When a day comes in which one of you fasts, let
him anoint his head and his beard and wipe his lips, that men may not
see that he is fasting. And when he gives with his right hand let him
hide it from his left hand, and when he prays let him lower the screen
of his door, for God will apportion praise as He apportions provision."

the Day of Resurrection. Blessed are they who make peace between men in
this world; they are those who will inherit Paradise on the Day of
Resurrection. Blessed are they whose hearts are purified in this world;
they are those who will see God (Exalted is He!) on the Day of
Resurrection."

   <span id="A59=M56"></span>*A.*, 59; *M.*, 56.--The Messiah (Peace be
upon him!) said, "Verily the seed grows on level ground and does not
grow on a rock; similarly wisdom works in the heart of the humble but
does not work in the heart of the proud. Do you not see that if one
raises his head to the roof it breaks it; but if one bends down \[his
head\] it shades him and covers him?"

   <span id="A62"></span>*A.*, 62.--The disciples said to the Messiah
(Peace be upon him!), "Look at this mosque, how beautiful it is!" Then
he said, "My people, my people, verily I say unto you, God will not
leave one stone of this mosque standing on another, but will destroy it
for the sins of its people. Verily God does not pay any heed to gold, or
silver, or these stones which charm you. The things dearest to God
(Exalted is He!) are the pure hearts. With them God preserves the earth,
and with them He destroys it if they are otherwise."

   <span id="A64"></span>*A.*, 64.--The Messiah (Peace be upon Him!)
said, "Verily you will obtain what you like only by your patience with
what you dislike."

   <span id="A65"></span>*A.*, 65.--I saw in the Gospel that Jesus, son
of Mary (Peace be upon him!) said, "It has been said to you formerly,
Tooth for tooth and nose for nose; but I say to you, Do not resist evil
with evil. On the contrary, if someone strikes your right cheek, turn to
him the left cheek; and if one takes your cloak give him your mantle;
<span id="page_48">p. 48</span> and if one compels you to go a mile with
him go with him two miles."

55.\]

   <span id="A83"></span>*A.*, 83.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said, "He
is not wise who cannot rejoice at entering calamities and illnesses in
his body and his wealth on account of what he hopes for from that of
remission of his sins."

   <span id="A85"></span>*A.*, 85.--In the stories of Jesus (Peace be

search after God (Exalted is He!), then that has engrossed him to the
neglect of everything else."

   <span id="A87"></span>*A.*, 87.--It is handed down in the Gospel,
"When you give alms, do it so that your left hand does not know what
your right hand has done; then he who sees the hidden things will reward
you openly. And when you fast, wash your face and anoint your head, that
no one <span id="page_49">p. 49</span> other than your Lord may know of
it." \[Cf. [*A.*, 55](#A55.md), p. 46.\]

   <span id="A89=M68"></span>*A.*, 89; *M.*, 68.--It is related that
Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said to the Children of Israel, "Where does
the seed grow?" They replied, "In the earth." Then he said, "Verily I

Jesus, (Peace be upon him!) "What is the purest of deeds?" Then he

him!) said, "Things are of three kinds--one whose righteousness is

   <span id="A97=M74"></span>*A.*, 97; *M.*, 74.--The disciples said to
Jesus, son of Mary, "O Spirit of God, is there anyone in the earth like
you to-day?" He replied, <span id="page_50">p. 50</span> "Yes; he whose
talk is glorifying God, whose silence is meditation, and whose look is a
tear; he is like me."

   <span id="A100"></span>*A.*, 100.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said,
"Do not worry about to-morrow's food, for if to-morrow is one of your
periods your provisions will come in it along with your periods; and if
it is not one of your periods, do not worry about other people's
periods."

   <span id="A104"></span>*A.*, 104.--They saw him coming out of a
prostitute's house, then someone said to him, "O Spirit of God, what are
you doing with this woman?" He replied, "The doctor comes only to the
sick."

   <span id="A105"></span>*A.*, 105.--Jesus, son of Mary (The blessings
of God--exalted is He!--be upon him!) said, "O company of the disciples,
verily man is created in the world in four ranks, in three of which he
is secure, but in the fourth of which he has evil thoughts, fearing that
God will abandon him. As regards the first rank, he is created in three
darknesses, the darkness of the belly, the darkness of the womb, and the
darkness of the placenta; then God gives him his provision in the depth
of the darkness of the belly. Then when he is taken out of the darkness
of the belly, he comes to the milk. He does not step to it with foot or
leg, or reach out to it with a hand, or leap to it with force; on the
contrary, he is forced to it against his inclination and is guarded
<span id="page_51">p. 51</span> until his flesh and blood grow upon him.
Then when he gets beyond milk, he comes into the third rank with respect
to food from his parents which they acquire for him of what is allowable
and what is forbidden. Then if they die, people are kindly-disposed to
him. One gives him food, another gives him drink, another shelters him,
and another clothes him. Then when he comes into the fourth rank and
grows up and becomes a man, he fears that he will not be given
provision, so he attacks men and betrays their trust and steals their
goods and takes their possessions by force out of fear that God (Exalted
is He!) may abandon him."

   <span id="A107"></span>*A.*, 107.--We are told concerning the Messiah
(God bless him and grant him peace!) that he said, "If God shows
generosity to one of His worshippers, His generosity is necessary for
all His creatures."

   <span id="A109"></span>*A.*, 109.--In a tradition \[it is said\] that
Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon him!) met a man and said to him, "What
are you doing?" He replied, "I am devoting myself to God." He said, "Who
is giving you what you need?" He said, "My brother." \[Jesus\] said, "He
is more devoted to God than you."

   <span id="A112"></span>*A.*, 112.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said to
the disciples, "Do not consider men's works as though you were lords,
but consider your own works as though you were servants; for people
<span id="page_52">p. 52</span> are only of two kinds, tried and
preserved. So have pity on those who are tried, and praise God for
health."

   <span id="A116"></span>*A.*, 116.--And among the things which God
sent down to the Messiah in the Gospel \[we read\], "We have made you
desire, but you have not desired; and we have wailed to you, but you did
not weep. O you of fifty years, what have you sent before and what have
you left behind! O you of sixty years, your harvest has come near. O you
of seventy years, come to the account."

   <span id="A119"></span>*A.*, 119.--The Messiah (God bless him and
grant him peace!) passed by some people of the Children of Israel who
were weeping, and said to them, "What makes you weep?" They replied, "We
are weeping for our sins." He said, "Leave them alone; they are forgiven
you."

   <span id="A122"></span>*A.*, 122.--We have been told about Jesus
(Peace be upon him!) that someone said to him, "Who is the mightiest of
men in seduction?" He replied, "The slip of a learned man; when he slips
a world slips with him." \[This saying contains a pun which cannot be
reproduced in English. The word for "learned man" is *\`âlim*, and for
"world," *\`âlam*.\]

   <span id="A127"></span>*A.*, 127.--The Messiah (Peace be upon him!)
passed some dyers outside the city and stopped beside them and said to
them, "Do you think that when you have washed and purified and whitened
these clothes, their owners will be right <span id="page_53">p.
53</span> in putting them on while their bodies are soiled with blood
and urine and excrement and various kinds of filthiness?" They replied,
"No, the one who did that would be foolish." He said, "You yourselves
have done it." They said, "How?" He said, "Because you have purified
your bodies and whitened your clothes while your souls are soiled with
rottenness, full of filthiness from ignorance and blindness and dumbness
and evil manners and envy and hatred and guile and deceit and
covetousness and niggardliness and wickedness and evil thoughts and the
pursuit of evil desires, and you are in the abasement of slavery,
wretches for whom there is no rest but death and the grave." Then they
said, "How shall we act? Is there any escape from seeking a livelihood?"
He said, "Can you take pleasure in the kingdom of heaven where there is
no death, or decrepitude, or pain, or illness, or hunger, or thirst, or
fear, or grief, or poverty, or need, or weariness, or affliction, or
care, or envy among its people, or hatred, or boasting, or pride? But on
the contrary, brethren sit opposite one another on couches, glad and
rejoicing in pleasure and bounty and favour and satisfaction and
splendour and agreeableness, walking in the vastness of the spheres in
the wideness of the heavens, and seeing the kingdom of the Lord of the
worlds and beholding the angels round His throne, pure, <span
id="page_54">p. 54</span> celebrating the praise of their Lord with
melodies and tunes the like of which men and jinn have never heard. And
you will be with them for ever, not ageing, or dying, or hungering, or
thirsting, or becoming ill, or fearing, or grieving."

   <span id="A130"></span>*A.*, 130.--Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon
him!), in what Ibn al <u>H</u>amal the Christian scribe told us, said to
his disciples, "The sign by which you are known as being from me is that
you love one another." And Jesus said also to Joshua, his disciple, "As
regards the Lord, you must love him with all your heart, then love your
neighbour as you love yourself." They said to him, "Explain to us, O
Spirit of God, what is the difference between these two loves, so that
we may prepare for them with discernment and clearness." He said, "You
love your friend for yourself, and you love yourself for your Lord; so
when you guard your friend you do it for yourself, and when you are
bountiful yourself you are so towards your Lord."

   <span id="A132"></span>*A.*, 132.--Jesus, son of Mary (God's
blessings be upon him!), said to the disciples, "O salt of the earth, do
not become bad, for when things become bad they can be treated only with
salt, but when salt becomes bad it cannot be treated with anything. O
company of the disciples, do not take remuneration from those whom you
teach, except like what you have given me. And know that there are two
characteristics of <span id="page_55">p. 55</span> ignorance in
you--laughter without anything extraordinary, and sleeping in the
morning without a \[previous\] vigil."

   <span id="A134"></span>*A.*, 134.--Jesus said to the Children of
Israel, "Do not reward an evil-doer with evil, for your favour will go
for nothing with your Lord."

   <span id="A135"></span>*A.*, 135.--This word is handed down from
Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon him!), "Four things are found only in
a believer: silence which is the beginning of devotion, humility,

[*A.*, 76; *M.*, 64](#A76=M64.md), p. 48.\]

   <span id="A136"></span>*A.*, 136.--It is related concerning Jesus,
son of Mary (Peace be upon him!), that he said, "Every word which is not
accompanied by mention of God is vanity; and every silence which is not
accompanied by meditation is negligence; and every speculation which is
not accompanied by a tear is folly. So blessed is he whose speech is
mention of God, whose silence is meditation, and whose speculation is a
tear."

   <span id="A140"></span>*A.*, 140.--It is written in the Gospel, "He
who sows evil reaps remorse."

   <span id="A141"></span>*A.*, 141.--It is related concerning
<u>K</u>atâda that he said: It was mentioned to us that \[the
following\] is written in the Gospel, "O son of man, as you show pity so
will you be pitied; for how can you hope that God will pity you if you
do not show pity to His servants?"

   <span id="A142"></span>*A.*, 142.--Mâlik, son of Anas (God--Exalted
<span id="page_56">p. 56</span> is He!--be pleased with him!), said: It
has reached me that Jesus (God's blessings and peace be upon him!) said,
"Do not speak much without mention of God, or your hearts will become
hard, and the hard heart is far from God (Exalted is He!); but you do
not know."

   <span id="A144"></span>*A.*, 144.--\[The following\] is quoted from
Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon them!), "What is the use of a blind
man carrying a lamp while others get light from it? And what is the use

speaking with wisdom and not acting with it?"

   <span id="A150"></span>*A.*, 150.--It is related concerning Jesus,
son of Mary (Blessing and peace be upon him!), that he said, "There is
nothing wonderful about one perishing in the way he perishes, but there
is something wonderful about one being saved in the way he is saved."

   <span id="A153"></span>*A.*, 153.--Jesus said, "If Thou punishest
them they are Thy servants, and if Thou forgivest them Thou art the
mighty and the wise One." \[[<u>K</u>orân V, 118](#V:109.md).\]

   <span id="A154"></span>*A.*, 154.--In the Gospel \[there is
written\], "I am the prince of life and the ways of truth; whoever
believes in me and dies, has not died a death but has only lived a
life." \[Cf. John xiv. 6, xi. 25, 26.\]

   <span id="A155"></span>*A.*, 155.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said to
the disciples, "Verily I say unto you, the speaker <span id="page_57">p.
57</span> of wisdom and the hearer of it are partners, and the one of
them who is more worthy of it is he who verifies it by his deeds."

   <span id="A156"></span>*A.*, 156.--It is related that Jesus (Peace be
upon him!) said to the disciples, "I do not teach you that you should
wonder; I only teach you that you should act. Wisdom is not talking
wisely; wisdom is only acting wisely."

   <span id="A157"></span>*A.*, 157.--Jesus said, "If you are able to be
simple like a dove concerning God, then do so; nothing is more simple
than a dove. You may take its two young from under it and kill them, and
it will return to that very place and bring forth \[others\] in it."

   <span id="A158"></span>*A.*, 158.--Jesus said, "Speak much to God and
speak little to men." They said, "How shall we speak much to God?" He

   <span id="A163"></span>*A.*, 163.--Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon
him!), said, "The steps slip only with regard to three things: smallness
of thanks for God's gifts (Exalted is He!), fear of something other than
God, and hope in created things."

a remedy to the fool." \[Cf. *M.*, 5.\]

   <span id="A167=M32"></span>*A.*, 167; *M.*, 32.--Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) said, "Verily one of the greatest sins in God's <span
id="page_58">p. 58</span> eyes is that a servant \[of His\] should say
'God knows,' when he is ignorant."

   <span id="A173"></span>*A.*, 173.--Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon
him!), said, "The world consists of three days:--yesterday which has
passed, from which you have nothing in your hand; to-morrow of which you
do not know whether you will reach it or not; and to-day in which you
are, so avail yourself of it."

   <span id="A175"></span>*A.*, 175.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said,
"The recollection of the eternity of those who live for ever rends the
hearts of those who fear God." \[Asin interprets "those who live for
ever " as "the damned," which gives good sense; but the literal
translation is as above, with no reference to a particular class.\]

of your good deeds and you are at rest."

   <span id="A180"></span>*A.*, 180.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said,
"God sent this revelation to the world, Whoever serves Me, serve him,
and whoever serves you, take him as your servant."

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

   <span id="A184"></span>*A.*, 184.--Al Bokhârî related on the
authority of Abû Huraira that the prophet--i.e. Mohammad--(God bless him
and grant him peace!) said: Jesus, son of Mary, saw a man stealing and

"You believe in God, and you have accused my eye of falsehood!"

   <span id="A185"></span>*A.*, 185.--The Messiah (Peace be upon him!)
said, "What is the forbearance of him who has not been patient with
foolishness, and what is the strength of him who has not repelled anger,

time and the sitting beyond what is decreed; but when necessity arises
counsel disappears."

   <span id="A188"></span>*A.*, 188.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said,

him!) gave the following injunction to one of his companions, "Fast from
the world, and do not cease from your fast till you die, and be like him
who treats his sore with medicine out of fear that it may become worse

brings good to the believer with no evil after it, but evil to the
wicked with no good after it."

on one side. \[This is variously interpreted. Some say it means, Be in

friendship while concealing enmity.\]

man approached him, and Jesus <span id="page_64">p. 64</span> said to
him, "God bless you, O friend of God! Pray for me to God (Exalted is
He!), for I was in an ecstasy and the thought of bread occurred to me,
and the ecstasy ceased." Then the old man said, "O God, if Thou knowest
that the thought of bread has occurred to me since I have known Thee,
then do not pardon me. On the contrary, whenever anything came to me, I
ate it without thought or consideration."

   <span id="A26=M29"></span>*A.*, 26; *M.*, 29.--Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) said, "Devotion has ten parts, nine of which are found in silence
and one in flight from men."

   <span id="A30"></span>*A.*, 30.--John \[the Baptist\] said to Jesus
(Peace be upon them!), "Do not be angry." He replied, "I am unable to
keep from anger; I am only a man." He said, "Do not acquire wealth." He
replied, "This is possible."

   <span id="A34=M35"></span>*A.*, 34; *M.*, 35.--Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) said, "Do not take the world as a master, for it will take you as
slaves. Lay up your treasure with him who will not lose it, for he who
possesses treasure in this world fears lest some calamity may come upon
it, but he who possesses God's treasure has no fear of calamity coming
upon it."

   <span id="A34=M36"></span>*A.*, 34; *M.*, 36.--And he said (The
richest blessing and peace be upon him!), "O company of the disciples, I
have overturned the world for you on its face, so do not raise it up
after me. For part of the wickedness of the world is that disobedience
to God is in it; and part of the <span id="page_65">p. 65</span>
wickedness of the world is that the next world is attained only by
abandoning it. Is it not so? Therefore pass through the world, but do
not stay in it; and know that the root of all sin is the love of the
world. And the desire of an hour often leaves those who indulge in it an
inheritance of grief which lasts for long."

   <span id="A34=M37"></span>*A.*, 34; *M.*, 37.--And he said also, "I
have thrown down the world for you and you have sat on its back, so let
not kings or women quarrel with you about it. As regards kings, do not
quarrel with them about the world, for they will not oppose you so long
as you leave them and their world alone; and as regards women, protect
yourselves against them by fasting and prayer."

   <span id="A34=M38"></span>*A.*, 34; *M.*, 38.--And he said also, "The
world is both seeking and sought. He who seeks the next world, this
world seeks him until his provision in it is complete; and he who seeks
the present world, the next world seeks him until death comes and seizes
him by the neck."

   <span id="A35=M39"></span>*A.*, 35; *M.*, 39.--Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) said, "The love of this world and of the next cannot stay in the
heart of a believer, just as water and fire cannot stay in one vessel."

   <span id="A36=M40"></span>*A.*, 36; *M.*, 40.--Someone said to Jesus
(Peace be upon him!), "If you were to take a house to cover you \[it
would be good\]." He replied, "The rags of those who lived before us are
sufficient for us."

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

   <span id="A37=M41"></span>*A.*, 37; *M.*, 41.--It is related that one
day the rain and thunder and lightning were fierce about Jesus (Peace be
upon him!), so he began to seek something under which he might shelter.
His eye fell on a tent far off, so he came to it; but behold there was a
woman in it, so he turned away from it. Then he saw a cave in a hill and
came to it, but behold there was a lion in it. Then he put his hand on
it and said, "My God, Thou hast given everything an abode, and Thou hast
not given me an abode." Then God (Exalted is He!) revealed to him, "Your
abode is in the dwelling of My mercy. Verily I will give to you in
marriage on the Day of Resurrection a hundred houris whom I have created
with My hand, and I will give a feast at your wedding for four thousand
years, each day of which is like the duration of the present world, and
I will command one to proclaim, 'Where are those who were ascetics in
the world? Visit the marriage of the ascetic in the world, Jesus, son of
Mary.'"

   <span id="A38=M42"></span>*A.*, 38; *M.*, 42.--Jesus, son of Mary
(Peace be upon him!) said, "Woe to him who loves the world! How can he
die and leave it and what is in it! It deceives him, yet he trusts in it
and puts his confidence in it and he is taken away. And woe to those who
are deceived! How what they abhor has caused dissension among them, and
what they like has left them, and what they <span id="page_67">p.
67</span> were threatened with has come to them! And woe to him whose
care is the world, and whose work is sins! How he shall be covered with
shame to-morrow for his offence!"

   <span id="A40=M43"></span>*A.*, 40; *M.*, 43.--Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) said, "Who is he who builds a house on the wave of the sea? The
world is \[like\] that, so do not take it as an abiding place."

   <span id="A41=M44"></span>*A.*, 41; *M.*, 44.--Some people said to
Jesus (Peace be upon him!), "Teach us one piece of knowledge for which
God will love us." He replied, "Hate the world, and God (Exalted is He!)
will love you."

   <span id="A42=M45"></span>*A.*, 42; *M.*, 45.--Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) said, "O company of the disciples, be pleased with what is
worthless in the world along with welfare in religion, just as the
people of the world are pleased with what is worthless in religion along
with welfare in the world."

   <span id="A43=M46"></span>*A.*, 43; *M.*, 46.--The Messiah (Peace be
upon him!) said, "O you who seek the world to be charitable with it,
your leaving of it alone is more charitable." And he said, "The least
thing is such that looking after it occupies one to the exclusion of
glorifying God, and glorifying God is greater and more important."

   <span id="A44=M47"></span>*A.*, 44; *M.*, 47.--If you wish you may
follow him who was the Spirit and the Word, Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be
upon him!), for he used to say, "My seasoning is hunger, my
under-garment <span id="page_68">p. 68</span> is fear \[of God\], my
outer-garment is wool, my fire in winter is the rays of the sun, my lamp
is the moon, my riding-beast is my feet, and my food and fruit are what
the earth brings forth \[i.e. without cultivation\]. At night I have
nothing and in the morning I have nothing, yet there is no one on earth
richer than I."

   <span id="A45=M48"></span>*A.*, 45; *M.*, 48.--It is related that the
world was revealed to Jesus (Peace be upon him!) and he saw it in the
form of a toothless old woman upon whom was every kind of ornament. Then
he said to her, "How many have you married?" She replied, "I cannot
count them." He said, "Did they all die and leave you, or did they all
divorce you?" She said, "Nay, I killed them all." Then Jesus (Peace be
upon him!) said, "It is a pity for the rest of your husbands. How do
they not take warning from your past husbands how you have been
destroying them one after another, and \[how\] are they not on their
guard against you! "

   <span id="A46"></span>*A.*, 46.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said,
"The world is a bridge, so pass over it and do not inhabit it." \[Cf.
[*A.*, 75](#A75.md), p. 71.\]

   <span id="A47=M49"></span>*A.*, 47; *M.*, 49.--Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) said, "Verily I say unto you, as a sick man looks at food and
takes no delight in it because of the severity of the pain, so he who
loves the world takes no delight in worship and does not discover its
sweetness along with what he finds <span id="page_69">p. 69</span> of
love of the world. And verily I say unto you, if a riding-beast is not
ridden and taken into service, it becomes intractable and its nature
changes; similarly when hearts are not softened by the thought of death
and the discipline of worship, they become hard and coarse. And verily I
say unto you, as long as a skin is not torn or shrivelled it may nearly
serve as a receptacle for honey; similarly hearts, as long as desires do
not tear them, or greed defile them, or comfort harden them, may be
vessels for wisdom."

   <span id="A48=M50"></span>*A.*, 48; *M.*, 50.--Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) said, "He who seeks after the world is like one who drinks
sea-water; the more he drinks the more his thirst increases, until it
kills him."

   <span id="A49=M51"></span>*A.*, 49; *M.*, 51.--The disciples said to
Jesus (Peace be upon him!), "How is it that you can walk on water and we
cannot?" Then he said to them, "What do you think of the dînâr and the
dirhem?" \[*pieces of money*\]. They replied, "They are good." He said,
"But they and mud are alike to me." \[Cf. [*A.*, 126](#A126.md), p. 74.\]

   <span id="A50=M52"></span>*A.*, 50; *M.*, 52.--Jesus (Blessing and
peace be upon him!) said, "In wealth there are calamities: that one
should get it unlawfully." Someone interrupted, "Suppose one gets it
lawfully?" Then he said, "He may apply it unlawfully." The other said,
"But suppose he applies it lawfully?" Then he said, "Its <span
id="page_70">p. 70</span> management occupies him to the neglect of God
(Exalted is He!)."

   <span id="A60=M57"></span>*A.*, 60; *M.*, 57.--Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) said, "Fine clothing is vanity of heart."

   <span id="A63"></span>*A.*, 63 (Cf. *M.*, 22).--Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) attained to the use of a stone for his pillow while sleeping; but
the devil came to him and said, "Have you not renounced this world for
the next?" He said, "Yes, but what has happened?" Then he said, "Your
use of this stone as a pillow means that you are being comfortable in
the world; so why do you not put your head on the ground?" Then Jesus
(Peace be upon him!) threw away the stone and put his head on the
ground.

   <span id="A70=M61"></span>*A.*, 70; *M.*, 61.--The Messiah (Peace be
upon him!) said, "O companies of the disciples, fear of God and love of
Paradise produce patience in affliction and estrange men from the world.
Verily I say unto you, eating barley and sleeping on dunghills with dogs
is a small matter when one seeks Paradise."

   <span id="A71=M62"></span>*A.*, 71; *M.*, 62.--It is related that the
Messiah (God bless him and grant him peace!) passed in his wandering a
man asleep wrapped up in his cloak; then he wakened him and said, "O
sleeper, arise and glorify God (Exalted is He!)." Then the man said,
"What do you want from me? Verily I have abandoned the world to its
people." So he said to him, "Sleep, then, my friend."

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

   <span id="A72"></span>*A.*, 72.--The Messiah (God bless him and grant
him peace!) said, "With difficulty does a rich man enter heaven."

   <span id="A73=M18"></span>*A.*, 73; *M.*, 18.--The Messiah (God's
blessings and peace be upon him!) said, "Verily I love poverty and hate
comfort." And the dearest of names to him (God's blessings be upon him!)
was that he should be called, "O poor one."

   <span id="A74=M63"></span>*A.*, 74; *M.*, 63.--The Messiah (Peace be
upon him!) said, "Do not look at the wealth of the people of this world,
for the splendour of their wealth takes away the light of your faith."

   <span id="A75"></span>*A.*, 75.--The Messiah (God bless him and grant
him peace!) said, "The world is a bridge, so pass over it and do not
inhabit it." And some people said to him, "O prophet of God, if you
would only order us to build a house in which we might worship God!" He
replied, "Go and build a house on water." They said, "How will a
building stand on water?" He replied, "And how will worship stand along
with love of this world?" \[Cf. [*A.*, 46](#A46.md), p. 68.\]

   <span id="A77"></span>*A.*, 77.--\`Obaid, son of \`Omair, said, The
Messiah, son of Mary (Peace be upon him!) used to wear hair clothing,
and eat wild fruits \[*lit*. trees\], and he had no son to die, and no
house to be demolished, and he stored up nothing for the morrow. He
slept wherever the evening overtook him. \[Cf. [*A.*, 118](#A118.md), p.
73.\]

   <span id="A79"></span>*A.*, 79.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) sat down
<span id="page_72">p. 72</span> in the shade of someone's wall, and the
owner of the wall made him get up. Then he said, "You have not made me
get up; He who has made me get up is only He \[i.e. God\] who was not
pleased that I should be comfortable in the shade of the wall."

   <span id="A80"></span>*A.*, 80.--The Messiah (God bless him and grant
him peace!) used to say, "O Children of Israel, use pure water and wild
vegetables and barley bread, and avoid wheaten bread, for you will not
remain thankful to God."

   <span id="A81=M65"></span>*A.*, 81; *M.*, 65.--Jesus, the Messiah
(God's blessings and peace be upon him!), used to take nothing with him
but a comb and a jug. Then he saw a man combing his beard with his
fingers, so he threw away the comb; and he saw another drinking from a
river with the palms of his hands, so he threw away the jug.

   <span id="A82"></span>*A.*, 82.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said,
"Look at the birds; they do not sow, or harvest, or store up, yet God
(Exalted is He!) feeds them day by day. But if you say, We have larger
bellies, look at the cattle, how God (Exalted is He!) has appointed for
them this creation as provision."

   <span id="A146"></span>*A.*, 146.--Mohammad, son of al Fa<u>d</u>l,
told us on the authority of Sâlim, son of Abû al Ja\`d (God be pleased
with him!) that Jesus, son of Mary (God's blessings and peace be upon
him!), said, "Do not store food for the morrow, for the <span
id="page_73">p. 73</span> morrow comes bringing along with it its
provision. And look at the ants and who gives them provision. But if you
say, The ants' bellies are small, look at the bird. And if you say, The
bird has wings, look at the wild beasts, how corpulent and fat they
are."

   <span id="A86=M66"></span>*A.*, 86; *M.*, 66.--Someone said to Jesus
(Peace be upon him!), "Why do you not buy an ass to ride?" Then he
replied, "I am too dear to God (Exalted is He!) for Him to allow me to
be occupied with an ass to the neglect of Himself."

   <span id="A103"></span>*A.*, 103.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said,
"How many healthy bodies and beautiful faces and eloquent tongues will
lie to-morrow among the strata of hell!"

the disciples, "Take the mosques as houses and the houses as
alighting-places; and eat wild vegetables and drink pure water, and
escape safe from the world."

   <span id="A113"></span>*A.*, 113.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said to
the disciples, "It is astonishing how you work for this world, yet you
receive provision in it without work; and how you do not work for the
next world, yet you receive provision in it only with work."

   <span id="A117"></span>*A.*, 117.--The Messiah (Peace be upon him!)
said, "The world is a field belonging to Iblîs \[Satan\], and its people
are his ploughmen."

   <span id="A118"></span>*A.*, 118 .--The Messiah (Blessing and peace
be upon him!) said to the disciples, "I am he who <span id="page_74">p.

and no house to be demolished." \[Cf. [*A.*, 77](#A77.md), p. 71.\]

   <span id="A123"></span>*A.*, 123.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) used to
say to the world, "Away from me, O swine!"

   <span id="A125"></span>*A.*, 125.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) used to
say, "The sweetness of this world is the bitterness of the next, and
fine clothes are vanity of heart, meaning conceit and pride of heart;
and fullness of the belly is abundance of passion, meaning its
sustenance and its accumulation." \[Cf. [*A.*, 60; *M.*, 57](#A60=M57.md),
p. 70.\]

   <span id="A126"></span>*A.*, 126.--The disciples said, "O Spirit of
God, we pray as you pray, and we fast as you fast, and we glorify God
(Exalted is He!) as you have ordered us, yet we are unable to walk on
the water as you do." Then he said, "Tell me how your love of the world
is." They replied, "Verily we love it." So he said, "Verily the love of
it spoils religion, but in my opinion it is merely like stone and mud."
And in another story \[it is said\] that he lifted up a stone and asked,
"Which of the two is dearer to you, this or a dînâr and a dirhem?" They
replied, "A dînâr." He said, "They are both alike to me." \[Cf. [*A.*,
49; *M.*, 51](#A49=M51.md), p. 69.\]

   <span id="A139"></span>*A.*, 139.--If you desire the fast of the son
of the virgin maid, meaning Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon them!),
then he used to fast all the time and eat barley bread and wear <span
id="page_75">p. 75</span> coarse hair; and wherever the night overtook
him he used to arrange his feet in prayer until he saw that the sign of
the dawn had arisen; and he never stayed anywhere without praying two
rek\`as in it. And if you desire the fast of his mother, then she used
to fast for two days and break her fast for two days.

   <span id="A145"></span>*A.*, 145.--It is mentioned concerning Jesus,
son of Mary (Blessing and peace be upon him!), that he went out one day
to his companions wearing a woollen tunic, a woollen outer-garment, and
clothes of wool, with his head and his moustaches shorn, weeping and
looking pale from hunger, with his lips dry from thirst, with the hair
on his chest and arms long; then he said, "Peace be upon you! Verily I
am he who has lowered the world in its rank by the permission of God,
and there is no wonder or boasting. O Children of Israel, despise the
world and it will be easy for you, and scorn the world and the next
world will be made honourable for you, and do not despise the next world
and this world will be made honourable for you. For the world is not
worthy of honour; every day it calls to temptation and loss." Then he
said, "If you are my companions and friends, accustom yourselves to
enmity and hatred towards the world, for if you do not do so, you are
not my friends or my brethren. O Children of Israel, take the mosques as
houses, and the graves as homes; <span id="page_76">p. 76</span> be like
guests. Do you not see the birds of the heaven? they do not sow or reap,
and God in heaven gives them provision. O Children of Israel, eat barley
bread and wild vegetables; and know that you have not given thanks for
that, so how about what is more than that?"

   <span id="A162"></span>*A.*, 162.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said,
"This world in relation to the next is like a man who has two wives; if
he is pleased with one of them, he is displeased with the other."

   <span id="A168"></span>*A.*, 168.--It is related that Jesus (Peace be
upon him!) passed by a man asleep on the ground with a brick under his
head and his face and his beard in the dust, and he had a woollen cloak
tied round him. Then he said, "O Lord, this servant of Thine is astray
in the world." Then God (Exalted is He!) revealed to him, "O Jesus, do
you not know that when I look at My servant with my whole face, I remove
from him the whole world?"

   <span id="A169"></span>*A.*, 169.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said,
"Verily I have two friends; he who loves them loves me, and he who hates
them hates me:--poverty and distress."

   <span id="A174_bis"></span>*A.*, 174 *bis*.--In the Israelite history
it is said that Iblîs \[Satan\] appeared to Jesus (Peace be upon him!),
and he saw things hanging on him coloured with all kinds of dyes. Then
he said to him, "What are these hanging things?" He replied, "These are
the desires of the children <span id="page_77">p. 77</span> of men."
Then he asked, "Is there anything of mine among them?" He replied, "You
have often eaten your fill and we have made you too heavy for prayer and
for glorifying God." He asked, "Is there anything else?" He replied,
"No." He said, "I swear to God that I will never fill my belly with
food." Iblîs said, "And I swear to God that I will never advise a
Muslim."

   <span id="A193"></span>*A.*, 193.--Jesus (Blessing and peace be upon
him!) said, "O Children of Israel, know that the relation of your
present life to your future life is like the relation of the east to the
west. The more you approach the east, the farther you are from the west;
and the more you approach the west, the farther do you increase in
distance from the east."

   <span id="A220"></span>*A.*, 220.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) struck
the ground with his hand and took up some of it and spread it out, and
behold, he had gold in one of his hands and clay in the other. Then he
said to his companions, "Which of them is sweeter to your hearts?" They
said, "The gold." He said, "They are both alike to me." \[Cf. [*A.*, 49;
*M.*, 51](#A49=M51), p. 69; and [*A.*, 126](#A126.md), p. 74.\]

   <span id="A221"></span>*A.*, 221.--Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon
him!), said, "By God, the world has not settled in the heart of a
worshipper without three of its things sticking to it: labour whose
distress does not cease, poverty which does not catch up on its wealth,
and hope which does not attain its goal."

SAYINGS OF GOD TO JESUS

   <span id="A7=M12"></span>*A.*, 7; *M.*, 12.--God (Exalted is He!)
said to Jesus (Peace be upon him!), "O son of Mary, exhort yourself,
then if you take warning, exhort men; otherwise be ashamed before Me."

   <span id="A14=M15"></span>*A.*, 14; *M.*, 15.--It is related that God
(Exalted is He!) sent this revelation to Jesus (Peace be upon him!),
"Though you should worship Me like the people of the heavens and the
earth and had not love in God and hate in God, it would avail you
nothing."

   <span id="A58"></span>*A.*, 58.--It is said that God (Exalted is He!)
revealed to Jesus (Peace be upon him!), "When I bestow a favour on you,

(Peace be upon him!), "When I consider the secret thoughts of a
worshipper and do not find in him love of this world or of the next, I
fill him with love of Me and take him under My care."

   <span id="A124"></span>*A.*, 124.--We are told concerning Jesus
(Peace be upon him!) among the things that God <span id="page_79">p.
79</span> (Exalted is He!) revealed to him \[the following\], "O son of
man, weep during the days of your life like him who takes leave of the
world and whose desire is raised to the things which are with God
(Exalted is He!). Be satisfied with mere subsistence from the world. Let
what is coarse and rough satisfy you from it. Verily I say unto you, you
remain only your day and your hour. What you have received from the
world and that on which you have spent it are written concerning you. So
work in accordance with this, for you are responsible for it. If you
were to see what I have promised the upright, your soul would pass
away."

   <span id="A133"></span>*A.*, 133.--And it is said that there is
written in the Gospel, "O son of man, remember Me when you are angry and
I shall remember you when I am angry; and be pleased with My help to
you, for My help to you is better than your help to yourself."

   <span id="A223"></span>*A.*, 223.--God (Praise be to Him!) said to
Jesus, "Verily the world is not good except with wheat and barley; so
their going bad is not good, for they are the dearest parts of My
creation to Me. O Jesus, know that the seed has an honour which no
creature's honour resembles, and I am angry with him who spoils it just
as I am angry with him who says that I am the third of three \[with
reference to the doctrine of the Trinity\], or as I am angry with him
who says <span id="page_80">p. 80</span> that I am poor, or as I am
angry with him who declares that I have begotten a son, until he
renounces what he has done and repents of the evil he has committed.
Then I forgive him, for I am the Forgiver of offences."

MISCELLANEOUS PASSAGES

   <span id="A11=M14"></span>*A.*, 11; *M.*, 14.--The prayer of Jesus
(God bless him and grant him peace!). He used to say, "O God, I am
unable to drive away what I dislike, and to get the benefit of what I
hope for. The affair is in the hands of another, and I am put under
obligation by my work, and there is no poor one who is poorer than I. O
God, do not let my enemy exult over me, or my friend be offended with
me; and do not make my misfortune to be with respect to my religion; and
do not make the world my greatest care; and do not let him who will not
pity me have power over me, O Living One, O Everlasting One."

   <span id="A17=M20"></span>*A.*, 17; *M.*, 20.--It is related that
Satan (God curse him!) appeared to Jesus, son of Mary (God bless him and
grant him peace!) and said to him, "Say, There is no God but God." Then
he replied, "It is a word of truth, but I will not say it at your
request, for beneath what is good it has also ambiguities."

   <span id="A18=M21"></span>*A.*, 18; *M.*, 21.--It is related that
when Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon him!) was born, the devils came
to Iblîs \[Satan\] and said, "This <span id="page_82">p. 82</span>
morning the idols have been thrown down on their heads." Then he said,
"This is a new thing which has happened. Remain where you are." Then he
flew till he came to the East and the West of the earth, but found
nothing. Afterwards he found Jesus (Peace be upon him!) already born
with the angels doing him honour. Then he returned to them and said,
"Verily a prophet has been born last night; no woman ever became
pregnant or gave birth to a child without my being present, with the
exception of this \[child\]. So despair of the idols being worshipped
after this night; but attack the sons of men from the side of haste and
levity."

   <span id="A53=M54"></span>*A.*, 53; *M.*, 54.--It has reached us that
Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon him!) said, "O you learned men who are
evil, you fast and pray and give alms, and do not do what you are
commanded, and you teach what you do not perform. How evil is what you
decide! You repent in speech and hopes, but act according to desire.
What does it avail you to purify your skins while your hearts are
filthy? Verily I say unto you, do not be like a sieve from which the
good flour goes out and in which the siftings remain. Similarly you
utter the decree from your mouths, while malice remains in your hearts.
O slaves of the world, how can he attain the next world whose desire is
not fulfilled in this world and whose craving is not cut off from <span
id="page_83">p. 83</span> it? Verily I say unto you, your hearts will
weep for your deeds. You have put the world under your tongues and
\[good\] deeds under your feet. Verily I say unto you, you have spoiled
your next life, for the welfare of the present world is dearer to you
than the welfare of the next. So what men are greater losers than you,
if you only knew it! Woe to you! How long will you describe the way to
those who journey by night and remain as people who are confused, as
though you were calling the people of the world to leave it to you?
Gently, gently! Woe to you! What does it avail a dark house if a lamp is
placed on its roof when inside is black darkness? Similarly it will not
avail you that the light of knowledge should be in your mouths when your
inner parts are waste and uncultivated respecting it. O slaves of the
world, you are not pious like slaves, or honourable like freemen. The
world will soon uproot you and throw you on your faces, then it will
overturn you on your nostrils; then your sons will seize your forelocks
and thrust you from behind you, until they hand you over to the Royal
Judge, naked and ruined. Then He will make you think of your baseness
and will requite you for the evil of your deeds."

   <span id="A61=M58"></span>*A.*, 61; *M.*, 58.--Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) said, "Why do you come to me wearing monks' clothing while your
hearts are the hearts of <span id="page_84">p. 84</span> ravenous
wolves? Put on king's clothing and mortify your hearts with fear."

   <span id="A98=M75"></span>*A.*, 98; *M.*, 75.--When Jesus (Peace be
upon him!) thought of death his skin used to drop blood.

   <span id="A101=M76"></span>*A.*, 101; *M.*, 76.--Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) said, "O company of the disciples, pray to God (Exalted is He!)
that He may make easy for me this intoxication (meaning death), for I
fear death in such a way that my fear of it has bequeathed it to me."
\[Probably meaning that the fear of death is as severe as the pains of
death themselves.\]

   <span id="A108"></span>*A.*, 108.--Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon
him!) said, "In the last days there will be learned men who teach
abstinence in the world but will not be abstinent themselves, who will
teach men to take delight in the next world but will not take delight in
it themselves, and who will warn men against coming before rulers but
will not refrain themselves. They will draw near the rich and keep far
away from the poor; they will be pleasant to great men but will shrink
from humble men. Those are the brethren of the devils and the enemies of
the Merciful."

   <span id="A110"></span>*A.*, 110.--Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon
them!) said to the disciples, "Woe to you, slaves of the world! How do
your branches differ from your roots and your desires from <span
id="page_85">p. 85</span> your minds! Your speech is a remedy which
could cure disease, but your action is a disease which is not amenable
to treatment. Are you not like the vine whose leaves are beautiful,
whose fruit is good, and whose growth is easy? But you are like the
acacia whose leaves are few, whose thorns are many, and whose growth is
difficult. Woe to you, slaves of the world! You have put action under
your feet; whoever wishes may take it. And you have put the world over
your heads; it cannot be taken. You are neither sincere slaves nor
honourable freemen. Woe to you, whelps of evil! You take the reward but
spoil the work. You will meet what you are on your guard against when
the Lord of the work considers His work which you have spoiled and His
reward which you have taken."

   <span id="A115"></span>*A.*, 115.--The Messiah (God bless him and
grant him peace!) said, "The friends of God, upon whom there is no fear
and who do not grieve \[this phrase occurs frequently in the
<u>K</u>orân. Cf. II, 36 etc.\], are they who look into the inner things
of the world when men look at its outward things, and at its hereafter
when men look at its present. They have mortified what they feared would
kill them, and have abandoned what they knew would abandon them. They
are the enemies of what makes peace with men and make peace with what is
hostile to men. For them is a wonderful good and with them is the <span
id="page_86">p. 86</span> wonderful good. Of them the Scripture spoke
and of it they speak. With them is the knowledge of right guidance and
they are acquainted with it. They see no security apart from what they
hope for, and no fear apart from what they are on their guard against."

   <span id="A115a"></span>*A.*, 115*a*.--It has been related in the
ancient books that the disciples said to Jesus (Peace be upon him!), "O
Spirit of God, describe to us the friends of God (Exalted is He!) upon
whom there is no fear, and who do not grieve." Then he (Peace be upon
him!) said, "They," etc. . . . "their remembrance in it is death and
their joy in it is grief \[i.e. in the world\]. Whatever of it
encounters them they reject, and whatever of it is elevated to them they
put down. The world is bad in their sight and they do not renew it; and
it has gone to ruin among them and they do not build it; and it has died
in their breasts and they do not bring it back to life after its death;
and they have built their next life in it. They have brought to life the
remembrance of death and they have mortified the remembrance of life.
They love God and keep alive His remembrance, and they seek for
themselves in Him the good and wonderful light," etc.

   <span id="A128"></span>*A.*, 128.--It was a custom of the Messiah's
to go every day from village to village of the villages of Palestine and
from town to town of the habitations of the Children of Israel, curing
<span id="page_87">p. 87</span> people and preaching to them and
admonishing them and summoning them to the kingdom of heaven and making
them take pleasure in it and making them practise asceticism in the
world and making clear to them its deceitfulness and its hopes. And he
was sought by the king of the Children of Israel and by the rabble; and
while he was among a company of people, so that a rush was made at him
that he might be taken, he turned aside among the people and it was
impossible to catch him, and nothing was known of him until news of him
came from another village, so he was sought there; and that was his
custom and their custom for thirty months \[i.e. he kept eluding them
for that period\]. Then when God (Exalted is He!) wished to take him and
raise him to Himself, his disciples gathered with him in Jerusalem in a
room belonging to one \[*fem*.\] of his companions, and he said, "Verily
I am going to my Father and your Father, and I am giving you an
injunction before the departure of my divine nature and am making with
you a covenant and a pledge. So he who receives my injunction and
fulfils my covenant will be with me to-morrow; but he who does not
receive my injunction, I have nothing to do with him, and he has nothing
to do with me." Then they said to him, "What is it?" He replied, "Go to
the kings of the ends of the earth and convey to them what I <span
id="page_88">p. 88</span> have charged you with, and summon them to that
to which I have summoned you, and do not deceive them, and do not fear
them, for when I leave my humanity I shall be standing in heaven at the
right hand of the throne of my Father and your Father, and shall be with
you wherever you go and shall strengthen you with help and strength by
the permission of my Father. Go to them and summon them with gentleness
and cure them and command them to be kind and forbid them what is
unlawful, until you are killed, or crucified, or rejected from the
earth." Then they asked, "What is the verification of what you command
us?" He replied, "I am the first who does that." And he went out the
next day and appeared to the people and began to summon them and
admonish them and warn them until he was taken and carried to the king
of the Children of Israel. Then he ordered him to be crucified, and his
humanity was crucified and his hands were nailed to the two pieces of
wood of the cross, and he remained on the cross from dawn to afternoon.
And he asked for water, and was given vinegar to drink, and he was
pierced with a lance. Then he was buried where the cross was and forty
people were put in charge of the grave; and all this happened in the
presence of his companions and his disciples. Then when they saw that
happen to him, they were sure and <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> knew
that he had commanded them nothing in which he was different from them.
Three days afterwards they gathered in the place where he promised them
to appear to them and they saw those signs which \[had been arranged\]
between him and them; and the news spread among the Children of Israel
that the Messiah had not been killed. Then the grave was dug up, and the
humanity was not found. The parties among them disagreed, and there was
a great amount of talk which is too long to be recounted. Then verily
those disciples who had accepted his injunction separated in the country
and each of them went his own way. One went to the west, one to
Abyssinia, two to Rome, two to the king of Antioch, one to Persia, one
to India, and two remained in the dwellings of the Children of Israel
summoning them to the opinion of the Messiah until most of them were
killed, and the Messiah's claim was spread in east and west by the deeds
of the disciples.

   <span id="A129"></span>*A.*, 129.--The Messiah used to say to the
disciples, "I have only come from my Father and your Father to give you
life from the death of ignorance, and to cure you from the disease of
disobediences, and to heal you from the disease of perverse opinions and
evil manners and wicked deeds, that your souls may be refined and made
alive by the spirit of knowledge, and you may ascend to the kingdom of
heaven beside <span id="page_90">p. 90</span> my Father and your Father.
There you will live the life of the happy ones and will be saved from
the prison of the world, and the pains of the realm of existence, and
the decay which is the dwelling of the miserable ones, and the
neighbourhood of devils, and the dominion of Iblîs" \[Satan\].

   <span id="A147"></span>*A.*, 147.--It is related concerning Jesus,
son of Mary (God's blessings and peace be upon them!) that he said, "O
company of the learned, you have deviated from the way, and you have
loved the world; so as kings have left wisdom to you, leave their rule
to them."

   <span id="A159"></span>*A.*, 159.--This is the meaning of the
Messiah, son of Mary (Peace be upon them!), when he had water in his
right hand and bread in his left hand, "This is my father and this is my
mother." He made the water father, and he made the food mother, because
the water of the earth is in the place of the semen with relation to the
woman. This \[the earth\] brings forth from this \[water\], and this
\[woman\] becomes pregnant from this \[semen\].

   <span id="A160"></span>*A.*, 160.--Al Fo<u>d</u>eil, son of \`Iyâdh,
said: Some people said to Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon him!), "By
what thing do you walk upon the water?" He replied, "By faith and
certainty." They said, "But we believe as you believe, and we are
certain as you are certain." He said, "Then walk." When he said it they
walked with him, and a wave came and raised <span id="page_91">p.
91</span> him up, and Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said to them, "What is
the matter with you?" They replied, "We feared the wave." He said, "Did
you not fear the Lord of the wave?"

   <span id="A161"></span>*A.*, 161.--Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon
him!) said, "Be ashamed before God (Great and glorious is He!) in your
secret affairs, as you are ashamed before Him in your public affairs."

   <span id="A165"></span>*A.*, 165.--Verily I have seen in the Gospel
of Jesus (Peace be upon him!), "From the time a dead body is placed on
the bier until it is placed on the edge of the grave, God (Exalted is
He!) asks of it by His greatness forty questions. First God (Exalted is
He!) says, My servant, you have been pure in the sight of men for years,
but you have not been pure in My sight for an hour, and every day I was
looking into your heart. My servant, what were you occupied with apart
from Me when you were surrounded by My blessings? Were you not deaf and
unhearing?"

   <span id="A172"></span>*A.*, 172.--It is related that Jesus (Peace be
upon him!) went out one day and met Iblîs \[Satan\] with honey in one
hand and ashes in the other; so he said, "What are you doing, O enemy of
God, with this honey and ashes?" He replied, "As regards the honey, I
put it on the lips of slanderers that they may become eloquent from it;
and as regards the ashes, I put them on the face of orphans that men may
hate them."

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

   <span id="A186"></span>*A.*, 186.--It is mentioned concerning Jesus
(Peace be upon him!) that he said, "O Lord, how can I thank Thee when my
thanks is a favour from Thee for which I must give thanks?" Then God
said, "When you have recognised this, you have thanked Me."

   <span id="A197"></span>*A.*, 197.--Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon
them!), said, "O companies of jurists, you have sat on the road of the
life to come, but you have not walked so that you might reach it, nor
have you allowed anyone to pass you to it; so woe to him who is beguiled
by you!"

   <span id="A198"></span>*A.*, 198, Cf. *M.*, 1.--The following is
related on the authority of al Sha\`bî. Gabriel met Jesus (Blessing and
peace be upon them!) and Jesus said to him, "When is the \[last\] hour?"
Then Gabriel trembled in his wings and said, "He who is asked about it
is no better informed than he who asks. It is burdensome in the heavens
and the earth; it will only come suddenly."

   <span id="A206"></span>*A.*, 206.--The son of \`Adî related on the
authority of Abû Sa\`îd al Khadrî a tradition that when his mother
handed over Jesus, son of Mary, to the school that one should teach him,
the teacher said to him, "Write, *Bismillahi* (*In the name of God*)."
Jesus said to him, "What is *bismi* (*In the name*)?" The teacher
replied, "I do not know." Then Jesus said. "\[The letter\] *bâ´* is
*bahâ´ Allah* (*the glory of God*), <span id="page_93">p. 93</span> and
*sîn* is *sanâuhu* (*His grandeur*), and *mîm* is *mulkuhu* (*His
kingdom*), and *Allah* is the God of gods. And *ar Ra<u>h</u>mân* (*the
Merciful*) means Merciful in this world and the next; and *ar
Ra<u>h</u>îm* (*the Compassionate*) means Compassionate in the next
world," etc.

   \[In the above passage Jesus is represented as explaining the words
*Bismillahi ar Ra<u>h</u>mân ar Ra<u>h</u>îm* (*In the name of God, the
Merciful, the Compassionate*) which occur at the beginning of all but
one of the sûrahs of the <u>K</u>orân.\]

   <span id="A213"></span>*A.*, 213.--God (Exalted is He!) revealed to
Jesus (Peace be upon him!), "A prophet does not lack his respect except
in his own country."

   <span id="A214"></span>*A.*, 214.--The Messiah (Peace be upon him!)
said to the disciples when he gave them an injunction, and came to the
end of it, "If you do what I have commanded you, you will be with me
to-morrow in the kingdom of heaven with my Lord and your Lord, and you
will see the angels round His throne (Exalted is He!) singing His praise
and praising His holiness, and there you will enjoy all pleasures
without eating and drinking."

   <span id="A215"></span>*A.*, 215.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said,
"If I had said it, Thou wouldest have known it \[[<u>K</u>orân V,
116](#V:109.md)\], because Thou art He who speaks in my form, and Thou art
the tongue with which I speak, making it sure that Thou alone art in my
desire and in my person."

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

   <span id="A216"></span>*A.*, 216.--It is related on the authority of
Wahb, son of Munabbih, that Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon him!)
said, "Woe to you, slaves of the world! What use is the spreading of the
sun's light to a blind man when he does not see it? Similarly the
abundance of a learned man's knowledge is of no use to him when he does
not act according to it, How many fruits of trees are there, yet all of
them are not useful and are not eaten! And how many learned men are
there, yet all of them do not profit from what they learn! So be on your
guard against the false learned men who wear woollen clothing and bend
down their heads to the earth, glancing under their eyebrows as wolves
glance, Their speech disagrees with their action. Who plucks grapes from
thorns and figs from colocynth? Similarly the speech of a false learned
man produces only falsehood. For when its owner does not tie up a camel
in the desert it goes off to its home and its people; and when one who
possesses knowledge does not act upon it, it departs from his breast and
abandons him and leaves him void. And just as the seed is of no use
without water and soil, so is faith without knowledge and works. Woe to
you, slaves of the world! Everything has a sign by which it is known and
witness is given to it or about it, and verily religion has three signs
by which it is known: faith, knowledge, and works."

STORIES CONNECTED WITH JESUS

   <span id="A10"></span>*A.*, 10.--It is related that Jesus (God's
blessings and peace be upon him!) went out to pray for rain, and when
\[the disciples\] became bored, Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said to them,
"Whoever of you has committed sin, let him return." Then they all
returned, and only one man remained with him in the desert. Jesus (Peace
be upon him!) said to him, "Have you never committed a sin?" He replied,
"By God, I am aware of nothing except that one day when I was praying a
woman passed me and I looked at her with this eye; but when she passed
me I put my finger in my eye, plucked it out, and threw it after the
woman." Then Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said to him, "Do you pray to
God, that I may say Amen to your prayer!" So he prayed and the sky was
covered with clouds, and the rain poured down and they were provided
with water. \[Cf. [*A.*, 201](#A201.md), p. 121.\]

   <span id="A39"></span>*A.*, 39.--\`Omar, son of Sa\`îd, said: Jesus
(Peace be upon him!) passed a village, and lo! all its people were dead
in the open spaces and the roads. Then he said, "O company of the <span
id="page_96">p. 96</span> disciples, these people died because of
\[God's\] anger, for if they had died from any other cause they would
have buried one another." They said, "O Spirit of God, we should like to
know what happened to them." So he asked God (Exalted is He!) and He
revealed to him, "When night comes, call to them and they will answer
you." When night came, he went up on a hill and called, "O people of the
village!" Then one answered him, "At your service, O Spirit of God." He
asked, "What is your condition, and what happened to you?" He replied,
"At night we were in health and in the morning we were in hell." He
said, "How did that come about?" He replied, "By our love of the world
and our obedience to the people of disobediences." He said, "What kind
of love had you for the world?" He replied, "The love of a boy for his
mother; when it approached we rejoiced in it, and when it turned its
back we grieved and wept for it." He said, "What is the matter with your
companions that they have not replied to me?" He said, "Because they are
bridled with bridles of fire in the hands of rough, mighty angels." He
said, "Then how did you answer me from among them?" He replied, "Because
I was among them but was not of them. Then when the punishment descended
on them it smote me along with them, and I was suspended on the brink of
Jahannam, <span id="page_97">p. 97</span> not knowing whether I should
escape from it, or be overturned into it." Then the Messiah said to the
disciples, "Verily the eating of barley bread with pounded salt, and the
wearing of sackcloth, and sleeping on dunghills often accompanies health
in this world and the next."

   <span id="A54"></span>*A.*, 54.--The following is related on the
authority of Jarîr, on the authority of Laith. A man accompanied Jesus,
son of Mary (Peace be upon him!), and said, "I will be with you and will
accompany you." So they set off and came to the bank of a river and sat
down to breakfast; and they had three loaves. They ate two loaves, and a
third loaf was left over. Then Jesus (Peace be upon him!) rose up and
went to the river and drank, after which he returned, but did not find
the loaf; so he said to the man, "Who took the loaf?" He replied, "I do
not know." Then he set off with his companion and saw a gazelle with two
of her young. The narrator says, He called one of them and it came to
him; then he cut its throat and roasted part of it, and he and that man
ate. Then he said to the young gazelle, "Rise, by the permission of
God." When it rose and went away, he said to the man, "I ask you by Him
who has shown you this sign, Who took the loaf?" He replied, "I do not
know." Afterwards they came to a wadi with water in it and Jesus took
the man's hand and they walked on the water. Then when <span
id="page_98">p. 98</span> they had crossed he said to him, "I ask you by
Him who has shown you this sign, Who took the loaf?" He replied, "I do
not know." Then they came to a desert and sat down, and Jesus (Peace be
upon him!) began to collect earth and a heap of sand, after which he
said, "Become gold, by the permission of God (Exalted is He!)." It
became gold, and he divided it into three parts and said, "A third is
for me, a third for you, and a third for him who took the loaf." Then he
said, "I am the one who took the loaf." He said, "It is all yours."
Jesus (Peace be upon him!) then left him and two men came to him in the
desert while he had the wealth with him and wished to take it from him
and kill him. He said, "It is among us in thirds; so send one of you to
the village to buy food for us to eat." The narrator said: They sent one
of them, and he who was sent said \[to himself\], "Why should I divide
this wealth with these men? I shall put poison in this food and kill
them and take the wealth myself." So he did so. And these two men said,
"Why should we give this man a third of the wealth? When he returns we
shall kill him, and divide the wealth between us." The narrator said: So
when he returned they killed him and ate the food and died; and that
wealth remained in the desert with those three men lying dead beside it.
Then Jesus (Peace be upon him!) <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> passed
them in that condition and said to his companions, "This is the world;
so beware of it."

   \[In Asin's collection this is followed by three variations of the
same story.\]

   <span id="A67=M59"></span>*A.*, 67; *M.*, 59.--It is related that a
robber had been committing highway robbery among the Children of Israel
for forty years. \[One day\] Jesus (Peace be upon him!) passed by
followed by a pious man of the Children of Israel who was one of the
disciples. Then the robber said to himself, "This is the prophet of God
who is passing with his disciple beside him; if I went down, I should
make a third with them." So he went down and began to make to approach
the disciple, but he was despising himself out of respect for the
disciple, and saying to himself, "The like of me cannot walk beside this
pious man." \[The narrator\] said: The disciple noticed him and said to
himself, "This man is walking beside me." So he drew himself together
and went to Jesus (Blessing and peace be upon him!) and walked beside
him, and the robber remained behind him. Then God (Exalted is He!)
revealed to Jesus (Blessing and peace be upon him!), "Tell them to begin
their works afresh, for I have nullified their past works. As regards
the disciple, I have nullified his good deeds because of his
self-conceit; and as regards the other, I have nullified his evil deeds
because he despised himself." So \[Jesus\] informed them about that,
<span id="page_100">p. 100</span> and joined the robber to himself in
his wandering and made him one of his disciples. \[Cf. [*A.*,
137](#A137.md), p. 109.\]

   <span id="A84"></span>*A.*, 84.--It is related that Jesus (Peace be
upon him!) passed three people whose bodies were wasted and who were
pale and said, "What has brought on you that which I see?" They replied,
"Fear of hell." He said, "It is God's duty to render secure him who
fears." Afterwards he passed from them and came to other three, and lo!
they were in greater emaciation and paleness, so he said, "What has
brought on you that which I see?" They replied, "Desire of Paradise." He
said, "It is God's duty to give you what you hope for." After that he
passed from them and came to other three, and lo! they were in still
greater emaciation and paleness as though mirrors of light were over
their faces, so he said, "What has brought on you that which I see?"
They replied, "We love God (Great and glorious is He!)." He said, "You
are those who are nearest to God; you are those who are nearest to God;
you are those who are nearest to God."

   \[This is followed in Asin's collection by a variant of the same
story.\]

   <span id="A84_ter"></span>*A.*, 84 *ter*.--It has reached us that
Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon him!), passed four hundred thousand
women who looked pale and who were wearing tunics of hair and wool.
Jesus <span id="page_101">p. 101</span> (Peace be upon him!) said, "What
has made you pale, O companies of women?" They replied, "The thought of
hell has made us pale, O son of Mary; he who enters hell will not taste
cold or drink."

   <span id="A88=M67"></span>*A.*, 88; *M.*, 67.--It is related that
Jesus (Peace be upon him!) passed a man who was blind, leprous, lame,
paralysed on both sides, whose flesh was falling from elephantiasis, but
who was saying, "Praise be to God who has kept me free from that with
which He has afflicted many of His creatures!" Then Jesus said, "O man,
what affliction do I see removed from you?" He replied, "O Spirit of
God, I am better than he in whose heart God has not put the knowledge of
Himself which He has put in my heart." He said to him, "You have spoken
the truth; give me your hand." He gave him his hand, and lo! he became
the most beautiful of men in face and the finest in figure, for God had
removed from him what he was suffering from. So he accompanied Jesus
(Peace be upon him!) and worshipped with him.

   <span id="A99"></span>*A.*, 99.--It is said that while Jesus (Peace
be upon him!) was sitting and an old man was working with a spade with
which he was stirring up the ground, Jesus said, "O God, take away hope
from him." Then the old man put away the spade and lay down and remained
for a time. Jesus then said, "O God, restore hope to him," <span
id="page_102">p. 102</span> and he got up and began to work. Jesus asked
him about that and he said, "While I was working, lo! my soul said to
me, 'How long are you going to work, for you are a very old man?' So I
threw away the spade and lay down. Then my soul said to me, 'By God, you
must have food as long as you remain;' so I arose to my spade."

   <span id="A102=M77"></span>*A.*, 102; *M.*, 77.--It is related that
Jesus (Peace be upon him!) passed by a skull and kicked it with his foot
and said, "Speak, by the permission of God." It said, "O Spirit of God,
I was a king at such and such a time. While I was sitting in my kingdom
on my throne of state with my crown on my head and my troops and my
suite around me, lo! the angel of death appeared to me. Then every limb
of mine perished when he appeared, and my soul went out to him. So would
that there had been abandonment with respect to those companies! And
would that there had been solitude with respect to that society!"

   \[This is followed in Asin's collection by four other accounts of the
story of the skull. The following is the fourth and longest of them.\]

   <span id="A102_quinquies"></span>*A.*, 102 *quinquies*.--The story of
the skull. It is mentioned, but God knows best, that Jesus (Peace be
upon him!) one day passed a wadi called the Wadi of the Resurrection,
and lo! he saw a white skull whose bones were crumbling. Its whiteness
astonished him, for its owner had <span id="page_103">p. 103</span> been
dead for seventy-two years; so Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said, "O God,
whom eye cannot see, or opinions disorder, or men describe, I ask Thee
to permit this skull to tell me to what people it belonged." God
revealed to him, "O Jesus, speak to it and it will speak to you by My
power, for I am omnipotent." \[The narrator\] said: Then Jesus performed
his ablutions, and having prayed two rek\`as, approached it and said,
"In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate." Then the skull
answered him with ready tongue, and it was saying, "O Spirit of God, you
have named the best of the names." Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said to
it, "I ask you by the mighty God, will you not tell me where are the
beauty and the whiteness, and where are the flesh and the fat, and where
are the bones and the spirit?" Then it replied to him, "O Spirit of God,
as regards the beauty and the whiteness, the dust has changed them; and
as regards the flesh and the fat, the worms have eaten them; and as
regards the bones, they have crumbled; and as regards the spirit, it is
to-day in hell in severe punishment." Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said to
it, "I ask you by the mighty God, to what people did you belong?" It
replied to him, "O Spirit of God, I belonged to a people with whom God
was angry in the world." He asked it, "How was God angry with you in the
world?" It replied to him, "O Spirit <span id="page_104">p. 104</span>
of God, God sent us a prophet who brought us the truth, but we rejected
him, and who commanded us to obey God, but we disobeyed Him; so God sent
down on us rain and thunderbolts for seven years and seven months and
seven days. Then one day some of the avenging angels alighted upon us,
every one of whom had two whips, one of iron and one of fire; and an
angel kept grasping my soul from joint to joint, and from vein to vein,
till the soul reached the windpipe." The skull said: "After that the
angel of death stretched out his hand and took out my soul." Jesus
(Peace be upon him!) said to it, "I ask you by the mighty God, will you
not describe to me the angel of death?" It replied to him, "O Spirit of
God, he has a hand in the East and a hand in the West; his head is in
the top of the seventh heaven and his feet are in the lowest borders of
the seven \[*lit*. seventh\] earths; the world is between his knees and
created things are before him." It continued, "O apostle of God, only an
hour later two black and blue angels came to me with voices like
resounding thunder and eyes like swift lightning and short, curly hair,
who were piercing the earth with their nails. Then they asked me, 'Who
is your Lord, and who is your prophet, and who is your imâm?' \[leader
in theology\]. I was terrified at them, O Spirit of God, and said to
them, 'I have no Lord, or prophet, or imâm but God.' They said <span
id="page_105">p. 105</span> to me, 'You are lying, O enemy of God and of
your soul;' and gave me a terrible blow with a sledge-hammer of iron,
from the violence of which blow I felt my bones were broken and my chin
rent; and they threw me into the depths of Jahannam where they punished
me as God wills. While I was in that condition the two recording angels
who write down what people do in the world came and said to me, 'O enemy
of God, journey with us to the dwellings of the people of Paradise.'" It
continued, "So I journeyed with them to the first of the gates of
Paradise, and lo! Paradise had eight gates made of bricks of gold and
silver; its earth is musk, its grass is saffron, its stones are pearls
and jacinths, its rivers are milk and water and honey, its inhabitants
have the neighbouring planets as friends restricted in tents, \[The text
at this point is not clear; the translation of this phrase is therefore
a conjecture.--JR\] the work of Him who possesses glory and honour. I
rejoiced in it, O Spirit of God; then they said to me, 'O enemy of God
and of yourself, you did not do good in the world that this might be
yours; but journey with us to the dwellings of the people of hell.'" It
went on, "Then I journeyed with them to the first of the gates of hell
in which snakes and scorpions were whistling, and I asked them 'For whom
is this punishment?' They replied to me, 'For you and for those who
devour <span id="page_106">p. 106</span> the property of orphans by
oppression.'" It continued, "Thereafter I journeyed with them to the
second gate and lo! there were men suspended by their beards like dogs,
with blood and pus before them for food. I asked them \[the angels\],
'For whom is this punishment?' They replied to me, 'For you, and for
those who drink wine in the world and eat what is forbidden.'" It
continued, "I then journeyed with them to the third gate, and lo! there
were men with fire entering their mouths and coming out at their backs.
I asked, 'For whom is this punishment?' They replied to me, 'For you,
and for those who reproach virtuous women in the world.'" It went on, "I
journeyed next with them to the fourth gate, and lo! there were Women
hanging by their tongues with fire coming out of their mouths. I asked
them \[the angels\], 'For whom is this punishment?' They replied to me,
'For you, and for those who neglect prayer in the world.'" It continued,
"Afterwards I journeyed with them to the fifth gate, and lo! there were
women suspended by their hair with fire above them. I asked them \[the
angels\], 'For whom is this punishment?' They replied to me, 'For you,
and for those who adorn themselves in the world for people who are not
their spouses.'" It continued, "Then I journeyed with them to the sixth
gate, and lo! there were women suspended by their hair and their <span
id="page_107">p. 107</span> mouths. I asked them \[the angels\], 'For
whom is this punishment?' They replied to me, 'For you, and for the
women who go astray in the world.'" It went on, "Thereafter I journeyed
with them to the seventh gate, and lo! there were men under whom was a
well called Hell's Well into which I was thrown, O Spirit of God, and in
which I have endured fierce punishment and seen many terrible things."
Then Jesus (Peace be Upon him!) said, "O skull, if you wish, ask me for
something, by the permission of God." It said, "O Spirit of God, pray
God for me to send me back to the world." So he prayed to God for it,
and He brought it to life for him and sent it back for him sound by the
power of God (Praise be to Him!). It remained for twelve years
worshipping God along with Jesus (Peace be Upon him!) until the
inevitable, i.e. death, came to it. It then died in faith, and God in
His mercy made it one of the people of Paradise.

   <span id="A106"></span>*A.*, 106.--It is related concerning Jesus
(Peace be upon him!) that he came on a fire which was kindled over a man
in the desert. Jesus then took water to put it out, and the fire changed
into a youth, and the man changed into fire. So Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) wept and said, "O Lord, restore them to their former state that I
may see what their sin was." Then that fire was removed from them, and
lo! they were a man and a youth. The man said, "O Jesus, <span
id="page_108">p. 108</span> I have been afflicted in the world by love
of this youth, and desire urged me on until I sinned with him one
Thursday night, after which I sinned with him another day. Then a man
came upon us and said to us, 'Woe to you! Fear God!' I replied to him,
'I am not afraid, and I do not fear.' Then when I died, and the youth
died, God (Great and glorious is He!) turned us into what you see.
Sometimes he becomes fire and burns me, and sometimes I become fire and
burn him. And this is our punishment until the Day of Resurrection."

   <span id="A120"></span>*A.*, 120.--In one of the books which have
been translated \[it is said\] that John and Simon were among the
disciples. John never sat in any company without laughing and making
those around him laugh; and Simon never sat in any company without
weeping and making those around him weep. \[Once\] Simon said to John,
"How often you laugh, as though you had ceased from your work!" John
replied to him, "How often you weep, as though you had despaired of your
Lord!" Then God revealed to the Messiah, "The more attractive of the two
natures to Me is John's nature."

   <span id="A121"></span>*A.*, 121.--In a book also \[it is said\] that
Jesus, son of Mary, met John, son of Zechariah (Blessing and peace be
upon them!) and John smiled to him. Then Jesus said to him, "Verily you
smile the smile of a believer." John said to him, "Verily you frown the
frown of a despondent <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> one." God then
revealed to Jesus, "What John does is more attractive to me."

   \[While the two preceding passages presumably come from the same
source, it should be noted that in the Arabic there is no confusion
between the two Johns. In 120 the name is Yu<u>h</u>annâ, and in 121 it
is Ya<u>h</u>yâ.\]

   <span id="A131"></span>*A.*, 131.--It is mentioned that Jesus (Peace
be upon him!) used to raise the dead to life by the permission of God
(Exalted is He!). Some unbelievers \[once\] said to him, "You have
raised people who have died recently, and perhaps they were not dead; so
raise for us one who died in the earliest times." He said to them,
"Choose whom you will." They said, "Raise for us Shem, son of Noah."
Then he came to his grave and prayed two rek\`as and called on God
(Exalted is He!), and God raised Shem, son of Noah, and lo! his head and
beard had become white. But someone said, "What is this? There were no
white hairs in your day." He replied, "I heard the summons, and I
thought the Resurrection had come, so the hair of my head and beard
became white from terror." Someone asked, "How long have you been dead?"
He replied, "For four thousand years; but the agony of death has not
left me yet."

   <span id="A137"></span>*A.*, 137.--In the time of Jesus (Blessing and
peace be upon him!) there was a man called Accursed for his avarice. One
day a man who <span id="page_110">p. 110</span> wished to make a raid
came to him and said, "O Accursed, give me some arms to help me in my
raid, and by so doing you will be safe from hell"; but he turned away
from him and gave him nothing. The man then turned back, but the
accursed one repented and called to him and gave him his sword. The man
returned, and Jesus (Peace be upon him!), accompanied by a pious man who
had worshipped God for seventy years, met him and said to him, "Where
have you come from with this sword?" He replied, "The accursed one gave
me it." So Jesus rejoiced at his almsgiving. The accursed one was \[one
day\] sitting at his door, and when Jesus (Peace be upon him!) passed
him accompanied by the pious man, the accursed one said to himself, "I
will arise and look at the face of Jesus and at the face of the pious
man." So when he arose and looked at them the pious man said, "I shall
fly and run from this accursed one before he burns me with his fire."
Then God (Great and glorious is He!) revealed to Jesus (Peace be upon
him!), "Say to My servant, I have forgiven this sinner because of his
almsgiving with the sword and because of his love for you; and say to
the pious man, Verily he will be your friend in Paradise." The pious man
said, "By God, I do not wish Paradise in his company, neither do I wish
a friend like him." So God (Great and glorious is He!) revealed to Jesus
<span id="page_111">p. 111</span> (Peace be upon him!), "Say to My
servant, Verily you were not pleased with My decree and you despised My
servant, so I have made you accursed among the people of hell; I have
changed your abodes in Paradise for his in hell, and have given your
abodes in Paradise to My servant and his abodes in hell to you." \[Cf.
[*A.*, 67; *M.*, 59](#A67=M59.md), p. 99 ?\].

   <span id="A138"></span>*A.*, 138.--\`Abdallah, son of <u>H</u>abân,
al Bokhârî told us on the authority of Abû al Faraj al Azdî that Jesus,
son of Mary (Peace be upon them!), passed by a village in which was a
fuller. The people of the village said, "O Jesus, verily this fuller
tears our clothes for us and keeps them; so pray to God that He should
not let him come back with his bundle." So Jesus (Peace be upon him!)
said, "O God, do not let him come back with his bundle." \[The
narrator\] said: Then the fuller went away to clean the clothes, and he
had three loaves with him. And one who was practising devotion in those
hills came to the fuller and said to him, "Have you any bread to give me
to eat, or to show me that I may smell its odour? For I have not eaten
any bread for such and such a time." So he gave him a loaf, and he said,
"O fuller, God forgive you your sin and purify your heart!" Then he gave
him the second, and he said, "O fuller, God forgive you your past and
your future sins!" So he gave him the third to eat, and he said, <span
id="page_112">p. 112</span> "O fuller, God build you a palace in
Paradise!" The fuller returned safe in the evening and the villagers
said, "O Jesus, this fuller has come back." He said, "Call him." Then
when he came to him he said, "O fuller, tell me what you did to-day." He
replied, "One of the pilgrims of those hills came to me asking for food
and I gave him three loaves to eat, and with every loaf I gave him he
offered up prayers for me." Jesus (Blessing and Peace be upon him!)
said, "Bring your bundle that I may look at it." He gave him it and he
opened it, and lo! there was in it a black snake curbed with an iron
curb. Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said, "O black one!" It replied, "At
your service, O prophet of God!" He said, "Have you not been sent to
this man?" It replied, "Yes, but a pilgrim from those hills came to him
and asked him for food, and with every loaf he gave him to eat he
offered up a prayer for him, and an angel was standing and saying
'Amen!' Then God (Exalted is He!) sent an angel to me and he curbed me
with an iron curb." Then Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said, "O fuller,
recommence your work, for God has forgiven you by the blessing of your
almsgiving to Him." \[Cf. [*A.*, 210](#A210.md), p. 126.\]

   <span id="A143_bis"></span>*A.*, 143 *bis*.--The prophet--i.e.
Mohammad--(God bless him and grant him peace!) said that God commanded
John, son of Zechariah, five words according to which he was to act, and
he <span id="page_113">p. 113</span> was to command the Children of
Israel that they should act according to them, but he was on the point
of delaying with them. So Jesus said, "Verily God has commanded you five
words according to which you should act, and you must command the
Children of Israel that they should act according to them; so either you
must command them, or I will command them." John said, "I am afraid that
if you precede me with them, I may be swallowed up or punished." Then he
gathered the people tagether in Jerusalem, and the mosque was full and
they sat on the pinnacles; and he said, "Verily God commanded me five
words according to which I should act and should order you to act
according to them. The first is that you should worship God and
associate nothing with Him; for he who associates anything with God is
like a man who buys a slave with all his property, in gold or documents,
and says, 'This is my house and this is my work, so work and bring me
profit,' then he works and brings profit for someone else. So which of
you wishes to be like that? And verily God commands you to practise
prayer; and when you pray, do not turn about, for God directs His face
to His servant's face in his prayer so long as he does not turn about.
And He commands you to observe fasting, for that is like a man in a
company who has a purse in which is musk whose perfume pleases them all,
or <span id="page_114">p. 114</span> pleases him; and verily the perfume
of him who fasts is better in God's estimation than the perfume of musk.
And He commands you to give alms; for that is like a man whom the enemy
have taken captive and bound his hand to his neck and put him forward to
execute him \[*lit*. to strike his neck\], who says, 'I will ransom it
\[his neck\] from you by little or by much;' so he ransoms himself from
them. And He commands you to glorify God; for that is like a man in
pursuit of whom the enemy go out in haste until he comes to a strong
fort and preserves himself from them. Similarly the worshipper preserves
himself from the devil only by glorifying God."

   \[Although this is attributed to John the Baptist, it is included
because Jesus is said to have been prepared to say it if John did not.\]

   <span id="A148"></span>*A.*, 148.--It is related in the record that
Jesus (Blessing and peace be upon him!) passed a village; and in that
village there was a hill, and in the hill there was great weeping and
wailing. He said to the villagers, "What is this weeping and this
wailing in this hill?" They replied, "O Jesus, from the time we settled
in this village we have been hearing this weeping and this wailing in
this hill." Then Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said, "O Lord, permit this
hill to speak to me." God gave the hill utterance and it said, "O Jesus,
what do you <span id="page_115">p. 115</span> want from me?" He said,
"Tell me the meaning of your weeping and wailing." It said, "O Jesus, I
am the hill from which the idols were being hewn which men worship
instead of God, and I am afraid lest God (Exalted is He!) should cast me
into the fire of Jahannam, for I heard God saying, 'Fear hell whose fuel
is men and stones.'" \[<u>K</u>orân II, 22; LXVI, 6.\] Then God revealed
to Jesus (Blessing and peace be upon him!), "Say to the him, Be at
peace, for I have protected it from Jahannam."

   <span id="A151"></span>*A.*, 151.--Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon
them!), passed a graveyard and called to a man in it. Then God (Exalted
is He!) brought him to life, and \[Jesus\] said, "Who are you?" He
replied, "I was a carrier, carrying things for people. One day I carried
some firewood for a man and broke off a piece of it with which I was
pierced; and I am being sued for it since my death."

   <span id="A152"></span>*A.*, 152.--It is related that Jesus (Blessing
and peace be upon him!) passed a grave and kicked it with his foot and
said, "O you who are in the grave, arise by the permission of God
(Exalted is He!)." Then a man arose from the grave and said, "O Spirit
of God, what do you want with me? For I have been standing in judgment
for seventy years till I heard the shout, 'Answer the Spirit of God.'"
Jesus said, "O you, you have committed many faults and sins, so what did
you do?" He replied, "O Spirit of God, <span id="page_116">p. 116</span>
I was a seller of fuel who carried firewood on my head and ate what was
allowable and gave alms." Jesus said, "Praise be to God! A seller of
fuel who carried firewood on his head and ate what was allowable and
gave alms, and he has been standing in judgment for seventy years!" Then
Jesus asked him about what his Lord said to him in the judgment, and he
said, "O Spirit of God, one of the rebukes of my Lord was that He said,
'Do you remember the day My servant, so and so, hired you to carry a
bundle of firewood for him, and you took a piece of wood from it and
were pierced with it and threw it away from its place in the bundle out
of your despite for Me, although you knew that I am God who looks at
your work and your intention?'"

   <span id="A164"></span>*A.*, 164.--It is related on the authority of
Mohammad, son of Abû Mûsâ, concerning Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon
him!), that he passed an afflicted man and treated him kindly and said,
"O God, I beseech Thee to heal him." Then God (Exalted is He!) revealed
to him, "How can I heal him from that with which I am healing him?"
\[Showing that bodily trouble may lead to spiritual advantage.\]

   <span id="A170"></span>*A.*, 170.--Jesus (Peace be upon him!) passed
a young man watering a garden, and the young man said to Jesus, "Ask
your Lord to provide me with an atom of His love." Jesus replied, "You
are not able for an atom." So he said, <span id="page_117">p. 117</span>
"Half an atom." Then Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said, "O Lord, provide
him with half an atom of Thy love;" after which Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) went away. A long time afterwards, when he passed that young man's
place, he asked about him and the people said, "He became possessed and
went to the mountains." Then Jesus (Peace be upon him!) prayed God to
show him to him, and he saw him among the mountains and found him
standing on a high rock whose tip reached to the sky. Jesus (Peace be
upon him!) saluted him, but he did not return the salutation; so he
said, "I am Jesus." Then God (Exalted is He!) revealed to Jesus, "How
can he in whose heart is half an atom of My love listen to the words of
men? By My might and glory, if I were to cleave him with a saw, he would
not be aware of that!" \[Cf. [*A.*, 189](#A189.md), p. 120.\]

   <span id="A171"></span>*A.*, 171.--It is related in the stories that
John \[the Baptist\] and Jesus (Peace be upon them!) were walking in the
market when a woman knocked against them. Then John said, "I am not
cognisant of that." Jesus said, "Praise be to God! Your body is with me,
but where is your heart?" He replied, "O cousin, if my heart found rest
in something other than God for the twinkling of an eye, I should think
that I had not known God."

   <span id="A178"></span>*A.*, 178.--Wahb, son of Munabbih, said:
Jesus, son of Mary (Peace be upon him!), went out one <span
id="page_118">p. 118</span> day with a company of his companions and
when the day was advanced they passed a field where the corn was ready
to be rubbed, and they said, "O prophet of God, verily we are hungry."
Then God revealed to him, "Give them permission concerning their food."
So he gave them permission, and they separated in the field rubbing and
eating. But while they were doing that, the owner of the field came, and
he was saying, "It is my field and my land which I inherited from my
ancestors. By whose permission are you eating, you people?" \[The
narrator\] said: Then Jesus prayed to his Lord, and God (Exalted is He!)
raised up all who had possessed that land from the time of Adam till
that time. Then lo! beside every ear, or what God wills, was a man or
woman, all of them shouting, "It is my field and my land which I
inherited from my ancestors." The man was terrified at them--and word of
Jesus (Peace be upon him!) had reached him, but he had not recognised
him--so when he recognised him, he said, "I apologise to you, O apostle
of God. My field and my possessions are at your disposal." Then Jesus
(Peace be upon him!) wept and said, "Woe to you! All these have
inherited this land and have peopled it, then have gone away from it;
and you too will go away from it, and overtaking them, will have no land
or possessions."

   <span id="A179"></span>*A.*, 179.--Mâlik, son of Anas, said: It
reached <span id="page_119">p. 119</span> me that two women came to
Jesus (Peace be upon him!) and said, "O Spirit of God, pray to God for
us to bring forth our father for us, for he perished and we are absent
from him." He said, "Do you know his grave?" They replied, "Yes." So he
went with them, and they came to a grave and said, "This is it." Then he
prayed to God and one was brought forth to them, but lo! it was not he;
so he prayed and he was sent back. Then they led him to another grave
and he prayed that he should be brought forth, and he came forth, and
lo! it was he. They clung to him and saluted him and said, "O prophet of
God, O teacher of good, pray God to make him stay with us." He said,
"How can I pray for him when no provision by which he may live has been
left for him?" Then he sent him back and departed.

   <span id="A151"></span>*A.*, 151.--Mâlik, son of Anas, said: It
reached me that Jesus (Peace be upon him!) came to a village whose
fortresses had fallen in ruins, whose streams were dried up, and whose
trees were blighted. Then he called, "O ruin, where are your people?"
But no one answered him. Again he called, "O ruin, where are your
people?" But no one answered him. Then a voice cried, "Jesus, son of
Mary, they perished and the earth swallowed them up, and their works
returned as chains on their necks till the Day of Resurrection." So
Jesus (Peace be upon him!) wept.

   <span id="A183"></span>*A.*, 183.--Joseph, son of Asbâ<u>t</u>, said:
One of the disciples died and they grieved bitterly for him and
complained of that to the Messiah (God bless him and grant him peace!).
Then he stood over his grave and prayed, and God (Exalted is He!)
brought him back to life; and he had on his feet sandals of fire. Jesus
asked about that and he said, "By God, I was never disobedient, except
that \[once\] I passed one who was wronged and did not help him, so I
was shod with these sandals."

   <span id="A189"></span>*A.*, 189.--It is related that Jesus (Peace be
upon him!) one day passed a hill in which he saw a cell. He drew near it
and found in it a devotee whose back was bent, whoge body was wasted,
and in whom austerity had reached its utmost limits. Jesus saluted him
and wondered at his evidences \[of devotion\] which he saw. So Jesus
said to him, "How long have you been in this place?" He replied, "For
seventy years I have been asking Him for one thing which He has not
granted me yet. Perhaps you, O Spirit of God, may intercede for me
concerning it, then possibly it may be granted." Jesus said, "What is
your requirement?" He replied, "I asked Him to let me taste the amount
of an atom of His pure love." Jesus said to him, "I shall pray to God
for you about that." So he prayed for him that night, and God (Exalted
is He!) revealed to him, "I have accepted your <span id="page_121">p.
121</span> intercession and granted your request." Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) returned to him to the place after some days to see what the
condition of the devotee was, and saw the cell had fallen down and a
great fissure had appeared in the ground below it. Jesus (Peace be upon
him!) went down into that fissure and went some leagues in it and saw
the devotee in a cave under that him standing with his eyes staring and
his mouth open. Then Jesus (Peace be upon him!) saluted him, but he did
not give him an answer. While Jesus was wondering at his condition
someone shouted to him, "O Jesus, he has asked us for something like an
atom of Our pure love, and We knew that he was not able for that, so We
gave him a seventieth part of an atom, and he is bewildered in it thus;
so what would it have been like if We had given him more than that?"

   <span id="A201"></span>*A.*, 201.--It is related that Jesus, son of
Mary, (Peace be upon him!) went out with the people to pray for rain;
and God revealed to him, "Do not ask for rain while sinners are with
you." Jesus told them of that and shouted among them, "Let him among us
who belongs to those who have committed faults and sins depart." The
narrator said: All the people departed except one man who had something
wrong with his right eye. Jesus (Peace be upon him!) said to him, "Why
did you not depart with the people?" <span id="page_122">p. 122</span>
He replied, "O Spirit of God, I have never disobeyed God with the glance
of an eye; but \[once\] I turned and looked unintentionally with this
eye at a woman's foot, so I plucked it out; and if I had looked with the
other eye, I would have plucked it out." \[The narrator\] said: Then
Jesus (Peace be upon him!) wept till his beard became wet with his
tears, and said to him, "Do you pray to God for us!" He said, "God
forbid that I should pray, when you are God's Spirit and Word!" Then
Jesus (Peace be upon him!) raised his hands and said, "O God, verily
Thou hast created us and hast stood security for our provisions; so send
the sky raining copiously upon us." Jesus (Peace be upon him!) had not
finished his prayer before the rain descended and covered the
worshippers and the country. \[Cf. [*A.*, 10](#A10.md), p. 95.\]

   <span id="A202"></span>*A.*, 202.--It is related that John \[the
Baptist\] and Jesus (Blessing and peace be upon them!) went together on
a journey, and John (Peace be upon him!) once slept during worship which
Jesus (Peace be upon him!) performed. Jesus (Peace be upon him!) wished
to waken him, but God (Exalted is He!) revealed to Jesus (Blessing and
peace be upon him!), "O Jesus, verily John's spirit is with Me in My
holy presence and his body is before Me in My earth; and I have made him
excel in beauty the noble ones of My angels."

   <span id="A203"></span>*A.*, 203.--The historians and biographers
<span id="page_123">p. 123</span> mentioned that a man called Isaac,
belonging to the Children of Israel, in the time of Jesus, son of Mary
(Peace be upon them!), had a cousin who was one of the most beautiful
people of her time to whom he was devoted. She died, and he attached
himself to her grave and remained for a time visiting her regularly. One
day Jesus passed him when he was weeping at her grave, and Jesus (Peace
be upon him!) said to him, "What is making you weep, Isaac?" He replied,
"O Spirit of God, I had a cousin who was my wife, whom I loved ardently;
but she has died and this is her grave, and I am unable to be patient
without her, for separation from her has killed me." Jesus said to him,
"Would you like me to bring her to life for you by God's permission?" He
said, "Yes, O Spirit of God." So Jesus stood over the grave and said,
"Arise, you who are in this grave, by God's permission." Then the grave
burst open and a black slave came out of it with fire issuing from his
nostrils and eyes and the other openings of his face, and he was saying,
"There is no God but God. Jesus is God's Spirit and Word, His servant
and His apostle." Isaac said, "O Spirit and Word of God, this grave is
not the one in which my wife is, this is it;" and he pointed to another
grave. So Jesus said to the black one, "Return to the condition in which
you were." He fell down dead and he hid him in his grave. Thereafter
<span id="page_124">p. 124</span> he stood over the other grave and
said, "Arise, you who are dwelling in this grave, by God's permission."
Then the woman arose, and she was scattering the dust from her face.
Jesus said, "Is this your wife?" He replied, "Yes, O Spirit of God." He
said, "Take her by the hand and go away." He took her and went off, but
he became sleepy and said to her, "Watchfulness at your grave has killed
me, so I want to take some rest." She said, "Do so." Then he put his
head in her lap and slept. While he was sleeping the king's son passed
her; he was beautiful and good-looking, with lordly mien, and was riding
on a fine horse. When she saw him she fell in love with him and rose up
quickly to him; and when he saw her she affected his heart. Then she
came to him and said, "Take me;" so he took her up behind him on his
horse and went on. When her husband arose and looked and did not see
her, he arose to search for her. He followed the traces of the horse and
overtook them and said to the king's son, "Give me my wife who is my
cousin." But she denied him and said, "I am the slavegirl of the king's
son." He said, "No, you are my wife and my cousin." She said, "I do not
know you; I am only the slavegirl of the king's son." Then the king's
son said to him, "Do you want to corrupt my slavegirl?" He said, "By
God, she is my wife, and Jesus, son of Mary, raised her for me <span
id="page_125">p. 125</span> by God's permission after she had been
dead." While they were disputing, Jesus (God bless him and grant him
peace!) passed, and Isaac said, "O Spirit of God, is not this my wife
whom you brought to life for me by God's permission?" He said, "Yes."
She said, "O Spirit of God, he is lying, for I am the slavegirl of the
king's son." And the king's son said, "This is my slavegirl." Jesus
said, "Are you not she whom I raised to life by God's permission?" She
said, "No, by God, O Spirit of God." He said, "Then restore to us what
we gave you;" and she fell down dead. Then Jesus said, "Whoever wishes
to look at a man whom God caused to die while he was an unbeliever, then
brought him to life and caused him to die a Muslim, let him look at that
black one; and whoever wishes to look at a woman whom God caused to die
while she was a believer, then brought her to life and caused her to die
an unbeliever, let him look at this woman." And Isaac, the Israelite,
covenanted with God (Exalted is He!) that he would never marry; and he
wandered aimlessly like a madman in the deserts, weeping.

   <span id="A208"></span>*A.*, 208.--I saw in a book that Jesus
(Blessing and peace be upon him!) passed a man who was making
donkey-saddles and saying in his worship, "O Lord, if I knew where Thine
ass is on which Thou ridest, I would make a saddle for it and inlay it
with jewels." Then the Messiah shook <span id="page_126">p. 126</span>
him and said, "Woe to you! Has God (Exalted is He!) an ass?" Then God
(Exalted is He!) revealed to Jesus (Blessing and peace be upon him!),
"Leave the man alone, for he has glorified Me according to his ability."

   <span id="A210"></span>*A.*, 210.--It is related that some people
passed Jesus, son of Mary, and he said, "One of these will die to-day,
if God will." Then they went away. In the evening they returned to him
with bundles of firewood, and he said, "Put them down." Then he said to
him of whom he said that he would die that day, "Loosen your firewood."
He loosened it, and lo! there was a black snake in it. Jesus said, "What
have you done to-day?" He replied, "I have done nothing." He said,
"Consider what you have done." He said, "I have done nothing, except
that I had a piece of bread in my hand, and a poor man passed me and
begged from me and I gave him some of it." Then he said, "By it
\[death\] was averted from you." \[Cf. [*A.*, 138](#A138.md), p. 111.\]

   The following saying about Jesus is attributed to Mohammad.

   <span id="A211"></span>*A.*, 211.--Verily God (Exalted is He!) has
sent me out of mercy to all men. Summon \[them\] in my name (God have
mercy on you!) and do not disagree as the disciples disagreed with
Jesus, for he summoned them to do something similar to that to which I
summon you, and those who <span id="page_127">p. 127</span> were in his
vicinity believed. It displeased him, and Jesus, son of Mary, complained
of that to God; and in the morning every man of them was speaking the
language of the people to which he went. Then Jesus said to them, "This
is a matter upon which God is resolved for you; so go and accomplish
it."

   <span id="A222"></span>*A.*, 222.--It is related that Jesus (Peace be
upon him!) one day passed a man standing between two graves, who was
bowing and worshipping. He saluted him and said, "I see you between
these two bowing and worshipping." He replied to him, "They are my
parents who were kind and gentle to me; so when they died I took an oath
on myself that I would worship God between their graves till I died." He
asked him, "How long, sir, have you been doing this?" He replied, "Three
hundred years." He said, "Has any news come to you from God (Exalted is
He!) that He has forgiven you, or have you any request to Him, or have
you prayed to Him about anything?" He replied, "No news has come to me;
but I have had a request to Him: I prayed to Him that He should let me
meet Jesus, but I do not know whether He has accepted my prayer or not."
Then Jesus said to him, "Be of good cheer; He has accepted your prayer.
I am Jesus." He said to him, "O Jesus, by Him who has accepted my
prayer, would you not stretch out your leg that I might place my head
<span id="page_128">p. 128</span> on it for an hour?" So Jesus (Peace be
upon him!) stretched out his leg, and he put his head on it and lifted
up his eyes to heaven and said, "O God, by the honour of this prophet
with Thee, as Thou hast accepted my prayer and caused me to meet him, I
beseech Thee to take my spirit in his bosom." He had not come to the end
of his prayer before he died with his head in the lap of Jesus (Peace be
upon him!). Then Jesus looked for something in which to shroud him, but
found nothing for him except his worn cloak and a brick which he used to
use when he wished to sleep. So Jesus said, "O Lord, when Thou hast
gathered the first ones and the last ones, and askest them about what
they have gained, about what wilt Thou ask this servant?" Then God
revealed to him, "O Jesus, by My greatness and My majesty, I will ask
him about this cloak, whence he acquired it, and about this brick, from
what ground he made it, or from what wall he took it. Verily I have
sworn by Myself, if an oppressor comes near Me, I will be an oppressor.
By My greatness and My majesty, I will make him who mixes water with
bricks separate the water from the bricks." Then Jesus prayed, "O God,
forgive us by Thy mercy, and favour us with Thy kindness and Thy
Paradise; and pardon us all and make us die Muslims and join us to the
upright. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!"
