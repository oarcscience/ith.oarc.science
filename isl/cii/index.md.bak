# CHRIST IN ISLÂM

### BY REV. JAMES ROBSON, M.A.

 

###### \[London, John Murray\]

#### \[1929\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This small book is a collection of traditional sayings and stories
attributed to Jesus taken from Islamic literature. Islam has alway
considered Jesus to be one of the greatest of prophets, second only to
Mohammed, and this beautiful collection is illustrative of some of the
ways he is perceived in the Islamic world. As stated in the
introduction, this was not the first time that collections like this had
been presented in Western languages, but it was the most extensive ever
presented in English until 2001, when *The Muslim Jesus*, by Tarif
Khalidi was published. Khalidi's book is about 3-4 times as large as
this one, with 303 different selections, and full documentation of the
sources from which they are derived. It cannot be recommended highly
enough to anyone interested in comparative religion or alternative views
of Jesus.

The book is presented here as one large (196K) file, although there are
extensive anchors to make it navigable.

<span class="small">Notes on the hypertext transcription: \` and ´
represent left and right apostrophes (*\`ayn* and *hamza*) in Arabic
words, circumflexes represent macrons, and underlines represent
dot-unders. I have changed the word Pentateuch used by Robson to Torah,
which is the word used in the Arabic originals and which is also
standard usage in English. As references to Torah in Arabic works are
almost always directed at Jews, it makes more sense to refer to it by
its Hebrew rather that its Greek name. There was one footnote in the
entire book, on page 105. I embedded it in the text inside square
bracket with the initials 'JR'.</span>
