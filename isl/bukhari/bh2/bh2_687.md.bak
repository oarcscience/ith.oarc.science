### Hadith 2:685

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

When the Prophet performed the Tawaf of the Ka'ba, he did Ramal during
the first three rounds and in the last four rounds he used to walk and
while doing Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, he used to run in the midst of
the rain water passage.

Apostle that I was ill. ...](bh2_688.md)
