### Hadith 2:353

*Narrated Um 'Atiyya:*

One of the daughters of the Prophet expired and he came to us and said,
"Wash her with Sidr (water) for odd number of times, i.e. three, five or
more, if you think it necessary, and in the last, put camphor or (some
camphor on her), and when you finish, notify me." So when we finished we
informed him. He gave his waist-sheet to us (to shroud her). We entwined
the hair (of the deceased girl) in three braids and made them fall at
her back.
