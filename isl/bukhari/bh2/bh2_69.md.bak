### Hadith 2:70

*Narrated Aisha:*

Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) came to my house while two girls were singing
beside me the songs of Buath (a story about the war between the two
tribes of the Ansar, the Khazraj and the Aus, before Islam). The Prophet
(p.b.u.h) lay down and turned his face to the other side. Then Abu Bakr
came and spoke to me harshly saying, "Musical instruments of Satan near
the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ?" Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) turned his face
towards him and said, "Leave them." When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I
signalled to those girls to go out and they left. It was the day of 'Id,
and the Black people were playing with shields and spears; so either I
requested the Prophet (p.b.u.h) or he asked me whether I would like to
see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then the Prophet
(p.b.u.h) made me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek
and he was saying, "Carry on! O Bani Arfida," till I got tired. The
Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked me, "Are you satisfied (Is that sufficient for
you)?" I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave.
