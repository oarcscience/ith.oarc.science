### Hadith 2:116

*Narrated 'Asim:*

I asked Anas bin Malik about the Qunut. Anas replied, "Definitely it was
(recited)". I asked, "Before bowing or after it?" Anas replied, "Before
bowing." I added, "So and so has told me that you had informed him that
it had been after bowing." Anas said, "He told an untruth (i.e. "was
mistaken," according to the Hijazi dialect). Allah's Apostle recited
Qunut after bowing for a period of one month." Anas added, "The Prophet
sent about seventy men (who knew the Quran by heart) towards the pagans
(of Najd) who were less than they in number and there was a peace treaty
between them and Allah's Apostles (but the Pagans broke the treaty and
killed the seventy men). So Allah's Apostle recited Qunut for a period
of one month asking Allah to punish them."
