### Hadith 2:210

*Narrated Az-Zuhri:*

Salim told me, "'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, 'I saw Allah's Apostle
delaying the Maghrib prayer till he offered it along with the Isha
prayer whenever he was in a hurry during the journey.' " Salim said,
"Abdullah bin Umar used to do the same whenever he was in a hurry during
the journey. After making the call for Iqama, for the Maghrib prayer he
used to offer three Rakat and then perform Tasllm. After waiting for a
short while, he would pronounce the Iqama for the 'Isha' prayer and
offer two Rakat and perform Taslim. He never prayed any Nawafil in
between the two prayers or after the 'Isha' prayers till he got up in
the middle of the night (for Tahajjud prayer)."
