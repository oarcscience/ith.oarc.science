The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Whoever takes a bath on Friday, purifies
himself as much as he can, then uses his (hair) oil or perfumes himself

prays as much as (Allah has) written for him and then remains silent
while the Imam is delivering the Khutba, his sins in-between the present
and the last Friday would be forgiven."
