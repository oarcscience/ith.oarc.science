*Narrated Yahya bin Said:*

I asked 'Amra about taking a bath on Fridays. She replied, " Aisha said,
'The people used to work (for their livelihood) and whenever they went
for the Jumua prayer, they used to go to the mosque in the same shape as
they had been in work. So they were asked to take a bath on Friday.' "

[Next: 2:27: Anas bin Malik: The Prophet used to offer the Jumua prayer
immediately after mid-day. ...](bh2_26.md)
