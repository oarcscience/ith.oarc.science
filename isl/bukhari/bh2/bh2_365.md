### Hadith 2:364

*Narrated Sad from his father:*

Once the meal of 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf was brought in front of him, and
he said, "Mustab bin 'Umar was martyred and he was better than I, and he
had nothing except his Burd (a black square narrow dress) to be shrouded
in. Hamza or another person was martyred and he was also better than I
and he had nothing to be shrouded in except his Burd. No doubt, I fear
that the rewards of my deeds might have been given early in this world."
Then he started weeping.

and he was fasting. ...](bh2_366)
