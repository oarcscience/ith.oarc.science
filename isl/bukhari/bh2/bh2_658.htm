<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:656</H3><P><I>Narrated Yazid bin Ruman from 'Urwa:</I></P>
'Aisha said that the Prophet said to her, "O Aisha! Were your nation 
not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the
Ka'ba demolished and would have included in it the portion which had 
been left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would
have made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards
the west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the 
foundations laid by Abraham." That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair to 
demolish the Ka'ba. Jazz said, "I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair when he demolished
and rebuilt the Ka'ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the 
unroofed portion of Ka'ba which is at present in the form of a 
compound towards the north-west of the Ka'ba). I saw the original 
foundations of Abraham which were of stones resembling the humps of 
camels." So Jarir asked Yazid, "Where was the place of those stones?" 
Jazz said, "I will just now show it to you." So Jarir accompanied 
Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and Jazz pointed to a place and said, "Here
it is." Jarir said, "It appeared to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr 
or so."
