### Hadith 2:75

*Narrated Al-Bara' bin 'Azib:*

The Prophet delivered the Khutba after offering the prayer on the Day of
Nahr and said, "Whoever offers the prayer like us and slaughters like us
then his Nusuk (sacrifice) will be accepted by Allah. And whoever
slaughters his sacrifice before the 'Id prayer then he has not done the
sacrifice." Abi Burda bin Niyar, the uncle of Al-Bara' said, "O Allah's
Apostle! I have slaughtered my sheep before the 'Id prayer and I thought
today as a day of eating and drinking (not alcoholic drinks), and I
liked that my sheep should be the first to be slaughtered in my house.
So slaughtered my sheep and took my food before coming for the prayer."
The Prophet said, "The sheep which you have slaughtered is just mutton
(not a Nusuk)." He (Abu Burda) said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have a young
she-goat which is dearer to me than two sheep. Will that be sufficient
as a Nusuk on my behalf? "The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Yes, it will be
sufficient for you but it will not be sufficient (as a Nusuk) for anyone
else after you."
