### Hadith 2:589

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abbas :*

Al-Fadl (his brother) was riding behind Allah's Apostle and a woman from
the tribe of Khath'am came and Al-Fadl started looking at her and she
started looking at him. The Prophet turned Al-Fadl's face to the other
side. The woman said, "O Allah's Apostle! The obligation of Hajj
enjoined by Allah on His devotees has become due on my father and he is
old and weak, and he cannot sit firm on the Mount; may I perform Hajj on
his behalf?" The Prophet replied, "Yes, you may." That happened during
the Hajj-al-Wida (of the Prophet ).

Mount at Dhul Hulaifa ...](bh2_592.md)
