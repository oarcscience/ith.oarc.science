### Hadith 2:106

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

Once I passed the night in the house of Maimuna (his aunt). I slept
across the bed while Allah's Apostle and his wife slept length-wise. The
Prophet slept till midnight or nearly so and woke up rubbing his face
and recited ten verses from Surat "Aal-Imran." Allah's Apostle went
towards a leather skin and performed ablution in the most perfect way
and then stood for the prayer. I did the same and stood beside him. The
Prophet put his right hand on my head, twisted my ear and then prayed
two Rakat five times and then ended his prayer with Witr. He laid down
till the Muadh-dhin came then he stood up and offered two Rakat (Sunna
of Fajr prayer) and then went out and offered the Fajr prayer.

(See Hadith No. 183, Vol. 1)
