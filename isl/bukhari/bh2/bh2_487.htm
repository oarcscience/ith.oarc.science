<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:486</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever is made wealthy by Allah and does not 
pay the Zakat of his wealth, then on the Day of Resurrection his 
wealth will be made like a bald-headed poisonous male snake with two 
black spots over the eyes. The snake will encircle his neck and bite 
his cheeks and say, 'I am your wealth, I am your treasure.' " Then the
Prophet recited the holy verses:-- 'Let not those who withhold . . .' 
(to the end of the verse). (3.180).
