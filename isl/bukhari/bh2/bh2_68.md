### Hadith 2:69

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Umar:*

Umar bought a silk cloak from the market, took it to Allah's Apostle and
said, "O Allah's Apostle! Take it and adorn yourself with it during the
'Id and when the delegations visit you." Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h)
replied, "This dress is for those who have no share (in the Hereafter)."
After a long period Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent to Umar a cloak of
silk brocade. Umar came to Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) with the cloak and
said, "O Allah's Apostle! You said that this dress was for those who had
no share (in the Hereafter); yet you have sent me this cloak." Allah's
Apostle said to him, "Sell it and fulfill your needs by it."
