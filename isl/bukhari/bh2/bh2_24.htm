<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:25</H3><P><I>Narrated  Aisha:</I></P>
(the wife of the Prophet) The people used to come from their abodes 
and from Al-'Awali (i.e. outskirts of Medina up to a distance of four 
miles or more from Medina). They used to pass through dust and used to
be drenched with sweat and covered with dust; so sweat used to trickle
from them. One of them came to Allah's Apostle who was in my house. 
The Prophet said to him, "I wish that you keep yourself clean on this 
day of yours (i.e. take a bath)."
