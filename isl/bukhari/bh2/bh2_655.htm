<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:653</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
(the wife of the Prophet) that Allah's Apostle said to her, "Do you 
know that when your people (Quraish) rebuilt the Ka'ba, they decreased
it from its original foundation laid by Abraham?" I said, "O Allah's 
Apostle! Why don't you rebuild it on its original foundation laid by 
Abraham?" He replied, "Were it not for the fact that your people are 
close to the pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently 
become Muslims) I would have done so." The sub-narrator, 'Abdullah 
(bin 'Umar ) stated: 'Aisha 'must have heard this from Allah's Apostle
for in my opinion Allah's Apostle had not placed his hand over the two
corners of the Ka'ba opposite Al-Hijr only because the Ka'ba was not 
rebuilt on its original foundations laid by Abraham.
