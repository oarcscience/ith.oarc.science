<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:18</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Umar:</I></P>
I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "All of you are Guardians." Yunis 
said: Ruzaiq bin Hukaim wrote to Ibn Shihab while I was with him at 
Wadi-al-Qura saying, "Shall I lead the Jumua prayer?" Ruzaiq was 
working on the land (i.e farming) and there was a group of Sudanese 
people and some others with him; Ruzaiq was then the Governor of Aila.
Ibn Shihab wrote (to Ruzaiq) ordering him to lead the Jumua prayer and
telling him that Salim told him that 'Abdullah bin 'Umar had said, "I 
heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'All of you are guardians and 
responsible for your wards and the things under your care. The Imam 
(i.e. ruler) is the guardian of his subjects and is responsible for 
them and a man is the guardian of his family and is responsible for 
them. A woman is the guardian of her husband's house and is 
responsible for it. A servant is the guardian of his master's 
belongings and is responsible for them.' I thought that he also said, 
'A man is the guardian of his father's property and is responsible for
it. All of you are guardians and responsible for your wards and the 
things under your care."
