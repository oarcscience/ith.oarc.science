<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:24</H3><P><I>Narrated Muhammad bin Sirin:</I></P>
On a rainy day Ibn  Abbas said to his Muadh-dhin, "After saying, 
'Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah' (I testify that Muhammad is 
Allah's Apostle), do not say 'Haiya 'Alas-Salat' (come for the prayer)
but say 'Pray in your houses'." (The man did so). But the people 
disliked it. Ibn Abbas said, "It was done by one who was much better 
than I (i.e. the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ). No doubt, the Jumua prayer is 
compulsory but I dislike to put you to task by bringing you out 
walking in mud and slush."
