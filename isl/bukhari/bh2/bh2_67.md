### Hadith 2:68

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) offered the Fajr prayer when it was still
dark, then he rode and said, 'Allah Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. When we
approach near to a nation, the most unfortunate is the morning of those
who have been warned." The people came out into the streets saying,
"Muhammad and his army." Allah's Apostle vanquished them by force and
their warriors were killed; the children and women were taken as
captives. Safiya was taken by Dihya Al-Kalbi and later she belonged to
Allah's Apostle go who married her and her Mahr was her manumission.
