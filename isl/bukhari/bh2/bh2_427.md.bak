### Hadith 2:426

*Narrated Anas:*

We were in the funeral procession of the daughter of Allah's Apostle and
Allah's Apostle was sitting near the grave and I saw his eyes full of
tears. He said, "Is there anyone amongst you who did not have sexual
relations with his wife last night?" Abu Talha replied in the
affirmative. And so Allah's Apostle told him to get down in her grave
and he got down in her grave and buried her.
