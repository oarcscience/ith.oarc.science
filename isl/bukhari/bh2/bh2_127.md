### Hadith 2:128

*Narrated Qatada:*

Anas I said, "While Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) was delivering the Friday
Khutba (sermon) a man came and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Rain is scarce;
please ask Allah to bless us with rain.' So he invoked Allah for it, and
it rained so much that we could hardly reach our homes and it continued
raining till the next Friday." Anas further said, "Then the same or some
other person stood up and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to
withhold the rain.' On that, Allah's Apostle I said, 'O Allah! Round
about us and not on us.' " Anas added, "I saw the clouds dispersing
right and left and it continued to rain but not over Medina."
