### Hadith 2:425

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

When the Prophet became ill, some of his wives talked about a church
which they had seen in Ethiopia and it was called Mariya. Um Salma and
Um Habiba had been to Ethiopia, and both of them narrated its (the
Church's) beauty and the pictures it contained. The Prophet raised his
head and said, "Those are the people who, whenever a pious man dies
amongst them, make a place of worship at his grave and then they make
those pictures in it. Those are the worst creatures in the Sight of
Allah."
