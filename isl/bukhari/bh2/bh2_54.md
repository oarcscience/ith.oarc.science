### Hadith 2:55

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Once in the lifetime of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) the people were afflicted
with drought (famine). While the Prophet was delivering the Khutba on a
Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said, "O, Allah's Apostle! Our
possessions are being destroyed and the children are hungry; Please
invoke Allah (for rain)". So the Prophet raised his hands. At that time
there was not a trace of cloud in the sky. By Him in Whose Hands my soul
is as soon as he lowered his hands, clouds gathered like mountains, and
before he got down from the pulpit, I saw the rain falling on the beard
of the Prophet. It rained that day, the next day, the third day, the
fourth day till the next Friday. The same Bedouin or another man stood
up and said, "O Allah's Apostle! The houses have collapsed, our
possessions and livestock have been drowned; Please invoke Allah (to
protect us)". So the Prophet I raised both his hands and said, "O Allah!
Round about us and not on us". So, in whatever direction he pointed with
his hands, the clouds dispersed and cleared away, and Medina's (sky)
became clear as a hole in between the clouds. The valley of Qanat
remained flooded, for one month, none came from outside but talked about
the abundant rain.
