### Hadith 2:216

*Narrated 'Imran bin Husain:*

(who had piles) I asked Allah's Apostle about the praying of a man while
sitting. He said, "If he prays while standing it is better and he who
prays while sitting gets half the reward of that who prays standing; and
whoever prays while Lying gets half the reward of that who prays while
sitting."
