<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:503</H3><P><I>Narrated Ma'n bin Yazid:</I></P>
My grandfather, my father and I gave the pledge of allegiance to 
Allah's Apostle. The Prophet got me engaged and then got me married. 
One day I went to the Prophet with a complaint. My father Yazid had 
taken some gold coins for charity and kept them with a man in the 
mosque (to give them to the poor) But I went and took them and brought
them to him (my father). My father said, "By Allah! I did not intend 
to give them to you. " I took (the case) to Allah's Apostle . On that 
Allah's Apostle said, "O Yazid! You will be rewarded for what you 
intended. O Man! Whatever you have taken is yours."
