### Hadith 2:191

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

The Prophet and his companions reached Mecca in the morning of the 4th
Dhul-Hijja reciting Talbiya (O Allah! We are obedient to your orders, we
respond 4 to your call) . . . intending to perform Hajj. The Prophet
ordered his companions to assume the lhram for Umra instead of Hajj,
excepting those who had Hadi (sacrifice) with them.
