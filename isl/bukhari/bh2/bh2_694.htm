<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:692</H3><P><I>Narrated Um Salama:</I></P>
(the wife of the Prophet) I informed Allah's Apostle (about my 
illness). (Through other sub-narrators, Um Salama narrated that when 
Allah's Apostle was at Mecca and had just decided to leave (Mecca) 
while she had not yet done Tawaf of the Kaba (and after listening to 
her). The Prophet said, "When the morning prayer is established, 
perform the Tawaf on your camel while the people are in prayer." So 
she did the same and did not offer the two Rakat of Tawaf until she 
came out of the Mosque.
