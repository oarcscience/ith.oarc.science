### Hadith 2:492

*Narrated Haritha bin Wahab :*

I heard the Prophet saying, "O people! Give in charity as a time will
come upon you when a person will wander about with his object of charity
and will not find anybody to accept it, and one (who will be requested
to take it) will say, "If you had brought it yesterday, would have taken
it, but to-day I am not in need of it."

will not be established ...](bh2_494.md)
