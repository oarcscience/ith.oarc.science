### Hadith 2:432

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

The Prophet said, "Allah has made Mecca a sanctuary (sacred place) and
it was a sanctuary before me and will be so after me. It was made legal
for me (to fight in it) for a few hours of the day. None is allowed to
uproot its thorny shrubs or to cut its trees or to chase its game or to
pick up its fallen things except by a person who announces it publicly."
On that Al-Abbas said (to the Prophet), "Except Al-Idhkhir for our
goldsmiths and for our graves." And so the Prophet added, "Except
Al-Idhkhir. " And Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said, "Except
Al-Idhkhir for our graves and houses." And Ibn Abbas said, "For their
goldsmiths and houses."
