### Hadith 2:99

*Narrated Al-Bara' bin 'Azib:*

On the day of Nahr Allah's Apostle delivered the Khutba after the 'Id
prayer and said, "Anyone who prayed like us and slaughtered the
sacrifice like we did then he acted according to our (Nusuk) tradition
of sacrificing, and whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer,
then that was just mutton (i.e. not sacrifice)." Abu Burda bin Naiyar
stood up and said, "O Allah's Apostle! By Allah, I slaughtered my
sacrifice before I offered the (Id) prayer and thought that today was
the day of eating and drinking (non-alcoholic drinks) and so I made
haste (in slaughtering) and ate and also fed my family and neighbors."
Allah's Apostle said, "That was just mutton (not a sacrifice)." Then Abu
Burda said, "I have a young she-goat and no doubt, it is better than two
sheep. Will that be sufficient as a sacrifice for me?" The Prophet
replied, "Yes. But it will not be sufficient for anyone else (as a
sacrifice), after you."
