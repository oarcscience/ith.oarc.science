### Hadith 2:743

*Narrated 'Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid*

I went out with 'Abdullah , to Mecca and when we proceeded to am' he
offered the two prayers (the Maghrib and the 'Isha') together, making
the Adhan and Iqama separately for each prayer. He took his supper in
between the two prayers. He offered the Fajr prayer as soon as the day
dawned. Some people said, "The day had dawned (at the time of the
prayer)," and others said, "The day had not dawned." 'Abdullah then
said, "Allah's Apostle said, 'These two prayers have been shifted from
their stated times at this place only (at Al-Muzdalifa); first: The
Maghrib and the 'Isha'. So the people should not arrive at Al-Muzdalifa
till the time of the 'Isha' prayer has become due. The second prayer is
the morning prayer which is offered at this hour.' " Then 'Abdullah
stayed there till it became a bit brighter. He then said, "If the chief
of the believers hastened onwards to Mina just now, then he had indeed
followed the Sunna." I do not know which proceeded the other, his
('Abdullah's) statement or the departure of 'Uthman . Abdullah was
reciting Talbiya till he threw pebbles at the Jamrat-al-'Aqaba on the
Day of Nahr (slaughtering) (that is the 10th of Dhul-Hijja).
