### Hadith 2:795

*Narrated 'Ikrima:*

Ibn Abbas said: "Allah's Apostle delivered a sermon on the Day of Nahr,
and said, 'O people! (Tell me) what is the day today?' The people
replied, 'It is the forbidden (sacred) day.' He asked again, 'What town
is this?' They replied, 'It is the forbidden (Sacred) town.' He asked,
'Which month is this?' They replied, 'It is the forbidden (Sacred)
month.' He said, 'No doubt! Your blood, your properties, and your honor
are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in
this (sacred) town (Mecca) of yours, in this month of yours.' The
Prophet repeated his statement again and again. After that he raised his
head and said, 'O Allah! Haven't conveyed (Your Message) to them'.
Haven't I conveyed Your Message to them?' " Ibn Abbas added, "By Him in
Whose Hand my soul is, the following was his will (Prophet's will) to
his followers:--It is incumbent upon those who are present to convey
this information to those who are absent Beware don't renegade (as)
disbelievers (turn into infidels) after me, Striking the necks (cutting
the throats) of one another.' "
