### Hadith 2:345

*Narrated Um 'Atiyya*

Allah's Apostle came to us and we were giving a bath to his (dead)
daughter and said, "Wash her three, five or more times with water and
Sidr and sprinkle camphor on her at the end; and when you finish, notify
me." So when we finished, we informed him and he gave us his waist-sheet
and told us to shroud her in it. Aiyub said that Hafsa narrated to him a
narration similar to that of Muhammad in which it was said that the bath
was to be given for an odd number of times, and the numbers 3, 5 or 7
were mentioned. It was also said that they were to start with the right
side and with the parts which were washed in ablution, and that Um
'Atiyya also mentioned, "We combed her hair and divided them in three
braids."
