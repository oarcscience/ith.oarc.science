### Hadith 2:798

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

At Mina, the Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Do you know what is the day
today?" The people replied, "Allah and His Apostle know it better." He
said, "It is the forbidden (sacred) day. And do you know what town is
this?" They replied, "Allah and His Apostle know it better." He said,
"This is the forbidden (Sacred) town (Mecca). And do you know which
month is this?" The people replied, "Allah and His Apostle know it
better." He said, "This is the forbidden (sacred) month." The Prophet
added, "No doubt, Allah made your blood, your properties, and your honor
sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours in Day of
Nahr (10th of Dhul-Hijja), the Prophet stood in between the Jamrat
during his Hajj which he performed (as in the previous Hadith) and said,
"This is the greatest Day (i.e. 10th of Dhul-Hijjah)." The Prophet
started saying repeatedly, "O Allah! Be Witness (I have conveyed Your
Message)." He then bade the people farewell. The people said, "This is
Hajjat-al-Wada)."
