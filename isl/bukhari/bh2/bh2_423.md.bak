### Hadith 2:422

*Narrated Anas:*

The Prophet said, "When a human being is laid in his grave and his
companions return and he even hears their foot steps, two angels come to
him and make him sit and ask him: What did you use to say about this
man, Muhammad ? He will say: I testify that he is Allah's slave and His
Apostle. Then it will be said to him, 'Look at your place in the
Hell-Fire. Allah has given you a place in Paradise instead of it.' " The
Prophet added, "The dead person will see both his places. But a
non-believer or a hypocrite will say to the angels, 'I do not know, but
I used to say what the people used to say! It will be said to him,
'Neither did you know nor did you take the guidance (by reciting the
Quran).' Then he will be hit with an iron hammer between his two ears,
and he will cry and that cry will be heard by whatever approaches him
except human beings and jinns."
