### Hadith 2:436

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

The Prophet collected every two martyrs of Uhud (in one grave) and then
he would ask, "Which of them knew the Quran more?" And if one of them
was pointed out for him as having more knowledge, he would put him first
in the Lahd. The Prophet said, "I will be a witness on these on the Day
of Resurrection." Then he ordered them to be buried with their blood on
their bodies and he did not have them washed.
