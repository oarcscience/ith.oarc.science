Allah's Apostle said, "There is no Zakat on less than five camels and 
also there is no Zakat on less than five Awaq (of silver). (5 Awaq = 
22 Fransa Riyals of Yamen or 200 Dirhams.) And there is no Zakat on 
less than five Awsuq. (A special measure of food-grains, and one Wasq 
equals 60 Sa's.) (For gold 20, Dinars i.e. equal to 12 Guinea English.
No Zakat for less than 12 Guinea (English) of gold or for silver less 
than 22 Fransa Riyals of Yamen.)
