### Hadith 2:807

*Narrated Salim:*

Ibn 'Umar used to do Rami of the Jamrat-ud-Dunya (the Jamra near to the
Khaif mosque) with seven small stones and used to recite Takbir on
throwing every pebble. He then would go ahead till he reached the level
ground where he would stand facing the Qibla for a long time to invoke
(Allah) while raising his hands (while invoking). Then he would do Rami
of the Jamrat-ul-Wusta (middle Jamra) and then he would go to the left
towards the middle ground, where he would stand facing the Qibla. He
would remain standing there for a long period to invoke (Allah) while
raising his hands, and would stand there for a long period. Then he
would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Aqaba from the middle of the valley, but
he would not stay by it, and then he would leave and say, "I saw the
Prophet doing like this."
