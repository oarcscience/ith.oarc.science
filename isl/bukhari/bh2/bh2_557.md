### Hadith 2:556

*Narrated Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) :*

Allah's Apostle distributed something (from the resources of Zakat)
amongst a group of people while I was sitting amongst them, but he left
a man whom I considered the best of the lot. So, I went up to Allah's
Apostle and asked him secretly, "Why have you left that person? By
Allah! I consider him a believer." The Prophet said, "Or merely a Muslim
(Who surrender to Allah)." I remained quiet for a while but could not
help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, "O
Allah's Apostle! Why have you left that person? By Allah! I consider him
a believer. " The Prophet said, "Or merely a Muslim." I remained quiet
for a while but could not help repeating my question because of what I
knew about him. I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Why have you left that
person? By Allah! I consider him a believer." The Prophet said, "Or
merely a Muslim." Then Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "I give to a
person while another is dearer to me, for fear that he may be thrown in
the Hell-fire on his face (by renegating from Islam)."
