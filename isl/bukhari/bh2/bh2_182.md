### Hadith 2:183

*Narrated Rabi'a:*

'Umar bin Al-Khattab recited Surat-an-Nahl on a Friday on the pulpit and
when he reached the verse of Sajda he got down from the pulpit and
prostrated and the people also prostrated. The next Friday 'Umar bin
Al-Khattab recited the same Sura and when he reached the verse of Sajda
he said, "O people! When we recite the verses of Sajda (during the
sermon) whoever prostrates does the right thing, yet it is no sin for
the one who does not prostrate." And 'Umar did not prostrate (that day).
Added Ibn 'Umar "Allah has not made the prostration of recitation
compulsory but if we wish we can do it."
