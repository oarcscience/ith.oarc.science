Allah's Apostle in his fatal illness said, "Allah cursed the Jews and 
the Christians, for they built the places of worship at the graves of 
their prophets." And if that had not been the case, then the Prophet's
grave would have been made prominent before the people. So (the 
Prophet ) was afraid, or the people were afraid that his grave might 
be taken as a place for worship.
