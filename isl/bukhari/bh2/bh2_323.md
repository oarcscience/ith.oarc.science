### Hadith 2:321

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet offered one of the evening prayers (the sub-narrator
Muhammad said, "I think that it was most probably the 'Asr prayer") and
he finished it after offering two Rakat only. He then stood near a price
of wood in front of the Mosque and put his hand over it. Abu Bakr and
'Umar were amongst those who were present, but they dared not talk to
him about that (because of excessive respect for him), and those who
were in a hurry went out. They said, "Has the prayer been reduced?" A
man who was called DhulYadain by the Prophet said (to the Prophet), "Has
the prayer been reduced or have you forgotten?" He said, "Neither have I
forgotten, nor has the prayer been reduced." He said, "Certainly you
have forgotten." So the Prophet offered two more Rakat and performed
Tashm and then said Takbir and performed a prostration of Sahu like his
ordinary prostration or a bit longer and then raised his head and said
Takbir and then put his head down and performed a prostration like his
ordinary prostration or a bit longer, and then raised his head and said
Takbir.
