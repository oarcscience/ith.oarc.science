### Hadith 2:447

*Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab :*

When 'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul died, Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) was
called upon to offer his funeral prayer. When Allah's Apostle stood up
to offer the prayer, I got up quickly and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Are
you going to pray for Ibn Ubai and he said so and so on such and such
occasions?" And started mentioning all that he had said. Allah's Apostle
smiled and said, "O 'Umar! Go away from me." When I talked too much he
said, "I have been given the choice and so I have chosen (to offer the
prayer). Had I known that he would be forgiven by asking for Allah's
forgiveness for more than seventy times, surely I would have done so."
('Umar added): Allah's Apostle offered his funeral prayer and returned
and after a short while the two verses of Surat Bara' were revealed:
i.e. "And never (O Muhammad) pray for any of them who dies . . . (to the
end of the verse) rebellion (9.84)" -- ('Umar added), "Later I
astonished at my daring before Allah's Apostle on that day. And Allah
and His Apostle know better."
