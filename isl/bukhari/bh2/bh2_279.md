### Hadith 2:278

*Narrated Marthad bin 'Abdullah Al-Yazani:*

I went to 'Uqba bin 'Amir Al-Juhani and said, "Is it not surprising that
Abi Tamim offers two Rakat before the Maghrib prayer?" 'Uqba said, "We
used to do so in the life-time of Allah's Apostle." I asked him, "What
prevents you from offering it now?" He replied, "Business."

Apostle and he also remembered a mouthful ...](bh2_280)
