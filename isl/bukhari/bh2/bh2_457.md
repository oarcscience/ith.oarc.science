### Hadith 2:456

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Allah's Apostle said, "When (Allah's) slave is put in his grave and his
companions return and he even hears their footsteps, two angels come to
him and make him sit and ask, 'What did you use to say about this man
(i.e. Muhammad)?' The faithful Believer will say, 'I testify that he is
Allah's slave and His Apostle.' Then they will say to him, 'Look at your
place in the Hell Fire; Allah has given you a place in Paradise instead
of it.' So he will see both his places." (Qatada said, "We were informed
that his grave would be made spacious." Then Qatada went back to the
narration of Anas who said;) Whereas a hypocrite or a non-believer will
be asked, "What did you use to say about this man." He will reply, "I do
not know; but I used to say what the people used to say." So they will
say to him, "Neither did you know nor did you take the guidance (by
reciting the Quran)." Then he will be hit with iron hammers once, that
he will send such a cry as everything near to him will hear, except
Jinns and human beings. (See Hadith No. 422).
