### Hadith 2:809

*Narrated 'Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Qasim:*

I heard my father who was the best man of his age, saying, "I heard
'Aisha saying, 'I perfumed Allah's Apostle with my own hands before
finishing his Ihram while yet he has not performed Tawaf-al-Ifada.' She
spread her hands (while saying so.)"

[Next: 2:810: Ibn Abbas: The people were ordered to perform the Tawaf of
the Ka'ba ...](bh2_812)
