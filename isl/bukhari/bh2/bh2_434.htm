<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:433</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle came to Abdullah bin Ubai (a hypocrite) after his 
death and he has been laid in his pit (grave). He ordered (that he be 
taken out of the grave) and he was taken out. Then he placed him on 
his knees and threw some of his saliva on him and clothed him in his 
(the Prophet's) own shirt. Allah knows better (why he did so). 
'Abdullah bin Ubai had given his shirt to Al-Abbas to wear. Abu Harun 
said, "Allah's Apostle at that time had two shirts and the son of 
'Abdullah bin Ubai said to him, 'O Allah's Apostle! Clothe my father 
in your shirt which has been in contact with your skin.' ' Sufyan 
added, "Thus people think that the Prophet clothed 'Abdullah bin Tubal
in his shirt in lieu of what he (Abdullah) had done (for Al Abbas, the
Prophet's uncle.)"
