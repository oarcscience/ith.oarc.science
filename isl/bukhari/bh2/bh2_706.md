### Hadith 2:704

*Narrated Nafi':*

Ibn 'Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year when Al-Hajjaj attacked
Ibn Az-Zubair. Somebody said to Ibn 'Umar, "There is a danger of an
impending war between them." Ibn 'Umar said, "Verily, in Allah's Apostle
you have a good example. (And if it happened as you say) then I would do
the same as Allah's Apostle had done. I make you witness that I have
decided to perform 'Umra." Then he set out and when he reached
Al-Baida', he said, "The ceremonies of both Hajj and 'Umra are similar.
I make you witness that I have made Hajj compulsory for me along with
'Umra." He drove (to Mecca) a Hadi which he had bought from (a place
called) Qudaid and did not do more than that. He did not slaughter the
Hadi or finish his Ihram, or shave or cut short his hair till the day of
slaughtering the sacrifices (10th Dhul-Hijja). Then he slaughtered his
Hadi and shaved his head and considered the first Tawaf (of Safa and
Marwa) as sufficient for Hajj and 'Umra. Ibn 'Umar said, "Allah's
Apostle did the same."
