### Hadith 2:390

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

We went with Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) to the blacksmith Abu Saif, and
he was the husband of the wet-nurse of Ibrahim (the son of the Prophet).
Allah's Apostle took Ibrahim and kissed him and smelled him and later we
entered Abu Saif's house and at that time Ibrahim was in his last
breaths, and the eyes of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) started shedding
tears. 'Abdur Rahman bin 'Auf said, "O Allah's Apostle, even you are
weeping!" He said, "O Ibn 'Auf, this is mercy." Then he wept more and
said, "The eyes are shedding tears and the heart is grieved, and we will
not say except what pleases our Lord, O Ibrahim ! Indeed we are grieved
by your separation."
