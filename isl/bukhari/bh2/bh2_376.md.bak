### Hadith 2:375

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Ubaidullah bin Abi Mulaika:*

One of the daughters of 'Uthman died at Mecca. We went to attend her
funeral procession. Ibn 'Umar and Ibn Abbas were also present. I sat in
between them (or said, I sat beside one of them. Then a man came and sat
beside me.) 'Abdullah bin 'Umar said to 'Amr bin 'Uthman, "Will you not
prohibit crying as Allah's Apostle has said, 'The dead person is
tortured by the crying of his relatives.?" Ibn Abbas said, "Umar used to
say so." Then he added narrating, "I accompanied Umar on a journey from
Mecca till we reached Al-Baida. There he saw some travelers in the shade
of a Samura (A kind of forest tree). He said (to me), "Go and see who
those travelers are." So I went and saw that one of them was Suhaib. I
told this to 'Umar who then asked me to call him. So I went back to
Suhaib and said to him, "Depart and follow the chief of the faithful
believers." Later, when 'Umar was stabbed, Suhaib came in weeping and
saying, "O my brother, O my friend!" (on this 'Umar said to him, "O
Suhaib! Are you weeping for me while the Prophet said, "The dead person
is punished by some of the weeping of his relatives?" Ibn Abbas added,
"When 'Umar died I told all this to Aisha and she said, 'May Allah be
merciful to Umar. By Allah, Allah's Apostle did not say that a believer
is punished by the weeping of his relatives. But he said, Allah
increases the punishment of a non-believer because of the weeping of his
relatives." Aisha further added, "The Quran is sufficient for you (to
clear up this point) as Allah has stated: 'No burdened soul will bear
another's burden.' " (35.18). Ibn Abbas then said, "Only Allah makes one
laugh or cry." Ibn Umar did not say anything after that.
