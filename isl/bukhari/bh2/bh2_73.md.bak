### Hadith 2:74

*Narrated Anas:*

The Prophet said, "Whoever slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the 'Id
prayer, should slaughter again." A man stood up and said, "This is the
day on which one has desire for meat," and he mentioned something about
his neighbors. It seemed that the Prophet I believed him. Then the same
man added, "I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than the meat
of two sheep." The Prophet permitted him to slaughter it as a sacrifice.
I do not know whether that permission was valid only for him or for
others as well.
