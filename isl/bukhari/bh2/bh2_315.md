### Hadith 2:313

*Narrated Abu Huraira,*

Allah's Apostle said, "When the Adhan for the prayer is pronounced, then
Satan takes to his heels passing wind so that he may not hear the Adhan
and when the Muadh-dhin finishes, he comes back; and when the Iqama is
pronounced he again takes to his heels and when it is finished, he again
comes back and continues reminding the praying person of things that he
used not to remember when not in prayer till he forgets how much he has
prayed." Abu Salama bin 'Abdur-Rahman said, "If anyone of you has such a
thing (forgetting the number of Rakat he has prayed) he should perform
two prostrations of Sahu (i.e. forgetfulness) while sitting." Abu Salama
narrates this from Abu Huraira.
