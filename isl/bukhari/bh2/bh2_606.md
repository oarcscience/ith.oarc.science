### Hadith 2:604

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

The Prophet fixed Dhul-Hulaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina,
Al-Juhfa, for the people of Sham, Yalamlam for the people of Yemen, and
Qarn for the people of Najd. And these Mawaqlt are for those living at
those very places, and besides them for those who come through those
places with the intention of performing Hajj and Umra; and whoever is
living inside these places can assume lhram from his own dwelling place,
and the people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca.
