The Prophet "Whoever gets up at night and says: -- 'La ilaha il-lallah
Wahdahu la Sharika lahu Lahu-l-mulk, waLahu-l-hamd wahuwa 'ala 
kullishai'in Qadir. Alhamdu lil-lahi wa subhanal-lahi wa la-ilaha 
il-lal-lah wa-l-lahu akbar wa la hawla Wala Quwata il-la-bil-lah.' 
(None has the right to be worshipped but Allah. He is the Only One and
has no partners . For Him is the Kingdom and all the praises are due 
for Him. He is Omnipotent. All the praises are for Allah. All the 
glories are for Allah. And none has the right to be worshipped but 
Allah, And Allah is Great And there is neither Might nor Power Except 
with Allah). And then says: -- Allahumma, Ighfir li(O Allah! Forgive 
me). Or invokes (Allah), he will be responded to and if he performs 
ablution (and prays), his prayer will be accepted."
