### Hadith 2:167

*Narrated Abu Musa:*

The sun eclipsed and the Prophet got up, being afraid that it might be
the Hour (i.e. Day of Judgment). He went to the Mosque and offered the
prayer with the longest Qiyam, bowing and prostration that I had ever
seen him doing. Then he said, "These signs which Allah sends do not
occur because of the life or death of somebody, but Allah makes His
worshipers afraid by them. So when you see anything thereof, proceed to
remember Allah, invoke Him and ask for His forgiveness."
