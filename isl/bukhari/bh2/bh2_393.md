### Hadith 2:392

*Narrated Aisha:*

When the news of the martyrdom of Zaid bin Haritha, Ja'far and 'Abdullah
bin Rawaha came, the Prophet sat down looking sad, and I was looking
through the chink of the door. A man came and said, "O Allah's Apostle!
The women of Ja'far," and then he mentioned their crying . The Prophet
(p.b.u.h) ordered h im to stop them from crying. The man went and came
back and said, "I tried to stop them but they disobeyed." The Prophet
(p.b.u.h) ordered him for the second time to forbid them. He went again
and came back and said, "They did not listen to me, (or "us": the
sub-narrator Muhammad bin Haushab is in doubt as to which is right). "
('Aisha added: The Prophet said, "Put dust in their mouths." I said (to
that man), "May Allah stick your nose in the dust (i.e. humiliate you)."
By Allah, you could not (stop the women from crying) to fulfill the
order, besides you did not relieve Allah's Apostle from fatigue."
