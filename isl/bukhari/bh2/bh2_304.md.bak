### Hadith 2:302

*Narrated Al-Azraq bin Qais:*

We were at Al-Ahwaz fighting the AlHaruriya (tribe). While I was at the
bank of a river a man was praying and the reins of his animal were in
his hands and the animal was struggling and he was following the animal.
(Shu'ba, a sub-narrator, said that man was Abu Barza al-Aslaml). A man
from the Khawarij said, "O Allah! Be harsh to this sheik." And when the
sheik (Abu Barza) finished his prayer, he said, "I heard your remark. No
doubt, I participated with Allah's Apostle in six or seven or eight holy
battles and saw his leniency, and no doubt, I would rather retain my
animal than let it return to its stable, as it would cause me much
trouble. "
