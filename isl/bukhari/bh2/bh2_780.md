*Narrated 'Amra:*

I heard 'Aisha saying, "We set out (from Medina) along with Allah's
Apostle five days before the end of Dhul-Qa'da with the intention of
performing Hajj only. When we approached Mecca, Allah's Apostle ordered
those who had no Hadi along with them to finish the lhram after

brought to us on the Day of Nahr and I said, 'What is this?' Somebody
said, 'The Prophet has slaughtered (cows) on behalf of his wives.' "
