### Hadith 2:519

*Narrated Abu Musa :*

The Prophet said, "An honest Muslim store-keeper who carries out the
orders of his master and pays fully what he has been ordered to give
with a good heart and pays to that person to whom he was ordered to pay,
is regarded as one of the two charitable persons."
