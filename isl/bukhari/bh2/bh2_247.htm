<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:248</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Salma bin 'Abdur Rahman:</I></P>
I asked 'Aisha, "How is the prayer of Allah's Apostle during the month
of Ramadan." She said, "Allah's Apostle never exceeded eleven Rakat in
Ramadan or in other months; he used to offer four Rakat-- do not ask 
me about their beauty and length, then four Rakat, do not ask me about
their beauty and length, and then three Rakat." Aisha further said, "I
said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Do you sleep before offering the Witr 
prayer?' He replied, 'O 'Aisha! My eyes sleep but my heart remains 
awake'!"
