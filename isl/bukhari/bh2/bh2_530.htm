<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:529</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Abbas :</I></P>
I am a witness that Allah's Apostle offered the Id prayer before 
delivering the sermon and then he thought that the women would not be 
able to hear him (because of the distance), so he went to them along 
with Bilal who was spreading his garment. The Prophet advised and 
ordered them to give in charity. So the women started giving their 
ornaments (in charity). (The sub-narrator Aiyub pointed towards his 
ears and neck meaning that they gave ornaments from those places such 
as ear-rings and necklaces.)
