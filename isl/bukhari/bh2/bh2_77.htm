'Ata' said, "Jabir bin 'Abdullah said, 'The Prophet went out on the 
Day of 'Id-ul-Fitr and offered the prayer before delivering the 
Khutba, Ata told me that during the early days of IbnAz-Zubair, Ibn  
Abbas had sent a message to him telling him that the Adhan for the 'Id
Prayer was never pronounced (in the life time of Allah's Apostle) and 
the Khutba used to be delivered after the prayer. Ata told me that Ibn
Abbas and Jabir bin 'Abdullah, had said,  - where was no Adhan for 
the prayer of '7d-ul-Fitr and 'Id-ul-Aqha." 'At a' said, "I heard 
Jabir bin 'Abdullah saying, 'The Prophet stood up and started with the
prayer, and after it he delivered the Khutba. When the Prophet of 
Allah (p.b.u.h) finished (the Khutba), he went to the women and 
preached to them, while he was leaning on Bilal's hand. Bilal was 
spreading his garment and the ladies were putting alms in it.' " I 
said to Ata, "Do you think it incumbent upon an Imam to go to the 
women and preach to them after finishing the prayer and Khutba?" 'Ata'
said, "No doubt it is incumbent on Imams to do so, and why should they
not do so?"
