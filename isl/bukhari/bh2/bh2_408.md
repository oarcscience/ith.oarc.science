### Hadith 2:407

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

Allah's Apostle passed by a grave of a deceased who had been buried at
night. He said, "When was this (deceased) buried?" The people said,
"Yesterday." He said, "Why did you not inform me?" They said, "We buried
him when it was dark and so we disliked to wake you up." He stood up and
we lined up behind him. (Ibn Abbas said): I was one of them, and the
Prophet offered the funeral prayer.
