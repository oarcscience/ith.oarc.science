<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:323</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "When the call for prayer is made, Satan takes 
to his heels passing wind so that he may not hear the Adhan and when 
the call is finished he comes back, and when the Iqama is pronounced, 
Satan again takes to his heels, and when the Iqama is finished he 
comes back again and tries to interfere with the person and his 
thoughts and say, "Remember this and that (which he has not thought of
before the prayer)", till the praying person forgets how much he has 
prayed. If anyone of you does not remember whether he has offered 
three or four Rakat then he should perform two prostrations of Sahu 
while sitting.
