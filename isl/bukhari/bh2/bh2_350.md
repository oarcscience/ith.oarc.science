Um 'Atiyya said, "One of the daughters of the Prophet died and he came
out and said, 'Wash her three or five times or more, if you think it
necessary, with water and Sidr, and last of all put camphor (or some
camphor) and when you finish, inform me.' " Um Atiyya added, "When we

'Shroud her in it.' " And Um 'Atiyya (in another narration) added, "The
Prophet said, 'Wash her three, five or seven times or more, if you think
it necessary.' " Hafsa said that Um 'Atiyya had also said, "We entwined
