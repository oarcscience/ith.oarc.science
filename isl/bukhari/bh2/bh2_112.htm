<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:113</H3><P><I>Narrated Said bin Yasar:</I></P>
I was going to Mecca in the company of 'Abdullah bin 'Umar and when I 
apprehended the approaching dawn, I dismounted and offered the Witr 
prayer and then joined him. 'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, "Where have you 
been?" I replied, "I apprehended the approaching dawn so I dismounted 
and prayed the Witr prayer." 'Abdullah said, "Isn't it sufficient for 
you to follow the good example of Allah's Apostle?" I replied, "Yes, 
by Allah." He said, "Allah's Apostle used to pray Witr on the back of 
the camel (while on a journey)."
