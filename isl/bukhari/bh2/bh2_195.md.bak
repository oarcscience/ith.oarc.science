### Hadith 2:196

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

"When the prayers were first enjoined they were of two Rakat each. Later
the prayer in a journey was kept as it was but the prayers for
non-travellers were completed." Az-Zuhri said, "I asked 'Urwa what made
Aisha pray the full prayers (in journey)." He replied, "She did the same
as 'Uthman did."
