### Hadith 2:154

*Narrated 'Aisha :*

In the life-time of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed, so he
led the people in prayer, and stood up and performed a long Qiyam, then
bowed for a long while. He stood up again and performed a long Qiyam but
this time the period of standing was shorter than the first. He bowed
again for a long time but shorter than the first one, then he prostrated
and prolonged the prostration. He did the same in the second Raka as he
did in the first and then finished the prayer; by then the sun (eclipse)
had cleared. He delivered the Khutba (sermon) and after praising and
glorifying Allah he said, "The sun and the moon are two signs against
the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse on the death or life of anyone.
So when you see the eclipse, remember Allah and say Takbir, pray and
give Sadaqa." The Prophet then said, "O followers of Muhammad! By Allah!
There is none who has more ghaira (self-respect) than Allah as He has
forbidden that His slaves, male or female commit adultery (illegal
sexual intercourse). O followers of Muhammad! By Allah! If you knew that
which I know you would laugh little and weep much.
