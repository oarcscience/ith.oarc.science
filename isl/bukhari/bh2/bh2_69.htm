<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:70</H3><P><I>Narrated  Aisha:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) came to my house while two girls were 
singing beside me the songs of Buath (a story about the war between 
the two tribes of the Ansar, the Khazraj and the Aus, before Islam). 
The Prophet (p.b.u.h) lay down and turned his face to the other side. 
Then Abu Bakr came and spoke to me harshly saying, "Musical 
instruments of Satan near the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ?" Allah's Apostle 
(p.b.u.h) turned his face towards him and said, "Leave them." When Abu
Bakr became inattentive, I signalled to those girls to go out and they
left. It was the day of 'Id, and the Black people were playing with 
shields and spears; so either I requested the Prophet (p.b.u.h) or he 
asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the 
affirmative. Then the Prophet (p.b.u.h) made me stand behind him and 
my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, "Carry on! O Bani 
Arfida," till I got tired. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked me, "Are you 
satisfied (Is that sufficient for you)?" I replied in the affirmative 
and he told me to leave.
