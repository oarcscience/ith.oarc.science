### Hadith 2:703

*Narrated Nafi':*

'Abdullah bin 'Abdullah bin 'Umar and his riding animal entered the
house of Ibn 'Umar. He (the son of Ibn 'Umar) said, "I fear that this
year a battle might take place between the people and you might be
prevented from going to the Ka'ba. I suggest that you should stay here."
Ibn Umar said, "Once Allah's Apostle set out for the pilgrimage, and the
pagans of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka'ba. So, if the
people intervened between me and the Ka'ba, I would do the same as
Allah's Apostle had done . . . "Verily, in Allah's Apostle you have a
good example." Then he added, "I make you a witness that I have intended
to perform Hajj along with 'Umra." After arriving at Mecca, Ibn 'Umar
performed one Tawaf only (between Safa and Marwa).
