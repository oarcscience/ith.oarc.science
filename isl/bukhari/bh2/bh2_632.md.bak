### Hadith 2:630

*Narrated Abu Musa:*

The Prophet sent me to some people in Yemen and when I returned, I found
him at Al-Batha. He asked me, "With what intention have you assumed
Ihram (i.e. for Hajj or for Umra or for both?") I replied, "I have
assumed Ihram with an intention like that of the Prophet." He asked,
"Have you a Hadi with you?" I replied in the negative. He ordered me to
perform Tawaf round the Ka'ba and between Safa and Marwa and then to
finish my Ihram. I did so and went to a woman from my tribe who combed
my hair or washed my head. Then, when Umar came (i.e. became Caliph) he
said, "If we follow Allah's Book, it orders us to complete Hajj and
Umra; as Allah says: "Perform the Hajj and Umra for Allah." (2.196). And
if we follow the tradition of the Prophet who did not finish his Ihram
till he sacrificed his Hadi."
