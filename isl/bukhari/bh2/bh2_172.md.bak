### Hadith 2:173

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Masud :*

The Prophet recited Suratan-Najm (103) at Mecca and prostrated while
reciting it and those who were with him did the same except an old man
who took a handful of small stones or earth and lifted it to his
forehead and said, "This is sufficient for me." Later on, I saw him
killed as a non-believer.
