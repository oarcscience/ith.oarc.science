### Hadith 2:303

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

Once the sun eclipsed and Allah's Apostle stood up for the prayer and
recited a very long Sura and when bowed for a long while and then raised
his head and started reciting another Sura. Then he bowed, and after
finishing, he prostrated and did the same in the second Raka and then
said, "These (lunar and solar eclipses) are two of the signs of Allah
and if you see them, pray till the eclipse is over. No doubt, while
standing at this place I saw everything promised to me by Allah and I
saw (Paradise) and I wanted to pluck a bunch (of grapes) therefrom, at
the time when you saw me stepping forward. No doubt, I saw Hell with its
different parts destroying each other when you saw me retreating and in
it I saw 'Amr bin Luhai who started the tradition of freeing animals
(set them free) in the name of idols."
