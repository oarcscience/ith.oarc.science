<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:134</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle I was delivering the Khutba (sermon) on a Friday when 
the people stood up, shouted and said, "O Allah's Apostle! There is no
rain (drought), the trees have dried and the livestock are destroyed; 
Please pray to Allah for rain." So Allah's Apostle said twice, "O 
Allah! Bless us with rain." By Allah, there was no trace of cloud in 
the sky and suddenly the sky became overcast with clouds and it 
started raining. The Prophet came down the pulpit and offered the 
prayer. When he came back from the prayer (to his house) it was 
raining and it rained continuously till the next Friday. When the 
Prophet  started delivering the Friday Khutba (sermon), the people 
started shouting and said to him, "The houses have collapsed and the 
roads are cut off; so please pray to Allah to withhold the rain." So 
the Prophet smiled and said, "O Allah! Round about us and not on us." 
So the sky became clear over Medina but it kept on raining over the 
outskirts (of Medina) and not a single drop of rain fell over Median. 
I looked towards the sky which was as bright and clear as a crown.
