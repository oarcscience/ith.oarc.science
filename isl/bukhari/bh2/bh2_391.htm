<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:390</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
We went with Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) to the blacksmith Abu Saif, and
he was the husband of the wet-nurse of Ibrahim (the son of the 
Prophet). Allah's Apostle took Ibrahim and kissed him and smelled him 
and later we entered Abu Saif's house and at that time Ibrahim was in 
his last breaths, and the eyes of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) started 
shedding tears. 'Abdur Rahman bin 'Auf said, "O Allah's Apostle, even 
you are weeping!" He said, "O Ibn 'Auf, this is mercy." Then he wept 
more and said, "The eyes are shedding tears and the heart is grieved, 
and we will not say except what pleases our Lord, O Ibrahim ! Indeed 
we are grieved by your separation."
