### Hadith 2:386

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

When the Prophet got the news of the death of Ibn Haritha, Ja'far and
Ibn Rawaha he sat down and looked sad and I was looking at him through
the chink of the door. A man came and told him about the crying of the
women of Ja'far. The Prophet ordered him to forbid them. The man went
and came back saying that he had told them but they did not listen to
him. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Forbid them." So again he went and
came back for the third time and said, "O Allah's Apostle! By Allah,
they did not listen to us at all." ('Aisha added): Allah's Apostle
ordered him to go and put dust in their mouths. I said, (to that man)
"May Allah stick your nose in the dust (i.e. humiliate you)! You could
neither (persuade the women to) fulfill the order of Allah's Apostle nor
did you relieve Allah's Apostle from fatigue. "
