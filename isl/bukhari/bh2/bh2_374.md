### Hadith 2:373

*Narrated Usama bin Zaid:*

The daughter of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) sent (a messenger) to the Prophet
requesting him to come as her child was dying (or was gasping), but the
Prophet returned the messenger and told him to convey his greeting to
her and say: "Whatever Allah takes is for Him and whatever He gives, is
for Him, and everything with Him has a limited fixed term (in this
world) and so she should be patient and hope for Allah's reward." She
again sent for him, swearing that he should come. The Prophet got up,
and so did Sad bin 'Ubada, Muadh bin Jabal, Ubai bin Ka'b, Zaid bin
Thabit and some other men. The child was brought to Allah's Apostle
while his breath was disturbed in his chest (the sub-narrator thinks
that Usama added: ) as if it was a leather water-skin. On that the eyes
of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) started shedding tears. Sad said, "O Allah's
Apostle! What is this?" He replied, "It is mercy which Allah has lodged
in the hearts of His slaves, and Allah is merciful only to those of His
slaves who are merciful (to others).
