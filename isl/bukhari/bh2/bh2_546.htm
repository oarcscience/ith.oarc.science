Zainab, the wife of 'Abdullah said, "I was in the Mosque and saw the 
Prophet (p.b.u.h) saying, 'O women ! Give alms even from your 
ornaments.' " Zainab used to provide for 'Abdullah and those orphans 
who were under her protection. So she said to 'Abdullah, "Will you ask
Allah's Apostle whether it will be sufficient for me to spend part of 
the Zakat on you and the orphans who are under my protection?" He 
replied "Will you yourself ask Allah's Apostle ?" (Zainab added): So I
went to the Prophet and I saw there an Ansari woman who was standing 
at the door (of the Prophet ) with a similar problem as mine. Bilal 
passed by us and we asked him, 'Ask the Prophet whether it is 
permissible for me to spend (the Zakat) on my husband and the orphans 
under my protection.' And we requested Bilal not to inform the Prophet
about us. So Bilal went inside and asked the Prophet regarding our 
problem. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked, "Who are those two?" Bilal 
replied that she was Zainab. The Prophet said, "Which Zainab?" Bilal 
said, "The wife of 'Adullah (bin Masud)." The Prophet said, "Yes, (it 
is sufficient for her) and she will receive a double rewards (for 
that): One for helping relatives, and the other for giving Zakat."
