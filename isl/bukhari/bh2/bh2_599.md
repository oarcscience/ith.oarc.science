### Hadith 2:597

*Narrated Zaid bin Jubair:*

I went to visit 'Abdullah bin 'Umar at his house which contained many
tents made of cotton cloth and these were encircled with Suradik (part
of the tent). I asked him from where, should one assume Ihram for Umra.
He said, "Allah's Apostle had fixed as Miqat (singular of Mawaqit) Qarn
for the people of Najd, Dhul-Hulaifa for the people of Medina, and
Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham."
