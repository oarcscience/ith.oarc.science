### Hadith 2:36

*Narrated As-Saib bin Yazid:*

The person who increased the number of Adhans for the Jumua prayers to
three was Uthman bin Affan and it was when the number of the (Muslim)
people of Medina had increased. In the life-time of the Prophet I there
was only one Muadh-dhin and the Adhan used to be pronounced only after
the Imam had taken his seat (i.e. on the pulpit).

[Next: 2:37: Abu Umama bin Sahl bin Hunaif: I heard Muawiya bin Abi
Sufyan (repeating the statements of the Adhan)...](bh2_36.md)
