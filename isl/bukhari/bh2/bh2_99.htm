<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:100</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle .~ offered the prayer on the day of Nahr and then 
delivered the Khutba and ordered that whoever had slaughtered his 
sacrifice before the prayer should repeat it, that is, should 
slaughter another sacrifice. Then a person from the Ansar stood up and
said, "O Allah's Apostle! because of my neighbors (he described them 
as being very needy or poor) I slaughtered before the prayer. I have a
young she-goat which, in my opinion, is better than two sheep." The 
Prophet gave him the permission for slaughtering it as a sacrifice.
