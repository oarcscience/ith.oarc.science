<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:422</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "When a human being is laid in his grave and his 
companions return and he even hears their foot steps, two angels come 
to him and make him sit and ask him: What did you use to say about 
this man, Muhammad ? He will say: I testify that he is Allah's slave 
and His Apostle. Then it will be said to him, 'Look at your place in 
the Hell-Fire. Allah has given you a place in Paradise instead of it.'
" The Prophet added, "The dead person will see both his places. But a 
non-believer or a hypocrite will say to the angels, 'I do not know, 
but I used to say what the people used to say! It will be said to him,
'Neither did you know nor did you take the guidance (by reciting the 
Quran).' Then he will be hit with an iron hammer between his two ears,
and he will cry and that cry will be heard by whatever approaches him 
except human beings and jinns."
