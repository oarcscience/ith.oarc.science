### Hadith 2:92

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

I (in my boyhood) went out with the Prophet on the day of 'Id ul Fitr or
Id-ul-Adha. The Prophet prayed and then delivered the Khutba and then
went towards the women, preached and advised them and ordered them to
give alms.

[Next: 2:93: Al-Bara': The Prophet went towards Al-Baqi (the grave-yard
at Medina) on the day...](bh2_92)
