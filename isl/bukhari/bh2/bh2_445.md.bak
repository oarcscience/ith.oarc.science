### Hadith 2:444

*Narrated 'Ali:*

" We were accompanying a funeral procession in Baqi-I-Gharqad. The
Prophet came to us and sat and we sat around him. He had a small stick
in his hand then he bent his head and started scraping the ground with
it. He then said, "There is none among you, and not a created soul, but
has place either in Paradise or in Hell assigned for him and it is also
determined for him whether he will be among the blessed or wretched." A
man said, "O Allah's Apostle! Should we not depend on what has been
written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will
do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst us will be
wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?" The Prophet said,
"The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made
easy for the wretched." Then he recited the Verses:-- "As for him who
gives (in charity) and is Allah-fearing And believes in the Best reward
from Allah. " (92.5-6)
