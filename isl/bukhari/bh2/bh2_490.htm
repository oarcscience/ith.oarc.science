While I was sitting with some people from Quraish, a man with very 
rough hair, clothes, and appearance came and stood in front of us, 
greeted us and said, "Inform those who hoard wealth, that a stone will
be heated in the Hell-fire and will be put on the nipples of their 
breasts till it comes out from the bones of their shoulders and then 
put on the bones of their shoulders till it comes through the nipples 
of their breasts the stone will be moving and hitting." After saying 
that, the person retreated and sat by the side of the pillar, I 
followed him and sat beside him, and I did not know who he was. I said
to him, "I think the people disliked what you had said." He said, 
"These people do not understand anything, although my friend told me."
I asked, "Who is your friend?" He said, "The Prophet said (to me), 'O 
Abu Dhar! Do you see the mountain of Uhud?' And on that I (Abu Dhar) 
started looking towards the sun to judge how much remained of the day 
as I thought that Allah's Apostle wanted to send me to do something 
for him and I said, 'Yes!' He said, 'I do not love to have gold equal 
to the mountain of Uhud unless I spend it all (in Allah's cause) 
except three Dinars (pounds). These people do not understand and 
collect worldly wealth. No, by Allah, Neither I ask them for worldly 
benefits nor am I in need of their religious advice till I meet Allah,
The Honorable, The Majestic." '
