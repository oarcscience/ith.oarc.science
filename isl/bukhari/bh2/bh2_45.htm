<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:46</H3><P><I>Narrated Aisha:</I></P>
Once in the middle of the night Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) went out and
prayed in the mosque and some men prayed with him. The next morning 
the people spoke about it and so more people gathered and prayed with 
him (in the second night). They circulated the news in the morning, 
and so, on the third night the number of people increased greatly. 
Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) came out and they prayed behind him. On the 
fourth night the mosque was overwhelmed by the people till it could 
not accommodate them. Allah's Apostle came out only for the Fajr 
prayer and when he finished the prayer, he faced the people and 
recited "Tashah-hud" (I testify that none has the right to be 
worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle), and then said,
"Amma ba'du. Verily your presence (in the mosque at night) was not 
hidden from me, but I was afraid that this prayer (Prayer of Tahajjud)
might be made compulsory and you might not be able to carry it out."
