### Hadith 2:789

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

We performed Hajj with the Prophet and performed Tawaf-al-ifada on the
Day of Nahr (slaughtering). Safiya got her menses and the Prophets
desired from her what a husband desires from his wife. I said to him, "O
Allah's Apostle! She is having her menses." He said, "Is she going to
detain us?" We informed him that she had performed Tawaf-al-Ifada on the
Day of Nahr. He said, "(Then you can) depart."

shaving (of the head), ...](bh2_792)
