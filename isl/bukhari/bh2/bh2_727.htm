My father said, "(Before Islam) I was looking for my camel .." The 
same narration is told by a different sub-narrator. Jubair bin Mut'im 
said, "My camel was lost and I went out in search of it on the day of

were called so, as they used to say, 'We are the people of Allah we 
shall not go out of the sanctuary). What has brought him here?"
