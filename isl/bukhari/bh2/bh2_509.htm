<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:508</H3><P><I>Narrated Hakim bin Hizam</I></P>
The Prophet said, "The upper hand is better than the lower hand (i.e. 
he who gives in charity is better than him who takes it). One should 
start giving first to his dependents. And the best object of charity 
is that which is given by a wealthy person (from the money which is 
left after his expenses). And whoever abstains from asking others for 
some financial help, Allah will give him and save him from asking 
others, Allah will make him self-sufficient."
