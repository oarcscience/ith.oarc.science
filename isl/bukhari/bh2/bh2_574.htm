<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:573</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Ma'bad,:</I></P>
(the slave of Ibn Abbas) Allah's Apostle said to Muadh when he sent 
him to Yemen, "You will go to the people of the Scripture. So, when 
you reach there, invite them to testify that none has the right to be 
worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle. And if they 
obey you in that, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them five 
prayers in each day and night. And if they obey you in that tell them 
that Allah has made it obligatory on them to pay the Zakat which will 
be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor among them. If
they obey you in that, then avoid taking the best of their 
possessions, and be afraid of the curse of an oppressed person because
there is no screen between his invocation and Allah."
