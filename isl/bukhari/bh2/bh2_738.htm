<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:736</H3><P><I>Narrated Salim:</I></P>
'Abdullah bin 'Umar used to send the weak among his family early to 
Mina. So they used to depart from Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram (that is 
Al-Muzdalifa) at night (when the moon had set) and invoke Allah as 
much as they could, and then they would return (to Mina) before the 
Imam had started from Al-Muzdalifa to Mina. So some of them would 
reach Mina at the time of the Fajr prayer and some of them would come 
later. When they reached Mina they would throw pebbles on the Jamra 
(Jamrat-al-Aqaba) Ibn 'Umar used to say, "Allah's Apostle gave the 
permission to them (weak people) to do so."
