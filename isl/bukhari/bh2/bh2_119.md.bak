### Hadith 2:120

*Narrated Abu Huraira;*

Whenever the Prophet (p.b.u.h) lifted his head from the bowing in the
last Raka he used to say: "O Allah! Save 'Aiyash bin Abi Rabi'a. O
Allah! Save Salama bin Hisham. O Allah! Save Walid bin Walid. O Allah!
Save the weak faithful believers. O Allah! Be hard on the tribes of
Mudar and send (famine) years on them like the famine years of (Prophet)
Joseph ." The Prophet further said, "Allah forgive the tribes of Ghifar
and save the tribes of Aslam." Abu Az-Zinad (a sub-narrator) said, "The
Qunut used to be recited by the Prophet in the Fajr prayer."
