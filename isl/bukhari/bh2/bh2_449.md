### Hadith 2:448

*Narrated Anas bin Malik, :*

A funeral procession passed and the people praised the deceased. The
Prophet said, "It has been affirmed to him." Then another funeral
procession passed and the people spoke badly of the deceased. The
Prophet said, "It has been affirmed to him". 'Umar bin Al-Khattab asked
(Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) ), "What has been affirmed?" He replied, "You
praised this, so Paradise has been affirmed to him; and you spoke badly
of this, so Hell has been affirmed to him. You people are Allah's
witnesses on earth."
