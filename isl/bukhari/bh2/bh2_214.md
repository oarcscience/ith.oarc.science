### Hadith 2:215

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) fell down from a horse and his right side was
either injured or scratched, so we went to inquire about his health. The
time for the prayer became due and he offered the prayer while sitting
and we prayed while standing. He said, "The Imam is to be followed; so
if he says Takbir, you should also say Takbir, and if he bows you should
also bow; and when he lifts his head you should also do the same and if
he says: Sami'a-l-lahu Liman Hamidah (Allah hears whoever sends his
praises to Him) you should say: Rabbana walakal-Hamd (O our Lord! All
the praises are for You.") (See Hadith No. 656 Vol. 1).
