<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:351</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Sirin:</I></P>
Um 'Atiyya (an Ansari woman who gave the pledge of allegiance to the 
Prophet ) came to Basra to visit her son, but she could not find him. 
She narrated to us, "The Prophet came to us while we were giving bath 
to his (dead) daughter, he said: 'Wash her three times, five times or 
more, if you think it necessary, with water and Sidr, and last of all 
put camphor, and when you finish, notify me.' " Um 'Atiyya added, 
"After finishing, we informed him and he gave us his waist sheet and 
told us to shroud her in it and did not say more than that."
