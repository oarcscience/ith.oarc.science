<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:318</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet led us in the 'Asr or the Zuhr prayer and finished it with
Taslim. Dhul-Yadain said to him, "O Allah's Apostle! Has the prayer 
been reduced?" The Prophet asked his companions in the affirmative. So
Allah's Apostle I offered two more Rakat and then performed two 
prostrations (of Sahu). Sad said, "I saw that 'Ursa bin Az-Zubair had 
offered two Rakat in the Maghrib prayer and finished it with Taslim. 
He then talked (and when he was informed about it) he completed the 
rest of his prayer and performed two prostrations, and said, 'The 
Prophet prayed like this.' "
