### Hadith 2:60

*Narrated Sahl bin Sad:*

There was a woman amongst us who had a farm and she used to sow Silq (a
kind of vegetable) on the edges of streams in her farm. On Fridays she
used to pull out the Silq from its roots and put the roots in a utensil.
Then she would put a handful of powdered barley over it and cook it. The
roots of the Silq were a substitute for meat. After finishing the Jumua
prayer we used to greet her and she would give us that food which we
would eat with our hands, and because of that meal, we used to look
forward to Friday.
