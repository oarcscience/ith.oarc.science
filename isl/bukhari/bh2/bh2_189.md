### Hadith 2:190

*Narrated 'Abdur Rahman bin Yazid:*

We offered a four Rakat prayer at Mina behind Ibn 'Affan . 'Abdullah bin
Masud was informed about it. He said sadly, "Truly to Allah we belong
and truly to Him we shall return." And added, "I prayed two Rakat with
Allah's Apostle at Mina and similarly with Abu Bakr and with 'Umar
(during their caliphates)." He further said, "May I be lucky enough to
have two of the four Rakat accepted (by Allah)."
