### Hadith 2:157

*Narrated Aisha:*

(the wife of the Prophet) On the day when the sun Khasafat (eclipsed)
Allah's Apostle prayed; he stood up and said Takbir and recited a
prolonged recitation, then he performed a prolonged bowing, then he
raised his head and said, "Sami'a-l-lahu Lyman Hamidah," and then
remained standing and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter

than the first. Then he prostrated and prolonged the prostration and he
did the same in the second Raka as in the first and then finished the
prayer with Taslim. By that time the sun (eclipse) had cleared He
addressed the people and said, "The sun and the moon are two of the
signs of Allah; they do not eclipse (Yakhsifan) because of the death or
the life (i.e. birth) of someone. So when you see them make haste for
the prayer."
