### Hadith 2:164

*Narrated 'Amra bint 'AbdurRahman:*

A Jewess came to 'Aisha to ask her about something and then she said,
"May Allah give you refuge from the punishment of the grave." So 'Aisha
asked Allah's Apostle, "Would the people be punished in their graves?"
Allah's Apostle asked Allah's refuge from the punishment of the grave
(indicating an affirmative reply). Then one day Allah's Apostle rode (to
leave for some place) but the sun eclipsed. He returned on the forenoon
and passed through the rear of the dwellings (of his wives) and stood up
and started offering the (eclipse) prayer and the people stood behind
him. He stood for a long period and then performed a long bowing and
then stood straight for a long period which was shorter than that of the
first standing, then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter
than the first bowing, then he raised his head and prostrated for a long
time and then stood up (for the second Raka) for a long while, but the
standing was shorter than the standing of the first Raka. Then he
performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than that of the first
one. He then stood up for a long time but shorter than the first, then
again performed a long bowing which was shorter than the first and then
prostrated for a shorter while than that of the first prostration. Then
he finished the prayer and delivered the sermon and) said what Allah
wished; and ordered the people to seek refuge with Allah from the
punishment of the grave.
