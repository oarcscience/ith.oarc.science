<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:639</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Shihab:</I></P>
I left for Mecca for Hajj-at-Tamattu' assuming Ihram for 'Umra. I 
reached Mecca three days before the day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja). 
Some people of Mecca said to me, "Your Hajj will be like the Hajj 
performed by the people of Mecca (i.e. you will lose the superiority 
of assuming Ihram from the Miqat). So I went to 'Ata' asking him his 
view about it. He said, "Jabir bin 'Abdullah narrated to me, 'I 
performed Hajj with Allah's Apostle on the day when he drove camels 
with him. The people had assumed Ihram for Hajj-al-Ifrad. The Prophet 
ordered them to finish their Ihram after Tawaf round the Ka'ba, and 
between Safa and Marwa and to cut short their hair and then to stay 
there (in Mecca) as non-Muhrims till the day of Tarwiya (i.e. 8th of 
Dhul-Hijja) when they would assume Ihram for Hajj and they were 
ordered to make the Ihram with which they had come as for 'Umra only. 
They asked, 'How can we make it 'Umra (Tamattu') as we have intended 
to perform Hajj?' The Prophet said, 'Do what I have ordered you. Had I
not brought the Hadi with me, I would have done the same, but I cannot
finish my Ihram till the Hadi reaches its destination (i.e. is 
slaughtered).' So, they did (what he ordered them to do)."
