*Narrated Hisham's father:*

Aisha said, "I went to Abu Bakr (during his fatal illness) and he asked
me, 'In how many garments was the Prophet shrouded?' She replied, 'In
three Sahuliya pieces of white cloth of cotton, and there was neither a
shirt nor a turban among them.' Abu Bakr further asked her, 'On which
day did the Prophet die?' She replied, 'He died on Monday.' He asked,
'What is today?' She replied, 'Today is Monday.' He added, 'I hope I
shall die sometime between this morning and tonight.' Then he looked at
a garment that he was wearing during his illness and it had some stains
of saffron. Then he said, 'Wash this garment of mine and add two more
garments and shroud me in them.' I said, 'This is worn out.' He said, 'A
living person has more right to wear new clothes than a dead one; the
shroud is only for the body's pus.' He did not die till it was the night
of Tuesday and was buried before the morning."
