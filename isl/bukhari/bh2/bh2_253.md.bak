### Hadith 2:253

*Narrated 'Ubada bin As-Samit:*

The Prophet "Whoever gets up at night and says: -- 'La ilaha il-lallah
Wahdahu la Sharika lahu Lahu-l-mulk, waLahu-l-hamd wahuwa 'ala
kullishai'in Qadir. Alhamdu lil-lahi wa subhanal-lahi wa la-ilaha
il-lal-lah wa-l-lahu akbar wa la hawla Wala Quwata il-la-bil-lah.' (None
has the right to be worshipped but Allah. He is the Only One and has no
partners . For Him is the Kingdom and all the praises are due for Him.
He is Omnipotent. All the praises are for Allah. All the glories are for
Allah. And none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, And Allah is
Great And there is neither Might nor Power Except with Allah). And then
says: -- Allahumma, Ighfir li(O Allah! Forgive me). Or invokes (Allah),
he will be responded to and if he performs ablution (and prays), his
prayer will be accepted."
