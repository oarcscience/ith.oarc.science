<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:215</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) fell down from a horse and his right side 
was either injured or scratched, so we went to inquire about his 
health. The time for the prayer became due and he offered the prayer 
while sitting and we prayed while standing. He said, "The Imam is to 
be followed; so if he says Takbir, you should also say Takbir, and if 
he bows you should also bow; and when he lifts his head you should 
also do the same and if he says: Sami'a-l-lahu Liman Hamidah (Allah 
hears whoever sends his praises to Him) you should say: Rabbana 
walakal-Hamd (O our Lord! All the praises are for You.") (See 
Hadith No. 656 Vol. 1).
