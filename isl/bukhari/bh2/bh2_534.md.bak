### Hadith 2:533

*Narrated Anas:*

Abu Bakr , wrote to me about the Zakat which Allah had ordered His
Apostle to observe: Whoever had to pay Jahda (Jahda means a
four-year-old she-camel) as Zakat from his herd of camels and he had not
got one, and he had Hiqqa (three-year-old she-camel), that Hiqqa should
be accepted from him along with two sheep if they were available or
twenty Dirhams (one Durham equals about 1/4 Saudi Riyal) and whoever had
to pay Hiqqa as Zakat and he had no Hiqqa but had a Jadha, the Jadha
should be accepted from him, and the Zakat collector should repay him
twenty Dirhams or two sheep; and whoever had to pay Hiqqa as Zakat and
he had not got one, but had a Bint Labun (two-year-old she-camel), it
should be accepted from him along with two sheep or twenty Dirhams; and
whoever had to pay Bint Labun and had a Hiqqa, that Hiqqa should be
accepted from him and the Zakat collector should repay him twenty
Dirhams or two sheep; and whoever had to pay Bint Labun and he had not
got one but had a Bint Makhad (one-year-old she camel), that Bint Makhad
should be accepted from him along with twenty Dirhams or two sheep.
