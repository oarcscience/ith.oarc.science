### Hadith 2:502

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "A man said that he would give something
in charity. He went out with his object of charity and unknowingly gave
it to a thief. Next morning the people said that he had given his object
of charity to a thief. (On hearing that) he said, "O Allah! All the
praises are for you. I will give alms again." And so he again went out
with his alms and (unknowingly) gave it to an adulteress. Next morning
the people said that he had given his alms to an adulteress last night.
The man said, "O Allah! All the praises are for you. (I gave my alms) to
an adulteress. I will give alms again." So he went out with his alms
again and (unknowingly) gave it to a rich person. (The people) next
morning said that he had given his alms to a wealthy person. He said, "O
Allah! All the praises are for you. (I had given alms) to a thief, to an
adulteress and to a wealthy man." Then someone came and said to him,
"The alms which you gave to the thief, might make him abstain from
stealing, and that given to the adulteress might make her abstain from
illegal sexual intercourse (adultery), and that given to the wealthy man
might make him take a lesson from it and spend his wealth which Allah
has given him, in Allah's cause."
