<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:45</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amr bin Taghlib:</I></P>
Some property or something was brought to Allah's Apostle and he 
distributed it. He gave to some men and ignored the others. Later he 
got the news of his being admonished by those whom he had ignored. So 
he glorified and praised Allah and said, "Amma ba'du. By Allah, I may 
give to a man and ignore another, although the one whom I ignore is 
more beloved to me than the one whom I give. But I give to some people
as I feel that they have no patience and no contentment in their 
hearts and I leave those who are patient and self-contented with the 
goodness and wealth which Allah has put into their hearts and 'Amr bin
Taghlib is one of them." Amr added, By Allah! Those words of Allah's 
Apostle are more beloved to me than the best red camels.
