### Hadith 2:526

*Narrated Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri :*

Allah's Apostle said, "There is no Zakat on less than five camels and
also there is no Zakat on less than five Awaq (of silver). (5 Awaq = 22
Fransa Riyals of Yamen or 200 Dirhams.) And there is no Zakat on less
than five Awsuq. (A special measure of food-grains, and one Wasq equals
60 Sa's.) (For gold 20, Dinars i.e. equal to 12 Guinea English. No Zakat
for less than 12 Guinea (English) of gold or for silver less than 22
Fransa Riyals of Yamen.)
