### Hadith 2:309

*Narrated Sahl bin Sad:*

The news about the differences amongst the people of Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf
at Quba reached Allah's Apostle and so he went to them along with some
of his companions to affect a reconciliation. Allah's Apostle was
delayed there and the time for the prayer became due. Bilal came to Abu
Bakr! and said, "O Abu Bakr! Allah's Apostle is detained (there) and the
time for the prayer is due. Will you lead the people in prayer?" Abu
Bakr replied, "Yes, if you wish." So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu
Bakr went forward and the people said Takbir. In the meantime, Allah's
Apostle came piercing through the rows till he stood in the (first) row
and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, would never look hither and
thither during the prayer but when the people clapped much he looked
back and saw Allah's Apostle. The Prophet beckoned him to carry on. Abu
Bakr raised both his hands, praised Allah and retreated till he stood in
the row and Allah's Apostle went forward and led the people in the
prayer. When he had finished the prayer, he addressed the people and
said, "O people! Why did you start clapping when something happened to
you in the prayer? Clapping is for women. Whenever one is confronted
with something unusual in the prayer one should say, 'Sub Han Allah'."
Then the Prophet looked towards Abu Bakr and asked, "What prevented you
from leading the prayer when I beckoned you to carry on?" Abu Bakr
replied, "It does not befit the son of Al Quhafa to lead the prayer in
the presence of Allah's Apostle
