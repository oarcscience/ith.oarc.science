### Hadith 2:562

*Narrated Abu Huraira :*

Dates used to be brought to Allah's Apostle immediately after being
plucked. Different persons would bring their dates till a big heap
collected (in front of the Prophet). Once Al-Hasan and Al-Husain were
playing with these dates. One of them took a date and put it in his
mouth. Allah's Apostle looked at him and took it out from his mouth and
said, "Don't you know that Muhammad's offspring do not eat what is given
in charity?"

[Next: 2:563: Ibn 'Umar: The Prophet had forbidden the sale of dates
till they were good ...](bh2_564)
