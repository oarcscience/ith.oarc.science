### Hadith 2:785

*Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:*

Allah's Apostle said, "O Allah! Be merciful to those who have their head
shaved." The people said, "O Allah's Apostle! And (invoke Allah for)
those who get their hair cut short." The Prophet said, "O Allah! Be
merciful to those who have their head shaved." The people said, "O
Allah's Apostle! And those who get their hair cut short." The Prophet
said (the third time), "And to those who get their hair cut short."
Nafi' said that the Prophet had said once or twice, "O Allah! Be
merciful to those who get their head shaved," and on the fourth time he
added, "And to those who have their hair cut short."
