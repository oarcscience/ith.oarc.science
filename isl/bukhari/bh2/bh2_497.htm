When the verses of charity were revealed, we used to work as porters. 
A man came and distributed objects of charity in abundance. And they 
(the people) said, "He is showing off." And another man came and gave 
a sa (a small measure of food grains); they said, "Allah is not in 
need of this small amount of charity." And then the Divine Inspiration
came: "Those who criticize such of the believers who give in charity 
voluntarily and those who could not find to give in charity except 
what is available to them." (9.79).
