<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:302</H3><P><I>Narrated Al-Azraq bin Qais:</I></P>
We were at Al-Ahwaz fighting the AlHaruriya (tribe). While I was at 
the bank of a river a man was praying and the reins of his animal were
in his hands and the animal was struggling and he was following the 
animal. (Shu'ba, a sub-narrator, said that man was Abu Barza 
al-Aslaml). A man from the Khawarij said, "O Allah! Be harsh to this 
sheik." And when the sheik (Abu Barza) finished his prayer, he said, 
"I heard your remark. No doubt, I participated with Allah's Apostle in
six or seven or eight holy battles and saw his leniency, and no doubt,
I would rather retain my animal than let it return to its stable, as 
it would cause me much trouble. "
