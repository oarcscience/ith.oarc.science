<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:715</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdul 'Aziz bin Rufai:</I></P>
I asked Anas bin Malik, "Tell me what you remember from Allah's 
Apostle (regarding these questions): Where did he offer the Zuhr and 
'Asr prayers on the day of Tarwiya (8th day of Dhul-Hajja)?" He 
relied, "(He offered these prayers) at Mina." I asked, "Where did he 
offer the 'Asr prayer on the day of Nafr (i.e. departure from Mina on 
the 12th or 13th of Dhul-Hijja)?" He replied, "At Al-Abtah," and then 
added, "You should do as your chiefs do."
