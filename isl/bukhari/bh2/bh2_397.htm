That his father said, "While we were accompanying a funeral 
procession, Abu Huraira got hold of the hand of Marwan and they sat 
down before the coffin was put down. Then Abu Said came and took hold

Huraira) knows that the Prophet forbade us to do that." Abu Huraira 
said, "He (Abu Said) has spoken the truth."
