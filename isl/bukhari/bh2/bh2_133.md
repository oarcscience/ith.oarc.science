### Hadith 2:134

*Narrated Anas:*

Allah's Apostle I was delivering the Khutba (sermon) on a Friday when
the people stood up, shouted and said, "O Allah's Apostle! There is no
rain (drought), the trees have dried and the livestock are destroyed;
Please pray to Allah for rain." So Allah's Apostle said twice, "O Allah!
Bless us with rain." By Allah, there was no trace of cloud in the sky
and suddenly the sky became overcast with clouds and it started raining.
The Prophet came down the pulpit and offered the prayer. When he came
back from the prayer (to his house) it was raining and it rained
continuously till the next Friday. When the Prophet started delivering
the Friday Khutba (sermon), the people started shouting and said to him,
"The houses have collapsed and the roads are cut off; so please pray to
Allah to withhold the rain." So the Prophet smiled and said, "O Allah!
Round about us and not on us." So the sky became clear over Medina but
it kept on raining over the outskirts (of Medina) and not a single drop
of rain fell over Median. I looked towards the sky which was as bright
and clear as a crown.
