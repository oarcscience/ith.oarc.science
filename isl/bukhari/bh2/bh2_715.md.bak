### Hadith 2:713

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except
the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Talha had the Hadi (sacrifice) with them. 'Ali
arrived from Yemen and had a Hadi with him. 'Ali said, "I have assumed
Ihram for what the Prophet has done." The Prophet ordered his companions
to perform the 'Umra with the lhram which they had assumed, and after
finishing Tawaf (of Ka'ba, Safa and Marwa) to cut short their hair, and
to finish their lhram except those who had Hadi with them. They (the
people) said, "How can we proceed to Mina (for Hajj) after having sexual
relations with our wives?" When that news reached the Prophet he said,
"If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have
brought the Hadi with me. Had there been no Hadi with me, I would have
finished the state of lhram." 'Aisha got her menses, so she performed
all the ceremonies of Hajj except Tawaf of the Ka'ba, and when she got
clean (from her menses), she performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba. She said, "O
Allah's Apostle! (All of you) are returning with the Hajj and 'Umra, but
I am returning after performing Hajj only." So the Prophet ordered
'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to accompany her to Tan'im and thus she
performed the 'Umra after the Hajj.
