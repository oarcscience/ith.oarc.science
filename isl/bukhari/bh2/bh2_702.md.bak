said, "O Fadl! Go to your mother and bring water from her for Allah's
Apostle ." Allah's Apostle said, "Give me water to drink." Al-Abbas
said, "O Allahs Apostle! The people put their hands in it." Allah's
Apostle again said, 'Give me water to drink. So, he drank from that
water and then went to the Zam-zam (well) and there the people were

well). The Prophet then said to them, "Carry on! You are doing a good

with you (in drawing water from Zam-zam), I would certainly take the
rope and put it over this (i.e. his shoulder) (to draw water)." On
saying that the Prophet pointed to his shoulder.
