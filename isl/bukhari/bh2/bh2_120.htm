<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:121</H3><P><I>Narrated Masruq:</I></P>
We were with 'Abdullah and he said, "When the Prophet saw the refusal 
of the people to accept Islam he said, "O Allah! Send (famine) years 
on them for (seven years) like the seven years (of famine during the 
time) of (Prophet) Joseph." So famine overtook them for one year and 
destroyed every kind of life to such an extent that the people started
eating hides, carcasses and rotten dead animals. Whenever one of them 
looked towards the sky, he would (imagine himself to) see smoke 
because of hunger. So Abu Sufyan went to the Prophet and said, "O 
Muhammad! You order people to obey Allah and to keep good relations 
with kith and kin. No doubt the people of your tribe are dying, so 
please pray to Allah for them." So Allah revealed: "Then watch you For
the day that The sky will bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible 
... Verily! You will return (to disbelief) On the day when We shall 
seize You with a mighty grasp. (44.10-16) Ibn Masud added, "Al-Batsha 
(i.e. grasp) happened in the battle of Badr and no doubt smoke, 
Al-Batsha, Al-Lizam, and the verse of Surat Ar-Rum have all passed .
