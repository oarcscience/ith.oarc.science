### Hadith 2:623

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Allah's Apostle offered four Rakat of Zuhr prayer at Medina and we were
in his company, and two Rakat of the Asr prayer at Dhul-Hulaifa and then
passed the night there till it was dawn; then he rode, and when he
reached Al-Baida', he praised and glorified Allah and said Takbir (i.e.
Alhamdu-lillah and Subhanallah(1) and Allahu-Akbar). Then he and the
people along with him recited Talbiya with the intention of performing
Hajj and Umra. When we reached (Mecca) he ordered us to finish the lhram
(after performing the Umra) (only those who had no Hadi (animal for
sacrifice) with them were asked to do so) till the day of Tarwiya that
is 8th Dhul-Hijja when they assumed Ihram for Hajj. The Prophet
sacrificed many camels (slaughtering them) with his own hands while
standing. While Allah's Apostle was in Medina he sacrificed two horned
rams black and white in color in the Name of Allah."
