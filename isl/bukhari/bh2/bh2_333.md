### Hadith 2:331

*Narrated Al-Bara' bin 'Azib:*

Allah's Apostle ordered us to do seven things and forbade us to do other
seven. He ordered us:

to follow the funeral procession. to visit the sick, to accept
invitations, to help the oppressed, to fulfill the oaths, to return the
greeting and to reply to the sneezer: (saying, "May Allah be merciful on
you," provided the sneezer says, "All the praises are for Allah,"). He
forbade us to use silver utensils and dishes and to wear golden rings,
silk (clothes), Dibaj (pure silk cloth), Qissi and Istabraq (two kinds
of silk cloths).
