<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:392</H3><P><I>Narrated Aisha:</I></P>
When the news of the martyrdom of Zaid bin Haritha, Ja'far and 
'Abdullah bin Rawaha came, the Prophet sat down looking sad, and I was
looking through the chink of the door. A man came and said, "O Allah's
Apostle! The women of Ja'far," and then he mentioned their crying . 
The Prophet (p.b.u.h) ordered h im to stop them from crying. The man 
went and came back and said, "I tried to stop them but they 
disobeyed." The Prophet (p.b.u.h) ordered him for the second time to 
forbid them. He went again and came back and said, "They did not 
listen to me, (or "us": the sub-narrator Muhammad bin Haushab is in 
doubt as to which is right). " ('Aisha added: The Prophet said, "Put 
dust in their mouths." I said (to that man), "May Allah stick your 
nose in the dust (i.e. humiliate you)." By Allah, you could not (stop 
the women from crying) to fulfill the order, besides you did not 
relieve Allah's Apostle from fatigue."
