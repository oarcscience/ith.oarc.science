The Prophet said, "A man keeps on asking others for something till he 
comes on the Day of Resurrection without any piece of flesh on his 
face." The Prophet added, "On the Day of Resurrection, the Sun will 
come near (to, the people) to such an extent that the sweat will reach
up to the middle of the ears, so, when all the people are in that 
state, they will ask Adam for help, and then Moses, and then Muhammad 
(p.b.u.h) ." The sub-narrator added "Muhammad will intercede with 
Allah to judge amongst the people. He will proceed on till he will 
hold the ring of the door (of Paradise) and then Allah will exalt him 
to Maqam Mahmud (the privilege of intercession, etc.). And all the 
people of the gathering will send their praises to Allah.
