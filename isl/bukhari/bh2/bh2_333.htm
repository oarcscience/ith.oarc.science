Allah's Apostle ordered us to do seven things and forbade us to do 
other seven. He ordered us: 
<P>
to follow the funeral procession. to visit the sick, to accept 
invitations, to help the oppressed, to fulfill the oaths, to return 
the greeting and to reply to the sneezer: (saying, "May Allah be 
merciful on you," provided the sneezer says, "All the praises are for 
Allah,"). He forbade us to use silver utensils and dishes and to wear 
golden rings, silk (clothes), Dibaj (pure silk cloth), Qissi and 
Istabraq (two kinds of silk cloths).
