### Hadith 2:548

*Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:*

Some Ansari persons asked for (something) from Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h)
and he gave them. They again asked him for (something) and he again gave
them. And then they asked him and he gave them again till all that was
with him finished. And then he said "If I had anything. I would not keep
it away from you. (Remember) Whoever abstains from asking others, Allah
will make him contented, and whoever tries to make himself
self-sufficient, Allah will make him self-sufficient. And whoever
remains patient, Allah will make him patient. Nobody can be given a
blessing better and greater than patience."
