<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:782</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Musa:</I></P>
came upon Allah's Apostle when he was at Al-Bat-ha. He asked me, "Have
you intended to perform the Hajj?" I replied in the affirmative. He 
asked, "For what have you assumed lhram?" I replied," I have assumed 
Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet ." The Prophet 
said, "You have done well! Go and perform Tawaf round the Ka'ba and 
between Safa and Marwa." Then I went to one of the women of Bani Qais 
and she took out lice from my head. Later, I assumed the Ihram for 
Hajj. So, I used to give this verdict to the people till the caliphate
of 'Umar. When I told him about it, he said, "If we take (follow) the 
Holy Book, then it orders us to complete Hajj and 'Umra 
(Hajj-at-Tamattu') and if we follow the tradition of Allah's Apostle 
then Allah's Apostle did not finish his lhram till the Hadi had 
reached its destination (had been slaughtered). (i.e. Hajj-al-Qiran).
