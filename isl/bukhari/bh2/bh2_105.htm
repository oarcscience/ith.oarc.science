<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:106</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
Once I passed the night in the house of Maimuna (his aunt). I slept 
across the bed while Allah's Apostle and his wife slept length-wise. 
The Prophet slept till midnight or nearly so and woke up rubbing his 
face and recited ten verses from Surat "Aal-Imran." Allah's Apostle 
went towards a leather skin and performed ablution in the most perfect
way and then stood for the prayer. I did the same and stood beside 
him. The Prophet put his right hand on my head, twisted my ear and 
then prayed two Rakat five times and then ended his prayer with Witr. 
He laid down till the Muadh-dhin came then he stood up and offered two
Rakat (Sunna of Fajr prayer) and then went out and offered the Fajr 
prayer.
