### Hadith 2:504

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Seven people will be shaded by Allah under
His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His. They are:

\(1\) a just ruler;

\(2\) a young man who has been brought up in the worship of Allah, (i.e.
worship Allah (Alone) sincerely from his childhood),

\(3\) a man whose heart is attached to the mosque (who offers the five
compulsory congregational prayers in the mosque);

\(4\) two persons who love each other only for Allah's sake and they
meet and part in Allah's cause only;

\(5\) a man who refuses the call of a charming woman of noble birth for
an illegal sexual intercourse with her and says: I am afraid of Allah;

\(6\) a person who practices charity so secretly that his left hand does
not know what his right hand has given (i.e. nobody knows how much he
has given in charity).

\(7\) a person who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes get flooded
with tears."

(p.b.u.h) saying, (O people!) Give in charity ...](bh2_506.md)
