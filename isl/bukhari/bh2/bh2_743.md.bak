### Hadith 2:741

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

We got down at Al-Muzdalifa and Sauda asked the permission of the
Prophet to leave (early) before the rush of the people. She was a slow
woman and he gave her permission, so she departed (from Al-Muzdalifa)
before the rush of the people. We kept on staying at Al-Muzdalifa till
dawn, and set out with the Prophet but (I suffered so much that) I
wished I had taken the permission of Allah's Apostle as Sauda had done,
and that would have been dearer to me than any other happiness.
