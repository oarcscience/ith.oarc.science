### Hadith 2:323

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "When the call for prayer is made, Satan takes to
his heels passing wind so that he may not hear the Adhan and when the
call is finished he comes back, and when the Iqama is pronounced, Satan
again takes to his heels, and when the Iqama is finished he comes back
again and tries to interfere with the person and his thoughts and say,
"Remember this and that (which he has not thought of before the
prayer)", till the praying person forgets how much he has prayed. If
anyone of you does not remember whether he has offered three or four
Rakat then he should perform two prostrations of Sahu while sitting.
