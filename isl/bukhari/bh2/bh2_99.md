### Hadith 2:100

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Allah's Apostle .\~ offered the prayer on the day of Nahr and then
delivered the Khutba and ordered that whoever had slaughtered his
sacrifice before the prayer should repeat it, that is, should slaughter
another sacrifice. Then a person from the Ansar stood up and said, "O
Allah's Apostle! because of my neighbors (he described them as being
very needy or poor) I slaughtered before the prayer. I have a young
she-goat which, in my opinion, is better than two sheep." The Prophet
gave him the permission for slaughtering it as a sacrifice.
