### Hadith 2:315

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Buhaina :*

Allah's Apostle once led us in a prayer and offered two Rakat and got up
(for the third Raka) without sitting (after the second Raka). The people
also got up with him, and when he was about to finish his prayer, we
waited for him to finish the prayer with Taslim but he said Takbir
before Taslim and performed two prostrations while sitting and then
finished the prayer with Taslim.
