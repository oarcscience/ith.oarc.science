### Hadith 2:37

*Narrated Abu Umama bin Sahl bin Hunaif:*

I heard Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan (repeating the statements of the Adhan)
while he was sitting on the pulpit. When the Muadh-dhin pronounced the
Adhan saying, "Allahu-Akbar, Allahu Akbar", Muawiya said: "Allah Akbar,
Allahu Akbar." And when the Muadh-dhin said, "Ash-hadu an la ilaha
illal-lah (I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but
Allah)", Muawiya said, "And (so do) I". When he said, "Ash-hadu anna
Muhammadan Rasulullah" (I testify that Muhammad is Allah's Apostle),
Muawiya said, "And (so do) I". When the Adhan was finished, Muawiya
said, "O people, when the Muadh-dhin pronounced the Adhan I heard
Allah's Apostle on this very pulpit saying what you have just heard me
saying".
