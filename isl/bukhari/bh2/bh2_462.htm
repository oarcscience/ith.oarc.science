Allah's Apostle said, "When anyone of you dies, he is shown his place 
both in the morning and in the evening. If he is one of the people of 
Paradise; he is shown his place in it, and if he is from the people of
the Hell-Fire; he is shown his place there-in. Then it is said to him,
'This is your place till Allah resurrect you on the Day of 
Resurrection."
