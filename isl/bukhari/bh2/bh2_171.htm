<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:172</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
The Prophet (p.b.u.h) recited (the Quran) aloud during the eclipse 
prayer and when he had finished the eclipse prayer he said the Takbir 
and bowed. When he stood straight from bowing he would say "Sami 
'al-l-ahu Lyman hamidah Rabbana walaka-l-hamd." And he would again 
start reciting. In the eclipse prayer there are four bowing and four 
prostrations in two Rakat. Al-Auza'i and others said that they had 
heard Az-Zuhi from 'Ursa from 'Aisha saying, "In the life-time of 
Allah's Apostle the sun eclipsed, and he made a person to announce: 
'Prayer in congregation.' He led the prayer and performed four bowing 
'Abdur-Rahman bin Namir had informed him that he had heard the same. 
Ibn Shihab heard the same. Az-Zuhrl said, "I asked ('Ursa), 'What did 
your brother 'Abdullah bin AzZubair do? He prayed two Rakat (of the 
eclipse prayer) like the morning prayer, when he offered the (eclipse)
prayer in Median.' 'Ursa replied that he had missed (i.e. did not pray
according to) the Prophet's tradition." Sulaiman bin Kathir and Sufyan
bin Husain narrated from Az-Zuhri that the prayer for the eclipse used
to be offered with loud recitation.
