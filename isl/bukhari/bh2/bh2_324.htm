(the ally of Bani 'Abdul Muttalib) Allah's Apostle stood up for the 
Zuhr prayer and he should have sat (after the second Raka but he stood

each prostration while sitting, before ending (the prayer) with 
Taslim; and the people too performed the two prostrations with him 
instead of the sitting he forgot.
