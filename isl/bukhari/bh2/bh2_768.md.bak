### Hadith 2:766

*Narrated Nafi':*

Ibn 'Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year of the Hajj of
Al-Harawriya during the rule of Ibn Az-Zubair. Some people said to him,
"It is very likely that there will be a fight among the people, and we
are afraid that they might prevent you (from performing Hajj)." He
replied, "Verily, in Allah's Apostle there is a good example for you (to
follow). In this case I would do the same as he had done. I make you
witness that I have intended to perform 'Umra." When he reached
Al-Baida', he said, "The conditions for both Hajj and 'Umra are the
same. I make you witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with
'Umra." After that he took a garlanded Hadi (to Mecca) which he bought
(on the way). When he reached (Mecca), he performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba
and of Safa (and Marwa) and did not do more than that. He did not make
legal for himself the things which were illegal for a Muhrim till it was
the Day of Nahr (sacrifice), when he had his head shaved and slaughtered
(the sacrifice) and considered sufficient his first Tawaf (between Safa
and Marwa), as a (Sa'i) for his Hajj and 'Umra both. He then said, "The
Prophet used to do like that."
