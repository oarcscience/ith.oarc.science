### Hadith 2:747

*Narrated Abu Jamra:*

I asked Ibn Abbas about Hajj-at-Tamattu'. He ordered me to perform it. I
asked him about the Hadi (sacrifice). He said, "You have to slaughter a
camel, a cow or a sheep, or you may share the Hadi with the others." It
seemed that some people disliked it (Hajj-at-Tamattu). I slept and
dreamt as if a person was announcing: "Hajj Mabrur and accepted Mut'ah
(Hajj-At-Tamattu')" I went to Ibn Abbas and narrated it to him. He said,
"Allah is Greater. (That was) the tradition of Abu was. "An accepted
'Umra and Hajj-Mabrur. "
