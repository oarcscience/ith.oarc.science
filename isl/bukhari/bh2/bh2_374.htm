<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:373</H3><P><I>Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</I></P>
The daughter of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) sent (a messenger) to the 
Prophet requesting him to come as her child was dying (or was 
gasping), but the Prophet returned the messenger and told him to 
convey his greeting to her and say: "Whatever Allah takes is for Him 
and whatever He gives, is for Him, and everything with Him has a 
limited fixed term (in this world) and so she should be patient and 
hope for Allah's reward." She again sent for him, swearing that he 
should come. The Prophet got up, and so did Sad bin 'Ubada, Muadh bin 
Jabal, Ubai bin Ka'b, Zaid bin Thabit and some other men. The child 
was brought to Allah's Apostle while his breath was disturbed in his 
chest (the sub-narrator thinks that Usama added: ) as if it was a 
leather water-skin. On that the eyes of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) started 
shedding tears. Sad said, "O Allah's Apostle! What is this?" He 
replied, "It is mercy which Allah has lodged in the hearts of His 
slaves, and Allah is merciful only to those of His slaves who are 
merciful (to others).
