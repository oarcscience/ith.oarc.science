### Hadith 2:726

*Narrated 'Urwa:*

During the pre-lslamic period of Ignorance, the people used to perform
Tawaf of the Ka'ba naked except the Hums; and the Hums were Quraish and
their offspring. The Hums used to give clothes to the men who would
perform the Tawaf wearing them; and women (of the Hums) used to give
clothes to the women who would perform the Tawaf wearing them. Those to
whom the Hums did not give clothes would perform Tawaf round the Ka'ba
naked. Most of the people used to go away (disperse) directly from
'Arafat but they (Hums) used to depart after staying at Al-Muzdalifa.
'Urwa added, "My father narrated that 'Aisha had said, 'The following
verses were revealed about the Hums: Then depart from the place whence
all the people depart--(2.199) 'Urwa added, "They (the Hums) used to
stay at Al-Muzdalifa and used to depart from there (to Mina) and so they
were sent to 'Arafat (by Allah's order)."
