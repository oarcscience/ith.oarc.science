### Hadith 2:23

*Narrated Ibn Umar:*

One of the wives of Umar (bin Al-Khattab) used to offer the Fajr and the
'Isha' prayer in congregation in the Mosque. She was asked why she had
come out for the prayer as she knew that Umar disliked it, and he has
great ghaira (self-respect). She replied, "What prevents him from
stopping me from this act?" The other replied, "The statement of Allah's
Apostle (p.b.u.h) : 'Do not stop Allah's women-slave from going to Allah
s Mosques' prevents him."
