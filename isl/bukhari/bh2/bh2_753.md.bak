### Hadith 2:751

*Narrated Nafi':*

'Abdullah (bin 'Abdullah) bin 'Umar said to his father, "Stay here, for
I am afraid that it (affliction between Ibn Zubair and Al-Hajjaj) might
prevent you from reaching the Ka'ba." Ibn 'Umar said, "(In this case) I
would do the same as Allah's Apostle did, and Allah has said, 'Verily,
in Allah's Apostle, you have a good example (to follow).' So, I make
you, people, witness that I have made 'Umra compulsory for me." So he
assumed lhram for'Umra. Then he went out and when he reached Al-Baida',
he assumed Ihram for Hajj and 'Umra (together) and said, "The conditions
(requisites) of Hajj and 'Umra are the same." He, then brought a Hadi
from Qudaid. Then he arrived (at Mecca) and performed Tawaf (between
Safa and Marwa) once for both Hajj and 'Umra and did not finish the
lhram till he had finished both Hajj and 'Umra.
