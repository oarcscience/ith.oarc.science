### Hadith 2:93

*Narrated Al-Bara':*

The Prophet went towards Al-Baqi (the grave-yard at Medina) on the day
of Id-ul-Adha and offered a two-Rakat prayer (of 'Id-ul-Adha) and then
faced us and said, "On this day of ours, our first act of worship is the
offering of prayer and then we will return and slaughter the sacrifice,
and whoever does this concords with our Sunna; and whoever slaughtered
his sacrifice before that (i.e. before the prayer) then that was a thing
which he prepared earlier for his family and it would not be considered
as a Nusuk (sacrifice.)" A man stood up and said, "O, Allah's Apostle! I
slaughtered (the animal before the prayer) but I have a young she-goat
which is better than an older sheep." The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said to him,
"Slaughter it. But a similar sacrifice will not be sufficient for
anybody else after you."
