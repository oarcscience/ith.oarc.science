### Hadith 2:294

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Masud:*

We used to say the greeting, name and greet each other in the prayer.
Allah's Apostle heard it and said:--"Say, 'At-tahiyyatu lil-lahi
was-salawatu wat-taiyibatu . Assalamu 'Alaika aiyuha-n-Nabiyu
wa-rahmatu-l-lahi wa-barakatuhu. \_ Assalamu alaina wa-'ala
'ibadi-l-lahi as-salihin.. Ashhadu an la ilaha illa-l-lah wa ashhadu
anna Muhammadan 'abdu hu wa Rasuluh. (All the compliments are for Allah
and all the prayers and all the good things (are for Allah). Peace be on
you, O Prophet, and Allah's mercy and blessings (are on you). And peace
be on us and on the good (pious) worshipers of Allah. I testify that
none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His
slave and Apostle.) So, when you have said this, then you have surely
sent the greetings to every good (pious) worship per of Allah, whether
he be in the Heaven or on the Earth . "
