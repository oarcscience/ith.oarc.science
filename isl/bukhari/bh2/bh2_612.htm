Salim bin 'Abdullah's father said, "The Prophet said that while 
resting in the bottom of the valley at Mu'arras in Dhul-Hulaifa, he 
had been addressed in a dream: 'You are verily in a blessed valley.' "
Salim made us to dismount from our camels at the place where 'Abdullah
used to dismount, aiming at the place where Allah's Apostle had rested
and it was below the Mosque situated in the middle of the valley in 
between them (the residence) and the road.
