### Hadith 2:530

*Narrated Anas:*

Abu Bakr wrote to me what was made compulsory by Allah's Apostle and
that was (regarding the payments of Zakat): Neither the property of
different people may be taken together nor the joint property may be
split for fear of (paying more, or receiving less) Zakat. (1)
