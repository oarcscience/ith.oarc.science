<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:359</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
When 'Abdullah bin Ubai (the chief of hypocrites) died, his son came 
to the Prophet and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Please give me your shirt
to shroud him in it, offer his funeral prayer and ask for Allah's 
forgiveness for him." So Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) gave his shirt to 
him and said, "Inform me (When the funeral is ready) so that I may 
offer the funeral prayer." So, he informed him and when the Prophet 
intended to offer the funeral prayer, 'Umar took hold of his hand and 
said, "Has Allah not forbidden you to offer the funeral prayer for the
hypocrites? The Prophet said, "I have been given the choice for Allah 
says: '(It does not avail) Whether you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness 
for them (hypocrites), or do not ask for forgiveness for them. Even 
though you ask for their forgiveness seventy times, Allah will not 
forgive them. (9.80)" So the Prophet offered the funeral prayer and on
that the revelation came: "And never (O Muhammad) pray (funeral 
prayer) for any of them (i.e. hypocrites) that dies." (9. 84)
