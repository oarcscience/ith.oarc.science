### Hadith 2:516

*Narrated Abu Wail:*

Hudhaifa said, "'Umar said, 'Who amongst you remembers the statement of
Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) about afflictions'?' I said, 'I know it as the
Prophet had said it.' 'Umar said, 'No doubt, you are bold. How did he
say it?' I said, 'A man's afflictions (wrong deeds) concerning his wife,
children and neighbors are expiated by (his) prayers, charity, and
enjoining good.' (The sub-narrator Sulaiman added that he said, 'The
prayer, charity, enjoining good and forbidding evil.') 'Umar said, 'I
did not mean that, but I ask about that affliction which will spread
like the waves of the sea.' I said, 'O chief of the believers! You need
not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and it.' He
asked, 'Will the door be broken or opened?' I replied, 'No, it will be
broken.' He said, 'Then, if it is broken, it will never be closed
again?' I replied, 'Yes.' " Then we were afraid to ask what that door
was, so we asked Masruq to inquire, and he asked Hudhaifa regarding it.
Hudhaifa said, "The door was 'Umar. "We further asked Hudhaifa whether
'Umar knew what that door meant. Hudhaifa replied in the affirmative and
added, "He knew it as one knows that there will be a night before the
tomorrow morning."
