### Hadith 2:221

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

When the Prophet got up at night to offer the Tahajjud prayer, he used
to say: Allahumma lakal-hamd. Anta qaiyimus-samawati wal-ard wa man
fihinna. Walakal-hamd, Laka mulkus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna.
Walakal-hamd, anta nurus-samawati wal-ard. Walakalhamd, anta-l-haq wa
wa'duka-l-haq, wa liqa'uka Haq, wa qualuka Haq, wal-jannatu Han wan-naru
Haq wannabiyuna Haq. Wa Muhammadun, sallal-lahu'alaihi wasallam, Haq,
was-sa'atu Haq. Allahumma aslamtu Laka wabika amantu, wa 'Alaika
tawakkaltu, wa ilaika anabtu wa bika khasamtu, wa ilaika hakamtu faghfir
li ma qaddamtu wama akh-khartu wama as-rartu wama'a lantu,
anta-l-muqaddim wa anta-l-mu akh-khir, la ilaha illa anta (or la ilaha
ghairuka). (O Allah! All the praises are for you, You are the Holder of
the Heavens and the Earth, And whatever is in them. All the praises are
for You; You have the possession of the Heavens and the Earth And
whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You are the Light of
the Heavens and the Earth And all the praises are for You; You are the
King of the Heavens and the Earth; And all the praises are for You; You
are the Truth and Your Promise is the truth, And to meet You is true,
Your Word is the truth And Paradise is true And Hell is true And all the
Prophets (Peace be upon them) are true; And Muhammad is true, And the
Day of Resurrection is true. O Allah ! I surrender (my will) to You; I
believe in You and depend on You. And repent to You, And with Your help
I argue (with my opponents, the non-believers) And I take You as a judge
(to judge between us). Please forgive me my previous And future sins;
And whatever I concealed or revealed And You are the One who make (some
people) forward And (some) backward. There is none to be worshipped but
you . Sufyan said that 'Abdul Karim Abu Umaiya added to the above, 'Wala
haula Wala quwata illa billah' (There is neither might nor power except
with Allah).
