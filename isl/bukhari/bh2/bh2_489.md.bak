### Hadith 2:488

*Narrated Zaid bin Wahab:*

I passed by a place called Ar-Rabadha and by chance I met Abu Dhar and
asked him, "What has brought you to this place?" He said, "I was in Sham
and differed with Muawiya on the meaning of (the following verses of the
Quran): 'They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not in the way
of Allah.' (9.34). Muawiya said, 'This verse is revealed regarding the
people of the scriptures." I said, It was revealed regarding us and also
the people of the scriptures." So we had a quarrel and Mu'awiya sent a
complaint against me to 'Uthman. 'Uthman wrote to me to come to Medina,
and I came to Medina. Many people came to me as if they had not seen me
before. So I told this to 'Uthman who said to me, "You may depart and
live nearby if you wish." That was the reason for my being here for even
if an Ethiopian had been nominated as my ruler, I would have obeyed him
.
