### Hadith 2:480

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

A Bedouin came to the Prophet and said, "Tell me of such a deed as will
make me enter Paradise, if I do it." The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said,
"Worship Allah, and worship none along with Him, offer the (five)
prescribed compulsory prayers perfectly, pay the compulsory Zakat, and
fast the month of Ramadan." The Bedouin said, "By Him, in Whose Hands my
life is, I will not do more than this." When he (the Bedouin) left, the
Prophet said, "Whoever likes to see a man of Paradise, then he may look
at this man."
