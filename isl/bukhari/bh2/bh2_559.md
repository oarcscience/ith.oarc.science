### Hadith 2:558

*Narrated Abu Huraira*

The Prophet said, "No doubt, it is better for a person to take a rope
and proceed in the morning to the mountains and cut the wood and then
sell it, and eat from this income and give alms from it than to ask
others for something."

Tabuk in the company of the Prophet...](bh2_560)
