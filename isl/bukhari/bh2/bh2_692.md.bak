### Hadith 2:690

*Narrated Amr:*

We asked Ibn Umar: "May a man have sexual relations with his wife during
the Umra before performing Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?" He said,
"Allah's Apostle arrived (in Mecca) and circumambulated the Kaba seven
times, then offered two Rakat behind Maqam Ibrahim (the station of
Abraham), then performed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." Ibn Umar added,
"Verily! In Allah's Apostle you have a good example." And I asked Jabir
bin Abdullah (the same question), and he replied, "You should not go
near your wives (have sexual relations) till you have finished Tawaf
between Safa and Marwa. "
