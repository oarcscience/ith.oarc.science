### Hadith 2:359

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

When 'Abdullah bin Ubai (the chief of hypocrites) died, his son came to
the Prophet and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Please give me your shirt to
shroud him in it, offer his funeral prayer and ask for Allah's
forgiveness for him." So Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) gave his shirt to him
and said, "Inform me (When the funeral is ready) so that I may offer the
funeral prayer." So, he informed him and when the Prophet intended to
offer the funeral prayer, 'Umar took hold of his hand and said, "Has
Allah not forbidden you to offer the funeral prayer for the hypocrites?
The Prophet said, "I have been given the choice for Allah says: '(It
does not avail) Whether you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them
(hypocrites), or do not ask for forgiveness for them. Even though you
ask for their forgiveness seventy times, Allah will not forgive them.
(9.80)" So the Prophet offered the funeral prayer and on that the
revelation came: "And never (O Muhammad) pray (funeral prayer) for any
of them (i.e. hypocrites) that dies." (9. 84)
