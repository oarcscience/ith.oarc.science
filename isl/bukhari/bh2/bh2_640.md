### Hadith 2:638

*Narrated Shu'ba:*

Abu Jamra Nasr bin 'Imran Ad-Duba'i said, "I intended to perform
Hajj-at-Tamattu' and the people advised me not to do so. I asked Ibn
Abbas regarding it and he ordered me to perform Hajj-at-Tammatu'. Later
I saw in a dream someone saying to me, 'Hajj-Mabrur (Hajj performed in
accordance with the Prophet's tradition without committing sins and
accepted by Allah) and an accepted 'Umra.' So I told that dream to Ibn
Abbas. He said, 'This is the tradition of Abu-l-Qasim.' Then he said to
me, 'Stay with me and I shall give you a portion of my property.' " I
(Shu'ba) asked, "Why (did he invite you)?" He (Abu Jamra) said, "Because
of the dream which I had seen."
