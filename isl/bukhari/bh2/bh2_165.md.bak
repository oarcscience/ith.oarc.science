### Hadith 2:166

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

In the lifetime of the Prophet the sun eclipsed and the Prophet
(p.b.u.h) stood up to offer the prayer with the people and recited a
long recitation, then he performed a prolonged bowing, and then lifted
his head and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the
first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the
first and then lifted his head and performed two prostrations. He then
stood up for the second Raka and offered it like the first. Then he
stood up and said, "The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of
someone's life or death but they are two signs amongst the signs of
Allah which He shows to His worshipers. So whenever you see them, make
haste for the prayer."
