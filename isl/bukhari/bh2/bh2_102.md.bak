### Hadith 2:103

*Narrated 'Urwa on the authority of 'Aisha:*

On the days of Mina, (11th, 12th, and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah) Abu Bakr came
to her while two young girls were beating the tambourine and the Prophet
was lying covered with his clothes. Abu Bakr scolded them and the
Prophet uncovered his face and said to Abu Bakr, "Leave them, for these
days are the days of 'Id and the days of Mina." 'Aisha further said,
"Once the Prophet was screening me and I was watching the display of
black slaves in the Mosque and ('Umar) scolded them. The Prophet said,
'Leave them. O Bani Arfida! (carry on), you are safe (protected)'."
