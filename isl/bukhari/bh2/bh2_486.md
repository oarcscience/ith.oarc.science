### Hadith 2:485

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "(On the Day of Resurrection) camels will come to
their owner in the best state of health they have ever had (in the
world), and if he had not paid their Zakat (in the world) then they
would tread him with their feet; and similarly, sheep will come to their
owner in the best state of health they have ever had in the world, and
if he had not paid their Zakat, then they would tread him with their
hooves and would butt him with their horns." The Prophet added, "One of
their rights is that they should be milked while water is kept in front
of them." The Prophet added, "I do not want anyone of you to come to me
on the Day of Resurrection, carrying over his neck a sheep that will be
bleating. Such a person will (then) say, 'O Muhammad! (please intercede
for me,) I will say to him. 'I can't help you, for I conveyed Allah's
Message to you.' Similarly, I do not want anyone of you to come to me
carrying over his neck a camel that will be grunting. Such a person
(then) will say "O Muhammad! (please intercede for me)." I will say to
him, "I can't help you for I conveyed Allah's message to you."
