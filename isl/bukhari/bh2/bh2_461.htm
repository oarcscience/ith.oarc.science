<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:460</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</I></P>
The Prophet once passed by two graves and said, "They (the deceased 
persons in those graves) are being tortured not for a great thing to 
avoid." And then added, "Yes, (they are being punished for a big sin),
for one of them used to go about with calumnies while the other never 
saved himself from being soiled with his urine." (Ibn Abbas added): 
Then he took a green leaf of a date-palm) and split it into two pieces
and fixed one piece on each grave and said, "May their punishment be 
abated till these (two pieces) get dry."
