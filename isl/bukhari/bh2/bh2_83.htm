Al-Hajjaj went to Ibn  Umar while I was present there. Al-Hajjaj asked
Ibn Umar, "How are you?" Ibn  Umar replied, "I am all right," 
Al-Hajjaj asked, "Who wounded you?" Ibn Umar replied, "The person who 
allowed arms to be carried on the day on which it was forbidden to 
carry them (he meant Al-Hajjaj)"
