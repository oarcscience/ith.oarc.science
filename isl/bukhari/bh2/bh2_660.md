### Hadith 2:658

*Narrated 'Usama bin Zaid:*

I asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Where will you stay in Mecca? Will you stay
in your house in Mecca?" He replied, "Has 'Aqil left any property or
house?" Aqil along with Talib had inherited the property of Abu Talib.
Jafar and Ali did not inherit anything as they were Muslims and the
other two were non-believers. 'Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say, "A
believer cannot inherit (anything from an) infidel." Ibn Shihab, (a
sub-narrator) said, "They (Umar and others) derived the above verdict
from Allah's Statement: "Verily! those who believed and Emigrated and
strove with their life And property in Allah's Cause, And those who
helped (the emigrants) And gave them their places to live in, These are
(all) allies to one another." (8.72)
