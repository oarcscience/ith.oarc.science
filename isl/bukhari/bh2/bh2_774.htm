The Prophet offered four Rakat of Zuhr prayer at Medina; and two Rakat
of 'Asr prayer at Dhul-hulaifa and spent the night there and when (the
day) dawned, he mounted his Mount and started saying, "None has the 
right to be worshipped but Allah, and Glorified be Allah." When he 
reached Al-Baida' he recited Talbiya for both Hajj and 'Umra. And when
he arrived at Mecca, he ordered them (his companions) to finish their 
Ihram. The Prophet slaughtered seven Budn (camel) with his own hands 
while the camels were standing He also sacrificed two horned rams 
(black and white in color) at Medina.
