### Hadith 2:725

*Narrated Muhammad bin Jubair bin Mut'im:*

My father said, "(Before Islam) I was looking for my camel .." The same
narration is told by a different sub-narrator. Jubair bin Mut'im said,
"My camel was lost and I went out in search of it on the day of 'Arafat,
and I saw the Prophet standing in 'Arafat. I said to myself: By Allah he
is from the Hums (literally: strictly religious, Quraish were called so,
as they used to say, 'We are the people of Allah we shall not go out of
the sanctuary). What has brought him here?"
