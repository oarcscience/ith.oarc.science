### Hadith 2:730

*Narrated Usama bin Zaid*

rode behind Allah's Apostle from 'Arafat and when Allah's Apostle
reached the mountain pass on the left side which is before Al-Muzdalifa
he made his camel kneel and then urinated, and then I poured water for
his ablution. He performed light ablution and then I said to him: (Is it
the time for) the prayer, O Allah's Apostle!" He replied, "The (place
of) prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa)." So Allah's Apostle
rode till he reached Al-Muzdalifa and then he offered the prayer (there)
. Then in the morning (10th Dhul-Hijja) Al-Faql (bin Abbas) rode behind
Allah's Apostle. Kuraib, (a sub-narrator) said that 'Abdullah bin Abbas
narrated from Al-Fadl, "Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) kept on reciting
Talbiya (during the journey) till he reached the Jamra."
(Jamrat-al-Aqaba)
