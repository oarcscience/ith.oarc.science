### Hadith 2:84

*Narrated Said bin 'Amr bin Said bin Al-'Aas:*

Al-Hajjaj went to Ibn Umar while I was present there. Al-Hajjaj asked
Ibn Umar, "How are you?" Ibn Umar replied, "I am all right," Al-Hajjaj
asked, "Who wounded you?" Ibn Umar replied, "The person who allowed arms
to be carried on the day on which it was forbidden to carry them (he
meant Al-Hajjaj)"
