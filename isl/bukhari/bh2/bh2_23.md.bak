### Hadith 2:24

*Narrated Muhammad bin Sirin:*

On a rainy day Ibn Abbas said to his Muadh-dhin, "After saying,
'Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah' (I testify that Muhammad is
Allah's Apostle), do not say 'Haiya 'Alas-Salat' (come for the prayer)
but say 'Pray in your houses'." (The man did so). But the people
disliked it. Ibn Abbas said, "It was done by one who was much better
than I (i.e. the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ). No doubt, the Jumua prayer is
compulsory but I dislike to put you to task by bringing you out walking
in mud and slush."
