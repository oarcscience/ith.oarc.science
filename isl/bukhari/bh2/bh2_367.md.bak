### Hadith 2:366

*Narrated Khabbab:*

We emigrated with the Prophet (p.b.u.h) in Allah's cause, and so our
reward was then surely incumbent on Allah. Some of us died and they did
not take anything from their rewards in this world, and amongst them was
Mustab bin 'Umar; and the others were those who got their rewards.
Mustab bin 'Umar was martyred on the day of the Battle of Uhud and we
could get nothing except his Burd to shroud him in. And when we covered
his head his feet became bare and vice versa. So the Prophet ordered us
to cover his head only and to put idhkhir (a kind of shrub) over his
feet.
