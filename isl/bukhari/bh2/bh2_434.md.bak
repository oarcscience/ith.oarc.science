### Hadith 2:433

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

Allah's Apostle came to Abdullah bin Ubai (a hypocrite) after his death
and he has been laid in his pit (grave). He ordered (that he be taken
out of the grave) and he was taken out. Then he placed him on his knees
and threw some of his saliva on him and clothed him in his (the
Prophet's) own shirt. Allah knows better (why he did so). 'Abdullah bin
Ubai had given his shirt to Al-Abbas to wear. Abu Harun said, "Allah's
Apostle at that time had two shirts and the son of 'Abdullah bin Ubai
said to him, 'O Allah's Apostle! Clothe my father in your shirt which
has been in contact with your skin.' ' Sufyan added, "Thus people think
that the Prophet clothed 'Abdullah bin Tubal in his shirt in lieu of
what he (Abdullah) had done (for Al Abbas, the Prophet's uncle.)"
