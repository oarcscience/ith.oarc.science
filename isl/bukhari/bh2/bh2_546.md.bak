### Hadith 2:545

*Narrated 'Amr bin Al-Harith:*

Zainab, the wife of 'Abdullah said, "I was in the Mosque and saw the
Prophet (p.b.u.h) saying, 'O women ! Give alms even from your
ornaments.' " Zainab used to provide for 'Abdullah and those orphans who
were under her protection. So she said to 'Abdullah, "Will you ask
Allah's Apostle whether it will be sufficient for me to spend part of
the Zakat on you and the orphans who are under my protection?" He
replied "Will you yourself ask Allah's Apostle ?" (Zainab added): So I
went to the Prophet and I saw there an Ansari woman who was standing at
the door (of the Prophet ) with a similar problem as mine. Bilal passed
by us and we asked him, 'Ask the Prophet whether it is permissible for
me to spend (the Zakat) on my husband and the orphans under my
protection.' And we requested Bilal not to inform the Prophet about us.
So Bilal went inside and asked the Prophet regarding our problem. The
Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked, "Who are those two?" Bilal replied that she was
Zainab. The Prophet said, "Which Zainab?" Bilal said, "The wife of
'Adullah (bin Masud)." The Prophet said, "Yes, (it is sufficient for
her) and she will receive a double rewards (for that): One for helping
relatives, and the other for giving Zakat."
