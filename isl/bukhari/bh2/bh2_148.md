### Hadith 2:149

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "Keys of the unseen knowledge are five
which nobody knows but Allah . . . nobody knows what will happen
tomorrow; nobody knows what is in the womb; nobody knows what he will
gain tomorrow; nobody knows at what place he will die; and nobody knows
when it will rain."
