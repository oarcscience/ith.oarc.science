### Hadith 2:460

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

The Prophet once passed by two graves and said, "They (the deceased
persons in those graves) are being tortured not for a great thing to
avoid." And then added, "Yes, (they are being punished for a big sin),
for one of them used to go about with calumnies while the other never
saved himself from being soiled with his urine." (Ibn Abbas added): Then
he took a green leaf of a date-palm) and split it into two pieces and
fixed one piece on each grave and said, "May their punishment be abated
till these (two pieces) get dry."
