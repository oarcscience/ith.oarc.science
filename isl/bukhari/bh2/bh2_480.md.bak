A man said to the Prophet "Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter
Paradise." The people said, "What is the matter with him? What is the
matter with him?" The Prophet said, "He has something to ask. (What he
needs greatly) The Prophet said: (In order to enter Paradise) you should
worship Allah and do not ascribe any partners to Him, offer prayer
perfectly, pay the Zakat and keep good relations with your Kith and
kin." (See Hadith No. 12, Vol 8).
