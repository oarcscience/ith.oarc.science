### Hadith 2:133

*Narrated Masruq:*

One day I went to Ibn Masud who said, "When Quraish delayed in embracing
Islam, the Prophet I invoked Allah to curse them, so they were afflicted
with a (famine) year because of which many of them died and they ate the
carcasses and Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and said, 'O Muhammad! You
came to order people to keep good relation with kith and kin and your
nation is being destroyed, so invoke Allah I ? So the Prophet I recited
the Holy verses of Sirat-Ad-Dukhan: 'Then watch you For the day that The
sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible.' (44.10) When the
famine was taken off, the people renegade once again as nonbelievers.
The statement of Allah, (in Sura "Ad-Dukhan"-44) refers to that: 'On the
day when We shall seize You with a mighty grasp.' (44.16) And that was
what happened on the day of the battle of Badr." Asbath added on the
authority of Mansur, "Allah's Apostle prayed for them and it rained
heavily for seven days. So the people complained of the excessive rain.
The Prophet said, 'O Allah! (Let it rain) around us and not on us.' So
the clouds dispersed over his head and it rained over the surroundings."
