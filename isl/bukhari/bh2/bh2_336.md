### Hadith 2:334

*Narrated Kharija bin Zaid bin Thabit:*

Um Al-'Ala', an Ansari woman who gave the pledge of allegiance to the
Prophet said to me, "The emigrants were distributed amongst us by
drawing lots and we got in our share 'Uthman bin Maz'un. We made him
stay with us in our house. Then he suffered from a disease which proved
fatal when he died and was given a bath and was shrouded in his clothes,
Allah's Apostle came I said, 'May Allah be merciful to you, O Abu
As-Sa'ib! I testify that Allah has honored you'. The Prophet said, 'How
do you know that Allah has honored him?' I replied, 'O Allah's Apostle!
Let my father be sacrificed for you! On whom else shall Allah bestow His
honor?' The Prophet said, 'No doubt, death came to him. By Allah, I too
wish him good, but by Allah, I do not know what Allah will do with me
though I am Al lah's Apostle. ' By Allah, I never attested the piety of
anyone after that."
