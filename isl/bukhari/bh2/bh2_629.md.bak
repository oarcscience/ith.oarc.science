### Hadith 2:627

*Narrated Aisha:*

(the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) We set out with the Prophet in his
last Hajj and we assumed Ihram for Umra. The Prophet then said, "Whoever
has the Hadi with him should assume Ihram for Hajj along with 'Umra and
should not finish the Ihram till he finishes both." I was menstruating
when I reached Mecca, and so I neither did Tawaf round the Ka'ba nor
Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. I complained about that to the Prophet on
which he replied, "Undo and comb your head hair, and assume Ihram for
Hajj (only) and leave the Umra." So, I did so. When we had performed the
Hajj, the Prophet sent me with my brother 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to
Tan'im. So I performed the 'Umra. The Prophet said to me, "This 'Umra is
instead of your missed one." Those who had assumed Ihram for 'Umra
(Hajj-atTamattu) performed Tawaf round the Ka'ba and between Safa and
Marwa and then finished their Ihram. After returning from Mina, they
performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa). Those who had assumed
Ihram for Hajj and 'Umra together (Hajj-al-Qiran) performed only one
Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).
