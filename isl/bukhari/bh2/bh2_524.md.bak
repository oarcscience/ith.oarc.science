### Hadith 2:523

*Narrated Abu Huraira :*

The Prophet said, "The example of a miser and an alms-giver is like the
example of two persons wearing iron cloaks." Allah's Apostle also said,
"The example of an alms-giver and a miser is like the example of two
persons who have two iron cloaks on them from their breasts to their
collar bones, and when the alms-giver wants to give in charity, the
cloak becomes capacious till it covers his whole body to such an extent
that it hides his fingertips and covers his footprints (obliterates his
tracks). (1) And when the miser wants to spend, it (the iron cloak)
sticks and every ring gets stuck to its place and he tries to widen it,
but it did not become wide.
