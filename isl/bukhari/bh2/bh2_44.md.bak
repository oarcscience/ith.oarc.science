### Hadith 2:45

*Narrated 'Amr bin Taghlib:*

Some property or something was brought to Allah's Apostle and he
distributed it. He gave to some men and ignored the others. Later he got
the news of his being admonished by those whom he had ignored. So he
glorified and praised Allah and said, "Amma ba'du. By Allah, I may give
to a man and ignore another, although the one whom I ignore is more
beloved to me than the one whom I give. But I give to some people as I
feel that they have no patience and no contentment in their hearts and I
leave those who are patient and self-contented with the goodness and
wealth which Allah has put into their hearts and 'Amr bin Taghlib is one
of them." Amr added, By Allah! Those words of Allah's Apostle are more
beloved to me than the best red camels.
