### Hadith 2:59

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Umar:*

Allah's Apostle used to pray two Rakat before the Zuhr prayer and two
Rakat after it. He also used to pray two Rakat after the Maghrib prayer
in his house, and two Rakat after the 'Isha' prayer. He never prayed
after Jumua prayer till he departed (from the Mosque), and then he would
pray two Rakat at home.
