<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 2:708</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amr bin Dinar:</I></P>
We asked Ibn 'Umar whether a man who, while performing 'Umra, had 
performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba; and had not yet performed Tawaf between 
Safa and Marwa, could have sexual relation with his wife, Ibn 'Umar 
replied "The Prophet (p.b.u.h) reached Mecca and performed the seven 
rounds (of Tawaf) of the Ka'ba and then offered a two-Rakat prayer 
behind Maqam ibrahim and then performed the seven rounds (of Tawaf) 
between Safa and Marwa." He added, "Verily! In Allah's Apostle 
(p.b.u.h) you have a good example." We asked Jabir bin 'Abdullah (the 
same question) and he said, "He (that man) should not come near (his 
wife) till he has completed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa."
