### Hadith 2:18

*Narrated Ibn Umar:*

I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "All of you are Guardians." Yunis said:
Ruzaiq bin Hukaim wrote to Ibn Shihab while I was with him at
Wadi-al-Qura saying, "Shall I lead the Jumua prayer?" Ruzaiq was working
on the land (i.e farming) and there was a group of Sudanese people and
some others with him; Ruzaiq was then the Governor of Aila. Ibn Shihab
wrote (to Ruzaiq) ordering him to lead the Jumua prayer and telling him
that Salim told him that 'Abdullah bin 'Umar had said, "I heard Allah's
Apostle saying, 'All of you are guardians and responsible for your wards
and the things under your care. The Imam (i.e. ruler) is the guardian of
his subjects and is responsible for them and a man is the guardian of
his family and is responsible for them. A woman is the guardian of her
husband's house and is responsible for it. A servant is the guardian of
his master's belongings and is responsible for them.' I thought that he
also said, 'A man is the guardian of his father's property and is
responsible for it. All of you are guardians and responsible for your
wards and the things under your care."
