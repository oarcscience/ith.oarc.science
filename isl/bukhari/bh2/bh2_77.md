### Hadith 2:78

*Narrated Ibn Juraij:*

'Ata' said, "Jabir bin 'Abdullah said, 'The Prophet went out on the Day
of 'Id-ul-Fitr and offered the prayer before delivering the Khutba, Ata
told me that during the early days of IbnAz-Zubair, Ibn Abbas had sent a
message to him telling him that the Adhan for the 'Id Prayer was never
pronounced (in the life time of Allah's Apostle) and the Khutba used to
be delivered after the prayer. Ata told me that Ibn Abbas and Jabir bin
'Abdullah, had said, - where was no Adhan for the prayer of '7d-ul-Fitr
and 'Id-ul-Aqha." 'At a' said, "I heard Jabir bin 'Abdullah saying, 'The
Prophet stood up and started with the prayer, and after it he delivered
the Khutba. When the Prophet of Allah (p.b.u.h) finished (the Khutba),
he went to the women and preached to them, while he was leaning on
Bilal's hand. Bilal was spreading his garment and the ladies were
putting alms in it.' " I said to Ata, "Do you think it incumbent upon an
Imam to go to the women and preach to them after finishing the prayer
and Khutba?" 'Ata' said, "No doubt it is incumbent on Imams to do so,
and why should they not do so?"
