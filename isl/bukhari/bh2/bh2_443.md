*Narrated Said bin Al-Musaiyab from his father:*

When the time of the death of Abu Talib approached, Allah's Apostle went
to him and found Abu Jahl bin Hisham and 'Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya bin

which I shall be a witness (i.e. argue) for you before Allah. Abu Jahl
and 'Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said, "O Abu Talib! Are you going to
denounce the religion of Abdul Muttalib?" Allah's Apostle kept on
inviting Abu Talib to say it (i.e. 'None has the right to be worshipped
but Allah') while they (Abu Jahl and Abdullah) kept on repeating their
statement till Abu Talib said as his last statement that he was on the
religion of Abdul Muttalib and refused to say, 'None has the right to be
worshipped but Allah.' (Then Allah's Apostle said, "I will keep on
asking Allah's forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Allah) to
do so." So Allah revealed (the verse) concerning him (i.e. It is not
