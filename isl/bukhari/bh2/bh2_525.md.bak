### Hadith 2:524

*Narrated Abu Burda:*

from his father from his grandfather that the Prophet said, "Every
Muslim has to give in charity." The people asked, "O Allah's Prophet! If
someone has nothing to give, what will he do?" He said, "He should work
with his hands and benefit himself and also give in charity (from what
he earns)." The people further asked, "If he cannot find even that?" He
replied, "He should help the needy who appeal for help." Then the people
asked, "If he cannot do that?" He replied, "Then he should perform good
deeds and keep away from evil deeds and this will be regarded as
charitable deeds."
