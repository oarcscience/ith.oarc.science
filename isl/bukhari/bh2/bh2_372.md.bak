### Hadith 2:371

*Narrated Zainab bint Abi Salama :*

I went to Um Habiba, the wife of Prophet, who said, "I heard the
Prophets saying, 'It is not legal for a woman who believes in Allah and
the Last Day to mourn for any dead person for more than three days
except for her husband, (for whom she should mourn) for four months and
ten days'." Later I went to Zainab bint Jahsh when her brother died; she
asked for some scent, and after using it she said, "I am not in need of
scent but I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'It is not legal for a woman
who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days
for any dead person except her husband, (for whom she should mourn) for
four months and ten days.' "
