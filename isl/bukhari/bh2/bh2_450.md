### Hadith 2:449

*Narrated Abu Al-Aswad:*

I came to Medina when an epidemic had broken out. While I was sitting
with 'Umar bin Al-Khattab a funeral procession passed by and the people
praised the deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been affirmed to him." And
another funeral procession passed by and the people praised the
deceased. 'Umar said, "It has been affirmed to him." A third (funeral
procession) passed by and the people spoke badly of the deceased. He
said, "It has been affirmed to him." I (Abu Al-Aswad) asked, "O chief of
the believers! What has been affirmed?" He replied, "I said the same as
the Prophet had said, that is: if four persons testify the piety of a
Muslim, Allah will grant him Paradise." We asked, "If three persons
testify his piety?" He (the Prophet) replied, "Even three." Then we
asked, "If two?" He replied, "Even two." We did not ask him regarding
one witness.
