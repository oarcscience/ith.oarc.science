### Hadith 2:757

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abu Bakr bin 'Amr bin Hazm*

that 'Amra bint 'Abdur-Rahman had told him, "Zaid bin Abu Sufyan wrote
to 'Aisha that 'Abdullah bin Abbas had stated, 'Whoever sends his Hadi
(to the Ka'ba), all the things which are illegal for a (pilgrim) become
illegal for that person till he slaughters it (i.e. till the 10th of
Dhul-Hijja).' " 'Amra added, 'Aisha said, 'It is not like what Ibn Abbas
had said: I twisted the garlands of the Hadis of Allah's Apostle with my
own hands. Then Allah's Apostle put them round their necks with his own
hands, sending them with my father; Yet nothing permitted by Allah was
considered illegal for Allah's Apostle till he slaughtered the Hadis.' "
