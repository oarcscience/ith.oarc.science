### Hadith 2:503

*Narrated Ma'n bin Yazid:*

My grandfather, my father and I gave the pledge of allegiance to Allah's
Apostle. The Prophet got me engaged and then got me married. One day I
went to the Prophet with a complaint. My father Yazid had taken some
gold coins for charity and kept them with a man in the mosque (to give
them to the poor) But I went and took them and brought them to him (my
father). My father said, "By Allah! I did not intend to give them to
you. " I took (the case) to Allah's Apostle . On that Allah's Apostle
said, "O Yazid! You will be rewarded for what you intended. O Man!
Whatever you have taken is yours."
