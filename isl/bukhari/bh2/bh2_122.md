### Hadith 2:123

*Narrated Anas:*

Whenever drought threatened them, 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, used to ask
Al-Abbas bin 'Abdul Muttalib to invoke Allah for rain. He used to say,
"O Allah! We used to ask our Prophet to invoke You for rain, and You
would bless us with rain, and now we ask his uncle to invoke You for
rain. O Allah ! Bless us with rain."(1) And so it would rain.
