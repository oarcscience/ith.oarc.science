### Hadith 2:319

*Narrated Abu Huraira.*

Once Allah's Apostle offered two Rakat and finished his prayer. So
Dhul-Yadain asked him, "Has the prayer been reduced or have you
forgotten?" Allah's Apostle said, "Has DhulYadain spoken the truth?" The
people replied in the affirmative. Then Allah's Apostle stood up and
offered the remaining two Rakat and performed Taslim, and then said
Takbir and performed two prostrations like his usual prostrations, or a
bit longer, and then got up.
