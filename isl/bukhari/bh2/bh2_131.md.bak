### Hadith 2:132

*Narrated Anas bin Malik*

A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Livestock
are destroyed and the roads are cut off; so please invoke Allah." So
Allah's Apostle prayed for rain and it rained from that Friday till the
next Friday. Then a man came to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and said, "O
Allah's Apostle! The houses have collapsed, roads are cut off and the
livestock are destroyed." So Allah's Apostle said, "O Allah ! (Let it
rain) on the tops of the mountains, on the plateaus, in the valleys and
over the places where trees grow." So the clouds cleared away from
Medina as clothes are taken off.
