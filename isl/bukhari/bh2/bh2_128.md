### Hadith 2:129

*Narrated Anas:*

A man came to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and said, "Livestock are destroyed
and the roads are cut off." So Allah's Apostle invoked Allah for rain
and it rained from that Friday till the next Friday. The same person
came again and said, "Houses have collapsed, roads are cut off, and the
livestock are destroyed. Please pray to Allah to withhold the rain."
Allah's Apostle (stood up and) said, "O Allah! (Let it rain) on the
plateaus, on the hills, in the valleys and over the places where trees
grow." So the clouds cleared away from Medina as clothes are taken off .
