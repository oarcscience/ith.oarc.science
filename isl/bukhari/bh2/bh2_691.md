### Hadith 2:689

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

In the year prior to the last Hajj of the Prophet when Allahs Apostle
made Abu Bakr the leader of the pilgrims, the latter (Abu Bakr) sent me
in the company of a group of people to make a public announcement: 'No
pagan is allowed to perform Hajj after this year, and no naked person is
allowed to perform Tawaf of the Kaba.' (See Hadith No. 365 Vol. 1)
