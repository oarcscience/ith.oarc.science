### Hadith 2:64

*Narrated Shu'aib:*

I asked Az-Zuhri, "Did the Prophet ever offer the Fear Prayer?" Az-Zuhri
said, "I was told by Salim that 'Abdullah bin Umar I had said, 'I took
part in a holy battle with Allah's Apostle I in Najd. We faced the enemy
and arranged ourselves in rows. Then Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) stood up
to lead the prayer and one party stood to pray with him while the other
faced the enemy. Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) and the former party bowed
and performed two prostrations. Then that party left and took the place
of those who had not prayed. Allah's Apostle prayed one Raka (with the
latter) and performed two prostrations and finished his prayer with
Taslim. Then everyone of them bowed once and performed two prostrations
individually.' "
