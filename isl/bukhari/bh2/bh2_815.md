### Hadith 2:813

*Narrated 'Ikrima:*

The people of Medina asked Ibn Abbas about a woman who got her menses
after performing Tawaf-al-Ifada. He said, "She could depart (from
Mecca)." They said, "We will not act on your verdict and ignore the
verdict of Zaid." Ibn Abbas said, "When you reach Medina, inquire about
it." So, when they reached Medina they asked (about that). One of those
whom they asked was Um Sulaim. She told them the narration of Safiya
(812).
