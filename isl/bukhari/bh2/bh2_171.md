### Hadith 2:172

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) recited (the Quran) aloud during the eclipse
prayer and when he had finished the eclipse prayer he said the Takbir
and bowed. When he stood straight from bowing he would say "Sami
'al-l-ahu Lyman hamidah Rabbana walaka-l-hamd." And he would again start
reciting. In the eclipse prayer there are four bowing and four
prostrations in two Rakat. Al-Auza'i and others said that they had heard
Az-Zuhi from 'Ursa from 'Aisha saying, "In the life-time of Allah's
Apostle the sun eclipsed, and he made a person to announce: 'Prayer in
congregation.' He led the prayer and performed four bowing 'Abdur-Rahman
bin Namir had informed him that he had heard the same. Ibn Shihab heard
the same. Az-Zuhrl said, "I asked ('Ursa), 'What did your brother
'Abdullah bin AzZubair do? He prayed two Rakat (of the eclipse prayer)
like the morning prayer, when he offered the (eclipse) prayer in
Median.' 'Ursa replied that he had missed (i.e. did not pray according
to) the Prophet's tradition." Sulaiman bin Kathir and Sufyan bin Husain
narrated from Az-Zuhri that the prayer for the eclipse used to be
offered with loud recitation.
