Allah's Apostle used to pray eleven Rakat at night and that was his 
night prayer and each of his prostrations lasted for a period enough 
for one of you to recite fifty verses before Allah's Apostle raised 
his head. He also used to pray two Rakat (Sunna) before the 
(compulsory) Fajr prayer and then lie down on his right side till the 
Muadh-dhin came to him for the prayer.
