### Hadith 3:34

*Narrated Nafi:*

That Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah and Salim bin 'Abdullah informed him that
they told Ibn 'Umar when Ibn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, saying
"There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajj this year. We are
afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Kaba." Ibn 'Umar said
"We set out with Allah's Apostle and the non-believers of Quraish
prevented us from reaching the Ka'ba, and so the Prophet slaughtered his
Hadi and got his head shaved." Ibn 'Umar added, "I make you witnesses
that I have made 'Umra obligatory for me. And, Allah willing, I will go
and then if the way to Ka'ba is clear, I will perform the Tawaf, but if
I am prevented from going to the Ka'ba then I will do the same as the
Prophet did while I was in his company." Ibn 'Umar then assumed Ihram
for Umra from Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for a while and said, "The
conditions of 'Umra and Hajj are similar and I make you witnesses that I
have made 'Umra and Hajj obligatory for myself." So, he did not finish
the Ihram till the day of Nahr (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered
his Hadi. He used to say, "I will not finish the Ihram till I perform
the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the day of entering Mecca (i.e. of Safa and
Marwa for both 'Umra and Hajj)."
