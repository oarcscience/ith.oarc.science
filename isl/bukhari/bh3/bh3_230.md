### Hadith 3:233

*Narrated Abu Salama:*

I asked Abu Sa'id, and he was a friend of mine, (about the Night of
Qadr) and he said, "We practiced Itikaf (seclusion in the mosque) in the
middle third of the month of Ramadan with the Prophet . In the morning
of the 20th of Ramadan, the Prophet came and addressed us and said, 'I
was informed of (the date of the Night of Qadr) but I was caused to
forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of
the month of Ramadan. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and
water (as a sign). So, whoever was in l'tikaf with me should return to
it with me (for another 10-day's period)', and we returned. At that time
there was no sign of clouds in the sky but suddenly a cloud came and it
rained till rain-water started leaking through the roof of the mosque
which was made of date-palm leaf stalks. Then the prayer was established
and I saw Allah's Apostle prostrating in mud and water and I saw the
traces of mud on his forehead."
