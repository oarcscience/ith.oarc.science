### Hadith 3:58

*Narrated Said bin Abu Said Al-Maqburi:*

Abu Shuraih, Al-'Adawi said that he had said to 'Amr bin Sa'id when he
was sending the troops to Mecca (to fight 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair), "O
Chief! Allow me to tell you what Allah's Apostle said on the day
following the Conquest of Mecca. My ears heard that and my heart
understood it thoroughly and I saw with my own eyes the Prophet when he,
after Glorifying and Praising Allah, started saying, 'Allah, not the
people, made Mecca a sanctuary, so anybody who has belief in Allah and
the Last Day should neither shed blood in it, nor should he cut down its
trees. If anybody tells (argues) that fighting in it is permissible on
the basis that Allah's Apostle did fight in Mecca, say to him, 'Allah
allowed His Apostle and did not allow you.' "Allah allowed me only for a
few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today its sanctity is valid
as it was before. So, those who are present should inform those who are
absent (concerning this fact." Abu Shuraih was asked, "What did 'Amr
reply?" He said, ('Amr said) 'O Abu Shuraih! I know better than you in
this respect Mecca does not give protection to a sinner, a murderer or a
thief."
