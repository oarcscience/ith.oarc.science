### Hadith 3:318

*Narrated Aisha:*

(mother of the faithful believers) I bought a cushion with pictures on
it. When Allah's Apostle saw it, he kept standing at the door and did
not enter the house. I noticed the sign of disgust on his face, so I
said, "O Allah's Apostle! I repent to Allah and H is Apostle . (Please
let me know) what sin I have done." Allah's Apostle said, "What about
this cushion?" I replied, "I bought it for you to sit and recline on."
Allah's Apostle said, "The painters (i.e. owners) of these pictures will
be punished on the Day of Resurrection. It will be said to them, 'Put
life in what you have created (i.e. painted).' " The Prophet added, "The
angels do not enter a house where there are pictures."
