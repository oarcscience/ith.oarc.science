### Hadith 3:489

*Narrated Said bin Jubair:*

Ibn Abbas said, "In the verse: To every one We have appointed '
(Muwaliya Mawaliya means one's) heirs (4.33).' (And regarding the verse)
'And those with whom your right hands have made a pledge.' Ibn 'Abbas
said, "When the emigrants came to the Prophet in Medina, the emigrant
would inherit the Ansari while the latter's relatives would not inherit
him because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet established
between them (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar). When the verse: 'And to
everyone We have appointed heirs' (4.33) was revealed, it cancelled (the
bond (the pledge) of brotherhood regarding inheritance)." Then he said,
"The verse: To those also to whom your right hands have pledged,
remained valid regarding co-operation and mutual advice, while the
matter of inheritance was excluded and it became permissible to assign
something in one's testament to the person who had the right of
inheriting before.
