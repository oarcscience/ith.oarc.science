### Hadith 3:249

*Narrated 'Amra:*

Aisha said, "the Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of
Ramadan and I used to pitch a tent for him, and after offering the
morning prayer, he used to enter the tent." Hafsa asked the permission
of 'Aisha to pitch a tent for her and she allowed her and she pitched
her tent. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw it, she pitched another tent. In
the morning the Prophet noticed the tents. He said, 'What is this?" He
was told of the whole situation. Then the Prophet said, "Do you think
that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?" He therefore
abandoned the Itikaf in that month and practiced Itikaf for ten days in
the month of Shawwal."
