### Hadith 3:438

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

I heard Allah's Apostle, in the year of the Conquest of Mecca, saying,
"Allah and His Apostle made illegal the trade of alcohol, dead animals,
pigs and idols." The people asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What about the
fat of dead animals, for it was used for greasing the boats and the
hides; and people use it for lights?" He said, "No, it is illegal."
Allah's Apostle further said, "May Allah curse the Jews, for Allah made
the fat (of animals) illegal for them, yet they melted the fat and sold
it and ate its price."
