### Hadith 3:739

*Narrated 'Abdul Wahid bin Aiman:*

I went to 'Aisha and said, "I was the slave of Utba bin Abu Lahab. "Utba
died and his sons became my masters who sold me to Ibn Abu Amr who
manumitted me. The sons of 'Utba stipulated that my Wala' should be for
them." 'Aisha said, "Buraira came to me and she was given the writing of
emancipation by her masters and she asked me to buy and manumit her. I
agreed to it, but Buraira told me that her masters would not sell her
unless her Wala' was for them." 'Aisha said, "I am not in need of that."
When the Prophet heard that, or he was told about it, he asked 'Aisha
about it. 'Aisha mentioned what Buraira had told her. The Prophet said,
"Buy and manumit her and let them stipulate whatever they like." So,
'Aisha bought and manumitted her and her masters stipulated that her
Wala' should be for them." The Prophet;, said, "The Wala' will be for
the liberator even if they stipulated a hundred conditions."
