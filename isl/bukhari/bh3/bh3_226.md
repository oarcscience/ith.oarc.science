### Hadith 3:229

*Narrated 'Ursa:*

That he was informed by 'Aisha, "Allah's Apostle went out in the middle
of the night and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed behind him. In
the morning, the people spoke about it and then a large number of them
gathered and prayed behind him (on the second night). In the next
morning the people again talked about it and on the third night the
mosque was full with a large number of people. Allah's Apostle came out
and the people prayed behind him. On the fourth night the Mosque was
overwhelmed with people and could not accommodate them, but the Prophet
came out (only) for the morning prayer. When the morning prayer was
finished he recited Tashah-hud and (addressing the people) said, "Amma
ba'du, your presence was not hidden from me but I was afraid lest the
night prayer (Qiyam) should be enjoined on you and you might not be able
to carry it on." So, Allah's Apostle died and the situation remained
like that (i.e. people prayed individually). "
