### Hadith 3:873

*Narrated Abdullah bin Kab:*

That Ka'b bin Malik told him that in the lifetime of Allah's Apostle he
demanded his debt from Ibn Abu Hadrad in the Mosque. Their voices grew
louder till Allah's Apostle heard them while he was in his house. So he
lifted the curtain of his room and called Ka'b bin Malik saying, "O
Ka'b!" He replied, "Labbaik! O Allah's Apostle!" He beckoned to him with
his hand suggesting that he deduct half the debt. Ka'b said, "I agree, O
Allah's Apostle!" Allah's Apostle then said (to Ibn Abu Hadrad), "Get up
and pay him the rest."
