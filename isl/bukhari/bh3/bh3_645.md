### Hadith 3:646

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "A man felt very thirsty while he was on the way,
there he came across a well. He went down the well, quenched his thirst
and came out. Meanwhile he saw a dog panting and licking mud because of
excessive thirst. He said to himself, "This dog is suffering from thirst
as I did." So, he went down the well again and filled his shoe with
water and watered it. Allah thanked him for that deed and forgave him.
The people said, "O Allah's Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving
the animals?" He replied: "Yes, there is a reward for serving any
animate (living being)." (See Hadith No. 551)
