### Hadith 3:403

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Allah's Apostle forbade the sale of fruits till they are almost ripe. He
was asked what is meant by 'are almost ripe.' He replied, "Till they
become red." Allah's Apostle further said, "If Allah spoiled the fruits,
what right would one have to take the money of one's brother (i.e. other
people)?"

is evident and then the fruits were spoiled with blights, the loss would
be suffered by the owner (not the buyer).

not sell or buy fruits before their benefit was evident and do not sell
fresh fruits (dates) for dried dates."
