<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:294</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Said:</I></P>
We used to be given mixed dates (from the booty) and used to sell 
(barter) two Sas of those dates) for one Sa (of good dates). The 
Prophet said (to us), "No (bartering of) two Sas for one Sa nor two 
Dirhams for one Dirham is permissible", (as that is a kind of usury). 
(See Hadith No. 405).
