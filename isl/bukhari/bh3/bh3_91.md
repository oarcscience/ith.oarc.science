### Hadith 3:94

*Narrated 'Ali:*

We have nothing except the Book of Allah and this written paper from the
Prophet (where-in is written:) Medina is a sanctuary from the 'Air
Mountain to such and such a place, and whoever innovates in it an heresy
or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it will incur
the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, none of his
compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And the
asylum (of protection) granted by any Muslim is to be secured
(respected) by all the other Muslims; and whoever betrays a Muslim in
this respect incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people,
and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be
accepted, and whoever (freed slave) befriends (take as masters) other
than his manumitters without their permission incurs the curse of Allah,
the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional
good deeds of worship will be accepted.
