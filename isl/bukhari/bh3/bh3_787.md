### Hadith 3:788

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

Umar saw a silken cloak over a man for sale and requested the Prophet to
buy it in order to wear it on Fridays and while meeting delegates. The
Prophet said, "This is worn by the one who will have no share in the
Hereafter." Later on Allah's Apostle got some silken cloaks similar to
that one, and he sent one to 'Umar. 'Umar said to the Prophet "How can I
wear it, while you said about it what you said?" The Prophet said, "I
have not given it to you to wear, but to sell or to give to someone
else." So, 'Umar sent it to his brother at Mecca before he embraced
Islam.
