### Hadith 3:608

*Narrated Ubai bin Ka'b:*

I found a purse containing one hundred Diners. So I went to the Prophet
(and informed him about it), he said, "Make public announcement about it
for one year" I did so, but nobody turned up to claim it, so I again
went to the Prophet who said, "Make public announcement for another
year." I did, but none turned up to claim it. I went to him for the
third time and he said, "Keep the container and the string which is used
for its tying and count the money it contains and if its owner comes,
give it to him; otherwise, utilize it."

The sub-narrator Salama said, "I met him (Suwaid, another sub-narrator)
in Mecca and he said, 'I don't know whether Ubai made the announcement
for three years or just one year.' "
