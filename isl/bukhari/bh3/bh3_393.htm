<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:396</H3><P><I>Narrated Sahl bin Abu Hathma:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle forbade the selling of fruits (fresh dates) for dried 
dates but allowed the sale of fruits on the 'Araya by estimation and 
their new owners might eat their dates fresh. Sufyan (in another 
narration) said, "I told Yahya (a sub-narrator) when I was a mere boy,
'Meccans say that the Prophet allowed them the sale of the fruits on 
'Araya by estimation.' Yahya asked, 'How do the Meccans know about 
it?' I replied, 'They narrated it (from the Prophet ) through Jabir.' 
On that, Yahya kept quiet." Sufyan said, "I meant that Jabir belonged 
to Medina." Sufyan was asked whether in Jabir's narration there was 
any prohibition of selling fruits before their benefit is evident 
(i.e. no dangers of being spoilt or blighted). He replied that there 
was none.
