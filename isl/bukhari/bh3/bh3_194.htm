<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:197</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle was informed that I had taken an oath to fast daily 
and to pray (every night) all the night throughout my life (so Allah's
Apostle came to me and asked whether it was correct): I replied, "Let 
my parents be sacrificed for you! I said so." The Prophet said, "You 
can not do that. So, fast for few days and give it up for few days, r 
ray and sleep. Fast three days a month as the reward of good deeds is 
multiplied ten times and that will be equal to one year of fasting." I
replied, "I can do better than that." The Prophet said to me, "Fast 
one day and give up fasting for a day and that is the fasting of 
Prophet David and that is the best fasting." I said, "I have the power
to fast better (more) than that." The Prophet said, "There is no 
better fasting than that."
