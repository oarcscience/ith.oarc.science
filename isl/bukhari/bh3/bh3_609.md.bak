### Hadith 3:610

*Narrated Sulaiman bin Bilal from Yahya:*

Yazid Maula Al-Munba'ith heard Zaid bin Khalid al-Juham saying, "The
Prophet was asked about Luqata. He said, 'Remember the description of
its container and the string it is tied with, and announce it publicly
for one year.' " Yazid added, "If nobody claims then the person who has
found it can spend it, and it is regarded as a trust entrusted to him."
Yahya said, "I do not know whether the last sentences were said by the
Prophet or by Yazid." Zaid further said, "The Prophet was asked, 'What
about a lost sheep?' The Prophet said, 'Take it, for it is for you or
for your brother (i.e. its owner) or for the wolf." Yazid added that it
should also be announced publicly. The man then asked the Prophet about
a lost camel. The Prophet said, "Leave it, as it has its feet, water
container (reservoir), and it will reach a place of water and eat trees
till its owner finds it."
