### Hadith 3:611

*Narrated Zaid bin Khalid:*

A man came and asked Allah's Apostle about picking a lost thing. The
Prophet said, "Remember the description of its container and the string
it is tied with, and make public announcement about it for one year. If
the owner shows up, give it to him; otherwise, do whatever you like with
it." He then asked, "What about a lost sheep?" The Prophet said, "It is
for you, for your brother (i.e. its owner), or for the wolf." He further
asked, "What about a lost camel?" The Prophet said, "It is none of your
concern. It has its water-container (reservoir) and its feet, and it
will reach water and drink it and eat the trees till its owner finds
it."
