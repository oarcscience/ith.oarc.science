*Narrated Khabbab:*

I was a blacksmith in the Pre-lslamic period, and 'Asi bin Wail owed me
some money, so I went to him to demand it. He said (to me), "I will not

and I will pay you your debt." On that occasion it was revealed to the
Prophet:

'Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our signs and says: Surely I will
be given wealth and children? Has he known the unseen, or has he taken a
