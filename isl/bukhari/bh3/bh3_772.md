### Hadith 3:773

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

My father was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud and his
creditors demanded the debt back in a harsh manner. So I went to Allah's
Apostle and informed him of that, he asked them to accept the fruits of
my garden and excuse my father, but they refused. So, Allah's Apostle
did not give them the fruits, nor did he cut them and distribute them
among them, but said, "I will come to you tomorrow morning." So, he came
to us the next morning and walked about in between the date-palms and
invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I plucked the fruits and gave back
all the rights of the creditors in full, and a lot of fruits were left
for us. Then I went to Allah's Apostle, who was sitting, and informed
him about what happened. Allah's Apostle told 'Umar, who was sitting
there, to listen to the story. 'Umar said, "Don't we know that you are
Allah's Apostle? By Allah! you are Allah's Apostle!"
