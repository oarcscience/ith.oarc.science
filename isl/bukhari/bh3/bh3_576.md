### Hadith 3:577

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

A man came to the Prophet and demanded a camel (the Prophet owed him).
Allah's Apostle told his companions to give him (a camel). They said,
"We do not find except an older camel (than what he demands). (The
Prophet ordered them to give him that camel). The man said, "You have
paid me in full and may Allah also pay you in full." Allah's Apostle
said, "Give him, for the best amongst the people is he who repays his
debts in the most handsome manner."
