### Hadith 3:699

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever manumits his share of a slave, then it is
essential for him to get that slave manumitted' completely as long as he
has the money to do so. If he has not sufficient money to pay the price
of the other shares (after the price of the slave is evaluated justly),
the manumitted manumits the slave partially in proportion to his share.
