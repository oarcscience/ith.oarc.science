### Hadith 3:303

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Allah made Mecca a sanctuary and it was neither
permitted for anyone before, nor will it be permitted for anyone after
me (to fight in it). And fighting in it was made legal for me for a few
hours of a day only. None is allowed to uproot its thorny shrubs or to
cut down its trees or to chase its game or to pick up its Luqata (fallen
things) except by a person who would announce it publicly." 'Abbas bin
'Abdul-Muttlib requested the Prophet, "Except Al-Idhkhir, for our
goldsmiths and for the roofs of our houses." The Prophet said, "Except
Al-Idhkhir." 'Ikrima said, "Do you know what is meant by chasing its
game? It is to drive it out of the shade and sit in its place." Khalid
said, "('Abbas said: Al-Idhkhir) for our goldsmiths and our graves."
