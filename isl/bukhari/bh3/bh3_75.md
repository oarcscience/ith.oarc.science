A woman from the tribe of Juhaina came to the Prophet and said, "My
mother had vowed to perform Hajj but she died before performing it. May
I perform Hajj on my mother's behalf?" The Prophet replied, "Perform
Hajj on her behalf. Had there been a debt on your mother, would you have
paid it or not? So, pay Allah's debt as He has more right to be paid."
