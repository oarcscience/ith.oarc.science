### Hadith 3:84

*Narrated Aisha (mother of the faithful believers):*

I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Shouldn't we participate in Holy battles and
Jihad along with you?" He replied, "The best and the most superior Jihad
(for women) is Hajj which is accepted by Allah." 'Aisha added: Ever
since I heard that from Allah's Apostle I have determined not to miss
Hajj.
