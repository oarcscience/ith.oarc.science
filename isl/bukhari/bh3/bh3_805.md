Allah's Apostle and Ubai bin Kab Al-Ansari went to the garden where Ibn
Saiyad used to live. When Allah's Apostle entered (the garden), he (i.e.
Allah's Apostle ) started hiding himself behind the datepalms as he
wanted to hear secretly the talk of Ibn Saiyad before the latter saw

of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad saying, "O Saf, this is
Muhammad." Hearing that Ibn Saiyad stopped murmuring (or got cautious),
the Prophet said, "If she had left him undisturbed, he would have
revealed his reality." (See Hadith No. 290, Vol 4 for details)
