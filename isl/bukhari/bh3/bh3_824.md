### Hadith 3:825

*Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:*

Some outer garments were received the Prophet and my father (Makhrama)
said to me, "Let us go to the Prophet so that he may give us something
from the garments." So, my father stood at the door and spoke. The
Prophet recognized his voice and came out carrying a garment and telling
Makhrama the good qualities of that garment, adding, "I have kept this
for you, I have sent this for you."
