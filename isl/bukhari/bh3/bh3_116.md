### Hadith 3:119

*Narrated Abu Wail from Hudhaifa:*

Umar asked the people, "Who remembers the narration of the Prophet about
the affliction?" Hudhaifa said, "I heard the Prophet saying, 'The
affliction of a person in his property, family and neighbors is expiated
by his prayers, fasting, and giving in charity." 'Umar said, "I do not
ask about that, but I ask about those afflictions which will spread like
the waves of the sea." Hudhaifa replied, "There is a closed gate in
front of those afflictions." 'Umar asked, "Will that gate be opened or
broken?" He replied, "It will be broken." 'Umar said, "Then the gate
will not be closed again till the Day of Resurrection." We said to
Masruq, "Would you ask Hudhaifa whether 'Umar knew what that gate
symbolized?" He asked him and he replied "He ('Umar) knew it as one
knows that there will be night before tomorrow, morning.
