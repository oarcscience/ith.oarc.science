### Hadith 3:203

*Narrated Anas:*

The Prophet paid a visit to Um-Sulaim and she placed before him dates
and ghee. The Prophet said, "Replace the ghee and dates in their
respective containers for I am fasting." Then he stood somewhere in her
house and offered an optional prayer and then he invoked good on
Um-Sulaim and her family. Then Um-Sulaim said, "O Allah's Apostle! I
have a special request (today)." He said, "What is it?" She replied,
"(Please invoke for) your servant Anas." So Allah's Apostle did not
leave anything good in the world or the Hereafter which he did not
invoke (Allah to bestow) on me and said, "O Allah! Give him (i.e. Anas)
property and children and bless him." Thus I am one of the richest among
the Ansar and my daughter Umaina told me that when A-Hajjaj came to
Basra, more than 120 of my offspring had been buried.
