### Hadith 3:872

*Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:*

My father died and was in debt. I suggested that his creditors take the
fruits (i.e. dates) of my garden in lieu of the debt of my father, but
they refused the offer, as they thought that it would not cover the full
debt. So, I went to the Prophet and told him about it. He said (to me),
"When you pluck the dates and collect them in the Mirbad (i.e. a place
where dates are dried), call me (Allah's Apostle)." Finally he came
accompanied by Abu Bakr and 'Umar and sat on the dates and invoked Allah
to bless them. Then he said, "Call your creditors and give them their
full rights." So, I paid all my father's creditors in full and yet
thirteen extra Wasqs of dates remained, seven of which were 'Ajwa and
six were Laun or six of which were Ajwa and seven were Laun. I met
Allah's Apostle at sunset and informed him about it. On that he smiled
and said, "Go to Abu Bakr and 'Umar and tell them about it." They said,
"We perceived that was going to happen, as Allah's Apostle did what he
did."
