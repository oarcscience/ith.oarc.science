### Hadith 3:550

*Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair:*

An-Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair about a canal in the Harra which
was used for irrigating date-palms. Allah's Apostle, ordering Zubair to
be moderate, said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) first and then leave
the water for your neighbor." The Ansari said, "Is it because he is your
aunt's son?" On that the color of the face of Allah's Apostle changed
and he said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and withhold the water till
it reaches the walls that are between the pits around the trees." So,
Allah's Apostle gave Zubair his full right. Zubair said, "By Allah, the
following verse was revealed in that connection": "But no, by your Lord
They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between
them." (4.65)

(The sub-narrator,) Ibn Shihab said to Juraij (another sub-narrator),
"The Ansar and the other people interpreted the saying of the Prophet,
'Irrigate (your land) and with-hold the water till it reaches the walls
between the pits around the trees,' as meaning up to the ankles."
