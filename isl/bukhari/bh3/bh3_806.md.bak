*Narrated Aisha:*

The wife of Rifa'a Al-Qurazi came to the Prophet and said, "I was

you had a complete sexual relation with your present husband." Abu Bakr
was sitting with Allah's Apostle and Khalid bin Said bin Al-'As was at
the door waiting to be admitted. He said, "O Abu Bakr! Do you hear what
this (woman) is revealing frankly before the Prophet ?"
