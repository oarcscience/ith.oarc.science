### Hadith 3:860

*Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:*

A bedouin came and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Judge between us according
to Allah's Laws." His opponent got up and said, "He is right. Judge
between us according to Allah's Laws." The bedouin said, "My son was a
laborer working for this man, and he committed illegal sexual
intercourse with his wife. The people told me that my son should be
stoned to death; so, in lieu of that, I paid a ransom of one hundred
sheep and a slave girl to save my son. Then I asked the learned scholars
who said, "Your son has to be lashed one-hundred lashes and has to be
exiled for one year." The Prophet said, "No doubt I will judge between
you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to go
back to you, and your son will get a hundred lashes and one year exile."
He then addressed somebody, "O Unais! go to the wife of this (man) and
stone her to death" So, Unais went and stoned her to death.
