<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:646</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "A man felt very thirsty while he was on the way, 
there he came across a well. He went down the well, quenched his 
thirst and came out. Meanwhile he saw a dog panting and licking mud 
because of excessive thirst. He said to himself, "This dog is 
suffering from thirst as I did." So, he went down the well again and 
filled his shoe with water and watered it. Allah thanked him for that 
deed and forgave him. The people said, "O Allah's Apostle! Is there a 
reward for us in serving the animals?" He replied: "Yes, there is a 
reward for serving any animate (living being)." (See Hadith No. 551)
