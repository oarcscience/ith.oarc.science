<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:501</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet owed somebody a camel of a certain age. When he came to 
demand it back, the Prophet said (to some people), "Give him (his 
due)." When the people searched for a camel of that age, they found 
none, but found a camel one year older. The Prophet said, "Give (it 
to) him." On that, the man remarked, "You have given me my right in 
full. May Allah give you in full." The Prophet said, "The best amongst
you is the one who pays the rights of others generously."
