### Hadith 3:672

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "Whoever manumits his share of a jointly possessed
slave, it is imperative for him to get that slave manumitted completely
by paying the remaining price, and if he does not have sufficient money
to manumit him, then the price of the slave should be estimated justly,
and he is to be allowed to work and earn the amount that will manumit
him (without overburdening him)".
