### Hadith 3:812

*Narrated Aisha:*

Aflah asked the permission to visit me but I did not allow him. He said,
"Do you veil yourself before me although I am your uncle?" 'Aisha said,
"How is that?" Aflah replied, "You were suckled by my brother's wife
with my brother's milk." I asked Allah's Apostle about it, and he said,
"Allah is right, so permit him to visit you."

not legally permitted ...](bh3_812.md)
