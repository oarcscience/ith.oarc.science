### Hadith 3:416

*Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:*

Allah's Apostle decided the validity of pre-emption in every joint
undivided property, but if the boundaries were well marked or the ways
and streets were fixed, then there was no pre-emption.

[Next: 3:417: Mussaddad from 'Abdul Wahid: the same as above but said,
... in every joint undivided thing... ...](bh3_414.md)
