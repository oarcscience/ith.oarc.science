### Hadith 3:609

*Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:*

A bedouin went to the Prophet and asked him about picking up a lost
thing. The Prophet said, "Make public announcement about it for one
year. Remember the description of its container and the string with
which it is tied; and if somebody comes and claims it and describes it
correctly, (give it to him); otherwise, utilize it." He said, "O Allah's
Apostle! What about a lost sheep?" The Prophet said, "It is for you, for
your brother (i.e. its owner), or for the wolf." He further asked, "What
about a lost camel?" On that the face of the Prophet became red (with
anger) and said, "You have nothing to do with it, as it has its feet,
its water reserve and can reach places of water and drink, and eat
trees."
