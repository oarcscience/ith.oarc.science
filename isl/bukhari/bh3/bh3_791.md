### Hadith 3:792

*Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:*

I gave a horse in Allah's Cause. The person to whom it was given, did
not look after it. I intended to buy it from him, thinking that he would
sell it cheap. When I asked the Prophet he said, "Don't buy it, even if
he gives it to you for one Dirham, as the person who takes back what he
has given in charity, is like a dog that swallows back its vomit."

[Next: 3:793: Jabir: The Prophet gave the verdict that 'Umra is for the
one to whom it is presented....](bh3_792)
