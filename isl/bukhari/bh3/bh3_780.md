### Hadith 3:781

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

That he was in the company of the Prophet on a journey, riding a
troublesome camel belonging to 'Umar. The camel used to go ahead of the
Prophet, so Ibn 'Umar's father would say, "O 'Abdullah! No one should go
ahead of the Prophet." The Prophet said to him, "Sell it to me." 'Umar
said to the Prophet "It is for you." So, he bought it and said, "O
'Abdullah! It is for you, and you can do with it what you like."
