### Hadith 3:378

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:*

Aisha, (mother of the faithful believers) wanted to buy a slave girl and
manumit her, but her masters said that they would sell her only on the
condition that her Wala' would be for them. 'Aisha told Allah's Apostle
of that. He said, "What they stipulate should not hinder you from buying
her, as the Wala' is for the manumitted."
