### Hadith 3:888

*Narrated Ubai bin Kab:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Moses the Apostle of Allah," and then he narrated
the whole story about him. Al-Khadir said to Moses, "Did not I tell you
that you can have no patience with me." (18.72). Moses then violated the
agreement for the first time because of forgetfulness, then Moses
promised that if he asked Al-Khadir about anything, the latter would
have the right to desert him. Moses abided by that condition and on the
third occasion he intentionally asked Al-Khadir and caused that
condition to be applied. The three occasions referred to above are
referred to by the following Verses:

"Call me not to account for forgetting And be not hard upon me." (18.73)

"Then they met a boy and Khadir killed him." (18.74)

"Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the verge of falling
and Khadir set it up straight." (18.77)
