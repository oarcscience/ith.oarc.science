### Hadith 3:295

*Narrated Abu Mas'ud:*

An Ansari man, called Abu Shu'aib, came and told his butcher slave,
"Prepare meals sufficient for five persons, for I want to invite the
Prophet along with four other persons as I saw signs of hunger on his
face." Abu Shu'aib invited them and another person came along with them.
The Prophet said (to Abu Shu'aib), This man followed us, so if you allow
him, he will join us, and if you want him to return, he will go back."
Abu Shu'aib said, "No, I have allowed him (i.e. he, too, is welcomed to
the meal)."
