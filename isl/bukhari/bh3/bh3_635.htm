There was an Ansari man called Abu Shu'aib who had a slave butcher. 
Abu Shu'aib said to him, "Prepare a meal sufficient for five persons 
so that I might invite the Prophet besides other four persons." Abu 
Shu'aib had seen the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet and so

The Prophet said to Abu Shu'aib, "This man has followed us. Do you 
allow him to share the meal?" Abu Shu'aib said, "Yes."
