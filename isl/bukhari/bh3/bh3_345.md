### Hadith 3:348

*Narrated Aisha:*

Rarely did the Prophet fail to visit Abu Bakr's house everyday, either
in the morning or in the evening. When the permission for migration to
Medina was granted, all of a sudden the Prophet came to us at noon and
Abu Bakr was informed, who said, "Certainly the Prophet has come for
some urgent matter." The Prophet said to Abu Bark, when the latter
entered "Let nobody stay in your home." Abu Bakr said, "O Allah's
Apostle! There are only my two daughters (namely 'Aisha and Asma')
present." The Prophet said, "I feel (am informed) that I have been
granted the permission for migration." Abu Bakr said, "I will accompany
you, O Allah's Apostle!" The Prophet said, "You will accompany me." Abu
Bakr then said "O Allah's Apostle! I have two she-camels I have prepared
specially for migration, so I offer you one of them. The Prophet said,
"I have accepted it on the condition that I will pay its price."
