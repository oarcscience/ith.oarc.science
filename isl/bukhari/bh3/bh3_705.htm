The Prophet said, "The (reward of) deeds depend on intentions, and 
every person will get the reward according to what he intends. So,

for Allah and His Apostle, and whoever migrated for worldly benefits 
or for marrying a woman, then his migration will be for what he 
migrated for." (See Hadith No. 1, Vol. 1)
