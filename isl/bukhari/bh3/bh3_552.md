### Hadith 3:553

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:*

Allah's Apostle said, "A woman was tortured and was put in Hell because
of a cat which she had kept locked till it died of hunger." Allah's
Apostle further said, (Allah knows better) Allah said (to the woman),
'You neither fed it nor watered when you locked it up, nor did you set
it free to eat the insects of the earth."

brought to Allah's Apostle ...](bh3_553)
