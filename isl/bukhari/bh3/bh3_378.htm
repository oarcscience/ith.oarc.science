<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:381</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
The Prophet forbade Muzabana; and Muzabana is the selling of fresh 
fruit (without measuring it) for something by measure on the basis 
that if that thing turns to be more than the fruit, the increase would
be for the seller of the fruit, and if it turns to be less, that would
be of his lot.
<P>
selling of the fruits on the trees after estimation (when they are 
ripe).
