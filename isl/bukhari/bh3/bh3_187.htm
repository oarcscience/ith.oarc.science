<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:190</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle used to fast till one would say that he would never 
stop fasting, and he would abandon fasting till one would say that he 
would never fast. I never saw Allah's Apostle fasting for a whole 
month except the month of Ramadan, and did not see him fasting in any 
month more than in the month of Sha'ban.
