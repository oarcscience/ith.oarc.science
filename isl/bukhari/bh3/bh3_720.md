### Hadith 3:721

*Narrated Al-Ma'rur bin Suwaid:*

I saw Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari wearing a cloak, and his slave, too, was
wearing a cloak. We asked him about that (i.e. how both were wearing
similar cloaks). He replied, "Once I abused a man and he complained of
me to the Prophet . The Prophet asked me, 'Did you abuse him by
slighting his mother?' He added, 'Your slaves are your brethren upon
whom Allah has given you authority. So, if one has one's brethren under
one's control, one should feed them with the like of what one eats and
clothe them with the like of what one wears. You should not overburden
them with what they cannot bear, and if you do so, help them (in their
hard job)."
