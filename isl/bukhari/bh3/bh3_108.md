### Hadith 3:111

*Narrated Anas:*

(The people of) Bani Salama intended to shift near the mosque (of the
Prophet) but Allah's Apostle disliked to see Medina vacated and said, "O
the people of Bani Salama! Don't you think that you will be rewarded for
your footsteps which you take towards the mosque?" So, they stayed at
their old places.
