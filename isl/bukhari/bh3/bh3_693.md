### Hadith 3:694

*Narrated Abu Dhar:*

I asked the Prophet, "What is the best deed?" He replied, "To believe in
Allah and to fight for His Cause." I then asked, "What is the best kind
of manumission (of slaves)?" He replied, "The manumission of the most
expensive slave and the most beloved by his master." I said, "If I
cannot afford to do that?" He said, "Help the weak or do good for a
person who cannot work for himself." I said, "If I cannot do that?" He
said, "Refrain from harming others for this will be regarded as a
charitable deed for your own good."

at the time of solar eclipses....](bh3_694)
