The Prophet said, "May Allah be merciful to the mother of Ishmael! If 
she had left the water of Zam-Zam (fountain) as it was, (without 
constructing a basin for keeping the water), (or said, "If she had not
taken handfuls of its water"), it would have been a flowing stream. 
Jurhum (an Arab tribe) came and asked her, 'May we settle at your 
dwelling?' She said, 'Yes, but you have no right to possess the 
water.' They agreed."
