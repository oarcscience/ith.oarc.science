### Hadith 3:87

*Narrated Qaza'a, the slave of Ziyad: Abu Said who participated in*

twelve Ghazawat with the Prophet said, "I heard four things from Allah's
Apostle (or I narrate them from the Prophet ) which won my admiration
and appreciation. They are:

1\. "No lady should travel without her husband or without a Dhu-Mahram
for a two-days' journey.

2\. No fasting is permissible on two days of 'Id-al-Fitr, and
'Id-al-Adha.

3\. No prayer (may be offered) after two prayers: after the 'Asr prayer
till the sun set and after the morning prayer till the sun rises.

4\. Not to travel (for visiting) except for three mosques:
Masjid-al-Haram (in Mecca), my Mosque (in Medina), and Masjid-al-Aqsa
(in Jerusalem)."
