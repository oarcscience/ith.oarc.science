*Narrated Aisha:*

We set out along with Allah's Apostle shortly before the appearance of
the new moon (crescent) of the month of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said to us,
"Whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so; and whoever wants to
assume Ihram for 'Umra may do so. Hadn't I brought the Hadi (animal for
sacrificing) (with me), I would have assumed Ihram for 'Umra." ('Aisha
added,): So some of us assumed Ihram for 'Umra while the others for
Hajj. I was amongst those who assumed Ihram for 'Umra. The day of
'Arafat approached and I was still menstruating. I complained to the
Prophet (about that) and he said, "Abandon your 'Umra, undo and comb
your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj;." When it was the night of Hasba,
he sent 'Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tan'im and I assumed Ihram for 'Umra
(and performed it) in lieu of my missed 'Umra.
