<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:673</H3><P><I>Narrated An-Nu'man bin Bashir:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "The example of the person abiding by Allah's order 
and restrictions in comparison to those who violate them is like the 
example of those persons who drew lots for their seats in a boat. Some
of them got seats in the upper part, and the others in the lower. When
the latter needed water, they had to go up to bring water (and that 
troubled the others), so they said, 'Let us make a hole in our share 
of the ship (and get water) saving those who are above us from 
troubling them. So, if the people in the upper part left the others do
what they had suggested, all the people of the ship would be 
destroyed, but if they prevented them, both parties would be safe."
