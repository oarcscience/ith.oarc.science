Anas bin Malik said, "When the emigrants came Medina, they had nothing
whereas the Ansar had land and property. The Ansar gave them their 
land on condition that the emigrants would give them half the yearly 
yield and work on the land and provide the necessaries for 
cultivation." His (i.e. Anas's mother who was also the mother of 
'Abdullah bin Abu Talha, gave some date-palms to Allah' Apostle who 
gave them to his freed slave-girl (Um Aiman) who was also the mother 
of Usama bin Zaid. When the Prophet finished from the fighting against
the people of Khaibar and returned to Medina, the emigrants returned 
to the Ansar the fruit gifts which the Ansar had given them. The 
Prophet also returned to Anas's mother the date-pallms. Allah's 
Apostle gave Um Aiman other trees from his garden in lieu of the old 
gift.
