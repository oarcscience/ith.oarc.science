### Hadith 3:440

*Narrated Aun bin Abu Juhaifa:*

I saw my father buying a slave whose profession was cupping, and ordered
that his instruments (of cupping) be broken. I asked him the reason for
doing so. He replied, "Allah's Apostle prohibited taking money for
blood, the price of a dog, and the earnings of a slave-girl by
prostitution; he cursed her who tattoos and her who gets tattooed, the
eater of Riba (usury), and the maker of pictures."

used to pay in advance ...](bh3_438)
