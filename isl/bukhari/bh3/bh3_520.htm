<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:521</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</I></P>
The Prophet concluded a contract with the people of Khaibar to utilize
the land on the condition that half the products of fruits or 
vegetation would be their share. The Prophet used to give his wives 
one hundred Wasqs each, eighty Wasqs of dates and twenty Wasqs of 
barley. (When 'Umar became the Caliph) he gave the wives of the 
Prophet the option of either having the land and water as their 
shares, or carrying on the previous practice. Some of them chose the 
land and some chose the Wasqs, and 'Aisha chose the land.
