Ibn Abbas said, "O Muslims? How do you ask the people of the 
Scriptures, though your Book (i.e. the Quran) which was revealed to 
His Prophet is the most recent information from Allah and you recite 
it, the Book that has not been distorted? Allah has revealed to you 
that the people of the scriptures have changed with their own hands 
what was revealed to them and they have said (as regards their changed
Scriptures): This is from Allah, in order to get some worldly benefit 
thereby." Ibn Abbas added: "Isn't the knowledge revealed to you 
sufficient to prevent you from asking them? By Allah I have never seen
any one of them asking (Muslims) about what has been revealed to 
you."
