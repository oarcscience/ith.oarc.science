### Hadith 3:777

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle owed a man some debt (and that man demanded it very
harshly). The companions of the Prophet wanted to harm him, but the
Prophet said to them, "Leave him, as the creditor has the right to speak
harshly." He then added, "Buy (a camel) of the same age and give it to
him." They said, "We cannot get except a camel of an older age than that
of his." He said, "Buy it and give it to him, as the best amongst you is
he who pays back his debt in the most handsome way.'
