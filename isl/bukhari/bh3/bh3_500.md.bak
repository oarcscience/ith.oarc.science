### Hadith 3:502

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

A man came to the Prophet demanding his debts and behaved rudely. The
companions of the Prophet intended to harm him, but Allah's Apostle said
(to them), "Leave him, for the creditor (i.e. owner of a right) has the
right to speak." Allah's Apostle then said, "Give him a camel of the
same age as that of his." The people said, "O Allah's Apostle! There is
only a camel that is older than his." Allah's Apostle said, "Give (it
to) him, for the best amongst you is he who pays the rights of others
handsomely."
