### Hadith 3:631

*Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa'idi:*

A drink (milk mixed with water) was brought to Allah's Apostle who drank
some of it. A boy was sitting to his right, and some old men to his
left. Allah's Apostle said to the boy, "Do you allow me to give the rest
of the drink to these people?" The boy said, "O Allah's Apostle! I will
not give preference to anyone over me to drink the rest of it from which
you have drunk." Allah's Apostle then handed the bowl (of drink) to the
boy. (See Hadith No. 541).
