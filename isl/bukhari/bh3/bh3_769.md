### Hadith 3:770

*Narrated Jabir:*

The Prophet said to me, "I will give you so much (the Prophet pointed
thrice with his hands) when funds of Bahrain will come to me." But the
Prophet died before the money reached him. (When it came) Abu Bakr
ordered an announcer to announce that whoever had a money claim on the
Prophet or was promised to be given something, should come to Abu Bakr.
I went to Abu Bakr and told him that the Prophet had promised to give me
so much. On that Abu Bakr gave me three handfuls (of money).

cloaks but did not give anything ...](bh3_770)
