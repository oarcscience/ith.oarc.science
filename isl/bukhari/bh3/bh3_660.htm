While the Prophet was with one of his wives, one of the mothers of the
believers (i.e. one of his wives) sent a wooden bowl containing food 
with a servant. The wife (in whose house he was sitting) stroke the 
bowl with her hand and broke it. The Prophet collected the shattered 
pieces and put the food back in it and said, "Eat." He kept the 
servant and the bowl till he had eaten the food. Then the Prophet gave
another unbroken. bowl to the servant and kept the broken one.
