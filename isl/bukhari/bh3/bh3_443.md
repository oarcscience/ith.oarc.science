### Hadith 3:446

*Narrated Shu'ba:*

Muhammad or 'Abdullah bin Abu Al-Mujalid said, "Abdullah bin Shaddad and
Abu Burda differed regarding As-Salam, so they sent me to Ibn Abi Aufa
and I asked him about it. He replied, 'In the life-time of Allah's
Apostle, Abu Bakr and 'Umar, we used to pay in advance the prices of
wheat, barley, dried grapes and dates to be delivered later. I also
asked Ibn Abza and he, too, replied as above.' "
