Abdullah bin Abu Hadrad Al-Aslami owed Kab bin Malik some money. One 
day the latter met the former and demanded his right, and their voices
grew very loud. The Prophet passed by them and said, "O Ka'b," 
beckoning with his hand as if intending to say, "Deduct half the 
debts." So, Kab took half what the other owed him and remitted the 
other half.
