I sat with Ka'b bin 'Ujra and asked him about the Fidya. He replied, 
"This revelation was revealed concerning my case especially, but it is
also for you in general. I was carried to Allah's Apostle and the lice
were falling in great number on my face. The Prophet said, "I have 
never thought that your ailment (or struggle) has reached to such an 
extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep?" I replied in the negative. 
He then said, "Fast for three days, or feed six poor persons each with
half a Sa of food." (1 Sa = 3 Kilograms approx.)
