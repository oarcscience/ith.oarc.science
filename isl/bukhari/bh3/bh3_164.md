### Hadith 3:167

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

Allah's Apostle was on a journey and saw a crowd of people, and a man
was being shaded (by them). He asked, "What is the matter?" They said,
"He (the man) is fasting." The Prophet said, "It is not righteousness
that you fast on a journey."

[Next: 3:168: Anas bin Malik: We used to travel with the Prophet and
neither did the fasting persons...](bh3_165)
