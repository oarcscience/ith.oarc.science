<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:511</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
Abu Talha was the richest man in Medina amongst the Ansar and Beeruha'
(garden) was the most beloved of his property, and it was situated 
opposite the mosque (of the Prophet.). Allah's Apostle used to enter 
it and drink from its sweet water. When the following Divine Verse 
were revealed: 'you will not attain righteousness till you spend in 
charity of the things you love' (3.93), Abu Talha got up in front of 
Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Allah  says in His Book,
'You will not attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) that 
which you love,' and verily, the most beloved to me of my property is 
Beeruha (garden), so I give it in charity and hope for its reward from
Allah. O Allah's Apostle! Spend it wherever you like." Allah's Apostle
appreciated that and said, "That is perishable wealth, that is 
perishable wealth. I have heard what you have said; I suggest you to 
distribute it among your relatives."  Abu Talha said, "I will do so, O
Allah's Apostle." So, Abu Talha distributed it among his relatives and
cousins. The sub-narrator (Malik) said: The Prophet said: "That is a 
profitable wealth," instead of "perishable wealth".
