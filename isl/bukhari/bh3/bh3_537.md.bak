### Hadith 3:538

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Once the Prophet was narrating (a story), while a bedouin was sitting
with him. "One of the inhabitants of Paradise will ask Allah to allow
him to cultivate the land. Allah will ask him, 'Are you not living in
the pleasures you like?' He will say, 'Yes, but I like to cultivate the
land.' " The Prophet added, "When the man (will be permitted he) will
sow the seeds and the plants will grow up and get ripe, ready for
reaping and so on till it will be as huge as mountains within a wink.
Allah will then say to him, 'O son of Adam! Take here you are, gather
(the yield); nothing satisfies you.' " On that, the bedouin said, "The
man must be either from Quraish (i.e. an emigrant) or an Ansari, for
they are farmers, whereas we are not farmers." The Prophet smiled (at
this).
