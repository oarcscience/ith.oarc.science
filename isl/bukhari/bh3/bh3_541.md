### Hadith 3:542

*Narrated Az-Zuhri:*

Anas bin Malik said, that once a domestic sheep was milked for Allah's
Apostle while he was in the house of Anas bin Malik. The milk was mixed
with water drawn from the well in Anas's house. A tumbler of it was
presented to Allah's Apostle who drank from it. Then Abu Bakr was
sitting on his left side and a bedouin on his right side. When the
Prophet removed the tumbler from his mouth, 'Umar was afraid that the
Prophet might give it to the bedouin, so he said. "O Allah's Apostle!
Give it to Abu Bakr who is sitting by your side." But the Prophet gave
it to the bedouin, who was to his right and said, "You should start with
the one on your right side."

superfluous water, for that...](bh3_542)
