### Hadith 3:552

*Narrated Asma' bint Abi Bakr:*

The Prophet prayed the eclipse prayer, and then said, "Hell was
displayed so close that I said, 'O my Lord ! Am I going to be one of its
inhabitants?"' Suddenly he saw a woman. I think he said, who was being
scratched by a cat. He said, "What is wrong with her?" He was told, "She
had imprisoned it (i.e. the cat) till it died of hunger."

tortured and was put in Hell ...](bh3_552.md)
