### Hadith 3:500

*Narrated Ibn Ka'b bin Malik from his father:*

We had some sheep which used to graze at Sala'. One of our slavegirls
saw a sheep dying and she broke a stone and slaughtered the sheep with
it. My father said to the people, "Don't eat it till I ask the Prophet
about it (or till I send somebody to ask the Prophet)." So, he asked or
sent somebody to ask the Prophet, and the Prophet permitted him to eat
it. 'Ubaidullah (a sub-narrator) said, "I admire that girl, for though
she was a slave-girl, she dared to slaughter the sheep . "
