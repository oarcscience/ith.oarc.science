<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:81</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:</I></P>
I came riding on my she-ass and had (just) then attained the age of 
puberty. Allah's Apostle was praying at Mina. I passed in front of a

started grazing. I aligned with the people behind Allah's Apostle (The
sub-narrator added that happened in Mina during the Prophet's 
Hajjat-ul-wada.)
