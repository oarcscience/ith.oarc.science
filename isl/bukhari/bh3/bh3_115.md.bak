### Hadith 3:118

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Fasting is a shield (or a screen or a shelter).
So, the person observing fasting should avoid sexual relation with his
wife and should not behave foolishly and impudently, and if somebody
fights with him or abuses him, he should tell him twice, 'I am fasting."
The Prophet added, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, the smell coming
out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah
than the smell of musk. (Allah says about the fasting person), 'He has
left his food, drink and desires for My sake. The fast is for Me. So I
will reward (the fasting person) for it and the reward of good deeds is
multiplied ten times."
