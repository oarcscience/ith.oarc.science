<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:546</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah (bin Mas'ud):</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Whoever takes a false oath to deprive somebody of 
his property will meet Allah while He will be angry with him." Allah 
revealed: 'Verily those who purchase a little gain at the cost of 
Allah's covenant, and their oaths.' ........(3.77)
<P>
Al-Ash'ath came (to the place where 'Abdullah was narrating) and said,
"What has Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (i.e. Abdullah) been telling you? This 
verse was revealed concerning me. I had a well in the land of a cousin
of mine. The Prophet asked me to bring witnesses (to confirm my 
claim). I said, 'I don't have witnesses.' He said, 'Let the defendant 
take an oath then.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! He will take a (false)
oath immediately.' Then the Prophet mentioned the above narration and 
Allah revealed the verse to confirm what he had said." (See 
Hadith No. 692)
