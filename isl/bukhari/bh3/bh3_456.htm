While I was standing with Sad bin Abi Waqqas, Al-Miswar bin Makhrama 
came and put his hand on my shoulder. Meanwhile Abu Rafi', the freed 
slave of the Prophet came and asked Sad to buy from him the (two) 
dwellings which were in his house. Sad said, "By Allah I will not buy 
them." Al-Miswar said, "By Allah, you shall buy them." Sad replied, 
"By Allah, I will not pay more than four thousand (Dirhams) by 
installments." Abu Rafi' said, "I have been offered five hundred 
Dinars (for it) and had I not heard the Prophet saying, 'The neighbor 
has more right than anyone else because of his nearness, I would not 
give them to you for four-thousand (Dirhams) while I am offered 
five-hundred Dinars (one Dinar equals ten Dirhams) for them." So, he 
sold it to Sad.
