### Hadith 3:889

*Narrated Urwa:*

Aisha said, "Buraira came to me and said, 'My people (masters) have
written the contract for my emancipation for nine Awaq ) of gold) to be
paid in yearly installments, one Uqiyya per year; so help me." Aisha
said (to her), "If your masters agree, I will pay them the whole sum
provided the Wala will be for me." Buraira went to her masters and told
them about it, but they refused the offer and she returned from them
while Allah's Apostles was sitting. She said, "I presented the offer to
them, but they refused unless the Wala' would be for them." When the
Prophet heard that and 'Aisha told him about It, he said to her, "Buy
Buraira and let them stipulate that her Wala' will be for them, as the
Wala' is for the manumitted." 'Aisha did so. After that Allah's Apostle
got up amidst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah and said, "What is
wrong with some people who stipulate things which are not in Allah's
Laws? Any condition which is not in Allah's Laws is invalid even if
there were a hundred such conditions. Allah's Rules are the most valid
and Allah's Conditions are the most solid. The Wala is for the
manumitted."
