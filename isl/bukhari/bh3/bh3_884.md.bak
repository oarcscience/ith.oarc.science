### Hadith 3:885

*Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:*

A bedouin came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's apostle! I ask
you by Allah to judge My case according to Allah's Laws." His opponent,
who was more learned than he, said, "Yes, judge between us according to
Allah's Laws, and allow me to speak." Allah's Apostle said, "Speak." He
(i .e. the bedouin or the other man) said, "My son was working as a
laborer for this (man) and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with
his wife. The people told me that it was obligatory that my son should
be stoned to death, so in lieu of that I ransomed my son by paying one
hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious scholars
about it, and they informed me that my son must be lashed one hundred
lashes, and be exiled for one year, and the wife of this (man) must be
stoned to death." Allah's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul
is, I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl
and the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a
hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of
this (man) and if she confesses her guilt, stone her to death." Unais
went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Allah's Apostle
ordered that she be stoned to death.
