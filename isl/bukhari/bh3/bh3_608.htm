<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:609</H3><P><I>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:</I></P>
A bedouin went to the Prophet and asked him about picking up a lost 
thing. The Prophet said, "Make public announcement about it for one 
year. Remember the description of its container and the string with 
which it is tied; and if somebody comes and claims it and describes it
correctly, (give it to him); otherwise, utilize it." He said, "O 
Allah's Apostle! What about a lost sheep?" The Prophet said, "It is 
for you, for your brother (i.e. its owner), or for the wolf." He 
further asked, "What about a lost camel?" On that the face of the 
Prophet became red (with anger) and said, "You have nothing to do with
it, as it has its feet, its water reserve and can reach places of 
water and drink, and eat trees."
