### Hadith 3:30

*Narrated Abu Ishaq:*

I heard Al-Bara' saying, "The above Verse was revealed regarding us, for
the Ansar on returning from Hajj never entered their houses through the
proper doors but from behind. One of the Ansar came and entered through
the door and he was taunted for it. Therefore, the following was
revealed: --

"It is not righteousness That you enter the houses from the back, But
the righteous man is He who fears Allah, Obeys His order and keeps away
from What He has forbidden So, enter houses through the proper doors."
(2.189)
