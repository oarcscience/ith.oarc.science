<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:437</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
The Prophet came to Khaibar and when Allah made him victorious and he 
conquered the town by breaking the enemy's defense, the beauty of 
Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtab was mentioned to him and her husband had 
been killed while she was a bride. Allah's Apostle selected her for 
himself and he set out in her company till he reached Sadd-ar-Rawha' 
where her menses were over and he married her. Then Hais (a kind of 
meal) was prepared and served on a small leather sheet (used for 
serving meals). Allah's Apostle then said to me, "Inform those who are
around you (about the wedding banquet)." So that was the marriage 
banquet given by Allah's Apostle for (his marriage with) Safiya. After
that we proceeded to Medina and I saw that Allah's Apostle was 
covering her with a cloak while she was behind him. Then he would sit 
beside his camel and let Safiya put her feet on his knees to ride (the
camel).
