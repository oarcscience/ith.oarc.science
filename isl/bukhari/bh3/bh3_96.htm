<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:99</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Zuhair:</I></P>
I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Yemen will be conquered and some 
people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and 
those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be
better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and 
some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families 
and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina 
will be better for them; if they but knew. 'Iraq will be conquered and
some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families 
and those who will obey them to migrate (to 'Iraq) although Medina 
will be better for them; if they but knew."
