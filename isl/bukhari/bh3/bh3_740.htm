Aisha said to me, "O my nephew! We used to see the crescent, and then 
the crescent and then the crescent in this way we saw three crescents 
in two months and no fire (for cooking) used to be made in the houses 
of Allah's Apostle. I said, "O my aunt! Then what use to sustain you?"
'Aisha said, "The two black things: dates and water, our neighbors 
from Ansar had some Manarh and they used to present Allah's Apostle 
some of their milk and he used to make us drink."
