The Prophet intended to practice Itikaf and when he reached the place 
where he intended to perform Itikaf, he saw some tents, the tents of 
'Aisha, Hafsa and Zainab. So, he said, "Do you consider that they 
intended to do righteousness by doing this?" And then he went away and
did not perform Itikaf (in Ramadan) but performed it in the month of 
Shawwal for ten days.
