<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:154</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "If somebody eats or drinks forgetfully then he 
should complete his fast, for what he has eaten or drunk, has been 
cleaning his teeth with Siwak while he was fasting so many times as I 
can't count." And narrated Abu Huraira, "The Prophet said, 'But for my
fear that it would be hard for my followers, I would have ordered them
to clean their teeth with Siwak on every performance of ablution." The
same is narrated by Jabir and Zaid bin Khalid from the Prophet who did
not differentiate between a fasting and a nonfasting person in this 
respect (using Siwak).
<P>
Aisha said, "The Prophet said, "It (i.e. Siwak) is a purification for 
the mouth and it is a way of seeking Allah's pleasures." Ata' and 
Qatada said, "There is no harm in swallowing the resultant saliva."
