### Hadith 3:761

*Narrated Az-Zuhari:*

Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah told me that 'Aisha had said, "When the Prophet
became sick and his condition became serious, he requested his wives to
allow him to be treated in my house, and they allowed him. He came out
leaning on two men while his feet were dragging on the ground. He was
walking between Al-'Abbas and another man." 'Ubaidullah said, "When I
informed Ibn 'Abbas of what 'Aisha had said, he asked me whether I knew
who was the second man whom 'Aisha had not named. I replied in the
negative. He said, 'He was 'Ali bin Abi Talib."
