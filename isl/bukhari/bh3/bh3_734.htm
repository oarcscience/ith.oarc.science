That 'Aisha told him that Buraira came to seek her help in her writing
of emancipation (for a certain sum) and that time she had not paid 
anything of it. 'Aisha said to her, "Go back to your masters, and if 
they agree that I will pay the amount of your writing of emancipation 
and get your Wala', I will do so." Buraira informed her masters of 
that but they refused and said, "If she (i.e. 'Aisha) is seeking 
Allah's reward, then she can do so, but your Wala' will be for us." 
'Aisha mentioned that to Allah's Apostle who said to her, "Buy and 
manumit her, as the Wala' is for the liberator." Allah's Apostle then 
got up and said, "What about the people who stipulate conditions which
are not present in Allah's Laws? Whoever imposes conditions which are 
not present in Allah's Laws, then those conditions will be invalid, 
even if he imposed these conditions a hundred times. Allah's 
conditions (Laws) are the truth and are more solid."
