gift but 'Amra bint Rawaha (my mother) said that she would not agree to
it unless he made Allah's Apostle as a witness to it. So, my father went

bint Rawaha, but she ordered me to make you as a witness to it, O
Allah's Apostle!' Allah's Apostle asked, 'Have you given (the like of
it) to everyone of your sons?' He replied in the negative. Allah's
Apostle said, 'Be afraid of Allah, and be just to your children.' My
