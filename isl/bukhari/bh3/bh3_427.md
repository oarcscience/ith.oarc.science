### Hadith 3:430

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "Allah says, 'I will be against three persons on the
Day of Resurrection:

1\. One who makes a covenant in My Name, but he proves treacherous.

2\. One who sells a free person (as a slave) and eats the price,

3\. And one who employs a laborer and gets the full work done by him but
does not pay him his wages.' "
