(daughter of Um Salama)  that her mother said, "While I was (lying) 
with Allah's Apostle underneath a woolen sheet, I got the 
menstruation, and then slipped away and put on the clothes (which I

that woolen sheet. I and Allah's Apostle used to take a bath from one 
water pot and he used to kiss me while he was fasting."
