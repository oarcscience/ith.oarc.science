### Hadith 3:17

*Narrated Safwan bin Ya'la bin Umaiya from his father who said:*

"A man came to the Prophet while he was at Ji'rana. The man was wearing
a cloak which had traces of Khaluq or Sufra (a kind of perfume). The man
asked (the Prophet ), 'What do you order me to perform in my 'Umra?' So,
Allah inspired the Prophet divinely and he was screened by a place of
cloth. I wished to see the Prophet being divinely inspired. 'Umar said
to me, 'Come! Will you be pleased to look at the Prophet while Allah is
inspiring him?' I replied in the affirmative. 'Umar lifted one corner of
the cloth and I looked at the Prophet who was snoring. (The sub-narrator
thought that he said: The snoring was like that of a camel). When that
state was over, the Prophet asked, "Where is the questioner who asked
about 'Umra? Put off your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from
your body and clean the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra
what you perform in your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka'ba and the
Sa'i between Safa and Marwa). "
