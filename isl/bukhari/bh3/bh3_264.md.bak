### Hadith 3:267

*Narrated An-Nu'man bin Bashir:*

The Prophet said "Both legal and illegal things are obvious, and in
between them are (suspicious) doubtful matters. So who-ever forsakes
those doubtful things lest he may commit a sin, will definitely avoid
what is clearly illegal; and who-ever indulges in these (suspicious)
doubtful things bravely, is likely to commit what is clearly illegal.
Sins are Allah's Hima (i.e. private pasture) and whoever pastures (his
sheep) near it, is likely to get in it at any moment."
