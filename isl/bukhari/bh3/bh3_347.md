### Hadith 3:350

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle forbade the selling of things by a town dweller on
behalf of a desert dweller; and similarly Najsh was forbidden. And one
should not urge somebody to return the goods to the seller so as to sell
him his own goods; nor should one demand the hand of a girl who has
already been engaged to someone else; and a woman should not try to
cause some other woman to be divorced in order to take her place.

would be manumitted after his death ...](bh3_348.md)
