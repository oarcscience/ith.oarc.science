### Hadith 3:20

*Narrated 'Amr bin Dinar:*

We asked Ibn 'Umar whether a man who had performed the Tawaf of the
Ka'ba but had not performed the Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwa yet,
was permitted to have sexual relation with his wife. He replied, "The
Prophet arrived (at Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka'ba seven times and
then offered a two Rak'at prayer behind Maqam-lbrahim and then performed
the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa (seven times) (and
verily, in Allah's Apostle you have a good example." And we asked Jabir
bin 'Abdullah (the same question) and he replied, "He should not go near
her till he has finished the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and
Al-Marwa."
