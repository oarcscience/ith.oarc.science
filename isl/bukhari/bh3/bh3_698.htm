<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:699</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever manumits his share of a slave, then it 
is essential for him to get that slave manumitted' completely as long 
as he has the money to do so. If he has not sufficient money to pay 
the price of the other shares (after the price of the slave is 
evaluated justly), the manumitted manumits the slave partially in 
proportion to his share.
