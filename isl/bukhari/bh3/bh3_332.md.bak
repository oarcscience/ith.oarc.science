### Hadith 3:335

*Narrated Ata bin Yasar:*

I met Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As and asked him, "Tell me about the
description of Allah's Apostle which is mentioned in Torah (i.e. Old
Testament.") He replied, 'Yes. By Allah, he is described in Torah with
some of the qualities attributed to him in the Quran as follows:

"O Prophet ! We have sent you as a witness (for Allah's True religion)
And a giver of glad tidings (to the faithful believers), And a warner
(to the unbelievers) And guardian of the illiterates. You are My slave
and My messenger (i.e. Apostle). I have named you "Al-Mutawakkil" (who
depends upon Allah). You are neither discourteous, harsh Nor a
noise-maker in the markets And you do not do evil to those Who do evil
to you, but you deal With them with forgiveness and kindness. Allah will
not let him (the Prophet) Die till he makes straight the crooked people
by making them say: "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,"
With which will be opened blind eyes And deaf ears and enveloped
hearts."
