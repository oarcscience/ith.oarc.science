### Hadith 3:772

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, "I am ruined." The Prophet
asked, "What do you mean?" He said, "I had a sexual intercourse with my
wife during Ramadan (while fasting)." The Prophet asked him, "Can you
manumit a slave?" He replied in the negative. He then asked him, "Can
you fast for two successive months continuously" He replied in the
negative. The Prophet then asked him, "Can you feed sixty poor persons?"
He replied in the negative. In the meantime an Ansari came with a basket
full of dates. The Prophet said to the man, "Take it and give it in
charity (as an expiation of your sin)." The man said "Should I give it
to some people who are poorer than we O Allah's Apostle? By Him Who has
sent you with the Truth, there is no family between Medina's two
mountains poorer than we." Allah's Apostle told him to take it and
provide his family with it."
