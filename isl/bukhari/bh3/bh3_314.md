### Hadith 3:317

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Umar:*

Once the Prophet sent to 'Umar a silken two-piece garment, and when he
saw 'Umar wearing it, he said to him, "I have not sent it to you to
wear. It is worn by him who has no share in the Hereafter, and I have
sent it to you so that you could benefit by it (i.e. sell it)."
