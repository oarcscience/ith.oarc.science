### Hadith 3:715

*Narrated Hisham:*

My father told me that Hakim bin Hizam manumitted one-hundred slaves in
the pre-lslamic period of ignorance and slaughtered one-hundred camels
(and distributed them in charity). When he embraced Islam he again
slaughtered one-hundred camels and manumitted one-hundred slaves. Hakim
said, "I asked Allah's Apostle, 'O Allah's Apostle! What do you think
about some good deeds I used to practice in the prelslamic period of
ignorance regarding them as deeds of righteousness?' Allah's Apostle
said, "You have embraced Islam along with all those good deeds you did."
