*Narrated 'Urwa:*

That 'Aisha told him that Buraira came to seek her help in her writing
of emancipation (for a certain sum) and that time she had not paid
anything of it. 'Aisha said to her, "Go back to your masters, and if
they agree that I will pay the amount of your writing of emancipation
and get your Wala', I will do so." Buraira informed her masters of that
but they refused and said, "If she (i.e. 'Aisha) is seeking Allah's
reward, then she can do so, but your Wala' will be for us." 'Aisha
mentioned that to Allah's Apostle who said to her, "Buy and manumit her,
as the Wala' is for the liberator." Allah's Apostle then got up and
said, "What about the people who stipulate conditions which are not
present in Allah's Laws? Whoever imposes conditions which are not
present in Allah's Laws, then those conditions will be invalid, even if
he imposed these conditions a hundred times. Allah's conditions (Laws)
are the truth and are more solid."
