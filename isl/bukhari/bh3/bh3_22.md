### Hadith 3:23

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:*

Whenever Allah's Apostle returned from a Ghazwa, Hajj or 'Umra, he used
to say Takbir thrice at every elevation of the ground and then would
say, "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah; He is One and has
no partner. All the kingdoms is for Him, and all the praises are for
Him, and He is Omnipotent. We are returning with repentance,
worshipping, prostrating, and praising our Lord. He has kept up His
promise and made His slave victorious, and He Alone defeated all the
clans of (non-believers)."
