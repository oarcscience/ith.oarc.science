<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:469</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "Your example and the example of Jews and 
Christians is like the example of a man who employed some laborers to 
whom he said, 'Who will work for me up to midday for one Qirat each?' 
The Jews carried out the work for one Qirat each; and then the 
Christians carried out the work up to the 'Asr prayer for one Qirat 
each; and now you Muslims are working from the 'Asr prayer up to 
sunset for two Qirats each. The Jews and Christians got angry and 
said, 'We work more and are paid less.' The employer (Allah) asked 
them, 'Have I usurped some of your right?' They replied in the 
negative. He said, 'That is My Blessing, I bestow upon whomever I 
wish.' "
