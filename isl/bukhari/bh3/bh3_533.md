### Hadith 3:534

*Narrated 'Amr:*

When I mentioned it (i.e. the narration of Rafi 'bin Khadij: no. 532) to
Tawus, he said, "It is permissible to rent the land for cultivation, for
Ibn 'Abbas said, 'The Prophet did not forbid that, but said: One had
better give the land to one's brother gratis rather than charge a
certain amount for it.' "

[Next: 3:535: Nafi: Ibn 'Umar used to rent his farms in the time of Abu
Bakr, 'Umar, ...](bh3_534.md)
