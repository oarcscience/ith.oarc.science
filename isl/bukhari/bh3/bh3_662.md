### Hadith 3:663

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

"Allah's Apostle sent an army towards the east coast and appointed Abu
'Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their chief, and the army consisted of
three-hundred men including myself. We marched on till we reached a
place where our food was about to finish. Abu- 'Ubaida ordered us to
collect all the journey food and it was collected. My (our) journey food
was dates. Abu 'Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration in small
amounts from it, till it was exhausted. The share of everyone of us used
to be one date only." I said, "How could one date benefit you?" Jabir
replied, "We came to know its value when even that too finished." Jabir
added, "When we reached the sea-shore, we saw a huge fish which was like
a small mountain. The army ate from it for eighteen days. Then Abu
'Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed and they were fixed in the
ground. Then he ordered that a she-camel be ridden and it passed under
the two ribs (forming an arch) without touching them."
