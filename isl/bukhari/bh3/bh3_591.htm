<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:592</H3><P><I>Narrated Abdullah bin 'Umar:</I></P>
I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Everyone of you is a guardian, and 
responsible for what is in his custody. The ruler is a guardian of his
subjects and responsible for them; a husband is a guardian of his 
family and is responsible for it; a lady is a guardian of her 
husband's house and is responsible for it, and a servant is a guardian
of his master's property and is responsible for it." I heard that from
Allah's Apostle and I think that the Prophet also said, "A man is a 
guardian of is father's property and is responsible for it, so all of 
you are guardians and responsible for your wards and things under your
care."
