<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:350</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle forbade the selling of things by a town dweller on 
behalf of a desert dweller; and similarly Najsh was forbidden. And one
should not urge somebody to return the goods to the seller so as to 
sell him his own goods; nor should one demand the hand of a girl who 
has already been engaged to someone else; and a woman should not try 
to cause some other woman to be divorced in order to take her place.
