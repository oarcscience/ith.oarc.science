Abu Shuraih, Al-'Adawi said that he had said to 'Amr bin Sa'id when he
was sending the troops to Mecca (to fight 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair), "O
Chief! Allow me to tell you what Allah's Apostle said on the day 
following the Conquest of Mecca. My ears heard that and my heart 
understood it thoroughly and I saw with my own eyes the Prophet when 
he, after Glorifying and Praising Allah, started saying, 'Allah, not 
the people, made Mecca a sanctuary, so anybody who has belief in Allah
and the Last Day should neither shed blood in it, nor should he cut 
down its trees. If anybody tells (argues) that fighting in it is 
permissible on the basis that Allah's Apostle did fight in Mecca, say 
to him, 'Allah allowed His Apostle and did not allow you.' "Allah 
allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and 
today its sanctity is valid as it was before. So, those who are 
present should inform those who are absent (concerning this fact." Abu
Shuraih was asked, "What did 'Amr reply?" He said, ('Amr said) 'O Abu 
Shuraih! I know better than you in this respect Mecca does not give 
protection to a sinner, a murderer or a thief."
