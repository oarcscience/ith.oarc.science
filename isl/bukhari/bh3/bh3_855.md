### Hadith 3:856

*Narrated Anas:*

It was said to the Prophet "Would that you see Abdullah bin Ubai." So,
the Prophet went to him, riding a donkey, and the Muslims accompanied
him, walking on salty barren land. When the Prophet reached 'Abdullah
bin Ubai, the latter said, "Keep away from me! By Allah, the bad smell
of your donkey has harmed me." On that an Ansari man said (to
'Abdullah), "By Allah! The smell of the donkey of Allah's Apostle is
better than your smell." On that a man from 'Abdullah's tribe got angry
for 'Abdullah's sake, and the two men abused each other which caused the
friends of the two men to get angry, and the two groups started fighting
with sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that the following Divine
Verse was revealed (in this concern):-- "And if two groups of Believers
fall to fighting then, make peace between them." (49.9)
