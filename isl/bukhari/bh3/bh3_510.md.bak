### Hadith 3:511

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Abu Talha was the richest man in Medina amongst the Ansar and Beeruha'
(garden) was the most beloved of his property, and it was situated
opposite the mosque (of the Prophet.). Allah's Apostle used to enter it
and drink from its sweet water. When the following Divine Verse were
revealed: 'you will not attain righteousness till you spend in charity
of the things you love' (3.93), Abu Talha got up in front of Allah's
Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Allah says in His Book, 'You will
not attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) that which you
love,' and verily, the most beloved to me of my property is Beeruha
(garden), so I give it in charity and hope for its reward from Allah. O
Allah's Apostle! Spend it wherever you like." Allah's Apostle
appreciated that and said, "That is perishable wealth, that is
perishable wealth. I have heard what you have said; I suggest you to
distribute it among your relatives." Abu Talha said, "I will do so, O
Allah's Apostle." So, Abu Talha distributed it among his relatives and
cousins. The sub-narrator (Malik) said: The Prophet said: "That is a
profitable wealth," instead of "perishable wealth".
