### Hadith 3:808

*Narrated Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika from 'Uqba bin Al-Harith:*

Uqba married the daughter of Abu Ihab bin Aziz, and then a woman came
and said, "I suckled 'Uqba and his wife." 'Uqba said to her, "I do not
know that you have suckled me, and you did not inform me." He then sent
someone to the house of Abu Ihab to enquire about that but they did not
know that she had suckled their daughter. Then 'Uqba went to the Prophet
in Medina and asked him about it. The Prophet said to him, "How (can you
keep your wife) after it has been said (that both of you were suckled by
the same woman)?" So, he divorced her and she was married to another
(husband).
