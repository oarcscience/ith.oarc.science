<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:11</H3><P><I>Narrated Aisha:</I></P>
We set out along with Allah's Apostle shortly before the appearance of
the new moon (crescent) of the month of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said to us,
"Whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so; and whoever wants 
to assume Ihram for 'Umra may do so. Hadn't I brought the Hadi (animal
for sacrificing) (with me), I would have assumed Ihram for 'Umra." 
('Aisha added,): So some of us assumed Ihram for 'Umra while the 
others for Hajj. I was amongst those who assumed Ihram for 'Umra. The 
day of 'Arafat approached and I was still menstruating. I complained 
to the Prophet (about that) and he said, "Abandon your 'Umra, undo and
comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj;." When it was the night of 
Hasba, he sent 'Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tan'im and I assumed Ihram 
for 'Umra (and performed it) in lieu of my missed 'Umra.
