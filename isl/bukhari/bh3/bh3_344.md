### Hadith 3:347

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

I saw the people buy foodstuff randomly (i.e. blindly without measuring
it) in the life-time of Allah's Apostle and they were punished (by
beating), if they tried to sell it before carrying it to their own
houses.

[Next: 3:348: Aisha: Rarely did the Prophet fail to visit Abu Bakr's
house everyday, either...](bh3_345)
