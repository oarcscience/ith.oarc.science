### Hadith 3:244

*Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:*

Allah's Apostle used to practice Itikaf in the middle ten days of
Ramadan and once he stayed in Itikaf till the night of the twenty-first
and it was the night in the morning of which he used to come out of his
Itikaf. The Prophet said, "Whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay in
Itikaf for the last ten days, for I was informed (of the date) of the
Night (of Qadr) but I have been caused to forget it. (In the dream) I
saw myself prostrating in mud and water in the morning of that night.
So, look for it in the last ten nights and in the odd ones of them." It
rained that night and the roof of the mosque dribbled as it was made of
leaf stalks of date-palms. I saw with my own eyes the mark of mud and
water on the forehead of the Prophet (i.e. in the morning of the
twenty-first).
