### Hadith 3:64

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Umar:*

A person stood up and asked, "O Allah's: Apostle! What clothes may be
worn in the state of Ihram?" The Prophet replied, "Do not wear a shirt
or trousers, or any headgear (e.g. a turban), or a hooded cloak; but if
somebody has no shoes he can wear leather stockings provided they are
cut short off the ankles, and also, do not wear anything perfumed with
Wars or saffron, and the Muhrima (a woman in the state of Ihram) should
not cover her face, or wear gloves."
