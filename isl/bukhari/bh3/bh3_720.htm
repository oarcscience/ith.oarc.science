I saw Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari wearing a cloak, and his slave, too, was 
wearing a cloak. We asked him about that (i.e. how both were wearing 
similar cloaks). He replied, "Once I abused a man and he complained of
me to the Prophet . The Prophet asked me, 'Did you abuse him by 
slighting his mother?' He added, 'Your slaves are your brethren upon 
whom Allah has given you authority. So, if one has one's brethren 
under one's control, one should feed them with the like of what one 
eats and clothe them with the like of what one wears. You should not 
overburden them with what they cannot bear, and if you do so, help 
them (in their hard job)."
