<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:620</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "When the believers pass safely over (the bridge
across) Hell, they will be stopped at a bridge in between Hell and 
Paradise where they will retaliate upon each other for the injustices 
done among them in the world, and when they get purified of all their 
sins, they will be admitted into Paradise. By Him in Whose Hands the 
life of Muhammad is everybody will recognize his dwelling in Paradise 
better than he recognizes his dwelling in this world."
