### Hadith 3:613

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

When Allah gave victory to His Apostle over the people of Mecca, Allah's
Apostle stood up among the people and after glorifying Allah, said,
"Allah has prohibited fighting in Mecca and has given authority to His
Apostle and the believers over it, so fighting was illegal for anyone
before me, and was made legal for me for a part of a day, and it will
not be legal for anyone after me. Its game should not be chased, its
thorny bushes should not be uprooted, and picking up its fallen things
is not allowed except for one who makes public announcement for it, and
he whose relative is murdered has the option either to accept a
compensation for it or to retaliate." Al-'Abbas said, "Except
Al-ldhkhir, for we use it in our graves and houses." Allah's Apostle
said, "Except Al-ldhkhir." Abu Shah, a Yemenite, stood up and said, "O
Allah's Apostle! Get it written for me." Allah's Apostle said, "Write it
for Abu Shah." (The sub-narrator asked Al-Auza'i): What did he mean by
saying, "Get it written, O Allah's Apostle?" He replied, "The speech
which he had heard from Allah's Apostle ."
