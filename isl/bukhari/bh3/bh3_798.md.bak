Anas bin Malik said, "When the emigrants came Medina, they had nothing
whereas the Ansar had land and property. The Ansar gave them their land
on condition that the emigrants would give them half the yearly yield
and work on the land and provide the necessaries for cultivation." His

gave some date-palms to Allah' Apostle who gave them to his freed
slave-girl (Um Aiman) who was also the mother of Usama bin Zaid. When
the Prophet finished from the fighting against the people of Khaibar and
returned to Medina, the emigrants returned to the Ansar the fruit gifts
which the Ansar had given them. The Prophet also returned to Anas's
mother the date-pallms. Allah's Apostle gave Um Aiman other trees from
his garden in lieu of the old gift.
