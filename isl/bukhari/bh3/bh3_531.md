### Hadith 3:532

*Narrated Rafi bin Khadij:*

My uncle Zuhair said, "Allah's Apostle forbade us to do a thing which
was a source of help to us." I said, "Whatever Allah's Apostle said was
right." He said, "Allah's Apostle sent for me and asked, 'What are you
doing with your farms?' I replied, 'We give our farms on rent on the
basis that we get the yield produced at the banks of the water streams
(rivers) for the rent, or rent it for some Wasqs of barley and dates.'
Allah's Apostle said, 'Do not do so, but cultivate (the land) yourselves
or let it be cultivated by others gratis, or keep it uncultivated.' I
said, 'We hear and obey.'

for one-third, ...](bh3_532)
