### Hadith 3:377

*Narrated 'Urwa:*

Aisha said, "Buraira came to me and said, 'I have agreed with my masters
to pay them nine Uqiyas (of gold) (in installments) one Uqiya per year;
please help me.' I said, 'I am ready to pay the whole amount now
provided your masters agree that your Wala will be for me.' So, Buraira
went to her masters and told them about that offer but they refused to
accept it. She returned, and at that time, Allah's Apostle was sitting
(present). Buraira said, 'I told them of the offer but they did not
accept it and insisted on having the Wala.'.' The Prophet heard that."
'Aisha narrated the whole story to the Prophet . He said to her, "Buy
her and stipulate that her Wala' would be yours as the Wala' is for the
manumitted." 'Aisha did so. Then Allah's Apostle stood up in front of
the people, and after glorifying Allah he said, "Amma Badu (i.e. then
after)! What about the people who impose conditions which are not in
Allah's Book (Laws)? Any condition that is not in Allah's Book (Laws) is
invalid even if they were one hundred conditions, for Allah's decisions
are the right ones and His conditions are the strong ones (firmer) and
the Wala' will be for the manumitted."
