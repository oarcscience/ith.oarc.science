Hilal bin Umaiya accused his wife before the Prophet of committing 
illegal sexual intercourse with Sharik bin Sahma.' The Prophet said, 
"Produce a proof, or else you would get the legal punishment (by being
lashed) on your back." Hilal said, "O Allah's Apostle! If anyone of us
saw another man over his wife, would he go to search for a proof." The
Prophet went on saying, "Produce a proof or else you would get the 
legal punishment (by being lashed) on your back." The Prophet then 
mentioned the narration of Lian (as in the Holy Book). (Surat-al-Nur:
