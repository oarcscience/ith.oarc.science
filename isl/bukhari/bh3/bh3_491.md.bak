### Hadith 3:493

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

Once the Prophet said (to me), "If the money of Bahrain comes, I will
give you a certain amount of it." The Prophet had breathed his last
before the money of Bahrain arrived. When the money of Bahrain reached,
Abu Bakr announced, "Whoever was promised by the Prophet should come to
us." I went to Abu Bakr and said, "The Prophet promised me so and so."
Abu Bakr gave me a handful of coins and when I counted them, they were
five-hundred in number. Abu Bakr then said, "Take twice the amount you
have taken (besides)."
