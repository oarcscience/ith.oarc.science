### Hadith 3:4

*Narrated Mujahid:*

Ursa bin AzZubair and I entered the Mosque (of the Prophet) and saw
'Abdullah bin Umar sitting near the dwelling place of Aisha and some
people were offering the Duha prayer. We asked him about their prayer
and he replied that it was a heresy. He (Ursa) then asked him how many
times the Prophet had performed 'Umra. He replied, 'Four times; one of
them was in the month of Rajab." We disliked to contradict him. Then we
heard 'Aisha, the Mother of faithful believers cleaning her teeth with
Siwak in the dwelling place. 'Ursa said, "O Mother! O Mother of the
believers! Don't you hear what Abu 'Abdur Rahman is saying?" She said,
"What does he say?" 'Ursa said, "He says that Allah's Apostle performed
four 'Umra and one of them was in the month of Rajab." 'Aisha said, "May
Allah be merciful to Abu 'Abdur Rahman! The Prophet did not perform any
'Umra except that he was with him, and he never performed any 'Umra in
Rajab."
