<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:140</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Adi bin Hatim:</I></P>
When the above verses were revealed: 'Until the white thread appears 
to you, distinct from the black thread,' I took two (hair) strings, 
one black and the other white, and kept them under my pillow and went 
on looking at them throughout the night but could not make anything 
out of it. So, the next morning I went to Allah's Apostle and told him
the whole story. He explained to me, "That verse means the darkness of
the night and the whiteness of the dawn."
