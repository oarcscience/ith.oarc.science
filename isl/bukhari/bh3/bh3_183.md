### Hadith 3:186

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle forbade Al-Wisal in fasting. So, one of the Muslims said
to him, "But you practice Al-Wisal. O Allah's Apostle!" The Prophet
replied, "Who amongst you is similar to me? I am given food and drink
during my sleep by my Lord." So, when the people refused to stop
Al-Wisal (fasting continuously), the Prophet fasted day and night
continuously along with them for a day and then another day and then
they saw the crescent moon (of the month of Shawwal). The Prophet said
to them (angrily), "If It (the crescent) had not appeared, I would have
made you fast for a longer period." That was as a punishment for them
when they refused to stop (practising Al-Wisal).
