### Hadith 3:198

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:*

The news of my daily fasting and praying every night throughout the
night reached the Prophet. So he sent for me or I met him, and he said,
"I have been informed that you fast everyday and pray every night (all
the night). Fast (for some days) and give up fasting (for some days);
pray and sleep, for your eyes have a right on you, and your body and
your family (i.e. wife) have a right on you." I replied, "I have more
power than that (fasting)." The Prophet said, "Then fast like the fasts
of (the Prophet) David". I said, "How?" He replied, "He used to fast on
alternate days, and he used not to flee on meeting the enemy." I said,
"From where can I get that chance?" ('Ata' said, "I do not know how the
expression of fasting daily throughout the life occurred.") So, the
Prophet said, twice, "Whoever fasts daily throughout his life is just as
the one who does not fast at all."
