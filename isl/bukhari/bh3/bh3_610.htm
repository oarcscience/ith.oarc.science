<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:611</H3><P><I>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid:</I></P>
A man came and asked Allah's Apostle about picking a lost thing. The 
Prophet said, "Remember the description of its container and the 
string it is tied with, and make public announcement about it for one 
year. If the owner shows up, give it to him; otherwise, do whatever 
you like with it." He then asked, "What about a lost sheep?" The 
Prophet said, "It is for you, for your brother (i.e. its owner), or 
for the wolf." He further asked, "What about a lost camel?" The 
Prophet said, "It is none of your concern. It has its water-container 
(reservoir) and its feet, and it will reach water and drink it and eat
the trees till its owner finds it."
