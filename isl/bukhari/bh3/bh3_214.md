### Hadith 3:217

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

Fasting for those who perform ,Hajj-at-Tamattu' (in lieu of the Hadi
which they cannot afford) may be performed up to the day of 'Arafat. And
if one does not get a Hadi and has not fasted (before the 'Id) then one
should fast of the days of Mina. (11, 12 and 13th of Dhul Hajja).

[Next: 3:218: Salim's father: The Prophet said, Whoever wishes may fast
on the day of 'Ashura'. ...](bh3_215.md)
