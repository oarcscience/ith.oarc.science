<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:441</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle came to Medina and the people used to pay in advance 
the price of fruits to be delivered within one or two years. (The 
sub-narrator is in doubt whether it was one to two years or two to 
three years.) The Prophet said, "Whoever pays money in advance for 
dates (to be delivered later) should pay it for known specified weight
and measure (of the dates)."
