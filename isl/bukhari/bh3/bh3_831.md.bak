### Hadith 3:832

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

Allah's Apostle called me to present myself in front of him or the eve
of the battle of Uhud, while I was fourteen years of age at that time,
and he did not allow me to take part in that battle, but he called me in
front of him on the eve of the battle of the Trench when I was fifteen
years old, and he allowed me (to join the battle)." Nafi' said, "I went
to 'Umar bin 'Abdul Aziz who was Caliph at that time and related the
above narration to him, He said, "This age (fifteen) is the limit
between childhood and manhood," and wrote to his governors to give
salaries to those who reached the age of fifteen.
