### Hadith 3:327

*Narrated Hakim bin Hizam:*

The Prophet said, "Both the buyer and the seller have the option of
cancelling or confirming the bargain unless they separate." The
sub-narrator, Hammam said, "I found this in my book: 'Both the buyer and
the seller give the option of either confirming or cancelling the
bargain three times, and if they speak the truth and mention the
defects, then their bargain will be blessed, and if they tell lies and
conceal the defects, they might gain some financial gain but they will
deprive their sale of (Allah's) blessings."
