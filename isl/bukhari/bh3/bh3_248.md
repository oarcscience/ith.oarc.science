### Hadith 3:251

*Narrated Ali bin Al-Husain:*

Safiya, the wife of the Prophet told me that she went to Allah's Apostle
to visit him in the mosque while he was in Itikaf in the last ten days
of Ramadan. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in
order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her. When they reached the
gate of the mosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two Ansari men were
passing by and they greeted Allah's Apostle . He told them: Do not run
away! And said, "She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai." Both of them said,
"Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O Allah's Apostle!" And
they felt it. The Prophet said (to them), "Satan reaches everywhere in
the human body as blood reaches in it, (everywhere in one's body). I was
afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds."
