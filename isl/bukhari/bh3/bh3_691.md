### Hadith 3:692

*Narrated Abu Wail:*

Abdullah (bin Mas'ud) said, "Whoever took a false oath in order to grab
somebody's property will meet Allah while Allah will be angry with him."
Allah revealed the following verse to confirm that:--"Verily! Those who
purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's covenant And their
oaths...a painful torment." (3.77)

Al-Ash'ath bin Qais came to us and asked as to what Abu Abdur-Rehman
(i.e. Ibn Mas'ud) was telling you." We related the story to him. On that
he said, "He has told the truth. This verse was revealed about me. I had
some dispute with another man regarding a well and we took the case
before Allah's Apostle. Allah's Apostle said (to me), "Produce two
witnesses (to support your claim); otherwise the defendant has the right
to take an oath (to refute your claim).' I said, 'The defendant would
not mind to take a false oath." Allah's Apostle then said, 'Whoever took
a false oath in order to grab someone else's property will meet Allah,
Allah will be angry with him.' Allah then revealed what Confirmed it."
Al-Ash'ath then recited the following Verse:--"Verily! Those who
purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's covenant, And their oaths .
. . (to) . . . they shall have a painful torment!' (3.77) (See Hadith
No. 546)
