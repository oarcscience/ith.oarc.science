<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:382</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Shihab:</I></P>
that Malik bin Aus said, "I was in need of change for one-hundred 
Dinars. Talha bin 'Ubaid-Ullah called me and we discussed the matter, 
and he agreed to change (my Dinars). He took the gold pieces in his 
hands and fidgeted with them, and then said, "Wait till my storekeeper
comes from the forest." 'Umar was listening to that and said, "By 
Allah! You should not separate from Talha till you get the money from 
him, for Allah's Apostle said, 'The selling of gold for gold is Riba 
(usury) except if the exchange is from hand to hand and equal in 
amount, and similarly, the selling of wheat for wheat is Riba (usury) 
unless it is from hand to hand and equal in amount, and the selling of
barley for barley is usury unless it is from hand to hand and equal in
amount, and dates for dates, is usury unless it is from hand to hand 
and equal in amount"
