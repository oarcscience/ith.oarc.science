### Hadith 3:37

*Narrated Salim:*

(Abdullah) bin 'Umar used to say, "Is not (the following of) the
tradition of Allah's Apostle sufficient for you? If anyone of you is
prevented from performing Hajj, he should perform the Tawaf of the Ka'ba
and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram and
everything will become legal for him which was illegal for him (during
the state of Ihram) and he can perform Hajj in a following year and he
should slaughter a Hadi or fast in case he cannot afford the Hadi."

[Next: 3:38: Al-Miswar: Allah's Apostle slaughtered (the Hadi) before he
had his head shaved ...](bh3_37.md)
