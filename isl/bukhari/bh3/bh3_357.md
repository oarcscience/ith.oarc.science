### Hadith 3:360

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Do not go forward to meet the caravan (to buy
from it on the way before it reaches the town). And do not urge buyers
to cancel their purchases to sell them (your own goods) yourselves, and
do not practice Najsh. A town dweller should not sell the goods for the
desert dweller. Do not leave sheep unmilked for a long time, when they
are on sale, and whoever buys such an animal has the option of returning
it, after milking it, along with a Sa of dates or keeping it. it has
been kept unmilked for a long period by the seller (to deceive others).

which has been kept ...](bh3_358)
