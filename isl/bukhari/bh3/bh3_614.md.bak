### Hadith 3:615

*Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:*

A man asked Allah's Apostle about the Luqata. He said, "Make public
announcement of it for one year, then remember the description of its
container and the string it is tied with, utilize the money, and if its
owner comes back after that, give it to him." The people asked, "O
Allah's Apostle! What about a lost sheep?" Allah's Apostle said, "Take
it, for it is for you, for your brother, or for the wolf." The man
asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What about a lost camel?" Allah's Apostle got
angry and his cheeks or face became red, and said, "You have no concern
with it as it has its feet, and its water-container, till its owner
finds it."
