We had some sheep which used to graze at Sala'. One of our slavegirls 
saw a sheep dying and she broke a stone and slaughtered the sheep with
it. My father said to the people, "Don't eat it till I ask the Prophet
about it (or till I send somebody to ask the Prophet)." So, he asked 
or sent somebody to ask the Prophet, and the Prophet permitted him to 
eat it. 'Ubaidullah (a sub-narrator) said, "I admire that girl, for 
though she was a slave-girl, she dared to slaughter the sheep . "
