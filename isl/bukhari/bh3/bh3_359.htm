The Prophet said, "If a slave-girl commits illegal sexual intercourse 
and it is proved beyond doubt, then her owner should lash her and 
should not blame her after the legal punishment. And then if she 
repeats the illegal sexual intercourse he should lash her again and 
should not blame her after the legal punishment, and if she commits it
a third time, then he should sell her even for a hair rope."
