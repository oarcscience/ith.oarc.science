### Hadith 3:537

*Narrated Hanzla bin Qais:*

Rafi bin Khadij said, "My two uncles told me that they (i.e. the
companions of the Prophet) used to rent the land in the life-time of the
Prophet for the yield on the banks of water streams (rivers) or for a
portion of the yield stipulated by the owner of the land. The Prophet
forbade it." I said to Rafi, "What about renting the land for Dinars and
Dirhams?" He replied, "There is no harm in renting for Dinars-Dirhams.
Al-Laith said, "If those who have discernment for distinguishing what is
legal from what is illegal looked into what has been forbidden
concerning this matter they would not permit it, for it is surrounded
with dangers."
