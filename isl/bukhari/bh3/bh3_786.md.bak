### Hadith 3:787

*Narrated 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr:*

We were one-hundred and thirty persons accompanying the Prophet who
asked us whether anyone of us had food. There was a man who had about a
Sa of wheat which was mixed with water then. A very tall pagan came
driving sheep. The Prophet asked him, "Will you sell us (a sheep) or
give it as a present?" He said, "I will sell you (a sheep)." The Prophet
bought a sheep and it was slaughtered. The Prophet ordered that its
liver and other abdominal organs be roasted. By Allah, the Prophet gave
every person of the one-hundred-and-thirty a piece of that; he gave all
those of them who were present; and kept the shares of those who were
absent.The Prophet then put its meat in two huge basins and all of them
ate to their fill, and even then more food was left in the two basins
which were carried on the camel (or said something like it).
