*Narrated Muhammad bin Ali:*

Jabir bin Abdullah said, "When the Prophet died, Abu Bakr received some
property from Al-Ala bin Al-Hadrami. Abu Bakr said to the people,
"Whoever has a money claim on the Prophet, or was promised something by
him, should come to us (so that we may pay him his right)." Jabir added,
"I said (to Abu Bakr), Allah's Apostle promised me that he would give me
