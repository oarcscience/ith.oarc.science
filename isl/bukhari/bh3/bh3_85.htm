twelve Ghazawat with the Prophet said, "I heard four things from 
Allah's Apostle (or I narrate them from the Prophet ) which won my 
admiration and appreciation. They are:
<P>
1. "No lady should travel without her husband or without a Dhu-Mahram 
for a two-days' journey.
<P>
2. No fasting is permissible on two days of 'Id-al-Fitr, and 
'Id-al-Adha.
<P>
3. No prayer (may be offered) after two prayers: after the 'Asr prayer
till the sun set and after the morning prayer till the sun rises.
<P>
4. Not to travel (for visiting) except for three mosques: 
Masjid-al-Haram (in Mecca), my Mosque (in Medina), and Masjid-al-Aqsa 
(in Jerusalem)."
