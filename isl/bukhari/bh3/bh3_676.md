### Hadith 3:677

*Narrated Sulaiman bin Abu Muslim:*

I asked Abu Minhal about money exchange from hand to hand. He said, "I
and a partner of mine bought something partly in cash and partly on
credit." Al-Bara' bin 'Azib passed by us and we asked about it. He
replied, "I and my partner Zaid bin Al-Arqam did the same and then went
to the Prophet and asked him about it. He said, 'Take what was from hand
to hand and leave what was on credit.' "
