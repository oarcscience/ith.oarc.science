### Hadith 3:332

*Narrated Anas:*

A man at Al-Baqi' called, "O Abu-l-Qasim!" The Prophet turned to him and
the man said (to the Prophet ), "I did not intend to call you." The
prophet said, "Name yourselves by my name but not by my kuniya (name)."

[Next: 3:333: Abu Huraira Ad-Dausi: Once the Prophet went out during the
day. Neither did he talk to me ...](bh3_330)
