### Hadith 3:836

*Narrated Abu Wail:*

Abdullah (bin Mas'ud) said, "Whoever takes a (false) oath in order to
grab some property (unjustly), Allah will be angry with him when he will
meet Him. Allah confirmed that through His Divine Revelation: "Verily!
Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and
their oaths . . . they will have a painful punishment." (3.77)

Al-Ash'ath bin Qais came to us and asked, 'What is Abu Abdur-Rahman
(i.e. 'Abdullah) telling you? 'We told him what he was narrating to us.
He said, 'He was telling the truth; this Divine Verse was revealed in
connection with me. There was a dispute between me and another man about
something and the case was filed before Allah's Apostle who said,
'Produce your two witnesses or else the defendant is to take an oath.' I
said, The defendant will surely take a (false) oath caring for nothing.'
The Prophet said, 'Whoever takes a false oath in order to grab (other's)
property, then Allah will be angry with him when he will meet Him.' Then
Allah revealed its confirmation. Al-Ashath then recited the above Divine
Verse." (3.77)
