<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:298</H3><P><I>Narrated Samura bin Jundab:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "This night I dreamt that two men came and took me 
to a Holy land whence we proceeded on till we reached a river of 
blood, where a man was standing, and on its bank was standing another 
man with stones in his hands. The man in the  middle of the river 
tried to come out, but the other threw a stone in his mouth and forced
him to go back to his original place. So, whenever he tried to come 
out, the other man would throw a stone in his mouth and force him to 
go back to his former place. I asked, 'Who is this?' I was told, 'The 
person in the river was a Riba-eater."
