### Hadith 3:763

*Narrated Asma:*

Once I said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have no property except what has been
given to me by Az-Zubair (i.e. her husband). May I give in charity?" The
Prophet said, "Give in charity and do not withhold it; otherwise Allah
will withhold it back from you . "

[Next: 3:764: Asma: Allah's Apostle said, Give (in charity) and do not
give reluctantly ...](bh3_763.md)
