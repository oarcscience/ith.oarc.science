### Hadith 3:746

*Narrated Anas:*

We chased a rabbit at Mar-al-Zahran and the people ran after it but were
exhausted. I overpowered and caught it, and gave it to Abu Talha who
slaughtered it and sent its hip or two thighs to Allah's Apostle. (The
narrator confirms that he sent two thighs). The Prophet accepted that.
(The sub-narrator asked Anas, "Did the Prophet; eat from it?" Anas
replied, "He ate from it.")
