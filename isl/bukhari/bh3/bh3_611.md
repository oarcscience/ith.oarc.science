### Hadith 3:612

*Narrated Anas:*

The Prophet passed a date fallen on the way and said, "Were I not afraid
that it may be from a Sadaqa (charitable gifts), I would have eaten it."

and find a date fallen on my bed, I pick it up in order to eat it, but I
fear that it might be from a Sadaqa, so I throw it."
