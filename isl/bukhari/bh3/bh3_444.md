Abdullah bin Shaddad and Abu Burda sent me to 'Abdullah bin Abi Aufa and
told me to ask 'Abdullah whether the people in the life-time of the
Prophet used to pay in advance for wheat (to be delivered later).
Abdullah replied, "We used to pay in advance to the peasants of Sham for
wheat, barley and olive oil of a known specified measure to be delivered
in a specified period." I asked (him), "Was the price paid (in advance)

replied, "We did not use to ask them about that." Then they sent me to
'Abdur Rahman bin Abza and I asked him. He replied, "The companions of

we did not use to ask them whether they had standing crops or not."
