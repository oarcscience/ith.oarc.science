### Hadith 3:264

*Narrated Ibrahim bin Sad from his father from his grand-father:*

Abdur Rahman bin Auf said, "When we came to Medina as emigrants, Allah's
Apostle established a bond of brotherhood between me and Sad bin
Ar-Rabi'. Sad bin Ar-Rabi' said (to me), 'I am the richest among the
Ansar, so I will give you half of my wealth and you may look at my two
wives and whichever of the two you may choose I will divorce her, and
when she has completed the prescribed period (before marriage) you may
marry her.' Abdur-Rahman replied, "I am not in need of all that. Is
there any market-place where trade is practiced?' He replied, "The
market of Qainuqa." Abdur-Rahman went to that market the following day
and brought some dried butter-milk (yogurt) and butter, and then he
continued going there regularly. Few days later, 'AbdurRahman came
having traces of yellow (scent) on his body. Allah's Apostle asked him
whether he had got married. He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet
said, 'Whom have you married?' He replied, 'A woman from the Ansar.'
Then the Prophet asked, 'How much did you pay her?' He replied, '(I gave
her) a gold piece equal in weigh to a date stone (or a date stone of
gold)! The Prophet said, 'Give a Walima (wedding banquet) even if with
one sheep .' "
