### Hadith 3:135

*Narrated Anas:*

Allah's Apostle vowed to keep aloof from his wives for one month, and he
had dislocation of his leg. So, he stayed in a Mashruba for 29 nights
and then came down. Some people said, "O Allah's Apostle! You vowed to
stay aloof for one month," He replied, "The month is of 29 days."
