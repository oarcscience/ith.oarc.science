### Hadith 3:535

*Narrated Nafi:*

Ibn 'Umar used to rent his farms in the time of Abu Bakr, 'Umar,
'Uthman, and in the early days of Muawiya. Then he was told the
narration of Rafi 'bin Khadij that the Prophet had forbidden the renting
of farms. Ibn 'Umar went to Rafi' and I accompanied him. He asked Rafi
who replied that the Prophet had forbidden the renting of farms. Ibn
'Umar said, "You know that we used to rent our farms in the life-time of
Allah's Apostle for the yield of the banks of the water streams (rivers)
