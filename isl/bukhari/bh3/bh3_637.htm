(the wife of the Prophet)  Allah's Apostle heard some people 
quarreling at the door of his dwelling. He came out and said, "I am 
only a human being, and opponents come to me (to settle their 
problems); maybe someone amongst you can present his case more 
eloquently than the other, whereby I may consider him true and give a 
verdict in his favor. So, If I give the right of a Muslim to another 
by mistake, then it is really a portion of (Hell) Fire, he has the 
option to take or give up (before the Day of Resurrection)."
