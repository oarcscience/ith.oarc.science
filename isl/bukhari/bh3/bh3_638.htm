<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:639</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Whoever has (the following) four characters will be
a hypocrite, and whoever has one of the following four characteristics
will have one characteristic of hypocrisy until he gives it up. These 
are: (1 ) Whenever he talks, he tells a lie; (2) whenever he makes a 
promise, he breaks it; (3) whenever he makes a covenant he proves 
treacherous; (4) and whenever he quarrels, he behaves impudently in an
evil insulting manner." (See Hadith No. 33 Vol. 1)
