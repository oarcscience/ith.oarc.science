The Prophet heard a man (reciting Quran) in the Mosque, and he said, 
"May Allah bestow His Mercy upon him. No doubt, he made me remember 
such-and such Verses of such-and-such Sura which I dropped (from my 
memory).
<P>
and then he heard the voice of 'Abbas who was praying in the Mosque, 
and said, "O 'Aisha! Is this 'Abbad's voice?" I said, "Yes." He said, 
"O Allah! Be merciful to 'Abbas!"
