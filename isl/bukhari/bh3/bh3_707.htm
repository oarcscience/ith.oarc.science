<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:708</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
On my way to the Prophet I was reciting:-- 'What a long tedious 
tiresome night! Nevertheless, it has saved us From the land of Kufr 
(disbelief).' I had a slave who ran away from me on the way. When I 
went to the Prophet and gave the pledge of allegiance for embracing 
Islam, the slave showed up while I was still with the Prophet who 
remarked, "O Abu Huraira! Here is your slave!" I said, "I manumit him 
for Allah's Sake," and so I freed him.
