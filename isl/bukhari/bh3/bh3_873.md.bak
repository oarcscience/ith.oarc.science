### Hadith 3:874

*Narrated Marwan and al-Miswar bin Makhrama:*

(from the companions of Allah's Apostle) When Suhail bin Amr agreed to
the Treaty (of Hudaibiya), one of the things he stipulated then, was
that the Prophet should return to them (i.e. the pagans) anyone coming
to him from their side, even if he was a Muslim; and would not interfere
between them and that person. The Muslims did not like this condition
and got disgusted with it. Suhail did not agree except with that
condition. So, the Prophet agreed to that condition and returned Abu
Jandal to his father Suhail bin 'Amr. Thenceforward the Prophet returned
everyone in that period (of truce) even if he was a Muslim. During that
period some believing women emigrants including Um Kalthum bint Uqba bin
Abu Muait who came to Allah's Apostle and she was a young lady then. Her
relative came to the Prophet and asked him to return her, but the
Prophet did not return her to them for Allah had revealed the following
Verse regarding women:

"O you who believe! When the believing women come to you as emigrants.
Examine them, Allah knows best as to their belief, then if you know them
for true believers, Send them not back to the unbelievers, (for) they
are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers, Nor are the unbelievers
lawful (husbands) for them (60.10)

according to this Verse: "O you who believe! When the believing women
come to you, as emigrants test them . . . for Allah is Oft-Forgiving,
Most Merciful." (60.10-12) Aisha said, "When any of them agreed to that
condition Allah's Apostle would say to her, 'I have accepted your pledge
of allegiance.' He would only say that, but, by Allah he never touched
the hand of any women (i.e. never shook hands with them) while taking
the pledge of allegiance and he never took their pledge of allegiance
except by his words (only)."
