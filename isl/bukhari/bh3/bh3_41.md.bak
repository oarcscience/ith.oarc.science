### Hadith 3:42

*Narrated Ka'b bin 'Umra:*

Allah's Apostle stood beside me at Al-Hudaibiya and the lice were
falling from my head in great number. He asked me, "Have your lice
troubled you?" I replied in the affirmative. He ordered me to get my
head shaved. Ka'b added, "This Holy Verse:--'And if any of you is ill,
or has ailment in his scalp (2.196), etc. was revealed regarding me.
"The Prophet then ordered me either to fast three days, or to feed six
poor persons with one Faraq (three Sas) (of dates), or to slaughter a
sheep, etc (sacrifice) whatever was available.
