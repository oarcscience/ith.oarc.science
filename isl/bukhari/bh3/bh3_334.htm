<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:337</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir:</I></P>
Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Haram died and was in debt to others. I asked 
the Prophet to intercede with his creditors for some reduction in the 
debts. The Prophet requested them (to reduce the debts) but they 
refused. The Prophet said to me, "Go and put your dates (In heaps) 
according to their different kinds. The Ajwa on one side, the cluster 
of Ibn Zaid on another side, etc.. Then call me." I did that and 
called the Prophet He came and sat at the head or in the middle of the
heaps and ordered me. Measure (the dates) for the people (creditors)."
I measured for them till I paid all the debts. My dates remained as it
nothing had been taken from them. In other narrations, Jabir said; The
Prophet said, "He (i.e. 'Abdullah) continued measuring for them till 
he paid all the debts." The Prophet said (to 'Abdullah), "Cut 
(clusters) for him (i.e. one of the creditors) and measure for him 
fully."
