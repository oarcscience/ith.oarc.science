### Hadith 3:252

*Narrated Abu Salama bin 'Abdur-Rahman:*

I asked Abu Said Al-Khudri, "Did you hear Allah's Apostle talking about
the Night of Qadr?" He replied in the affirmative and said, "Once we
were in Itikaf with Allah's Apostle in the middle ten days of (Ramadan)
and we came out of it in the morning of the twentieth, and Allah's
Apostle- delivered a sermon on the 20th (of Ramadan) and said, 'I was
informed (of the date) of the Night of Qadr (in my dream) but had
forgotten it. So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights
of the month of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and water on
that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had been in
Itikaf with Allah's Apostle should return for it.' The people returned
to the mosque (for Itikaf). There was no trace of clouds in the sky. But
all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the prayer was
established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah's Apostle prostrated
in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the nose of the
Prophet.
