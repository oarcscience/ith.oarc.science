### Hadith 3:851

*Narrated An-Nu'man bin Bashir:*

The Prophet said, "The example of the person abiding by Allah's orders
and limits (or the one who abides by the limits and regulations
prescribed by Allah) in comparison to the one who do wrong and violate
Allah's limits and orders is like the example of people drawing lots for
seats in a boat. Some of them got seats in the upper part while the
others in the lower part ; those in the, lower part have to pass by
those in the upper one to get water, and that troubled the latter. One
of them (i.e. the people in the lower part) took an axe and started
making a hole in the bottom of the boat. The people of the upper part
came and asked him, (saying), 'What is wrong with you?' He replied, "You
have been troubled much by my (coming up to you), and I have to get
water.' Now if they prevent him from doing that they will save him and
themselves, but if they leave him (to do what he wants), they will
destroy him and themselves."
