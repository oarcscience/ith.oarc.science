<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:864</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle set out for the 'Umra but the pagans of Quraish 
prevented him from reaching the Ka'ba. So, he slaughtered his 
sacrifice and got his head shaved at Al-Hudaibiya, and agreed with 
them that he would perform 'Umra the following year and would not 
carry weapons except swords and would not stay in Mecca except for the
period they al lowed. So, the Prophet performed the 'Umra in the 
following year and entered Mecca according to the treaty, and when he 
stayed for three days, the pagans ordered him to depart, and he 
departed.
