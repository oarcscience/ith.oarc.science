<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:701</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "He who manumits his share of a slave and has money 
sufficient to free the remaining portion of that slave's price (justly
estimated) then he should manumit him (by giving the rest of his price
to the other co-owners)." Nafi' added, "Otherwise the slave is 
partially free." Aiyub is not sure whether the last statement was said
by Nafi' or it was a part of the Hadith.
