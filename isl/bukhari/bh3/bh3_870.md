### Hadith 3:871

*Narrated Urwa bin Az-Zubair:*

Az-Zubair told me that he quarrelled with an Ansari man who had
participated in (the battle of) Badr in front of Allah's Apostle about a
water stream which both of them used for irrigation. Allah's Apostle
said to Az-Zubair, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your garden) first, and then let
the water flow to your neighbor." The Ansari became angry and said, "O
Allah's Apostle! Is it because he is your cousin?" On that the
complexion of Allah's Apostle changed (because of anger) and said (to
Az-Zubair), "I irrigate (your garden) and then with-hold the water till
it reaches the walls (surrounding the palms)." So, Allah's Apostle gave
Az-Zubair his full right. Before that Allah's Apostle had given a
generous judgment beneficial for Az-Zubair and the Ansari, but when the
Ansan irritated Allah's Apostle he gave Az-Zubair his full right
according to the evident law. Az-Zubair said, "By Allah ! I think the
following Verse was revealed concerning that case: "But no by your Lord
They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between
them." (4.65)
