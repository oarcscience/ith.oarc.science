### Hadith 3:671

*Narrated Nafi:*

Ibn 'Umar said, "Allah's Apostle said, 'If one manumits his share of a
jointly possessed slave, and can afford the price of the other shares
according to the adequate price of the slave, the slave will be
completely manumitted; otherwise he will be partially manumitted.' "
(Aiyub, a sub-narrator is not sure whether the saying " ... otherwise he
will be partially manumitted" was said by Nafi' or the Prophet.)

[Next: 3:672: Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, Whoever manumits his share
of a jointly possessed ...](bh3_671)
