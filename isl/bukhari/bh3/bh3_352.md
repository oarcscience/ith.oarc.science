### Hadith 3:355

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet forbade two kinds of dressing; (one of them) is to sit with
one's legs drawn up while wrapped in one garment. (The other) is to lift
that garment on one's shoulders. And also forbade two kinds of sale:
Al-Limas and An-Nibadh.

and Munabadha....](bh3_353.md)
