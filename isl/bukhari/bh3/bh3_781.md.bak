### Hadith 3:782

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Umar:*

Umar bin Al-Khattab saw a silken dress (cloak) being sold at the gate of
the Mosque and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Would that you buy it and wear
it on Fridays and when the delegates come to you!" Allah's Apostle said,
"This is worn by the one who will have no share in the Hereafter." Later
on some silk dresses were brought and Allah's Apostle sent one of them
to 'Umar. 'Umar said, "How do you give me this to wear while you said
what you said about the dress of 'Utarid?" Allah's Apostle said, "I have
not given it to you to wear." So, 'Umar gave it to a pagan brother of
his in Mecca.
