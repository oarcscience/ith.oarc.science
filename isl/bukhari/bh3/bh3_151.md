### Hadith 3:154

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "If somebody eats or drinks forgetfully then he should
complete his fast, for what he has eaten or drunk, has been cleaning his
teeth with Siwak while he was fasting so many times as I can't count."
And narrated Abu Huraira, "The Prophet said, 'But for my fear that it
would be hard for my followers, I would have ordered them to clean their
teeth with Siwak on every performance of ablution." The same is narrated
by Jabir and Zaid bin Khalid from the Prophet who did not differentiate
between a fasting and a nonfasting person in this respect (using Siwak).

Aisha said, "The Prophet said, "It (i.e. Siwak) is a purification for
the mouth and it is a way of seeking Allah's pleasures." Ata' and Qatada
said, "There is no harm in swallowing the resultant saliva."
