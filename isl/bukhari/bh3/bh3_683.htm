<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:684</H3><P><I>Narrated Abaya bin Rifaa:</I></P>
My grandfather, Rafi bin Khadij said, "We were in the valley of 
Dhul-Hulaifa of Tuhama in the company of the Prophet and had some 
camels and sheep (of the booty). The people hurried (in slaughtering 
the animals) and put their meat in the pots and started cooking. 
Allah's Apostle came and ordered them to upset the pots, and 
distributed the booty considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. One
of the camels fled and the people had only a few horses, so they got 
worried. (The camel was chased and) a man slopped the camel by 
throwing an arrow at it. Allah's Apostle said, 'Some of these animals 
are untamed like wild animals, so if anyone of them went out of your 
control, then you should treat it as you have done now.' " My 
grandfather said, "O Allah's Apostle! We fear that we may meet our 
enemy tomorrow and we have no knives, could we slaughter the animals 
with reeds?" The Prophet said, "Yes, or you can use what would make 
blood flow (slaughter) and you can eat what is slaughtered and the 
Name of Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughtering. But don't use 
teeth or fingernails (in slaughtering). I will tell you why, as for 
teeth, they are bones, and fingernails are used by Ethiopians for 
slaughtering.  (See Hadith 668)
