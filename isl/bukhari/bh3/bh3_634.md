### Hadith 3:635

*Narrated Jabala:*

"We were in Medina with some of the Iraqi people, and we were struck
with famine and Ibn Az-Zubair used to give us dates. Ibn 'Umar used to
pass by and say, "The Prophet forbade us to eat two dates at a time,
unless one takes the permission of one's companions."
