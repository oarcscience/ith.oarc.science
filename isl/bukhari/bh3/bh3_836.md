### Hadith 3:837

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

Hilal bin Umaiya accused his wife before the Prophet of committing
illegal sexual intercourse with Sharik bin Sahma.' The Prophet said,
"Produce a proof, or else you would get the legal punishment (by being
lashed) on your back." Hilal said, "O Allah's Apostle! If anyone of us
saw another man over his wife, would he go to search for a proof." The
Prophet went on saying, "Produce a proof or else you would get the legal
punishment (by being lashed) on your back." The Prophet then mentioned
the narration of Lian (as in the Holy Book). (Surat-al-Nur: 24)
