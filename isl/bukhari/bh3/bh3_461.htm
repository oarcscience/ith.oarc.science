The Prophet and Abu Bakr employed a (pagan) man from the tribe of Bani
Ad-Dail and the tribe of Bani 'Abu bin 'Adi as a guide. He was an 
expert guide and he broke the oath contract which he had to abide by 
with the tribe of Al-'Asi bin Wail and he was on the religion of 
Quraish pagans. The Prophet and Abu Bakr had confidence in him and 
gave him their riding camels and told him to bring them to the Cave of
Thaur after three days. So, he brought them their two riding camels 
after three days and both of them (The Prophet and Abu Bakr) set out 
accompanied by 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the Dili guide who guided them 
below Mecca along the road leading to the sea-shore.
