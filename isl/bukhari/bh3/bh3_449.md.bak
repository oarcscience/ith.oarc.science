### Hadith 3:452

*Narrated Abu Al-Bakhtari:*

I asked Ibn 'Umar about Salam for dates. Ibn 'Umar replied, "The Prophet
forbade the sale (the fruits) of datepalms until they were fit for
eating and also forbade the sale of silver for gold on credit." I also
asked Ibn 'Abbas about it. Ibn 'Abbas replied, "The Prophet forbade the
sale of dates till they were fit for eating, and could be weighed." I
asked him, "What is to be weighed (as the dates are on the trees)?" A
man sitting by Ibn 'Abbas said, "It means till they are cut and stored."
