### Hadith 3:785

*Narrated Anas:*

A Jubba (i.e. cloak) made of thick silken cloth was presented to the
Prophet. The Prophet used to forbid people to wear silk. So, the people
were pleased to see it. The Prophet said, "By Him in Whose Hands
Muhammad's soul is, the handkerchiefs of Sad bin Mu'adh in Paradise are
better than this." Anas added, "The present was sent to the Prophet by
Ukaidir (a Christian) from Dauma."
