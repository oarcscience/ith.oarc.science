<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:584</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "I am closer to the believers than their selves in 
this world and in the Hereafter, and if you like, you can read Allah's
Statement: "The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own 
selves." (33.6) So, if a true believer dies and leaves behind some 
property, it will be for his inheritors (from the father's side), and 
if he leaves behind some debt to be paid or needy offspring, then they
should come to me as I am the guardian of the deceased."
