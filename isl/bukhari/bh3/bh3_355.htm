<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:358</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Don't keep camels and sheep unmilked for a long 
time, for whoever buys such an animal has the option to milk it and 
then either to keep it or return it to the owner along with one Sa of 
dates." Some narrated from Ibn Sirin (that the Prophet had said), "One
Sa of wheat, and he has the option for three days." And some narrated 
from Ibn Sirin, " ... a Sa of dates," not mentioning the option for 
three days. But a Sa of dates is mentioned in most narrations.
