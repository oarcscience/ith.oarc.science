Allah's Apostle appointed somebody as a governor of Khaibar. That 
governor brought to him an excellent kind of dates (from Khaibar). The
Prophet asked, "Are all the dates of Khaibar like this?" He replied, 
"By Allah, no, O Allah's Apostle! But we barter one Sa of this (type 
of dates) for two Sas of dates of ours and two Sas of it for three of 
ours." Allah's Apostle said, "Do not do so (as that is a kind of 
usury) but sell the mixed dates (of inferior quality) for money, and 
then buy good dates with that money."
