<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:692</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Wail:</I></P>
Abdullah (bin Mas'ud) said, "Whoever took a false oath in order to 
grab somebody's property will meet Allah while Allah will be angry 
with him." Allah revealed the following verse to confirm 
that:--"Verily! Those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's
covenant And their oaths...a painful torment." (3.77)
<P>
Al-Ash'ath bin Qais came to us and asked as to what Abu Abdur-Rehman 
(i.e. Ibn Mas'ud) was telling you." We related the story to him. On 
that he said, "He has told the truth. This verse was revealed about 
me. I had some dispute with another man regarding a well and we took 
the case before Allah's Apostle. Allah's Apostle said (to me), 
"Produce two witnesses (to support your claim); otherwise the 
defendant has the right to take an oath (to refute your claim).' I 
said, 'The defendant would not mind to take a false oath." Allah's 
Apostle then said, 'Whoever took a false oath in order to grab someone
else's property will meet Allah, Allah will be angry with him.' Allah 
then revealed what Confirmed it." Al-Ash'ath then recited the 
following Verse:--"Verily! Those who purchase a small gain at the cost
of Allah's covenant, And their oaths . . . (to) . . . they shall have 
a painful torment!' (3.77) (See Hadith No. 546)
