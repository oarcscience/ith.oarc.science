### Hadith 3:600

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Ka'b bin Malik:*

Ka'b demanded his debt back from Ibn Abi Hadrad in the Mosque and their
voices grew louder till Allah's Apostle heard them while he was in his
house. He came out to them raising the curtain of his room and addressed
Ka'b, "O Ka'b!" Ka'b replied, "Labaik, O Allah's Apostle." (He said to
him), "Reduce your debt to one half," gesturing with his hand. Kab said,
"I have done so, O Allah's Apostle!" On that the Prophet said to Ibn Abi
Hadrad, "Get up and repay the debt, to him."
