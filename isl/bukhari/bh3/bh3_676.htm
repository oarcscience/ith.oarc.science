<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:677</H3><P><I>Narrated Sulaiman bin Abu Muslim:</I></P>
I asked Abu Minhal about money exchange from hand to hand. He said, "I
and a partner of mine bought something partly in cash and partly on

replied, "I and my partner Zaid bin Al-Arqam did the same and then 
went to the Prophet and asked him about it. He said, 'Take what was 
from hand to hand and leave what was on credit.' "
