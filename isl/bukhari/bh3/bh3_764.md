### Hadith 3:765

*Narrated Kurib:*

the freed slave of Ibn 'Abbas, that Maimuna bint Al-Harith told him that
she manumitted a slave-girl without taking the permission of the
Prophet. On the day when it was her turn to be with the Prophet, she
said, "Do you know, O Allah's Apostle, that I have manumitted my
slave-girl?" He said, "Have you really?" She replied in the affirmative.
He said, "You would have got more reward if you had given her (i.e. the
slave-girl) to one of your maternal uncles."
