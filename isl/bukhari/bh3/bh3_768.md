### Hadith 3:769

*Narrated Abu Humaid Al-Sa'idi:*

The Prophet appointed a man from the tribe of Al-Azd, called Ibn
'Utbiyya for collecting the Zakat. When he returned he said, "This (i.e.
the Zakat) is for you and this has been given to my as a present." The
Prophet said, "Why hadn't he stayed in his father's or mother's house to
see whether he would be given presents or not? By Him in Whose Hands my
life is, whoever takes something from the resources of the Zakat
(unlawfully) will be carrying it on his neck on the Day of Resurrection;
if it be a camel, it will be grunting; if a cow, it will be mooing; and
if a sheep, it will be bleating." The Prophet then raised his hands till
we saw the whiteness of his armpits, and he said thrice, "O Allah!
Haven't I conveyed Your Message (to them)?"
