<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:48</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</I></P>
That his father said "We proceeded with the Prophet in the year of 
Al-Hudaibiya and his companions assumed Ihram but I did not. We were 
informed that some enemies were at Ghaiqa and so we went on towards 
them. My companions saw an onager and some of them started laughing 
among themselves. I looked and saw it. I chased it with my horse and 
stabbed and caught it. I wanted some help from my companions but they 
refused. (I slaughtered it all alone). We all ate from it (i.e. its 
meat). Then I followed Allah's Apostle lest we should be left behind. 
At times I urged my horse to run at a galloping speed and at other 
times at an ordinary slow speed. On the way I met a man from the tribe
of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him where he had left Allah's 
Apostle . The man replied that he had left the Prophet at a place 
called Ta'hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at 
As-Suqya. So, I followed Allah's Apostle till I reached him and said, 
"O Allah's Apostle! I have been sent by my companions who send you 
their greetings and compliments and ask for Allah's Mercy and 
Blessings upon you. They were afraid lest the enemy might intervene 
between you and them; so please wait for them." So he did. Then I 
said, "O Allah's Apostle! We have hunted an onager and have some of it
(i.e. its meat) left over." Allah's Apostle told his companions to eat
the meat although all of them were in a state of Ihram."
