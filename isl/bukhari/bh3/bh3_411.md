is rich, he should take no wages (from the property of the orphans) but
If he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable
(according to his labors)' (4.6) was revealed concerning the guardian of
the orphans who looks after them and manages favorably their financial
affairs; If the guardian Is poor, he could have from It what Is just and
reasonable, (according to his labors)."
