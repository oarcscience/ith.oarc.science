### Hadith 3:662

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "There was an Israeli man called Juraij, while he
was praying, his mother came and called him, but he did not respond to
her call. He said (to himself) whether he should continue the prayer or
reply to his mother. She came to him the second time and called him and
said, "O Allah! Do not let him die until he sees the faces of
prostitutes." Juraij used to live in a hermitage. A woman said that she
would entice Juraij, so she went to him and presented herself (for an
evil act) but he refused. She then went to a shepherd and allowed him to
commit an illegal sexual intercourse with her and later she gave birth
to a boy. She alleged that the baby was from Juraij. The people went to
Juraij and broke down his hermitage, pulled him out of it and abused
him. He performed ablution and offered the prayer, then he went to the
male (baby) and asked him; "O boy! Who is your father?" The baby replied
that his father was the shepherd. The people said that they would build
for him a hermitage of gold but Juraij asked them to make it of mud
only."
