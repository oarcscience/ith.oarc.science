### Hadith 3:468

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

The Prophet said, "Your example and the example of the people of the two
Scriptures (i.e. Jews and Christians) is like the example of a man who
employed some laborers and asked them, 'Who will work for me from
morning till midday for one Qirat?' The Jews accepted and carried out
the work. He then asked, Who will work for me from midday up to the 'Asr
prayer for one Qirat?' The Christians accepted and fulfilled the work.
He then said, 'Who will work for me from the 'Asr till sunset for two
Qirats?' You, Muslims have accepted the offer. The Jews and the
Christians got angry and said, 'Why should we work more and get lesser
wages?' (Allah) said, 'Have I with-held part of your right?' They
replied in the negative. He said, 'It is My Blessing, I bestow upon
whomever I wish .'
