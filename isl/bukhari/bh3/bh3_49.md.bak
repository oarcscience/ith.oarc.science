### Hadith 3:50

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:*

That his father had told him that Allah's Apostle set out for Hajj and
so did his companions. He sent a batch of his companions by another
route and Abu Qatada was one of them. The Prophet said to them, "Proceed
along the sea-shore till we meet all together." So, they took the route
of the sea-shore, and when they started all of them assumed Ihram except
Abu Qatada. While they were proceeding on, his companions saw a group of
onagers. Abu Qatada chased the onagers and attacked and wounded a
she-onager. They got down and ate some of its meat and said to each
other: "How do we eat the meat of the game while we are in a state of
Ihram?" So, we (they) carried the rest of the she-onager's meat, and
when they met Allah's Apostle they asked, saying, "O Allah's Apostle! We
assumed Ihram with the exception of Abu Qatada and we saw (a group) of
onagers. Abu Qatada attacked them and wounded a she-onager from them.
Then we got down and ate from its meat. Later, we said, (to each other),
'How do we eat the meat of the game and we are in a state of Ihram?' So,
we carried the rest of its meat. The Prophet asked, "Did anyone of you
order Abu Qatada to attack it or point at it?" They replied in the
negative. He said, "Then eat what is left of its meat."
