Allah's Apostle came to me and I told him about the slave-girl 
(Buraira) Allah's Apostle said, "Buy and manumit her, for the Wala is 
for the one who manumits." In the evening the Prophet got up and

Whoever imposes such a condition as is not in Allah's Laws, then that 
condition is invalid even if he imposes one hundred conditions, for 
Allah's conditions are more binding and reliable."
