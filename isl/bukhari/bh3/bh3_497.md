### Hadith 3:499

*Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri and Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle employed someone as a governor at Khaibar. When the man
came to Medina, he brought with him dates called Janib. The Prophet
asked him, "Are all the dates of Khaibar of this kind?" The man replied,
"(No), we exchange two Sa's of bad dates for one Sa of this kind of
dates (i.e. Janib), or exchange three Sa's for two." On that, the
Prophet said, "Don't do so, as it is a kind of usury (Riba) but sell the
dates of inferior quality for money, and then buy Janib with the money".
The Prophet said the same thing about dates sold by weight. (See Hadith
No. 506).
