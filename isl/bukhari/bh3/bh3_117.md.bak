### Hadith 3:120

*Narrated Sahl:*

The Prophet said, "There is a gate in Paradise called Ar-Raiyan, and
those who observe fasts will enter through it on the Day of Resurrection
and none except them will enter through it. It will be said, 'Where are
those who used to observe fasts?' They will get up, and none except them
will enter through it. After their entry the gate will be closed and
nobody will enter through it."
