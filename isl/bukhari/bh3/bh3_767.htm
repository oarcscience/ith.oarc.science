<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:768</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:</I></P>
That he heard As-Sa'b bin Jaththama Al-Laithi, who was one of the 
companions of the Prophet, saying that he gave the meat of an onager 
to Allah's Apostle while he was at a place called Al-Abwa' or Waddan, 
and was in a state of Ihram. The Prophet did not accept it. When the 
Prophet saw the signs of sorrow on As-Sa'b's face because of not 
accepting his present, he said (to him), "We are not returning your 
present, but we are in the state of Ihram." (See Hadith No. 747)
