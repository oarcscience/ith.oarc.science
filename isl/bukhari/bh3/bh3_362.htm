Aisha wanted to buy Buraira and he (the Prophet ) went out for the 
prayer. When he returned, she told him that they (her masters) refused
to sell her except on the condition that her Wala' would go to them. 
The Prophet replied, 'The Wala' would go to him who manumits.' " 
Hammam asked Nafi' whether her (Buraira's) husband was a free man or a
slave. He replied that he did not know.
