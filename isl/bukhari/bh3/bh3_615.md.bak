### Hadith 3:616

*Narrated Suwaid bin Ghafala:*

While I as in the company of Salman bin Rabi'a and Suhan, in one of the
holy battles, I found a whip. One of them told me to drop it but I
refused to do so and said that I would give it to its owner if I found
him, otherwise I would utilize it. On our return we performed Hajj and
on passing by Medina, I asked Ubai bin Ka'b about it. He said, "I found
a bag containing a hundred Dinars in the lifetime of the Prophet and
took it to the Prophet who said to me, 'Make public announcement about
it for one year.' So, I announced it for one year and went to the
Prophet who said, 'Announce it publicly for another year.' So, I
announced it for another year. I went to him again and he said,
"Announce for an other year." So I announced for still another year. I
went to the Prophet for the fourth time, and he said, 'Remember the
amount of money, the description of its container and the string it is
tied with, and if the owner comes, give it to him; otherwise, utilize
it.' "
