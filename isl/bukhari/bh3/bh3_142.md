### Hadith 3:145

*Narrated 'Abdullah:*

The Prophet fasted for days continuously; the people also did the same
but it was difficult for them. So, the Prophet forbade them (to fast
continuously for more than one day). They slid, "But you fast without
break (no food was taken in the evening or in the morning)." The Prophet
replied, "I am not like you, for I am provided with food and drink (by
Allah)."

blessing in it. ...](bh3_143.md)
