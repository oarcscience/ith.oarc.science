Allah's Apostle said, "Everyone of you is a guardian and is 
responsible for his charges. The ruler who has authority over people, 
is a guardian and is responsible for them, a man is a guardian of his 
family and is responsible for them; a woman is a guardian of her 
husband's house and children and is responsible for them; a slave 
('Abu) is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for 
it; so all of you are guardians and are responsible for your 
charges."
