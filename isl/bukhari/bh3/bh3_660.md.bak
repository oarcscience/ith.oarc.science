### Hadith 3:661

*Narrated Anas:*

While the Prophet was with one of his wives, one of the mothers of the
believers (i.e. one of his wives) sent a wooden bowl containing food
with a servant. The wife (in whose house he was sitting) stroke the bowl
with her hand and broke it. The Prophet collected the shattered pieces
and put the food back in it and said, "Eat." He kept the servant and the
bowl till he had eaten the food. Then the Prophet gave another unbroken.
bowl to the servant and kept the broken one.
