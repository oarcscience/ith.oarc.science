### Hadith 3:256

*Narrated Abu Said:*

We practiced Itikaf with Allah's Apostle in the middle ten days (of
Ramadan). In the morning of the twentieth (of Ramadan) we shifted our
baggage, but Allah's Apostle came to us and said, "Whoever was m Itikaf
should return to his place of Itikaf, for I saw (i.e. was informed about
the date of) this Night (of Qadr) and saw myself prostrating in mud and
water." When I returned to my place the sky was overcast with clouds and
it rained. By Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, the sky was covered
with clouds from the end of that day, and the mosque which was roofed
with leaf-stalks of date palm trees (leaked with rain) and I saw the
trace of mud and water over the nose of the Prophet and its tip.
