### Hadith 3:466

*Narrated Ya'la bin Umaya:*

I fought in Jaish-al-Usra (Ghazwa of Tabuk) along with the Prophet and
in my opinion that was the best of my deeds. Then I had an employee, who
quarrel led with someone and one of the them bit and cut the other's
finger and caused his own tooth to fall out. He then went to the Prophet
(with a complaint) but the Prophet cancelled the suit and said to the
complainant, "Did you expect him to let his finger in your mouth so that
you might snap and cut it (as does a stallion camel)?"

a similar story: A man bit the hand of another man and caused his own
tooth to fall out, but Abu Bakr judged that he had no right for
compensation (for the broken tooth).
