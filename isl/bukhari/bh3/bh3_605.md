### Hadith 3:606

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Ka'b bin Malik Al-Ansari from Ka'b bin Malik:*

That 'Abdullah bin Abi Hadrad Al-Aslami owed him some debt. Ka'b met him
and caught hold of him and they started talking and their voices grew
loudest. The Prophet passed by them and addressed Ka'b, pointing out to
him to reduce the debt to one half. So, Ka'b got one half of the debt
and exempted the debtor from the other half.
