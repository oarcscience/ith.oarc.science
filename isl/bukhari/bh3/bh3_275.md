A caravan arrived (at Medina) while we were offering the Jumua prayer
with the Prophet. The people left out for the caravan, with the
exception of twelve persons. Then this Verse was revealed: 'But when
they see some bargain or some amusement, they disperse headlong to it
and leave you standing." (62.11)
