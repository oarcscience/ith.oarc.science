### Hadith 3:629

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Whoever has oppressed another person concerning
his reputation or anything else, he should beg him to forgive him before
the Day of Resurrection when there will be no money (to compensate for
wrong deeds), but if he has good deeds, those good deeds will be taken
from him according to his oppression which he has done, and if he has no
good deeds, the sins of the oppressed person will be loaded on him."
