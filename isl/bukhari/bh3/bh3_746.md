*Narrated As-Sa'b bin Jaththama:*

An onager was presented to Allah's Apostle at the place called Al-Abwa'
or Waddan, but Allah's Apostle rejected it. When the Prophet noticed the
signs of sorrow on the giver's face he said, "We have not rejected your

of Ihram we would have accepted your gift, Fateh-al-Bari page 130, Vol.
