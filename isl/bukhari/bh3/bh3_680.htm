The Prophet said, "Whoever manumits his share o a jointly possessed 
slave, it is imperative on him to manumit the slave completely if he 
has sufficient money to pay the rest of its price which is to be 
estimated justly. He should pay his partners their shares and release 
him (the freed one).
