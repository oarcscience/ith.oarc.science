### Hadith 3:128

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Allah said, 'All the deeds of Adam's sons
(people) are for them, except fasting which is for Me, and I will give
the reward for it.' Fasting is a shield or protection from the fire and
from committing sins. If one of you is fasting, he should avoid sexual
relation with his wife and quarreling, and if somebody should fight or
quarrel with him, he should say, 'I am fasting.' By Him in Whose Hands
my soul is' The unpleasant smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting
person is better in the sight of Allah than the smell of musk. There are
two pleasures for the fasting person, one at the time of breaking his
fast, and the other at the time when he will meet his Lord; then he will
be pleased because of his fasting."
