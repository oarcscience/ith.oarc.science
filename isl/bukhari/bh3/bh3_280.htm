Anas went to the Prophet with barley bread having some dissolved fat 
on it. The Prophet had mortgaged his armor to a Jew in Medina and took
from him some barley for his family. Anas heard him saying, "The 
household of Muhammad did not possess even a single Sa of wheat or 
food grains for the evening meal, although he has nine wives to look 
after." (See Hadith No. 685)
