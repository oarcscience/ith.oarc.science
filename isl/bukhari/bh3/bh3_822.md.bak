### Hadith 3:823

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

The Prophet heard a man (reciting Quran) in the Mosque, and he said,
"May Allah bestow His Mercy upon him. No doubt, he made me remember
such-and such Verses of such-and-such Sura which I dropped (from my
memory).

and then he heard the voice of 'Abbas who was praying in the Mosque, and
said, "O 'Aisha! Is this 'Abbad's voice?" I said, "Yes." He said, "O
Allah! Be merciful to 'Abbas!"
