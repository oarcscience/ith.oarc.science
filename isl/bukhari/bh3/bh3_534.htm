Ibn 'Umar used to rent his farms in the time of Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 
'Uthman, and in the early days of Muawiya. Then he was told the 
narration of Rafi 'bin Khadij that the Prophet had forbidden the 
renting of farms. Ibn 'Umar went to Rafi' and I accompanied him. He 
asked Rafi who replied that the Prophet had forbidden the renting of 
farms. Ibn 'Umar said, "You know that we used to rent our farms in the
life-time of Allah's Apostle for the yield of the banks of the water 
streams (rivers) and for certain amount of figs.
