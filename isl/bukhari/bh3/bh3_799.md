### Hadith 3:800

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:*

That Allah's Apostle said, "There are forty virtuous deeds and the best
of them is the Maniha of a she-goat, and anyone who does one of these
virtuous deeds hoping for Allah's reward with firm confidence that he
will get it, then Allah will make him enter Paradise because of Hassan
(a sub-narrator) said, "We tried to count those good deeds below the
Maniha; we mentioned replying to the sneezer, removing harmful things
from the road, etc., but we failed to count even fifteen."
