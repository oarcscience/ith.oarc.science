### Hadith 3:757

*Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan:*

When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the Prophet he stood
up amongst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah as He deserved, and
said, "Then after: Your brethren have come to you with repentance and I
see it logical to return to them their captives; so whoever amongst you
likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you like
to stick to his share till we give him his right from the very first Fai
(war booty) (1) which Allah will bestow on us, then (he can do so)." The
people replied, "We do that (to return the captives) willingly as a
favor for your sake."
