### Hadith 3:277

*Narrated 'Ubai bin 'Umar:*

Abu Musa asked Umar to admit him but he was not admitted as 'Umar was
busy, so Abu Musa went back. When 'Umar finished his job he said,
"Didn't I hear the voice of 'Abdullah bin Qais? Let him come in." 'Umar
was told that he had left. So, he sent for him and on his arrival, he
(Abu Musa) said, "We were ordered to do so (i.e. to leave if not
admitted after asking permission thrice). 'Umar told him, "Bring witness
in proof of your statement." Abu Musa went to the Ansar's meeting places
and asked them. They said, "None amongst us will give this witness
except the youngest of us, Abu Said Al-Khudri. Abu Musa then took Abu
Said Al-Khudri (to 'Umar) and 'Umar said, surprisingly, "Has this order
of Allah's Apostle been hidden from me?" (Then he added), "I used to be
busy trading in markets."
