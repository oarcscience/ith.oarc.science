### Hadith 3:158

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

A man came to the Prophet and said, "I had sexual intercourse with my
wife on Ramadan (while fasting)." The Prophet asked him, "Can you afford
to manumit a slave?" He replied in the negative. The Prophet asked him,
"Can you fast for two successive months?" He replied in the negative. He
asked him, "Can you afford to feed sixty poor persons?" He replied in
the negative. (Abu Huraira added): Then a basket full of dates was
brought to the Prophet and he said (to that man), "Feed (poor people)
with this by way of atonement." He said, "(Should I feed it) to poorer
people than we? There is no poorer house than ours between its
(Medina's) mountains." The Prophet said, "Then feed your family with
it."
