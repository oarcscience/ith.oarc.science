<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 3:94</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Ali:</I></P>
We have nothing except the Book of Allah and this written paper from 
the Prophet (where-in is written:) Medina is a sanctuary from the 'Air
Mountain to such and such a place, and whoever innovates in it an 
heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it 
will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, none of
his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And
the asylum (of protection) granted by any Muslim is to be secured 
(respected) by all the other Muslims; and whoever betrays a Muslim in 
this respect incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the 
people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship 
will be accepted, and whoever (freed slave) befriends (take as 
masters) other than his manumitters without their permission incurs 
the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his 
compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.
