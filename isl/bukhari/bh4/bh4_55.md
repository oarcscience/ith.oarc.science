### Hadith 4:56

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Um Haram said, "Once the Prophet slept in my house near to me and got up
smiling. I said, 'What makes you smile?' He replied, 'Some of my
followers who (i.e. in a dream) were presented to me sailing on this
green sea like kings on thrones.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Invoke
Allah to make me one of them." So the Prophet invoked Allah for her and
went to sleep again. He did the same (i.e. got up and told his dream)
and Um Haran repeated her question and he gave the same reply. She said,
"Invoke Allah to make me one of them." He said, "You are among the first
batch." Later on it happened that she went out in the company of her
husband 'Ubada bin As-Samit who went for Jihad and it was the first time
the Muslims undertook a naval expedition led by Mu awiya. When the
expedition came to an end and they were returning to Sham, a riding
animal was presented to her to ride, but the animal let her fall and
thus she died.
