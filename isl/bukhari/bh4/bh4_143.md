### Hadith 4:142

*Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa'di :*

Allah's Apostle said, "To guard Muslims from infidels in Allah's Cause
for one day is better than the world and whatever is on its surface, and
a place in Paradise as small as that occupied by the whip of one of you
is better than the world and whatever is on its surface; and a morning's
or an evening's journey which a slave (person) travels in Allah's Cause
is better than the world and whatever is on its surface."
