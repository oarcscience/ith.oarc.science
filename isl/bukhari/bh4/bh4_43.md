### Hadith 4:44

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, "Instruct me as to such a deed
as equals Jihad (in reward)." He replied, "I do not find such a deed."
Then he added, "Can you, while the Muslim fighter is in the
battle-field, enter your mosque to perform prayers without cease and
fast and never break your fast?" The man said, "But who can do that?"
Abu- Huraira added, "The Mujahid (i.e. Muslim fighter) is rewarded even
for the footsteps of his horse while it wanders bout (for grazing) tied
in a long rope."
