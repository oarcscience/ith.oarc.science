<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:162</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
That he participated in a Ghazwa (Holy-Battle) in the company of 
Allah's Apostle. Midday came upon them while they were in a valley 
having many thorny trees. The people dispersed to rest in the shade of
the trees. The Prophet rested under a tree, hung his sword on it, and 
then slept. Then he woke up to find near to him, a man whose presence 
he had not noticed before. The Prophet said, "This (man) took my sword
(out of its scabbard) and said, 'Who will save you from me.' I 
replied, 'Allah.' So, he put the sword back into its scabbard, and you
see him sitting here." Anyhow, the Prophet did not punish him. (See 
Hadith No. 158)
