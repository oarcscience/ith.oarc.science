### Hadith 4:43

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

(That she said), "O Allah's Apostle! We consider Jihad as the best deed.
Should we not fight in Allah's Cause?" He said, "The best Jihad (for
women) is Hajj-Mabrur (i.e. Hajj which is done according to the
Prophet's tradition and is accepted by Allah)."

[Next: 4:44: Abu Huraira: A man came to Allah's Apostle and said,
Instruct me as to such a deed...](bh4_43)
