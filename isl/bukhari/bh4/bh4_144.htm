<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:143</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
The Prophet said to Abu Talha, "Choose one of your boy servants to 
serve me in my expedition to Khaibar." So, Abu Talha took me letting 
me ride behind him while I was a boy nearing the age of puberty. I 
used to serve Allah's Apostle when he stopped to rest. I heard him 
saying repeatedly, "O Allah! I seek refuge with You from distress and 
sorrow, from helplessness and laziness, from miserliness and 
cowardice, from being heavily in debt and from being overcome by men."
Then we reached Khaibar; and when Allah enabled him to conquer the 
Fort (of Khaibar), the beauty of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtab was 
described to him. Her husband had been killed while she was a bride. 
So Allah's Apostle selected her for himself and took her along with 
him till we reached a place called Sad-AsSahba,' where her menses were
over and he took her for his wife. Haris (a kind of dish) was served 
on a small leather sheet. Then Allah's Apostle told me to call those 
who were around me. So, that was the marriage banquet of Allah's 
Apostle and Safiya. Then we left for Medina. I saw Allah's Apostle 
folding a cloak round the hump of the camel so as to make a wide space
for Safiya (to sit on behind him) He sat beside his camel letting his 
knees for Safiya to put her feet on so as to mount the camel. Then, we
proceeded till we approached Medina; he looked at Uhud (mountain) and 
said, "This is a mountain which loves us and is loved by us." Then he 
looked at Medina and said, "O Allah! I make the area between its (i.e.
Medina's) two mountains a sanctuary as Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary.
O Allah! Bless them (i.e. the people of Medina) in their Mudd and Sa 
(i.e. measures)."
