<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:567</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection), 'O 
Adam.' Adam will reply, 'Labbaik wa Sa'daik', and all the good is in 
Your Hand.' Allah will say: 'Bring out the people of the fire.' Adam 
will say: 'O Allah! How many are the people of the Fire?' Allah will 
reply: 'From every one thousand, take out nine-hundred-and 
ninety-nine.' At that time children will become hoary headed, every 
pregnant female will have a miscarriage, and one will see mankind as 
drunken, yet they will not be drunken, but dreadful will be the Wrath 
of Allah." The companions of the Prophet asked, "O Allah's Apostle! 
Who is that (excepted) one?" He said, "Rejoice with glad tidings; one 
person will be from you and one-thousand will be from Gog and Magog."
<P>
The Prophet further said, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, hope that
you will be one-fourth of the people of Paradise." We shouted, "Allahu
Akbar!" He added, "I hope that you will be one-third of the people of 
Paradise." We shouted, "Allahu Akbar!" He said, "I hope that you will 
be half of the people of Paradise." We shouted, "Allahu Akbar!" He 
further said, "You (Muslims) (compared with non Muslims) are like a 
black hair in the skin of a white ox or like a white hair in the skin 
of a black ox (i.e. your number is very small as compared with 
theirs)."
