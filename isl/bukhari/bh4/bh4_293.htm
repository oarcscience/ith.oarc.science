<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:290</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
Umar and a group of the companions of the Prophet set out with the 
Prophet to Ibn Saiyad. He found him playing with some boys near the 
hillocks of Bani Maghala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his 
puberty. He did not notice (the Prophet's presence) till the Prophet 
stroked him on the back with his hand and said, "Ibn Saiyad! Do you 
testify that I am Allah's Apostle?" Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said,
"I testify that you are the Apostle of the illiterates."
<P>
Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet. "Do you testify that I am the 
apostle of Allah?" The Prophet said to him, "I believe in Allah and 
His Apostles." Then the Prophet said (to Ibn Saiyad). "What do you 
see?" Ibn Saiyad replied, "True people and false ones visit me." The 
Prophet said, "Your mind is confused as to this matter." The Prophet 
added, " I have kept something (in my mind) for you." Ibn Saiyad said,
"It is Ad-Dukh." The Prophet said (to him), "Shame be on you! You 
cannot cross your limits." On that 'Umar said, "O Allah's Apostle! 
Allow me to chop his head off." The Prophet said, "If he should be him
(i.e. Ad-Dajjal) then you cannot overpower him, and should he not be 
him, then you are not going to benefit by murdering him."
