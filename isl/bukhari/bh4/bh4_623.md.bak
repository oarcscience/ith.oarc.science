### Hadith 4:620

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

A Muslim and a Jew quarreled. The Muslim taking an oath, said, "By Him
Who has preferred Muhammad over all people...!" The Jew said, "By Him
Who has preferred Moses, over all people." The Muslim raised his hand
and slapped the Jew who came to the Prophet to tell him what had
happened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet said, "Don't give me
superiority over Moses, for the people will become unconscious (on the
Day of Resurrection) and I will be the first to gain consciousness to
see Moses standing and holding a side of Allah's Throne. I will not know
if he has been among those people who have become unconscious; and that
he has gained consciousness before me, or he has been amongst those whom
Allah has exempted."
