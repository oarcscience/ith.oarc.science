### Hadith 4:261

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

A group of eight men from the tribe of 'Ukil came to the Prophet and
then they found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So, they
said, "O Allah's Apostle! Provide us with some milk." Allah's Apostle
said, "I recommend that you should join the herd of camels." So they
went and drank the urine and the milk of the camels (as a medicine) till
they became healthy and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and drove
away the camels, and they became unbelievers after whey were Muslims.
When the Prophet was informed by a shouter for help, he sent some men in
their pursuit, and before the sun rose high, they were brought, and he
had their hands and feet cut off. Then he ordered for nails which were
heated and passed over their eyes, and whey were left in the Harra (i.e.
rocky land in Medina). They asked for water, and nobody provided them
with water till they died (Abu Qilaba, a sub-narrator said, "They
committed murder and theft and fought against Allah and His Apostle, and
spread evil in the land.")
