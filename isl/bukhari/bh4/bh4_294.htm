<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:290</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Umar:</I></P>
(Later on) Allah's Apostle (once again) went along with Ubai bin Ka'b 
to the garden of date-palms where Ibn Saiyad was staying. When the 
Prophet entered the garden, he started hiding himself behind the 
trunks of the date-palms as he wanted to hear something from the Ibn 
Saiyad before the latter could see him. Ibn Saiyad was lying in his 
bed, covered with a velvet sheet from where his murmurs were heard. 
Ibn Saiyad's mother saw the Prophet while he was hiding himself behind
the trunks of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, "O Saf!" (And 
this was his name). Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, "Had this 
woman let him to himself, he would have revealed the reality of his 
case." Then the Prophet got up amongst the people, glorifying Allah as
He deserves, he mentioned Ad-Dajjal, saying, "I warn you about him 
(i.e. Ad-Dajjal) and there is no prophet who did not warn his nation 
about him, and Noah warned his nation about him, but I tell you a 
statement which no prophet informed his nation of. You should 
understand that he is a one-eyed man and Allah is not one-eyed."
