<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:650</H3><P><I>Narrated Salim from his father:</I></P>
No, By Allah, the Prophet did not tell that Jesus was of red 
complexion but said, "While I was asleep circumambulating the Ka'ba 
(in my dream), suddenly I saw a man of brown complexion and lank hair 
walking between two men, and water was dropping from his head. I 
asked, 'Who is this?' The people said, 'He is the son of Mary.' Then I
looked behind and I saw a red-complexioned, fat, curly-haired man, 
blind in the right eye which looked like a bulging out grape. I asked,
'Who is this?' They replied, 'He is Ad-Dajjal.' The one who resembled 
to him among the people, was Ibn Qatar." (Az-Zuhri said, "He (i.e. Ibn
Qatan) was a man from the tribe Khuza'a who died in the pre-lslamic 
period.")
