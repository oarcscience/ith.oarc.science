### Hadith 4:288

*Narrated Said bin Jubair:*

Ibn 'Abbas said, "Thursday! What (great thing) took place on Thursday!"
Then he started weeping till his tears wetted the gravels of the ground
. Then he said, "On Thursday the illness of Allah's Apostle was
aggravated and he said, "Fetch me writing materials so that I may have
something written to you after which you will never go astray." The
people (present there) differed in this matter and people should not
differ before a prophet. They said, "Allah's Apostle is seriously sick.'
The Prophet said, "Let me alone, as the state in which I am now, is
better than what you are calling me for." The Prophet on his death-bed,
gave three orders saying, "Expel the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula,
respect and give gifts to the foreign delegates as you have seen me
dealing with them." I forgot the third (order)" (Ya'qub bin Muhammad
said, "I asked Al-Mughira bin 'Abdur-Rahman about the Arabian Peninsula
and he said, 'It comprises Mecca, Medina, Al-Yama-ma and Yemen." Ya'qub
added, "And Al-Arj, the beginning of Tihama.")
