### Hadith 4:220

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "I have been sent with the shortest expressions
bearing the widest meanings, and I have been made victorious with terror
(cast in the hearts of the enemy), and while I was sleeping, the keys of
the treasures of the world were brought to me and put in my hand." Abu
Huraira added: Allah's Apostle has left the world and now you, people,
are bringing out those treasures (i.e. the Prophet did not benefit by
them).
