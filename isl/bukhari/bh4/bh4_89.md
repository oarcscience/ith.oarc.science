### Hadith 4:88

*Narrated Anas:*

The Emigrants and the Ansar started digging the trench around Medina
carrying the earth on their backs and saying, "We are those who have
given a pledge of allegiance to Muhammad that we will I carry on Jihad
as long as we live." The Prophet kept on replying, "O Allah, there is no
good except the good of the Hereafter; so confer Your Blessings on the
Ansar and the Emigrants."
