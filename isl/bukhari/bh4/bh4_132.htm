<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:131</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
On the day (of the battle) of Uhad when (some) people retreated and 
left the Prophet, I saw 'Aisha bint Abu Bakr and Um Sulaim, with their
robes tucked up so that the bangles around their ankles were visible 
hurrying with their water skins (in another narration it is said, 
"carrying the water skins on their backs"). Then they would pour the 
water in the mouths of the people, and return to fill the water skins 
again and came back again to pour water in the mouths of the people.
