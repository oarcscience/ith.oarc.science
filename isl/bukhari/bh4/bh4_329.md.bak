### Hadith 4:325

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

(mother of the believers) After the death of Allah 's Apostle Fatima the
daughter of Allah's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her
share of inheritance from what Allah's Apostle had left of the Fai (i.e.
booty gained without fighting) which Allah had given him. Abu Bakr said
to her, "Allah's Apostle said, 'Our property will not be inherited,
whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity)."
Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle got angry and stopped speaking
to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima
remained alive for six months after the death of Allah's Apostle.

She used to ask Abu Bakr for her share from the property of Allah's
Apostle which he left at Khaibar, and Fadak, and his property at Medina
(devoted for charity). Abu Bakr refused to give her that property and
said, "I will not leave anything Allah's Apostle used to do, because I
am afraid that if I left something from the Prophet's tradition, then I
would go astray." (Later on) Umar gave the Prophet's property (of
Sadaqa) at Medina to 'Ali and 'Abbas, but he withheld the properties of
Khaibar and Fadak in his custody and said, "These two properties are the
Sadaqa which Allah's Apostle used to use for his expenditures and urgent
needs. Now their management is to be entrusted to the ruler." (Az-Zuhrl
said, "They have been managed in this way till today.")
