I went to the Prophet during the Ghazwa of Tabuk while he was sitting 
in a leather tent. He said, "Count six signs that indicate the 
approach of the Hour: my death, the conquest of Jerusalem, a plague 
that will afflict you (and kill you in great numbers) as the plague 
that afflicts sheep, the increase of wealth to such an extent that 
even if one is given one hundred Dinars, he will not be satisfied; 
then an affliction which no Arab house will escape, and then a truce 
between you and Bani Al-Asfar (i.e. the Byzantines) who will betray 
you and attack you under eighty flags. Under each flag will be twelve 
thousand soldiers.
