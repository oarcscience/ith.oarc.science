Ibn 'Abbas said, "Thursday! What (great thing) took place on 
Thursday!" Then he started weeping till his tears wetted the gravels 
of the ground . Then he said, "On Thursday the illness of Allah's 
Apostle was aggravated and he said, "Fetch me writing materials so 
that I may have something written to you after which you will never go
astray." The people (present there) differed in this matter and people
should not differ before a prophet. They said, "Allah's Apostle is 
seriously sick.' The Prophet said, "Let me alone, as the state in 
which I am now, is better than what you are calling me for." The 
Prophet on his death-bed, gave three orders saying, "Expel the pagans 
from the Arabian Peninsula, respect and give gifts to the foreign 
delegates as you have seen me dealing with them." I forgot the third 
(order)" (Ya'qub bin Muhammad said, "I asked Al-Mughira bin 
'Abdur-Rahman about the Arabian Peninsula and he said, 'It comprises 
Mecca, Medina, Al-Yama-ma and Yemen." Ya'qub added, "And Al-Arj, the 
beginning of Tihama.")
