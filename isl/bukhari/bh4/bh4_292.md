### Hadith 4:289

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

'Umar saw a silken cloak being sold in the market and he brought it to
Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Buy this cloak and adorn
yourself with it on the 'Id festivals and on meeting the delegations."
Allah's Apostle replied, "This is the dress for the one who will have no
share in the Hereafter (or, this is worn by one who will have no share
in the Hereafter)." After sometime had passed, Allah's Apostle sent a
silken cloak to 'Umar. 'Umar took it and brought it to Allah's Apostle
and said, "O Allah's Apostle! You have said that this is the dress of
that who will have no share in the Hereafter (or, this is worn by one
who will have no share in the Hereafter), yet you have sent me this!"
The Prophet said," I have sent it) so that you may sell it or fulfill
with it some of your needs."
