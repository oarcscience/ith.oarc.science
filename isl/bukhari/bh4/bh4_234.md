### Hadith 4:232

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "There is a (compulsory) Sadaqa (charity) to be
given for every joint of the human body (as a sign of gratitude to
Allah) everyday the sun rises. To judge justly between two persons is
regarded as Sadaqa, and to help a man concerning his riding animal by
helping him to ride it or by lifting his luggage on to it, is also
regarded as Sadaqa, and (saying) a good word is also Sadaqa, and every
step taken on one's way to offer the compulsory prayer (in the mosque)
is also Sadaqa and to remove a harmful thing from the way is also
Sadaqa."
