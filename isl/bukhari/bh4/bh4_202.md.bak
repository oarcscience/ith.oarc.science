### Hadith 4:201

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

We set out in the company of Allah's Apostle five days before the end of
Dhul Qa'da intending to perform Hajj only. When we approached Mecca
Allah's Apostle ordered those who did not have the Hadi (i.e. an animal
for sacrifice) with them, to perform the Tawaf around the Ka'ba, and
between Safa and Marwa and then finish their Ihram. Beef was brought to
us on the day of (i.e. the days of slaughtering) and I asked, "What is
this?" Somebody said, Allah's Apostle has slaughtered (a cow) on behalf
of his wives."
