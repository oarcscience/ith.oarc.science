### Hadith 4:439

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

I heard the Prophet saying, "Who ever spends a couple (of objects) in
Allah's cause, will be called by the Gatekeepers of Paradise who will
say, "O so-and-so, come on!" Abu Bakr said, "Such a person will never
perish or be miserable' The Prophet said, "I hope you will be among such
person."
