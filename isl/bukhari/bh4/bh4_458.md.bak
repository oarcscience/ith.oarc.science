### Hadith 4:454

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

That she asked the Prophet , 'Have you encountered a day harder than the
day of the battle) of Uhud?" The Prophet replied, "Your tribes have
troubled me a lot, and the worse trouble was the trouble on the day of
'Aqaba when I presented myself to Ibn 'Abd-Yalail bin 'Abd-Kulal and he
did not respond to my demand. So I departed, overwhelmed with excessive
sorrow, and proceeded on, and could not relax till I found myself at
Qarnath-Tha-alib where I lifted my head towards the sky to see a cloud
shading me unexpectedly. I looked up and saw Gabriel in it. He called me
saying, 'Allah has heard your people's saying to you, and what they have
replied back to you, Allah has sent the Angel of the Mountains to you so
that you may order him to do whatever you wish to these people.' The
Angel of the Mountains called and greeted me, and then said, "O
Muhammad! Order what you wish. If you like, I will let Al-Akh-Shabain
(i.e. two mountains) fall on them." The Prophet said, "No but I hope
that Allah will let them beget children who will worship Allah Alone,
and will worship None besides Him."
