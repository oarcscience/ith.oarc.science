### Hadith 4:395

*Narrated 'Asim:*

I asked Anas about the Qunut (i.e. invocation in the prayer). Anas said,
"It should be recited before bowing." I said, "So-and-so claims that you
say that it should be recited after bowing." He replied, "He is
mistaken." Then Anas narrated to us that the Prophet invoked evil on the
tribe of Bani-Sulaim for one month after bowing. ' Anas Further said,
"The Prophet had sent 40 or 70 Qaris (i.e. men well versed in the
knowledge of the Qur'an) to some pagans, but the latter struggled with
them and martyred them, although there was a peace pact between them and
the Prophet I had never seen the Prophet so sorry and worried about
anybody as he was about them (i.e. the Qaris)."
