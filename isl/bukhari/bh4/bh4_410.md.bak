### Hadith 4:406

*Narrated Abu Wail:*

We were in Siffin and Sahl bin Hunaif got up and said, "O people! Blame
yourselves! We were with the Prophet on the day of Hudaibiya, and if we
had been called to fight, we would have fought. But 'Umar bin Al Khatab
came and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Aren't we in the right and our
opponents in the wrongs' Allah's Apostle said, 'Yes.' 'Umar said,
'Aren't our killed persons in Paradise and their's in Hell?' He said,
'Yes.' 'Umar said, 'Then why should we accept hard terms in matters
concerning our religion? Shall we return before Allah judges between us
and them?' Allah's Apostle said, 'O Ibn Al-Khattab! I am the Apostle of
Allah and Allah will never degrade me. Then 'Umar went to Abu Bakr and
told him the same as he had told the Prophet.

On that Abu Bakr said (to 'Umar). 'He is the Apostle of Allah and Allah
will never degrade him.' Then Surat-al-Fath (i.e. Victory) was revealed
and Allah's Apostle recited it to the end in front of 'Umar. On that
'Umar asked, 'O Allah's Apostle! Was it (i.e. the Hudaibiya Treaty) a
victory?' Allah's Apostle said, "Yes"
