### Hadith 4:305

*Narrated Um Khalid:*

(the daughter of Khalid bin Said) I went to Allah's Apostle with my
father and I was Nearing a yellow shirt. Allah's Apostle said, "Sanah,
Sanah!" ('Abdullah, the narrator, said that 'Sanah' meant 'good' in the
Ethiopian language). I then started playing with the seal of Prophethood
(in between the Prophet's shoulders) and my father rebuked me harshly
for that. Allah's Apostle said. "Leave her," and then Allah's Apostle
(invoked Allah to grant me a long life) by saying (thrice), "Wear this
dress till it is worn out and then wear it till it is worn out, and then
wear it till it is worn out." (The narrator adds, "It is said that she
lived for a long period, wearing that (yellow) dress till its color
became dark because of long wear.")
