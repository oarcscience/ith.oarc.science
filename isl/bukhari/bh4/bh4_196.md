### Hadith 4:195

*Narrated Anas:*

The Prophet set out for Khaibar and reached it at night. He used not to
attack if he reached the people at night, till the day broke. So, when
the day dawned, the Jews came out with their bags and spades. When they
saw the Prophet; they said, "Muhammad and his army!" The Prophet said,
Allahu--Akbar! (Allah is Greater) and Khaibar is ruined, for whenever we
approach a nation (i.e. enemy to fight) then it will be a miserable
morning for those who have been warned."

fight with the people ...](bh4_197)
