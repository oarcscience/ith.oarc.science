### Hadith 4:290

*Narrated Ibn Umar:*

(Later on) Allah's Apostle (once again) went along with Ubai bin Ka'b to
the garden of date-palms where Ibn Saiyad was staying. When the Prophet
entered the garden, he started hiding himself behind the trunks of the
date-palms as he wanted to hear something from the Ibn Saiyad before the
latter could see him. Ibn Saiyad was lying in his bed, covered with a
velvet sheet from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad's mother saw
the Prophet while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the
date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, "O Saf!" (And this was his name).
Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, "Had this woman let him to himself,
he would have revealed the reality of his case." Then the Prophet got up
amongst the people, glorifying Allah as He deserves, he mentioned
Ad-Dajjal, saying, "I warn you about him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) and there is
no prophet who did not warn his nation about him, and Noah warned his
nation about him, but I tell you a statement which no prophet informed
his nation of. You should understand that he is a one-eyed man and Allah
is not one-eyed."
