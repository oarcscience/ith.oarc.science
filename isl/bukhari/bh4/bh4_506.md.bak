### Hadith 4:502

*Narrated Sulaiman bin Surd:*

While I was sitting in the company of the Prophet, two men abused each
other and the face of one of them became red with anger, and his jugular
veins swelled (i.e. he became furious). On that the Prophet said, "I
know a word, the saying of which will cause him to relax, if he does say

will go away." Some body said to him, "The Prophet has said, 'Seek
refuge with Allah from Satan."' The angry man said, "Am I mad?"
