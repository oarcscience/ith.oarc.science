### Hadith 4:636

*Narrated Abu Dhaar:*

I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Which mosque was built first?" He replied,
"Al-Masjid-ul-Haram." I asked, "Which (was built) next?" He replied,
"Al-Masjid-ul-Aqs-a (i.e. Jerusalem)." I asked, "What was the period in
between them?" He replied, "Forty (years)." He then added, "Wherever the
time for the prayer comes upon you, perform the prayer, for all the
earth is a place of worshipping for you."
