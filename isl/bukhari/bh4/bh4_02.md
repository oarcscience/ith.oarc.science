### Hadith 4:3

*Narrated Talha bin Musarrif:*

I asked 'Abdullah bin Abu Aufa "Did the Prophet make a will?" He
replied, "No," I asked him, "How is it then that the making of a will
has been enjoined on people, (or that they are ordered to make a will)?"
He replied, "The Prophet bequeathed Allah's Book (i.e. Quran)."
