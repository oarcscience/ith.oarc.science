<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:141</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "Charity is obligatory everyday on every joint of a 
human being. If one helps a person in matters concerning his riding 
animal by helping him to ride it or by lifting his luggage on to it, 
all this will be regarded charity. A good word, and every step one 
takes to offer the compulsory Congregational prayer, is regarded as 
charity; and guiding somebody on the road is regarded as charity."
