### Hadith 4:383

*Narrated Ibn Abi Aufa:*

We were afflicted with hunger during the besiege of Khaibar, and when it
was the day of (the battle of) Khaibar, we slaughtered the donkeys and
when the pots got boiling (with their meat). Allah's Apostle made an
announcement that all the pots should be upset and that nobody should
eat anything of the meat of the donkeys. We thought that the Prophet
prohibited that because the Khumus had not been taken out of the booty
(i.e. donkeys); other people said, "He prohibited eating them for ever."
The sub-narrator added, "I asked Said bin Jubair who said, 'He has made
the eating of donkeys' meat illegal for ever.")
