### Hadith 4:649

*Narrated Abdullah:*

The Prophet mentioned the Massiah Ad-Dajjal in front of the people
saying, Allah is not one eyed while Messsiah, Ad-Dajjal is blind in the
right eye and his eye looks like a bulging out grape. While sleeping
near the Ka'ba last night, I saw in my dream a man of brown color the
best one can see amongst brown color and his hair was long that it fell
between his shoulders. His hair was lank and water was dribbling from
his head and he was placing his hands on the shoulders of two men while
circumambulating the Kaba. I asked, 'Who is this?' They replied, 'This
is Jesus, son of Mary.' Behind him I saw a man who had very curly hair
and was blind in the right eye, resembling Ibn Qatan (i.e. an infidel)
in appearance. He was placing his hands on the shoulders of a person
while performing Tawaf around the Ka'ba. I asked, 'Who is this? 'They
replied, 'The Masih, Ad-Dajjal.' "
