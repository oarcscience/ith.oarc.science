<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:8</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
(the wife of the Prophet)  Utba bin Abi Waqqas entrusted (his son) to 
his brother Sad bin Abi Waqqas saying, "The son of the slave-girl of 
Zam'a is my (illegal) son, take him into your custody." So during the 
year of the Conquest (of Mecca) Sad took the boy and said, "This is my
brother's son whom my brother entrusted to me." 'Abu bin Zam's got up 
and said, "He is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father
and was born on my father's bed." Then both of them came to Allah's 
Apostle and Sad said, "O Allah's Apostle! This is my brother's son 
whom my brother entrusted to me."
<P>
Then 'Abu bin Zam'a got up and said, "This is my brother and the son 
of the slave-girl of my father." Allah's Apostle said, "O Abu bin 
Zam'a! This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where he was
born), and for the adulterer is the stone (i.e. deprivation)." Then 
the Prophet said to his wife Sauda bint Zam'a, "Screen yourself from 
this boy," when he saw the boy's resemblance to 'Utba. Since then the 
boy did not see Sauda till he died.
