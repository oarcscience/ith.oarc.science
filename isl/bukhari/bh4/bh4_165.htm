<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:164</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:</I></P>
The Prophet , while in a tent (on the day of the battle of Badr) said,
"O Allah! I ask you the fulfillment of Your Covenant and Promise. O 
Allah! If You wish (to destroy the believers) You will never be 
worshipped after today." Abu Bakr caught him by the hand and said, 
"This is sufficient, O Allah's Apostle! You have asked Allah 
pressingly." The Prophet was clad in his armor at that time. He went 
out, saying to me: "There multitude will be put to flight and they 
will show their backs. Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for 
their full recompense) and that Hour will be more grievous and more 
bitter (than their worldly failure)." (54.45-46) Khalid said that was 
on the day of the battle of Badr.
