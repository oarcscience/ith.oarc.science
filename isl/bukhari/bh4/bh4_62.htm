<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:63</H3><P><I>Narrated Al-Bara:</I></P>
A man whose face was covered with an iron mask (i.e. clad in armor) 
came to the Prophet and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Shall I fight or 
embrace Islam first? "The Prophet said, "Embrace Islam first and then 
fight." So he embraced Islam, and was martyred. Allah's Apostle said, 
A Little work, but a great reward. "(He did very little (after 
embracing Islam), but he will be rewarded in abundance)."
