### Hadith 4:628

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "The reciting of the Zabur (i.e. Psalms) was made easy
for David. He used to order that his riding animals be saddled, and
would finish reciting the Zabur before they were saddled. And he would
never eat except from the earnings of his manual work."
