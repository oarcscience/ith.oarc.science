### Hadith 4:419

*Narrated Abu Bakra:*

The Prophet said. "(The division of time has turned to its original form
which was current when Allah created the Heavens and the Earths. The
year is of twelve months, out of which four months are sacred: Three are
in succession Dhul-Qa' da, Dhul-Hijja and Muharram, and (the fourth is)
Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumadi-ath-Thaniyah
and Sha ban."
