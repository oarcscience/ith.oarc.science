### Hadith 4:410

*Narrated Anas:*

The Prophet said, ''Every betrayer will have a flag on the Day of
Resurrection" One of the two sub-narrators said that the flag would be
fixed, and the other said that it would be shown on the Day of
Resurrection, so that the betrayer might be recognized by it.

[Next: 4:411: Ibn Umar: The Prophet said, Every betrayer will have a
flag which will be fixed...](bh4_415)
