### Hadith 4:124

*Narrated Anas:*

The Prophet had a she camel called Al Adba which could not be excelled
in a race. (Humaid, a sub-narrator said, "Or could hardly be excelled.")
Once a bedouin came riding a camel below six years of age which
surpasses it (i.e. Al'Adba) in the race. The Muslims felt it so much
that the Prophet noticed their distress. He then said, "It is Allah's
Law that He brings down whatever rises high in the world."
