### Hadith 4:303

*Narrated Ibn Umar:*

That he was riding a horse on the day, the Muslims fought (against the
Byzantines), and the commander of the Muslim army was Khalid bin
Al-Walid who had been appointed by Abu Bakr. The enemy took the horse
away, and when the enemy was defeated, Khalid returned the horse to him.
