<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:489</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Wail:</I></P>
Somebody said to Usama, "Will you go to so-and-so (i.e. 'Uthman) and 
talk to him (i.e. advise him regarding ruling the country)?" He said, 
"You see that I don't talk to him. Really I talk to (advise) him 
secretly without opening a gate (of affliction), for neither do I want
to be the first to open it (i.e. rebellion), nor will I say to a man 
who is my ruler that he is the best of all the people after I have 
heard something from Allah s Apostle ." They said, What have you heard
him saying? He said, "I have heard him saying, "A man will be brought 
on the Day of Resurrection and thrown in the (Hell) Fire, so that his 
intestines will come out, and he will go around like a donkey goes 
around a millstone. The people of (Hell) Fire will gather around him 
and say: O so-and-so! What is wrong with you? Didn't you use to order 
us to do good deeds and forbid us to do bad deeds? He will reply: Yes,
I used to order you to do good deeds, but I did not do them myself, 
and I used to forbid you to do bad deeds, yet I used to do them 
myself."
