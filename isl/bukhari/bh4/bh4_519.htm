Once Umar asked the leave to see Allah's Apostle in whose company 
there were some Quraishi women who were talking to him and asking him 
for more financial support raising their voices. When 'Umar asked 
permission to enter the women got up (quickly) hurrying to screen 
themselves. When Allah's Apostle admitted 'Umar, Allah's Apostle was 
smiling, 'Umar asked, "O Allah's Apostle! May Allah keep you gay 
always." Allah's Apostle said, "I am astonished at these women who 
were with me. As soon as they heard your voice, they hastened to 
screen themselves." 'Umar said, "O Allah's Apostle! You have more 
right to be feared by them." Then he addressed (those women) saying, 
"O enemies of your own souls! Do you fear me and not Allah's Apostle 
?" They replied. "Yes, for you are a fearful and fierce man as 
compared with Allah's Apostle." On that Allah's Apostle said (to 
'Umar), "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whenever Satan sees you 
taking a path, he follows a path other than yours."
