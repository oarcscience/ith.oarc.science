### Hadith 4:278

*Narrated Salama:*

I went out of Medina towards Al-Ghaba. When I reached the mountain path
of Al-Ghaba, a slave of 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf met me. I said to him,
"Woe to you! What brought you here?" He replied, "The she-camels of the
Prophet have been taken away." I said, "Who took them?" He said,
"Ghatafan and Fazara." So, I sent three cries, "O Sabaha-h ! O Sabahah
!" so loudly that made the people in between its (i.e. Medina's) two
mountains hear me. Then I rushed till I met them after they had taken
the camels away. I started throwing arrows at them saying, "I am the son
of Al-Akwa"; and today perish the mean people!" So, I saved the
she-camels from them before they (i.e. the robbers) could drink water.
When I returned driving the camels, the Prophet met me, I said, "O
Allah's Apostle Those people are thirsty and I have prevented them from
drinking water, so send some people to chase them." The Prophet said, "O
son of Al-Akwa', you have gained power (over your enemy), so forgive
(them). (Besides) those people are now being entertained by their folk."
