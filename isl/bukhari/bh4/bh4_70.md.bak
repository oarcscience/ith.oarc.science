### Hadith 4:71

*Narrated Jabir:*

My father's mutilated body was brought to the Prophet and was placed in
front of him. I went to uncover his face but my companions forbade me.
Then mourning cries of a lady were heard, and it was said that she was
either the daughter or the sister of Amr. The Prophet said, "Why is she
crying?" Or said, "Do not cry, for the angels are still shading him with
their wings." (Al-Bukhari asked Sadqa, a sub-narrator, "Does the
narration include the expression: 'Till he was lifted?' " The latter
replied, "Jabir may have said it.")
