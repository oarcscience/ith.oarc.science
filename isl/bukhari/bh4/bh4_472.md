### Hadith 4:468

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "The first group (of people) who will enter
Paradise will be (glittering) like the moon when it is full. They will
not spit or blow their noses or relieve nature. Their utensils will be
of gold and their combs of gold and silver; in their centers the aloe
wood will be used, and their sweat will smell like musk. Everyone of
them will have two wives; the marrow of the bones of the wives' legs
will be seen through the flesh out of excessive beauty. They ( i.e. the
people of Paradise) will neither have differences nor hatred amongst
themselves; their hearts will be as if one heart and they will be
glorifying Allah in the morning and in the evening."
