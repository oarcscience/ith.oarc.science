### Hadith 4:5

*Narrated Sad bin Abu Waqqas:*

The Prophet came visiting me while I was (sick) in Mecca, ('Amir the
sub-narrator said, and he disliked to die in the land, whence he had
already migrated). He (i.e. the Prophet) said, "May Allah bestow His
Mercy on Ibn Afra (Sad bin Khaula)." I said, "O Allah's Apostle! May I
will all my property (in charity)?" He said, "No." I said, "Then may I
will half of it?" He said, "No". I said, "One third?" He said: "Yes, one
third, yet even one third is too much. It is better for you to leave
your inheritors wealthy than to leave them poor begging others, and
whatever you spend for Allah's sake will be considered as a charitable
deed even the handful of food you put in your wife's mouth. Allah may
lengthen your age so that some people may benefit by you, and some
others be harmed by you." At that time Sad had only one daughter.
