### Hadith 4:603

*Narrated 'Urwa:*

I asked 'Aisha the wife of the Prophet about the meaning of the
following Verse: -- "(Respite will be granted) 'Until when the apostles
give up hope (of their people) and thought that they were denied (by
their people)..............."(12.110) 'Aisha replied, "Really, their
nations did not believe them." I said, "By Allah! They were definite
that their nations treated them as liars and it was not a matter of
suspecting." 'Aisha said, "O 'Uraiya (i.e. 'Urwa)! No doubt, they were
quite sure about it."

I said, "May the Verse be read in such a way as to mean that the
apostles thought that Allah did not help them?" Aisha said, "Allah
forbid! (Impossible) The Apostles did not suspect their Lord of such a
thing. But this Verse is concerned with the Apostles' followers who had
faith in their Lord and believed in their apostles and their period of
trials was long and Allah's Help was delayed till the apostles gave up
hope for the conversion of the disbelievers amongst their nation and
suspected that even their followers were shaken in Prophet said, "The
honorable, the son of the honorable, the son of the honorable, (was)
Joseph, the son of Jacob! the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham."
