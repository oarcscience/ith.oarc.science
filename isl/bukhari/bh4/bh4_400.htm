<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:396</H3><P><I>Narrated Um Hani:</I></P>
the daughter of Abu Talib: I went to Allah's Apostle on the day of the
conquest of Mecca and found him taking a bath, and his daughter Fatima
was screening him. I greeted him and he asked, "Who is that?" I said, 
"I, Um Hani bint Abi Talib." He said, "Welcome, O Um Hani." When he 
had finished his bath, he stood up and offered eight Rakat while 
dressed in one garment. I said, "O Allah's Apostle! My brother 'Ali 
has declared that he will kill a man to whom I have granted asylum. 
The man is so and-so bin Hubaira." Allah's Apostle said, "O Um Hani! 
We will grant asylum to the one whom you have granted asylum." (Um 
Hani said, "That (visit) took place in the Duha (i.e. forenoon)).
