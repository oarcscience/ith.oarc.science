### Hadith 4:581

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

One day some meat was given to the Prophet and he said, "On the Day of
Resurrection Allah will gather all the first and the last (people) in
one plain, and the voice of the announcer will reach all of them, and
one will be able to see them all, and the sun will come closer to them."
(The narrator then mentioned the narration of intercession): "The people
will go to Abraham and say: 'You are Allah's Prophet and His Khalil on
the earth. Will you intercede for us with your Lord?' Abraham will then
remember his lies and say: 'Myself! Myself! Go to Moses."
