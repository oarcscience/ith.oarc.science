### Hadith 4:648

*Narrated Ibn Umar:*

The Prophet said, "I saw Moses, Jesus and Abraham (on the night of my
Ascension to the heavens). Jesus was of red complexion, curly hair and a
broad chest. Moses was of brown complexion, straight hair and tall
stature as if he was from the people of Az-Zutt."
