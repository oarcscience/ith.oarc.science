### Hadith 4:430

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Mus'ud:*

Allah's Apostle, the true and truly inspired said, "(The matter of the
Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the mother in
forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar
period, and then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends
an angel who is ordered to write four things. He is ordered to write
down his (i.e. the new creature's) deeds, his livelihood, his (date of)
death, and whether he will be blessed or wretched (in religion). Then
the soul is breathed into him. So, a man amongst you may do (good deeds
till there is only a cubit between him and Paradise and then what has
been written for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (evil)
deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire. And similarly a
man amongst you may do (evil) deeds till there is only a cubit between
him and the (Hell) Fire, and then what has been written for him decides
his behavior, and he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of
Paradise."
