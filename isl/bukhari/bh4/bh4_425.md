### Hadith 4:421

*Narrated Abu Dhar:*

The Prophet asked me at sunset, "Do you know where the sun goes (at the
time of sunset)?" I replied, "Allah and His Apostle know better." He
said, "It goes (i.e. travels) till it prostrates Itself underneath the
Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and
then (a time will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but
its prostration will not be accepted, and it will ask permission to go
on its course but it will not be permitted, but it will be ordered to
return whence it has come and so it will rise in the west. And that is
the interpretation of the Statement of Allah: "And the sun Runs its
fixed course For a term (decreed). that is The Decree of (Allah) The
Exalted in Might, The All-Knowing." (36.38)
