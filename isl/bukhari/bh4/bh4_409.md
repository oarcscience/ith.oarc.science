### Hadith 4:405

*Narrated Al-Amash:*

I asked Abu Wail, "Did you take part in the battle of Siffin?" He said,
'Yes, and I heard Sahl bin Hunaif (when he was blamed for lack of zeal
for fighting) saying, "You'd better blame your wrong opinions. I wish
you had seen me on the day of Abu Jandal. If I had the courage to
disobey the Prophet's orders, I would have done so. We had kept out
swords on our necks and shoulders, for a thing which frightened us. And
we did so, we found it easier for us, except in the case of the above
battle (of ours).' "
