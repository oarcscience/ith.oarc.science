### Hadith 4:590

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

The Prophet used to seek Refuge with Allah for Al-Hasan and Al-Husain
and say: "Your forefather (i.e. Abraham) used to seek Refuge with Allah
for Ishmael and Isaac by reciting the following: 'O Allah! I seek Refuge
with Your Perfect Words from every devil and from poisonous pests and
from every evil, harmful, envious eye.' "

[Next: 4:591: Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, We are more liable to
be in doubt than Abraham ...](bh4_594)
