### Hadith 4:137

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "Let the slave of Dinar and Dirham of Quantify and
Khamisa (i.e. money and luxurious clothes) perish for he is pleased if
these things are given to him, and if not, he is displeased!"

Dirham, of Quantify and Khamisa perish as he is pleased if these things
are given to him, and if not, he is displeased. Let such a person perish
and relapse, and if he is pierced with a thorn, let him not find anyone
to take it out for him. Paradise is for him who holds the reins of his
horse to strive in Allah's Cause, with his hair unkempt and feet covered
with dust: if he is appointed in the vanguard, he is perfectly satisfied
with his post of guarding, and if he is appointed in the rearward, he
accepts his post with satisfaction; (he is so simple and unambiguous
that) if he asks for permission he is not permitted, and if he
intercedes, his intercession is not accepted."
