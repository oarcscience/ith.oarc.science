### Hadith 4:20

*Narrated Kab bin Malik:*

I said, "O Allah's Apostle! For the acceptance of my repentance I wish
to give all my property in charity for Allah's sake through His Apostle
." He said, "It is better for you to keep some of the property for
yourself." I said, "Then I will keep my share in Khaibar."
