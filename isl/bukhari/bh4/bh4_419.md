### Hadith 4:415

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Allah the Most Superior said, "The son of Adam
slights Me, and he should not slight Me, and he disbelieves in Me, and
he ought not to do so. As for his slighting Me, it is that he says that
I have a son; and his disbelief in Me is his statement that I shall not
recreate him as I have created (him) before."
