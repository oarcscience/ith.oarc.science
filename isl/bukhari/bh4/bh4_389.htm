<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:385</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amr bin 'Auf Al-Ansari:</I></P>
(who was an ally of Bam 'Amr bin Lu'ai and one of those who had taken 
part in (the Ghazwa of) Badr): Allah's Apostle sent Abu 'Ubaida bin 
Al-Jarreh to Bahrain to collect the Jizya. Allah's Apostle had 
established peace with the people of Bahrain and appointed Al-'Ala' 
bin Al-Hadrami as their governor. When Abu 'Ubaida came from Bahrain 
with the money, the Ansar heard of Abu 'Ubaida's arrival which 
coincided with the time of the morning prayer with the Prophet. When 
Allah's Apostle led them in the morning prayer and finished, the Ansar
approached him, and he looked at them and smiled on seeing them and 
said, "I feel that you have heard that Abu. 'Ubaida has brought 
something?" They said, "Yes, O Allah's Apostle' He said, "Rejoice and 
hope for what will please you! By Allah, I am not afraid of your 
poverty but I am afraid that you will lead a life of luxury as past 
nations did, whereupon you will compete with each other for it, as 
they competed for it, and it will destroy you as it destroyed them."
