### Hadith 4:131

*Narrated Anas:*

On the day (of the battle) of Uhad when (some) people retreated and left
the Prophet, I saw 'Aisha bint Abu Bakr and Um Sulaim, with their robes
tucked up so that the bangles around their ankles were visible hurrying
with their water skins (in another narration it is said, "carrying the
water skins on their backs"). Then they would pour the water in the
mouths of the people, and return to fill the water skins again and came
back again to pour water in the mouths of the people.
