### Hadith 4:515

*Narrated Sad bin Abi Waqqas:*

Once Umar asked the leave to see Allah's Apostle in whose company there
were some Quraishi women who were talking to him and asking him for more
financial support raising their voices. When 'Umar asked permission to
enter the women got up (quickly) hurrying to screen themselves. When
Allah's Apostle admitted 'Umar, Allah's Apostle was smiling, 'Umar
asked, "O Allah's Apostle! May Allah keep you gay always." Allah's
Apostle said, "I am astonished at these women who were with me. As soon
as they heard your voice, they hastened to screen themselves." 'Umar
said, "O Allah's Apostle! You have more right to be feared by them."
Then he addressed (those women) saying, "O enemies of your own souls! Do
you fear me and not Allah's Apostle ?" They replied. "Yes, for you are a
fearful and fierce man as compared with Allah's Apostle." On that
Allah's Apostle said (to 'Umar), "By Him in Whose Hands my life is,
whenever Satan sees you taking a path, he follows a path other than
yours."
