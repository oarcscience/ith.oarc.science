### Hadith 4:113

*Narrated Muslim from Abu Aqil from Abu Al-Mutawakkil An-Naji:*

I called on Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari and said to him, "Relate to me
what you have heard from Allah's Apostle ." He said, "I accompanied him
on one of the journeys." (Abu Aqil said, "I do not know whether that
journey was for the purpose of Jihad or 'Umra.") "When we were
returning," Jabir continued, "the Prophet said, 'Whoever wants to return
earlier to his family, should hurry up.' We set off and I was on a black
red tainted camel having no defect, and the people were behind me. While
I was in that state the camel stopped suddenly (because of exhaustion).
On that the Prophet said to me, 'O Jabir, wait!' Then he hit it once
with his lash and it started moving on a fast pace. He then said, 'Will
you sell the camel?' I replied in the affirmative when we reached
Medina, and the Prophet went to the Mosque along with his companions. I,
too, went to him after tying the camel on the pavement at the Mosque
gate. Then I said to him, 'This is your camel.' He came out and started
examining the camel and saying, 'The camel is ours.' Then the Prophet
sent some Awaq (i.e. an amount) of gold saying, 'Give it to Jabir.' Then
he asked, 'Have you taken the full price (of the camel)?' I replied in
the affirmative. He said, 'Both the price and the camel are for you.' ''
