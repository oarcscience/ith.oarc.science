### Hadith 4:255

*Narrated Abu Burda's father:*

The Prophet said, "Three persons will get their reward twice. (One is) a
person who has a slave girl and he educates her properly and teaches her
good manners properly (without violence) and then manumits and marries
her. Such a person will get a double reward. (Another is) a believer
from the people of the scriptures who has been a true believer and then
he believes in the Prophet (Muhammad). Such a person will get a double
reward. (The third is) a slave who observes Allah's Rights and
Obligations and is sincere to his master."
