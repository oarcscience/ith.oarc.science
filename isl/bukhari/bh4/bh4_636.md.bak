### Hadith 4:633

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

The prostration in Sura-Sad is not amongst the compulsory prostrations,
though I saw the Prophet prostrating on reciting The Statement of
Allah:--and to David We gave Solomon (for a son). How excellent (a)
slave he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to us) (38.30) And His
Statement:-- He said: My Lord Forgive me and grant me a kingdom such as
shall not belong to any other after me.' (38.35) And His Statement:--
'And they followed what the Devils gave out (falsely), of magic in the
life-time of Solomon.' (2.102)
