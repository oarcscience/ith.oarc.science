### Hadith 4:312

*Narrated Abu Uthman An-Nahdi:*

Mujashi (bin Mas'ud) took his brother Mujalid bin Musud to the Prophet
and said, "This is Mujalid and he will give a pledge of allegiance to
you for migration." The Prophet said, "There is no migration after the
Conquest of Mecca, but I will take his pledge of allegiance for Islam."
