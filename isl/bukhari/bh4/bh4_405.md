### Hadith 4:401

*Narrated Auf bin Mali:*

I went to the Prophet during the Ghazwa of Tabuk while he was sitting in
a leather tent. He said, "Count six signs that indicate the approach of
the Hour: my death, the conquest of Jerusalem, a plague that will
afflict you (and kill you in great numbers) as the plague that afflicts

which no Arab house will escape, and then a truce between you and Bani
Al-Asfar (i.e. the Byzantines) who will betray you and attack you under
eighty flags. Under each flag will be twelve thousand soldiers.
