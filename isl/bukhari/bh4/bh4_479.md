### Hadith 4:475

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said "There is a tree in Paradise (which is so big and huge
that) a rider could travel in its shade for a hundred years. And if you
wish, you can recite:--'In shade long extended..' (56. 30) and a place
in Paradise equal to an arrow bow of one of you, is better than (the
whole earth) on which the sun rises and sets."

who will enter Paradise...](bh4_480.md)
