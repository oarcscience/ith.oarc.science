### Hadith 4:310

*Narrated Qais:*

Jarir bin 'Abdullah said to me, "Allah's Apostle said to me, 'Won't you
relieve me from Dhul-Khalasa?' Dhul-Khalasa was a house where the tribe
of Khatham used to stay, and it used to be called Ka'bat-ul Yamaniya. So
I proceeded with one hundred-and-fifty (men) from the tribe of Ahmas who
were good cavalry. I informed the Prophet that I could not sit firm on
horses, so he stroke me on the chest with his hand and I noticed his
finger marks on my chest. He invoked, 'O Allah! Make him firm and a
guiding and rightly-guided man." Jarir set out towards that place,
dismantled and burnt it, and then sent the good news to Allah's Apostle
. The messenger of Jarir said to Allah's Apostle. "O Allah's Apostle! By
Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I did not come to you till it (i.e.
the house) had been turned (black) like a scabby camel (covered with
tar)." So the Prophet invokes Allah to Bless the horses of the men of
Ahmas five times.
