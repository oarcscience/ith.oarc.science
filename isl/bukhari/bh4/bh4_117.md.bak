### Hadith 4:116

*Narrated Abu Ishaq:*

Somebody asked Al-Bar-a bin 'Azib, "Did you flee deserting Allah's
Apostle during the battle of Hunain?" Al-Bara replied, "But Allah's
Apostle did not flee. The people of the Tribe of Hawazin were good
archers. When we met them, we attacked them, and they fled. When the
Muslims started collecting the war booty, the pagans faced us with
arrows, but Allah's Apostle did not flee. No doubt, I saw him on his
white mule and Abu Sufyan was holding its reins and the Prophet was
saying, 'I am the Prophet in truth: I am the son of 'Abdul Muttalib.' "
