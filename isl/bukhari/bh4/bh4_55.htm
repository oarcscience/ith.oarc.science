<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:56</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
Um Haram said, "Once the Prophet slept in my house near to me and got 
up smiling. I said, 'What makes you smile?' He replied, 'Some of my 
followers who (i.e. in a dream) were presented to me sailing on this 
green sea like kings on thrones.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Invoke 
Allah to make me one of them." So the Prophet invoked Allah for her 
and went to sleep again. He did the same (i.e. got up and told his 
dream) and Um Haran repeated her question and he gave the same reply. 
She said, "Invoke Allah to make me one of them." He said, "You are 
among the first batch." Later on it happened that she went out in the 
company of her husband 'Ubada bin As-Samit who went for Jihad and it 
was the first time the Muslims undertook a naval expedition led by Mu 
awiya. When the expedition came to an end and they were returning to 
Sham, a riding animal was presented to her to ride, but the animal let
her fall and thus she died.
