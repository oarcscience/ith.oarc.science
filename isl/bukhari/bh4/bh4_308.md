### Hadith 4:304

*Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:*

I said, "O Allah's Apostle! We have slaughtered a young sheep of ours
and have ground one Sa of barley. So, I invite you along with some
persons." So, the Prophet said in a loud voice, "O the people of the
Trench! Jabir had prepared "Sur" so come along."
