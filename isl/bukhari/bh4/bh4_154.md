### Hadith 4:153

*Narrated 'Umar:*

The properties of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had transferred to His
Apostle as Fai Booty were not gained by the Muslims with their horses
and camels. The properties therefore, belonged especially to Allah's
Apostle who used to give his family their yearly expenditure and spend
what remained thereof on arms and horses to be used in Allah's Cause.
