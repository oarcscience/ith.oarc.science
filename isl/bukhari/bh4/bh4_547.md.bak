### Hadith 4:544

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "The first group of people who will enter
Paradise, will be glittering like the full moon and those who will
follow them, will glitter like the most brilliant star in the sky. They
will not urinate, relieve nature, spit, or have any nasal secretions.
Their combs will be of gold, and their sweat will smell like musk. The
aloes-wood will be used in their centers. Their wives will be houris.
All of them will look alike and will resemble their father Adam (in
statute), sixty cubits tall."
