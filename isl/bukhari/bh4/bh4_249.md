### Hadith 4:247

*Narrated Aslam:*

I heard 'Umar bin Al-Khattab saying, "I gave a horse to be ridden in
Allah's Cause and the person who got it intended to sell it or neglected
it. So, I wanted to buy it as I thought he would sell it cheap. I
consulted the Prophet who said, "Do not buy it even if for one Dirham,
because he who takes back his gift is like a dog swallowing its vomit."
