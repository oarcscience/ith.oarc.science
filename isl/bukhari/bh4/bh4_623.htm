<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:620</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
A Muslim and a Jew quarreled. The Muslim taking an oath, said, "By Him
Who has preferred Muhammad over all people...!" The Jew said, "By Him 
Who has preferred Moses, over all people." The Muslim raised his hand 
and slapped the Jew who came to the Prophet to tell him what had 
happened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet said, "Don't give me 
superiority over Moses, for the people will become unconscious (on the
Day of Resurrection) and I will be the first to gain consciousness to 
see Moses standing and holding a side of Allah's Throne. I will not 
know if he has been among those people who have become unconscious; 
and that he has gained consciousness before me, or he has been amongst
those whom Allah has exempted."
