<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:283</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Juhaifa:</I></P>
I asked Ali, "Do you have the knowledge of any Divine Inspiration 
besides what is in Allah's Book?" 'Ali replied, "No, by Him Who splits
the grain of corn and creates the soul. I don't think we have such 
knowledge, but we have the ability of understanding which Allah may 
endow a person with, so that he may understand the Qur'an, and we have
what is written in this paper as well." I asked, "What is written in 
this paper?" He replied, "(The regulations of) blood-money, the 
freeing of captives, and the judgment that no Muslim should be killed 
for killing an infidel."
