### Hadith 4:508

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

The Prophet said, "While the angels talk amidst the clouds about things
that are going to happen on earth, the devils hear a word of what they
say and pour it in the ears of a soothsayer as one pours something in a
bottle, and they add one hundred lies to that (one word)."
