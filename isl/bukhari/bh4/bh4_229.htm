That she said, "O Allah's Apostle! Your companions are returning with 
the reward of both Hajj and 'Umra, while I am returning with (the 
reward of) Hajj only." He said to her, "Go, and let 'Abdur-Rahman 
(i.e. your brother) make you sit behind him (on the animal)." So, he 
ordered 'AbdurRahman to let her perform 'Umra from Al-Tan'im. Then the
Prophet waited for her at the higher region of Mecca till she 
returned.
