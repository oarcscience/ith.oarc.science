### Hadith 4:626

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Once while a Jew was selling something, he was offered a price that he
was not pleased with. So, he said, "No, by Him Who gave Moses
superiority over all human beings!" Hearing him, an Ansari man got up
and slapped him on the face and said, "You say: By Him Who Gave Moses
superiority over all human beings although the Prophet (Muhammad) is
present amongst us!" The Jew went to the Prophet and said, "O
Abu-l-Qasim! I am under the assurance and contract of security, so what
right does so-and-so have to slap me?" The Prophet asked the other, "Why
have you slapped". He told him the whole story. The Prophet became
angry, till anger appeared on his face, and said, "Don't give
superiority to any prophet amongst Allah's Prophets, for when the
trumpet will be blown, everyone on the earth and in the heavens will
become unconscious except those whom Allah will exempt. The trumpet will
be blown for the second time and I will be the first to be resurrected
to see Moses holding Allah's Throne. I will not know whether the
unconsciousness which Moses received on the Day of Tur has been
sufficient for him, or has he got up before me. And I do not say that
there is anybody who is better than Yunus bin Matta."
