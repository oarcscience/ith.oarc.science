### Hadith 4:337

*Narrated 'Amra bint Abdur-Rahman:*

'Aisha, the wife of the Prophet told her that once Allah's Apostle was
with her and she heard somebody asking permission to enter Hafsa's
house. She said, "O Allah's Apostle! This man is asking permission to
enter your house." Allah's Apostle replied, "I think he is so-and-so
(meaning the foster uncle of Hafsa). What is rendered illegal because of
blood relations, is also rendered illegal because of the corresponding
foster-relations."
