### Hadith 4:222

*Narrated Asma:*

I prepared the journey-food for Allah's Apostle in Abu Bakr's house when
he intended to emigrate to Medina. I could not find anything to tie the
food-container and the water skin with. So, I said to Abu Bakr, "By
Allah, I do not find anything to tie (these things) with except my waist
belt." He said, "Cut it into two pieces and tie the water-skin with one

"She did accordingly and that was the reason for calling her
Dhatun-Nitaqain (i.e. two-belted woman))."
