### Hadith 4:655

*Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari:*

Allah's Apostle said, "If a person teaches his slave girl good manners
properly, educates her properly, and then manumits and marries her, he
will get a double reward. And if a man believes in Jesus and then
believes in me, he will get a double reward. And if a slave fears his
Lord (i.e. Allah) and obeys his masters, he too will get a double
reward."
