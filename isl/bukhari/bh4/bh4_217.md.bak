### Hadith 4:216

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Were it not for the fear that it would be
difficult for my followers, I would not have remained behind any Sariya,
(army-unit) but I don't have riding camels and have no other means of
conveyance to carry them on, and it is hard for me that my companions
should remain behind me. No doubt I wish I could fight in Allah's Cause
and be martyred and come to life again to be martyred and come to life
once more."
