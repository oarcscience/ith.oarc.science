### Hadith 4:188

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Tufail bin 'Amr Ad-Dausi and his companions came to the Prophet and
said, "O Allah's Apostle! The people of the tribe of Daus disobeyed and
refused to follow you; so invoke Allah against them." The people said,
"The tribe of Daus is ruined." The Prophet said, "O Allah! Give guidance
to the people of Daus, and let them embrace Islam."
