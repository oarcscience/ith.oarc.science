### Hadith 4:65

*Narrated Abu Musa:*

A man came to the Prophet and asked, "A man fights for war booty;
another fights for fame and a third fights for showing off; which of
them fights in Allah's Cause?" The Prophet said, "He who fights that
Allah's Word (i.e. Islam) should be superior, fights in Allah's Cause."
