### Hadith 4:159

*Narrated Sahl:*

That he was asked about the wound of the Prophet on the day (of the
battle) of Uhud. He said, "The face of the Prophet as wounded and one of
his front teeth as broken and the helmet over his head was smashed.
Fatima washed of the blood while Ali held water. When she saw that
bleeding was increasing continuously, she burnt a mat (of date-palm
leaves) till it turned into ashes which she put over the wound and thus
the bleeding ceased."
