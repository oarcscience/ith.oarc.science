<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:33</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
When 'Umar got a piece of land in Khaibar, he came to the Prophet 
saying, "I have got a piece of land, better than which I have never 
got. So what do you advise me regarding it?" The Prophet said, "If you
wish you can keep it as an endowment to be used for charitable 
purposes." So, 'Umar gave the land in charity (i.e. as an endowments 
on the condition that the land would neither be sold nor given as a 
present, nor bequeathed, (and its yield) would be used for the poor, 
the kinsmen, the emancipation of slaves, Jihad, and for guests and 
travelers; and its administrator could eat in a reasonable just 
manner, and he also could feed his friends without intending to be 
wealthy by its means."
