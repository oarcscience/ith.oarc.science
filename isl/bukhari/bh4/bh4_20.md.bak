### Hadith 4:21

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

Some people claim that the order in the above Verse is cancelled, by
Allah, it is not cancelled, but the people have stopped acting on it.
There are two kinds of guardians (who are in charge of the inheritance):
One is that who inherits; such a person should give (of what he inherits
to the relatives, the orphans and the needy, etc.), the other is that
who does not inherit (e.g. the guardian of the orphans): such a person
should speak kindly and say (to those who are present at the time of
distribution), "I can not give it to you (as the wealth belongs to the
orphans)."
