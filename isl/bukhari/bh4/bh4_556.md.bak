### Hadith 4:553

*Narrated Ibn Umar:*

Once Allah's Apostle stood amongst the people, glorified and praised
Allah as He deserved and then mentioned the Dajjal saying, "l warn you
against him (i.e. the Dajjal) and there was no prophet but warned his
nation against him. No doubt, Noah warned his nation against him but I
tell you about him something of which no prophet told his nation before
me. You should know that he is one-eyed, and Allah is not one-eyed."

about the Dajjal a story ...](bh4_557.md)
