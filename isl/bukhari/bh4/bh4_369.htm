<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:365</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said (to me), "If the property of Bahrain had come to 
us, I would have given you so much and so much." But the Bahrain 
property did not come till the Prophet had died. When the Bahrain 
property came. Abu Bakr ordered somebody to announce, "Any person who 
has money claim on Allah's Apostle or whom Allah's Apostle had 
promised something, should come to us." So, I went to him and said, 
"Allah's Apostle had promised to give me so much an so much." Abu Bakr
scooped up money with both hands thrice for me." (The sub-narrator 
Sufyan illustrated this action by scooping up with both hands and 
said, "Ibn Munkadir, another sub-narrator, used to illustrate it in 
this way.") 
<P>
did not give me, and I went to him again, but he did not give me, so I
went to him for the third time and said, "I asked you, but you did not
give me; then I asked you (for the second time) and you did not give 
me; then I asked you (for the third time) but you did not give me. You
should either give me or allow yourself to be considered a miser 
regarding my case." Abu Bakr said, "You tell me that I am a miser with
regard to you. But really, whenever I rejected your request, I had the
inclination to give you."
<P>
(In another narration Jabir added:) So, Abu Bakr scooped up money with
both hands for me and asked me to count it. I found out that It was 
five hundred. Abu Bakr told me to take twice that amount.
