### Hadith 4:47

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Allah's Apostle used to visit Um Haran bint Milhan, who would offer him
reals. Um-Haram was the wife of Ubada bin As-Samit. Allah's Apostle,
once visited her and she provided him with food and started looking for
lice in his head. Then Allah's Apostle slept, and afterwards woke up
smiling. Um Haran asked, "What causes you to smile, O Allah's Apostle?"
He said. "Some of my followers who (in a dream) were presented before me
as fighters in Allah's Cause (on board a ship) amidst this sea cause me
to smile; they were as kings on the thrones (or like kings on the
thrones)." (Ishaq, a sub-narrator is not sure as to which expression the
Prophet used.) Um-Haram said, "O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah that he
makes me one of them. Allah's Apostle invoked Allah for her and slept
again and woke up smiling. Once again Um Haram asked, "What makes you
smile, O Allah's Apostle?" He replied, "Some of my followers were
presented to me as fighters in Allah's Cause," repeating the same dream.
Um-Haram said, "O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah that He makes me one of
them." He said, "You are amongst the first ones." It happened that she
sailed on the sea during the Caliphate of Mu'awlya bin Abi Sufyan, and
after she disembarked, she fell down from her riding animal and died.
