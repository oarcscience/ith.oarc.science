### Hadith 4:390

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

Allah's Apostle once said to me, "If the revenue of Bahrain came, I
would give you this much and this much." When Allah's Apostle had died,
the revenue of Bahrain came, and Abu Bakr announced, " Let whoever was
promised something by Allah's Apostle come to me." So, I went to Abu
Bakr and said, "Allah's Apostle said to me, 'If the revenue of Bahrain
came, I would give you this much and this. much." On that Abu Bakr said
to me, "Scoop (money) with both your hands." I scooped money with both
my hands and Abu Bakr asked me to count it. I counted it and it was
five-hundred (gold pieces). The total amount he gave me was one thousand
and five hundred (gold pieces.)

said, "Spread it in the Mosque." It was the biggest amount that had ever
been brought to Allah's Apostle . In the meantime Al-'Abbas came to him
and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Give me, for I gave the ransom of myself
and Aqil." The Prophet said (to him), "Take." He scooped money with both
hands and poured it in his garment and tried to lift it, but he could
not and appealed to the Prophet, "Will you order someone to help me in
lifting it?" The Prophet said, "No." Then Al-'Abbas said, "Then will you
yourself help me carry it?" The Prophet said, "No." Then Al 'Abbas threw
away some of the money, but even then he was not able to lift it, and so
he gain requested the Prophet "Will you order someone to help me carry
it?" The Prophet said, "No." Then Al-'Abbas said, "Then will you
yourself yelp me carry it?" The Prophet said, 'No." So, Al-'Abbas threw
away some more money and lifted it on his shoulder and went away. The
Prophet kept on looking at him with astonishment at his greediness till
he went out of our sight. Allah's Apostle did not get up from there till
not a single Dirham remained from that money.
