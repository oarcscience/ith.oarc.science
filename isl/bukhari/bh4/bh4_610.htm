<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:607</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "On the night of my Ascension to Heaven, I saw 
(the prophet) Moses who was a thin person with lank hair, looking like
one of the men of the tribe of Shanua; and I saw Jesus who was of 
average height with red face as if he had just come out of a bathroom.
And I resemble prophet Abraham more than any of his offspring does. 
Then I was given two cups, one containing milk and the other wine. 
Gabriel said, 'Drink whichever you like.' I took the milk and drank 
it. Gabriel said, 'You have accepted what is natural, (True Religion 
i.e. Islam) and if you had taken the wine, your followers would have 
gone astray.' "
